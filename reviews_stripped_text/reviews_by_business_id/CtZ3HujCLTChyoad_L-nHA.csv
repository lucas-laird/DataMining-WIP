I have been in many times and after I choose my sauce they automatically start putting mozzarella cheese. And I have to stop them.

194468,2016-08-28,0,CtZ3HujCLTChyoad_L-nHA,"Completely upset about this experience,  I went on a Friday at lunch and when I arrived there were only two customers in line.  

I placed my order with the dough person, then waited for the next gal in line to do the sauce and cheese process, she apparently needed more experience. It took her FOREVER to do the previous order of three pizzas and finally she started on mine, someone came from the back with a call in order and she stopped mid sauce on my pizza and started that order of 3 pizzas, all the while the rest of the crew waited for her to finish the sauce and pizza process so they could place the toppings and hand the pizzas to be cooked in the oven. 
The next few employees in the prepping line looked rather anxious as the line began to build, finally my pizza was pushed down to the next guy and given to the oven guy, relieved as I have only an hour for lunch, I paid, got my drink and began waiting for my name to be called. 

20 mins passed, I began to become anxious, I asked the guy working the register, ""how much longer""  to which I was told they'd call my name when it was ready, I explained that  other people who had placed their orders after me were eatting, asking  him to double check. he  replied, ""we're a little busy!"" by then the line to order was to the door. Another lady came up, asking about her order also upset, finally my name was called! Only they weren't giving me the right pizza, so after another few minutes, apparently it was decide...my pizza was accidentally given to someone else. A male manager came over to the register, began to issue a refund for my pizza, handing me the cash and never apologized or anything. Needless to say I was upset that I was still hungry, late back to work and had been treated poorly.

The line went to the door but we didn't wait too long to order. The restaurant was very loud and was a little messy. It was difficult to find a clean table. I just figured it was due to how busy it was. 
My husband ordered the double crust so I chose the original thin crust pizza. I also ordered a side Caesar salad. The ordering process was not very organized to begin with. They took your order and wrote your name on the paper that the pizza crust was placed on. After tells the next person what you wanted on your pizza, it was ready to go in the oven and you proceed to pay. We paid, got our drinks and found a place to sit and wait.  They call out your name when your pizza comes out which adds to the loud atmosphere and on top of it they seem to struggle to read the names they have written down as many of the papers get burned while baking and erases the name. Finally, after my husband and I received both pizzas we tried it. I was so disappointed in the taste of the sauce! It tasted like canned tomato sauce and the crust was extremely thin and looked like it was precooked. My husbands pizza was kept longer because of the double crust and you could see by the burnt paper underneath that it was in the oven a while yet his cheese wasn't even melted!
This pizza was NOT good at all! Great concept (although it's not so new anymore) but not good. Save your money and don't try the new place--- go to Pizza Kitchen on Fort Apache instead. They are fantastic!",LzpWmR0dvg_uOWedfKo0mQ,0,0,2,wqCbRMtxX535k0WICE_3Gg

I might be spoiled growing up in the NY/NJ metro area,but this was pretty lame.I could make better pizza in my toaster oven on an english muffin.Living in Vegas 11 years now,and this is probably the worst I have had.

On top of everything else it takes forever,why does it take 20 minutes to place your order when only 6 or 7 people in line.Employees horribly slow and deliberately stingy with the toppings.

Crust,nothing special and tasteless,Frozen pizza from the lunch line in elementary school is better.Spicy sauce overpowering and you can't taste any toppings.Sauce was super thick like just eating straight tomato paste.EXTREMELY CHEAP WITH THE TOPPINGS.Did all veggie and they put like 2 or 3 pieces of each topping on.What a joke.....What is 3 pieces of basil gonna do?(all 3 pieces maybe equaled 1 basil leaf).Same issue with all toppings.

When making pizza they didn't just brush the crust with little oil... they poured a whole bunch. Pizza was so greasy that my wife couldn't even eat more than 2 tiny slices. 

Salads look like an afterthought idea to sell to people that can't have their greasy pizza.

This is a casual, fast-fired, make your own pizza place set up similar to Chipotle/Cafe Rio. 

They offer three crusts, thin, double crust, or gluten free. We both had the thin crust. It was comparable to a cracker. It was very thin, didn't fold well. Almost too crisp like an unsalted saltine cracker.

Sauces include red, white and bbq. We both ordered a pizza with red sauce. The red sauce is comparable to canned tomato paste that is watered down to pizza sauce consistency, which is not very good. 

The cheese options is italian, ricotta, bleu, feta and low fat italian. 

The selection of toppings ranged from meatballs to arugula and of course classics like pepperoni. I was looking for salami, pesto and roasted garlic, but did not see any. 

They have tea and one of those soda selection machines. They also had hot sauce, peppers, cheese and oregano next to the soda machine.

Overall, the customer service was amazing. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Service was quick and the line was moving. It is grand opening week so they were doing a charity event. Pizza was the price of a donation. There is outside seating and ample seatin indoors as well. They also have beer available. The usual price for a custom pizza is $7.99. They have a kids pizza as well. 

I really tried to like this place, but after having Blaze Pizza, this place doesn't come close. Next time I'm in the area and craving pizza, I will head down the street to Grimaldi's.",K8gfFsaQWanzLFdcbQL22g,1,3,3,daxhucehimRXpFPQtGgeEA

Thought I was at chipotle a little bit with the conveyor belt process of a build your own. But it was ok... you gotta watch the person making your pizza... I ended up with double spinach cause dude lost track of what pizza he was working on. Not complaining cause I love the green. Just saying. I was paying for the group and two people in our group were already at the register and the employee kinda rushed the process and one drink got ordered for the table. Very distracting trying to build my pizza 10ft away and try to pay the bill at the same time. After you create your own the pie gets tossed in the oven and stood there waiting for several minutes. Realizing we didn't have a beverage I decided I wanted a beer. Oh yeah they have beer. On tap and in bottles. Now hold it.. as We are standing at the register now.. going on like 10m. No one has been at the register. The line has piled up.. our pizza is cooling off and we're getting hangry. I notice in this time that you can get ANY PIZZA and a BEER for 9.95. This combo is confusing to me as the pizza I ordered was that alone because the ""thick""crust option is a high price. So hint... get the original thin crust. So finally some girl comes from the back and says because we already paid for the food (remember when we were rushed through) we had to pay again for the beer. Even though based on their advertising.... I should have a BEER in my hand. We paid extra for the beer because well.. pizza and beer. So all in all the key is original crust and get your beer at the register. Also.. just like most places being vegan or offering vegan options, your are paying a premium (extortion) for this.. like 1$ charge for vegan cheese (daiya) and then receiving a fraction of the amount of cheese as to be compared to a dairy pizza. I would be back for the convenience of it. But would not at all make it a habit as it's not that special.",zuopKcPI1VBVFG8ynCHIMA,1,1,4,GzbMSuQ50YM73An1JPKuig

To start, the flow of the line wasn't functional. As expected, there were a lot of people waiting. The person applying the sauce and cheese took the longest and was by herself, consistently backed up. The toppings employees should have been helping apply the cheese to speed up the line. It took almost 10 minutes in the line before I was even able to place my order. 

My next issue, is my biggest issue. This place was absolutely disgusting and dirty. The counter tops were just nasty. Every inch of glass has finger prints and every inch of work space was covered in suave and mashed toppings. The employees putting on toppings NEVER changed their gloves. I watched one employe apply anchovies to a pizza then reach into the pineapples. How gross is this?? I couldn't get over this..... 

As for the food, I ordered 2 personal pizzas. The first was a traditional red sauce with traditional toppings (pepperoni, olives, peppers, ect) and my second pizza was a white sauce with bacon and chicken. The first pizza was extremely greasy, and  just ok - it wasn't bad by any means, but not sensational. BUT the second pizza was incredible!! It was the only highlight of my life experience and I'm glad I ordered the white sauce. I would highly recommend it. 

Unfortunately for PizzaRev, I probably won't be back due to dirtiness of everything. If they can't keep have pride in wiping down the counters after each customer, then who knows what happens behind closed doors.

I walk in and stand near the cash register to pick up my order. Female employee just stares at me, as if I'm cutting the line ? Not asking what I'm there for until, she finally had to walk over to the register to assist a customer pay. Her aura was salty af, like relax! I'm only here to pick up my order, not rob the place!

After 5-7 minutes of waiting to finally get my pizzas, and the manager (owner?) calls me over. Goes through the motions to show me my pizzas to make sure they are correct. They were correct except for one pizza was a different customers. No big deal, they had the correct pizza done already just need to switch it out. 

WRONG! The manager thought it was a big deal! He begins scolding a male employee in front of me. ""You guys suck, like seriously watch these pizzas better!"" 

I'm all for coaching your employees, but.... probably should coach the right employee (that employee didn't prep my order!) and two, probably shouldn't be such a jerk? about it.

#1 They have beer and wine. Who doesn't love the classic combination of pizza and beer?! Plus they actually have a bar area with a couple of TVs to watch a game. This chain skews toward a slightly older crowd than the other family-centric chains.

#2 Their service is hella friendly. Like, Brandon and I could legit be friends. It's not just greeting everyone and smiling, the staff along the assembly line make genuine conversation. 

#3 They have constant promos and discounts! Mondays 4 can dine for $40, including pizzas, salad, drinks, and dessert. Tuesdays, their usual $8 pies are $6. Downloading their RevRewards app gets you an instant freebie. It's like they actually want you to come back!

#4 Their product is pretty good. You can double up on crusts for a thicker hand-tossed version, or pay $2 more for GF. They aren't stingy with the toppings.

Love the concept of building your own pizza and I'm a fan of the other two businesses in town who do the same thing. 

I chose half a margarita & the other half BBQ chicken. Wanted to add ricotta to the margarita side but they were out. Ricotta is sold & available everywhere... The tomatoes were diced finely and it looked like my pizza had salsa on it. This also made my pizza wet and I HATE wet pizza. Why can't they simply cut a baby tomato in half & call it a day? On to the BBQ chicken pizza, the chicken didn't taste like anything, completely bland with zero seasoning. They forgot to add red onions to it as well which I should have caught as they were making it but it was an item that was supposed to come on that particular pizza. 

The pizzas are super thin which I love but mine was unfortunately soggy from the diced tomatoes. I also like that they cook in about 3-4 minutes. I may give it one more shot and try something else but first impressions are a big deal to me and this one wasn't a good one.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,47,34,2,aBu9LBhaKDhWx_10Sfaymw

I suspect that people who have grown up here don't know good pizza, and as LV locals just like to gripe and bitch about everything anyway......;-) 
Having lived in Chicago most recently, I knew I would have to lower my standards where pizza is concerned. A lot. Not surprisingly, I've been mostly disappointed by the pizza I've had, so I've been making my own or buying frozen pizza, which is still better than a lot of the take out pizza here. I used to go to this little hole in the wall make your own pizza joint in Brookfield, WI as I used to travel there a lot. It was amazing. So when I saw PizzaRev I was totally stoked to try it. It was everything I was hoping it would be and more.
First of all, Brandon(GM) and Co. were all about the good service and very friendly, explained their za program, etc. While not a wood-fired oven(as I'm a total pizza snob), they did bang out the pizzas cooked perfectly in just a few minutes. I like a very crispy crust and well done crust on the edges, even a little burnt is ok, which it wasn't. And my friend and I both got a really good size za, prob about a small at most pizza joints, covered with toppings and a drink for less than the price of a medium pizza at other places with maybe 2 or 3 toppings on it and with a much shorter wait. 
They also have a good rewards app, after 1 visit I was already 20% of the way to a free pizza. And Tuesdays are $6 pizza. There's no downside here for me. I'm done with the crappy, over-priced and under-cooked local pizza places. I'll take the 15 minute drive, it's still quicker than the 25 to 30 minute wait I'll have to suffer through at the corner pizza place anyway. I'm all about the PizzaRev.

I would have given you 1-Star but your staff was extremely friendly and had an excellent attitude, even though they could use some serious courses on efficiency and processing of customers.

First - there were 6 people in line ahead of us and it took 15 minutes for them to be processed through the line.

Second - after it finally got to be our turn, our ""prep person"" kept getting interrupted to do other tasks.  She was extremely friendly and had a great attitude and was fun to work with in line.  In fact, ALL of them were.   PizzaRev, you have a great staff... get your act together and give them the help they need to be efficient.

Third - the pizza is just BAD.  The red sauce has no flavor (the white needed extra garlic) and the ingredients were bland.  The sole exception was the sweet fennel sausage.  Now that had promise there just wasn't enough of it.   We had both the double dough and the single dough and both needed a bit more cooking as it was chewy and spongy.   

The ingredient selection was fine, but I think they need to be a bit fresher to get more flavor.

I always get the double dough, and almost everyone I know that's gone at least once will agree that their thin crust is just too cracker-like. 

While I love to load my pizza up, my only warning is this, the more toppings you add, the less hot the entire topping base will be. Adding like 6+ toppings causes some of the toppings not to get as hot as the pizza. Just a little tip for those who go crazy their first time.

1. Pizza is average, conveniently located.  It was hard to say if there was a good understanding of the choices since the person greeting us didn't explain anything.  Just uttered something about traditional crust and barely looked in our general direction.  (See service)
2. Thinner crust, chewy, selections of toppings, similar to a lot of other ""pizza craft"" restaurants

Ambiance
1. Spacious, good amount of seating. 
2. I like that this one (possibly others) has a Coca-Cola Freestyle to make various flavored drinks

Service
1. This is where the 2/5 stars comes in
2. From the initial greeting with the ""something -something"" crust offering to the end it was not great.  I had to ask twice/thrice since the person choosing the crust to get things started had a poor attitude.  Practically snipped words I could barely make out and looked annoyed when I wasn't able to catch the words to make sense of what she is saying.  No guidance on how to pick toppings.  
3. At the cashier, I had to wait for a very long time as some guy never greeted me but passed by a multitude of times and never looked my way even though I was holding a credit card and clearly needed to pay.  Thought crossed my mind that perhaps this business prefers to just GIVE pizzas away.
4. There was a snafoo with an ""unidentified pizza"" floating around which involved almost all the staff and manager to figure out why one customer got the wrong pizza and one unclaimed pizza.  I have to reiterate it all starts with the initial encounter where a friendly employee NEEDS to politely ask for names and properly write it on the paper like they do at Blaze or Pieology.  And yet the entire business had to come to practically a halt due to the pizza mixup.
5. manager presented ""my"" pizza to me but questioned me along the lines of ""Isn't this your pizza"".  I am not sure why it so difficult to identify the pizzas here.  On top of that, he was not friendly, did not smile and treated me as if he was annoyed with me rather than concerned about customer service and experience.
6. One young female employee (did not catch name) came around and checked on us.  If it wasn't for her, I would say the service is terrible.

My favorite for this type of build your own pizza has got to be Blaze, but Pizza Rev is not bad. You do get a choice of their regular thin crust (which they call single) or their thick crust (double) for the same price, where Blaze charges an extra $1 for their thick, but they don't have as many sauce or topping options as Blaze. I'd stay with the thin crust though; the thick tastes like a good supermarket frozen pizza, not a brick oven or wood fired pizza.

Their spicy sauce here is inconsistent. First try it was noticably spicy, second and third time no spice at all. They don't offer goat cheese, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, pesto and a few other toppings that I love on my pizza, but bc of the $6 deal on Tues, we do still come here even though it's not on our part of town.

Be aware though, lots of people come on Tues esp during lunch, so expect a long line, and a tough time finding parking. This plaza is very busy, as with everything else on this side of town! 

Pro tip: If parking is full, you can park on the street just behind Pizza Rev, or better yet, just go there first and skip all the nonsense in the parking lot altogether!",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,2,3,3,qeIxTdeXuM60k8DUbn1htw

Once I saw they were building PizzaRev down the road from my house. I was excited too see where PizzaRev would stack up with Pieology, The Pizza Kitchen, and Blaze (honest that one have not tried yet). The concept is really nothing different in all of them. It all in the details that separates each one. PizzaRev somethings that prefer over the rest but if talking about the food just ok. The positive thing is they serve BEER. Who not a fan of beer and pizza??They even serve draft beer!!! Not huge selection on tap but they also have different bottle beers. Pieology not sure if they serve beer I know draft no way and The Pizza Kitchen that negative. The interior has more of adult vibe if there such thing maybe because serve alcohol. Or the fact seems louder then the rest. The fountain machine is way cool one of those multi drinks ones that push button. The service I found was excellent. It was busy went right at peak lunch time so had a wait. Nothing too long of wait for line that nearly went out the front door. They also sell cookies by the cashier when you pay. Wish had room for because some of them looked tasty. 

The food I had regular dough (they do offer gluten free and double dough something they call it), tomato sauce, spicy pepperoni, sweet fennel sausage, jalapeño, and basil. The tomato sauce thought was pretty plain nothing stood out about it. The sweet fennel sausage that was winnah for sure!!! The toppings feel like the other places offer more of a selection choose from and when looking at the options not that look fresh fresh. The double double dough might be better then the regular. Try that theory out next visit.

Overall think PizzaRev is another great addition or option comes too create your own pie. Just if had choice would go to the other ones. If am in the area would stop by in minute get pizza fix in.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,2,3,gZRxwSD7XS--IvNo7ug3pA

The toppings are fresh and they have a wide variety which even includes capers. The line is usually long but moves fast. It is kind of like cafe rio or subway where you go down the line adding the items of your choice. The staff is always friendly and courteous.

To begin, the first person to help, Richard (I'm assuming a manager because of the collared shirt) asked me a question and didn't even listen to my answer. He was too busy panicking because the line got a little longer and was trying to keep his employees later. Why this was my problem, I don't know. I had to repeat myself twice because he wasn't paying attention. He pushes my food down to the next person, Kenny (also assumedly a manager, due to the collared shirt) who I had to repeat myself to several times as well because he was focused on the people walking in and talking to the employees around him to pay attention to the customer in front of him. My pizza looks like a mess as he throws the toppings all over the place. After he finishes my pizza, he goes to get a paprt towel to wipe his sweaty face... with his gloves still on! (Later we observe him wiping his nose with the edge of his glove-gross! And then pull up his pants with gloves and goes right back to putting toppings on pizza- that's just disgusting!) He then slides it down to the next person, didn't catch his name, but this one also socializing and ignoring me, I'm waiting for him to ask me what veggies I would like but he's doing everything else but helping me. Again, I'm repeating myself and I get moved along to the cashier who was perfectly fine and polite. We go to sit (at a dirty table, which I cleaned myself) and get called for our pizza shortly after. It's warm-ish. Not hot, yet a little burnt on one edge... ironic. The flavors are good. Love the spicy pepperoni and beef meatball crumble. Everything else is the same as Blaze and Pieology. A floor/bus person, Micah, checks on us, which is nice, but obviously hasn't been trained on how to clean. He wipes a table next to us with a napkin and flicks an olive off the table. All in all, the customer service was ridiculous. I work in the food industry and would never allow my employees to behave this way. If these guys are the managers, they are leading by a terrible example. We may come back in hopes that today was just a bad day, but I am just so disappointed.

-You choose either thin crust, or double crust dough (there's gluten free, too) and get to put whatever toppings you want.  They have a variety of red and white sauce.  And also olive oil.  They have around 30 toppings to choose from.  I think their dough is plain, and they should probably add something like garlic salt and/or more butter to their dough.

Kinda dirty and it seems like they were working on a couple kinks due to just opening because all the employees were wondering where the other employees were because they seemed short staffed. While we were paying for our pizza, I found it super unprofessional as the cashier was screaming across the line to the other employee about wanting to get a ""smoke break"" and they he was dying for a ""smoke break"".  :/
Details of the menu: 
A) 3 types of dough: regular- thin crust, double dough (recommended)- their regular crust is super thin, and their vegan dough ( isn't dough already vegan??!?!?!: flour, water, yeast and salt)- must ask them what makes it Vegas because that worries me what's in their regular one unless they are putting butter into the dough which is unusual for pizza dough
B) Sauces: Organic red sauce, white sauce/alfredo and some kinda green sauce- didnt ask whats in it
C- Choose your cheese: Regular (buffallo and mozerella), blue cheese, ricotta, feta and I believe goat cheese and vegan cheese
D) toppings: tons of meat options- 3 different kinds of pepperoni (regular-pro, spicy, and all beef), italian sausage, fennel sausage, meatballs, anchovies, ham, etc
E) veggies- all sorts with sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, spinach, roasted and minced garlic, onions-white and red, artichoke hearts and many more

***COOK time in oven is somewhere from 5-10min. NGL the pizza on the bottom and edges were burnt and it was really weird because I was watching the guy take the pizzas out and the spatula he was using (metal) was all crusted off at the end and already deteriorating- even he was weirded out by it because he spent a good 30 seconds just staring it. 

The reason for the 3 star rating is because I am comparing this to BLAZE PIZZA. Idk if I was just underwhelmed by the whole concept because i had seen it before (subway or chipotle style line-make your own custom style). As i bit into my custom made for me pizza I just didnt get the same satisfaction as when I did with Blaze. Maybe because the dough wasnt as tasty and neither was their sauce. I hate to say but i prefer BLAZE PIZZA.

As for other specials they had it was great. They have a full service bar with wine and beer (dont believe they have liquor). I saw they had a special for 4 pizzas and 4 beers for 40$.

Other than that, I do not ever wish to eat the pizza here. The crust is like a crappy pita that's been in a toaster oven too long. I've had better crackers. It makes a frozen pizza look gourmet.

I like the super thin crust and I personally like when it gets dark and a little burnt. Today's pizza came out exactly like that.

You can create your own or pick one from their menu.
Same price no matter the toppings. Sounds great huh? Well when the pizza was done cooking, the veggies were still raw and it was just really gross. The dough was so thin that loading more than two toppings makes it really heavy on top of a thing dough. FAIL!
It's a huge disappointment because like I said the concept is great and the look of the inside and outter building is visually appealing- but the food was gross.

In fact, I've only tried these type of pizza places twice before and been wildly unimpressed both times. We tried Novicento on Eastern years back (it has since closed) and 800 Degrees in the SLS Casino. Meh on both.

This place is different though. At PizzaRev..

a) they were friendly
b) they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings
c) they had one of those awesome Coke machines with all the flavors (I fucking love those things!)
d) they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings

Did I mention that they were not cheap as fuck with the toppings?? This was awesome and the result was a filling, tasty, and satisfying pie! 

I simply added pineapple and grilled chicken to my pie while my friend added sausage, ham, pepperoni, and feta cheese to his. We were both impressed with both the fresh flavor of the toppings in addition to the generous amounts added. 

Not only that, but unlimited toppings is just $7.99 a pie! Sweet! I can go for that!

Works! .........the girls kept looking at us as if why we don't hurry! And rushing us through the line and making remarks about it.....then I ask if they could sell me a side of meatballs and sauce and I got a look as if I was asking for something weird!

Back is how am I gonna charge you for them?! As if
I was asking for them to be given to me for free?!?! ......ummmm noooo!!' I said
It doesn't matter! Whatever it is! Then they are given to me stone cold and almost raw?!! Really???!! Wow  I
Couldn't believe it and I ask if he could heat them up for me, and again as if they hate when you ask for them to do something besides just putting ingredients on top of dough  .......there where about 14 of us you'll think they'll appreciate the business buying a lot and one of the girls is being rude to my sister claiming she had already given her. A side salad she kept waiting for and got there until we had almost finished with pizza and wouldn't want to give a dressing to go with it!!'

( plus it's closer to my house than Blaze). Toppings were good and they had organic items. A real pizza oven cooked the items nicely. I just have a couple of points that you may want to consider.

1. People don't know to order the salad WITH the pizza. I ( and several others that I heard while I was eating) ordered it at the end when checking out. Not sure if you have a better way to streamline that. ( with that being said, the Caesar Salad  was very good, better than Blaze)

2. You shouldn't have 20 types of hot sauce on hand  and no salt at all in the entire restaurant. We asked everyone ( even the manager) and learned that there was absolutely no salt at all in the building. Get some good salt ( Himalayan or sea salt or kosher or whatever) and have that on hand for your guests, please. I literally drove to Farmer Boys to get salt and came back to eat my pizza.

I got the craft your own pizza & chose: Double Dough, BBQ Sauce, Italian Cheese, Ricotta Cheese, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Crispy Bacon, Mushroom, & added Fresh Spinach after it was baked.

Although their pizza was good, I honestly wish I enjoyed it more.

I can't pin point what was wrong with it. The dough was soft, meats were good, they gave ample amount of each topping, and 1 pizza could definitely be shared between 2 people. But, there was something still missing... Like as if everything was a little bland for my taste buds. Nonetheless, it was good & I'm glad I got to try it.

The atmosphere is very chill & casual, and the employees were super nice & friendly.
Like all new things, opening day can be a little rough. But despite the cons above, I'd still give them another chance & hopefully my pizza will have more flavor next time.

I think they could benefit if the initial person who asks you how many pizzas you're ordering also asks if you've been there before. If it's your first time, they should explain how you order. 
Second, the dough sucks. Even with double dough, it was like eating a pizza on a tortilla.
The vegetable toppings should be sliced thinner so that they can cook. Because the crust is so thin, the vegetables end up partial cooked, especially the mushrooms.

My pizza was not in the oven nor on the line or in the box they tried to hand me.  They gave MY handcrafted (no bacon) pizza to someone in front of me.  Since my lunch break was nearly over, I just asked for a refund.  The cashier first asked for my credit card to apply the refund to, then he called someone else over, because he didn't know how to give a refund.  The second person, also did not know how to issue a refund and just reprinted my original receipt.  They eventually, ended up just giving me cash back.

My girlfriend has Celiacs so the entire appeal to PizzaRev was the fact that they offered gluten free.  I thought the price (of the pizza) was great, the idea of a deli style pizza place was novel, and the convenience was amazing.  Now that's about all the good I can say about this place.  The staff was for the most part rude as I heard an employee correct a guest on the guests name.  The gluten free pizza was average to say the least (it's difficult to do gluten free well so I give them a pass as it was edible and not terrible) however the cook burned them.  The staff did a great job with the allergy and I always feel bad as this slows the cooking lines down no matter the restaurant.  But as the line got more and more backed up, the employees seemed frantic and the service went out the window with it.  So alongside the gluten free pizza, I ordered a standard dough pizza for myself.  Mine (which took a fraction of the time) was done first and left in a box on the counter till the other was done (about 20 minutes).  The bottom was burnt pretty bad so I had a burnt, soggy and cold pizza.  The salad price point is ridiculous seeing as how fast food joints give a better salad for less price.  I'm not sure if it was this place or the terrible BWW I had earlier that day, but my stomach did not feel well all night.  The part that really got me though was this was a pickup order too, done before the dinner rush.  We gave the place 45 minutes and it still came 30 minutes late.  There were a few things done well, but for the most part this was a huge mess.

Different cheeses ranging from Italian blend to blue cheese or feta, different sauces like organic red sauce or white, different meats from your basic pepperoni to grilled chicken and of course lots of vegetables!

The workers behind the line seemed to just stare and pass along the pizza. Operations doesn't seem efficient as well. I'm glad we came when it was slower. I can only imagine how backed up they get during their rush. When the pizza was handed off to me the workers gave off a bothered vibe. They also seemed to be more concerned about personal matters and we're constantly talking amongst each other. 

There was a gentleman constantly in the lobby ""cleaning."" It would have been nice to see him clean the sneeze guard which was filthy. He kind of was just walking around pointlessly. 

A lot of choices for hot sauce which I'm assuming the ""rev"" comes from. Quality was okay and so were the portions. Plenty of toppings to choose from too. The red sauce was great but the white sauce was just a little bland. Nice variety of wine, beers and sodas. The restaurant itself has a nice layout. Honestly the food isn't that memorable.

Because the pizzas are good, it makes Pizza day amazing! :)

The trick is not to get too many toppings, even though you can get unlimited toppings. 
If you get too many toppings, it weighs down the pizza and ends up being soggy. 
I would say, don't get more than 3-4 toppings. 

Disclaimer, if it's too busy, they might hurry the process and the sauce/cheese/topping ratio gets inconsistent. For example, the cheese may not cover the sauce, the toppings end up in the middle, or the as it's put in the box, the toppings slide more to one side of the pizza.

This particular location is located in a plaza, so you do have variety on what to eat, but none of the other places had pizza on their menu, it's also not too far away from the shopping center off of Rainbow, so if your looking to eat before you shop they this is your place to hit up when your craving some pizza. I do enjoy the Alfredo sauce option for your sauce choice. I get it all the time and add my veggies, it's as if I am eating pasta but instead of the noodles I have pizza dough.
So I would recommend this place if your looking for something unique, because you can definitely add as many topping as you like or purchase a creation on their menu. My favorite toppings are artichoke,spinach,olives, and peppers.

The employees are friendly, but they seemed a little scattered when it comes to organization. It's cohesion that is key and when I walked in with my family it was a little after 2pm still pretty busy but the wait to get a pizza made took 10-15 then another 10-15 to get your pizza. The dough was decent, I wish they cooked it a little longer to fully get the dough cooked. It was a little flimsy closer toward the middle. My biggest complaint for this is my sister had placed an online to go order as we sat down and it took about 25 mins to get the order when they weren't busy any longer. When my sister approached the register to ask about her to go order the employee walked away and about 5 mins later she noticed they hadn't made the pizza though the app said it was boxed and ready! I found it terrible service that they didn't have a response as to why the pizza wasn't ready yet! Bad customer service and to have wasted 25 mins after eating our meal to wait for an online order we had placed at that time 35 mins before was terrible!

Today I was especially impressed. The staff was super friendly and welcoming upon arrival and they got our pizza out in a timely fashion.

It was clear they were having a very difficult time making it from the car into pizza rev. Upon seeing this struggle, a few of the staff members ran out to help and literally helped walk the woman in by holding her up and supporting her. They sat her down at a table and then brought her a menu so that she wouldn't have to go through the line and told her they would bring the pizza out to her.

I had a question about the salad sizes or if there was multiple sizes and the older red head woman was very snotty regarding my question and let me know there is only one size.  

The next employee I had a problem with was the very very tall gentleman with long dark hair. He was working to the right of the woman taking the orders. He asked me if I wanted any Parmesan cheese on my salad and I asked for a little bit. He was also very snotty and picked up the tiniest pinch of cheese and just threw it on my salad. Not amused kid.

Everyone else in the line was just screaming and making annoying whale-moaning sounds every time someone would walk in. A simple welcome in or welcome to pizza rev would have sufficed.

There is a tiny bar section where employees eat pizza on their breaks I assume. But they continue to yell out order names while they eat their pizzas. Just let them take their break!!

The ONLY saving grace this shop has is an employee named Micah. Very sweet guy working the dining area offered to get us boxes and tidy up our table. A+ customer service from him!

The sauce tastes canned and the cheese tastes processed. I think Pieology is better and The Pizza Kitchen is even better. The ingredients at those two places are fresher and the dough and sauce taste homemade. 

I really had high hopes for Pizza Rev opening in the area but the whole fire baked flavor just isn't' there. The pizza got cold very fast and could use an extra 20 sec. 

I think the management needs to work on the staff and their knowledge of the product and customer service skills.  I think they also need to figure out how to make fresh dough and sauce. There is a lot of competition in this market and they will sink quickly.

I like the fact that you are able to build your own pizza, and choose every single ingredient even down to the crust.

I ordered the classic pizza and added olives and mushrooms, the taste was really fresh and the pizza overall had really good flavor. 

I was making plans to maybe order another pizza since I thought it wasn't going to fill me up but I have to say that I was really surprised, not only did it fill me up but I was rather full for a while since it was really filling.

The dough, which I got ""double thick"" on a margherita base was about as thin as a frozen tombstone pizza, with about as much flavor. 

The sauce didn't stand out as anything special which is why they offer you a dozen different bottles of hot sauce with which you are supposed to ""rev"" up your pizza.

They have about 40 ingredients to pile on and doctor up the mediocrity. I usually create an un-harmonious mix at these joints because I'll eat anything but this time I used restraint and went with some meat, ricotta and sun-dried tomatoes.

If you've ever been to Pieology, it's very similar. If you've never been to Pieology, then it's very similar to how Chipotle runs.. and if you've never been to Chipotle... well then I don't know what to tell you.

Anyways, you have basically 3 options from the menu. You can: 1) make your own with unlimited toppings 2) select a cheese pizza or 3) choose one of their pre-selected pizzas.

I went with my fiancé and of course we chose the unlimited toppings! I don't eat any pork, so I chose chicken as my meat. I lathered on Alfredo sauce and covered that bad boy in a bunch of veggies. The 'za didn't take long to bake, but I was fairly disappointed. I wanted all my toppings to be melted in and the mushrooms were that over cooked, squishy texture that I love. We ordered a side salad, which to be honest... could have been it's own meal by itself (KUDOS for that!) but it was simple.

I do have to say I love the decor and that they have a little bar you can sit at. Oh! Did I forget to mention they serve beer? Who doesn't love beer and pizza?! (Unless you're under 21, then that's a no to you, you youngins!)

5902771,2016-11-11,2,CtZ3HujCLTChyoad_L-nHA,"I'm kind of torn about this place. There's good and bad, but the bad is really a deal breaker.

THE GOOD:
The place is cutely decorated, the staff was friendly, the ingredients seemed fresh and they even catered to vegans. The prices are also pretty reasonable for a personal pizza with unlimited toppings, and the pizza comes out super cute and Insta-worthy.

It's everything I want in a restaurant except, you know, the bland tasting food.

THE BAD: 
I know what you're thinking, it's a personal pizza place. If I didn't like what I got, it's because I built it wrong, right? But the problems with the food were the fundamental parts like the crust, the sauce taste, and how how they cooked it.

STRIKE 1:
The pizza crust is flattened with a machine. It's pretty common practice in personal pizza joints since it probably keeps prices down and it's fast, but it's not as good as hand-tossed. It lacks the right texture, and basically becomes a cracker.

STRIKE 2:
The sauces, both white and red, were very bland but somehow distinct (and not in a good way). It tasted like it straight out came from a Ragu jar. Not even the immense amount of garlic, spices, cheese, and toppings could mask the taste.

STRIKE 3:
Lastly, when it was time for baking, the process left the bottom of my pizza crisp and burnt, but my mushroom toppings still raw. I'm sure it's hard to formulate the perfect time for all the pizzas, but it's not quite perfect. It half-assed both when it should've full-assed the crust. If the toppings were skinnier, it could've done both. Instead, it did neither.

OVERALL: 2.5/5 
They have decent pricing, great service, and a nice environment. I really don't like the food though. For two people at a normal pizza joint, it's the same price for a large, hand-tossed, cheese pizza. And it may not have as many toppings, but toppings, arguably, do not make a good pizza.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,6,2,3,mgmJIN74moU8_7JtyOmdKA
