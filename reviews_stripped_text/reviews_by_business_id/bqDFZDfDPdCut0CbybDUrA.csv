The real treat was on my second visit I asked for Angel Hair pasta, Arrabbiata style, and specifically requested it to be as spicy as humanly possible.  The chef pulled it off marvelously, it was perfectly spicy to my high Scoville-unit  tastes and quite delicious.",ms8dOfaNO3VnAMKEnnuOqQ,1,1,5,Q_BnJ9VgroYpN5otBZf8qw

We sent one entree back, the ceasar salad just had a couple of anchovies laid on top instead of in the dressing as it should be, the garlic bread (two little tiny thin slices of little tiny bread) served with the ceasar was HARD. And no bread served with the entrees! Dinner for 4 with waters to drink - more than $120.00 This should be against the law.",ZSroGt70RlcrYG3LSJuKkA,0,0,2,Z59BnjQPregRDKqYADN17Q

The lasagne is to die for like my grandma use to make  and minestrone soup has the best flavor doesn't need cheese.  my best friend had shrimp diavlo was amazing and the chef will make it as bland or spicy as you like.  There wine list was impressive brunello and barolo.   all pasta is homemade and you can tell from the intricately shaped macaroni and fresh taste its not boxed barilla pasta that most restaurants use.  
the portions were so large i didn't have room for dessert next time I'm trying the panicotta.  pete was our waiter he was wonderful felt like i knew him for years.  great restaurant for a remodeled casino  see you soon pete thanks for the doggy bag",KOVsxUf8VJFPpMCzI615dw,3,0,5,IaRZXaXKCGznKY6V3BhvPw
133979,2016-10-12,0,bqDFZDfDPdCut0CbybDUrA,"Sometimes dining alone is annoying! Because I'm single... and dressed for air travel, the hostess automatically seated me in the bar area next to a giant TV. After about five minutes, I couldn't take it anymore and asked to be moved to a quieter less in ur face table in the restaurant. Despite the restaurant being empty, because it was so early, I was relocated in the hallway on patio chairs instead of the restaurant. Kind of bullshit. I just want a good meal in a nice, quiet restaurant. Is that too much to ask? Or is it too distracting to have a girl dining alone in a semi fancy restaurant? 

Needless to say, because I was sitting in the hallway, I did not have a server. The manager or chef did not come over. My table was not comfortable. I was not offered fresh parm or pepper. I did not have waitstaff checking on me. I was basically ignored the entire meal. Meanwhile, the patrons seated in he restaurant were catered to. Offered water, coffee, a second beverage etc... if I am paying the same price for my meal as the people seated in the restaurant I deserve to be treated the same way! If you are seated in this no man's land. Ask to be moved. The chairs are the worst! I have better chairs on my deck. Hell. There are better chairs at the pool upstairs.

On to the food-
Chicken Piccata- or should I say chicken nada! First, I'm not sure if the chef understands what piccata is. Not only is this chicken on the bone... which is NOT how you make piccata. A piccata is a sliced lightly floured fillet which has been tenderized and sautéed in a lemon based stock. (Just a personal note: Having the bone sticking up like that, looks thoroughly unappetizing.)  Piccata should be a light delicate and tender piece of meat, which should melt in your mouth. The chicken at Fresco was on the bone, tough, not floured, and had no note of lemon whatsoever. Hello... One of the main ingredients of any piccata is lemon chef! Instead, the chicken was lightly dressed with a flavorless stock rue, caramelized onions, three capers and four green olives. 

The sauce on the chicken had zero flavor, but did manage to leave me with a heavy butter residue in my mouth. The dish was served with noodles which were also heavily soaked in butter (or perhaps that fake liquid butter byproduct). Although the pasta was probably freshly frozen, it had the look, taste, and mouth feel of cheap ramen. I don't know about you, but when I come to an Italian restaurant, the last thing I want to eat is reconstituted ramen. 

At the end of the day, I'm not sure who prepared this dish, but who ever did, doesn't know what piccata is. I think this is   probably one of the worst renditions of piccata I have ever eaten. (And I have eaten a lot of piccata). If you are going to charge $26 for a dish, you should at least prepare something that resembles an actual piccata instead of butter drenched ramen noodles.

While I was sitting here, I had to ask myself who is rating this place 4 stars? Although their wine list was good, and the bartenders were super nice, the food was subpar at best- especially for the price. The reviewers of this restaurant must not know much about fresh, good quality food. 

One final note, as a woman who often travels (and eats) alone, I don't appreciate being seated in the bar next to a giant TV. I don't appreciate not being seated with the rest of the patrons in the dining room. I didn't appreciate that no one checked on me throughout the meal. And I certainly didn't appreciate being charged the same fine dining price for a subpar experience. The only reason I rated this location 2 stars instead of 1 is because the wine selection was good, the bartenders were very accommodating and nice and the restaurant had a decent ambiance. Otherwise I would say this was a thoroughly unenjoyable experience and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone I know.",q9jZUebCdCEOXYPsuTdVJQ,9,0,2,gqe-85tX6PTbBd_3rXpNRQ

1661642,2017-10-30,8,bqDFZDfDPdCut0CbybDUrA,"I have never in my 60+ years been kicked out of a restaurant, that is until Fresco Italiano! My business partner and I were looking forward to a staycation at the Westgate, as we need to be available 24-7 for our educational internet business, and taking an overnight stay is a big deal for us, and requires a lot of planning ahead. We ordered 3 courses to share, and were looking forward to them, as it was after 6, and we hadn't had a chance to eat all day. 

As we were waiting for our meal, we were served stale bread made of whole grains, of which I am allergic. I am Italian in the strictest sense of upbringing, and NEVER did our family serve anything but a good crusty white Italian bread. OK, not a big deal, still excited about our food to come.

One of the waitresses was wearing a political T-shirt, and we found it offensive as she passed our table several times. Does politics need to enter your dining experience while on vacation? Is there any place you can go to relax, and forget about the political climate? Apparently not, at Fresco Italiano. Both of us were stunned that she would be permitted to dress this way at work. Are there no dress code rules anymore? At Fresco Italiano, it seems OK by management that their staff display political statements on their tees.

We asked for the manager to discuss the fact that her waitress was being inappropriate, and that it made us uncomfortable. Just wanted to let her know that, so they may consider the fact that they are offending some of  their customers, and to possibly change their dress policy. What we got was totally unexpected. The manager, who couldn't have been more than 25 years old, the offending waitress, and a large, threatening thug appeared at our table all at once. All this, for two old ladies! What we got was defensive arguments, and we were told to leave if we didn't like it. Expletives were exchanged! We were told F you! At that point, we just left, not to cause any escalation. 

Btw, I want to say that I would not have had a bad reaction to a patron of the restaurant wearing a shirt that promoted a political agenda. I see that all the time, whether it is a bumper sticker, a  hat, or a t-shirt. But when people who work at a place are putting their agenda in my face as a customer, I feel intimidated, uncomfortable, and possibly threatened. 

 For instance, now I'd better be careful what I say as someone in management could overhear, and deliver consequences in my meal, perhaps without me ever knowing (got to check that meal carefully before eating!)Seeing people constantly having violence done to them, in public for expressing their views is the norm now, and has made possible feelings like mine, and experiences like this. I'm writing to the President of Westgate next.

So, watch out about your politics here. If you are a Republican, you will be discriminated against, and hated on for your political beliefs.",kuWK4fvB_HkT-rNpfoj4aQ,3,2,1,v4AhBySQ9eUE8WZqyOtYGA

1952369,2016-08-21,0,bqDFZDfDPdCut0CbybDUrA,"This place was just one disappointment after another. First off, they have a very limited lunch menu. I'm one of those that always check out the menu and have in mind what I wanted to order before going to a restaurant and when we sat down and was handed the menu, we really wanted to jump up and leave ... we should have.

My boyfriend couldn't decide what he wanted and he finally decided on the fettucine and the waiter was like, nah, you don't want that, you want the spaghetti and meatballs. So fine, we agreed... what a huge mistake... the sauce was watery and the meatballs were dry that my boyfriend couldn't even eat it. 

When we told the waiter hey, FYI, you may want to recommend something else to your patrons next time because this was not good. The waiter (Joseph, I think), instead of being apologetic was like ""well, everyone else likes it."" Really??!!! Why are you so defensive, it's not like you cooked the meatballs! 

So, we swear we would never go back but unfortunately we were invited to a birthday dinner and that was the place the birthday boy wanted to go. We didn't want to ruin it for him and maybe the second time would be better... WRONG.

We walked in and get seated and guess who our server is... Joseph or whatever his name was...bald guy from Chicago. The reason why I know it's the bald guy from Chicago because as soon as he found out that we were from Sacramento, CA all he wanted to talk about was how far our Giants was going to get vs his Chicago Cubs. We asked for water 5 times and the dude was too busy talking (spitting too, may I add) about who we got and who his team has...Mistake #1

Also, instead of getting our water, he wanted to comment on my shirt by saying, ""oh you like Michael Jackson"" as he does the hip forward head back Jackson move. I'm like, I'm wearing a Barrett Jackson shirt which has nothing to do with Michael Jackson. In my mind I really wanted to say, ""Why don't you just do your job and bring us our water that we have been waiting for for like 1/2 hour now."" But I refrain because we haven't received our food yet either and you don't want to pisst off your waiter before you get your food... Mistake #2

Then he brings us bottled water which none of us asked for. He brought us 5 bottles and none of us like bubbly water. We just want regular water. We were like, hey, we didn't order so we ain't paying for it. He said fine, he's got it covered. We left three bottles untouched but the cap was open...I hope he doesn't serve it to another table...that was mistake #3.

Mistake #4, one of our friends ordered a bread appetizer for herself, he somehow dediced to bring out four orders for the entire table and charged. 

Dinner dishes were a hit and miss. Mine was good but I ordered it off the menu. Apparently, even though they have not been open for very long, they have already changed their menu. A lot of the things that you see on Yelp, they do not have on their menu anymore. Several of our friends did not finish their dishes because they said it was very bland. 

If you want to gamble (pun intended) and hope you get a professional waiter or order the good dish, by all means, give it a try, otherwise, I would put my $$ elsewhere.",-X5nuDjTcfWeUoR1vfWA1Q,7,1,1,PXDb8_h7XDRcYbGXmknM6g

Our waitress was super sweet and attentive! I think her name was Rebecca.

We ordered the classic bruschetta which was absolutely amazing! The bread they serve with oil and balsamic to dip was so good and authentic Italian style!

I ordered gnocchi with their spicy marinara. Typically, I have low expectations on the ""spicy"" scale, especially at an Italian restaurant, but boy was it spicy! It was so good!

If you really have to settle with chicken, between the two I would suggest the Marsala. If you don't mind getting anything, you can try the veal chop because hubby and his friend agreed the veal was delicious here. If you can't decide, just get the flatbread.

2472756,2016-12-08,0,bqDFZDfDPdCut0CbybDUrA,"What a disappointment! Until last night, I have never had a truly bad meal in Las Vegas. We have visited many, many times for business as well as pleasure and this was awful. 
We asked for 7 pm reservation and told the ""earliest seating for six people would be 7:30."" Yet, when we arrived the restaurant was not even half full. 
We tried so very hard to order a bottle of wine, yet every selection was not available. After the server's third unsuccessful trip, we asked ""what do you have?"" and chose his suggestion. Yet, even that was unavailable. It should not take five trips (and almost 45 minutes) to get a bottle of wine! Adding insult to injury, the guy who poured the wine mentioned a special on a good quality wine (less expensive than what we ordered) and said we should have ordered that! Of course, by then it was too late. 
Finally, we ordered food and the disappointment continued. Very slow kitchen and awful results: rare steak was medium well; medium rare steak was done to shoe leather texture; spaghetti and meatballs was missing the meatballs; risotto was cold;  minestrone was bland; chicken piccata was not piccata cutlet style but chicken on the bone; and request for freshly ground pepper on salad was met with a finger pointing to pepper on the table.  I sent my steak back and said take it off the bill and opted to skip dinner. Didn't have much hope for anything better based on my companions' results.
The final straw was the 20% gratuity automatically added since we were a ""large party."" Six people is ""large?"" And there were only five entrees since I did not eat! 
The ONLY good thing to say about the place is that it is convenient if you are a Westgate guest. Otherwise, take the monorail, walk, take an Uber/Lyft/cab, or whatever and and go anywhere else!

We had the pesto grilled baguette to start which was crunchy and flavorful. Next the homemade meatball (Chef's family recipe from Italy); they were super delicate (huge) and covered with a tangy marinara sauce. Then the calamari..I've been kinda burned out on calamari because we order it so often, but this was fantastic. The batter had a new spice blend, was light and crunchy and the tarragon garlic aioli was superb. Then we shared the chopped salad (HUGE). Great textures, flavors and quality ingredients! I'm not a big salad fan, so to rave about lettuce speaks volumes. For entrees we had the branzino stuffed with San marzano tomatoes and on a bed of bitter greens; super flaky and served in a really cute cast iron fish and a 22 oz bone in rib eye. (seasoned perfectly and cooked as ordered).
We managed to finish with the banana peanut butter gelato before we had to waddle out of there. Great night and wonderful experience. They also have a wood burning oven, we'll have to try the flatbread/pizzas when we go back! Wish they were open for lunch!

Chef surprised us with flat bread made with lardo and pig jowl.  I wish I would've got a picture of it because it was as appealing visually as it was on the palate.

2789308,2018-06-24,1,bqDFZDfDPdCut0CbybDUrA,"I ate here w a friend after we worked all day and we were really excited to have Italian food. I have spent a lot of time in Italy and so has my friend (she is married to an Italian) and we all know standards of good food. We ordered two appetizers: fried mozzarella and a chop salad. The mozzarella was not warm, not fully cooked and the marinara was watery and lacking flavor. The chop salad was just chopped iceburg lettuce with overly tossed vinegary Italian dressing...with only one piece of arugula and a tiny piece of radicchio. It was bland. But we were still hopeful and politely excused their preparations, looking forward to our main courses.

 I order chicken parm and my friend ordered linguine with clams. The first bite of my chicken parm made my stomach hurt, which was strange as I eat and make chicken parm all of the time. I had my friend try it and she said it was probably from the super thick soggy breading that wasn't cooked through on the over cooked piece of chicken. The spaghetti noodles were all over cooked and broken and the sauce was not flavored, watery (again) and just really not up to standards for the price is cost. How can they charge full price and cut corners on product by extending its use by diluting it?!

My friend's review of the linguini and clams were that her noodles were also morosely overcooked to the point of breaking into tiny pieces as the forked searched for a place to lift the soggy pile. The creamy (what?) sauce had no essence of clam juice nor any flavor of any sort ... creamy water has never been on anyone's list of being palatable especially involving seafood. She really tried to give the clams a chance proclaiming ""at least there is no sand."" But as her chewing continued on and on she she said ""I can't. I have to send this dish back."" 

When I tasted the linguine she was right, it was also over cooked and completely broken. No Long noodles, they were all one inch. The clams were over cooked and inedible . The sauce was just cooked wine with no flavor at all. We sent both meals back.

We told the waitress (who was very helpful and kind) of our issue and she brought the manager (Dora?) who tried to intimidate us by bringing over a chef who seemed confused why she was even there. We politely and discreetly as possible told her how terrible the food was and that we could not consume it. (Serious warning this is the type of place you would potentially become ill). The manager then tried to tell us that egg based noodles just cook that way and that we should understand since she is Italian. (How could she be making such a disgrace of her wonderful culture). I spent years traveling back and forth from Tuscany and never have I had such terrible noodles. I definitely never had a meal make me sick as soon as I took a bite of it. After arguing with her for a few minutes and her acting condescending towards us, the manager said she would fix it and walked away. We sat for half an hour with the plates of food still piled cold in front of us and no one returning to our table.

Finally the server asked what was going on and we shrugged our shoulders and she returned with our bill charging us for everything, full price!! We said the manager mentioned ""taking care of it."" Off she went leaving us for even longer. We never saw the manager again but it certainly became a big deal for the server leaving service to the kitchen to negotiate on our behalf. 

When we were about to leave a generous 25% tip for her original patience and kindness on the table and just leave, the waitress returned with only one entree removed from the bill which we swiftly and  reluctantly paid. It was such an awful experience minus the waitress, she was great.

They called and asked if we were going to show up on time and that they could only sit 5 people (with). Anyways a friend of hers who works at the hotel got it fix for us and made the reservation for 9. We arrived and about ten minutes after we got seated. Our waitress name was Kimber. She greeted us , took our drink order and then a few minutes later came back to take our food order. First thing to come out were our two calamari appetizers, very delicious. Cannot say anything bad about that. Our entree's arrived and the portions were a good size. I had their spicy shrimp pasta sorry forgot what it was called, ugh so disappointed. Yes there was a little spice in it but over all super lack of flavor and let me just say I do not cook with salt. I had to add a lot of black pepper and some salt to it to make it edible. Not to mentioned I asked our waitress for some extra parmesan cheese. The pasta was very undercook and just was not good at all. My sister had the angel hair pasta with a white sauce and she enjoyed it very much. My cousin had the lasagna and she said it was delicious. My mother had their Fettucini Alfredo and she hated it. She said it was not good and lacked flavor. Same with the spaghetti and meatballs. Then to top it off, our server placed olive oil and vinegar in plates for our complimentary bread that we never received. We asked for it twice and for what ever reason we never got it. Our waters were room temperature and never got refills. Then our waitress brought my sister a piece of cake for her birthday and she just placed it on the table and said ""Happy Birthday"" then walked away. Not a  1,2,3 Happy Birthday lets sing or hey everyone lets all greet her.. nope Nothing, Over all I will never be coming back to this place especially not for the price. My bill for 1 glass of wine, 1 flat bread pizza and my pasta came out to $65. I do not care how much food cost, but as long as I enjoy it.

We had the bruschetta for an appetizer and it was very tasty. We got there early so our food came out fast. We had fettuccini Alfredo, shrimp scampi, and some kind of fish. I can't remember what the fish was called. But let me tell you about that fish, it was huge, like the size of a shark! It was so perfectly prepared and cooked, I would definitely order it again. I did not taste the fettuccine Alfredo because I am not a fan of cream sauce, but the kids and my mom enjoyed it. My shrimp scampi was amazing. It came with angel hair pasta and some prawns as well. The prawns were so sweet and went perfectly with the dish. 

One thing that amazed me about this place was that they make their own pasta! It was so buttery smooth and wasn't all stuck together like most places.

Went with a group just before Christmas and the usually pleasant atmosphere was very lacking in energy. Got a waitress who was efficient enough but not in the least bit cheerful. (Maybe we're just spoiled by Pete and Joe). 

When we requested bread, we were informed by Lady Stoneface that they were out of the complimentary bread but that garlic bread was available for an additional charge.

Oh, no! At that point the garlic bread should have become complimentary. Don't know whether to pin that on her or management, but shame on somebody for lack of customer service. Still, overall the food was pretty good.

So, we returned last week, and this time got Pete so service was good again, but I don't know who was manning the kitchen. It had to be someone either really cheap or really skinny, because the portion sizes were about half of normal. They used to serve big, juicy chicken breasts but these were more like fingers with a wing attached. And what happened to  the eggplant parmesan? The FDA requirements for listing ingredients by volume would have required this dish to be renamed ""Wedge of Baked Polenta with a Skimpy Eggplant Filling- and don't expect any cheese!""  Yikes! 

How did it all go so wrong so quickly? Three stars because Pete is great and I think the food tasted ok but there was so little it was hard to judge. Back to the Bootlegger.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,1,0,3,bsZQBMleH9dtPBuhilO60g

The firto misto was good but I would have liked it cooked a bit more to a more brown exterior than the lightly fried we got.  The agnolotti was very good.  The texture of the pistachip pieces with the soft agnolotti was a wonderful contrast and it was a really good dish.

For dessert, my dining partner got the Elvis gelato--banana, peanut butter flavors.  I tried a bit and got a good peanut butter taste.  For me, I got the cannoli which are house made.

This was our first visit to Fresco Italiano and it WILL NOT be our last!  I've tried many an Italian restaurants in Vegas and this is tops!  We visited in April 2016 for our first time and let me tell you, it was fantastic!

I'm going to start with the atmosphere.  We sat in a private room, a separate room just off the main dining area.  The main dining area was clean, well lit and a nice open room with plenty of seating.  No complaints on the atmosphere.  Perfect for a romantic night out with the significant other or a great spot to take the family for an authentic Italian meal!  Our private room was the perfect setting for our night out.  Nice touch!!

For our meal, we started with the bruschetta and it was delicious!  Then we moved on to an appetizer of fried lobster.   OMG, goodness.  You cannot go wrong with these appetizers!

Then me and the wife split 2 main dishes, we had spaghetti and meatballs and a petit filet mignon.  Let me tell you, freshness at it's finest.  The filet was so soft you could cut it with a fork!  It was also served with a butter to top the steak, holy moly...WOW!  I know Chef Mike and his staff use only the finest ingredients, you could really taste the difference! 

Overall an A+ experience.  We got a bottle of red wine to compliment our meal and I felt like it was priced perfectly.  Some of the reviews mention it's overpriced for what you get.  I'm calling shenanigans!  This is Vegas folks.  You get what you pay for.  You want to spend $20 for a steak, well, expect to get a $20 steak!

We ended up closing the restaurant as we were the last patrons in the establishment.  The restaurant was not too busy being it was a Tuesday night, so we even got paid a visit by the Executive Chef Mike!  He wanted to make sure our visit was up to the standards that he expects from his staff and rest assured, it EXCEEDED those expectations.  That was a nice touch!  The hostess was extremely pleasant, our server was there for our every need, and obviously the kitchen staff was phenomenal!  It's not so often you get paid a visit by the Executive Chef and it was a nice touch!

My recommendation, definitely pay it a visit!  You will not be disappointed!  Atmosphere = Great, Food = Great, Priced = Right!",91wcmjE3fKiUzAl47YsTpA,1,0,5,pUUK8S0SuLgkhCbQC2sE8g

The food: Bland. No other word can accurately describe my meal. Under the recommendation of the bartender, I ordered the Chicken Burrata. The service was lackadaisical but he drink was rest, so I didn't mind. 

When my fish arrived, it looked tasty. Lightly breaded, crispy, and served on a fresh tomato sauce with Burrata sandwiches in between. Looked good. The flavor however was seriously lacking salt, depth, and desire to eat more. After two -three bites, I couldn't finish.

We made a reservation but when we arrived realized we didn't actually need one, because for a Saturday night, it wasn't busy at all. We were greeted by a very nice waiter (who later disappeared and was replaced by a series of wait staff and manager...?). We ordered the classic Bruschetta, my daughter the Risotto (she's 12, never had it so had questions which our waiter kindly answered). My husband had The Filet and I just wanted wanted a simple salad and minestrone soup. They didn't have minestrone so they offered a creamy potato instead. The bruschetta was delicious! Once again the 12year old had never had it. She loooved it and managed to have two servings, along with the bread they brought to the table. OK here's what I wasn't impressed with...I didn't want wine to start with and asked to leave the drink list. They took it away along with some dishes and never again asked if I wanted a drink (I had water). The salad was huge, and looked fresh but I couldn't eat it. It was drowning in balsamic vinegar. I love balsamic vinegar, and dressing in general, but this was too much. They took it away (by this point our waiter was gone) but never apologized. They weren't rude, just never acknowledged the salad issue. My husband thought his filet was incredible, and my daughter found a new dish to order by enjoying the risotto. My potato soup, in a beautiful Italian designed bowl, was very good and not too heavy. We ordered the cannoli for dessert. They were good, not great. Shells were too thick to bite into with braces. I think 3 people came to the table to ask how things were. I didn't know who was the waiter, manager, what happened to our waiter. It was confusing. So all in all, food that was good was VERY good.

We came here for dinner with friends. We saw great marketing for this place. We wanted to give it a try. The night was disappointing because we ordered a caprese salad to find out there's no mozarella in the salad. 

We asked for draft beer. They apparently have a list of draft beer... But don't serve it.

We ordered our food. It was amazing. It definitely made up for the service we received from the waitress, who was rude and not at all attentive. 

The seafood risotto is by far, the best I ever tasted. Their handmade pasta noodles is perfect. Their penne Bolognese is good, as well as their lasagna. 

When it came to ordering dessert, I ordered a dinner special where it was $19.99 for pasta and gelato. I wanted the hazelnut. I was disappointed to hear I got only one option for gelato. That was not made clear on the advertisement. When we asked the waitress, she argued with us telling us we were wrong and just didn't read the menu and advertisement correctly. We were fine and decided to offer an advice of make it known that the special is for one flavor of gelato. She said yes it was clear and we just didn't see it. 

We also said mention on the menu that it is one scoop of gelato rather than the normal three scoop portion. She told us it is all on the menu and we just didn't see it. At that point, we got frustrated because we were telling her what we saw and interpreted from their ad. If seven adults got it wrong, then there must be something wrong with the wording or wasn't clear. We were offering our advice of what wasn't made clear. 

She actually RAISED her voice at us and told us it was clear and there's nothing wrong with the menu. She said it clearly read house gelato and they reserve the right to pick what it was. That's fine... Just make it clear on the menu. She fought with us all.

She finally conceded and said in a very condescending tone, ""You know, you're right. The customer is always right."" We went and complained to the manager because we were so irritated with her, her lack of service, her lack of professionalism, and lack of manners. He was apologetic and comped us which was nice but not needed.
