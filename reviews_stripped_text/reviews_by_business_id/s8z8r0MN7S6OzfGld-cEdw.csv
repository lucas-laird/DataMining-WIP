The menu seemed to try to hard, concentrating on small plates and fusion, rather than American fare like the original menu. I must say the drinks were great and a fare price. My wife and my cocktails were only $10 bucks a piece. We had popcorn shrimp, cucumber salad, fois gras (which was seared, but near frozen cold), kobe sliders(not good) and we split the Filet entree, which was not worth it, based on the flavor. The side of mash tasted a day old. The service was ""OK"", but based on the pricing and the new small plate menu, I rather go out for tapas.",GQi2XZRqjsd_cfui6_o-Ww,0,0,3,yt6icB18biuMY-zkgsI69Q

Fun fact: did you know that Marcel from Top Chef works here? Granted, this was in November and turnover at Vegas restaurants is so high that may no longer be the case...but still.

As I mentioned, our service was very poor. Our server did not acknowledge us for almost 20 minutes and when they finally took our drink order the bar was out of the ingredients to make two of the three drinks at the table. 

The manager did buy our drinks for us and even escorted us directly into LAX for our troubles.

The food was this places saving grace. With chef Adam Sobel and some of the other great line chefs of the area poached from other restaurants, I'd expect nothing less.

2723241,2008-12-07,3,s8z8r0MN7S6OzfGld-cEdw,"This was my second time dining at Company. And unfortunately, it will probably be the last. Maybe that's not fair. I'll explain.

I first dined at Company back in June. My party of six was seated by a waiter and looked after very attentively by three support servers clad all black pants, collared shirts and aprons. I felt a little under-dressed. The menu was upscale comfort food. My friend Katie gave me part of her delicious lobster BLT. My friend Colton gave me two spoonfuls of deliciously creamy mashed potatoes and the best creamed spinach I have ever had. I had the special that night, which was the jambalaya. It was fantastic. And there was so much of it, I couldn't even finish it all. Overall, I had a great experience and vowed to return.

Over Thanksgiving weekend, I found out that a friend and I  would be staying at the Luxor for the Criss Angel show Believe (see that review before you go). I quickly made reservations for Company. I couldn't wait to show off this place that I ""knew"". And I wore a jacket and nice shoes this time too. 

The restaurant looked exactly the same as it did in June. Only now the waiters were clad in black t-shirts that had the word ""Company"" silkscreened across them. The very friendly waiter asked if I had dined here before. I proudly told him ""Yes. Last June."" To which he said ""Oh. So you were here before our concept change."" Concept change? Uh boy. He continued his rotely memorized patter ""What our concept is now is that we take classic Western dishes and we combine them with Eastern ingredients to deliver small tasting plates with great variety."" My heart and stomach sank. ""So this is like an East/West tapas menu? Right?"" To which he said ""I'm glad you said that. That's a very good way of describing it."" I checked in with my friend. It wasn't a deal breaker for him. So we soldiered on.

The menu is divided into four sections: Sea, Sky, Land and Earth. We both ordered an item from each category.

SEA: Seared Tuna w/ lemon, olive oil, wasabi greens - There was so little of this dish, I barely remember it.
Lumb Crab Gratin w/shitake mushroom, bacon, leek and cotija cheese- This was really good. I'd like another portion of this. And to top it off, it was served in the same cast iron gratin dish that they used to serve the creamed spinach in. WHERE ARE YOU CREAMED SPINACH?

SKY: Organic Duck Confit Potstickers- They were okay. I've never understood why you would hide duck confit in a potsticker that you are going to dip in a sauce.
Chicken Breast w/mushroom ragout- The Eleanor Rigby  of this menu

LAND: SoHo Kobe Beef Slider- Very good. But their current prevalence on so many gastropub menus didn't make me feel like it was anything terribly special. 
Filet of Beef w/brandy cream and melted leek- Good. Not really sure what a melted leek is though, either before or after I ate it.

EARTH: Gruyere Cheese Puffs w/chive creme fraiche and lobster oil- On the dry side. This was the one dish that remained the longest on the table due to neither of us fighting over it.
Chili Garlic Asparagus- Really good. Strands of baby asparagus. Glad it came out with the steak too.

Overall, it was good food. After finishing all of the entrees, the waiter asked if we were still hungry. I answered with a qualified YES. He offered to bring the menu back. But I was thinking more about walking across the street to the Dan Marino Steakhouse at Hooters. Now THERE'S fine dining ;-). I capped off the meal with a dessert of Earl Grey chocolate cake with almond ice cream. SOOOOOO TINY. 

I guess I'd go to Company again. But I'd only bring a certain group of people with me. Their concept change has radically changed my concept of dining there. Good place for foodies to knock off a bunch of plates. Bad place for someone who hasn't eaten since the Chick-Fil-A four hours away in Upland, California.",sOJ3jcYn5X_VYVGHDaGODA,1,1,2,h7bAQGbNR3PGNGQ8JP2rPw
2770287,2008-12-16,1,s8z8r0MN7S6OzfGld-cEdw,"Company is a prime example of what is wrong with the American craze with ""Tapas-style dining.""  It's an excuse to halve or even quarter the portion and tack on a few extra dollars to the price tag. Those of you who have been to real tapas places in Spain know that while the portions are on the smaller side, if you order a few plates you'll be pretty darn full. Stateside, it seems as if the trend veers towards ""single panko-crusted green bean."" FYI, that'll be $10. That's exactly what you get at Company: teeny, tiny, uninspired dishes.

Now, I'm all for tasting a wide variety of unusual or off-the-beaten-path dishes. If you've got yams hand raised by blind zen masters in the fertile volcanic soil of Mt. Who-gives-a-damn, I want to be the first to try them. You won't get anything so original at Company. Just a bunch of run-of-the-mill, generic tapas dishes. You have duck potstickers? Really? Never had those before! Seared Ahi? Quel surprise!

Service was lackluster, unless surly waiters in blue jeans and silk-screened t-shirts are your thing, in which case consider this your Mecca.  They even forgot to bring out our last dish until we reminded them a few times that we were still waiting (and still starving, I might add.)

One star for the delicious cocktails in the lounge adjacent, which are half-off during their unadvertised happy-hour (no wonder this place is dead!) Try the Sexy Clean.

We had a party of eight people getting hyped to watch Dane Cook perform next door so we stopped in Company.  We had reservations and were immediately seated by the polite hostess.  The waiter was great with the orders and the food was good.  Some minor problems were the pricing at the time.  $9 per Prawn? A little on the high side for certain items.  

Second vist was before heading into the LAX nightclub.  Seated at the bar area adjacent to the restaurant.  Bartender was very nice, cocktails were the usual strip pricing :/.  The now have tapas style apps during club nights which are decent and reasonably priced.

The decor is trendy and comfortable. It's very spacious and roomy tables. I ordered the salmon and the bf got the rib eye with a side of tater tots. What classic american food right? Great food. Loved the tater tots. My salmon was made just right and tasted fresh. The bf loved his steak. It may have been a tiny piece for him but he loved every bite of it. He said it was juicy and tender with lots of flavor. For dessert we tried their assorted sorbets since it was homemade. Very interesting flavors. I especially liked the banana flavor.

3583204,2009-09-15,1,s8z8r0MN7S6OzfGld-cEdw,"We decided to eat here for a couple reasons - we were staying at the Luxor, and when you eat there, you get free admission to LAX, the club right next door. 
There were four of us and we ordered the beer battered shrimp, mac and cheese, kobe sliders, and BBQ chicken pizza. They serve them 'family style' so that everyone can share. The portions were a bit smaller than I had anticipated. But because we had to wait so long for our drinks, we were given free ranch chips which helped fill us up. The food was decent, nothing to flip over, but I enjoyed it. The Jalapeno mayo that accompanied the shrimp was great. Just the right amount of heat to offset the crunchy and sweet shrimp. 
Dessert was another story. We ordered the cobbler only to be told 20 minutes later that there was no cobbler. So we went with the Bananas Foster. Now, I am a huge Bananas Foster fan and I believe I have a discerning palate for the delicious dessert. It came arranged in a light cookie bowl with huge slices of banana and the sauce was poured over by our waiter. I don't think they ever flambeed the sauce because it was nearly all rum. And I understand its Vegas, and most peoples #1 objective is to get plastered, but I wanted to enjoy my dessert without needing a chaser. We were given free chocolate truffle lollipops for the cobbler mishap, but even they werent top notch. 
I guess why I'm giving it 3 stars is because I enjoyed my dinner and it got us into LAX for free (normally a $30 cover, yikes)

As a vegetarian, I had the Gruyere cheese puffs (minus the lobster oil), the CAB mixed green salad, and the miso glazed eggplant. Cheese puffs were a little dry (probably better with the lobster oil), salad was unexceptional, and the eggplant was amazing. 
My companion had the filet of beef, duck breast and yukon gold potatoes. He enjoyed all. 
For dessert we shared the persimmon tart and 3 freshly baked chocolate chip cookie (that came with a spiced hot chocolate). The tart was good, the cookies - the bomb.

Let's start with the bad and then onto the good.  Bad:  bitchy service in the bar area as we waited for our party, slow service at our table in taking our orders, over an hour to get our meals delivered, two entrees sent back and most parties disappointed in the taste of their food.  

Good:  a few servers were friendly and space is kind of cool in decor as it is a modern hunting lodge theme that we see in LA quite often (7 Grand).

We came in for a snack before some friends headed out to a show. We weren't particularly hungry but we knew we should eat something. 

The problem with a great menu is when you're not hungry, you don't really want to eat anything. But then again, you want to order everything because damnit, you're a foodie and you want to try it all.

I finally selected the fish and chips under the appetizers for $13. The server explained to me that the ""waffle fries"" were actually a waffle that they cut up as ""fries."" He said he would substitute for real fries if I wanted. Nope, I wanted to see this creation. Turns out yes, it was a waffle they sliced up. The waffle itself was already sweet. If you look at the picture the liquidy brown stuff is not maple syrup but in fact malt vinegar for the fish. 

The fried fish was way too oily and greasy. I felt the oil was not hot enough when they fried it. Otherwise everything was okay. Service was actually really nice and my friends enjoyed their meals. The gay boyfriend had the English Muffin burger and another friend had the soup which looked great and some sashimi. It's a very eclectic menu with some Asian touches. I was particularly attracted to the veggie sides.

Pricing could have been better. The wine list is extensive. They featured some interesting cocktails but I didn't feel like drinking $14 cocktails at 5 p.m. (weird, I know!).

We were first allured into this place since it was on the way to the restroom in between watching Greg lose more money at Let It Ride in Luxor.  Minh spotted a sign that indicated a $4 menu and showed what was labeled as crispy mashed potato sticks, or something of that nature.  Basically twinkie-sized tator tots with chives, bacon, and a spiral of sour cream on the outside of them - for $4, YESH PREAZE.

After a few more trips and a lot more free beers, we decided to check the place out for appetizers prior to waiting for the rest of the group to arrive in Vegas.  

First, I ordered a cucumber salad (can't resist me some cucumber) which was $6 of disappointment.  Probably a half of a cucumber sliced very thin (almost too thin to crunch) with sesame seed oil on top.  That's all.  It would have been fine for $3, but not $6.  

Minh ordered the mashed potato sticks, I ordered the kobe sliders, and B ordered the ""dirty fries"" on recommendation from the hostess.  Mashed potato sticks were basically what they were billed as, although none of us recalled tasting any bacon...  The kobe sliders were actually very nice, I'll definitely use Hawaiian bread the next time I cook sliders too, butter lettuce was a nice touch too!   But the best of all were the dirty fries - cajun spiced fries drizzled with muenster cheese and thick chunks of bacon - extremely tasty.

Was enough for us to hit the place back up at dinner with the larger group.  

The only thing really out of the ordinary about the experience was the line of what must have been two dozen (we ASSUME) strippers with their dbag escorts at the tables behind us.  They significantly slowed down the service to our table, but most of us didn't mind watching (sorry, Ann).

The fish had been turned into long, half inch by half inch ""sticks"" of sorts and had a strong fishy smell.

This was accompanied by what they called ""waffle fries"" -- only which after receiving them, did I understand their quotes on ""waffle fries""; they were literally pieces of waffle, like breakfast waffle, made with what I assume is a potato puree or something. fail.
