Bosa 1 has great menu selection which is a big plus. My favorites are the appetizers and Bun Bo Hue. You cant go wrong with this place I swear.  

Bun Bo Hue is also a Laos dish as well. Its call Ka Poon. It is a Noodles soup dish with all different kind of vegetables to put in the soup. Big Plus if you like Vegetables like me. 

There Appetizers is very different from other place and I THANK YOU Bosa 1 for taking your time to make them. It is VERY VERY DEEEElicious...
Y'ALL got to try the Vietnamese Spring Roll Or (can be call  Summer Roll) ... its different I tell you. But the correct way to call it is Spring Roll. I do know some people are from different state/Country and will call them Summer Roll.  (They are the same tho...)

Thats the website that will make you understand about the name more (Spring/Summer Rolls):

There are several reasons why.  First of all, Bosa 1 is completely clean and nicely decorated, compared to some other Vietnamese places in town.  This will allow the new person to focus on the food and gain a good impression, rather than feel squeamish from questionable surroundings!
The second reason is that the staff at this restaurant are wonderful about explaining their menu and offerings.  They explain what each entree is, how to order combos to get exactly what you wish to eat, and even suggest how to eat it (which sauce to use, to dip or mix through, etc).  I learn more and more about Vietnamese food each time I eat there.  

Now, two caveats - they only accept cash and are a bit pricier than some other Vietnamese restaurants.  But on the days when I crave Vietnamese, and want a serene and clean surrounding, I always head to Bosa 1.  :)",ePUXeZsFYq2WwR2KcF7ZpQ,2,2,4,37GjGrRcPSvcPxs_VSQkPg

-Broken rice dish - Big portion of Chinese sausage, egg and pork cake, shredded pork and pork skin. Served with sweet homemade fish sauce. 
-Rice noodles - Baked seafood cakes, chunks of tomatoes, fresh basil and bean sprouts in homemade chicken broth. So comforting and tasty.

I came in the other night searching for a delicious bowl of Pho.  When the owner, who is about as nice as it gets, informed me they didn't serve that, I was a little crushed.  

He walked me through the menu, and explained a few different dishes.  Since all I know about Vietnamese cuisine is Pho, I was thrilled for the quick education!

I went with the broken rice with Korean short rib, shrimp cake, and shrimp skewer.  The pretty woman who I believe is the chef, painstakingly hand cuts every piece of rice.......nope, that's not true.  The dish is made with lots of love though.  

The Korean short ribs were very flavorful, and better than some Kalbi I've had at Korean restaurants in town.  The shrimp skewer was bursting with flavor, as was the patty.  There were notes of sweetness without being too sugary in every bite.  I think what I loved most though, was the fish sauce and chili.  I could dip just about anything in that sauce, that's right, ANYTHING......you dirty thinker you!

The Bun Rieu was overly salty and felt lacking...in flavor and substance.

The Nem Nuong rolls were ok.  The nem itself was tasty but the dipping sauce was horrible.  It looked like it had been sitting out for a while and had that solid film-like layer over it.

The saving grace of my meal was my beverage.  The Rau Ma Tuoi with Dau Xanh was a refreshing drink.

1268689,2011-04-10,0,UAEoomKQwpiFhaJSzrboQA,"My wife and I have drive by this place many times, and even parked in front of it twice, but never made it inside because 1) there is a sign of Cash Only outside, and 2) it looks like of sketchy from the outside.

We finally made it inside two weeks ago, and we have been back for 3 times since. The best kind of restaurant in my mind is the kind of small, hole in the wall place, that makes one or two dishes really really well. Bosa 1 is that kind of restaurant.

My exposure to Vietnamese cuisine is limited to pho and sandwiches, and while I have had other types of dishes, none of them were memorable for me to remember their names. Well, I am still struggling with all of their names, but Bosa 1 makes me want to learn their names because the food is that good.

First of all, if you are expecting pho (like I was when I walked in), you might be disappointed. As far as I can tell, the closest item you can have to pho is the spicy noodle soup Bon Bo Hue. You can ask to have the spicy sauce on the side. It also has pork's feet in the soup. The noodle soup comes with a plate of fresh vegetables and herbs that you can add to the hot soup, and man does that taste wonderful! 

The rest of the menu consist of various combinations of grilled items (beef, chicken, Korean BBQ i.e. Kalbi, shrimp, and sausage), and with your choice of rice or noodles. I have had all of these dishes at one point at another Vietnamese restaurant, but the ones at Bosa 1 are so much better! I can tell the items are freshly grilled (they will take a little longer to come out because of that), and they pack a lot of vegetables and herbs in the bowl. You also get to mix your own vinegar and hot sauce to pour onto the dish, or use it for dipping.

Whether you choose rice (broken rice) or vermicelli (rice noodles), it's a big bowl/plate of savory grilled item with nice crunchy vegetables and herbs, maybe a deep fried spring roll, and tangy sauce. 

On top of the great food, what really earned this place 5 stars in my mind is the staff. On our recent visit, my wife had a question about which dish or sauce contains soy product, since our infant son has a possible soy allergy. The staff went in and researched the recipes and came out to tell us which dishes contains soy sauce or soy products, and which ones can be made without the sauce. It was very comforting to see they take such good care of their customers, as evident in their recent offering of the gluten free appetizers.

My family and I will be sure to visit this place many times in the coming years.",13oHusx9NQiXOtzGLHkWKA,1,0,5,iKeAl4IwmiT-Nnkp_DENRw

The spring rolls are thick and juicy filled with fish cake or sausage. 
It's even better when you get it fried, it's light and crispy. Delicious when wrapped with lettuce and dipped in the sauce. 

I got a couple of different rice plates from the shrimp and chicken to the kal bi (short ribs). It's all tasty. It comes with rice and fish cake or some type of sausage. 

My only thing here is that they don't have pho! Oh well, just a minor thing really, but I can get tired of eating too many fried/sausge foods.

We ordered the spring rolls with beef and the Bun Bo Hue, which seems to be one of the special dishes served here. And it DID NOT disappoint. I don't think I have bad better Bun Bo Hue in California. The pig knuckle is soft here, softer than I have ever had. And the broth is filled with spicy flavor. The bowl comes as a large and was good to fill both my bf and I. 

The spring rolls with beef comes out warm, so don't be surprised. There is some type of crunchy tiny eggroll thing on the inside that gives this dish a distinct texture - I really like it and you need to try it!

The servers here are so sweet and give you a lot of attention. They don't hustle you for the bill, are funny, and fill your glass whenever it's half empty.

Bosa 1 is the only place in town that makes it this legit. Gone is your typical place of bean sprouts and scattered herbs because that is generally for Pho. Now the plate of greens is appropriately replaced with the proper ""pairing"" of delicately chopped cabbage, lettuce and fragrant herbs.  When eaten with a wonderful bowl of bun Bo hue goodies of pork related products and rounding out with just a baby kick of spice, this bowl of noodles is good anytime of day or season.

Other items to note:
Cafe Sua Da - unique hazelnut flavored Vietnamese iced coffee
Nem Nuong Cuon - I know ya'll are brodard lovers but you can share some love here too.  They too have a crispy deepfried stick of goodness inside.

1970699,2011-10-02,5,UAEoomKQwpiFhaJSzrboQA,"The sign was so Big, it caught my attention.. Why not, lets do it. When I think of Vietnamese food, I think of that soothing super hot Pho soup or that inexpensive cold cut Banh mi sub.. Not here! 

Felt like having rice anyway:

Vietnamese BBQ Spring Rolls: Actually I wanted the Fried Egg Rolls But I guess I ordered this instead.. No problem.. 4 Fat pieces of unfried spring rolls and a complex looking peanut sauce. I had to take a bite without the sauce to taste what I was working with.. Oooh Very nice! Great pork/meaty flavor, a healthy dose of herbs/veggies and a crunchy roll of texture! What a touch of genius.. That roll (looked like a stick of cinnamon) but tasted like a sweet cracker and gave that soft roll that crunch that I desire from Fried Egg Rolls.. Very Noice! The peanut sauce, wasn't the ordinary plain, expected peanut sauce.. It was obvious just by looking at it. Well, whatever they put it in there made me an even happier camper! Awesome way to start!

62. BBQ Pork with Broken Rice plus Chinese Sausage: Several thin slices of golden brown pork, dark red slices of chinese sausage over a bed of Broken rice and sweet pickled daikon (type of radish), carrots and cucmber. On the side for dipping the bbq pork, my server actually made my fish sauce mix tableside (water, vinegar, sugar and fish sauce, plus a splash of chili). The pork was tender, had a light flavor and dipping it in the sauce was Money!! One of the few items that you'd find in my freezer are Chinese sausages. I buy frozen packages at the Asian markets, slice em' thin, lightly fry and eat them like popcorn. They're Really REALLLY GOOD! Theirs seemed to taste a tad better maybe because theirs are supposedly never frozen.. The sweet pickled veggies were fresh and balanced some of the fattiness from the meats beautifully. The broken rice's appealing naturally buttery note was a Bonus! Subtle But Noticeable. Very Delicous Dish!! 

*Broken rice: Some history according to the server - Originally transporters from ancient times used to sift/throw away the ""broken"" grains of rice until it became so much that they decided to try cooking it themselves instead of wasting it. Come to find out, they discovered that it carried a different satisfying flavor. Now it's sold separately like a delicacy.. 

Pennywort Juice with Mung bean: Server told me that the this was formed from leaves that float like lily pads in the water and that they also add some coconut juice in it. If I were to blind taste this with Wheatgrass Juice, I wouldn't tell the difference except this had a grainy consistency. Not bad, I think it was healthy! 

Service Beyond what I expected in terms of knowledge of the food, especially coming from an African American Server! What's up ""Mo""! Super cool guy and a Very patient, Attentive and Easy to talk to. This place served up One of the better Vietnamese riced dishes and Rolls I've ever had. Value was there.

I'm Stairway to Heaven""  Whereas beef and chicken pho are the top 40 hits of Vietnamese noodle soups, I feel that Bun Bo Hue is Stairway to Heaven requiring multiple tastings to discover new things to appreciate with each delicious bite.

A subtle yet rich beef/pork broth with deep notes of lemongrass and just the right touch of spice, the soup uses round chewy rice noodles akin to bucatini as opposed to the linguini-like counterpart in traditional pho.  There are also various pieces of pork feet, pork bloodcake, steamed pork loaf, and beef shank and tendon.  Further complexity is provided with vietnamese coriander, mint and some vietnamese herbs that escape my recollection.  Finally, a fresh plate of colorful purple and green cabbage along with jullienned herbs and wedges of lime add bright notes of texture and tartness to complete the dish.   The beauty of the dish is how each component is distinct yet not overpowering so that every tasty bite is a unique experience on their own.  Of the various bun bo hue I've sampled, this one definitely ranks up with the best since none of the meat components including the pork blood cubes are overcooked (a common mistake) and the meat around the pork knuckle is particularly tender and flavorful.  

Whereas some dishes will elicit a party in your mouth, this one will be a symphony in your mouth that strike all the right notes and may require or compel multiple tastings.  Do remember to bring CASH!",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,0,1,4,RkxZjiD9welGafdAt0kZ2g

we come here regularly now, and the only thing I love to eat here--although their other dishes are fantastic--are those lovely cha gio rolls.  I'm in love with them!  We eat that for our meal, ordering one for each of us and another order of the shrimp ones.  With spicy fish sauce you make yourself, throwing in some of the pickled veggies that come on the plate, it's heaven.  Sheer heaven.

What gets to me about those rolls is the filling.  It's flavorful, juicy, and yet the wrapper maintains that lovely crunch it should always have.  With it wrapped in lettuce and some vermicelli noodles, just dip it in fish sauce with some sriracha and pickled carrot and radish, and you'll be in cha gio heaven.

The whole world blurs out during the time I'm working on my plate at that restaurant.  I take a sip of penny wort and mung bean juice in between, get my fingers all soggy with fish sauce, and once it's done, I sit back, wipe my hands, and pat my belly.  

Yes--I eat here at LEAST 3 times a week about an hour before they close, usually.  It's small seating, so make sure you get there early on holidays and Fridays.  

Is it worth going to this place when it's CASH ONLY ?  Yes!  Just break a bill at the casino and head over here.  It's worth every mile you drive from wherever you are in Vegas, and worth every penny.

Nor did the nice woman who explained the food to me ever mention it. BF and I usually don't carry cash. So when the check came, we sure had a surprise.

Thankfully, we scraped up enough money.

But my other gripe is it took about 40 minutes for our food to come. This was during lunch time and we didn't have time for a leisurely lunch. After the 3rd time I inquired about our food, I was told they were busy and have a small kitchen. (Uh, okay, but I'm usually time crunched at lunch and figure on food in 15-20 minutes, max. I'd have left if I knew it was that long.)

Lastly, the food was meh. I'm not sure what's getting all the raves. Mediocre Vietnamese food, no pho, and I thought I ordered a vermicelli dish and it came with rice. The food wasn't awful, but it sure wasn't spectacular.

This place is not your ordinary Vietnamese Pho restaurant. They only have to kinds of soup to choose from. First, they ran out of the thick round noodles that go with the Bun Bo Hue, so I was not quite happy with the small portion of thin vermicelli they replaced. Second the soup was OH SO bland. I don't know what others were raving about the soup, but to me, the soup was not flavorful at all. Third, all the items on the menu were quite expensive compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in town. Three dishes for $30 including tips. The spring roll appetizer was the same price as my main dish. I think that's pretty weird. Finally, they don't have the traditional plate of bean sprouts that go into the soup, instead, I got a plate of chopped up mixed greens. I don't particularly care for one of the herbs in the mix. But it was hard to pick them out when it was all mixed altogether with the other greens. So for me this is only a 2 star restaurant.",cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,2,0,2,lojYfK1s-rHJ31-q6MWv4A

Growing up I had a really good friend who was Vietnamese. Every time I would go over to his house his parents were cooking. Even if I stopped by late at night they were cooking. I never understood why. Being the Americanized kid I was, I didn't like the smell so maybe that turned me off to Vietnamese food.

I'm glad I'm finally getting into the cuisine because the stuff I've had recently was amazing. And cheap! I'm not sure what I like more -- the broken rice dishes or bún. The proteins served with the com tam and bún have been memorable. The grilled chicken and BBQ pork are so savory and delicious and their shrimp cakes and egg rolls are amazing. Servings are fairly large and the prices make it a great value.

PLEASE NOTE: There is NO PHO here. Fail #2.

Anyhoo, I was pretty darn disappointed there wasn't pho. I browsed the menu and went with the broken rice with shredded pork and egg quiche. The people that run this place are fluent in English not to mention beyond friendly. The owners are originally from Garden Grove so they decided to name the place Bosa, after the infamous street Bolsa in OC. I like that they leave a small pitcher of fish sauce so you can concoct your own sauce. Their egg rolls weren't oily and tasted wonderful. Luckily, my friend gave me some of hers so I didn't have to order more.

HOLY mother of hell. This place makes quite possibly THE BEST com tam. The rice was actually broken rather than the traditional rice we all eat. The egg quiche was super thick, soft, and so juicy. Normally, places cook the egg quiche and let it sit out and you can tell by the crusty outer egg shell that starts to form. It was literally like biting into an egg custard. Party in your mouth let me tell ya! They also have this cute little vegetable arrangement for each plate. Sort of like a boat made out of lettuce with slices of cucumbers and pickled carrots and daikon. There is not one bad thing I can say about this place except maybe they should have a location here in the OC!

The soymilk arrived piping hot in a Styrofoam cup. Upon lifting the lid, I noticed a very familiar smell -- pandan! Looking down at the soymilk I saw it had a light green tint. I sipped and confirmed that it was pandan-infused soymilk. I wish I had known that before I had ordered it, as I feel that pandan can overpower my palate. I would have gotten a different drink.

The beef salad rolls arrived and they were quite yum. The server walked by us and explained that many customers eat it with fish sauce in addition to the peanut sauce that it came with. He then brought out two saucers for us to pour fish sauce in. These salad rolls had something crunchy in them, I think they were deep fried egg roll skins. It added a nice texture to the beefy rolls.

We came here for one thing and that was the Cha Gio Eggrolls.  Don't get me wrong though, the other dishes are excellent as well.  But those egg rolls are addictive.  The GF and I don't even share lol, we each get our own.  Just thinking about it is making me want to go there now.

With the awsome egg rolls aside, they offer a series of combination dishes that are all great.  When looking at the menu it seems that you can choose from a variety of different combinations of dishes and each section caters to how hungry you are.  And the server can tell you about all of them.

On top of all this good food they have some ecellent beverages.  This time there was a soda with macerated strawberries.  It was great.

I sent my fiance here to get me lunch on Monday.  We got the #17 with Shrimp cake, Shrimp Skewer, and BBQ Pork Chop with a side of House Sausage.  It was so flavorful.  The shrimp cake is wrapped in tofu skin with bits of real shrimp.  Grilled Shrimp, Pork Chop, and house sausage were seasoned so well, I loved every bite!  

I love the rice plate so much, I sent my fiance here again 2 days later.  This time, I decided to get a Bun Bo Hue in addition to the Rice Plate.  The Bun Bo Hue was PERFECTION!  I loved the broth, rich and yet not greasy.  The beef, pork knuckle, tendon, blood jelly, and pork patty were cooked perfectly, even the noodle had the firm and al dente consistency.

1.  NO PHO!  Get over it. I am a Vietnamese food rookie, and was shocked to see no pho, however, they had my favorite Bun Bo Hue noodle and I was very happy.

2.  Bun Bo Hue - This is a noodle dish that is a bit spicy and has the pork knuckle, tendons and some blood. It was the first restaurant I tried it with the pig blood. Very tasty!  They serve the Bun Bo Hue with chopped cabbage instead of bean sprouts, which i have learned is the real authentic way.  The spice was nice, the broth very slurprageous and the noodles were just right. I would say, this is one of the best BBH ever.

3.  My dining mates had the korean bbq and shrimp cake over broken rice and the chinese sausage and egg roll over broken rice.  Korean bbq was good, but the shrimp cakes were awesome. Nice texture and taste.  The egg rolls were home made and my mother in law said it was the best she has tasted! She also loved the sausage.  The broken rise was very, very nice. Different slight flavor to it.  Mixing this with fish sauce and vinegar was a great suggestion by the waiter.

4.  Service was great. We went at 11:00 and they open at 1030.  Kevin the waiter was not too busy so he explained alot to us, had us try some other things. I love learning about great food.

5.  Parking - Easy peasy as it is in a strip mall

6.  Ambiance - No problem, small but nice place.

Came in with the BF and we shared a rice plate and the cha gio eggrolls. 

There's just something a little extra that boost their eggrolls above all the others. It's juicier inside yet still maintains it's crunch. The accompaniments are not overlooked: I havent found a place that gives you a mound of noodles for your rolls. The herbs- they give the standard mint, but there's this heart-ish shaped herb that has a red underbelly that I really like and I haven't found another place here that gives you that with your cha gio (usually it's these long fish smelling herb that I'm not fond of). Then the cucumber is thin spears making it roll ready and the lovely pickled radish carrot. This is where you go if you want a proper cha gio. 

The plate is just as good as the last time so they definitely have a decent standard of consistency in their kitchen. Service is always friendly and the place is pleasant.

The BF swears he will not order broken rice anywhere else because he'll just be disappointed. Pretty big statement, but I totally get it- this place is a spot that is definitely worthy of being in the O.C., which is the place to go in the US for some real Viet gastronomic adventures (actually Bosa has a sister restaurant in Westminster- different name...can't recall right now).

5199622,2010-03-27,6,UAEoomKQwpiFhaJSzrboQA,"Pho is the superstar of Vietnamese cuisine, and banh mi is its loveable supporting actress. Often times com tam, or broken rice, is often overlooked. Well, at least I have been overlooking it because I had never even tried it until today. Honestly, I had always assumed it was a hard rice for some stupid reason. I guess I just thought that something soft couldn't be broken. (That sounds like a lyric from an 'awesome' 80s hair metal ballad.)

Well, you won't find any Scorpions at Bosa 1, but you will find plenty of broken rice, and I like these little grains. As I discovered, broken rice is teeny-grained, sticky white rice, and I guess it isn't rocket science, but it is literally the grains broken during processing and transport, i.e. the cheap stuff, but I still think it is the good stuff. 

I went to Bosa today for an unofficial gathering of yelpers (UYE). The place is small and simple. The bathroom is in the kitchen, which is a good thing if you like to spy on what is happening back there. Everything happening back there appeared legit other than the toilet itself, which was having flushing issues. Just saying. 

The server/owner/head chef was incredibly nice and informative. She explained that despite the giant pho sign out front, they did not have it today because they were missing one ingredient. Plus, she said it takes 6 hours to make, which means she would have to arrive at 3am. All of that made me pretty confident in the level of care that was going into the food. She isn't just going to throw something together and sling it in the microwave!

Fellow yelper Blair B ordered Nem Nuong Cuon, a healthy spring roll wrapped in soft rice paper with grilled pork. The owner explained that they came with (I think) a 16 ingredient peanut sauce. She assured us that 99.9% of everything is homemade, including what appeared to be a rotating selection of fresh, intriguing beverages. Impressive. The spring roll had what I would compare to a Taiwanese sausage on the inside, but despite the sausage, it tasted light and healthy, much unlike an egg roll.

I ordered a small plate that came with BBQ chicken and shrimp and a little salad of pickled vegetables (and the broken rice). What I enjoyed about my meal was the straightforward nature of the ingredients. The flavors were clean and simple, not overpowering or heavy. 

I think I will definitely return. If you want an introduction to another side of Vietnamese cuisine, this is a very safe and friendly option, and remember, soft things can be broken.

I can eat noodles 3 times a day.. everyday!
and since we were in Vegas..
my BF and I wanted to try something new..
so instead of grabbing pho
we decided to try another famous Vietnamese dish called BUN BO HUE!

BUN BO HUE http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UAEoomKQwpiFhaJSzrboQA?select=35tbOSoEtTzUnYcZDiz2SA $7.99 - noodles in spicy beef broth w/ beef, pork, tendon, and blood jelly.

I had mine with no blood jelly.

You get these: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UAEoomKQwpiFhaJSzrboQA?select=fjLbFLBwFlUFZ0d5Ao08CA instead of a plate of bean sprouts and onions.
And the noodles in bun bo hue are much more thicker than the ones in pho... sorta like udon noodles.. but a little thinner.. :P
All the meats in it were good.. especially the pork..
and their broth was good too.. not spicy at all for us.. 
and my BF actually drank the broth! (he doesn't do this with pho)

Service was awesome
and so was the food.

Buuuuuuuuuuuut........ I still like pho better.
My BF doesn't think so.. 
he likes this..
this might be another Vegas spot for us. :}

5232721,2010-04-04,1,UAEoomKQwpiFhaJSzrboQA,"A Vietnamese place without Pho and Bahn Mi? WTF do they serve? Good stuff I tell you, good stuff ! I'm embarrassed to admit in one week I dined here twice - once with Yelp's Misti and Keith and once with a coworker. Yup I'm a little addicted. 

Atmosphere: Cute and homey. If you eat early (think 11:30 AM for lunch, you'll have the entire restaurant to yourself).

Staff: The woman running the front of house is a doll and very informative. The chef came out to meet us last time too and was also very friendly and happy to answer any questions about the cuisine. Very sweet personable people who care about their restaurant.

Drinks: First I tried the salty lemonade. It was a little sweet for my taste. The next time I tried Pennywort juice. It's like wheatgrass juice but tastier! Definitely recommend trying it if the green color isn't off putting to you !

Food: 

*You must start with the grilled pork spring rolls. These are absolutely the best in the city. The ingredients are so fresh and they are served with an amazing peanut sauce that's made from scratch. Homemade peanut sauce is SO much tastier than the junk that comes in jars. 

*At this point I've worked my way through most the meats. Personal favorites are the BBQ pork (think small slices, no chewy meat, perfectly flavored) and the Chinese sausage. I know you're thinking (wtf, chinese sausage at a vietnamese place?). The thing is, the owners love chinese sausage and wanted to put it on the menu for fun. My coworker is a chinese sausage expert and was extremely pleased with their rendition. YUM

*Oh lastly, you must get this on broken rice ! Yup, it's just cheap broken leftover pieces that are damaged in transit. We had a talk with the chef about this - somehow this rice is like crack. It's better than ""normal"" rice. The tiny pieces somehow taste better and are ""creamier"" in the chef's own words. Some pieces get a little burnt and crispy (yum in my book), but overall the flavor is unique and unlike any rice I've ever had. 

One more thing -  I told the house manager I'd love to see a gluttonous combination of BBQ pork and Chinese sausage on my next visit as one of the combo plates. She did say she's happy to accommodate and you mix and match the meats as you please.  If you don't see the right combo on the menu - ask her, they are happy to create the combo plate of your dreams !",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,2,3,5,EI6Rbe4uIcl2ybDhElVVAA
5385771,2011-10-23,1,UAEoomKQwpiFhaJSzrboQA,"I finally tried this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews; and, I'm very happy I did. First, I know next to nothing about Vietnamese food, and I will not pretend to know what I'm talking about, so with that in mind, take this review (on the food side) with a grain of salt.

I came here on a special occasion to take my mom somewhere nice on her visit here from out of town. However, I think I'll be coming back for occasions, special or not.

The Atmosphere:
Small, quaint atmosphere with 2, 2 person tables and about 7, 4 person tables. I love this type of restaurant that is very intimate. The dining area is nicely decorated with bamboo accents and its nice and bright for a lunchtime climate. The music is modern pop music a la Katie Perry, Lady Gaga, Black Eyed Peas etc. But its quiet enough where I can tune it out (or listen to a guilty pleasure song) if needed.

The Food: 
Like I said, I don't know much about Vietnamese cooking. I can't tell you how an authentic grandmother cooked meal should taste. However, what I do know is when food is fresh. The backbone of any standout restaurant is fresh ingredients. Bosa 1 has food that is all made on the spot, and their herbs taste like they were grown in house and picked from the ground right before serving. I greatly appreciate this fact since most of what I eat are vegetables, and if they aren't fresh, it really irks me. I got spring rolls and my mom got the Bun Bo Hue which she really liked (which is nice, because considering the size of the portions she will be eating it for a while.)

The Service:
OK. Enough chitchat about boring things. This is the reason why I felt motivated to come on yelp and give a review after a long hiatus. The service was absolutely phenomenal. As soon as you enter the restaurant, you are greeted with a smile. 

Once we sat down the waiter went over the entire menu with us as we were first time eaters at Bosa 1. After going over the menu with us and giving us countless recommendations on what to get, he asks us if we're ready to order. Of course, my mother says, ""So whats good on the menu?""

Instead of doing what I would do and yelled ""I JUST TOLD YOU WOMAN!"" the server just smiled and went over the menu with her again, thus clearly exhibiting some type of super-human patience.

I ordered something special that wasn't on the menu since there are no vegetarian options (if you don't eat fish sauce) so the server said they could whip something up completely vegetarian for me to eat. Unfortunately, after telling me he could make the food, apparently they ran out of tofu. So the server actually ran out to his car and drove to the market to buy more.  Who knew this type of customer service still existed in the age in which we live.

Finally, when the meal was done, the server said he would try to convince the owner to put more vegetarian options on the menu for the future. Even if this wasn't true, it was still a nice gesture, and I appreciate it.

Price:
The price is about 10 bucks per person (meal and drink). Actually in our case it WAS 10 bucks per person exactly. This may seem like a lot (I don't actually know since I don't eat Vietnamese food often, I'm just going by what some yelpers have said) But the portions of the food more than make up the cost margin. 

The only problem is that the restaurant is cash only. There actually are signs that say ""Cash Only"" by the cash register so the 2 star review for here is totally wrong. But it's still an annoyance in this day and age. 

5 Stars:
For the reasons stated above (mostly the service) I give this place 5 stars. I will definitely be back in the near future, just hopefully with more vegetarian options.",8KDf_eoUhH3wCS6NYdcLfQ,1,1,5,9RfAovD1tPeQdKeoTo7h9g

The restaurant is across the street from 168 Asian Supermarket and in the same lot as China Mama.  It is a small and cozy place.  When I was there it wasn't too crowded, and I didn't see any waitress or people behind the counter, but I was soon greeted by a nice Asian lady emerging from the kitchen area.  I didn't know what to order, since my friend Tina usually recommends something when I go to restaurants in Orange County, but the lady patiently waited for me to scan their menu and finally place my to-go order.

The food smelled great!  It tasted okay. Okay portion size, but definitely way smaller than the huge portions that I am used to getting in OC (those I can't finished and take home as in between meal snacks).  The experience didn't knock off any socks, but I will go back and try their Vietnamese BBQ Spring Roll (hopefully it will be somewhat close to the awesome pork spring rolls made by Brodard Restaurant in Westminster, California).

Also starting Monday, March 8, 2010, they will be serving pho again.  So I will try that too, since I have yet to find a good pho place in Vegas that is a great facsimile of the awesome pho you can get in California.

I can't say I'm as impressed as a lot of other Yelpers seem to be. I've been here on a number of occasions in the past year and a half and I have noticed some positive changes in the layout of the restaurant in that time. It is much roomier and has a more modern and clean feel, which I appreciate. The service is also quite friendly.

The food is pretty good, but a little more expensive than a lot of other Vietnamese restaurants in town. The portions are generous, but I don't think the cuts of meat are so impressive that they warrant an $11 pricetag per entree. 

The broken rice is pretty good and interesting and I do enjoy the Bun Bo Hue quite a bit, even though it is quite spicy. I'm a big fan of spice. The spicier the better in my book, but this soup is even slightly too spicy for me. If you get it, probably a great idea to share with your dining companion and also get a rice dish or appetizer, depending on how hungry you are. This might help with the spice quotient.

The vermicelli noodles leave quite a bit to be desired. One of my favorite dishes in Vietnamese cuisine is a nice, refreshing vermicelli bowl, but these noodles are a little thicker than I prefer and slightly overcooked as well. They have a slimy texture that I found a little unappealing.

All in all, this place is fine and dandy and I enjoy quite a few of the dishes here, it's just not the first place I think about when I'm in the mood for Vietnamese.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,3,uYuv49ogRQEzfGqI3P9T-w
