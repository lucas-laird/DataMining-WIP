went at 4am...3 bartenders and they couldnt handle 30 people in the bar...at times waited 10-15 min for a beer..

drink prices outrageous...felt like i was on the strip.. also pt's adds tax to cost of drink instead of being included in price...
large draft $11..???!!!! 

i havent been to a pt's in over a year and now i remember why.....

2302086,2017-09-01,0,8ovqtunN8zGdCbYi-MCTAQ,"First time here, surprisingly crowded at 1:45am on a Friday morning. Took roughly 10min and $6 of gambling before anyone checked for me. I'm not really in a rush to gamble away money. Ordered my wings and fries, (Tried em at the PT's on Lake Mead/Tenaya). I'm hoping they come out good, but the bar tender really charged me $5 for pineapple juice and sprite?... Typically I would've tipped $10 as a habit, but if you're gonna charge me that while I'm gambling and I'm not even ordering alcohol, I'm not to pleased. I'll update once the food comes.

I'm actually a fan of the original seasoning that comes on the fries. I called myself looking for that salt with the hint of sweetness, I guess they were lightly seasoned this time. The gentleman who delivered the food sat/slid me the plate and walked away. He didn't check to see if I liked what I saw or if I needed anything else, but I did end up needing a bar caddy and a replacement ketchup. I'm not complaining, just relaying the experience. Wings are piping hot, but I don't think this is enough ranch. I'm trying to read the name tags, but the small black lettering against the gold is hard to get a good look at in this light without me having to stop them just to ask if I could read it (I'm wearing my glasses, and my prescription isn't old). The bartender who charged me for sprite just asked my bar neighbor if he was doing ok. I haven't heard from him since I ordered my food. I think he should've asked me if my drink was ok since I haven't touched it at all. I just asked Jessica, Brent is my BarTender. I was happy to come try this meal here, I'm not as satisfied as I thought I would be. I don't even want the drink anymore, but these wings on, and I learned that I have to scrape the fries to get that twist I was looking for initially. Good day yelpers. 


...Wait,... Brent just asked the bar neighbors to my other side if they were ok. ...totally walked by me again, no words.


Welp,... I won $50+ dollars on the machine so I drank my drink. The security guy at the door was kind as can be. Still hadn't heard from Brent.",A6eI3xr2S5uQq6qZjRFWKw,0,0,3,dxlUCYs2KJC-5A5ffAmbjg

3141367,2017-08-10,1,8ovqtunN8zGdCbYi-MCTAQ,"PT's Gold is always a must every now and then when I want to enjoy a late night happy hour with my co-workers! This has been a tradition for maybe the past few years where we all meet up for a great night of catching up, playing pool, drinking and stuffing our faces with yummy bar food. 

This location was recently remodeled because my most recent experience last week I noticed all of the changes inside the place. Newer flat screen TV's on the wall and a more open concept around the bar! Before this location was a bit unsatisfactory when it came to the bar scene because if you were the person who choose to be seated at the bar anybody who walked behind you would have to squeeze past you literally and brush up against you. Weird right? Well all that is gone because the high table tops allow for more space and you can now fit more people at the tables. They also use to have couches which I actually liked but for whatever reason they have now removed those.. Interesting... 

Our server was probably one of the coolest that we have ever received! Super chill, attentive and gave some great recommendations on some new things to try out! The pool tables are still the same and we lucked out on getting a table on a busy Saturday night! Overall great changes and some things still remain like the security guard that sits at the door and cards you. So just an FYI for all those people underage you will not PASS GO! To everyone else.. Well.. Enjoy! :-)",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,1,0,4,ijdqxCZk-AS9b0EMX7hw0w

I have been a couple of other PT bars but this one was much bigger than the others.

I'm was very spacious and hosted many tables - large screen TVs and the bar was in the epicenter.

As well as having drinks, we ordered pizza and wings and those were surprisingly very good.

3892307,2017-11-18,0,8ovqtunN8zGdCbYi-MCTAQ,"This is honestly the worst bar experience I have ever unfortunately had to experience. My friends and I came in for some drinks and apps and it took them 20 minutes before even coming to our table despite the many times they glanced at our table and just walked away as if we were not there. It was not until I DESPERATELY flagged down someone changing the trash that he came over and said ""oh I'll call someone over"" and the server who was ignoring us the whole time finally came over and asked us ""ok what do you want"" with an attitude.
At this point, having been a server myself, I tried to be understanding of her situation but upon asking her for a menu she snapped back saying ""Well we don't have a menu, I'll just tell you."" This really threw me off because after waiting and being ignored for 20 minutes, this was the last thing I was expecting. 

She took our order and it took them another 20 minutes to bring out our drinks and upon bringing out our drinks she said she forgot mine. I asked her to switch from a ""Long Island iced tea"" to a ""Midori Sour"" since they haven't even made my drink. She tells me okay and after waiting for ANOTHER 20 MINUTES finally brings back our drink--the WRONG DRINK. And after letting her know it was the wrong drink, she started whining that she forgot and said ""Well can you just drink that"". 

I am honestly appalled at this experience and at this extremely terrible experience. After waiting for OVER an hour for my drinks, I would've at least expected an apology. I cannot believe I am expected to pay for something that I DID NOT EVEN ORDER. Will never be returning here.",qsF4rL6wEBY7eHg4VD5zcA,4,0,1,oI-tlEr5ZPKCcc6Ozd5m_A

4061544,2018-02-13,2,8ovqtunN8zGdCbYi-MCTAQ,"I'm not sure what happened since my last visit.  My recent visit was on a Friday (2/9) at 8 PM  and it was nowhere near what I've experienced previously. 

Service Summary:  The center bar was pretty busy so we sat at one of the tables right outside the bar area which was not busy at all. 

20 minutes before our server stopped by to drop off a menu.
15 minutes to return to take our order
After we ordered: 
20 minutes to bring back two draft beers
45 minutes to receive our order of: A chicken Siracha Sandwich and an order of wings. 
There was no sense of urgency and the service overall was disappointing.  

Soon after, we were assigned another server and she was great.  She got our 2nd round of drinks to us immediately and checked on us the rest of the night.

This was like an episode of Bar Rescue.  Unacceptable service at the beginning and a complete 180 in the end.  The renovated bar is fantastic but the service seems to be hit or completely miss based on your server.

4996151,2017-06-22,0,8ovqtunN8zGdCbYi-MCTAQ,"Clean, modern, not too loud, not to quiet place with friendly staff.

 My several visits so far this year have always been around mid-afternoon to mid-evening on weekdays or a Sunday -- I don't know how busy/loud/rowdy the place may get later at night, especially on a Friday or Saturday.

 The location isn't in the greatest part of town, but it's also far from the worst areas.   The parking lot is kinda dark at night, and I've seen a homeless guy loitering at their fence-enclosed Dumpster, like he was living there.

Nice TVs showing a variety of different channels -- I appreciate that they have Fox or CNN on some of the TVs, not just sports.    Plenty of seats around the central bar area, plus tables in a couple sections, and one section with couch-type seating.

 Food & drinks are pretty much standard PTs/lounge type stuff -- good quality, acceptable prices, but the Happy Hour specials are GREAT deals in my opinion.

  The only negative thing I have to offer is that most of the time we were there, there was just one waitress working.   Seems like part of the job of a PT's waitress is to be very friendly & somewhat chatty with the customers -- that's great!  Except if there's just one working & she doesn't see you come in & sit down because she was chatting with other customers, she may not notice you're there, sitting at a table for 5 or 10 minutes.    While that's not a horribly long wait, when you've been outside in the 115+ degree heat for a while & have been dreaming about that refreshing beer or Pear Cider at PT's, that wait is somewhat painful, especially if you know that she's not seen you sitting there yet.       Suggestion: for your first drink(s), get it at the bar, then sit down.

  I hope that at busier times, they have more waitresses on-hand.   I guess the problem with a 24/7 place is that for non prime-time hours they deliberately keep expenses down by minimizing staff.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,0,0,3,TlN1Pa6wsvVAjBVAYaxPrA

About 10 min after I arrived a server came to take my order. She brought it right away. And. Never. Came. Back. I had to flag her down to order an appetizer. 45 minutes later my 7 raviolis came (after I flagged her down to ask about them). My beer was empty for at least 25 min. I had to flag her down for a refill on that too (which I did when I asked about the ravioli). Took at least 15 minutes to get that. I asked for a menu about 4 times, never got one.

Walked into PTS and headed towards the table with my group. It took 20 minutes for them to take our order for drinks. Amanda came to greet us and took our order. Then we waited another 10 minutes even when it wasn't busy for our drinks. We then noticed that the server forgot one of our drinks 30 mins later and we asked her where our drinks were. She then told us she forgot about it because she was fighting with the bartender? Really unprofessional thing to say. 

Waiting for our drinks wasn't the only thing our group and I were upset about. She didn't even apologize and she spills a drink on me and didn't even say sorry and continued to talk to us about how ""gangster"" she was. Like really? Are you going to even apologize or offer a napkin? 

THEN she charges us for gratuity on top of our bill when we've been here numerous times?! Are you going to assume that we are all on one bill? Why charge gratuity when the service wasn't even there?
