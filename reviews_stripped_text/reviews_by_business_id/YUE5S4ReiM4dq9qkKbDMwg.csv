Well to my demise I should have chosen a different restaurant. The service was as slow as ever. Our appetizer order was never submitted. We had to ask another waiter for utensils. When we asked the person who brought our food about our appetizer, the manager brought us the cold shrimp, when we had ordered the steamed shrimp. The dinner was lack luster. I ordered the king crab 32$ for 4 mediocre crab legs. Over priced, slow, horrible service. Derek was our waiter.

169304,2014-05-08,0,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"The food sucked. We left extremely unsatisfied, especially considering that we were super hungry coming in (it wouldn't have taken much to please us). Paid $55 for a meal we didn't finish. Did I mention I was super starving?

Ordered the garlicky butter bake because my boyfriend loves garlic. Turned out to be a disaster. The dish came out much smaller than expected (unlike the picture shown).  The lobster wasn't cleaned, had no flavor, and the meat was way too soft and fell apart. The one small cluster of snow crab legs we got was missing a leg. The corn was bland. The mussels weren't good, either. The garlic flavor leaned towards bitterness... The garlic bread was okay though. 

Also got the skillet paella. It mostly tasted like tomatoes, even with the seafood in it. The worst part was broken pieces of mussel shells were scattered throughout. Unappealing and unappetizing. Like the garlicky butter bake, the best part of the dish was the two pieces of garlic bread (which wasn't even that great).

We were actually here sometime last year and the food wasn't so bad then. I don't know if they changed chefs or what, but it's safe to say that we definitely won't be returning here anytime soon. 

I'm only giving two stars because service was pretty decent -even though they didn't ask us how our food was. I guess they already knew the answer.",olnTacPoKxP_uFRS-__4bQ,3,0,2,3kPu6ukeWt8VdUrk3BFroQ

260754,2014-02-06,0,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"DO NOT EAT HERE! AFTER I ATE HERE ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER I HAD THE RUNS! FOOD WAS AWEFUL, OLD AND DISAPPOINTING! 
The restaurant was empty on a Wed. 10 o'clock PM. Our server was nice, (Chase), knowlegable, however when we complained about the corn it was raw. Chase, explained that it was a different type of corn so they stay firmer when cooked...I never heard of a certain corn that when cooked tasted and felt like RAW CORN when bitten into it. That is a LIE. Later in the conversation he offered to exchange it for another side, we declined. We ordered a Steampot, 2 Lobsters, sausage, 6 shrimps and a pound of clams, 5 Alarm Hurricane Margarita, a captains kid meal. Our meal was horrible! We ate what we could and brought the rest for our dogs to eat since I paid for it. What a waste of money! Your restaurant cooks seafood all day long, how do you get it wrong, your chefs need to be retrained to know that seafood cooks quick and it is imperitive to keep an eye on seafood if cooked too long it becomes RUBBERY! My 19 month old son did not want to eat his food, which was unusual, because he is an eater. So I tried his food horrible the a 1 small piece of fish, OVERFRIED! (The piece of fish was around 2 1/2 inches in length maybe 3 inches at the most.) It seemed like the fish had been refried. Old fish. I was totally disappointed. I did not speak to the manager, it's obvious that it wouldn't have helped to tell anyone. Since the manager must be CLUELESS, the atmosphere was sad. This is probably the worst seafood I have had ever.
The service was not attentive, when asked for a little time to look at the menu I timed him waiting 10 minutes before I looked for him and found him NO where to be found. Waited 5 more min. He was in the kitchen. I finally had to bother the bartender by eye contact only, unlike the others he was doing his job and the servers as well. When the place is empty I expect for the wait staff/server to PAY attention to the 1 customer that he has. I asked for the server for more tartar sauce for my son, (19 months old, he can't speak yet.) Chase brought after I asked a second time. My son tried it and pushed it aside and kept using the empty tartar that he had?! So I told him it's the same thing, and pushed it back to him...but he didn't use it! Puzzled I dipped my finger in the ""tartar"" sauce Chase had brought and to my surprise it was Blu cheese dressing! :0( I feel so cheated I think I spent $60.00 on crappy rubbery lobsters. I will be YELPING THIS BECAUSE SEAFOOD CHAINS LIKE YOURS SHOULD BE EXPERTS AT COOKING SEAFOOD!
*SERGIO the GM called me quick 30 Min. after I posted this review. He apoligized and offered a free meal for our next visit, I told him I will not return, but I feel I deserve my money back. He said he would return my money and asked politely to please give them another chance. He also said to give him a call and let him improve on our next experience. I will go visit again but I do not wanting special treatment, ""I just want good food with good service in a timely manner"" ""THAT'S ALL CUSTOMERS WANT""

811747,2015-01-01,1,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"How to begin this review - I'm at a loss.

My expectations of these national chains of family restaurants must be too high, because I am consistently disappointed with them.  Joe's Crab Shack is no exception.

My grandson picks Joe's every year for his birthday dinner.  I think it's partly because he walks out of there every year with a handful of plastic sharks, and partly because of the playground.  Whatever the reason, he loves the place and because of that, JCS gets 2 stars instead of one. 

The service is mediocre at best, the food is edible but flavorless, and the decor looks like it's all been picked out from yard sales.  On this occasion, we waited more than 45 minutes for our food (for a party of 7, that's an excessive amount of time).  One side salad had croutons, two others did not even though they were identical salads.  My daughter in law ordered her meal with the sauce on the side, but it came drenched in the gooey liquid.  When the waitress was told, all we got was a ""sorry.""  The entree should have been removed from the bill.  I had the Crispy Jumbo Shrimp, and they were anything but crispy or jumbo.  They tasted soggy and bland - fortunately, the cocktail sauce served with them completely muted the flavorless dish.  We also ordered the s'mores dessert, which was pretty tasty.

Bottom line: highly overpriced, marginal quality food, and substandard service.  Go somewhere else - you'll be glad that you did.",pphrt7iAXMjg8QqLHHUA2Q,2,0,2,SPUS4DBb9Qb6eRazG1qnNA
830350,2012-05-17,3,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"Here's the deal.  This place is kind of cheesy, but I was limited in options for dinner, and skeptical about going in.  I'm glad - sort of - that I did.  The place was packed, so that was a good sign, and it seems that regulars really do like when the staff leads the customers in song.  Weird.  I didn't have crab, but I was pleasantly surprised by the salmon with dirty rice.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, again I was surprised. I don't know why I expected so little from Joe's but I enjoyed myself there. And enjoyed the restaurant's selection of beer.  Sam's Summer Ale in Reno?  I'll take it.

One strange moment: I was sitting at the bar enjoying my dinner and a mother, presumably, ordered her infant fruit juice in a sippy cup.  She ordered herself a ""Category 5 Hurricane"".

959956,2016-05-25,1,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"My family attended Joe's as a party of four. First thing to notice is that inside the restaurant it is terribly noisy, not some place you'd want to go if you wanted to actually talk to your fellow diner. However this does perpetuate the party attitude the restaurant holds. We started off with an order if calamari. The calamari was quite good with a generous portion for an appetizer. After our appetizer however we had to wait over 25 minutes for two orders of fish and chips, an order of garlic mussels, chicken club sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder. After finally getting the majority of food, our waiter had forgotten about our order of clam chowder.

As for the food itself, the fish and chips were surprisingly good. The pieces of fish were large in size and more than enough to fill a person up. The only downside is that they were a bit too salty. Everything was a bit too salty. The clam chowder (once we got it), the fish and chips, and the mussels were all too salty. The club sandwich was great. 

If I were to rate just the food, Joe's would receive a 3 out of 5 but their service drops it down to a 2. We had long waits for our appetizer and our entrees. Our waiter hardly came around to check up on us. Our glasses were empty a majority of the time  because of this.

When the food arrived and we started - major letdown.  Since we had the double order, we asked for one King and one 'Queen'.  Couldn't tell the difference,  both were the same and were too small for what was called 'King'.  We eat crab quite often, so are not unfamiliar with good crab. The crab had been frozen too long - the shells were soft; meat was shrunk and taste was bland.  Same thing with the corn.  Too bad - portions were good but overall quality a big disappointment.   Too many other good crab places within  Las Vegas area for your dollars. 
Last year we went to a Joe's Crab Shack in Laughlin Golden Nugget where everything was much better quality.  We won't be back at this Rainbow location.",AcFYDaFlZ6jEWl1Gjc20Pg,2,1,1,Zquayjt4ayR00G_Putqs-Q

Regarding the food, the amount of seafood you get for the price of a stream pot is very small, there were more potatoes than anything else with a very small loster tail, 3 shrimp and two small crab legs that even for a chain restaurant there should be more quantity to justify the price. The second entree of a crab cake sandwich was more breading in the cake that it seemed like a bread patty on a bun.
The more serious issue was regarding our bill. Our check was $60 and we left a $11 tip in cash, but when my bf checked his bank statement that night he noticed that his card was charged $72! He called and told the manager that the charge wasn't correct and we left a cash tip so why was $12 added to his bill. After some sort of excuse that their pos system puts an automatic tip on that gets corrected at the end of the night ( which I know it's not how it's done) he was told it would be corrected. The charge was corrected the next day, however if he hadn't caught it who knows. I work in food and beverage and know that systems don't work like that and it happens when the server edits their tips. Either way, I don't like the idea that either knowingly or not that extra money was charged when cash was given. Seems sketchy to me and unfortunately I won't be back.",AbaO6D183QuKbdFn_VDqCA,0,0,1,_2PTFC-kRV9O5naV5i1yZg

1568974,2012-08-09,0,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"Just came here yesterday for my birthday.

The atmosphere is ideal for kids. This location on Rainbow and Lake Mead has a playground outside for kids to play in. Although its Las Vegas and it's hot out, kids will be kids and will not allow the heat to deter them from playing on it.
Upon arrival the hostess wasn't as friendly as a hostess should be, but our server definitely made up for that. Our server Lacy was awesome. She had a positive bubbly attitude. She was so helpful and super friendly. I really appreciate her as my server. 

I ordered an appetizer of a bucket of 18 shrimps. Although the shrimps were a little on the smaller side, dipping it in the cocktail sauce made it delicious. Only problem was that the seasoning was smuthered on the outside of the shell on the shrimp. When the shell is peeled off, the Old Bay seasoning went along with it. 

For main course, i ordered the new Queen crab. The queen crab was new and was supposedly in season and was the most popular item, so I ordered that with the garlic herb spice. The crab was disappointing when it came out. The meat was described as meaty and juicy on the menu. When arrived, the shell sure looked big, but when cracking it open, the meat was tiny and unfulfilling. I don't recommend the queen crab. The meat was a little on the dry side. The flavoring was a disappointment. I recommend making your own sauce with lemon juice, tobasco, and pepper. 

The stuff snapper was an item that was also order, and it was delicious! the crab meat on top of the snapper gave the fish a delightful taste. 

The kids menu was good with a variety of burgers and chicken suitable for kids with a choice of vegatable or fries. Beware: there are no refills on juices or milk. I suggest ordering a soda or lemonade if your kids are thirsty from playing outside in the playground.

Since it was my birthday, the people who brought me here expected a free dessert. They DO NOT offer a free dessert, even for your birthday. What they do offer is a song and pony ride. They came out and sang a birthday song, expecting for me to gallop around restaurant. I believe this is geared more towards kids and an adult. Although embarassing, the kids found it fun and entertaining. 

All and all i give this place a 4 star.",DC9yjg6hluUKtBdmvVWiVg,0,0,4,JXQWvg8A33qcM8W19LReng

We used to frequent Joe's Crabshack. During the rough economy we watched the portions get smaller, crab clusters coming out with 2 & 3 legs on them and the size getting smaller. We vowed to never return.

Fast forward 2 years or so and we figured we would see if things had changed. They did. For the worse. The crab now are so small I honestly think they are buying juvenile crab from poachers that are illegal to catch. You know? The ones that you are supposed to throw back? 

Well that was the final straw. No matter how much we missed the BBQ crab, we will not return. 

After spending $100 on dinner for 2, I had to go next door to Famous Dave's for a burger. $11 for an actual meal. I would have had to order 10 crab buckets @ $22.99 each to make a meal at Joe's. Disappointing to say the least.",1NQR1TcXQLl9tW4OU9pHRw,1,0,1,5fA90BEEPspJzhylHbFR0g

My tip is always based on the service, not the quality if the food or the wait time to get the food. I began to decrease the tip amount when the service begins to fall below normal ""good"" service.
My daughter, her boyfriend, and I visited Joe's Crab Shack on 9/18, arriving at 11:00 am. Since it had just opened, there were very few customers in the restaurant. Our server, a young man, came over quickly to take our drink orders. Although he was not very friendly, he was efficient & brought the drinks in a reasonable length of time. He came back once to refill our drinks.
My issue started when we finished our meal. There were still very few customers in the restaurant. We sat for at least 15 minutes trying to get our waiters attention to bring our check. He seemed to avoid looking in our direction. My daughter finally walked over to the hostess to request our waiter be sent to our table.  The tip went down, at that point to 15%.

However, that is about the best I can say for Joe's Crab Shack. The hostess became our waitress and it was obvious that everyone was in a hurry, even though the restaurant was only 1/3 full. She checked on us frequesntly to get our order, only reread off the menu to answer our questions and after the food quickly arrived she was almost no where to be seen. We were each given 1 refill on our drinks without being asked if we wanted them or anything else. The steampot was a joke, and after making it known she had the manager come over who did nothing but joke around. 

I ordered the fish and shrimp. The fish was lightly breaded, but crumbled apart when I tried to eat it. Fish did not have the best flavor either. The shrimp was great, but then I was again disappointed in the fries as they were not crispy, but limp and chewy. 

Husband ordered the steampot with crab legs, veggies and sausage. Sausage and veggies were great! Crab legs were absolutely dismal. The snow crab legs were short and extremely thin, like a ball point pen. The queen crab legs were a bit better than the snow crab, but not by much. It was more work to get out what little meat was even there than it was worth. Horribly overpriced, not filling, poor value. 

We ordered the fish and chips for our daughter from the kid's menu, which was the best value in our order. Her fish was beer battered, crispy, very tasty. The fries were the same, limp and chewy.

I was curious to see how this place would differ from Red Lobster and other seafood restaurants. It was great! When we arrived, we were quaintly seated in a booth. Our server, Andrea, was the best. She wasn't like some waiters who wanted to be out of there. She genuinely (or at least she had the feeling of) wanted to take care of us and wanted us to have a wonderful time. The array of menu selections seemed to look ordinary and we thought it would be the same as R. Lobster.

We ordered the starter appetizer that had the calamari, dip, and poppers. It was delicious. We were all scrambling for the last piece of chip to dip. 

The courses, though it tasted great to me, wasn't of the best taste to my parents.

My mother ordered one of the seafood platters and thought it tasted okay at first. Unfortunately, when she bit into one of her scallops, it was mostly batter and a pebble sized scallop in the middle. My father, though he enjoyed his fresh seafood bucket, felt the ""fresh seafood"" was lacking. As he ate his crab, he said it tasted overcooked and that it had hardly any meat in it.

I, on the other hand, had a great experience. I also had a seafood platter which included the.crab cake, crab stuffed shrimp, onion strips, and fish and chips. The crab cake, stuffed shrimp, and onion strips were delicious, but what amazed me was the fish from the fish and chips. The fish was battered and fried just enough so that it didn't taste like batter. It was also VERY crispy which made it taste even better. That was the best fish I had. 

While waiting for our meal, the employees engaged in playful dancing that enjoyed everyone at Joe's.

I can't believe the cook is employed there! WRONG COOK! He doesn't have a clue of what he is doing.

On the first visit, I shared a steam pot with my boyfriend. Our server was great but the food was extremely salty. For almost $50, we expected enough food to at least be satisfied, but we left hungry. 

Tonight we returned, and he and I chose separate menu items in the hopes that the food quality/quantity would be better. I think it was worse! The iced tea was watery, the food was bland, and they charged over $14 for like 10 tiny shrimps, a small portion of soggy broccoli, and a scoop of pico rice that tastes better coming from Del Taco. To top it all off, our server was inattentive and we had to call him over for multiple things because being polite didn't work on him (We hate ""summoning"" servers; we know you're busy. We aren't impatient people. But if you are ignoring one of your FOUR tables, there's a problem.) He collected the check and his $15 tip without even saying goodbye. Either he's just totally rude or someone needs to train him better. 

Anyway. I don't want to come here again anytime soon. We're better off spending money at a cheap buffet for seafood.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,7,1,1,CERom3rmzGIFBcczJ0zW0A
2360473,2016-08-25,0,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"We travel to Las Vegas a couple of times each year. This time we were in the mood for seafood and decided on Joe's Crab Shack. We've eaten at a number of these in a number of different places over the years and always enjoyed the crab pots. The one here in Las Vegas is pretty much a cookie-cutter version of most of the others.

We were pretty early. We asked for a table in the bar area for happy hour but they only had four tables and all were taken. They offered us a seat at the bar but my wife is not physically able to get up on or sit on those high bar stools, and they would not accommodate us with a booth adjacent to the booths in bar area... Apparently somebody else's seating area. No exceptions. 

Other than that the meet, greet, and seat was per usual. The server came over and took our drink orders, brought menus, and since we were having our usual, the crab bucket done with the fire grilled spices, she took our appetizer and dinner order as well. 

Everything arrived within a reasonable timeframe. And true to form, mussels (appetizer) and the Andouille sausage was excellent, as were the shrimp, potatoes, and corn on the cob. Absent were the clams though. Must be a cost cutting measure. The crab was good but a little mushier than we are used to getting from Joe's Crab Shacks. 

Our server less attentive than most of the servers we have ever had at any Joe's. She just kind of set things down and flittered off, only stopping by to check on us once. Not much for words. After dinner she just dropped off our check and disappeared ... Oh well, we will do dessert at home...

The food was good enough. Our server wasn't. But we will eat here again. We will just make sure to get a different server.",VqqWco9k-CPcQKFfLj4Jjg,0,0,3,7WEpYpDkRIsCisv_AMzzmQ

Been here a handful of times and I'm just not a fan of joes crab shack. Feel like seafood? Check out boiling crab or hot n juicy!

Anyways while we were waiting a little boy who was with his family went to go ask the hostess how much longer. I believe his family sent him. I went up there to ask how much longer the same time. The hostess( blonde hair, young, and had a nose piercing) was not even acknowledging the people walking up. They had to talk to her. The little boy finally got her attention and ask how much longer. She holds up the two sheets full of names and says this is how many people are waiting. The little boy walks away and tells his family. Mom was furious and speaks to the manager. The hostess heard everything and wasn't too happy. Everyone of her co workers that walked up she told what had happened and even pointed at the lady who complained!
I just found it to be very unprofessional and rude. My friend and I both work in a restaurant and there is no way that would have been allowed. I understand it's crazy busy, but that girls behavior was ridiculous. When she called our name, she tells us wow you guys get a booth. That's what you get for being patient. I don't know what she meant by that. 

Next off the food. Anything fried there is pretty good. I don't eat unhealthy but I figure it valentines day, so wth. My friend and I shared the sampler! It was pretty good. I asked for a Caesar salad sub balsamic dressing on the side. I reminded him twice and it still came out wrong. Our waiter (an older gentleman) knew too but chose not to say anything and I didn't want to complain.  So I ate it. I gave this a low rating because I don't plan on returning,   The food is not that good.

What they may lack in decor and sophisticated table settings (it's paper towels, buckets and bibs on a wood table) Joe's Crab shack makes up for in real quality seafood. 

The server Eddie was great and the manager Paul were both very accommodating and checked up on us.

We came to Joe's Crab Shake to stuff our faces with what else crabs because you can't just come here and eat a burger! The location is On N Rainbow Blvd and West Mead Blvd, you seriously can't miss it considering there is a light up sign that says ""Joe's Crab Shack,"" with an arrow pointing to the restaurant. 

Once seated, you can get a good view of how this restaurant is set up. There is tons of seating, and the décor is nautical, it honestly reminds me of how some of the seafood restaurants in NY that are on boardwalks with a beachy vibe. 

Our server was pretty awesome and told us everything we needed to know about this place, the various ways to have your crab cooked or season and the rest of menu. I ordered the KJ Steam Pot, which is snow crab, mussels, scallops, corn, and potatoes cooked in a Kendall Jackson wine sauce. 

I really loved the flavoring of the crab it really did not need to be dunked in butter because it was seasoned perfectly. However the mussels did, for some reason they were sort of bland- everything else in the pot was the bees knees though.

This was my first time at a Joe's ever, and I look forward to coming back, I'll have to try something else next time I dine here.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,2,2,5,TiXPAoLXKAGLJa9klXM6Ig

Our waitress Selma was extremely courteous and so was the management and hostess.  However, there were menus laying on the floor and a few waiters just decided to walk over them without picking them up.  Also, the scallops in my dish were not cooked properly AT ALL!  They were almost charred black. I know they're difficult to cook for someone inexperienced but they literally looked like they were rolled all around the grill.

3301381,2016-06-13,1,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"Let me start by saying, I really want to like this place.  I came once several years ago and did not have a positive experience, so we decided to give it a shot for a Sunday lunch, maybe the experience years ago was a fluke. 

We walked in and the atmosphere was great, the people were extremely friendly and we were seated quickly.  We were seated in a booth that had good views of several televisions, as well as the interesting decor around the dining room, and the board with the specials.  Unfortunately, the dining room was extremely cold, and just seemed to get colder the longer we sat there...so off to the patio we went.  Sunshine, a light breeze, and now the pleasant lunch is back on track because we can concentrate on the food and not our teeth chattering. 

Out appetizers arrive at out abel, the Garlicky Mussels, and they were phenomenal.  If you like garlic and mussels they are perfect.  Enough garlic in these things to make you vampire proof for days, but that is how I like them.  After a short time, our entrees also arrived.  Unfortunately, there is not as much positive to say about the entrees.  One platter included fish and chips, stuffed shrimp, and a crab cake.  Everything looked fine upon arrival, but the plate was so hot that the sauces provided were breaking in the containers they were in.  When we dove into the dish, everything was bland.  There was no distinct flavor to anything.  The other entree we received was one of their advertised specials, with a pound of lime shrimp.  Again, there was botany real flavor to the dish.  

The food itself was not bad, but had no flavor.  Given the different textures of fish and seafood, this made for an extremely odd meal.  This place needs to add some flavor to their food to live up to the great service their staff provides.  I may try it again because of how awesome the staff was, but I think next time I may stick with appetizers.",9ewxsYQPtbV1EpulX6BdCA,1,0,2,ZdybpVJtEJPObpYd1gjJ3Q

The positives are the drinks, which are tasty and reasonably priced, and the apps.  We had a sampler on both visits and they were great.  The rest of the food? Only so so.  

I had one of their fried shrimp dishes the first time, which was ok but not great, and tried the crapcakes on the second visit, which were middling at best. Kind of tasted like pre-made ones you'd get frozen to be honest. On our most recent visit, my wife had their seafood soufle thing (forget what it was called).  The seafood and cheese sauce were tasty, but it had a bread topping that was so thick the dish was pretty much predominately bread. 

Service was decent on each visit, but the ambience is pretty much non-existent.

Calamari to start as an appetizer. It was rather greasy than crispy. Portion was generous but that doesn't say much when you just get a basket full of greasy mess.

I ordered Maine Grill ($26). For a second I thought it was a good deal because according to the server, it comes with a plate filled with lobsters, bacon wrapped shrimps and scallop with dirty rice. 

Dirty rice is way too salty. It is so salty that I kept needing to ask for a water refill. Lobster? Barely any meat on them. Mostly shell that made the plate look full. It's ridiculous how there's barely anything on the plate, just a plate full of empty shells to add to a good presentation. 

Also got a bucket of King's Crab ($32). You get to choose a flavor and we went with garlic herb. This was definitely worth it. 

Lastly I got their Blackened Mahi Tacos ($11) to go. Although the grilled mahi was a nice big piece, it was dry and tacos overall were bland.

We sat in the outdoor dining area, complete with wooden picnic tables and located next to a sandy-filled play area which the kids loved and so did I.  This was the perfect lure.

I was able to take my time and read the menu, order a cocktail (complete with a toy shark) and we enjoyed some steamed King Crab Legs (which I highly recommend), a side of scallops (which were teeny tiny) and some corn on the cob and potatoes. 

Overall the menu and the service was enjoyable. I loved the kids menu which also offered crab legs!  I love a kids menu that features the restaurant specialties and not just a frozen heat up plate of nuggets.

Wasn't terribly impressed by this place. The whole experience was very average bordering on below average. Got seated in what I can only assume to be the bar area because they asked, (didn't card) if we were over 21.

We ordered:

Cup of Clam Chowder- 3/5 Decent cup of clam chowder but it was really gritty which I don't like, but other than that the flavor was good.

Shrimp Alfredo- 2/5 One it was penne pasta not Alfredo. Two the shrimp were under cooked to the point where I was too scared to eat them so I just left them on the side of the plate. Three the Alfredo sauce was missing something. I don't know what it was but it just fell short.

Grilled Shrimp Salad- 4/5 This wasn't bad. We didn't like that it came with hush puppies in the actual salad but those were easy to pick out.

Maybe we should've gotten crab, but for the prices we saw the amount of crab people were getting and it just didn't seem worth it to pay that much for such a small portion of Crab.

Our very expensive bill - for a 'shack' was over 70.00 for two people. I had the $12.99 fish and chips, with a ton of salty chips and the batter on the fish was so heavy it was inedible. It also had a weird sweet taste that was almost like pancake batter. My husband ordered the pasta and chicken for $16.99. I get it, it's not an Italian restaurant. But for boxed penne pasta and well done frozen chicken, a meal fit for Burger King. The salt level in this plate of dog food was enough to clean the roads of Mt. Charleston after a good snow.

4484693,2017-01-08,7,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"The first new restaurant of the New Year, and it can only get better.

I used to pass a Joe's all the time on my way to I-95 in central New Jersey.  It never beckoned to me then, and that didn't change when I saw the one on Rainbow here in Vegas.

But when we were invited to dinner here, I figured, why not give it a try?  So I'll tell you why not.

First, a disclaimer:  I did not have the crab.  It could very well be that what has kept them in business lo these many years is that they offer fabulous crab.  And that's why I've given them two stars, just in case that's the case.  It wouldn't be fair to ding them on their eponymous coup de table (I made up that French term, but it may really exist) without trying it.  I like crab cakes, if they're not mostly breadcrumbs, but that's where my love affair with the crustacean ends.  Besides, it's not polite to order the most expensive items on the menu when someone else is footing the bill.  Unless that someone else is a billionaire. 

Second, the ambiance:  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  Old, with peeling paint.  You get the drift.  I would be supremely embarrassed to invite anyone to dinner here.

So I ordered chicken, of the herb and lemon variety.  I also broke my own ""no fried, no salt"" New Year's Resolution that I didn't make and got deep fried pickles as one of the sides.  But a twinge of conscience had me go with steamed broccoli as the other side.  My husband, the copycat and chicken-all-day-every-day guy, also ordered the same chicken, except with sweet potato fries, well-done, please, and corn on the cob.

The chicken:  Yes, Virginia, there was some chicken with the salt.  So. Much. Salt. Nothing but salt.  Herb, who is never sensitive to that condiment, was gagging, but ate it anyway.  I gave up after half of it.  

The sweet potato fries:  Decent taste, but soggy.

The broccoli:  What broccoli?  The waitress returned to tell me that they had no broccoli, but were putting up a corn for me.  What if I didn't want corn?  I decided to go for it, and the unadulterated, UNSALTED, corn was just as corn on a cob should be.  What else can you say about plain corn except that it was cooked?

The service:  No real complaints, except that we did wait a long time at the beginning.  

I never like to say ""never,"" but I can state unequivocally this time that, to paraphrase the immortal words of the second Mrs. de Winter in Hitchcock's Rebecca, ""I shall never return to Joe's Crab Shack.""",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,6,6,2,4x1NlFeHF07FN-VwilCdQg

4655328,2014-06-12,9,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"Why did I rate Joe's Crab Shack 3 stars when I rated In-N-Out Burger 4 stars in my last review? Interesting since Joe's Crab Shack is a casual dining restaurant that I get to visit once in awhile as a treat whereas In-N-Out Burger is a fast food establishment that I would normally dine in. The answer is employee enthusiasm. When I spend $6 in In-N-Out, the employees greet me with enthusiasm. However, when I spent $23 in Joe's Crab Shack you could kind of say the waitress was like a crab. The waitress wasn't nasty or bad at her job. She gave me the impression that she didn't want to be there. When I write reviews, I push on customer service and cheerful employees. Attitude could make or break my ratings.

  The fact that I was disappointed in the waitress's friendliness shouldn't have been. When I originally set foot in a Joe's Crab Shack in Orlando, Florida the restaurant was overflowing with a good times vibe. All the employees were friendly and at the top of the hour they'd dance. Enjoying an upbeat atmosphere over tasty seafood was my kind of scene. Joe's Crab Shack had a name for good times and seafood. It was a name that would draw me into a Joe's Crab Shack on vacation. When I moved to Las Vegas, the Henderson location lived up to the name. But in life things happened and Joe's Crab Shack disappeared from my life. On Sunday, when my brother and I were hanging out in Barnes & Noble, I was like, ""Joe's Crab Shack is a block away on Rainbow. Let's try it.""

  When we stepped foot in the restaurant,  which also sells gifts by the way; it was sparsely populated for a Sunday late afternoon. The hostess was friendly. If the waitress had had the hostess' s attitude this review would of taken a different tone.

  I ordered the Big Shrimp combo. The dish featured coconut shrimp, fried shrimp, and stuffed crab shrimp with fries and cole slaw. Over the years the menu must of changed. It wouldn't be surprising since the personality of Joe's Crab Shack had. Kind of like the waitress' s attitude, the Big Shrimp combo leaves me unenthusiastic. Why? Two of the three types of shrimp were breaded. Breaded shrimp reminds me of Mrs. Paul's. And I could just walk into aisle 2 of Walmart to pick it up. Now the stuffed crab shrimp was delicious. The thing is it was tiny in proportion to the breaded shrimps and fries. In my honest opinion, Joe's Crab Shack would have been smart to follow Red Lobster's example of giving a choice of shrimps and less breaded shrimp. For the record, the fries and cole slaw was delicious. When all is said and done, the Big Shrimp Combo with a Coke and tip wasn't worth $23. 

   Dining out is precious. I work hard for my money and deserve to eat in a restaurant where the waitress wants to be. In reality, it will be at least 6 months until I patronize this location. Red Lobster, Bubba Gump, and lets face it In-N-Out Burger are better choices.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,17,11,3,BPRlCZ-Z_yRwWNe69V3zdA

We were greeted immediately by the host who was extremely animated and welcoming. He sat us at a booth and our waitress Zuri came over to introduce her. Zuri was amazing! Probably the best waitress I've had in a very long time. She was extremely nice, attentive, efficient and had a great personality. She deserves 5 stars for her service.

I was not impressed with the food. The menu makes the dishes look really good and impressive! However when the food comes out, it's another story. We ordered the bucket of Cajun shrimp which was overly salty! The shrimp were not of good quality and the shell was hard to peel off. (They were too steamed and the shells were extremely thin and stuck to the shrimp) The Ragin Cajun Steam Pot was decent. The crab were of good size, the shrimp were better of the ones in the bucket of shrimp and the seasoning was tasty. Although the steam pot was ok, I don't think I would come back here for the food. 

The ambiance was good. It was a fun place to sit with friends and catch up over drinks. A good place for families and kids (there is a play ground for kids).

Although we saw her clean the table when we sat down it was not done thoroughly and my spouse put her hand into what appeared to be drawn butter that had dripped onto the table and had somewhat solidified (at least I hope that's what it was).  We flagged down a person who quickly got a bus person to come and clean the table again.  The person used a hot steamy towel this time and made sure it was very clean.  I got the Joe's Classic steam pot with garlic and a cup of gumbo.  The gumbo was okay; I've had better at other local seafood restaurants.  The corn on the cob and potatoes were okay; somewhat bland.  Even though I had requested garlic, they still sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on the seafood.  The garlic flavor was very minimal.  So, I'm wondering if they gave me the Old Bay seasoning and not the garlic & herb I had ordered.  There were two different kinds of crab legs.  I could not tell you which legs were the dungeness vs. snow, so I'll explain it by size.  The larger legs were flavorful.  The smaller ones had very soft shells and very little meat inside the legs and were almost a waste of time.  The shrimp were okay; rather bland like the corn and potatoes.  The drawn butter and salt helped kick up the flavor with the bland items.  The service was pleasant but slow at times.  I'm not thrilled on the prices but I understand to have seafood in the desert, there is a lot of overhead cost to get it here.  I would like to see more happy hour food choices and possibly more daily specials.

 This was my first and last time visiting a Joe's Crab Shack.  The food itself was barely edible. I ordered a Sam Adams Steam Pot.  My lobster was over-cooked, and the clams included were about the size of a nickel. Laughable.  

My fiance ordered the KJ Steampot. This was appealing being scallop lovers, and the scallops pictured on the menu looked quite large and terrific. However, those were not the scallops we received. The scallops we received were rubbery, and about the size of a quarter.

I watched the cook put my FRESH chowder in the microwave oven. My husband had one of the crab and shrimp buckets and the shrimp was not deveined yuck again. The server Michael and the martini was great but nothing else.",uXHrW0OiQ1GS1pKHoNZvmw,0,0,3,D46UMcOyt_hsD-DhGrWbfA

Service is great! 

Try the Joes Famous BBQ seasoning on the Dungeness crab! It's the only seasoning I order on my crab! Delicious!! Also their crab dip is so goooood!

Also they have an amazing happy hour Mon-Fri 3-7 at the bar!!

I have never had a bad experience here. Make sure to sign up for their email club, they send you great coupons!",I0pt09WSTu4HUys2n5feVw,0,0,5,_owKEXaeG6Mj9pOytvQ2uA

The portions are really small compared to places like Hot N Juicy or the Boiling Crab. Service was also a little slow.,f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,4,2,3,_HrVWhHdFK1b_wRX9fIvmA

Every time we come to the mainland, we go to Joe's. Some times are better than others. This time? Exceptional!
Our server, Monique, was awesome!!! Such great energy!!! She put smiles on all of our faces as soon as we sat down! She was always their with a smile and conversation when we wanted it, left us alone when we were busy talking or eating, and always available if we needed anything. Smart, friendly, and beautiful, We all loved her!
Paul, the manager, personally checked on us and thanked us for choosing Joe's. He was so genuinely friendly, not just doing his job. 
I was very impressed with the service!!!
Queen crab - Fire grilled: a winner to the nth degree! The crab was so sweet that I didn't need any butter (and I really  butter!)! The corn was crisp and juicy, the potatoes, perfectly done! The ""Sunset Fire Grilled"" style, rub, sauce, whatever, left me licking my fingers!
Go to Joe's Crab Shack on N. Rainbow Rd in Las Vegas, if you have a chance! Ask for Monique and you won't be disappointed!",wtx9MnAqFXb1Xay1EHVTtw,1,1,5,wLzz6KHajtbbE5SGJqH9qg

I like that they have patio seating if you want to be outside.

The food I did have was some of my friends nachos which they gave a big helping of and it tasted good. I also ordered a strawberry and (mango?) smoothie. It cooled me down. I also had to try the root beer float and was not disappointed! I also tried a bite of a fish burger and it tasted good.

I definitely have to go back and order my own food next time hahaha. I give 3 stars for decent food and good service.",1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA,3,2,3,xjS3UFyqYybtw6Apug8Ctw

And just sub par quality overall. Went to red lobster few weeks after this and got way more crab for less money. This place is just low quality in general.

The bacon on the bacon wrapped stuffed shrimp was half cooked.  The fish was soggy with grease and barely warm.  A shame because JCS used to be decent...but then it was 70% empty on a Saturday night so that speaks volumes. The bill for my dinner and coke was $21.

Snarky, young, and stupid wait staff seem to be the norm. Purchased an appetizer and drinks and the little wench brought us out our meal meal immediately after giving us our appetizer and then grunted and groaned that she could put it in the back and bring it out again later, not offering to let us enjoy sour appetizer and drinks and bring us a fresh meal in 10-15 minutes or so. WTF? Of course we said no with that kind of offer. WTF? So sorry to put you out, you drain on society. This young woman is the one millennial who gives the millennial generation such a crappy reputation! WTF? Sorry for my rant - in the future if you need a seafood fix and don't want to spend a lot of money $$$$, the seafood chain to choose is Red Lobster.

5838475,2017-01-27,0,YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,"Arrived around 7:00 on a Thursday evening with a party of six.  Waited about 10 minutes for an available table.  We were six business associates so being seated at a booth was a little bit of a squeeze, but fortunately we knew each other well.  Turns out the table was a bit small for the food we ordered and six adults were battling elbows all evening.
The service was fast, friendly and efficient.  I had the soup and salad, hard to mess that up, right. The salad was good as was the corn muffin, but the baked potato soup was somewhat lacking in flavor.  The meat entrees for the rest of the table were well received, but since barbecue sauces of various flavors are supplied on the table, we didn't understand why the mat came slathered with some other sauce that overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.
In general it was an enjoyable meal albeit in very close quarters.",Bsk7--6o5Zz3n99vayiNFw,0,1,3,noZkIdoDhGvB88-RwAzRXQ

My Mahi-mahi was dry, the ""mango"" pico was gross plus it wasn't even mango someone used pineapple. They forget what they advertise...when we walked in I noticed the board above the hostess station. It's stated that if you follow them on Instagram & post a photo, show your server get a free appetizer. I did just that....she tells me she needed to speak w/ the manager. Comes back & asks for me to show her where I saw this because the manager didn't think it was up there. I agreed an lead the way to the hostess stand & showed her. She went to the back again & out walks the manager to check with his own two eyes. I got my free appetizer & have not been back.",rwxIAhvgoYQZr6VNz1lvhA,4,0,1,PomvnwqYKhy1QW8IETniTQ

My date and I both enjoyed our dinners. Portions are good sized for the price, which you expect when you get off ""the Strip."" We asked to sit outside although it was a little breezy, but the atmosphere was so worth it. When we got near the end of the meal, the server dropped the check and said he'd be back for it. No mention of coffee, after dinner drink, or the slightest suggestion of a favorite dessert. He just assumed we were done, maybe he shift was almost over? 
  Also, the manager came by during our meal to check on everything and introduce himself. That was a wonderful surprise and rarely happens in Vegas! Good for you Joe's! That is a personal touch!",TaoEnQkieSPZpbUzuufR1w,0,0,4,wBaN0hdVcltNb44lpQr8WA

We ordered the crab dip and it tasted like fish dip... Horrible. 
Lobster bisque soup.... Bland and tasted nothing like lobster.  
Fish and chips were bland. We were both really disappointed by the whole meal. I don't know what happened to them but I'm done. I already told FB and I'm telling yelp now, don't waste your $$.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE. WE USE TO LOVE IT.

OH and the server girl was nice and attentive but knew nothing about the food... We asked what kind of beer was used for the batter on the fish... She said she would ask and never came with a answer. I am also a server and pride myself on knowing my menu!!! So after finding out she had been with the company a while and was still clueless... Was sad.
