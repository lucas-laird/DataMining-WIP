Thanks to the other girl who was working there she has a exelent customer service.

5233326,2018-02-06,0,ZGwOOa93pc5hnsCLUgJJpQ,I always drive pass 5-7 locations on my way here because each time I come here the service is amazing and they really pack the sandwiches the way I like it. Extremely clean location and their has always been a worker sweeping or wiping down tables when I visit. Francia I believe was our sandwich maker and she handled our order professionally which isn't something I usually say for a fast food restaurant! Ingredients are always fresh and they always have fresh cookies and soft bread! Love this location 10/10 each time so far.,PeggnzOiy0tDQDpWNv0kQw,0,0,5,DmP9EZxc3_SqE9iRdOVzjg
