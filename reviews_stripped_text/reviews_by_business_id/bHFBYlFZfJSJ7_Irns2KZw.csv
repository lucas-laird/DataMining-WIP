Try the turkey croissant combo, it's really fresh and it packs a lot of flavor.",0yAO5zlg11jnERm_yPM9Wg,0,0,5,OALh6il2r4ocWOcYcSwyhA
1286233,2016-09-18,0,bHFBYlFZfJSJ7_Irns2KZw,Definitely a must stop if you're in the Boulevard Mall. My favorite item from this cafe is the Horchata Smoothie. Everything in the smoothie is blended together very well. The Horchata Smoothie is one of my favorite drinks from this cafe as it's very delicious and decadent! The individuals who work at Cafe Viva are very nice and attentive! Everything about Cafe Viva is excellent!,RHhnse_8Icd2KkAvR3x6MA,0,0,5,1bjj180oaS4U3edFUd69jw
1617471,2014-07-16,2,bHFBYlFZfJSJ7_Irns2KZw,"Solid café counter at the Boulevard Mall food court- hot and cold coffee drinks, gourmet loose leaf teas, paninis, and all-day breakfast items including pancakes. 

Coffee drinks are solid, love that they offer mint mocha flavor year-round instead of seasonally. Paninis look great and are well-priced at about $5-6, turkey option and chipotle chicken look amazing.

Staff is super friendly and look like they genuinely enjoy their jobs- engaged me in conversation while making my drink just before close, rather than rushing through and cleaning.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,3,vmtncS3j90LTLiXy77IBzw

1975893,2013-07-31,1,bHFBYlFZfJSJ7_Irns2KZw,"This is a bright spot in The Boulevard mall.  It's quaint, with authentic atmosphere and an independent feel that makes me happy to support it and keep coming back.

I often spend at least a day a week in the boulevard mall, and before I would have to settle for restaurant coffee or some other terrible machination.  But no more.   Now I can get barista quality and enjoy a nice view of the mall from one of their many chairs.  There's wifi, a tv, and plenty of small tables to set your laptop on if you need to get some work done.

Stop in sometime if you happen to find yourself at this mall or on this side of town, you shouldn't find yourself disappointed.",3Apvsrrf4wJuG4NdwIfXwA,0,0,5,zjmrmIISy63Nfjd8DYB45g
2022744,2017-04-14,0,bHFBYlFZfJSJ7_Irns2KZw,"We quickly stopped by here to just to grab coffee. Yes kinda weird to stop at a mall just for coffee,  bit that tells you the coffee AND service is good. The workers there a genuinely nice. 
The cool thing to know is the mall is under construction. The blvd mall is currently building a movie theatre. This will dramatically increase the business. 
This coffee house house serves food too. Another yummy experience.
One thing I would mention ask to lower the amount of sweet pumps into your coffee if you love the taste of espresso. Also the drip coffee is served a bit too hot, but again the flavor is there.",dEkS9SauP57PP9NSrkHbPA,1,1,4,kZh90S6ZbvZpjmo_DUgLFg

Perfect place to stop and get a quick bite to eat! Thank you Viva Café! Staff were friendly and well-informed about their menu",yZTyVjqgIrUU0c-zkADpXw,0,0,5,jAq_S3OG3IO3CeaWF_kTXA
3306059,2018-04-06,3,bHFBYlFZfJSJ7_Irns2KZw,"Great breakfast spot. I got their low cal sandwich and I was expected something dry and healthy but it was delicious! They toasted the wheat bread and the egg white, cheese and spinach were perfectly match. I also got matcha thinking it was tea but turned out to be matcha latte. It was a little on the sweet side. The menu did not mention it is matcha latte so I think they should clarify. The cafe was kind of difficult to find as it is located in a corner of a random mall (plaza) Price was not bad, I got full with my sandwich.",jl9c3cv0kxy62E8NL7pnzA,7,5,4,_1oEBlXiloifqaiEzmlTHg

Fucking turns out I had fantastic espresso that ranks really high for me. I cant really say anything about the food here but the iced coffee and simple espresso shots are pretty fuckin great jfc.",xS4eeHlnIyGdyo2qnI9d4Q,0,0,5,vDZKezmG1daXkJL3zwiL6w
3837753,2016-03-20,1,bHFBYlFZfJSJ7_Irns2KZw,"I don't have much to say, but the service was quick and the girl up front was very patient and incredibly nice. I ran in very quickly to grab a drink during my shift. I was thirsty, and felt like a quick drink. Purchased a canned juice and a green milk tea. 

Canned juice had a cold and chilly exterior, but for some reason the juice inside was warm. It was weird. Not that pleasant. But who cares, it's canned juice. 

The tea was excellent. Ordered a green milk tea; wonderful color, awesome flavor, and quick preparation. Icy cold, crystal clear ice (I'm very anal about that), and a decent size for the mall pricing (about $4.00). 

I definitely intend to return.",2YOWAF4_uQZ3ToABzRh4hA,2,1,4,Dx6_Wwcfm3v0DI6-DpEjPA

I have gotten the iced Mocha and the Chi tea. Both have been made spot on and are delicious. They aren't fancy or anything out of the ordinary, but the lady that made them for me actually took the time to make sure it was made correctly and that I liked how it tasted. 

I've only dealt with one lady at this location and she has been so friendly and nice toward me. Answered any questions I had, took my order effectively, was very courteous, and had my drinks ready in no time at all. 

Love this place!! Thanks so very much! Will be coming back for sure!",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,14,11,4,P4rV78_ZR4BBTEz8d-LdMQ

I yelped this place and didn't realize it was in a mall until we arrived. I don't ever think mall food is good BUT THIS PLACE WAS SOOOOO DELICIOUS!!! SO GOOD THAT WE ATE HERE BOTH DAYS WE WERE IN VEGAS. The chicken salad sandwich on croissant bread is to die for. The horrchata is good as well. Very nice and friendly people.

5836654,2014-06-10,0,bHFBYlFZfJSJ7_Irns2KZw,"Went here late afternoon and it wasn't very busy. There was a woman with a little girl who was running all over the place and a man in the corner. One customer was ahead of me and she was finishing up paying for her order when I walked in. 
When I walked up to the counter, however, there was no one there. I had to wait more than a couple of minutes before someone came out of the back. She was friendly but that's pretty much where it ended. What I wanted was not in stock so I ordered an iced mint mocha instead. After paying for my order, I stood there and watched as the girl made a sandwich for the woman who was already in there with the little girl. Then she started making another sandwich. Turned out it was for the customer who had been at the counter just before me. Meanwhile, one customer came in and stood at the counter. She got a passing ""I'll be right with you"" as the girl behind the counter got to work on my drink. As it turned out, it was made, she just had to pour things into a cup. Another customer came in, saw me standing there and saw the customer at the counter and walked out. 
In the end, I did get a drink. Not the one I ordered, it was blended and not iced, but a drink. It tasted fine. But I had been there for more than 10 minutes and by the time I got my order and the worker offered to make it again to correct it, I didn't want the person still waiting to order to have to wait any longer so I said it was fine. 
Because it was relatively empty when I walked in, I thought it would be a quick stop. I was in there much longer than planned and didn't even walk out with what I had ordered. There should have been at least one other person working and perhaps things would have been smoother. I may go back if I'm at the mall again, but I haven't fully decided yet.",BeDfEK3qeIdnmwjnGFa8xg,0,0,3,ssLg7HEcbCm2YCNKpUs29Q
