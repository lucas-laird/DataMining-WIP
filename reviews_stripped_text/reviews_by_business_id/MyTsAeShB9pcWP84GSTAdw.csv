a) greasy food
b) an option to fast food
c) high calories
d) a good hangover food

If your'e into healthy eating, then this is probably not the place for your.  The food was alright, but I felt so guilty and had to add extra time to my workout just to balance things out.  I didn't even eat a quarter of my Kimchi fried rice (it was SUPER greasy, heavy and just probably exceeded over 1000 calories).  The pork lettuce wraps were yummy, but again, that guilt feeling took over and I only had one.  

If you could careless about the caloric intake and greasy foods, this is a better option than say Jack n' the Box or Panda Express and especially Taco Bell; but in my opinion it's comparable.

Try it for yourself; I did and don't think I'll be back, but at least I tried it.

We went in kind of late so it wasn't too busy. The only negative I can even think of was that as we were leaving there was a really gross old fish smell...it was really quite nauseating. It definitely wasn't there when we arrived otherwise I can't say we would have stayed, it was that bad.

Flautas were good too, 3 very good sized pieces. They also had Mexican coke in the glass bottle which is always nice. 

3 items + the coke was only $27. Felt like it should have been more for how good it was. Definitely will return.

It's a bit out of the way for me, but I found myself in the general area today and thought it would be a perfect time to check it out. We were there at 2 pm, the restaurant was completely empty. I was not deterred based on all the great reviews their N. Decatur location had received. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful on choosing what to order. I naturally wanted to eat everything - but managed to narrow it down to the bulgogi Fusion Chimichanga. Go big, or go home. Right? It was loaded with flavor! My friend tried a trio of meats (pork, chicken, steak) with the Fusion Enchiladas. We both loved our dishes, made even better by the quad of sauces brought to the table. I found the sweet chili, and the Asian style chili sauce to be the best toppings. 

Originally I had meant to order the biggest thing, and take a good portion home for my husband to try. (He was very jealous that we had gone without him.). But, I found myself inhaling the chimichanga and ended up just taking home the butt end of it. Sorry Hubs! I look forward to coming here again soon and trying more things. I have to add that my friend is quite particular in what she does and doesn't like, and she really loved her meal.

All came with slaw. Kimchee was tasty too along with the chips, guacamole and salsa that was included. Hubby had the chimichanga which was huge!! He had to take half of it home. 
Would definitely go back. Have to try the taters, fries and won ton.  Would be interested in franchising this place for California. The website's link to franchise wasn't working. But, this place is a definite hit!",KEn9aRFnmYY2lEsUcHrPdQ,1,0,5,5fSAsBwVP-srVq-zwLt2OA

As soon as you sit down they bring over chips and salsa to your table. The salsa was tasty the only thing is I wish they would give a bigger portion of it to have sufficient for all the chips. But then again maybe that's just me I just love chips and salsa. I ended up going with the fusion tacos, I ordered one pork belly, one calamari, and one one shrimp taco to taste a little bit of everything as this was my first time here. The shrimp tacos were okay, the pork belly tacos were good I would order them again, and the calamari tacos were my favorite of all! They were so good I wished I had ordered all three of them as calamari! They also provide four different sauces for the tacos a salsa roja, a salsa verde, a Korean sauce that has sriracha in it I believe, and this sweet/spicy sauce which was my choice for my tacos. The sweetness of the sauce definitely topped off the flavors in my calamari taco. I also didn't expect the tacos to be as big as they were, it was difficult to finish the third one as they are not only big they were also stuffed quite a bit with the cole slaw and pico. I'm not a fan of corn tortillas so I substituted mine with flour tortillas. Tacos just taste better with flour tortillas in my opinion.

1375845,2014-10-16,4,MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,"A pretty decent spot overall, IMO, this spot deserves about a 3.5 stars. I liked the food here, but wasn't completely sold on it for what it's worth.

This is a much bigger spot than the original location, and it also has a bar that you can sit down and order drinks, unlike the original location. After trying the food at both locations, I can say that for a fact that the food is exactly the same.

After sitting down, the server asked us for our drinks. I have to say, the service here is pretty good, even though they could have used more than one server. Our complimentary chips and dip then came out. So, I've never been a fan of flour tortilla chips, which is what they use here. But to each his/her own. The salsa was slightly better than the guac, but both were pretty weak. The guac could have used more acid and seasoning, and I wasn't big on the tomatoes they used for their salsa.

Fusion fries/nachos - I've tried both versions. In the end, it's just OK. The fries weren't as crispy as I would have liked, they became soggy rather quickly. Besides having the bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, and kimchi as toppings, the rest itself is pretty plain.. Something that you could get at any video poker bar.

On a brighter note, I had a bite of my friends' spicy pork quesadilla and it was good, except being just a tad too sweet. The portions here are great considering the value.

For the fusion part, they take Korean ingredients and incorporate them into Mexican dishes. This is just my opinion, but I would like to see it the other way around as well. For example, they can make a carne asada/al pastor/ or carnitas fried rice or chow fun. It's just a thought. It's their business and they can run it as they deem fit. They seem pretty successful with their own formula, but I think that would be pretty cool to see, even just as a special. 

I thought the food was ok here. Some of my friends are fanatics about this place, and I wouldn't mind tagging along with them if they were in the mood. But, I can't see myself stopping in by my own accord.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,9,5,3,JsfQZytMoxk7alaLC3m-iw

I'm a little bias since I'll pretty much order the same thing whenever I do visit this place and that's the bulgogi burrito. You definitely get your money's worth for how much food they give you and if you dine in, they give you chips & salsa. 
Just a heads up, bulgogi is sweet so if you're not prepared for a ""sweeter"" burrito, try something else. They have a couple different sauces to choose from and my favorite was the KoMex sauce. Didn't really try to figure out what it was made of, but you can never go wrong with house sauce. 
The place itself isn't too busy, last time everyone ordered for pickup so had the place to myself.

It's very clean, quiet, and actually decent size, but the inside isn't that interesting. But honestly, with the food as good as it was I couldn't care less about the decor. We started with the complimentary chips and salsa- which I'm a sucker for. The salsa was yummy and the chips were made in house- I think. Next came the fried wontons. HOLYYYYY MOTHER OF PEARL! I could have eaten a couple orders of those and been good to go! The flavor was absolutely delicious. They were perfectly crisp, and the meaty inside was just so juicy and flavorful. Next came the fusion tacos which we got lettuce wrapped and wow. The meat was tender, the slaw was a great crunch and the pico was perfect. All the flavors married together for a perfect little food wedding in your mouth. Next up was the Nachos. YUM. The chips were crunchy. Meat was tender. Sauce was saucy. Cheese was melty. It was all just sooooo good. I was more than pleasantly surprised with this place. The hostess/waitress was super nice too. Honestly, if you haven't yet, do yourself a favor and give this place a try.

Don't let this Korean and Mexican fused restaurant fool you with its weird fusion of ingredients.  KoMex will make you fall in love with it and will make you put a ring on it.

We arrived about a half hour when it opened and there were people sitting at tables.  Fortunately, we were able to get a table for 6 with the quickness.  We sat down and admired the paintings on the wall:  people with the mixture of Korean and Mexican features.  Oh, it didn't stop at the paintings, it was also on the menu.  

We opened up the menu and explored it....hard.  Damn, everything sounded good.  Burritos, tacos, fries, rice platters, you name it they got it.  We decided we were going to order about 2-3 plates each because everyone on Yelp were saying this place was awesome.  

The waitress was super cool-- big smile on her face, cracked jokes with us, made fun of us, and overall, made us feel like family.  As she wrote down our orders I know she was thinking to herself ,"" Man, these guys are high.""  Haha......maybe...just kidding.  Crack is whack!  D.A.R.E.!

I ordered 2 fusion steak tacos, 1 pork belly fusion taco, a half plate of fried rice, and a half plate of fusion fries.  I'm a big boy, and I need big boy food.  Let me say this-- when I got my food, the half portions looked like full meals.  Geez....I wouldn't have been surprised if my heart gave out on me that day.  

The fusion tacos were delicious, especially the pork belly.  So fatty, greasy, flavorful, but enough about me, let's talk about the fried rice.  The fried rice was something your parents made at home.  Sike.  This fried rice was way better than what your parents made.  The rice actually didn't taste stale!  I swear, most fried rice dishes you can taste the staleness of it.  But this rice, this rice was soft and delicious.  Oh, don't let me get started on the fries.  DON'T LET ME GET STARTED.  Do I really have to say something about them?  Ok.  Fries good, communism bad.

By the way, this place gave us a free full plate of pork nachos.  I don't care if they dropped it on the floor.  Shoot, if it did fall on the floor, the floor tasted just as good as the food.

KoMex, will you marry me?  Seriously, everyone must try this place out.  Let me say this-- it's wayyyyy better than Arby's.",HGhvEDwq2f1Y38HUDZ9bnA,1,1,5,pvQxPrP7A9bobxbf_PdHrw

I'd been wanting to try this place out for a while given everything that I've read and heard about this place. Finally, they opened a location close by my hood? Game on.

So we ordered their beef, chicken, pork belly and fish fusion tacos to start.

We were served up the complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole which was decidedly meh. I forgot to take a picture of the guacamole but it was brown and relatively bland. The salsa was alright but nothing special. The chips were clearly their homestyle fried corn tortillas which were overly thick and greasy.

The fusion tacos we ordered were quite filling and the serving size is quite large. All the tacos were topped with shredded cabbage and tomatoes (FYI, I thought the tomatoes rather flavorless pale beefsteak tomatoes - not a of which I was not a fan.) There was a little too little meat per veggie ratio in the taco for my tastes.

The fish in the fish tacos had a really tough coating on it and missing a nice light sauce on top to tie everything together. I found it overall to be too dry.

The pork belly and the chicken tacos were okay - both had a hit of smokiness however they were oddly underseasoned for Korean food. I expected big flavor hits of chili paste and sesame oils... which weren't there.

The best thing we tried was the bulgogi taco which was good - it was seasoned right and had a good amount of grilled flavor to it.

Overall, given that we only really thought 1 dish was good out of 4, I think we'll pass on this place even though we were glad to finally check out what all the fuss was about (3 starred review).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,2,3,i-oH7dXn5PN7CFMcyPjdew

I'm glad to report that the food is still as yummy as found at the original KoMex.

It was a mixed experience or really one not very star any worthy dish and then one that was home run. I came for lunch. The house chips and salsa/guacamole talk about great start too any meal of the day. The salsa was really nice not too spicy but still had a nice little kick too it. The guacamole was awesome! The chips was crispy, hot, and really could tell fresh tortilla they fried off. The seasoning on the chips was spot on too. Just make sure not too overload on them. Or just cave in too the addiction that once get one need another and another...

I ordered two dishes the fusion sliders and the kim chee fried rice. The fusion slider for me not fan of at all. The bulgogi meat that was awesome had really nice flavor, moist, and could have had whole plate just the meat. I felt like  it failed especially came too the slider buns. It was little bigger then normal slider buns. I felt with every bite was eating more bread then the whole compliment of bulgogi and the topping too the hot sauce inside the slider. The bun by itself was very bland and sandwich not sandwich if your bread all out of whack too start. Where the fusion sliders not the best thing on the menu. Once I got too try the kim chee fried rice with spam and topped with fried egg. Back in my Happy place with food. The spam goes really well with the kim chee make nice balance of flavors and fried egg on anything easy sold on that idea. I love me some fried egg. 

The portion sizes are decent size as are the prices. Most of the entrees all under $10 or not many that recall that went over that amount.

Our waitress was super nice and gave us suggestions and explanations for some menu items :) 
I settled on getting the bulgogi fried rice and the pork belly musubi with fried egg (which cost extra for some reason?). My husband got the bulgogi cheese steak sandwich and my friend got the teriyaki chicken with rice.
My friend rice was so so good! The half portion is huge for being half and the bulgogi had good flavors. My husband's sandwich was the winner though. The bulgogi was marinated really well and the cheese and meat combo was fantastic. The pork belly I was alittle disappointed with. It was a bit dry and wasn't seasoned as well as the other items. Over the pork belly musubi was okay (need a sauce or something). My friend liked her chicken teriyaki as well. Overall it was a pleasant experience with good food for a good price !

Most of the reviews I have read are talking about the taste of the food is so good with a very cheap price. I guess since I did not order the taco, I've become the exception. What I had was a Bulgogi plate, which is basically half white rice with half ground beef. The portion is decent, I think I would be full if I could finish it. However, the taste of the beef is dry and salty, it might work when you put them into a taco, but not on the white rice, this is simply wrong. I wish they at least put some cooked onion to blend in a little bit of sweetness, but there was none. The full size Bulgogi plate is $9.

I hope when a restaurant put some items like Bulgogi plate on their menu, they really meant for it.",R4WS9J1lprcmeA0YIzE2dQ,0,0,2,Wi9XNeoBGGHtHdGDvdub3w

If you haven't tried KoMex yet get down to this location or the original location ASAP. I hated the long almost 1 hr waits at the other location on some days. Yes it's that good. So I'm very happy this one finally opened up. Korean Mexican fusion is an excellent combination. I ordered their Fusion Burrito, my usual order, and inhaled that sucker like I was in a pie eating contest. Why waste time eating 1 yummy thing when I could eat 2 yummy things, didn't do 2 but wanted to. The one thing that you must do is add lots and lots of their hot sauces on anything you get it's a big difference maker but in moderations. I almost ate all 4 of the containers of sauce on my own. It's very good. They should bottle them cause I might want to take some home.

Their fusion tacos, burritos, nachos, fries, etc are served with various meats like spicy pork, pork belly, chicken, and more all come with a Korean/Mexican twist. Even their cheese steak was different, using bulgogi. Check out the pictures and reviews at the original location it will pretty much tell you wassup.

I enjoyed the customer service friendly, complementary chips, salsa, guacamole, fortune cookies, and oranges to end the meal. They were still finishing up construction and decorating, fine tuning things like only cash at the time, 1 out of the 6 menu books at our table was without a menu inside, and temp banner outside but things are looking good. Seems like more space for more seats and even a bar area. I'll probably be back before the weeks over. No I will definitely be back before the weeks over.

Located in the same plaza as BabyStacks Cafe and Hikari SW Buffalo and Flamingo.

* Fusion Tostada- Bulgogi, pico de gallo, and lettuce on top a delicious crunchy rice patty. Think the bottom of your rice cooker, but tastier!
* Fusion Nachos- Get the half order and you'll still have more than enough. So much cheese! As with anything else, load up on hot sauce. It's sweet and hot!
* Bulgogi Cheesesteak- It's like a cheesesteak but with bulgogi beef. Also the cheese isn't all oozy and slimy.
* Fusion Flautas- I have to have at least one. Something crazy happens when they mix cheese and bulgogi beef. It will change you!

For starters, this location is a lot larger and more comfortable. The servers are attentive and nice. I ordered the beef enchiladas.

To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. The enchilada came out a bit cold, the Korean-style beef wasn't evenly distributed within the enchilada, and parts of the rice tasted a little dry and overlooked. It might have been the dish, or the fact that we were a large group, but I wasn't a huge fan and wouldn't eat that dish again.

As a note for large groups: I appreciated that they split the bill for our table without issue, left us with a pitcher of water, and gave us (like at the old location) delicious orange slices, with plenty extra for the whole group, to munch on afterwards.",YYh8iYLYfgRGRs7cCNJJEg,0,0,3,5G0SkNE4Uc93YbCYdIUCow

Bulgogi Tacos - The meat is very well marinated but other than that, the taco was stuffed with more veggies than meat. 

Bulgogi Chicken Tacos - This was just okay. There were pieces that were chewy and pretty sure I had a bone. 

Bulgogi Burrito - Same as the taco but filled with rice. This was huge! But nothing spectacular. The rice was mushy. 

One thing I noticed about this place was their tortillas didn't have that tortilla texture. It is more mealy. Not a fan of that.

She came back with drinks and a basket of complimentary house made chips with salsa and guac. 

I said that we were first timers so she helped us make some selections and recommended we give the fusion tacos a go, and we did. We sampled shrimp fusion tacos, fusion flautas with dak-bulgogi (chicken), stir fried kimchi, fried wontons and veggie chow fettuccine. Everything we tried was ok but I was a little disappointed with the spicy level. I was expecting HOT and I got mild at best. But it's nothing a little hot sauce won't cure. Also, I'd probably order the kimchi fried rice (Liz said it was really good) instead of the stir fry in the future.

The real testament was the Chicken Bulgogi Enchiladas ($7.50) - they were as fantastic, if not even better (!) than I've always remembered. :-) Big pieces of perfectly grilled dark meat, a ton of gooey cheese, and the mild sauce that lets me jazz it up with the 4 sauces they put on each table.

It is literally right behind my son's charter school, so you may find me here any given day after school... I used to make the 30 minute trek all the way to their Decatur location, but it was just too far to do every week, so when I heard that they have opened much closer to my home, we had to stop in of course.

On our second visit to this location, Linda was as sweet as ever, remembering my family from months ago! The new location has plenty of seating, so there is no wait for a table anymore. However, when we ate here, there were only about 2 other occupied tables but TONS of people came in and out ordering take-out like I used to. However, the people that are doing take-out are missing out on the chips, guac, and salsa as well as the orange slices and fortune cookies! 

So, this is my second time ordering the tacos as lettuce wraps and I LOVE them! I watch my carbs when I am provided with alternatives and I love that I can get all the flavors that I love in a lettuce wrap. I ordered one of each protein: beef, pork, and chicken. In the 15+ times I've ordered from KoMex, I never tried the pork. I have been missing out. The flavors from the marinade really stand out and are so great. The bugulgi is wonderful as usual with its hints of sweetness. The chicken was good, but did not have the korean flavors as much as the other 2. I'd say if you're weary of Korean flavors, start with the chicken, but please please please try the beef and pork. They are amazing and you will not be let down. Always get kimchee on them, or on the side. I have also tried the tofu taco which is yummy and they said that the tofu taco is not naturally vegan, but they're able to make it vegan, so I can bring my vegan friends here!

My husband ordered the mixed fried rice that comes with every protein including shrimp, as well as the bugulgi burrito. My kids shared what we ate as well as spam masubi. We were stuffed and even had left-overs for about $30 before tip. My favorites are: lettuce wraps/tacos, burritos, chow fettuccine with beef and kim chee fried rice with spam. Make sure to try their korean hot sauce. It is the best! I love that I could technically eat here 5 days straight, yet be eating a different culture of food every day.

The menu has three pages: a straight Mexican page, a straight Korean page, and a page of Mexican/Korean fusion items that appear to be predominantly Mexican-based with Korean sauces added. We got two items off this menu: a fusion taco and a fusion chimichanga. We also ordered the bulgogi dish off the Korean menu.

These items are not the most authentic Korean or Mexican dishes you'll have, but they're not trying to be. It's fun fusion food with portions big enough for leftovers. The vegetables in my bulgogi dish were frozen, not fresh. Chicken was pretty good in the bulgogi dish though.

Additional fantastic things about Komex:

Not only do they bring you chips and salsa but the chips are delicious AND come with a side of guacamole

They have four different hot sauces that they bring to your table and let you experiment with.

Your check comes with a fortune cookie and an adorably cut up orange as a palate cleanser

Did I mention that tacos are crazy inexpensive?!

Did I mention that lettuce-wrapped pork tacos are maybe one of the best things I've ever eaten?!!!!

2865359,2014-01-11,2,MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,"I was thrilled to learn that a Komex had opened up a bit closer to my workplace. Love their food especially the fusion beef bulgogi and pork belly tacos. The Buffalo location is bigger even if the layout is a bit odd. A bar which looks like it will never be used, takes up a large portion of the room. 
This Komex isn't as hectic as the other smaller location at lunch time. However, during my first visit here with coworkers, someone apparently placed a large takeout order which resulted in waiting for our food for nearly 45 minutes. Even made to order food shouldn't take this long. They need to have enough staff to cook these call-in orders in order to not affect restaurant service. We were patient though and their food was delicious. 

I tried them again on a Saturday at lunchtime and the food came within 15 minutes and the service and food were spot on. I had fusion tacos again and my husband tried their enchiladas with different meats. So far so good.

But during my most recent visit on a weekday and lunchtime with coworkers, all sorts of things were off. The water tasted funny and they put the skimpiest portion of pork belly meat in one of my tacos. A coworker and I both asked for kimchi on the side. Hers was a generous portion and was on a small plate, like a true kimchi side dish. Mine? Well, it looked like a few kimchi shavings in a small tin container like what people use to hold ketchup or tartar sauce. I asked our waitress what was up and she said that the kimchi orders are the same (really?) and that there are 2 different chefs that made our items. So I got the short end of the deal then? Sigh. Anyway, our waitress never offered to remedy this blatant inconsistency in the food- which I thought was bad form. Food should be consistent even in the case of two different cooks/food preparers.

So if you're going to eat at this Komex, get ready to play some food roulette.",HVa84WqQT5Klz4knWtGBqw,3,0,3,J72kswhHl2QbTfZoE0TTHg

Lynda was a pleasure to work with and made things so easy for us. We sent her a menu of what we wanted and an explanation of how we wanted the tables/chairs configured and her and the staff executed things perfectly. They did an amazing job staying on top of any additional orders we had to put in, clearing away plates, and keeping our buffet table clean and organized. 

I frequent Komex regularly and what I was most impressed by was their ability to present us with the same high quality food throughout the night since our party was so large, and they had other guests inside the restaurant that they were serving. We got a lot of bang for our buck here and I'm so glad we could share something we love about Vegas with our out-of-town guests. 

Bonus: they now have a TV inside and since the NBA playoffs were going on, guests didn't have to miss out on the games.

They essentially are a standard Roberto's style restaurant quality that also serves fried rice, noodles (chow mien, etc.) and Mexican entrees with korean style meats like bulgogi, pork belly and the sort.  They also have pork belly saimen.  

I had the kimchee fried rice with shrimp.  All the ingredients were there.   A bit spicy and there was a good amount of shirmp in it.  It was pretty good, but then again how can you mess up fried rice really.  3.5/5

Members of our table ordered the fried fish plate w/fried rice.  A bulgogi enchalada, bulgogi tacos, french fries and the spicy wings.  All of these were of bar grub quality.  Fries were light & crispy but could have used some salt.  The wings looked like buffalo style wings with a touch of Thai chili.  The bulgogi enchelada and tacos were sub par in flavor and there literally was nothing else in the tacos but thinly sliced meat.  No sauce no onions or veggies.  Nothing much stood out. 2/5 overall

The restaurant itself was lacking in ambiance.  Very cafeteria-esque.  Too bright.  Much less inspired than similar places like L&L or Aloha Kitchen for example. 2/5

2934841,2016-11-17,2,MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,"Super good. Super cheap. I'm echoing a lot of other reviews. The bulgogi fries are super tasty and super filling. I'm a big guy and my friend is a big eater and we were muscling through a half order. Three ppl would happily share a half order. 

The wings are worth splitting as well. Good flavor, the right amount of crispness without being dry. If you split those you're halfway to full. 

I typically go with a soft taco or two to round out the experience but they have a lot of other stuff besides tacos and burritos. Pork belly and fish and spicy pork are consistent favorites in the taco department and the fish plate itself is actually real good too. 

My only to tip is that they put too much cabbage and pico on their tacos. I just remove half of it before I chow down and eat the excess like a salad. Also eat the tacos as soon as they come out. The cold of the pico will cool down that meat in minutes. AND YOU DON'T WANT COLD MEAT!!!! (unless it's carpaccio)

Half order of bulgogi fries, 8 wings, two pork belly tacos (one flour, one corn), one carne asada taco (corn) for less than $22 cash* pre-tip. 

Also, I know for a fact the bulgogi bowl is good. It's like a less intimidating bibimbap. Also the pan fried fish is great, I like it with some of the fusion salsa more than the sauce it comes with.",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,3,2,5,CzJ-BuWZk-uRb02pxcOESA

So sad because I love mexican food and korean food (obv). The restaurant has so much damn potential in name alone, 'komex', but it falls flat.

Just about anything on the menu you can get at a regular Mexican restaurant. There are influences of Korean dishes here and there but nothing that really explores the potential the KoMex genre implies. It seems more like a marketing attempt (a poor one at that) at capitalizing the Korean food craze right now. I'm all up for it but give us something unique, KoMex! There's just no creativity at all.

The interior/atmosphere is a mess. Was it previously an Aloha Kitchen or a Hawaiian bar that was converted to a restaurant last minute? I don't know what I'm looking at with all the coconut leaves. Definitely not even a semi-business setting or a place for couples unless you want to look like a cheap date. At the very least it looks decent for families and friends lol

After spending 5 minutes inspecting the interior and the menu (which was probably designed on Microsoft Word), I got it. They aren't trying to be the next hot thing. You come here to eat decent mexican food, that's it. Whatever imagination you had envisioned in your mind by hearing the word KoMex you can throw it out the window.

Picking up some toys from the ""Toys for Tater Tots"" drive, I figured I should at least take a break and see what this place is all about, I mean, I'm a sucker for any place that serves burritos. 

I went with the ""Fusion Burrito"" with every intention of eating this while driving around Vegas, but when I saw the size of this bad boy I knew this was a sit down snack job. The Fusion Burrito is a monster filled with your choice of meat and Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico, cilantro, and lettuce. I went with the bulgogi spicy pork and it was delicious, the lettuce was crunchy and the meat had great flavor, but I do feel the burrito had more filler than meat. I need more meat Komex!

I should have gone with the double your meat option and I do recommend anyone to do this when getting a burrito from Komex. Was it good? Of course it just needed more meat and less rice. Plus, the house made hot sauces are the business, seriously, If I was allowed I probably would have just poured the green sauce all over my burrito. Nummy nummers!

We stayed there for more than an hour during our meal, no sign of any other human life form except for our waitress who was super friendly by the way. 

To start, we ordered 1/2 Beef Bulgogi Nachos. It was delicious. The meat was so tender and it was really flavorful. The combination of the sweet sauce blended so well with the pico and jalapenos. We ordered the Bulgogi burrito next and then three tacos with three different meat: beef bulgogi, pork and chicken. All of the meats were cooked perfectly and the flavors were spot on. The burrito was made well in my opinion. You know how when they make burritos, one side has all the beans and the other side has all the meat?

We were greeted immediately and welcomed, which I like. The staff explain the uniqueness of the food right away. I love the variety of items on the menu. Right away the fusion guacamole and the cole slaw caught my eye.
My husband really enjoyed the full bulgogi plate with chicken and pork and rice. I was very happy with three good sized chicken flautas which came with guac and cole slaw, sour cream and salad. It was enough of a meal to take half home for today ($8).

Beef was probably the best of the 3. The pork belly taco was very good. Best thing I ate. Surprisingly, the sauces were really good. I'm thinking try should bottle the sauces and sell them.

It was a bit more chunky than what I make but had super good flavor!

Onto the nachos and chimi, we were both pleasantly surprised how well the sweet garlicky beef married with the Mexican flavors of the nachos and they didn't skimp on the toppings.  I asked for hot sauce and our server brought out a caddy that had 4 different ones. By far our favorite was the chunky salsa that was spicy and sweet at the same time.

Food was as good as I remembered it to be. My friend and I started out with a half order of the bulgogi fries. I'm actually not a fan of bulgogi, but these bulgogi fries consisting of cheese, bulgogi, pico de gallo, and jalapeños were bomdiggity! Even the half portion is huge so it can definitely be split amongst multiple people. 

The pork belly taco was simply constructed yet really tasty. The pork belly was really moist and crispy and the refreshing pico de gallo and cole slaw complemented the pork belly surprisingly well. Personally, I would have thrown in some kimchi in there too. My friend recommended me to eat it right away, because the pico de gallo would cool the pork belly down which made sense. 

Their wings were the biggest surprise. I didn't expect much, but it was probably the highlight of the meal for me. Very flavorful, sweet and savory, with enough spice to make your body drop a sweat. Wings can tend to be really dry, but they were cooked to perfection. I will definitely be back for those wings!

The young lady that was serving us was pleasant and accommodating. The owner/manager lady (I think?) even heard my fork drop when she was inside the kitchen so she brought me a new one. Kudos to that!",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,6,7,5,U58gIC4r3xYpwgULW94A3g

3500207,2014-08-16,0,MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,"Who would have thought the best grilled cheese I've ever had would have come from a burrito place... and a Korean/Mexican fusion burrito place at that. 

Seriously, the grilled cheese is three dollars and is the best I've ever had. Bulgogi beef, melty cheese and sourdough. Where has this been all my life? 

Other appetizers than the grilled cheese included short ribs and some sort of fried fish, which were good but not great, but maybe had an unfair shot being put up against the grilled cheese... which i think i mentioned was pretty good.  

As far as the actual specialties... the fusion burrito is a combination of what you would find in a traditional Burrito (rice, lettuce, cheese etc), but with Bulgogi beef and kimchi (ask for it inside). Throw on on spicy fusion sauce and you've got something that makes you wonder why this ""Komex"" country doesn't actually exist, if only for the food.  

Service was good, prices reasonable. Only drawbacks are

1. The inside feels something like a mix between the DMV and a classroom
2. Chips and salsa/guac seemed like an afterthought - but hey if you are giving it to me for free I will not dock you for it.",VQHGS5qNZvuN2Y78zDA2KQ,2,2,5,mtyIz2zFPS5ohca8rRH_0A

WRONG......Nope. Not at all. 

It seems like all the flavor that makes Komex stand out was GONE here. No love man, no love. My fettucine dish was boring. There was nothing there. Barely a hint of the spices that make it taste so good. 

Maybe, just maybe it's because we ordered it to go.

After my ""Mexican Coke"" was brought to the table some complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole soon arrived. The guac was fresh and delicious! The salsa had a nice fresh flavor too. Hubby and I decided to order a few different things to try buffet style between us. 

Fried Wonton's ($1.50) - These came 5 to an order and were good! They were stuffed with green onion, ground beef & pork. The dipping sauce that came with it was sweet and yummy. 

Chicken Flauta ($2) - The flavor was very good and I can't even describe it, you will just have to try one of these tasty flautas yourself! It had some sour cream and pico de gallo on the plate as well. 

Fusion Tacos ($1.75 & $2.25 for flour tortilla) - I tried the pork and beef with one being on a corn tortilla and one on a flour tortilla. They weren't totally bad, but nothing spectacular to me. 

Beef Chow Fettuccine ($8.50) - This was the dish hubby wanted to try most. The cabbage and carrots were left out, but the portion was still hearty. The flavor of this dish was something new for me and I liked it. You can't go wrong on this dish with the price, portion and flavor.

3580713,2016-08-29,1,MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,"So I live in Orange County, where Kogi is a household name now. You know, the whole Korean-Mexican craze that took over all of LA/OC a few years back... my wife and I tried the food once and found it to be oily/greasy, salty, and just overpowering in general. It just didn't strike the right chord with us. We took a break from Korean-Mexican after making it ourselves at some point after that (and being a lot more satisfied). After perusing Yelp to satisfy/compromise between our friends' desires for tacos and my wife's cravings for Korean, we settled on KoMex, which was just around the corner from where we were staying. We phoned our orders in and picked the food up before the concert-folks headed out to see Mariah. 

Wow, was this the right decision. The food was awesome. Not overly greasy (for the bulgogi nachos and fries), well-seasoned, and just perfectly balanced. Here's the sheet of stuff we ordered, roughly:

- kimchi fried rice (beef)
- fusion tacos (bulgogi, spicy pork and pork belly)
- bulgogi bowl
- bulgogi fusion burrito
- 1/2 order bulgogi fries
- 1/2 order bulgogi nachos

So two of the people eating are Korean, and my wife grew up eating Korean food. So all were on them for feedback. I'm pretty sure it was a hit, because everything with the exception of the huge kimchi fried rice order, was gone by the end (this was shared between 6 between). Everybody loved their food, and the only reason the kimchi fried rice was left over was because everyone was so stuffed. Don't worry, a couple of us finished off the kimchi fried rice the next morning (really good stuff and they don't mess with trying to make this one fusion, which is a good call - just keep it simple). The bulgogi was probably the star of the night, as it found its way into most of our stuff :) I really liked the pork belly taco though - it's not the soft pork belly but more like the well-cooked/almost-crispy style pork belly that you'd cook up at KBBQ (samgyeupsal). Man, I should have ordered several of those instead. The bulgogi fries were great though slightly oily/soggy at the bottom and not crispy, for some reason... it didn't matter and these tasted delicious. Furthermore, these, along with the nachos were completely obliterated. 

So if you're craving something different and have heard of Korean-Mexican fusion or tried it before, I'd highly recommend this place. Pricing is reasonable and the food is really good. Oh, make sure to get the hot sauce on side :)",hYhd961l4OCNnRz-odr7GA,2,2,5,Da3NLx6qU5cnMziuYYGp-g

It is good and honest food that does not try to be what it is not.  It is not froufrou fancy.  If you come for that (as some have), then sure, you will be disappointed.  It ain't Nobu.  But it's better in some ways.  It is garden variety comfort food with an exotic twist.  The service is friendly and attentive, although a bit slow. No worries. Take time and do not rush. The atmosphere is totally disjointed and crazy. A lone and unattended (really, abandoned bar) sits off by its lonesome...making no sense whatsoever.

The food portions are huge, especially for the price. I ordered the Bulgogi Rice Bowl ($8) which has bulgogi, rice, KoMex slaw, jalapenos, kimchi, lettuce, a fried sunny side up egg, and this spicy sauce. It was filling and the amount of spice was just right. Of course there is a rack of hot sauce for the more daring diners.

This happens to me a lot... but my friends usually order something better than what I have. Apparently for a limited time only, KoMex is serving Bulgogi Tater Tots ($9) which are tater tots topped with bulgogi, pork belly, bacon, sour cream, tomatoes, green onions, cheese. Best late night meal you can possibly ask for. Anyone who loves potatoes will be floored by the Bulgogi Tater Tots, so give them a try before they're off the menu!

As a Californian, I've had my fair share of Korean-Mexican food (hello bool, Kogi, and Calbi trucks).  When I found out there was a dedicated Korean-Mexican food place on yelp in Vegas, I couldn't help but have to try it.  Dare I say, it is better than all the Korean-Mexican food trucks in LA?! 

I recommend ordering bulgogi as your meat choice in whatever you order. We ended up ordering the bulgogi quesadilla, bulgogi flautas, and the half order bulgogi fries.  All were absolutely delicious.  Their bulgogi is moist and full of flavor.  The portions were huge, better than what I expected.  For the two of us, we barely finished most of those three dishes even though we were starving. The bulgogi fries are basically a carne asada fries but WAY better since they use bulgogi and the Korean hot sauce complements it well. A half order of fries is enough for three people to share.

Although it is located away from the Strip, trust me it is worth the drive out of the glitzy area to this place.  It is located off of Buffalo and Flamingo and is inside the same plaza as BabyStacks.  There is a decent amount of sitting and prices were reasonable with most dishes being under $10.  This location closes on Mondays while the other on Decatur Blvd closes on Sundays.

Idk it just wasn't for me and while the chicken burrito was decent I don't think I would go out of my way for it.

This brings together the best of both worlds. You get the spices and the heat from the Mexican food and you get freshness and crunch from the Korean food. 

I opted for the Bulgogi rice bowl with kim chi / lettuce / jalapenos / white rice and, of course, bulgogi. The freshness of the kim chi and lettuce paired well with the heat of the jalepenos. This bowl is also huge. I came in with an appetite and I couldn't finish the whole thing. Another plus is that the service is very friendly. 

One note I found though. There was also soy sauce in the rice bowl. Soy sauce is fantastic but too much of it is miserable. Especially if there are these Mexican flavors in there as well. You should take advice from John Dies at the End and lay off the soy sauce.

4177805,2017-04-08,2,MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,"Thinking of Komex, all i have to say is, ""GET IN MY BELLLAYYY!"" Everything literally sounds good. Everything is a punch of flavors and an amazing fusion of food blending korean flavors with Mexican touches that literally pair so well together.

I am in love with nachos. And my friend loves fries. The perfect solution? Komex half fries half nachos platter. Delicious. I ended up actually loving the fries more and my friend loved the chips better. How ironic? You get to choose your meat (beef bulgogi, pork bulgogi, chicken or they have tofu and  pork belly). The beef was the best option in my opinion for the nachos and fries. It really needed a sweet and bold flavor and this hit the money mark. Do come hungry because it is so much food we couldn't even finish this dish.

We also tried the pork belly on a stick which was good (korean bulgogi flavor) but it did need something like rice to cut the fat.

The torta was also drool-drenching worthy. Love torta rolls because they just soak up all the goodies and melt in your mouth. I definitely recommend that. We also had to try the korean hot wings. Sticky icky yasss! Love the blend of sweetness and korean chilli, however I could have done with more spice, salt and some kind of vinegar to balance it. Nonetheless it was really flavorful and I wish I could have ate it all. Perfectly fried, crispy, and just so flavorful.

The pork taco ($2) was just okay to me. My only gripe is that the marinades were the same. Same for the pork belly stick and tacos. I wish there were some differences between certain meats to really balance out dishes. But I mean overall, the food is really good and truly blends foods I normally crave for into one dish. I would come back and eat it again and try other dishes like the kimchi fried rice or the flautas or burritos. 

Definitely worth it! Wonderful, attentive, and super friendly service. Ample parking and seating! Prices range from $2 (small bites) to $8 nachos or $6 tortas and the list goes on.

So I gave Komex 2 chances. The first
time I loved the nachos! My husband ESP loved it for their ""fluffy airy"" chips but the flavors were pretty delicious. The pork burrito was good but it was too spicy for this wuss. The chow fettuccine was yuck in my opinion. I like more noodles than veggies/meat and the ratio of meat and veggies was about 2:1 noodles. The noodles were all broken and I noticed in other pictures that's just the way it's made? I decided I would go back though after that...

My second visit we got the nachos again and I wanted to try the musubi and shrimp taco. Musubi was just your average musubi. The shrimp taco was soggy but that's what happens when you get it to go. Maybe if I had asked for the pico on the side it would have helped but I wasn't impressed this go around. 

I had some qualms about fusion food as other fusion places I didn't care for either. I like that it's fairly quick, but maybe I'm just too old school for the fusioness scene.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,1,0,3,l0KNs9tLfgvr0Ba6bgWZ9g

So tender and juicy with delicious spices and made with a lot of love. I tried my buddies burrito and my other friends taco and they do a great job of mixing the meat with burrito. '

If you get spicy pork I suggest getting a little lettuce with it because it is refreshing and really pairs well with all their meat.

Spicy pork and bulgogi. I have nothing else to say really, I really enjoyed it and it is perfect for a lunch break.

Chic Fil A only serves Chicken, In 'n Out, is known for it's great hamburgers, Pinks only serves hot dogs. What's my point? If you do something well, concentrate on that specialty, and do it well. 

I ordered a Chimichonga, and at the server's suggestion, with beef bulgogi. It was a generous portion, and the flavor was decent. But it lacked the flavor of the ones that I enjoyed at a pure Mexican establishment. 

My wife ordered Kimchi fried rice, the standard for any Korean eating establishment. She was not pleased. She boxed up 95% of it, and we fed it to my under employed, and financially struggling Son, who was hungry. 

Interestingly enough, my Korean wife, who really doesn't care for Mexican food, ended up eating a sizable portion of my Chimichonga, and enjoyed it more than the pure Korean food.

The service is good, and prices are very reasonable. It's just that if I want Mexican Food, I will go to a Mexican establishment, that can be considered reasonably authentic. If I want Korean food, I need only ask my wife ""what's for dinner?""",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,2,1,2,zQHWjRDHRvSGLxefTFnr3g

I can see that it can be a little off-putting to have the sweetness of some Korean dishes when you are do not usually find that in Mexican dishes. But it ended up working.

Bulgogi burrito- 3 stars. It was the size of my face, but I just think that I'm not a huge fan of the fusion Korean/Mexican food. I LOVE Mexican food, and something about the bulgogi just didn't do it for me.

Pork bulgogi tater tots- 4 stars. How the hell did that happen you ask? I love nachos, and sour cream. This was a spin off of it, hence I loved it. I really think it was the sour cream though. My friend swapped the bulgogi for pork bulgogi, which was a good choice. 

Pork belly skewers- 2 stars. I didn't like the pork belly quality or the marinade.

4548287,2017-01-13,3,MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,"Oh my goodness, I've found a new favorite place! 

Hubby was in the mood for Mexican and suggested the usual suspects. But I wanted something new and exciting! I also wanted something casual and affordable. Based on their website, this place fit the bill. And they didn't disappoint!

We visited around 6p on a Wednesday evening. There was only one other full table when we arrived and it didn't get any busier throughout our stay. 

The front of the menu listed their specials and the loaded Tots immediately caught my eye. They also do a loaded nacho/fry which comes in small or large. But that only comes with one meat. These Tots came in one size and was loaded with THREE meats - bulgogi, bacon and pork Belly! Woah!! Need I say more? It was fantastic! Hubby and I are pigs, so we definitely could've used a bigger size portion. But it ended helping us save room so we could try a few more items. 

Hubby couldn't resist some tacos, so we went with one calamari and one pork Belly. He was pretty crazy about the former. It was definitely bigger and packed full of more food than most of these Gourmet tacos that are so popular nowadays.

Next we went for the Bulgogi Tortas. They take a patty of white rice, deep fry it and cover it with meat and vegetable goodness! The outside of the rice patty was crispy, while the inside was soft and perfectly soaked up all the juices from the meat. Apparently this dish was featured on a Food Network show. And I can see why - it is unique and delicious!

We were nearing the point of being full, but everything was so good that we just had to try one more! Because I love cheese, we chose the Bulgogi Empanadas. The cheese was melted to perfect ooey Gooey-ness. And the tortilla it was wrapped it was one of the most amazing things I've ever had! It had a very light crisp on the outside and the inside was fluffy - not over-fried and dried. 

When our waitress brought the bill, she also brought a complimentary dessert of half an orange! How refreshing. 

My one and only complaint - they advertise that if you pay with cash you get 5% off. But for some reason we didn't get it....

We can't wait to go back to this place! Those oases Tots and the empanadas need to happen again. And maybe something new like the bacon fried rice?",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,10,12,5,uWz9YWajhSV3cG_Z1ZepBw

My hubs has been wanting me to try this place for the longest.  He works up North, but we live on the opposite side of town so I never agreed to going there until we were on that side of town.  Well that never came around, but here I am at their other location.  We came right when they opened and I have to say that this restaurant gets really busy.  So if you are in a rush, they even put a sign up saying that there will be a wait.  

Well I had every intention of trying one of their fusion Tacos or Burritos, but I basically had my mind set when I saw the Bulgogi plate.  I was so thankful that they brought us chips, salsa, and guacamole.  I was so hungry.  Guacamole was awesome!  On to my main dish.  

Can I tell you that I was impressed?  I would be the type to try what their best known for, but I went on a limb and just did Korean.  The bulgogi is flavored right, the fried rice is a great option to compliment your choice of protein, and if you think thats too much carbs and protein you can add on veggies which is what I did.  Oh, the hot sauce, on point!  I'm pretty sure its made there.  It has a really nice kick to it.

Chicken is tender and the flavor is average, however this is probably one of the healthier tasting item we ordered. We also tried bulgogi half fries and half nachos.

The burrito second. It was good, but the bulgogi wasn't as flavorful and wasn't nearly as saucy as I was expecting.

Their menu is just the right size; big enough you can try a few different things, although why would you do that, Bulgogi Tacos are where it's at, and ---oh, you're gluten free? Well those come in lettuce wraps. And your friend is a pescatarian? Well we can do those with shrimp? Both of those people are in your same group? No worries, is there anything else we can get for you?

The owners are amazingly kind, and I've run into them a few times without realizing. Food in the restaurant is as awesome as takeout, as long as you don't wait forever to eat your takeout. This is the sort of local gem that everyone secretly hopes gets discovered so the owners can have a million billion dollars and hopes never ever gets discovered so it never changes. 

Komex soars in the intersection of the cuisines; spice and texture. The korean slaw, crisp and salty and vinegary, playing off against the beefy spiciness of the bulgogi, and the spice of the korea-mexican red...stuff. We'll call it salsa. All in a taco shell or lettuce cup while the juice spills down your fingers...Get the fusion stuff, and step up your usual spice level, and you'll get what the ""deal"" is. 

Pros;
- Great food, people, prices, and locale.
- Easy parking.
- Open pretty darn late.
- Easy takeout.
- They really make it easy for you to give them your money. Never any complaints about splitting checks, half cash half card, debit cards.

Cons;
- Con....con...con...The chimichanga was my least favorite of the things I ate there? It got pretty soggy halfway through. But I'm pretty sure that's inherent to chimichangas.
- This is sort of my Yelp mantra, but Know What You're In For. If you order All the Wrong Things you will have a pretty ""meh"" experience.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,0,0,5,J7V6juMZOapTTdeHT8P5iA

We met up with our friends and shared a few items and got some individual tacos: 

Tacos - they now offer pork belly which was rather tasty and tender so I definitely recommend getting it on something with it. Also got daegi gogi/pork which is my other favorite taco. 

Pork Belly Fries - Lots of cheese, salsa, jalapenos and pork belly. Messy, but good and a large share- able portion.

Fusion Wings - This comes with plain fries and the wings were nicely crispy with a sticky sweet and spicy glaze. Really enjoyable as I have a little bit of a affinity for sweet and spicy wings.

Fusion Flautas - This is one of my favorite things to get. The flautas are crispy and yet fluffy fried tortilla stuffed with a good portion of meat and cheese. I enjoy the mix of guacamole with sweet Korean sauce they do. I love that there is more than enough for the flautas and extra always to dip chips in! 

Service was friendly enough. We had a second round of tacos and unfortunately it took long to get it. She did apologize and explain that a large party was before our order put in so not really their fault.

You wouldn't think to throw a big group party here, but Linda and the staff made hosting my party of 40 people a breeze. Linda made the reservation and ordering process so simple. She answered EVERY question I had and made sure I was well taken care of throughout the whole party. The staff was so helpful and the food was fresh and ready to serve when I requested. They split my appetizers of bulgogi fries into proportionate servings so that I could spread it out amongst my guests and they set up a buffet-style area to serve the main dishes. They even allowed my to drop off my cake to hang on to until serving time and provided a knife and plates for that as well. I was worried about the expenses of drinks since they only sell by the can or bottle but they provided pitchers (actually fancy serving bottles) of filtered water to offset that cost tremendously and I just ordered non-water beverages for whoever wanted it. They set up the tables in rows so my party can all sit together, and they also covered the tables with tableclothes for a more elegant appeal. I also appreciated the complimentary salsa and chips to feed my guests until everyone arrived.

I called ahead to check if there was a wait for dinner, the lady said nope c'mon down. It was our first time at this location, this one is so much bigger so lesser wait time and doesn't feel like you're sitting on top of each other like their location on Decatur. 

There was only two other couple when we got there. Our server Linda told us to pick a spot and she'll be right with us. Within minutes she came back with the complimentary chips, salsa, guac and some water. She promptly returned with our drinks and then took our orders. We decided on kimchi fried rice, Korean wings, a pork belly taco and the surprisingly good bulgogi cheesesteak with fries. It was my first time trying the cheesesteak (thanks Ghia) and I think I've found my new favorite. It's so full of flavor with the perfectly marinated bulgogi, onions, peppers and oozing cheese. Not soon after, people started coming in as dinner rush was starting. 

Even though Linda was a one woman show, she handled herself well and still gave stellar service. This will be our chosen location as it's closer to home and a better dining experience altogether.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,8,9,4,WZKzdkCgUM9PFms5emZ8fw

When we walked in we were able to pick wherever we wanted to seat and that was cool. Started looking over the menu and wasn't too sure if id like it here not. So I'll just go on to rate the food

Calamari tacos (4.5/5) kind of expecting squid with tentacles but nope just strips so probably frozen. But the flavors were so simple and tasted great.

Chimichanga with bulgogi beef (3.99/5) when I'm eating something with bulgogi I feel as if I'm exPecting the meat to totally blow my mind with bursting flavors but it wasn't as bulgogi as I expected. I'm not sure that makes sense but some of you that read this may know what I'm taking about. The Mexican part of this dish was very good and their salsas that you can put on this are all great

Pork belly musubis (5/5)- omg! This was probably my favorite thing here. it wasn't just covered with teriyaki sauce like most
places just to give the meat flavor cooked right the pork belly had the good crisp on it like bacon but I would like it a little more crisp. The coolest thing was our waitress did say I could add an egg on it and have like mini breakfast musubis so ill be back to try this for sure

Kimchi fried rice( 3/5) this dish needs some work so I don't have that much to say but the flavors need to be brought it with more vegetables that I feel were missing from a kimchi fried rice. I don't mind the soggy sometimes as long as fried rice has that little burnt taste like it was cooked on a hot wok but it wasn't there and too mushy.

Korean Chicken wings (3/5)-one of my favorite things if done right but some disappointing news for you here from me was the chicken was frozen and fried which made it hard. im very picky when it comes to chicken and yeah it didn't compare to the same wings from soyo or buldogis.

The prices and the service was good so we will definitely be back to try other things I just hope I can give my honest review first and maybe they can work on these things and ill enjoy the food more going forward.",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,2,0,3,Ul7_JTKJ8-9fmLcnIb20Ng

Overall the same yummy food. I mean seriously how they do make the perfect creation of fries each time I come. Their bulgogi fries are to die for, and like I said it's one of the best fries you can get in Vegas.

But sadly, it is not the same as the original komex. Maybe its the lack of workers? But it seemed like it took FOREVERRRR to get my food here. Along with re fills of my precious water. Maybe it's because I came in during lunch and there was only one person working. But still there were probably only three customers in total. That and the prices are totally raised up from what they were two years ago.

Still....those damn bulgogi fries hold a special place in my heart.

We got there about 4pm on a Friday night, and the place was completely empty.  
The space is very big, and open.  Its bright, and clean. 

We were greeted and given chips and salsa (and guac, but we had her take that back due to my allergy.)  The chips were great, and we were told that they make them in house.

I'd already glanced at the menu online, but they had a couple things that hadn't been listed online...like the Bulgogi Tater.  
A huge skillet filled with tater tots, bulgogi beef, smokey pork belly, bacon, sour cream, cheese, and green onions...I had to try this.   It was absolutely delicious, but I won't order it again unless I have 2-3 more people to share it with, it was enormous.  

I also went with the bulgogi beef fusion taco.  My husband had a bulgogi beef fusion, pork belly fusion and shrimp fusion taco.  The shrimp taco he had on a lettuce wrap.  (More like a lettuce cup.

I had anticipated small street tacos like I'm used to at other taco shops.  
Not these...these were much bigger than anticipated, and packed full of flavor.  
The bulgogi was sweet and tender.  The slaw was a perfect compliment.  The shrimp was PERFECTLY cooked.  

My fella also ordered the wonton soup, and this was a revelation.  Light fragrant broth.  Tender wontons.  Absolutely delicious. 

Service was friendly and quick, and the price can't be beat.

A locally owned institution, the ""Korean, Mexican, American"" concept proudly promoted on outdoor signage, it was finally on Thursday that KoMex Fusion proved interesting enough to investigate, a two o'clock in the afternoon arrival finding several menu-options unavailable even as the restaurant seemed sorely lacking for patrons.

Officially location number two, the North Decatur original spawning a sibling spot in late 2013, those entering Komex Fusion on South Buffalo are promptly greeted by a server/hostess standing at the kitchen-front podium, a sprawl of tables laid-out right and left with a bar showing sports providing alternative entertainment to the overly-loud IHeartRadio soundtrack.

Asked whether dine-in or to-go, the choice to stay followed by a gesture to sit anywhere one likes, it was with menu and water soon in hand that choices were debated, the idea of Mexican Meat-market owners spinning Asian suggesting a little from each column, though the decision was immediately nullified when the server announced they were ""all out"" of Noodles.

Essentially removing 1/8 of the menu, a suggestion that ""Fusion Fries"" could somehow replace Fettuccine a bizarre one indeed, it was instead Mexican and American that tastes trended, a three-item order tallying just over $17 after tax and tip.

Happy that single tastes of several items are available, no up-charge compared to larger plates, lunch began with a Fusion Slider featuring marinated Beef atop a soft Bun with traditional condiments and Korean Hot Sauce, the heat actually quite mild just as it was when rolled in a crispy Tortilla with a dollop of chopped Avocado.

Amused by the teensy cup of Salsa served with complimentary Chips, especially when accounting for large portions and low prices across the menu, it was next in an enormous Burrito that appetite was invested, the ""spicy Pork"" eschewed in favor of Chicken that was unfortunately a bit gristly, the addition of Mexican Rice an Grilled onions none-too-different from a ten-plus year recollection of Chipotle with added disappointment provided by the fact that the Korean Pancake dessert was ""unavailable,"" just some complimentary Orange slices to finish instead of an outsourced ""Cronut Sundae.""

**Understanding that specials sometimes sell-out, but never understanding the point of a laminated menu with unavailable options, KoMex success seems largely attributable to big portions and low prices, a one-and-done sort of place in a city with no lack of more delicious and authentic low-cost dining options.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,4,2,Bp76xr5mMDyji1gTkbfFAg

I  ordered the beef chow fettuccini the flavor was decent but way over salty in my opinion if it was so salty I would have enjoyed it more. I also didn't find the bulgogi in the fettuccini that great. 

I also ordered a beef fusion taco and a pork belly taco, again it was okay I found  the meats we're bit dry in the taco. Honestly I have made better fusion taco using Korean marinated  beef short ribs and then adding guacamole, sour cream and siracha with cucumbers.

I don't know if the husband and wife alternates, but each time it's the wife running it. 

Service is good here. This location serves beer unlike it's smaller location. The better reason to visit this location is that it's way bigger than the Decatur one. Makes it a lot more stroller and group friendly! 

Still highly recommend giving them a shot. We don't have a very large array of fusion food out here so just having komex as a sitdown option is awesome for us! And I swear their oranges at the end are always sweet!

A lot of my friends had been raving about this place I was excited to have finally gotten a chance to visit and it didn't disappoint. We went on a Saturday night about an hour before they closed and it wasn't very busy. Although, it did take a while for our order to be taken, it was okay because it gave us time to look over the menu.

1. Fusion Tostada w/ spicy pork, Korean Slaw, crispy rice ""tortilla"", and pico de gallo - the pork was tender, sweet, and spicy, the rice was simultaneously crispy and chewy in a good way. The slaw and the pico added acidity to cut through the richness of the pork and rice. Overall 4/5

2. Pork Belly Musubi - I had a problem with this. The pork was dry and had very little flavor and the sauce in it was pretty bland. Overall 2/5

3. Beef Bulgogi Cheesesteak w/fries - this was a delicious cheesesteak. The bulgogi marinade was slightly sweet, the cheese was gooey and melty and the roll it was served on was soft and warm. They didn't skimp on the meat either. The fries were basic frozen and unsalted. If you're going to get the cheesesteak I would save the extra money on the fries. Overall 4/5

4. Kimchi Fried Rice - the presentation was beautiful. There aren't many things that have a fried egg on it that don't look amazing. This was no exception. The kimchi was funky, spicy, and fermented in a very delicious savory way, the bulgogi added a sweetness to cut the funkiness of the kimchi, the egg was a perfect sunny side up. Overall 4.5/5

We ordered a lot of food and the prices were very reasonable. We ordered 5 items (I'm only reviewing 4) and everything came out around $45 before tip. 

Tip: If you're a soda drinker they serve their drinks by the can, so if you get thirsty order a water also.",ISQTwI_ri5lKHQsArnUMXQ,1,5,4,41Y-i8VXLioOwugwWZD5rQ

KoMex combines my two most favorite cusines, Mexican (actually, Tex-Mex) and Korean. Unfortunately, the food at this location missed the mark. 

I came here with my Yelp Husband (aka, +1 to everything) Justin G. on 5/17/14 for a late lunch/early dinner. We've both been to the other location, but seeing as it is nowhere near either of our homes, we settled here.

We ordered a half size order of bulgogi nachos with kimchee, I ordered beef noodles with kimchee and Justin got a bulgogi torta.

Only one person was working and there were 3 other tables with people so service was a bit chaotic and took a while. When the woman working came by to refill our waters, she said our fry nachos would be out soon. I said, ""We ordered regular nachos, not fry nachos."" She said, ""Oh, that's right. Regular nachos. I don't know why I said fry nachos."" She brought us out a plate of fry nachos. We didn't say anything because we had just had that exchange.

Don't get the fry nachos. Justin picked off all the kimchee because he said it made it too wet. I ate his kimchee instead (which is very tasty!) 

My pasta was forgettable. We were so busy talking that I don't really remember any flavors, and that was my opinion right after I noticed that I had eaten everything off of my plate. Justin said nothing of his torta but he had basically deconstructed the whole thing on his plate so, I don't take that as the best sign.

I might be back, but our last meal doesn't have me in any hurry.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,9,3,3,LuueqYQrus-6Fu6PiPCX5g

Sadly I did not find that here. The servers were friendly, and the location on Flamingo and Buffalo was easy enough to find. However, the food was lacking. 

I tried their chicken chimichanga. The only thing that seemed to make it different from a typical one was that it had a sort of shredded cabbage dressing on top. Perhaps this was the bulgoli (spelling?) that they said it would have. The shell of the chimichanga was soft which indicated it wasn't really fried and crisp like it should have been. I will say that the chicken was cooked well which is something of a positive I suppose. 

All in all, I wouldn't give this place another shot. I've had good Korean/Mexican fusion before but this is not it. Hopefully there's something else in town that can do better!",jaILM0J-InR7nIUab2ayRA,0,0,3,0Yn9OJszv-E-OCEcBAVCGA

(3 Rolled Tacos in Corn Tortillas topped with Red Sauce & Cheese) with Mexican Rice and the Fusion Nachos/ Fusion Fries combined 1/2 Nacho - 1/2 Fry COMBO $11.00 Meat, Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno & Korean Hot Sauce

You can taste the marinated bulgogi and the mix of cheese, korean hot sause, and pico de gallo. It was the perfect flavor combination. We ate the plate clean ;)

I have to give Yelp credit for always being my guiding light ;-) We literally ate here once a week for a couple of months and I eat out pretty sparingly. It felt like an addiction that only those fusion nachos can cure!  The bulgogi nachos are the star IMO. The freshly fried chips, sweet and salty bulgogi beef, fresh pico and a drizzle of spicy sauce is fusion perfection. And who would have thought mozzarella cheese over korean beef would even be appropriate? The full portion is so large I always share, throw in a coupla fish tacos and call it a meal. I really like their version of the fish taco. The shrimp is ok. We've also tried their fried rice. It is extra fragrant from the sesame oil and very welcoming at first, but after several bites and a cooler temp it the sesame smell and taste becomes overpowering. I have yet to try the kimchi fried rice but after the nachos there is just no room!  The complimentary chips and guac is a nice addition to the already affordable pricing and the fried wontons are really cheap and good as well. I think there are 5 for like $1.50!!

Their homemade salsa and sauces are really good
 The salsa verde-ish one is my favorite. Green in color almost like salsa verde but some pungeant asian notes in it as well. The sauce caddies used to be on the tables but now I notice that you have to ask for it. Even then, each jar is only a bout a quarter full. I think some people got a little too crazy and wasteful  with the sauce.  I wish they would add in a soda fountain and stop serving cans of soda.

Our group ordered bulgogi nachos, several varieties of tacos ($2 ea), pork belly and bulgogi skewers ($3 ea), a bulgogi rice bowl, and a big pineapple filled with liquor. Nachos were good, with plenty of peppers that I had to work around. 7/10

Tacos were really good, small in size but packed full of flavor. 9/10

Skewers looked great and full of meat. I didn't eat them but I would definitely order them next time because I love meat on a stick.

My friend who wasn't hungry at 3/4 of the rice bowl, so it must have been good. Served with a sunny side up egg on top for $9.

I'm in love already. Oh wait, you want to hear about food right? Okay gotchya! 

Browsing through the menu, they have all kinds of awesome options. I opted for the korean wings with seasoned French fries. The sauce on these was incredible, nothing to overbearing, but a little sweet... A little spicy... With some sesame seed. Mmmm. My mom got the bulgolgi chicken enchiladas. The marinade on these was succulent, and the rice truly ties this dish together.

5837392,2018-04-21,3,MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,"While I am a big fan of the original KoMex Fusion on Decatur, I had never dined at this newer and more commodious location before.  After stopping here for dinner on the way back to North Las Vegas from California, I am pleased to report that the inventive choices, quality, and taste of the food sampled, and the attentive service to be encountered here are just as stellar and sensational as one will find at the original Asian/Mexican fusion namesake standard bearer across town.     

The first decisions were the hardest: whether to order the full bowl and platter versions or smaller quantities.  Since I was going to enjoy two dishes, I decided to order half portions.  And am I glad I did!

My steaming Wonton Soup with the almost bottomless stone half-bowl (much larger than a cup) carried a heavy load of chicken broth along with 4 large delectable wontons stuffed with beef, pork, mushrooms, egg and onions.  (The larger version sports 8 such filled wontons, and must be boat sized.)  This came on top of the complimentary platter of homemade Tortilla Chips & housemade Salsa.  When I asked for some Guacamole, that of course also arrived without charge, and was a delicious concoction of avocado, diced tomatoes, White Onion, and cilantro seasoned with a modulated and well-controlled spicy kick.

When at length I finished my hot and very tasty soup, I was presented with a small but heaping and steaming platter of Combo Chow Fettuccine with some added Kimchi thrown in on request.  The Kimchi, too, was happily provided without charge.  Since this entree was big enough to easily satisfy two, its larger cousin must effortlessly accommodate four hungry diners.  

This main was an interesting combination of thick noodles laced with lean beef, chicken, and fairly sizable shrimp mixed with cabbage, Green Onions, multi-colored Bell Pepper, Carrots, and an Asian sauce.  A little Soy Sauce added some welcome salt, and I proceeded to dispatch this inviting and delicious melange of pasta with heavy Asian accents.  Meanwhile, across from me Diane really liked her Shrimp Quesadilla prepared with an abundance of chopped shrimp and oozing Mozzarella Cheese.  She was barely able to finish it--but she eventually did.  

After meal's end we were surprised by yet another complimentary treat: refrigerated and pre-cut fresh orange slices impaled with decorated toothpicks.  It was a refreshing end to a superior repast.

My bro got a shrimp taco, bulgogi taco, and 2 pork belly tacos.

The chips salsa and guacamole were good. 

The bulgogi was dry and it was not marinated long enough. 

The calamari taco was excellent. 

My bro gave me one of the shrimp from his taco and it was tender and good. 

The flauta was dry to me and with the bulgogi not being marinated long enough it didn't work to me and I had to add guacamole and sour cream to every bite to finish it. 

I think the crown jewel was the pork belly tacos. The pork was thick cut and had a smokey flavor to it. I mixed a couple of the salsas together and it rounded out the taco nicely.

5918531,2013-11-20,8,MyTsAeShB9pcWP84GSTAdw,"Today is a day packed with first for me.  First time trying the new Cookie Butter shaved snow at SnowFlake Shavery (get it with Oreo and Caramel Sauce).  Then after dessert dinner at the new Komex location that just opened today!  Ordered the Beef Chow Fettuccine, another first for me. And also the Daeji Bulgogi (Pork) Nacho, possible a first for me again.  Yep.  1st. First. ???. #1? Four 1sts, not very lucky for a Taiwanese person. 

I can also add not knowing about this ""grand opening"" of the new Komex second location to the list of my many first too. Making it a not lucky, but more importantly not unlucky 5 firsts kinda day. 

So I came here after getting some desserts.  One of my friends, Will, was disappointed with the pho he just had at one of the local Vietnamese restaurants.  Michael K was down for some dinner.  So I just tagged along, even though I should have stopped after taking on a Monster.  The real secret to my girlish figure (just for Tu Anh), SnowFlake meal replacement, but you have to have it plain without the condensed milk (exception for the nuts as toppings is okay).

The restaurant is huge compared to their first location, even though it has the same capacity.  The decoration is minimalistic but still Fluffy-approved, a lot of bamboo related decor. 

After looking over the menu, we decided to just ordered two full sized items.  It was a good thing too, because I didn't feel like batting cleanup or having leftover.  Simply put, you get a lot of food for what you are paying.  A definite plus for feeding a family or large group on a nominal budget.

The Chow Fettuccine with Beef was good (just $8.50 for a full order). Nice flavor, but I felt it was on the greasy side.  We still killed it like it was one of Michael K's famous Macha Cheesecake with Strawberries.

The Daeji Bulgogi (Pork) Nacho is big too.  Flavor and freshness of the ingredients are good, I just wanted more of the meat along with the salsa, cheese, etc. with my nacho.

Service was great. The waitress,in spite of having just a tenure of 3 whole days or 72 hours or less, was impressively knowledgeable about the menu and the questions the others threw her way.  Food came out fairly fast, even though some thought we would be waiting forever because of that party of 20 that was seated ahead of us.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience here, food could be better, but still a good time getting mild verbal abuse from a good friend about giving up on liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and possible 6-figure annual income leasing out my soul to Wall Street.

Even though it took over from a defunct bar, and the bar is still there, no alcohol is currently being served here.  Beer and wine liquor license is in the works, until then order a kids friendly beverage.

3.5 stars.  Can't beat the portions you get here, and a definite must for people that wants leftover so they don't have to cook for the next 1.5 days.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,14,11,4,bk7Oia4Xs4IuvTmQR1IpOA

We ordered some tacos and a large fried rice to share. Since tacos were only $1 we got two each and figured we would have plenty of rice to take home as leftovers. Boy were we right about that. Our food arrived and the rice was enormous, so were the tacos. For just $15 and change we got enough food for lunch and dinner along with drinks and chips with salsa and guacamole. 

On my previous visit, I had tried nachos and a burrito and didn't love the flavor combinations. This time I was much more impressed with the tacos and fried rice, probably because they were simpler and cleaner flavors.
