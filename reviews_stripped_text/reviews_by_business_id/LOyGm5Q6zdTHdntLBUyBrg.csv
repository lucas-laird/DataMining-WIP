Asked to order the chicken wrap, sorry all out of wraps. Okay, how about chicken sandwich? Sorry all out of that. Um, okay what do you have? Burgers, fries, nuggets.

No, that is NOT okay...! Coming here specifically for the taco salad, not having the tortilla chips is unacceptable! Are you gonna dump the chili into a salad bowl and add salsa? No, that is NOT okay.

My husband decided to get Wendy's for tonight's dinner and I told him to get me the Pecan Apple salad. Everything looked good but as I was eating my fourth bite, I felt something sandy in my mouth so I immediately spit it out to see what it was and I was in shock to see that it was a BIG chunk of pure dirt! I was so disgusted I dogged into the bottom of the salad to find another chunk! Needless to say I will NEVER return back AGAIN.

When you order something specific and you get all the way home to find out it's wrong. So it goes into the trash... 8 bucks down the drain... And you make yourself a bowl of cereal.

It was apparent upon standing in line behind two people that the cashier was new and or just a little uncomfortable working the register by herself and need much more training before being left alone. 

It took over 15 minutes to process two orders, one of which was a single senior citizen who only wanted a single with cheese and a cup of coffee.

I on the other hand ordered $35 worth of value meals, a salad and a Bacon Cheddar baked potato. The value meals were OK but they gave me the wrong type of potato and a wrong type of salad. I did check that we had the right quantity but didn't check foe the small details so part of it is my fault but not all of it.

With all those value meals one of the managers there (she was wearing a red shirt in comparison to the regular grunts) asked if I wanted a drink carrier? How the heck was she expecting one guy to carry all that food and drinks by himself? 

When my Fiancée called to complain a male answered the phone saying he was the manager. When I was there a middle aged lady in a white shirt was walking around and even came out to give the senior citizen his discount. Don't know why the phone wasn't handed to the real manager but I'm sure he is going to tell his manager one of his co workers screwed up a large order.
