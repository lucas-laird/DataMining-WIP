The chicken was dry and no flavor. We were charged an extra 50 cents for using a card which is fine, if we were told about the extra charge. We gave two stars because the man behind the register was nice otherwise we would have given one star. We will not return.",ppH1Q7tSKkrhLqNYMn3lQw,0,0,2,oNFx-ELD1lbNI2nx33WJcw
170116,2016-07-31,0,KJ6DuC0Jve9hAtzM2SGNOQ,My Husband and I usually go for their carne asada fries! Mainly when we are drunk or craving something super greasy. They are good but sometimes the fries are undercooked. The service is not the best. The location itself is a little scary there is usually a lot of bums hanging out around there and the place looks run down.. I needs a little fixer upper!,U3_-wh6FIWwgzsXBKhfLow,0,0,3,yJFflawR-PRLHSfqw0ym1g

First the dining room is dirty and about half of the few tables had food scraps on them. The cashier, while nice seemed annoyed. I wondered why at first until I saw that part of her duties were to babysit the two retards at the grill. I apologize for the use of the word retard as I'm sure it is an insult to the mentally handicapped to be compared to these two ass clowns as they threw food around. Anyway, I ordered a carnitas taco and a burrito al pastor. I took a bite into the taco and all I tasted was rancid pork fat. I moved on to the burrito against my better judgement and all I could taste was salt. As I type I can already feel the bout of dysentery approaching.",S6EUW-Cfw6lidOp77zwWxA,0,0,1,HlBJwEJjXKW-cE7vqbevgg

The breakfast burrito was all the fuel I needed for a day of packing and moving. Now that we are solid residents and I have tried other Mexican eateries in the area, I must say, the quality of the cooked meats is levels above the other guys. The carne asada burrito my husband had was made well and I was happy to see that the carnitas in mine was still recognizable as pork. I abhor meat cooked or charred to a tasteless jerky.  I also love that the condiment bar was kept well. The pickled onions are AMAZING and carrots are a necessary accompaniment.",EkF5gkKG_OZAGP0C7cYSMg,1,3,4,54FHbkTwcRoDpoo1nO7ObQ

869438,2015-07-13,0,KJ6DuC0Jve9hAtzM2SGNOQ,The cashier was very confused with our order  she was trying to tell us that the prices we were looking at on the menu were not the prices and on Yelp the prices are way lower than the prices in the actual restaurant. We came here a couple months ago and the service was way better and the cashier was not so confused. For example bean tostada is $2.50 and the french fries are $2.50. And I'm not sure why they have a B from the health department.,tV-q3aoHwTt6UgqKwDArjQ,0,0,2,bk9ANQ8LjlLKoZbtPne1Kw

Their food is always very fresh and flavorful. This is quality Mexican food that you usually have to spend a bunch of money for. The only complaint i have is a lot of the workers can not speak English very well so they will mess up the order :( the price is decent and the food is delicious! If your looking for good Mexican food but, don't want to spend a bunch of money or don't have a lot of time i highly recommend trying this place out !",SbbcXsw9OSUimS3pNM3Vvw,0,0,4,NskMPJpF8xiSapZ0ljGo7Q

1761209,2016-02-28,0,KJ6DuC0Jve9hAtzM2SGNOQ,"We visited this Viva El Taco location a few days ago and ordered (1) Carnitas Plate w/ Jamaica and (1) Burrito de Lengua w/ Horchata, Pricing for the meal was as expected very affordable. I can't complain about the Carnitas Plate it was delicious and very well seasoned with very tender and juicy meat however i have a few complaints regarding the Burrito, It had too much filler which i wasn't expecting. 

Every bite taken from this burrito felt as if i had been eating a bowl of rice, refried beans & guacamole - the meat was not noticeable and i suppose that's okay if you're some kind of unorthodox vegetarian but for me it was not right. I understand filler is often used to save money etc. but this burrito was almost completely made of rice/guac and refried beans.

Lastly their Horchata was very refreshing and tasty as for the Jamaica, We could tell right away by how watery it was that it wasn't natural and it had been taken from powder form or a bottle. There are many taco joints that still make their drinks natural from scratch or sometimes mixed with concentrates ie; Robertos, Mariana's, Taco Mexico etc.",-m5GK6m4hQiZwl8fpSJkYA,1,0,3,fUB9Oha_ybBtLDn8zXItSw

2455039,2014-06-07,0,KJ6DuC0Jve9hAtzM2SGNOQ,"I've eaten here plenty of times and always happy with the quality of the meal. My favorite are there fries with al pastor! It comes with all the fixings like nachos but instead of chips they use French fries!!! Love the salsas available too, compliments any item perfectly! 
I like to order their shrimp burrito when I want a change of taste and it is scrumptious!!! Imagine jambalaya wrapped in a tortilla and there's your shrimp burrito.

I haven't eaten here in awhile mainly because service there has been on a downward spiral, I ordered thru the drive thru and it took me roughly twenty minutes to get my food, I understand (and appreciate) thoroughly cooked food but that's a long wait for drive thru service maybe they should hire a couple more workers to speed up productivity.

I gave this place 4 stars because I truly love the food and would recommend it to anyone, just have to make sure that they aren't in a hurry for their food",F73EFNCWSArhulVogbG0Tg,0,0,4,aKqIbD8nbdAR6BgxD68Jmw
2623976,2016-06-29,0,KJ6DuC0Jve9hAtzM2SGNOQ,Forget Roberto's and Pepe's Tacos! This place has great portions at affordable prices I love it I've lived here for 2 years now and it's the only Mexican joint I go to now just an amazing and open 24 hours. Not to mention 99-cent chicken Tacos on Wednesday that are fully loaded with chicken they don't skimp that's what I find awesome they give great portion of lettuce cheese and chicken ratio I find myself not wanting to stop eating them I've been to every Mexican taco place from Southern California all the way to Northern California. And now I found the best in Vegas I recommend it to all my friends highly recommend it to you my favorite thing is carne asada fries only if the french fries are extra crispy only downside about this place the bathroom is outside but it's pretty cool I got this Crazy Little Thing by the front door so you can wash your hands and the self-serve salsa bar is always rocking just an amazing job I only gave four stars and because of the bathroom location everything else was awesome keep up the good work and Beware of the red sauce it's harder than it looks green sauce on Chicken on the chicken tacos is Perfect combo,AjC8av7ejY5qQOISG1fD6g,0,0,4,v2YdLCxxE19_wxWRhTS_Pg

The taste is authentic but the place seems to just remain content with what they have rather than try to improve on what's good.

But the place is clean, the staff is nice and helpful.  So far I've ordered their burrito and tacos.  I've been pleased with both.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,1,1,3,6xEM_LFRRJaHeTinfcdURw

I do like they have a sink with soap and paper towels to wash your hands before you eat!

I ordered a Breakfast Burrito with Ham, it wasn't to busy so the wait wasn't long at all. They have the red and green salsa with limes, radishes, carrots, and onions.

My burrito was very hot and I had to wait to eat it as to not burn a layer of skin from my mouth, as it was cooling down enough to eat I munched on some sliced radishes and they were nice and crunchy.

So now my burrito had cooled down minimally so I doused it with red salsa that was very flavorful. Plenty of ham for sure, I swear I could hear it oinking! Potatoes, Eggs, Cheese and Ham, what a combination!

I've had the restraint not to order the carne asada fries for quite a while, but they are made perfectly here.  I'm not a decadent dessert kind of guy, so things like carne asada fries are my definition of a guilty indulgence.  If you've never had it, it's basically a pile of crispy french fries covered with nacho toppings.

Not everything else on the menu is quite as good as the carne asada, but I don't think I've ever ordered anything that I disliked.",fhK-Jjx-W23JhI9_YFymzw,0,0,4,rdXaDNTFMGkBeOCzIRLdbQ

My girlfriend and I love getting the ham. It's diced chunky, and the potatoes are somewhat mashed and pretty good that way. Their salsa verde (green sauce) compliments it real well, with their red sauce pretty spicier when compared to other Mexican joints. I rate it 4 stars cuz we had went early on a Saturday with a different cook I assumed cuz it was smaller than usual -- and I decided to try the machaca (shredded beef) breakfast burrito and it was WAY too wet and dripped all over my girlfriend's seat and my pants..

This was my husbands first time trying Viva El Taco. He ordered the Al Pastor burrito and I got the Carne Asada burrito. Both were loaded with meat, guacamole and pico! Mmmmm soooo tasty! They also have a killer fish taco. My husband has been craving that burrito ever since!
