Apparently they don't allow kids in here before 4pm because of some health code?? That's a little concerning... So I guess the only time to bring my 4 year old here is later in the day when it's full of drunks and smokers?

The second time I came here I saw a couple that ordered this big shell of seafood which was the clam bake. So my bf and I ordered it since it seemed like it would be enough food to eat. Of course it was...it has clams, crab, corn, potatoes, and sausage! MmMmM just the sound of it makes my mouth water.

49489,2014-04-30,0,MqIgMLUdD53r_dmx1goYJg,"My friend and I wanted to try a new place and didn't want to travel far from flamingo and 215 area. We enlisted Yelp to help us find a place to dine at. Shucks came to mind. After reading all the reviews this seemed to be THE place the be! so we decided to give it at shot. 

When you walk in you see is the bar, we looked for a hostess but there's a sign to seat yourself. On the right hand side is the bar with some high top tables to sit at and on the left there are tables and booths restaurant style. We decided to sit at a booth with a large table because we were planning on eating a lot of food. We were greeted by the waiter and he gave us some time to look at the menu. 

There is a pretty good selection of seafood and other items such as sandwiches and pasta to choose from. My friend and I went for the seafood. We ordered 1/2 a dozen raw oysters on the shell, 1/2 lb of black mussels, 1/2 lb of manila clams, 1 lb of snow crab legs, garlic french fries, and a crab and spinach dip. seasonings for the seafood we choose lemon and garlic. 

The food didn't take too long to come out except for our garlic fries. First, came the crab and spinach dip. Consistency was different than what I'm used to. It was a little runny and had a strong sea food taste from the crab. I'm used to this dip being a little thicker and more creamy.  We had to add some hot sauce, salt and pepper to the appetizer so it wouldn't taste as bland. The chips that came with it were almost a cross between a tortilla and a pita bread. 
Next came the oysters. Those were delicious. White meat not cloudy and didn't smell fishy. Then the rest of our food arrived.

 Everything smelled so GOOD and mouth watering but when we started slurping and eating everything our noses deceived us. The food smelled so tasty and aromatic but it did not taste the same way. Weird right? I guess we are so used to eating at Hot 'n' Juicy. We finished our meal and I totally didn't even notice that our garlic fries never came out. We flagged down the waiter and asked them if they forgot it? He went to check and said the cooks forgot but it seemed like he forgot to ring it in. 

The fries came out about 5 minutes later super oily and shiny with some sort of garlic white powder on top of them. I didn't even want to eat it. I tried one and the moment I bit into it I felt like an oil bubble bursted into my mouth.

This place is nice and clean but the service was a little poor. They only had 2 table sitting in that area with 2 servers serving as well.  The price is good for what you get especially since it is seafood. 

So if you are looking for something close in the area with mediocore seafood. This will be the spot.",zm5ZxCeFYT4GD8u4v60D-Q,1,0,2,R-XYevu4YtlCQYWIFnW-pQ

85602,2011-10-05,0,MqIgMLUdD53r_dmx1goYJg,"I'll start by saying I'm not a HUGE seafood fan, but the wife is, so we went to Shuck's (conveniently located about a minute or so from our house). 

At first it looks like most of the 24 hour gaming/dining establishments in the area, but I wasn't really expected a fancy sit-down place, so I don't mark it down for appearance. 

It should also be noted that this is a Chicago Bears bar for the Sunday NFL games, so any of our Chicago implants here in Vegas might find some joy in hanging out with other Chicagoans.

I got the Chicken Club and some waffle fries which was very good and very filling and pretty cheap (about $8.95). My wife got the 2 and a half pound bucket of Snow Crab Legs which seems expensive ($32) but the meat was pletinful and very good and like I said, I don't eat too much seafood. 

They bring out all the proper equipment for breaking your legs and wet-naps for cleaning up afterward. So points there for being thorough. 

The waitress was not super attentive, and it seemed like they had just one woman working the entire restaurant and bar area. I know it was a Tuesday night, but there were a lot of people in there, you'd think they'd have a second server. 

All in all, Shuck's is who I thought they were (that's a Bears/Dennis Green reference for you football fans). 

It's a good place to go if you're looking for a better than average meal at a reasonable price (with the exception of the crab bucket). We'll go again, just probably not every night.",On07LboilFAEaDARXKOQCA,0,0,4,S_TpwdrMVm6P7kDlKkTonw

I checked Yelp for this non-descript looking place with a cute name that I'd seen whenever I'd been to the shopping sector across the street. I was surprised to see all the good reviews, so we gave it a whirl. I just had a few beers (nice selection on tap) and the fried oysters. Delicious! Even the cole slaw was great. Everything about the place was SO much better than the boring old big chain corporate places with homogeneously stodgy fare. Everything except, that is, the smoking. I recently quit smoking so can appreciate that smokers enjoy smoking indoors, but I now find it rather unpleasant and have no idea how my friends put up with my stinkiness for so long (I must be really, really cool or something). Anyhow (I think I've just digressed...sorry!), the smoking is the only drawback I've found to this place.

The Shucks management at this establishment openly calls out and accuses veteran customers as representing ""Stolen Valor"" and immediately kicks them out of the place while the veterans are enjoying their meals or beverages that they paid for.  This behavior will not be tolerated by Veterans and Military action groups in Las Vegas NV nor anywhere else around the country.  Believe me veterans actions groups are going to be outraged at this company.

I just ate my vegetables and called it a night. (They did take it off my bill though.) 

Also noticed that the last time was very smokey, while the previous visits were not bothersome at all. This probably has something to do with the ventilation system at the time.

The fried fish tacos were actually pretty large and filling, and the flavor was good being not too dry and not too fishy.

The steak salad was good except for having too much bleu cheese.  Luckily we asked for the dressing on the side or else the flavor would have been too overwhelming.  The steak was seared and cooked almost like tartare which we liked.  But the rest of the salad was unremarkable in my opinion.

The service has always been terrible. The food quality always amazing.

Dark and dingy is it a seafood place , a dive bar , late night hang out, or gaming spot.

The staff is always running around looking like it's their first day on the job. I have been seated and waited twenty minutes before acknowledged. And that was because i passed out from hunger

The waiter seemed stressed and didn't want our table or order. The manager seemed perplexed by it all and the ambiance was loud and fun. It's unfortunate that it always seemed like amateur hour because the food is so darn good

Don't think I have ever had a bad meal. The peel and eat shrimp is to die for.

Shucks quickly became a favorite after we had 2 dinners, a lunch, and several breakfasts. Joenna is our restaurant favorite server and ???our favorite bartender. (So sorry we don't know...gorgeous with long dark hair in ponytail..........worked until 3:30 or 4 pm today ( NCAA Gonzaga v S. Carolina [april 1]. 

Went to Shucks to see game and enjoy the atmosphere. So disappointing......the food and the later bar service. Food: ordered basic cheese nachos. Had to ask for guacamole and sour cream that came with them. $7.95 Nachos were soggy and stale. We just thought that was a lesson to us not to order appetizers. Later, ordered the $25.95 ""build your own order"". Being shrimp lovers, We ordered cocktail shrimp, popcorn shrimp, coconut shrimp and the peel and eat shrimp. (We had previously ordered the coconut shrimp and popcorn shrimp as entrees during another visit.)

Wow, how disappointing. 10 small popcorn shrimp supposedly equaled 1/2 pound. The cocktail shrimp were the same as the peel and eat.....mushy and miserable. We sent them back, requesting more coconut or popcorn shrimp. Frankly, I believe the cook peeled 4 of the shrimp we sent back and deep fried them...no resemblance to the first portion of coconut shrimp. Truly angered me. 

Additionally, we sat at the bar with empty glasses waiting for someone (of the 3 bar staff) to notice. We are well dressed, well behaved adults, and the bar was not very busy. 

We left. Will we go back? Can't tell you...we're home watching Oregon win, in comfort.",ThxgqrLWszMX9KNSvPNHUg,1,0,3,BKlApJPjDoqJCIgWSgyAOQ

785494,2014-03-26,1,MqIgMLUdD53r_dmx1goYJg,"i expected a lot better food considering the other reviews. I ordered the fried oysters and the fish and chips. Both were bad, bad, bad. The oysters were not pan fried, rather deep fried and cooked so hard they literally broke into pieces under the fork. The color was way too dark meaning they were overcooked. The fish was cooked so hard I needed to work the knife hard to cut it open and it split in pieces. The breading was not fluffy like one expects from a beer bar. It was a rock hard shell. I believe they just took frozen factory  made fish planks and threw them into the oil. The fish was billed as cod but it was so dry and stringy I couldn't tell what it was. True, one could say, ""what would you expect from an oyster bar in the middle of a the Las Vegas desert?""  Well. I'd expect at least to find good tarter sauce. Nope, it was like cheap mayonnaise with pickle relish thrown in. 

The mark of a good place is their pride in food and service. Insult was added to injury when I complained about the quality to my waiter, Gregory. I stated my dissatisfaction in an obtuse manner just to see what effect it would have. I told him that now I have something to write about. He said,""what?"" I said, ""how bad the food is here."" Without a comment, he turned to take my credit card to the register. I paid for the meal at full price. I was never asked any questions nor introduced to the manager.

They are great about allowing substitutions such as egg whites for eggs and cottage cheese or tomatoes instead of potatoes. They even allow my husband to have seared ahi on his Eggs Benedict instead of ham for a small extra charge.

We love the ahi wraps and fish tacos for lunch! Also, pay attention to the daily specials as you walk in the door because there are some really great deals.

We also sometimes just order a selection of appetizers and share them. They have great appetizers and we really love the calamari.

Of course, the drinks are great too! I recently discovered their Maui Mosa and I am definitely a fan.

Stopped in at this location with the GF to grab a bite.  I found it to be pretty mellow given it was a football Sunday.  Some of the propaganda on the wall indicated this is a Bears bar.  I figure since the Bears played later in the day, this place was probably rocking.

This location is clean, spacious and everyone working was friendly enough.

Looking at the menu, I was reminded of the MOTHER-SHUCKER.  It was so delicious the last time I had it.  I asked myself several times, do I go big or do I go small?  I figured I was hungry enough to give the big one a shot.

According to the Sucks menu the Mother-Shucker is described as, ""a full one-pound patty stuffed with bacon bits and american cheese. topped with lettuce,tomato, pickle planks, grilled mushrooms, melted swiss cheese, fried onion straws and our secret ""mother shucken"" sauce. served on a giant toasted bun. cooked to order.""

I was given a choice of fries, waffle fries, onion rings or garlic fries.  I picked the garlic fries.

When the meal arrived.  The burger looked outstanding.  I had ordered medium well, but it looked like it was cooked just plain old medium. I am not hating, I can do either.

So satisfying was the burger, I did not have to at all the rest of the day.  I may or may not have been on the verge of meat sweats.

The garlic fries were all garlic and a nice compliment to meal. As was the Honey Brown beer.  The beer came out super cold and remained cool as I devoured the burger.

So glad we have a 24 hour eatery just around the corner.  Don't know why we haven't become regulars.  

Little did we know that the happy hour only got better after midnight! Darn it!  So definitely ask for their midnight menu. You can order a burger and fries for under $4 and oysters are $1, as well as under $4 breakfast.

On this trip we ordered the clam strips ($5) the waffle fries ($1.95), peel and each shrimp($5) and the portions were good sized and very tasty. 

I will say the missing star is for the initial lack of service we received upon entering.  There is no signage of ""wait to be seated"" or ""seat yourself"" so we waited a bit and the bartenders just glanced at us a couple of times but still no direction. 

Our server was not the greatest but I guess its past everyone's bed time. He never offered to refill our drinks but the gentleman who took over was very pleasant so we had a great ending to our late night snack!",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,2,0,4,2QDJ088kxsmC8irbLEURFw

It's as if no one is watching employees in the restaurant section! Dinner and bar service are good. I'm specifically referring to breakfast. Trainai doesn't seem to care about her tables/patrons at all! The only time you get a smile or a thank you as when she's dropping off the check because it's close to tip time. Last time we went we could see in to the kitchen and saw that our food sat there for over five minutes before she picked it up. The restaurant was not busy. She was near the beverage station joking with other employees and texting. They have a small table at the back of the restaurant where they wrap utensils in napkins. She spent a great deal of the time we were there sitting at that table, while ignoring us for the most part. She was talking to other employees, texting and even leaning ON the napkins. Gross! At one point she coughed on them and continued as if it was nothing. So disgusting!!!!! Another time she was leaning over it while she was texting and literally had her armpits on the napkins. Gross!! If it weren't for her lack of caring about her patrons, this place would be a four star or even a five star because of the value. 

The food is good and even the prices have gone up quite a bit in the last couple years, it is still a great value!

The reason I was pissed is that during the football season I called them to see if they were showing the Chargers game.  They said yes.  So we drove there and before we parked I went in and asked them again and they said yes.  So we went in (in our Chargers shirts) and sat at the end of the sports bar next to someone else in a Chargers jersey and told the female bartender what we wanted to watch and she said no problem.  We ordered beers and after a while noticed that the Chargers game should have already started.  So we mentioned it to the bartender and she went to check and came back and told us the owner would only let her put the Bears game on (there are a milllion tv screens in there and it shouldn't have been a problem to have our little end of the bar watching the Chargers).  So by the time we fpund another sports bar we missed more than the first quarter of the game.  Seems to me I did enough checking and they should have stood by their promises.

Anyway.... we tried the place again for the food.  It was only OK.  We had calamari appitizer which was OK but I would have liked cocktail sauce instead of marinara for dipping.  Ordered the Shucks salad which had crab, a few shrimp and a decent size peice of seared tuna on it.  The tuna was only so-so but the crab and shrimp was good.  My guy had a bowl of the seafood bisque.  He asked if they had any sourdough bread to go with it and they brought him two pieces of sourdough toast like you would have with breakfast.

i'd read all of the reviews, some by people i trust implicitly, so i was willing to give it a try, at the very least.
i was pleasantly surprised as the food was delicious and the service was friendly and accommodating.
i ordered the scallop sliders which are prepared on hawaiian sweet rolls!
imho, sliders should really only ever be served on hawaiian sweet rolls.
the scallops were tender and flavorful and the wasabi sauce has a nice little punch!
crunchy waffle fries on the side were yummy as well.

shucks has quickly become my neighborhood spot.
i've since ordered several different items and i've never been disappointed.
the mahi mahi is one of my favorite items on their menu.....prepared perfectly tender and flaky, served with wild rice and cooked veggies that are still crisp.

1. overcooked fish
2. soggy cooked vegetables
you won't find either of those here.

It wasn't too smokey or smelly inside, and it was a nice quiet day. We decided on the rockafeller oysters (6 per order) and they were delicious! Though the oysters were  bit small and it seemed there was way too much spinach for the amount of oyster, it somehow worked out! Great flavor.

And then we shared the ribs and shrimp combo. The ribs were great! Cooked perfectly and the sauce was yummy, it was a bit too saucy for me, but super yummy. And since I am a low-carber, I asked to sub the fries and slaw for a side salad. (Very fresh veggies). And we chose the garlic shrimp which was also delectable.

I must say, though, the server was a bit slow. He was the only one working the night shift and I guess he was tired, but there was only us and one other table...

It was late and their doors were locked and you have to be buzzed in. I sat at the bar and waited for them to prepare 6 country fried steaks which didn't take very long. He even helped me to my car. I would order from here again if I get out early and hungry for breakfast.

The first time I came here was a little off though. We didn't get ID'd from a blond server. I would understand if we looked over 30 but I'm 21 and Chris is 24. The server with the red hair is amazing! She is great at recommending food, drinks, and just fun to talk to! I wasn't too fond of Doug at first, but he's really great to me now! 

There is smoking in this bar so don't come in here and complain about that. Most bars have smoking anyway. It's opened 24 hours too which is a huge plus being down the street! It's right across the street from Smiths on N. Durango and Elkhorn. I think it's cool that they have an ATM inside as well! 

Now for food. The bacon wrapped shrimp ($8.95) is to die for. The bacon is crispy and has this amazing smokey taste to it. The shrimp in this dish are huge as well! The Wild West burger ($10.95) is really good. Huge sized burger and extremely juicy. It comes with a side of fries! Their garlic fries are my favorite. It is extremely garlicey so just a heads up. If you don't like garlic, obviously it isn't meant for you. Their mashed potatoes are really good too but you need to add a lot of salt to it. Onion rings are the thicker cut ones (my favorite style) and it's extremely crispy. Their shrimp tacos were a little disappointing to be honest. If you're going to get tacos, get their chicken ones. Those ones were amazing! I love the fish n chips here! ($11.95) Again their portioning sizes for everything are huge. I just thought it was a little heavy on the stomach. My favorite food wise is their pasta dishes. The portions are huge! The scampi ($13.95) was amazing. It has so much flavor in it. Perfectly cooked noodles as well. The seafood fra diavolo plate (18.95) is all over the place, but in a good way. There's so much going into this dish. You get your shrimp, clams, scallops, and mussels in a huge plate. The sauce is a little spicy too, it adds such an amazing flavor. The scallops in that were my favorite! Their shrimp Alfredo (14.95) is my favorite dish here, but keep in mind that I haven't separately gotten oysters or clams yet. They actually put a good amount of shrimp in it, it's so cheesy and delicious. It's not as thick as most places make it but it's still a heavy dish. It comes with a piece of toast on it as well. Their french toast on their breakfast menu is amazing! You get that with ham, bacon, and sausage for just $5! It's well worth it and filling as well. I love their chicken fried steak and eggs. $6.95 for that. The steak is a little small but the gravy is perfectly seasoned. Honestly the prices are worth it for everything I've tried here.

All in all I love it here. The service is great no matter who it is, the food is definitely worth the prices! Has to be one of my favorite places to go.",Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,33,32,5,I1MUBA6r16Np28xnyRu1QA

Upon arriving I really had a good feeling about this place. Maybe I ordered wrong but I also had a taste of everyone's else dish and I wasn't impressed.

I ordered the Seafood pan roast. Okay, so I may be bias but I am IN LOVE with oyster bar pan roast so my exceptions were probably a little too high. But the flavors just didn't not go well. The soup had a sweet creamy taste to it that I didn't recognize. The seafood that was in it was just not up to par. Just basically lots of clams and a few fish chunks. The rice, I don't even know what kind of rice that was. It defiantly was not the typical rice I'm used to. 

My friend got the Gumbo. She never had gumbo before so she thought it was good. But the flavors just was really off. Even the waitress said she didn't really like the Gumbo. I agree with her. 

My other friend got the Philly cheesesteak and the meat came out extra dry. 

The beau got Steak and crabs. Now that was pretty good. I actually ate most of his crabs. I love crabs with extra lemon butter. That was amazing. The seasoning on the steak was different though, it had a Mexican feel to it kinda like carne asada. Wasn't bad just different. 

The drinks were ... Alright. My friend had to send her margarita back because it tasted like water. The 2nd margarita wasn't any better but she got it blended and didn't want to complain anymore. The waitress was pretty nice though very helpful.

Next, oysters Rockefeller -- a delicacy you can't get many places. Add a splash of lemon and enjoy. The shrimp cocktail contained seven huge, fresh, delectable shrimp with a very pleasant cocktail sauce. 

The Big Mothershucker (yes, you read that right) is perhaps the best burger you will ever eat. Share it unless you are insanely hungry -- it contains a full pound of hamburger plus much more. The combination of ingredients is so good!

When we arrived it was seat yourself. We sat for about 5 minutes with many servers on the floor and no one came up to us. We were next to the hostesses table so we ended up grabbing our own menus after a couple more minutes of waiting. Finally someone came up after about 10 minutes to see if we had been helped. The first person we encountered asked if the ""two"" of us wanted to order our drinks. Never once asking about a drink for our 3 year old daughter (I guess she was invisible). Next we had a different server come take our order. No personality what so ever and very unpleasant. No smile, nothing. You could tell she was not in a good mood. Other than one other time it was the only time we saw her our whole meal. When done our meal we waited for the waitress to bring our check. There was not one person on the floor at this point (no clue where they all went). Finally after waiting some more we grabbed a bus boy and asked him to find our waitress so we could get the check. ** I will say the two bus boys we encountered during our meal were very nice! Too bad they were not waiters. They could teach that waitress a lesson in having a better personality. 

My boyfriend and daughter enjoyed their food. I got steak nachos, but something about the steak tasted weird so I ended up picking it all off. At that point I wasn't about to complain and wait for a new meal. While most the food we had was good it was nothing special to make me want to come back after the service I experienced. 

Now granted I know people have bad days, but unfortunately when your tip relies on giving your guests a good experience you need to learn to put that behind you. We did leave her a small tip as she did at least take our order, but that is all the tip covered.
 ** Just to be clear, per in the response below, as I don't think it was, we did not tip our waitress poorly due to slow service (that was just part of the review). It was her poor attitude and the experience she provided us that earned her her tip. Food and and food wait times are the restaurants doing, and we understand that.

Once inside, it reads like a typical sports bar - smokey, lots of TVs, with half of the interior taken up by a dining area with some booths and low tables. The menu is EXTENSIVE. Usually not a great sign, but the food we got was acceptable. I had the Shuck's salad, which has a little piece of tuna, two shrimp, and a tiny scoop of crabmeat on a romaine salad with a vinaigrette dressing. It also came with a piece of cheesy texas toast on the salad which wasn't my thing. We also ordered the crab cakes, which in my opinion were small for the price. They tasted fine though, and the two came with a small salad of slaw in between them on the serving plate. No one got sick, extra point for that. My soda didn't ever get refilled though, so that was a minus. 

They have specials which are listed as you walk in, mostly things like X for half price on Tuesdays kind of thing. They also have rotating daily specials on a board inside the door. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I am in the area in the future and have deemed all other options less desirable, I might come back to try the crab legs since that seemed to be the most raved about menu item. Maybe I'm just not that used to eating in a bar where people are smoking and my server doesn't refill my drink, but given that, the food was just fine.",ltTLCzM4p-1cnC70SPNfSA,4,2,3,zaBfgMaW0Xg5O5-OjaBNOQ

Wife loves the Lemon Drop martini and Mandarin Orange Cosmo. I made the mistake of ordering a 'real' vodka martini only to receive a glass full of well vodka, no detectable vermouth, and two olives. Had it been a decent vodka I would likely praise it, but it wasn't so I won't. .

The two problems I have with Shucks are the uninspired dining room (just an afterthought it appears) and the smokers in the bar.  Obviously a local hangout, and most are smokers. The ventilation cannot cope with the smoke; it's not like a haze hangs in the air but you can definitely smell cigarettes while anywhere at the bar.   You can move to the dining room to escape the smokers, but the dining room is the opposite of special or cozy and lacks ambiance of any variety.",Q2q3swXJRaNhS4CGTy_kzg,4,1,3,VADmLCZ1s1Aa_DVxLYyygA

I can eat a bunch of them in one sitting. Often times, I have joked about how I should do a competitive eating contest. I think I could take the women's oyster trophy home. But that's a whole other review.

I have always called T.P. up and asked to join me for oysters. He usually says yes, so I guess that makes us ""oyster buddies."" Mind you, I usually make this decision VERY late at night (or early in the morning, depending on how you view it). I think it's cool that even though he's not as big of an oyster fan as I am, he still comes along.

The main reason for this (besides the LOVELY company, lol) is the HAPPY HOUR here. It starts late at night (I think maybe 11 or midnight, not 100% sure), but it's worth it!! All the raw oysters are $1!!! Many appetizers are between $3 and $6!! I can eat my fill of oysters, and not go broke! It's heaven for me.

The bartender who is usually working late is a pretty cool guy, and both he and the older cook in the back now remember us. One time, the cook even came out to deliver my oysters! I guess he had  to see me for himself. He was probably expecting some huge, obese chick, based on how many I always order LOL!

The customer service is atrocious. I sat for over 5 minutes at the bar and not once did the brunette bartender acknowledge me in anyway. She got a couple of drinks, went into the kitchen, and then played with her phone cord on a strip outlet by the register. Never once looked up and said she'd be right with me or anything. This reminded me that this has happened to me before there. You basically have to be a regular to get anything resembling adequate service at Schucks.

4049732,2011-02-16,1,MqIgMLUdD53r_dmx1goYJg,"It was a Sunday afternoon with hubby and the in laws. We all were super hungry and felt like seafood. After searching for seafood restaurants on Yelp, I came across Shucks Tavern & Oyster Bar. I printed out a coupon ($10 off of a bill $50 or more) and we hit the road. 

At first, we were all very skeptical and the restaurant's building wouldn't reveal anything about what was expecting us inside. Finally we got over our fears and entered the restaurant. The atmosphere was very friendly, even though a little smoky, since the bar wasn't separated from the dinning area. 

For the first hour we were the only customers in the entire restaurant, which didn't bother us at all. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. We asked him about his favorite on the menu and he suggested the Clam Bakes for $26.95, which feeds up to 2 people and includes the following: 
   
    Manila Clams (1 lb)
    Snow Crab (1 lb)
    Dungeness Crab (1/2 lb)
    Andouille Sausage
    Red Potatoes
    Corn

We ordered 2 of it and WOW, it looked and tasted amazing. The clams were very fresh and tasteful, and so were the snow crabs and the rest of the goodies in that shell looking bowl. 

As we asked for the desert menu the waiter came back after about 10 minutes with a tray of different cakes and ice cream samples. We all thought that was very cute and the effort was what counted. We decided for a piece of chocolate cake and the fried cheesecake burritos. They both were very delicious.

Suddenly I found myself with a strong craving for fried clam strips.  I used to share a basket with my mom at our favorite sea food place when I was a kid.  I had to have them again.  It had been too long.  After much searching a failed attempt at a restaurant that no longer exists, I found myself at Shucks Tavern.  

It was about 9:30 AM when I was in the area and I knew Shucks to be open 24/7.  So in I walked and was immediately handed a menu for breakafast items.  I gave the guy a funny look and asked if they were serving only breakfast or if I could order from the regular menu.  He said I could order anything and must have been confused by my request.  I mean who wouldn't be.  I'm sure most people don't tend to order fried clams at 9:30 in the morning.  But I've never been one for breakfast foods and I had a craving.  So I ordered my fried clams, a side salad with Italian dressing and an ice tea.  

What seemed like many minutes went by and were fewer than it seemed.  Soon I had my salad and a nice plate of fried clams.  They were impressive too.  Dark golden brown.  Big and meaty.  There was a large cup of cocktail sauce and a couple of lemon wedges on the side.  The salad was perfect for a side.  Mixed greens, tomato, onion.  The perfect amount of dressing.  The vinegar woke up my taste buds and got me ready for the good stuff, the clams.  And they were good.  Tender but still chewy to let me know they were the real deal.  None of this chopped formed garbage.  Perfectly fried and crispy.  The cocktail sauce was amazing.  There was enough horse radish to make me sweat.  A little extra lemon juice mixed in and it was perfect.  I ate down those crispy little bi-valves and felt this sense of euphoria wash over me.  My craving had been satisfied and I was ready to begin the rest of my day.  Everybody else can keep their Wheaties.

They have a nice bar area and then booths and tables. I usually always grab a booth because when I come here I'm so hungry I want to order a few things and it all doesn't fit comfortably on the bar. 
We have had the exact same server for over a year now and he's great. Brings us our waters and beers quickly and keep them refilled. All the staff is pretty awesome and friendly and makes sure to never forget you. 

My foodie date and I were starving so we started off with the crab and spinach dip. I personally do not like the pita chips it comes with so I had them switch it to tortilla chips instead. Always a favorite. Then we also ordered  the calamari this time. This was the first time ordering that appetizer here and I have to say that was some of the best calamari I have eaten anywhere in Vegas. It was so light and crispy that I savagely ate the entire plate by myself. If you come here definitely order that. 

Now on to the entrees! I think I have tried almost everything on their menu now but the Steak and Crab is by far my favorite. It's a flat iron steak( seasoned perfected) which is delicious and 1/2 pound of crab. The steak is always so tender you can cut it with a fork and my crab was exceptional. Huge pieces of meat that didn't even need any lemon or butter because it tasted so good on its own. They were out of my favorite sautéed summer squash side so I got broccoli instead. My date had the new Clam Bake( I think that's what it's called..?) which was amazing! It had a generous amount of clams, andouille sausage, corn, snow crab, and these deliciously seasoned potatoes. Not only did I eat all my food but I ate part of my dates as well. Haha it was just extra good. 

Even after all that food I had to have some desert. Their cheesecake and brownie is to die for but I decided on the fried cheesecake and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed! 

2 appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert and soda/beers our totally bill came to $85 which I thought was very reasonably for seafood and steak. Great place and if you are a sports fan they always have the games playing as well.",jgaEUrQtOnLwbm05zyoA0w,2,0,5,kelJqvew7rb_382MaOIfGg

Shucks is very appealing to me because its pretty close to my house, making it super convenient, AND they have a good mix of seafood as well as meat - very important factor for me because my sweetie hates seafood and I love it. Typically places that advertise seafood have either none or very few meat options. Shucks seems to have everything. Should be a match made in heaven, right? I thought so too but it did not go down that way.
Fist, they had $3 margaritas on Tuesday - yes please! Margaritas were pretty good, deliciously potent. I decided to try their crab and spinach dip appetizer and went with jambalaya as an entree. The the dip had something sprinkled on top, which I assume was crab.. there were no other signs of crab, it was basically a spinach dip. The cajun jambalaya was supposed to have cod, crawfish, and andouille sausage - it had one piece of overcooked cod, probably 3 x1 inches with tons of sausage and some crawfish. The clod looked like was a side order. I was super confused why it came in one piece on the side and why that was all the cod that was in there... The biggest problem I had with the jambalaya is that it was SUPER salty. I am a salt loving gal but this thing was all salt. I couldn't really eat it. 
My honey, however, enjoyed his wings and fries. He is a wing snob and is very particular about his wings. He only gets wings from two spots in Vegas. Well, he like the wings here! He got them medium. His french fries was delicious too, I can attest to that :)

The pancakes came out nice and fluffy but I didn't like that they only had the heinz syrup in the packets yuck. But the decor was nice and warming even though it was a Bears based theme being a packers fan that was kinda rough lol all that aside I like this little place very cozy and welcoming. Lastly I would like to say the service could use a little help I'm sure that because it was early not all the servers were there and maybe they were stretched thin but 30 min to get our card processed was just too much and it's not like the place was packed full also I would not recommend a bloody Mary here very thick and concentrated was not a highlight of the meal at all.,k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,0,0,3,uaFloBdmSzRim8mYQBBjJw

They get two stars from me because they are open and serve food 24/7. I've worked restaurants all over this country and know 24/7 is a struggle itself. I personally didn't have a good experience at all. I walked in, all be it during their ""down time"" I'm sure. I was one of 5 people in the place. Two team members eating at a corner table(everyone has to eat and I'm in no way put off by this.) The dishwasher was sitting watching tv, again breaks happen and that's not bothersome to me. My issue is that there was one lady at the bar besides myself. She had maybe a sip of beer left for the 15 min I was there(would be my last ever here if I was her). I came in to grab a bite to eat and an application since I was new to the area then. Sadly I was never even offered a drink, much less would I EVER work here now. Maybe next time the bartender that I literally stared at the whole time I was there will realize she is in the customer service industry. Randomly tapping on her register but, really texting and on her phone the whole time is very obvious and frustrating. Especially to someone in the industry. I'll have to go in when they are slammed on a Friday night and see if the staff is ready and on point for service then or if they just have a great location and are only getting business because, this is Vegas and they are one of two bars in the immediate area. Which the other bar a couple doors down always seems to be busy no matter the hour and they have great food, drinks and service. Hopefully next time I will actually get served here and can rate the food, drinks and service instead of lack there of. I think I was extremely fair not just giving 0 stars.

Only thing that's changed since my last review is the food. 

Ordered:
Mother Shucked with garlic fries
1 pound Dungeness crab

I have tried the Shuck burger and the mother shucker in the past and am quite familiar with the taste. Now, the flavor is just not the same. I've been giving them a go since I moved here in 2013, and there seems to be something different about the seasoning. 8 of 10 on the juicy rating, (well that's considering I get it medium rare). And for the Dungeness, tonight seemed a bit dry, maybe a bit over cooked. This has happened to us several times in the past 6 months. Not consistent,  so may just be different cooks. What I can say is, gotta try the garlic fries! 

Definitely love the way the crew treats their customers, and how attentive they were. But I'll give it another 6 months try before updating again, just to see if it's just me or a change in cooks that's making my tongue confused.

When I first walked in I wasn't given a greeting, I'm assuming cause they probably thought I was some middle school kid that wandered in lost. The spiderman backpack I had probably didn't help. Oh well, my problem. 

I pop a squat up at the bar, away from some obnoxious other patrons. That's right, I knew they were obnoxious the first 5 seconds I walked in. Kinda sat their awkwardly for four minutes. The other two bartenders ignored me. Thought I was waiting for mommy to finish her beer perhaps? Most likely. Could have asked though, you big jerks!

 Finally a young lady came out and greeted me with a menu, I already had my ID ready (good job following the law!) and after a few minutes I ordered a beer and the crab bucket with a mix of the two types. One, cause I don't know the difference and decided if I'm going to fuck this up, I'm going to completely 100% fuck everything up!

They brought me out all the wrecking tools used to annihilate the crab legs, and I had no idea what to do. I played creeper and watched the guy a few seats down from me work his magic and then just tried to copy him. Could have I asked the waitress? Don't boddle me with your logic!

While it was good, I must say crab is not my thing.

BTW, I asked whether they were KID FRIENDLY...they said YES!  Just not after 11pm...

One of the best places to eat late...look at these prices!

Oysters on the Half Shell ($1 ea after midnight!). These were pretty good, but even better at a cheap $1 bill each! Can't even buy em on the east coast for that cheap! 

Oysters Rockefeller ($1 ea after midnight!): Garlic, Spinach and Monterey Jack Cheese. Again, can't beat the price on these! Overall pretty good.

Peel and Eat Shrimp ($4.99 after midnight!): 1/2 lb boiled in a seasoned stock. These were served hot, and had lots of flavor and Cajun seasoning. This HAD to be way more than 1/2 lb though...there were tons of shrimp!   Tasty :D

Fish Tacos ($9.95 not sure of HH price): Grilled or Battered Cod, Roasted Red Pepper Dressing, Pico de Gallo and Seared Cabbage. Not bad! 

Waffle Fries ($2.50?). Lightly seasoned...good!  We used these as a starter until midnight hit!

The location is easy to find with plenty of parking, but I wasn't impressed with Shucks Tavern. When you walk in, it is DARK.

Mine came out as ordered but I had to ask twice for lemon. Mom's came with steak fries, which she doesn't like. She wanted regular fries. And dad's came out missing the coconut shrimp (which is part of the platter) because they were ""all out."" Long story short, something was wrong with at least one thing on each of our plates.

15 minutes later, our server arrived so we could order. Crab cake appetizer to share, lobster Po Boy for the wife, and I ordered one of their signature burgers. Garlic fries with both of the sandwiches.

15 minutes later, the appetizer arrived.
Crab cakes were mediocre, at best. The presentation was nice, the Cole slaw was decent, but the crab cakes were over cooked.

15 minutes later, our dinners arrived.
The wife liked the bread of her Po Boy, but the sandwich was missing the tomatoes that should have been on it. She also liked the garlic fries. It was a good size serving, about half her plate, with a good ratio of garlic to fries.

My burger was supposed to have their ""Shucks"" sauce, but it was so dry, I couldn't tell if it had it or not. I got about half of the fries that my wife received, but, my fries had much more garlic. When I finished eating the fries that I could, there was a three inch mound of garlic left on the plate. Simply not edible, and I like garlic!

15 minutes later, we received our bill.
Of course it was wrong, the server had added an order of oysters from the table next to us, to our bill. 5 minutes later, we were able her about the error and she said that she was going to correct it. Then, they tried to deliver the order of oysters to us. 

Laughable at best. 

This is one of those combination gaming pubs/restaurants . Not crazy smokey, but noticeable when you walk in. 

The tell tale sign was there when we walked in; there were open seats at the bar, a little after 6 on a college football Saturday night.

It didn't seem to be too busy, but it took well over an hour to get some crab cakes, a sandwich and a burger. Might have been an off night, but I'm not willing to chance it again. This place deserves zero stars.",_AVzNXzi6j_WJlH1rDwZSw,3,0,1,vnIjh48TmC83JReHLzHDZA

Since I'm allergic to shellfish, I don't really care, I came here for the company and not for the food.  For people like me, there are non-shellfish options such as fish, chicken wings, fries, burgers and alcohol!

We sat at the bar.  They have black jack/ keno machines, etc.  The bar tender was cool.

I got a Malibu Bay Breeze per Honny's recommendation as I perused through the menu. The waffle fries comes with ketchup and ranch dipping sauce...they were good.  It must have been the alcohol or I simply had a death wish because I ordered Rockefeller oysters when I didn't have Benadryl.  I remember liking them when I was little before I developed my allergies.  It seemed like a good idea at that moment until I ate 3 oysters and some of my friend's Cajun shrimps - and my arm, my face and my back started to itch and my stomach started to hurt...the only thing I was waiting on was the anaphylactic reaction.  Centennial Hills Hospital is only a few blocks away so I wasn't worried.  Good oysters though...spinach, cheese, oyster with a bit of hot sauce...mmmm...

In New England, you can get a dozen oysters for $12-13 at a very good restaurant.  Shucks' $1 oyster at midnight = $12 for a dozen from their Graveyard Menu...sounds like a good deal to me.  They're open 24/7 too and also on their Graveyard Menu: burger with fries for  $4, wings and fries for $4-8, chicken fingers and fries for $5-10, shrimps for $5 and clam strips for $4.

The deserts are also great as are the drinks. The 24 hour part is definitely a plus just in case I am craving some lobster at midnight (has happened before).

I lived in New Orleans and great Gulf oysters are available there year-round. What a disappointment at Shucks! The oysters were small and spindly and tasteless. One was so small I had trouble finding it in its half-shell.

I followed with the seafood bisque which was excellent but eat fast; it's best piping hot.

Realize that the two stars are for the quality of the oysters not the tavern. I first ordered a Heineken which was served in an ultra cold glass. It was most welcome. The bartender was very friendly and my waiter was attentive and friendly. The tavern itself was not smoky.

There are four TVs placed in such a way that only a few can see them well. There was only one broadcasting a live baseball game, the others, sports history  (I watched rerun of Super Bowl XVII, Balt (34) vs SF (31), still exciting). All-in-all, the tavern is a pleasant place (early Sunday evening) and well run. It was just the oysters that piqued me.

After going to Shucks I'm wondering whether a restaurant can advertise itself as an oyster bar year-round in a desert city. Oysters are mostly seasonal unless one lives close to the source (such as New Orleans or Houston) so we here in the middle of the desert may not be able to get quality oysters certain times of the year.

When we first walked in we werent really greeted, so we just found an open table (that wasn't covered in old dishes that hadn't been bussed yet). About 15 minutes later we had a servicer come take our drink orders. After about another 15 minutes we were able to order. My husband ordered a crab bucket, his brother a shrimp bucket, and I Ordered a shrimp poboy. We also got two appetizers the calamari and the clam strips. 
The calamari was burnt to a crisp, like crack your jaw and slice up the inside of your mouth burnt crisp. And the clam strips were more like fat little clam chunks, I've never seen them cut up that way. And they were very tough. Unlike the calamari they were at least edible, unfortunately there were only like 4 clam strips on the plate. All together the appetizers were very disappointing. 
By this time we've long been out of water. And couldn't seem to catch the attention of the 2 servers that were rushing around past our table. Finally when our food was brought to us (maybe other 15-20 minutes had passed) we asked the server who had brought the food for some refills, and tried to place an order for a drink. She kind of stared for a few seconds then repeated the drink order and said alright no problem and seemed to be off to put the drink order in and bring refills. We never saw her or our drinks the rest of the night. 
The food we ordered was ok. The portions for the shrimp and crab buckets were very small. Both meals came out in small bowls, with an empty bucket to throw the shells away in.. so I guess that's what the bucket part is about. Which is very misleading.
All in all it was not a good experience. I'm not sure if we'll be coming back here. It's a shame too because we really wanted to like it since it's so close to our house.",Su_-6JZAE-JVBQuVAABiJw,5,0,1,xAft3NTuS2eMynohhYhTtg

The food is delicious!!! Next best thing then  Actually eating off at the wharf in San Francisco. This place I would recommend any day of the week.
Looking forward to coming back soon.",kuMQR3mCAG8q-S-m6qQbYg,0,0,5,CiRu5Qj-CzEWe3RDeeK5EQ

Wish the restaurant had better separation from the bar, so you don't walk out smelling like an ashtray. Half pound of Dungeness was great, though likely not enough to get me to come back.",m1dV6mvrOHAdwaiETS7f8Q,0,0,2,avgbQOuX7ueM-SRsS5E3WQ

Place is filled with smoke.

Neither were the bears fans.",0KF_EOrWr9qjqkO8qCXmzA,1,0,1,yIUWY7wIm0GlJ7iXXaOpIA
5905652,2013-09-19,1,MqIgMLUdD53r_dmx1goYJg,"Love this place... 

Great happy hour specials and the two guys running the bar and kitchen are awesome. They never try to push you to order anything extra, they don't force you to hurry.. They are very laid back , attentive.. Never charged me for any extras or messed up our food.

You cannot beat their $1 oysters and their burger combo ( fries, cheese and mushrooms included) for under 5 bucks. 

My brother tried the seafood omelette, and was impressed with the taste and the price. 

The only thing is that they don't have the best beer specials, however that is easy to overlook with all the other great things this place has to offer.

We are going to come back every chance we get.. I'm looking forward to trying their regular menu.",tL3iZDuWKXP6wh4IOrw62w,2,1,5,naW-Mf1dqUjcqnYGKqbzDA
5940806,2008-09-12,0,MqIgMLUdD53r_dmx1goYJg,"Love this place since seafood and Las Vegas are normally hard to combine. Since I am from the NW (part of the country) and near the ocean, I thought the portions were a bit small for the prices. Creative menu and drinks, some of them I have never heard of and enjoyed tremendously. We had the clam bake for two that was just enough for one of us (we love seafood and grew up with it) and I had a pasta seafood dish. Tasty. Atmosphere was nice although the occasional drunk from across the bar made conversation a bit rough at times. Seat yourself, you choose your booths! Would go back anytime but probably when I got paid again since we left after spending $130 for two.",bEclvje-UILsOfc6Ivxxsg,1,0,4,asBTc-wD4bTfqRM-ZITk0A

We sat down in the bar area immediately. It was probably 10 minutes before we put in our drink orders and then another 10 before we got our first round and the wait times only got worse from there.
At one point there ran out of glasses.",5bI67_CVxFy8PPL7E3BLqw,1,0,2,NQSONzXucybHZSbGGlRgZQ
5973515,2012-12-06,1,MqIgMLUdD53r_dmx1goYJg,"My mother-in-law is visiting from Hong Kong and looooooves raw oysters.  When I saw that Shucks had $1 oysters on Thursdays, I knew that I had to take her here.  My husband and I had treated her to Joe's Stone Crab the weekend prior, where she devoured really expensive, albeit delicious, raw oysters.  So, obviously the $1 oysters weren't going to even compare.  

The oysters on the half shell were quite small, but perhaps I need to come on a non $1 each night, to see the true quality.  I also ordered a cup of the seafood bisque, and it was OK.  My in-laws ordered the clam chowder and they seemed to enjoy it.  By the end of lunch, the two of us ate 3 dozen raw oysters, and although they weren't the best I have ever tasted, it was nice knowing that we didn't break the bank to get our fill.  

The service is friendly, but it is a little too smoky for my asthmatic lungs. We sat in the non-smoking section, however that invisible wall does not prevent the smoke from seeping into my air space.  If I wasn't so sensitive to the cigarette smoke, I would definitely return.  It is a fun atmosphere, and a great neighborhood bar for sport lovers and seafood fans.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,0,3,r-ZHBLmgXdyXld8SClB-hQ

It's inexpensive & never have to wait to be seated like most breakfast places. The staff is super friendly. It is a bar but I come here with my family on weekend mornings, totally don't even realize I am at a bar. It's decorated in Chicago sports gear! So today, I noticed a new menu & the churro waffle is to die for. You don't even need syrup! Love it.",eZrS8SeTgX4c7ir3G1-8VQ,1,0,5,JcDJE4PreBxf53JqqtiRTA
