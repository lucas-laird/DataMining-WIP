294061,2015-09-30,0,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,"Sorry to say, the service and selection has gone down hill dramatically. Rumor has it that Haggen is giving this store up. If so, it shows. It could have been great, but it's clear they are no longer interested in serving customers or providing a decent selection. Couple that with high prices and why should I come back? I hope Von's takes this store back. They were fantastic and know how to run a grocery store.",EruLYDd5XMWX--aT2l3MTQ,1,2,1,dZenV6wFXWC903S8FIa_lw

I hated the new store the minute I stepped foot inside.  They destroyed the floral department that I loved by removing all of the beautiful floral arrangements that Vons had sold.  Nearly all of the items I went to Vons specifically for, were gone.  My family loved Vons baked brownies which have been eliminated and replaced by some nasty little round things that tasted terrible.  No more discounts and my bill was $70 more than I normally spent at Vons for the same type of products.   Btw...all of the organic meat selections were gone and the organic produce, which didn't even include organic flat leaf parsley, looked exactly like the non-organic produce  with an organic sticker on it, which raised my suspicions.  I will not be returning to this nasty store.  Will have to go to Sprouts and Smiths from now on.",YVAJ4Xddij0Y2Nl48fDdFg,5,2,1,Ha7xjYJleZO-GST-PsyrPQ
1060868,2015-08-14,0,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,"Seems more expensive than Von's.  I like the unique things, but this used to be my daily grocery store for the basics every week.",EPfOmLziMlKY3bB5PSDMTA,0,0,2,i9p9R2iFZI-hu0Ry7FFMag
1246502,2015-06-18,2,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,OUCH! Will never go back to Haggen for any of our grocery needs. I counted 20 or more higher standard posters around the store but I don't see any higher standards. More like a downgrade from VONS.  The entire meat section was brown meat with stickers that have managers special because it's ready to expire... WOW!

1559467,2015-08-14,13,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,"I've only ever watched one episode of the Walking Dead, but I imagine the whole series is basically like this store: virtually empty, save for a few dead-eyed folks (employees) walking around aimlessly, and never once greeting me, let alone asking if I need help finding anything. 

Clearly no one in charge here has ever heard of the concept of ""competitive pricing."" Everything is easily a buck more than it should be, if not double the price. If you're lucky though, you might find those bright orange ""$1 Manager Markdown!"" stickers- except they're only on the truly ridiculous items, like $8 acai juice and borderline-rotten meat.

This place wasn't exactly a hotspot of business when it was Von's, but at least the employees were reliably friendly and the pricing was on par with other places in town. Haggen has nothing going for it whatsoever. I'll take the under on this place making the 6-month mark.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,9,2,1snS6s-cVw9RpNnyIJ0few
2077449,2015-08-18,7,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,"I feel like this place changed overnight. I was out of town for a week and when I came back, Vons was gone and Haggen took it's place. I stopped in one night after work to get something to make for dinner. The store itself is gloomy and drab. It almost feels dark in there. The prices are ridiculous and not in a good way. The 2 employees that were working the cash register at 6pm on a weeknight were slow and unenthused. I will make the drive to Smith's or even Fresh and Easy just to avoid this place.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,8,5,2,JGeuWNOOVY2D4Hu5etFJxg
3030107,2015-10-23,1,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,"This market is a disaster! I used to go to this Vons every week to get ingredients here. When Haggen took over, they had different brands at expensive prices. I had to drive a few more miles to the nearest Vons to get some ingredients even though I just live around the block of this Haggen. Ever since I first went into this Haggen store, I never came back. I hope another astonishing market corporation is going to take over this space.",fTt_rcnc-nNpjWaDrbvEow,1,1,1,bfwf9QlWOWuryXuiCBkO4Q
3128517,2015-06-26,2,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,Not impressed - lots of hype but there's no way this place fits the area. More expensive and less selection than albertsons. As others have posted - they put a new coat of paint and some shiny stickers on the vons. Smiths has better bakery. Local fish? From where? Meat counter and bakery looked barren. Maybe we will get lucky and they turn this place into another glaziers soon? Might come back in a few months to see if it's still open because even the parking lot is empty.,_poXO9cSt1iqKBN7LY8XaA,7,1,2,7BChwGmivH6SusCEVxFf1g

3586923,2015-08-13,3,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,I found myself in this store because I was looking for a specific product and their website said it could be found there.  They did have it and it's .50 less than Whole Foods but that is not saying much.  Having walked around a little I think the prices are extremely high and the selection on certain items is not very good.  You will never find me pushing a cart in here for that reason.  But if money is no object this is the store for you!  I never frequented it when it was Von's so I have nothing to compare it to as far as layout.  The employees that I've encountered while browsing are friendly as are the cashiers but the store is a ghost town and every time I've been there has not been more than one cashier open but there really doesn't need to be.  I don't imagine this store will survive long.  The 3 stars are for the friendliness of the employees and for having my specialty item.,YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,6,4,3,wFAKBb2XWgjA6jyOCmyv9A

I was looking for three items and to check out the new store that used to be Vons.  What I found was a very over-priced selection of groceries.  I got one of the three items I came for.  The deli section is anemic at best.  

As I walked around, I saw 2 litre soda on sale marked down to $1.79 from $1.97.  I can go to a dollar store and get the same thing.  Why on Earth would I take such a sale?

Finally, it took more time to check out than it shoudl given the very few customers in the store and there was only one register open.

I can see the for lease sign on the building now.

Came in today to see what all the grand opening hype was about and I was extremely underwhelmed to say the least.

I went around the store twice to find Almond Breeze almond milk and no such luck. I noticed that they don't have an alternative health aisle for those people who eat gluten free and dairy free items.

I also noticed that some of their organic vegetables were moldy. Yikes! 

Some of the prices for speciality brand items like Lara bar granola cereal was way over priced and sports drinks like Zero Vitamin water was priced at $3.50 more than what you would pay for at Target.

I seriously can not recommend coming here and what makes this store even more unappealing is that the cashiers don't seem to happy about working here.",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,5,0,1,YiiIsjpL5dueKbIENDVVrA
4668037,2015-06-14,0,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,"Haggen reorganized the produce section and in my opinion it flows so much better, there seems to be a greater selection of produce now too.  Not to mention a larger organic section to choose from as well.  The spacing of aisles is much better.  

As far as selection of products, they do have a quite a bit that I'm still trying to get accustomed to.  It's too early to tell if I'm a fan of their brand's stuff or stick with my favorite product brands.  As for selection of meats and seafood, it seems about the same if not a little bit more.  

The one area that seems to be a bit bare at the time I went is the bakery section.  It's definitely a lot more roomy in that section, but seems like it could use an extra self standing self or two in the common space.  As far as selection of breads and stuff, a good amount but one thing missing was some pita bread.  The lady said they will look into it as the old Vons used to have it and it seems odd to have all these different hummus, yogurt dips, etc. with no fresh pita bread.

As far as the staff, it seems to be a lot of the same friendly Vons staff from before.  Checking out is still pretty smooth and plenty of open stands.  The staff mentioned there will be a few more upgrades in the coming months, given what I've seen so far it'll be exciting to see what else they add to bring this regional chain into town!",BoA83SDJI9HV3lJzFs8laQ,3,1,4,fBphHqjZ6eW74wxkmmhdig
4843487,2015-06-29,6,y_JUlNQB45XhhJj1jAn4ag,"My husband insisted on going opening day around 10 p.m., (they opened at 4) and there was none of the opening day fanfare you would expect. It was tough to even locate an employee. Can I be both underwhelmed and nonplussed? Yes, thanks Haggen. 

There was a lot of empty space in this store. I liked it much better when it was Von's. Food is MORE expensive than Von's and Albertson's which are outrageous! Two bags of groceries were $90.00! I protested then decided to let my deranged husband make the purchase so I could rub it in when he was starving after exceeding the grocery budget. I felt violated by the outrageous prices. I had a colonoscopy that hurt less. 

We shant darken the door in that establishment ever again. Kiss my cash goodbye suckas! I'm going back to Trader Joe's, Sprouts, and if I'm desperate for something in the wee hours, Fresh and Easy.",zwo4S612wfakZodLQ8aMIQ,9,5,1,znrVrqRtowoDvK84SRo10g

When I ventured here last week for the first time since the switch over, everywhere seemed the same as Vons, which I chalked up to the recent transition.  It seemed as they just slapped green shirts on the employees and called it good.

Not sure if the increased organic section is somehow meant to compete with Whole Foods, but it seems unlikely a place still pushing fast-food Chinese is going to lure the granola crowd across the street while the other changes are likely to send others over to Smith's or Albertsons for better prices and less hassle.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,10,2,onzUSMsRB_hD2Fxg4TdOnA

Unless I have to go there in a pinch for a pharmaceutical item, I won't be back.  Today I spent for lunch $1.59 for one baked chicken leg, $1.99 for one baked chicken breast and $3.40 for cucumber and onion salad -- seriously???

I went in and needed Crystal Geyser 1 gallon bottled water. There was only one on the shelf.
When I went to check out, I asked the cashier if they had any more....she just gave me a look did not even attempt to ask someone in the back to check and said no.
Very poor, poor customer service and I am going to tell everyone I know not to shop at Haggen.
