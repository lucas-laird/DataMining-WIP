Although their selection isn't comparable to the massive 4 Star Hotel neighbors down the block, their Chinese food is one of the best I have tasted so far in the city. If you're thinking about going to grab fast food, think again... For under $6 per person, it'll get you salads, entrees and desserts. Or, you can also just load your plate with french fries.",3xx3eCp2JGl0dslVXVBDvA,1,1,5,__oohP9L53zudqBPyD4FpA

I had heard about this one from my brother so me and my friend went in. It is a pretty nice place, considering the area. The total for the buffet is $5.76 with tax, so you can't beat that price. The food, however, was not that great. They didn't have as wide of a selection as I would have liked. The beef and broccoli was really good, as was the teriyaki chicken. And don't get me started on the Chinese donuts! Phew! The fried calamri was very chewy and tasted like it had been sitting there all day, which I'm sure it had. The white rice was not in a steamer, like it usually is at a buffet, so it wasn't as fresh tasting. They also had amazing soft serve ice cream, so that was nice. I would go here again... that is until I find a competitor that is better.",RwD3P0pkNbQRnkCUQVC7wA,0,0,3,uZqJoMhCMpvoqgC9-56GOQ
