124329,2014-01-02,0,eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg,"This week I'm going to skip covering some of the newly-opened restaurants in town to deal with another place that boldly advertises its burger as ""voted best burger in Las Vegas"" on a colorful banner right on the corner of Fremont St and Las Vegas Blvd. I'm definitely not aware of everything going on in town burger-wise, but by being the self-titled 'burger guy' for Vegas I'm fairly aware of most contests that would elect such a title. So when my coworker pointed out one day that Hennessey's had such a banner on their patio, I just had to look into this. I've had a couple folks suggest their burgers over the years, but it just hasn't been a priority with so many more popular and generally accepted places to try. But being a glutton for punishment and fulfilling my self-induced duties, I headed over to see if they could offer a contender for the best burger in town.

For those unfamiliar with the Fremont St area, Hennessey's is your typical generic 'Irish' pub with cheap drinks, cheap food, and the average sub-Strip tourist crowd. The interior is dark, dirty, smoky, and undoubtedly loud on weekends when they're packed and a band is playing. During the day you will have a mix of locals on their lunch breaks along with some tourists, during the evenings you can expect a slightly louder, less refined crowd. There is also a patio for you to dine on while you take in all the lovely sights and characters walking by. Their extensive menu features just about any type of food you can mention, and I won't even bother listing it all here.

As for their burger offerings, they do have quite a selection on their menu, and maybe even more than most dedicated burger joints in town. With 15 pre-designed burgers and even more options, this is certainly a substantial group, yet I still went with a simple favorite of mine: the mushroom burger. The bun was ok; fresh, not too dry and well-proportioned to the patty. The patty had slight char flavor, but it was super generic and overcooked with no seasoning or good beefy flavor. The mushrooms were just ok too, and didn't have much flavor. The cheese was there but I didn't taste it. This was definitely not the best in Vegas, and not even the best on Fremont Street.

The fries were oily and generic, although most of them were cooked well. While I usually eat almost all of my fries with a burger meal, these weren't quite good enough for me to do so this time. They do offer a decent deal on Tuesdays with two-for-one burgers, but I'm still not sure this is really worth it. Our two burgers came to $13.30 which I guess isn't a bad deal when there are definitely more expensive and worse burgers around the area, but I'd really like to know who exactly voted in this contest.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,0,2,AvRmpi3ABdUMG7IuIoyZ1Q

Our table was filthy.  I couldn't put my napkin down on the table because there was a layer of dirt on it.  Seriously, how hard is it to wipe down a table?  We ordered and appetizer and a couple of drinks.  Our food, Irish version of potato skins, was average but too expensive for the small portion.  Then we found one of the waitresses hairs in our drink.  When we pointed it out her response was, ""Oh seriously? Haha."" And she still charged us for the drink.

Ok so we try again this past Saturday evening at 11pm. Live band playing random music and we asked for something Irish.  Lead singer said don't let the red beard full you.  They don't know any Irish music.  WTF? People come to Irish Pubs for Irish food, drinks and music.  This isn't rocket science people.

371940,2015-05-18,0,eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg,"So I will review Hennessey's for what a chain is, but this is still well below expectations.  We were a party of 6 on a Sunday evening, place isn't very busy but service was not great.

The food was the biggest disappointment however, with what should be Irish specialties, being the worst.

I had the fish and chips, one of the more expensive dishes on the menu at $16, and when it (finally) got there, 3 really small pieces of fish with cold fries.  Hoping I was the exception, the Reuben was borderline OK, and the salmon one of us ordered was undercooked to the point of being inedible.  The French dips and the mushroom burger were better options, but the food overall was well below what should be served for the price and nobody at the table was happy.

The Black and Tan came out and it was obviously made with a light beer instead of a Harp or Bass. To their credit, we asked them to remake it and it came out better, definitely with the right combo this time.

If you want a quick drink, Hennessey's may be an option but if you're hungry, keep walking down Fremont for other options.  Disappointing start to a Sunday evening we hope will get better!",3m190IWHASheEZ-j9zOqCQ,1,0,2,DJ8XnYjvpWRPPb9bEQTgjg

We shared the fish and chips (really good and beer battered) and the Reuben (not perfect, but good corned beef).

Despite the crowd on the street, it was not really busy - which is a shame, because the places in the casinos are either much more expensive or not as good food.  It helped that our waitress was very nice and attentive.

513423,2010-12-16,0,eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg,"Conflicted on this one. Awesome bluecheese burger. Service should have been more responsive and personable. 

We ate here in November. We started out next door at Mickie Finnz where we sat for 15 minutes without being acknowledged by any of the staff. So admittedly we were miffed when we got up and went over to Hennesseys. We got a seat outside on the deck, which is a pleasant spot for a burger and beer right on revitalized Fremont East. 

Unfortunately, we sat there for another 10 minutes before anyone bothered to stop at our table. WTF ... the wait staff there repeatedly walked past our table without stopping, just like the other place! The joint was not busy and I was pissed. But eventually I was able to sip on a Guinness draft as I tried to chill my ass out. The Guinness helped for the most part, though I was not pleased with the level of service we received throughout the meal. Our waitress simply was not personable and provided only minimal service. I am confused because of all of the positive reviews posted here on the personable service. Perhaps it was a bad night for our waitress. Anyway I only tipped 10% that night. I do not remember ever tipping anyone less than 15%. 

However, the food was pretty good. My wife enjoyed the fish-n-chips, which had a decent fish to batter ratio, though we both agreed the bluecheese burger was great. Probably the best bluecheese burger I've had.

537578,2017-04-13,1,eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg,"A group of 7 of us girls came here to grab a little lunch before going going zip lining on Freemont Street. Moray of us have been in the bar and restaurant industry and fully understand how they work (just a side note). We were told to just seat ourselves and since the place was fairly empty with most patrons at the bar we sat in a little area next to the bar to fit our group. Our server came over in right away told us the specials and we ordered the champagne bucket special that came with orange and cranberry juice; the bucket came and our server begins to pour our champagne and filed every glass with o.j in them without asking. We chalked it up to it was a nice gesture but we ordered this bucket so we could control our own mixtures. Not a big deal, so we order a few apps while we all figure out what to eat for lunch. Before the apps came out we placed or lunch order, just a lot of salads and split BLT. Simple items. Right after placing our lunch order the apps came out,  every app came out cold....cold calamari is disgusting. It was fine we had lunch coming out at any moment, we waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally at the 47 minute mark we needed to start going to catch our zipline time. Our server that we have only seen very few times at this point was nowhere to be found, then we see her run across the bar into the back before approaching the table. By the time we found her we had to go, all she could say was that our food was coming, we insisted that we had to go as she stared at us with her deer in the headlights look. We asked for a manager who came over and stated the same as the server ""the food was almost done"". I explained we only only ordered 3 salads, a BLT, and soup and is been almost an hour. As a manager you never make excuses but not for this one....his attitude raised and he told us there were 12 other offers ahead of us and we needed to wait. THERE WASN'T EVEN 12 PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT!!!! He was trying to make us pay for the food we never received within our hour wait by this point.

A good deal if you have at least a couple people in your party eating a burger.  It's buy one get one free.  Their Western BBQ burger is pretty decent.  

Their beer selection is pretty limited for such a big place.  And the service is not that great, hence the reason for only 3 stars.  It always seems that we get a new waitress that doesn't know the menu, doesn't know what the specials are and takes forever to come back to our table to refill drinks and see if we need anything else.",SOv1c2ubfnsQU96BWtAnMg,5,1,3,hFsb6fOovk8heCFMSOY1Zg

Wanting to enjoy peoplewatching, we sat out on the patio. Our group, as one might guess, consisted of a boxer (me), a bee, a knight, a greek goddess, a beer frau, a Mormon missionary, Smurfette, a pirate wench, a gypsy woman, and a cowboy. Obviously.

We sat down, waiting for our server.

And waited.

And waited.

And double-checked inside, considering for Halloween it was pretty slow and the cover band wasn't that good.

And waited.

Finally coming out was our zombie waitress, who for her part was quite apologetic, saying floor plans had been changed and she had not been notified. We gave our drink orders, and BEE-lite Emily split a basket of fries with me.

And we waited.

And waited.

Then another waitress came out and tried to take our drink order. We were quizzical. If this is a Halloween prank I don't enjoy it! I put my drink order in again, but then Good Sir Hector said that we had already put in our orders and were waiting for them.

And we continued waiting.

Then my drink order came out from the pirate waitress, separate from everyone else. I settled the tab, puzzled.

Then our full drink order came out with my order repeated. I sure as hell am not going to pay for them again! Our fries were pretty blah too.

The Thai sesame ahi was pretty good, although the tuna was overcooked and the chef needs to practice his knife skills.

1529391,2013-07-31,1,eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg,"Just got back from Vegas and my experience at Hennessey's  Tavern was still on my mind.   I had eaten there 2 years ago and had a pretty decent meal so why not return right?  I also asked 4 friends who were visiting Vegas from NY to join me.  Good idea, right?  Not so much. 
 I arrived with my party of 3 and informed the wait staff  that another 4 people would be arriving shortly .  I told the ""hostess"" that I wanted to sit on the patio so I needed two tables set up with flatware to ensure that people arriving would not help themselves to our tables. They dismissively told me to just find two tables.  I waited, and waited and WAITED and no one came out to set up.  I got up again, went inside where servers were conglomerated  & happily chatting away. (There was ample staff considering that the place was nearly empty on a Monday night. )  A few minutes later, a female server with a brace on her hand put 7 sets of silverware on the table.  I asked her to bring out the menus so that we could browse them while we waited for the others to arrive.  We WAITED AND WAITED... no menus.  I asked a person in my party to go inside and ask for menus again.  My guest returned with the menus in hand and commented that the servers were just hanging out and chatting and could not understand why the menus had not been brought out.  I struggled with touching the menus  which were so sticky and dirty that I opened them by touching a teeny-tiny corner.  I immediately thought that if the menus were  this  dirty, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  Couldn't those lingering servers wipe down the menus?  I've seen it done in restaurants all the time---but clearly not in this one!  
After our party  of 4 arrived, we ordered our food and waited and waited and waited for our food to arrive. Each time we asked the server about the food, her answer was the same---It'll be right out!  .....Yeah, right.  
Here are the highlights of our 7 orders:  
Turkey burger & Fries, Bacon Burger & fries:  Fries so salty that they could not be eaten.  I tasted the fries and could not believe that this could be the work of a chef.  I dreaded the possibility that these fries had been salted by a prior customer and that they were recycled fries.  Ugh!!!   Everyone who had a burger said it was just OK, but definitely would not come back for one. 
Fish & Chips:  A little steep at $15 but it included 3 filets of cod.  Fries were not cooked well done as I explicitly requested.  I mentioned it  to  the waitress and was told that she would have new fries for me -- this promise was accompanied by a doe-eyed apology.  This french fry saga would continue throughout the evening.  
One of my guests asked for a beer before ordering dinner but she had almost finished her meal and still no beer.  Of course, the waitress apologized once again.  Apologies seemed to be the theme of the evening.  

25 minutes later my well done fries had not arrived.  When I told my server I still didn't have my fries , she seems surprised & shocked by it.--""You didn't get your fries??""   So who else, pray tell, should have known if my fries had been brought out to my table???  So then she asks me if I want the re done fries to which I answered, Yes! Yes! I want fries with my fish filets!!   I don't get it.  I ordered fish & CHIIPS. CHIPS meaning french fries. So she says ""OK, I'll be back in 5 minutes""

20 minutes later my party is ready to pay their bill and she shows up with my tab and NO FRIES.  She opted for giving us a discount on our tab rather than giving me the fries which I had been waiting all evening long.   And then, unbeknownst to me, the evening's entertainment was about to begin.  Wow,  a bonus.  Free entertainment.  
        Two drunks came flying out of the bar and land on the deck where we were seated.  Yelling, pummeling, more yelling, more pummeling.  Wait, wait, do I see my server who weighs about 80 pounds with a brace on her hand joining in on the pummeling?  How brave... how stupid!   She yelled at one of the drunks accusing him that he had thrown a drink at her.  So let me see, you over-serve drinks to your patrons  to make money and you are surprised by the results??  My guests were scrambling  to get out before the drunks included them in their MMA bout.  I for one was practically cowering in a corner like a scared rabbit.  
So, nice going Hennessey's Tavern.  You managed to screw up what started as a perfectly good evening in Vegas.  The sad part is for the owner who will probably be out of business before you know it because the totally incompetent, lackadaisical servers and a kitchen gone wrong.",ahwwAXJ_qwGmuRjTOHHMWg,4,0,1,LDinWGL6jnKwacsfJ9qmCA

First clue of how our dining experience would turn out should have been the awful service we were receiving so far. 

I ended up ordering their prime rib sliders and everyone else ordered sandwiches, wraps, and burgers.  The food arrived and my disappointment continued. 

The sliders looked as if someone angry in the kitchen was handling these smashed up buns. These were not by far a prime rib sliders but more like thinly sliced roast beef things.

After St. Patty's Day and many hours of watching college basketball, I was having trouble picking a drink that sounded good to me.  I decided Guinness was just what I needed. We walked down to the end of Fremont Street and sat down on the patio at Hennessey's.  

It was about 4:00 on a Friday afternoon.  We had a few more people joining us so we asked a server if we could move some tables together.  She said yes, walked inside and never came back.  After about 5-7 minutes of chatting, we walked to the door and asked another server if there was anyone helping the patio or if we should go to the bar.  She replied that someone would help us.  After another few minutes, we went to the bar.  Even there, the service was pretty slow. Bummer.

The patio was nice, but that had more to do with the weather than the restaurant. Jameson tasters were fun for the boy as he loves his Irish Whiskey.  Didn't get to try the food, we didn't want to wait any longer for a server or deal with the bartender.  That, and our friend dropped his new phone in the huge cup of Guinness, so we had to go back to our hotel to bust out the hair dryer.  Double Bummer.  Such potential.

This Irish-themed pub seems packed full of potential, but seems to fall short on speed and service.  My fiance and I went here this past Tuesday for their 2-4-1 Burger special after he got off work.

Good deal?  For Downtown, I guess it is - the burgers start at $10.40 but average $11.35.  Honestly, I cannot imagine paying this for EACH burger any other night.

The service was extraordinarily slow, and from talking with a friend we didn't experience something out of the norm.  I guess if you don't mind waiting for your food for half an hour or so, then this might be the place for you.

As far as the burger goes, I would honestly prefer Red Robin or even Chili's.  They are definitely not special, and not of any abnormally large size.  The side of fries that it comes with is pretty meager, and they are probably a bit tastier than the actual burger.

My pickle that came with it was sweetish.  That's just awkward.

Right at the end of the Fremont experience you'll find this Irish Pub at the corner. Our group stumbled into this place and kicked backed while watching an Irish live band. People were dancing to Irish folk music, the beer was flowing. I think my favorite is when they did covers of the devil went down to Georgia, and they covered pink Floyd, we don't need no education. It was awesome, they put their Irish Roots into the covers with fiddles and tambourines, very cool. Everyone in the pub was in good spirits. Only downfall was the drinks were a little pricey for shots and beers, compared to the specials down the strip.

I usually eat these burgers with a fork and knife.

One of my pet peeves is that they serve the burgers with potato chips instead of fries.  You need to pay extra to get fries.  I'm not a big fan of potato chips, so I usually don't touch them.  

Last time I asked about the fries and the server confirmed I would have to buy them separately.  Since no one else in my party wanted fries, I passed.  When I got my burger, there were two french fries on top.  Cute and creepy at the same time.  No one else got two token fries on their burger.

So we walked on over for some dinner. We ordered some onion rings that came with Spicy BBQ sauce.

We put in our main order and it took about 15 minutes to get our food. I asked the waitress what her favorite burger was and she said ""The Frisco burger"" and my mom ordered ""
Hennessey's famous burger"".

I ordered the bacon blue burger which was not good at all. Probably one of the worst burgers I've ever had. It was overcooked and burned even though I ordered it medium well. It had white ""sauce"" cheese with bacon in it which was quite disgusting. I ate about half of it and then felt pretty terrible afterward.

Between the street performers, people soaring across the street on wire cables, lights and weird people (i.e. people dressed as topless nuns), there was a lot to smile about.  It was great to do a lot of that smiling on the outdoor patio of Hennessey's Tavern.

The night I stopped by had a live band playing inside.  I never caught the name but they were pretty good.  They did some Pearl Jam & The Cure covers that they sounded great inside the bar.  On the outside of the bar, Hennessey's is directly across from that notorious Heart Attack Grill, where jumbo-sized guests that tip the scale at over 350 pounds eat for free.

First off... good looking girls as waitresses... Guinness came quick (but not too quick, leading me to believe that they know what they are doing) and the Black & Tan was heavy on the tan...  Good start.

My steak looked delicious and like it came out of a photo shoot.  Kyle's C-B&C looked equally cool.  So far this is a solid 4 star joint.  I ordered my steak medium-rare because the only gravy I like on my mashed potatoes is the blood from my steak.  Obviously, there are better places for steak (this is Vegas for crissakes), but steak is on the menu so I'm going to hold them accountable for knowing how to cook one.  

As I mentioned, the steak looked beautiful, and I cut into it and I got a good amount of juice action, but it tasted like it was over cooked... I kept thinking to myself... Their grill must be like on something as hot as the surface of the sun and incinerated the grill marks into this chunk of meat.  I continue to eat it and it tastes well done but looks medium rare...  then towards the end of the steak, when you have cut enough off and it is now taller that it is wide (it was a nice thick steak) and if falls over... I spotted it.  Bottom side was blacker than Wesley Snipes.  

To quote Randal from Clerks: 
""I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am..."" 
""You're cunning attempt to trick me""

It was a good steak, but someone set fire to one side of it and it wasn't even busy in the restaurant... no excuse... Kyle totally dug the corned beef, but then again he isn't on Yelp.

Despite my steak complaints I actually would go back to this place because everything else was solid, but I would ask for a bloody ass steak and then check the plate side before eating it... Maybe they do the whol hot ass skillet thing and that was the cause...

Finally, I had an opportunity to make use of it since we had the parents with us (darn those must spend $50 ones!).  We were doing a late lunch downtown after our visit to the Mob Museum and so we wandered in to the World's Largest Pint Glass in the afternoon.  The place was completely dead.  I'm pretty sure we were the only ones in there with exception of the bartenders and waitress.  SCARY!

We picked out a giant booth and started checking out the menus.  Our waitress came over right away to get our drink order and answer questions.  Once the drinks were in hand, we ordered our lunch.  Dad got fish and chips and mom got a club sandwich.  The husband, as usual, got buffalo chicken wings and I ordered the mushroom swiss burger.  The food came out quickly and everything was tasting great.  The only exception was that my mom said the club sandwich was boring.  I loved my burger and that it came with house made kettle chips.  Much better than french fries!  Yea!  

Our server was very attentive and kept our drinks refilled.  Even my dad, who is very picky about service was really happy with the waitress.  He even complimented her personally.

The ambiance was Irish pub, kind of dark and Irish music playing.  It was okay.

Overall the food was good, prices were okay, and service was good.  The diet coke was weird tasting.  It was a decent place to eat and I would eat there again, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there or recommend it.

WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS?
Tough one.  
~It's kind of dark and old in there, so updates, of course.
~Elevate the food to the prices or maybe bring the prices down just a bit.
~Overall ambiance just wasn't there.  The Irish music was okay, but since nothing was really going on, it was a little weird.  Maybe it would be different at night?

I expressed my desire for the free burger.  One would expect they would at least go ahead and make that second burger once you let them know you are interested.  Better yet they should offer and make it since it is advertised openly.  When my food came out I thought okay maybe they are making it and will bring it out when I'm done.  I really want to go ahead and give it to one of the less fortunate out here.

After tearing it up all afternoon at the Great Vegas Beer Festival I needed something to soak up all the IPA in my belly.

My friends recommendation to come to Hennessy's Tavern and now I am glad we stopped.

The service was quick and attentive by our server who we had rush right to ordering beverage and food at the same time because we came hungry and did not require the other formalities of a traditional dining experience.  

We were simple and order cheese burgers and fries which came out really quickly. What made this a five star burger was that it was cooked to perfection Medium and was so flavorful and juicy.  This honestly was one of the best burgers I have had in Vegas.  Everything from the meat to the bun and veggies was delicious and that was not the booze talking.  Both my friend and I concurred that this was a really good burger.  The fires were not outstanding but were a decent thick cut fry. Another thing about this was experience was that the prices were not ridiculous. Many times on the strip you expect to pay 15+ for a decent patty, here they were like $11 which was fair. 

The bus person was really attentive during our service and continued to make the rounds to clear what he could from the tables very kindly and efficiently.

 Obviously management don't teach their employees the drink menu, or anything about taking care of customers for that matter.
We ordered waters as well and those never came. We had to ask again. All the while, all of the waitresses and staff were goofing off and dancing over by the bar. Not serving their customers. (The Only time she was attentive was when she was leaving for the night, and wanted to let us know, and asked if we wanted to cash out now)
We ordered the Irish Nachos, and French Onion soup appetizers.
TOTALLY GROSS!! The cheese on the French Onion soup wasn't even broiled or melted on top. It was as if they threw it on after the fact.
The Irish potato nachos were so soggy and greasy. They were practically raw, and so disgusting!

My wife ordered one of their ""special"" Valentines day drinks, the ""Love on the rocks"" (Cherry coolaid or cherry 7-Up with vodka).  It arrived in a cracked glass with a chip out of the rim.  I spotted the crack in the glass from 20 feet away.  How do you miss this, Ms. waitress?  FAIL..  I sent it back.

My drink was an Irish whiskey on the rocks.  The one lonely ice cube they put in the drink cost me an extra buck and a half.  The ice in my glass of water on the table was free.  Go figure.  FAIL again. Guess what, Hennessey's--you are now officially on a roll!
The three of us ordered burgers--2 medium rare and one medium.  Meduim means juicy & a hint of pink in the center and med. rare means a band of pink in the center.  All arrived seared black on both sides and brown and completely dry straight thru.  I toyed with the idea of sending all back,  but the wife never sends stuff back unless it is inedible, so we chowed down.  Wife thought the better of her decision a bit later and left half of her burger uneaten on the plate.  FAIL again.
The final item for review is the french fries.  They arrived hot and I looked forward to chowing down.  The first bite revealed they were undercooked and mushy. (all 3 orders)  You were all over the place this day, Mr. cook.
Overall, this was one of the hardest restaurant fails I have experienced and earns a rare one star from me.

Myself and my foodie +1 date were running kinda late for EDC this past weekend and saw that this place was the closest nearby our hotel. Boy, did we sure make quite the great choice coming here!

Let me first say that due to the fact that my phone was near death in battery life, I was not able to take any pics of the eats we had to enjoy. I will just describe the experience instead! Inside it is very roomy with plenty of ample seating, as well as outdoor patio seating. This place does have live bands coming to play. Sweet! They do have a fully stocked open bar as well as some of the most courteous staff! Our waitress was very prompt in making sure our needs were fulfilled. I think her name was Shannon or Sharon. Either way, she was very professional and sweet!

For the eats, I ordered their Irish nachos, which came with a scoop of sour cream, which added to the already awesome taste. My foodie date had their amazing spinach and artichoke dip. Whoa. Some of the best we have ever had! For drinks, she had the lemonade with vodka. I had to opt for their iced tea(I was the DD that night!) The food came out rather quickly, which we was able to enjoy nicely.

As I stated before, there are such a variety of places to eat on Fremont Street in Las Vegas. This is one place that I highly recommend.

The staff here is friendly, the drinks are good, and the menu is simple but of all the places to eat in Downtown Fremont, i find these burgers stand out more than the rest in the area.

[Special shout out to Flippin Good Burgers - you're neck and neck in my book with these guys!]

The restaurant is indoors and outdoors, so whether you want to stay or eat out on the lanai and watch the people and street entertainment - it's great to have those options.

The Blue Cheese Burger is a favorite of mine - I love the gooey-ness of the cheese!

The slider sampler is great as well and the Hawaiian burger is another delicious option!

Now, there are a few different choice of French Fries to choose from also! My favorite is the garlic parmesan fries - be forewarned though, it's really really garlicky!

I would recommend breath mints after! lol

Also, please know it's 2 for one burgers every Tuesday! Bring your friends or family and enjoy this burger special!

i don't have a review for any of the other menu items....it's about that Burger life....

3255631,2015-02-15,0,eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg,"HUGE disappointment! 

We are locals. My brother-in-law and his wife came into town for Valentine's weekend and we decided we'd spend Friday evening checking out the Mob Museum and then walk over to Fremont and find a place to eat. 

My husband and I love Irish pubs and had never tried Hennessy's and everyone agreed it sounded like the perfect place to check out. We were SO wrong.  Anyone who thinks this is a good representative of Irish pubs has never been to a good Irish pub. 

I was excited to get an Irish coffee. I make them at home on occasion and I'm not to shabby at it. But getting one at a restaurant is usually better. I rarely drink when out and about because I have a metabolic condition that makes me very sensitive to alcohol. But I decided I was treating myself. What the waitress brought me was....coffee. It was plain coffee. There was zero alcohol and a tiny almost invisible layer of cream on top. There should have been an ounce of Irish whiskey in the coffee and if there had been, I'd have felt it...or ya know, tasted it. Nothing.

Believe it or not, one of the best Irish pubs we've ever been to was in Japan. Their Irish coffee was amazing! They served it with a thick layer of cream that was actually stamped with a clover. I don't know what the heck Hennessey's thinks they're serving but it isn't an Irish coffee. 

So--we ordered some appetizers and those were all decent. My entree, however....wtf?   So, I ordered the California Citrus Salad. It is described as spinach & romaine tossed with feta, artichoke hearts, cucumber, olive, tomatoes, red onions avocado & a citrus vinaigrette. I splurged and asked to have the salmon added. 

My salad arrives and I'm completely crushed. There is no spinach, no tomatoes, not red onions, two small avocado slices, one artichoke and one small feta crumble. I'm not kidding--just one sad, lonely little feta crumble. I decide to console myself with the gorgeous looking salmon fillet on top of the salad. Only as I am eating it, and getting closer to the center, I realize it isn't actually cooked all the way through. Ugh!   I could have sent it back but I'm afraid of trouser food so I never send stuff back. But seriously, how did they get this so wrong?? I mean, it's salad. How do you get that wrong? 

My brother-in-law ordered a steak medium well and was served a steak that was still bleeding. It formed a puddle on his plate. 

This place is definitely a tourist trap and not a quality place for locals.",abwO4VF4JcVYQ7CURAwsyw,2,1,1,8aS68vrgSSE8DwaILn2qzg

At night...

Booze soaked maws, whiskey samplers, and the sonic reverberation of live music come out. And don't forget the ridiculous shot specials that pulverize your liver with the power of a liquid gavel. Sometimes it's difficult to understand your what your friend is saying over the symbol crashing and the glass clacking, but that's why necks were built to nod. 

They also make bastardized grub that was meant for hangovers. Captain Crunch French toast is an actual menu item waiting to enrobe your taste buds. And if you're not in the mood to consume some starch, there's always the chance of seeing two girls fight over some swarthy dude at the bar. People really channel the Irish when they're here.

The Vegas Hennesey's was kind enough or naive enough to host the Las Vegas Hash House Harrier's annual Red Dress Run.

After Kanye West's performance at Life Is Beautiful, We all wanted to grab a bite somewhere close by, and we decided on Hennessy's Tavern . Cool, we never been, so let's try it out shall we?

The menu seems like there's something for everyone, and when it came down to it, I ordered their Slider Sampler which came with four types of burger-Avocado, BBQ, Bacon, and Cheeseburger. Our waitress asks me how I want my burgers done, and I specifically say MEDIUM RARE as those who know me, know I like my meat nice and pink...Steaks, Lamb,Prime Rib, BURGERS, etc. anything more, you would be doing the meat a very huge injustice IMO.

This is where it got worse. My order arrives, and as small as slider buns are already, they weren't even toasted and you barely could see the meat. Now I don't know if the cook in charge was trained by Chef Boyardee or The Hamburger Helper, but the juices had been cooked out of that meat and the inside wasn't even pink like I requested. Who knows? Maybe our waitress on top of being rude, had a hearing problem and heard well instead of rare? At least my Truffle Parmesan Fries were good and I had my root beer to help wash my burger down. I'd avoid this place at all costs and walk down further to Du Par's instead.  ALOHA!!!

The place wasn't that busy, one other table with a party about the same size and the rest of people at the bar. With 3 waitresses. 

8 minutes later our waitress shows up at our table to take our drink orders, average height lady with long brown hair, and goes off to retrieve all of the drinks. Comes back in a timely fashion with all of our drinks, perfect! Off to a great start.

Then it came to ordering food. She wasn't the least friendly and her approach was somewhat like ""what did you want"" so I responded with the mushroom burger ! Right after I finished saying mushroom burger she goes to hurry off to take the next order, as if she was rushing because she was busy or something even though she wasn't, so I sort of grabbed her attention quick to request my fries crispy with a side of mayo where she then looked at me sort of nodded said okay and kept taking the next persons order.

While We waited for food we also waited for our drinks to be refilled and When she did come by to refill she sort of just reached in rudely to grab the cups. 

Our food was delivered, with some assistance of the other waitresses I'm guessing, everyone's food was dropped off and our waitress just disappeared, no ""is there anything else you guys need? Are your orders correct?"" Because as I looked at my burger and fries I realized there was no mayo and the fries were some of the soggiest fries I've had in a long time, disgusting. But I get it nobody is perfect. I'll suck it up and eat the fries while waiting for her to come back so I can ask for the mayo for my burger. My cousin was also waiting for another beer at this point as well but nobody could find her. I finished my fries a good 10 mins later and then here comes our waitress walking out of the back with another waitress GOSSIPING like high schoolers right past our table, my mom waved her down trying to get her attention while saying ma'am and at that point our waitress had the audacity to give eye contact (that we ALL saw) and then continued on walking towards the bar and called her little buddy waitress to continue on to the bar as well where they finished their important conversation. After about another 7 minutes she finally returns to the table with my cousins beer and I then request a side of mayonnaise and she responded with a rude  ""WHAT?"" And I tell her that I never received the mayo that I had requested with my mayo, which I then Finally received. 

The burger was sub par, & it would be nice if you noted that you cook your burgers well done, so that those of us who like any sort of juiciness to our burger would be able to ask for such accommodations since it was extremely dry.

It would be understandable if it was during a busy night where the tables were full and the servers were running everywhere, the only problem is every time I've been here it's usually nearly empty and somehow the employees still seem to disappear.

The one thing it does have going for it however is its location right at the edge of the Freemont Street Experience.  So if you want to sit on the outside area and just relax and people watch, it can be enjoyable.  Avoid eating here though if you're any sort of time constraint though.

It's a group of people who post on an internet discussion board about Las Vegas.  I have known some of these people for over 10 years.

When the leader of the discussion board was trying to find a place that would accommodate that large a group of people, she gave Hennessey's a call and they offered us the Claddagh Room for three hours at no charge and they supplied a bartender for our group.

I've been to Hennessey's for two shows in the past few years and they were in the Claddagh Room.  It's a pleasant place with wood tables and chairs.  We were able to mingle or sit and talk.

I got a diet Coke that came in a small Mason jar with a handle.  The drink was $3.50 but there were unlimited refills.  The bartender was a very outgoing young lady and she was a pleasure!

Overall, prices were very reasonable, for this being close to the touristy hub of the Fremont street experience. The only issue was that service was choppy. We opted to sit outside on the patio and had a group of five. They had good drink specials ($5 for a shot and a beer) when we stopped in (late on a Monday night). I got the Reuben, without sauerkraut, and substituted a side salad with ranch. I was debating the French onion soup, but after asking the waitress, it seemed as though you couldn't substitute it and I wasn't going to pay $5 extra for it. Her comments may not have been completely clear but we were starving so I just went with the salad. My husband got the token shepherds pie dish, and I think everyone else at the table ordered burgers of some sort. I'd say the wait was a bit for our food, maybe over 30 minutes. It is hard to tell how busy they were since we never went inside. I enjoyed the food. My Reuben was plentiful with several slices of corned beef and the rye bread was a nice marbled blend, served toasted. The salad was legit good spring lettuce, topped with cheese, carrots, diced tomatoes, and enough ranch. My husband also enjoyed his shepherd pie and gave the leftovers to our friend that lives in town. Server was nice, but definitely towards the end she appeared to forget about us. It took her awhile to bring the bill and then even longer to return to run my husbands card (our other friends paid in cash). I would say just running and getting the card back took easily over five minutes, and I would assume by that time they were less busy (food-wise) than when we had arrived.",usznJIJoszv39M-bQpwfAw,1,1,3,aCWM0tTvunPg2DjRxrik7A

This is a fun place to stop in or spend the evening if you like the music.  The alcohol is reasonable priced, the food is quite good, too.  My favs being Guiness (24oz) and the Bananas Foster to drink and burgers & the truffles fries for nomming.  Some exceptional items are:

- Truffles Fries: ""...tossed with white truffle oil, Parmesan cheese & fresh parsley."" Contains no truffle, though still quite good.  (Google ""white truffle oil"" and you'll be a bit shocked)

- Prime Rib Sliders served with blue cheese & horseradish sauce.  Cooked to your temp & generally great beefy flavor with just enough bite that you don't eat the entire beef slice in your first bite. 

I typically go late on weekends which can be quite busy, so service does degrade a bit.  Lunch service has been good so far.

At least 75% of the guest were covered with orange, blue, yellow, and green.  This tavern is fairly big, but today's seating was limited with the amount of runners/walkers from the Color Run. Service today was just okay, not like the the great service that they usually have.

No thanks to this Irish run I've had this year (Irish food, Irish men, the little stout of Guinness at the Irish Bank, Irish leprechauns) stopping at Hennessey's Tavern was a must.  This delightfully typical dark pub with green accents was located at the end of Fremont Street and right before the stop for the Deuce.

We were there on a lunch hour lull, so we were able to get the seats right up back to the wall, with stools and a nice comfortable bench.  Looks like on an evening, they have live bands performing. 

I had been craving a salad since my eating habits here were so horrid.  I ordered the Cobb Salad and it was huge.  A huge platter of chopped romaine lettuce decorated with large strips of cheese, turkey, blue cheese, tomatoes, and avocado with ranch dressing.  While I was busy with this order, I managed to sneak a few of my friend's onion rings.  Mmmmm.  Now this was true beer batter.

This visit, it was a little on the bad service and a whole lot of crap food. It blew my mind.

This visit is during a Sunday, at lunch time, and it's not that busy.

We decided to order their ""greatest"" Irish nachos. We were left sorely unimpressed as the potatoes were limp/soggy and skint on toppings. Definitely far from anything ""great"".

My wife ordered a chicken sandwich for lunch. About a 1/4 of the way through she stopped mid bite and looked at it, then proceeded to cut it open in the middle. It had a near raw center. How on earth do you mess that up?

We alerted our server and it was taken away, and off our bill. That last bit we didn't expect as we were more concerned that if our food was undercooked, it could very easily be happening to others around us.

My one and only joy in this experience is drinking their World's Largest Pint (essentially a 60oz plastic drinking glass). 

Sadly, that beer alone can't save the disaster that was our experience.

I hope others will find this review helpful in deciding whether or not to gamble on eating here. I'm sure no one will go wrong with drinking here, but try the food at your own risk.",59WyVbDKkaWftg3u8DnjBQ,4,1,2,4DoAZrkgs_DIyWnw8TeeJg

In the past I've avoided this bar because it was always so busy.  Not that I am complaining.  I'd rather be in a (relatively) quiet place any how.  The music was a little loud but it was some good rock music so I didn't mind the volume.  It got more quiet when the one man band, a guy with an acoustic guitar, started playing to the mostly empty house.  He played mostly 90s era alternative music.  He wasn't half bad.  He even took requests.  Well, kind of. One member of my group asked him to play some Five For Fighting.  He did his best but admitted he did not know all the words.  I couldn't tell, honestly.  Then we started messing with him and my friends 11 year old son.  We told the kid to request ""Safety Dance.""  We got the best response from the singer when he said ""No. What? No. No.""  Oh, the laughs we had.  He got the joke and said he liked us.  That we were funny.  It was awesome.

On to the most important part, the food and drink.  Two of us ordered a pint of Guiness Blonde. Not a bad beer.  I would have preferred a darker beer but did not want to go so far as a stout. The blonde was refreshing regardless of the light color.  Also ordered was a root beer, a Sprite and a lemonade.  As for the food, two shepherds pies, a mushroom burger (mine of course), a regular burger with all the filler and a western burger minus most of the filler.  The food was good.  A lot of flavor.  Hot and fresh.  A fair price too.  About $12-13 for the burgers which on Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd isn't that bad.  The beer price shocked me.  $10 for a pint! That was a bit much but as I mentioned, Fremont and Las vegas Blvd.  I guess that is to be expected.

Service was neither good nor bad.  Our server wasn't overly attentive nor was she a ghost.  She took our order.  She brought our order.  She brought our check.  And she even split it for us.

I went to HT last night to partake of their 2-4-1 burger night (it's on Tuesdays). *sigh* I was disappointed. First off I ordered the Normal run-o-the-mill burger while my friend ordered one of the corn-beef hash burgers. My burger was NOT GOOD. I ordered it medium well, it came out WELL DONE, like super well done. Who wants to eat a dried up, over cooked burger? Not me. I asked for the Irish cheese, well when the burger came out the cheese was practically non-existent and it was just seared into the burger. I suspect a chef was not paying attention to this burger and just let it cook forever. I suspect this especially because it took quite awhile for our food to come out and the place was NOT busy. 

Another complaint: the burger came with ONE measly lettuce leaf and ONE slice of thin tomato! Well I guess they're trying to save money on the burgers because they're doing a 2-4-1 special? Guess what Hennessey's? It's not cool to offer a special deal and then skimp on the burger and turn it into a piece-o-crap that no one wants to eat! 

It is a good thing I got the Truffle Fries as an appetizer with the 50% off deal you can get by checking in on Yelp, otherwise I would have been really unhappy. But even the truffle fries were not my favorite as they were just covered in garlic. However, I enjoyed them over the burger.

The bartender here was nice and congenial, but the food ruined it for me. I will be back, but not for burger night and I definitely will not be ordering a burger from here ever again. Burger blacklisted!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,0,3,aLnQsrGVbxXEgh3PHQklKg

We walked up and down Fremont Street to see what was hoppin and nothing was really what we were looking for.  There was the piano bar ""Dont tell Mama"" that we had been thinking about trying and a comedy show at ""Beauty Bar"", the chill vibe with Juke tunes at the ""Griffin"" but nothing that really struck our mood.  We completely missed this place on our first round as bar next door had their music (journey and the like) pumpin' out into the street.  

We stopped right in front of Hennessy's to debate what we were going to do and then we SAW the band inside and realized that we were standing right in front of an Irish Pub.  Can't go to wrong with that, right?  So we decided to go on in and check it out.  We took a seat at a table by the stage and each ordered a Guinness.  The band ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" were playing and bantering back and forth.  SO MUCH FUN!  They made the evening. Great musicianship, great vocals, fun banter and a great mix of music... everything from Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphy's to Jeff Buckley, Neil Diamond and Fleetwood Mac.

The service was decent, prices were decent, the place was clean but there were no hand towels in the restroom all night long.  That was kind of a bummer.  All in all I will definitely go back and on a Friday night as I hear that same band has a regular gig there.

A friend ordered 5 Washington red Apple shots which are also a martini on the menu. So we got 5 of those and they were served in Double shot glasses half full or third full which is about a ounce a shot. Obviously the bartender thought were were dumb when making these and charged us the $9.50 a piece 3 oz martini price. So, most likely won't return because of this.

This place was your typical Irish looking pub.  Two toned walls, lots of dark wooden panels.  Not really a hip place.  More traditional and older looking but in a great location on Fremont!  

For lunch, I got the Hermosa Chicken Salad.  It's a salad filled with mixed greens, tomatoes, feta cheese, shaved carrots, cucumber, fresh strawberries, avocado & toasted pecans, tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  The chicken was a little dry but everywhere in the salad so I appreciated it better.  I LOVED the fact that this salad had avocados and strawberries.  That flavor combination and the texture combination with the crunchy pecans really made a great salad.  I ""slurped"" that salad right up and really enjoyed it at the end of the day.  

The best part: it was expensed!  Loved it.  I can't complain when the company is great and this lunch was no exception.

Probably the worst experience I've ever had in my lifetime.  You would think because of St. Patrick's Day weekend that they would have been a little more prepared for the crowds considering they are an Irish pub.    

Lunch on the 14th (2 adults), service was horrible.  They were out of things and the tables outside were dirty. They seemed to just be completely unorganized and unprepared.   

Unwanting by me after the lunch we had, we ate dinner on the 15th (8 adults), service was the worst I have ever experienced in my lifetime.  We sat outside and ordered our food on what was a very busy night.  Everyone was very hungry from a long day of bar hopping at a beer crawl in which this bar was on the list.  I understand it was busy, but no one should ever have to wait for over an hour for food anywhere anytime with no explanation.  When questioning the management why it was taking so long, they had no idea and they were very rude.  They were completely unorganized and their lack of leadership and communication with their staff was non existent.  One of the people in my party got very upset and went inside to talk to Mgmt.  I have no idea what happend as it still isn't clear to me from either side.  Unfortunately after this, management decided we all needed to be kicked out due to their behavior.  I calmly went back to ask what was going on and if our food could be sent out.  I asked if it would be ok if that one person could just be asked to leave.  They said they would send out our food in ""to go"" boxes and that we all had to leave with no explanation.  My order did not show up and really only 2 things came out in ""to go"" boxes.  I went back again to ask where my order was and they proceeded to tell me my order was sent to the wrong table to begin with and they couldn't do anything for me.  After much anger on my part for how we'd been treated and lack of service on their part, they tried to offer coupons for a later date.  I proceeded to tell them that I have no need for that because I am from out of town and I would never be eating there again.  In no way did they ever offer me something else to eat or offer to correct their horrible behavior and lack of service. Nor did they appologize for anything.  If the food wouldn't have taken over an hour and if it was sent to our table correctly none of this would have occured.

5144569,2012-10-26,0,eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg,"Ok people this is my very first time to write any review. IT WAS THAT BAD!!! Sorry it's kind of long but you will understand.

We drove out to Vegas from So Cal for about 5 hours and after we checked in the hotel we were pretty hungry.

We looked into the restaurant and it didn't look too busy so we decided to go in.

Four of us sat down without any hostess to a large table inside the restaurant. The server came pretty quick and gave us the menus. When she returned we ordered some beers to start off. After we got our beers we ordered right away since by then we were really hungry.

We ordered; chicken wings, fried calamari, 2 hamburgers. Pretty standard stuff.

So we waited for our food. Looking forward to finally eat!

15-20 min went by, the server came and we ordered another beers.

Another 15-20 min went by, and now we were really confused by why our food wasn't coming out. Not even the appetizers.

As far as we can see we saw 2 other tables that sat down and ordered after us and they got their food. And some of them were almost done eating!!

So I went up to the server to ask what's going on (since she was trying to avoid us, pretty sure) and she said, ""Sorry we are really busy tonight! Your food is coming out pretty soon!!"" with a annoyed attitude. But the restaurant WAS NOT busy. Ya, there were people, but not busy for sure. 

So finally 45-55 min after we ordered, the fried calamari came out. We looked at it with disbelief! It was SOOOOOOO DRY!! It was gross. You bite into it and you get nothing. They deep fried it too much that it shrunk. We always get calamari whenever we see it on the menu and this is the worst one that I ever got!! So we asked to take it back and take it off the tab.

Few min later the chicken wings came out. But same thing, too dry. And you know when you eat chicken wings you get the sauce all over your finger?? Ya, not this one, just really bad fried food. We didn't finish it. 

BTW, even though they said it was ""just made"" it was hard cold, not hot/warm at all!!!!

Then after another 5-10 min later the hamburgers came out. It came out cold. And didn't even have fries, just some old chips. 

I work at a restaurant and I know how long each food comes out. Nothing we ordered would take over 30 min. Specially fried food. 

We should of gone to In-N-Out instead. :(:(:(:(

We got the manager to talk to and he gave us the same crap about how ""busy"" they were. They offered to take 10% off and nothing else to compensate on our worst night ever. Don't lie to your customer, if you forgot to put in the order or the chefs forgot to make the order or you forgot to pick it up to take it out to the customers, just tell them you messed up and do a better job than 10% off to make the customers happier.

We were really disappointed and hungry after all.",tinJ_68uBXv58zYxu8X2Yg,1,0,1,_JgaR8xoGOsKTmUIk056hw

And, it isn't everywhere that you can find a portabella. The other tasty item here are their tater chips. I am pretty sure they are homemade, and you can get a basket of them all by their delicious selves for the perfect beer accompaniment.

There were six of us and only three were drinking (which the server did not seem happy about).  We started with some Jameson/Gingers and then their house drink the Dublin Donkey.  We were asked by our server, Erin, if we wanted doubles.  We said yes.  After the first sip, we all commented on the lack of whiskey in the drinks, but our server was not to be found so we decided to deal with it.  Now, I've worked in the restaurant business most of my life and have drank at many high end bars across the country, so I know a double should cost more.  Usually it has been anywhere from $2-$6 added to the initial price of the drink.  So imagine our surprise here when we discovered that a double was actually 2x the price of the drink.  Translate this to $15 jameson/gingers and $18 Dublin Donkeys!!  
We were appalled!  7 drinks, 3 shots... $125!!!  We confronted the server about it and she rudely told me how thats the policy because its double the alcohol and refused to change the check (despite our insisting that those drinks were in no way ""doubles"").  
While the price was outrageous I would have been able to get over it if the environment was outstanding (our drinks were served in plastic cups) or the service (Erin was no where to be found half the time, and acted as if she hated her job).

The day after I called to ask the manager if this was really the policy.  With a rude tone, I was again told that that those drinks were indeed that expensive!  No attempt to right this obvious scam was given!

First off, it's fun to people watch.  Vegas tourism (and even the locals) bring out some colorful characters, and with the outdoor seating, you get a front row view of the best (or worst) humanity has to offer.

The beers are good, the mixed drinks are good, and even their food is good (they make a mean corned beef on St. Patty's).  They sometimes have Irish bands play, and the enthusiasm makes a night of drinking with friends all the more merry.  They even have a mechanical bull, for crying out loud.  Is that ""hardcore bar"", or what?

But the real highlight is Sandra, a server that I always see every time I go these.  That girl is super cool, funny as everything, and greets me with a hug every time I see her.  She's always busy, but never so much so that she doesn't do top notch service or joke around.  She's a class act.

We went ahead and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, and our entrees. 
I had an Irish mule, which was pretty good and for our appetizer we had - , they were tasty but undercooked. For my entree I had the Frisco burger. The Parmesan sourdough bread was yummy! However, the burger was dry and the 1000 island dressing was left off.

Rather disappointing since this was suppose to be rated as being one of the best Bloody Mary in town (and at their other California locations). It's listed on the menu as ""HENNESSEY'S FAMOUS BLOODY MARY"".

Yeah. I didn't taste any vodka in this one either. The tomato juice seemed old and flat.  I had to request (and pay an additional $8.25) for another shot of Ketal Vodka to be mixed into my drink.

I got a bite of Bud's sammie and thought it was pretty tasty. There was a good amt of Irish cheddar, swiss & jack cheese in the sandwich. The bowl of tomato bisque was just okay. I was missing the familiar tang that is expected in a good bowl of tomato soup, also a touch of salt would've helped.

The grilled steak was nicely seasoned and cooked to the right med rare doneness. 
The bad part about this dish was that it was overall dry due to the eggs being overcooked, it sucks not having enough egg yolk or salsa to help soften up the dish. 

The home fries were nice and crispy though.

Overall, it was just okay for us. The menu looked great but failed on execution and flavors for the most part. Maybe we weren't the only ones hungover that day.",lsSiIjAKVl-QRxKjRErBeg,22,20,3,1cu_7a5qiN23UrAMNU7XTA
5522430,2014-12-09,0,eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg,"This place ranks #4 on my List of Best Irish Pubs in Las Vegas, beaten out by the Nine Fine Irishmen in the New York New York, R√≠ R√° in the Mandalay Bay, and McMullan's Irish Pub (which is a freestanding pub next to the Orleans Hotel and Casino, a bit west of the strip on Tropicana). This isn't to say that the place isn't a great place to grab a pint (and my favorite spot for Guinness on Fremont Street), though since the whole place is intentionally built to resemble a pint of Bass Pale Ale (which is an English beer, not an Irish one), it naturally ranks lower on the list.
The service is pretty good for Fremont Street, a place where more often than not you'll interact with Gene Simmons and Michael Jackson lookalikes for longer amounts of time than you will with your average restaurant server. We never found ourselves without a fresh pint when we needed one, and there was always a smile connected to the hand that brought our beer.
The decor is nice and feels moderately Irish, in the same way that the mock-up of the Eiffel Tower in the Paris Hotel and Casino feels moderately Parisian. You know what it's supposed to look like and it does the job. It's not as authentic as my other picks, but if you want the Irish feel instead of the tiki bar nearby, well, this is your spot.
The prices are a bit lower than those on the Strip, as is often the deal with Downtown, and though we didn't try the food, what I saw told me that you get a pretty fair deal for what you're paying. If you're looking to go out for some really authentic Irish food, hit up R√≠ R√° or McMullan's, but if you're just looking for a nice pint of Guinness to complete your day in Downtown, look no further than Hennessey's.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,2,0,4,TG-1cczdNOn_zwi4GlIcSw
5558292,2014-04-17,0,eSLwC2iFJOU4UWXyuPiTpg,"If it weren't for the food, I would give Hennessey's 1 star. Not worth it.

My visiting friend and I were looking to eat somewhere downtown where we could enjoy the weather and sit outside. They have open seating, if you can call it that, so we ordered a drink at the bar (8$ for a miller light..what??) and waited for a table to open up outside. As a couple nearby was on their way out, we asked the waitress if it were okay for us to go ahead and take the table. She cleared off the table and didn't give us an answer for a significant amount of time until she replied ""well are you going to be eating?"" I understand serving people who order food will generally give you a greater tip, but regardless if we were planning on eating or not, that question probably isn't the best way to increase those dollars. 
While waiting for our food to come we saw another strange interaction occur with the open seating. We noticed a group of five or six looking for an outdoor seat, exchange words with the waitress, and head to the bar to pick up drinks. In the mean time, the group at the table next to us had paid and left the restaurant, and two young women saw the open table and sat down. They sat for a few minutes before the waitress came over and told them she promised the table to a group that had been waiting over thirty minutes (false, ten max). The girls obliged, and the group claimed the table. I don't think open seating is the best option for this place. Holy confusion.
Besides the odd seating issues, our table was not clean, nor stable. This restaurant needs a serious face lift!

As for the food, we split the crispy calamari and mesquite turkey sandwich. The calamari was cooked well, not chewy, and nice and crisp! It was a hefty portion and  served with three different sauces. The sandwich was awesome! It was served on a warm  pretzel bun with a mass amount of turkey, tomato, lettuce, swiss cheese, and dijon aioli. Yum!

Or, just don't ever go to this place to watch sports.",CerZy20B4Eo0ZlaLoPF5qg,6,2,1,FY94aRwsPnPsPdmUQMMQyA

We located a spot on the patio for the best spot to people watch. Service was friendly, albeit incredibly SLOW given how not so busy the place was. Drink orders were mixed up and our large order of french fries took about 45 minutes to come out. 

Great location and typically when I come the service is much better, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that the Halloween crowd slowed them down a bit. 

Definitely a good little place to take a seat and rest with a beverage or some pub grub while you're downtown. People watching from the patio is a plus!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,12,10,3,oqzWJ_avuQ78wXUHmSVi8A
