Three words: Chicken Parm Sliders.

You can technically sit down at the tables here and order food from the neighboring Triple George Grill but, at heart, this place is really just a dive bar with fantastic bar food.

It takes on a completely different theme and angle from the normal crappy food we get served at bars. As a light-weight who needs food with her alcohol, this place is perfect. I can order my drinks and order food I actually enjoy eating along with them. 

Best part is, the drinks AND the food are reasonably priced. Definitely a happy hour worth checking out.

The service does get a little shoddy as the place starts picking up later in the evening, but the cheap drinks and delicious food make it easy to ignore that. I'd say this little bar is the best place to go drinking afterwork in the whole downtown area.",I3XJNDCe50zG7ddKDCDqAA,2,1,5,A4VwJ8wKtK7V2QTre1DgAA

You can get tapas, brunch, lunch, a nice dinner, a sandwich, fresh salad, home-style plates, bar food, pasta, seafood and vegan/vegetarian delights (ask for the separate menu) all under the same roof. 
Wash all this food down with a craft cocktail---my favorite is 'The Usual'--or select from a large variety of bottle beer and wine.

A guy from outside of the ""702"" shouldn't have this much information, but I do. People have called me ""The Boss"" before, so maybe it's a bit of syndicate thing. 

Mob Bar is located about a block from Fremont Street. The bar is pretty much inside  of the newly renovated Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino. As one might expect, there is a swanky mobster feel to the place. We walked in and lady luck snagged us a table near the band. As usual the music was good and our waitess was on top of things. Everyone seemed to be having a great time.  

Just sitting in the classy Mob Bar, it is hard to fathom that you are merely a short block away from the madhouse on Fremont Street. Mob Bar is truly an island in a sea of madness.

The epanada was ok the creme fraish was too light for the meat. It needed more of a kick to give it a more punch. Otherwise it just tasted like meat and pastry.a little too bland. 
 
The hanger steak tarter was too greasy  I really shouldn't  see oil pooling in the jar. There was not enough of the acidic to cut it.   Also I prefer my tartar more a perfect cubed than the random chopped. The meat became more grounded almost moosh than I like.

BUT....you will have to ignore the fact that from the outside this place looks like it is closed or is a dive bar.  I would add an awning over the front door or build out the entrance to make it feel like this is a special place to visit.  

The Mob Bar used to be the Side Bar but that one closed and now this bar is capitalizing on the Mob Museum that has opened just down the street in the old courthouse.  It is not a large bar but it is cozy with a long comfy bench along the front window, oversized booths and about 10 seats at the bar.

We visited twice in 18 hours.  A good sign - locals eating in the bar at booth lunch and dinner.  The wait staff is a little indifferent but they are quick and the food is really good.  I felt comfortable in the bar but if you want to have a drink and go to a resturant for dinner, they have you covered - the Triple George part of the Mob Bar and is right next door.  

They could improve things by working on the customer service of the bar tenders but I really enjoyed the food.

The liquor menu is vastly improved.  Specifically, their whiskey shelf is growing.  They've brought in some scotches, as well as several smaller distillery bourbons and rye whiskeys.  A tip of my hat to the bar manager for stepping up his game.

I'm also willing to throw in another star because of the vast improvement in customer service.  About 6 months ago, it was clear that the servers and bartenders couldn't handle a rush and they were getting frustrated.  The last few times I've been here, the servers seem to be enjoying themselves and the staff has learned to keep up with the happy hour rush.  Thumbs up on the customer service improvements.

I still think the food is still merely decent, but the atmosphere is relaxed and with the improved liquor menu and service, I am raising the bar to 4 stars.  It's become a great happy hour spot.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,1,0,4,OzPWhD7GkiEw9xnNAjGkQQ

I still love Downtown Cocktail Room, but this is a much different vibe.  And it has food, which of course is a plus because I usually want something to eat after a few cocktails!  

The atmosphere is, for lack of a better word, very cool.  I would bring my friends here because I want them to know I'm aware of the ""hot spots"", but that I'm not uber-trendy.  Trust me, I've been to as many clubs as the next girl.  But I'm beyond the club phase now (I'm married and have kids, but I haven't accepted the life of a boring mom just yet) and I'm happy just to find a great place to eat with fancy cocktails and interesting people-watching.  I live in Summerlin and I'm always complaining about not having a great go-to dinner place other than Vintner Grill.  Well, this is my new go-to!

I've sampled all the food and my favorites are the Carpaccio, the Arancini de Riso (risotto balls), and the Chicken Parm Sliders.  The best thing is, all of the menu items are pretty much $10 and under.  So you can taste everything on the menu for way less than what it would cost for everyone to go to a trendy restaurant and order entrees. And they are all plated beautifully.  The best thing is, the amazing chef Ro is there and will come over and say hi.

It's a pretty chill spot, and they offer food so that's pretty cool, nothing really stands out from their food menu besides the mussels which were hella tasty. 

However, the name is mob BAR, so, you kind of expect to do more drinking at this kind of place.

I was here about a month ago and ordered a mojito. It's gross and tastes like flat soda water, my boyfriend takes the drink back, the bartender/manager of the place tastes my drink and is like, OHHH, i forgot to add syrup.

......riiiiiiight.

So whatever, he remakes the drink. Actually, he technically doesn't even remake it, he just adds the syrup to my original drink. No mint leaves, no sugar cane stick of deliciousness. ok, FINE, and he doesn't even comp the drink. thats cool, whatever.

i'm here over the weekend. stupidly, i order a mojito again, because shit, i fucking like them, AGAIN, the mojito tastes like garbage. i ask the same manager/bartender to remake the drink. he gives a lame excuse about the soda being weird on his end of the bar blah blah blah just make the drink. I try the new mojito, its bland and somewhat flat again.

I'm irritated at this point, and I ask him what the deal is, and why my friends mojito (made by a different bartender) tastes correct, and mine doesn't. He goes back to the whole ""soda on his side of the bar is weird"", excuse, so i ask him, ""why dont you make my drink with the soda from that end of the bar, or better yet fix the soda on this end instead of making bad drinks"". At this point, he actually shrugs at me, and i go, ""I'm sorry, but aren't you the manager?"" 

""I'm the manager, not the technician"". That is what the manager says to me, he walks away and does not even offer to comp the drink when i ask for just a water instead. 

AWESOME customer service, jackass. i get that mojitos can be somewhat of a pain in the ass to make, but c'mon, this isn't supposed to be some dive bar, i thought this was a nicer place than that so i expect the drinks to be somewhat decent. 

in closing, chill place, the other bartenders are nice, the food is ok, do NOT get a drink made by the ""manager/bartender"".",mloua2rXvKQuayyY9KqEhg,5,0,2,l-b-gmRG40CEh7VKt96t3A

We seated ourselves at the bar and automatically greeted by our bartender, Adam. We received a BOGO cocktail for checking into Yelp! Adam was clueless about this offer and had to check with his manager first. But we Yelpers won & each got a free drink. Yay! 

Madison Ave $10 -- very delicious. I definitely did not taste the alcohol but I did feel it after. It had a cinnamon sugar rim that really had me goin & I hate cinnamon! But together it just complimented each other. 

Mint Coffee Martini $13 -- the beau got it. I'm not a fan of coffee based drinks so I really didn't like it. 

ScoobieDoo cocktail -- off the menu. It's suppose to be a shot but Adam made it into a cocktail & it tasted just like juice! I loved it. 

Now what really made this place memorable was the singers at the piano. They were full of character and had amazing voices. You were able to request songs for $5. It was worth it!

I met up with some friends on a busy First Friday night and yes it was packed but the vibe was so eclectic and the buzz was music to my ears. We were able to get a table for the 5 of us and before we knew it hours had passed by. 

Their drink menu was something reminiscent of an old speakeasy, I saw combinations on the menu that I never heard of and types of alcohol I am sure my great-great grandmother drank in her hey day. I had a martini (I can't remember the name of it) that was pink and girly and soooo tasty! My second drink was something similar to a 20's version of a Mojito...but better! It was so refreshing and the two drinks were enough to prevent me from drinking the rest of the night. My favorite part of this bar was the beautiful songbird that had her own spin on some of my favorite Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Adele songs. Listening to her put me into a wonderful trance...or maybe it was my drinks that did that. 

I have always had an affection for everything old time, stepping into this bar really makes you feel as if you went back in time...I cannot wait to go back, hmm...wonder if I have a cute flapper dress I can wear. :-)",AFiFCVIqbyBrkL5AIeMUjA,4,3,5,YKvBHt2-fxq3CNrIXgg99g

But for downtown, where mostly locals go to hangout, I think not enticing us with a happy hour is a stuck-up move for the area. I'm guessing they want the tourists from the Mob Museum to pay full price. 

So you're paying the usual Las Vegas prices for a cocktail (avg $13 for martini, my fav) and although the bartender was nice and the waitress did a good job checking on us, only a few patrons were there, so it wasn't as if they were overwhelmed. The ambiance is stellar and it's a nice, quiet joint to have a martini with your friend and chit chat without screaming over the music, but I won't be returning. There are many other places downtown that are a better deal and more fun.

3651935,2011-12-07,0,bz69msmKwRjWQzN-XwyV6Q,"This is a really cool new place!  I was meeting some work friends at the Triple George the night it opened so we thought we'd check it out.  I started with their signature drink ""The Usual""  It is an infused burbound drink that is meant to highlight the cherry notes.  The bartender had a much more eloquent description, all I know is it was unique and delicious.  I tried sips of my friends drinks but don't remember any of the names, just that they were all very good and creative.  

The food...we got to meet Chef Ro, who helped us pick a few things off their menu.  Everything ranges from $6-$9 and has about 4 bite size servings.  

Spaghetti and meatballs - a fork with spaghetti twirled on it with a meatball on the end.  It was my favorite!  The meatball was juicy and tender, the spaghetti and sauce were great.  I dare you to try to eat it in one bite.

Risotto Balls - it has some other fancy name but I forget.  It was cripsy on the outside, warm and creamy on the inside.  Chef Ro recommended it and he was right, I could eat those all night.

Eggplant Rollatini - I'm not a huge fan of eggplant but this was a close second in the competition for my favorite dish.  It was like a mini-lasagna explosion in my mouth...minus the pasta.  Cheesy, gooey, heaven.

Shrimp and Proscuitto - Shrimp wrapped in bacon in a butter sauce....need I say more?!  The shrimp was larger than I expected, the proscuitto was fresh and the butter sauce would make anything taste delicious.  The only reason it wasn't #1 was because the proscuitto wasn't at all crispy.  I don't think Chef Ro wanted it to be crispy but I think it would have been better that way.

Fancy Grill Cheese - Obviously they have another name for it but I'm drawing a blank.  It is delicious cheese, between egg-washed bread that is dredged in cheese.  Sounds better than it tasted.  The egg-wash made it taste french toasty....sweet and cheesy...didn't work for me.

Beef Carpacio - It looked great but I didn't get to try it because my buddies Mom ate the whole thing, and ordered a second and ate that one too.  I guess it was good!

It is a fairly small, lounge style place.  The bartenders and cocktail servers 1920 uniforms are fun.  I love the atmosphere, good strong drinks, delicious easy to eat food and friendly knowledgeable staff....I will definitely be back.",LnZfyAcTPN7Lc7DJxeGlOQ,4,2,5,JjsgyPZ9NKsAB6hjz1eepw

Anyway, I don't have much to judge this place on so I can't really stray too far from a 3 star review anyways.  I had a few jack+diets and my friend had a beer.  Decently priced if I recall.

The food is actually from next door from the King George or whatever it's called.

Service was fine.  They got the men wearing suspenders and whatnot.  The women wear corsets.  It's a real small place.  Maybe 15 spots at the bar.  7 or 8 tables.  It used to be called Sidebar.

It's a play on the ingredients--the ""Mass"" comes from macerated something something and the ""Exodus"" is from the bitters used i.e. The Bitter Truth E**X**R. I actually Googled the latter in order to somewhat make up for my lack of knowledge of the former.

Apparently, this place hasn't really changed since it was the Sidebar. You know what? Who cares? The decor fits the theme perfectly. The speakeasy vibe is definitely represented well.

We had heard about this place from a dame we know who has a serious crush on their chicken Parmesan sliders, but as we don't take any wooden nickels, we decided to check this place out for ourselves.

What we discovered was not only the bee's knees, but the cat's pyjamas, too.

This joint serves a dozen or so ""small plates"" that would make an Italian mamma proud, and as they were priced between $5 and $10, and we expected them to be small given our experiences elsewhere, and we were quite famished going in, we ordered most of what was on the menu.

Our late lunch started with some crispy but tender Arancini di Riso (risotto balls stuffed with Romano and mozzarella cheese), continued with tasty spaghetti and meatball ""bites"" presented on a tasting fork (an idea that has already inspired some of our own dinner party appetizers), found its way to some clams casino served in a succulent white wine butter sauce, then jumped onto some Shrimp Spiedini that were wrapped in prosciutto, and finished with the chicken Parmesan sliders that are now destined to become a regular snack whenever we find ourselves downtown.     

Every plate was perfection and we were not disappointed, but we were stuffed half way through this meal that exceeded our expectations -- both for taste and value -- as the chefs here do not take the ""small plate"" idea literally. They're no pikers when it comes to their food, and a couple of these offerings were more than enough to make a whole meal, so no beefs here.

We were also very impressed with this gin mill's beverage program that rivals some of the better mixology bars on the strip and serves up some of the best giggle water in this part of town for two-thirds of the price and with no compromises.

I was overjoyed to find my favourite classic cocktail on the menu -- the Blood and Sand --  prepared classically with 12-year-old Balvenie Doublewood Scotch, a splash of orange juice, Carpano Antica Sweet Vermouth, and Heering cherry liqueur. Hotsy totsy! 

You can also celebrate the 1920s with a number of ""theme drinks"" like the Clara Bow (named after the ""It Girl"" of that era) that mixes Jim Beam Devil's Cut Bourbon, Domaine the Canton ginger liqueur, Falernum, green Tabasco, and a hint of lemon.

I visited on a Monday evening, and the place was pretty empty, so I can't comment on how the experience all comes together during high traffic times, but it  was a nice spot to gather for specialty cocktails and chatting. I really appreciated the fact that because it was a slow night, I was able to park right on 3rd street for free and walk just a handful of feet to the front door! I love easy parking.

Even though there were no cocktail waitresses working, the bartender made a point to come over to our group more than once to see if we needed anything else. The music was a smidgen loud, but they were happy to accommodate a request to lower the volume. It is a comfortable spot to grab a good cocktail for around $9, but I wouldn't say the overall vibe left a strong impression. That could have been because it was a Monday evening or because it felt a bit like a man cave to me. One bonus: you can order food in the bar. Happy Hour is 4-7pm, but I missed it!

5458022,2012-09-07,1,bz69msmKwRjWQzN-XwyV6Q,Downtown bars typically are dirty or expensive.

5588117,2012-04-05,0,bz69msmKwRjWQzN-XwyV6Q,"We tried it out on a Tuesday and it was a nice change of pace. It's definitely in a much quieter part of downtown and the amount of people inside that night reflected it.

 The cocktails were really great. We tried the ""Brass"" and the ""Volstead act"", both of which were well made and exceeded our expectations. They cost about $10-12 each and were worth it. They were some of the better cocktails I've had in Vegas. I'd give the place 5 stars based not he cocktails we had.

 The food was sort of uninspired. It wasn't expensive ($5-$6 a plate) and the quantities were large, but the taste just wasn't there. I feel like they'd be better off scaling back the portions and using better quality ingredients. The spaghetti bites were our favorite part and the ""grilled cheese"" our least favorite. I'd give the place 2 stars based on the food.

 The service was great and so was the ambience; I really liked the feel of the place. I'll go back again, but will probably stick to cocktails.",zaC3L_qy28bMLIvnoMng8Q,1,0,4,gVSxGt4Uw4CFsFVgWXJHqA

5924287,2013-01-21,0,bz69msmKwRjWQzN-XwyV6Q,"I like the atmosphere in here -- it's semi-throwback without being douchey about it. Unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of whisky, rye, bourbon, scotch, cognac, brandy, or gin, and most of the drinks on their menu are based off one or more of these, since they're old-timey-type drinks. They do have one vodka-based drink (ahh, now you have my attention), the Manhattan Avenue, which I order every time I go because it's pretty damn tasty (cinnamon on the rim is a rare find, and it works well with this drink). Their little tapas-type bar food offerings are decently tasty (chicken parm sliders, caprese salad in toothpick-skewer form, spaghetti & meatball bites, and calamari are some of the ones I've tried), and they make a good alternative to sitting down for a full-on dinner before you head out elsewhere for the evening. Service has been a bit slow at times, in that it can sometimes take a while to get initially acknowledged if you're not sitting at the bar, or if there are more than 10 people in there. As reviewer Ed M. noted, the bartenders aren't always knowledgable about cocktails that aren't on their menu, even simple/common ones. I agree that it's good, but could be great with a little help in the service department.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,6,1,3,TvKnVbzVM45uJaKwtzXyPA
