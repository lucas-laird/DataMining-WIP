Both were good, with plenty of filling- maybe a but heavy on the almonds in that crepe but it's hard to know how much of each filling someone will want, and I didn't specify the amount. The basic Nutella crepe is $4.95 with an additional $1 for each additional topping/filling; except ice cream which is $2 extra. They have ice cream crepes, hot crepes, and savory crepes; and boba smoothies. I wanted to try the Thai iced tea or lychee flavored boba drinks but at $5.95 each I didn't think it was worth it for me especially with all the calories I was already consuming.

755251,2012-02-16,0,KYr67K-Ot9HKkv90KaXL5w,"This is by far one of the best crepes that I've had and I think it's a decent price. I always go for the strawberry banana whipped cream and add nutella. The crepe texture is exactly how I like it...not too eggy, not to crispy...a nice light crepe cooked well with a little bit of stretch to encase all of the filling. The strawberries and bananas are always fresh and they never skimp on the fruit, whipped cream or nutella, which is a huge plus in my book.

I was between a 4 and a 5 on this one. My only gripe is that it always takes forever and a half for them to complete my order. But you can place your order for your crepe and order your actual food and come back to find it ready for you to pick up. :) I guess that's the good thing about it being a part of the food court at Fashion Show Mall.

791999,2015-04-15,0,KYr67K-Ot9HKkv90KaXL5w,"I was here on the 25th of february, I ordered a Green apple boba/bubble/milk tea with pearls(the bobas) 

Imagine my surprise when i'm given a bright, green drink. That was sickeningly sweet, SOUR and the consistency of a slushie. I was totally shocked.

Anyone who has had an authentic taiwanese/chinese even hongkong style bubble/boba tea drink knows that wasn't what it is. It was almost insulting to say this what they call boba tea in a asian owned establishment, at a high end mall. I sure hope this is not what they consider authentic boba tea. 

I've had it in my hometown many times, in Beijing, in Shanghai, and it's never been given to me in this manner. I would totally remove it from the menu as ""boba"" tea and replace with a very sweet icy slushy.
 

I'm sure no asian who has experience with boba tea would ever even enjoy or think this was the real thing.. i'm not sure who they are trying to fool.. unless you're someone who has never had it before. 

Skip this place for boba tea, and find a GOOD AUTHENTIC, RECOMMENDED PLACE. Seems to be a theme in Vegas for whatever reason (looking at reviews for other places) that they don't make it the authentic, normal way.. and i really don't know why.

The real ones are made with fresh water/milk, milk powder, powdered fruit/real fruit, blended until totally smooth like water, sometimes with or without ice.. and sometimes served warm. 

It is very creamy/milky tasting, and the flavor is strong but mild and not overpowering  (basically it is the flavor that you asked for) and it is usually a LIGHT shade of the kind of fruit or tea you got.  Usually with tons of pearls ( bobas) on the bottom, made from tapioca or without.


It's a really tasty drink when done well, but please do not think this is the real deal.. because you will be disappointed.


The people who work there are friendly and nice, but clearly have no experience or any knowledge on what an authentic boba tea is.",tfkUeoQyyqjs28q2mtba5g,0,0,1,UCofN2t0qSAExnArArZMVQ

The lifeblood of a crepe is the pancake.  My personal preference are the very light, almost melt-in-your-mouth type with crispy ends.  Here, it's just a tad too thick and chewy.  There is also a hint of the flour taste, which sort of kills it.  Nutella and banana combo is a can't-miss, so despite the imperfect wrap it was decently satisfying.  The chocolate & almond was okay, they give you a lot of almond which is great, but I just don't think these ingredients are quite complete enough to make a full crepe.

I used my Crackberry to give me a list of a few crepe places on the Strip and up jumps Crazy Crepes.

Me being the person who hates the consumeristic shit that Vegas throws upon us, I skipped all of the high end clothiers and other assorted bullshit in the Fashion Square Mall and decided to quench my crepe thirst here.  

They ingeniously placed pictures and pertinent signage of nearly every crepe on the menu.  That gives the visual person like me a chance to take a look at what the fuck I am eating before ordering.  For others it isn't necessary, but for me this is compulsory.  After I ordered, I realized that they had a full menu of all kinds of crepes including ice cream.

I decided to order the Blueberries and Cream crepe.  Vanilla ice cream and whipped cream accompanied this piece of shit.  

Vegas is known for finding inventive ways to siphon money out of the tourist's pocket when they arrive and this is one more way to do it.....if one doesn't shop, gamble, or take advantage of the numerous ways to obtain sex in the 702, then dine at places such as these.  

At least the eye candy was impressive.",4WLBYT9wHBcK-nQxiNvn8Q,4,4,2,DeihdZpx6BfbcR8JUjJlUQ
