23664,2017-03-22,4,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"Went for lunch . Ordered a $15 chicken sandwich (too expensive by any standard )
Which came with option of soup or salad . 
Chose the Pasta Fagioli soup . Was gross lacked any seasoning , and was too starchy with only a few small pieces of pasta . It more  resembled a white bean  soup . Not good had to send back after 1 bite . Chicken sand. Was just meh.... 
Dry sandwich with zero dressing / mayo or anything . Tomatoes were not fresh . Few small pieces of welted greens and again lacked any seasoning . 
The person I came with ordered the lasagna which was burnt on the bottom . 
This place used to be better . It pisses me off when restaurants just don't give a damn about taste and quality yet still want to charge double for a gross and disgusting sandwich. I will never return nor will I recommend to any1 with tastebuds . and I hope ur greedy asses go from Grand opening to Grand closing .... Get a new chef or start caring more .",aahxmN1tsvlufuU_y4OT1A,5,0,1,Cf_wzV44jdpMlDN_G262-g

121201,2017-05-14,0,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"Experiences at this place are always inconsistent. Ordered the shrimp scampi and was so disgusted, I sent it back and ordered nothing else, while waiting for my family to finish their meals. Tried to mix the noodles in sauce, of which, there was very little, but the sauce was flavorless, like water with salt and lemon juice. Very bad. Wait staff said the chef/cook tasted and confirmed, ""yep, no flavor"" and that the guy who made it was new. Please spend the extra $ to hire a ""real"" Chef who knows Italian cooking and until then, don't try to pass this place off as a fine dining experience. The ""owner"", who sat at the bar the whole time we were there drinking wine, sent the waiter over to offer us a free dessert, never once coming to our table to acknowledge my complaint. I watched as one of the waiters spoke to him while looking at us, expecting him to come over and meet with us, but no, he just sat there keeping that seat warm. News flash, if you own the place and care about the quality of the food and service in your establishment, you should be on your feet checking the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen and engaging your customers to make sure their experience is good. ESPECIALLY, when you know the quality of it is poor. You chose to acknowledge us in the parking lot as we were leaving at the same time commenting, ""hope you had a good meal""....No, we didn't...and you know that, WTF??? This is how you engage? What a joke! Have you ever owned a restaurant before or did you just see the $$$$ signs and figured you'd give it a shot? The gentleman who owned this place before, and took his life savings to do it, was a humble man and really cared about what was being served to his customers. Back then, the food was authentic and good. His livelihood depended on it!! No complaints about our waiter.",-TuRHIGyJdaiPDJZ-OU3ig,0,0,1,8yuEDaiyk00sTfixE7CLqQ

The man who came over only offered sparkling or still water not thinking there was another option we ordered the still later to be charged $6 for water. He also tried to do the same thing after we ordered our meal with and appetizer but the way he presented it was like he's offering it to you not expecting to pay (like the water). From then on he was staring at us and continuously arguing with his co workers. We were already feeling uncomfortable. Then we got our calamari and it just didn't taste good so we didn't eat it, he then asked if we didn't like it and I was truthful and said no. He took it and said we will remove it from your check. He walked away and told the kitchen from the down stairs dining to the up stairs kitchen in from our the whole room we didn't like it. At this point I'm mortified and just want to leave.

Ate last Saturday mar.11 with the whole family. It was my hubby's first time so i ordered the speck pasta. After ordering it, our server asked him soup or salad and my hubby chose soup. Our serverr replied with a name of a soup and we thought maybe that was the soup of the day. My children were surprised  the pasta cane with soup or salad. The server didn't ask would you want soup or salad, he came off like my husband should choose one or the other. Well, the mystery was solved when we saw an extra $7.95 on our bill. Aside from that, my daughter asked him to add chicken to her pasta, well he added shrimp which costs more. Is he trying to pull a fast one on all his customers? We had him change it but i am sure they just took out the shrimp and replaced it with chicken because it didn' t take long to replace. Good thing my daughter has no allergy to shrimp!. First time around everything was good. I will still go back but i will make sure he is not our server! I will never forget his face.

Back then, the cold cut and cheese platter was large and the most delicious I have ever had.  Now, the portions are smaller, the cold cuts lack flavor and the cheeses seem like they just go down to Smiths grocery and pick up some very cheap cuts.

Ordered the Spaghetty Western and carbonara and the noodles, which were once freshly made and al dente, now seem like they come from a box and over cooked.  The prosciutto used is dry, chewy and lacks a lot of flavor.

The first time I dined there and had a Caesar salad and the lobster ravioli. Caesar was nothing special but the ravioli was great. Service was prompt and friendly. I would give that visit 4 stars. 

Today we ordered takeout. I ordered:

The Northern caprese 
Caesar salad
Meatball appetizer
Calabrese sandwich 
Manicotti

A lot of food- and for $63 including delivery fee/tax, I would expect it to be delicious... but it really fell short this time. 

The tomatoes on the caprese disappointed me most. So far from ripe the middles were completely white. If that's all you have, I think the item should be removed from the menu until you have better produce. You can't have a caprese with bad tomatoes. 

Caesar was same... But lettuce was a little wilted here and there. 

The garlic bread was super dry and even stale tasting. Maybe because of the delivery time. 

My boyfriend said the meatballs were ""meh,"" and the calabrese got a thumbs down. 

My manicotti was fine. Not bad. Not good. Honestly I like the premade ones at trader joes better.

My wife and I ordered and split an Alex  salad which was good.   We asked if bread was served, assuming it was complimentary.  A small portion of garlic bread was served.

I am not a beer expert but checked at the local store which sells Wasatch for $8.99 per six-pack.  I thought the $8.00  was excessive for a 12  oz. happy hour offering.

My favorite is the Bobbi (just ask to add chicken or otherwise customize your dish they will try hard to please you) or the Pasta Speck, which is not on the current menu, but will hopefully be back (again, just ask, and they'll make it for you). Best tiramisu I've ever had. Say hi to David; he'll make you feel welcome and treat you like family.",mlJE4MTY3dKD-bJA-kYqsw,1,1,5,N0vDfjcNMUHFDjc1SBG5pg

1317896,2014-09-24,2,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"Stopped in last night to check out the new neighborhood eats.

Before going in, we totally expected this to be a very American spaghetti spot that the kids would love and were hoping for a free pass on cooking dinner once a month.  Sufficed to say, this isn't that place.  Not that the little ones didn't enjoy the spaghetti and meatballs, but the food quality is nothing like what you'd get at the major US chains.  This place is authentic and delicious!

The adults ordered fish entrees; Salmon Pink Vodka Linguini and Cod Fra Diavolo.  I'll start by saying, the fish in both dishes was amazing!  The salmon was moist and firm and the vodka sauce was creamy and delicious.  The cod in my dish was perfectly cooked!  Light and flaky in a very rich spicy diavolo sauce.  Not as spicy as some I've had, but very garlicy and rich!

The portion sizes are huge, as would be expected at any real Italian establishment.  Our waitress brought the dishes out, and immediately brought to-go containers and set them on the side for us.  I'm no quitter, so I finished my plate and went into pasta coma later on the sofa, but the other 2 dishes were barely noticeably dented before packing up for leftovers tonight (yay...no cooking 2 nights in a row!). 

One of the most impressive things we notice and loved is that every order that is placed gets personally prepared in view of the customers.  We watched as the ladies behind the counter carefully prepared each dish and served them up.  No mass production here!

If there was any criticism at all, I have to say that the patio furniture type chairs were somewhat uncomfortable.  When eating pasta, I tend to almost stick my face in the dish to mitigate twirling pasta sauce projectiles from reaching my shirt, which is almost inevitable. We also considered hosting a kids b-day part here, but the tiny quaint space is pretty limited.  Very intimate for small groups and conversation.  Maybe more suited for a date night with a couple glasses of wine.

Overall a nice place and delicious food!  Definitely will be back to try some other dishes.",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,6,2,4,J5KZueLXMbc7e9A2sSWSPA

His special he cooked more like authentic Italian which was why he suggested it to me. Yeah, spot on. American Italian is terrible. Terrible. It's so hard to find an authentic Italian restaurant in the States so when you do, you should definitely order that all the time over the American, and if you prefer the American Italian style, you need to really work on your taste buds because authentic Italian food is awesome.

You step into Spaghetty Western and you see a deli counter with different meats cured as Italian's do and cheeses, wines and deserts, you seat yourself at a little cafe style table, the waitress comes over and welcomes you and takes your drink order, her accent is strong and you listen carefully to make sure you hear her right.

The food, service, and ambience were all on point. At first the menu looked a bit confusing but after letting the server know it was our first time he explained everything we needed to know. 

We started with the calamari which was delicious. Not so much breading and the flavor was a bit on the salted side and just enough that it kept me wanting more like a bag of chips. 

We ended up ordering Alfredo pasta with Fettuccini and chicken and the lobster ravioli. I'm not no pasta conossieur by any means but the best Alfredo I've had was the seafood Alfredo from Olive Garden; and the Alfredo at this place was not as creamy as I'd like, but still delicious.you have a choice in what type of protein you want, and with the chicken we chose, you can just tell the chicken was fresh off the grill. The lobster ravioli on the other hand, was delicious as well. It came with a creamy vodka tomato base sauce with pieces of shrimp scattered. The cheese in the ravioli was cooked perfectly where the inside wasn't cold nor was it too hot that it burned your mouth. 

Along with the pastas our waiter suggested to order the garlic bread and he claimed it was the best in the city. So we agreed and the actual name was ""fettunta"" -- and I was convinced. It was definitely one of these best garlic breads I've ever had. Not only was it warm and toasty, but it was brushed over with a garlic butter and had some shredded cheese on top. 

Over all, though it's only been 1 time, I'm giving this 5 stars. Definitely one of the best Italian spots I've eaten at and am curious to taste whatever else they have to offer.

I just moved here from the Bay Area, so I'm excited and anxious to try all of the great food around the area and I'm so glad that I found this great Italian place by the house.  I LOVE the play on the name of the place! The space is cute, quaint and well decorated. (People who are docking stars because of the small space need to get over themselves and never visit a place like NYC or Hong Kong... ridic!) *gets off high horse* Back to the two most important parts... 

The Service and the Food. 

They were both wonderful; each time I've come here, we've been pleasantly greeted, well taken care of.. and the food comes out so quickly!  My drink never reached the bottom before it was refilled.  So service-wise, SW, you get an A+!   The owner also happened to be in while we were having lunch today as well and asked us how the calamari appetizer was that we got. He was as nice and enthusiastic as his servers, which was refreshing to see. 

Now for the best part... the FOOD!  The food is amazing.  This time I had the Speck with pappardelle (my favorite kind of pasta)... the pasta was cooked perfectly, the Alfredo was just right and the portions are large.  

Overall, if you come here, you'll have a great experience in both service and food. If you're not from the area, it may be a little bit off the beaten path, but make the trek; it's worth it.  The prices aren't cheap (but if you wanted cheap, you'd be having fast food and not reading this review, right?), but the food quality justifies it. Lunch for two, with two sodas and Calamari will push you past $50 easily.",yUKqBcxTr5XF5uuISNF74A,2,0,5,jrLpSqeJPBY7-8S5X8uuKA

I continue to return back for the penne alla vodka, the bobbi, and the pasta with all the seafood (can never pronounce it)! I love the bruschetta and I have to order it!! The beard is always warm and fresh. The owner is always floating around asking how things are. And luckily I always miss the bust times on purpose, so I know I can sit down for lunch or dinner. 


If you had visited when the first remodeled and the service was rocky, PLEASE come back and give it a try. The food is delicious and I have gone about 8 times since then and they have their steady staff now.

Not only was there dressing already on the salad, there was SO much dressing on the Cesar salad that I couldn't even eat it.  It was absolutely drenched in the dressing!!

1768206,2017-07-04,0,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"I was extremely disappointed with my most recent visit to Spaghetti Western (under new ownership). 

My husband and I have dined with Spaghetti Western perhaps over a hundred times, and have never been disappointed like we were this past time we went. 

We were greeted at the front and promptly seated upon arriving. As usual, we ordered an appetizer (calamari), as well as our main course --both of us ordered pasta. 

My husband and I noticed something had changed from the moment we walked in the door; the music was different. We didn't really think much of it, until our food arrived. We noticed the gentleman next to us was speaking to who seemed to be the manager, complaining how his appetizer should have arrived before his main course. Perfectly understandable. 

Well, sure enough both, our pastas arrived promptly, with no calamari. We weren't sure if the server had forgotten about the appetizer. We inquired and his response to us was: ""Well, the pasta cooks faster the calamari"" implying that perhaps the calamari was on its way after the main course? We were both confused, because we clearly are aware that pasta cooks faster than the calamari does. It was clearly his mistake, he should have put in the calamari first, then waited to place the pasta order? 

Seen as though our server was oblivious to the fact that we were upset, we decided to speak to the manager (the same gentleman we had seen earlier talking to the customer next to us). Come to find out, his name is Robert. When I explained the problem, Robert didn't seem to really care. I then went ahead and asked if the owners were available, and he proceeds to start bashing them so unprofessionally. He goes on to tell me that they are no longer there, and that he was the new owner (once I asked him if he was the manager). 

He then starts spewing information about the previous owners, how they didn't pay their bills, that their books were upside down, and all this stuff, which a) is none of my business as a customer b) shows what type of people are running this place. Needless to say, EXTREMELY unprofessional!

The funny thing was that when he first approached our table, I asked him if he spoke Italian (I am Italian myself) and with disgust answers ""no!"" So rude! 
He then leaves, doesn't really apologize, and a few minutes later has the waiter drop off a to-go container at the table. 

My husband and I were a bit confused as to what the waiter had dropped off. We opened the bag, and there was a to-go tiramisu. We asked the waiter what it was, and he didn't even know himself! We put two and two together and figured out it was probably some sort of apology from Robert. Robert never even stopped by the table telling us he was sorry and that he was giving us the tiramisu? It was just weird! He did walk in front of our table quite a few times, but never even looked at us or nothing. 

We also noticed that the food was changed from the previous owners. The fresh pasta was raw and the calamari were slimy. It was pretty horrible. It is such a shame that the previous owners left. They were always friendly, had the best food, and it is truly unfortunate that someone like Robert feels the right to spread such mean and private information about such a humble and respectable people! Just for Robert's behavior we will never return!!",zK1cwHx4cEAy5vfXPh4E4g,1,0,1,tQ-DWbiqPCXqN-QNnhWFlQ

I ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce, also good, and very filling. Not as good as my all-time favorite Rao's, but I still enjoyed it.

My hubby ordered the cioppino, which you can get mild, medium or spicy, with linguini. It was really good! Very hearty - with crab, shrimp, clams, mussels, fish, and calamari.

The place is pretty small with only a few tables, not the best place for large parties, I would recommend doing take-outs. 

The first time I came was soon after they opened, we were greeted quickly and the staff explained the menu to us, explained the specials for the day and were very helpful. We ordered a charcuterie platter for $12... this platter was amazing! It came with 4 different meats, garlic bread, 3 different cheeses, olives and peppers, artichokes... a huge platter only for $12!! We ordered the specials for the day and was very happy with the whole experience. 

The second time they were busier, we waited a bit for service which was fine. We ordered the charcuterie platter again and it was not the same. We could tell that they were understaffed, they had lots of to-go orders and their tables were all full. The guy who took our ordered ended up making our charcuteries and it was not the same, fewer meats and cheeses, very little olives, peppers and artichoke...the presentation was also not the same. We got pastas and they tasted very good. A little disappointed because the charcuteries plate impressed us the first time and we came back mainly for the platter, but didn't get the same platter. 

Definitely a good place to eat though, pastas tasted fresh, delicious sauce, nice variety of selection, you can also buy cheeses and cured meats to take home. Good place to grab an Italian sandwich or pastas for lunch.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,0,4,IcPCwepqk9qmYmKMK77jrg

I first ordered the garlic bread with c, which wasn't really impressive but ok I suppose for the price.  Then, because my buddies were late, I ordered the antipasto misto, which did not disappoint - a large portion of Italian meats and cheeses were presented to me literally overflowing from the plate.

I promise I wasn't trying to keep it a secret, I've just been busy with school. For starters, as you can see by all of my checkins, I'm a regular and the current Duchess. I love all of the staff. The food is as good at it gets. This is a great local spot.

Alex, the waiter is an awesome guy and holds a special place in my heart! There's also a really nice Italian lady whose name I don't know but she's great too & her son is adorable. He's sometimes there at the restaurant coloring or doing school work. He's extremely well behaved. I don't remember the new owner's name either but he's friendly and personable and he's always smiling. The chef, Jason, is a prodigy. Anything he cooks, he cooks well. And he looks good doing it too. Haha! Once you get to know the staff, they'll remember your order, etc. It's the extra little touches that Spaghetty Western provides that mean a lot.

If you are missing something from a restaurant that discontinued your favorite dish, went out of business, or is no longer local, tell the staff here what was in it and presto you are eating the same version if not better. It's pretty incredible how well Jason hits the ball out of the park every single time I eat here. 

The two dishes I always order and recommend are: 

My #1 Go-To Dish which is Penne ala Vodka with Prosciutto, Sundried Tomato and Roasted Garlic. This is now an item on the menu under ""Anytime Specials"" since I ordered it so much and some of you Yelpers out there have been ordering it too because of my uploading photos here, according to the staff. Call it ""The Bobbi"" because it's easier... and they'll know I sent you. :)

I walked out.

Tonight my husband picked up 2 sandwiches and a pizza. Why does the menu say ""toasted sub"" and instead I get soft square bread? My husband also asked for no tomatoes on my sandwich and no onions on his sandwich. Guess what made it into the sandwiches--onions and tomatoes!

So he said we do have plain bread if you want. The bread was warm, the oil very boring. On to the food, spaghetty western my husband loved. My son liked the meatballs, but the actual spaghetti not so much. I tried it his tasted like they emptied a can of tomato sauce on the pasta. Mine on the other hand was great....however I learned after we received our check it was 41.95!!!

No matter the case one thing you will find is good food, great service, affordable prices, and  small business owner that cares about customers from minute walk in. Bonus if urge too take some fresh parmesan cut from block, deli cuts, or even fresh dessert serve by the piece too go Spaghetty Western has you covered all ways Italian.

The restaurant set up like standard deli restaurant. Not many tables but also bar stool area that can eat on. The menu have paper menu look at and also computerized version too look at hanging from at the wall. Sneaky but make sure check the specials of the day on chalkboard off too the side. They do great job of explaining the specials that day if you miss it. 

I ordered the Spaghetty Western since carb loading for 50miler bike ride next day. So thinking heavy pasta dish with protein and pasta. The Spaghetty Western is solid choice. The spaghetty (believe fresh tasted like too me) combine with the sausage, pancetta, and peas really nice light tomato sauce was awesome. Not heavy loaded with pure chunks of tomato or too think that not much of sauce. It had the right balance. The pancetta and sausage could eat by itself! Sure would order anything with either one of those meats on the menu. It came with order of garlic bread. It not often would rage about garlic bread comes with you entree. Garlic Bread showed me much they care about the little things even though comes with my entree. Two pieces had nice spread of butter, garlic, and chopped parley. Besides it came out HOT crispy garlic bread. The portion size was great not too mention very affordable. 

The only negative comment would say is that stack of dirty plates that sitting on table next too me the whole time. Not sure if lack of staff cause small business. Still nothing that would stop me from coming back for more pasta or trying more of the menu. The desserts all look great and definitely yelpers rave about. I make sure leave room next time.

I don't know where to start to be honest as there is so much to touch upon, but the bottom line is this place is legit and will a top contender in this area for years to come! The strip mall it's located in has quite the echelon when it comes to culinary gems and Spaghetty Western is no exception!

I'm quite sad that my Dad is moving out of the area, but being introduced to some top notch food was certainly a parting gift even I can deal with. It is family owned and he does frequent here enough that he has been able to build a rapor with the owner and family. That is a rarity and something that you can't teach nor replace when it comes to this type of stuff. I had an opportunity to meet them as well and first impression alone you can tell that they put their hearts into making this place run like a well oiled machine. 

From what I do remember of the visit is that from the instant popularity there were people everywhere and with it being such a small venue that turned people away who didn't stick out waiting for a table (their loss). They do take reservations which after hearing the above should be a no brainer to ensure that your experience is 5 stars and beyond like mine. My Dad mentioned that they are expanding into the vacant business next to them so right there tells me that they were aware of the issue and will put every inch to good use. 

The menu itself pretty much has something for everyone and any walk of life, but I set myself up for success going simple and selecting the spaghetti and meatballs. I partnered penne pasta for the occasion with the meatball and it was enough to slap me across the face and yell ""Ciao Bella"" from the rooftops as each bite digests. The pasta was soft and seemingly melted away as it was consumed. Between the marinara sauce and the meatball those alone blew me away. The marinara was thick in texture, but really coated the pasta well and came out swinging flavored masterfully. All I have left to say which makes me wish I had culinary turrets is MEATBALLS MEATBALLS MEATBALLS! These are off the chain here and honestly the best I have ever had to date. MUST TRY! It had a bit of spicing to it, but very moist circular slabs of delicious here! I apparently was a giggle magnet at the table as I even gave appearance to my once retired Kobayashi wiggle as I had my first bite. You know you've got an ace when your food does that to your body!

Another highlighted point which would be a disservice if not mentioned was the lobster ravioli. My wife has not stopped talking about this for a good 2 months now and for her to stop in her tracks is crazy. The amount of lobster does equal up to the price tag and I even got shocked by the amount in there as I'm used to maybe a piece here and there not the whole lobster famiglia! There were seven pieces total, but was filling no less. After sampling that one myself I put that on my last meal list when I die so I can go out feeling like royalty!

If you are ever in the neighborhood or need an escape from the strip life make the 10 minute drive here as you won't be sorry by any means. I hope they continue to grow within the area and I cross my fingers for them to branch out to California someday. I doubt that would be the case though, but as a testament to them I'd drive 4 hours in the event of meatball meat sweats. Ha-ha! Grazie di cuore! I can't wait to go back here pronto!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,1,0,5,5If2fcLEEKA-tElKEXQQyA

I had the penne with pink vodka sauce, sun dried tomatoes and prosciutto.  It was so tasty I didn't want to stop eating, but I wanted to have it again for lunch tomorrow. We decided on desert, too. The cannoli were fresh and the tiramisu was decadent. My boys each had the ice cream and devoured every bite and

1. You now enter a ""fine"" dining section through the ""take out"" door. 
2. Service is scant. 
3. Inordinate delay getting food.
4. Marinara sauce is too salty (based on two take outs & 1 in room experience).

Restaurant quality food to go is what gets me through to work in this busy city. And even though they forgot my garlic bread but made it on the spot in 5 minutes along with misquoted pricing in which the cashier apologized and honored the original price, these mistakes are easily accessible by their wonderful food and service. 

This city is very competitive & I strongly recommend this cozy little restaurant. They recently expanded with a nice restaurant/bar, from just being more of a fast food pickup restaurant. Wish they had delivery. Not a fan of bite or grubhub. Fees are too expensive, and I'd rather spend more involved the food and not all the fees. 

On to the food, penne Bobbi is to die for. Not too saucy but a wonderful pink vodka sauce with prosciutto, sundried tomatoes, and garlic. Which should be served with garlic bread but thankfully I ordered some. Also must order Alex's salad, spring mix, sundried tomatoes, red peppers, artichokes. salami, olives, asiago cheese, and balsamic glaze. Everything is fresh. Little pricey but well worth it, always in support of small business owners. Screw olive garden, it's offensive to real Italian food.",LNLMsRqQ3Rx9VzJ7LbaRkQ,2,4,4,ZSW71pSBgNSSORO0MgwqZw
2319099,2016-10-21,0,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"I hate to have to update this with a negative review but hey... Bottom line is there is no consistency. There have been issues since they restaurant expanded and reopened. I have been waiting and giving time for the ""growing pains"" to pass, but 3+ months is long enough. We come weekly for the most part, so we are regulars and used to love this place above all others.

1- Almost every time we come something is wrong with our order. Tonight my son's sandwich had sauce on it when I asked for it on the side. Then my fettuccine pesto was cheesy, as in cheese added in to the sauce. That wouldn't be a problem if that is what I  ordered or if that was even the standard for the pesto sauce. Usually when I get the pesto there is no cheese in the sauce. This is just the example of tonight. I have a laundry list I could share.

2- Staff changes a lot. I know how hard it is to hire and retain good people, but this is probably part of the food issue too.

3- That guy. His name is David, or Dave, is what I've been told. On one occasion he was pushy, and spoke to me like I was new here, and told me that I really needed reservations from now on if I come on a Friday. Another time I was here at lunch time and he was walking around loudly reprimanding the kitchen staff. Another time he was literally standing next to my husband waving his arm around my husbands head, yelling ""hey"", attempting to get a waiters attention to take care of something. The other owners just take care of things themselves, like clearing tables if needed. He also hits on the clientele. I have a friend that used to sit at the bar and won't even come alone any more because of him. Also, I read another negative Yelp review and his response was absolutely so unprofessional, and argumentative, I was enraged for the other person. I don't know him personally, and this isn't a personal attack. This is legitimate accounts of what I've personally seen. 

They have some wonderful staff that have been here for years, and we love to see them when we come. It is really like hanging out with family when they are here. The owners, not David, are amazing. I am always so happy when I see they are here and love to watch them interacting with everyone. However, I always let them know when there is an issue and it's still on going. So maybe reviews for all to see will inspire them to make some changes.",1GbtKqRpDAfv13fUYIBBmA,5,0,3,uzSNswd0xy5SE9uLCvITUw

When we walked in, I instantly noticed how small and limited their seating was. But it was only half full when we came in. It wasn't super clear if it was seat yourself type of place or what. But the server said sit anywhere so we did. 

To comment the server wasn't the friendliest but he wasn't rude it was just not a lot of personality to work with there. We didn't ask for any recommendations because we weren't getting like oh please talk to me vibe. 

The food did however come out fast.

We got the meatballs for appetizers, boyfriend got lasagna for main dish and I got this penne pasta with sausage and peppers with a red sauce.

The meatballs were ok not a lot of flavor to them. The lasagna had a flavor that we were not familiar with so we thought it was off. My boyfriend always compares lasagna with the one from guisseppes so he says its the best and the one at this place was no comparison.
As for my pasta it was just ok. The penne was cooked perfectly. But it lacked flavor. I only ate a little bit and took the rest home since I hate to waste food.

We said we were sharing so they were nice to split both of our entrees for us. Everything was delicious, just like Italian home cooking. We didn't finish everything because Italian food can be heavy and the portions are big.

As we were leaving, the place was full and some people came in to pick up their orders. We came at the right time, a little before 6 p.m.

The atmosphere is casual but well-done: cozy and warm; NOT loud; with just the right scale of bar to booths to tables.  The separation between restaurant and take-out/deli area is great - people waiting for those services aren't standing around in the restaurant area taking up space.  I love that it is NOT a sport's bar with gaming machines stuck in the bar top and huge TV's on every wall.  It does NOT have a blaring sound system - you can actually talk to the person across the table from you - how refreshing!  They haven't packed the space with tables, so you aren't sitting on top of the people next to you.  The service staff is friendly and professional and seem invested in their workplace.  This is not a place for large groups - no banquet room/separate room.  This isn't a ""kiddie"" place - it's a grown-up establishment that can accommodate children who eat more than ""chicken nuggets"".

The food is great:  warm, crusty bread with seasoned olive oil for a dip; David's Milan Salad is extraordinary; the pizza dough is made fresh daily and the pizza's are HOT out of the oven & are gourmet style (not meat heavy); the lasagna and ravioli were so good!  The chopped salad looked awesome and the antipasto plate was delicious!  The desserts are made in-house and are fresh and light: tiramisu, crème puffs, cheesecake, cannoli, tiny fruit crème pies.

Our waitress was Carrie and I can't say enough good things about the service she provided. Watching her handle the flow of people through the front door, the phone for delivery/pickup orders, and the other couple aside from us in the restaurant was impressive. She didn't skip a beat. She even refilled our drinks when she saw that we were low, while on the phone taking a delivery order. She was also very nice and warm and stopped by our table just to ask how everything was, crack a few jokes, etc. She bagged up our food when we were done and couldn't finish, didn't just hand us boxes and a check. That was super nice of her considering the amount of work she had going on. Once again, the service she provided was amazing.

The food was definitely on par with the service. I had the oven baked penne with meat sauce and my fiancé had the penne alla vodka with prosciutto, sundried tomatoes, and garlic. Both dishes were excellent. The meat sauce on mine wasn't too watery or oily, was just perfect. The dish my fiancé had was downright awesome. Can't go wrong with any of those ingredients, and they were executed very well. Pasta was cooked al dente, which is how I like it!

Space is limited to maybe 10 tables so if you plan to go during peak dining times, getting a table will prove difficult. We arrived at 4pm and all but 2 tables filled. 

DO NOT go here for fast service or for friendly staff (unless you know people that work there). I was rudely ignored when I entered the restaurant by a man who later introduced himself to others as Pasquale. He saw people he knew who arrived after me and greeted/hugged them, sat them, got them waters and 2 appetizers before we had even received an ice water. The server we had cared little that we were there which aligns with other Yelp reviews of this restaurant. The woman who brought out our entrees was however the most friendly and personable employee at that establishment. It's too bad she wasn't our server.

2662681,2014-03-23,1,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"I was confused about this restaurant's logo and décor alongside the Italian menu until I read that Spaghetti Western is a bonafide genre of Western films produced and directed by Italians.  This place serves food from Italian immigrants who fell in love with movies like ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" by Sergio Leone.  I'm still not sure where the western flavor is factored in... maybe in the soda and chip choices, or the fact that their Tortellini is shipped from New York... but one thing is for sure.  Even if their menu is quite Italian (with an Italian speaking grandmother in the back of the kitchen)... any American would love this kind of food.

Their servings are large and their $12 antipasto platter can make 3 or 4 people extremely happy.  It comes with peppers, olives, sundried tomatoes, artichokes (sooo good) and you get to choose 2 kinds of cheeses and 3 types of cold cuts.  We went for fontina, gorgonzola, salame, coppa and pancetta and all were uhmazing.  Real good stuff, and they even brought out complimentary Prosciutto di Parma which was melt in your mouth good.  The plate comes with 2 garlic bread slices so you might want to order more if you are a group sharing.  Their garlic bread was standard but had a few lovely chili flakes to give it a little kick.  We then had 1 of their 3 soups of the day, the spinach and tortellini soup.  Honestly I was expecting a cream based broth, but it was a nice surprise to get something healthy and tasty, plus the bowl was as large as my head!  Hubby had the Carbonara which was good, but if you are a stickler for al dente you might want to request that.  

We were unfortunately too full to try dessert and will definitely have to go back for the bindi cakes and tiramisu, as well as the awesome lookin porkchops and vegetable lasagnas.

Spaghetty Western is our new favorite place. 
I was looking on Yelp for a new restaurant to try, because we're staying in an unfamiliar part of town near SouthPoint.  

I was curious about the name because there's a restaurant called Spaghetti Western in Houston, Texas that I've always wanted to try and haven't, yet.  I'm reading the reviews and they're all good, except one.  The best part of his review was the owner's reply. It was, bar none, the best reply. Ever. I had to try this restaurant because the owner took a stand for his staff. He earned my respect, before I stepped into his restaurant.

When we arrived (it's a Monday night, btw) it's bustling. We're a little surprised because it's in a shopping center, but inside it's a small intimate restaurant with a dessert case full of delicious looking treats, a bar and several tables.  We are greeted and seated almost right away.  We're near the bar at first and later moved to a booth. 

Our waiter, the waitstaff and the manager provided excellent customer service. I am a stickler for customer service and Las Vegas is one of the most friendly places I've ever visited. 

We got the toasted ravioli appetizer. Garlicky buttery ohmygoodness served with marinara. 
I ordered the Eggplant Involtini.  My favorite Italian dish that is almost never on a menu except at Spaghetty Western. The capellini served al dente. Wow. They were channeling my grandfather. 
It was so good. It tasted homemade and definitely made with care and by someone who loves food and how it tastes.  My girlfriend got penne (al dente , also) with pink vodka sauce and grilled chicken. The flavor was divine. 
I had a glass of Chianti with my meal and the flavors of the sauce complimented my wine.

Update !!! 5/28/2017
Its been quite a long time since I've visited SW.
We met some friends for Saturday night dinner .
Alex was very happy to see us and sat us down right away , Joe was our server and attended to us well .
The atmosphere was relaxing , not too loud, but busyness under control . Our salads were fresh looking and excellent . I ordered my fav veal parm , my wife ordered the mushroom and octopus salad , my companion ordered the barb , his wife chicken
Marsala.
The  food came in a timely manner and as usual my VParm was spot on , fork tender , cheesy, and the marinara sauce was a stand out i have missed having .

My buddy's ""Barb""was excellent in presentation and taste . 
I love the freshly grated parm just before you take that first bite . Nice touch !
The only complaint, the chicken Marsala ,came with the wrong pasta that Joe  remedied. 
The desserts were good but the Red Velvet was fantastic !
This place is worth the trip ! 

Update , 
Im a fan of SW ! I often dream about their meatball sandwiches.
been going there since they opened , seen a lot of people come and Go , new ownership , an expansion .
When i see bad reviews complaining how that new ownership is somehow responsible for a bad dining experience while specifically pining for the good old days under the previous owners
The reviews are their first ones ever written , NOT EVEN a old review ,showcasing the Epic meals and service from days gone by, seem made up and possibly coached , just to cast dispersions against the present day owner .

In my opinion ,the new ownership, has taken an unprofessional, loud arguing , lack of pride in product ,
Restaurant and turned SW into the gem we enjoy today .

No one can get 5 stars at all times , but a one star from someone who loved the previous owners , without ever writing a single review expressing that love and how good ""their "" food was before it all changed, is suspect and does not add up . 
Take the Pepsi challenge and you will find SW ready to serve you great food from authentic recipes , at a reasonable price .",uE5qdTzb2uEB28sL5Hlwtg,1,0,5,jjIDL8qkGnAugskYws-HFQ

Possibly to sound more ""Americanized"", like they did when changing the spelling of the last names when immigrants arrived through Ellis Island. The menu pays homage to the old films with sandwiches named after them, like ""Hang 'Em High"" and the ""Magnificent Seven"". 

Greeted at the door by Andrea, he immediatley started telling me all about the meats and cheeses in the deli case. A thick Italian accent, and a very enthusiastic sales pitch, we started talking about where he is from in Northern Italy, he went on to tell me all about his products in the store. The place is small, but they have a pretty extensive menu. 

 One of my favorite things in life is a charcuterie and a cheese board, complete with a glass of wine. I now have this in my neighborhood. Pretty large selection of imported Italian cheese as well as imported cold cuts like: speck, prosciutto crudo, soppressata, mortadella and your usual salami and pastrami. The cheese is what really peaked my interest, the gorgonzola was off the charts delicious. A strong bite, this is not your usual gorgonzola that we are used to. Fontina and Asiago rounded up my tasting. 

They have an assortment of pastas, some made in house, some imported from Italy (they are frozen) as well as house favorites like eggplant parm and steak milanese. Also available are some housemade desserts (try the Tiramisu, it was fantastic) as well as imported Bindi Cakes. They do have beer and wine available as well. They offer seasonal specials, like rice arancini, which I will definitely come back to try. Andrea said they do cater, and they also offer cheese/cold cut trays.

PARKING

Ample parking here for this spot. A BUNCH!Located in the heart of Southern Highlands strip mall which has an abundance of other stores if you can't find parking then, it must be holiday time or Black Friday.....seems to ALWAYS be parking here.

THE EXPERIENCE 

I walked in with my squad and we were immediately greeted by the owner. He made us feel welcomed and comfortable and sat us right away. The Chef and another employee were talking back in fourth ( in Italian ) while we were glancing at the menu....the owner comes over and tells us what they're discussing. Apparently the Chef got bored and made a pizza and calzone ( two items that are not on the menu but he wanted to see what it would cook like ), never made these items before and the owner suggested that he have us, my party be the first to try the deliciousness.
We did not turn this offering down. We split the personal pizza and calzone and after a bite of each knew we had made the right decision in coming to Spaghetty Western.
When deciding on appetizers we inquired about a few items that were not on the menu but certainly common dishes made in Italian spots. The bruschetta was one of the first requested items. When our waiter said they don't normally make that, but then said he may have some items in the back to accommodate us we were surely grateful.

[ I mean, it felt similar to an experience at an Italian friends home where their Mom is planted in the kitchen making meal after meal and as a guest you're forced to sit at the table and indulge on every last bit ]

My squad had never dined here before and we were just not used to the quality customer service that went above and beyond anything we'd ever experienced. Quality to a 'T' !!!

I had seen via Yelp of a certain dish that had Coke highly recommended when dining here, The Bobbi. Let me tell you it DID NOT disappoint. My beer was never empty and the complimentary bread basket always stayed full ( just like my belly ). An experience so good I did not want to leave Vegas.

The only thing left to discuss was the name of the location. We couldn't for the life of us figure out why such an authentic Italian restaurant had such ( what I thought to be ) a weak name. The owner then explained that the name was inherited by the previous owner and actually was the general name for many of the Westerns that were shot in the early 1940's and 50's. Majority of the locations for these films were in Italy. Actors like John Wayne & Clint Eastwood were filmed in these historic towns in southern Italy. Hence the name Spaghetty Western.

OVERALL

The experience increased in quality as the meal progressed. The staff, extremely personable and helpful in every way. Looking forward to the renovations that will be happening over the next couple months, an expansion of the restaurant including a bar and patio area will be full equipped by mid-April.
Don't fret though, all you locals will still be able to enjoy the food, they'll be open during this enhancement period.

The dinning experience was one I never wish to experience again. Loud and not intimate at all. When I say intimate I mean I could not hear myself or my dinning mate talk. Server paid more attention to his friends than us. As if we were irrelevant. If I pay 20 or more per person I want to be served and paid attention to. At least act like you care about your customers. Even if we aren't your friends. Never going back.,mTfshiFkT5Y_D9VMihIj9Q,0,0,2,Arm-ikh86TLyoXJDBMrY-Q

We decided to go for a quick bite around the corner to Spaghetty Western.   We were greeted by smell of deliciousness right when we walked in and by very nice and friendly gentleman named Robert.   We told him it's our first time eating here he found a table for us immediately which was a pleasant surprise because the rest of the tables and bar were full.   

The first thing we noticed was really good prices on bottle of wine.  The menu was large and had lots of classics and specials.   Debbie our server was engaging and knowledgeable.   The house bread and oil, herb with garlic dipping con concoction was devilishly good I wanted to drink it from the gravy bowl but didn't want to get thrown out for being an animal so i ordered more bread to make sure I got every drop.  

We orders a great house salad loaded with antipasto tidbits.  Since I'm no longer drinking my wife had a nice glass of wine instead of the bottle but we I'll be back with friends to take advance of bottle pricing.  

My wife can never order her past how she likes it.  She was giddy with the ability to create her own!  I mean she usually gets shunned and embarrassed ordering a mix penne, bolognese, veggies (Bootlegger was the worst at shaming her) Debbie loved the order and it came out exactly how she wanted.  Wow!!  Win for our family.   I had went with Debbie (well I should have done the daily special Osobuco it LOOKED incredible) instead I did a white sauce with a pasta I've never seen so good, Italian sausage (light and airy), asparagus and other veggies.  I mopped this up like I hadn't eaten before I normally wouldn't have ordered this so glad I did.  

We had to try desert the home made tiramisu and gelato where perfectly yummy.

3078332,2016-07-22,5,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"After being longtime customers, sadly I don't think we will be coming back. After their expansion the prices have gone up considerably (over 20%, I know bc I checked the two take out menus I still had at home) and it has lost the charm that it had as a small family restaurant. Sure, the inside looks fantastic and it has a bar now. But part of the appeal before was that you felt like you were getting excellent food at a great price in an intimate setting. The food was just so so. A few parts of our order (substitute penne for angel hair, white sauce instead of red) were wrong. 
Aside from that I suppose there are some new investors now because I keep seeing an older gentleman there who makes his presence known and greeted a few tables. He was wearing flip flops - unless I'm at a beach shack, I think this is highly inappropriate. And he's very obnoxious - asked us how our food was literally seconds after it was sat in front of us and nobody had even taken a bite yet. We watched him block the main walking area when paying customers were trying to get through. We also heard him complaining about a staff member being late - keep that kind of comment away from the customers.",lxkl0HVUuefl1Xcwf96UGQ,6,1,1,UzTOMH61yZR2tVgftGP3SQ

I ordered a small house salad and chicken soup, and oh boy, their portions... my mouth dropped (see my photos). The salad was packed with fresh tomatoes, sun dried bell peppers, sun dried tomatoes, olives, red onions, artichoke, fresh mozzarella and pepperocini on spring mix lettuce and spinach. The standard salad dressing is Italian. Their chicken soup was also large in portion served with mini pasta shells, mall pieces of chicken, carrots and celery. I really liked that the soup was not too salty. I hate when restaraunts get salt happy and often times chicken soups come out very salty. If you think it's too bland, you have the option of adding more salt and pepper. Each dish comes with a half toasted garlic bread. As the main dish (I didn't know I was going to have so much food), I had the lunch size Vodka pink pasta with penne. The penne was cooked perfectly. Not too overcooked or undercooked, al dente just the way I like it. The sauce was thick and creamy and flavor was good. Lastly, I ordered a butternut squash ravioli in 4 cheese with panchetta and mushrooms as recommended by one of the employees. It also did not disappoint. The price is very reasonable especially considering their portions. I'd definitely come back to this place again.",hsJLv8er94o9S_6Z9w-nHw,1,1,4,4dDP7AU7vr10FiCAWEnu4g

Loved the music they had playing. It was three of us so we decided to start off with the Caesar salad (which is enough to share). One of the best Caesar salads I've had in awhile. For an Appetizer we had the Calamari... Another hit!!! I liked that it came with three lightly breaded shrimps as well.... Thanks! Me and my mom shared the chicken piccata. Ok....so I must say I'm extremely hard to please with chicken piccata. Mostly because most places have zero clue on how to make it. I can honestly say this is one of the best chicken piccata's I've ever had. My aunt had the shrimp scampi with linguine in red sauce. She loved it as well. I'll definitely be back soon.

I ordered my go-to, a meatball sandwich, the other night with extra sauce on the side. I noticed that the total was more than usual and when I looked at the check I saw they charged $2 for an extra side of sauce that they didn't even bother to put in the bag. When I returned to request the sauce that I had paid for, the gave me a very very small container. When I made a comment about the size the lady lied and said they also added extra sauce to the actual sandwich, which they did not. I understand policies change but at the very least the person taking my order could have let me know about the price increase. Its only $2 but that's not the point. It's just disappointing when perfectly good restaurants stop caring about customer satisfaction and begins worrying more about the bottom line. If they are so worried about making a few extra bucks on some sauce, it makes me concerned that perhaps they are also cutting corners with the quality of ingredients in their kitchen.",Ein10EOYzLLhYiGM4FMgtw,0,0,1,u8WEP47jIQX87oTDTvk2zQ

3172802,2014-07-22,2,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"First, to address the negative comments about the female server: people have bad days and some can't handle stress as well as others. At times she seemed distracted, but she has little help with a full dining room. To add to this: most regulars seemed to expect her to drop everything and help them. Be patient, people...and lighten up! She knew all of the regulars and knew what they ordered in the past. That's not easy to keep track of! She was awesome with our 3 year old, knew the menu and was able to make awesome suggestions for us. BONUS.
The food was amazing. We had the antipasto plate...the meats were incredible and I'm a prosciutto SNOB! We also ordered entrees (5 of us total)...there were NO complaints. There was enough food for each of us to take home and enjoy again for lunch the next day. 
If you are a gnocchi fan, I highly recommend it! I had it with pink vodka sauce and it was de-lish. 
The thing I really didn't like about this place was the marks the chair left on my legs. The seating is not comfy - it is more for deli-seating...in and out. If you want to relax and have a drink with dinner, you may want to take the food to go. If they had different chairs, non-wicker type, 5 stars for sure.

This showed up on Yelp for delivery services. Took a peek at some pictures and decided to order the Chicken Parmesan with pasta and the Linguini Fisherman. The gentleman who took my order had decent customer service and the food was delivered to my house within 30 mins. 

After tasting both dishes, I honestly thought what I ordered was just ok. Didn't hit the spot but it helped the empty stomach I had and probably would of kept me full for the rest of the day. 

A couple of hours later my stomach started cramping severely and out came the vomit and well.. everything else that comes with the territory. 

This was the first time in my life where I've EVER had this happen to me. My GF came helping me after her finding me in fetal position on my bathroom floor. I didn't know wether if I should of went to the hospital or if I should just ride it out. I decided to ride it out and save myself from unwanted expensive hospital bills. I pretty much was stuck in my bathroom the remaining night. I would NEVER write a bad review unless it was necessary. This is a SERIOUS incident that left me crying and in A LOT of pain.

I wanted to see if anyone had the same incident to help me decide wether I should say anything about the food. So I started going through the reviews and saw that there were a few who have WITNESSED many health code violations in person. There was one review stating where the cook touched raw chicken and continued to touch pots and pans. Another incident where they saw the cook running his fingers through his hair numerous times and then touched bread with his bare hands. One where a cook stuck his fingers in his mouth to grab food from his teeth and Whattada know.. One review where the SAME dish was ordered and left a woman in the emergency room for FOOD POISONING! Is this the same cook or are all of them unsanitary?!!

The fact that these people have seen these things in person doesn't surprise me that whoever prepared my meal would be completely careless and unsanitary to food that are being delivered to homes (people) away from eyes witnessing it first hand. 

I WILL NEVER SUGGEST NOR COME BACK TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN. And I truly feel sad that this is located in a nice area like Southern Highlands. Major disappointment.Please be careful if you eat here. You never know what else goes on in the kitchen and if you could be the next person to go through this.",VJkOegC9kOv4cnX52cduYg,15,1,1,uu7L_G1LvC6MLWPuJaKqtQ

I tried to ask or server and manager multiple times if they could turn the heat up, to which they replied, it takes a while.  The place didn't get one degree warmer the entire time my family ate there.  I couldn't even tell you how the food was that day.  We had a female bartender acting as our server and she couldn't seem to get anything to our table in a reasonable amount of time.  All around horrible experience.

Manicotti
Italian sandwich

We got the bread and it tasted like burned plastic. Just like the smell coming from the kitchen.....huh?

We ordered two salads and four entrées...and wait and wait. The restaurant was at 35 percent capacity...not busy. They brought out our entrées and I said can you please tell us where our salads are...waiter said what do you mean? I said we have not received them. He said....so you want me to cancel them now? I said yes please...

We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs (excellent), penne Bobbi (excellent) and lobster shrimp ravioli (ok but they used canned shrimp). These 3 items are only reason I'm giving 2 stars.

We told the waiter about the bread tasting burnt who said ""we have a know-it-all-chef so I will tell him but it won't do any good."" Whaaaaaattt? I asked him to please tell chef and try the dough so they don't serve it to anyone else. He came back and said the chef is using a different broiler oven because our pizza oven is broke and we didn't see any plastic in it. I asked if he tried the bread...he said no. Wtf?!

Chicken marsala was comparable with a cafe in a good locals casino, albeit served fresh and piping hot from the kitchen which the cafes often struggle to do. Tasty but priced higher than I would've expected. The pizza, however, was very disappointing. The texture of the crust was excellent, crisp and bubbly, but it lacked taste.

Warm colors and wood paneling evoke a modern saloon feel -- you'd halfway expect a space cowboy to walk in, but then you remember you're nestled in a shopping plaza in the heart of Southern Highlands.

More often than not, my bf and I venture out to new places with the practicality of a Groupon. This was one of those days. I bought a $20 lunch voucher for about half the price, then just paid the difference. We visited at the tail-end of lunchtime, so the place was practically empty. 

Our server was great. He started us off with drinks and appetizers. We decided on a plate of their FETTUNTA, a 5-piece garlic bread with olive oil and a side of marinara. Reminded me of Texas toast, but with herbs. I got the PASTA PESTO made with FETTUCINE. I had the choice of plain or creamy, so I went with creamy -- good choice. My bf kept it simple and got the SPAGHETTY MEATBALLS, with 3 large house made meatballs included. 

Their pasta selection can be overwhelming. There's a section of CLASSIC, which offers your choice of pasta: spaghetti, penne, linguine, fettucine, capelli; for $2 more: gnocchi, pappardelle, cavatelli; for $3 more: cheese tortellini, mushroom or lobster or butternut squash ravioli. Then they have more items under PASTA SPECIALS as well as under PASTA DI MADRE. So safe to say, there's no shortage of pasta here. Price ranges from $12.95 - $24.95. Hellooo carbs!

Overall, we had an enjoyable lunch. I had read some of the reviews on here and was a little hesitant to try because of the unprofessional responses that could have been dealt with better, but we didn't encounter anything like that.

What can I say about the food - absolutely the best Italian I have had in Vegas. The sauces were superb. The tiramisu was sublime. 

If I could offer one bit of constructive criticism (and I'm only doing this out of respect for their obvious expertise in the area) I think they could perhaps look at the ""wine situation"" as an area of possible improvement. Instead of only selling wine by the glass or bottle I would highly recommend that they adopt the method utilized by Batista's hole in the wall- that being that they offer a decent of house wine and utilize the small traditional "" tumbler"" style  wine glasses found in authentic Italian restaurants. Having the option to get a decanter of house wine would be a major addition to an already wonderful and authentic Italian experience.  

I am not one to give high Yelp reviews. In fact, I have been accused of being very harsh . But, I have to give a A-  to A rating ( only the wine situation preventing it from being a solid A!)

This is now our ""go to Italian restaurant ""in Vegas.

They said 10 min, but it was more like 20+ min. So I guess come here only if you have a reservation. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the food is decent. It's not the best I've had, but better than Pizza Hut to go. 

Edited to add: I dropped my review to 1 star. The portions are not your normal big sized pasta portions. My husband ordered the ravioli and my 20 month old was able to finish it all, and she's tiny (20 lbs) with a small appetite.  Don't plan on sharing your meal, even with a small child.

So Pasquale, I believe an owner, made him a dish of 3 smaller appetizers, it was perfect! I also couldn't decide, so he made me a pasta with peas and it was to die for. This place goes above and beyond to make sure you have the best experience, and they are always so accommodating. Being from back east myself, this feels like ""home"" for me.

Ordered the prosciutto and mozarella starter, garlic bread (it's a few dollars extra compared to their regular complimentary break) because you have to have that while you eat pasta, and a pasta entree. 

The bartender was awesome and super nice. The reason I say pasta entree is because I told him that I wanted him to chose what sauce and which pasta middles we got based on what he liked. It was BOMB.

We ordered a meatball sandwich (3 meatballs, marinara, meltedparmigiano and mozzarella) $10.95 and a chicken parm sandwich (fried chicken cutlet covered withmarinara, melted parmigiano and mozzarella) $11.95.  They were nice enough to cut the sandwiches in half and put 1/2 of each on each plate so we could share.  The homemade meatballs and chicken cutlets were both tasty, but really large for a sandwich, so we cut everything in half so we could pick them up to eat.  The bread was fresh and soft, the sauce was acidic, not sweet (just the way I like it), & the cheese was toasty and bubbly.  I was glad they brought a bowl of sauce because it was so good on the sandwiches, plus we could add it to the chicken and meatballs that didn't fit on the bread.

It's rare to come across a restaurant that's not a chain off the strip, that just gets everything right... Spaghetti Western accomplishes that. We have passed by this place multiple times, but weren't sure about it. We've ate at all the other spots in this shopping center, but always skipped by this place for one reason or another. I saw a Groupon and decided that now would be as good of a time as any, low risk, high reward. Today I took my family here for lunch and we will definitely be back. We ordered the bruschetta to start, which was pretty well done. It tasted more like a vinaigrette on top of tomatoes than olive oil and herbs...but it was still delicious. We ordered the chicken Milanese for our son, my wife order the linguini scampi, and I went with a basic...spaghetti and meatballs. I always hear from all of the great chefs that when you go to a new place it's nice to sample the menu, but always start with something basic... if they get the basics right it's truly a good restaurant.. I've never dined at a place where that was more true. The sauce and meatballs were probably the most perfect I've had, and I come from an Italian family. My wife's scampi was perfect, and my son's chicken was very well seasoned and the potatoes were perfectly done. To quote my wife "" it's like they have a team of great grandmother's from Italy in the back working non stop"". After the meal my wife ordered the tiramisu and my son had the chocolate puffed pastry. They were both extremely happy and satisfied. 

The service was really good, only negative was the pace of meal. My son's food came out with the appetizer and we were done eating for a while before the server came to offer desert and coffee. Our drinks were never empty and we never needed for anything, so the rest is just knit picking.

We ordered for delivery the flash fried calamari, side caeear salad, charred octopus, caprese salad, lasagne, and tiramisu. The charred octopus had 4 tiny portions, and the calamari was a super small portion.  They stated ""we don't suggest ordering fried items for delivery"".  I said I never said we are unhappy with the calamari quality, only that there is such a small amount of octopus and calamari.  Side note, the charred octopus was flavorless. 

The caprese salad does not list green olives or kalamata olives, they stated that they have tried to fix the menu on bite squad without success.  I stated the menu matched the restaurant menu on the restaurant website.  Also, the tomatoes are beefsteak tomatoes that are inedible because they are not fully ripened.  I had to use tomatoes from home in my caprese.  The caprese had overabundance of black pepper that cause me to sneeze horribly. 

The side caesar looked like it could have been out of a bag.  Some of the lettuce was brown and there was very little dressing, and few croutons.

We were seated right away; the dining room is small and a bit cramped.  This is sort of a ""hole in the wall"" Italian place, but sometimes those can have the best food.   The theme is perfect for their name with a combination of Italian and Western décor (check out the horses in the bathroom - you'll see what I mean).  The dining room seemed fairly full.

We ordered drinks, and then we waited at least 10 minutes before anything showed up.  These were simple soft drinks and coffee that didn't require any preparation.  When the server returned he had forgotten one of the drinks.  There was no apology when we reminded him.  We ordered a starter, a salad, and three entrees.  Fifteen minutes later or so the three entrees arrived.  We informed the food runner (someone different than the server) that we hadn't received the starter or salad yet.  His response ""Ok, I can go get those.""  Again, no apology.  The table was then loaded with plates for everything we had ordered.  Not exactly the leisurely meal we had expected.  Then we noticed we hadn't been given a bread basket.  Again we asked.  Response:  ""Oh yeah, I can get bread."" Again, no apology.  After the meal we asked about the dessert menu.  The server said they don't have a menu, but he said he would be right back to list off the choices.  Maybe 10 minutes later he returned.  

As for the food...  We ordered the charcuterie sampler board as a starter.  A large portion of assorted sliced meats and cheeses.  These were very tasty and seemed of solid quality.  We had a house salad as well which was different and involved some greens as well as tomatoes, olives, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke.  Different, but not bad.  Then we had the Eggplant Parmesan, Spaghetty Western, and Spaghetti and Meatballs.  These all were quite good.  The Western in particular was a unique dish with sautéed deli meats and green peas.  It all worked well together with a zesty sauce.  The Eggplant was good with large pieces of eggplant with just the right amount of cheese and sauce.  The meatballs in the spaghetti and meatballs were very good and definitely tasted homemade with a wonderful seasoning.  For desserts we went for tiramisu, cheesecake, and key lime cheesecake.  Again, all very good.  The tiramisu was the star here with moist cake soaked with a coffee flavor and just enough sweetness. 

The overall verdict was very good food and very poor service.  But, I think I would be willing to try it again since service can fluctuate a bit from visit to visit at a lot of places.",OIa6ptM1qUts5arovQUAFQ,9,4,3,FHzv1YGMM6EdO2UOaeGMMQ

The first time we were there, I tried their gnocchi in pesto/Gorgonzola sauce and the mister had their chili lasagna.  He LOVED his lasagna so much that he ordered the same thing the second time we went.  The gnocchi was good but I felt the sauces needed a little more flavor (maybe more garlic or salt or cheese?).  Second time, I ordered the Fisherman's Cioppino Pasta...it was SO good!! For $18.95 I would definitely order this dish again but I really want to try a lot of their other pasta options.  Portions are pretty big so the gnocchi I had was taken home and reheated the next day and it was even better the next day as the gnocchi softened up a bit.

The  bad part about the sandwich  was the bread was very bready and very dried out so I ended up just leaving most of the bread on the plate.  Not sure how the cook could have not noticed that it was so dry and getting hard. hmmm. I could have mentioned the dried out bread (the main part of a sandwich) but I usually don't  make a stink in local places that are not chains.

Shortly after entering the restaurant and standing in line behind an elderly couple, another couple walked in behind me. Both couples were taken to be seated while I was overlooked. After realizing the mistake, there weren't any readily available clean tables, so the wait continued. 
After being seated, the wait continued for 21 minutes until we were approached by Peggy. She offered to comp our beverages for the long wait. We ordered both our drinks and meals at the same time. Another 10 minutes later, exactly 31 minutes since arriving at the table, there were still no drinks in front of us or the waters that we requested. The person I was dining with proceeded to the bar to request the waters from the bartender while also telling her our wine order. He brought the waters back to the table and the bartender brought the wine, while Peggy, still too busy to visit our table.
Another gentleman brought out our meals and Peggy checked on us at the same time to see if we wanted cheese on top of our dishes. At this point, I realized that the pasta in my meal was incorrect- I requested linguine and received spaghetti. After already regretting the time spent at the restaurant, I brought this to Peggy's attention. After asking several times if I was okay with the spaghetti, the dish was finally sent back to the kitchen. Peggy returned moments later stating that the kitchen was out of linguine. 
Ultimately, I was given spaghetti with the impression that I wouldn't notice the difference. Additionally, I had to request for bread to be brought to the table. The entire experience was extremely unacceptable. 
My expectations never pertained to receiving a comped meal. It was the principle- the fact that I was given a meal that I didn't order, without any consideration to my preferences. While this alone should have deemed the meal worthy of being comped; it wasn't. Based on my overall experience this evening, I will not be returning, and it is my best recommendation that other patrons stay clear. 
To say that the entire experience was bad because of our server Peggy, would not be fair- The entire staff essentially is to blame. Where one fails, another surely should be able to pick up the slack. My dining experience did not start on a positive note, which should have left an opportunity to recover. Unfortunately however, it only continued to spiral downwards. 
I particularly find fault in Peggy attempting to force me to enjoy a dining experience that had nothing positive going for it. I don't believe her attempt at recovery was the appropriate way to rectify the situation. It only elevated my dissatisfaction towards the experience. I've refrained from interjecting my personal feelings during this review. However, if I were to include how I currently feel, humiliated is the first word that comes to mind.",sqCfGEBU9fCtI4GRc5v0LA,18,0,1,v4Eg8W7BNor4PcA-oruayw

I just wanted to take a minute and compliment you on your wonderful business. It seems these days we go out of our way to complain, but never take the time to acknowledge hard work and excellent quality. 

We've never dined in your establishment, but we hope to one day. We have ordered delivery through Postmates a couple of times though. And I can only imagine how excellent your food is in person. We have now tried eight dishes altogether and we have yet to taste anything that isn't superb. (Even as leftovers several days in a row) 

For our last delivery, we ended up eating rather late and placed our order towards the end of your business hours. Some lovely person included an extra dish (I assume to avoid having to throw it away at the end of the night). The extra dish of tortellini with sausage in a spicy sauce has quickly become a favorite.

Because it's nowhere near the strip (it was about a $20 Lyft ride from the Hard Rock Hotel), we would have never found this place. My only regret is that I was extremely hungover so I wasn't able to fully enjoy the meal, but once I got some bruschetta in me, I was able to eat enough to make it well worth the trip.

Pros: 
-It's a cute, locally owned joint with a fun theme. The western film posters are fun, and it still manages to feel middle upscale.
-The owner was active in the restaurant, helping out his single waitress during the midday shift on a Thursday when it was surprisingly pretty busy. 
-The women's restroom has complementary feminine products and a sugar scrub for your hands. It's a nice touch
-Of course, the food was AMAZING. I would definitely recommend this place to locals.

Cons:
-The only con was I ordered chicken on my salad, but when it arrived, it was chickenless. I asked for the strips after it came but didn't receive them until almost the end of our meal.

I looked and looked on Yelp for what seemed like hours.  Everything ""good"" was focused in the touristy areas.  And everything affordable was housed in buildings owned by chains.  But finally after messing with the maps and settings and filters on my iPhone app.  I finally found a place.

Spaghetty Western is a deli style Italian Restaurant.  It's got the deli counter and some four tops inside.  Imagine a small strip mall space.  It's not a fancy fine dining experience, but at no time did we have service that was anything less than high quality.

The waiter was carrying on an inappropriately sexually gratuitous conversation with these women and putting his hands all over them. This is unacceptable behavior for a family restaurant. More shocking is that a man of his age should know better. To his credit the manager attempted to intervene but this made matter worse as the women seemed to be enjoying the attention and began running through the restaurant ending up in the kitchen.

Al dente! Pasta should never be mushy. Neither my husband or my daughter ate their desserts. My husband said the strawberry cheesecake was just nasty and my daughter took one bite of her cannoli. Service was super slow. And it took more than 15 minutes to get the change. Even as bad as it was, I always tip my server. It isn't an easy job. However the server should thank my husband he had small bills and left her a tip because I was completely annoyed. Our bill was $70.12 and I gave her $100. She asked if I wanted change! Really? She wasn't good. I drank my daughter's water because they didn't refill mine. I had planned to give her $15, but when she brought back the change, she gave me a $10 and a $20.

5349073,2014-04-05,2,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for lunch since it was close to where he lived. Also, I've been meaning to try this place out but because it was still really new when I heard about this place, there wasn't a whole lot of information. I didn't know what exactly they had on their menu. Well, today, I found out! 

They had a bunch of different things on the menu ranging from meats, cheeses, sandwiches, and pastas. I LOVE pasta so we don't have to guess which category I looked at!

I ended up going with a Penne Arribbiata while the boyfriend went with their Spaghetty Western. When we went to order it, this gentlemen, with a very THICK accent, took down our order and asked us what we liked it about it. He warned me that my pasta was spicy but I LOVE spicy so of course I wouldn't have a problem! I think after that, I just nodded at what he said cause I couldn't really make it out. He said something about olives and I just said, ""I'm fine with that."" I'm not sure if the olives were an add on or it came with it ... but if you were to order something, pay extra close attention to what he's saying! He's really nice though!

When I ate my pasta ... oy boy! It was spicy!! It wasn't alarmingly spicy but if you can't handle spicy foods, I wouldn't suggest it. It was very good. It had enough kick in it for me but the spiciness didn't burn. The penne that I chose with it was al dente, which is exactly how I like my pasta :) The serving sizes are pretty big too. I actually didn't finish my pasta so at least I have left overs for lunch the next day! Also, a piece of garlic bread comes with the pasta! 

The ONLY thing I didn't really like was it took a while to get the food. We had ordered it to go so we were just waiting and waiting. 

But I would definitely come back to this place !!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,5,5,4,qjmElCBFbXE0w1_EqgDW4Q

It was at best on par with Olive Garden which in my opinion is a fast food quality Italian restaurant. While the angel hair pasta and marinara in our Chicken Parmesana meal was pretty good, the chicken was nothing more than a baked pre-made frozen breaded chicken breast.

That theme continued with the cheese pizza which again was simply a pre-made crust that essentially tasted like a Celeste frozen pizza. Even the garlic bread was just a bland tasting piece of buttered roll with some parsley sprinkled on it. 

The only thing that brings my review up a star was the fact that our food was ready within 20 minutes even though it was 6pm on a Saturday. The person taking my phone order and at the counter was both prompt and friendly. Based on the price for the quality of food received, we will not return.",Afbd0ey5f9dOE37pejMckQ,3,1,2,T2zav6p5duTM50k9sGpuQw
5353523,2014-06-09,0,4VkLiFoIEjTTpbCRgxjnCQ,"I hope this does not sound condescending, but I am giving this restaurant a 1 star because I care and want them to succeed. I see potential in this place, but only if this hard-working family can straighten some issues that need immediate attention:

Service: This was the deal breaker for us. We do not know the name of the lady serving us, and that is because she was not wearing a name tag. In fact, she was not wearing much of a professional attire to serve her customers...yoga pants, a very lose fitting blouse/gym top and dirty gym shoes definitely left a lot to be desired. Here is a list of no-no's we experienced in our visit:
  * No greeting when we first came in
  * We sat ourselves and 5-10 minutes went by before she acknowledged us...and there were only 3 tables sat at the time
  * This lady was flustered and all over the place. She even complained to us about a table (that had a half-finished bottle of wine to go) of 6 people wouldn't leave. 
 * Her demeanor was curt and, sometimes rude. We spent 40+ minutes waiting for two dishes and we did not checked up on. Our drinks ran dry, no bread was brought to our table, no apology was given! About 50 minutes after ordering she comes to our table to, again, complain about how the kitchen was handling the to-go and eat-in tickets like that was, somehow, our problem. Towards the end of our meal she promised we would get our drinks for free because of the wait, but then she charged us for them!
 * To top it all of, just as we were done eating, she tells us from behind the counter ""Hey, your total comes to $40.70 and I have your ticket pulled up here at the register. No hurry""... HOW RUDE!!! We felt compelled to abruptly end our meal and go to the register to pay. She then has the nerve to ask us how much tip we are leaving her because her register does allow to put the tip after the ticket was printed. Really?!? If this is the case... then get a new register!

Kitchen Staff: Very disorganized! Some things we saw:
  * A tall guy in the kitchen with shoulder-length hair kept running his fingers through his hair without washing his hands
  * One of the line cooks handled tip money without washing his hands afterwards
  * The server would clean tables and then dish the garlic bread with her bare hands 

Food: Average at best. My linguini with white wine clam sauce was bland and 'boring' and my girlfriend's pasta with vodka sauce was just ok. Seasoning and flavor profile could be a lot better.

If an owner is reading this, please:
 * Deploy your staff and give them specific responsibilities, so they don't run around like chickens with their heads cut off. 
 * Get a friendlier server for the front
 * Observe hand-washing guidelines per the health department
 * Ensure you have enough staff to meet the customer demand
 * Ensure you have a system in place to serve the dine-in customers first, then take care of the delivery/carryout orders.
 * Fix your charcuterie display. You have a $5000 refrigerated display with some old-looking food and chunks of meat thrown in there. You can do better.

Anyways... if you had the patience to read through all this and you are a possible customer, I hope you have a better experience. And, if you work here, please make it better!",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,9,0,1,vK7aMuvM36rof3xDEwxkxQ

Although I prefer the hot sandwiches. The meatballs are made with the perfect smooth mildness to contrast with the cut of the sauce and the creaminess of the cheese.

Our server came by with a basket of delicious (but super soft) bread and got drink and appetizer orders. When she came back, she got our food orders. I order spaghetti & meatballs and he ordered a meatball sub (his came with a salad or soup). 

So our mozzarella sticks arrived and they were AMAZING. Oh my gosh, like super delicious. Apparently they make them fresh there, not frozen ones. But then our food came and they brought his sandwich before his salad, which was weird. My pasta was good, but I guess the meatballs were a little lackluster. They could have used some more seasoning and maybe cooking a little longer. They weren't raw or pink inside, but they also just didn't seem well cooked, if that makes sense. 

The place itself is pretty cute. A mixture of tables and booths...we sat in a corner booth with a view of the whole place. There were movie posters on the wall and a bar area in the main seating area. In the little area where you walk in, it's more like a pick up counter (and has their dessert case). 

Our servers were good. The main one was very friendly, and her assistant brought stuff out pretty quickly. He was also good on filling up our drinks again.

Overall, mostly good experience. I don't think I'd order the meatballs again, but that's just because I like mine a bit more well done.",vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ,0,1,3,fVuG33FMOg__PfCQtjtlNw

I walked into the newly renovated Spaghetti Western to be passed by employees for 5-minutes before being acknowledged. They sat me on the new side. Several minutes later a bus boy asked if I had been helped. A tall lanky waiter came to serve me. Eventually placed my order for my chicken Parmesan. The waiter asked if I wanted a soup or salad. I asked what kind of soups, like minestrone. He said no, we have lentil but no minestroney, like a 5 year old. I thought that I was at an Italian restaurant?! I asked what do they put on the salad, he said tomatoes, black olives, cheese, stuff like that. Stuff like that?! Wtf. 

The food itself was great. The service sucked. I got my check and realized that the soup or salad that the waiter offered was a full salad that wasn't included in the meal?! Omg, why offer it and not tell the customer it's an additional fee?! 

Dinner for one person came out to $40?! There was no alcohol. One desert. And a lot of horrible service. I begrudgingly tipped hoping that the bus boy would receive it.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,4,1,1,d2ndYSHWZ8V8t0WJ0jq6Ww

The wine selection is above & beyond anything in the area. The Duckhorn wine flight is one of our favorites. The salads are great, very fresh and the dressings are flavorful. I highly recommend the pastas (especially the bolognese)...but we really come here for the garlic bread. We usually order 2 of them because it's devoured so quickly. It's simply AMAZING!!!

Meatball Sandwich
================
Presentation - 5.0 stars.  It measured 8-9 inches.  Uncut, and beautiful.

Pick-up Ability - 1.0 stars.  It was mush in my hands.  Too much sauce.  This doesn't happen at Capriotti's!

Meatballs (3.0 stars) - Heavy, not bready enough to be light.

Sauce (2.0 stars) - a sharp taste, like vinegar.

Cheese (5.0 stars) - wonderful quality of both parm and mozzarella. 

Bread (5.0 stars) - amazing.  Toasty and fresh.

Talkative, but a very nice man.  Lasagne looks great, and huge slices at that.  It might be worth giving them another try, even though the sauce was questionable...it could've been a bad batch.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,9,7,3,8ny2xOjRT0AXcLKkHYm7pA

We waited 30 minutes for the brushetta to come out. While we were waiting we saw people's food orders that were sat AFTER us coming out. NOT GOOD. They literally fed tables of 3 or less people first, before starting on our order. NOT GOOD. After waiting an hour and a half our food started trickling in. First the lasagna and two carbonaras. 10 minutes later the pesto pasta. I ordered a chicken marsala and it never came. IT NEVER CAME. Our waiter apologized and said he'll get that started immediately. The owner came and apologized and she explained to me that they recently expanded and she had to fire 7 workers.
