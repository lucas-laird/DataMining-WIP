I had the wonton noodle, husband had eggplant in pork sauce, portions were big enough to take another meal's worth home for $10.",MZJjx9y05nnUCtBVeTAmEg,2,0,4,ZJwHAhcPFvMN2juOnG4Sww

- the veggie dumplings were great. Getting them pan fried means they come out with an awesome golden, perfectly crispy, unbroken crust. 

- the pork loin clay pot is actually more like a bim bim bop than the usually saucy stew common at Chinese restaurants. The pot comes out hot, with the rice crisping underneath the fried pork strips, carrot, cucumber, and black fungus. Loved the flavor of this one! I think the rice is cooked with meat stock and garlic flakes. 

- the seaweed cold dish is massive - an entire dinner plate! 

- the food comes with a millet porridge, which my parents loved. When my mother expressed how much she likes it and asked how it was made, the waitress launched into a long explanation  that they only use a certain kind of millet imported from China (after trying every other millet they could find), where to buy it, how much it cost, what the bag looks like, and how to cook it. Then she gave us a container to take home. 

Easily my new favorite Chinese place in Vegas!",2HGcieV3PL-rTQA3zjyghA,4,0,5,oNX0uB-g6_KRwvb-H6rCMg
1230208,2017-10-12,1,31mm5EtlmT4557BTYAFOrA,"I have to admit I had my reservations entering the restaurant in the morning (before its posted opening hours on Yelp no less). It was quiet and the ambiance of the restaurant - a weird mix of a renovated cashier booth mixed with old-school Chinese take-out tables and cheap chairs - did give me pause. But goshdarnit, the breakfast food here is a bargain and this is THE place to be if you want authentic, traditional Chinese breakfast. Fried dough sticks, congee, noodles, soy milk, etc. all await you if you stop here for breakfast. $6.00 got me soy milk with fried dough sticks, a side of pickled shredded radish and a soy sauce-marinated hard boiled egg. For under $10, you can get a real hot breakfast that is the ultimate morning comfort food. I was so hungry I ate everything before realizing I forgot to take pictures. Not sure about lunch or dinner but this is definitely going to stay on my list of preferred Asian breakfast joints.",oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA,4,3,4,drRDl0vXQweyuY1Fv50nrQ
1646613,2017-12-11,0,31mm5EtlmT4557BTYAFOrA,"I can't recommend this place enough. Try the fried pork buns!

This is authentic Chinese food, so for western people the ambience and much of the menu may seem unusual. Anyone who can get past that is in for a treat! Everything on their menu is delicious, whether noodles, rice, appetizers or dumplings. Especially the dumplings. And the steamed/fried buns!",S9z0rtOLUcSdgGlfw9RFhg,0,0,5,UtBNqGh7fNu2rcfzkz_Lbg
2040917,2017-07-05,4,31mm5EtlmT4557BTYAFOrA,"Had a late night dumpling craving and was glad they're open til 10pm (on the 7/4 holiday)! Called in, and although they can take an order in English it's much easier in Chinese.  I ordered the dishes below and would def come back for other quick and simple comfort food. The lady chef even offered me free congee to go since they were closing and had extra in the kitchen :) Menu is in English and Chinese, there are also pictures on the wall of some dishes. Inside of the restaurant is simple and clean, I'd be comfortable eating inside anytime. 

-White cabbage (napa cabbage) and pork boiled dumplings $10 - there's also a fried/potsticker option. Small 2-bite dumplings that taste just like my China days :) good amount of pork with cabbage, and the skin was thick homestyle as well. Came with black vinegar and soy sauce to dip in. 
- Beef Noodle Soup $6 which came with a surprisingly large portion of meat! (See pic) the to-go order was nicely separated for me so that noodles wouldn't get soggy. A small styrofoam box was filled with half noodles and half blanched lettuce while another round container had all the beef broth + meat + hard boiled tea egg. Very satisfying mainland China-style beef noodle soup :)",K8byELF3mfZxbVA_FPVo9w,13,3,4,sAyB3EPx096zRIbSHHMmHA

I called back and she asked if I was coming there, I said no and she hung up. Every time I called I was hung up on. They do not want to do deliveries and will hang up on you.

This is the only place open at 8am in China Town,  may be that is why not many people know the early hours. The place kind of empty in the morning.The noodle and dumpling are very tasty and generous portion. Definitely will come back again.",1FTLSS3G0S2G2D9g10wDow,2,0,5,VJ4U8SKy8FxywnnTkCqMBA

Items we ordered, the breakfast combo with beef noodle soup and the combo with steamed buns. They were fantastic!! Highly recommend this place if you want something simple and as close to home cooked (Northern Chinese) as you can get in Vegas.",1jepyMndAD16WaVJcc63hA,0,1,5,M9fevCSZ_iPYKwsieNgZ6w

5918649,2018-02-05,2,31mm5EtlmT4557BTYAFOrA,"My friend randomly text me a picture of the noodles he ordered the other day, which turned out to be from China Gourmet.  It is just a few doors down from QQ Tea Plus (which I am sadden to learn has shuttered its door recently), and is across the street from the Old SF Market and Milk Teaze. The noodles looked pretty good.  But since moving to the SW, I no longer drive down Spring Mountain Rd as frequently as I once did.

Fast forward a week or two, we decided to grab a late lunch at China Gourmet.  It was around 3pm when I arrived after stopping by the ATM, and the place was completely empty.  Not the best feeling or first impression, but I went in any way and was greeted by a Chinese waitress asking if I wanted ice water or tea while I waited for my friend to arrive.

We initially were planning to order one of their noodles, but after looking over their menus and talking to the waitress, we ended up ordering their Beef Roll (large enough to share or have as a meal, instead of an appetizer) and also an order of their Seafood Dumpling (it has shrimp and pork, in case you are wondering).

The orders came out fairly quickly, and was surprisingly good. I would definitely be back to try more of their ""Breakfast"" menu, which I think is actually served all day, and to try more from their Dumpling menu.

The food is not high end or gourmet, the presentation right out of the kitchen is fairly pedestrian and trying to glam it up for social media will definitely require some skills, but if you are down for wholesome Chinese food at a reasonable price, this China Gourmet is your place.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,13,4,4,XBJJaCbOKAXHsL6Jn5-iQw

As appetizer I'd recommend Steamed Eggplant with Garlic and Chili Sauce + Spicey Shredded Potato
