The general manager, Freshta Soltero is concerned that each person's dining experience is a very positive one.   She has managed to greatly improve the chef's attention to the quality of the food as well as the wait staff's attentiveness to the guests.  Our waiter Arturo, and the shift manager Camila were as pleasant and helpful as they could have been.  Both were very personable and attentive. I hope we see them on our next visit!
If you go there you must try the Maine Lobster Roll which is one of the best I've ever had.  The freshness of the lobster and the perfectly toasted bun were fantastic. Perfectly spiced and a large serving with fries.  I tried the Old Fashioned Cherry Bombe milkshake and it was great.  So many cherry pieces and spiked with bourbon!  My husband enjoyed the freshness of the hummus on the Mezzo Board Small Plate.  He also had a Dirty Burger that was HUGE with pieces of pork belly on it.  It was very good. Both entrees were perfectly cooked.  Our favorite was the Small Plate of Zin Braised Meatballs.  This was absolutely fantastic!  We did not have desserts simply because we were full.  
There are many interesting small plates and entrees to be tried on a return trip.  The menu is innovative and has interesting twists on comfort food items such as meatloaf and potato soup.  Continued success, Freshta!",n6J-Qa7gQfdDz5-earG73g,0,0,4,uYNv4x_CaX2aMe6Q0RT7wA
226757,2017-10-13,1,y7TV2trR4B9sbgXtyrqv8Q,"Very disappointed!  I was really hoping to like this newly remodeled cafe.  I had a food comp so I figured I'd give this new place a try.  Only ordered 2 appetizers -Chicken Wings and the Mezze Board (hummus platter).  It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive and when it did the chicken wings were cold.  They tasted ok, not true Buffalo style - very saucy (sweet BBQ?).

The Mezze platter was fine but had only about a half dozen pita wedges.  I asked for more pita and was told no problem.  Took another 15-20 minutes to get the extra 6-8 pita wedges.  Waitress did not tell me it was an add'l $2!

Overall the place is bright and clean and the food was acceptable.  However, I think the $27 for 2 appetizers and 2 soft drinks is a bit expensive.  Fortunately I had that $15 comp!",Wwa7RshRpvf5Ob2zeS6fng,2,1,2,TMIKtIwUB7CvRrJNKw7rzA

1003645,2017-09-16,0,y7TV2trR4B9sbgXtyrqv8Q,"Horrible! I went here at 9am on Wednesday morning. There were maybe 5 tables already seated. When the hostess asked how many in my party she was interrupted by a man asking to speak with the manager. That should have been a red flag but I ignored it because the person I was with really wanted to eat here. I watched as the man waited patiently standing against the wall waiting for a manager for approx. 10 mins. While I watched him wait we were not approached by a server or spoken to by anyone there. After about 10 mins of waiting they sat a couple down behind us. Then another party in another section. I watched the manager greet and dismiss the man against the wall. I waited while food runners walked by our table several times without acknowledgement that we were there. Finally a server came out and went to the party that was seated behind us 10 mins after we got there. When I saw that I flagged down the manager. I informed him that the server just took the drink order of the couple who had just sat down while we waited for 15 mins. Instead of listening he shrugged and said sorry can I take your drink order. I said no these people were just seated and server already helped them and he made some excuse about it getting busy all at once and I told him that didn't happen and he gave another excuse of the hostess not knowing how to seat properly. We walked out and he gave a half hearted apology with a smirk,  I am kicking myself for not getting his name now but the experience we had made us not want to step foot in the palms again because of the restaurant managers lack of caring and we gamble A LOT at the palms casino and we have a president players card.

Food was great, big portions. However, I was really disappointed at the margherita pizza. It was literally a cheese pizza with like... 3 pieces of basil. Like yo where are the tomato slices? The chunks of mozzarella?? when i asked another server about this, she said the tomatoes were in the sauce (but the pizza is basically a thin crust pizza so ???? where ??¿¿?? pretty sure my fingernail was thicker than that) and mozzarella was shredded in there. was severely disappointed by that. 

Actual restaurant was clean and brightly lit, but there were a couple times where the lights flickered as if the power was about to shut off.

Service. Like I said, Charlie was great. But there was one thing that bothered me: none of the other servers were attentive. I observed other tables around us and literally none of the servers would respond when a table needed something. Even though our server was great, she spent at least 15-20 minutes at one table. The other servers popped around here and there but dude. I get that its not busy but at least show that you're paying attention to your customers. Even if they're not seated at your tables, don't brush someone off if they need something (this happened to five tables, including ours. we counted.)",5uuE8Gm7m4YfMI6vfTUHQA,2,1,3,gyrXR2_4PgULiC3K8jZVuw

They have bar top lamps with phone plug ins. Outlets are nice but can do without the light. Service was good. 

We ordered the Eggsadilla & breakfast pizza. Eggsadilla is a quesadilla with egg, cheese & poblano peppers. I got it with egg whites that were very fluffy & plentiful The bottom of the quesadilla was soggy plus there was not have a lot of peppers in it but it was still pretty tasty. The pizza was fabulous. Sausage,sage,mornay sauce, egg & potatoes. Delicious.

1368031,2017-12-28,0,y7TV2trR4B9sbgXtyrqv8Q,"I'm on a movie time crunch and in dire need of a super quick and wholesome meal. It's a good thing this restaurant is near the movie theater and is open 24 hours. I have previously tried a couple desserts from their display case and I really like the Chocolate Chip Cookie, it's seriously addictive. Now this is my first time dining in and trying to decide what to get on the menu. Thankfully our server is quite attentive and well-versed with recommendation. 

I chose the Kung Pao Spaghetti ($13) which are noodles cooked al dente, stir fry in hoisin sauce, then sautéed with chicken, dried chile, red and green bell peppers, and garnish with peanuts and scallions. I like my meal, it's delicious and fulfilling! The noodles are not dry and it's not oily. It's just the right amount of sauce and it has good flavor. I also got the Matcha Green Tea Latte ($6) with Almond Milk ($0.50). I like it when Matcha is served hot and it's not sweet. It's nice to complement any meal with Hot Matcha, because it really does add soothing and nutritional benefits.

The second order is not yet on the menu, but it will be soon. It's the General Tso Fried Rice ($13) which is stir fry rice mix with eggs, diced carrots, green peas, bacon strips, and General Tso sauce, then topped with a sunny side up egg and scallions. If you love bacon, then you'll definitely enjoy this order. The General Tso Fried Rice is substantially packed with bacon flavor. Overall, the meal is satisfying, service is prompt, and we're lucky we made it just in time for the movie.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,2,1,5,9dYBs3A3Yem0BXwMVJbt_w

1781269,2018-04-23,6,y7TV2trR4B9sbgXtyrqv8Q,"Station Casinos recently acquired the Pams and immediately started the upgrades, smartly starting with the dining options. I've only been in once but that was enough to be able to tell that Lucky Penny is a significant upgrade from the previous 24 hour cafe. 

Location is a bit hard to find with limited signage around the property- from the sports book entrance, it's all the way in the back to the right, around an awkward corner. Hopefully the lack of signage will be addressed because there was hardly anyone here when I came by, likely due to simply not knowing it was there.

In any case, the menu has a lot to choose from without being overwhelming. I sat at the bar and chose the waffle grilled cheese, served with tomato bisque. Order was out in a reasonable amount of time and the dish was delicious. I wanted to add on a salad but the server who helped me said the portion was large and very filling- she was right. The sandwich was large and the cheese was gooey, the soup served warm for dipping with just the right balance of sweetness. I would get this again, but I'll probably come back for the Benedict and the Cinnamon Roll pancakes.

The place is gorgeous and just casual enough to be able to wear your streets or your club garb.  Along with the gorgeous atmosphere you had a gorgeous bartender and hostesses and then you get to the menu.  It was a lot bigger than I would have expected and yet almost everything looked amazing, even the simpler dishes.  

My buddy and I finally decided on three dishes (two for me lol).  I got the macho machaca hash which was very very good but could've been bigger, although I was quite hungry (a la the two meals).  It was both sweet and spicy but not overpowering on either.  It's the type of breakfast I would make at home if I were more talented.  I also ordered the cinnamon swirl pancakes with cream cheese icing.  These came out huge and very filling.  The problem was, they did not taste like they had that much cinnamon on them.  This next part is weird though.  It looked like it had a lot of icing on them but it was only on the top (of three) pancakes so it definitely needed more icing but then again, the icing was a bit too sweet or thick and could've used less but then they would've been dry, very odd.  My friend got the steak and eggs and that looked fantastic and to his delight, they were.  I don't think it was overpriced, especially for the amount we got.

No spice at all. I have never added salt or pepper to Asian food but I did to this. The second time was with a friend and she got the fried Oreos. I got the loaded potato soup. The Oreos were good and came with a soft serve iced cream to dip the Oreos in. But, the soup was merely a thin layer with a pile of French fries and battered fried onions for volume.

The fried Oreos were strongly recommended by our awesome server at the bar, and they did not disappoint! It was my first time having fried Oreos! Paired with ice cream, there was a nice balance of savory from the fried batter, and the sweetness of the Oreo that melted like butter in my mouth with a bit of ice cream on top.

The monkey bread too was delicious. I love how the monkey bread itself wasn't too sweet, and added more of (what tasted like) melted dark chocolate on top that was served on the side, it fulfilled the chocolate craving without making the dessert too sweet.

There are more items I would like to try here, especially, the alcoholic shakes. Bookmarking and keeping this place in mind on my next visit.",mXjPVbjZ1vVvIBtt1ON2YQ,0,1,4,i9Ctu6UJX8DNXOaDBXrIFA

We had the omelette and corned-beef hash. I'd have to say it was the best omelet I've ever had at a restaurant. It was so fluffy and all the ingredients were fresh; so fresh that the jalapeños had my mouth on fire! So good. The potato cakes that came with the omelet were seasoned to perfection (no need to add condiments) and the hash was made from scratch too (not that out of can stuff). The meat was succulent and it came with perfectly over easy eggs. Customer service is top notch as well. We definitely will be going back to try more things on the menu. It's a great place for both large and small groups with hearty appetites at any time of the day. Highly recommend giving,LvFOdh8LnRhlqKcHIT6Rog,0,0,4,8kaeOuaUbXwi-m2OG9eO8Q

2710545,2017-11-25,40,y7TV2trR4B9sbgXtyrqv8Q,"We were staying at Palm's Place and hungry for a midnight snack so we took the skytube from 2nd floor over to Palm's Casino where Lucky Penny is located. We were told that Lucky Penny is a diner that operates 24/7 so I had pretty low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by the high end twist that they have on diner style food options. 

I absolutely loved their stunning decor and brightly lit artistic ambiance. We sat at a cute curved booth so it was perfect for holding hands underneath the table :) and also for sharing food. Our waitress Charlie was very friendly and attentive. She was knowledgeable of the menu, super helpful and overall just absolutely amazingggggg. 

2 Vodka & Monster ($??) - We actually wanted Vodka and Redbull, but they did not have any redbull so we settled fro vodka and monster. It was not as tasty but it was the nice energizing boost we needed at midnight. 

Loaded Potato Soup ($7) - This is not your typical loaded potato soup. It has a potato soup base with a hefty amount of crispy crinkle cut fries topped with sour cream, crispy bacon, cheddar, pablano chiles and crispy fried onions. It was absolutely delicious and the portion was generous. It was also fun to eat as we dipped our fries into the creamy soup base. We agreed that this was the winning dish of the night!! ;) 

Classic In-House Corned Beef Hash ($12) - A crisp corned beef, potatoes, tomato sauce and poached egg. All I ate from this was the 2 poached eggs. For the record, the eggs were overcooked and the inside was not as soft as I would like from a poached egg. The hash had to much fat content I found myself picking out all of the meat and picking at the potatoes slightly. 

Chicken Fingers ($10) - Buttermilk marinated crispy chicken with ranch dipping sauce. This came out a bit late because the kitchen had a hiccup and our lovely waitress was professional enough to send it back and fix it for us. The presentation was very cute but I wasn't a fan of the chicken fingers. It was a bit too flavorless and tough. I have just had way way better chicken fingers and this doesn't even hit average. 

Whether you are craving breakfast, lunch or dinner, Lucky Penny is a solid spot for you to grab a bite. It is especially convenient for guests who are staying at Palm's Casino or Palm's Place and I really appreciate that they are open 24/7.

My sister and I ordered a bottle of champagne and orange juice and it took over 30 minutes just to get those drinks.

I ordered the waffle grilled cheese sandwich with a side of tomato soup and my sister got the breakfast pizza. I have no complaints about any of the food and the grilled cheese waffle sandwich was one of the best things I've had in Vegas! It's a shame that the service is so bad because the restaurant itself is so cute and the food was amazing. 

First I thought it might just be our waiter that was lacking in customer service but, when I took a look around almost every table around us was making negative comments about the service and how long everything was taking to come out. My advice would be to clean up the customer service because in a city like Las Vegas there are many places to dine.

The first time, the service was very slow, and the portion size of my meal was not adequate. 

The second time, which was today, I had the Denver Cheddar Omelet.  It had ham, onions, and peppers in addition to the cheese.  There wasn't nearly enough cheese, and shockingly the ham, onions, and peppers in the omelet could most likely barely fill a thimble.  The first three bites I took felt more like I was eating scrambled eggs, because I can barely tell anything else was mixed in.  

The potatoes on the side were mushy potato cakes, and get a flat out F-.

I do like that this restaurant has a selection of iced coffee/lattes, and gave it another star just for that.  

Sad to see that the former location of one of the best coffee shops in Vegas was revamped to something that isn't even approaching half as good.",gyTYQo6Cn4BYB4z-McRDaA,3,1,2,iCSxvXs-xFDefO-ZhuwQ4Q

I'm local and live close by so tried this place half dozen times  before and after the name change. Used to be called the ' 24 Hour Cafe' but nothing has been changed besides the bright flickering lights. 

It is still one of the worst restaurants ever. The soup is the same and just terrible. Portions are small and expensive. The service is so bad on average, takes a long time to get food ordered. If you have any requests for substitutions you'll have a hard time. 

While you're waiting to just get a drink you watch several employees taking. I've even waited several minutes just to be seated watching employees talk. 

Stations did good job fixing the buffet for the better but this restaurant needs so much work. You can't keep the same terrible employees and terrible menu and trick locals. Can't believe they can change names and remove all the reviews they had before. Because they literally scam people and steal money doing this I thought I'd post my first review. 

I can almost guarantee that this review will go ignored because I've spoke with several managers in past years, each was only their temporary to fix the place, and even though were nice they couldn't do anything but say sorry. You need a permanent manager that will fire half the uncaring staff and create an actually new menu not just raise the prices and add a few weird new items. 

I'll update if I ever get a chance.

But, what I was most excited about was the coffee! The first time I met friends at the Lucky Penny I ordered a nitro cold brew that was soooo flavorful and the PERFECT strength (none of that diluted bitter stuff that you come across so often). It was exactly what I needed to give me that extra push to get through my day. The second time I dined at Lucky Penny, I got a matcha latte and I'm still dreaming about. It's SO hard to get a good matcha in Vegas and this place seriously delivers (not to mention it was beautifully presented).

First time it was late. I was craving something hearty. I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and broccoli. My guy ordered the steak and frites. The meatloaf was thick, juicy and definitely hearty. The gravy and crispy fried onions were so good. The mashed potatoes were perfectly smooth and the broccoli I really didn't eat much of but were good. I really just wanted the meat loaf and mash. I tasted the garlic herb frites with tarragon aioli .....mouth watering delicious! Ha! 

Second time here was breakfast. We ordered food to share which was perfect because I like to eat everything. We ordered the breakfast pizza which was yummy. Only thing was I wished the egg was cooked a little more. I enjoyed getting sausage with every bite. French toast with added bananas and strawberries was thick and soft. Very easy to cut with a fork and the perfect sweet to eat for breakfast. Lastly the macho machaca hash....braised beef short rib, sunny side up egg,potatoes, onions, chipotle crema and pick de gallo! OMG this was probably my favorite thing. The braised beef was soooooo tender and delicious! Needless to say this dish did not last long. I had mimosas to drink which was not like your average.

Usually if they make customer wait,they will say some word and customer-will wait.

So I just left this restaurant because this is not right.
And when we leave after here I told host that I'm gonna leave because nobody show up to us and ask drink neither.

Can you guess what she said??

Ok

To me excuse me!?

I just decided not gonna going back this place anymore and I will complain to the manager now",_nBKZEYAmHFAj9l7ORF_Fg,0,0,1,v7kK3dIM6zonZeEwl6KoTA
3971586,2017-12-20,2,y7TV2trR4B9sbgXtyrqv8Q,"After spending a night at the Palms, I tried Lucky Penny for breakfast.  The renovated buffet was not yet open so this was the only option unless I wanted some fast food from the food court.

I took the option to sit at the bar.  I ordered coffee--the rooms in the Ivory Tower do not have coffee makers--and I was ready for my caffeine fix.  I also ordered a bottle of house made juice called the Flame Out! with fresh turmeric, carrot, ginger, orange, lemon, and celery.  The juice was very refreshing and with flavors one doesn't experience often.

After a refill of coffee, the Penny Bennies arrived on a very hot plate.  The dish didn't look that great, but it tasted quite good.  This Benedict had poached eggs, ham, garlic toast, and hollandaise.  The garlic toast was pressed thin and there were thin slices of ham on the toast and then topped with the poached eggs.  The Hollandaise was just OK.  The breakfast also comes with two rounds of ""crushed potatoes.""  These are home fries that have been crushed into the round circles.

Service at the bar was quick and friendly.  I have to try Lucky Penny for an evening meal sometime.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,6,3,Tz0pSmPj28PffuUYsEA7Mw

It was also where my friend once ordered an eggs benedict sans hollandaise (thanks to Anthony Bourdain), so this place will always live in my heart for the savagery and incredulity that was bestowed upon this friend at 5am by waitstaff and other pals alike. Anyway, this time was just a quick hit takeout. Had a veggie burger, which was fine, serviceable, but the fries were better. The highlight was the waitstaff giving me a bottle opener to take to my room to pop the bubbly (Pellegrino), as neither of us could be completely certain the room was stocked with one.

This town is known for its service industry and I felt obligated to share a poor representation. I've eaten at the Lucky Penny at the Palms multiple times and never experienced such a dissatisfactory service. It started off with waiting 25 min just take our order. Then I watched my cocktail at the bar sitting for an additional 10 min before it was served.  I then had to get up and ask the manager to send our server over for a refill. One of my guests sat for 18 min with no drink. Even after the manager spoke with Francisco , our waiter, it still took 48 min for our food to hit the table. Then when I reviewed my order, I noticed it was missing one of the main ingredients listed on the menu. Pizza Margherita without tomatoes. After discussing with Francisco, he then proceeded to tell me that the chef said that it's not included. I presented the menu to prove this was part of the description and he then said ""oh yeah, your right.""  He then said they can add them after the fact and I refused. My guests were already finished eating by the time this offer to rectify was presented to me. After chatting with my 5 guests I also found out that 2 other orders were incorrect.  Finally I got the bill and nothing was done to compensate for poor service besides removing the pizza I sent back. So against my better judgment I still threw a 20% tip and paid the bill. I the proceeded to share the experience the the manager Sterling. After hearing the experience, he said I'm sorry and that was basically it. Nothing was done to try rectify the evenings dissatisfied experience. I wasn't looking for a free meal by any means, however the fact that I still paid for my watered down Moscow Mule was insulting enough.

4176745,2017-07-18,2,y7TV2trR4B9sbgXtyrqv8Q,"Went here for breakfast today.  Overpriced!

We were locals and regulars at the cafe that was at this location in the Palms.  We think the waitress Karen is one of the best.  We followed to the steak house location while they gutted and remodeled the cafe.   Today was our first time back to the location of the cafe now called the Lucky Penny.  

Would have rated it a 1 except for the great attentive waitress service of Karen.  

Big time disappointed in breakfast.  Prices went up.  Value for your dollar is now low.  Went for Steak and Eggs.  $19.  Two of us ordered it.  Can't tell you if it is worth it or not.   Karen had to come back and tell us it was not available today. 

Went with a Ham and Cheese Omelet.  $13   Very similar to breakfast places serving it for under $10.  Coffee now $3.  Omelet came with one slice of toast not two.  My butter that I spread on it never melted.  

Not one to complain and make a scene.  Not ever looking for a free meal by complaining in front of everyone.  More of a silent complainer....I just don't return.  I ate the omelet.  Didn't complain, but it doesn't mean I enjoyed the experience.

The trend seems to be remodeling and upping the prices at several of the off strip casinos many locals visit.  Guess they don't want us?   At least there is still free parking at the Palms. 

Hate to tell them but we still get killer steak and eggs for $9.99 and $2.50 coffee elsewhere.  Can't see paying a $25+ breakfast bill when you start including a tip.",yLpkTs6giYbA0rCP9pDiYQ,5,2,2,GHK3c_JblceCF4CFLjyCsg

Anyway, onto the food.  I came here for dinner, but they serve breakfast/lunch/dinner options all day.  I felt in the mood for some breakfast, so I ordered the machaca and it was great.  It wasn't like other machacas I've had, but all the ingredients were on point, and by the time it occurred to me to take a picture, it was already in my belly.  Oh well.

A table near us apparently ordered the fish & chips and dear god, the fish was big.  It may have been Moby Dick himself.

Waffle-Grilled Cheese $13 the combination of cheeses were delightful and the tomato soup was amazing as well. 

Caesar Salad $9+Shrimp $7 a-little more dressing than I'd prefer but it was definitely a great balance with the savory sweet food ordered. Great portion size.

Chai Latte French Toast $11 The spiced caramel syrup was sweet just how I like it accompanied by huge slices of French Toast.

Really neat use of pennies! Food was solid. I had corned beef hash which was made in house. Nice chunks of corned beef were very moist. They have these cool potato cakes for their breakfast potato option which my husband liked. But overall the experience was a 3 Star one. Service was TERRIBLE! And it wasn't just us. Saw many angry faces waiting for service either drinks or food or just to be greeted by a server. One party left angry before they even could order a drink, while we were there. The drink I ordered at the very beginning came AFTER our food! We also had to ask for basic condiments like ketchup and jelly.  I don't blame this all on the server. Seems like staff isn't used efficiently. They could help each other way more. That's on the manager who was visible but not really involved even as the place got busier. 

I would however, be willing to give it an extra star for three things which I'll explain below:

BLOODY MARY - Kentucky Mary. Made with bourbon and with some smoke flavor. House made Bloody Mary mix was good consistency, smooth and flavorful. Never had one with bourbon and I liked it.  They have 4 other varieties with 4 different liquors which we were told were custom made to complement each liquor used by the awesome hostess.

HOSTESS- she had red hair and I didn't catch her name but wish I had. She should be manager. She helped us decide on drinks and gave great suggestions! Greeted us after the meal too. Made poor service more tolerable. 

CRUFFIN - cross between a croissant and a muffin that resembles a cinnamon roll. Delicious! Took ours for the road.

Yes there are green strings in my pancakes. not even sure why because it wasnt from the berries. I was so done at this point I was now running late for my flight and asked them if they could rush my check. I get my check and it says bacon vegetables and pancakes.

Breaking with tradition for Station Casinos nomenclature, each of their prior properties including Red Rock labeling the all-day and all-night dining option as simply ""Grand Café"" with the majority of these locations executing better than necessary, Lucky Penny shows a lot of forward thinking in terms of both branding and décor, the formerly dark space now open widely to the gaming floor with plenty of televisions, gold chandeliers and marble plus several unique touches including neon affirmations and cute creatures made of discarded household items.

Not hiding its 'everything to everyone' aspirations, a necessity for any Restaurant intending to keep up with the likes of HeXx, Grand Lux or Mr. Lucky's, it was just past 6:00pm on a Friday that five diners sat down at a large table toward the back of the space where Chef Kudrak was currently helping cooks dial in a menu featuring no less than fifty items, everything from Pancakes to a Lobster Roll and Mongolian Beef offered alongside specialty Cocktails and Shakes, the meal divided into four courses and starting out with Breakfast that featured lemony Eggs Benedict served with crispy Potato squares plus Custard-soaked Chai Latte French Toast flanked in Whipped Cream and a big stack of fluffy Cinnaroll Pancakes dripping with Cream Cheese Frosting.

Part self-selecting the menu and part allowing the kitchen to fill in with some of their favorites it was after some debate as to just how much of the triple-stack to enjoy that servers reset the table for a round of appetizers, two big Shakes with a creamy base and carefully crafted balance soon joining soft-drinks and an unfortunately flat Nitro Coffee as the group received Mexican, Chinese and American favorites; the Pot stickers fairly dull in terms of their filling while both the Tortilla topped in spicy Chicken and the skewered Buffalo Wings fared far better, the former particularly noteworthy as it eats lighter than one would guess with the stuffed Tortilla fried up crisp yet virtually oilless.

Serving Entrees and Sides as a slow roll-out over the course of thirty minutes it was here that Las Vegas gained yet another entry in the race for best Chicken and Waffles, the ""Almost Boneless"" Breasts pounded out and perfectly tender in golden Batter atop Drop Biscuits taken to the Waffle iron while the Walnut Shrimp and Kung Pao Spaghetti were both on par with any similar plate on Spring Mountain Road, though the later would potentially benefit from a thinner style of Noodle.

Lightening things up a bit with some Greens, the chopped Kale and Apples tossed with Endive, Grapes and Walnuts taken up a notch by bright Vinaigrette, those thinking that Lucky Penny would go 'boring' in its American offerings will be surprised to realize that both the dunkable 'Waffle' Grilled Cheese and Steak Frites with Paprika Fries and herbal Aioli are the sort of thing one might see on the lunch menu at Delmonico, the Margherita Pizza bubbling up with a good blister and leopard spotted underside topped in hand-crushed Tomatoes and imported Buffalo Mozzarella. 

At this point well sated with several unfinished plates boxed as leftovers Chef Kudrak once again stopped by to explain how he did not want Lucky Penny's Desserts to be 'generic,' the decision to instead bring on a full-time Pastry Chef paying immediate dividends not only in terms of the to-go case up front but the menu's opening lineup of Triple Chocolate Cake served with a spiral of Mousse, a piping-hot Chocolate Brownie served with Vanilla Ice Cream and Red Velvet Cookie spokes and the ""Inverted Key Lime Pie"" that would not look out of place on the menu at Yardbird, CUT or even perhaps L'Atelier.

FOUR STARS:  Fulfilling a promise to update The Palms to modern times, and taking a chance in breaking tradition with an entirely new 24/7 concept despite the obvious success of Grand Café across several venues, Station Casinos appears to have a winner on its hands with Lucky Penny, the 'necessary' Hotel dining option doing more than just satisfying its role and actually presenting several dishes on par with restaurants nearly twice its pricepoint in an environment that is both casual and inviting.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,4,Vk292L5OxB0oK3GlhdKOvQ

The lighting is bright and fits the white and yellow tones, really providing an uplifting place to enjoy your food. My favorite part of the meal, I'm skipping straight to dessert, was the cookie/ice cream dish. This put pazooki's to shame. It's red velvet browniesque goodness tingles your soul.
The service was awesome and our server was very conversational. You could tell she was aware of when to let us quietly enjoy our meal, and also when we were just sitting back, taking a break, and looking at each other to start a conversation. 
Really a cute cafe and a great addition to the palms. 
Just a plus, the manager came to our table multiple times to check on us and make sure we were completely satisfied. Worth the time and definitely worth the money.",UKZzjAU7BZ6_UuuccT728A,0,1,5,rbmj1bRecBIo7DffQ1ffcQ

The Soup was definitely loaded. Served in a large shallow bowl, the soup was topped with Sour Cream, Bacon, Scallions, Cheddar Fries, Poblano Chiles and Fried Onions. It tasted very good, but there were so many Fries that they soaked up too much of the soup. If I get this again, I would order the fries on the side. The Gyoza were perfectly pan fried dumplings with a flavorful filling of Pork, Shrimp and Scallions. I also had a Nitrogen infused Iced Coffee that was smooth and strong.

A few days later, I stopped in for a hangover soothing Breakfast of Oatmeal with Brown Sugar, Walnuts and Dried Cranberries with a side of extra crispy Bacon and an Iced Mocha.

The Staff was friendly and helpful and the Restaurant is very wheelchair friendly, including accessible seating at the counter, which I took advantage of both visits! I will definitely be back.",e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,2,2,4,dpon2PywVN9Gp04RzH2F1A

The service is great, very very attentive and helpful with your orders.  The restaurant is recently remodeled and is bright with a hip vibe.

I absolutely love the Pizza salad and the Brussel Sprouts with bonito flakes.  I know there was someone who said they did not like the pizza but I have had the margarita as well and think it is the bomb.com.

Overall, great restaurant and I will be back. :)",EuI4SB5ek0NYGN5F1-ZG2Q,0,2,5,DPqn_n0QzpH_0DPfo4Vx6w

5754896,2017-07-31,0,y7TV2trR4B9sbgXtyrqv8Q,"I had high hopes due to the good rating on Yelp but I was disappointed. We started off by ordering bloody marys and were excited because they had an interesting variety of them on the menu. After almost 15 minutes we still didn't have our drinks so I started looking around for our waitress. She saw me looking for her and went straight to the bar knowing I was probably wondering where the drinks were. After a few more minutes, she finally comes over with them. She sets three down even though we'd only ordered two, told us the bartender messed up and made the wrong one so she was going to give us what we ordered plus the mistake. That's nice but she never said anything like, thanks for waiting almost 20 minutes for your drinks or I'm sorry that took so long. She said nothing. Not even 15 seconds after she set our drinks down, the food arrived. We tasted the drinks and the tomatillo Bloody Mary was delicious but the other two were weird. My boyfriend didn't even drink his or the freebie because they just didn't taste good. Our food was bland. I got the short rib hash and my boyfriend got the eggs benedict. The hash needed quite a bit of salt and pepper and the hollandaise on the benedict was a bizarre consistency. The sauce had clearly broken but they served it anyway. The service was awful overall. Our waitress was never around. She did finally come by and comment that the two bloody marys had not been touched and asked if we liked them. We were honest and said no and she looks at us and says, ""oh"" and walks away. I wish I was making that up but I'm not. One redeeming thing that happened was that a gentleman stopped by our table and asked us for our honest opinions on the drinks because he said they'd been getting mixed reviews and so we told him. (This happened before our waitress stopped by and asked about them). He took the other drink off our bill which we really appreciated. It was a really long, really mediocre experience. Maybe we came on an off day but I won't risk wasting another 50 dollars to find out.",ubGWaxJ-Cv_K60zVtHk-qg,1,0,1,9zBxcCAQJnNfTs7T5cJLDA
