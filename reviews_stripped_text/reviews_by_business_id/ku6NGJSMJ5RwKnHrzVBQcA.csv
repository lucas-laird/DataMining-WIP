Reason for two stars is because they seemed disorganized, and the bartender told me that ordering food was separate from the bar so they had us open two tabs. Waitress from Thai food place did not honor the 50% off one entree offer on yelp. She dropped off the check and never came to pick it back up, nor did she ever check up on us. Thankfully, the bartender grabbed utensils and took care of us even though it was the other waitresses job",2J1HhwWULZASkyx1wUCAJA,2,0,2,ME_6ZkJteXNZS_yExWwVHQ

I ended up staying here 'till 2AM and closing out the place with a duet of Bohemian Rhapsody (I dont even like Karaoke)! The drinks were also free. I was playing Keno, so the bartender kept bringing in these massive drinks.

I want to say now to not even bother with the check in deal because they don't honor it.

My friend was the one to get half off which is good because I would have rather her have it than me, but I don't want to be excited thinking I'm going to get a deal that they won't even give you.

2987375,2012-02-26,0,ku6NGJSMJ5RwKnHrzVBQcA,"I stumbled upon this place by accident - I'm not a local, but enjoy drinking anyplace off the strip where people are just relaxing and having a good time.  It's a good place for either a quick drink or spending the evening with friends.  It has recently been remodeled and has a nice clean atmosphere.  

There was a small mixed crowd when I visited; everyone was friendly and having a good time.  We were all enjoying the cool mix of techno, blues and oldschool rock.  It was just my style.  The bartender was hot and friendly and the drinks were great too.

There there is a nicely-sized bar in the center with a few tables around the walls.  There is a large adjoining room that would be perfect for gatherings, or to belt out some tunes during Karaoke on Wednesday nights! There are plenty of HD TV's for sports and other entertainment too.

The biggest surprise was the excellent food.  They serve a full menu of mostly Asian, but I'm sure you could get most anything you wanted.  I tried the shrimp Pad-Thai, upon recommendation of the barkeep (shoutout to Daisy :) and it was, very good.  The prices are fair and the quality was high.  They even have little wooden trays that sit on the edge of the bar, so you can continue your video poker play while you eat.  I love it!!!

It's an easy place to get to and there is plenty of parking too.  It's just west of the old Sahara, so most of the surrounding area is currently pretty empty.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.  I know I'll be back next time I'm in town.",hxAjvC8VLySwafhYG9b8LQ,4,2,5,vx5HO3kCyekCPUFTf9o3HQ

3675380,2013-10-22,0,ku6NGJSMJ5RwKnHrzVBQcA,"Came here for a Cowboys game and hung out with the Las Vegas Cowboys Elite Club for the day.  The bar itself is a nice find right off the strip and the layout is actually pretty nice.  The bar is situated right in front of you as you walked in but the lounge area we were hanging out and watching the game is was off to the side.  The lounge here is what really shines out of the entire place.  it comes with a bunch of projector screens situated around the room and a giant one at the front of the lounge in case you aren't situated by any of the other projectors.  Lots of room to sit around the lounge and, I'm not sure if they always have tables in the middle of the room, but the bar set up some tables for additional seating so everyone can watch the Cowboys game.  Just a head's up though, during the Cowboys game, they allow smoking in the lounge area even though there is a sign that says 'No smoking beyond this point'.  I wasn't too happy about sitting in a smoky room all game so just a head's up for anyone interested in stopping by to watch a Cowboys game at this bar.

Regarding food and drink, they have a standard collection and nothing too crazy.  I'm not sure if it's a Cowboys Club thing, but the bar makes shots for everyone in the bar every time the Cowboys score, which I think is pretty awesome.  But what really stands out here is the Thai food options to order.  Having a Thai food option instead of just straight bar food was pretty nice.  The food was delicious and the portions were a comfortable size but left me a little hungry for the price.  The lady taking our order from the Thai restaurant actually mixed up the Cowboys game time menu with the regular Thai menu and actually charged us more than what was advertised for the Chicken Satay.  She said I was given the regular plate, not the happy hour plate and came back an hour later to collect more money from me even though the price stated on the menu was what I wanted.  At least she made the effort to cross out the Chicken Satay on the game time menu.. but I was still irritated that they made the mistake and decided not to eat the cost instead of pester me about paying up for their mistake.  Aside from that they only other thing I can comment on is the bathroom.  The bathroom was a bit small and I kept bumping into people as I came in and out of the bathroom.

Overall, I've definitely been to much better but it's not that bad here.  I managed to stick it out with the smokiness and mis-charging of food but it definitely fell short of what I consider to be a pleasurable experience (...and I consider myself a pretty easy to please guy).  I do commend them for trying to support the local Cowboys fans and create a spot for the Club to hangout for games and activities.  However, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon as some aspects need to change for me to be comfortable here.",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,1,1,2,-CvHG6K_DjpiPsfGY5NcdA

4409632,2011-06-07,7,ku6NGJSMJ5RwKnHrzVBQcA,"I suppose I won't be able to get too many first reviews in Vegas from now on, so I'monna jump on this!

When I lived on West Sahara, I used to go past this place all the time. It used to be a video poker bar that looked too intimidating for me to go into and was shut down for a while. I saw them put a dumpster out for several weeks and guys were picking the place apart. Eventually they put up some new, non-lit signage. On a side note, this was when golden Steer down the strip mall, decided the recession was bad enough to try and open for lunches, but that's getting ahead of my review for them. I must focus, huh?

There was a time on nights my g/f would work and I would have a night off, I would walk around the area for dinner or exploring. I missed the ""grand"" opening of the place, but this place looked inviting enough that I wandered in one night and there were only a few people at the bar. Inside looked clean and well lit at the bar area. The surprise was there were a couple of bartenders (as opposed to one bartender per every hundred customers) and someone setting up the DJ area for another connecting dancefloor room. 

I got a beer and checked out the plastic bar special promo cards and fliers on the bar and the bartender told me to help myself. There was a food setup behind where I was. Dude, you had me at FREE EATS. They had roasted garlic chicken and veggies and bread and things. I devoured that up, roller! 

The bartenders were talking to this couple at the other end of the bar about their strategies of winning and something else. Damn it, I appear to be getting ""Saget Ted HIMYM memory gap,"" I hate that. But one thing you can always be sure of at a bar, listening to people's gambling strategies. I do listen to them, eventually something interesting comes out of it despite the fact that 97% of it is fluff and exaggeration. We all know, if the system worked, they wouldn't be sitting at a little bar off the strip. I would only take actual gambling advice from a Phil Hellmuth, Jean Scott or yes, a woman I met at MGM who I found out won the lottery back in her home state 4- FOUR times. I never told her I knew. She had very odd behaviors before I found out. Funny how someone's quirks become eccentricities when you find out they're rich. Or a porn star. 

So one of the couple nails a 4 of a kind- confirming at least a competant level of their length of play to match their stories- and let's say a few rounds of drinks were given to all us around the bar! All 5 of us. Different mixed shots, for me that's a wow. Because it took me my 20's and most of my 30's- meaning all- to learn to not have more than 2 types of alcohol in one night or my stomach would become a bobsled race nobody wins. It either goes up or down, thru the goddamn fence. 

So, in 4 hours we're all pals, telling stories and crying on each others shoulders, FUCK YOU, I love you maan. Guys are so bipolar on shotskis. I decided for one last beer to ""taper down"" and be on my merry. I said my goodbyes and checked out. My tab? 2 beers, $6. I paid more for the tip! 

So, basically I had a buffet and 6 drinks for $15! I woulda paid over $30 for that experience. the magic of Vegas. A good long wlak some helped the sobering pro-cess. I went back many times after. while I heard about the vid poker couple coming in, I didn't see them again. The bartender knew me after, that's for sure.

5466127,2011-10-12,11,ku6NGJSMJ5RwKnHrzVBQcA,"Going here the other night may have very possibly one of the most fun nights that I have ever had.

Okay, so it's a little dive bar, nothing too unique about that in Vegas.  But it was the sign out front that made me stop my car, throw it in reverse, and drive back to see if I read the banner correctly:

Porn star karaoke.

It's true!  Monday nights at 10:00, porn stars call it a day from their jobs and come to this rather cheery bar with a good vibe to belt out some tunes.  And everybody is super nice.  From the great bartenders to the hostess who has apparently been in over 26,000 films.  At this point, all boasting rights I've ever had as an actor are laid silent, because I am never going to beat that.

So the initial call to new wacky situations was strong enough to summon out the missus, my good friend and I to sit, drink cheap, tasty drinks, and belt out tunes alongside a whole cadre of adult film actors.  And they can sing.  And they also flash more than a few boobs while singing, so if that's also your thing, then there you go.  They even play some crazy games, of which my friend won a prize.

There may be too many highlights to list, but I think one of my personal favorites was being able to stun a group of porn stars into open mouthed wonder with my rendition of Michael Jackson's ""Rock With You"".  I thought about singing ""How Deep Is Your Love"" from the Bee Gees, but that's perhaps too tacky and obvious.  But they have a sense of humor, so who knows?

I've done a lot of karaoke, and I've been to a lot of bars, but nothing like this.    I would completely have to recommend the Red Label on a Monday night as a ""must do"" Vegas experience.  It's hilarious, quirky, and way too much fun.

Well I'm here to say I found one at Red Label. As unwelcomed as I felt at the other spot this experience was the complete opposite. If you bleed Cowboy blue come thru! Great atmosphere w/ a true dive bar feel accompanied by true knowledgeable diehard fans! Not to mention they are good friendly peeps too.
