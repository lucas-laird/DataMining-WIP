My hubby and I stopped in to this cute restaurant again before heading to the LV Knights game against Ottawa. Perfect location and great food on a Friday evening. Love the prices !!! Most places on the strip are priced WELL above the average persons pocketbook. My hubby and i ordered a dozen oysters each. The chef recommended one order from the west coast and one from the east coast. Great suggestion since my hubby and i got to sample a little from both. We headed on to the fried pickles (seriously yum !!) and the fried green beans. Another yum !! Fish and chips for entree was a very large piece of cod that was cooked to perfection. We skipped dessert because that was more than enough food for both of us. Kudos to our excellent waitress ""J"" !! She was both attentive and charismatic and I'd steal her from here if i had a restaurant !!!  

BTW ... i love to review places that are either a 5 Star or a 1 Star in my humble opinion. And you can rest assure my review is legit. 

Great experience all the way around. My hubby and I ordered several items so we could share. Highly recommend the fish and chips. Batter was crispy and the fish was perfectly flaky. The chips were hot and fresh and also crispy. The bangers and mash were so yummy. The flavors in the sausage were exactly how I remembered them tasting in our favorite London Pub. Ordered the sliders and honestly had to take them to go because we had entirely too much food. But they were delicious reheated for a midnight snack. That's what vacations are all about right ??!!",GUgo7Dg6-cSh--1VS7XCZQ,0,0,5,xYuOtr_x4DhScSb1Ze_UxA

Sadly, we did not feel welcomed to wait till 10am, and we were discouraged from eating here. Rude service before we even entered the Pub.

Food is at your table honestly probably within 10 minutes of ordering. I've tried the pub burger, the Ruben, the breakfast sandwich, and the French dip. I really have no complaints about any of them. The thing they all have in common is that they're all relatively simple and classic but very, very good! Too many places nowadays have too many different flavors packed into their dishes. A burger doesn't need a zillion things on it to be good, it just needs good ingredients, and I feel like that's what the pub has. Also the fries are seriously good!

We should have asked first because the corn dogs come on a bed of fries and they are really good small bites. I think my least favorite item was the truffled parmesan fries and they were really good too, just a little too much truffle for my taste.

1/2 hour wait for patio seating? Even though tables are empty and are not reserved. Fish and Chips, Burger, Fries, Wings, Breakfast - ALL terrible and cold too. 

The place is nice and bright enough though with plenty of TVs to catch sporting events. Shame. In an emergency it may be alright to have an overpriced drink/beer only. But you will most definitely be disappointed and rank this as one of your worst dining experiences ever.

The beer selection was fine, the bartender was friendly, and the food was... uninspiring. I get that it's not fine dining, but this was on the low end of what I'd consider pub fare.

However, I'm giving it an extra star because it provided me with some of the best entertainment of my trip. A guy a few seats down from me at the bar ordered a pastrami sandwich. He was really unhappy with the quality of the pastrami, and proceeded to have the absolute weirdest reaction I've ever seen. He proclaimed LOUDLY that he didn't want a discount and didn't want to make a big deal of it but that it was the WORST quality pastrami he ever experienced. He really didn't want a discount, a refund, or a replacement - apparently he just wanted to lecture every single staff member about the evils of low-quality pastrami and the perils of buying your meat from the lowest-cost bidder. For a good 45 minutes. Maybe he was a meat salesman? The extra star is for the staff, who were unfailingly polite to this weirdo.


Edit to add that the lady who sat down after meat critic left also ordered the pastrami and seemed to enjoy it.",eEMXOPTzjp_3FOfsXfG8LA,1,0,3,BGMhuZ254KI_i8b_oW7ItQ

I asked for egg whites instead of regular eggs, no butter on my toast and eggs. As she went back to the kitchen to explain the order to the chef he yelled at her for all the accommodations and so when she came back to us to explain that we could no longer as for anything else to be changed because the chef was mad it put us in a very very uncomfortable situation to where we were hesitate to ask for anything else such as condiments, hot sauce, or anything else. This was the worst experience ever and we will never go back. It wasn't worth the money or stress that it put on us. We where there to enjoy ourselves and that did not happen.
