But if you just want a chili cheese fry and a hot dog with relish, ketchup, mustard and onions, Nathan's at MGM is sufficient. The food was fast food good. But they did mess up the order which should have added chili and cheese to the dogs.  Mind you, I'm a burger and fry freak who does triathlons at the Iron distance so I don't take my cheat meals lightly.

Ordered Scrambled eggs & bacon with a side of sausage, coffee and no toast. Eggs were moist & fluffy and I loved that they added country gravy on top of my eggs without charging extra. Nice!

Nathan's Famous has happily sat as the anchor position in the MGM Grand Casino's food hall for as long as I can recall and has always been the one place I end up at some point on every Vegas run. At first, ?this was mere coincidence but over time it has developed into a hardcore tradition built around my fondness for New York City and Chili Cheese anything. 

The menu is larger than it has any need to be but the focal point is obvious: Hot Dogs, Fries, and Hot Dogs. They also serve Salads, Chicken Sandwiches, and other sacrilege? but you will have to read about those options from the kind of Yelper that would get a Salad at Nathan's and then review it. You know - a ""Tool"". 

I always do things one way regardless of ?Nathan's location: One footlong? World Famous Chili Cheese Dog, Chili Cheese Fries, and the Old Fashioned Lemonade. If you just thought? to yourself ""That is too much Chili"" you are fundamentally incorrect. The Chili is what ties this all together?. That and you will be visiting? Nathan's far beyond inebriated?...

The Lemonade and Fries are just as good as the Coney Island original you love. The Chili Cheese Dog is a madman in its? own right but I will be real with it - I have come across some stale Buns over the years regularly which diminishes? a true classic ?if only a little. It is still the only Hot Dog I care about in Vegas.

I got the Sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin, add bacon the first morning. I figured they would just add bacon to the sandwich, but they gave me a good amount on the side. I think like 5 strips. I believe it was an extra $2 to add bacon, so the amount justified the cost. The second morning, I got the same sandwich without adding bacon. I believe the sandwich was over $5, but less than $6. I can't really remember as I didn't document any of these meals. Both days, the sandwiches hit the spot! I liked that the cheese was melted on the egg and not all over the muffin as I could just eat the inside of the sandwich if I wasn't super hungry.

I guess that fact is I still remember this experience vividly.  

Ever stay at the MGM and have to spend an entire night vomiting in / sitting on the toilet in your hotel room?  Well, I have.  And the only thing I had to eat that day?  A hot dog and cheese fries from Nathan's at the MGM.  

All food poisoning aside, the food still tasted like shit.  I don't see how anyone has ever eaten one of those hot dogs and thought ""this tastes good!"".  Those are probably the same people eating at a McDonald's every day, and the ones that build the hype machine around Nathan's annual 4th of July cattle call on Coney Island.  

And the employees that worked here were FAR less than enthused about their career path.  Out of the group of six people I was with, I was the only one to eat at Nathan's.  The rest of the group, all five of them, got their food before me.  I think it had something to do with the cheese sauce they put on my fries, which unbeknownst to me at the time, would likely be the cause of my food poisoning later.  Anyway, if I worked here I would seriously contemplate self immolation or starting up a promising career in the drug game (Las Vegas is a great place for drugs, I hear).  

I guess the one positive out of this is my friends get to tell the story of me running for a trash can in hotel room and vomiting into it in the hallway, as our bathroom was being occupied by a female at the time.

Why do I choose to keep coming here?  Mainly because the line is not too long and the food comes out fairly quick. Located in the busy MGM food court, Nathan's Famous is one of the chains that can be frequently found throughout the Las Vegas strip.  With other viable options here, the food here is simply not up to snuff to warrant the high cost of the mediocre product that comes out.  

Here is what I have ordered:
Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich- Everytime I have ordered this the chicken has been lukewarm and underseasoned.  I also found the bun preparation inconsistent.  Sometimes it came out a little warm and other times there was a char on the bottom.  I say go for this item if you must get something with chicken, but it has never been fully satisfying.

Sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich - An okay breakfast sandwich.  I did enjoy that the English muffin was toasted nice to get that nice crunch and the cheese melted nice and evenly with the egg.  However, the size was on the smaller side making it not very satisfying.

Perhaps because I have not actually ordered the hot dogs which Nathan's is well known for I am not giving them a fair assessment of their product.  However, I do believe if you are not able to produce a similar quality product on your other items you are better off not serving the item.

Overall, the food here at Nathan's is nothing to be excited about and definitely should not be your go to place at the MGM food court which already has so many other options.",CdKvRVLHbX3pokKhj96X0w,3,3,2,4WJxsyNx-8N6EbUrfDk6nQ

It was right between breakfast/lunch switch.  I got in line for the breakfast waffle bar at Nathan's Hotdogs.  I was approached by what seemed to be a shift leader or manager in a white shirt.  She told me that she had to cut the breakfast line and that I could start a lunch line if I wanted lunch.  I totally understood, told her no worries and was first in the lunch line.  Several groups of people got behind me.  What happened next was very frustrating.  A young woman walked up and she didn't ask her to move.  I waited to make sure she was going to be served breakfast.  Once she was allowed to order a waffle I walked up to the manager and said that this was not right.  Myself along with 3 or 4 other people were refused breakfast but she let this woman order.  She then spoke to the other woman in Spanish, which I do not understand.  To add injury to insult they tried to tell me she phoned in an order.  Which was a lie; we all saw her order the waffle.  2 other people also started to complain that she too should have been turned away.  One gentleman asked to speak to her supervisor.  The supervisor just stood there like we were wasting his time.  After the gentleman explained this incident, the supervisor said Thank You, turned and walked in the back.

The hot dogs are just.  I guess you can say it's like how people go gaga over Pink's for no good reason because let's face it, Pink's isn't even really that good.  You go really only for the experience of eating at a Los Angeles institution.  I feel the same way with Nathan's.  It's such a historic New York tradition that when someone says ""I want to go try Nathan's"" not because it's THAT good, but because it's a cultural experience.  That's my two cents anyway.

Just the thought of eating that many hot dogs in the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest is both crazy and gag-inducing, so kudos to them for (literally) being able to hold all of them down.  However, now that I've tried Nathan's hot dogs for myself?  Well, let's just say I went from impressed to down right amazed...

While I had never anticipated checking out their food court neighbor, Pan Asian Express, a part of me has long wanted to try Nathan's.  Though I had heard a lot of tepid things about them, I'd always been curious about what made their hot dogs so ""famous"".  So, considering how unlikely it is I'll visit their flagship spot on Coney Island, and since I needed to be back at the conference center, this seemed as good of a time as any to check them out!

Despite how the menu includes other offerings like like cheesesteaks, burgers, and salads (?!), there was no question what I was going to get.  However, since the basic one seemed so plain (and expensive) for the money, I opted to go with their BACON CHEESE DOG ($7.98) and a side of CRINKLE CUT FRIES ($3.98).  

The short version?  Both were awful.
The longer version?  Both were really, really awful.

For one, the hot dog didn't look all that appetizing.  I figured they'd use cheese sauce/whiz, but I was expecting bits of crispy bacon, not two stripes of greasy, mealy bacon.  Even still, beyond that and the whiz (which was kind of gross), the hot dog itself wasn't very good - neither juicy nor flavorful.  As for the fries?  They tasted like the old oil they were ""fried"" in and were very soggy.  

Like nearly all of the other spots in MGM Grand's food court, Nathan's is one of the cheaper places around to find something to eat.  However, you'd be far better off spending a bit more somewhere else.  It's nice to save a few bucks, especially on The Strip, but there's a difference between being cost-conscious and being cheap and stupid.  Pass.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,9,9,1,8RDTid0tVuQ_RxtLLtWvIw

Well, for some reason tonight I decided to give it another try.  The cashier was semi-friendly, took my order and gave me the little vibrating number holder.

Finally, after 15 minutes, they were ready.  I ordered (and paid for) a side of the cheese sauce, along with hot sauce and ranch.  None of that was in my bag when she gave me my order.

$9 for hot dog and fries?!
$12 for philly cheesesteak and fries.

Everything tastes good but nothing over the top great.",VYOQLKuR0Ugy9lU-QiOuLw,0,0,2,TU6jGXNm_J3yhIkXzVCrRw

Then the following year, we tried it at MGM Grand and it was a huge disappointment. It looked good but the dog had no snap to it!! And the bread fell apart, which is one of my pet peeves when it comes to a hot dog. A bun should never, ever break!!! 

One positive thing? I ordered grilled onions (it's not on the menu so you have to ask) and they were the best part of my meal.

Maybe I need to go back to NY-NY Hotel and try theirs again.",UA5-e4_EQ2T2ieKaq7c9jA,1,1,2,DYhzneUR3tWDyJiFAcW0yg

It was a very good hot dog. This place like most of the places in the MGM food court aren't always the fastest, but that can be expected for a busy place. $6 is a bit pricey for a hot dog, but again it's the MGM food court. All and all, it's not a bad option.
