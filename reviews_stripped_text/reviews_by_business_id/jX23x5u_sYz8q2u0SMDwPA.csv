Owned and run by the nicest couple, so easy going and attentive. This restaurant is in a food court with other cuisines, perfect if your friends are in the mood for something else while you get delicious Thai. But why would anyone want other than Thai?",ffxJtLOxDomnZIJo-GgHcA,0,0,5,w0RcnItFpyWc9C1ZKEpoug

New Thai in the:
University Commons Center, AKA Internet Cafe, AKA where most businesses start out, AKA Campus Commons, AKA Kaba Curry's old spot, next to the AKA old Wing King spot. 
Got it?

Greeted by excited new owners...jackass me immediately orders Pad Thai (because I love it) when this place specializes in curry.....

Veggie Pad Thai being cooked I ask for a side of curry because now I'm having regrets already because the curry smell smells bomb.
More regrets as I glance that they offer brown rice......
Kindly the couple gathers a side of curry for me to try, discounts me 20% for their grand opening, gathers a side of peanuts, I pay and I'm on my way.

Upon trying the Pad Thai when I finally get home from running errands... it's amazing!
No dumb tofu, yummy fresh veggies, including mushrooms! It is oily IMO (I usually request no oil), but it's a big portion and crispy large bean sprouts.
Really yummy.

I pop open the side red curry and taste.......BAM!!!!! I seriously thought someone shouted inside my mouth ""PARTY TIME!!!!!"" sooooo good!
I'm going to go back ASAP and order veggie curry with brown rice. I can't wait! 

I actually was not hungry today for lunch, so I took a few bites then hubs ate the rest when he got home. He really liked it too.

I need to order the papaya salad too...ugh I want to go back right meow!!!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,10,10,5,iu4ezQerYKBveq7vN5JNLA

So the setup is this is a very non-descript building from the outside but inside is a food bazaar of all different types to try.  There is an America comfort food place (Wake Up Cafe), a taco place (Tacos El Jefe), a Korean place and OF COURSE... Kang Thai.  I came for the Korean and decided to eat the Thai instead.  What a great concept.  I can picture coming here with friends and letting everyone decide what they want.  You want Thai, your friend wants America classic: no problem this place has you covered.

So to the Thai food.  I have eaten in tons of Thai restaurants over the years.  It's my go-to favorite Asian food.  I ordered the papaya salad and the super curry pasta. 

 The papaya salad was perfect.  The papaya was crisp and fresh.  The dressing was tangy and slightly salty.  There was a medley of green beans, small cherry tomatoes, and cashew nuts mixed in to add dynamic color flavor and balance.  You can order it with whatever heat level you want too.  I will definitely order it again.

The super curry pasta was pretty awesome.  Its a mixture of masaman and Panang curry mixed together into a wonderfully flavorful broth.  There are large succulent shrimp mixed in with the dish with a small side of fresh veggies to add color and texture contrast.  This is all poured over a bed of perfectly cooked wide noodle pasta.  I think the noodles are close to size and texture of fettuccine noodles.  The awesome news is with any dish which has rice, you have the option of white rice, brown rice or NOODLES.... why is this not an option everywhere?  I love having noodles with my curry.  I hope this becomes a trend for other places.  

Of course, all of this wonderful food had to be washed down with Thai tea.  Because how can anyone go to a Thai place and not get the tea?  Thankfully I can report the Thai tea is wonderful; not too sweet, a perfect mixture of milk to tea too.   

The best part.... the prices were very reasonable.  

I will definately be back.",srrer_hR93tB1ftqqo17Jw,2,3,5,d7yzdA4PI42_7iUQUfAw-g
1769465,2018-04-13,0,jX23x5u_sYz8q2u0SMDwPA,Red curry for the win! Second time this week as it is authentic Thai food  spice is on point and Pat is so friendly. She's always asking how she can help and what we prefer in order for her business to succeed. Previously tried the kaprow and it was just as delicious. Their spice level is awesome if you like it on the fiery side they can do that for you! Try it and you won't regret it!,20uBc8Sz4PAa2sNURCaxGA,0,0,5,jKST-9Lhngg1ApIivDNYvQ

3241095,2018-04-14,0,jX23x5u_sYz8q2u0SMDwPA,This place is awesome!!! Pat at the front desk was really sweet not just over the phone but in person. She was considerate enough to not put egg in my dish because she wasn't sure if I were a vegan so because of that she not only gave me the one with egg but without egg as well. The food was amazing and this place is highly recommended. I ordered the Pad Thai vegetables and it  was nothing short of amazing.   I have been to several Thai places in and outside of Las Vegas  but none as delicious as this one.,UfDcjlSwCgq4DmNovD7uIA,1,0,5,Pef5XOBvmO_FIHVdP6jDeg

4935073,2018-06-29,0,jX23x5u_sYz8q2u0SMDwPA,"Good place for lunch. Food court features Korean, Mexican, Colombian and Vegan. True test was either Pad Thai or Red Curry Chicken, both BYU the way are specialties. Went with the RCC and it did not disappoint. Spice 7 of 10 was perfect. $10.99 seemed pricey at first but the serving was good for two if you get another rice. Owners just moved back two weeks ago. Typical of this food court as stalks change frequently (except for the Korean and Mexican spots). Hope they stay though.",wRqOw05E-gDiNYsWkzmDqg,0,1,4,7gmOEQ1rOsR1aTIh_1yrxA
5034195,2018-04-25,0,jX23x5u_sYz8q2u0SMDwPA,"Pad Thai: My main complaint is that the beef was pretty bad. It was dry, tough, and not very flavorful. The noodles were a bit too hard but not terrible texture-wise. Flavor-wise the noodles were pretty sweet. I thought they were too sweet.

Fried rice: It just seemed like it was missing something. Maybe it was that there weren't any carrots. It made the dish look boring visually without that color. The onions were raw. The eggs were chopped so finely that they looked like a garnish. The chicken was also kinda dry and flavorless.

Portions: I thought they were somewhat small.

Atmosphere: The seating was in this shared cafeteria. Ie. three or four different restaurants shared the seating area. I'm not picky about atmosphere at all - food, portions, value and service are what matter to me - but if it does matter to you, the cafeteria-like atmosphere isn't good.

Prices: Dishes were around $10. Not bad, but there are many places that offer far better quality for that price.",dnsCCmwYrONjUAivm3XR4w,1,0,2,stOrYNRtXKLYKd9XMa-cxQ
