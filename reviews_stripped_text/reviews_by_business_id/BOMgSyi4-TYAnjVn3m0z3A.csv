I honestly have to say that you can't expect the prime rib to be as good as other steakhouse, but it is good enough for a decent meal. by the way, this deal is currently offered between 11am to 11pm daily.  they offered other special deals after 11pm like NY steak & eggs, etc. We also got a nice courteous server and everyone seemed nice there overall.
While we got a prime rib for each of us (me and hubby), we also got a cup of French onion soup. I gotta say they made it too salty and they cooked it with too much black pepper which overpowered the onion. So we didn't feel that it was an onion soup at all, it was more like salty beef broth instead.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,3,vXULlODAHNaJChwVwsWXog

467286,2012-01-22,0,BOMgSyi4-TYAnjVn3m0z3A,"The Palms recently changed hands; given our horrible experience at the 24 Seven Cafe, the changes aren't for the better.  This coffee shop, located adjacent to the Palms' convenient self parking garage, used to be inexpensive and reasonably decent.  Now the food is inedible and the prices eye-popping.  There are American and Asian menus.  The American menu features $10 burgers, $12 BLT sandwiches, and late at night a $7 ham steak and eggs (toast is extra).  Soft drinks are $4 and a cup of hot water with a tea bag will set you back $5 -- unless you order from the Asian menu where hot tea is $1 per person.  We wound up ordering from the less-expensive Asian menu.  One of us had $9 kung pao chicken which was OK, but rice is now $1, and the free crispy noodles with duck sauce and mustard that used to arrive automatically is no more.  I ordered the $9 beef chow fun with gravy.  It almost arrived with the kung pao, but the waitress said, oops, we forgot the gravy so I sat there for 15 minutes or so watching my SO eat her kung pao while they redid the chow fun.  The beef chow fun with gravy turned out to be no fun, the ""gravy"" was some tasteless brown substance that was so greasy the chow fun noodles slid off the fork every time I tried to eat them.  The beef was likewise bland and inedible.  A bottle of soy sauce was served with brown crud caked onto the side of the bottle.  ""It's only dried soy sauce,"" she explained.

There is just no comparison to, say, the excellent and reasonably priced Chinese and American fare a few miles down the Strip at the South Point.  You can also drive a mile or so north to Las Vegas' Chinatown.  What is the Palms' management thinking?  $4 iced tea?

I have to say that this prime rib special is probably the best ""value-class"" prime rib I've had in recent memory.  It's got a real flavorful crust and combined with the equally good au jus and creamy horseradish, is more enjoyable than any buffet prime rib I've had in Vegas.  It's probably as good, if not better in flavor to higher end buffet prime rib like Bacchanal's or Wicked Spoon's.  Unlike buffet prime rib this one is sliced a meal size of 10 ounce, instead of the typical thin slices in buffets.

I've had much better prime rib ofcourse and this won't hold a candle against Lawry's or even just a local steakhouse quality prime rib such as the Cortez Room's.

Mr chose the Fruit Tart & a latte - the fruit was sweet & ripe & the custard base wasn't too sweet - it was a nice little snack break

I stayed at The Palms during my last visit to Vegas and 24 Seven Cafe was my GO TO spot while I was there. 

I took advantage of the specials that started at 10AM and 10PM. You can get a really affordable breakfast for less than $10. One of their breakfast specials included a ham steak, home fries or hash browns, eggs (any which way), AND toast. That's a really hearty breakfast if you want to have a full stomach in order to prepare for all the sightseeing, shopping, etc. you might be planning on doing throughout the day.

Service is decent, but it isn't bad either. 

My one helpful tip: Sign up for the Palms card (which is ABSOLUTELY free) and take advantage of the discounts/cheaper prices for every item on the menu. The difference is about a $1 or so for each item, but that really does add up.

Bit into the strawberry, and a brown crumbly dust fell out of the leafy part of it. I said to myself YUM!! A dusting of chocolate! Dipped my finger into it. AND CRUNCH. Tasted like dirt. WHY?

Because it WAS dirt. It got all over my plate and my lovely, Monte Crisco. Appetite instantly gone. 

I promptly, with a heavy heart and sad tummy, told the waitress about the dirt. She was totally sweet about it, and even went and chastised the kitchen about what happened. Without even asking her, the meal was comped, but I left hungry. I did not want to eat anything else from there.

The cafe was busy but not overly crowded, so our server greeted us and took our drink requests immediately. I hadn't seen this friend in four years, so we were excitedly chatty, and had forgotten to actually look at the menu to see what we wanted. Our waitress was patient, and was very kind about us needing another minute before she took our order. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles, and my friend ordered the french toast. Our breakfasts arrived at our table quickly, and oh my, was it delicious!

Our city is unfortunately lacking in the chicken and waffles specialty restaurant, but I have found a new favorite spot for this dish specifically. The chicken pieces were huge, but tender and juicy (other places tend too be overly tough and chewy). The waffles were tiny little circles of cute little, amazingly flavorful fluff. Did I mention the maple butter served on the side, and the maple bacon pieces on top? TASTE BUDS BLOWN. 

I gobbled my meal up, and because my mouth was full of sweet and salty perfection, my friend did most of the talking. It was the perfect scenario, really. I got to silently satisfy my sweet and salty obsession, all while letting my dear friend fill me in on all the happy things that were going on in her life.

Our waitress once again was very attentive; when I asked for a to go box, she even offered me a to go cup for my iced coffee, and offered another cup of coffee to go in case mine had been watered down from sitting. 

It was a struggle ya'll, to take a piece of chicken and waffle home for my son to try. I could have ate it all up that morning at that time. Luckily, my friend had a plane to catch and had to get going, and I figured I'd be the good, kindhearted sweet and salty loving person that I pride myself on, and share a piece of this luscious goodness. 

My son enjoyed my leftovers just as much as I did when the meal first came out hot and fresh.

I wanted to order take-out. I waited in line for a while (because there was no hostess to tell me otherwise), and had obviously just come in from the casino (i.e. NOT paying my tab). I got to the front and asked to place a to go order. The cashier told me extremely rudely that I would need to go sit at a counter to get service and THEN ask my waitress to take my to go order. Really? Fine. Whatever.

Then I waited 30 minutes for a waitress. The cashier and another server walked past me several times, I even asked to place my order a couple of times, they both told me they weren't my server. 

My server finally came. I placed my order and asked if she could bring me the check so I could pay while I waited. No dice. She said she'd bring me the check when she brought me the food.

I waited another 25 minutes or so for my food (not a huge deal, I was just already annoyed at this point), and then had to remind her that it was a to go order and have it repackaged as take-out. 

Then, when she brought it back, I had to ask again for the check. Waited quite a while for that. To the point that my food was definitely cold before I got it.

This is SO against my 'dining out' code for more reasons than one, mostly because I consider myself quite an awesome grilled cheese sandwich maker.

My son got macaroni and cheese with lobster.  It was $2 extra to add chicken, beef, or lobster, so he wasn't surprised when it wasn't ""real"" lobster.

I think any food after a night of going to two nightclubs in Vegas and having some alcohol in your system tastes good.  We came here a little after 2am and our waitress didn't lag on taking our orders and the food came immediately. 

I couldn't ask for a better egg's benedict this late into the night, or should I say so early in the morning? I loved how the poached eggs floated atop the English muffin halves with a slice of ham in between, all drenched in hollandaise sauce.  It sounds fatty, and I'm sure it is, but heck, I was on vacation.  It was served with hash browns, which I could have done without.  A couple of my friends ordered from the Chinese menu...how cool is that...a place that serves your typical American breakfast-type food and also gives you oriental options.  But being Chinese, I didn't really care to glance at what was offered or to order any of the dishes since I eat it every time I visit home.

It took just over 20-minutes before we were served our food.  Not sure what the hold up was, they had tons of servers/bussers and the restaurant was practically empty, maybe they needed to grab our breakfast straight from the farm...wouldn't that be nice...keep dreaming.

When our food came, I have to say it was pretty decent.  The steak, although not quite being classified as USDA Prime, it certainly fixed my steak craving.  It was also accompanied with hash browns, two eggs and toast or English muffin.

Sharing plates as conversation flowed free it would not be long before both stacks of carbs were diminished and with check soon settled it was only as we reached the exit that I noticed the pastry case now full, a collection of cakes and cookies calling out to my substantial sweet tooth with my friend agreeable to further indulge - the end result a chewy yet subtle brownie half-coated by a dark chocolate standing in stark contrast to densely spiced carrot cake finding its foil in tangy cream cheese far less sweet than most.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,1,1,3,C-_acXDKeQbdvmpvTnvDDw

So I won't bother commenting on the espresso... a automated-machine-made macchiato?  Bad move Ryman.  But the rest was decent enough.

Nothing spectacular, mind you, but for a reasonably-priced Vegas brunch at 2pm it was perfect.

The girl had belgian waffle ($6.99) and added fresh strawberries ($1.50)... all of which was served with an enormous plate (yes a plate!) of whipped cream and syrup.  Heart attack on a plate... but hey, it's Vegas (I find myself saying that a lot, to justify poor meals, fattening meals, loss of income, high prices, etc.).  It wasn't the best waffle that I've had, but it was sweet, tasty, and the fruit was fresh and added a nice touch... the waffle was even stamped with a little Palms logo in the center (aww how cute).

Service was friendly enough, and they changed the closest television from the Patriots game to the Broncos game at my request.

Prices were reasonable, nothing was bad, 3 stars and I would definitely go back for a reasonably-priced meal.
