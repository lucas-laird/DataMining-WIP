1380625,2018-04-18,0,PYoGpgAUDgT6OMxD_fe79g,"Came here for the 3rd time for dinner after an event with some friends who hasn't been here before. We actually originally wanted to come here months ago but back then, before they had an alcohol license, they closed fairly early. 

So now, they finally got the chance !

As usual, the same waitress had served us. Always great service and attention. ,! haha ! 

My friend had gotten the Aloha Chicken. Another had gotten the spicy chicken feet. And I, again, had gotten the fried chicken with a sweet and spicy sauce. Except, the difference was, the chicken feet and fried chicken, requested for EXTRA SPICY ! 

Although their spiciness doesn't match Yasik Nara's ability to go even spicier, but their extra spicy was pretty good. Hot but manageable. All of us were able to eat it, even the not really spicy eaters. 

Whats funny is, this version of extra spicy fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce, reminded my friend of a Chinese pork dish, Peking Pork Chops (????). After she mentioned it, I did taste some resemblance. HAHA how funny. 

For the first time, I had gotten a bowl of rice to eat with my dish as well. Soft but chewy Korean rice w/ spicy fried chicken. Yum ! ugh im getting hungry while writing this..... 

Friends aloha chicken was pretty yummy. Smaller pieces of dark meat across a plate on a bed of cabbage topped with seaweed. Not spicy as well. Kind of sweet. It was pretty good. I wouldn't mind eating that as a snack XD wonder what kind of seasoning they used. 

As per usual, another good meal. XD Coming here more and more often now... uh oh XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,2,4,rLM9Ce4_5jXyWmvAjtLonA

After a couple hour wait trying to get into clubs. We decide to ditch that scene and find some good food. It was around 1 a.m. when we decided to Uber ourselves to Hon Pocha. It was a Monday night, not much of a crowd there, but that didn't bother us.

Note to self: Always take a picture of the menu. They do not have the most recent menu posted so I will try my best to remember names and prices of everything we tried. 

(Best to least fave)

Meat Jun $12
I've never had this before so I'll describe my experience. It's thin slices of beef that is coated in an thin egg based batter and lightly fried. Ahhhh, talk about some tender juicy pieces of meat! There was a light soy dipping sauce on the side for some more flavor. 

Aloha Chicken $12
I had a hard time deciding if this was my favorite, but it's a close second! First of all, it's soooo tender it just melts in your mouth. You really taste the sauteed green onions and hints of ginger throughout each bite. 

Spicy Cheese Bulgogi $12
Hellooooo, deliciousness. No really, I don't normally eat much of any dairy but I really enjoyed how the mild cheese complimented the very flavorful bulgogi! 

Fried Chicken Wings $12
These came out pretty basic, but wait... the korean spicy paste that you dip with it - is addictive. I've tried many korean spicy pastes, but this one was different and more spicy! The cabbage mixture in the middle felt a little out of place - some kind of salad with ketchup?

Chicken Cutlet (Katsu) $15
These came out fresh and hot! I really liked how crispy the batter was against the tender chicken. 

La Kalbi $15 - Bulgogi $10
These were your classic dishes you can find at almost any korean influenced restaurant. All were marinated and seasoned very flavorful. No compliants here. 

Stir Fry Chicken Gizzards $12
This would be the first time for me to have gizzards stir-fried and I didn't hate it. The pieces were just as tender as all the other dishes we had. 

Spicy Seafood Ramen $6
The broth was more like a really light miso broth. It was okay. 

Chamisul Grapefruit (Soju) $11
This was soooo tasty - sweet and light! This has to be one of my favorite soju flavor thus far. 

There wasn't much I did not like about this place except for the kimchi being our only banchan (side dish). The concept is gastropub so I'm assuming that could be the reason why. Besides the food - let's talk about service. Our waiter was beyond attentive and friendly. She made us feel very at home and said we could stay as long as we would like. Their late night closing time is 4 a.m. and they don't try to push you out like most places would. We found this place on yelp and gave it a try. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good grub!",ADqhnlIqujlHld9l2b4sHg,1,2,5,S8TyIp8-gk7-eAWmGOf6tg

2956062,2017-11-21,8,PYoGpgAUDgT6OMxD_fe79g,"This place has incredible, nostalgic Korean food. There's so many items here I don't even know the direct English translations for so I'll just describe them as best I can. Hon Pocha focuses on featuring food that's lesser known such as the aggujjim, dakbal and meatjun. 

This is one of the few places that sells aggujjim if you're into that. What the hell is that you say?? It's 'braised spicy angler', according to Google but I'd describe it as spicy monkfish. If you've never had monkfish before the texture is similar to catfish. Be careful because it's commonly served with the bones intact but it's very easy to eat around it and dispose of it properly.

The dakbal is literally chicken feet and it's served in spicy seasoning sauce. I'm not a huge fan of dakbal because the meat is pretty scarce. However it is pretty good considering how flavorful the seasoning is. Not my first choice but not entirely bad either!

The meatjun, which is similar to Korean pancake (pajun), is delicious. It's a safe bet if the other two dishes sound a little too crazy for you. It has a thin layer of batter on the outside and tasty meat in the inside. Can't recall what type of meat but I want to say beef.

They didn't have their liquor license when I went there but the owner did mention they will carry all popular Korean alcohol such as soju, makgoeli (rice-based) and bokbunja (berry-based wine).

The interior is dark and dimmly lit, which is perfect for some late-night drinking and fun. It certainly has that vibe to be a go-to hang out spot for me, once they serve alcohol and finish up the decorating. It felt a little empty in there.

Will definitely return around December for a follow-up meal.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,26,12,5,ylXbLMZHXO9tSAGadJLmuQ

Service was excellent, and she offered me extra kimchi. Who could turn that down? 
Now.. for the food. All I can say is wow! The portions were huge, and full of flavor.  The meal is accompanied with potato salad, kimchi, and another house salad..hence the huge portion. The bulgogi has just the right amount of onions, and it's crazy good. Make sure to try that out.

We had such high hopes because of all the positive reviews. We came to find out that what more than half of previous review raved about (combination special) has been discontinued - even though those reviews were only 2, 3 weeks old.
Nevertheless, we decided to give it a fresh view.

Service: We ordered bulgogi and fried chicken wings. 
It took close to 40 minutes for us to get our fried chicken. There was only 1 other party sitting there. Mind you this was about 30 minutes after the bulgogi came out. We got so irritated to the point that we wanted to just cancel the order. 
We also didn't receive the warm tea like another reviewer stated. 

Food: It was disappointing. Bulgogi meat was HARD. As if I was chewing a rubber band. But rice was good. Fried chicken was worse than the ones you can get from Albertsons. The ones from Q karaoke was 100 times better. 

At least the server was OK, and was apologetic that the chicken took long time to come out.

The chicken was very tasty and had texture, with perfect accompaniments of sweet potato/macaroni salad and cole slaw. Bossam was also on point, paired with kimchi on the more fermented/tangy side.

Despite the edgy, dark ambience -- they were going for gastropub -- this place serves up simple, well-made Korean dishes.

This is my first time trying here and was excited based on pics and review on yelp. Went in and ordered take out so this review is based only on their food.

First, they don't have japchae, 2nd everything is ala carte no special plates or whatever is depicted on here.

Ordered bulgogi $10, and meat Jun $10. See pic i took, no rice comes in the plates, or any sides. They were kind enough to give me a small side of rice? And I had to ask side of kimchee which she kindly said ""ok I won't charge you"" hmmm most korean eateries I know you get kimchee for free, you also get veggies, salad and a soup for free. So not sure why this place does it like this. 

Flavor was even more disappointing, both the meat jun and the bulgogi was dry and tasteless, even the dipping sauce for the meat jun tasted like straight soy sauce. No body finished a plate of food. The best thing was the steamed rice, but how can you mess that up?

- Pleasantly surprised by how much meat/food was included and how tender and tasty the meats were.  I (attempt to) do Paleo but the potato salad was too good to forego and I wanted to eat more of their delish white rice (only had a couple spoonfuls, thankfully the meats were plenty filling). 
- The Smith's Supermarket plaza Hon Pocha is located in has seen lots of mom & pop Asian eateries come and go since 2010 when I first started going there.

The Meat Jun and aloha chicken were bomb. The udon is a bit spicy. They do provide Korean spices upon dead like doenjang and kimchee. Many of the patrons were Korean speaking Koreans so the place had an implications of approval by the local Korean community. 

Overall bomb food for late night munchies.",zcEaP5pVeDEjVZPXXHH6bA,0,1,5,c-eqtjXm3c2CQ6eXk8S0wg

Also when he took my order he didn't write anything down and i ordered 4 items and a bottle of rice wine for the table and i already knew he was going to forget because he didn't write anything down. Sure enough i watched him punch in the order then he sits down and starts texting on his phone and 10 mins go by and no drinks until i flagged him down to remind him.",RVBhvRfflhkasj1lE3NLWw,1,0,2,h5P2tIawmpfEn7bdK4pVqg

Spicy chicken feet - yums. We actually got this both times (came with same friend both time). I like it especially compared to the crappy dim sum ones. $14 My sister prefers the mushy chicken feet but I prefer the texture more firm. 

Enjoyed the fried chicken lunch combo we got last time. Came for dinner the second time. 

Fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce $15 this was surprisingly very good! I love this. I will probably get this every time now. It's boneless chicken. 

Spicy pork cartilage $12 this was harder than expected so expect lots of hard chewing if you get it. 

I hope to come back soon to try other stuff. Definitely want to try the fried chicken gizzard and possibly the meat jun in a future visit. :0)",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,0,2,4,AlWA6vzT6GhVCxeHBJIwCg
