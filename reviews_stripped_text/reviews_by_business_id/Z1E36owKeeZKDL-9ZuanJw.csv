4062,2014-04-11,2,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"We visit numerous times and I finally decided to write my review.  Atmosphere is like a small family restaurant,  low-key and relaxed.  As a family of 3 we usually do a 3 combo meal (2 orders of spare ribs and 1 order beef brisket and the 2 sides baked beans and potato salad). Never fails that the spare ribs are always soft and easily fall off the bone.  The meat is so tender and flavorful perfect for me.  My husband and son love sauce and will usually add more barbecue or hot sauce for themselves. The beef brisket is always tender and never chewy where you can't get it down. This usually fills us up,  if we have a bigger appetite we might order more beef brisket or the barbecue chicken.  Sometimes they have special sides like the dirty rice which my family love. We usually visit on Sundays for some barbecue and Ricky is always there to help take care of us.",3Pv_rjPLE7p6mALjtKKyDg,3,1,5,i6ROnMHNNNxCUpelGjFN_A

This thing was so small it looked like a slider baby! My wife ordered a coffee, which was almost $3.00. When she was half way done, the waiter asked if she would like a refill. So I'm thinking good service.....When I got the bill, he charged us for 2 coffees. When I asked about it, I was told it was policy to charge for refills!! Ya right! I didn't pay it. I will never go there again. Stay away unless you want to be overcharged.",R9R84H5it7Vnm3Pd3-wP2Q,0,0,1,awVEEv3mIdJ3A9uQHgGqWQ
32862,2013-02-13,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"Tried this place for takeout once and deemed it was not half bad. Dined in the restaurant tonight and this is my take:

The restaurant atmosphere was simple, clean, and very relaxed. Almost like an order-at-the-counter-then-seat-yourself kind of place. There was indeed table service albeit not the friendliest, but also not bad. BF and I decided to share the full rack of baby backs plus two sides: beans and potato salad. Everything came out in speedy time (there were maybe 3 other tables of people) and was warm, but let me tell you, this is not a place that concerns themselves with presentation. Everything was served in single use paper or plastic containers - the sides even had lids on them! Not a big deal but almost made me wonder, ""What did we get ourselves into?"". Aesthetics aside everything was good. I thought the potato salad was a nice consistency and balanced, very complimentary to the BBQ. The beans were basic and enjoyable. The ribs came out barely wet but extra sauce was offered immediately. Once sauced up to my liking we dug in and were very pleased. Great taste, extremely meaty, and very tender. My only complaint is that there are little bits of bone and gristle to be picked out but that's sort of expected in place like this. The cornbread that came with the meal left much to be desired which is kind of surprising for a rib place. Overall, for the price we paid we were well-fed and our rib craving was satisfied. We even took about half the rack home. Would definitely return and recommend this place to friends. 

TIP: we used the Yelp $10 for $20 so we only ended up paying $6 (plus tip). There were tons of specials listed, too, like 2 for 1 Tuesday lunches so that makes this place even more of a bargain.",h7x-uZWE945gnJMC0Ynf8A,1,0,4,ADdebzDPayaE6H6lQ5bPDg
66441,2012-06-26,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"We found out about this place when Groupon offered a $14 credit for $7.  We like BBQ and the place is pretty close to home.  Well the service was slow slow slow, the order was wrong on the first few attempts by the two young servers who apparently were not communicating with each other, and when we finally got all the overpriced food we ordered, it was mediocre to bad.

The final insult was when the 16-year-old girl running the place ripped us off.  She refused to accept the full amount of our $14 Groupon, claiming that because we had ordered one of the ""daily specials"", that she could only give us a $10 credit instead of the full $14 face amount.  Apparently she was well-trained at a young age to steal form the customers, because when I objected and tried to explain to her that she was violating the Groupon policy by not honoring the full amount of the Groupon,  she claimed that's how she did it for ""all Groupon customers"".  I guess I was the first one to speak up.

I asked to talk to the owner, but the girl said that she could not reach him.  So we took back the $4 tip we were going to leave and broke even, but left with a bad taste in our mouths, both literally and figuratively!

Our suggestion:  DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT EATING AT THIS AWFUL PLACE!!!  Head to Famous Dave's BBQ instead-- cheaper, with much better food, service, and atmosphere!",wFlIk9A0pmsA_TYnmO4n8w,6,2,1,s7ZhZrMv2mkjxaIgb4BGBw

Didn't think much of it, the service (at the beginning) seemed on top of it but once she placed our food down we never saw her again! Everyones drink was empty and I had to call a different waitress to get us the bill.. 

Let's talk about the food. I had pull pork sandwich with sweet potato fries I can say it was good (8.99). My husband had brisket and it was horrible! It tasted like lunch meat and was just smothered in this sour BBQ sauce... (recommendation- smoke your brisket) it was 12.99 and the portion was so small. (not worth it) My daughter had two beef ribs that didn't even have enough meat on it AND was too spicy for a 6 yr old to eat! I tasted it and couldn't eat it. Why would they put that on the kids menu and not specify that their BBQ sauce is spicy?! 

We obviously couldn't tell our concern to our waitress because we never saw her again! This place is ridiculous and I wouldn't recommend it at all!!",FQIvO3tg-pe4y9wkHVEnwQ,2,1,1,qQaYn45SAeasBTVYGxJq9A

Tender, good barbque sauce (but not enough of it - when I was done eating the waitress said that she shoulda/coulda brought extra sauce).   First time I really enjoyed myself.  Second time I felt gyped - a whole rack of ribs and hardly any meat on them.   The waitress tried to warn me.  She said that sometimes the supplier brought ribs without too much meat and this was one of those days, but I figured how little meat can there be on 8 ribs?  The answer was - about 4 ribs worth of meat on 8 ribs - half of each bone had no meat at all.    And what's with the plastic forks and knives?  The waitresses are very nice and helpful but it didn't make up for the small portions.",B3tQ-TJ6Ca_AxKn15VAEEA,0,0,3,AHTY2pORlOzZFyrKoMFkTQ

We sat down and took forever to get drinks. Waitress took our order and then another waitress came by as our waitress must have been new and didn't know what we wanted. I was thinking it was going to all come out wrong. The food came and WHOA! The best brisket I have found in Vegas! The sweet potatoes were perfect, the ribs fell right off the bone in tenderness. Mac and cheese was boring and dry, hoping grandmas Mac will improve. The manager came by and suggested dessert, which we took home after being so full. It hit the spot later that night! Food is absolutely worth the strange atmosphere and ambiance.

188835,2011-08-23,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"I've been going to TCs since they opened and I tasted their pulled pork for the first time like 6 years ago or whenever it was. They have some good bbq and sides and pretty decent prices.  

The pulled pork is the main event here for me, although I confess during the whole span I've never tried the ribs. I was just never a huge fan of ribs in general. The brisket is well cooked and the links are nice and spicy. They have rib tips which I've had and they are very good and at 8.99 for a plate of them with 2 sides and cornbread, it's honestly almost too much to finish. They also have chicken and waffles, and their waffles are seriously good eats.  The sides are plentiful and they have different ones each day. I always get the fried cabbage when it's on the menu because its delicious, and the macNcheese is not bad either. The deserts are all homemade and the ones that I've tried are good. They had this oreo pie that is to die for, but the last few times I've visited it's not been there =(  Also theres kool aid on the drink menu, its like 1.50 or so for a giant cup with refills. Purple please. Oh yes.  

I've never had a problem with the service, though my visits are like 70% takeout, 30% dine in probably. The girls that work there are nice and the chef has come out to greet once or twice. It's very friendly and  inviting atmosphere in the dining room, so I would recommend at least one visit to see if you enjoy it as much as I do.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,1,1,4,3WzwbnNAnHjWORc41hB5dw

I ordered the 3 meat- 2 sides combo. 1/4 order of spareribs, pulled pork, and hot links. Sides was baked beans and mac. & cheese, with the corn bread and kool-aide. Plus sharing   
Taste wise it was pretty good, not too bad. The meat was tender, good  seasoning, the ribs and pulled pork was ok, but hot links were so-so. The sides was over cooked a bit, with the corn bread cold, bland,  and served without butter. 
Didn't have a spicy BBQ sauce option, but they did have plenty of hot sauce on the table.

I thought the price was reasonable, we ordered the family platter, and you get so much  food for 45 could easily feed 4-5 people maybe even six. The sweet ice tea is really sweet, and you can tell its homemade, so it tasted that much better to me. My husband liked his brisket thinly sliced so it's a matter of preference, their brisket is sliced thin.  The service staff was friendly and perfect. I probably won't come in the restaurant to eat again, but I will definitely order for pick up because all that food you really need to lay down or kick back on a couch. We tried the pork links, baby back ribs, pulled pork and BBQ brisket with sides of fried okra, macaroni and cheese, SAMs baked beans and collard greens and the meal also came with 4 corn breads which were soft and
Moist... I saw a review that said they were
Dry and I didn't think the corn muffins were dry at all, it could of been just one of
Those off  days but I felt all food was homemade....

Because we wanted to try several things, we just ordered the family special to get four meats & three sides with the intention of taking home the leftovers for another meal. We choose brisket, chicken, ribs & rib tips. For sides we chose potato salad, baked beans, & fried okra. You already get French fries with the family deal.

We tried this place twice before- this is our 3rd time. Never wrote reviews b/c we hoped we were just experiencing one of their ""off days"". 
Reason for my rating : Too inconsistent and doesn't taste like ""Soul"" food. 

We ordered a Full Slab of ribs twice - received 7- 8 ribs both times. For those that know about ribs, know how many is a slab... Not sure what they're doing but either way I should AT LEAST get 10 ribs... Don't just completely insult my intelligence!

The ribs are either tender and meaty on some days or fatty and chewy on others. I don't like the inconsistency. 

Um next, the corn bread- it cries for milk and sugar -tastes like airy cornmeal and water...

Potato salad- The first time was pretty good- which is why we ordered it for the 2nd time but it was too chunky. Then ordered again for a 3rd time just to make sure the 2nd time wasn't a mistake and it again was too chunky. I'm talking too chunky like I had to chop 1 piece of a potato into 3 smaller pieces. 
Which one is it, chunky or nah?

The Mac and cheese tasted like like a doctored up box of Velvetta Mac and cheese. 

Again this food is classified under ""Soul Food"".

Maybe sell grilled steaks and burgers and become an all American restaurant b/c your sides aren't good. You can't call it Soul Food just because you sell Mac and cheese, collards greens and corn bread. Soul Food is apart of culture just like Mediterranean or Asian cuisine.

She said she loves this place because their ribs are oh so fall-off-the-bone good.  I couldn't wait to try it!  A small place, located in a strip mall on the corner of DI and Durango, I thought I was in for some good barbecue, and quite possibly some great ribs!  Upon entering, I noticed a smell...not the smell of sticky/smoky barbecue, but the generic smell of all-purpose cleaner.  No biggie, I thought, at least the place was clean!  I order from the photocopied pink paper menu and was excited to see that they serve Kool-Aid as one of their beverages.  ""Now THAT's authentic!"" I thought.  I was even more excited.  I ordered the full rack of baby backs, an order of brisket, the pulled pork, fried okra, the beans, greens, and donut bread pudding. Hey, I was hungry, and I was planning on taking most of it home!

What a disappointment.  The ribs were NOT barbecued.  It had no smoke flavor and no smoke ring.  Ditto on the brisket.  Ditto on the pulled pork.  Yes, all the meat was tender, but tasted like boiled meat slathered in sauce.  The beans were...well, beans.  The greens were almost too salty to eat.  The donut bread pudding was crusty and stale around the edges and tasted like it was a couple days old.  The best thing I had there was the fried okra and the Kool-Aid.

The employees are cheerfully nice, restrooms were immaculate, and the food was edible but not enjoyable.  I will never willingly go back.  If I am forced, I will just get the fried okra and Kool-Aid.  But don't let my strong opinion stop you from trying it out yourself.  You just might like it there, as my friend does.  But, before you consider going to T. C.'s Rib Crib, I would recommend you consider the following:

-Do you love the flavor and tenderness of meats that have been slowly smoked for hours at low temperatures?  If so, don't go to T. C.'s Rib Crib!

-Do you like your ""barbecue"" to taste like it was made by boiling and/or pressure cooking the meat until tender, slathering barbeque sauce over it, and slapping it on the grill a few times to caramelize the sauce?

If they're serving your food on fine china they're doing it wrong.

I recommend their Spare ribs, mac n cheese (from scratch) and sweet potato fries. The ribs are well smoked and not over sauced. They fall off the bone and the portions on generous for the price. Pulled pork is also good and the brisket is ok, I'm not a brisket fan to begin with though. If you have a craving for sweet tea this is also the place to go.  It reminds me of the south and its made fresh there daily.

First, what kind of bbq restaurant doesn't smell like bbq when you come in?
This should have been a red flag and indication to run, but we still ordered and sure enough, the 'bbq"" just was cooked meat (tried rib tips[extremly old and dry], whole chicken, chicken wings, and pulled chicken [found bones]) with bbq sauce on it.
The side dishes were terrible and lacked flavor. This place tried to have soul food, but it was greatly apparent that they really don't know how to cook, let alone make soul food.

Upon the return visit, we tried catfish and it was so terrible that I couldn't even finish one whole piece. The ""catfish fillets"" were obviously pre-battered and precooked (where the person in the back just dumped them in the oil) because there was a lack of seasoning, the pieces were cookie-cutter shape, and they were so dark from re-frying them.

The crazy thing is that some dude said that everything was fine.

742134,2015-02-07,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"First off, I have eaten Texas-Oklahoma ""Real Deal"" barbecue for 30+ years.

Barbecue to different people across the USA undoubtably means different expectations.

I like meats fresh off the smoker grill, meats with a smoke ring and ribs with meat that melts in your mouth,standing alone on the house seasonings. 
This means an ON-SITE smoker/pit grill.

If barbecue is served heavily sauced, something is being hidden. Usually dry overcooked or re-heated leftovers.

Reviews show heavily sauced product here.
We never got to the point of seeing their product.

We went with another couple Thursday late morning, we all had their coupon special purchased in advance.

We were seated by a nice teen-age girl, who took our drink order and gave us napkins and flimsy plastic-ware forks and knives.

I asked her if they cooked on site, she said ""yes sir"".
 
I smelled ZERO barbecue smoke in the immediate outside or interior area, it is in a small location in a strip center.

Strip centers, to my knowledge,for the most part, do not allow pit barbecue cooking for obvious reasons, fire risk, especially here in Vegas with summer tinder dry conditions.

We made our decisions and asked about our coupons, the owner appeared and said we could not use the discount coupons....we purchased these coupons she generated and could not use them.

After quizzing her as to why, since she authorized them, she had no real answer.

 
She said we could not, and proceeded to rudely call us cheap for trying to use them.

At this point we simply got up and left.


TC'S might have been a good barbecue place at their former location, where they received some  local popularity.

I sense now, it is under new misguided management trying to live off past goodwill and is in a downward spiral....",RoyxaHCR4cFqiyRporlX4w,2,1,1,jf5JZ5O1qfpYNFGdmDbCZA

The chicken and sides were AMAZING!!  4 stars because I wasn't forced to order Chinese or Thai (which is one step up from cracking a can of soup and eating it cold) but if it wasn't for the delivery factor I would have given 2.

The sauce wasn't anything to write home about.   If their ribs are outstanding, I'd never know, but if they're willing to call the stuff I ordered barbecue, then they are really missing the point.

Maybe I'm a barbecue snob, but it's really got to be smoked to be called barbecue, doesn't it?  I think the closest that the meat I was served got to being smoked was second-hand from the guy lighting his Marlboro out in front when I pulled out.

  The sides were the best things there: dirty rice had a nice rue to it, black-eyed peas were spot-on, mac and cheese was wonderfully cheesy, the baked beans were the perfect balance of smoke and sweet.  The corn bread, however, disappointed and seemed like it was made straight from a powder you'd buy at a store.  Overall, though, the portions are well-proportioned, so you get a good bang for your buck, especially if you use the Yelp discount special.
  Another small thing that happened that kinda put me off a little was how they served the food: the waitress brought it out, one dish at a time, with significant time differences between the plates.  So two people in our party got their food...followed by another person getting their food....and then another.....and then the final person got theirs even later than the others.

TCs boasts an array or beef, chicken and pork done in the Louisiana style, and a lot of southern staples as sides. They even have decent greens, which is so hard to find in Vegas.
Aside from the food itself, the sweet tea will give you diabetes on the spot, which means its accurate to real southern sweet tea for those native west coasters who don't know. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere really strongly evokes the southern style of community and connection.

Along comes TC's.  Their regular menu and breakfast menu elicits BBQ legitimacy, with Chicken, Ribs (spare ribs, baby backs & beef ribs), rib tips, and pull pork (any of these meats available in their omelets).

This being my first dining experience at TC's, I had to go with the three meat combo with 2 sides and cornbread in order to get a good feel of their BBQ.  My choices: Rib Tips, Baby Back Ribs, & Pulled Pork; Mac 'n' cheese & Fried Cabbage.

To my understanding, this is a family owned and run business and it showed from the extremely friendly and personable service to some of the family members playing a board game in the dining room because it was slow.

The rib tips were excellent as was the fried cabbage.  The pull pork was serviceable after adding a little more BBQ sauce.  The ribs however were dry and extremely charred.  TC's BBQ sauce is extremely sweet and lacking any kind of spice, but because that's not my cup of tea doesn't mean you won't like it.  The mac 'n' cheese was gritty and somewhat less than warm and the cornbread could definitely be categorized as stale.

All-in-all, I've rated TC's with three stars based on the service, ""BBQ restaurant"" feel, and my craving to have more rib tips and fried cabbage.  As for rating a ""Rib Crib"" for their Ribs, well that would be thumbs down.",SRME9m7Dol6oO1J0BDy57w,1,0,3,zrvfJQ7uHmJELVbtUieREQ

The meats are always delicious, the mac and cheese is phenomenal, and don't forget to ask about their daily dessert for only a dollar (I'm a fan of the banana pudding). I also like the fried okra. The quarter chicken lunch special with all white meat is only $5.99 and PLENTY of food. Regular lunch specials (entree and side) are $4.99 before 3pm any day and on Tuesdays lunch specials are 2 for 1. Can't beat feeding two people for five bucks anywhere, especially with food like this. If youre feeling adventurous, I also recommend the chicken and waffles. The owners (husband and wife) are wonderful, and if they are there during your visit, don't miss out on a conversation with them. 

Overall, this place is small, family run, and delicious. Like I said, there are sometimes hiccups with the wait staff, but you'd be happy you came and would be doing everyone a favor by avoiding Famous Dave's.",vgfVURzT_PIBixtegEBHLw,0,0,5,dejhkYMbOUWbzYuNwq6KoQ

When some place claims to be a BBQ restaurant, smokiness and BBQ is the first thing you should smell. That was the first red flag. Secondly, we ordered barbecue wings and were served regular wings with barbecue sauce on it. Third most terrible thing was the catfish. The fish fillets were identical in shape and size, I could immediately tell it was from the freezer! The blan fish lacked simple seasons like salt and pepper, to say the least.

The first is to replace the front door mat. It's to shreds and 10 bucks would replace it creating a far better first impression. When I saw this I was reluctant to walk in.
Clean the windows and door daily. Dirty door dirty food?
Have staff wear clean uniforms. Residue on aprons is not appetizing.

1004221,2011-01-14,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"There are a few places in Las Vegas, and elsewhere, that once it crosses your mind it's all over. You must have it. Nothing will stop you. TC's Rib Crib is one of those places. A quaint BBQ joint, you can eat there or grab some take out, but given the treat-you-like-family service I recommend staying for a bit. I once ate there solo and a table of elderly customers nearby was laughing so hard it was contagious and I started laughing with them. That's the kind of behavior this food incites. Laughing with complete strangers.

It sounds cliché but you can't go wrong on the menu. A combo plate for your first time visit is probably best, from there you can come back weekly, daily, hourly for what you deem your favorite. I am loyal to the pulled pork (sometimes chicken) plate with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. I'm starving just writing this. It's 10:30am. The gargantuan drinks will ensure you are far from parched, and though I'm not wild about sweet tea others have reported to me it's just like what you get in the south. 

The desserts are also great, provided you can even shove anything else into your stomach due to the hearty portions. Sweet potato pie, pecan pie...all fabulous and available to purchase in full pie form for holidays or special occasions. 

 Make it a point to stop by TC's Rib Crib. It will absolutely scratch your BBQ itch.",B7mqXzrSFKM_Wff2tbBagw,1,1,5,PPYAmFkmx3jCizP-NklkXQ

Very welcoming, clean and the workers were friendly.  The location was hidden from view with other restaurants in from of the actual TC's Rib Crib. As you eat, enjoyable R&B music sooths you while you eat really good cooking. My eldest son ordered a half rack of pork baby back ribs and licked everymeal of the bone like it was butter.... Delicious. My younger son orded pancakes and bacon which was fulling and huge portions that he couldn't finish, but boxed it up, and ate it all up later. He also ordered the Kool Aid which he couldn't put down.... Awesome!  As for me, I ordered the waffles and chicken.... It was the Bumb!!!! Three fried chicken wings which were huge including a plate size waffle to die for! Best fried chicken in the valley!!! 

The only draw back was I couldn't find the restaurant right away cause it was being blocked by another restaurant.

1098528,2012-03-15,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"My wife and kids accompanied me to TC's rib crib for a family outing there and it was the first time any of us have ever eaten there. We were going because a co-worker of my wife suggested it. Please BEWARE though that the address on some of these sites is WRONG and if you go to the OLD location there's nothing there! It took us 15 mins and we had to find that out the hard way.

We ordered the following:
Mac-n-cheese: GREAT! Their own recipe and it was awesome! It's really hard to find homemade macaroni and they BY FAR have THE BEST! And this is coming from people who have had mac a hundred different ways!

Mild Links: I can't remember which MEAT it was, but different meats have different heat factors, chicken being the most mild, so it had to have been pork or beef. Anyway, they were GREAT also as compared to other links from other places. VERY FILLING too!

Beef Brisket: Not the best. The BEST I've had would be at Famous Dave's BBQ. But this place would be 2nd best and I've had it at several places. Very tasty and filling.

Baked Beans: Good, but nothing to write home about.

Cornbread: Good, but nothing to write home about. Rather small compared to what other places give you. This was a small sweet muffin style

Mini-Burgers: My daughter had this, it looked filling but she still said she was hungry afterwards. Keep in mind she's a very hungry girl.

Donut Style Bread Pudding: The most disappointing of all because it can't REALLY be considered bread pudding. I love bread pudding so I know what GOOD bread pudding is. Famous Dave's has the #1 BEST, Green Valley Ranch Buffet has the 2nd best. This place literally gives you a itty bitty little plastic thing with some weird bread stuff covered in that thick nasty white goo you see on top of honey buns from 7-11. And that's EXACTLY what it tasted like, a 7-11 Honey Bun. What was more disturbing was it was prepackaged and the waitress asked me if I wanted it heated up, meaning it was put in a microwave. NOT GOOD. They should SERIOUSLY not even offer bread pudding if it isn't home made. What a shame.

Sweet Tea: Good, one of few places that have it and it was LIPTON sweet tea. Just like I grew up on and make at home. But I would expect an AUTHENTIC soul food restaurant to have something more special. The amount (as far as cup size) was so much that I never needed a refill so that was good too.

One weird thing to complain about... While my KIDS were there, 2 white bikers came in and sat down to eat and they were cussing really loud the entire time. Usually I wouldn't mind because they are adults and they can do what they want. I even cuss in front of my kids at home and they know THEY aren't allowed to do the same. But the fact that those guys would cuss loudly in a restaurant with kids seemed rude, obnoxious, and ill-mannered. Not the restaurants fault but I didn't see any of the employee's responding to the situation. If I were the owner or manager I would have NICELY reminded them that ""This is a business and a family establishment"" and asked them to please stopp cursing because of the kids.",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,3,0,5,XuGgoRe6jHfG-pKMdfljzw

I believe the mixed reviews have alot to do with the inconsistency in freshness that I've sometimes experienced here myself. I think the time of day and week you happen to order or dine in has alot to do with it here, as it can be hit or miss in that department. I have ordered when the food was hot off the grill and the meat was melting off the bones. I've also ordered when the ribs were not just made and the sides definitely appeared to be reheated. There is a huge difference but chalked it up to coming during a rather vacant time of day. This is a small family business and I think if you are smart about when you order or arrive during a fairly busy time, you will get your food alot fresher. I order around dinner time closer to weekends when there's a line out the door and I'm never disappointed. I recommend the spare ribs, mac n cheese and potato salad is good.

very simple looking place but comfortable.  Appears to be a family run place - i like that.  ordered the spare ribs w/ cole slaw - $7.

I give TC the cole slaw edge - but just a slim edge.  

The ribs - my guess, they boil first then grill them - the ribs were soggy.  They get props for the bbq sauce - nice bite, flavor.  but the ribs bothered me.

Me and my mom ordered the 3 meat treat. We got beef tips, hot links, 1/4 slab spare ribs with sweet potato fries and collard greens as the sides. 

The hot links could have been a bit more tender, but were delicious on the other hand. Beef tips tasted good, even though they were essentially small steak pieces. LOVED the ribs, they were tender and practically fell off the bone. The collard greens were quite tasty and the sweet potato fries had a perfect ratio of sweetness and typical french fry flavor. 

The atmosphere is pretty interesting. It's slightly hole in the wall-ish but clean. I loved the pictures on the wall, it gave the place a VERY homey feel, the service is pretty homey as well. Another nice thing to note are the names of many of the dishes, which are supposedly named after members of TC's family.

1462541,2013-07-25,3,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"And to think someone asked me to reconsider my trip to TC's and head over to Famous Dave's.  What a sucker.

TC's southern BBQ delivered especially at such an affordable price.  The offered  $10 for $20 deal was worth up, but keep in mind.. Their prices are super reasonable, so dessert would be in order to make this deal worth the while.

My beau and I ordered the Ribs, chicken wings, sweet potato fries and red beans and rice with cornbread on the side.  The Ribs fell off the bone as they should.  Delicious!  Ribs are typically the deciding factor for me when it comes to a BBQ joint winning.  They delivered!  Chicken wings were spicy and overcooked (per my request) perfectly.  Red Beans and Rice and Sweet Potato Fries weren't as tasty as anticipated, but I'm a picky southerner, so TC's probably didn't stand a chance before I even walked through the door in that arena.  The rice was a little under-cooked and tasted as if it came from a box.  The sweet potato fries were missing the whole sweet factor.  Just not great, albeit I gladly wolfed them down!

This place is very casual, small and made me feel like I was in DC/NOLA all over again.  I was there to get my greasy needs met, and they accomplished that and then some.  Also, the servings are decent, so I had some wings to go for a late night feast.  The service was nice as well.  However, I noticed they only had one server doing all the seating and serving, and even though it was quick for my visit, I would recommend a little patience.. she only has two hands, people.

Oh, and they had kool-aid!  Kool-aid!  I used to involuntarily drink that sugary mess in college due to lack of funds, so it was fun to drink some a few years later!  Maybe a wee bit too sugary to my liking.  I bet the kiddies would beg to differ.",0uo7LHVMFaDf1PkcGZprNg,3,1,4,BAjpuZNYJr13_8IfSdxSwA

What in the world is this it the worst BBQ we ever had and my boys eat anything. The pork ribs was boiled then grill mark with a George Forman grill  with poor quality spare ribs that was all fat wow .and the chicken was not fresh smell and taste spoiled you can tell they made it days ago and put it in the microwave to reheat it on top of that they put my thin slice so call beef brisket next to my spoiled chicken and the liquid from the chicken spreadedover to the thin slice roast beef (brisket) and made that taste spoil nasty I had to throw both of them away. If I didn't live so far from this place I would have drove back and got my money back plus my five dollar tip I gave. The beef ribs was so rubbery it snap back like a rubber band when i bit into it.very very disappointed.and there goes the sides wow the bake beans only thing was decent you could tell they made it from pork n beans and some molasses and BBQ sauce to give it a nicer taste.the greens oh!!! No"" I'm from the south and I never taste greens so sweet it had a hint of sugar in it wow who does that,and the mac n cheese so over cook and glumpy .the yams was over cook and so sweet u could barely eat it but my 8yr son ate it and i swear within 3mins after he ate it he shot to the bathroom to relieve what ran through him. Corn bread was bland and dry potato salad way to much miracle whip in it and the potatoes was slightly hard ,cold slaw was ok and the two dessert we got was the lemon cake and the Carmel cake I told my wife it was room temperature stuck in a see through glass case with no temperature gauge on it when she put it in the bag the frosting was all over the paper plate.so ppl who coming far away to eat at this place please take time to review other comments to see if it worth it trust me you won't be happy if you eat here beware what you eat real talk a good BBQ place has a smoker or a grill in the back this one doesn't u do the math.

1557504,2013-02-07,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"Upon entering TC's, the decor is very warm & inviting. We were the only people in the place on a Saturday morning.

We wanted to come for breakfast. There was no breakfast menu even though they are open for it? Not a big deal, but wanted to try a new breakfast joint.

Service was a bit slow for being an empty restaurant, but we were not in a hurry so it was not the end of the world.

Ordered a 3 meal combo & a cheeseburger.

Let me say the sweet tea might have been some of the worst ever. I personally despise Lipton & GMO tea. I always felt a sweet tea would come from a brand maybe made or big in the South? Maybe a better brand? 

The meal came... the cole slaw & mac & cheese were our sides. I will say this was some pretty great mac & cheese. The cole slaw was blended perfectly as well. The sides were better than our meats (brisket, pulled chicken, & rib tips).

Whether it was the brisket or the pulled chicken, something had a weird aftertaste to it. Not sure if it was the sauce or freezer burn. 

Cheeseburger was nothing special. Just a frozen patty fired up. Some meat probably purchased from Sysco Foods. A shame because a ground burger from Brisket would have been totally better. 

This is one of those rare moments where I felt bad for the struggling business. If I could nominate them for Restaurant:Impossible, I would. The decor is so nice and inviting to just have a dud in food.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,2,0,2,w2IAftjk-limbtYkkqdaWg

I have long since left that job, moved to a different part of town, and generally changed my diet to favor putting less sugar and refined things into my body. Then one day I got a job right down the street from their new location.

If they didn't use so much sugar, and they used grass-fed beef and pastured pork, they'd be a shoe-in for best bbq in town. But that isn't their fault, sugar is a part of bbq no matter where you go.

The pulled pork here is awesome. The brisket here is awesome. The ribs here are awesome. The sausages here are awesome. The rib tips are good but they used to be better, at some point they switched to doing them like everybody else with the tip of that cartilage still in them but they used to be just the meat. I miss the old way but the new way is still delicious.

This place was okay but not  really great.

The ribs were very overdone and bland. They needed a good rub to make them tastier, not just slather them in sauce.  The brisket was - how can I say it - just kind of weird.  We are used to slow smoked brisket and this looked and tasted like a rump roast that was cooked like a rump roast and sliced thin and had sauce dumped on it.  DH liked the potato salad. I swear the sweet potato fries (which are a staple in our house) were the frozen ones we buy at the grocers so, yep, they did taste just like home-made :)  The sauce is nothing spectacular - we are used to restaurants that have their own signature sauce but I didn't think there was anything spectacular about their sauce either.  We didn't try the pulled pork while we were there.

Take this from a guy who's experienced a lot of barbecue in his time...it's NOT good.  It ruined the pulled pork and beef brisket for me by completely overpowering it; however, the baby back ribs were ""okay"" (read: not fall-off-the-bone).  By the way, the brisket is sliced into very thin strips, which doesn't even make it taste like brisket.  What a waste of 20 bucks...

Maybe I shouldn't be writing this tonight because I'm in not the best of moods & sick but some of my taste buds still work. We had some serious highs here & some serious lows.

This is a little place and feels very cozy which I always appreciate. The art & signs on the walls are a great touch. The staff is very nice & and the prices are ok. The meat was great, nice pulled pork and chicken which come in the house BBQ sauce which is sweet with a little kick (this I enjoyed). The baby back ribs were very moist but they were really fatty and I am not a big fan of my meat surrounded by fat. This may sound bad but it's true. The sides we chose were onion rings (fantastic), Mac & cheese (bland :( ), sweet potato fries (awesome) and baked beans (bland). I'm always looking for some bacon, onions or sausage bits in baked beans. The sweet teas were the serious low tonight because it was like drinking straight sugar. We had to ask for some non sweet teas to find our balance. 

The highest point tonight was the incredible lemon cake. Very homemade and moist, sweet, tart with perfect frosting. The last bite was very memorable so I'm thrilled about that! 

Overall it was good and as mentioned we love home cooked meals and this felt like one. I'm sick today so my taste buds are off but I can still taste bold flavors.

For starters, service from the owner is dismal-stopped by last week to use my deal and he was arguing with another Groupon customer, loudly and unprofessionally. I wouldn't have gone back without my discount.

The meat here is of such low quality, it's embarrassing. The pulled pork was so shredded that it nearly looked ground and the only flavor came from the sauce. Ribs were mediocre, and for a place named after their ribs this is unacceptable- low quality, not particularly meaty or flavorful, and a bit too charred.

The brisket though. As a Texas girl, I know brisket about as well as I know my own grandmother. And I don't know what the hell they're serving here. Meat is not fresh and is cut so thinly that it appears to be prepackaged. Little to no flavor, this is not brisket. I was so, so disappointed.

We left more than half of our food on our plates, paid, and left. Owner was half asleep in a booth at the back of the dining room and did not address us at all, despite being the only customers and clearly having an issue with their product.

Don't go here- they don't care about their customers or their product. There's a reason they have a million discount deals up and NO customers. Barbecue sauce was tasty, but there's nothing here to put it on worth eating.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,25,7,1,kyL9TedgOcTqvQr8VlvRbw

I don't even really like potato salad so that means something. However, this place is known for ribs.... Not sides. I had high expectations for this place and I was rather disappointed esp since I was so happy to bring 6 others (parents, aunts, and uncles). $110 for the platters plus 4 sodas. More expensive for what it was worth. We didn't even get real plates. (Disposables and to go side containers)

Although I was not satisfied with the food, service was friendly and prompt.",fGRzUxh3oDdLbhkr1Lr8Cw,4,1,3,z1baVOlnnEIqgX651YeXvA

I LOVE that quote and love that it's written on the bottom of your receipt. I wouldn't know whether or not the ribs would take my heart, but I do know that the pulled pork sammie was pretty delish. 

I originally went because of The Desert Companion's ""DEALicious meals"" article. In it it said there was a $4.99 lunch special: a Jr. Sammie and a side, can't beat that! SO off I went, walking distance from my work, and FINALLY decided to try this ""World Famous"" BBQ.

When I walked into this establishment on a lovely Saturday afternoon I realized, UGH! Lunch specials are only for Monday-Friday. Oh well, I'm already here and the tiny little restaurant is very homey, sporting pictures of, what I hope is, TC's family. This sort of establishment always makes me want to come back to support, especially with the really friendly staff they have on hand.

I ordered, as I mentioned before, the Pulled Pork Sammie with ....deep fried jalapenos! Whoo-wee. I don't even like jalapenos, but I just HAD to try these.

My fellow diner ordered the brisket sammie and the sweet potato fries that everyone raves about.

We had them both ""home style,"" which meant it had some really good slaw on top.
The verdict:
My sammie: s'mazin'. I really enjoyed the sandwich and wouldn't mind coming back for the lunch meal and ordering the Jr. as this sammie is pretty filling.

The OTHER sammie: Not nearly as good as mine, it was a little tougher and less flavorful. 

I wouldn't have the sammies without the slaw, I believe it cost an extra 50 cents, but it's worth it.

The jalapenos: These little babies were pretty darn good. I wouldn't order them again though, jalapenos just aren't my thing.

Sweet potato fries: Ok, what's up with these? Everyone LOVES them....I think they tasted like straight oil and were a little under cooked, and old. Poo.

Over all, it was A-OK. I would totally return for the lunch menu...but that's probably it...Oh and to try the ribs....with a name like The Rib Crib...you just gotta try them....",v5xxch_TbSV9ZTxHkd6jHQ,1,1,3,sMxHFH_2nno9mvqM7ctr2A

2013533,2014-08-02,2,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"My husband and I snatched up a Yelp deal and headed in for dinner. 

We walked in at a weird moment where people were leaving with and other waiting on take-out orders while yet others were getting seated. We weren't yet aware that dine-in folks were seated so we stood for a bit until we caught on. 

The room smelled great. The walls were decorated with photos, articles, and art pieces that made the space comfortable and reflected the family ownership. The rest of the space is straightforward with seats, which I appreciate in a BBQ place. I don't know why, but overly decorated BBQ places are weird to me. Sidenote: the UCLA sticker in the window was not lost on us recent transplants from Los Angeles and Bruin alumni. 

Anyway, our server welcomed us and got our drinks. I don't know what it is with this city but, as usual, the refillable fountain drinks were Pepsi. However, it was nice to know that Coke products were available in cans (just not refillable). Being a human camel, I went with the refillable stuff. 

When we ordered, our server asked if we'd been in before and we said no. She very genuinely and excitedly welcome us and expressed her happiness about our first visit. That didn't go unnoticed. It was really sweet. 

It being Friday and me loving fish, I already knew I was ordering the daily special of fried catfish. I went with the 3 piece meal with two sides - fried okra and mac and cheese - with cornbread. 

Let me just say that the catfish was so on point that my husband and I ate the entire portion despite my promises to myself to save half for later. The fish was perfectly fried and seasoned; crisp and clean and in no way greasy or fishy. As I mentioned, we recently moved from LA. Our old apartment out there was close to many soul food options and this catfish was on par with many of our favorites. My heart was happy from this dish. 

The fried okra was also well cooked. I think it missed a sauce but the hot sauce at the table worked well. 

The mac and cheese was cheesy and thick though a tab bit on the colder side. Still, despite the temperature, it was a solid accompaniment to the entire shared meal.

My husband, and rib lover and pork enthusiast, went with the three-meat plate and upgraded to all the ribs available: 1/4 slab pork spare ribs, 1/4 rack pork baby back ribs, and 1/4 rack beef ribs. He selected greens and fries for his sides.

We're both from pork loving cultures and the ribs did not disappoint. They all had a lovely smokiness and tenderness. I usually favor pork ribs but, in this instance, I felt the beef ribs were the most outstanding. My husband  favored the baby back ribs. 

Being greedy, we tacked on an order of brisket . Also, Friday nights are usually cheat and date nights. Just saying. Don't judge. I'm capable of eating even more. 

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gms7IFEgYRSA-HioCsyGmg&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA

I was surprised at the thin slices of the brisket but I rather enjoyed it. It reminds me of Korean BBQ brisket, but with soul. It was fantastic stuffed into the accompanying cornbread. 

I felt the service was very attentive. We were checked in on just enough to feel catered to without feeling suffocated and I had no trouble getting refills. We had a few hiccups on the food (had to ask for the cornbread and brisket after everything else came out)  but that didn't really bother us. Actually, it made us laugh about how overzealous our order was. However, I will say I was disappointed we weren't offered dessert. I forgot what was on the menu but I probably would have gladly ordered something. 

The tab came out to $48 for 2 drinks, 3-meat all rib plate, catfish, 4 sides, and brisket a la carte. With the Yelp deal, that dropped down to $27. Tip and the original $10 to buy the deal brought the total back to $47, which I think was absolutely fair even without the deal. 

That all being said, I think 3.5-3.75 stars is on point and we look forward to returning soon. If I recall correctly, my husband plans on a full rack next time (I assume baby backs). If, for some reason I find myself off from work on a weekday, I will beeline here to check out the $4.99 lunch deals!",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,5,3,4,lnaaovTcLXKr2ZlswAfTNA

Rib tips were ok but very small amount. The pulled pork was mushy and soft yet dry at the same time. I liked the sauce, slightly spicy, but they didn't put much, and didn't give extra in our takeout box.

The mac and cheese was bland. The baked beans tasted like Bush's from the can. Plus they forgot our cornbread (which wasn't sweet at all) and had to go back in and ask for it. Overall, barely worth the $10 let alone the $20 for regular price.

Go to John Mull's in the NW instead, and get way WAY more food that's way WAY better for a couple bucks less.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,6,1,2,_errExmtpMSoN2I6nywx_w

This is genuine, home-made stuff, not some dry, commercialized crap from major chains.  Their recipe has been handed down for generations, so you know this is legit.  Juicy ribs that easily fall off the bone, and BBQ sauce to die for are just a couple of things that define TC's.

The sides tend to get overlooked, as they are just as good as the ribs.  The fried okra is the best.  And though I absolutely hate coleslaw, I can say with a straight face that I really like TC's.  I don't know what it is, but it is good.

Back in Myrtle Beach there was this restaurant that the Mayor of North Myrtle Beach opened. They never got your order right but it didn't matter. Whatever soul food you ended up with was amazing. This restaurant is like that too, but they get your order right every time. In fact, if you're getting to go, they'll open your boxes for you before you leave just to make sure you're happy. 

The ambiance is not fancy, but it's very clean and it's authentic as the food. You can feel the love that goes into the cooking and the down home decor. I purchased two specials... A rack of ribs and the beef tips. As expected, they were moist, juicy and flavorful. 

I am so pleased that this restaurant exists. The staff feels like a family. Everyone has been so kind and are eager to share their favorite recommendations. I was skeptical, but when they say their dessert is better than sex. Oh boy do they mean it! I absolutely will be back.",IamJ-OX89_P-i-xkknwpPA,9,11,5,WDWLUt7H7_F5Da6RSKobEw

I ordered the mac and cheese, fried okra, and sweet potato tots. The mac wasn't creamy, but it sure was cheesy! The okra was also good. I really liked the slightly sweet and flavorful barbecue sauce that they brought out to the table. The Arnold Palmer (iced tea and lemonade) tasted just right.

TC's has an unbelievable deal for lunch specials on Tuesday, when 2 people can eat for $4.99. They have different specials each day of the week, but this one really stood out.

I was checking out the display case full of desserts up front by the cashier, contemplating a slice of coconut cake for later, when something else caught my eye. Glazed donut bread pudding? Are you kidding me? I should have listened to the cook, who told me to get two orders. He knew what he was talking about. There were bits of peach, plump raisins, and walnuts under the donuts, and the whole thing was topped with cream cheese frosting. It's crazy. I bet it goes well with a cup of coffee.

I ordered the family meal deal which you get your choice of 4 different meats, 3 sides, 1 fried side, and corn bread or white bread. My choices were:
1.) Brisket - covered in bbq sauce that wasn't too tart or too sweet
2.) Rib tips - tender and covered with the same sauce
3.) Pork links - sliced in half with nice char marks. A bit salty though.
4.) Baby back ribs - so tender you don't need a knife.
5.) Baked beans - I am not normally a fan of beans but I enjoy this. It's a great compliment to the greens
6. Greens - very salty but good when combined with the beans
7.) Mac n cheese - could be cheesier but i like how the flavors are a bit mellow since you have the strong flavors from the bbq
8.) Fried okra - love these little bits of goodness
Finally, 9.) Corn bread - it should really be called mini corn muffins. My only complaint with these is that it's way too small. I love me some corn muffins.

The staff is very friendly and very professional. The food is pretty on point with good flavors and tenderness. Overall, this is my go to place for bbq in Vegas. Now all I got to do is go there for their fish fry",Qqvt9tENw_qvSdeDM3ifoQ,1,0,4,ek8FWZMPpJ0bDg50K5UpFA

2276905,2013-09-05,2,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"I was feeling the mood too try something new in my area of town. I know this place has won best of las vegas review journal awards although that was few years back. Since then the competition comes too barbeque has stepped up with new places on top of the established ones. So some ways going in it was going too be tough too stand out. I always always give any place benefit of open mind and like try new places get my own take on it. Really TC's Rib Crib never had any WOW factor too the food I tasted. It was average barbeque at best with average sides. Really even though this location is on my side of town would much rather drive farther too get more authentic barbeque on.

I ended up ordering the pulled pork (I always fail too get it sandwich style or forget) with choice of two sides and comes with cornbread. I settled on fried okra and mac/cheese for my sides. The amount of pulled pork they give you actually decent size for the price you pay. I wished it covered in more sauce. They ask you when food comes out if want more barbeque sauce. I did. The tables can dine inside none of them automatically have barbeque sauce as set condiments. I found odd considering it is barbeque joint? I not much fan of the barbeque sauce felt like it lacked depth, rather bland, and nice if had few options too choose from. The sides I did enjoy the fried okra!!!! Really just diced okra battered and fried. It nice golden brown, crispy on the outside, and nice hot and moist on the inside. The mac and cheese wished could have been more creamy and cheesy. It was ok. The cornbread was pretty good. Maybe I needed too the order the ribs but suppose save that for another visit...Maybe.

The service was good. They asked if wanted too dine in or take out. The gentlemen asked if wanted more barbeque sauce. Attentive. They have really cheap lunch special and great groupon deal going right now. It small place so can fill up fast if it gets busy. I went during weekday for dinner so only one in the restaurant.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,5,3,3,teyXMMtr6MAjFraHro1q1Q

2284854,2011-02-09,3,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"LOVE AT FIRST BITE... or so I thought.

A friend of mine keeps raving about how great this place is and how he would only get his BBQ fix in Vegas, and me being on my mission to find a BBQ joint I love, HAD to try this place.

It wasn't hard to find, which was good. It is a small place, with about 5 tables along one side and a larger table right in front and 2 tables outside. The service was great. The girls there was very nice and made sure we were taken care of.

The sides all seemed so good I wanted to try everything! But I didn't want to go overboard. Just figured if I liked it, I can always come back and try more. So me and my bf ordered a full slab of ribs (baby back) in the combo with mac n cheese and fried okra as our sides. They had waffled sweet potato fries that day and best believe I got that too!! (pictures posted). I was ready to wait the 20+ minute for the food as the sign said, but the food came out surprisingly quick! Though, not all at once.

So... the mac and cheese was great! Tasted very homemade and slightly gritty like they used ricotta cheese in it. Not as rich and creamy as I am used to, but the bf loved it. I really liked the fried okra, though the bf didn't care for that. But you can't go wrong with sweet potato fries, especially waffled! Yum! Very crisp but not greasy.

The cornbread was a bit disappointing. It came out a bit after the other stuff so I figured it was just being baked or something, but it didn't seem that way. It was somewhat dry and bland. Sadly, I really like the cornbread from Famous Daves! And the ribs, it was good flavor. And not overly saucy. But a bit dry. The first bite of the ribs were great..! But maybe they cooled quickly and became really dry that I didn't want to have more (like I usualy do).

Overall, the sides were great but the ribs were not the best, though not bad. I wanted to try the dessert, but didn't yet. Service was great. The place was clean. Gotta try the pulled pork and desserts next time! I will be back!",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,3,3,4,88_ElBbD1Fr3_scizfBnHQ

I always slow down looking at the sign as if it would magically change. $4.99 has to be a really good deal for BBQ so to save some bucks I wanted to go during lunch. Passed by on a Saturday, like clock work I see the sign, slow down, read the sign, and check the clock.  Almost continued on as usually but it was lunch time so turned at the next chance.  

""Yea Im gonna get my BBQ ON!!"" Not so, no lunch special on Sat and Sun but a 2 for 1 breakfast special which was OK but I really wanted some BBQ.  Not much of a BBQ menu for breakfast, mostly omelets and waffles. Ordered the brisket omelet not my favorite I was expecting it to be covered with BBQ sauce and big chunks of brisket pieces instead there was tiny slices of brisket and not a lot of taste.  All there was on the table was hot sauce and ketchup. It was plenty filling though. Next time I'll see if they can give me some BBQ sauce.

I ordered some BBQ to go. Some of their ""world famous"" BBQ ribs which tasted really good and the meat fall off the bone tender like it suppose to.  The full slab was $20 but had a $10 for $20 yelp coupon so scored.

I had the craving for some brisket, hence the brisket omelet, so ordered that to. Again I was expecting thick pieces of brisket, you know something you can cut with fork.  Instead very thin slices kind of how you would eat deli meats.  It was also rubbery and chewy, not a fan of the meat but loved the sauce.

Services was good, friendly and warm must have been the holiday season.  The place was decked out for the holidays, stocking hanging, xmas tree, and music playing.  It was slow there so I don't think they mined me stay there a just relaxing after I ate.  Even stole a few ribs and brisket pieces out of my containers before I left LOL.

We were there on a warm evening 97°, and I was concerned that the air conditioning would be enough to keep us comfortable. When I entered the place it felt a bit warm, but as my group entered into the restaurant it was cooler, and very comfortable inside. I have posted some photos of the interior. I never understand why people who review restaurants don't post photos of what the place looks like inside. Comfortable enough tables and chairs. A divider between tables, giving you a little privacy.
We were seated immediately, and waited upon in a courteous and prompt manner. Two different people came to our table a few times to ask if everything was all right.
We ordered three different dishes and they were all very good. I had the barbecue chicken and it was excellent. My grandson tore into the baby back ribs, he really loved them! My daughter said the pulled pork sandwich was very good also. 
We ordered two desserts to go, the red velvet cake, and the lemon cake. My only question was why did the waitress give us the dessert menu and tell us to pick something out. And then when we did, she told us what we chose was sold out and there are only two items left! Which were the two we ended up ordering. I think that's a mistake and lazy service. But I can let it go this one time just hope they don't do it again. 
I don't like eating with plasticware, especially at these prices, but my grandson said, hey grandma, it's a rib place! So it was OK for the nine-year-old.
Food was served on a regular oval plate, but the sides were served in Styrofoam cups which I thought was weird.
If you don't mind a mix of plastic and Styrofoam and real tableware then I guess you're OK with that part. For me the taste of the chicken made up for it, but it was hard to cut with a plastic knife and fork. Even though it was very tender.",Z9iUbPeI25jCZ1SW4hD2cA,1,0,3,Rv9_JaN-DnBEbraJ60z9sA

The decor and atmosphere is that of a place you would find next to an old school barber shop in da hood or in the south anywhere. I definitely like the atmosphere. They were having a book signing and radio show while I was there. 

When I received my meal they gave me 2 pulled pork and 1 brisket. Not a big deal so I just let it be. 1st up the pulled pork. It was ok. Not exciting but not bad either. Just meat, bread and bbq sauce. Bread was good. But the pork was average. Could have used something on the sandwich to stand out. Next up was the brisket. It was better than the pork but again just a little boring. Then the onion rings. These were actually pretty great. Nice crisp and some seasoning that was really good. I also decided to have the sweet potato pie. It too was really good. It seemed that items that should've been the star were no more than average. The sides I had though were really good.

I'm far from being a BBQ expert, but the two times I came here, I have not been disappointed. Their sweet tea is off the chain. Their sides are deeelish. I enjoyed the collard greens, mac-and-cheese, and don't forget the fried okras. Yes. Superb indeed.

I suggest coming here with a good appetite and a few friends lusting for some hunks. Hunks of meat. Baby back ribs, dried up, BBQ sauce on the side. The meat is succulent enough and flavored to a satisfying point of delight. Tender and falls right off the bone. Same goes for their BBQ chicken. Golly, that is one BIG CHICKEN, I kid you not. I don't know what they have in the back of the kitchen, but half a chicken was gigantic. Where the other half escaped and whether it was found, I'll never know. Pulled pork as a little on the salty side, but who doesn't mind compensating salty with some cornbread?

[Even though we called T.C.'s and they ok'd our $10 for $20 certificate for delivery, Road Runner said there was no way they could accept it unless T.C.'s had the coupon physically there...wha???  At least the gal who answered the phones at T.C.'s was very cordial and patient with us]

Back to the food. 

We ordered pulled pork with 2 sides and cornbread.  The pulled pork was disappointing.  Not good quality meat.  Flavors not amusing.  The cornbread, though it was a single corn muffin, was good, moist, and fluffy.  

The 2 sides were greens and sweet potato fries.  The greens were the best thing in the entire order.  Not soggy, flavorful, cooked with bacon and spiced.  The sweet potato fries actually were soggy, limp, and therefore unappetizing.  

We also ordered a meatless platter which includes your choice of 3 sides.  We doubled up on the greens, luckily.  We ordered baked beans, which were yummy, and mac n' cheese which was alright except for the piece of paper I bit in to....wow.  

For dessert we had the peach cobbler, which was so bad, we decided as soon as we return home, to make one ourselves as a redemption.  It was made with canned peaches, and the cobbler part was a cinnamon and flour mass that was undercooked.  Made my tummy hurt. 

The amount of food could've fed 3 people comfortably.  Well, splitting one corn muffin might have been uncomfortable.  If I were to eat from there again, I'd want to go in person to see how clean the restaurant is.

The mac and cheese was pretty good...very creamy.


I am not a big fan of cornbread, so it's not really fair of me to comment on it, but my husband enjoyed it!

I absolutely loved the greens! They had so much flavor, and just the right combination of spice and vinegar! Best greens I have had out at a restaurant, so far!

The service was great! We were checked on quite frequently, and everyone was smiley, pleasant  and helpful. Granted, we were the only customers in there (it was about 8:00 on a Sunday night), but we still appreciate the attentiveness. 

The decor is country casual, with lots of black and white family photos on the walls and cute sayings and plaques. It has a warm family-owned and family-friendly vibe to it, and there is a tic-tac-toe game on each table.

Ribs are good but sides are small and some are very bad. The cornbread is tiny and tastes terrible, just don't understand why they'd serve dry bad tasting bread. 

Another huge issue is customer service. I bought a Groupon for this place and realized it's only for lunch and one day showed up 5 minutes after lunch 2:05, I was then told I could not use the Groupon. I asked if she please let me use it since I can't get here early because of work and it'll expire soon, but the employee didn't even try to ask the manager just said no!

I've been dying to try this barbeque place for 4 YEARS at least.  I see advertisements for it from time to time and even in the Facebook groups. 

Walked to this sensational smell of ribs on a grill?  I'm not sure.  It was very inviting with Happy Kwanzaa, Hanaka & Santa decorations.  I was filled with joy because I was feeling cozy and warm inside.  We ordered 3 quarter ribs, 2 had sweet potato fries and one with Mac & cheese.  While we waited we noticed regulars were remembered by their orders.  I was really impressed with the service here.  Even when our food came up (12 minutes) they call you by name & even asked if we'd like silverware.  It's very conveniently located two major streets away (5 minutes).

We made it how without peeking in the bag like it was Christmas all over again. I had baby back ribs, boyfriend & his mom chose SPARE ribs.  I kid you not the meat falls off the bone.  I was amazed at how good the baby back ribs were lean & meaty.  I have got to go back on Tuesday.  They also had lunch specials for $6.  Their food is finger food so ask for napkins & wet wipes, ha ha.

We tried Lucile's and spent $100 on three people we spent half and I'd say it was top notch quality.  Their deserts were about $3.78 with tax.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,2,1,5,xcQGuau9pV7LI29Efr5SMw

The banana pudding was alright, it wasn't bad but could have been better. The yams were the highlight of the sides. The BBQ was perfectly seasoned and not too salty. 

The people who work there are friendly and I get my food pretty quickly. It's always been nice and clean. There are plenty of staff so it seems to run pretty efficiently.

3167835,2013-09-20,1,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"When you walk in the doors, it has the ""this doesn't feel like Vegas"" thing going for it. Simple decor, hand written deals on whiteboards, photos on the wall and what seems to be a family running the place. I personally love spots like that and I wanted to love TC's but it just didn't happen. 

I ordered a 2 meat combo with links and brisket then chose fried okra and greens for my sides. Being completely honest, this is the worst brisket I've ever had. I really don't even think they should call it brisket, it's that bad. The only thing I can compare it to is that boxed Philly cheese steak meat that comes frozen in super thin sheets. Only it's been freezer burned and overcooked to the point of leather-like texture. The link wasn't nearly as bad but definitely nothing special. As far as the sides go, the cornbread was bland and dry and the greens were straight bitter with absolutely no flavor. About the only thing worth noting on the plate was the okra...not too heavy on the breading and fried just right but still lacking flavor. My wife had a pulled pork sandwich...other than being way better then the other two meats on my plate, it still was just a basic sandwich and nowhere near worth the $9 price tag. Their sauce is ok but more sweet then anything and they don't even keep bottles of sauce on the table for you. Who does that?!

I'm really only giving this place two stars because their banana pudding was decent. Other than that, this was just a bad stop for me all around. The service was terrible, the food was even worse and it's highly overpriced. We used the Yelp $10 for $20 deal but still ended up paying $21 out of pocket.

3168726,2013-06-10,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"So after going to  Famous Dave's and eating their atrocious BBQ, I thought I'd try to find another spot, local or chain, that had better things to offer.  Most of the reviews were decent on TC's so I figured it was close enough to work to go check it out.

I took some co-workers to go with.

I had the 3 meat platter with chicken (dark meat), pulled pork and baby back ribs.  Side of slaw and mac and cheese.

Pulled pork was great, so was the chicken. 

Ribs were greatly lacking, and since their name is ""Rib Crib"", I expected better.  They were a bit tough to start with and didn't just tear apart with ease like you'd expect.  The flavor was great until I had some charred meat from the underside of the ribs where they obviously reheated on a grill.  All I could taste was burnt charcoal.

Mac and cheese had decent flavor and it was nice to have it super cheesy but it was incredibly greasy, so that's the drawback of that side.

Slaw was typical slaw, nothing to write home about.

Two people at the table had pulled pork sandwiches and they loved those.  Another person had rib tips and actually really enjoyed those but he said they weren't the best he's had by far.  The last person at the table also had the 3 meat combo and had rib tips, baby backs and brisket.

He said he wasn't a fan of the brisket, the rib tips decent, but the most awful part of his meal were the baby backs.  They ended up being tougher than mine, harder to eat and very dry.  Also had the nasty blacked char on one side.

He did in fact love his sides, dirty rice and baked beans.

Otherwise the service was great, super friendly and very attentive.  Refills on drinks overflowed and it definitely made up for the quality of SOME of the food.  I'd definitely go back but not for ribs, and that's the most disappointing part.

I bought the Yelp deal, the 10 for 20 dollar deal.  If it's available, get it yourself and then try the 3 meat combo yourself.  Definitely the way to go if you want to sample all the choices since it's roughly 17.99 on it's own.  So you end up saving money!",HZVcSn_GL7bb7ldMzcMKuA,6,0,3,QE0oIb2dyI8VMJCatFxtyw

3207419,2016-08-31,1,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"My name is Ellen and I ate three times at TC's Rib Crib in one week. There's the truth.
First, my friend Larry, who has been urging us to eat here, took me to lunch for the Tuesday specials. We each got a 5.99 sandwich, or ""Sammie, in TC's lingo. The pulled pork and the beef brisket sammies were very good! Baked beans and cole slaw were absolutely the right companion sides. I brought a thinly sliced beef brisket with two sides home for my husband, who had stars in his eyes and exclaimed his happiness with the food.
Of course I had to bring my husband back and we had a fine meal: my catfish was succulent and big enough for two meals, so I took that, the very flavorful and tender greens, and my cole slaw.
My husband ordered the ribs: which he stated, between bites and smiles, were about the best ribs he ever had! 
A couple of days after that my friend who travels a lot was in town for a quick visit.
Four of us came back to TC's. I opted for the brisket sammie, potato salad and greens. We definitely all enjoyed the service, the food, and the warmest of all welcomes.
Since moving to Las Vegas in 2015, we had not found a similar barbecue place with good southern comfort foods since Roger's Rib Shack in Northridge, CA.
Now we are all set! The people here are fabulous and go out of heir way to help with questions.

We were both in the mood for BBQ, and having been to TC's before at the old location, we decided to check out the new place. We walked in and were greated by the waitress on duty, a young Asian woman, who promptly seated us and gave us menus. There was only one other group of people in the room, which was surprising. We sat there looking at the menu for about 10 minutes, and then she finally took our drink order. After that, she dissapeared. Another 10 minutes walked by and we got up to leave. We crossed paths with her as we were walking out and she asked if we were leaving as she had the drinks we had ordered 15 minutes prior in her hands. We said yes, and she just said, ""Okay,"" and dumped the drinks out in the sink.

This girl has to be one of the worst waitresses I have ever experienced. She obviously doesn't care at all about service, and I'm pretty sure the owners of the restaurant would be a little miffed at her for the waste of the drinks. 

I almost wish TC's had stayed at the old location, as it had much more of a family-oriented vibe to it...much more intimate. I'm going to give TC's another shot sometime in the future, but I think I'll call in the order and pick it up rather than face this sort of service again.

IF YOU SEE THE YOUNG ASIAN WAITRESS BEHIND THE COUNTER WHEN YOU WALK IN, YOU MAY AS WELL JUST TURN AROUND AND WALK OUT. Unless you want to be ignored for a good 30 minutes, that is.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,2,1,1,aralEz8t9kaRuf56k8tfQA

I walk in and it was your atypical mom-n-pop rib shop which I get very excited about. We got the menus and they have a lot of items but they're pricey. I'm thinking they better be good for this price. When the baby back  ribs came they basically tasted the same as Chilis (which I like but expected something different).

I ordered water and it came in this little rinky dinky small cup, maybe 8 oz. My friend orders a soda and they bring her a big 16 oz cup that just towers over mine. So at this point I was feeling it to be an average 3-star place. Decent but nothing unique but before we were to leave my friend reminded of the big reason I wanted to come...bread pudding! Quickly I ordered it up. I was excited, I love bread pudding and take respect at how hard it can be to make it let alone to make it right. Not many places have this delicacy so I jump at the chance to get some when the opportunity arises. Then it comes...the disappointment that made this a 1-star restaurant. First off let me say this bread pudding is not cheap. $6. I'm willing to pay that though for some good bread pudding. This was not it. As the waitress is handing me my dessert I'm asking how they make it. With raisins? Bourbon? What's their unique, creative touch on it? 'Krispy Kreme', she says. Say wha??? 'Its really just a 'Krispy Kreme donut that we heat up', she continues. I don't know if I've ever felt so betrayed from a restaurant. I just paid 6 freakin dollars for a donut???  
All in this place, less the okra, was am utter disappointment.  And if you decide on dessert, ask how it's made. Shame on you TC's.",A9qy3Iy-a8dxmDn6Z9bdSA,2,1,1,MR0LN_kaMhqdCcOcXAnG9Q

A little pricey at $8 but the size was decent, as was the flavor. But the texture was bordering on mushy. I prefer the fuller, meatier quality of the pulled pork at Buzz BBQ. The bun was nicely toasted giving the sandwich an extra crunch and the fries weren't bad.

I do like the fact that they have lunch specials and daily dessert specials. The interior is nothing special, just a few tables and a small cashier counter and food display that leads to the kitchen.

This place was voted Best of Vegas 2007, Best Pulled Pork 2007...I say Hog Wash!!
 
This place earns 2 stars at best.  Too much sauce, very sweet sauce (which I usually like) but when you can't tell what is under the sauce, eeww...the ribs were tough and had no flavor.  Service left a lot to be desired! Price, pretty good.  Yelp had a special ($10 for $20) so the cost of dinner, cash out of pocket was $10 which included a tip.
 
Hard to find good BBQ in Vegas, but I'm on the hunt now.
 
Famous Dave's (another local BBQ favorite here in Vegas) get a much higher rating.

Anxiously awaiting its arrival but I have absolute faith it will be fantastic. As for sides. The salad was on point. The mac and cheese incredible and the potato salad...about average... but for vegas restaurants I've been to, that is amazing. I can only hope the next people that go here are as amazed as I was.

Seeing this deal on yelp spend $10 for $20 you think ""hey! What's to lose?"" The answer is flavor and quality. First impressions walking in to a empty restaurant and scoring this deal you automatically think ""what did I get myself into.."" How fresh can they actually keep their food with no customers helping to cycle it out of storage? The ribs were overcooked and tough like rubber, the pulled pork bland and mushy, the links were beyond charred to the point of it crumbling in my mouth leaving a horrible ashy taste. Now to the sides greens are saturated in salt, okra taste pre made well in advance and the Mac n cheese just didn't excite me.

This place isn't all bad though, our server was a younger guy, very cool to talk to and always was helpful and courteous. I'm not that disappointed since I used this deal, but I highly doubt we will be back.

Arriving at the location i was surprised at what little it really was inside upon entering as it was really like an indoor picnic very no frills and humble about the decor. We sat and ordered a 2 meat combo links/ pulled pork with 2 sides mac & cheese/ greens and cornbread for $15. And then the Rib tips and 2 sides mac & cheese/ potato salad and corn bread for $10. I was not impressed to say the least as the links were very mushy and not a solid put together product, the rib tips were sparse on the meat side and the sides... lordy the mac & cheese was dry and almost chalky with my only taking 1 bite of potato salad as it had too much built up condensation in the container from being stored in the fridge for too long. The best part of the meal was the pulled pork, where if you want to try this place i recommend doing the pulled items turkey, pork, chicken and bread to make a sandwich. The BBQ sauce like others mentioned is a brown sugar based sauce which i dont mind but if you dont like sweet sauce then this might not be for you. All in all it was a meal yes and the portions were decent but the quality of taste and product i just wasnt feeling at all. For the money i think i would have rather gone elsewhere to dine.

4084192,2016-07-23,1,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"As far as southern style BBQ goes, it was 3-3.5 stars.

Before I get into the review, you know those Yelp deals? They really shouldn't put the % savings because you never really save that much. You always spend more than what the voucher is worth. If you save a dollar, the ad should say you save a dollar, not 50%. It's really misleading. 

Anyway, we got the $20 for $10 deal, and ended up spending an extra $27 plus tip. 50% my a$$. We got two combo plates: Full rack of spare ribs plus two sides ($25) and 3-meat plate plus two sides ($20). 

The full rack was 8 or 9 good sized bones. The BBQ was fair meaning not the most tender, flavorful ever but not dry or rubbery either. The sides weren't very good though. The onion rings looked and tasted soggy with oil. The mac n cheese was just so-so. The corn bread was dry and saw-dusty. 

The 3-meat combo consisted of pulled pork, beef rib tips, and brisket. The brisket was a pile of confetti but still tasted okay. The tips and pork weren't bad either. And, the portions were large but not impressive. 

The coleslaw was decent but the foam cup it came in was filled less than full. Why does every place skimp on the slaw? It's just cabbage and watered down mayo!  The sweet potato fries were meh but at least somewhat less oil sogged than the rings. 

We got a squeeze bottle of their house BBQ sauce with our order but resisted the urge to spurge on the loaded bottle because that stuff is loaded with sugar. There were also 4 different brands of hot sauce on the table as well as the usual round of salt, pepper, more sugar and honey. The hot sauces, frankly, all tasted almost identical to me but they added some interest. 

Also interesting were the many black and white photos from Afro-American history displayed on all the walls. The overall deco was quaint and simple with a mild touch of southern charm. The staff was very friendly except for the lady at the front who seemed a bit gruff when we first walked in but eventually got around to smiling later on. 

Overall, we had a pleasant experience and the food gets a solid 3 and 3.5 for the BBQ portion. It would've a sure 4 if the sides were better, but the friendly service made up for it.",_RlWNkoiLYpijlb89V-CyA,0,0,4,k4J8LayKdQNVAaBwNbn3Rw

Ordered 3 meat plate with ribs, rib tips and brisket. Came out all sauced and brisket chopped. This is a good way to hide bad bbq. I asked if the sliced brisket and they tried to to tell me it was.  Please sell this to someone who is clueless not someone who had reviewed 30 plus bbq restaurants from great to awful.

Finally got my plate and was really unimpressed.  Everything was lackluster.  Rib tips sigh, ribs sigh and the pulled pork okay. It all needed the sauce.  Not good for a bbq place.  No smoke ring or Smokey flavor. I almost doubt there is a smoker on the premises.  Not sure outside of the sauce I would even call this bbq. 

The sides mac and cheese and baked beans were better than the meats but still not awesone.

Gropon shopping one night I came across a groupon for TC's Rib Crib, a friend had told me about this place a couple of months ago, I had yet to make y way up there.  Why not buy the groupon and take a drive to see what TC's is cooking, what peeked my interest was the RED KOOL-AID.  Sorry for the following statement: They have the black folks kool-aid, red w/ 7 cups of sugar and a hint of lemon.  Not everybody can make it, ijs, the sugar/water ration be off, folks be forgetting the lemon sometimes it be a hot mess BUT NOT THIS PLACE.  I met the owner, he corrected me, it's 8 cups...right on POINT!  

Back to the review, so I have groupon in hand and I happened to be on that side of town.  I was craving some fish, there is only once place that I go to in the valley for fish, a lot of ""US"" get our fish from this other establishment.  GUESS WHAT?  I found a new place to get my fish, and yes it is worth the drive.  I order the catfish meal w/ fries, salad and cornbread.

Fish hot from the grease, flaky, crunchy, moist, I could taste the LAWRY'S in the breading. OMG!  I was driving and eating (like a true fat a$$) and literally stopped at a light, got out the car and put the bag in the cargo area of my jeep just so I wouldn't eat anymore.  No tarter sauce nor hot sauce needed, however when you add the tarter and hot sauce it takes it to another level, talk about lip smacking, finger licking good.  Side salad is an actual SALAD, say what, say huh?  Yes, a REAL salad, not some Fresh Express Iceberg lettuce in a bag.  This salad was made with spinach, field greens, carrots, tomatoes, cheese and the ranch is BOMB DIGGY.  

I very much so enjoyed my meal, I ordered take out but while waiting for my food I did  walk through of the restaurant.  It is a family environment, not too big not too small, on the wall are photos of their (TC's)  family, you see the generations on the wall, the history of this family it is an amazing display to see.

The staff was very friendly, and service very fast.  TC's offer weekly specials and kids eat free on Monday w/ the purchase of an adult meal, it's worth it.  You know how it is when you are waiting for you food, you just kind of sit off to the side quietly and wait until they call your name or number...not here.  Maybe it was just my experience, even though this was my 1st visit to TC's it just felt like home, like I had been before.

We ordered the spare ribs and baby back ribs.  Both were very tender and had good flavor.  Their BBQ sauce is awesome.  Great flavor and a nice bite to it.

We also ordered the rib tips and brisket.  Some of the tips were burnt, but the ones that weren't were really good (the waitress did give us a discount).  The brisket was okay, a little tough.  

Very disappointed with the sides.  We ordered coke slaw, potato salad, Mac and cheese, baked beans, and candied yams. The candied yams were delicious.  Good sweet yam flavor.  The Mac and cheese looked like the sauce curdled and had no flavor, very dry.  Potato salad, baked beans, and coke slaw were nothing special, very plain.  I expect the sides at a BBQ joint to be very good.  

Overall, the meat was good and the sides were just okay.  Probably won't come back because there is so many other BBQ places in town to try.",vlc6EN9zb66D01fLE8ehPQ,0,0,3,fmuN63BaBEqmhc_W5jF4Sg

Not the best I've tasted, but it's good. Not recommend the Beef ribs though. The fibers of the meat is to tough for me and the size just too big. The portion is big for one, maybe barely enough for 2 if you don't order side dishes. I have yet to try the baby back ribs. I always order the sauce on the side, just so the flavor of the meat won't get masked by the sauce. The ribs are good for the leanness and not too fatty. Very tricky because it can be tough when the you're grilling meat with less fat! For the price it's a good neighborhood eatery that I would go to.",dYUsY1q6VISy46Q1hxQeBA,1,1,4,x9OvG9Y0H-VzEAiPPbxjDw

Like I said before- don't miss out on their $10 for $20 Yelp deal, or $12 for $20 Groupon deal (why wouldn't you use Yelp!). It makes this place worth it!
This time we tried a three meat combo- 
Beef ribs were pretty fatty and meat was a little tough for my preference. My boyfriend, thought it was ""aight.""
Pulled pork was very tender as pulled pork should be. A little salty, but missing something. Their BBQ sauce did the trick. Very large portion! 
Brisket flavor was the best of all three meats we had. Large portion of this too. 
Mac and Cheese was on the blander side on its own- I added pulled pork, some hot sauce & BBQ sauce to it and had myself a delicious pulled pork Mac and cheese.
Corn bread was not the business. Dry & flavorless. Maybe it needed butter. Was just there for substance than anything. 
We also had the banana pudding for dinner. Maybe the best thing we had at TC's! I wish I wasn't so full so I could have enjoyed this more. I think I will be stopping by here for banana pudding when my sweet tooth kicks in :-). 
Good service as well- all of the girls who helped wait on us were sweet. 

TL;DR- $10 for $20 on Yelp. Get it. Brisket is where it's at. Get banana bread pudding for dessert. Large portions and affordable price.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,6,4,3,glVJ7cPPXgOkJ4VY2Deb0w

I wish I had a crystal ball to know for certain, but the ribs and brisket I got looked to be recently heated up and/or packaged at some point. The brisket had a oozing puddle of that red-orange grease you may see when you reheat fatty or greasy pieces of meat, like next day breakfast sausage and/or bacon. 

The ribs were so dark and over charred. As stated earlier they too looked like a old batch from the previous day. They weren't tender by a long shot.

The only comment of flavor I can give towards them was that neither had flavor and both had to be drowned in BBQ sauce. The overly sweet sauce that could have easily been out the bottle with a couple extra seasonings mixed in. 

The mac and cheese and cole-slaw I got as my sides were so generic and unremarkable. It was recommended by my server  to get their peach cobbler to round out my groupon. Straight out the can peaches with too much cinnamon. At least I could tell the crust used was home made. Dry, non flaky or buttery crust, but homemade.

This place gets the prize for my worst groupon purchase to date. I wouldn't recommended or come back to this place, even with another groupon.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,5,1,1,W7r-PZsW-e2MZj29c1jsfQ

We had a certificate from Restaurant.com which obliged us to eat there and while we were originally hoping for take-out, I'm glad we stayed.  First impression - I really liked the decor which had great, vibrant color along with tasteful framed photographs on the wall which made you feel right at home.  This is exactly what I want from a barbecue joint -clean, tasteful, casual, and homey.

Service was prompt, friendly and attentive throughout.  The food was the real deal - plenty of  great tasting pulled pork with just a bit of sauce on the bun and great coleslaw to go on top.  My girlfriend got a two meat combo with beef ribs, hot links, and two sides which she said was also good.  The peach cobbler was great - and I don't even like peaches!  I can't wait to try the glazed donut bread pudding.

I saw the Yelp gift certificate ($20 for $10) and decided to give it another try. 

This time I had the Beef Ribs (very tasty but a lot of FAT and small amount of meat) and the Spare Ribs (this by far has been the best of the meats so far. I went ala carte as I wanted to try the Peach Cobbler.  I'm so glad I saved room this cobbler was delish.  I would say a lot of time was put into making it.  Great flavor! I asked them to bring it to me cold not heated and that they did.  With the scoop of vanilla ice cream, I was in heaven!

I believe this is a family owned and run business, started by father and now run by the son. The server I had on my second visit, James, was one of the friendliest and personable I have ever had for a small place. His smile and his truly caring attitude was ever present.  He wanted me to have a good meal!

Walking into T.C.'s Rib Crib, you're thinking it's a fast food joint.  But when they find out you're here for dining in, they'll have you take a seat for a full service experience.

We wanted a taste of it all, so the BF and I ordered up one of their ""Lots O' Meat Meal Deals"" for any combination of three meats, cornbread and two sides for $14.99.  Of the meats, we chose the Beef Tips, Links (2), and 1/4 Baby Back Rib Slab.  You can also choose Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Beef Ribs, Spare Ribs, or 1/4 Chicken.  Or sides, we chose the Grandma Georgia's Macaroni and Cheese and the Fried Okra.  Other sides include Aunt Ada's Potato Salad, Big Sam's Baked Beans, Cousin Joe's Greens, Uncle Earl's Coleslaw, Sweet Potato French Fries, Fried Jalapenos, and few other staples.

This meal was plenty for the two of us!  The Beef Tips were more like chunks of meat, not as tender as I would have hoped.  The Links were pretty grub though, a  nice crunch and texture and pretty tasty.  The Baby Back Ribs were okay.  The first rib I got has little meat on it, the second rib had more though.  We got a generous portion of fried okra, more than what they give you at M & M Soul Food Cafe.  It's breaded up and could use a bit more zing though.  The Macaroni and Cheese is a bit different with a grainy texture.  It's tasty, but  I guess it all depends if you like your mac and cheese creamy or not.  

They also serve up some Sweet Tea for $1.49 or $2.49.  Don't be a fool and get the small cup, go for the super large one instead!  Yum yum!  

They have a bucket load of desserts to choose from the Friday early evening we showed up!  Banana pudding, Coconut Cake, Snickers Cake, Homemade Louisiana Pralines, Glazed Donut Bread Pudding, etc.  It's definitely worth taking a look at their dessert display!

We also ordered a Full Slab of Baby Back Ribs with 2 Sides and Cornbread for $18.99 to go.

They have a Kids' Menu for $3.49 for those ten and under.  Kids eat free on Mondays with the purchase of an adult meal too!  They also serve up Burgers and Sammies, Chicken, and Catfish (on Fridays only)!

Food is a solid three star, but the service is a four.  The wait didn't take 20 minutes like it was posted it can, so that's a good thing.  They come by and check up on you, get refill on your drinks if that's what you got, etc.  You can tell they have a lot of return customers here.  My big concern is seeing a bunch of older people with obvious health problems chowing down on not so health conscious food choices!

As someone who's spent most of their life in Oakland and LA, I have been looking for some soul food bbq for a while now in Las Vegas. And I want to be very clear about it being SOUL FOOD bbq. It's the kind of bbq that your uncle cooks at the family picnic. Nothing exceptionally spectacular, just pretty good bbq. It's obviously not going to win any Food Network World Champion BBQ competitions, but it was cooked well (the pork on my ribs literally just slipped off the bone) and has good sauce. 

The sides were also good. I got the mac and cheese and greens, which were far superior to what I was served at M&M's. The mac and cheese was perfectly seasoned (I only added a little bit of pepper, which I do to everything as almost a tick), and the greens were the perfect mix of sweet and salty. Most meals also come with a cornbread muffin, which was ok. I personally prefer slices of white bread with my bbq, so I'll consider asking for that next time I come. They also have all the best soul food drinks (Kool-Aid, Sweet Tea, Muddy Water), and come in a massive cup for like $2. My red Kool-Aid was literally served to me in the biggest cup I have ever received.

The atmosphere was typical of soul food restaurant: family photos on the wall, R&B music playing, those slippery booths they also have at Subways. The dinnerware were those hard plastic ones, and the utensils were disposable plastic ones. I wasn't mildly surprised by any of this, because, once again this was typical of SOUL FOOD BBQ restaurant. I've been to bbq restaurants that literally have three tables, and give your your food in Styrofoam containers regardless of whether you're taking it to go. 

The only thing that I found a bit unfavorable was that I thought it was a bit pricey for what your got. My 1/4 rib meal cost $11, and only came with one side (I split the other with my friend). That being said, I rarely leave a Vegas restaurant under $10, so I wasn't too surprised.

We grabbed a combo to share: 

Spare ribs and baby back ribs were two of our choices. I ended up enjoying the spare ribs more as they were much juicier while still having a smoke flavor. It wasn't the best I've had, but they were solid enough. I wanted to try their beef ribs but they were out. 

We got beef sausage as our 3rd meat. This was hot link style and this I enjoyed better than the ribs actually. 

Sides we got mac n cheese which was just okay, collard greens was a bit too salty, fried jalapeno slices were spicy, crispy and good. They also brought us cornbread with our combo which was good but could have used some butter. I probably should have asked for some

The lady working the counter was pretty nice and came to check on us a few times for drink refills. 

Overall decent, but not my favorite BBQ joint around. I would get the sausage link again though, perhaps as a sandwich.

A few days ago, I went to one of Wolfgang Puck's branches and ordered a side of mac n' cheese, hoping that I would taste something comparable...not even close. The mac and cheese at T.C.'s had a very nice creamy base--not too artery-clooging heavy, but just the right amount of goodness. It also had little pieces of cheese (dried parmesian?) sprinkled throughout, which is why I loved it soooo much. Cheesy tastiness on top of more cheesy tastiness!

Prices are really good.  A full rack for less than $20.  For just two bucks more, you can add two sides and cornbread to your ribs.

We had enough for lunch sandwiches the next day.  The meat was grilled perfectly, tasty, meat came off the bones and had a little grill mark to add that grill flavor.  So why the 3 stars?   The problem is the barbeque sauce.     The barbeque sauce ... tasted like watered down ketchup, and not much of a secret tangy barbeque sauce passed down through generations of southern family home grandma cookin'.

Comon guys, get with it!  Improve the barbeque formula!  I'd probably give you a much higher rating.  Service was good.",SyyYQfNQ4a4Lua5RBlggmQ,3,1,3,ukFrVxgUMXOmDkbxeweZdg

This is a casual, small spot where the food comes on styrofoam. There aren't table cloths, but you can dine in. 

In addition to drool-worthy, fresh fried okra, I had sweet potato fries and a quarter chicken. The fries were not as impressive as the okra, but my husband inhaled them in less than a minute. As for the chicken, I could literally pick it up, and the bones would fall out, which means that this was one tender piece of chicken. Tender and flavorful- what more could you want from a chicken? Well, it could have been a bit juicier, and I did miss not having a spicy BBQ sauce. However, the standard sauce had a savory sweetness and was nothing to complain about!

The service was super sweet too.

Located near Norm's Eggs Café in a strip mall off South Durango and featuring ""World Famous"" ribs with awards in 2007 and 2010 for the city's best barbeque it was with tempered expectations that I entered TC's Rib Crib and although I will say the Motown soundtrack and service were quite pleasant as I watched the Buckeyes obliterate Kent State, little else of my experience was even remotely good - a small, buttery biscuit and a jumbo praline the lone exception.  Obviously the sort of place willing to cut corners as condiments include Aunt Jemima and 'honey' cut with glucose syrup and starch it was in a wide selection of meats, sides, and sweets that I invested and although costs were quite low for most items, so too was the quality - the ribs clearly parboiled without a note of smoke while thinly sliced brisket and pulled pork were nearly indistinguishable beneath artificially saccharine sauce.  Mostly ignoring bland elbow noodles from which I consumed only a few bites and fries that arrived almost at meal's end as well as the $4.50 French Toast was flat and flavorless even with the $1.50 banana and whipped cream upgrade...the latter not supplied as they were apparently 'out'...and moving on to dessert, suffice it to say that the boxed vanilla pudding with only a hint of banana beneath 'nilla wafers is not worth $5.99 and although the frosting on a tiny sliver of red velvet cake was tangy and smooth the cake was so dry it literally crumbled to fork pressure - the majority of it joining nearly half the rest of my order in a waste basket when servers were otherwise occupied so as not to offend.

Literally the only patron present just past noon on a Saturday it is shocking to me that a business like TC's can sustain and as much as I try to support locals I cannot fathom a reason to return, particularly given a pricepoint higher than Rollin' Smoke despite quality on par with Famous Dave's.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,5,1,Lc8TO38o9GpsQg36JXRCTQ
5295240,2008-08-17,3,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"We were hankering for some good BBQ and stumbled upon a place called T.C.'s Rib Crib. Again, we used our entertainment book coupon to save $15 so why not splurge and order more than we should. We get to the place and its on the smaller side. There's about 12 tables and thats about it. I heard if you order to go, its gonna be like a fast food place experience... But if you dine in, they promptly seat you, bring you table settings, and give you the full service you would expect from a nicer restaurant. We get there around 5pm on a Saturday and almost all the tables were full. I take that as a good sign. We get the menus and start looking over the choices. Meats meats meats was the name of the game. I ordered the Lot's O' Meat Meal ($18.00) which comes with 3 meats, 2 sides, and a corn bread. The meats to choose from were: beef tips, pulled pork, beef brisket, links (2), 1/4 rib slab, 1/4 chicken. The sides to choose from were: Grandma Georgia's Macaroni and Cheese, Aunt Ada's Potato Salad, Big Sam's Baked Beans, Cousin Joe's Greens, Uncle Earl's Coleslaw, Regular Fries, Onion Rings, Fried Jalapenos, Wedge Cut Fries, Fried Okra, Sweet Potato French Fries. Wowzers, thats alot!

So for my meats I get the beef brisket, hot links, and 1/4 rib slab. The rib slab was a choice of baby back, beef, or spare ribs. I got the baby back ribs. My sides were Grandma Georgia's Mac and Cheese and Onion Rings. My friend ordered the full rack of baby back ribs ($18.00) which also came with 2 sides and a corn bread. Her sides were Sweet Potato French Fries, YUM!, and Wedge Cut Fries.

Man was the food tasty. The meats were tender and super flavorful and the sides were huge. The best part is that I ordered a small fountain drink (sm $1.49 lg $2.49) since it was all you can drink and the waitress brings me a large 32 oz drink. I was like ""I ordered the small"" and she replied ""That is the small."" Wow. I guess the large is a 44+ oz size then.

The $15 coupon definitely paid off and the food was really really good. I would definitely go back to this place. This was way better than Memphis Championship BBQ.",0ObIfSgndeeR_kGlo1S7Ww,4,3,4,Fd5-ACyIkRNaC6cWqF_AzA

5361300,2012-02-06,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"**Summary**
       - Ribs - The spare ribs were probably one of the best ribs I've ever had. The meat inside was just so tender. The bbq sauce was just perfect with fire-kissed crust.
       - Homemade - Almost all of their non-fried sides are homemade. It gives the food a more family feeling.
       - Location - They used to be over on Dessert Inn but moved to a roomier location. They also changed their phone number and didn't update yelp until recently.
       - Price - The prices are a bit steep if you're eating for one. I usually share a three meat combo, so it ends up being about $9 a person. Trust me when I say, it's a lot of food.
       - Consistency - It seems people either really like or really hate the place. Even something like the meatiness of the ribs is up for debate. I don't know if it's a consistency problem.
**Ordered**
       - $17.99 Three Meat Combo with 2 sides and cornbread muffins.
          - 1/4 Rack (3 bones) Baby Back Ribs (Pork) - Fire-smoked and crispy on the outside with their homemade bbq sauce. Meaty and juicy on the inside. It's a step above your overcooked Tony Roma's or Famous Dave's ribs.
          - 1/4 Rack (3 bones) Spare Ribs (Pork) - I'd prefer the spare ribs over the baby back because they had more meat and were thicker. This meant there was a lot more fall off the bone meat between the smoked crispy crust and the bone.
          - Beef Brisket - The bbq sauce, though the same as the ribs, just seemed too sweet. The brisket was not thick sliced like I was use to. It was thinly sliced like bulgogi. I probably wouldn't get this again.
          - Candied Yams - Homemade and caramelized to perfection.
          - Wedge Cut Fries - Crispy on the outside, cooked just right on the inside.
          - Cornbread muffins - Also homemade, they were sweet and delicious. For an extra dose of diabetes, you can add honey on top.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for some calorific soul food. I'd choose your meats/sides wisely however. Reading the other reviews and my own experience, the items are either really good or really bad.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,4,2,4,Th4R4d3JQehFRBD9KVql8w

I went with my two small children, ordered the lunch special BOGO free on Tuesdays.  I ordered the riblets with coleslaw and the half chicken with mac and cheese. I thought it was gonna be enough for the 3 of us.  When the food came out i thought it was a joke or something.  I was like, where is the rest of our food!!!??   The servings are ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!   I had to order an extra lunch special.   My 2 year old ate the super tiny quarter leg almost whole.   And my riblets were just so tiny  there was hardly any meat on them.  On top of that the food came out cold... What a BIG letdown!!   I will never go back.  I really don't understand all the hype about this place.  Maybe we went on the wrong day and time.   If you want good BBQ try H&H BBQ in NLV.

So we can say customer service was great but the food was below average. We got a 2 meat combo to share with Baby Back Ribs and 1/4 Dark Meat Chicken with sides of Mac and Cheese, Potato Salad, and Corn Bread. I had them throw in a slice of Coconut Cake, all of their deserts were sitting there staring at me, I couldn't resist.
Portion size was fine but I could've made better food on our backyard grill and stove. BBQ sauce was on the vinegary side but had an almost bad meat taste to it. Chicken was just ok, nothing special, cooked to stay moist but flavor overall was lacking. Ribs were over charred and dry. Mac and cheese was mushy and bland, not enough cheese flavor. Corn bread was dry and tasteless. Potato salad was about the best thing we got and that's not saying much. The Coconut Cake tasted like it was cooked with suntan lotion, tasted artificial, I couldn't get past the first bite.

Even tho they weren't rushing us I didn't want to be that be that one that kept them after hours so we quickly placed our order-full slab of ribs, greens, and Mac n Cheese. My son asked if they had spicy BBQ sauce and our sweet, young waitress with that lovely southern accent said ""no but we have Louisiana hot sauce you can add to it, would you like me to mix it in for you?"" My son, ""oh yeah, smart! thanks I can do that :D"" The greens had a lil kick to them, the macncheese was very cheezy the ribs were just a lil dry but the BBQ sauce alone was so good! 
We were glad we decided to share our meal because it was more than enough for us and all very good.

The barbecue sauce was highly rated- tangy, sweet and flavorful. The ribs  and chicken wings were cooked nicely. The cole slaw was good as well.  No complaints there. The problems were with the following:

Cornbread: very odd, off-tasting, bland, giving the experience of eating a gummy lump of flavorless dough. I wanted to like it but there wasn't anything to go on. 

Catfish: fried nicely, but tasted like thawed out store fish. Overloaded with salt.

Macaroni and cheese: bland, flavorless. We guessed all the salt was used on the fish. 

French fries- tasted like the frozen potatoes we imagine they started as. Easily became cardboard-like. No flavor. 

Peach cobbler: by far the most disappointing. The only sweetness came from the peaches. The dough was just gloppy and flavorless. Where was the sugar? The vanilla? 

Our meal felt like a series of memory lapses where seasonings were forgotten. This sounds like a one-star review but I added a star because we enjoyed the BBQ ribs and chicken. When you spend money you want EVERYthing to taste good!",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,5,1,2,uMhRmWuCG4bPQI3mfAB4Mw

5583198,2012-04-21,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"1 year ago we moved to Summerlin and since then I have driven past TC's Rib Crib and seen it on my check in list on Yelp and other sites.  At first I thought it was someone's house but then I saw it was a real shop and my hopes rose as I love BBQ and hole in the wall places are usually the best.     Well finally my family and I gave it a try.  First   The menu was promising and I am kicking myself for not trying the Catfish Fry-Day special. Instead we went for the three meat combo and our daughter tried the two rib kids meal.   The baked beans and cornbread  were excellent and the potato salad not bad.  The barbecue sauce had a lot of flavor and spice.  However, there was way too much sauce on the food even for us BBQ lovers.  The spare ribs were tough and chewy instead of tender.  The pulled pork might as well been a bowl of sauce as the meat's only flavor came from the mass of sauce.  The brisket was unique, almost a greek gyro cut (very thin and bendable like ribbon) but was also chewy and overcooked.  The atmosphere was nice but the staff mostly seemed overworked resulting in a long time between drink refills.  The YELP coupon definitely made this a value buy and the $4.99 lunch specials and kids prices make it a bargain for the value conscious but if you are looking for the perfect BBQ, you will be disappointed.  It appears from the mixed reviews that this place may be hit or miss depending on the chef or how busy they are but It won't be in my main rotation.  I will however give it another shot one day just to see if I caught a bad day.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,4,1,2,fPp5ew-YngjkqQQRJO3s8Q

TC's didn't disappoint.  The pulled pork was quite flavorful, as was the brisket.  And don't (ok, go ahead) get me started on the side dishes.  I had their green beans, fried okra and dirty rice...all three were outstanding and done to perfection.

The staff is ultra-friendly and appreciative and I enjoyed the conversation when I was there.

The only thing keeping this from a 5-star rating is the ribs.  While they weren't bad, they just weren't as good as the other meats.  If they would consider removing the underside membrane from their baby backs (yes, it's time-consuming), and allow the smoke to permeate better from the bone-side also, the smoke flavor would be more obvious throughout and a little more pink would come through.  But that's the only suggestion.

5663208,2008-06-19,6,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"The GF and I stopped by this place about a week ago for some good ol' Que. This place is fairly small and most of the employees seemed to be family.

I was fairly hungry and figured ""I'm at the rib crib, I should order the ribs."" (usually not what I order at BBQ). I ordered the full rack baby backs with 2 sides for......$18.... I think. My sides were the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese.  The GF ordered ""Lots O' Meat Deal"". She ordered the pulled pork and 2 orders of brisket (the girl loves her some brisket) with sweet potato fries and fried okra. I think it was about $15. 
 
So our food came out in a timely manner and we started gobbling it up. My ribs were very tender. The first bone I picked up slid out of the meat. They weren't soggy but not dry either. I can't tell you how much I LOVED THE BBQ SAUCE. The ribs seemed to be boiled then grilled... not the way I usually enjoy them (smoked.......mmmm....) but none the less very tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy not mushy like most, very good, and the mac and cheese wasn't the creamy version but more of a casserole type...not the best but pretty good. Oh ya and the cornbread was not very good... I don't think I even ate it all...that's very unusual. I'm a cornbread junkie.

The GF's plate was filled with SO MUCH MEAT!!!!!!!! AHA.... I just wanted to shove my face into the plate and inhale....what a great death that would be..... anyways......2 huge portions of brisket and a huge helping of pulled pork. I have to say everything on her plate was defiantly worth eating again. Brisket was nicely sliced and the pork was extremely soft and tender. As far as I could tell none of their meat is smoked but as I said before it was still very good. Her fried okra was also good and I'm not a huge okra fan.

Didn't try any of the desserts (had to save room for AYCE sushi 4 hours later) but they all looked fabulous. 

I would officially give this place 3.5 stars but I'm gonna round up not down for the yelp score. Service was great and everyone was extremely friendly. 

THE BBQ SAUCE AT THIS JOINT IS ON POINT!!!!

Check 'em out... I recommend the ""Lots O' Meat Meal Deal"".... it's a lot of food for a real good price and you can sample three things they offer at the same time.",cmR12osCE30jlFCVUHJQEg,6,5,4,GkkZ578loPhZPZYsY8pAJQ

We were told that the three-meat combo alone was enough for two people, but it isn't. They were also out of brisket and rib tips by the time I arrived (6:30 PM), which meant I couldn't even get what I wanted. So...decent food, not worth the price.

The staff was friendly enough. The only point of contention arose when the Yelp voucher was presented, the terms of which did not specify one voucher per party (I was with a party of 13).

The reviews on Yelp seemed promising and the pictures on Instagram looked great; however, we were not very satisfied with this purchase.  The meats were actually good.  I had pulled pork and brisket, very juicy and tender.  My boyfriend had ribs and chicken, which he also thought were flavorful and juicy.  The sides were very subpar.  The macaroni and cheese was dry and pretty bland.  We also did not care for the potato salad.  The greatest disappointment was that we ordered a side of catfish and were charged $12.99 for two very small fish fillets (basically the size of a chicken finger each).  This was only for the fish fillets, did not include any sides at all. TC ribs should be embarrassed to charge their customers this.  Additionally, the online menu stated the cost for my two meat combo was $15.99, yet I was charged $17.99 instead.  The cornbread was decent, but we were told in placing the order we would receive 3 pieces and there were only 2 packaged when we arrived home.  Finally, we were greatly disappointed in the desserts.  My chocolate cake had that refridgerator taste when something has been in refrigerater too long.  Also, my boyfriend is from Louisianna and Peach Cobbler is his absolute favorite desert, yet he only ate about 1/4 of it.. He is not one to complain, but this man never has any food leftover on his plate.  Thank God we were able to use the $10 for $20 Yelp deal, otherwise our bill was almost $70 for a very subpar meal.

Pulled pork was soft and juicy. Brisket was good...not the best. Beef ribs were soooooooo yummy, fatty, and falling off the bone. It was sheer beauty. 

Mac and cheese side was meh for me. The baked beans were good, but I ain't no baked beans connoisseur.

What I was most pleased with was the wedge cut potatoes. Perfectly crispy and soft with a great batter. Next was the pulled pork, and then the beef ribs. Both were smoky and flavorful and soft. The spare ribs, on the other hand, were a bit hard and with less smoky flavor in the meat. Meat was plentiful, though, and the cornbread was good, not too sweet. 

Next time I will save room for dessert and try some other items.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,5,luzzXJW5xKEIRB07cvaPoA

I was picking up and order for home and there  was one woman who had long braids who was so rude and dismissive towards me. Excuse me for bothering your day lady. Because of this one woman it has left a bad taste in my mouth for this establishment I will not be returning.,Yjk5z7gYhzbt5UqbRzVtFw,2,0,1,lzD6GNHk6Lvo5qQn7f8_iA
5880592,2015-08-04,1,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"Really, really excellent!
The only reasons I'm giving 4 stars instead of five is because the BBQ sauce on the brisket was a little too much and a little too sweet (it was served that way).
Other than that the ribs were amazing, the mac and cheese was wonderful, the beans were really good and they had a $1.00 peach cobbler that was incredible!!
I went in a little hesitant because of some of the negative reviews, but we had a really grand experience!!
I WOULD recommend it, and I WILL return!!",Pt4Yzq9XLTrk5WkanUr3WQ,0,0,4,7jievQzDeN13BSqehTiUxA

My craving was so bad and I am happy to say that I was very satisfied! Fall off the bone, sauce was Devine, kind of spicy for my taste but still. All around worth it. I didn't dare try the potato salad lol I didn't want it to ruin my happiness with the ribs lol. But on ubereats they offer two sides and cornbread and it wouldn't let me choose fries x2. I'm ordering again today for lunch, hopefully it is as good as last time",UCpNBr3pKF1OqdBmVzjjLw,0,0,4,b68J2avBgL-VCttGbn5-cA
5887815,2018-01-16,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"This review is base on 1) ordering delivery 2)ordering takeout 3) that Mac n' cheese

Located on Twain and Durango across Desert breeze park. 

1) Delivery order
The first time I tried this place out, I decided to have it as a cheat meal on a weekend late afternoon. The food came fresh & hot and under the 45-60 minutes estimate. No complain there! That's +1 Star!

2) Takeout Order (thru app)
Placed an order at 4:40PM for Really Big Mac n' Cheese, full rack spare ribs, 2x extra sauce, side of greens and baked beans. And requested a pick up time for 5:30PM

We were running late and got there 15 minutes late (5:45pm). Walked in and the entire place was jammed pack (given that it was a Saturday). After 10 minutes more people came to pick up takeout orders. My fiancé and I were the second one waiting on pick ups. Confusions to no straight answers regarding how long til we can get our order. Mind you, the front desk was busy and the restaurant was jammed. After 10 minutes, I realized that there were literally 3 people working the front. One very confused worker in the front who was juggling pick up orders and taking orders from the dining room. A guy going in and out with table orders. And another lady who's probably getting lost in the commotion as well.
After 20 minutes of waiting, I was getting really annoyed, claustrophobic, hangry, and stressing if I'm PMSing or if it was Implantation bleeding cramps. 
In that 20 minutes, an older lady cancelled her entire order, another asked for a manager, and many walked out due to an over capacity dining room. 

*30 minutes later* my fiancé finally decided to ask again how long until we get our order and even explained what time we placed an order etc. (honestly, he took it upon himself to ask bc he knew I was getting really impatient & really close to catching an attitude lol). One of the lady checked my confirmation number and ""realized"" our order was on the counter and my fiancé had to tell her ""wait. I've seen that sitting there for the last 10 minutes."" She explained that they had so much orders/calls etc. 

As an apology, she let us have two of the ""better than sex cake"" that I was gonna purchase along with our order, for free. 

Okay, we get it. I'd hate to have to work that shift either & hell I'd probably hide in the back TBH. I think they were just too under staff. That's the flaw I seen to why all these takeout orders where just flying pass thru them and customers were getting annoyed. But I have to give them props for keeping their cool bc if it had been me, I'd fire myself haha. This is where I had to knock out 2 stars.

The other 2 stars, I give it to the Mac n Cheese and that damn fall off the bone spare ribs. Jesus Christ I sweeear! Bonus was the better than sex cake that we got for free. Perfect blend of sweetness and texture! The mac n' cheese was creamy and didn't have such a strong cheese taste (you know that hint of bitterness from sharp cheddar kinda thing). 

Fiancé and I had a crappy day, but as we got to the drive-in theaters with our takeout food, we laughed about it and both agreed ""it was worth the wait!"" 
I raved to him about the Mac n cheese and he agrees ""this *takes a bite* THIS makes up for it!"" LMFAO. 

Maybe next time we'll just order delivery and/or not go in on a weekend lol.",qkJkmUC5axEPutcRUB17RA,0,0,3,CI6oY4_tWFlfG8aJmi_q7A

I usually get their baby back ribs and can almost never resist their desserts.  This is definitely my family's go-to place for barbecue.  I only give it 4 stars because I've had issues with their catering.  The first time we ordered for 4th of July and I had to return because they forgot the dessert.  The other time for Thanksgiving we had a scheduled pickup time for a fried turkey but waited over an hour because they said they had to give our turkey to someone else since they said other customers were not coming at their scheduled time.",ZIaVRJZW5pOIQYtR7yTyNg,0,0,4,MhqQI-L3hrENZyQWfACzDA

The ribs and brisket were incredibly dry, seemed like it had sat around for a few days, very salty, and quite inedible. Love to support small biz, but Seemed to be It's clear restaurant doesn't really care about quality or taste, worse than grocery store bbq. Yuk.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,0,0,1,i2QkKHVPmCz7d5RmBwqlMQ

I had the baby back ribs, beans, collard greens, mac & cheese (unreal!), and sweet potato pie.  Each was so very good, and at a very fair price.  Excellent service by super nice and friendly gals (special shout out to NicNic and Ducky!).

It's a casual place in a mini-mall, but with cute and authentic southern decor.  For a west-coast guy, I no longer felt like I was in Vegas, or back in LA where I live -- this transported me...and I loved it.

Oh yes, I'll be back, and I'm bringing ziplocs.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,8,10,4,d5tbhtrWi107yhrs8O69ZA

5983679,2013-03-27,0,Z1E36owKeeZKDL-9ZuanJw,"TC's specializes in down home cooking and Southern hospitality, and it definitely feels that way when you walk in.  The restaurant is comfortably decorated; I like the red tone to it.  And the menu is a simple size while still offering sufficient options.

The date and I each got our own 2 meat combo with 2 sides and cornbread.  I ordered the baby back ribs, beef brisket, mac and cheese, and Big Sam's baked beans.  Unfortunately, our meals came out sans cornbread, but we asked for it mid-meal and a piping hot paper tray of two pieces of cornbread (they were really muffins) came out.  No butter, not that I needed the calories, but it would've been a nice addition.  And they were just okay.

The baby back rib meat peeled off the bone easily with my fork.  The first bite made me nervous - it was dry.  I kept digging and the meat in the middle was moist.  I don't know what happened, but the moist rib meat was good.  The ribs tasted more steamed than BBQ'd though.  I was really craving a smokier flavor.

The beef brisket was good; it was tender and juicy.  It paired very well with their homemade BBQ sauce.

The mac and cheese and beans came out in styrofoam containers.  That made me nervous thinking that they store their premade sides in the containers and warm them up to order.  But, it did come in handy for taking the sides home since there were plenty of leftovers.  The cheese on the mac and cheese was clumpy and not melted into the normal smooth sauce I was expecting.  It was an odd consistency, but it tasted okay.  The beans were also okay.  Both benefited from a healthy shake of salt and pepper.

My favorite meat was actually the pork links that my date ordered.   They were perfectly salty and had a wonderful smokey char.  They were also beautifully grilled with lovely black grill marks.  I could've eaten just those and been happy all day.

In conclusion, it was okay, but unfortunately not the best BBQ in the valley.  Aside from the smokey flavor missing in some meats, we were also wondering where the BBQ smell was.  The restaurant and parking lot were both missing the potent and mouthwatering fragrance commonly associated with BBQ places.  This left us both to wondering where and how the meats were being prepared.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,5,0,3,iug_q7bOP72XtuEjRk6gkw
