I simply asked for extra lettuce in my salad for an extra fee and was told that they don't offer extra lettuce, that my request would result in my being charged the full price of an additional salad.  I told the server that I didn't  want another salad, I just wanted a little bit of extra lettuce and I am OK paying an up charge for it, but she explained to me that ""their portions are perfectly sized"" and that extra lettuce was not an option for me. How do you have a salad bar and not give people what they want when they are willing to pay a reasonable extra charge for it? My group and I just stopped right there and walked out. Can you imagine if I wanted extra tomatoes? I would have to buy 2 more salads just to get them!

385408,2017-09-05,0,Ye4uQAkfHbh8w0cCXCCLjQ,I love their food.. their fresh salads and soups are delicious. The service is great. A great place to eat lunch or dinner. They have sandwiches too I haven't tried them yet. One suggestion I would have is if they could be more informative on their menu by marking lactose free or gluten free choices. I don't like have to read the entire menu to make sure I'm not going to have cheese on my salad or dairy in My Soup....,oKhpMYvIntENZ5UzuoZWUg,0,0,5,PYBwJP587YCfd8cgnTW1rg

Today, we ate at the Boca Park location and were extremely disappointed.  The staff on the line were dripping soup down the sides of every bowl and take-out containers and using their dirty aprons to halfway wipe them down.  Gross!  

I asked to speak to a manager because I thought someone needed to be aware and get it handled, I was told he was too busy working the line to speak to me.  I told the staff I would wait, to which they then tried to offer me 1/2 off my lunch.  Again, I told them I would wait.  It wasn't about the cost of my lunch, but the poor customer experience they had created for me and everyone else watching the disaster area they were working in.  

The manager, Christian, finally came over and nodded his head while I spoke.  I feel like he could care less and was just doing what he needed to do to get back to the line. 

To top it all off, I sit down to cold food only to find a hair in my soup.  

Needless to say, we won't be going back to this location.  I understand speed is important, but if everyone is disappointed by the time they sit down, does it matter that it was fast?",zl4T9WtZi0TiIo2RFvc4Zw,1,0,1,waP6yBrDQnUpfJsAm3NaEA

AND, I won't be back.  I ordered the half salad half soup.  I almost had four small pieces of chicken in my salad,(smaller than a nickel, and seemed to be out of a can? not fresh cooked?) and the  rest of the ingredients did not taste fresh nor was there an abundance of anything but lettuce greens, which are very cheap to serve, so this manager is making up $$$ by skimping on the good stuff in my opinion.  The buttermilk dressing was like water.  The Lobster bisque was tasty, a little spicier than traditional bisque, and again I think I spotted a few microscopic pieces of lobster floating around in there with all the celery.  The one thing they did do well was their customer service and friendliness.  5 stars for that.  I don't understand who is rating this place as high as three or more stars.

Cafe Zupas was a cafe that opened up fairly recently, I never considered that it might be good because the zupas places I've been to are very bland or plain boring. I was pleasently surprised that this place was NOTHING like that.

I had the two for $8.99 and a drink $1.99, and for the ammount of food, I thought it was a great deal. Especially considering everything was made in front of you, it's like the better sister of Panera (which isn't bad but in comparison, Cafe Zupas is tastier). I had the pesto chicken and asian salad, which were definatly winners in my book. Then they gave me a bread roll and strawberry, I was confused (because I didn't expect to get either on of them) but I found out later that it was a complimentary thing they did.

But on to my favorite part, the drinks. The signature drinks were pretty epic. There are four of them, and in one sitting I made it a mission to try all of them! The lemonade and the one that tasted like a fresh orange juice were pretty tame. While the pomogranit and the cucumber one's were my favorite! Still, I'd be happy with any of them because they're all so refreshing and not overpowering.

Cafe Zupas is definately on the top of my list for places to go for lunch. Clean atmosphere, great food, delicious drinks, and music in the background made it a wonderful experiance.",nUthElms4cTpt1SsclztDQ,0,0,5,C1C9kjQNlABKTm9Q5B3e1w

I'm not a fan of the layout, it takes so long to get from the front door to the line and then having to rummage your way over through the tables was uncomfortable. I should have used the side door but wasn't sure if it was an emergency only door when I first arrived. 

I ordered the Mango Berry Salad, it was delicious I just wish they used spinach or a better type of leaf as some of mine were browning otherwise totally a great veggie salad! Also had a cup of soup which was perfect and exactly what I needed to end my day.

The Salad associate was very friendly, warm greeting loved interacting with her. The Soup associate was kind of rude and not friendly at all. The General Manager was very friendly but he made it awkward, very awkward when he kept thinking I was the mom of the kid in front of me in line....no sir I have no kids, nice of you to assume i'm a good mother but no that mother was sitting down and making her kid order all the food and pay not me. So it was just awkward having to stop him from letting the kid almost pay for my meal.

The ""bus girl"" was very nice, she wished me a good evening when I was getting my iced tea to go and that was unexpected. Overall I will totally be back especially for the free chocolate covered strawberry ;)",cFGAElozHTdQDfHimOiSBQ,5,3,4,8HY6HCbUflykHsC7WZTbVw

This place is basically a gimmick. 3 stars because it's edible and service was friendly and they give you a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry and cold roll to go with your meal.

Who is the owner of this franchise, Mr. Potter from It's A Wonderful Life???

I got the soup & salad combo, which is like $9.
You get six items for your salad and then look out!!
A - LA - CART like you've never seen in your entire life.

When they scoop your items, they have this slotted spoon that is the equivalent of a tablespoon.

So if you're getting sunflower seeds, you may get a decent amount.
But for vegetable items, fuh-git-abo-it!

Can you envision a tablespoon of whole cucumbers, not even chopped up?
That's like five slices of a small cucumber.

Can you envision a tablespoon of cherry tomatoes?
That's three halves!

Can you envision a tablespoon of red peppers that are julienned?
That's two slices!!

It's utterly astounding that someone took estimating the food cost to this extreme.

They're making the salad and I'm like...""That's it???""

Then I got my soup.
They have a ladle and you can only get one ladle full, even though it only fills the bowl 2/3rds.
The presentation is awful.
There is ZERO VALUE in this place.

Then they offer you fried onions for your soup. 
Sure! Love some!!

Oh wait!
You get only a tablespoon full for $.69!!!
You get the TINIEST amount and you have to pay for it!

Like they give you a garnish amount and charge you!!
They are literally insane.

Then my friend got her soup and she had more than I did so I asked them to put more in my bowl.

The cashier employee can't make that executive decision so I asked for a manager.
She said the manager was busy training someone.

I informed her that there was nothing going on that was more important than making a customer happy.

She was waiting for the manager who was in our view, to stop talking and then she would inform her that she was needed.

SHE'S THE MANAGER!! Duh! Call her over you passive wall flower.

I told the manger that I wanted more soup because my friend had more.
So instead of just spooning more soup into my bowl, she was going to take my bowl and THROW IT OUT, 
And I quote...""reportion"" it for me.
Can you imagine???
Re-portion!!

She'd rather throw out a whole serving than take the ladle and spoon a bit more.

That's when I knew that the manager had zero critical thinking skills.
This place might as well be run by robots.

You can get 2 lbs of food at Chipotle for the same price of their bowl of lettuce and half a bowl of soup.

You can go a few doors down to Jason's Deli and get an ALL YOU CAN EAT salad bar with 30 items on it, including muffins, chocolate mouse, ice cream Sundays, hummus, crackers, bread potato salad, pasta salads, and go up as many times as you like for $9 bucks.

You can go to Pieology and get unlimited toppings on your pizza for the same price as this place sells you a bowl of lettuce with vinegar on it.

Take my word for it.
Even if the food is good, there is ZERO VALUE in the portions.
Whoever is the cheapest person you know on the planet, the owners of this place are cheaper.

We then went to Jason's Deli, with complete regret that we wasted $22 at this place and left hungry.

We got a kid's salad bar (one trip) for $4.95, which includes a bottle of water, and a kid's macaroni & cheese, which is delicious beyond words, just like you made as a kid, but perfect, and includes a bottle of water. 

For $10 we got more food from Jason's Deli than $22 at this wacko joint.

Oh and as for the service at Zuppa's, only one of five people behind the counter has a smile on her face.

At Jason's Deli, they all have smiles and gave us VALUE for our money.
Get that Zuppa owners??? VALUE.",1JW3rbxP2WpnXYOeMyKEWg,0,0,1,AQI_wPAk4zErvH7HuSz54Q
2077474,2017-09-21,2,Ye4uQAkfHbh8w0cCXCCLjQ,"I've never had Cafe Zupas before but me likey. It's fast casual style where you order at the counter, but it resembles a cafeteria line more than anything. The first person you encounter starts the sandwich or salad, and as you make your way down the line to soups, you are greeted by someone new. They plate your soup, and the third person puts your order together and takes payment. Then you can seat yourself in the dining room if you are eating in. 

I chose the pick 2 combo which includes a whole sandwich and either half of a salad or a cup of soup. I chose the ultimate grilled cheese as my sandwich and the Wisconsin cauliflower soup. I like that you can try samples of the soup since there are a bunch to choose from, and I always have a hard time deciding what to get. 

The ultimate grilled cheese is cheddar and muenster cheeses, tomatoes, and a homemade pesto spread on a white or wheat cibiatta. Then it's toasted on the panini so it's hot and melty. It was really one of the better grilled cheeses that I've had. The soup was amazing as well. It was cheesy and delicious, and reminded  me of a potato soup except it was cauliflower so it's healthier! At least we'll go with that. 

Now that it's fall they have fall themed items like a turkey, cranberry and brie sandwich, and pumpkin spice creme brulee. I will definitely come back here to satisfy my salad and soup cravings.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,3,4,svFBpZFRMIslebcKhM8Wyg

One of my favorite choices is the California cob salad and the garden veggie chowder soup. Highly recommend both.  

They always give you a chocolate covered strawberry and a piece of bread!

This place is actually pretty good for lunch time. I didn't leave the place feeling unsatisfied. The assistant manager was very hospitable and nice. They are looking to hire, so you can stop by this location and pick up an application. 

I ordered Pesto Chicken panini, mangoberry salad, and the Clam chowder. I honestly loved the mangoberry salad. The sweetness of the salad dressing and the mangos complemented each other. I'm not a fiend for much bread meals, but the panini were like any other panini you would order elsewhere. If you dip their panini in their clam chowder soup, it tastes better. Their bread rolls were cold. I tried my sister's tomato basil soup and it was really sweet. It wasn't creamy at all.

Every salad option looks appetizing.  I like one to fill me up since they're just greens.  The Thai Coconut Tofu protein salad bowl does just that!

I'm peculiar about the way they fill their soup bowls though.  Is it by weight or does it depend who's serving?  Well a half order is already a premade bowl so if its by weight that's just ppptthhh.  I'll give em yay points for their soup selections anyway.  So far I've tasted three - all really good.  I don't yet have a favorite.  The great thing is they allow you to taste it before you order.

Dessert is available! Yeah-uusss... Not too many selections, but its nice they sell it, especially their creme brulees.  Yep go ahead LOOK and STARE.  

The customer service greetings are pretty general: Hi welcome! How are you? For here or to go? Would you like to try a sample? Will there be anything else for you? Can I offer you a dessert? There you go kids... if you're about to start the job experience workforce in foodservice, that's my 10 cents right there.

Customers walk thru a people guided ordering system.  With their sometimes long lines, it helps and the lines flow pretty quickly.  The pay system is also jiffy; run your card, no signature, and your receipt spits out.  Have a nice day!

This place is located on Charleston Blvd not too far from highways so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park.

We decided to take a panini and a salad since they offer both for $8.99. Service was pretty fast even though we waited in line quite a bit, but they food itself was good. This is a typical ""fast-food type"" kind of little place where you pay at the counter when you order.

I have come to this new location a handful of times and only the last 2 times did I notice that two different people both would have their clear gloves on to handle food then afterwards grab a dirty white rag to then clean their station and then go back to handling food. Mind you this rag is dirty and is pulled from underneath or from the other side where more dirt and dust collects on it and it's sole purpose is to clean dirt so you can image how I cringed when I noticed they touched food right after with the same gloves. 

This is a health cleanliness code issue for me and I would think it was for others. I noticed that a few places do this as it is so easy to forget to change your gloves but I strongly think this needs to be an INFORCED RULE as I do not want to now eat my sandwiches after they have been touched by a dirty rag prior. It  is very unfortunate because I really do like their menu. 

Other than that--customer service and smiles are great and consistent. 

Also the togo containers are great for half and half choices but NOT for a whole fill salad-reaaon being that there is a divider in the container and it's hard to mix your salad with the dressing. The smart thing to do would have a clear round container strictly for dull size salads just a thought. 

Lastly- it would be nice if the menu or online provided the calorie counts. Of fast food venues can provide this why can't Zuppas. How have they not thought of this!!?",6iNeElU0lFkKdBu3wAzEBw,4,2,2,yT8rDb7t5LV2_1arzjpYuQ

4312342,2018-03-08,9,Ye4uQAkfHbh8w0cCXCCLjQ,"Maybe I just haven't researched enough yet, but there are not enough places with good soup near my home (in South Bay LA). I would LOVE for Café Zupas to come to my 'hood! 

My Mommy brought me here when I was visiting her a year or so ago. She already knew what she wanted so I felt kind of bad for her because as soon as I saw the options for soups and salads and sammiches AND learned I could try all of the soups, I knew we would be there for a while.
I've been to this and another location in Vegas a couple of times each (usually in the evening) and there's never been an especially long line or wait even though it's always pretty busy.

Service has always been on point except the first time I came. There was a young man who seemed irritated that I had so many questions. I'm a curious person! He seemed fine with giving me samples of almost literally every soup they had to offer, but he didn't seem to want to answer questions about them. Once he saw I wasn't going to give up, he chilled and then seemed to become my best friend!

I like that the soups are so full of flavor! My Mommy said she finds some of them too salty but sista likes salt so that doesn't bother me - I didn't find anything too salty. I went once when I was partial (Daniel) fasting and the veggie soup with quinoa HIT THE SPOT! It was delicious! I didn't feel like I was skimping on good taste at all! I also like that there are a plethora of toppings I can add to my soups and salads to make my own creations. 

All in all, there is nothing I have ordered on the menu I didn't like. Everything tastes fresh and well made. No complaints there. You get a roll and a chocolate-covered strawberry with your purchase. This is nice, in theory, but let me tell you my gripe with this... the roll is just okay. Sista loves bread but I don't have to have this particular bread. And most people adore chocolate-covered strawberries. I don't. So this leads to my two complaints...

1) Café Zupas charges extra for EVERYthing you add to ANYthing!
2) And they will not do 

I TOTALLY get that they are a for-profit entity and that it costs to be in business. And I get that I can be a pain in the rear as I modify their selections by adding and taking away. BUT they encourage me to add all kinds of stuff, and I think the cost of those additions is a little steep for as much as you get. And to charge me for onions on half a sandwich (not even grilled onions or special color onions) is ridiculous. Plus they said they said they couldn't add the onions to the sandwich for me. They ended up putting some on the side so I could add it myself, but really?!? 

I don't know... I'd rather add something like onions for free than have okay bread or a chocolate-covered strawberry. But I could be the minority.
And this won't stop me from returning! And wishing Café Zupas would open locations in California!

My only complaint is you give me a plastic container to hold my sandwich.  A BIG container... and then everything else is thrown in the bag individually.  Why when the plastic clear box looks to hold everything inside? I found this frustrating when trying to figure out who's sandwich goes with which soup, etc.  The boxes look like they should contain one complete order inside.  There are 3 people working the counter - 2 cashiers and 1 just to pack the items.  It wouldn't hurt to take the time to pack it right so it's easy to carry out.

I am a huge fan of the food, especially the salads. The ingredients are all fresh, every time. No brown or wilted produce. Everything is made when you order. I have tried many different salads, and I have not been disappointed. 

The down sides to Cafe Zupas are portion size and price. At around $10 a meal, the portion size seems less than adequate. In fact, I have seriously left still feeling hungry. 

Meals come with a roll (depending on what you order). I don't get the roll. It's served cold, every time. Cold and hard.

I ordered a California Cobb salad and he forgot to include the hard boiled egg. I caught it because i was watching. Same mistake was made with my wife's salad. She was very annoyed. Not 100% true to the menu. Secondly, there are several tables that needed to be cleared of dirty dishes left behind as we searched for a clean place to dine.

Positives ... everything is house made and fresh. The menu is basically salad, soup and sandwiches. The menu is right up my alley and most everything is quality ingredients. The employees here need training and it shows. The employees are standing around talking and there are at least 5 tables with dirty dishes sitting there since we walked through the door. Nobody wants to dine in a restaurant that has no urgency to keep things clean.

So if any of you foodies are looking for another option besides white bread they do have a substitution of wheat. They have their try 2 combo for $8.99, my personal dynamic duo is the strawberry harvest with chicken and the pesto chicken sandwich, or the Yucatan tortilla chicken soup and the glaze pork salad! It comes with a complementary bread and strawberry and towards the end of the line they have delicious creme brûlées. You are greeted at the front by their greeter where he/ she explains the entire menu and ordering process, from there you would tell the person at the front of the sale station your salad or sandwich order (if you are also or only getting soup then you would proceed down the line at their soup station!), next another person will ask you what was in your order at the dessert case to put it together on a tray - CAFE STYLE, last you'd pay.

I'm not sure if a manager or chef has changed at this location recently, but it's been disgusting the last 4 times. My kids chicken fingers were cold and had a strange odor, the lettuce in my strawberry harvest salad was huge chunks (normally shredded), the chicken in the salad tasted like it went bad so I ended up throwing it away. Also they barely put any toppings on the salad, it's ridiculous.

The last time I got the winter wellness bowl it was also large chunks of kale instead of shredded and whomever made the salad dressing that day put an enormous amount of maple syrup and it ruined the whole bowl. Initially I was so impressed with the cleanliness of this place, but now the workers don't pay attention. I had the guy at the cash register checking me out with his gloves on handing me my change and then he went switched places with someone and went over to make my salad grabbing everything with his gloves he used to touch coins/cash. Another guy wipes his nose on his gloves every time I come in. I understand people have itches and have runny noses during flu season but I don't want to get sick, step 1: say excuse me & and have someone fill in, step 2: go blow your nose in the bathroom 3: wash hands, 4: put on new gloves.

I was asked what food I ordered at dessert area...then one step to the right the cashier asked what I ordered again so she can ring it up. So after repeating the same answers, at the end they have you say your whole specific order (annoying when you order for a whole family).

My husband had the chipotle chicken salad - he didn't like the amount of dressing but that could easily be fixed by asking the staff to go light on the dressing. I also had the veggie sandwich which was disappointing. My husband also had the chicken pesto panini which lacked all flavor. The pesto was remiss in that it seemed non existent. The sandwich was also a tad messy in that it seemed to be heavy on the sauce. 

The thing that seemed to be a little ridiculous was that they charged .69 for croutons. This was a condiment cup size of croutons. It just seemed a little unnecessary. They did provide a dinner roll for both meals purchased. But I would have rather had croutons than a free dinner roll. Also the chocolate covered strawberries were a nice touch and delicious. We decided to try the mixed berry creme brule - which was more like a pudding than a custard. Also a little dull in flavor.  

Finally, the store only offers traditional sugar and Splenda. If you aren't partial to those options then too bad. Overall the price of the food for what was given wasn't impressive. I think we will stick with Panera bread for now.",kM70xTwz9sAJ3Zc6AdCLHg,2,2,3,SZmRLb27fI_KVMZhLgQ3Lg

Horrific stun tunes blare over what sounds like a cheap boombox. This is what the dining public seems to crave, so the typical Yelper will give Zupas five stars for atmosphere.

As you walk in you are confronted by a bevy of order takers, soup getters and salad fixers doing their best to cope with the stressful conditions.  They are lined up cheek by jowl, invading each other's personal space.  Everyone's shouting, so you can't hear what's being said.  I said ""huh?"" to one and he snappishly repeated himself.  Luckily printed menus are available.  No way could I read the complicated agate type posted on the wall.  

The sparse sandwich ingredients are squeezed within crusty Ciabatta. You need a good set of choppers to blast through the slabs.  Mine was a turkey-spinach-artichoke (TSA).  There was no identifiable taste of artichoke.  Not much taste of anything for that matter.   I had a Try 2 Combo, which leaves about a cup of soup.  My New England clam chowder (with bacon) was tasty.  An extra star.

A chocolate-dipped strawberry was included with our meals.  Is this just a grand opening treat?  Will they charge for it later?

For gadget addicts, Zupas has a ""charge bar"" where you can plug in.
