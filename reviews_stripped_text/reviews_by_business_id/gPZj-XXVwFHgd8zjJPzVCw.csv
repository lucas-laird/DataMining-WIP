Not that anyone is going to honestly read a review before getting Subway or not, but I just left and Ashley could not have been a better representative of Subway. Fast service, super nice and polite, and full of energy. Thx",_jFHwi2qvWfLKib9sH71HQ,2,0,5,2dkLciLy_CZas1Xnhp1fnA

Without even asking, he assumes what kind of subway will be on the bread (we had 2 types of bread).  My husband corrected him politely and the man just got so annoyed which he displayed with his actions (stopped in his tracks looking at us like we were speaking a foreign language like. . . how dare we!).  Then he roughly snatches the cold cuts he put on the bread and throws it on the other bread.  He then kept flinging our breads to make room for the next customers behind us.  We really should of walked out but we were trying to not let this ruin our day.  I was appalled by his actions as we were giving his store business (a good thing) and we were treated like crap like we were doing a bad thing giving his store business.  Uggh.  Anyhow, it used to be owned by a nice Asian family that ALWAYS gave great service but I think the store changed owners and the service is now HORRIBLE.  Will NEVER go back there again.",w-zi0RgOysq_xNrQQUGGeA,0,0,1,f5U67RWVM3SSaKjVgL2mlw

She was the nicest sandwich artist I've ever met and whoever runs this place needs to give her a promotion or a raise or a high-five at least!

2595422,2018-05-04,0,gPZj-XXVwFHgd8zjJPzVCw,"I've been scrolling through the reviews for this place and they're all nothing like what IVE experienced personally at this place.
Or maybe it's just cause I go during graveyard hours. 
The service in terms of customer service is just fine but the speed of every employee working graveyard is just so inadequate.
I'm always there for several minutes even when I'm at the store alone. 
The problem seems to be that their are always new hires due to the amount of people that are continuously quitting from that location. I still go though so I guess I'm part of the problem",oSAOWaULFDU0ETfnHyU3pw,0,0,1,0mxWKBZLroe7dr6CnSIUvg

4895605,2016-04-18,2,gPZj-XXVwFHgd8zjJPzVCw,"First of all, I know. This is Subway and it's weird to write a review. However, the experience last night was SO BAD that it had to be written.

Went for a quick lazy Sunday sandwich pickup last night. 2 young girls were working and seemed friendly. They were having issues with the toaster oven and several people were already waiting ahead of us for toasting purposes. Cold sandwich? Eh, better than waiting. So they started the process with us. 

I asked for ""a turkey sandwich on wheat"". The first girl misunderstood me THREE TIMES in thinking I said I wanted ""8 turkey sandwiches on wheat "". Not sure what part of my 2 person, yoga pants, let-me-get-back-to-netflix aura made her think I'd want to cater a party. Once it was established that I wanted just 1 sandwich, she moved forward in the slowest meat/cheese/veggies assembly imaginable. 

Asked for spinach. Received 4 carefully placed spinach leaves. Asked for more, she literally placed 2 more. On a foot long sandwich. Same with peppers and tomatos. At this point, thinking a veggie shortage must be happening, I asked for a shake of salt and pepper and moved to the payment area. During this whole time, several people were getting angry about the girls not knowing how to reset the oven. For whatever reason, they kept taking orders for hot sandwiches and only THEN telling the customers about the oven and the long queue waiting. Not sure how that turned out.

A very disturbing observation: Yes, they wore gloves. No, they never took them off. For anything. The girls used the gloves to push buttons on the oven, to process payment, everything. There really isn't a point to wearing them if you touch everything with them. 

Finally home, my husband and I happily sit down to continue our Community binge watching session with some mediocre sandwiches to round out the weekend. First bite...AHHHHH! This girl had literally put so much salt and pepper on our sandwiches that there was a visible layer of black among the veggies. I know that I didn't watch while she added this since I was getting ready to pay, but no one expects more than a quick shake. This was enough to season meat for a full meal for 8 people. Literally could taste nothing but salt and pepper. 

If the employees had seemed competent, we would have taken the subs back and just asked for a refund. We knew this was not the case (there was no manager there either) and that we'd be met with blank stares, so we just threw them away. Such a waste of time.

Moral of the story: Don't go to this Subway unless your taste buds are dead.",0maoX6ThBp8ehhTag4MLTw,3,0,1,OFDQd3ThJLn1tyS3-RKxGQ

We will never eat here again. Unfortunate because we live across the street. We've been trying to call you all morning and you don't answer your phones. It's pretty ridiculous.

I didn't get the rotisserie chicken- it looked good but another reviewer said it gave them food poisoning.  That likely came from the distributor, not the store.  There is no raw chicken at subways and I don't think the rotisserie it there.  Anyway, try this sandwich for breakfast: ham, egg, cheese, spinach and black pepper on wheat roll.
