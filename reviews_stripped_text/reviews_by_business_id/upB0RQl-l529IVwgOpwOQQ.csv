Went there for the first time today for lunch.  I had the chicken souvlaki plate which came with either french fries or rice, Greek salad, Tzatziki sauce and pita bread.  I choose the french fries for my plate.  I love it that I have choices on what sides I want on my plate.  

It came with 2 skewers of chicken with like 6 pieces on each. The chicken tasted great and was cooked prefect.  The side Greek salad was real fresh with plenty of veggies and tasted real good.  The french fries were cooked prefect crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The Tzatziki sauce was fantastic almost as good as my mom's.  The pita bread came out nice and warm and tasted good too.  I asked for extra onions on my salad and on the side which they gladly gave me no extra charge.  The plate cost $12.95 so price was not too expensive for all the food you get.  There was plenty of condiments, napkins and etc on the counter and on the tables. It was enough food to keep me full all day.

The guy that took my order was real nice and answered all my questions.  The food came out pretty quickly and looked nice.  The place was real clean plenty of different seating areas.  I will be back for sure as a matter of fact thinking about going there for lunch tomorrow already.",PAvUfCRzSSl97v5M3ddUfw,0,0,5,CMJKrzo0V7QFKLkk5Bw8XQ

I ordered the same thing. When I approached the cashier/waiter/busser, the bald guy, he gave me an attitude. I asked what was taking long and his remark was (it's only been 18 minutes). The cooks heard him and looked at me from the window. The other lady worker apologized. I wanted to ask the bald guy how long his lunch break was and if he could scarf down the food in 12 minutes.

I had the Great Greek Gyro and it was packed with flavorful beef/lamb meat.  It is clear that they make their own tzatziki sauce because it was just so fresh and tasty.  The cashier talked me into the feta fries and I will be indebted to her forever.  They are a must get every time.  My wife had a salad with a chicken skewer.  She hasn't stopped talking about it.  The veggies were so fresh and the chicken was tender and had great flavor.  Do yourself a favor and save some room for dessert.  The rice pudding and baklava ice cream are both outstanding.  

The restaurant is clean and the decor is very tasteful.

I came with the expectations of another similar Greek restaurant. I love the grilled chicken/shrimp Greek salad from the restaurant I usually go to so of course I had to try it here. The chicken skewer here was extremely dry, no flavor to them at all, almost like they were over cooked. The salad was alright, lettuce was extremely huge so I had to cut them down with a knife to eat them comfortably. Overall I just wasn't too impressed with the salad that I love so dearly at the other restaurant. Perhaps maybe I'll try their other meat options next time if I ever decide to come back.

First time we came here, I ordered a falafel pita and was disappointed by what I got. Instead of getting light and fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the outside falafels, I got mushy falafels that were falling apart. I didn't think too much of it and attributed it to probably a bad batch. Came again today thinking it might be different, but what I got were still the same mushy, soggy, broken down falafels. They didn't even hold their shape when I got them! It would have been okay if it still had that crispy exterior, but even that was non-existent. To top it all off, we waited for my hubby's Greek salad with chicken for more than 15 minutes, while other people, who ordered the same thing after us, got theirs first. He finally went up to the lady to ask why it was taking so long, and lo and behold, his order was just sitting there on the counter. By the time we got his order, the chicken was no longer hot-- heck it wasn't even warm to say the least. We gave them a second chance, and were still sadly let down.

2200800,2017-07-26,0,upB0RQl-l529IVwgOpwOQQ,"I was THRILLED...that The Great Greek opened a restaurant in the Southwest area of the valley. I have previously eaten at their Henderson location - quite frequently and loved it. For a brand new restaurant, you would have no idea, because the team that is in place there knows what they are doing. They offer fast, friendly and accurate customer service. There is no different in the food from location to location - at least that I am able to tell anyway. 

From this restaurant, I've had the Grilled Garlic Shrimp and the Grilled Steak Souvlaki with Feta Fries - Both were excellent and will satisfy any craving that you're having, especially the Feta Fries. In terms of desert the Baklava is the best that I've ever had. A few weeks ago, I took a friend from Oklahoma here while he was in town and he described the Baklava as ""being the best he's ever had outside of Greece."" 

There is good seating indoor and outdoor. With long lines it can get a little tight, but that's just part of living in a city like Las Vegas. The restaurant does to-go orders, but you have to place the order in the store. Once this location is able to handle online orders I will be more apt to grab dinner. This reason, and because they ran out of rice at 8:30pm on a Tuesday night (it was close to closing time) is the reason for a four star rating.

I've never had anything bad or disappointing here, and the kids like it. Even the picky one likes it because it's simple. We usually get chicken or steak souvlaki when we are there, and it's offered with fries or rice pilaf not also comes with a really good side Greek salad. The kids plates aren't quiet half price and come with one skewer instead of two. I order the full size and they split it. 

Yesterday they were offering a special of mousakka (sp) and it was really good. It's egg plant, ground beef, potatoes and bechamel sauce  it also came with the side salad. 

I recommend the feta fries, falafels, hummus with pita, cookies and baklava as well. We don't always get those but they never disappoint.

With that said The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill in my opinion is not the greatest Greek you can get in town. Meraki Greek Grill or Shish Kabob House is a much fresher choice for the same value. I found the Grilled Chicken Souvlaki plate ($14.02 w/tax) at the Great Greek to be dry and mildly flavorful. The rice pilaf was cooked properly and probably my favorite part of the dish. The feta on the salad was fresh as well as the other ingredients, olive garden should ask for their vinaigrette recipe its pretty dang good! So I would have to give their salad an A+. I would cover dessert but when I was in line ordering I asked if I could get a order of Baklava but I was informed they where out (this was at about 8:15 pm they close at 9 pm). A customer behind me, which ordered (5) orders of baklava ice cream told me that the baklava dessert was awesome, sad to say I didn't get to try it. That actually might get me to go back on another night when I want a quick and easy fix for some Greek food, that and the salad. Other than that I am traveling to Meraki off Trop and rainbow. The Great Greek does stay open a little later than others so that is another plus and actually the reason I tried them in the first place, as Meraki closes at 8:30 pm. the owner was there the night I came in, great operator, friendly staff, clean establishment.

Service has been top notch every time, with speedy serve times and plenty of staff to handle lines. It is an order at counter style eatery, so no table service.

Had the steak with the rice bowl and asked for medium but instead got way well done not to mention it was so little meat it really wasn't even worth adding to all the greens and barely any rice. I also added the Mezze Plate so I could try a few of my favorite Greek items. The Spanakopita was the best I've ever had, the Dolmades were really tiny and had no flavor, the Falafels were really dark brown which I can assume was way over cooked, the Tzatziki sauce was watery, and the Hummus was extremely lemony.

The food is good, but nothing that will particularly blow you away. The tzatziki was noticeably creamier than other tzatziki sauces I've had in the past. It was an interesting change of textures, but was slightly ruined by the fact that they LAYERED that s*** on my gyro.

Since it's a little over 10 minutes from my office, I decided to try ordering from Grubhub for the first time. Before I placed my order it said ""total time will be 30-40 mins"". AFTER I placed the order it turned into 90 mins! Yikes! So.. I decided to cancel my Grubhub order and just go to the place directly.

I drive the 10+ minutes, park, and when I walk inside there is a huuuge line and only one person working the counter. I'm waiting for at least 10 minutes which seems silly - why not have at least one more person working the register so they can handle the crowd more? On top of that, the person at the counter was also taking ordering calls so we had to wait for her to finish making the line move even slower. I was almost ready to bail but since I had waited this long (and made the trek), I decided to stay.

When I finally got up to the front, ordering was thankfully fairly smooth. I got my food to go and when I asked, I was told it would be another 15 minutes for it to be ready. I wish the lady behind the counter would have volunteered that information instead of me having to ask after I placed the order. But once again, I'm already committed, so might as well ..
 
Ordering food to-go is kind of weird because they don't give you a number and there's really no where to sit and wait. I didn't want to take up a spot at the table for people dining in since it was already crowded, but I didn't want to stand because it was gonna be at least 15 minutes? So the whole thing just felt weird and clunky. I saw a lot of people get to-go orders so I would have thought they'd have a better process.

After a few minutes, I decided to check on my order, and I found that my original Grubhub order was actually made instead of being cancelled. I panicked because I had just placed an order for the same exact thing. The lady at the register assured me my order had been cancelled and so I wouldn't be charged (even though it was made). At the same time, the order I had placed a few minutes ago came out, so she packaged that. While I thought she would just give me the second cancelled order as a nice gesture since it was already there and ready, she instead put it to the side and had zero interest in offering it to me. This was a huge disappointment as other places happily offer me ""mistake orders"" all the time. I mean the food wasn't cheap to begin with. But, since I had to get back to work, I didn't want to fight it.

And as for the food? It was just okay, but definitely not worth the hassle. The steak was decent but the lamb was super tough. I got it medium - which the lady recommended - so I don't know if it should have been cooked less or what. I was also REALLY hyped about the feta fries, but when I got them they were way too cheesy. They also didn't taste very feta to me? If you love cheese then you'll be fine, but if you're looking for more crispy fries with feta accents (like other places I've been to), I think you'll be disappointed.

Overall I'm hesitant to recommend this place for lunch. If you do, order ahead or be prepared for a long wait.",pWlelwBYGwvzISHzauw6-A,1,1,3,bN3CVz4HW47Ia8OTeIIljA

We frequent Greek/Mediterranian establishments quite often due to our diets, and this has risen quickly to the upper ranks of our list.

You go to the counter to order, and the food is brought to the table by a runner.  Drinks are self serve.  The tea is fresh brewed, so that's a huge plus.

All of the staff members were super friendly and helpful. 

The menu has a large variety including avgolemono soup, all types of skewers, and even baklava ice cream.  Prices are very reasonable.  An add-on skewer (shrimp, chicken, lamb, beef, salmon) is only $3.75. The kid's menu is fantastic.  They offer gyros and skewers, not just the usual chicken tenders kid's fare.  As someone who has a very restricted diet, I appreciate that I can get skewers separately or a decent kid's plate without a hassle or a weird upcharge.


I got the plated gyro from the kid menu and my husband got the regular gyro plate.  He substituted additional salad for rice at the suggestion of staff.  It has to have been one of the freshest salads I've seen in town.  I don't even like tomatoes, but they looked glorious.  My kid plate was larger than I expected.  I don't know that it would be a full meal for most adults, but it would definitely not fall too short.

The food was fresh, super tasty, and very filling.  The Tzatziki was wonderful. The gyro meat was nicely carved and wasn't overly seasoned.  The pita was not as soft as I would have liked, but not because it was old or stale. I believe it may have been baked just a little too long.

Overall it was a nice experience and very convenient for the SW end of town. I look forward to a return visit to try the skewers and soup.",TFfFBvt2GM7uj3LmLie_7w,6,5,4,PDM9nyFyKh7qvbe4jR3Enw

Looking for a place to eat and chitchat with a dear friend, we happened upon the Great Greek.  She had her one-year-old with her so we wanted to find some place appropriate, accommodating, and with indoor seating.  It was quite packed when we got there, with no seats left inside (only tall counter area left, which is kind of difficult to manage with a one-year-old).  Before we walked out, one of the servers / food runners saw us and told us to hold on because a couple tables were getting ready to leave soon.  He told us that he'd clean it up right away and get us a highchair, too.  I thought it was amazing that he even spotted us in the midst of all the food running and the fact that it was quite busy.  It's not a waiter-type of restaurant; it's the order-at-the-counter-and-get-a-table-tent-number-type of restaurant, but still.  

The food was just as good.

The hummus was absolutely delicious.  Not the overly fancy kind where they try to throw everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Just straight up good hummus.  

The gyro was rather large, which was great because I was super hungry.  I enjoyed it.  The vegetables were fresh and the meat was tender and flavorful.  

The baklava was good, but different.  Kind of tasted like cereal, granola, and really tasty honey.

Overall, I really liked this place.  It's a cute, casual spot that's great for catching up with friends or grabbing a bite with family.  Nice, friendly, and helpful staff.  Would recommend and would definitely go back.",U-7EVbeRf1wlSZfHW_gujQ,12,11,4,bchNtwtiDLLBYSAUzEdDdg
3791526,2017-08-24,0,upB0RQl-l529IVwgOpwOQQ,"Well, this was a surprise!

The husband and I were craving Greek food and he remembered seeing this place ""coming soon"" not too far from the house. We swung by tonight and, in all honesty, I was expecting decent grub and a so-so atmosphere. It was far better than that.

The place itself is very nicely put together, especially considering it falls under the ""fast casual"" umbrella. Beautiful wood on the walls, lots of planters, nice lighting, lovely tables all with vases and fresh flowers. It was very inviting. Also, food is served on real plates with real silverware and the plates have a kind of pottery look and feel to them which adds to the overall effect.

But more importantly - the food!

We ordered two gyro combos; my husband's had feta mine didn't. Both were the lamb/beef combo with juicy fresh tomatoes, red onion, deliciously fluffy and thick tzatziki sauce, and a scrumptiously fluffy pita to hold it all together. Guys, it was phenomenal! Meat was tender and delicious, veggies were on point, and the sauce was addictive.

I had rice pilaf as a side (yummy!) and the hubs had the feta fries. The feta fries were a revelation. Perfect spuds with feta and tons of oregano mixed throughout (I hate it when there's only cheese on top!) and cooked together into a creamy, gooey, crispy, unctuous mass of magic. I stole many of his fries and husband is a good man because he let me. 

We also got some eggplant dip as an appetizer and it was very good. All good was ordered at the counter but brought to your table. Service was wonderful, extremely friendly and genuine.

I short, I'd go back in a heartbeat. The only problem is deciding whether to eat that amazing gyro again or try something else because the whole menu looks awesome.",cB1pgndvG47P8XkeDa-7PQ,0,0,5,aG7U0PpWT_C6G6z_hxYaHw

The rest can do what they were doing which is one busing and the other running food. The guy at the register should not bounce back and forth between the two registers, you made the wait time horrendous.

1st time: we just wanted to know about their combos. When the call was answered we were asked if we cold be placed in hold. The wait time wasn't long at all but the woman at the other end of the phone was EXTREMELY rude and hung up on us before we could ask all of our questions. We only had two.... 

2nd time: same thing.

3rd time: our order arrived between 45-60 min after we pressed, which was expected but our order was incorrect. When we called back the same woman from the first two called answered and continued to be very rude. And again hung up.We just wanted to let them know that what we presented was not prepared how we ordered it.  

All though our order was incorrect, it was very good. There's no question that they have good food. The reason for two stars is because of the customer service we received.

Holy Greek.  I am very fond of good grilled food.  As soon as I saw this place I was curious.  I've been eating lots of fried foods and I want to see what the buzz was all about.  Holy yum. Me and my wife had the salmon salad, grape leaf wraps, and I got the chicken gyro.  The portions was just right and the meat was cooked to perfection.  The prices here are super good and the wait staff was friendly.  If you're a vegetarian or a omnivore like myself this place has all the right choices.

Everything sounded beyond appetizing! We decided on a few appetizers, a salad, and some fries, but then I noticed they were offering a special that included a few of the items we were ordering. So we decided to get that and split it. I wanted the greek salad, hummus, and fires....but I was worried that us splitting the meal would leave us hungry.....boy was I wrong!!!!

The ladies behind the front counter continued to bring us parts of our order, as soon as they were ready...and I thought it would never end! I do wish the tomatoes for the salad were cut a tad smaller.....but that's just because I need to be able to shovel the yummy foods in faster! 

Everything we tried was fresh and more than I expected for the prices. Our table was cleaned as soon as we finished each plate, and everyone was beyond kind and helpful. I look forward to making another trip here very soon and highly recommend you do as well!",YjLhBgezVRZqbXhIsnfgMA,4,0,5,ilX6nXEEOflKsi-yOljBUg

We ordered the traditional Gyro (beef/lamb). It was a HOT mess! Everything was falling apart. The sauce was overpowering and I couldn't taste the flavor of the meat. The meat was cut carelessly. Some where thick, some were thin and some were super thick. The feta fries were very sad. Served ""cold"" where the feta was just blooped on top. Was difficult to eat as well. 

Ordered a chicken fingers kids meal and it was overpriced. Came with three very small pieces of chicken, fries and salad. 

Place was packed, clean and LOUD!

Half of my family is Greek so I compare and contrast to Aunts and Grandmothers recipes handed down for generations. I will be going back very soon to try the rest of the menu. I had the Greek Pastitsio and Avgolemeno soup and they gave me a greek salad on the side (may have actually been too much food, even for me). i give the Pastitsio an 8 out of 10 just because NOBODY makes it like my grandmother but this is pretty darn good. - the Avgolemeno soup however I will give a 9.5 - i will say this was one of the best tasting lemon soups with chicken i have ever had. I am extremely impressed. I was so into the food i completely forget to make some food porn images. I will take more when I go back.",xuhJAY3E_er9z5KKs2oGFQ,0,0,5,hWCN0g8QUCCgWhJS19Hvsw

We are really pleased to finally have a spot in the neighbourhood that's little different than average American restaurant. Athenian burger was awesome, my kids enjoyed rice bowls, veggie is very nicely cut!",5zgkyGzDy65zLmlbgvwA-Q,0,0,5,_IKRyJ7a9_541xn_coPWYA

Fantastic food .... great service.... lovely staff! Highly recommend this place. The salad was very fresh and the sandwich was delicious.

For a fast casual, the food was excellent and so was the service. 

We tried the lamb chop special which was great, gyro plate as well as sandwich, the burger, fries, hummus and baklava. 

Everything we had was really good as we share family style and the environment was very comfortable to sit and talk after our meal.",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,5,pHaCXetb6_9l5bQJZv-IWQ

The food was good but the protein should not be placed on the fries, it makes them soggy. Don't know if I'll return.",meRvDvEWtvDcHyJsgLbK9Q,0,0,3,gOEDrLsFxQXD4Jlztl972A

The food was very good the first visit.  Couldn't wait to get back there.  Today we ordered our lunch at 11 to be ready at Noon.  It was 12:30 by the time we got up to the register.  Our order wasn't ready.  An hour and a half??  (All we ordered was 2 salads and a skewer)  I ordered a chicken skewer to go with mine.  She said they ran out of chicken.  ???  I was adamant when placing the order NO OLIVES.  The cashier repeated no olives when ringing my order.  Guess what I got.  It was nasty and I did my best to sit and pick them out.  Today's visit was ridiculous.",0A6J6cTJABJ_jTI8ikM1Kg,0,0,3,Btoor67vVDUwfRKMJjtEYQ

5996378,2017-12-07,2,upB0RQl-l529IVwgOpwOQQ,"Came here for lunch today to grab something somewhat healthy. I like how they have a generous portion of salad even if you get a small salad. I ordered a small salad and a steak skewer. The steak skewer is $3.75 on top of the salad which is $5.95. 

It's nice because if you eat there they will bring your food to you, but since it was my first time ordering the salad I didn't know they were supposed to give you the dressing on the side. If my friend didn't say anything I wouldn't have known, which is why they got a four start instead of a five star. 

The steak was good and they even provide you with naan and tzatziki sauce. Not sure how you spell it. The salad had an abundance of onions and oversized tomatoes which I didn't enjoy. 

Overall, the food was good and the service was average. I'd come back again to try their other items on the menu.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,3,1,4,2mhJm8o0hF9cPy8s4inp2g
