My mom and grandma ordered the prix fix menu with Cioppino and Steak as the main course. The Spicy Salmon roll is good, kind of on the spicy side depending on what you're used to but they put honey drizzled on it which is.. different but interestingly good. I also ordered a side of Mac and Cheese which was like a mountain of toasted cheese covering goey mac and cheese underneath. Really good. Being only 19, my vegas trips usually consist of spa's, shopping, shows, and buffets (eating). I feel really lucky to try such a restaurant. I do agree with others, that it does have a date-ish feel about it. It's okay for families but not the best family environment but I'm sure they'd accomodate.

16614,2012-12-24,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"In Las Vegas, Rick Moonen's Seafood at the Mandalay Bay is suppose to be pretty good.  There are 2 restaurants of his here: 1 is the fixed course meal higher end restaurant and the other (this one) is just a middle tier restaurant.  The menu is a little strange as they have your typical American no frills seafood AND sushi.  My buddy ordered the sushi portions and he was quite unimpressed.  Then again, I would never order sushi from a restaurant like this.  We shared the oyster sampler.  Honestly, the oyster sampler is rather bland.  The oysters don't have much flavor or taste to them.  Maybe it's these particular ones they chucked, but overall we were rather disappointed.

My main entree was the seafood cioppino.  The pasta was cooked well like I wanted (al dente).  However the seafood they gave me tasted rather frozen/stale.  The clams were very small in their shells.  The shrimp was overcooked like crazy.  The calamari was chewy like it was frozen.  The only saving grace was the fish they used which tasted the most fresh in this bowl.  The sauce was a little spicy with an Italian kick to it.",-rNDXmeB2aqzK71qoM5QYQ,1,0,1,2105yRiaeKjh-LJ3FeoMAA
19781,2010-05-03,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Came in here with my husband on a Friday evening, two weeks ago.  We did not have reservations but read good reviews on Yelp so we thought we'd give it a try.  We opted for the 6 course Prix Fixe meal for $65.  At least one option in each course had a $15 addition if you chose that selection...which of course is inevitable since you want to eat the best thing. So not too sure if I like that type of sell tactic but even so, the food was fantastic. All the dishes were delicious, some more innovative and original than others.  The turbot was an upsell and the servers were really pushing for that one.  Practically everyone in the dining room was ordering it.  Honestly, after having a few bites, I was a bit disappointed.  It was cooked well, the consistency was good, soft, not chewy.  But it just lacked any flavor.  I'm all about mild fish but this one was just too mild.  I ended up liking my husband's salmon more than mine which is hilarious because I don't even order salmon at restaurants.  At least the salmon was cooked well and was paired with a deliciously mild green sauce. The hot and cold Foie Gras was by far one of the best dishes of the night.  The ""cold foie gras was paired with uni (sea urchin).  So it was like butteriness on top of more creamy butteriness.  mmmmmmm....heaven.  The hot foie gras was laid on what i could best describe as a piece of savory mini rice crispy cakes, Asian style.  The buttery soft and the salty crispy just went so well together.  We ate so much food to describe everything but I have to mention the deserts.  The irish car bomb was genius! From the plating to the ingredients used to the flavors.....perfect! The thing that topped it all off for me were the pop rocks used to simulate the carbonation of the car bomb.  WOW.  My desert was the citrus canelloni and that was superb too, mild, smooth, delicious.  And last but not least ........the vase that was a centerpiece at the beginning of our meal, then changes into a carafe holding a liquid that they come a pour after about the 2nd course of our meal, and just sits there for the entire rest of your meal.  Now as your are enjoying your deserts, a server comes over carrying a metal kettle and proceeds to pour liquid nitrogen into the carafe.  A few more minutes of waiting and voila, you get home made ice tea with mint, lemon grass, orange peel and a teeny bit of sugar.  I am so trying this last part at home! Oh one last thing, they gave great recommendations for wine pairings.  Don't hesitate to ask.  They have like a crew of people service each table.  Definitely a fantastic dining experience.",qHtcP895rHz-xwnCr9EX7Q,0,0,4,_OprkOtVJBSBNiSEeiR0gg
38701,2009-01-13,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Went here recently with friends and family, and must say, the food was quite good. This place's location might not be well known, but if you're in the south strip area and want some fish, you couldn't do much better at least for the downstairs option.

Had the rock shrimp and the calamari for appetizers. The shrimp was good, but would have liked a bit more for the price. Didn't quite strike me as huge prawns. The calamari was good and I'm not a calamari fan so I'll leave it at that.

Had a sushi roll next. Not quite an appetizer course, as it took too long to come out. That, combined with the roll, may be low point of the meal. It's not that anything was wrong with it, but simply that after all the raving that the waiter did about the sushi, it simply wasn't anything to write home about - a service + food problem!! If anything, the roll felt a bit underwhelming for the price you're paying. I'm kinda a snob for strip sushi though, so I'll at least give RM credit for putting it on the menu.

entree: had the char done RM style. The lobster was the best thing I was served all evening, and the mix of the lobster meat, the hollandaise and the char made this non fish lover pretty happy despite himself. The potatoes and the vegetable were standard side item fare at a nice fish joint. Again, a slight service faux pas here, I ordered the RM style which came with potatoes and then asked for cheddar potatoes a moment later, hoping to just do the substitution on the RM style. The waiter didn't quite comprehend that and brought both; not his fault entirely, but a bit more attentiveness all around would help.

Conclusion: I want to love this place, but I don't love fish, so props to the RM staff for running an excellent seafood place on the strip. From sushi to the oysters, it's clear that if it's in the sea, RM wants to take a stab at it, and they do a convincing job. Unfortunately the lack of a real knockout dish, along with a few service blunders prevent me from giving it the 4 stars. But if you're in the area and/or have a diverse group of fish lovers, definitely drop by.",C1_AvND8ApbjfZlKbtbbEA,0,0,3,HO1XOt2LT35hw8GIHORp9A

124258,2013-08-21,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"One of my long time favorites in town, Burger Bar, has seriously gone downhill in recent visits. This drop in quality has left Mandalay Bay with an opening for someone to step in with a great burger. Citizen's recently failed to do so, but some recent messages from a few readers let me to an unassuming location: RM Seafood. Going into a seafood restaurant to try a burger seems blasphemous, but I'm around for one task regardless of the type of venue. I've also gotten a tip that the newly opened Rx Boiler Room has a great burger, but that will have to be tackled soon on another trip.

In my mind I always think the interior is a bit dated since it's been there a while, but it still holds up quite well. Adorned with a wood-paneled ceiling, lots of stainless and white finishes, the very open space is still a cool place to dine. There is a small patio area that's open to the entrance of Mandalay Place, but it's a bit loud out there unless you're just looking to be seen while dining. Both the lunch and dinner menus obviously feature some excellent selections in the seafood realm, but they also happen to offer a couple burgers. Looking to sample the basic flavors of their burger, I decided to skip the surf & turf as well as the one that comes with BBQ pork mac and cheese.

The simpler RM Burger comes with certified Angus beef, tomato bacon jam and gruyere. The bun was great; well proportioned, buttery and delicious. It was crispy and buttery until the very end. The meat had good char flavor on outside, was cooked and seasoned very well. The bacon tomato jam was excellent, but almost too outdone by the garlic mayo mixed in the greens which also had great flavor. As for those greens, it was arugula as opposed to your typical lettuce, and a welcome change; crispy and just enough. I was extremely surprised but the quality and flavors in this burger, and couldn't have been happier with it.

I usually want to hate shoestring fries, but these were both seasoned and flavorful enough that I didn't have to shove a giant handful at once in my mouth to get any flavor out of them. They were cooked well, and didn't have any of the odd oil flavor that I come across far too often. As I said previously, I couldn't have been more surprised by this burger; no one has mentioned it to me until recently, and that's a pity. At $18 it's a bit on the expensive side, but as you can easily spend the same or more at Burger Bar I'd rather spend it here. I did a quick search and found a burger on Stripsteak's menu that I guess I'll also have to try, but until I do I can easily state that the RM Seafood burger is currently the best one I've had at Mandalay Bay.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,2,5,7aTDabrgkdcCqqUE6pwxiw
129225,2016-05-11,1,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"The food was great, but the service was atrocious. 

We went here for a 12 person, Saturday afternoon lunch for my grandmother's birthday. We stuck to the pre-fixed, 3-course (soup/salad or app, main dish and dessert) lunch menu to manage costs and simplify serving a larger party. Unfortunately, there was nothing simple about it for RM Seafood. Our food service was disjointed and excruciatingly slow, even by European standards. We asked one of the managers if she could help our waitress refill waters and even take our coffee order so it could arrive with our desserts. The well-dressed, female manager continued to fold napkins for the evening service, left our waitress drowning with numerous tables, was completely apathetic to her plight and our very sluggish service. Bottom line our three-course lunch clocked in at nearly 3 hours. Bad service will always overshadow great food. If I were Rick Moonen, a Top Chef Master, I would better staff my high-end restaurant so the quality of the food matches the quality of the dining experience.",qyaQRVBXlh8PUPtSHNrIGQ,1,0,2,7pEQPGp3XKzud_RdJuRQYQ
136012,2016-08-18,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"I researched for a restaurant that was part of the MLife / MGM group hotels, which gave me 15 hotels to choose from.  I wanted something fancy and special with delicious food for a birthday celebration.  I found RM Seafood and their menu looked fabulous although their prices seemed a bit high, that's the reason for the 3 star versus a 4 star, their prices.

We were walking from our hotel, the Monte Carlo to the Mandalay Bay, which is fast and easy but once we got there . . . we couldn't find the restaurant.  What was even worse is that when we asked employees of the Mandalay Bay, they didn't know where the restaurant was!!  Several had pointed us in the wrong place.  Finally when we did find it, it was near empty at 8:30PM on a Friday night.  There was one lady at the bar area and three other tables sitting.  I liked the open air feeling and yet you could still feel a little romantic in your booth.

Here's our meal:
Salad - $14.00
Appetizer Scallops = $36.00
Main Entree Surf & Surf (King Crab & Crab Cake) - $64.00
Main Entree Cioppino - $36.00
Minus the salad our bill came to: $149.02 + $30 tip = $179.02

We had a basket placed on the table and as I went to look inside, I couldn't see anything.  I kept looking further and further inside until finally I took my hand and reached ALL THE WAY to the bottom and found four very tiny (I do mean tiny, maybe the size of 1 1/2 quarters) rolls. It seemed silly to have this large basket with these teeny tiny rolls all the way at the bottom but they were hot and tasty.  I wont say they were memorable as we didn't order more like we do at other restaurants but they were fresh, hot and tasty.

I had decided what I was going to get before I came but once I was there I had changed my mind ten times!!  Finally I asked the waiter for assistance and suggestions.  I ordered a specific salad but unfortunately the waiter brought me the wrong salad and I didn't notice until the meal ended and the check came with the salad name on it.  He brought me the organic house salad.  Personally, I did not really care for it but my bf liked it.  The dressing was OK but it was missing the things I wanted that the other salad I had ordered had in it.  There were just so many things and being I wasn't familiar with either of them, I didn't notice.

My bf ordered the scallops appetizer with raviolis and that was very delicious, probably my favorite of all the things we ordered.  It came with three medium sized scallops atop 2 ravioli.  I thought for $36.00 they could have added another ravioli with the third scallop!

Our main meal, I ordered the Surf and Surf at $64.00, a combo of King Crab - four crab legs, not too large, I've had larger so these were average to me.  The flavor was good and the butter was hot.  It also came with a Blue Crab Cake as the second 'Surf'.  Usually I really love crab cakes but when they are stuffed with peppers etc., I don't enjoy them as much.  This crab cake had a sauce on it that did add to the flavor and helped me enjoy it more.  The size was that of a medium orange.  It was a good enough size I felt.  The rest of the platter was just dressing to make the platter look nice.

My bf had the Cioppino at $36.00.  It was filled with lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams, and pasta in a sauce with two slices of toasted bread.  He said it wasn't garlic bread though which many places do serve with cioppino's. He enjoyed it very much!

Our servers were attentive making sure water was filled & plates came out in perfect timing.  Our server took my salad off the bill, recognizing he gave me the wrong salad. 

For my birthday, my bf ordered a key lime pie but the server brought a small dish of Nutella creme brulee with a banana slice on top instead.  He brought what the house gives complimentary.  We would have paid for what we wanted but we weren't given a choice.  It was ok for complimentary.  What was sad for me the most was that when the waiter brought the desert, he just brought it over with the candle and just basically dropped it in front of me. He didn't wish me a happy birthday or sing or anything.  He lost points there and he was excellent throughout the meal.  Luckily I had my boyfriend there to serenade me : ))

All in all it was a very pleasant meal with a nice romantic atmosphere, good service and good overall food.  The value is questionable as the prices are a bit high.  I would recommend but maybe for happy hour or business lunch which is when I will return next time.",E1xsbfmFhQDC7Py1gVaCZg,1,0,3,9gykgfUZIhLV45Ef5wh4aQ
148491,2011-01-03,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"This is a review from someone who did not know what to expect from Rick Moonen Seafood.  I had heard of Rick Moonen the night before going to his restaurant from a Top Chef fan.  She was a big Rick Moonen fan.  Little did I know then, so is Rick Moonen.

For being a fresh seafood restaurant located in a smoke filled Vegas casino, it doesn't feel like a fresh seafood restaurant located in a smoke filled Vegas casino.  That was nice.  Thanks Rick Moonen.  

I ordered off of the prix fixe menu (55$) and went with the Rick Moonen Style ""Cioppino"" as the main course.

My date ordered the Ebi-Go Roll.  She was not too impressed.  Thinking that her hopes were high because she was a big Rick Moonen fan, I tried her sushi and was also not pleased.  It looked spicy as described on the menu but didn't have much of a kick.  She should have ordered something that said Rick Moonen in front of it because the Cioppino was excellent and recommended as a fan of seafood.  We tried the Ahi Tuna Duo for an appetizer that was so-so and the Key Lime pie for desert which was meh (both off the prix fixe menu).  Probably wouldn't go for those a second time.

The venue is great, set back slightly from the Mandalay Bay casino floor just to give you enough of a reminder that you are still in Vegas.  We ate downstairs which is perfect for a casual date and not too loud. Rick Moonen apparently knows seafood and the accolades donning every inch of the walls suggest that Rick Moonen is fully aware that he knows seafood.  But for a first visit the food seemed to be hit or miss.  I recommend something that says Rick Moonen in front of it which by my count were about 13 items.

We had reservations on a Wednesday night, so I was not busy at all.  Once we were seated, it took approximately 20 minutes for one of our two servers to come take our drink order.  My husband ordered a cocktail, and I couldn't decide, so I just started with water.  It was another 15 minutes before he brought us our drinks, and he hadn't yet asked us if we wanted to order any starters.

Finally he asked if we wanted to order anything, and we were interested in the cold platter.  It comes in three sizes, of which the small has 1/2 lobster, 6 oysters, 3 shrimp, 3 clams, 3 mussles, and the house ceviche.  We asked the price, and it was ridiculously overpriced, even by Vegas standards.  We ended up ordering a dozen oysters instead, which were just ok.  He came back about 15 minutes later to see how they were, at which point I had to ask him if we could put in our dinner order.

I had the Lobster Bolognese, my husband had the Cioppino.  Both were just ok, nothing special.  For the price on my Bolognese, I was expecting more lobster.  Odd thing with the Cioppino, the shrimp had almost the complete shell still on...only about 1/4 of each shrimp had been peeled.

Our server never came by to ask how our meals were.  We had to flag him down to get the check, but you can bet the manager came by in about 30 seconds to run the card through.

This all seems good compared to the couple that sat next to us...after 40 minutes, they were brought another party's order.  Once they informed the server it wasn't what they had ordered, it was another 25 minutes before their food was brought to the table...and her shrimp was cold.

I'm really not sure where all the complaints are coming from. Everything is pricey in Las Vegas, that's the way it is.  I've had meals on the strip that didn't come close to RM and were just as expensive if not more. If you want a lights-out meal you're going to open your wallet. Otherwise, go to the buffet at the Fremont. 

To put out the kind of food that this place does, at a comparable price to other higher end places on the strip, while doing it sustainably, is extremely impressive. 

As for the food itself:

The sushi rolls were amazing. 

Oysters tasted off the boat fresh. 

Lobster and Crab were cooked absolutely perfectly.

Everything else on the plate(s) was done beautifully.

I fell in love with their sushi and couldn't wait to get back to Vegas for their sushi. The atmosphere was also very nice, service was mostly great until we asked for them to split the check, which then they said they couldn't do it because their system didn't allow them to. 
As I mentioned above I was very excited about going back to this restaurant and decided to look their reviews to find that they had several bad reviews about the service and food, so I was worried. I've hyped up this place and recommended it to my friends and family and was worried I stirred them wrong. But the minute we arrived the staff was very friendly and the manager, Scott was kind enough to take several pictures with different cameras for us. Jennifer was our server and she was very helpful and didn't mind repeating the special of the day or describing the various entrees on the menu. I highly recommend the lobster soup, I've never had it before and it was absolutely delicious! And as I mentioned before I fell in love with the sushi, so I ordered the Ringo Roll and the Salmon Roll, both rolls were divine!

Top to bottom from service to food to setting, this place whimpers mediocrity with a screaming price tag. We actually decided not to go back to our favorite joint Bouchon so we can try out some new taste on the strip.  That was a wrong decision.

First it's not without a good dish...the Jumbo Crab Cake was splendid...flavorful and meaty but that was the end of it and we just got started.  

This is probably when they say in the kitchen "" hey it's ""sea"" food...so guess what...there's only one flavor in the sea kids! "" Because it seems they masked all possible flavor with saltiness.   It's like they put salt on top of the salt crystal that they use for the Chowder and to mix with the rub on the Wild Cobia. Where do you get your salt Rick Moonen?  and our wisecracking waiter seems to be a smart guy who has no clue how each of the fish on the menu is prepared.  It was painful.  

I am willing to pay top dollars for a deserving high quality food...but it's such a sore disappointment to pay for such lameness.

The good: The jumbo crab cake...there's no deny here that it was good tasty crab meat...how I wish the entire meal was like this. And the dude who kept our water constantly filled, he was extremely nice and courteous...how I wish he was our waiter.

The Bad: Salt is the star of the show. They should change the name to Rick Moonen's RM Saltyfood.

The Conclusion:This was a kink in our otherwise splendid Vegas trip. I see this place got a lot of decent reviews. So may be someone knocked over the salt shaker that night. No matter. I will not return or recommend...not for this price.",sSyZSGRwiyeTVI30EEpimg,0,0,2,XLTm1UyPf2qsg-cqnERoKg

Our large party was seated at 9PM in the sushi area on high stools, not a real table.  OK, but the food will be great, right?  we ordered salads and soups and they came relatively quickly along with 2 bottles of wine, by 9:45PM.

then nothing.

for the next 1.5 hrs, we got nothing, barely refills of water.  no offer of bread, no offer for additional wine after we drained the two bottles we had while waiting.  in succession, we flagged the waiter, flagged the manager, begging, pleading for our food.  we should have walked out, but were so starved we kept thinking and they kept telling us - it'll be here shortly, it'l be here shortly...we started eyeing the food that was in the kitchen barely 10 feet away, longingly looking at the sushi that sat there for a full hour, wishing upon wishing that it would be ours to eat.  then as it got past an hour, wishing upon wishing that it WOULDN'T be ours as it got less fresh by the minute (it was ours...).

Finally the food came along with the idle sushi and crazed by the hunger pangs, we ordered two more of the sushi rolls!  the surf and surf (lobster and crab), hyped so heavily by the waiter as a special, was small and unimpressive.  the Black Cod, was so small and overcooked, Somalians would have turned it away (no offense to Somalians).  But, pushing 11:30PM in the now emptying restaurant, we gobbled it up before we passed out from low blood sugar.

the 2nd and 3rd sets of sushi rolls we ordered arrived within 10 minutes and after we asked for it, the check with about 90 seconds.  our waiter dropped by with our check, proudly announcing after noticing the time, ""are you ready now for breakfast?""

i'd say we were ready for anyplace but RM Seafood.  as we walked out we noticed other patrons berating the managers and hostesses - likely experiencing the horrific level of service that we did.

i told our waiter of the excellent time we had there in May 2009 and of the great start in the bar and with the starting salad/soup.  i added that it went to shit from there and that they could improve if the could just shoot certain members of their kitchen staff.  he agreed.

i don't think he would have agreed that the server could ameliorate the situation with comping some food, throwing in a desert, bridging the gap between starters and entrees with snacks or an apology that things were backed up, or any kind of concept that a satisfied customer is a high-tipping customer.  but there's a lot of things that RM Seafood doesn't get.  one of those will be my business or anyone who ever asks me about it.",3J5-wvIXaOyR_wi_ejbcWA,2,0,1,0kgni62zPtMPJxi8l91-Ew

Sadly, Rick wasn't there but that did not take away from the quality of the meal. Two Prix Fixe Menu's were consumed here (at $55 a piece):

1. For appetizers, I had Rick's White Clam Chowder, while Ha had the Jonah Crab California Roll. The chowder was seasoned perfectly and it felt good to try a California Roll with actual Jonah Crab. A nice start to the dinner.

2. My entree was the Alaskan Salmon (forgot the actual name of the dish), while she had the RM Style ""Cioppino"". The salmon was cooked nicely and the vegetables underneath had a nice touch of citrus to them, which helped cut through the salmon. However, the Cioppino was out of this world. It was seafood heaven. The broth had deep flavor from the numerous chunks of fish, clams, mussels, and shrimp. They seemed to be out of King Crab so they put more fish instead. If King Crab were in it, this review would be 6 stars. 

3. We were both stuffed by desert, but desert needed to be consumed! I ordered the ""Fat Elvis"" and she ordered Rick's Key Lime Pie. The contents of the ""Fat Elvis"" speak for themselves, but the taste of bacon, chocolate, and banana tasted strange at first. The taste eventually made sense and I loved the dish. However, I think the Key Lime Pie tasted better. A nice dollop of whip cream helped sweeten the tart lime custard.

I can only say that I've never had fresher oyster in my life.  This is impressive, considering we're talking about a restaurant in the middle of a Nevada desert.  Please do yourself a favor and order the Steamed Mussels or Clams.  You will want to ask for additional bread to dip into the mussel broth...or just ask for a spoon to drink it straight up like soup.  

For an entrée I got the Grilled Shrimp over a saffron risotto.  While there were only 6 jumbo shrim, I savored the flavor of each one.  My wife's entrée was the Duck Confit Gnocchi flavored with Roasted Garlic, Chanterelle Mushrooms, and Celery Root.  Let's just say her enjoyment of the dish is quite an understatement.

We even ventured onto the sushi menu with the futo-football sushi roll that was merely ""ok"".  All the entrees that we ordered were perfectly seasoned and prepared.  The chorizo oil in my grilled shrimp and saffron risotto added a nice smoky kick.  But the surprise standout item of the evening was the chips of the Fish and Chips entrée.  Disguised as your run-of-the-mill spicy potato wedge, RM's chip had a dark, crisped exterior and lush mashed potato-like innards.  They were perfectly herbed and salted but not spicy.  Surely they also contained some sort of crack because I could not stop nibbling on these.  They were beyond delish.  The meal was capped off with Rick's Tasting Game of 16 ice cream flavors.  His pastry chef creates these flavors daily.  Some were terrific, some were not.  Except for the grapefruit sorbet (which I SWEAR tasted like tomato/watermelon), it was the flavor combos that threw our palates for a loop.  How does Lemon Tart ice cream taste different than lemon meringue pie?  What if you only identified two individual berries in Mixed Berry sorbet?  We gave this dessert game a serious effort yet only had 10 out of 16 correct.  Yeah, that would be a ""D"".  Supposedly, the average is about 7 of 16 so at least we could walk out with our heads held high.

Though not many diners seemed to be aware of the significance of the night, Robin Leach did.  He was there joining in the Skype session with RM.  As the finale results were being announced, activity stopped for a split second as everyone thought RM and his charity would be announced as the winner.  (Spoiler Alert...)

The sweet corn soup was a bit sweet for my taste, of course there is the word ""sweet"" in the name of the dish so that should be assumed.  The razor clams were good.  Clam chowder was OK. The clams were a bit tough.  It had the viscosity that I like, not overly thick.  I really enjoyed the chunks of lardon in the soup.

The Lobster roll was good.  Although it was a little heavy on the creme fraiche.   The ""Surf and Surf"" was not what I had imagined.  It is crab and lobster on a bed of wheat orzo tossed in a beurre blanc sauce.   I guess I didn't pay attention to the ""Surf and Surf"" in the name of the dish.  What was served was what looked like two huge king  crab segments and a whole cut up lobster.  The orzo with beurre blanc sauce had a very bright lemon flavor to it and cut the richness of the seafood.

438297,2011-03-15,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"I purchased a $89 voucher on Travelzoo for RM Seafood.  The details were that it came with 4 course dinner for 2, 2 chef's tasters, 2 soups or salads, 2 entrees, 1 shared dessert and 2 glasses of champagne.  I just wanted to start off by saying that this was not a DEAL.  We ended up paying $57.45 for tax + gratuity (we only had 4 people in our party since when did 4 people count as a larger party with gratuity included?).  This meant that we all ended up paying $73.23 for dinner.  By the way, they even charged us for still water.  

First and foremost, the one big negative about this spot is that you can't even find it.  It's totally hidden without any clear signs.  You don't even see signs leading you to the restaurant at Mandalay Bay.  I ordered the Rick's White Clam Chowder ($12).  It was probably the best dish of the night.  It was very flavorful and enjoyable.  I ordered the RM Style ""Cioppino"" ($36) as my main dish.  I don't normally eat my pasta too soft but this dish the pasta wasn't even cooked yet as it was tough to bite into.  The dish was big and it could have probably fed 2 people vs. 1.  The seafood in it was okay, I liked the shrimp in it the most.  For dessert, we shared the Rick's Tasting Game ($18) which has 16 scoops of ice cream that you had to taste and write down your guess on the flavor.  It came with your classic like Vanilla but also had things like onion, mole, etc.  It was a fun game.  If we each individually ordered the particular courses, it would have cost us $57/person not including tax and tip.  Therefore, this definitely was not a good offer.  When we saw the bill, we of course questioned it but of course they won as they said the tax was off of the $168 (original price of the meal) and the gratuity was over 20%.  I definitely did not leave the restaurant very happy.  I felt like I paid a lot of money for very mediocre food.  I definitely would not go back to this spot.  If you're going to spend this kind of money, you might as well check out a better restaurant on the strip.  Last but not least, they didn't even give us our complementary champagne until we had asked for it at the end because we pulled up the offer on our email.",fkwe4UPhjbF4yNVk-rtQkg,0,0,1,r_4vs4jL-m81Xh9-bgsihg

First, service seemed a bit off... for example - I immediately ordered a bottle of wine and it took at least 10+ minutes for glasses to show up without the wine...weird...10 minutes later I kind of gave an eye to our server and he came over with the wine and popped it open.  I'm not sure if I was supposed to always pour my glass, but I did - which I am fine with.

The best thing I ate was the corn succotash - butter + fresh veggies is tasty, period.  The biscuits and cornbread were decent, but seemed like there was something missing.  So here is the big problem, Surf and Turf for 100 bucks...  You get half a 2 lb lobster and the filet which seems fine, but the 2 lb lobster is 80 bucks...   Mathemagics says that you are paying a serious premium for the half lobster, like 50% markup.  

I ordered the fish and fry, which actually was pretty good.  The fries reminded me of jack in the box curly fries - I probably should have not trusted my servers advice of sticking with them. 

I like the ambiance of this place, it tries really hard to make things upscale but not like you need a sport coat.  The wine list gets my nod as well...

588439,2011-04-20,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"This review is actually for a visit paid to RM Seafood a few months ago, being my 2nd full dinner experience (and probably 3rd or 4th if you include just apps).  AH-MAZING!  Rarely do I feel a dining establishment's food deserves 5 stars but based on all my experiences, it has been consistently mind blowing...that being said I will explain the 4 star rating below.

I had 2 friends in town, one being a huge Rick Moonen fan, and I had been meaning to return, so we chose to spend one of our dining adventures here.  Our visit consisted of the following:

APPS:
- ""Moon 'n' Doggie, $15 (white shrimp, red cabbage slaw, chipotle toga chips)"":  looking at them, you'd think they were brats in pieces of toast used as a bun.  Tasting them though, very unique!  All blended together very well ...the taste of the shrimp-like sausage & slaw was so good together I only ate a few bites w/the bun and finished the rest alone!

- ""Futo Fireball Roll, $19 (king crab, avocado, cucumber, spicy char, tobiko, kabayaki & wasabi citrus aioli)"":  I could have ordered this as my dinner alone!  Filling and taste was freakin' great.  I'm a sushi snob so this being good in my book means it's probably hella amazing!

- Although I'm not usually one for the bread basket, I did try a few pieces of one of the breads and it had great taste and texture- not too dry & somewhat light.  Unfortunately, being a few months ago, I can't remember exactly what kind it was.

ENTREES:
- ""Branzino, $34 (winter veggie ragu, romesco sauce)"":  This was my entree.  I was originially between the Arctic Char or Hake but went w/this upon my server's suggestion.  And AHHH am I glad I did!  Branzino usually isn't the 1st fish I jump for on a menu but this was done perfectly, with so much more flavor than I'd ever had from this type of fish.  Strangely enough the highlight of the dish though, was the veggie ragu!  I cannot remember what exactly it consisted of, but I am a huge veggie fan, and these were done perfectly (I hate when cooked veggies are undercooked) with a romesco sauce like I've never had before.  The combination of the fish & veggies melded perfectly together & made it so hard not to eat almost the entire entree! 

- ""RM Style Cioppino, $36 (calamari, mussels, clams, king crab, shrimp, FOD)"":  Still not sure what ""FOD"" means but who even cares...this was OMG!  My dish was amazing and I didn't think it could get any better but then I tried her's and almost could not stop eating this one also!  All of the seafood tasted very fresh and was very generous in portion, placed atop a bed of pasta, cooked perfectly, pulled together w/a thich tomato broth (might I add, was a great tomatoey flavor w/a slight kick).  WHEN, not 'if', I go back I'm getting this...a side note, the portion was so darn big that after apps, I think 2 or 3 people could split.

- ""Alaskan King Crab, $32 (1/2 lb., steamed or chilled- he had them steamed) + (3) added Taylor Bay Scallops, $3.50/ea."":  I didn't try his entree...he added the scallops upon my recommendation based on my 1st full dinner experience @ RM (best scallops I've ever had until the scallop app I recently had @ Scarpetta, which are pretty much tied for top of the list).  He was absolutely in heaven, & he pretty much was in a trance while eating, barely looked up.  At a few points we knew he was still conscious because we heard  small rumblings of ""mmmm"", ""wowww"", ""my God""...Lol.

SIDE:
- ""Moonen's Mash, $7 (capers, scallions, black pepper, red onion)"":  I suggested we get a side, my bad!  I knew everything was going to be delicious but didn't realize it would be so good we'd pretty much lick our plates clean...I usually don't pick mashed potatoes at restaurants because many times I end up being disappointed.  It just seems like they're often tasting like the fake quick mix up flakes and not REAL, homemade taters.  I was also spoiled up until I moved to Vegas, with my grandma's homemade mashed taters, which I carry on the secret recipe to this day (she's Polish & nothing can touch grandma's home cookin'!).  BUT, these were REALLY good!!!!  Light, creamy, buttery, and you could definitely tell they were real.  A nice onion flavor accompanied, and there was a garnish of capers, red onion & scallions that, when eaten w/the taters, exploded with flavor.  Wow, am I really raving about mashed potatoes?

Now, the reason that, as of this review, I don't give them 5 stars...service from the servers on both experiences was very, very good- no complaints.  However, due to my profession, I make recommendations & call on many occasion to make reservations @ RM..it often feels unwelcoming, unfriendly & cold when I call &/or am greeted when approaching the restaurant.  It's discouraging.

All in all though, I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND making it a point to try out Rick Moonen's awesome RM Seafood.  Good thing they have a large entrance to the restaurant, because we were so full leaving we practically rolled out!",9xBDxlvOPBT8I2L9lVSqxg,3,1,4,98vpscodDjbJVtnSGpUt5A

The service is impeccable, we were seated with Cliff the first and second times we were there. He obviously knew the menu, came with great suggestions and was willing to work around whatever mood we were in food-wise. I highly recommend asking for him as a server.

As for the food itself, the sushi was some of the best I've ever eaten. The rolls were fresh, inventive and super high quality. The soups were phenomenal, particularly the Keri Squash soup.

Our server was very friendly but too 'canned'....everything he said felt like it was a quote from the ""Server's Guide to Table-side Conversation"".   When we asked for recommendations from the menu, he could only comment ""everything is good"".

We started the meal with the famous ""moon doggies"" which were unique and excellent.  The outside was nice and crispy without being overloaded with batter, and the inside was moist and flavorful.  One order only had 2 moon doggies on it and I could definitely have had more.

I ordered the cioppino and my hubby ordered the ""everything crusted"" yellowfin tuna.  Both entrees were decent but forgettable.  At $30+ per entree, I expected some ""wow"".  Both dishes, while flavorful, did not strike me as being from a restaurant that was voted 'best seafood restaurant in las vegas'.

But the ice cream tasting game saved the meal.  They give you 16 small scoops of ice cream or sorbet and a piece of paper with 16 circles on it.  You then have to sample each ice cream/sorbet and identify the flavor....you start off with one flavor already given to you so it's really only 15 that you have to guess.....but it was much harder than I expected.  We didn't get any seafood flavors (although the server told us shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque have been known to appear in the game) but we still only ended up with 7 flavors identified correctly.  We had flavors that ranged from corn blackberry to carrot cake to gazpacho.  Three of the 16 flavors had some form of blackberry in it so I can only assume that seasonal fruits play a big part in the decision of what ice cream flavors to make.

The game was a lot of fun and the interactivity of tasting and debating  with friends made this a memorable experience I would definitely go back for.

And to finish the night off, Rick stopped by for a quick chat about the game and his experience on Top Chef Masters.  He left after telling us ""you haven't seen the last of me yet""....hmmmm...sounds like a sequel to the show??!",3g5hnCAuISZ33xMcee2xvA,0,0,4,u9sxCNiJOGSkFNP93LOIEA

The food was good, though I can't say it was anything spectacular. We started with the ""moon doggies"", which are shrimp corn dogs, they were interesting for lack of a better word. The oyster shooters were pretty good.

i ordered the grilled shrimp and my husband had the walu kabob. Both were good, nothing special, which is disappointing because for $30+ for 5 shrimp I would have expected them to be fantastic.

Our server was very nice, though perhaps a little too attentive for my taste, constantly hovering. The tables are very close together so be prepared to befriend your neighbors. And the fact that they sat us out on the patio part that is basically steps away from the casino kind of ruined the nice atmosphere we wanted for our special occasion, but that is my fault for not asking to be moved.

I came into this with high expectations especially since I'm a Top Chef fan myself, but I walked out feeling disappointed and cheated of my money. On my way out of Vegas, I came here for lunch and on my way out, I wish I had gone to Bouchon again instead!

I ordered for appetizers/starters: duo tuna, 2 oysters, and a bowl of clam chowder. For the entrees I split the grilled shrimp risotto and RM burger. 

The tuna appetizer was the biggest ripoff! It was $16 and my fist was bigger than the entire plate. If the plate is that small, the flavor better pack a punch and give me an orgasm in my mouth, but sadly no. I couldn't even fake one if I wanted to. There were 3 small pieces of seared tuna with a spoon full of tartare underneath. The slices of avocado were larger than the seared tuna! I did not eat the oysters, but my party members indicated that the oysters were delicious, plump, and juicy so at least that didn't disappoint.

The soup was lukewarm when presented to us. Maybe we got there at opening and that's why it was lukewarm, but its not like I showed up at 9am for breakfast. Its 11:30, soup should be hot, especially on a cold winter day! It also wasn't out of the world extraordinary where I would spend $9.

My grilled risotto was oversalted, which is a shame because the flavors were solid had it not been oversalted and the risotto was cooked perfectly, albeit a bit oily. The RM burger was shockingly decent and the fries were actually really good, but its a RM SEAFOOD, and to be pleased by burgers and fries seems disappointing. Furthermore, I might as well just head up the escalators to Burger Bar and enjoy cheaper and more delicious burgers with way more options than RM.

Overall, I felt cheated by the money I spent on such underwhelming food. I expected so much more from RM not just based on Rick's reputation, but the price tag too. Ugh, the more I write, the angrier I get.",9RYD5m8xUb5la2wGsf30_A,3,1,3,XQcOGExXfL8gbdBUvZMG5A

The overall vibe of the restaurant was certainly different than the downstairs portion.   A cool contemporary setting with a subtle elegance was very welcoming.   

We met at the bar and told the Bartender Tony to make us ""whatever was good"".   He whipped up a specialty cocktail that was a gin based drink with some hand extracted ingredients like lime, cucumber nectar and some other things that slipped my mind.   I had three in about 15 minutes because they were absolutely amazing!

So we go to our table, a bit buzzed and get the spiel from Jeff, who goes over the difference between the ala carte and tasting menus.   We all agree to get the tasting menus, which by the way were very nicely presented in a cool glass holder.

I tell Jeff to pick out a menu for me as long as it doesn't have a few things that I'm allergic to, and we're off.

The dinner that ensued was just awesome.  I have a wide variety of people with me and even the ""non-foodie"" type enjoyed the experience.   

First of all, the carp roe that they serve with the bread is some kind of cross between pure heroin and video poker on the addictive scale.

The Salmon amuse was awesome.  The beef tartare perfect.   The bouillabaisse was down right strange and not a hit with my friend, but I thought it was kinda cool.  The foie gras two ways was perfect and the late harvest white Grenache that it was paired with was out of this world.  The Walu was ""the best thing one I've ever tasted"" according to one of my friends.  The rabbit loin was the best I've had and the ""Irish Car Bomb"" dessert was delish.

The overall dinner took us a little while as it should because we were intaking a lot of food and tasty beverages.

The most amazing thing about the whole experience was the price.  We paid for some supplements for some of the dishes, but the cost of the tasting menu alone without booze was still under $100 a price which is so far under the Vegas standard for food of that quality.  

I was with five guys on this trip, but I'm certainly going to bring a gal by next time and venture further.

The Parmesan crusted la vosh and corn bread muffins that they bring to each table are really really good.  That was the best part of my meal.

Given what we ordered, I would have asked for a chardonnay with no oak.  That seems to be more popular and available now, and it tastes a lot lighter without the oak barrel aging.  But the Mom wanted red, so I wasn't sure what to get.  I asked Jessie for a recommendation, and gave a price cap.  She came back with a Miura Vineyards pinot noir from King City in Monterey County.  She said it was fruity and peppery, and would go well with what we ordered.  Had a taste.  Spot on - fruity and peppery.  Normally wouldn't think to get a wine from Monterey County, and my only memory of King City was as a stop-off during a road trip from LA in 1989.  Sorry, King City.  I had it all wrong.  Thanks for the great pick, Jessie!  

We all shared the steamed clams appetizer.  The clam meat was huge and juicy, especially given average size of the shells.  

Also tried some oysters for appetizers.  We didn't see the Kumamoto oysters that seem to have some of the best/strongest taste.  But they still had some good stuff there.  After dinner, checking the menu for the restaurant upstairs, we noticed they serve Kumomoto oysters there, just not downstairs.  Next time we're there, we may ask if they can serve that while dining downstairs.  For those who are in the Monterey/Carmel area, check out Flaherty's in Carmel.  

The rest of dinner was great.  Halibut for me (again), but prepared differently.  Cioppino for the wife (again).  Mother-in-law and Brother-in-law shared a whole lobster, steamed.

We came here early for our 7pm reservation on a Monday night.  Decided to sit at the bar and watch football first.  

The bartender was great.  She let me scout the wine list and explained the different types of oysters to me.  While talking with her, she mentioned she was a foodie too!  Then she told us Rick Moonen was like 10 feet away.  I almost got nervous because she wanted us to meet him, but I declined since I knew he must be busy.  

So at the bar I had two oysters, a Pacific Miyagi and Atlantic Naked Cowboy.  Not very many places let you order oysters individually so I was extremely happy.  Hubby don't eat shellfish!  Both were very good, however I would prefer the Atlantic.  I like the meaty, briny goodness more than the delicate favor of the Pacific.  

Dragged the ball and chain away from the bar and sat for dinner.  Wine list is great.  I've been to several of the wineries in the book and recognized many names.  They even have Tantara which I ordered.  

Appetizer: Tuna Duo
seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Not fishy for ahi, to my surprise.  

Dinner; Me the Cioppino, Hubby ; Fish and Chips
The Cioppino was also cooked perfectly.  Does have a slight heat to it, but not too much, well balanced with the pasta.  Love the garlic bread on top.  Could drink the broth.  
Had some of the fish and and chips.  The fish tasted like butter.  Nice thick batter.  'Nuff said.  Hubby ate it all.  

Dessert:  Fat Elvis
How can you come here and not get this?  Bacon in dessert, sign me up!  Cooked wonderfully again.  The bacon adds a slight saltiness to the roll and the banana and chocolate are so divine together.  It almost tastes like peanut butter.  Plus the passion fruit caramel sauce makes it lighter!

We tried both lunch and dinner at RM Seafood. It is owned by Rick Moonen, a celebrity chef who was in the Top Chef: Las Vegas competition.

For lunch, we used a Restaurant.com coupon ($10 off when purchased $20 or more) and we ordered a Catfish Sloppy Joe with sliced pickles, peppers and onions, and french fries ($15) and a Adam's Fish Sandwich with wedge fries ($16). Hubby also tried a glass of peach cocktail ($12). Hubby liked his Catfish Sloppy Joe very much. The rich sweet and spicy sauce was pretty tasty and unique. Compared to his, my fish sandwich was on the light side. The fish was perfectly cooked, crispy on the batter and juicy inside. I liked it! The waitress service was friendly and attentive. 

For dinner, we had their prix fixe dinner, which included a glass of champagne, a fresh oyster for a starter ($3.75), a choice of Fuji apple salad ($15) or Rick's white clam chowder ($12) for appetizer, a choice of RM Style ""Cioppino"" ($36, calamarata pasta, mussels, clams, king crab, shrimp, and seasonal fish) or pan roasted free range chicken ($25) for main course, and 4 flavors of ice cream and sorbet served blind ($4.50). The total value of the dinner for two was over $115, but we got a great deal from Travel Zoo for only $89 (tax and gratuity were not included). The food was excellent, especially the Cioppino! The plate was filled with fresh delicious seafood and I love the bold yummy spicy flavors!

The food at RM Seafood was tasty and great, but the service at night was not so good. Our waiter was friendly and nice at the beginning, but after the starter, his attitude changed dramatically. We had a hard time finding him during our dinner, and when he served, his face was not pleasant. Even though he knew that we had a flight to catch and promised us he would keep an eye out for our food, our main course came late and we had to wait another 30 minutes for our ice cream. The timing of the food was horrible. Our waiter didn't even apologize for our wait! Total disappointment.

First: we were seated late, despite our reservation. We ordered thirty minutes after being seated, another issue in my mind.

Second: our drinks took another 20 minutes and we never received bread or anything else to hold us over while waiting.

Third: our sides never arrived, four of our ten entrees were incorrect, and the sashimi portions were ridiculously small, even for Las Vegas. Plus, the scallops were overbooked. This took two full hours from seating to delivery of our entrees.

Had to wait forever for our waiter to make his first appearance, in spite of the restaurant being only about 20% full for lunch in the downstairs section.  Another long wait to bring our beer (nice cold Anchor Steam draft) and an excruciating long time for our food.  Telling the maitre'd that we would leave if our food didn't come in a few minutes didn't seem to help.

We kept the order simple, fish tacos and a tuna melt.  How can you go wrong with that?  Well, RM Seafood can.  The tacos had a tiny piece of cod in each taco...certainly not an expensive enough fish that they couldn't have given more.  The tuna melt was soggy with mayo and worse than what you'd get at a cheap diner.  To add insult to injury, the tab was $61 for the tacos and melt, a small salad, and 2 beers.

The best thing were the oysters which were so fresh and delicious.  Particularly the West Coast ones.  They are exorbitantly priced by the piece but if you order the ""one-of-each"" you get an assortment at a pretty reasonable price considering Vegas is land-locked.

The Rhode Island style calamari was great at first: lightly battered, lightly fried, cooked perfectly.  But there was no punch to it.  There were some hot, some sweet peppers, but not enough to really add anything and it really didn't come close to measuring up to expectations--almost like it was tempered to appeal to timid palates.  Also after a minute or 2 it went soggy, I think because it was sitting on a bunch of sauce which sucked it in and bogged it down.  It was a very strange almost instant transformation from a good dish to an average one. 
The appetizer portion was big enough for 3 or 4 people to share.

Next I ordered the sturgeon.  When it arrived, the runner said ""here's your halibut.""  The waiter quickly rushed over and said that used to be the prep for the halibut and they switched to sturgeon.  Pardon the pun, but very fishy.  (And it did taste more like halibut than sturgeon.)

The restaurant used to be set up for two levels, the lower was casual and the upper was fine dining. Once the economy turned the restaurant could only support the lower casual level, apparently it is still that way, the upper level was closed on our visit. We were seated between a family with two young boys and two nicely dressed ladies, the rest of the dining room was just as varied. There were far more families there than I would expect. One sat on the patio, and their boys were playing in the main restaurant it was a huge distraction. 

Anyway, onto the meal...

We came  in for the Restaurant Week menu, but they also have a prix-fixe menu for $55. My husband opted to go with that so we could sample a wider variety.

We started with a crab california roll and clam chowder. The sushi was dry as can be. Not too pleasant. I've come to the conclusion I'm not a fan of clam chowder (if I didn't love it SF, I doubt I'll love it anywhere). This version was decent, but some of the clams were so chewy they were inedible. 

Usually you are started with a bread basket, but ours didn't make it to the table until we were mid-way through our appetizers. I wasn't particularly fond of the biscuits or the cornbread, but the latter was better.

Moving on to the entrees, he had RM's version of Cioppino. It had a thin broth and pasta that was undercooked, and the seafood was all overcooked. It was not a successful dish on any account. I had diver sea scallops with sweet and sour eggplant topped with crispy soben noodles. The scallops were a little chewier than I'd like, but otherwise it was a fine dish. It just wasn't my preferred preparation.

Things got interesting once dessert rolled around. My strawberry cream puff was terrible. Quite possibly the driest one to ever pass my lips, I couldn't eat it. I picked out the strawberries and enjoyed the sorbet. Frank had the Fat Elvis, which were warm chocolate bacon banana spring rolls. They were tasty, surprisingly the gooey chocolate and smoked bacon went well together. It was a tasty sweet and salty bite.

Service was acceptable, we had a few mishaps in terms of timing and missing utensils, but troubles were quickly corrected.

Everything was delicious. From the butternut squash soup to the perfectly cooked mahi mahi fish tacos. Nothing seemed mind-blowing my innovative. Nothing like the challenges on top chef. But everything was good food done well. 

The $15 cocktails were also surprisingly worth it - well balanced, flavorful and interesting. I could drink the dark and stormy all day (or at least until I passed out...like two hours). 

Our server was mind-bendingly incompetent (spilled water, didn't know what the ingredients in the 5 signature cocktails were, somehow seemed uncomfortable even though a pre-fix menu is pretty much the easiest) and the new location is a little weird for this kind of restaurant, but the food really shone.

Overall, my food was mostly very good.  I started with the clams and the serving size for a first course was quite large (I would have preferred half the size).  The broth was perfectly seasoned.  For my main, I had the cioppino, which was also huge.  The seafood was all cooked just right and the pasta was truly special.  There was something about the pasta that gave it an almost nutty flavor, but even though I enjoyed it, I had two different people come by the table to tell me not to eat too much of the pasta because it would fill me up and I should really eat the seafood first.  GO away!
My guest had their seafood special, which she enjoyed, but at $70 for that course alone it seemed quite pricey and out-of-place for a dressed up tavern.
Our desserts were hit and miss.  The semi-freddo was delicious, but the pb s'mores was weird and that was surprising.  How can you go wrong with chocolate, pb and marshmallows?  However, the marshmallow was gummy and fell off the dessert in one long piece as soon as my fork touched it and the pb layer had an unpleasant mouthfeel.

The clam chowder is pretty good here. Not THE best, but good. Large chunks of clams and they even put carrots in it! That's a first. Borderline salty and just right. Kinda wierd.

I ordered the RM Cioppino and that was VERY tasty. At $35 a plate, a little bit on the pricey side, but generous with the seafood and pasta that comes with it. A few clams and mussels here, 2 jumbo prawns there, and Dungeness crab meat mixed in the sauce. Heaven. It comes with these awesome garlic bread sticks. Yummo! I would definitely recommend this.

I would have to start this review off by discussing out waiter. He came up to our table to tell us about the specials (mind you, I don't think we even had menus, or at least, we hadn't opened them) and he starts to rattle them off like this ""Ma'am, (to my wife) for you I recommend the seafood risotto served blah blah blah, scallops, blah, muscles, blah, with a side of king crab legs...and for you sir (to me), I am feeling the steak, the tomahawk ribeye served blah blah with a side of blah. You two with me?"" 
(the blahs in aforementioned were really descriptions I don't recall, he didn't really say blah)
Now, this could have seemed presumptuous and arrogant, but he hit my wife and I, SPOT-ON. He had no idea I don't eat seafood, yet recommended the steak, and my favorite cut too!  And he hit my wife with the perfect seafood dish that had everything she wanted without anything she couldn't eat. 
Ok, this guy had us dialed in. Very impressive. He swung for a grand slam...and had we not loved those choices, we would have kicked him to the curb and I would have said this guy was rude and arrogant...but instead, he nailed it and we let him choose out meal without even looking at the menu. 
Needless to say, the food rocked and we loved every bite. Super fresh, excellently prepared and served perfectly. 
Service, like I said, was an unforgettable experience. It could have been perceived as super arrogant, but this guy was like a mind reader, a clairvoyant. A once in a million chance. I just can't see that happening every time, but for me, it was great.

Ok not much cooking here , but the shellfish presentation, freshness, and mignonette sauce were fantastic.  With that said.... I expect all the raw shellfish as well as sashimi to be extremely fresh (that should be a given) anything less really is unacceptable for any high end place!! . We did try the lobster wrap, a seafood ""esciveche""  basically a ceviche, and the clam chowder.  The lobster wrap kinda had a Vietnamese feel to it . The ""Esciveche"" was like a lighter Ceviche, it was almost kinda plain with a little added from the bell peppers and cucumbers. Now it does sound a little like Japanese sunomono (which they also had on the menu) the clam chowder was a bit disappointing as I really like the creamy New England style. This was something like a creamy bacon stew with a few clams .....too fancy for such a simple classic dish.

1175442,2012-05-09,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Our review of RM Seafood is mixed, but positive overall. 

We were seated immediately without a reservation at 7:30 on a Saturday night with a Groupon (don't know what this says about the sales at this restaurant). The Groupon was $46 for $92 worth of food ($36 x 2 for entrees + $20 for drinks). It popped onto Groupon and we grabbed it. 

Service was first rate. I ordered Diver Scallops and my wife had RM Style Cioppino (mixed seafood plate with pasta). Comes with wine but we had sparkling waters and ice teas. The half-dozen scallops were large and perfectly cooked. I can still remember the first bite I had. There was a wonderful sauce on the plate with eggplant and (strangely) pork-belly.

The Cioppino was a problem because the the Calamarata Pasta was chewy and undercooked. Not acceptable at a place like this. The mussels, clams, shrimp and king crab (shelled for you in the kitchen) were tasty. Comes also with a garlic bread basket which they filled. The wait staff was so engaging that we didn't even complain about the pasta (after all we had a Groupon). We tipped 20% on the pre-discount price.

1185198,2013-11-23,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"I was in Las Vegas to attend the AWS:reinvent conference and was looking for a fine dining venue to entertain some very important clients when my sister suggested RM Seafood. I am aware that some of the world's best chefs, including several from New York, had opened restaurants in Vegas but I was a little skeptical. 

I live in Manhattan so I know that ""fine dining"" means more than just great food. It
means a great dining experience from start to finish including service, food, drinks and atmosphere. My sister, a big Top Chef/Top Chef Masters fan and foodie, assured me Rick Moonen and RM Seafood would not disappoint. Unfortunately, she was quite mistaken. 

I made a reservation for four at 7:30 on November 4th and got one on such short notice. In hindsight, perhaps that should have been my first clue. Upon arrival, we were escorted through the restaurant, out to the ""outdoor seating area."" Considering the restaurant is located inside what amounts to a very expensive shopping mall, the outdoor seating with its lovely view of the escalators, was more reminiscent of a food court than the sea as described on the restaurant's website. Sadly, this should have been a second clue. 

It took several minutes before our server even greeted us. We placed our cocktail orders and he gave us a choice for water and what type of olives we'd like. Our water never arrived. I had to get up and ask a bus person for some water for our table. When our cocktails arrived, the martini glasses were only half full. The next round we asked that the martinis actually fit the martini glass. We would not learn until the bill arrived later that olives in martinis were several dollars extra and a regular size martini came with a ""bump"" charge. Again, I live in Manhattan so I am no stranger to expensive cocktails or up charges for top shelf liquor or a double shot. However, that is not what is going on here. I have never seen such outrageous cocktail chicanery in my life. 

As for the food, while it was extremely expensive, even by New York or Vegas standards, it was excellent. However, two of my companions ordered the Crab Menage a Trois described on the menu as ""1/2 dungeness crab, 1/2 lb. steamed Alaskan king crab, signature jumbo lump crab cake."" Imagine our surprise when they arrived with no dungenesss crab! I am not sure if the staff regularly tries to get away with this or if this was an unusual occurrence but it was my companions who pointed out the lack of Dungeness crab not the staff. Only then, did the waiter apologize and offer a substitute of lobster. That alone is inexcusable. On top of that, the sides did not come out until 7-10 minutes after the entrée and they came without serving spoons. 

The manager, Elisa Hink, visited us twice to apologize but offered nothing by way
of explanation or compensation. When we received the bill for over $700, I was
disgusted. While $700 for a fine dining experience may be reasonable, there was 
nothing ""fine"" about our experience. Elisa came over a third time, to answer our bill
questions. We questioned the ridiculous bar fees for olives and full martinis unseen
anywhere else in Vegas or New York and unmentioned by our waiter at the time of 
ordering. The only thing comped on the bill? The lobster! I reminded her of the staff's deception and that since it was technically a ""substitute"" the lobster could not possibly be considered ""comped."" She took the bill back and removed the olive charge and reduced the bottle of wine by $20. 

That's it.  Not once did she offer to buy us a drink.  When I pointed this out to her for the third time, she shared her feelings about wanting to leave a restaurant as fast as possible when she herself has bad dining experiences.  

Never in my life I have I experienced such shameful service, both at the server and 
management level. I was so sorry Mr. Moonen was not in the house that night. I 
wonder what he would think of his staff's behavior.",DcgImv8B6k7WL5FeXASypw,6,0,1,4BqjuFm-F7q4ydmBBoPYnQ

I do not recommend this place at all and it's a shame as I have enjoyed watching Rick Moonen on Master Chef and thought we'd give this place a whirl.  We ordered their ""featured"" appetizer, the foie gras which was hyped up by our server.  The way he described, it sounded like the foie gras was going to be the star of the plate ""drizzled"" with a balsamic reduction.  Well, when it arrived, the foie gras was swimming in a pool, literally, of balsamic and it was inedible.  We informed the waiter, and he said he would correct the error.  He returned with the same piece of foie gras, now just removed from the pool and sitting on a bare plate.  Really?  We said, ""no thank you"" as it was not presentable at this point and it had absorbed all the balsamic from the time in the pool.  We then ordered a bottle of wine, needed it at this point, clam chowder, whole lobster; one steamed and one broiled and their macaroni and cheese for a side and the broccoli raab vegetable.  The clam chowder came out cold with a heaping handful of fresh thyme on the top which made it entirely inedible.  I asked for bread with the soup and the waiter said, ""crackers?"" and I repeated, ""bread please.""  He brought out two, quarter-sized rolls.  Could they spare it?  The lobsters were brought out but I ordered steamed and the server was going to give me the broiled one by mistake so I informed him that I wanted the steamed one.  Instead of just putting it in the right place, he went back to the kitchen only to return a few seconds later to put the steamed one in front of me.  Huh?  When I touched it, it was ice cold; chilled lobster?  I informed the waiter and I said that this was now ridiculous and please tell me where the hidden camera is.  I mean iced cold!  He took it back to the kitchen.  I stared at the Mac and cheese and when I picked some up on my fork to take a bite, it was dripping no more like running cream/butter/milk -- disgusting.  Kraft would be more appetizing than that!  I asked the waiter if he would eat that mac and cheese that was swimming in milk or cream and he said ""no.""  so I sent that back and p.s. the veggies were cold too.  
When the Lobsters arrived back at the table, I ate my share, as I was very hungry at this point and just wanted to get out of there.  They appropriately took off everything from our bill except the Lobster and the chowder (which was terrible) and we paid and left.  I am so appalled that the management of this restaurant thinks that the public is that stupid or that unsaavy to place food in front of them that is this terrible.  Low standards should not be applauded nor honored.  Do not go!

Food - 4.5 stars!
Cost - 2 stars... 
Ambiance - 4 stars
Service - 3.5 stars

The clam chowder was delicious and the salmon wasn't my favorite but it was good. Lobster mashed potatoes was AWESOME. My friends and I literally put it in our mouth and had to savor it. We would pause in the middle of talking because it was pretty darn good. And the Nutella Creme Brulee.. it was DIVINE! (It tasted like melted Ferrero Rocher chocolates!) I definitely savored this dessert. 

The service was quick and our cups were always full. For the most part, everything was good. Portions were good. We were thoroughly impressed. We thought for the $50 we got a good deal. 

Until we got the bill. My friend and I had decided to split a ""side"" of Lobster mash. We both saw a RM Mashed Potato on the side which said $11. We were impressed by the size considering we thought our portions would be small. Boy were we shocked when we were told our mashed potato was $28! 

Now, this restaurant wasn't a normal place for us to dine at, but we also were aware that everything would be a bit more pricey. But honestly, $28 for mashed potato? If there were big chunks of lobsters, maybe we'd justify it a little better. But I'd have to compare the amount of lobsters with the amount of clams in a can of clam chowder soup! Really? When we looked at the menu again and we couldn't specifically find the ""LOBSTER"" mashed potato. We were told the RM mashed potato was plain mashed potato. We were beyond disbelief. We decided not to make a big deal about it but we were not happy to say the least. 

So. 3 stars is most likely my final decision. The price of that mashed potato... :(",COO0J8CcfhU3SWPxqOBnPA,0,0,3,wV9lOn3n93BD6lVOyBEkRA

came here for a business dinner. bad move. Too damn loud. there's some sort of bar upstairs with a bad cover band playing, I couldn't hear a word from the person across the table. That's my fault for not either leaving or moving immediately, but the impression they're trying to convey is of a classy seafood restaurant, and the damn band upstairs just blows it.

I had been warned about the greed and upselling of the wait staff here. Sad to say it was all true. I'm sure it's not the waiter's fault but a management decision. The snotty prick started in on the platter of appetizers and how recommended they are. Of course they're recommended, it's ""market price"". he's shilling the wine, ""recommending"" the most expensive crap on the way overpriced menu.

So we order, and of course it's ""do you want scallops on that""? not mentioning the 20 extra bucks they're going to stick you with.

Food comes, we have to ask twice for things, and when they screw up and bring us an extra side, the jackwagon tries to take it back. No way brother, not my problem.

Food was borderline. I had scallops, (3) for 40 bucks, and they came on shrimp that tasted weird and were dried out. others had cioppino and said it was passable, but again way overpriced.

The sides were very good. Green beans were fresh and crisp, Brussels sprouts were very good too, and the mac and cheese was odd but tasty.

Wine was overpriced, but not any more than any other Vegas clip joint.

So the bill comes, and they have already added 20% gratuity for a party of 7. WTF? Then the waiter adds, ""we've added a space there for an additional gratuity, much appreciated"". No way, pal.

Was seated at the bar for the challenge. Service at the bar was very good, the bartenders offered various recommendations about the menu, even though we were there for the gelato tasting. The bartenders also offered a lot of small talk regarding the various happenings around Vegas, which is definitely a plus for service. We did end up ordering a Rainbow roll, which was a bit disappointing, as the quality of the roll didn't seem as good or fresh compared to some sushi restaurants I have been to.

The gelato tasting challenge was very fun. The tasting begins with 16 different gelatos of various flavors; and you are given a sheet of paper with blank circles, which corresponds to each of the porcelain cups of gelato. Once you are finished, the bartender/server will bring out a sheet of paper with the actual flavors, with which you can compare how well you did. At the end, my party scored 7/16; which wasn't too bad. There were definitely some interesting flavors such as blueberry buttermilk, mango salsa, honey mustard...

Although you don't win anything for doing well at the tasting challenge, it is definitely an interesting and fun experience to have with friends. I would definitely recommend trying this challenge; especially for those who have had eaten lots of different things, as it might help identify the more ""obscure"" flavors.",AQvdQADQzM7NLLdg88feUQ,0,1,4,K9fIU-nZBTjvPfLCsWvCbQ

During the week it's pretty calm.  Getting a seat in the bar wasn't a problem.  Service was surprisingly slow.  Not having a bustling dining room I would've believed it would move faster.  The food took a long time to prepare.  The bartender didn't seem at all interested in our presence.  She even disappeared for a while leaving us waiting to pay.

Next up we split the lobster rolls and steak frites.  The lobster rolls could've had a bit more lobster.  I realize they are the happy hour size but the competition serves them larger.  They did have a good flavor with a little flair I couldn't put a finger on.  

The steak Frites was a good amount for sure.  The steak was well seasoned and had a flavorful light layer of sauce.  The side basket of fries was a good amount to split as well.

Last Sunday we decided to eat at Rick Moonen's rm seafood at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.  We have both heard of Rich Moonen from the Bravo show Top Chef and we both love seafood.  So we gave it a go.

After we picked up a 33% discount coupon at one of the Vegas Half Off Tickets counters we headed to the restaurant.  Our server's name was George who was insistent on getting our drink order even though it took us some time to read through the very extensive wine list.  After a few minutes of deliberation we decided on MacPhail Pinot Noir which was a wine we have never heard of but we love Pinot Noirs and took a chance.  It turned out very good. 

Then for dinner I had ordered the Shrimp Corndogs for an appetizer and Cioppino for an entree.  While my boyfriend ordered the Crabcake for an appetizer and Shrimp Rissotto for an entree.  After we each got our food it turned out we were both more impressed with the appetizers then the actual entrées.  The Shrimp Corndogs was an interesting twist but still very good.  I got gypped with my Cioppino only coming with 2 shrimps and 3 mussels with the rest fish pieces.  It was also way too salty for my taste.  My boyfriend also enjoyed the Crabcake but felt that his Shrimp Rissotto was way too salty (he even complains when I cook because I don't add very much salt) so for him to say that it was too salty.  It was way too salty.

The service was just ok and it took forever for our food to come to our table and after I presented our 33% Off coupon the waiter insisted that we order dessert and after we said no thank you, he still brought the menu.  And made a comment that he hopes they are still open when we come back to visit Las Vegas.  I think he was trying to make us feel guilty.

I requested to be in the downstairs lounge, since our party has a tendency to be a bit rowdy and the upstairs lounge is apparently more upscale (aka - quiet).  I wasn't expecting much, as the appetizer selection only had the usual suspects:  fried calamari, popcorn shrimp, etc.

I arrived first, and was pleasantly surprised that there was a cozy back area reserved just for us.  Our servers were upbeat, friendly and accommodating.  They each took the time to explain how everything would run and to get to know what type of group ours was and what they should expect.  They kept our food and drinks flowing and were just fabulous.  I wish I could remember their names, but in my champagne and Cakebread chardonnay haze, I seem to have forgotten.  I'm sorry ladies!!!

Now the food.  OMG, so good and so much better than expected.  The calamari was delightfully peppery, the fried oysters were tender and flavorful, the popcorn shrimp and shrimp cocktail were both delicious.  And the best part was that all of this fried food was crispy and light, not greasy.  Our servers were really great about accommodating a member of our group who does not eat seafood as well.  While the menu was limited for non seafood lovers, they came up with a modified menu option just for him.

We got all but THREE! And apparently we got one right that no one ever has (MILK sorbet people). They come out and tell you what you missed and what you got right, like a junior high science test or something.

As we perused the menu I enjoyed an assortment of oysters (I now know I like Atlantic oysters - cool!) and my husband opted for a bowl of clam chowder, and we shared a bowl of steamed mussels in green curry with pickled ginger.  Oyster tasting is fun!  Who knew?  The oysters were very fresh and surprisingly varied (this from someone who is obviously not an oyster connoisseurs).  The clam chowder was excellent.  Clams were very, very fresh and the broth was delicate and slightly rich with nice chunks of clam and vegetables.  We loved the mussels!  The green curry sauce was beautiful, light and full of flavor without overpowering the mussels.  Definitely a do-over.  We enjoyed a carafe of the house white with our appetizers, an Albarino, which was excellent.  The Albarino we usually enjoy is from California's Central Coast (Paso Robles) and is crisp with a slight minerality.  RM Seafood's Albarino is lush, medium bodied, and very smooth.  Nice!  This was the start of a solid four-star meal.

For our entrees we went for the Cioppino (mussels, clams, crab, shrimp in a red sauce with pasta) and the Diver Scallops with black bean sauce and manila clams.  This is where the rating took a bit of a hit.  The Cioppino was good, not great but good.  The Diver Scallops were seared nicely, but the black bean sauce was a bit salty and when coupled with the scallops it was just a bit too briny for my taste and I got a little too many pieces of sand - ugh.

I ordered the pumpkin brûlée for desert, hoping my husband would share even after he told me he was too full.  The brûlée was paired with a Moscato d'Asti, so I went for it and so glad I did!  The pumpkin brûlée was good, albeit a bit dense, with a nice crunchy, caramelized topping.  I have to say, I enjoyed the Moscato d'Asti better than dessert!  Stems up!

Quite a tedious process with 12 diners after they told us at the begninng splitting is not a problem.  From there, the server took over 40 mins to split up the checks.  I checked in with the manager as we had reservations elsewhere that were approaching.  He was quite rude and told me they were"" handling it"" and continued to fight with me when I told him our displeasure with the experience.  I was never apologized to nor even given the common courtesy of an explanation or that they understood my frustrations.  

As the icing on the cake, I was finally walking out of the restaurant.  As I passed by the manager I had spoken to, he made eye contact with me and didn't even say a word.  No ""have a nice night"", no ""thanks for dining with us""...NOTHING.

I will never go back to this restaurant or anything with Rick Moonen's name on it.  Quite unfortunate since I'm sure he never intended for the dining experince at his restaurant to be like this.",UnQrJiEB0ArxrMfBzdKRrw,2,1,1,5MaGFbyjiahBSUlutLlZLw

During the lunch hour, they have prix fixe menus. The choices were alright, but some of these items could be ordered as entrees. I didn't see anything I wanted from the prix fixe menu so I ordered the rainbow roll which was delicious. 

I think the highlight of the meal was the oysters we ordered. We ordered the sampler which allows you to pick which oysters you want. I can't remember which ones we specifically ordered except for the Kumamoto ones and some other Pacific ocean ones (we avoided Atlantic since we're from the East Coast and want to try ones we ordinarily wouldn't be able to obtain). This was a great deal and delicious. There are choices of mignonette sauce, horseradish, lemon wedges and cocktail sauce. I think these are best enjoyed with all sauces except cocktail sauce.

RM Seafood is from Top Chef Masters contestant Rick Moonen.  The restaurant is located in Mandalay Place (right next to Mandalay Bay) and features two dining areas--an upstairs dining room for more ambitious fine dining and a downstairs area for more rustic fare.  The downstairs area has a gastropub-like feel.  The look is simple and contemporary with a big focus on lacquered medium-colored woods (the decor is reminiscent of a less dark Houston's or Westside Tavern).

RM Seafood's downstairs lunch menu is casual, but there is a wide range of dishes so there is a wide range of prices.  Some of the options include a raw bar, starters, sandwiches, salads, entrees, and soups.

I started with the crab cake, which was a blue crab cake that was pan seared.  It was served with a carrot, jicama and cucumber salad as well as a light aioli.  The crab cake was good.  There was a generous portion of crab and it was moist and fresh.  The sear provided some crispiness (no burnt flavor).  A lot of the flavor accents were citrus-like and bright (not too overpowering).  The little salad of carrot, jicama and cucumber was fresh and refreshing.

I had the catfish sloppy joe, which was featured (I believe) on The Best Thing I Ever Ate as well as Top Chef Masters (though that sloppy joe was a shrimp version).  The sloppy joe had a standard sloppy joe bun.  I was hoping for a better bun.

The mixture definitely had a sloppy joe taste.  In addition to the sweet sauce, the mixture included catfish, peppers and onions.  There were also sliced pickles in the sandwich.  The sandwich tasted fine, but there was not enough catfish.  The mixture was almost entirely made up of peppers and onions.  In the end, the sloppy joe did not feel any more special than any other sloppy joe.

The housemade potato chips were good.  They were light and crispy and not too greasy.  They were also nicely seasoned and not salty.

For dessert, I went with their peanut butter s'mores.  The dessert was fairly elaborate and consisted of a flourless chocolate cake base topped with a peanut butter caramel-like bar and toasted marshmallow.  The candy bar-esque dessert was garnished with a hot chocolate sauce and a graham cracker ice cream.

The dessert was okay and satisfying, but it was nothing memorable.  I did like the many elements (the stretchy peanut butter filling as well as the toasted marshmallow); I also felt the graham cracker ice cream had both a good flavor as well as a creamy and smooth consistency.

Service was very good.  My waitress was friendly, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace and the whole staff seemed cheery and personable.

Most of the plates were in the $18-$25 price range (the prices would probably be high for most cities, but for The Strip, I guess the prices were not too bad).  The food was filling.

I did like the crab cake at RM Seafood, but I felt my entree and dessert were both pleasant but not good enough to make me want to come back.  Rick Moonen served some very elaborate and ambitious food on Top Chef Masters so maybe trying his upstairs dining area will provide a much more rewarding experience.

Decision was made to eat here as it was the closer of 2 restaurants along Luxor-Mandalay Bay's ""restaurant row"", that I'd made a reservation for that evening (yep, I canceled the other reservation).  

We were not disappointed.  Fresh and delicious seafood, with reasonable wine prices, absolutely fantastic pre-meal breads (best drop biscuits I've ever eaten, BTW and I'm remembering them 3 weeks later), and a swank ambiance.  The night we ate there it was still Happy Hour on arrival, so we noshed on appetizers, small plates, and 4-5 different types of fresh oysters flown in that morning.  Add a great server to the mix and there's your 5 stars (ask for George, Dining Captain; he's been there 6 years).

Food items: Cioppino (Italian seafood stew); charred grilled octopus w/ fingerling potatoes; fresh oysters; seafood escabeche; various sushi rolls.  All 5 stars for flavor and presentation, and 7.00 wines by the glass that were plain wonderful.  (Note: the mussels in our cioppino were bad so our server went straight to the chef, who inspected the entire daily mussel batch; their only miscue of the evening).

Big Tip on RM: Arrive while Happy Hour is still going on; you'll save lots of dough and really enjoy the chic bar area.  Try one of the high-top tables, you won't regret it.  The hostess said (addressing our very tired convention feet) that the bar seats are the most comfortable she's ever sat in, so we took her advice and did so.  She was right.  It was like sliding into a luxury car seat.  We let our dining room seating go to someone else (dining room is equally chic and no doubt comfy). 

Our bill with tip, for 3 people was $250.00, but with plenty of wine (and I think a few cocktails) on the bill, and being in Vegas, that's not bad at all for the experience we had at RM.",-QYg0fSdX8vE_pbz8niddg,2,1,4,N1wo80sb7oyfh-QEG9ic5Q

The Restaurant Week menu caught our eye on the night we checked into THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay (August 29, 2013) and it seemed like a OK choice given proximity and our advanced state of hunger from traveling.

And the food was not bad. It was not excellent or distinguished, but it was not terrible. 

But the service was memorable, memorably terrible! -- perhaps the worst we have ever had anywhere, and we dine out A LOT.  

The appetizer (mussels in a curried broth) took forever to arrive and then weren't the mussels we had ordered but clams. We refused the erroneous plate and I guess that was more than our waiter was willing to tolerate. From that moment on he was openly rude at table, unwilling to acknowledge efforts to contact as he glided around the mostly empty room ignoring us, never did bring the biscuits that we paid extra for, all in all as hostile, surly and obnoxious as he could be. It took over an hour from the time of the appetizer failure for our entrees to be served, and they had cooled to virtually room temp by the time the waiter deigned to serve them. Two different bus persons apologized for our waiter's conduct, so obvious was it that he was acting out inappropriately. But no manager appeared to salvage our dining experience. 

We left deeply disappointed in our choice among so many good restaurants in the Mandalay concourse. Rick M seemed like a really dedicated chef the season that he was on Top Chef Masters.

After my mediocre experience at the other Top Chef Masters restaurant in Mandalay Bay, we decided to go to another one - this one run by celebrity chef Rick Moonen.  Right next to the Mandalay Place shopping center (and connector between the Luxor and Mandalay Bay), this place was hopping.  A sophisticated look belies the bedlam of noice both inside and outside the restaurant.

Let's get pricing out of the way first.  I've ceased to be shocked by the pricing in Mandalay Bay.  It's overpriced.  Expect to drop over $100 per person - more if alcohol is involved.  However, price is not a determiner of quality, as I've discovered many times.  

We started with a three-tier seafood sampler - this thing cost $250 for the table, but for that you will get a whole lobster, a whole dungeness crab, several large shrimp, mussels, oysters and clams on the half-shell.  All of it was good.  It is accompanied by a spicy butter draw, a spicy cocktail sauce and freshly ground horseradish.

Wine was very much in evidence, and the place has a full bar.  The wine list is good (if over-priced) and there is wine by the glass.  I'd recommend the Gruner Vietliner to start.

Our starters included the bacon wedge salad - a big ball of iceberg lettuce topped with bacon, a most excellent claim chowder that was rich, definitely creamy with potatoes and bacon, and a ceasar salad.

My entree was the free range chicken, sat atop some wilted spinach on top of a pool of cheesy grits.  I don't normally like grits, but these were delicious.  Around the table, the seafood (diver scallops and grilled shrimp dishes) were hits, but the cioppino - while delicious - had pasta in it (so not technically a cioppino), and the ribeye steak was not done correctly.  My companion didn't even get asked how it was to be prepared, which is unsual in such a place.  I'd avoid the steak.

For the table, we ordered the cheesy cauliflower gratin - not really a gratin, unless you consider anything floating in a creamy cheesy sauce a gratin.  We also ordered the fries.  The fries were eaten and the gratin not so much, which tells you everything you need to know.  

Everything is a la carte, with the sides easily feeding a small family.

Overall, an excellent meal, made better by good company.  Avoid the steak, do the seafood, and you cannot go wrong.",WpjLsGe2v9-g_cMdAOOLYA,0,0,4,dmm-xf6ImiPrHxsDVT3eHg

We were seated 30 minutes after the reservation and that was the closest thing they came to do something right! Appetizers took almost and hour to show up. how long does it take to boil crab legs anyway????

The first of the main course arrived at 9:45. Almost TWO FULL HOURS after we were seated. Some people were done before others even received their food though. Oh and what was finally delivered wasn't right. 

I had a surf and surf with lobster something that was SUPPOSEDLY King Crab. My portion was minuscule, another person's who ordered the same thing was HUGE. It was really pathetic.

The manager came by twice and it still didn't get fixed. We had people who had to leave without eating to go catch a show!!!! The bill was reduced, but at that point the experience had been completely ruined. This place is WAY to expensive to have an experience like we did.

We went on a Friday night at 8ish and there was only one other table in the whole place, so the atmosphere was horrible and silent with crappy oldies music playing.

Food was good, but very overpriced for what you got....even for Vegas.  I wasn't expecting the bargain of the century going in there, but the prices were very high and the portions very small.  Sushi was very good and had tons of choices.  We had to send back an appetizer for being cold and the 5 different servers (they must serve in teams, either that or there wasn't enough tables for them all so they shared) we had each apologized and said they told the Manager and General Manager....blah blah.  Neither Manager came over to the tabe to apologize (it's not like they were busy) and of course they didn't remove the item from the bill (which I wasn't expceting, but most high-end places would do so).

The biggest issue was that one of the servers kept making comments on the weight of one member of my party.  Although my friend is a bigger guy, he certainly isn't an obese slob and is NOT the type of guy that any person ever looks at and thinks it's a good idea to mess with.  He is very intimidating.  However, this did not stop one of the servers from making at least 5 seperate comments about my friends size or what he was eating and how much, etc.  I will say that the server seemed to not be doing it to be malicious, I think he was just an idiot.  This server has no idea how close he was to getting knocked out cold for some of his comments.  It was very inappropriate abnd certainly wrecked dinner for my friend.

Bread was good (a bit too good, as I ate most of it).  To eat, I ordered the cobia, which came with seafood paella, shellfish butter sauce, and paprika oil.  I'd never had cobia before, and figured this was the place to try it.  It was a mild fish, but the accompaniments made it delicious.  Plus, the butter sauce had nice sized pieces of lobster and shrimp.  The BBQ mac and cheese was delicious - loved the addition of BBQ sauce and it was very rich and cheesy.

It was a Monday night so most of us ordered off the Monday Night Specials menu.

First of all the tap Stella Artois was PERFECT. I've never had a place that thought ahead and chilled the glasses before the pour and the serve. The first taste was just perfection. The last tastes (milking it, would have chugged the whole thing and ordered a brand new one but that would have been uh-yelp worthy conduct) was standard stella.

Service was EXCELLENT. 

Catfish Sloppy Joe
Wow this was pretty awesome. The buns were toasted, the side of potato chips were home made and had a lovely crisp taste suggesting that fresh oil was used. Very nice attention to detail on the chips. The burger itself was excellent, the sauce was very fresh and home made with large cuts of onion and bell peppers. The catfish pieces were large enough to retain their distinct catfish taste while blending in nicely with the sauce. If this is what they offer on the Monday Night Sports Specials menu i GOTTA come back to try the standard menu

4x4 Challenge
OMFG this was fun. Some flavors were VERY distinct, you could guess them on the first taste, others were tricky but after everyone putting in their two cents and eventually agreed on a flavor. Others were just upside down and backwards, for example the coconut tasted NOTHING like coconut and pine nut...seriously PINE NUT?! 
Had a few favorites to include: Malt Chocolate, Pear, Apple Sauce and Rum Raisin. 

The Rum Raisin was heavy on the rum taste so toward the end i decided to start taking shots of the melted ice cream. Wow four shots of melted Rum Raisin and i actually started feeling a bit buzzed but it only lasted for a few minutes. That was good times.

1948479,2010-07-19,1,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"First and foremost, let me tell you a little bit about myself.  My name is Harold Johnson and I have worked in the Food and Beverage Industry for twenty-five years.  From very humble beginnings as a bus boy at the Fontainebleau in MIami, Florida, I have always had a passion for food (all types and styles of cooking), and customer service.  A fabulous dining experience can truly be made by a restaurant staff's committment to a high-level of customer service..excentuated by their desire to be  ""experience makers,"" not ""order takers.""  My wife and I had dinner at RM Seafood last month, while we were in Las Vegas for a Hedge Fund Conference.  We both were greatly anticipating the evening, due to Chef Moonen's cooking repertoire, high praise from several close friends of ours,  and most notably, his TV exposure/success on Top Chef Masters..an acclamation indicitive of true culinary creatvity, ingenuity, and most importantly, pride (in both the food he puts out, and the staff that is representative of him).  I will start off by saying that the restaurant decor and design is absolutely fabulous.  It is innovative, contemporary, and almost serene, in nature.  We had a fabulous corner table, that was perfectly cozy for the two of us.  Once we were seated, everything went downhill fast.  We waited nearly five minutes before our waiter, Robert, so much as made eye contact with us.  He replied with a distant  ""I'll be right with you,"" that one would expect at an IHOP or Denny's.  A mere glass of water would have been appropriate at that point.  We continued to wait several more minutes, before we were finally able to ""steal"" Robert away from his other tables.  From the get-go, Robert's attitude was very cold and abrupt.  I made several inquiries about various bottles of wine and hand-crafted libations, and received a robotic, monotonous ""spiel,"" infused with ZERO personality or upbeat, positive energy (that one would expect at such a highly-esteemed restaurant).  We finally ordered a couple of Cosmos, which took an eternity to arrive to our table.  Normally I would blame the bartender in this situation, but my wife went to use the restroom and saw our drinks already made, awaiting delivery, at the end of the bar.  We decided not to make a fuss, and made a genuine effort to enjoy ourselves once the drinks came.  Unfortunately, this was but an ill-conceived delusion of grandeur.  We ordered your Kitchen Sink (which was absolutely AMAZING). However, we had to ask for lobster crackers, cocktail forks, and even a dish to put discarded shells in.   And we weren't even offered a hot towel or lemon bowl upon the conclusion of our meal.  Yet again, we had to ask for it.  Now don't get me wrong, I understand that human beings are fallible, and that even the best food servers have bad nights.  But Robert's level of service was so dismal and such a disappointment, despite the superb quality of your food, our visit was RUINED! It felt like he was in a rush to get us out of there..I almost felt guilty for contemplating coffee and dessert.  So we skipped it.  I guess the point of this letter is to give Chef Moonen credit for his phenomenal  food, and to discredit our waiter Robert, for his aloofness, bad attitude, and overwhelmingly unwelcoming presence.  I will NOT BE RETURNING to RM Seafood, and as I stated a moment ago, It's definitely not because the food fell short.  That evening we had a mere ""order taker,"" named Robert..Not an ""experience maker.""  That is unfortunate.  One would think that during these economically challenging times, people in all trades and professions would be on their ""A-game.""  Nothing could be further from the truth with regard to our waiter.  Thank you for listening and to ANYONE CONSIDERING DINING AT RM SEAFOOD, PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!   SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE THE LEAP OF FAITH, DEFINITELY MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOUR SERVER ISN'T NAMED ROBERT!!

Kumamoto Oysters - I didn't like the flavors that were added to the oysters. The oysters themselves were kind scrawny, but could taste the clean ocean. 

Marinated California Octopus - The octopus was soft, texture good, flavor was good but not great. 

Steak & Potatoes - This was good. Steak was soft and tasty. 

Chilled Shellfish Bouillabaisse - loved the gazpacho gelee. The seafood was good, except the shrimp. Slightly rubbery. 

Bacon and Eggs - This was just okay. I wasn't a fan of the fried somen noodles. 

Foie Gras a la Japonne - Foie gras was tasty. Didn't like the sweet soy sauce dressing that came with it. In fact it kinda ruined my foie gras experience. :( I liked the crisy rice. The foie gras mousse and uni was blah. I don't really like foie gras as mousse though. Uni itself was just okay. 

Walu in Shiso Leaf - Dense texture of walu made it super tasty. 

Baked Alaskan King Salmon - Salmon was great, didn't like the side garnishes it came with.  

Roasted Fluke - The congee was good. Fluke was good too. 

Seared Scallops and Crispy Chicken Skin - Scallop was good. The sweetbread shaped to look like a scallop had the texture of foie gras but a salty taste. It was okay. 

Rabbit Trio- The rabbit was so tiny. It was the first time I've had rabbit. It was okay. 

China Pig - RM should really stay away from Asian food. The pork bun had too much bread. The other side thing, was just pork sung.... Seriously?

Morgan Valley Lamb Loin - Tasty lamb. Cooked medium rare. Not too gamey. 

Chocolate Car Bomb - This was just okay. Too much chocolate and sweet for me. 

Frozen Strawberry Shortcake Bar - Tasty, was my favorite dessert.

Tropical Crème Brûlée - Tasty too. The fruit chunks on the bottom were tasty. The dessert was creamy and good.

The Downstairs definitely has a very different ambiance than the Upstairs. Downstairs is open and has more of a sports bar feel in some ways. Whereas Upstairs is definitely an upscale restaurant atmosphere.

We had done our research ahead of time and already knew exactly what we wanted to order. We started off with the oysters rockefeller. I'm not a fan of oysters generally (though, my husband is), but these were incredibly delicious. The flavors were amazing.

We then progressed to the Ebi-Go sushi roll. All of the sushi rolls sounded great, so it was difficult to choose. The Ebi-Go roll totally delivered, though. Excellent flavors and great presentation.

For entrees, we ordered the ribeye with bernaise sauce and the hand-made cavatelli with morel mushrooms and blue crab. Being a huge fan of bernaise sauce, I can be a rather harsh critic when it comes this sauce. RM's bernaise did not disappoint. In fact, it was one of the better bernaise sauces I've ever had. The pasta dish was also great. It was almost more like gnocchi and the mushrooms and crab paired incredibly together. 

For a side, we opted for the BBQ-style mac 'n' cheese. The flavors were explosive. The BBQ meat with the peppers was awesome. Definitely one of the best mac 'n' cheese dishes in Vegas.

For dessert, we of course had to go with Rick's Tasting Game. It was such a fun way to end the meal. We thought we'd nail it, but it is amazing how much not knowing what it is can screw with your taste buds.

Given that it was a holiday weekend, the restaurant was pretty crowded and busy. However, we found the service to be good and never felt rushed.

The server brought our check. We inserted our gift certificate and credit card. Server brought it back. We signed the receipt. We left.

Since it was our anniversary, I promised my husband that I would separate myself from my crackberry for the evening. And I stuck to that for the most part. Though, a few hours later, when my husband took a restroom break, I sneaked a peak. 

I had 17 missed calls, 11 texts, and 6 voicemails. All from our server. He apparently screwed up somehow with the bill and needed us to come back. Ok sure, no problem. But I was pretty livid given the 17 calls, 11 texts, and 6 voicemails. Overboard much? 

And the only reason he had my cell number was because we made the reservation through opentable.com, where we stated we were locals and it was our anniversary. So that made me even more livid.

We made our way back to RM and the issue was fixed. Thankfully, the hostess was incredibly nice and apologized repeatedly for the server.

So while the food would warrant a 5-star rating (and did cement in place my crush on Rick Moonen), the 17 calls, 11 texts, and 6 voicemails makes me deduct a star out of sheer irritation.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,5,3,4,OhrRXdDxtyb2d6UT189Llw

Walked in and was seated quickly in a large, but cozy dining room in a corner (which I love) and greeted almost immediately with water and the waiter. Really nice immediate service. Bonus points for that.

I ordered a Chimay (wow, Mandalay Bay, that all your restaurants carry my favorite beer means I'll always make you my first in dining choices!) and my friend ordered a fabulous martini. He asked for extra olives and the waiter not only brought out regular olives (pimento center), but also blue cheese stuffed olives. It's those little touches that make a place worth returning to. 

So, forget everything else, but listen to this: if you want the best, very best, best-I've-ever-tasted oysters, come here. I am an oyster lover. I am quite certain I could subsist on oysters. But only if they come from RM. I have never, ever in my life, ever had oysters this fantastic. Blown. Away.

I ordered six ($23). You THINK that's a high price to pay, but you are confused. It is just the right amount to pay for the best tasting oysters in THE WORLD. The six types of oysters were Kusshi, BC, New Sound Select, WA, Miyagi, BC, Stoney Neck, NY, Moonstone, Ct and Village Baby, NB. The ONLY one I disliked was the Miyagi. It was small and had a very bitter, unpleasant taste. The rest? Prepare to cry. I can't even pick my favorite out of all of them. I'd eat one and say 'oh, THIS is my favorite' until I picked up the next one. Wow. If you love oysters you will LOVE these. Wow. I can't stop saying that. Wow.

I then asked the waiter about the Maine lobster roll. He informed me that it was lunch item, but what almost sure they could make it for dinner. And boy did they. I should have come here at lunch because the portion was way too big to eat! Not only that, but it was chunky and full of lobster. They went heavy on the dill and mayo, which I disliked intensely, but biting into large pieces of lobster calmed that down. 

My friend had the charred octopus and declared it much too much for one person (and then proceeded to chow it down). He loved it and finished every bit. It looked seriously delicious and that was confirmed. He then had the jumbo lump crab cakes as an entree and that was rather large as well. He declared them perfect. 

We also got bread service. Let me tell you that if you don't like the corn bread muffins you go ahead and save those and I'll send you my address; you can just ship those straight to me. Yum-my. 

The restaurant was very low key, clean and beautiful. My friend said he disliked that the tables didn't have table cloths (elitist), but I thought it was a very sort of 'seafaring' touch. I don't know, but you should seriously try this restaurant. It's moderately priced with really good food. Loved it!",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,3,1,5,7YJ_WVWn6GAN92mLOu9JQA
1990000,2011-04-19,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"The first of our meals out during our one-week stay in Vegas. Not sure why I chose a seafood restaurant as we get some of the best, freshly caught seafood out here on the East End of Long Island but I wanted to try it and wasn't in the mood for a steakhouse.

Ambience is contemporary. Nothing too flashy. The bar looked nice- we went right to our table. The biggest thing that was disconcerting about RM Seafood-- and Vegas in general-- was the price coupled with the fact that the location of the restaurant felt very similar to eating at your local indoor mall. The restaurant is right next to the escalators leading out of the casino and into the Shops at Mandalay Place. If we closed our eyes, we might as well have been at Ruby Tuesday's or T.G.I.F.'s. Then open them and look at the menu and see $38 for what was basically a glorified Zuppa de Pesce- called ""Cioppino"" on their menu.

Now, onto the food and what began a typical trend for the rest of the week which was ""We've had much, much better for much, much less."" GF had the above-mentioned Cioppino. Ample-enough portion and lots of fresh crab and large shrimp but 2 of the 3 clams that it came with didn't open-- really unacceptable in any seafood restaurant but even more so considering the prices we were paying-- and the sauce was a bland, tasteless affair that lacked any real zest or punch. I had the diver scallops which came with a stuffed poblano pepper and a mole sauce/wasabi mayo combo. The scallops were big, soft and tasty-- I will admit these were some of the best I've had-- but the pepper was luke warm and the sauce was weighted heavily on the mayo side and didn't complement the meal well. We started with the daily oyster sampler, which for $23 got us six unique oysters from all over the world, with a brief description of each. OK, fine.

I will also mention that our waitress was a bit of a tryhard e.g. Asked my GF ""And which salad will you be having?"" after we had already ordered, obviously not choosing to order salads. I know this is standard server practice to try and run up the bill but it is obnoxious and completely unprofessional. 

I do wish there were half-star options here as two stars does seem a bit low but it was definitely not 'A-OK'.",V_QylGaePtC22kLd-UVU1A,0,0,2,F8-PuyYi3S6DF_xUtrKvww

Cobia (with quinoa, lobster, tomato, seasonal mushrooms): Your normal ""simple fish dish"". Fish was cooked well, and I really liked the quinoa. No wow factor, but a solid dish.

RM style ""Cioppino"" (calamarata, mussels, clams, king crab, shrimp): A seafood ""ratatouille"". Definitely better than the cobia. I actually think I ate more of his dish than mine. 

All in all, I had a good experience, but I'm not sure if the food was worth the price. Not sure if I would go again.",_3Jmz1ImI4-e1roLYPxDAg,0,0,3,DN4WXuMmgqucGsIs81vijg

Argentina FIFA World Cup final. All the restaurants and bars were packed. Our first three options (Ri Ra, Burger Bar and the Mandalay Sports Bar) were full but luckily RM Seafood had a table for 2 available right away.

Inside, you could tell things were hectic. Many were complaining about how long it took to get their orders placed, for their food to arrive, and to get the check to pay and leave. The table next to us was there before us but we got our food before they did. They ended up cancelling their order and leaving without even eating because they had to get back to the convention to work.

We were hungry and felt a bit worried about the situations around us but weren't on a major time crunch. Our server remained cool and calm and also warned us that sushi orders would take at least 45 min. We took his advice and ordered Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos ($19) and the BBQ Pork Mac 'N Cheese ($14). It did take a long time for the food to come out - felt like about 30 minutes. 

The Mahi Mahi tacos were spectacular and the lime crema really perfected its overall taste. One thing we would've changed about it was for the plate to have four tacos instead of three. The BBQ Pork Mac 'N Cheese was less of a wow factor. Although the texture and melted jalapeno cheesiness was enjoyable, the BBQ flavor was just too overwhelmingly sweet. We barely made a 1/3 dent into it.

Overall, I liked best that our server was knowledgeable, helpful, and on top of his game. I am glad they were able to fit us in and glad we didn't have as bad of an experience as others around us seemed to. The food was hit or miss but we would return in the future - just definitely won't be ordering the BBQ Mac 'N Cheese again.",guT7BMNBLtWvuAE6DW6CzQ,0,0,3,EfcCkgH_Wrui8ZnuPzMf-Q

Ate at RM Seafood at Mandalay Bay this past weekend and was very disappointed. A group of 5 of us happened to be in the mood for sushi so we decided to head down to RM Seafood and give it a try. I have to say we were off to a good start. We were seated promptly, and had our orders taken soon after. 

The calamari appetizer was quite interesting, in a good way. It was the usual fried calamari presentation, rings and a good share of tentacle heads here and there over a bed of spicy and tangy peppers! Yum!! The complimentary cornbread and rolls were very good and stood out for me. Once our sushi arrived I could tell from its appearance only that I was not going to be wowed. I had the salmon with cheese roll and a salmon sushi. Sorry to say but the salmon was not of the best quality. It had a piece of the fish skin still attached and had this mushy consistency. It had a fishy taste as well, which fresh sushi grade salmon does not have. It was edible but definitely sub-par. I could have had the same quality sushi at an all you can eat buffet somewhere in Vegas. If I had purchased this sushi from a market pre-made for $2.50, I would have been content I guess. It was very very disappointing. The rest of the table had sushi with the exception of 1 who chose to order a chicken and veggie dish. Everyone had the same opinion, mediocre at best (and that's being nice) but not a good choice if you are into eating good quality sushi. I definitely will not be eating here again. 

The service was very good I must say, constantly checking on the table and making sure we had everything we needed was a delight.

2083708,2010-10-15,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"When my wife and I were planning our trip to Vegas, one of the reasons we decided to stay at THE Holel at Mandalay Bay was that we wanted to eat at RM Seafood.  We are big fans of Top Chef and Top Chef Masters, and when we learned that one of our favorites on the show, Rick Moonen, had a restaurant at Mandalay Bay, our decision was made.  

We decided to save the best for last (we hoped), so we waited till our last night of vacation to finally try out RM Seafood.  We didn't have a reservation, but we were seated right away in the more casual downstairs part of the restaurant.  We perused the menu, and there were so many things that sounded good that we had a hard time choosing.  Luckily, our primary server, Robby, patiently went over the menu with us, including walking us through the tasting menu that was being offered. The tasting menu sounded perfect; we would be able to sample five dishes from the menu that the chef had chosen.  Unfortunately one of the items was a scallop dish, and my wife hates scallops, so we thought that the tasting menu was not going to be an option.  Robby went back to the kitchen to talk to the chef, and he came back with the good news that they would substitue out the scallop dish for a halibut dish.  Hooray! 

The first thing that came out was an amuse-bouche of sturgeon on top of a fried ball of sushi rice. This was not one of the five items on the tasing menu, but it was served compliments of the chef.   It was awesome; I wish they brought out a dozen instead of just one each.

The first of the five dishes came next, the Ahi Tuna Duo.  This consisted of both seared and tartare tuna with avacado and yuzu soy sauce. This is an appetizer on the menu.  Wow, both the seared tuna and the tartare were delicious.  The yuzu soy sauce added just enough saltiness.  I would give this dish a 4.5 out of 5.  The only thing that would make it better would be a second portion, but we still had four more dishes to come, so there was nothing to complain about.

Next up was the halibut dish that they substituted for the scallops.  How lucky we were!  The nice sized piece of Alaskan halibut came on top of a carrot-cardomon puree that was to die for.  On top of the fish were celery root and shaved carrots.  This all came together perfectly.  The halibut  melted like butter in our mouths.  

Our third dish was the Wild Alaskan Salmon, served with brussell sprouts, bacon, and a horseradish cream.  I'm not a big fan of salmon, but this was delicious.  The salmon was lightly seared, and the skin side was crisp.  The horseradish cream combined with the bacon and brussell sprouts complimented the fish perfectly.  I guess I'm a bigger fan of salmon now.

Our fourth dish was actually something not on the menu, and it was not seafood.  It was actually pork cutlets pounded flat and breaded, served over button mushrooms and pearl onions.  Not something I was thinking of when coming to this restaurant, but it was so good i wanted to take one of my wife's cutlets.  She didn't think she would finish her portion, but before i was half way through my second cutlet, she had cleared off her plate.  This dish is something that would be a great addition to the menu for those who are not big seafood fans.

Finally, our final dish was a sampling of desserts.  This included toasted marshmallows, small pieces of brownies, roasted banana ice cream, and a small piece of the Fat Elvis which is an eggroll filled with chocolate, banana, and bacon.  All elements were great, but I think my favorite part was the ice cream.  The consistency was perfect, and the banana flavor was incredible.

As you can imagine the price for this is a bit expensive because of the variety of dishes.  Including  a glass of wine and a beer, and after subtracting $25 (thank you restaurants.com), our bill came to $191.  This included an 18% gratuity (thank you restaurants.com) and tax. Although the price is pretty high for two people, the quality and quantity of the food we received along with the excellent service from Robby and the rest of the wait staff made this well worth it.  If you are in Vegas and want to splurge a litte, I would highly recommend RM Seafood and specifically the tasting menu.  You'll be glad you did!",AveS9kKxrzFRSqhA5X6LYw,0,0,5,9iDUK7S6efyqRtG9-Ks7bA

Hudson Valley Foie Gras, slow roasted cauliflower, vine ripened preserved apricots, 20 year old balsamic and grilled flat bread. The savory and rich Foie Gras marries nicely with the sweetness of the preserved apricots...simply exquisite.

Tease:   Top Chef Master Champion, Rick Moonen's seafood restaurant in Las Vegas.

Why I went:  Because Rick Moonen is known to be a darn good chef!  We were in Vegas, and this stop was a must for us.

When:  11/18/13

Food:  My wife and I ordered up!  We started with some cocktails.  My wife had a Down for the Count, which was very refreshing.  I had Coffee & Cigarettes (with Fernet Branca and Laphroaig Scotch I believe).  It could possibly be THE BEST COACKTAIL I'VE EVER HAD!  Not kidding!  You have to love bitter, intense drinks...but man was that delicious!!!  The mixologist has won a number of competitions, and it's no wonder!  I had one more cocktail after dinner called a Boulevardier, which I think was a take on a Negroni with Scotch.  Another home run by the barman!  To start the meal, my wife had an amazingly well prepared Caesar salad and I had a clam chowder that was out of this world!  It was just rich enough without being too much so.  The littleneck clams in the soup were fresh, plentiful and tasty!  My wife and I both got the Surf & Surf.  It is 3 big shrimps on a mushroom mix, and a  1/2 lobster pouched on a truffle risotto.  We also added a  1/2 lb. of king crab.  It was a shellfish spectacular!  Every item was cooked to perfection!  The shrimp has a nice snap, the lobster was simply ridiculous, and the crab was just plain darn good.  We also shared some garlic bread and Brussels sprouts to add to the fun!  The garlic bread soaked up the wonderful sauces, and the sprouts kept us honest with some vegetation!

Service:  Simply excellent.  Carlo did a fantastic job in explaining all the dishes and making recommendations after talking with us about our likes and dislikes.  He did equally well with the cocktails.  Anyone that gets Carlos will have one of the most attentive and cool waiters one could have.

Hints/Final thoughts:  What's left to say?  If you like seafood and you're in Vegas; it would be a crime to pass up on RM Seafood.  Even if you were only to grab a cocktail and a snack...it's well worth it!  If you are up for a robust drink, ask for the Coffee & Cigarettes!",EBveE4oDk6AYWNUEs937mg,0,1,5,DX9embzKiQzGz1lTgYbPAw

My entree, the scallop dish, was amazing! You could definitely taste the freshness and the scallops were perfectly cooked. The accompanying sauce and vegetables matched perfectly.

My dining companion had two types of sushi, and also reported that they were very good. As it was the end of the night, perhaps there were some items left over, because they sent out a complimentary order of mashed potatoes, which were also pretty amazing!

A server promptly began by reciting their mantra of ""we are NOT about the portions"". And boy, were they right. My husband got the tasting menu and I opted for an appetizer and an ""entree"".  The appetizer was about the size of an amuse bouche and the ""entree""....the ""entree""....

My ""entree"" was the diver scallop ""anemone"".  One very small sized scallop and 2 tiny bits of abalone. This was my ""entree"".  For no less than $48. The taste was fine. Nothing to write home about. Nothing spectacular. 

Husband's tasting menu selections were also just ""fine"".  

The best part of the meal was the dessert...a chocolate car bomb. 

The entire experience is just too precious. Too contrived. Too pretentious. From what we saw of Rick Moonen on Top Chef Masters, I expected something more down to earth. Great seafood with a flair worthy of fine dining. All we got was someone trying too hard.",NLzCGvjxu046yoI4NdNYCw,0,0,2,9oF1N628feBJp8ML7FbPYw

Today she suggested that we try out this place and I am SSOOOO glad she did. Luckily it was fairly quiet by the time we got there and we were seated immediately. The server quickly came over and got our drink order.

Having been there before my girlfriend order an appetizer special that was to die for, but sadly I can't remember the name and it's not on the website. It had fresh cheese, watermelon, tomatoes, and croutons. I'm all about good cheese and this was clearly fresh and amazingly tasty.

I ordered the Cioppino with Pasta, while my friend order the Wagyu Beef Frites. I was a bit hesitant as Cioppino doesn't typically come with pasta but I was pleasantly surprised at the tasty huge, ring noodles and the stew itself was fantastic. You could tell the fish was fresh. You would have thought that I hadn't eaten in a week the way I dug into that dish.

I got the chance try a bite of her Wagyu and I immediately let out a, ""Yum."" I mean really, how wrong can you go with Wagyu anyhow, but this was so tasty and tender I wonder if I ordered the wrong meal. I suppose I'll just have to go back soon and try it out for myself.

All in all it was a great meal, great service, and great atmosphere. I have a huge aversion to the Strip in general, but this place made driving in traffic worth every second. If you are craving seafood and are at Mandalay Bay, I highly recommend RM Seafood. You won't be disappointed.",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,2,2,4,UeHipk0_k2J38uS10ZEQMw
2150542,2010-06-02,2,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"This is a review of the upstairs part of RM Seafood.

The Skinny: good food with some misses (3.5-4), excellent service that is well worth the visit (5+ stars!!).

For an upscale place, the price of a 5-course prix fixe is a really reasonable deal at $65 per person. 

This is a second visit for my hubby who tried this restaurant before it closed down earlier this year. The new menu is totally revamped and more innovative according to my hubby.

Of note, for me anyway, is the egg dish. It was definitely a symphony of flavours not to be forgotten - the marriage of root veggies mixed with egg, along with the goodness of bacon (mmmm.... bacon) and crunchy noodles - it was absolutely divine. The spider crab dish was both light, delicate, and flavourful. The salmon dish was well executed as well as the lamb loin. The foie gras was quite tasty as well.

I also tasted the ""China Pig"" and the Walu in Cherry leaf. Personally, I'm really picky about the Chinese food and to be frank - the dish needs a bit of work. The pork belly was not as crispy on the top or as tender on the bottom. The pork bun was not as well constructed as I would have liked. The Walu in cherry leaf was an odd dish because it left an odd sensation in my mouth after eating it - mildy numbing... a little weird.

Dessert - the chocolate car bomb is fantastic. The Italian Citrus - less so (I did like the olive oil ice cream but the citrus flavoured gelatin wrapped around the marscapone was texturally uninteresting.) The after dinner tea was both entertaining and enjoyable.

For the food alone, I would probably give this place maybe a 3.5-4 stars however the service pushes this restaurant over the top to give it a 4 star rating. The staff are friendly and personable. Our server really engaged us in conversation in a good and friendly way without being intrusive. It's a nice change from other high end places where the server has a stick in the butt attitude.

Chef Moonen came to our table to chat with us after hearing that my hubby and I are huge fans of Top Chef Masters. He really is kind of funny and dorky like he is on the show. This experience makes this restaurant well worth the price tag.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,2,4,_VoXT2_gtCC7MdMX3GDz8A

We started out with a small order or sashimi, which was quality stuff.  Our appetizers of clam chowder and california rolls (real crab!) were better than average.  Entrees were salmon with corn and edamame (edamame was forgettable) and cioppino, which was a little halibut-heavy but otherwise nice.  Dessert was a modified rocky road pudding with bites of brownie and toasted marshmallow (yay), and a ""Fat Elvis,"" which consisted of banana, peanut butter and bacon wrapped in a thin pastry and deep fried - very rich - delicious, but I could only finish one of the four pieces offered.  

Highlight of the meal had to be the Gardner Martini - Hendrick's gin, lemon or lime, and some basil - not sure what else.  Fantastic.  So happy the waiter recommended it!  

Would definitely go back, but would probably check out some of the numerous other restaurants in Las Vegas first.",PXTRLvB3UH0gn7QoGv-9XA,1,0,4,fRqmBuQFUm3RAtiQbdZrcw
2176567,2012-07-27,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"We ate in the downstairs dining room. 

NOTE: My 4 stars are only for the dishes I ordered and ate. I tried my friend's scallop with porkbelly dish and it was rubbery, overcooked with the pork slightly burn. I'd rate that dish as 1 star.

I tried an Oyster Sampler with my friend and it was painfully delicious. For this season, they plated 3 pacific oysters from Washington and California. The one from California was the size of my thumb and I was like ""I got jipped! What's this baby oyster crap?!"" But when I ate him, I was mind blown. This little guy had extremely subtle mother loving flavor that blew the other 2, which were great competitors, out of the water! All 3 items were extremely fresh, slid down my throat without a fight, and no fishy aftertaste (that's what he said!). 

Then, we ate Heirloom Tomato Salad and highly recommend it. The sweetness of the tomatoes were well accompanied by the silky burrata with hints of saltiness. This dish was so fresh that I actually felt healthy afterwards.

Lastly, I topped off my meal with Nigiri. 

Note: there are 2 sushi/sashimi menus; #1 is the ""Pristine offerings"" (AKA regular normal nigiri) and #2 is the ""RM."" 

I had the RM salmon belly, RM uni, albacore, and scallop. I can't stop saying fresh, but it was fresh! I liked everything but one thing I'll complain about is the dehydrated strawberry on the RM uni. Mm, I thought I was eating the strawberry from Kellog's special K. So yeah, I didn't appreciate the texture and the tartness it was suppose to supply to the uni. I definitely appreciated the bit of jalapeno in the RM uni though. Nice touch!

why, you ask?
reading all of these awful reviews makes me ask myself that exact same question.
it basically boils down to the fact that i know what i'm talking about and everyone else can just go suck it!
=o)  (i'm totally kidding, btw.......maybe)

i've used a restaurant.com certificate each time i've dined here (4 times total, i believe).
being able to save a few bucks on a dining experience on the strip in las vegas is a positive experience in itself. 
+1 star.
rm seafood uses sustainable fishing practices and supports local business.
+1 star.

for starters, the calamari is the best i've ever had.
you get this giant bowl of calamari with the most divine peppers all mixed in.
ya can't beat it at $15.

i've had the salmon, halibut, branzino and swordfish.
all were seasoned and cooked to perfection.
trust me, i'm super picky when it comes to cooked fish and the chefs at rm know how to cook fish.
i've yet to have an overcooked piece of fish here and am doubtful that will ever be the case.

i know that service can be hit or miss wherever you go.
it's all luck of the draw, as far as i'm concerned.
luckily for me, i've had outstanding service at rm every visit.
i've even taken my mom here and if any of you know chinese moms you'll understand me when i say ""even she had nothing to complain about!""

side note: 
don't order sushi from here.
seriously, don't order sushi from a non-sushi restaurant.
don't order sushi from a restaurant where the sushi chef is younger than you and is NOT japanese.
these are all just general rules of thumb.
why they attempt to make sushi at rm is beyond me but i'm smart enough to know that it's not going to live up to my standards therefore will never order it.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,11,10,5,JY16oKbCDLP4offgLXVwvg

The food was very good, but not great, as the prices and reputation of Rick Moonen might portend.  The chef was in the restaurant the night we went, which was a friend's birthday.  We live in Vegas and were excited to go to RM.  However, I had a bit of trepidation after reading reviews here.  They were right on, vis-à-vis the service.  I have had better service at Wendy's.  The waiter was largely absent, forgetful, rude and pushy.  My wife even asked him if he was drunk, as his service was so lacking.  It was really shocking.  The funny thing was that there were ""expeditors"" running around with head sets, pretending to do things, though what, I'm not sure.  

Service aside, the food was lush.  My wife and our birthday friend had the Arctic Char, which was amazing.  I had red snapper in panang curry.  The fish was super and cooked perfectly, the curry was a bit underwhelming.  The birthday boy's wife had the poke, which was the best thing served that night IMHO.  The roasted brussell sprouts with apples and horseradish were a real treat.  For desert, I ordered the maple cheesecake, which was served in a white chocolate ball with snicker doodle crumbles.  Very creative and tasty.  

Overall the food deserves four stars, but the service is clearly one star level.  So, I'm going to be generous and give it three.  Maybe just because we saw the celebrity chef, whom I can't believe would allow his place to be run this way.  Nice food, but we won't be going back.

My girlfriends and I purchased a travelzoo deal for a four course dinner and champagne for $89/couple. We made reservations ahead of time and were seated soon after we arrived. Each of us had a glass of champagne, and our meal started off with a salmon appetizer, followed by a choice of apple walnut salad or clam chowder, and both were delicious and filling. They also gave us biscuits and cornbread at the table. Our main course was cioppino, which was huge and full of shrimp, mussels, fish, and prawns. It also had large pieces of pasta, which we didn't eat as there was way too much food.

Now to the best part: for dessert, we had an ice cream mystery game. 16 mystery flavors in an array of colors and smells were presented to us in small scoops, along with a blank answer sheet. The flavors varied from delicious nutella, mai tai, and pistachio to gawd-awful sriracha sauce (yes, the Asian cock sauce-- which deceivingly looked like mango), celery (I TOTALLY thought it was going to be lime and was DISASTROUSLY wrong), and tomato (I initially thought it was rotten sorbet).

We are locals.  
We made reservations for the Sunday 9:30 brunch, got there at 9:40 am after being lost in the casino for 10 minutes (we used the $15 valet) and even with directions from two different people the place was hard to find.   
So the place must have seating for 150 people; when we got there, there was one party of four ahead of us who had been seated.   So we waited in the almost empty cavernous bowls of the establishment for 10 minutes
So where were we finally seated?   You guessed it, right next to the party of four (I have never understood why this happens).   
So we waited.  And waited.   And waited, all the while watching the waiter making numerous trips to the kitchen for things for the other table, you know, one trip for a spoon, one trip for butter, one trip for jelly, one trip for a napkin, one trip for coffee.   Luckily, we had brought the morning paper.   Guess what, huh?   We read the entire paper before our order was taken at 10:25!
Gave the food a C rating.  Waiter gets an F.  Decor: A.

The clam chowder was one of the best we have ever had,  We are big fans of clam chowder and had a great one at our wedding which I think is the only one to rival this one.  This clam chowder wasn't to creamy which is so often a problem.  You could really taste the clams and there were some wonderful herbal flavors.  

For our main courses, my husband got the Fish and Chips and I got the Cioppino.  First the Fish and Chips were light and fluffy with very good flavor.  The cioppino was by far the best I've ever had,  They feature a fish of the day plus shrimp clams and mussels.  Our fish was halibut, which I don't usually like but this was cooked wonderfully.  The tomato broth was full of flavor and the pasta was very fresh.

Wife and I usually do one fancy meal while in Vegas, so luckily a month before Yelp Spring Break, I bought this Groupon: $46 for up to $92: Two entrees up to $36, plus a carafe of house wine(reg $20). Score!

$36 Turbot: WTF is Turbot? It was the coolest sounding fish entree...I mean, how many restaurants carry ""Turbot""? Luckily it tasted as delicious as its name with the mustard sauce and cavier topping.  

$32 Cobia: The lovely wife also decided to order a hard to find fish.  Unfortunately, the Cobia was ok...the sauce was so overpowering that we could barely taste the actual fish itself.  Maybe Cobia is so bland that it needs a sauce like that? 

$16 BBQ Style Mac N Cheese ""Side"": REALLY GOOD! Its probably a 2000 calorie meal itself as there is a healthy amount of pulled pork in there.  This could really be shared between 3-4 people.  Sadly we left about a 1/3rd of it... 

$20 House White Wine: Don't remember what it was, but it was nothing memorable.

Total cost was about $80 with the Mac N Cheese, tax, and tip...not too shabby for a nice meal in Vegas. Service was good overall, as our wine glasses and water glasses were never more than half empty, though we noticed the Manager never came by to ""Hi"" to us, or the table next to us, whom also had the same Groupon.

2463505,2012-12-13,1,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Honesty alert.  Months and months before our trip to Vegas - I scoured Groupon for deals on dining establishments in Vegas.  I like to save money - who doesn't right?  This place popped up, and I wanted to go to one sassy, overpriced place as our big romantic dinner/night out.  Jiminy Christmas was this place expensive even with the $50 or whatever off.  The place was jazzy and sassy - very upscale environment.  We were downstairs so have no idea what the upstairs was all about.  Ask a stock broker.

After realizing what I had done - we decided to go big and order like we meant business.  Seeing how we live in MO and hardly have any decent seafood joints - we wanted to taste the rainbow of the seafood world.  We went for the crab cakes on the appetizer front, which were very delicious.  We both ordered the same entree, which I believe was a special at the time  - a seafood platter consisting of all the awesomeness the ocean has to offer minus oysters because oysters are just gross.  The biggest splurge was definitely Maine lobster, which I love.  The food was really, really quite good and so very fresh.  

The service was exquisite - this was one of those establishments that had an assigned server as well as water, beverage, and dish patrol.  The place was very well kept - everything was tidy and clean.  Nice place all around, and we had a very pleasurable dining experience.  I give it 5 stars for all the quality points on food, service, ambiance, and so forth.

The dining room has a nice airy feeling to it with lots of shiny chrome and little mirrors to accent the interior.  Tables and chairs are all stained wood and the smooth melamine white vinyl couches are firm and cushiony.  The hostess sat me down with a double-sided menu, a catalog of available wines and an order form for raw oysters.  My waiter, Julius, came around right away to greet me and take my drink order and offer me water.  When it was determined I didn't want wine or oysters those menus quickly disappeared from the table.

Most of the main dishes that the restaurant serves are seafood-based, but I did notice a beef burger on the lunch menu.  In addition the second side of the menu offered nigiri, sashimi, sushi and Asian inspired appetizers.  I wasn't quite clear on some of the ingredients listed, and the waiter was excellent in answering my questions as well as giving me a little background on Executive Chef Rick Moonen.

After consulting with the waiter I ordered the Warm Soba appetizer and two specialty rolls, the California Roll (I was playing it safe!) and the Ebi Go Roll.  The waiter returned with disposable chopsticks, a ceramic soup spoon and a shaker of soy sauce.  Considering that the dining room was more than half full the time lines on the food were excellent.

The Warm Soba (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg?select=0AWoj6zm-riOcrL2irrXYA) was excellent with thin strands of dark-colored soba noodles in a flavorful dashi (broth).  Nice fatty pieces of braised pork belly circled the rim of the bowl and in the center was a delightful soft boiled quail egg.  As described the soba was warm.

Both of the rolls arrived on the same platter.  The California Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg?select=JqumIcuWOSYljeqMuu6ydg) was mostly minced up blue crab with a bit of ripe avocado and crunchy cucumber.  Topped by toasted sesame seeds the roll was very good.  The Ebi Go Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg?select=O7vm8KezcXcZVUtj5givbQ) was magnificent.  It is crunchy tempura shrimp with Kabayaki, avocado and jalapenos, wrapped in sushi rice then wrapped again with fresh tuna and topped with a jalapeno sauce and micro cilantro.  I loved the texture comparison between the soft tuna and the crunchy shrimp as well as the flavor contrasts between the tuna and the jalapenos.  Both rolls were made very well too as all of the ingredients stayed intact and did not fall apart.

The server we had showed a nice depth of wine knowledge and general pairings of the sauces and varietals.  Nice to see someone taking their job seriously.  Also the education about the restaurant and the focus of sustainable fish selections as well as being able to tell us exactly why pacific sea bass is NOT on the menu.  Dinner is off to a fantastic start!  

We got a bottle of wine and a martini at the table along with a tuna sashimi with puffed rice, a roll and some soup for an appetizer.  Everything was amazing and fresh.  Still kicking ass and quickly becoming one of my 4 star recommendations.

Then something happened.... but I don't know what it was.  We were waiting to order our meal, finished the apps and the person with the martini finished their drink.  We were kind of sitting there looking around and had to ask another server in the area to locate our server so we could get another drink and put in our dinner order.  We actually got our dinners before the 2nd cocktail made it to the table.  4 stars slowly slip sliding away... lol.

The entrees were absolutely delicious.  We had the catch of the day, linguini and clams and some sashimi for dinner.  As fresh and delicious as the fish was, the sides seemed boring and more suited for a steak house.  I think the options were fries, brussel sprouts, mashed and green beans .  I was a little disappointed not to see some options like a spring salad, cucumber salad, or any other side that might cleanse the pallet and really show off the fresh fish.  There were also steak and chicken options.  I guess I could have browsed the sushi menu for a side, but that only comes as an after thought.  It would have been nice for some of those options to be there for you to think ""hey, that's a really good option with fish!""

Kushi oysters, shrimp cocktail, tuna 2-ways, heirloom tomato and burata salad with king crab, chorizo corndogs, and steamed King crab.  Sound good? Hell ya it does.  Taste good? NO.

Slide me a steak done to perfection, or a succulent lobster prepared by one of America's best chefs, and I'm going to slide a horrendus amount of cash into that nice leather check holder (actually I give them my credit card - the only way I would be carrying that much cash is if I had just robbed a bank).

But After watching Chef Rick Moonen on Top Chef Masters, I wanted something less ordinary.  Something over-the-top.  A high risk masterpiece.

RM Seafood in Mandalay Bay delivers.

Our quest for the culinary extraordinary landed us with:

Steak Tartar - not unheard of, but not common either.  Served with shaved truffles, another delight rarely found on my plate.

Moon'n Doggies - corn dogs made with shrimp and tilapia.  I don't think you are even allowed to be this creative in a restraunt unless you are a celeberty chef.  Subtle flavors and not cheap tasting.  Other than it's outer appearance, it's nothing like a corn dog.

4x4x2 - 16 scoops of ice cream, served for two people.  What flavor?  That's where the fun comes in.  Each scoop is different, and most are completely out of the ordinary.  If you can guess what all of them are, dessert is free.  Our waiter said he had never seen anyone get them all.  

We arent talking standard flavors here either.  There was no strawberry on our plate.  There was a cheesecake one though.

The challenge made dessert way more fun than any dessert we have ever had.  Even when we knew we wernt going to get them all, the fun continued with frozen flavors that you may recognize, but as an ice cream, your brain won't make the connection.  We emptied all but 2 of the dishes, and even licked a couple of them clean.

If you are a fan of television cooking competition shows where the chefs are given formidable challenges, I strongly recommend ordering some of the more unusual dishes at RM",cMAiTrM0Fxm8vKLQag53jg,0,0,4,U8Uky2mIOJOzsAVMV3-YAA

2596229,2010-08-18,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Damn. You must order the Rhode Island Style Calamari.
My only advice: Eat it fast. Unlike your typical calamari in which you dip it into the sauce yourself, this comes pre-dressed in a special marinara sauce with garlic and pickled chili peppers that is to freaking die for. Only thing is that because it does come pre-dressed, the calamari gets soggy really fast, but for me this was a minor hindrance, not a dealbreaker.

It was my first time here, but my buddies had been before and raved about their Catfish Sloppy Joes. I was skeptical because: 1) I don't like catfish, and 2) fish + sloppy joe sounded strange to me. I still got it, and it tasted exactly as it's described. Pretty good, but at the same time, nothing spectacular (esp. for $15). If anything, I'd be just as satisfied eating a regular sloppy joe made out of Grade F ground beef (if not more so, because this has that catfish funk that I'm not a fan of). Funny thing is though, after taking leftovers back home, this sandwich actually IMPROVES. But then again, I don't go to a sit-down restaurant with the intent to take home leftovers, I go to a restaurant to eat food THERE, so I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

If I could do it over, I would just order the calamari for myself as my entree and I'm good. Maybe I'd ask for the sauce on the side if possible though.

We were initially excited about going to this restaurant because of the eclectic dinner menu.  Veal tongue that was $20 per oz. (recommended 4 oz), lamb's belly & rabbit.  Bring it on.

The appetizers started out really well.  My husband had the tasting menu, and I ordered a few dishes from the regular menu.  The octopus, steak & eggs, hot & cold foie gras all started out very well. 

After that, that was when it progressively got from so-so to just frustrating bad.  The scallops were wayy too salty.  The halibut was ok, but the puree that came along on the halibut was NOT.  The flavor didn't compliment each other AT ALL.  The rabbit was ok.  It was cooked 3 ways - in some instances slightly bland; and left nothing to be desired.  The veal tongue was the biggest WORSE disappointment.  We got 4 oz of this - which mind you now made this entree $80.  I was expecting some form of perfection.  Instead, this dish is really some steak (which was very very very bad), and then the veal tongue is chopped into tiny eensy pieces served in a bao.  which is like a chinese bun.  So for $80; you ended up eating a bun and some bad steak.  The bun totally took over all the flavors of the tongue. It seem liked a chef's attempt to make a racy meal mainstream; but seriously?  If I cared about that shit, i wouldn't have ordered tongue in the first place.  I WANTED to taste the damn veal tongue. 

Lastly, we had the  lamb belly entree.  We took a bite and left the rest of the entree on the plate.  It WAS that bad. 

Dessert & some liquid nitrogen drink they prepared table side afterward was pretty awesome; but after our entrees being the worse part of dinner; we were so ready to leave.  so disappointing.",XUZmOFF1mRp9pg3phxFKeg,0,0,3,R7eO7bvEyQqgwDX6-NpMZw

We ate upstairs in the more formal dining area.  It was a really beautiful space.  If you have a pookie, I would recommend requesting the side by side booths.  Very private and comfortable.  A great place to hide out, cuddle, tickle, smooch, grab knees, and talk to your heart's delight.  Only funny thing is that the walls on the little spaces keep you from seeing when your server is coming over, so they will kind of suddenly pop out of nowhere with your things and to check on you.

We received exceptional service, probably because we were there at 5:30pm and were literally the only table.  We were in a hurry, as we had a wedding to attend at 7pm in the Mandalay.  We got the abalone appetizer, which was delicious.  For dinner we got two fish, the cobia and marlin, which were on special.  Everything was presented well, and prepared with wonderful combinations of fresh ingredients, but both of the fish were a little overcooked unfortunately.  The wine list was huge and the recommendations from our server were great.

Crab cake was good, but nothing special and my wife loved the mac and cheese with crab.  then the bill came.  Turns out they added a 35 dollar surcharge for the crab substitute.  Maybe we should have asked about it but we assumed since they didn't have the pork, the substitues offered wouldn't be an up charge.

RM is located downstairs near the Mandalay Bay casinos. Known for their specialty of seafood and the fact that the owner Rick Moonen appeared on Top Chef Masters as a contestant.

There were more raw vegetables in the soup than anything else. I didn't even taste the clams. The salmon with a potato crust was odd. They weren't two flavors that meshed as well for me, and I didn't enjoy the dish at all. The Mac & Cheese with pulled pork was absolutely disgusting. I'm so sad because I love Mac & Cheese. Now usually people eat ribs with a side of Mac & Cheese. It is a perfectly normal combination. But the pulled pork inside of the Mac & Cheese...so wrong.

We came for an early dinner, most of the dining room was empty yet someone thought it was a good idea to sit us outside?  Ordered the Calamari for an appetizer and it looked thrown together and improperly cooked.  The presentation was horrible, it looked like a tomato explosion with some Calamari on top.  The batter was still soggy and pieces were sticking together.  We also got the Albacore Tataki, something on the description about it with jalapeno sold us on it.....but when it came out all it had was some jalapeno julienne'd and off to the side.  The Albacore was over-seared and tough.  I ordered something with Kobe beef and I pronounced it Ko-Beh like it's supposed to be, and our server actually had the gaul and said ""Oh you mean Ko-Beeee"".

During Restaurant Wars, the contestants battled it out in this restaurant. Being an advocate for sustainable seafood, I knew I had to try it when I was in town. Tataki Sushi here in SF has the same concept. Hopefully this trend catches on nation wide.

Bf and I wanted to try as many things as possible and since I usually like appetizers more than entrees we decided to go that way. We started out with a small chilled platter: 1/2 Lobster, 6 Oysters, 3 Clams, 3 Shrimp, Mussels and an RM Escabeche. Everything was mouthwateringly fresh. 

I had to try some sushi when I saw the Shot and Roll: Seared Foie Gras Wrapped in a Tempura Roll topped with Uni, accompanied by a sake bomb. There is nothing that I love more than foie gras and uni. This had to be the end all be all! And I didn't care one bit that it was $32. Disappointment soon followed when I saw that it was only four pieces. The foie gras was fine but not mind blowing like at Michael Mina. The uni was small in portion but still good. The idea is amazing but someone needs to take it and run with it. 

Our Moon Doggies Shrimp Corn Dogs with Cole Slaw and Cilantro Mayo were awesome. These are definitely the best ""corn dogs"" I've had. The best, crisp yet soft exterior were perfect with the savory shrimp on the inside. 

The main dish was a Rainbow Trout Brussels Sprouts, Bacon and Horseradish Cream. YUM YUM YUM! Just get it.

I thought the Red Velvet Whoopie Pies with Coconut Milkshake was a playful dessert though the cake was a bit dry. I did love the milkshake though. It was smooth and flavorful and would have been a very adult milkshake indeed if it were not for the overload of sprinkles. Though we didn't try it, they also had an ice cream tasting test of 16 flavors for dessert. You have to match the scoops with the answers on a card they give you. I love that the desserts are fun here!

My fish and chips were over-battered, undercooked, fish sticks served along some potato wedges.  This is barely acceptable food at a cheapo small-town diner.

He recommended the lobster bisque and we both conceded to the recommendation. I ordered the Surf and Surf (lobster, shrimp over a mushroom and truffle risotto) and my wife got the linguine and clams. When the bisque came it was not hot and was warm at best. My wife and eye locked eyes at the same time, though her frowny yuck face came on very quick. The bisque had a slightly bitter off putting taste to it. Not necessarily flavor but an aftertaste that as slightly harsh. The bread came to the table about three quarters through the consumption of the bisque. Our server reprimanded the kid who brought the bread late a little too close to our table. Close enough for us to hear and react to it. Main courses were ok, but my Surf and Surf at $60 does not seem like the most value for what I received. Only complaint was one of the shrimp had a gritty portion of the sand vein remaining. My wife loved her linguine and clams.

The four of us all started with a bowl of clam chowder and we all wanted more. It was really delicious. Not too much BS like potatos or other filler ingredients. The clams were tender, not chewy. The bacon added smoky-ness and texture. 

We then shared steamed clams which was delicious. There were only two pieces of long croutons so we almost had to fight each other for them. But the garlic toast was perfect with the steamed clams. 

If would have been five stars if they only served bread - for dipping in steamed clams sauce...but we were told by our waiter that they don't serve bread at lunch.

The downstairs part of the restaurant felt perfect for us since we were on a budget but wanted to eat somewhere semi lavish and chic.  (Per their website, average tab = $40 per person.)

The menu was impressive and provided us picky eaters with a diverse selection.  You had the choice of ordering from the dinner menu (with their usual entrees) or from the sushi bar.

To start off our meal, we were served warm, toasty corn bread and biscuits.  Loved, loved, loved the corn bread!

And although I warned my friends not to eat too heavy before our nighttime festivities, I caved in and ordered the Diver Scallops - served on angel hair pasta with lemon caper sauce.  It was definitely on the rich creamy side, but delicious nevertheless.  Not to mention, these were some of the biggest scallops I've ever seen in my life!

For dessert, we shared red velvet whoopie pies.  You can never go wrong with red velvet.

Food-wise = 4 stars. Service? 2 stars.

Something about our night was off, and it was most likely because: (1) two Southern men sitting next to us kept gawking at my friend's legs the whole night; (2) the service.

Our waiter was kinda funny but awkward.  In addition, he brought us our bill early because supposedly another waiter told him that we asked for it (which we did not).  As a result, it was hard for us to not feel rushed and uncomfortable.

There's no kid menu, but they were happy to make a plain, grilled chicken breast for our son. He deemed it the best chicken he's ever had. At $17 for a kid-sized portion, it better be.

We sat on the ""patio"" (It is literally outside of the restaurant but indoors...confusing? Yes but go w/ it). We came here for a quick and lighter lunch on a Sunday.

Let's get to what's important - the food!  One may think seafood - run of the mill fish, raw bar, etc (that was what I was thinking) but to the contrary - very creative and modern takes on classics.  We started with the Crab Cake and it was practically 100% lump crab. Hardly any filler and things to keep it together. Very moist, beautiful golden char. The little carrot salad on the side was pickley and crunchy! Delicious starter!

Hubs ordered the Fish in Chips and I I ordered the Lobster Rolls.  
Me: ""Fish in Chips? What does that mean?"" I assumed a run of the mill battered white fish with fries on the side. TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS NO SUCH THING!!!! 

It was a beautiful presentation of turbot crusted with potato chips and fried to a golden brown!  I did a double take as I couldn't believe that is what was ordered!  It was truly a creative take on Fish & Chips!  My lobster roll also did not disappoint. The lobster was lightly dressed in mayo and I could taste the freshness and natural taste of the Maine lobster.  With one order, there are two rolls and it was certainly the best lobster roll I have had (and I have had some tasty ones in Boston).

For dessert, we ordered the Decadent Chocolate (chocolate brioche bread pudding, chocolate raspberry mousse and chocolate ice cream) - a true Chocolate Lovers delight (Hubs loved it...I am not really a fan of chocolate).  Licked the bowl clean!

We were hoping that he was going to be at the restaurant, but we had missed him by ONE day. He flew out to NY the day we were there. But the meal still blew me away (with or without Chef Moonen's presence, although that would have been icing on the cake)

We had the five course meal and the three course meal and shared all the courses. The service was really impeccable (our server was just ok, but everyone else were top notch). 

First, we started with a salad of burrata, braised tomato vinagrette, lobster tail, and squash blossom tempura. OMG holy cow. The burrata was light and melted in your mouth. The sweetness and the acidity of the tomato vinagrette helped cut through the creaminess of the burrata. The squash blossom tempura was surprisingly super crunchy and added a wonderful textural component. How if that wasn't enough, there was a tender piece of lobster tail sitting in the middle of the plate waiting to be devoured. Very good portion. Exquisite. 

Sweet Corn Soup with Fresh Blue Crab: The soup captured the very essence of the sweet corn. It was light, but had a touch of cream to it. I liked the flavor a lot and the soup was not too overpowering as to mute the flavor of the sweet crab. The portion was smaller, but I thought it was just the right amount because I could see the flavor getting a bit monotonous if one consumed too much. All in all- a very good soup.

Rick Moonen's Clam chowder- I am lactose intolerant, but this soup was so addicting, and so hearty. I wish I could have had more than a few bites, because it was so delicious. The soup had a smoky flavor to it from either bacon or a ham hock. There was a generous amount of clams (you know they were freshly shucked) and fresh potatoes and your typical mirepoix . Again, very hearty and all in all a very good soup. Also a really good portion. 

Seared scallop with hot and sour sauce over seared eggplant: The scallop had a nice sear on both sides and was presented over a seared eggplant. I like all of the things seperately, but I thought the sauce, although delicious, overpowered the sweetness of the scallop. However, the sauce went perfectly with the eggplant, and it was actually my favorite part of the dish. 

Ciopinno- solid ciopinno with fresh seafood, al dente pasta, served with garlic bread. The ciopinno had crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, and fresh fish. I like a little spice to my ciopinno, but this was definitely legit. 

9 oz filet with whipped potatoes and red wine reduction- Good cut of meat, legit potatoes, and the wine reduction was a good accompaniment. My only complaint was that they overcooked the filet just a little, but I'm assuming that's just how its prepared by the chef, because we never specified how we wanted the filet cooked. 

Rocky Road- chocolate pudding, homemade marshmallows, candied peanuts, vanilla ice cream, brownie bits, and a drizzle of passion fruit syrup. It sounds weird but it  all worked together. The saltiness and the crunch of the peanuts worked well with all the other sweet components tot he dish I liked it. 

Fat Elvis: Fried spring rolls with a banana, peanutbutter, and chocolate filling, then rolled in cinnamon sugar with a passion fruit dipping sauce. It sounds weird, but it was actually pretty good. I hate bananas so I had to take the banana out. It was ooey and gooey and at the same time crunchy from the wrapper. I especially liked it with the passionfruit. 

All in all, I was satisfied with the meal. I was surprised with the portion size, and I was stuffed at the end of the meal. I would definitely go back.

The five course was $75, and the 3 course was $55 (add $15 for the filet)

2847320,2012-05-24,3,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Copied below is the e-mail I sent to RM's General Manager - - 

Over the last few years, I had visited RM Seafood (upstairs/fine dining) three times before my most recent and, what is now, my last time.

What a shame this place has become. 

Having the bar set and defended so very high, seeign it drop so very low makes it all that more unfortunate.

The tasting menu has always been the way to go - no longer. Even the normal plated dishes/meals have gone downhill. While the fish is always very well prepared, fish cannot stand alone.

Worst yet, on my most recent visit, I brought along a small group of friends who were, based on my prior experience, guaranteed an excellent meal. They, too, could not have been more disappointed. 

I rightly upsold RM based on prior experiences but I could not transport them back to the RM Seafood of old.

We were a party of 5 with an 8:00PM reservation under my name (REMOVED).

The tasting menu now seems very planned and structured around a set lineup as opposed to what is best and most fresh/appropriate with no variation. Sadly, it is not a good lineup.

You are now playing with flavors that do not reflect fine dining 

The amuse-bouche really did set the tone for the meal and I should have paid closer attention to that - ending the meal abruptly. A morsel of strawberry with a lump of lobster was reflective of the silly dishes that would follow and pales in comparison to the prior dishes I remember so well.

Cheesecake cream with a waffle slice and bubble gum sorbet is childish and not inspired.

Very chewy baby octopus with foie gras foam is ill-advised.

Bacon foam too is not appropriate.

Slices of rabbit and a lamb osso bucco at RM Seafood says more about the on-site chef(s) than it does Rick Moonen and RM Seafood. And serving carrot in any form with rabbit is now tongue through cheek. 

I truly hope these dishes were conceived outside of Mr. Moonen's direct feedback and taste.

Recommending  1/2 bottles of wine and then double charging when you bring a whole bottle is a sneaky, albeit lucrative, practice.
 
This is pure and honest feedback for you and not a customer recovery opportunity. Unless I get word from a trusted colleague, who might visit you against my advice, that the ship has been righted, I will not be returning.

As much as I hope, I also suspect, I am not in the minority in my opinion.  

Additionally, I hope you, Paul, will garner the kind of attention an e-mail such as this requires -- not only for your benefit but also for the sake of Rick Moonen's very good name and his previously very good restaurant.",f8YMQZH0xxg3ZyhoQHh3LQ,4,3,1,img8YcTckx0gY4INbFf36g
2848969,2011-02-02,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"It's official, we love RM Seafood.  We came here on our last night in Vegas in hopes of salvaging our Vegas-foodie loving adventures and it was amazing!  You could say we weren't expecting much after having dined at Craftsteak and being pretty disappointed.  However, every dish we had here exceeded our expectations.

Appetizers - Bibb lettuce salad, oysters on the half shell, and the famous Moon doggies.  The salad was light and refreshing with the right amount of vinaigrette.  The oysters were fresh and tasty (a nice recommendation from our waitress).  The Moon doggies were really good.  Light batter around with a very tasty filling.  I'm not usually a corn dog fan, but I'd eat these everyday if I could.

Main entree - I had the Lobster Bolognese and my husband had the Artic Char.  The bolognese was filling with a good amount of lobster, but the Artic Char was by far our favorite.  Nice flavor with crispy potatoes on the side...yummy!

Dessert - We shared the Key Lime Pie.  It was heaven!  I don't know how someone comes up with a cilantro syrup to accompany a key lime pie, but thank you for being a genius!  It was sublime.  For once my husband had to let me eat my half of the dessert.  Needless to say, he wasn't very happy to share. :)

Overall, Rick Moonen knows how to get the job done and I really liked that he was in the restaurant schmoozing with guests.  Shows that he really keeps an eye out for the quality of his food.  Loved, loved, loved it!",8mmJzsavALt6YyJrJRCw6g,1,1,5,9R8rXOV5RzWALFFcRQ9mZA

Rick Moonen and his staff are doing great work with wonderful choices of SUSTAINABLE foods.  Upstairs the 5-course dinner menu for $65 is the best deal you could experience.  Hubby and I enjoyed the Black & White Scallops; Spider Crab (melt in your mouth amazing); Bacon and Eggs (eggs from a farm off the grid); Onion Soup; Baked Tasmanian; Walu in Cherry; China Pig (this dish not my favorite, but glad I tried it); Rabbit Trio with risotto (so delish) and the deserts from the pastry chef were just so inventive and incredible:  Chocolate Car Bomb and Italian Citrus.  Later the pastry chef also made us her version of Creme Brulee and it shouldn't be missed.  I don't order Creme Brulee ever, because no one does it that great .... but this version is like nothing else you've ever experienced.  Go, go quickly, and enjoy.   Have a cocktail at the bar before dinner; the Rhumba was fabulous.  Save your tummy space for all the wonderful food and skip the wine; it's quite pricey if you are on a sustainable budget :)",cfUhGLcPgA2dS-9TSUBYgg,1,0,5,95AmHLMjrwusPC9ubfoExw

Arriving without reservations and in a hurry, we were greeted warmly and seated immediately.  The hostess sent our waiter right over, and within in three minutes we had ordered drinks and food without ever opening a menu!

We started with a Prosecco by the glass, which was delicious and ice cold.  Then came Caesar Salad.  It was presented ""whole leaf"" style, with some shaved aged parmesan on top.  The dressing was perfect, obviously freshly made with just the right mix of tangy garlicky tinge of anchovy good-ness.  Not too much dressing and amazing chewy garlic breadsticks for croutons.  MMMMM! (As a side note, we had Caesar Salad at Craftsteak the night before that couldn't hold a candle to the RM version!)

Next came the lump crab cake with jicama slaw and an order California Rolls from the happy hour special menu.  Both were excellent.  Although crab cakes are not a very difficult or exotic menu item, we have had some REALLY bad ones in Vegas, even in ""good"" restaurants.  The crab was moist, fresh tasting, and plentiful. The flavor was classic, but the chili sauce underneath was spicy and gave it a little kick that blended great with the crunchy sweetness of the jicama. Could have been a little hotter in the middle, but overall we loved it.  The California Rolls were some of the best we've had, with lots of crab and the best tasting avocado.  Again, not very exotic but obviously top notch.  With our Prosecco glasses kept full and a basket of warm cornbread and biscuits with whipped butter we were very very happy! 

Somewhere in the middle of our meal, we decided to change to Vodka Gimlets.  This drink was hands down the best mixed drink we have had in Vegas!  If you enjoy hand-crafted fresh cocktails, don't miss this bar!  Our waiter told us the bartender placed high in some huge contest, but we were so into our food and drinks I can't quite remember what the contest was....but his drinks were phenomenal, that I can attest to!

The last thing we tried at RM was the toasted marshmallow chocolate pudding.  My husband was dubious, but I am a sucker for marshmallows and had to try it. We both love it!  Creamy pudding, handmade toasted marshmallow cubes, chewy brownie bites, and crunchy nuts....it was comfort food upleveled to greatness.  Try it!

Overall, we just can't understand all the petty reviews of this place. Every staff member we spoke with was friendly, happy, helpful, and kinda cool.  We were given perfect service, amazing food, stellar drinks, and a beautiful atmosphere.  All of this and getting it to us FAST too!  As I mentioned earlier, we tried Tom Collichio's Craftsteak the night before.  NOT good.  Not even close to RM for service, quality of food, or ambiance.  If you are looking for a bargain, RM isn't the place for you.  In fact, Vegas probably isn't the place for you. But this restaurant is one we will return to for sure!

Starter, I picked the clam chowder since the server sold it hard. Salty lacking seafood taste and only ok. The scallops with papaya salad was my main. Scallops were excellently prepared but 2 scallops seems a little cheap. Papaya salad was ordinary Western taste, lacking fish sauce and the all famous balak. I wanted to like this place since Rick is a great chef (he still comes in often and works, unlike the many other famous restaurants in Vegas were the chef never comes) but because of the price fix menu, I would have never ordered what I did. But really the famous clam chowder should not be what RM Seafood is known for.

Though we were here mid-week and seated at 7pm, the kitchen service was terrible.  After placing our order we waited over 45 minutes for our soups and salads.  Our main courses followed 30 minutes later. Though the waiter kept checking with the kitchen, he could not get our food delivered in a timely manner.

The waiter promised that the manager would come over to speak with us, but he never showed his face.  I WOULDN'T EITHER.  The manager obviously was not monitoring the kitchen staff and their delivery times (that's what restaurant managers are supposed to do!).  The waiter did treat everyone in our party to a glass of house red wine - WOO-HOO (big deal) !

I had the clam chowder for a starter course.  The soup was tasty and filling.
For a main course I had the clams and linguini.  The pasta was swimming in olive oil and butter.  WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE.  Some french bread to mop it up would have been nice!  No one came over to offer parmesan cheese for any of our pasta dishes.

The serving sizes were sufficient and a decent value - HOWEVER, beginning 2 hours later I spent the entire night in the bathroom with stomach cramps and diarrhea.

Not a pleasant visit.

We bought these coupons for 33% off, what we didnt know is that it only applied on a small section of the menu and so ending up we didnt really even use the coupon and paid full price.

It was pricey, which we anticipated. The food however was lacking. it was small portions and nothing seemed to wow us. I gave this place 3 stars because I didn't think it was that bad. but my friends who I came with trashed down on the place. 

I had the surf and turf roll, it was 6 small pieces and the insides of it was good but the seared tuna on top was not.

Never eat seafood at vegas. it's never fresh.. think about out. Vegas = Desert= no ocean= no fish = fish trucked in from west coast= not fresh!! 

The halibut looked very delicious, but just wished the taste was just as nice.  

Clam chowder which was above average I would say, lots of clams, too salty though.

Herbal fries... tasted like ketchup to be honest.  

They give you corn bread and biscuits when you first sit down. the corn bread is to die for. it was perfection.

I dined there Saturday, July 28th. I opted for the Upstairs dining since the host said it's more intimate/romantic and that we can get both the Upstairs AND downstairs menu there.

I had reservations for 7pm & the hostess told us that there are 2 ppl ahead of us so we had the option of waiting at the lobby or the bar. 

My bf and I sat at the bar, with 2 other couples there. We asked the bartender for a drink menu. About 10 or so minutes later, she still has not given us the drink menu & she could probably tell we were looking at her bored, waiting. She then told us, ""Sorry, we only have ONE menu for the bar and the other couple is still looking at it."" By the time we got the menu and ready to order our drinks (a whole 15 minutes fiasco), the hostess told us our table was ready so we didnt end up with a frikken drink at the bar!!! STRIKE ONE!!!

We sat by the dining area, which reminded me of a cruise ship dining room. We had about 4 men assisting us so we didnt even know who was our official waiter.

Even though we had 4 ppl assisting, service was slow! By the time we got our appetitzer and drinks...it turned to 8pm already! We got the calamari, btw, which was actually delicious.

The man who actually took our order was not the waiters that introduced themselves, but whom we think is the manager, since he was wearing a black suit jacket and ordering staff around.

I asked for the Downstairs menu and they gave my bf and I a menu each. My BF noticed that the menu that  he has looked a little different from mine. One of the entrees had Arctic Char while the other one had Sockeye.

When the manager took our orders, he didnt seem fazed when my bf ordered the Arctic Char. I ordered the Cioppino. By the time our order had arrived, the staff placed our food on table and said to my bf , ""Here's your salmon"". My bf looked at his food and he said it wasnt Arctic Char. He brought it to the attention to the waiter (not manager).

The waiter then stated ""We no longer serve Arctic Char so they prepared the Sockeye for you instead, but had the same ingredients from the Arctic Char."" I could tell my bf was angry but he kept his cool. He told them this wasnt what he ordered so he asked for Halibut instead. Why didnt the manager tell us that they are no longer serving Arctic Char?? For someone running the place, I would think you would know your own menu!!! STRIKE TWO!!!

I dont understand why they would prepare something that's not available instead of asking the customer if they would prefer it instead!!! I was really upset that I had to eat the Cioppino all by myself...i tried to eat slow (getting cold), while we waited for my bf's halibut. STRIKE THREE!!!

I felt the service we had really ruined our date....eating food by myself...having the wrong menus....giving us food we didnt ask for.....long wait at the bar..

2916150,2009-09-05,1,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"As it was ""Restaurant Week"" in Las Vegas, RM Seafood offered a prix fixe for $30.09. The second course of this prix fixe was the signature ""RM Cioppino"" which normally runs around $33 by itself. We had the prix fixe. 

The host was professional and friendly. A bit too handsome though, I prefer my fine dining host to be an attractive-yet-seemingly-sexually-accessible female, or an eager-to-please eunuch.

The wait staff were all attentive and quick, hustling about without looking as though they were rushing. If I worked at this restaurant, they would have to hide my sweaty fumbling in a back refrigerator.

The ambiance was pleasant. The lighting was just dim enough for the candles to add a visual warmth. The sounds from the kitchen and surrounding conversations held at soothing levels.

The biscuits and cornbread were tasty.

We each ordered an appetizer. (three of us)

I got the Top Chef Masters Moondoggies. Basically a seafood corndog, but not basic at all!  Absolutely delicious. Since a series of superlatives won't do this deep-fried-wonder-on-a-stick justice, I will attempt a play-by-play of my mouth:

8:32pm
Waiter arrives with Moondoggies. Two ""moondoggies"", each roughly the size of a C-cell battery, accompanied by a small mound of slaw. I pick up a moondoggie.

Heat radiates from the dog as my teeth break though outer crust of cornmeal, which cracks in a manner similar to a deep-fried spring roll wrapper.

My teeth cleave through the steaming mantle of cornmeal and firm ""dog"" flesh, and the fried shell touches my tongue. Its surface feels glassy, as if made up of thousands of smooth, tiny pebbles.

I chew, as the umami-rich juice of the dog fills my mouth. Once solid flesh of the dog breaks into its components, a chunk of shrimp here, a scallion disk there, a bit of cilantro, a sliver of garlic.

I continue to chew, the savory dog mixes with the light sweetness of the cornmeal. Bits of the crispy cornmeal shell sporadically crackle.

I sip water

I lick a bit of the green cilantro mayonnaise squiggle they have squirted upon the dog. It's nice, but a little too mild to factor heavily in the flavor play. Maybe if I had a little bowl to dip the dog in?
8:33-5pm
More biting and chewing with similar results.
8:36pm
Moondoggie named lightweight champion of my mouth.

The other appetizers were a shrimp cocktail (very good, but nothing worth writing about) and a Beef Tartar (well spiced and tender, with great flavor, but again, not a champion.)

One friend ordered a glass of wine, so we all did. I can't tell you how ignorant I am about wine, so let me show you: The wine comes to the table. I take a sip, and I damn-near hear music it is so good. They must have stolen this stuff from God's own cellar, from the door with the lock on it.

I ask ""what is this?"".

My friend, who eats at fine dining establishments about as often as I eat at Arby's (about once a week, *sob*), says, ""I'm not sure, but it's a pinot noir"".

I think to myself, ""but this is a 'White' wine. 'Noir' means 'Black' in the French language."" Luckily, I didn't reveal how stupid I am by uttering any of that out loud. I just said, ""Really?"" and made a puzzled face.

So the wine was really good, and now I'm beginning to wonder why my two best friends put up with my ignorant ass.

On to the Prix Fixe:

1st Course
Iceberg BLT
Bacon, Sweet 100's, Buttermilk Ranch Dressing

Yuck! This was the worst part of the meal. A wedge of iceberg lettuce, two cherry tomatos, some bacon, and crumbled bleu cheese. I really think someone forgot the rest of the buttermilk dressing. I ate it all anyway. Fat bastard.

2nd Course
RM Cioppino

This is what a great recipe properly executed tastes like. Mussels, clams, prawns, seasonal fish, and calamarata pasta tied together by a light, mouthwateringly memorable, tomato broth/sauce. Mussels and clams popped lightly when bitten, the flesh tender when chewed. The pasta, cooked to bull's eye perfection, was a wonderful foil for the broth and it's tiny chunks of tomato. To be honest, the prawns were the slightest bit overcooked when compared to the mussels and clams (where was the pop and give? the tenderness?). The small cubes of seasonal fish, like the pasta, seemed to accentuate the savory broth rather than standing on its own. The dish was accompanied by two pieces of heavy-fat garlic bread. Yet another vehicle for that incredible broth. 

It's a substantial course. Imagine a globe the size of a basketball. Slice through this basketball/globe at the arctic circle, from the arctic circle up to the north pole is around the amount of deliciousness you get.

3rd Course
Blueberry Cobbler

Bellys full, our dining experience requirements soundly met, and fearing disappointment, we considered asking for the check and exiting at this most excellent moment.

I had the shrimp cocktails and the skirt stake for dinner.  I know I was at a seafood restaurant but I was in the mood for some red meat and the bartender said that it was very good.
Well they didn't disappoint as the food was great! The presentation on the shrimp cocktails was unique and appetizing.  Rather than hanging them from the lip of a glass, which is what everyone else does, they had individual elongated concave ice cubes for each piece of shrimp and a small glass dish for the cocktail sauce.  Very nice.
The skirt stake was sliced, perfectly cooked to the requested temperature on a nice bed of fresh mashed potatoes and drizzled with some nice gravy.  There were a few strands of watercress which provided a nice bouquet.  
The missing star is because I still left hungry as their portions were a little skimpy.  Nevertheless, the quality was great and I would definitely revisit or recommend to any friends or family.",dFlOhBfbR_mWCjcffSAgbA,1,0,4,_fXlRUWJxNY5rmXOtetXFA

A good thing about this restaurant is you can choose down dinner or up dinner, down dinner is casual, and inexpensive, up dinner is dressy and expensive.

We made a reservation a couple hours before our reservation, we stayed at THE hotel. Got there, downstairs was packed, host thought we were tourists who didn't speak English, she was very friendly to us, asked if we wanted to eat here with a hand pose showing ''eating'', that was so funny :) bf said we had a reservation upstairs, then she took us to our table.

we went  upstairs, the entire dining section  was so classic and beautiful. there weren't so many ppl, only a few tables ppl were having dinners, and they were older. We got a very cozy and comfy booth, more private too, perfect for our double dinner date evening. 

While waiting for our friends, I ordered dry vodka martini as usual. our server was so friendly, explained everything on the menu, even where the fish came from, or veggies, that was very interesting. He helped us to order the right things from the menu, I had salad and salmon as first and second course, they tasted fantastic. my bf had scallop and roasted duck , they were the same great. our friends had halibut and some other seafood as well, everybody was happy with our dinner. we shared a little bit of everything too, cause the portions were big. 

one of my favorite restaurants in Mandalay bay, up dinner is so nice, great food, great service, beautiful decor, quiet and cozy atmosphere,  it is pricey, but very well worth it. :)

2958022,2009-09-24,6,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Rick Moonen's RM Seafood does not get as much recognition as some of the high profile restaurants in Las Vegas, but in a way, I prefer it that way. Based upon past experiences, some of the more lauded and lionized establishments along The Strip have become too big for their britches, charging ridiculous prices for just very good food. Hell, if I have to drop $500 at one sitting in Vegas, then it better come with a happy ending!

On the night that we dined there, the upstairs dining was closed (damn this recession!), and although I was disappointed, I thought the downstairs dining room -- with its white leather booths and maple-stained tables and chairs -- had a casual elegance to it that was unpretentious yet visually appealing.

For dinner we ordered the large chilled shellfish sample, which was a multi-tiered steeple tower of seafood holiness and contained 1 whole lobster, 12 oysters, 6 clams, 6 shrimp, mussels, 1/2 Dungeness crab, and a seafood escabeche (calamari, mussels, shrimp, king crab, in a spicy vinaigrette). The entire spread was literally an altar for the senses, from the cornucopia of shapes and colors, to the briny freshness of the sea, to the sweetness of the shellfish meat. We washed down the entire thing (well, almost all of it) with a bottle of the 2007 Rivers-Marie Chardonnay ($25 corkage), which in taste and texture is a dead ringer for a white Burg. And while not cheap, our bill was a fraction of what we might have paid at some of the other high-roller restaurants in town.

But as good as the food was, the best part of our meal had to be when Chef Rick Moonen himself came by our table and shared some wine with us. As gregarious and hyperactive as he appears on television, this Top Chef Master completely won us over with his passion for life and generosity of spirit. The ballers can have their bling, but the next time we visit Las Vegas, we'll skip the exorbitance of the other places and instead feast like kings at RM Seafood.",cWVsDzn7L7dwL9c5tubwaQ,10,10,5,531eYBWjDiRFkwg802yNEw

We had appetizers: Crab cake was huge and had more crab than cake. Delicious. Fresh sashimi was average, but I've had fresher ones, what surprised me though was unagi sashimi -- seared on the skin side, raw on the inside. Interesting and also tasty. Bone in Rib-eye -- it met our standard. Nothing more to say. Surf and surf: this was the star of the night. I changed the shrimp into three deliciously pan-seared diver scallops with lobster approx 7oz on top of risotto. The risotto was well cooked, most amateurs make the mistake of having the risotto undercooked or too salty. Not this one.

The weak spot of this restaurant is the ""outdoor"" seating with a view of the escalators to the Mandalay shop, the emergency fire exits and the smoke-infested casino floor and all its noise in the background.

First, The Service...
Clifton our server was Fantastic!  I highly recommend sitting in his section.  He knows how to pace the meal and made several wonderful recommendations.  And all the folks helping him to attend to us were wonderful... they seemed to come and go like ninjas.  One moment you're enjoying a lovely conversation or bite of food and the next your wine glass or water glass is filled and you have no idea how it happened.

Second, The Food...
Freakin' Awesome!

*Oysters - I don't like Oysters so I didn't partake.  But the husband said they were really good.

*Appetizer - I ordered the Charred Octopus... this is my new favorite dish.  The octopus was PERFECT... not fishy, not oily, not slimy... meaty, tender and succulent.

*Salad - Papaya Salad, Thai style.  It was refreshing, with a bit of a ""bite"" to it.  Not like it was bad... it was like it opened up your tastebuds so you could enjoy all the flavors that you were enjoying and going to enjoy.

*Main courses: 
- Rick's Catch - so I don't remember the name... it wasn't anything we've had before or even heard of before.  It was a white fish. The texture was similar to halibut steak... so it was meaty but flakey. It definitely had a fish flavor but since we all like fish this was not a turn-off... I thought it balanced the flavors of the dish.  It wasn't overpowering is what I'm sayin'.  Served over roasted garlic and shaved asparagus.
- Sturgeon - this was done in a wonderful chipotle-like glaze.... not spicy at all... a hint of sweet... whatever, it was fantastic.
- Diver Scallops - compared to the 2 other fish dishes, this one was just your standard fare. However, this ""standard fare"" was perfectly executed.  Scallops were tender and juicy.  If you like Scallops... you'll like this dish.  I had mentioned in my prior post that I thought it was salty... I don't think that anymore.

*Side - Brocollini - big enough for 3 people to share.  It was done with olive oil, garlic and a touch of red pepper flakes.  It was cooked but still had some ""crunch"" to it ... just the way I like it.

*Dessert - we didn't order dessert.  But Clifton saw that we were having a special evening, and decided to bring us a small dessert to share.  It was Amazing.  It was a Key Lime Cheesecake Mousse bar and (I think) Chocolate Hazelnut Crème Brulee.  I wasn't paying attention to what he was saying because I was too busy eating it.  I wanted to lick the crème brulee dish... it was 'That Good'.  But I decided to keep my good manners in place for a change.

All In All... A Fabulous Meal!  
(Oh... and we ordered a lovely bottle of wine too with the help of Clifton.  I kept the cork in hopes of trying to find it at a retail location.)

While speaking with Clifton, who was able to take a couple moments from his busy section, he mentioned that Rick Moonen is often on site overseeing operations.  We did see Chef Rick at one point in the evening and as we were leaving we saw him again at the entrance and even got to speak to him for a minute.  What a Nice person.

The seafood is well-done here, and I appreciated that.

3034134,2010-06-20,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"One of the things I love most about Las Vegas is the culinary melting pot of restaurants. In one city you have the opportunity to choose any kind of cuisine you could imagine or dine in a restaurant by a chef whom you might otherwise have to travel to France, China, New York or San Francisco to experience. Where else on the planet can you experience every culinary god in one place? As a dedicated foodie, I am slowly crossing off my list a visit to every one of these restaurants.
Yet, I'm starting to become confused about these ""celebrity chef"" restaurants in Las Vegas. Out of my pretty hefty handful of experiences, more often than not I am left disappointed. 

After watching the entire season of Top Chef Masters, I was left with a good impression of Rick Moonen. I liked his attitude, his positive moods and his dedication. Even though I do not eat seafood, I really wanted to try this place out.

We strolled in around 8:15 on a Saturday night to a relatively empty house. We opted for the ""upstairs"" or ""fine dining"" menu. After a few cocktails mixed by a very friendly bartender we were seated.

First off the decor is stuck in 1997. The mix of denim blue and cherry wood with hints of yellow reminded me of every seafood restaurant I have even seen, including Red Lobster. The thick glass plates looked like something I would put candles in from Pier One. We were sat in a half booth and within minutes both were struck with backaches from the uncomfortable booth. I felt like I was in a chiropractors office! 

I felt the restaurant was striving to be super fine dining, but was missing out on some major points. For instance, our napkin was handed to us with tongs- fine dining. We sat for almost 10 minutes with no menus- fail. New silverware was brought with each dish even if the utensil wasn't used with the previous- fine dining. I told our waiter I don't eat seafood yet my amuse bouche had crab- fail. 

After looking over the menus we decided since we had just had lunch at 3:30, a 5 course tasting wasn't a wise choice so we ordered light.

The amuse bouche was 2 squares of watermelon topped with crab. Since I had to remove the crab, it was no longer a ""dish"", just 2 pieces of melon- whoop-tee-do? My boyfriend started with oysters. Within eating one he said ""wow!"" and told me they were delicious. I had the beef tartar and was very upset when it was dropped and realized it was covered in black truffles. I feel in a fine dining restaurant the menu should list the major ingredients in a dish, for example, ""Beef Tartare, unconventional garnishes, crisped potato skins, black truffles"" becuase since I hate black truffles I would know not to order this dish. But, all it said was ""Beef Tartare, unconventional garnishes"". So I ended up paying 21 bucks for an appetizer that I had to sit and pick at so I could eat it. Once I got all the truffles off, it was very bland. Although the beef itself was quality, I missed the traditional flavor one would expect from a tartare. 

Next my boyfriend had the salmon with orange carpaccio. After a few bites he stated, ""I am only finishing this becuase it was 40 bucks"". He said it was undercooked and bland. Drizzled on the plate was a green sauce, he tried it alone and made a terrible face. I tried it too and I swear it was made from lawn clippings. At one point he held up a large chunk of orange on his fork and said, ""how is this a carpaccio?"", it was a orange supreme at best.

I had the onion soup 2000 next which after a few bites I simply stated that it was ""disgusting"". The soup was 2 layers- the bottom a Gruyere custard topped with a onion broth and caramelized onion chips. The broth was poured on by our waiter and I was instructed to eat it in layers- which proved to be very difficult. The broth was so under-seasoned and the only flavor it got was from the caramelized onion chips. Once I ""finished that layer"" I dove into the custard. It literally tasted like they made a custard and forgot the Gruyere cheese. It had the consistency of chicken fat and was so flavorless, I took one spoonful and pushed it away. When our waiter picked it up he even asked if I liked it and I told him ""only the top layer"" yet he did nothing about it. I payed for a 16 dollar bowl of sludge that I ate 4 bites of. 

We had considered ordering the pork belly and a dessert, but after how the previous dishes went, we wanted to get the hell out of there. We payed 120 dollars for 3 appetizers and one entree and bolted. I had wanted to see the kitchen but I didn't have the strength to sit and lie to any of the kitchen staff and tell them it was a wonderful meal.

Having made reservations the night before, we sat down at 7:45, greeted by some friendly and somewhat intimidating workers. Our server for the night was a little aggressive in asking us what we wanted to order, inadvertently pressuring us and hurrying us. 2 of my friends ordered the diver scallops, one friend ordered the halibut, the clam chowder, and I ordered the Cioppino. 

Each table came standard with some parmesan crisps and cornbread. The cornbread was very tasty, but upon asking for a second helping, our server basically gave us the stink-eye of 'don't even think about asking again'.

Each order of the diver scallops came with 4 plump scallops, a piece of chicharron and pureed eggplant. The scallops were cooked perfectly, but it was hard to fill up on 4 scallops. The halibut was served with chorizo, some corn, and some leafy veggies. Like the scallops, the halibut was cooked perfectly. The clam chowder surely had a lot of clams and tasted like a solid chowder should.

I think I ordered the winner of the night. The cioppino was a wonderful medley of prawns, squid, mussels, clams and fish in a tasty tomato base, served with two pieces of garlic breadsticks. It was the most plentiful in terms of volume and variety in taste. 

For dessert, the 4 of us shared a cheesecake. The cheesecake took a while and we were wondering why. Why it took so long? They served it in the form of a ball of cheesecake dipped in a white chocolate shell. 

Being that 3 of the 4 of us were celebrating our birthdays [3 bdays within 8 days of each other], we thought we'd get a perk or so.. no such luck.

3.5 stars: Our server was hard to locate at times and the, although he was nice, but was also kind of pushy and rude attitude, was quite the turn-off. The dinner ended up being $210 - we left satisfied with the flavor and taste of the food, but we were left wanting more. Was it everything we wished for? Quality-wise, yes, but not in volume/quantity. I'm glad I went, but I'm pretty sure that's the last time I'm there.",yYEIePWZlDWuHWxUlir_oQ,4,1,3,JBs2xQ4tD8gxMdr-OxaL8w
3062610,2011-07-07,1,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Back in May, my husband and I attended the Las Vegas Uncork'd event.  We were staying at Mandalay Bay and on a free Saturday evening we decided to have dinner on site.  We were torn between Border Grill and RM Seafood and decided in the end, to go for Rick Moonen's RM Seafood.

Let me start by saying that this weekend was full of extraordinary food, and in some ways we were a little ""fooded out"".  We were scheduled to eat at Joel Robuchon on Monday evening and the choice of RM was almost arbitrary.  We had to eat, this was nearby.

We did opt to eat at the fine dining restaurant upstairs as opposed to the  casual eatery on the main level that serves a la carte.

We had a 7:30PM reservation on a Saturday night.  We were seated promptly in a dining room that had only 3 occupied tables.  After about 5 minutes, our server offered to move us further back in the dining room as one of the occupied tables had about 10 diners and was very loud.  We accepted.

RM was a complete surprise.  We ordered the chef's tasting menu and were completely blown away.  The food was awesome, much much better than I expected.  Honestly, outside of The French Laundry, I would say that this is the best meal I've ever had, and I've had some really good meals.

We ordered the 7-course tasting menu.  I had the standard menu and my husband had the upgraded version for an additional $95.  In the end, I thought that $95 was a little high for what he got, but the food was so good that I really didn't care.

Our meal started with a marinated Spanish baby octopus that was just unreal.  This dish is in my list of 5 top dishes ever.  The octopus was tender and succulent, lightly seared and delectable.  It was accompanied by fava beans and Iberico ham and was completely delicious.

I won't go through ever dish we had, but would like to point out some high notes.  The potato blintzes that came with the Smoked Sturgeon were fantastic.  Delicate pillows of fluffly potato encased in a soft blintz.  Outstanding.  The pork confit that accompanied the delicious Lantern Scallops was unbelievable.  It was tender and juicy and very ""porky"".  Some of the best pork ever.  My husband got a foie gras dish as part of his upgraded menu and it was incredible.  Truly the best fois gras we've ever had.  It was perfectly cooked, creamy with just a hint of ""tooth"":,  This foie was better than what we got at The French Laundry, and that's saying something.  Lastly, I had a lamb belly dish that was spectacular.  I've never even heard of lamb belly and it's just what you might think it is.  It is very reminiscent of pork belly but from lamb.  It is slightly chewy with a wonderful fatty lamb flavor.  It was awesome.

Service was terrific and very friendly.  Of course, throughout our meal there were no more than 3 tables of diners at any time.  I was a little disconcerted considering it was a Saturday night and the crowd was so light.  I truly hope this place does well, considering the quality of the food.  Frankly, I'm not sure why this place isn't Michelin rated.

At the end of our evening we were offered a tour of the kitchen and truly got a tour.  Chef de Cuisine, Matthew, took us through each station, introduced us to staff and their particular jobs and answered questions.  He also indulged us with a photograph.  

I have eated at some of the best restaurants in the country, including The French Laundry, Joel Robuchon, Charlie Trotters and Rick Tramonto's former home - Tru.  RM Seafood is easily in this category with it's fresh, flavorful and creative dishes, and for a pricetag that won't drain your wallet.  Given a choice of going back to Robuchon or eating at RM again, I'd pick RM, no question.",lLNsPbBNZyBcT10_s5zacw,2,1,4,JpX2BIi9G0Wsi7RgxA2xOg

3072534,2013-03-19,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,RM Seafood is so overrated. I was really disappointed with the food. It is the equivalent of an average seafood restaurant back in the Boston area.

We got off to a dreaded start where it took almost half an hour to get our wine out.   The only good thing RM did well was ship out some of the best Mattaki (BC), Potters Moon (RI), and Blupoint (NY) oysters.   This would have been perfect if you brought the wine before we could enjoy these oysters.  We continued to sit for a good 15 minutes before they could locate the bottle of Bordeaux.

The clam chowder was pretty flat.  I honestly enjoyed the clam chowder from the M Resort buffet.  You'd expect much more from a world class Top Chef master, right?

Next, we had the diver scallops with black bean sauce.  The scallops were nothing special and lacked seasoning.  All of the food came out rushed since they did not time the delivery with the delayed wine.  

Last, our waiter even knew he did a shitty job.  He comp'ed us 2 coffees and 2 additional glasses of wine, but honestly they could have done more since everything they did was wrong.  

If you're going to experience fine dining on the strip, do not go here.  I take some responsibility for bypassing the 3-3.5 star rating I saw.  I was just hoping these Yelp reviewers were harsh but they were overly generous with their ratings.

Personally, their home made fish roe butter that they use upstairs is my favorite. They even brought us the butter for us from the upstairs when I was wondering if I could buy them. Of course, their seafood is excellent. Great combination of quality seafood and original preperation. I really enjoyed the scallop with pork belly that I had last time. I added foie gras on top of it and it was delicious.

There was so much food, I couldn't finish it at all, but I did have to eat all of the seafood. You can't let it go to waste! The cioppino was the best that I've had (aside from the one that I make), and my mom who is a picky eater, actually finished her surf & surf without wanting to trade her dish with mine halfway through the meal.

The char - closest to salmon, was ok, my husband described it as being good but not something he'd go out of his way for. My sashimi was a fish that was similar to yellowtail...it was ok. Didn't have that sweet taste I was looking for that good yellowtail have. The wringo roll was gross, I didn't finish it. The tsuekimono was ok but nothing blew me away about it. The only thing I enjoyed the whole night was the dessert! We ordered the 16 sorbet tasting game - where you guess the sorbet flavors completely blind! I got 10 out of 16 correct - can you do better?! The manager told us most people get 8 or less right! Overall, the food is ok and not worth the price.

The chilled plateau of seafood was SO GOOD that I wish I could have eaten the whole thing myself. I happen to suffer from food envy, but luckily the person seated next to me did also, so we went halfsies on our entrees. I gave him half of my lobster dish and he gave me half of his fish dish.

There was a buffalo shrimp entree that they had here a few months back, but they took it off the menu. My fiance was crushed. This was one of the few places where they made a good buffalo shrimp. 

I personally like the sushi even though it is ever priced. I like the tempura roll. One roll honestly gets me full. I couldn't even finish the last piece of it.

On terms of service, we have had good service there, but the last visit, there was only one waiter for the bar area. I guess they weren't expecting so many people so I'll be understanding for that.

it's been a while since our dinner here so i don't remember the course by course breakdown but i do remember some specific dishes.  she had a fuji apple salad that was nice, light and refreshing.  she also had a pasta dish and a free-range chicken dish.  each dish was large for a tasting menu but if you're hungry then it's to your advantage.  the pasta dish was good from what we remember, unfortunately we don't remember the exact contents.  the chicken dish had good flavor but was a bit dry.  i remember having the clam chowder, the diver scallop and the halibut.  the soup was spot on in texture and flavor.  the scallop was perfect and the accompanying crispy noodles added nice texture.  the halibut was tasty but a bit overcooked.

i remember that we had a lot of desserts too.  we got a tasting of fresh sorbets, the stand out being the pear.  i also got the fat elvis which was a banana/peanut butter spring rolls.  this was nice and decadent at the same time.

The food was good, but when the bill arrived it showed $70 EACH for the 'small' orders of the special, and $140 each for the regular. Not only were we pissed at being lied to, but the food was not anywhere near worth that much. The server protested and we asked to speak to a manager. The manager took quite a while to come over and then said he was sorry that 'you misunderstood' the server.

So my hubby brought us here after a kettle 1 event that he attended. It was a weekday & it seemed very slow. We were seated in the ""patio"" area which is funny because it is still indoors since it is inside the casino.

We were promptly greeted by our server & he walked us through the menu since it was our first time dining. 

We started with a CLAM CHOWDER which had clams in every bite. 
Then we has the charred poached OCTOPUS legs. 
Next came a CAESER salad which had a little spice to it which I assume is because they make their dressing in house which I LOVED because it cuts back on the typical thick dressing.

Then we ate the most delicious & garlicy garlic butter bread ever. And we were also served complimentary corn bread with butter. I am very guilty of eating 4 of them. The server was very surprised w/ how many I ate.

For main course i had the SURF & TURF & the lobster literally just melts... period. The filet was just as delicious in flavor & tenderness. As for my man he had the SURF & SURF  which came w/ the most AMAZING risotto!!!

Finally dessert we had the ice cream sampler & dessert sampler which I can't remember the names but they were all good!!!

I'd absolutely go well out of my way for those moon doggies and pork belly maki again. The moon doggies are not your typical corn dogs. Its very light with a crispy exterior and basically melts in your mouth. 

The ice cream tasting is really fun. They come out with 16 small portions of ice cream and if you guess all 16 right, the dessert is free!

We dined upstairs and started in the lounge with some champagne and oysters.  The GM, Paul, was very friendly and chatted us up right away.  He came back to check on us a bit more as we enjoyed our nibbles.  While I have no doubt that he is a friendly, nice guy, I'm sure another reason he spent so much time with us was the lack of customers elsewhere in the restaurant (for the most part, anyway).  

The oysters were incredibly fresh and tasty, as expected.  They aren't cheap, for sure.  At 3.75/an oyster, I've never paid more, not at Daniel Boulud and not even at Providence!  The champagne was also a bit pricey at 25 bucks a glass, but prosecco would not have worked.  The lounge is comfortable, but overlooks the throngs of people roaming about Mandalay Bay.  It's a bit jarring to be in such a fine dining atmosphere but to watch the antithesis just outside a window.

We adjourn to our table to begin the tasting menu.  Service was great!  Three different servers worked with us, answered our questions, and maintained the same friendly atmosphere we experienced in the lounge.  I went with the tasting (75) and the wine pairing (55); Jim G. went with the tasting and a drink.  The food:

Grilled Octopus: Sadly, too rubbery and lacking in flavor.  I think I've learned that if I'm not at Osteria Mozza, I'm not ordering octopus.
Steak and Potatoes: Prime Beef Tartare, cornichons, potatoes, and other yummies I can't remember.  The menu says ""untraditional garnish.""  Surprisingly good!  So simple, but well put together and great quality.
Green Eggs and Ham: Andraki Farm Egg, Jamon Serrano, and Asparagus three ways; super yummy!  Interesting flavors and great combinations.  Cute presentation.
Hot and Cold Foie Gras a la Japonne ($15 supplement): Best dish of the night!  On one side of the plate, there was a lush piece of foie gras, seared perfectly, served on top of crispy sushi rice. Heaven.  On the other side, a cold mousse of foie gras nestling underneath a beautiful piece of uni (sea urchin).  Ridiculous. So good. Can I have two?  Actually, it's too rich to eat two, but still.  There was also a palate-cleansing shot type thing that came with it; totally gross!  
We had the Walu and the Alaskan Salmon.  They were ok nothing special, sadly.
We then had the China Pig and Rabbit Trio ($15 supplement).  Also ok; well prepared, but nothing amazing.  The morel risotto that came with the rabbit was very nice though.
For dessert, we had the Irish Car Bomb (Guinness Ice Cream, Bailey's Ice Cream, Beer Suds, and chocolate pop rocks) and the Frozen Strawberry Shortcake Bar (""Nitro Dots,"" marinated strawberries, and spearmint).  The car bomb was good, but more interesting as an idea than as a dessert.  The Strawberry Shortcake Bar was super good!  It tasted like the Good Humor bars many of us had as kids.  I did find it odd that a fine dining establishment was trying to replicate a 75 cent bar we bought from the ice cream man as kids!  It was good though =)

We ended with an interesting tea presentation.  There was a carafe with what looked lime lemongrass on our table.  Water and dry ice was added for a cool effect (literally and figuratively).  The cold tea was tasty and refreshing, particularly after such a filling meal!

Again, great service and innovative cuisine.  However, the tastes didn't quite match up with the ambitions or the prices.  I respect Chef Moonen for only using sustainable fish and for being creative with food, but, for the same price I can have much better food.

It's surprising, but a lot of restaurants close at 10PM in Las Vegas, even though it's a city that basically operates 24 hours a day.  So we were afraid our options would be limited or ridiculously expensive.  

Enter RM Seafood.  It's right inside the Mandalay Place mall with two floors of dining - a regular dining room downstairs, and a chic lounge upstairs.  We sat upstairs, and the decor was eclectic but pretty.  They offer a sushi menu as well as a more traditional seafood menu.  Extensive wine list, lots of cocktails.  The waitstaff was friendly and helpful, even though they'd just had a mad rush of people before a Justin Timberlake concert.  They said they were still trying to clean up and recover, but we didn't really notice any flaws in the service.

I ordered from the sushi menu.  The edamame was flavored not just with salt, but also with lemon and a bit of hot pepper.  Very tasty!  I got a lovely albacore nigiri that melted in my mouth, and then two special signature nigiri orders.  There was arctic char with crispy shiitake, acacio honey, and fresh wasabi, which was slightly sweet but well-balanced and delicate in flavor.  And the ""ceviche-style"" scallop with citrus and avocado?  AMAZING.  I love raw scallops in my sushi, but this was just perfect.  Best I've ever had.  I was thrilled to have three buttery-soft, delicious scallops to savor.  I almost ordered a second round.

My dinnermate ordered the tea-smoked arctic char from the more traditional menu, and it was also delicious.  It had a nice, subtle smokiness and was served on a bed of cucumber, red onion, and a sauce that was reminiscent of tartar sauce.  The bread basket served with this contained tiny, perfect buttermilk biscuits.  I snuck a few bites of each!

We spent $60 for both of us without any drinks - which isn't outrageous for dinner in Vegas, especially when it included sushi.  It was a lovely, relaxed experience, and I'd be happy to return and savor some more scallops.",40pYoBJA9rcoXPZqWGyyfg,2,0,4,w-Wmw6pZOVxFydaAIVhbWw

The Cobia, a mildly flaky light fish was delicious with the flavorful lobster quinoa. The deep fried California roll with spicy Arctic Char (raw) on top was worth it since the roll had real king crab, not krab meat made of pollack fish with crab color painted on top. And the Arctic Char was tasty like salmon but lighter in density.

Imagine that, Chef Rick Moonen, of Top Chef Masters, was actually in the same building that I was in, walking on the same floor that I was walking on, and breathing the same air that I was breathing. I was thrilled! 

This year we returned to Las Vegas and made it a goal to eat at RM Seafood. Dinner was out of the question and upstairs was equally out of the question since we were traveling with our children. So downstairs and lunch was our plan. 

The good experience started on the phone with Tabitha... who assured us that she would take care of us when we arrived. And she did: great table on the patio. I don't recall the waitress' name but she was sweet and attentive. 

Choosing from the menu was a challenge since everything sounded good. The specials sounded good too. One was almost unbelievable: lobster and hamburger burger - the ultimate in lunchtime surf-and-turf! 

We decided on the red hake, lobster rolls, and the kids both wanted the BBQ pork mac-n-cheese (without jalapeno). All arrived in reasonable time and looked fantastic. We actually sat there ""eating with our eyes"" for a few moments... the plating was that pretty. And the eating was even better! 

Everything was perfectly cooked, exceptionally seasoned, and flavorful beyond belief. Barely a speck was left on the plates when we were finished. My youngest son couldn't finish all of the mac-n-cheese but we were more than willing to help him.

We saw online that they had a pre-theater menu so we picked RM Seafood with that in mind, but the link was out dated and they do not have a pre-theater menu.  Our mistake to trust a 3rd party link.

We ordered the following at our table - 

1.  3 x $15 Clam Chowders - 2/5 - Clams were hiding.  Not as tasty as I remember but a lot of bacon flavor.
2.  $19 Seared Foie Appetizer - 4/5 - Very well done.
3.  $24 Crab Cake - Not much crab or seafood flavor.  On the dry side.
4.  $19 Steamed Clams - 3/5 - Cleaned nicely, no grit.  Broth not much flavor.
5.  $54 Filet Mignon - 3/5 - Requested medium.  Cooked a little over medium so was a little dry
6.  $84 Surf & Surf with Add 4 Scallops - 4/5 - Seafood was perfectly cooked but the truffle oil flavor started to be overpowering after several bites
7.  $10 Roasted Mushroom - 4/5 - Cannot really go with just mushrooms
8.  $5 Side of Garlic Cheese Bread Sticks - Dry, not very garlicky, not worth $5

We smiled and both chose soup and were greeted at the night's end with a charge of two bowls of soup. Wonderful.  

Upon receiving the bill, I asked the waiter, who we will call 'Trey', why we were charged for the soups. He said, that he asked Soup or Salad for our benefit, because it's his job as the server to make it easier for us to decide. Hmm...since when did this place begin employing used car salesmen?

Surf and Turf (there was a special that night) - Lobster, Shrimp, AND Scallops over Truffle Mushroom Risotto - OMG!!!

Seated on the ""patio"" we thought we were in for a fairly breezy and casual dining experience. The service certainly supported that, as the server really didn't know enough about the dishes to adequately explain, and upsold us on things he was told to upsell. This is fine when the prices are low-country cheap, but not so much in Vegas. 

So we took the recommendation for the tower of seafood appetizer. HOLY F**K. This was a monster! Literally 3 feet high, loaded with chilled lobster(S), King Crab (a whole one), 2 dozen oysters, and mussels/clams and a pathetically under portioned (but tasty) slaw. Thing is, it was described to us as a ""small taste of a bunch of things."" No Frakkin' way! It was MEGA. 

We then proceed to order a couple bottles of wine for the table. Again, where was a competent professional when u needed one? For the ridiculous upcharge for a bottle of A-to-Z Willamette Pinot ($17.99 at Trader Joes, $108 here) you'd think there'd be a sommelier in the house... nope. Being out of A-to-Z they brought a different pinot that wasn't even in the same class. Oregon my arse!

Then there was the glut of our market-price dinners. All good, but poorly explained! If you're going to recommend specials, know the details! My crab/lobster was swimming in butter, but woefully light on orzo and non of the mentioned greens were extant. Must've been someone else's special. 

Overall, I thought the food was pretty alright - being fairly unlmolested and simple. Nothing spectacular though aside from the copious amounts of shellfish. 

Service was pretty laughable, consistent but just so far off the mark. 

Then there was the price. 15 bills for 7 people. DAYUM. I could easily do a fantastic meal at Chicago's finest restaurants for that much. $200 per person gets you a great night at Alinea, Blackbird, Topolo Bampo, Schwaa, GIRL AND THE GOAT.

No beating around the bush.  The eats were fantastic!  The oysters and octopus with falafel got our appetites going, and I'm really glad I ordered the walu entree.  Not knowing what to expect out of my fish dinner, I loved every bite of it!  The fish had the texture of a cross between tofu, flan, and fresh mozz cheese curd.  P.S. That description is supposed to get you excited, not weird you out.  It came accompanied with mini mushroom egg rolls.  Divine!

Don't skip out on dessert.  The strawberry short cake and irish car bomb offerings were a hit and ingenious creations.

Though it's supposedly their lower end restaurant, the ambiance and food still felt very high-end to me. Our waiter, Robbie, was amazing and knowledgeable about the multitude of fresh seafood that they provided.

We started our meal with the sampler oysters. They had 6 different types of oysters from the west and east coast. I've had a lot of oysters in my day, but never have tasted some of the ones that they provided. There are some unique ones that taste like mud or salty & lemony. I would recommend this for oyster lovers.

For our entrées, I had the surf & turf: 9 oz. filet mignon w/ half a lobster; while, my boyfriend had their seafood cioppino.  My steak was very tender and the red wine sauce was just enough to bring out the sweetness of the steak. I wish they had a little more sauce for something different for the lobster, which was just plain boiled dipped w/ butter. I would definitely recommend the cippino over the steak + lobster if you are looking to try a variety of seafood. He ordered extra giant scallops with the cioppino, which was to-die-for! The extra charges for the scallops were reasonable too [3 for $12]. Overall, the meal was quite delightful and true to their words, the seafood was extremely fresh.

You must try the Seafood Escabeche! It may look small but it packs a punch with the fresh taste and spices!! The California roll was spot on as well!

 I came with a friend who suggested this place. I found the menu to be somewhat limited and quite pricey. The clams appetizer was probably one of the best dishes I have ever had. The flavor was outstanding. The clams were cooked perfectly. I wanted to have some pasta with the left over broth, it was so good. I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was very fresh and quite a nice size portion. I was very disappointed the dont have malt vinegar with fish and chips. My friends dish was very disappointing. It was the tomato salad with some weird runny mozzarella cheese, anchovies, and a smear of some fig brown sauce. For $18, it was probably the worst salad I've ever seen. The service was ok. We ordered 1 bottle of water and although we had more than half full glasses, the waiter proceeded to open another bottle! I felt that was very presumptuous.

The energy in the restaurant was quite low for a weekend night and I was surprised that it never got really busy at any point. I guess the recession is really hurting them bad, especially in the upstairs restaurant. 

We started our evening upstairs in the lounge area with some oysters and champagne. The oysters were great but over priced at $3.75 each. 

We moved to our table and both tried the tasting menu which was probably under priced at $75/pp. They had a nice selection of supplemental dishes at $15/each. Most of the dishes were good, not great. HOWEVER, there was one dish you must try and may be worth a trip on its own...Hot and Cold Foie Gras a la Japonne! Of course it was a supplement, but it was so worth it. One side of the dish was foie gras served on top of crispy rice. The other side had a mousse foie gras with uni (sea urchin). We almost fought for each bite of this one! My wife is lucky I'm a gentleman once in a while. : ) 

Other standouts were the ""Steak and Potatoes"" and the ""Green Eggs and Ham."" Unfortunately they don't even garner much attention after the foie gras dish.

We went there for Thanksgiving dinner and had a great time. The restaurant was casual and not too intimidating, the waiters were all very friendly (flirty might be a better word), and the food was sustainable, simple, and delicious. 

We started off with the Butternut Squash Soup with lobster, pumpkin seeds, and pumpkin oil and Rick's White Claim Chowder. The butternut squash soup was to die for, the lobster was so fresh and the pumpkin oil went very well with the soup without making it too heavy. The claim chowder was good but it was a little salty for both of us. 

For the entrée, we ordered the Brioch Crusted Baked White Fish and the Wild Cobia & Niman Ranch Pork Belly. The wild Cobia was buttery and flavorful with the pork belly though I think I've had better pork belly. The white fish was very light and delicate. It was very fresh and well seasoned. 

Finally, we got to finish everything off with the orange creamsicle with homemade tangerine sorbet, panna cotta jelly at the bottom, and slices of tangerine toped with drizzles of vanilla bean oil. The dessert was quite creative and very refreshing. I would love to have it again.

The fifth star is undoubtedly for the dessert we ordered, key lime pie. I haven't had many key lime pies in my life, but this was undoubtedly the best one I have ever hard. Of particular excellence was the crust, which was extremely rich and buttery. The custard and marangue on top were also perfect.

I went with three friends. So we were a ""four top"" in restaurant lingo. I was staying at the Mandalay Bay Hotel during a trade show and many restaurants were not available. I made a 7:45pm reservation and asked the concierge at the hotel for directions. The directions led me to the tram station which had no restaurant in sight. I was hoping for a Harry Potter moment where a door would mystically appear but it didn't. It took a phone call to the restaurant to get actual proper directions. 

The Dinner:
I am writing this three days later so I don't have a perfect memory of the dinner but I still have a craving for part of one main course dish. But I will start at the beginning. The restaurant is big...as Las Vegas hotel restaurants tend to be. 
(BTW:  I detest the shortened term ""Vegas"" as well as ""Frisco"" for San Francisco. They are too crass for my refined taste.)

I am not going into detail on what you should order as we didn't have many different ""plates"". 
Calamari and something else that was non memorable to start. Three of the four of us ordered the same entree...one person was vegan and ordered a salad and some non descriptive sides. I do remember a good looking plate of asparagus. 

The entree that got the most attention was a seafood melange featuring scallops, shrimp, lobster and crab.  But it was plated on a bed of the most luscious, delicious and scrumptious mushroom risotto. Throw away everything else I ate that night (or even on my whole trip to Las Vegas) and just feed me the risotto...breakfast, lunch and dinner. Wonderful types of mushrooms in that properly moist, creamy and heavenly rice...that's it, ""Cut and Print"" as they say in Hollywood. It's over, no need for anything else. Enough said. You get it. 

BTW: my appetizer was the matzo ball soup. My mother wouldn't serve that to her worst enemy. Horrible. Also, we opted for a plate of assorted mini deserts...nothing memorable. 

No alcohol as we were all tired and just drank iced tea. 

Everything was pretty mediocre...but not a bad night as we all felt seeing old friends and getting together overtook the food. 

$550 with tax and tip. Jeeze...what if we drank.

I am still drooling thinking about the mushroom risotto. It was the highlight of my ""Vegas"" trip.",TfGPWYVWP3mehsFUlUPqYg,1,0,3,4_NRI4O_vWHk_DzLcrLCZg

Our bartender was Jeff and he was fantastic.  Energetic, funny and quite knowledgeable on oysters and craft cocktails.  I would give him a 5-star review based on his expertise and demeanor.  He really made it a fun experience.  

My wife and I both had two drinks apiece.  I went with a Vallagarina  white and then a Mer Soleil Chardonnay which were both consistent and good.  My wife had a Tattinger champagne and a Bonny Doon Rose which she gave a thumbs up since you can never go wrong with Tattinger according to her.  

After looking over the menu, my wife started with the Oyster Sampler which she said was good in terms of consistency and flavor.  We also went with the Smoked Fish Dip which was average and came with about half of the needed Lavosh for dipping.  The dish was just a bit too busy with all the elements going on inside the mixture.  It detracted from the fish in our opinion.

The Can To Table appetizer was below average and far too salty in my opinion.  It felt like we were eating a salt rock.  It also fell apart when you tried to bite into it.  In general, it felt and tasted like a cheap dish.

We opted for two sushi rolls:  The Double Down and the Rainbow Roll.  The Double Down Roll was good but nothing special and the Rainbow Roll was fine.  I would give them a 5 on a scale of 1-10.  There was nothing that we could say was bad but also nothing that would spur us to order them again.  Sushi is hard in Vegas because there are some excellent options.

The sum it up, it was a pretty mediocre dining experience and when your bill is $200+, you expect more from the food in terms of quality and presentation.  Jeff was the highlight of the experience in both of our opinions.",ruqe3slVDfXdXVMPtM976g,0,0,3,zAH1RFFAJwtn96DA3fhoCg

Upon arriving we were seated in the bar, without being asked if this was okay. If I'm paying $200 for a meal I would like to sit in the dining room, even if I have to wait. The hostess was very rude and pointed to our table and walked away. Our server approached after about 5 minutes and gave us menus and explained the specials. When we were ready to order my husband asked about the cioppino dish (a San Fran classic), the waiter really didn't explain it at all- but instead recited what was listed on the menu- we can read, we were asking about the flavors, broth, etc. As for the selection-- it is a seafood restaurant and if you don't want the sushi selections, the cooked seafood is very limited!

The bread basket arrived with a buttermilk bisquit, a piece of cornbread, and whipped butter. The cornbread was great and made me excited to try the rest of this dinner. We ordered 6 oysters to start and the tuna duo, the oysters were wonderful (although we usually get these because the kitchen's can never mess up raw oysters). The tuna duo was very small, 2 teaspoons of chopped tuna and 7 or 8 small (about the size of a quarter) slices of tuna. Very, very bland and dry, maybe it was old tuna. 

There were no salt and pepper shakers on our table, this bothers me at every restaurant because everyones tastes are different. We asked for more bread and they said ""absolutely"".. guess what the bread never came and our water glasses were empty nearly the entire night. 

The entrees arrived the lobster bolognese for myself and cioppino for my husband... SUPRISE the cioppino has pasta in it and my bolognese has no visible lobster and is soaked in Pernod (black liquorice flavor)... now NO where on the menu did it state pasta or Pernod and when we asked our server this was not mentioned either.  The cioppino had little broth (not at all what it's supposed to be) and was SO spicy and I love hot food. Cioppino's should have a spicy tomato based broth, but not so much spice that you can't taste the shellfish... also that tomato based broth- I'm almost 100% positive was out of a can--- V8 anyone? Now what would happen if someone was gluten free and ordered the cioppino-- write it on the menu!!!! Oh, and the frozen texas toast style breadstick was the icing on the cake (the kind you get at Olive Garden-- seriously.) Grilled sourdough? No. The side of orzo my husband ordered was covered in cumin-- less spices and more salt would have been good.

Onto the lobster bolognese, I will say the pasta was perfectly al dente, but with the noodles soaking in the Pernod and was desprite for seasoning, you could not tell if there was any lobster in the dish-- again write the predominate flavors on the menu. 

Our waiter kept asking, ""Are you perfect?"" I'm not one to send back food so we just politely smile... but don't ask me if I'm perfect... waiter's who can not use correct verbage, (ie ""How are you enjoying everything this evening?"") drive me crazy.

During one of or many Vegas experiences by BF and I started to veer towards spending more on food rather than on drinks at the club. We were sent there by Cheese Monger at Morrell's. Our first experience was outstanding. While I am a food lover, we were joined by friends for the Chef's tasting menu at RM Upstairs, not cheap, but oh so delicious and unforgettable. We were a young group (maybe 10 years younger than the other diners in the Upstairs room) but we were still treated well and respectfully. Rick came to the table and greeted us, and we felt very special :). My BF and I returned to RM Upstairs the following year for the Chef's tasting menu and saw Rick again, and he was able to come to say hi again. 
This year we went to the Sushi bar...we were having a late lunch during off hours and much to our disappointment they had run out of some of the specials and they made the wrong roll for me. I know it was off hours, but service was a little lacking for such a nice place. It seems lunch is not the best time to go here based on reviews from other yelpers. However, they did make up for it, and they did get the roll right and I got one for free. 
My thoughts about RM have not been forever tarnished and I cannot wait to go back to Vegas to try the downstairs restaurant for dinner! Sadly we probably won't be returning there for lunch again.

My first visit was back in the winter of 2009, but on my recent spring trip to the area, I knew that I just had to return.  The service here is completely fabulous; the waitstaff is knowledge, helpful, and very friendly.  

The restaurant is located in a quiet corner on the outskirts of the Mandalay Bay shopping area, so even though the facade opens into this section of the hotel, diners can enjoy their meal with little disturbance.  Separate menus are offered for upstairs and downstairs dining experiences, and sushi options are also available.  The ground level provides a la carte dining, while prix fixe meals are offered on the second floor.  The restaurant boasts a wide array of creative cocktails and top-notch wines.  

Your meal will begin with some delicious rolls and flaky cornbread.  These baked goods are just a teaser preparing you for the fabulous meal to come.  In terms of sushi, standouts include the Futo-Fireball Roll - a hefty blend of King crab, avocado, cucumber, and a topping of spicy Artic char and tobiko.  Dollops of sweet kabayaki and tangy wasabi citrus aioli surround the elegantly cut maki and act as prime dipping sauces.  Similarly intriguing is the Ebi-Go Roll, which includes crisp shrimp tempura, jalapeno, avocado, and cilantro.  Slices of fresh tuna are draped across each piece, while jalapeno sauce, kabayaki, and lime add a tart kick.  If you prefer to stick with more traditional entrees, the natural Pacific Halibut floats in a bowl of thin broth seasoned with black garlic and chorizo and infused with flavor from the incorporated cockles and swiss chard.  The side dishes are beyond decadent.  The Mac N' Cheese is as creamy as warmed butter and served in a cast-iron skillet with a crunchy breadcrumb topping.  Chef Moonen's Signature Mashed Potatoes are infused with hefty seasonings like capers, scallions, black pepper, and red onion.  Lastly, enticing desserts like the Chocolate Dome with its warm, gooey center, provide the perfect end to a flavor-packed meal.

They have a 2 level/2 concept approach to the restaurant.  The upper floor is the fine dining, tasting menu concept, which I definitely want to try.  The lower floor, is the less fancy, order a la carte menu, which when we went had a great vibe in it.  The space, like most newer restaurants in Vegas is fantastic.

I'll put a disclaimer here, actually I need to put 2.  

1.  I'm not reviewing by price.  I'm amused by some of the other reviewers balking at the price.  All restaurants in this caliber in Vegas are absurdly overpriced.  So if you are coming here to say that, about ANY restaurant, you might as well also remind people that there are Casinos in Vegas.  In fact you should probably give them a negative review on Yelp as well, because you likely lost money in them.

2.  My ENTIRE table was sold on the special after the waitress gave the hard sell, which was a surf & turf.  So it's tough to really review the fish, which is his specialty.

The meal itself was fantastic.  The filet was cooked to absolute perfection.  It had a 1/2 pound of lobster on top in an unbelievable sauce.  I wanted to rub the sauce on my face it was so good.  It was really delicious.

I'll definitely be back to try his tasting menu upstairs, which is more focused on fish.  I did also try a scallop crudo app which was fantastic as well.  The service was great, our server rocked.",rWLI-KeG6u1Y7zLIEGWJlA,1,1,4,vzdzHrGzkMZ1dJU-4Don9g

First, let me give props to the wait staff because they are very attentive and accommodating. (It was freezing in there, so we asked if they could close the sliding door. They couldn't close it all the way, but we appreciated the fact that they appeased our request by closing it half way - which helped. Damn hotel A/C, ha!)

We start off our meal by ordering a dozen fresh oysters. As good as they were, we we're surprised to see how much they were once we got our bill.  $45/dozen - I think not!  That was a bit much! For that price, they should've given us 2 dozen!  Almost cost as much as my filet mignon!

With that said, my dish was fabulous! Very simple - the filet over whipped potatoes - cooked to perfection (medium-rare)! We didn't have much conversation over our meal because I was too busy enjoying every bite of that meat.

4019685,2010-02-08,3,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"I honestly can't remember the last time I had worse experience at a restaurant.  I have been known to forgive bad service when the food makes up for it, but on this occassion that wasn't the case.  The food was not the worst part of our dinner at RM but it didn't do much to overcome the offensively awful service. 

To begin with, it was not clear when I made the reservation whether or not the upstairs (more upscale) part of the restaurant was open.  I gathered from the website that it was not and we took our seats downstairs when we were seated.  Our waiter told us once we were seated that it was open and suggested that we come back while we were in Las Vegas to eat up there.  Well, I will never be returning to RM in my life and I would never take a suggestion from that waiter.  

Which brings me to my next point....

Our waiter, Daniel, was a complete imbicile.  It was almost as if he was in an entirely different place than us, because he was so oblivious to what was going on at our table.  To begin with, service was very slow.  It did take us a while to decide on our dinner, but that didn't mean that we wanted to wait to be served our dinner once we ordered.  Nor did it mean that we wanted to sit there with our empty appetizer and salad plates in front of us for the duration of our wait for our entrees either.  The wine took an equally long time to arrive.  

Daniel was absent for much of the meal unless he was trying to upsell us on something and we often had to ask the food runners or other servers for extra plates and for bread.  We were never offered bread and I noticed that other people had these wax paper-lined baskets on their tables and I had to assume that bread was offered at this establishment and ask for it myself.  That, to me, is a major transgression.  I'm glad we did, not only because our wait for our entrees was so long, but because the little biscuits in those baskets were really delicious.  

When our meal did arrive, my surf and turf was all wrong.  The turf was very rare and when I flagged Daniel over to tell him, he wanted to take the entire plate away and I suggested that I could still eat my surf rather than have it sit under a heating lamp while the kitchen refired my filet.  So Daniel brings me a bread plate to flop my entire half of a 2 pound lobster onto.  When we flagged down another server to get me a bigger plate, he looked at the lobster hanging off of my plate and seemed embarrassed.  When I did get to dig into my lobster, it tasted like it had, in fact, been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.

I told Daniel to forget the steak because we had a show to catch that we were nearly late for at this point.  A few minutes later a young girl, who was possibly a manager or maybe a mime came to the table with my steak and whispered some sort of apology, but no one at our table could even hear what she said because she was so soft-spoken and timid.  They brought me my steak anyway, because they clearly sitll wanted to charge me $40 for it.  All in all, I ended up with an improperly cooked, $80 meal, that I had to eat as quickly as possible.

When I got my steak, most of our table was done with their meals.  Apparently the cobia and the scallops were good, but there was so much going on at the table and we were so rushed that it didn't seem to matter.  I had to try to scarf down my filet, which is not my preferred manner of eating in order to get out of that horrible restaurant and make it to our show.  As I was downing my steak and my fellow patrons were staring at their empty plates, Daniel came by and asked  ""So far so good?""  What?  What planet was this guy on and to whom was he speaking because clearly this was not the appropriate thing for him to say.  Nor was it appropriate that he walked away from our table empty handed after we requested our check.  

Before we dashed out to catch a cab, my sister-in-law and I visited the filthy ladies room while the guys paid the bill.  They split the bill on their credit cards and Daniel, true to form, brought only one pen for both of them to find a spot on the cluttered table and fill in their overly generous ten percent tip.",DasBrVN3uDvUCXNumrkc7Q,3,1,1,6teK8ZUEkbkH6iEI2yHotA

The food was excellent.I don't care about the whole sustainable fish thing. I mean, I believe in being a good steward of the land and sea  but I'm not really thinking about that when I go out to eat. But the food was outrageously fresh and clean tasting. 

The Manhattan was and down the greatest Manhattan I've ever had. If you want to just stick your pinky toe in the waters to check this place out and catch the vibe I would start with a Manhattan drink - wow. 

I think the carpaccio could've used in an egg over the top of it but that's just being petty on my part. 

Manager Ibo was welcoming. The waiter was knowledgeable and the service was quite excellent. The waiter was informative and talkative without ever being intrusive. He wasn't there to be our buddy he was there to serve. What a relief.

Chef Moonen is a superstar whose star is just continuing to rise and rise. He's a good guy and I always want to see the good guys win. 

The consistency of the clam chowder was some of the best I've ever experienced. The consistency was fresh and creamy without being gritty or clumpy. The clam chowder also featured bacon and carrots to such an extent that it was simply sublime perfection in a bowl. Highly recommended.

Service was great, the waiter REALLY knew the menu and was so patient with our questions and really took the time to explain each dish. 

We started off with the edamame, and for a price of over $5, we had a good amount! I'm usually skeptical of places with expensive edamame because they usually give you a dinky amount. 

I got the Cioppino (spelling is made-up) pasta which is a red-sauce based pasta with all kinds of seafood (hence the title of the restaurant... RM Seafood.) The mussels/clams were DELICIOUS I wish I had more, and the amount of pasta was overwhelming, I could barely finish it and had a LOT of help with the boyfriend. 

My boyfriend got some kind of fish, I wish I remember the name of it, because it was so good. The fish was soft and flaky and just slid off the fork into your mouth. Only problem was that it wasn't that big of a dish, so my boyfriend was still pretty hungry even after he cleaned his plate. Fortunately my pasta dish was ginormous!

My only other issue was the water. They asked what we wanted to drink and we said, ""Water."" ""Okay, do you want unstilled water, perrier, or (insert fancy water names)?"" ""Uhh.... just water?"" I guess we got the unstilled water... for $5!!! Good thing we drank all of that water and then some. I thought water was supposed to be free...

I had the Raven's wood (zinfandel) and started with Ahi Poke which I absolutely  loved. The Daikon, Seaweed and a type of pepper (Which i can't place) complemented the tuna with very bright notes. HIGHLY RECOMMEND  it. 

I was pleasently surprised when my entree arrived which was filet medallions, seared scallops, grilled asparagus with a truffle potato gratin and a Meyer lemon foam. 
The scallops was the most delicious I've ever eaten ever... only realizing that I never had scallops cooked to perfection before. Medium is medium and Thank you RICK for acknowledging it.  The Medallions was also cooked beautifully and it was very succulent and deliciously clean with well developed flavours. Average food is filling, Good food speaks to you and Great food moves you.  RM was definitely an experience.

4325532,2012-07-10,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  I took my BF here for his birthday dinner.  We wanted a very formal dining experience, so we had made a reservation at RM Upstairs.  We arrived about 10 minutes early for our 8pm reservation and was seated immediately, and we were greeted timely by a waiter who took our drink orders.  After waiting a while for our drinks, we were ready to place our dinner order, which we did.

We wanted to start with the Seafood tower and the baby octopus.  We were asked if we would like to have these items together or separately, so we told them we would like them together....only to be told that they come from separate kitchens, so they may not arrive together....so what was the point of asking if we want them together?  

We ordered our entrees - I ordered the Scallops and he ordered the Arctic Char - he was really excited about ordering this dish.  He had scoped out the menu before we got to Vegas and he knew what he was ordering before we sat down for our dinner.

Our Seafood Tower arrived and everything was fresh and delicious.  Then we sat and sat and sat and waited for our octopus dish to arrive.  Then we sat some more....when finally our tiny little octopus dish arrived.  We devoured the dish since it was so tiny, but i t was definitely tasty.

Then we waited......and waited.....and waited.  We actually saw a guy sitting in a booth by himself having the 7 course pre-fix, and he was literally falling asleep and nodding off in between courses...I guess we weren't the only ones WAITING!!  We also totally felt ignored by this point and the place wasn't even busy!!

About 2 hours after we were seated, the waiter brought us our entrees.  My scallops looked great, then I looked at my BF's dish.....salmon???  He told the waiter that he did not order salmon, and the waiter's response was....we don't have Arctic Char tonight and we're substituting it with salmon....WTF???  My BF was trying to keep his cool and told the waiter that he was not told of this substitution.  The waiter told him to please wait and he'll talk to the manager.  About 5 minutes later, he arrived and told my BF that he can choose something else from the menu and he'll have the chef prepare it right away.  In the meantime, I also returned my scallops because I was not going to eat them by myself.  I asked the waiter nicely to please serve our entrees together.

Another 15-20 minutes passed, and the waiter finally brought out our entrees.  By this time, with no apology from the manager or anything, we were fuming!  Our whole dining experience was ruined and we honestly didn't feel like eating anymore.  My scallops were not fresh anymore...I think they had it sitting under the heating lamp all this time while they worked on my BF's new dish, and just re-served it to me.  It was not hot and kinda gummy by the time I got it the second time around.

We told the waiter that we just want our check and leave.  Then the manager shows up and asks us what's the problem.  We told him the whole story of the long waiting, not getting our appetizers together, wrong entree (or not being informed of the change in the menu), slow service, etc. etc. etc.....and told him we were really disappointed in our meal and our special occasion was pretty much ruined, so we would like our check and leave.  Then he asked how can he make it up to us....don't you think that's a tad bit late for asking that?  He said he would take care of us and asked us to order dessert but we just simply refused.  It was almost 10:30pm and we wanted to get out of there.  Then he sends another waiter with some petit fours with ""happy birthday"" written in chocolate sauce and some tea service and that waiter told us there will not be a bill and just walked away.

We felt really uncomfortable and uneasy about not having to pay for at least the appetizers that we consumed, but once that last waiter walked away, no one came back to our table.  No waitstaff, including the manager even looked our way after that.  So we left what we would have originally left as a tip for our $200+ dinner on the table and left feeling very uncomfortable.  We just wanted a nice dinner out and we weren't trying to get over on anyone by not paying.....we go out to wonderful restaurants all the time for the food and experience, and this was the first time ever that we left what was supposed to be great restaurant by a fantastic chef feeling so very disappointed by the overall experience.  

We actually had another reservation at RM Seafood Downstairs for the following Sunday, but we called and cancelled our reservation.....there was no way we were going back there again.",WkG9phTuWbhAC0z4354mrg,15,3,1,oIrt6xCP6xHBy9iFP_wydA

There was a rush of customers since it was before a Justin Timberlake concert, which is why we were there. We ended up leaving without getting our main dishes b/c of the rush, but it was fine since we had a couple appetizers and they weren't small. It also didn't phase us since the staff were so nice.....we just understood that it was out of their control. However,  the manager that night, Robert, found out and truly made it up to us. Talk about excellent customer service. I didn't think it existed anymore, but Robert proved me wrong.

I came to Vegas for my best friend and my birthday.  We wanted to go to a nice restaurant and ultimately selected RM Seafood.

First, 3 out of 4 of us are Top Chef fans and were excited to meet Rick Moonen and chat with him.  He's a very nice man and we talked about the food.  He spent a lot of time on the floor...only thing about that that concerns me is that I know he's a celebrity chef and all, but I hope he had a hand in the food that night.

Two of us did the prix fixe and two of us didn't.  We ate:

Appetizers:
-California roll with real crab (mine)
-Steak tartare with fries
-Ahi Tuna two ways

My california roll was better than a typical california roll (with fake crab), but none the less it was a ...california roll. The steak tartare looked excellent and I was told that and the tuna both were.

Main course:
-Lemon-butter scallops and shrimp with capers
-Halibut with basil sauce
-Cioppino (mine)

All three were delicious!  The halibut was the best...love the clean flavors...the green.  Scallops were seared to perfection.  The cioppino was the weakest of a very strong pool.

Dessert:
-16 flavor ice cream challenge
-Key lime pie

We were so full by the time we got to dessert, but hey, how many more times am I going to come?  We had to do the ice cream challenge! We got about 10 correct.  According to the waiter, the average correct is 8.  This was more about the experience as some of the ice cream flavors were truly disgusting.  haha.  We had a great time though.

The waiter also brought out a little candle with the ice cream for our birthdays! (They didn't sing, which I wouldn't expect or want in a joint like this so it was just right. :) )

I'm not usually a key lime pie fan, but this one was probably the best key lime pie I've ever had.  

The bill wasn't as unreasonable as some of the other restaurants in Vegas (we also didn't drink though).

All in all, it was a great experience and perfect low-key moment to a crazed Vegas trip.  I would recommend this restaurant to a seafood loving fan looking for a good, not-outrageously priced but still nice meal for their Las Vegas trip.",ot3m-jIwFMFFCMG1bkLZgQ,0,0,4,yiqrUAqIX1kQ4X-6eoPpmw
4382159,2015-08-12,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"This was a hard place to rate because I have mixed feelings about my experience. We made a reservation for 6:00 on a Friday night and I'm glad that I did because the restaurant and bar were already packed. The bar was the most crowded area which makes me think they must have good Happy Hour specials. I liked the decor and vibe of the dining room. It had an upscale feel, but not in a stuffy way. 

The outstanding part of the evening was the service. The whole team was very attentive. Our waiter was always available, he timed our courses well so that we were never waiting long, and our water glasses were always full. 

The mixed feelings part is in regards to the food. The good was the bread basket, clam chowder, and my sushi roll. The bad was the skirt steak. The meh was Moroccan spiced salmon, strawberry shortcake, and key lime pie.

So, the bread basket came out and the two options were delicious. It included a moist, buttery piece of cornbread and a salty, cheesy roll type of bread. I was excited at this point because I love a good bread basket. Next up was the clam chowder which was top notch. It was smoky, rich, and had plenty of clam. My sushi roll was the best part of the whole dinner. The fish tasted very fresh and all of the flavors worked so well together. I definitely wanted more sushi, but we had already ordered meals.

I had the Moroccan spiced salmon and my husband had the skirt steak. This was a change of pace because I have the steak obsession in our house. My salmon was well prepared, but the flavors on the plate weren't great or abundant. It was definitely lacking something. I tried my husband's steak ( more like half of it) because he was trying to push it off on me to avoid wasting food. I seriously hate to have to say this about an entree at any nice restaurant, but the steak was terrible. It was tough and had zero flavor. It didn't seem like they even salted it. I was really surprised that an established restaurant would serve this. 

The desserts were okay, but not great. We had the key lime pie with cilantro syrup and a strawberry shortcake. Both desserts were creative version of the traditional desserts which I can appreciate. The key lime pie was good and I thought the cilantro was a tasty twist on the usual. My husband thought the cilantro syrup was an assault on his typical key lime pie and was not impressed. The strawberry shortcake was delicious. It was more of a shortcake biscuit in a strawberry soup. I loved the flavor, but it came with a fork which made it hard to enjoy the soup part. 

I wouldn't come here again for dinner, but I do want to come back for sushi. The sushi and the service were good enough to bring me back for a second try.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,1,1,3,_nNiCmD27Jg_cPf58ylVrg

I know that my reviews will far differ from my friends Alan W and Lan N who I enjoyed this restaurant with (I am calling you out!), but I enjoyed my food much more than they did.  Also, I did return and had an even more amazing dish than the first time I went.  On with the review...

So I went to RM for the first time because a friend of mine demanded that we try the catfish sloppy joe (courtesy of his fiancée who watched an episode of oprah).  I strayed away from the catfish sloppy joe (even though I did try it and it was pretty good) and ordered the fish tacos because I am a fish taco fiend.  So the appetizers came out, and we all shared a round of calamari (which was freaking good) and I had a the pork belly miso (which is way good; sorry vegan and vegetarians but you are missing out!).  After the apps came the main food, and the fish tacos I ordered were AMAZING!  Crispy taco shell combined with soft tortilla, fish, seafood, guacamole sauce, salsa and heaven in a meal..... it was ridiculously good.

On my second visit, I had the opportunity to try the corn chowder and Adam's Fish Sandwich.  The fish sandwich.... honestly I could not imagine a better fried fish sandwich.  The fish was super fresh and lightly breaded.  The bun was warm and buttery.  The tartar sauce complemented every component and combined all the flavors in a heavenly symphony.  HOLY crap.

I had an email confirmation for reservations to the Rx Boiler Room.  This was a client dinner, I was hosting a total of 10 people.
I called about a week prior to my visit to increase the party of 8 to 10.  Also, when I arrived to Las Vegas, I checked in with the concierge desk and a lady called, and again, confirmed my reservation for 10 people at the RX Boiler Room on Tues Jan 12 at 6:30 pm.

When I arrived at 6:20 that evening, I was in shock when I saw a sign saying ""closed for a private party"".  I spoke with the manager and while he was apologetic, did not seem sincere. He blamed the 3rd party online system for the error instead of accepting this was a huge mistake, causing me great embarrassment in front of my customers.
He said my reservations were not here, but rather downstairs at RM Seafood.  Forgive me, my clients and I live in Boston, MA where we have the finest and freshest seafood in the country.  I would not fly to the desert to have seafood.  

Having no other choice (as all restaurants were booked for the evening), we were escorted downstairs.  The manager there took care of us at first.  But after our order was taken, it was hard to find a server or manager. Our service was slow.  The food was mediocre at best.  We were half way through our dinner before the wine came (and we ordered it as soon as we sat down).  We waited about 20 min after we finished to find a server to bring us a dessert menu.  He advised that the kitchen was backed up and it would be 20-30 min if we ordered dessert.  This was unacceptable after already having waited 20 minutes.  The bill came to nearly $1700, of which the manager took care of the wine - approx. $200.  And this was not something he offered, I had to ask for it.  While we finished up our wine, the server brought us 2 key lime desserts to share (conveniently while I was signing the check).

In hindsight, I should have asked for more, as our experience was just short of awful.  I am in the sales and service industry.  When my company messes up, we take care of our clients.  I believe that people can make mistakes, but it is how you correct them that shows true integrity and commitment to your customers.

The decor is cool and modern.  The service is solid.  It is quite expensive for what you get.  Part of that is because you are in Las Vegas, but at those price points I expect more.

For my meal I ordered the Cedar River Filet Mignon.  The filet comes with a red wine jus.  The filet was solid.  It was prepared as ordered.  The problem is I was expecting a $54 filet, and got a $35-$40 filet.  I had hoped for better flavor and texture.  It was by no means bad, it just did not live up to expectations.

For a side I chose the Old Bay Fries with remoulade.  The fries were ok.  The remoulade had good flavor.  Once again, for the price you want and expect more.

Overall this is a solid place.  My review will not help most as I did not eat any of the seafood options.  You will get a good meal here, but for the price you can get a much better meal in Las Vegas.",3wB-JjsUjkvdNUDRnChsVg,5,2,3,HNun0trl8jbIPvrJ58qvUA

Three different sizes of plates stack on each other with different seafood on each level.  1FL was oyster, and mussels; 2FL crab legs, calamari and shrimp; 3FL was 2 lobsters.

From a grumpy server to bland food (except the chowder, which was FANTASTIC... I would go back and just order that) we were very disappointed. With a plethora of other fabulous foodie choices in LV, this just didn't stand up.

We came here after going to my Dad's Trustee Convention and Checking out the Shark Reef in the Mandalay Bay. After Spending a little over 15 Minutes looking for this place (We got lost in the Casino and Passed it Twice) we managed to find it. It was amazing to walk into the place, it was the location for Top Chef: Season 6 Restaurant Wars. 

We sat down and after looking over the menu for a Couple of Minutes I noticed Rick Moonen (himself, my First Professional Chef Encounter) a couple of Tables away having dinner, he walked over said hello and we talked for a bit, I asked him for a Picture and he kindly said yes (but I said wait til after our Meal). 

We started with an Amuse-Bouche: Salmon Belly with Salmon Roe and Bean Sprouts on a slice of Daikon (Good Start). For our Entrees: my dad got the Seared Diver Scallops with Roasted Cauliflower, Toasted Almonds and Drunken Raisins (Scallops were Beautifully Seared, there sweet when Seared or Roasted, you get Crunch from the Almonds, Nuttiness from the Cauliflower, also my Dad and I were curious about what alcohol they use for their raisins but it was good). 

For my Entrée I got the Grilled Sturgeon over Potato Gnocchi with California Caviar and finished in a Lemon-Dill Butter Sauce (Perfect Grill Marks on the fish and its just falls apart with these Fluffy little pillows of Potato goodness on the Bottom, saltiness from the Caviar and some acidity from the Sauce).We also shared a Side of Sautéed Seasonal Mushrooms (Mighty Big Portion of Assorted Mushrooms cooked in Red Wine Sauce). 

Then Rick came back over and we took our picture (before he had to go to Baltimore for something). Finally to end the Meal dad ordered some Tea while I got myself Dessert (I was originally gonna order and looking forward to the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Blueberry Compote and Blueberry Buttermilk Ice Cream a dessert with my favorite fruit. but they said they took it off the Menu 3 Weeks Prior to my Visit, So I went with Plan B). 

So what I ordered was Rick's Classic Summer Pudding: Angel Food Cake, Harry's Berries and topped with Sweetened Whipped Cream (It was fun to Eat, kinda like a Treasure Chest you take the top off the Cake and what you find are a bunch of delectable Berries, This moist cake filled with Sweet Berries and Whipped Cream light and fluffy as a cloud).

From our server Candice, to the bussers and other staff, everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  They would step to the side if you were walking and ask to take your plate away.

Their crab cakes are awesome!  I usually don't like crab cakes because they taste fishy, but these were just pan fried on the outside so they were crispy but oh so delicious.  Also their chicken entree was great.  Crispy on the skin and juicy on the inside.

Candice had the bartender make a special martini for me because I didn't like the one I had ordered, and without hesitation, she took it away.  Can't remember what was in it, but the bartender even came over to our table to make sure I liked it.  It had vodka, St. Germaine liqueur, and some other ingredients, but it tasted like a sweet and tart lemonade...with booze!

Also had a sushi roll ($24), can't remember the name but had shrimp tempura, poached shrimp and Avacado in it. Was good but still way overpriced.

All the restaurants are together and so there are plenty of options but seafood was our pick.

Everyone was friendly, the motif was subdued but clean and contemporary and the owner turned out to be none other than Rick Moonen, Top Chef Masters contestan on Bravo this season who came by our table and was very friendly, even letting us peruse his Seafood cookbook.  Our waiter suggested some great drinks, a nonalcoholic fruity concoction for my pregnant wife and a ""Gardener"" Martini created by the bartender with Rosemary infused Henderick's Gin and Basil garnish.  The Calamari starter was fried but absolutely fresh and a sitting atop a wonderful sharp chili sauce bed.

We went for a nice meal on a Monday, and were promptly seated.
Started off with a few drinks, an oyster sampler, and of course foie gras!
The oysters were nice and fresh, but the foie gras definitely took the spotlight.
Hard to believe, but not all places sear this little liver correctly, some being served to the point of being little more than mush...yuck....this one was done right!

We went on to order our meals, I had the skirt steak and my dining partner partook in the surf and turf special!
Again, we were not disappointed. I was actually pretty impressed with how well prepared my skirt steak was. The Korean marinade was spot on, not bland in the least and it had a nice little kick to it. Her surf and turf was presented beautifully, and tasted as good as she looked......oops, I mean as it looked (hehheh)

We did save room for dessert, so rather than bothering to choose, we went with the sampler, which was a hit and miss.....
we definitely enjoyed the key lime pie and PB&J, but not so much the nutella brulee nor the pineapple cake

I am glad to see this restaurant has lasted over the years, maybe the only thing needed would be a fresh remodel, as it is beginning to look a bit dated. other than that, I think this one will remain on our favorite list for years to come.

When we walked over to the restaurant after walking through the casino I was surprised by the sad, pathetic entrance, with strange ""outdoor"" seating - outdoor in the sense that it is outside the interior of the restaurant. This is not where you want to sit - feels like you are in a very dated mall, it's next to an exit and escalator.  The hostess tried to seat us there, even she knew it wasn't good and quickly accommodated us inside when we asked for different seating.  The interior itself is ok but belies the level and quality of food that is served.  It's very monochromatic and neutral, clean and open but so boring and uninspired.

The food delivered though.  Great oysters and crab salad to start, followed up by super cioppino and some sushi rolls that my husband greatly enjoyed.  everything was extremely fresh and of the quality you would expect.  The only thing that was a little disappointing was the key lime pie dessert - portion size was way too big and overall taste and texture were underwhelming.

The chef came out and was talking to diners, and chatted with us for a few minutes; was nice to see that he would take the time to do that.

The waiter said that he's never seen anyone guess all 18 correctly.  He also said they change the flavors every month, but the hostess had told us they change it every day.

Very disappointed - mostly because expectations were so high.  I got the arctic char, which was swimming in creme fraiche.  It was prepared well enough, but was neither good nor bad.  I ate it, and it fueled me adequately for the rest of the night.  But did I enjoy it?  Not really, and the meal cost over $100 a head when all was said and done.

The atmosphere? Definitely changed since the last time I've been there. Very tasteful and classy. Not a family-friendly restaurant, as there were mostly couples here. I ordered the jellyfish-wakame salad, the RM garlic tuna, the red king crab, and the sockeye salmon. My friends ordered clam chowder, the RM style cioppino, and the roasted shrimp.

And of course, who could forget the sorbet challenge?

Since we ordered so much, I'll just review the dishes one by one:

Jellyfish-Wakame Salad
It's very average. I could buy the wakame part of the salad for $2-3 at a local Korean market. Nonetheless, the jellyfish was very tasty and perfectly crunchy. Then again, I have an obvious weak spot for jellyfish...

RM Garlic Tuna
I thought this would be spectacular, since I was paying so much for it. It was okay, to be honest. It was tasty, but it didn't have any wow factor.

Red King Crab
So fresh and so good! Maybe not worth the price, but my favorite sushi fo the night.

Sockeye Salmon
Not the kind of salmon I expected to come out. It's red, and it doesn't taste much like salmon. This was probably my fault... take my advice and just don't get this either 

Clam Chowder
Above average, although it was a bit salty. I liked the variety of ingredients used in this chowder... tasty!

RM style Cioppino
They give you a TON of food for this dish. A nicely spicy and tasty dish, not to mention an abundance of seafood. My favorite entree of the night.

Roasted Shrimp
What an absolute RIP-OFF. Six shrimp for $36?! Not to mention, they came out under-cooked?! Horrible, horrible, horrible. Do NOT get this dish at all costs.

What made this dining experience a bit better was the 16-flavor sorbet challenge. It takes some time for it to come out, but it was SO worth it and definitely fun. Balsamic? Pine Nut? Who knew these flavors even existed!

Overall, this place is tremendously expensive. Personally, if I ever go back here again, I wouldn't order any food -- I'd go straight to the sorbet challenge.The service was alright... our waiter was nice, but sometimes he was a bit scatter-brained.

The atmosphere seems nice when you enter but we were sat in this room just off the side of the kitchen and I felt like I was in a banquet hall.  All of the ambience was lost in that room. 

First, the server (who was very tacky overall) asked us if we wanted still or bubbly water.  I asked for still because I know (as a former server) that when a server asks you if you want bubbly water they are trying to up sell you to bottled water.  Well, in this case, even the still water was an up sell.   He should have said 'Do you peasants want still, bubbly or tap water?'  I should have known better, I suppose. We paid $5 a person for water.  Let the nickel and diming begin.

Before we placed our orders, we asked for some recommendations on the side dishes.  The server naturally recommended the most expensive side dishes.  I ordered the gratin cauliflower and it was inedible.  The cauliflower was close to raw and the sauce was just poor.

We also had two appetizers.  A crab cake, which was tasty but I got a crab shell in one of my bites.  Like everyone else, I watch Top Chef masters and they would have sent someone home for that mistake. 

For my main course, I ordered a half-order of the special that night, shelled crab and lobster over risotto.  It was $75 for the half-order, $140 for the full order.  It was nothing special. Seriously, I've had better crab at lower-end seafood places. The lobster claw, though big was a mealy texture similar to tofu.  I couldn't even eat it, and this is supposed to be the freshest / best seafood available. 

The server said he used to be a sommelier so I asked him to pair a glass of wine with my dinner.  He naturally recommended the most expensive glass of wine and I accepted his recommendation.  On its own it was not a very good glass of wine but I waited to see how it paired with my food because I know a good pairing can change the flavor of both the food and the wine. It didn't.  When the server inquired how the pairing was, I told him I didn't really like it.  He then asked me why.  So I explained the wine was watery and did not elevate the food. He then spent 5 minutes explaining that he paired me with an 'old world wine' and I must have a new world palette.  So, basically, it was my fault I didn't like it.  

We also got the mashed potatoes as a side dish and the pea soup starter.  The pea soup was just so so.  The mashed were a highlight and tasted great but the presentation looked like something you would get at Applebee's.  A bowl of mashed potatoes with chives, chopped red onions and capers just plopped on top.  

My husband had scallops and a chili relleno in a mole sauce.  He enjoyed his relleno and the scallops were cooked perfectly but the mole was not very good. 

Two other people at my party had surf & turf and they enjoyed their food. But, admittedly, had never been to a restaurant of this (supposed) caliber before. 

The other two people in our party were also underwhelmed (there were 6 of us total).  My sister is  a vegetarian and asked for a veggie sushi roll and the server  had to grapple with this idea and then decided that the sushi chef could most likely accommodate this request.  I don't know how you mess up a veggie roll, but they did.  She did, however, order a side of sautéed spinach which she said was the best she ever had. 

The server barely checked on us.  The guy refilling our $5 water was far more attentive.

The check naturally included 18% gratuity.  No problem there, but normally I would give at least 25% if the food and service had been excellent. Because the server nickeled and dimed us, he got nothing extra.

I think and hope Rick Moonen would be terribly embarassed by the food and service we received that night.",TX11uH_M7u73xtQ2CsFhQw,5,0,1,vc1MgQB5nO4gJOSXhe8tjQ

My boyfriend and I made reservation for RM Seafood when we were in vegas back in March 2014. We both were so excited to come here. When we arrived, we were seated immediately since we had reservations. The place is fantastic for a nice romantic evening. The atmosphere very intimate. Our server came soon after we were seated and let me just say, I have never met a server who knew the menu as well as ours did. We learned from conversing with him that he had been there for 8 years which would make sense as to how he knew the menu so well. 

 My boyfriend started his meal by eating a lentil soup and I had nice and refreshing cucumber salad with a nice cranberry vodka. I ended up getting the special which was a halibut dish and my boyfriend order a seafood gumbo. My meal was very small! I was kinda amazed that something could cost so much but it was AMAZING! I cannot say I had a better cooked fish dish than this one. Luckily I had a large lunch earlier in the day or I would have still be hungry after the meal. 

We ended the night with splitting dessert which was a strawberry shortcake with ice cream dish topped with a strawberry syrup. I wish I could buy a jar of the syrup it was so good.

4581318,2012-11-30,1,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"On a recent food-themed vacation, RM Seafood was one of my most anticipated stops, having been a long-term fan of Rick's and his avid stance on using sustainable seafood. 

We had a few expensive meals looming on the horizon and decided to stop in for lunch instead of dinner. Luckily,. the lunch menu did not disappoint. My starter bowl of miso soup had enough umami to complement a steak and set me up perfectly for the main portion of the meal: a New England-style lobster roll. The bread was soft and had enough flavor to stand on its own, but still worked well with the lobster filling, enhancing the delicate seafood taste rather than masking it. My boyfriend had the soft shell crab po'boy and wasn't as impressed, but I can only base my review off my personal experience. 

The interior is spacious, yet cozy. Since we went during the day, there were empty tables available without a wait. Our server was extremely professional and friendly. We ate in the lower level, since the (higher-class/fancier) upstairs was not open for lunch. Still, even though the lower floor is considered casual, it still lent itself well to a classy dining experience, with a perfect level of lighting, comfortable and spacious seating, and wood-paneling that whispered of the below-deck area of a yacht.

The truly amazing portion of the meal came at the end, when my boyfriend and I asked to do Rick's Ice Cream Tasting Challenge. For $20, participants receive 16 different types of gelato, ice cream, and sorbet, each with a very distinct flavor profile. On a piece of paper, participants in the challenge write down what flavor they believe each one to be. If all 16 are guessed properly, the dessert is free. But beware, these aren't your standard ""chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry"" flavors. My boyfriend and I did fairly well comparatively (or so our server said), guessing 10/16 correctly. Ones we got wrong included Roasted Fennel and Spicy Watermelon. All the flavors were surprisingly pleasant to eat; I had anticipated a few less-than-appetizing ones due to the nature of the challenge. It was fun and interactive, and I would highly recommend asking to partake in the challenge to any prospective diners.",YT7jIsqbGjJxdCONWHxSbA,1,1,5,zF1xBAD3vn5Vrzs0CsQSvQ

with spicy tuna, sriracha, togarashi sauce. The sushi was amazingly fresh and each had a nice piece of blue crab at the bottom. yummm!

Eating at the bar, alone, mid-week, I received just the right amount of attention. In short, the service was very good. And the meal arrived in reasonable time. (Keep in mind, I was catching a show.)

To start, I had the Big Eye Tuna sashimi. The portion and presentation was very good. More importantly, the fish tasted very clean and fresh.

As my entrée, I had the Pan Seared New Bedford Sea Scallops. It was served with broccoli rabe, Japanese squash puree, crispy bacon and mustard caviar. For presentation, the squash puree was spread on top of a white plate. The scallops were placed atop the puree. Each individual scallop was encircled by Asian broccoli and was capped by the mustard caviar. The scallops had a very nice sear to each side. Each tasted very fresh. The vegetable seems to have been more for presentation--but it was nice to have a little bit of vegetable with the entrée. It was also good that the mustard caviar accentuated, but did not overpower, the subtle taste of the scallops.

My bill for the sushi, entrée, some beers and tip was $88.00. Some might think otherwise, but when I consider the location, service, food content and presentation, I feel that the price was not unreasonable.

The bottom line was that it was a really good meal.",psU9IaROPzivxgO2jDcmJg,0,0,4,d9WWyAXTqjyRxQ4QoTKGLA

We had brought a Groupon ($46) for two entrees and a carafe of wine, so I figured it was the perfect opportunity to gave this place a try. The bill still came out to be around $80 total (including the Groupon) at the end, which we still felt was overpriced compared to what we were served.

We had the crab cakes for an appetizer, and like many places, the pitfall is that there was so little crabmeat compared to the stuffing (breadcrumbs, etc.). I'm guessing it's  done in many places to stretch the number of crab cakes a restaurant can make, but it takes away so much from the dish. It was just dry and would break apart easily.  Although the flavor was good, the pasta in my cioppino was severely overcooked, and the BF had the halibut which was cooked nicely but kind of bland.

With all the competing restaurants from famous chefs on the Strip, I'd try other ones (and recommend you do so as well) before returning.",oEvsA_IvL0yRyI7d4lT-IA,1,0,3,WkDasFcI6Ye-x5SCHQQm1A

The second night I was with my mom who had the Surf and Turf - the ""surf"" was a huge lobster cut in half and ""helped"" out of its shell casing.  She gave me the claw.  It was buttery, tender and wonderful.

We're huge Top Chef fans and when we saw Rick kill it on Bravo we knew our trip to Vegas had to include RM Seafood.  We made reservations for lunch on Thursday and in we walked.

The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous.  Water flows about the ceiling  and the open kitchen makes you feel like a part of the action.  The modernness of it all is just perfect from what I wanted to experience from RM.  

We ordered the $24 Surf and Turf Roll (tempura prime beef, cherry peppers, crispy shallots, seared albacore ponzu, lavender honey) and it was hands down the best roll we've ever, and I mean EVER eaten.  I then ordered the Adam's Fish Sandwich (Beer Batter, Tartar Sauce, Aged Cheddar) which was yep, the best fish sandwich I've ever tasted...  though I will admit I've probably only had 3 fish sandwiches in my life.  But still - if I knew every fish sandwich would taste that good, that would be my go-to sandwich.  The fries that came with it were amazingly addictive.  Ohh and the homemade tartar sauce... I practically drank the rest of it in the cup.

He ordered the Fish Tacos Pico de Gallo (Shredded Cabbage, chipotle Cream) and he said they were in the top 3 fish tacos ever.  Super fresh and the flavors were so well balanced.  

Okay, so lots of praise.  Lots of ""BEST EVER!!!!""  But, RM Seafood deserves every word of praise.

Why 4 stars?  The service was TERRIBLE.  We were 2 of 8 people in the restaurant and the food took well over a half hour to come out.  The waiter spent too much time trying too hard to get to know us and then disappeared for a long time after we asked him to check on the food.  They didn't take our used plates away after the sushi roll and left us with a cluttered table as we waited for so long for our lunch.  Also?  By the time the food actually showed up, I was too hungry and literally forgot to take a picture of my sandwich.  Which never happens.  I'd actually give service here a 1 star.

We finished with Key Lime pie with cilantro syrup and tiramisu with coffee sorbet.  The key lime pie had a graham cracker crust with hint of cinnamon and the cilantro syrup was delicious. I am so glad Bryan suggested it!

Our service was totally top tier.

Atmosphere is very nice bright modern and upscale with both lower and upper dining seating. 

Waitress was very pleasant looked like a young Sally Fields.  After taking our drink orders, various drinks, glasses of wine etc are ordered and they server a complimentary homemade bisquit and corn bread basket that was excellent with a sweet creamy butter.   Appetizers were in no particular order a Grilled Octopus which was told was excellent.  A really good white clam chowder with chunks of clams in a rich broth.  Big Eye Tuna, fresh and tasty.  Sea Irchin really not my cup of tea but was told outrageous.  A disappointing crab cake that was small and lacked the lump of blue crab you expect especially for a $24.00 appetizer.  Some other Sushi types all very fresh. 

Entrees were well Pricey.  Filet mignor and 1/2 cleaned lobster $80.00 was good but not great.. A flat iron steak with grilled shrimp in butter, lemon spices was excellent while a linguini with shellfish in a white  type sauce was pretty good as well. A Honestly I can't remember what all 8 diners had, but entrees ranged from very good to OK.  Prices were really pretty expensive.  All and all a good experience with very  high price points in an upscale atmosphere.   Your paying for the big rent in the Casino so you take it with a grain of salt.

Our waitress was really nice when we sat down, but didn't come to check on us very often so it took us longer to order and get our food.  PLUS the server (not our waitress) spilled champagne all over my boyfriend and our table and completely ruined his gray suit and wool jacket.  Besides a quick apology, there was no acknowledgment that his clothes were ruined and wet for the rest of dinner and our night!!

The food that came afterward definitely came out slowly and was only partially impressive.   We had steak tartare, oysters and clam chowder that was ABSOLUTELY delicious.  It was AMAZZZZING.  The steak tartare was an amuse-bouche and it was perfectly crunchy, fresh and spiced to perfection.  The oysters were cold and served with lemon and cocktail sauce.  The clam chowder was incredibly filling, rich, creamy and had large chunks of clams~  Our dessert of an ice cream sampler was also incredible because we were given vanilla bean, mixed berry sorbet, pistachio, and chocolate Kahlua.

But our main course was RM style Cioppino and it was TERRIBLE.  The sauce was watery, the noodles overpowered the dish, and it had way too much going on.  Although I ate all the seafood (cause I didn't want to waste it), I could have TOTALLY lived without this.  There was nothing special going on.  The red sauce was spicy and not strong enough for all the huge flavors going on in the dish.

After the big champagne incident (which happened before we even got our bread basket at the start of the meal), and AFTER we moved tables, my boyfriend and I thought that at the VERY least we thought the restaurant would comp some of our dishes or at least offer to pay for the expensive dry cleaning bill.  But there was never further acknowledgment of the huge mess of a meal that was made.  We will NEVER be going back there and we will NEVER EVER recommend this place to any of our friends.

I can't believe that the restaurant could possibly charge food at the prices that it did and treat its customers like crap.  DO NOT GO HERE.  TERRIBLE SERVICE.  OVERPRICED FOOD.

For an entree I tried the Lobster Roll.  A nice Lobster Salad stuffed into a Bread roll.  

All washed down with a couple of bottles of Monchof Riesling.

Yes we wanted a nice casual place to have good food and to hang out with a couple of friends but I didn't expect to get very mediocre food.  What's the point of serving a huge amount of food (and really, the servings are huge!) if it's not excellent?!  Both my husband and I were not impressed at all.  

I had the steamed mussels and the mussels were very fresh but the sauce was a little on the salty side and blah... I mean, just nothing to write home about.  The gumbo is HUGE!  If you plan on ordering it, SHARE!  Gumbo is heavy to begin with and I thought it was just silly to serve that much.  Even the hungry man at our table couldn't finish his (without appetizers).  Yes, it's full of good seafood and sausage... but still, nothing special.  I wasn't expecting to eat the best gumbo of my life but I was expecting something better then what I got... My husband got the RM roll for appetizers (rice was soggy YUK!) and the roll uninteresting... and everything encrusted tuna.  Now this serving was small... weird - they can't seem to figure out their portions, I guess.

After being seated, our server came over to tell us about the specials for the evening: cracked steam crab and lobster over orzo or a classic ""Surf & Turf"" (lobster and filet mignon)  He also told us that they had fresh geoduck--which piqued my interest immediately.

We started off with wine and one order of sashimi each: she ordered arctic char and I asked for the geoduck.  The sashimi was excellent.  The arctic char was very fresh and just melted in our mouths.  The chef made a special prep for the geoduck, serving it with thin slices of kumquat and asparagus with a soy, miso glaze.  This special dish looked beautiful and tasted briny and sweet.  

Our entrees arrived.  The ""Surf & Turf"" was terrific (better than the last one we had at The Palm in D.C.)  I also had the branzino with spring veggie ragu and romesco.  The branzino tasted fresh, clean, and light.  Which contrasted nicely with the romesco.  I was impressed by how creamy the cippolini onions were in the veggie ragu.

(Be warned, I asked our waiter... in his two years working there, no one has gotten the sampler for free.  The closest he saw was 14 correct).

The first two flavors we tried were vanilla and chocolate.  I think they do this on purpose... to build your confidence and get you to lower your guard.  That is a mistake.  Next to the chocolate scoop was a light orange colored scoop, so I took a big bite thinking it was some sort of orange flavor.  It turned out to be sriracha!  Quite a different flavor, and probably better in small doses.  So that is my advice to anyone who tries this out... take small bites.

They rotate the flavors each week, so you may not get sriracha.  But you will get something that you don't typically think of as a dessert flavor.  And you will probably walk away, thinking your pallette is not nearly as sophisticated as you thought it was.  This happened to me with the ""sour cream"" flavor.  I put ""sour cream"" in quotes, because I'm still not convinced that what the restaurant said was sour cream actually was sour cream.  To me, it tasted exactly like key lime and I told our waiter this.  Apparently, I don't know what real, fresh sour cream tastes like..  And I guess I don't know what key lime tastes like either. 

Still, this was a fun food experience for my husband and me.  And it would be a great thing to try out with a group of friends.  I'll have to see if I can improve on my current score of 8/16.",oxJ4R-1TqBjegZHU6h1bKg,1,1,4,yqiUioNfm2s8q1cudJBZhA

4933559,2011-01-17,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"I am a foodie (and a Top Chef Fan), so when I ran across an online offer for a prefix four course meal and a great price for RM Seafood, I made a reservation for myself and three of my colleagues.  When I made the reservation, I wasn't made aware that their were two dinning rooms (I hadn't mentioned that we would be using a special offer either) which would have been nice.

I called to confirm the reservations weeks before and was told they had no record of it.  They reset the reservation and even called me the day before to confirm it.  When our party arrived, I was told ""We show no reservation for you"".  Huhhh?  We were then shoved into the back corner near the bar across from a drunken group of conventioneers. Lovely.

Once the server appeared, we gave her the dinning vouchers and with a roll of her eyes she said ""let me get you your SPECIAL menus"".  The offerings were only a step above the kids menu at Denny's.  Had the vouchers not been prepaid, we would have passed entirely.

The manager, Paul came over and aggressively explained how he had been snookered into this ""coupon thing"" that was to have been offered to locals only.  He offered no solutions to our concerns. We were stuck and tried to make the best of it.

The amuse, was not amusing. I am still not sure what it was, as it was the smallest taste I have ever seen.  Like they split one amuse into four micro-units.

We decided to order regular menu appetizers of crab cakes, ahi tuna tartar and fried calamari, which arrived a full 30 minutes after being ordered. Each were unexceptional in taste and presentation.  The only thing memorable for each of these dishes was their large price tag.

For the second course were had wedge salads were a fair attempt, though the apple walnut salad that I received had an unpleasant brown hue.

Three of us ordered the Cioppino that was offered for the third course.  It was horrible!  The shrimp was over cooked and the mussels could have passed for those plastic sushi bar models. Two sorry bread sticks straddled the bowl hoping not to fall in.  Needless to say - dishes were barely touched. One colleague ordered the Artic Char, which she said was tasty.  Lucky girl.

The dessert was an ice cream tasting game.  Which could have been a great deal of fun, had we not been so disappointed with everything else at that point.

We were shocked and dumbfounded when we received the bill (baring in mind the the four courses had been prepaid) at the cost of four cocktails, a bottle of so-so wine, appetizers and a hefty gratuity which was added on.  $ 480.00 additional!

So, in summary: Bad front desk, bad management, terrible ambiance, slow service (7:00 pm reservation, left at 10:45!), iffy to horrible food, astro-prices!

Although they don't show it on the menu link in Yelp, they had sushi the night we were there.  I had a sushi roll with crab, lobster and jalapeno and it was good.  However, I think $25 for a sushi roll is a bit over the top.  

I do give high marks for the Miso soup. It was probably the best I have had.

Then the waiter was rude and awful.

After complaining to one manager and getting blown off we had to wait 20 minutes to talk to the general manager who then argued with us about why the poorly plated version was delivered. The entire evening was so disappointing and insulting we will most definitely never go back nor recommend it to anyone. Take your money elsewhere you'll be glad you did!

as far as the food goes, it was less than amazing. The cod had half a piece of bok choy and a tiny piece of pineapple the sauce had hardly any flavor. The scallops were small and nothing amazing.

4961399,2015-04-26,4,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Fancy food.  I don't generally eat food like this, but when you visit Vegas, places like this abound.  Every hotel/casino has at least one of these places with the ""executive chef"" and composed plates with an entree and sides.  Spots like this run on the border between restaurant and modern art gallery in terms of how your meal is prepared.  The ""art"", in this case, is the chef's food--there's no quibbling about the high price because you're not there to fill your stomach like you would at Denny's. You're there to experience the chef's taste creations.  It's going to be expensive and you know that going in--this really isn't an issue unless the food is awful.  *Hold that thought*

We started with clam chowder.  Actually, it was more like a lukewarm bisque, and had a bitter cast to it.  Not really my style.  The skirt steak entree I ordered consisted of about seven smallish pieces of meat laid on a bed of creamy mashed potato with mushrooms and ""yumyum"" sauce.  The sauce had the heat of a hot salsa and made the potato ""yuckyuck""--it was inedible.  The steak was tasty-- I just cut each slice in half as I ate it so I could have the illusion that I was eating more food.

I also got a ten dollar serving of french fries--these were just about as spicy hot as the mashed potatoes, but if I didn't eat them, I would have had a near empty stomach.

My wife got a seafood plate--the Surf and Surf.  She said that it was ""good""--nothing special.  My daughter filled up on Caesar salad.

In total, $200 for ""okay"" food or food so heavily spiced that I couldn't enjoy it.  Yeah, it was pretty awful, and what's the point of fancy if you don't enjoy it?

This was our second time visiting RM Seafood.  However, we only sampled ice cream during our first visit so I'm not really counting that time.

After getting our orders in, cornbread and biscuits arrived and they were so yum! We devoured them and they asked us if we wanted more.  Of course!  The second batch wasn't quite as good though.

First Course:
*  California Roll ""King Crab, Avocado, Cucumber, Sesame Seed"" - Normally, I wouldn't be ordering CA roll and it's probably because I'm a bit of  sushi snob.  But since they did advertise King crab and the waitress recommended it, we felt like we should.  You definitely see the chunks of crab in this roll, but the seaweed was definitely chewy in not a good way.  If you attempted to bite into the piece, you either have to avoid the seaweed on the first bite or take it all in.

* Rick's White Clam Chowder ""Potatoes, Littleneck Clams, Bacon"" - I definitely got the chunks of potatoes and clams, but didn't really taste the bacon in there.  There was also a strong taste in there that wasn't particularly my favorite part of it, the Husband said it was wine.

Second Course:
* Wagyu Hanger Steak ""Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Red Wine Jus"" - We were amazed with the generous portion of this steak and they had cooked it perfectly rare.  It was damn beautiful.  The mashed potatoes had chunks of lobster tail and claw meat throughout which surprised us both.  That was one delicious entree and a winner!

* Diver Scallops ""Roasted Cauliflower, Toasted Almonds, Drunken Raisins"" - Three perfectly cooked scallops with citrus peels and raisins that added a lovely and surprisingly sweetness to the scallops.  It was a really nice dish.  My only complaint would be that I wish there was a bit more sauce for my scallops.  But I would definitely order the scallops again!

Third Course:
* Nutella Creme Brulee ""Toasted Hazlenuts, Carmelized Banana"" - This was a nice size dessert course, although we were disappointed that the creme brulee wasn't warm.  Although we ordered two creme brulees, a key lime pie ended up on our table.  We let the server know immediately that wasn't ours and they took it away and brought out another creme brulee shortly.  When our waitress brought our check, we think she may have taken the Husband's dessert before he was completely finished.  It was only a couple more bites, but when he realized it was gone, he was a bit disappointed.

Overall, service was good.  The waitress was smart about bringing utensils for both of us for everything, assuming we were sharing and we were.  I had asked her about the ice cream sampler and she had mentioned she would bring the dessert menu by at the end of our meal.  She obviously forgot, as did I.  The amount of food in this prix fixe is generous.  We were hurting for sure.  The oyster menu and its descriptions sound fabulous and definitely had me curious about them all. We were seated in the outer part of the restaurant, so I could still smell the cigarette smoke from the casino.  If this is a concern, it's probably best to be seated further inside the restaurant.  I would definitely return and order the steak and scallops for sure!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,8,4,TovQvkiaMihalaPSZ_LzGA

We started with the tuna-two-ways (excellent), followed by the clam chowder (alright), then we moved on to the swordfish in a putanesca-ish sauce (good), and on to the halibut with peas (alright) and finally to the desert rocky-road ""bread pudding"" (so so).    So the food was fine, but I think I could have done better ordering off the menu myself (some oysters rather than the chowder, may be the tuna sashimi or  a vegetable side or two and may be skip the deserts).

The drinks were kinda disappointing.  The waitress recommended a ""garden martini"" which was all sour and no gin or other flavor, I had a recommended sake and for $12, it came out in a 1oz  cup.    We got two glasses of white wine that again were recommended... one was a really weird Napa-Sonoma Chard/SavBlanc mix (neither here nor there and the other was a super-fruiting NZ SavBlanc.

The service, the flavor of the food, the portion sizes, the atmosphere... absolutely top notch on every level. I came with my mom, my sister, and my friend to celebrate my birthday dinner and now I can't think of a better way to have done it. I didn't look on Yelp to closely to see if they differentiated between the upstairs or the downstairs so I would like to clarify that this review is for the downstairs restaurant. 

We're not from Vegas and don't come to Mandalay Bay when we do visit so we arrived a bit late for our reservation since we had issues with parking and finding the restaurant but the hostesses were very nice and understanding. Our server helped my sneaky sister pick out a surprise champagne and Sauvignon Blanc to complement our dinner and they were just perfect. I had a difficult time deciding what to get but our server was able to make some great recommendations of things we needed to get in case we weren't able to make it back again. 

My mom and sister opted to get the 3 course dinner for $55 while my friend and I ordered a la carte. We shared the tuna duo, Jonah crab California roll, crab cake, and clam chowder for starters. The tuna, California roll and crab cake were all delicious but I the clam chowder was the best I have ever had. Now, I'm a HUGE clam chowder fan and I always try it at every place I go to that has it and I can very honestly say that this is the absolute best clam chowder ever. It had the right amount of creaminess, the perfect balance of vegetables and clams to soup, but the flavor is something that I am going to have dreams about. Seriously, this is my new standard for clam chowder. 

Moving on from the awesomeness of the clam chowder... I got the diver scallops, my sister got the salmon, my mom got the cioppino, and my picky little non-seafood eating friend got the Caesar salad and special ordered a sushi roll with just avocado and cream cheese (I thought it was nice of them to entertain a special request an off the menu order). My scallops were amazing - perfect texture and slightly sweet. The pasta that it came with was pretty good but I was already getting full so I put my full eating attention on the scallops. I tried a bite of my sister's salmon and it was good but I think pretty much all salmon dishes taste the same since salmon is overpowering to begin with. She really liked it so that's the important part. My mom's cioppino looked REALLY good. It was slightly soupy, had lots of seafood and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I like most seafood but mussels and shrimp are don't agree with me so cioppino is something that is not for me but my mom and sister talked about how good it was for the rest of the night. My friend's Caesar was good but you can get a good Caesar anywhere. 

We were all really stuffed full at this point but the three course dinners that my mom and sister ordered came with desserts so we ordered the key lime pie and the Fat Elvis. I'm not a big fan of key lime pie but everyone else liked it quite a bit. The Fat Elvis was very interesting and I think everyone should try it once. It was a banana with peanut butter, chocolate, and bacon wrapped up like a spring roll with this passion fruit syrup on the side. After the first bite, we weren't sure if we liked it or not but somehow we managed to finish the whole thing. It was sweet and slightly savory, crunchy and mushy at the same time. I wasn't crazy about the passion fruit syrup but I don't like things that are really sweet. It was certainly not something that I could eat every day but it was so interesting that I'm very sure I was have to get it again. I would like to come back to try the ""guess the flavor"" of ice creams.

5035734,2010-06-18,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"This review is for the downstairs, which is casual enough to wear shorts and sandals.

We ate here two years ago and there were 2 other tables with people in the entire restaurant, now that he is on Top Chef Masters is it a completely different story. 

I called ahead to make a reservation for 6 and was told that there is never a wait for the downstairs area and therefore no need to make a reservation. When we arrived we could see it was packed and the girl at reception informed us that the wait would be 40 minutes. I explained we had called and asked to make a reservation and she just said that someone made a mistake. OK, not a problem. I understand that he is on TV and people are curious. We were all busy chatting anything so it was not a bother.

It was pretty much 40 minutes on the dot. We were walked through and sat at a table near the bar, which normally I wouldn't mind but this happened to be the most uncomfortable seating I've had in a long time. A picnic bench would have been more pleasant. It was a really tall table and the stools were barely padded and far from the ground. I am just under 5'5 and my feet could not touch the foot rest, so my legs just dangled the entire time. Other (taller) guests were of course able to reach the foot rest, but had their legs go to sleep on them from sitting in a weird position from the odd stool shape. Anyway, it was uncomfortable considering we ended up sitting for 2 hours.

It took quite a long time to be greeted by our waiter, not a problem since it's busy. Our cocktails were great and we received our appetizers rather fast. My crab cake was delicious but a friend's sushi was average at best.
And then, the real wait began. It took an hour from the time we had our appetizer until we received our entrees with barely a check in from the waiter the entire time. I was really shocked! By this time (near closing) half the restaurant was empty so I can't say it was due to crowds.
Everyone had something different and everyone had a different take on whether or not it was good. My shrimp and risotto was not very good, the risotto wasn't cooked properly and I had 4 shrimps which just didn't fill me up. Those having scallops said they were OK, those having steaks said they were good but nothing to write home about. One person had the small seafood tower which was probably had the best review although still wasn't a ""wow"" dish. 

I guess our mistake was sitting in the downstairs, I can only assume that the upstairs guests are served better and with better quality food. But honestly, the tab for the 6 of us was $500 (before tip) so I don't think we should have been treated like red headed stepchildren.

5057814,2010-01-19,1,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"This is a two-part review:

Part One: Lunch--The Burger. As unlikely as it may seem, for my money, RM Seafood makes THE BEST HAMBURGER in Las Vegas. Executive Chef Adam Sobel (who came from Bradley Ogden's kitchen, and has topped their famous burger) makes a juicy all-natural Niman Ranch patty cooked with just a slight char, firm in texture but light enough to fall apart. On the standard butter-toasted sesame seed bun, topped with shredded lettuce, melted cheddar, onions smothered until almost compote, and a perfect heirloom tomato slice. The only fault here is sloppiness-and for some, that's a plus. 

Part two: Dinner. Simply some of the best seafood (in terms of product and preparation) you will have *anywhere.* And it's all sustainably harvested. Start with a bowl of their signature clam chowder, the ultimate expression of that simple soup, filled with freshly shucked clams, bacon, onions and other vegetables, each flavor distinct yet complementary. Or, if you don't join the throngs ordering the two-tier raw bars, other remarkable starters include a single white Georgia shrimp, crusted with aromatic toasted garlic and spices, vanilla-orange confit, basil essence and cucumber ""noodles;"" the Deadliest Catch ""salad,"" an arty presentation of buttery Alaskan king crab, varieties of heirloom beets and compressed watermelons, and a cucumber blossom over a tomato and squid ink sauce that plays on your palate like swirling watercolors; and wild Sockeye salmon gravlax rolled with corn, dill crème fresh and American osetra caviar. 

Grilled swordfish, more mild and tender than typical, comes atop curried chic peas and under an olive-laden Niçoise crust, with preserved lemon to perk the palate. Steak frites offers juicy slices of velvety skirt steak with Bernaise sauce, aged 20 days and portioned to be part of a meal rather then the whole deal. The seasoned potato wedges definitely left us wanting more. 

A great punctuation mark to the meal comes in the form of a sake bomb (beer boilermaker with sake) accompanying a lightly fried piece of uni and foie gras rolled sushi-style, a gorgeous bloom of sugar, yeast and lipid. But if sweetness is required, you'll guffaw over Rick's Tasting Game, a chessboard of 16 mystery gelato flavors (laugh hard enough and the irrepressible chef himself may pull up a chair to tease you further). 

They are looking to finally re-open the top floor for even more fancy preparations by Moonen, Sobel and third star chef Gerald Chin soon. Can't wait to see what they come up with.",97TjZvvXtVZY91NEPZXZBQ,4,1,5,iR0oIVXE13Bg-mn0YKIklQ

Finally the waiter said they will do it manually and guess what, that didn't work either. 

So they wrote up a manual sales slip to ""bill it"" later. Well that did go through on my ATM as well as my credit card, really what a surprise. Scam is the word that comes to mind with how they treated me and my family.

Many additional visits over the years since my original review and I've realized my go to dishes are things that are not cooked.  Huh?

Sad but true, I only long for the oyster tasting at RM.  Is the food that bad?  No.  The seafood is always fresh and properly cooked.  It's just boring.  A third of the menu is raw bar, another third soups and salads.  It doesn't leave much else for exciting mains.

Gone from the menu is the phenomenal fish sandwich.  Gone is the outstanding branzino.  

What happened to the creativity that made their sushi rolls great?  Forget about creativity, crunchy, under cooked rice.  Tiny slices of fish.  Avant garde sushi?  Not for me.

Finally, I'm so over trying to figure out when the second floor lounge and restaurant are open.  It's not an urban legend.  I've actually been there twice but lately it's always been closed for some reason or another.

VENUE: The place is located in the Mandalay Hotel Bay and Resort near the theatre. Not too big but not cramped, the place has a bar and seating for plenty. The door that opens the restaurant is pretty darn cool. It's this huge square that looks like a wall but lo' and behold it opens up!

FOOD: My sister and I split the Fixed Prixe Meal for $55. Three courses from a selection of items. We opted for the ""Clam Chowder"" to start, followed by the ""RM style Cioppino"" rounded out by the ""Fat Elvis"" for dessert. The clam chowder, although appearing to be bit salty as per the first bite, gradually progressed into a warm and calming creamy taste of the sea with every spoonful after. Each bite was delicious. The Cioppino was a lot bigger in portion than we had anticipated but that worked to our advantage because we were sharing. The pasta was chewy and dressed in a red sauce mixed with fish, shrimp, crab, and mussels. It was piping hot when it came out and we didn't even finish. The Fat Elvis was AMAZING. Fried banana wrapped in bacon and chocolate. All fried and dipped in a honey sauce. AMAZING i tell you. For those who enjoy turon or fried bananas, or bananas and chocolate. The bacon adds a pleasant and subtle surprise sweetness. 

SERVICE: Service was standard. There were times where I felt like our server was annoyed with us and she wouldn't do a good job hiding it, but either way we were checked on periodically by both server and even the manager(?)  inquiring about our time there.

Only after I went there again did parts of the first meal start coming back to me - I remembered I got the shrimp and scallop ceviche, but must not have been very impressed. The recent dinner I had at the bar since I was in a hurry and only interested in the raw bar anyway after skimming the menu (most of the seafood preparations reminded me of red lobster. not in any good way, if there's even a good way to be reminded of red lobster).

i got the oyster sampler and a half dozen littlenecks. i got two each of miyagi, wellfleet and blue points. they were not great, even though i usually like wellfleets and blue points. the littlenecks were definitely not good - they tasted fishy, which i've never experienced before with littlenecks, and made me wonder how fresh they were. and some of them were mangled in the shucking process, so it really took points from presentation. 

i liked the service both times i was there though, and the bartender was really good, especially since he only charged me for one oyster rather than the sampler! i should have noticed it when i paid the bill, but i was pretty out of it from - well, being in vegas - but as i was leaving, i wondered to myself how my bill cost just a few dollars more than the price of the oyster sampler.

The waiter was very fast and gave us a lot of information on the food and drink options. We ordered a bottle of wine, there was a huge selection with many price options. For an appetizer we had the soup of the day, an amazing butternut squash with smoked salmon plus we chose the chard octopus. They split the order of soup for us which was nice. The octopus was cooked perfectly. So tender. 

For the main course I had the Baramundi and my husband had the ginger crusted halibut. The sauce on mine was terrific, the fish was nicely cooked with the skin just a bit crispy. We also had a side of brussels sprouts, plenty big enough to split. They were amazing, I was never a fan before but I could have had those as my main dish they were so good.

The manager stopped by and checked on us and we chatted a bit. He later sent out a free dessert for my husbands birthday, a very nice touch.

5181386,2014-08-28,1,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"Fall restaurant week 2014. This is a great cause and Rick Moonen has always been gracious to add his menus to the lineup. Last restaurant week we went to Rx Boiler room so this time we decided to go downstairs and try The RM Seafood menu. I used Open Table to reserve our spot which takes some of the hassle out making reservations. RM seafood called the day before and then day of to reconfirm our reservation, point to them. We arrived on time and were greeted by a very friendly staff. Immediately we were offered water and drink order. I got a beer and a diet coke wife got a coke. Here is my only negative, $4.50 for soda, I am not a cheapskate but that to me is crazy. We were brought an abundance of cornbread and buns. Bread was never empty. Careful not to fill up on it.

On with the meal. (I will post pictures later). I had the Rick's White Clam Chowder.
I am a fan of New england style chowder so to me this was a must try. Littleneck clams, potatoes and bacon. Very flavorful unlike some chowders I have had there were many little clam bites floating about. Small hint of bacon and the taters were not so big as to take away from the clams. The wife had the Thai Green Papaya Salad. I just had a taste of this but it was refreshing. There were peanuts on the plate and when I took a bite with them it added an aromatic herb salty twist.

Second Course Butter Basted True North Salmon. Has a smoked tea rub which gave it the smoked paprika taste I use on my own Salmon at home. Laid on a cucumber salad with a horseradish cream. So smoky, tangy perfectly cooked sustainable salmon meal. On this course the wife (Josie) had Grilled Niman Ranch Skirt Steak with old bay fries. There was a korean BBq marinade that had sweet and bitter tones both at the same time. Perfectly cooked and as you take a bite it would just melt into your palate. Hardly needed to chew. Old Bay fries....tasty with that bite you love on an old bay biscuit or great piece of southern catfish. 

Last course..Rick's Key Lime Tart. Has a swiss meringue on top and a Cilantro syrup underneath. (No the Cilantro did not ruin it). Nothing too outstanding here, good flavor and a sweet topping that made it more appealing and flavorful than a whipped topping. The Cilantro syrup had a hint of the spice but not so much that it killed the dish. Josie has the Perfect Peach  Semolina Cake. Sorry no wow factor here. A nice desert to end the meal but for us not a flashy desert. 

Overall will come here again to  try a full menu meal. Not crazy for soda prices but why be picky over that. I will say drink  was never empty. If you get a chance to visit here please do you will not regret it. Rick Moonen has done great and is a avid supporter of local charities and does many things with other chefs citywide.

I got most of them right, but seriously some of them tasted so weird and I was guessing cactus or even car paint hahahahahaha.  Not joking!!!  And I found out it was some kind of fruit.

My waitress was sweet but she kept forgetting stuff.  At first she forgot Fat Elvis.  Then I asked for Ice Cream Guessing Game because she forgot we ordered that too.  I asked for the check and she forgot to give it to us.  We waited a long time for a lot of stuff.

I had a salad and the chicken entree.  It was ...just okay. The desert was 16 different kinds of sorbet. All house made. You had to see if you could guess what each were made of.  I think I got just one correct.  I think  the biggest deal breaker was the way they handled the bill.  It just had so much tricky accounting on there it made it hard to understand what they were doing.  It wasn't until after we left the restaurant we started to analyze it a bit more and  realized they ultimately charged us way more on the food and the gratuity.   I think they figured it out in the end at $189.00 rather than the $169 TravelZoo quoted.  We would have been better off just going with the $55 advertised at the front of the restaurant. They  charged tax and gratuity on the $189 a couple and added gratuity twice on the side items we ordered. We should have stuck to the regular menu; it would have been half the cost.

5390383,2013-04-26,2,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"This is for the Downstairs section.

Worst service I've experienced in a restaurant in over a decade.   When you read this, you'll think I have incredibly good luck because it wasn't nearly as horrific as some of the stories I've read on other reviews for other restaurants, but for my own experiences, this was incredibly insulting.

Enter: Josef (this is what the receipt said for the Cashier, so I'm going by that.  If he was around more often I might have been able to catch his name myself).   The meal started with my being intrigued by an option on the cocktails menu that was ""Dealer's Choice"" in that the bartender would create a drink for you.   I'm adventurous enough to try it, but I did want to first know if there was a chance I'd get some fruity concoction.   Our server seemed a little annoyed at this, but ultimately he said he could provide the bartender some slight guidance (whiskey based) and that was that.  I'll be honest and say this didn't rub me the wrong way at the time, but in retrospect it was foreshadowing in nature.

When he returned my drink was sort of a take on a manhattan, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  So far so good.  Taking our food order I felt like he kept trying to upsell us on the menu, both with appetizer suggestions and then barraging me with the idea of adding scallops to my sea bass entree.  NO MEANS NO JOSEF.  3 NOs later and he had our order in.  Our food was brought out and we started eating.   Pretty sure we didn't engage with Josef from that point forward until he tried to sell us on dessert.  In the meantime, my friend's drink sat completely empty for nearly the entire meal (at LEAST half an hour), and mine for about 15 minutes of that also sat empty.  I'd love to say that there could have been an excuse for this, but when I'm seeing the guy visit the table IMMEDIATELY to our left and right MULTIPLE times each (and discussing things like his son's hobbies and other extremely interesting topics) all the while, there's just nothing to say except for that he's an awful server.   I'm definitely insinuating something when I say that those two couples seemed to be ordering up quite a storm, and I'm thinking our reluctance to bite on the upsells might have made us less important.  Shame, because what we lacked that night in hunger, we would have easily made up for in thirst quenching $10-$15 cocktails.   In fact, when he finally did show his face again to ask if we needed anything else, he STILL didn't ask if we wanted our drinks refreshed.   Apparently Josef thought we were of the cacti family.

For what it's worth I enjoyed my fish quite a lot.   It was cooked to perfection and the sauce and other components present really pulled it together.  Subtle but delicious.  Being ignored though lessened the quality of the meal overall to where I just stopped caring about the food and started planning my Yelp vengeance.   

This was probably our 4th or 5th visit and is our last for the time being.  I'd consider returning but only if I could verify that he would not be our server.  Thanks guy!

It is also very fast if you are looking to go to a show. We work, and so we have roughly about an hour for dinner before a show. This restaurant always gets us out in time with food that is perfectly prepared. The service is literally impeccable.
The food is delicious! I have eaten their harvest salad which is absolutely outstanding! Their clam chowder is one of the best I have ever had. Their clam chowder is one of the best I have ever had. They have a nice sushi menu, although I will say a little bit on the expensive side for the sushi. Their catch of the day is always delicious and their salmon is fantastic. Not to mention the small warm mini biscuits that come to your table after you order the meal, which are seriously irresistible.
The desert is a hit or miss, yet it is a definite hit with the tiramisu. We ordered the dessert sampler. The tiramisu is so yummy. The key lime pie is good but I have had a lot better. We were not impressed with the cheesecake and we were not impressed with their berry cake. They do make a flourless chocolate cake that is only featured in the desert sampler, as we did not see it as a separate order, and it too is good.
The wine selection is impressive. Their seafood is outstanding.
The ambience of the restaurant is beautiful. It is open and inviting and it is a very comfortable setting. It is not loud which I like. The prices are reasonable to slightly expensive, but nothing is exorbitant. I am local and I know the fine restaurants in Las Vegas so this restaurant is quite moderately priced compared to others.
If you are attending the Michael Jackson 'ONE' show, this is the ideal restaurant as not even one minute away. It is situated in the Mandalay Bay just outside of the entrance to the Delano, so connects both hotels perfectly. It also is on the first floor right next to Mandalay Place, for lots of shopping, where Mandalay Place is on the second floor via escalator. It is well situated.

What could of been an excellent dining experience was ruined by the goons they have as management. There are a lot of restaurants that treat their employees like crap even when those said employees are very pleasant to the guests. It's another whole different thing when they bully and derate their staff in front of customers, especially customers that are paying a hefty price for their meal. I don't need to see that or hear managements grievances with their employees. The reason we go out is to enjoy our meal in a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere,  this was not.

The evening started with a chef ( I am guessing ) yelling at the bartender that was showing me to the restroom, yes in front of me!! No regards for a guest feeling uncomfortable, I guess how he felt or what he needed to air out was more important then a guest's dining experience. 

I decided to forget about it and just enjoy my evening. We had the grilled octopus that was lovely and the wagyu tartare!! There were few interruptions to our meal with management coming to the bar looking irate and speaking to our bartender about one thing or another and it was obviously upsetting our bartender getting yelled at from time to time in front of us.

We ordered the lobster that was overcooked but the sweet corn flan was delicious that came with it. At this point 2 different managers that looked like 2 different versions of The Incredible Hulk came behind the bar and were yelling at her ( the bartender),. She told us they were sending her downstairs because it was busy.  She returns and it seems like her and management are having some kind of altercation.  ( again in front of us) She begins to cry  and told us they sent her home. So we decided to get our check and leave although we were going to order more food.
 We really wanted to pay her for our tab so we can tip her but it seemed like she had to leave now!!  We finally get her over there to take her tip money before she leaves.  Horrible experience!! One of the managers said he was going to take care of us for the rest of the night. By this time we were so disgusted with their unprofessional behavior that we wanted to leave and never return and we told him  that as well.  He proceeded to say that she should have not behaved like that. I am sorry you are a manager, you should not behave like that! You should have the tact and professionalism that your tittle implies. Instead you have no regard for your guest and their experience!! You have a problem with your employee take care of it behind closed doors, not while I am eating my $70.00 dollar lobster!! This was a very slow evening on top of it and they have 2 unprofessional managers on?? That's a joke. The worst dining experience I have had in a long time!! if ever!

SO on this visit, myself and two friends decided to check it out. We ordered a variety of things including the fish tacos, the burrata salad, the green curry mussells and the mac and cheese. 

I specifically asked the waiter if the fish tacos were grilled or fried and he told me grilled. Unfortunately, when the tacos came out they were fried.  It wasn't a huge deal but when I pointed it out he said the Chef had changed the recipe and he wasn't aware. He offered to bring me new ones but I had already just peeled the batter off so it wasn't a big deal BUT I was disappointed the wait staff and Chef don't have better communication. This really shouldn't happen in a restaurant of this caliber. 

The watermelon and burrata salad was tasty if sparse with a very small pile of burrata.  The flavors were very good but it's really not for sharing as barely enough of an appetizer for one person. 

My friend's green curry mussels were a disappointment -- they were very unappetizing to look at as the sauce was super thin and a very unpalatable dull green color. The mac and cheese w pork was yummy but has a very distinct jalapeno taste so if you're not a fan I'd stay away from that dish. 

The highlight of lunch was the ice cream name game dessert -- which was really fun! Recommend you try it but be warned there are some nearly impossible ones so odds are you won't guess them all. Chamomile?!

Lots of complex flavors and an overall delicious drink I'd love to have again. 5/5

The clam chowder was well-balanced in its use of ingredients. No one ingredient overpowered the soup in terms of flavor or volume (not too clammy or hammy, not too much potato or celery filler). The soup wasn't starchy or thick. It was a bit too salty, but it was so tasty, I'd still give the dish 4/5. 

The lobster rolls were the BEST I've ever had. Fresh, tender, and meaty lobster, dressed with a tangy sauce that was not too creamy or thick, stuffed in a nicely toasted, sweet bun. Absolutely amazing. 5/5

We found ourselves with an open Saturday night in Vegas, so I booked an upstairs table for 6:30 on-line while lounging at the pool. When we showed up at 6:30, they had no record of our reservation. I showed the hostess our confirmation number on my iPhone and was told that they have problems with the on-line system. 

After a few minutes we were shown to an open booth. A gentleman stopped by, introduced himself as one of our servers for the evening, filled our glasses with water and dropped off menus. We chose a bottle of wine, decided that we would both have the 7 course tasting and waited to order....for 10 minutes. Not a glance from anyone. I asked my lovely wife if she would be offended if we got up and left at the 12 minute mark. She agreed that if the service did not begin we would be stupid to pay $135 a piece to be ignored. Just under the mark, our server returned and asked how he could help us. I replied that ordering some food and wine would be a awesome start.

From that point on everything was perfect. Seven tasting-sized courses that started with simple, clean fish presentations that advanced to duck and braised beef, as well as 4 amuse bouche, built upon each other to create one of the most thoughtfully well-rounded meals that I've experienced.

First, the host asked for my full name, which was odd. Then asked if I had any food allergies, which I thought was thoughtful.

Started with the soup of the day, the butternut squash soup. AMAZING... rich creamy, with dungeness crab. Was going to order the white clam chowder but saw that they put bacon in it :( Bacon covers the clam flavor! When will people stop putting bacon in the clam chowder? maybe just a tad in manhatten clam chowder. But not white/ new england! 

Then the uni nigiri (I go through sushi withdrawal) $10 and very fresh but pretty skimpy on the pieces. Next was the black cod. A bit on the small portioned size, as expected and it was good. Nice miso flavor to the veggies. The cod was cooked well, flakey not undercooked like most places. Wasn't fantastic, but it was good and enjoyable.

Drinking the straw hut cocktail. Gin, mint, pineapple... Perfect! Especially with 1/2 off happy hour 3-7pm. Would drink more if I weren't driving...

Pastry chef gave some mini chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies on the house with my check. A bit on the sweet side, but nice gesture.",j21johq2i4IO5JFIJnXEMw,1,0,4,JCQS4ZSZDMRaHhWeJFIViQ

Jumbo shrimp cocktail appetizer which was the highlight of the meal. 6 jumbo shrimp with an amazing cocktail sauce. Only issue, not enough sauce. Then the wait of an hour for the meal to arrive. My wife had the clam chowder  (not a big eater] I had surf and turf. The lobster ok on the verge of being rubbery.  The filet cooked to my medium rare but very little flavor. Expect much more for 89 bucks. Side of roasted fingerling potatoes which were cool by the time it hit the table.

Wife's clam chowder was a disappointment. No chunks of clam or vegetable only a blended mess. Also came out very cool temperature. 

Overall food was cooler temperature than expected.

Assumed that with the RM name the quality would be high and the food excellent.  I was somewhat conflicted about what rating to give for the restaurant.

Drink started off while we waited for our table to be ready, about 45 minutes for a walk in group of 6, not bad in my opinion.  Had a Hedricks gin and tonic at the bar.  Well made and balanced, not weak but not overpoweringly alcoholic.  Quick bar service.

The bread came to the table with 2 types.  The cornbread was fairly standard and average.  However, the biscuits were dense yet moist.  The tight crumb was refreshing with a moist buttery center.  I was a fan instantly.

I chose the house signature bib salad.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp with a high quality bib lettuce.  The green goddess dressing was excellent, this was by far the best green goddess dressing I have ever had anywhere.

The main dish was halibut with pea and a basil broth.  The fresh halibut was disappointing.  Flesh was firm but dry, there was little preserved moisture toward the edge of the filet.  The halibut appeared to be a quality piece, but the preparation and cooking could have been better.  The basil broth was thin, watery, and bland.

The high point of the dish was the peas and the pea shoots.  They were tender and sweet with a bright taste.  However, they did not make up for the rest of the dish.

Staff was quick, courteous, and very helpful.  However, the few high points of the night did not make up for the problematic main dish.  If the halibut was better I would have gone up to 4 stars, but unfortunately I can not in good conscience do so.",M4t4iuq_VtheOHSr0FNlUg,0,0,3,0OtlaQeHsx7KW049ShKf0w

One thing I love about Rick Moonen is that he will never use seafood that is not sustainable.  You won't find certain types of fish on his menu- (Chilean Seabass, Orange Roughy...) I highly respect someone who is environmentally conscious and sticks to his standards.

The servers are very knowledgeable, and willing to spend time discussing dishes and recommendations.

And unlike many other places that just stamp a chef's name on it but you never see them...Moonen is there all the time!! He sat down at our table and chatted with us for a bit.  He signed his cookbook for me, and took pics with us.  He's a wonderful chef with great morals and standards.

Downstairs is more on the relaxed side of things but it is the same kitchen, many of the same items, and a slightly smaller price tag.  We have been eating out a lot lately so I opted for the clam chowder and the appetizer blue crab cake.  The chowder was excellent with large whole clams and an enjoyable flavor slightly less creamy than most chowders.  The crab cake was also excellent in flavor and the right consistency.  I also sampled my wife's  Prawn and lobster special (Surf and Surf) which I thought was the best dish at the table.    The smokey corn flavor added pizzazz to this dish.

         Another dinner for my parents anniversary on this Vegas trip, we came to RM Seafood Upstairs - This second level fine dining resto opened up earlier this year, but I didn't get a chance to visit on my last trip. We were at the bar downstairs instead. 

        This was my broski family first time, and so my darling nieces. They had watch Master Top Chef with me last season religiously, and so the 11 yrs old was so anxious to meet Chef Moonen. & later the chef surely made my nieces trip.

        Menu upstairs can be 5 course tasting menu or a la carte. Ingredients come from all over the world. Extensive wine list to everyone taste. We ordered a bottle of Château Paveil de Luze 2003 Margeaux Bordeaux, obviously I have this relationship with Bordeaux!

AMSUE BOUCHE: 
- Blue crab - this was really nice. 

- The Trout Roe spread - this was so good, tasty for bread! Serve in a cute Carviar box, wish I could take some home!

APPETIZERS:
- Caviar pancake with crème fraîche, 2 ways egg & onion - delish dish. I took a pix when I cut the pancake into half, plenty of caviar, what an elegant dish! Probably of my favorite dish of the night.

- Top Chef Masters famous ""Moon"" Doggies - (Downstairs menu) this was for my nieces - They got watch him made this dish, now they got to eat it.

- Mac and Cheese - (Downstairs menu) this was for my nieces - They licked it to the last bite!

- Spicy Tuna Roll -  bigeye and albacore tuna with cucumber, togarashi sauce with spicy tuna, sriracha, togarashi sauce - haha I want some sushi from downstairs menu, obviously! So good & so classic here!

- Marinated California Octopus - sweet peppers, black tomato, falafel -  I have this dish every single time I'm here, the last 2 years!

- Kumamoto Oysters, Meyer lemon, vanilla, spearmint - interesting sauce, my first time tried it this way, serve in a bed of sea salt, beautiful & unique plating!

- Pumpkin Soup - pumpkin seed streusel, Jonah crab, Ras el hanout (a popular blend of spices that is used across North Africa) - to my dad surprised, he enjoyed it a lot.

- Ricotta Gnudi - Pork belly, Parmesan Brodo, Andraki Egg Yolk - this was so unexpected dish. The broth was pouring over at the table. It reminds me of a Vietnamese dish the my mom cooked. Again, I love anything with pork belly!

ENTRÉES:

-  Labelle Farms Duck Breast. Quinoa Pilaf, Celery Root, Purple Kohlrab - Perfectly pink inside, tender, sweet.

- Cervena Venison Loin. Brussels Sprouts, Vidalia Onion, Pear Butter - perfectly prepared. 

- Veal 3x. Veal Cheek, Veal Sweetbreads, Veal Marrow Flan - The sweetbreads was insanely good, nice texture! I love this dish with the Bordeaux we ordered, perfect pairing in my book!

- Wild Striped Bass. Cauliflower four ways: Pickled, Puree, Caramelized & roasted? The bass was nice, soft inside.

- Arctic Char. Heirloom Beets, Matsutake, Horseradish Pudding - love the crispy skin.

DESSERTS:
- That famous ice cream blind tasting - for my niece to do the quiz herself.

- Vanilla ice cream for my niece.

- Petite Fours- chocolates & candies.

- Herbs drink - this special vase, with herbs & spices inside, just sitting on our table, till the end of our meal. Our server came out & demonstrated with some smoke, the aroma of the herbs & spices were amazing. They he pour hot water in it, served to us, the drink was not too sweet, almost tea-like & apple-cider-like, but the next level better! What a pleasant treat for all of us!

            The night was bitter sweet for me personally, my dearest, FAV chef/friend here, was his last day!

           The service was excellent from start to finish. Who said chef Rick Moonen only serves seafood, don't let that fool you! Try Upstairs menu & you will be blown away.

My boyfriend is a huge fan of seafood so when he heard that the Mandalay Bay was home to the best seafood restaurant in Vegas, we had to try it. I started with 6 pieces of white shrimp cocktail from the raw bar and it was one of the freshest tasting shrimp cocktails I've had. Shrimp cocktails are very important to me, especially in Las Vegas, where the thing was invented (bet you didn't know that, huh?). My boyfriend ordered the lobster rolls which is basically a chunky fresh lobster salad in a simple, buttered, toasted, soft roll. It came with a pickle and some chips and it was very freaking tasty.

Me being a purist, I decided to order Rick's Famous Fish and Chips. Whenever I go to a knew restaurant with a distinguished celebrity chef, and he's got his name on a menu item along with the word ""famous"" you bet your ass I'm going to order that no matter how plain and simple it sounds. I was torn between that and the mac n cheese, but I felt it would be sacrilegious to come to the best seafood restaurant in town and not order seafood.

The food came, I loved the shrimp cocktail and my boyfriend's lobster rolls, but Rick's ""famous"" fish and chips were too salty for me to eat. It was more the fish was too salty and not the batter. But it was also too greasy. I knew Rick Moonen hadn't been the one to have made it because just a few moments I had sent it back, he came and sat down at a table next to our's and started chatting with another couple. It was then that I found out his son works for him inside the restaurant and was also the person nice enough to take off the fish and chips off our tab and bring me something else (I ordered the lobster rolls, which costs a bit more than the fish and chips, so I'm sure he had no problem changing our tab).

All in all, the service was nice, but for a place that is supposed to specialize in seafood, I felt that the lunch menu at RM seafood (downstairs) wasn't very inspiring- like there wasn't anything on it that caught my eye or enticed me to try something different (although one of the lunch specials that day was a $45 burger that had a lobster tail stacked on top of it).

5658368,2017-05-28,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"For over three years, my husband has been trying to take me here to partake in the restaurant's ice cream challenge. My husband had high praise for the unique flavor assortment and house made quality so we finally had a chance to make it over with our 16 month toddler in tow. Excited to have a mini date night and share a fun after dinner treat with our son, we waited in line with a few other walk-ins. The hostess was clearly unhappy that we brought our son to the restaurant and seated us in the outdoor seating area - an extension that spills into the common area adjacent to the casino floors. After we placed our order, I noticed a strong trail of cigar and cigarette smoke and realized the smell was coming from the bourbon bar next door. We politely asked the waiter to be moved inside (there were plenty of open tables). The waiter said he had to check with the front desk. After several minutes, the waiter returned explaining that he couldn't seat us inside because all of the tables were reserved and that the noise issue should subside. I re-explained that it was due to the smoke smell and the fact that I didn't want to expose my child to it if possible (I recognize we are in Vegas after all). The waiter asked us to hold and said he'd return shortly. Ten minutes went by and another couple was seated in our area. The couple asked to be moved indoors and the SAME waiter moved them inside - never once stopping by our table. Then a food runner stops by with our ice cream and we informed him that we were waiting to be moved inside. He simply shrugs his shoulder and in a few short minutes, I see him take the same ice cream platter and delivers it to another table. Turned off by the lack of service and professionalism of an establishment, I asked a busboy to speak to the manager. Kiyoshi Banting, the General Manager checks in with our waiter (whom we were still waiting for) and then walks over to our table to ask what the issue was. For someone who took the time to understand the issue, he seemed neither apologetic or in a hurry to rectify the situation. Banting tells us that he will see what he can do and again does not return to provide us with an update. After another 5-10 minutes of waiting, my husband and I refused to have our night further impacted by such rude and unprofessional service. I asked for the corporate number and the manager's name and the hostess throws us further attitude (when she didn't even try to stop us as we were walking out). ""I don't see what's the problem - we're getting your table ready.""  Banting stops by at that moment to share with us that a table is being prepared inside. So I'm confused - 20 minutes ago, there weren't enough tables and now there is room?  And then on top of that Banting suggests that there was some miscommunication. And to think, we were just here for dessert. I can see based on other reviews that our experience is not unique. This place is clearly lacking in the service department and perhaps requires further review of its front of kitchen staff. For a restaurant that wears the Rick Moonen label - I'm shocked at the consistently poor reviews. I'll be reaching out separately to the head office, but in the meantime, given how many dining options exist in Vegas, spend your time and money elsewhere. My sincere hope is that other diners, perhaps ones in wheelchairs, pregnant women, etc. aren't treated as rudely.",Ad3isySghaXUSbtSrMDqgA,0,0,1,1o3u4DQTQtmxqBLmYtZ68g

Its a bit pricey.  So unless you win big, I wouldn't go here if you're on a budget.

I'll get to the point.  Typically, when you are offered soup or salad with your meal, one is to assume its included in the cost. Well, its not.  And of course, we didn't find that out, until we got the bill. The menu does not specify if it's excluded/included in the cost of the meal.  You would think so, given the cost....

Moral of the story, don't assume. And if you're not sure - ask the waiter before you order.

On to the disappointments - prices/value, portion size and quality.  The octopus appetizer was so itty bitty that it only afforded us one bite each.  And, it was overcooked, rubbery and none too hot.  Burnt chorizo served cold with rubber band octopus, no thanks!  Sadly the overprice entrees (think small plates) were a disappointment too.  My trio of scallops was inconsistent (two good, one horrible).  Worst of all, a pocket of salt on the scallop ruined my sense of taste.

I too fell victim to the Travelzoo scam, pre- paying nearly $90 for a ""four course"" meal for two. When we arrived at what looked like a strip mall type set up we were not allowed to sit inside, but told the Travelzoo specials are seated out here. Even though there were many empty tables inside, we were seated in a sectioned off area in the mall walkway at a table so small it could barely handle one diner, let alone two. 

Now, after being seated we were greeted by our Server, who explained that the four courses would not be enough and proceeded a heavy upsell campaign that resulted in our agreeing to a crabcake order. Yikes, I've been to timeshare presentations that were less pressured! 

Now on to the food...our first ""course"" was a teaspoon size tidbit of something pretty ok but so small I'd hardly call it a course. We were told it was intended to cleanse our pallet. This was followed by clam chowder for my husband and fugi apple salad for me. While the flavors in the chowder were good the potatoes were undercooked so the hard little lumps throughout ruined it. My salad consisted of four paper thin slices of apple topped with a slaw type salad mix. Again tasted ok, but so small I'd hardly call it a course. The crabcake was very good, but there was only one and it was $17. 

Somewhere in there we ordered a beer and a glass of wine to go along with our tap water. Didn't see much of our Server after the upsell speech but the Runner had us help him move our dirty dishes with each delivery...hardley a four star dinning experience to say the least. 

Now for the main course. I had the chopino and my husband had the salmon. Mine was ok, but not great and the salmon arrived nearly raw so my husband asked to have it cooked a bit more. Then, the front of the house Manager came by and mocked him for not appreciating ""sushi"". I can not tell you how rude these people are. 

And then we end with our last ""course"" which was desert for two and consisted of 16 tablespoon sized scoops of ice cream that we were to taste and guess the flavor. While I don't call this a course or a desert, it could have been fun but the bacon and wasabi flavors left us with such a bad taste I wondered why they started with a pallet cleanse in the first place. 

Now if you're still with me I'll get to the finally. The bad Server in the bad location with the bad food brought us our bill. After pre-paying $90 for our dinner he presented us with a bill for just under $120!!! This covered one beer, one glass of riesling wine, one crabcake, tap water, and ...get this, tax and a $50 tip!

I'm very happy I went to RM seafood. Having already done a tasting menu this week, I instead went with a la carte options off of what is a very small a la carte menu, but I think with good options.

At the waiter's recommendation, I went with the charred octopus over a sushi roll. And it was good, but not great. I find myself wondering about the sushi. The octopus was super tender, and I like the charred outside, plus it was served with good accompaniments? Thinly sliced chorizo, mild olives and nasturtium leaves? Probably the first time I've eaten nasturtium leaves. Plus the smoky chorizo and slightly bitter olives tasted great with the octopus. All of this was on top of a bed of pepperonata, which I thought was a little strongly flavored. There's something about this that doesn't make me jump out of my seat though. It was good, like I said, but I would try something else next time.

But it was all OK when the diver scallops arrived. I can't remember having any scallops this good anywhere else, so I'm just going to call a spade a spade - probably the best I have ever had. Seared perfectly. Prepared to the perfect done-ness. And all the stuff with them worked in perfect harmony. Tiny cubes of slightly softened Asian pear, a little bit of applesauce (or maybe pear sauce) around the plate, super tender, meaty, rich pork belly, a drizzle of pork jus over the scallops, a dusting of sea salt, and a very lightly dressed frisee salad. This dish is 5 stars. Maybe 6. The savory pork and the sweet fruits went so well with the flavorful salty scallops...oh, man. Sooooo good. 

Dessert was the ""Irish coffee"" - ice cream, flourless chocolate cake, mint foam (yesssssss, we got some foam!), baileys, and almond biscotti. I got this over the ricotta fritters (which sounded better to me, but had more pear in them. After having pear and apple in the scallops, I didn't want t double up on that flavor. I kind of wish I had...the dessert was just ordinary. The biscotti were at least good with my espresso.

So, why 4 stars after those scallops? The meal was bookended by less than 5 star items. I'd say the octopus is a weakish 4, and the dessert is a 3. So I would tell you to go and get a double order of the scallops and have them blow your mind. Or maybe try other appetizers and desserts.

5752959,2010-09-15,5,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"First off, I'm a fan of Rick Moonen from watching Top Chef Masters. His jovial personality, competitive nature, and love for seafood had me rooting for him on a weekly basis. I admit, I had no idea who he was before, and strolled by his restaurant in Mandalay Bay on numerous ocassions without even a clue that the RM stood for his initials. Thanks to television, ""celebrity"" chefs have gained more exposure, which likely equates to more business for their restaurants.

So I was excited. I love seafood. I wanted a nice meal with my wife to celebrate a special ocassion. I wouldn't say my expectations were through the roof, but when you're paying top dollar to dine at a nicely decorated restaurant inside in a large Vegas hotel on the Strip, you expect things to go rather smoothly. Celebrity chef or not.

We arrived for lunch, and were seated right way downstairs. There were 3, maybe 4 other occupied tables in an otherwise empty room. We sat next to all the framed awards and accolades hanging on the wall, proclaiming best seafood in Vegas. After waiting for a bit, the waiter approached us, was friendly, and took down our orders. But, it was all downhhill from there.

We ordered the clam chowder ($9) and crab cake ($16) for appetizers, lobster roll ($27), and the fish tacos ($17). The apps actually arrived very quickly, so you can't help but wonder. We shrugged and dove right in. I'm not kidding when I say this, the clam chowder was probably the worst I've ever had in my life. I'm a huge fan of clam chowder, having tried it from all over the country. This chowder was extremely watered down, lukewarm in temperature, and had a very strong ""chalky"" flavor to it. I didn't taste much of any clams, probably discovered about 5 little rubbery pieces of clam, and overall just felt like I had slurped down a bowl of seafood milk. Even Boudin makes better chowdah.

The crab cake was bland and not seasoned very well. It consisted of nice chunks of lump crab (versus the stringy, over-mixed crab cakes that many restaurants have), so that was the only good thing. After we were done with these 2 dishes, we waited for what seemed like an eternity for other main entrees to arrive.

Waiting for food is understandable in a busy restaurant, but when it's pretty much dead? Inconceivable. We inquired about our food, and they said they were barely getting started on it. We decided to 86 the lobster roll and stick with the fish tacos. When the fish tacos arrived, I almost laughed. It looked like double-decker tacos from Taco Bell (see picture). Instead of large chunks of halibut, the fish meat was minced up and served within the taco shell. It had some nice flavor and a slight kick, by far the most decent dish, which isn't saying much.

At this point, we just wanted to leave, ASAP. When we saw our check, they overcharged us. The bill said there was a ""sharing"" fee, which was laughable. The waiter said we were charged dinner prices, then mentioned it was his 3rd day working there or something. Wow. I saw the manager in his beige suit give him a quiet tongue lashing quite a times, but never apologized directly to us. $50 out the window for mediocre food and medicre service. Rick Moonen, I'm sure you're a good chef, but either that was an ""off"" day, or your restaurant needs some serious help.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,7,3,1,B200P0oejWhDgHZEoDNIQw

when they finally did break up the bill; they added gratuity - which is fine because it was a group of 12 so i was completely fine with that; EXCEPT for the fact that it was more than 25% that was added as gratuity - now i would have tipped at least 20% even with the disappointing events that took place but to place more than 25% on a check without even an explanation is i think less than expected.

The upstairs is a lot more upscale and fine dining, while the downstairs is more casual but still classy.  

They have different menus, but we chose downstairs since it was just my buddy and me and the menu looked more our style anyway.

My friend had seen Rick Moonen on Top Chef so he suggested eating here after looking around the other restaurants nearby.  

The hostess was on the phone and made us wait.  She seemed to give us attitude too instead of apologizing (not that we complained either), but besides her, service was excellent.  The waiter knew the menu well and went through the specials which sounded impressive, he also made some excellent recommendations on the menu.  We ended up ordering the small seafood sampler, which had 6 oysters, a half lobster tail, mussels, shrimp, clams, and the special escabeche.  It was really good!  For our main course I got the red snapper and we ordered the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes cost $7 and I remember thinking what can they do to mashed potatoes that would make them worth $7?

It's a huge place, with the bar & separate dining area downstairs and a lounge & more formal dining upstairs.  We have heard good things about the fine dining upstairs & will try it soon.  

We all had the special restaurant week three course menu with an extra appetizer.  We started with the ahi tuna duo - tuna tartare & lightly seared tuna.  The tuna was very fresh and delicious.  Our friends enjoyed the jumbo lump crab cake - looked like all crab & no filler.  Next up was a shrimp salad or clam chowder, both were very good.  Main course was choice of salmon or scallops.  My wife & I had the salmon - slow cooked with a nice lime butter sauce.  Our friends had the scallops, which I got to try.  Scallops were properly cooked with a nice sear.  Desserts were strawberry cream puffs or chocolate carmel mousse.  I didn't try the cream puffs but the chocolate mousse was fantastic.

Well fast forward to July, 2010 and Rick Moonen is like a celebrity now after being featured on Bravo's Top Chef series... RM has significantly become more popular and of course prices have risen and it's a lot more packed with dining patrons... I did not let this deter me and I went ahead and finally had the chance to enjoy a nice lunch here while visiting Vegas over the holiday
 weekend...
I treated myself to the grilled prawn risotto and seafood enbache... My GF had Chef Moonen's signature Fish Tacos.. Everything 
was executed perfectly and all of the seafood 
ingredients tasted extremely fresh... The wait
 staff were well versed with the menu and made our dining experience wonderful... My 
only complaint was that one of the waiters seemed overly attentive to the ""couple"" that were sitting a couple tables next to us...
 Almost  like he was permanently hovering over them... I was like dude you work in Vegas you mean to tell me you have never seen two girls kiss.. I almost felt embarrassed for the guy because his excitement was so obvious and they weren't even HOT!!! 
Everything else was perfect.. The restaurant is gorgeous and has a nice tranquil  underwater feel in the entry way... I hear the upstairs portion of the restaurant  which is reserved for dinner  and folks trying the prix fixe  menu is quite nice and upscale.. I will have to definitely make reservations for that  on a future visit...

5821054,2013-05-20,0,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"My boyfriend and I dined in the downstairs dining room on Saturday, May 18th 2013; we had reservations via Open Table and as soon as we arrived we were seated immediately by the smiling hostess. 

It took a little bit of time for the server, Clifton, to greet us (and they weren't particularly busy) however he was pleasant. I ordered a bottle of the Two Hands Moscato ($54) which was recommended to me by Clifton and it was so delightfully good! I was a smidge disappointed that it didn't come out as cold as I would've liked, it could have been chilled down another 10*, but I still drank the whole dang bottle by myself, ssssssh ;) And he put it on ice for me so the next glass was even better. The busser brought out a complimentary bread basket which consisted of corn bread muffins and cheddar biscuits (very similar to Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay biscuits) plus whipped butter, all of which were tasty. 

We started with the Clam Chowder soup. It was warm and full of flavor & veggies. There was a strong beer/hops undertone that I didn't particularly care for but my boyfriend loved it...especially all those little oyster crackers he threw on top! Personally, for $15 I would pass it up the next time we're there.

We then ordered our entrees: Surf and Turf for me (9oz prime filet mignon in a red wine jus and a 1/2 lobster w/clarified butter) which was garnished with micro-greens. The menu online stated that the entree came with mashed potatoes but for some reason my entree never came out with any. You'd think for $89.00 I would get some type of side. The filet came out horribly black and charred which I made them take back. Besides that, my new steak melted in my mouth like butter, the lobster was ridiculously delicious and the red wine jus was a perfect complement to the steak. In addition we ordered Old Bay fries w/remoulade ($7), which were like shoestring fries, as well as the mac 'n cheese for two ($14). The mac 'n cheese was in a white cheddar cream base and it was to die for. My boyfriend ordered the King Salmon ($34) which was about 8oz in size and it was garnished in different citrus elements which he said was a wonderful flavor compliment to the fish.  

After all of that we ordered dessert: the dessert sampler platter for him ($18) which included White Chocolate Bread Pudding w/a blueberry compote and blueberry buttermilk ice cream, an Irish Chocolate Tart with Guinness gingerbread ice cream, the Fat Elvis w/passion fruit caramel sauce and their Key Lime Pie w/cilantro syrup. My boyfriend raved about all of them. I ordered the 16 piece ice cream and sorbet sampler ($18) and was less than impressed. The chocolate ice cream was bitter however I did enjoy the salted caramel ice cream.

My suggestion: beware of the menu posted on the Mandalay Bay website as it's severely out of date, including what's featured on the menu and the prices. They have all gone up!",Z6sMdVaYrFoAOL-Kbc7b3Q,3,0,3,tbkMognzjaYMnx5bWdVj3g

Those like myself will set the standards higher for the chef that dons this celebrity status. My ladies and I opted for the prix-fixe option that included 3 courses (app, entree, dessert) for $55 which is quite a good deal in relation to the typical Vegas dining prices. 
 
The Good: 
- Oysters - perfect albeit pricey at $3.75 each
- The mini biscuits
- Clam Chowder was absolutely delicious. Smokey bacon with the herbs providing a nice beginning and end to each spoonful.
- RM's interpretation of Cioppino provided a fresh mix of seafood, pasta and a slightly spicy sauce that was very enjoyable
- Rocky Road Pudding is surprisingly light

The Bad: 
- 30 minute wait time between appetizers & entree
- Spicy crab roll was anything but spicy
- Pasta in Cioppino was dry like it was sitting out too long
- Too much going on in that Fat Elvis dessert. My teeth had to fight through a thick layer of powdered sugar, then through the hard ""egg roll"" wrapper before I got to the mess of bacon, chocolate & banana

The Strange: 
- I ordered the cherry cocktail with pop rocks on the side and had no idea what to do with it. It provided more nostalgia rather than any benefit to the taste. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg?userid=bmiAy-CdzxWPi3Yr_fljHw

Overall the food didn't excite me nor deemed worthy of the prices charged. Although I've had enough of Vegas for the next 10 years, when I do return I'd try items on the regular menu or perhaps at the upstairs counterpart which may be a better representation of Rick Moonen's cooking.

5837342,2012-04-15,6,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"I had a mixed but very good overall experience downstairs at RM Seafood in Mandalay Place during Restaurant Week.  My Rainbow Roll with a hint of lemon was excellent fresh sushi, and the cornbread that followed was very good.  A Jumbo Lump Crab Cake with fresh Blue Crab, Carrot Salad & Chipotle Aioli was very good, featuring a fair amount of crab--not just filling--and refreshing thin cucumber slices mixed with carrot shavings.  I also enjoyed Rick's White Clam Chowder, which featured a generous amount of quite visible Top Neck Clams, potatoes, and bacon, and was chock full of celery and carrot.  The hot, off-white, and milky soup was interesting and very good.

But then some problems began to emerge.  One of my dining companions sent back his entree of Divers Scallops, complaining that they were almost ice cold and contained a bit of sand.  When the second batch arrived, he found them to be warm but still not hot, yet ate them this time.  Meanwhile I noted that my sauteed Pacific Halibut, presented with Fennel Silk, Shaved Apple, and Citrus Ragu', was warm rather than hot.  It was tasty, but half of this entree was soft and moist, and the other half was crisp and dry.  A somewhat unusual outcome! 

A dessert course of Key Lime Pie made with Swiss Meringue, and presented with sweet Cilantro Syrup, was very good tasting but not as cold as I believe Key Lime Pie should ideally be.  The meringue kisses that topped the large slice were quite nice, and the graham cracker crust perfectly baked.  The few drops of Cilantro Syrup were a nice complement to this dish applied in moderation. as an accent.  I detected just a slight flavor of cilantro, I believe mainly because I knew it would be there.  But the syrup tasted much more like an intense sweetener, and left no impression of a pureed leafy vegetable being placed on my tongue.

Seating in leather booths was very comfortable, and service was generally good, but somewhat mixed.  At times Iced Tea refills were delivered without request, and at other times I had to ask for them.  I saw Chef/Owner Rick Moonen inside the restaurant engaged in conversation with two men at the bar, but never got to speak with him.  It is nice to know that he is a ""hands on"" chef.  And, after the scallops exchange, a manager came over to apologize for the problem, took the item off the bill, and gave my friend a 25% off card for a future meal at the restaurant.

The sign outside RM seafood looked enticing, so we decided to give it a try. First red flag should have been that the inside menu did not match the wording of the outside menu.. Hello.. marketing basics..

Drinks - If I recall correctly, they were half off - so about $7. Had a Lavender Hibiscus Margarita and what sounded like a unique concoction of peppers, cachaca and pear.. Drinks took about 15 minutes to arrive and the latter of the above two was just slightly more than half full... hmmmm. The bartender (in clear view from our table) had visible difficulty making these signature drinks and continually over poured into the jigger (then repoured the excess back into the bottles??!). OK, fine, they are discounted, so we will take it.

Food - the happy hour claim is 50% off selected sushi. I understand selected is just that, but all it included was a spicy tuna cut or hand roll or salmon cut or hand roll... THAT'S IT! Opted for a spicy tuna cut roll for a quick nibble and at $6.50 decently priced (that is after the 1/2 off). Sushi arrived ... No soy sauce, no server.... Taste - I've had better at fast-casual sushi/Japanese outlets.. 

Overall - it was a quick bite and inexpensive, but NO VALUE. Realizing after the fact that HOB and Hussong's both had HH, I would have opted for either of those over RM Seafood had I known this was the experience to be had...",4w1Qbp-21HP6MgkMSzXk7g,1,0,2,3D_sW4SKkM-EvsGangf87A

Apps:
Moondoogies: Essentially it's a corn dog but with shrimp and about 7x the price. From what I heard, these were created during an episode of TopChef. They were tasty and just right with the sauce served. 

Soup:
Green Garlic Soup with Dungeoness Crab: The garlic was not to powerful as to dominate the taste of the soup, but just right. Unfortunately, the taste of crab seemed to be lost. 

Entree: 
Fish&Chips: Yes.... I went to a high end seafood restaurant and ordered fish and chips.... Sue me. However, there is reason behind my madness. Generally I judge a restaurants food by the quality of their fish and chips. Now take a moment to think about it. If they take the time to prepare fish and chips properly (which normally most restaurants do not), the rest of the food should be superb. 

Needless to say, our fish and chips was nothing short of fantastic! It was by far the best fish and chips I have had at a high end dining establishment. From what my friends said, their meals were nothing short of amazing also.

5883995,2010-09-12,1,LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg,"I really had great expectation for RM seafood with Rick Moonen being on Top Chef and being so passionate about his food but left with pure disappointment and here is why....

Although I made reservation for lunch; when we got there, the restaurant was practically empty so we were seated right away. On the reservation, I stated we are celebrating our anniversary and hubby's birthday but the hostess didn't bother looking at the reservation and acknowledge our celebration like other restaurants did.

Anyway...we didn't have breakfast so I did a quick glance of the menu and was ready to order. We ordered the crab cake $16), clam chowder ($9), lobster roll ($27) and the fish tacos ($17).

The crab cake just came by it self with some aioli sauce which I thought for $16 bucks, we should have gotten two. It was a medium size crab cake with chunks of crab but who puts pineapple in their crab cakes? I sure don't. I thought the crab cake was bland. I was hoping really bold flavors, at least with a slight kick.

On came the clam chowder which should have been called bacon chowder since their were more bacon bits than clams. The consistency was watery like soup rather than a chowder. The flavor certainly wasn't the taste of the oceanic clams, it was bacon and dairy (milk and creamy) and left that dairy after taste like I just had a cup of milk which I don't like.

After the chowder, it seems like we were done because we waited for about 15 minutes and our entrees have not arrived yet. We waited patiently..mind you again, the restaurant wasn't busy..about only five tables were filled. The waiter finally comes over and asked if we received our entrees yet, and when we said no, he went to check and mentioned they messed up on the orders. At that point, hubby and I was already talking about canceling the rest of our orders and eating at Burger Bar. Unfortunately, when I asked if our orders were being made, hubby's fish was already on the fire so we left it at that but mine wasn't even made yet, so I was able to cancel it. Hubby's fish taco finally came and he enjoyed it but not worth $17.

When the bill came, he forgot to take out the lobster roll, so he had to go correct it. Once the initial corrected bill arrived, I noticed there were extra charges thinking there was a sharing charge but it didn't make sense; so I informed the waiter...he realized he charged us the dinner prices! Then he tells us this is his third day...OH MY.....The Manager was there at all times in his fancy suit but never even came over to apologize or anything.

I really don't mind paying more for good food, but paying so much for the quality and service I experienced here was just a letdown especially since it is known as an upscale restaurant. Since Chef Moonen wasn't there, the review is not against him because he seems like a great guy but perhaps, his Chefs needs a little more training on what quality food should taste like and how it is done.",bIhhH7SURXRZzI4RVOG91g,4,2,1,FSA_2OQ62pZsT-Ka1WOjHA

I've stayed in the Mandalay Bay countless times and I've always walked passed Rick Moonen's RM Seafood on the way to the Mandalay Place shops. I had high hopes for RM Seafood after seeing Rick Moonen compete on Top Chef Masters, but my experience was slightly less stellar.

Be aware there is an upstairs restaurant and an downstairs restaurant. They both have different menus, where the upstairs has the the upscale tasting menu and the downstairs is a more casual dining experience. I still felt the downstairs restaurant had the price tag of pricey restaurant though.

Before our meal even started I was slightly turned off when my waiter took my order. I had a good idea that I wanted to try the seafood items since I knew Rick's specialty was in seafood. For some reason our waiter relentlessly tried to upsell me on getting the steak, lobster, or surf and turf, which were of course the more expensive items on the item. It didn't stop there when he proceed to badger me if I wanted any alcohol with my meal. After denying him multiple times I was finally able to get in my order for the Steamed Mussels and the Diver Scallops. 

The bowl of Steamed Mussels was huge! If only it tasted as good as its portions, I would've enjoyed this appetizer. The mussels were cooked in white wine, garlic, and parsley that created a light broth sitting underneath the mussels. It was accompanied with two garlic bread sticks. The mussels were very fishy and the broth lacked flavor. I was hoping the broth would help cover up the heavy sea-tasting mussels, but it didn't help. I was ready to put my fork down by the time I finished half the bowl because of the fishy taste. I've had better tasting mussels in the past.

Next came the main dish of Diver Scallops. There were 4 huge scallops accompanied with a pull pork, cornbread, and jalapeno chile rellano. The food was topped off with some mole sauce. I will say the best thing on the plate was not the seafood. I actually really enjoyed the chile rellano. It had the perfect amount of heat and the pull pork filling was smooth and delicious. The scallops were a big disappointment. Although they were tender, they were way too salty for my taste buds.

I think my dining experience couldn't been more pleasant at RM Seafood. Perhaps if I ordered different items on the menu or didn't have such a pushy waiter things would have been better.",6Ct6xwJt7AJD9amnMkNckA,5,2,2,zWKVPMhUWtRKXQ_BjeUgSw

We had a party of 6, so naturally we had a lot of fun exploring the menu. We started with the calamari and small shellfish sampler (the entire party had not yet arrived) as recommended by our waiter. When the rest of the party had arrived we ordered the following: king salmon, sturgeon, diver scallops, barramundi, surf and turf, one of the premium cut sushi rolls, and a few orders of asparagus and fries for the table. I must say everything was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The portions were generous but not overwhelming. 

What must have been my favorite part of the whole dinner was dessert. They brought me a birthday dessert, Irish Chocolate Tart, very rich and tasty.  We also ordered the Rick's Tasting Game, 16 different flavors of ice cream that you taste and try to guess the flavors. Hands down the best idea ever! They bring you a paper to fill in your guesses that coordinates with the sampler and spoons for everyone.

Our server arrived quickly to take our drink orders. We started with a California roll which was pretty average. We both chose the grilled octopus ($10 upcharge) for our first course and the catch of the day which was described to us as Grouper. 

The grilled octopus was excellent. It was served with fingerling potatoes, tomatoes and small house made chips on top of a wonderful meyer lemon aioli. I thought it was a good amount of octopus and well worth the $10 up charge. 

Our grouper arrived a while later and it was a beautiful presentation. The grouper was served with sweet potato gnocchi and charred leaks. The fish was cooked perfectly, very moist and the gnocchi were also excellent. The only complaint was that the grouper had a chipotle rubbed crust which was extremely spicy. We both wish that had been explained when being described. 

For dessert we chose the key lime ""pie"". This was a total failure. It was a small serving of something that resembled a pie but tasted stale or old. The meringue on top was terrible, like melted rubber. Was the pastry chef off today? Can't believe they would be happy serving that. 

Overall it was a great lunch and not a bad deal for $38 each. With wine and a tip it was just over $200. Now for my big gripe. We were charged $7 to park in the Mandalay Bay garage. As locals we have all become accustomed to free parking on the strip. The manager at RM said there was nothing he could do. 

Is it fair to charge me $7 to park after a $200 lunch? Not in my opinion. Why cant parking be validated for those eating at a restaurant or seeing a show at the property?

The meal was quite good so I'm disappointed to read about so many negative reviews. The lobster claw is one of the biggest I've ever seen,. Must've been a mutant lobster. 
Service was very attentive and the staff did their best to accommodate requests.

The food is spectacular but very pricey, our dinner with one drink each, 2 appetizers  and 2 entrees was $260.  I just felt like it would have been a better experience if there was a better vibe in the place...

When I look back at the meals I've had there it has been hit or miss on every occasion. Inconsistency is the key word at RM. On this most recent occasion, we had a Groupon we came to redeem. My fella had never been here before so he was looking forward to trying them out. 

We started with some cocktails and their bread basket. The bread is nothing spectacular, although it is tasty and filling. I decided to order the diver scallops, while my fella settled on the surf & surf, which is lobster and prawns over orzo pasta. We also shared some broccolini. I was very fond of my fella's meal. He definitely won the ordering challenge for the evening. The prawns were enormous and meaty and the lobster was tasty as well. I liked how the orzo balanced out the dish and added perfect contrast. On the other hand, I wasn't as enamored with my scallops as I was the surf & surf. Not as substantial and not as tasty. Overall, we had a good experience, but that's not always the case.

I know the seafood is sustainable, but the rolls were pretty basic. The tables also seemed small and both my husband and I knocked over our glasses. Thankfully his was empty, but I had a full cocktail. The staff was slow but friendly.

Green Eggs and Ham (egg, ham, asparagus 3 ways)
Chocolate Car Bomb (chocolate several ways, ice cream, guiness foam)

Sure, take Rick Moonen's cuisine and price it at regular prices and put it in a ""normal"" city and you would have a decent restaurant.  But for Vegas, wah wah wah.  The restaurant was nice but felt like upscale-Vegas-buffet seating on the lower level.  597,000 servers must have rushed by our table and there was hardly any room for them to even put their large trays of food down on a tray-jack so they could serve their tables.  Our server was cold and very business-like, but also very efficient in his own way.  The diversity and the politeness of the staff was the best thing about them.  
    (oh! Its okay to charge for water at an upscale restaurant but this is not the type of place I would expect that from....but it happened without a word of warning.  Not cool.)

Food time!!!
     1st up: 
                 White Clam Chowder:  Fantastic except it was missing the clam/seafood taste!!  All I was getting was bacon and dill which still made for a fantastic creamy soup. 

    Entrees:  
                 Lobster Bolognese:  Loved the thickness of the noodles and the size of the dish.  
            Didn't love the slight ""black licorice"" flavor (over-did it on 
            (the anise oil?)  Decent dish but wouldn't order again. 


                 Grilled Shrimp:  Loved the color of the dish.  Loved the texture of the Saffron Risotto and the creaminess of it as well. 
            Didn't love the lemony taste of the shrimp.  Should have kept the shrimp simple and/or gone for the ""grilled taste.""

After all of that resentment towards the food and the server, I just couldn't stick around for dessert so that was all she wrote!  I'm sure there are ways to experience this restaurant in a better view (maybe ordering sushi?), I just didn't hit it right on the first try.",PjoSwmHj3QL5U5lDtjM3KA,1,0,3,y4xICznNFtGYE_Xzzzvxdw
