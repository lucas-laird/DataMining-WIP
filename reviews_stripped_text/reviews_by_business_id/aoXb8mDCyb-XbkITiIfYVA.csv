Before heading to Sbarro, which is located in a basement food court of Bally's Hotel, ask yourself? Am I hungover? Do I need this food so I don't die? Unless you have answered yes to either of these questions, do not proceed to eat at Sbarro.

There's a reason these places are only in food courts. Because nobody with transportation (car, bike, train, jet pack) would actually stop here. And there's a reason they have gone bankrupt twice - the food is bland and overpriced.

Seriously, two slices of pizza for like $10 and a Gatorade for $3.50? I can get two pizzas and two gallons of Gatorade from Little Caesars for that much.

Pass on the Sbarro and pass on this entire food court. It is not worth your time.",ZakXMnPmK6GESBS-zC_eAg,2,1,2,4aLBiiUhcax-EKC0r-ogVg

A pizza slice, a salad and/or a beer.  See how simple that is.  Never go here for the pasta...it looks so gross and it is sitting in sauce and under hot lights all day long.  Just walk away because it is not going to be good.  Do not let the girl talk you into upgrading for a few bucks more...you really do not need those extra sides.

The staff here is always nice unless the manager is here making them nervous.  Bosses make everything harder.

$4.95 a slice from Sbarro is ridiculous, but the size sort of makes up for it. The pizza toppings vary throughout the day, but you're most likely to find ""the usual"" (pepperoni, sausage, or cheese), veggie slices, and a pepperoni and sausage combination. Don't forget to ask them if they could heat it up for you. If pizza isn't your thing, there is pasta (i.e., baked ziti) and stromboli. The pepperoni and cheese stromboli was a bit dry and underwhelming; the dough was the perfect thickness and golden brown. If neither of those appeal to you, there are side salads available among other sides you could choose from.

If I were you, don't even bother with the overpriced drinks here. Just head to the CVS a few yards away from the hotel's entrance and save yourself a buck or two.
