I started with one Carne Asada Taco and had to order a second. They have a very good salsa bar as well. The salsa verde had a nice smokey flavor and was one of the best I have tasted.,5UO0UUyWL9v7FnKi4LR7QA,1,0,5,cXztCRy_7zEYnRX0BCLgIQ

The positive: 
The counter guy was nice enough and the dining room was clean and they DO cook in front of you.

I'm really not sure I could bring myself to go back in there. The food just kind of made me mad. It could be so much better.",qnoXQsDOTOFwJEYXSCnHEQ,0,0,1,Rju4RRNNEryelplo0LU_eA

The burrito I had was good-just not what I was looking for.",FhkZk24n_Dh-pVLpBKUwEw,3,1,3,rBxZozwSOVeThZvhT39uWA
