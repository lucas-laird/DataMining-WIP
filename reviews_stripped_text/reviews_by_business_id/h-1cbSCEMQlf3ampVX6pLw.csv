I use to come to your establishment at least every other day for a drink. If the drive through has eight cars in line and I am still waiting after the 10th car goes through the line this to me is an issue with the way your business is run. Managers/owners need to get out from behind the counter/desk and come outside to help! After 8 years of coming to this establishment I will not be back.

The food quality doesnt suffer even if the drive thru line is long and they are knocking out the cars. I prefer the Onion RIngs over the fries. Though there fries are still good. But the Onion rings are a little crispy but still soft and come out piping hot and greasy. Not all dry and burnt like some onion rings at a other establishment who will remain nameless. There is a Mcdonalds on the other corner but come on its a No Brainer where to go, when you want Scrumptous sandwiches. Delicious Desserts. Onion rings that will make you googley eyed. Drinks deserving of a king. And they are open late and i love the happy hour menu.",A2N4y0VeZ-3TtmBVCSVVnQ,0,0,5,VroEbK8peIPCRv4-h6_4gQ
5680890,2007-05-18,2,h-1cbSCEMQlf3ampVX6pLw,My cousin who lives in Vegas has it made. He bought a HUGE house with a pool for PEANUTS and he has a SONIC burger right down the street from him. WTF! I love their burgers and specialty drinks. It's so easy to get fat with all the great breakfast and lunch selections they have. Wish they opened more Sonic joints in SoCal. Heard they got one in Anaheim. But how often do I go to Anaheim? I love how you order your food at this place. It's like buying gas and they bring the food to your car. Pretty cool. There used to be drive-ins in SoCal (like A&W) but they've all gone.,cHpXABKFJ9oWZwE4IK-Z8Q,2,1,5,H92XUpdKsdVMbc6Jz77dOQ

There was a long wait after ordering through the drive thru; the customer in front of me actually drove out of it and left their order.  When I got to the window, I was asked if I wanted I cup holder for my 5 drinks, but then told ""but we are out of the ones that hold 4, we only have the ones that hold 2 drinks.""  That would not be much help for 5 drinks.  I had to ask for condiments because they were not offered.  We ordered a total of 5 meals, all with fries or tots; upon asking for ketchup, the cashier asked me if 3 would be enough.  How would 3 packets of ketchup be enough for all of the orders?  An even worse disappointment was getting home and and finding out that I was an order of fries.",26SE5Kfqh2669tKw3MHptA,0,0,2,88xVtlS7aOUQLsR-vYdItA

This time with some boneless buffalo wings (:  i absolutely love sonic it was just weird that this time, my friend and i weren't able to do separate transactions when we were able to a couple weeks ago.

Update: Just got home and took a bite out of my Coney dog and to my disappointment the onions i asked for weren't there. I'm still leaving the 4 stars though because the food is still really great. Just wish my onions were there. Oh well.",keoO9_fGQ5KBIcfJvX2ddw,0,0,4,HNUjD5P0JMML_zbMMJs37w
