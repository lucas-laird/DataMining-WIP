2952959,2018-05-08,0,2Q9Mgkc7iFHuKoD_z7kJkQ,"I like the chamango at Lokuras because there's a generous amount of mango fruit throughout the slushie. The mango was diced on the smaller side, and the chamoy stick and flavoring had a good sweet-sour-savoriness to it.  However, if you don't like mostly crunchy, unripe mango pieces mixed with a few sweeter, ripe ones, then you may want to order something else on their menu. The size of the chamango cup was smaller than I expected for the price too. 

The girls at the counter seemed nice enough, but don't expect them to rush to serve you. When I was there, they were chatting amongst themselves, and even though it wasn't busy, it took awhile before they acknowledged my presence (maybe you need to speak Spanish to be more quickly attended to?). It also didn't feel like there was any air conditioning in the shop, and it was nearly 100F degrees outside! 

4 stars for the refreshing chamango itself, but minus 1 star for the overall experience. If I'm in the area, I could probably stop by again, but I think there are other places where I can get comparable chamango for a better price, friendlier customer service, and functioning A/C.",1o8vB0WKHfV7omrYWB_OLg,0,0,4,8q3gUfD1-2tqyhh6zkHFOA

My buddy ended up getting what's called the pepinos lokos, which literally translates into ""crazy cucumbers."" It's cucumbers stuffed with Chaka Chaka and Japanese peanuts, and it's drizzled with chamoy and tamarind and some squeezed lime. I tried some of it, and it was freakin intense! If you have sensitive and weak teeth, this item might not be appropriate for you. My buddy also said that pepinos lokos are a very popular snack in Mexico.

I got a mango that was sliced into the shape of a rose topped with chamoy and tamarind, and it's pretty much a chamango served on a stick. It was really tasty and aesthetically pleasing! I also tried their Horchato, and it was one of the better ones I've had, with strong accents of cinnamon.

Lokuras is relatively close to my house, and I was excited to see what it was all about. There are a few seats for dining in, but you can also get food to go. I spent a while perusing the menu unsure of what to order, as most items were unfamiliar to me. I ended up ordering chamango since it seemed to be one of their most popular desserts, plus several other Yelpers have mentioned it in their reviews.

The employees were all very friendly and smiley, which is always a plus. The dessert was a little bit pricey (greater than $7 for my choice), though it did come with a lot of mango.

Basically, chamango was diced fresh mango mixed with mango slushie plus spicy tamarind chewy candies and a tamarind straw. It was interesting, though I must admit that I have never been the biggest tamarind fan, and I also don't love the sweet spicy combo that results from that spicy red powder used in many Mexican sweets. I knew this when I ordered, but still wanted to try out chamango.

There are a lot of desserts (and even some savory snacks) at Lokuras though, so I would love to come back and try something else off the menu! =)",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,2,2,4,nuXbscNQNvaQGFpAM3iBIA

5386298,2018-05-30,1,2Q9Mgkc7iFHuKoD_z7kJkQ,"Aye, I really love this place. To eat most of the food here though, you have to have an acquired taste for it, otherwise, you may not enjoy it so much. So if you do, I would recommend the esquite or elotes, it is one of the best I've had, the chamango is amazing, and the banana split is tasty and large, so it is great to share with someone. Overall it's delicioso! I can't wait to try everything else on the menu.",LpvLLwebARJ02L8jgEhoVg,1,1,5,INXisSZMvfQB4gIyluDbMw
5451600,2016-10-12,0,2Q9Mgkc7iFHuKoD_z7kJkQ,Been to Lokuras a couple of times since they opened. I've had a couple of the items on the menu and everything has been absolutely amazing. They have authentic Mexican snacks and such a vast variety. I highly recommend the chamangos as well as the esquites. Everything is freshly made and very clean. The owner had recommended to me the house made raspados which were absolutely amazing. I highly recommend to anyone wanting to try something new and delicious.,2pKWeKw20OaZ8SkAIItzHw,0,0,5,X1CoUUeSt3N5bvvsnD_glQ

They had a wide selection of in house sherbets and ice creams. The chamango was fresh, cold, and refreshing! I'm looking forward to trying different things from the menu the next time I'm in.",q8rjyleuk_jimFj9SoAm4g,0,0,5,gLZIrxQ5iy4se-QIlTmX1g
