Has the shrimp cocktail and finished it to the very end not even juice left. Ate the torta and was finger licking goodness!! Had even the caesar salad no piece of lettuce left behind along with the great flavor.  Btw, this wasnt all in one sitting. Each plate has inticed me to keep coming back and keep trying their menu.  They have a little bit of something for everybody. Can't wait to try the next dish. Thank you Cilantros!!",NSx-IolCzhDyaBNCyY9dBQ,3,0,5,hXsnsEBe24R9WhETa7Z2ug

4970328,2013-09-11,0,sSbhLkw1B58zLeUtv5lpaQ,Amazingly good Mexican food!  I had the shrimp cocktail and the Asada burrito. The shrimp cocktail was extremely fresh tasting for the being in the desert. The Asada burrito was fantastic. Some of the best marinated steak I've had in a Mexican restaurant.  I'm pretty sure the owner is cooking the food so that's always a plus.  Clean bathrooms and dining area. Yummy food!  Will be back.,fIM5z8nnpLWWBdGPQ4FNfA,4,3,5,i0P99JP7bjt-8GjIOTvbUg
