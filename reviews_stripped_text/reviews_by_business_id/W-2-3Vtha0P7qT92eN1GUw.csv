The two people with me got iced coffees both thought they were good but nothing out of the ordinary. Didn't get any food but they had a case with salads and stuff that looked good.,sNVpZLDSlCudlXLsnJpg7A,1,0,4,5HeBc8ox-QY5wYLcSYDVVg

This is one of the few places that had not gone into the horrible coffee Starbucks offers. I do enjoy espressemente . Lavazza and illy's are great authentic Italian coffee sad to see that I will have to go to other casinos. The Venetian is not what it use to be, it use to make me feel like i was in Italy even though I was in Vegas for a convention. I guess Mr. Adelson is losing his vision he once had for his casino.",5YOLWOmsjqmtb2RHtHxlvA,1,0,1,SJ73bEOZ3fLlM5byF041Cw
4954996,2017-04-14,0,W-2-3Vtha0P7qT92eN1GUw,This coffee spot is located on the canal shoppes level right outside the elevators at the palazzo.  A lot less crowded than coffee bean on the casino level.  They serve LaVazza Italian coffee and it's awesome.  My iced mocha was off the chains.  They have sandwiches and pastries as well.  Serve was fast and friendly.  Will definitely pay them a visit again.,XIe4u72yFOufyrZyOcIPBQ,1,0,4,91NBnw7Vf-eFZpoF-ITbwQ

I came here 2 days in a row and the bad attitudes were consistent. Next time I stay at this hotel I will walk over to Starbucks and happily hand over my $6 for a large caramel iced coffee. At least I know I will have a pleasant experience and good coffee.",bXZHZS0NiEjm8tQGPyoz7Q,0,1,1,WOfbT6pQE6zCPFB8ymQeIA
