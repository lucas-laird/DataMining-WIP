I had a 6 inch sub combo which came with chips and a drink for $10.99.  The service was quick and the food was good.  Plus, I took photos.",wm97KC6G0resSDXTmNIMKw,0,0,3,M7p58E7VszsD7WQwT7ji1w

I have to disagree with the negative reviews.  If you want to see a ""bad"" subway, go to Florida.",lEL9E_wL0hQCyTt-bj5jLg,0,0,4,Y5YhkCb6t3PjfK9JGboP1Q

You tell me if thats worth it to you, this place is made to scam tourist to over price them. Its inside the four queens, small place, hope it closes down soon.",R9Acwreuq6Og28hq9dZp4w,0,0,1,ckXmVtJ34-7LB0ZV1r9J7A

Was the only person having a sandwich made while there were 2 people behind the counter. 
Had a simple sandwich, spoke clearly and calmly yet still there were problems. 
Never again.",qEohQTH5TFjQQiUlIWdIAQ,0,0,1,X-M5kCUse9brwf2w3_3dbg
3074606,2013-05-29,1,wFU96ah70juScw822O4Zpw,"Seems nobody is a fan, but I seldomly follow the crowd when it comes to places like a Subway being the worst or the best.You kind of have to go into these places and see for your self.They hire and fire new people all the time so I really think people should redo their reviews every so often not to smear their reputations.

Ill just speak in reference to the AM girl working there..forgot her name but she was Hispanic and fairly young.I was in line with a bunch of European tourist and she handled all of our orders in a timely fashion and did an excellent job!.

I just hated the fact that since this was in the downtown area they don't honor the $5 foot long sub.Subway is ok, but they aren't really  worth breaking the bank for IMO.",jTX1ys0y0Gw-K5zXpfuzBA,3,1,4,QdSUoZIbbmq137r1i-KFiA
5306098,2011-07-10,1,wFU96ah70juScw822O4Zpw,My friend got a tuna sandwich from here and after he ate it didn't feel so hot. Being wise and knowledgeable I knew better then to eat at this place. Sure glad I didnt have a sandwich. Fremont street sucks.,d7CK2tNS7mwwR-MlSjs23w,0,0,2,vGhgEAWVNvS1-PIz1kjWnw
