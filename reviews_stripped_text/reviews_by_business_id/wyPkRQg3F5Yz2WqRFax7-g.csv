anyway, these are the things we got: 

Philly cheese steak sliders
Had onions and red peppers. On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 6. I probably wouldn't order this again but it wasn't terrible. There were 3 on the plate but we each only ate one.

Nachos
 This came out first because we ordered these while still perusing the menu. they put some of their house chili, and salsa on it. Chips were really good, like they were just made.

Jalapeno burger (grilled jalapeno, spicy guac)
-i took a bite and it felt like instant heart burn. I didn't like the grilled jalapenos in them.

House chili (with japaleno corn bread and spicy sour cream)
I should've asked if there were beans in it. I really don't like beans. This bowl was huge. I think I had maybe a total of 5 spoonfuls. One, because of the numerous beans. two, because it was really spicy! three, the corn bread and the sour cream were really spicy! four, we ordered too much food.

Pear ginger fizz
This had pear puree, and some kind of domaine chandon bubbly in it. I asked for more pear because I'm a very light drinker. It came out a bit on the red side, and I barely tasted anything pear about it. Needless to say, I didn't finish it. And it lost the 'fizz' pretty fast too.

On August 11, 2013 at approximately 2:00 PM my friend and I sat down for lunch and a beer at the Munch Bar.  We ordered beer and burgers from the female server who was less than attentive.  The beers took 15 minutes, the restaurant was 1/3 full.  My $9:00 beer was served with a fly floating on the top of the foam.  

I brought it to the attention of the waitress and she agreed their was a fly in my beer.  She walked away without another word.  When she walked by again I told her I did not want another beer.  

She brought the burger for my friend and the bill without a word about the fly.  

The restaurant is casual and not expected to be high end.  However, for a restaurant and staff who represents the Ceasar's brand I was dissapointed a manager or at least the waitress did not offer an apology or comp the meal.  Not even an explanation.  

I should add our meals and service at Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill, The Old Homestead and Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill were fantastic. 

No fan of the Munch Bar.

Check your beer and food first.

The food, I ordered the grilled cheese sliders and it looked like a 6 year old made it. The cheese was all over the place, the bread was decent and the tomato dipping sauce was bland.

Naked Wings - pretty good, you can choose two dipping sauces which really make the wings (thai bbq sauce is pretty good)

Philly Cheesesteak Sliders - so-so, meat isn't that juicy, bun is good but lacks flavor would taste a lot better if they added mushrooms/onions to it.

Philly Cheese-steak Hoagie - the best tasting of everything we ordered, bread was real good

Chicken Sliders - these tasted decent but nothing special

Chile Cheese Steak Sandwich - horrible!

Sweet Potato Fries - really soggy and too sweet

My waitress was helpful in picking what to order. She was cool with how many items I picked to taste and she made sure to bring the food out in stages. The Cheese bites, Pizzadilla and lobster rolls were brought out first. The cheese bites are what you'd expect, very cheesy once you ""bite"" through the fried exterior. The Pizzadilla is a mix between a pizza and a quesadilla, which is an awesome concept that is well executed. Just the right amount of queso, cheese, and tasty pizza sauce has been added into this hybrid food item. The lobster rolls are presented nicely in a metal v holder. The rolls were nice and crunchy and the lobster was cold and mixed with some greens. The burger salad with crispy onion rings, Reuben Wrap and burger with onion rings with sweet potato fries were brought out. The burger salad was made with their standard burger patty folded in with a good salad and crispy onion rings on top. This is a good option for people that don't want to eat a bun with their burger. The Reuben Wrap was very large and you'll have a hard time finishing this after having an appetizer. The Reuben is everything you've come to enjoy from the sandwich, only in a wrap. The burger and sweet potato fries seems to be a rising trend in new burger places. This is a great idea. Sweet potato fries and properly seasoned burger patties really does make for a better burger. To top everything off, the Crunchy Smores sundae was a big hit. The crunchy smores was super crunchy and so full of chocolately goodness, it was hard for me to finish the taste. I didn't want to leave anything left over, but had to at this point in the tasting event.

Located right next to the Poker Room at Caesar's, Munchbar is a small, open burger joint with some tables and a half dozen stools at the bar. The menu items are scribbled in chalk-like print all over the two enclosing walls, so you have something to look at while waiting for your grub.

I ordered the Turkey Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wyPkRQg3F5Yz2WqRFax7-g?select=ZkcK0Law-DkNVSA6bscHdA#ZkcK0Law-DkNVSA6bscHdA) with mushroom stuffing, cranberries, and herb mayo. The turkey patty was pretty juicy and I liked the cranberry and herb mayo combo. The fries, however, were absolutely horrible. They were mushy and tasted stale like they had been hanging out in the fryer basket for a couple of hours. I'm sorry, but a burger joint should know that it is important to change the fryer oil on a regular basis so you don't end up with mushy, rancid fries. They won't get crispy in old oil! Also, fries should be made fresh to order - they only take a few minutes (way less time than my turkey burger patty takes to cook through). 

My boyfriend had the Bleu Cheese Burger with applewood smoked bacon and mushrooms. He also enjoyed his burger, but pushed the fries aside after trying one. This seemed to be a pattern with all the other patrons at this place. I almost laughed out loud when the bartender asked me if I wanted to take the fries to go. I would have sent the fries back for new ones or at least explained to our bartender that they were horrible had I had more time, but I was on a ticking clock. 

Not a big fan of having to wait 5 minutes to get my card swiped when it is laying right there on the bar while the two bartenders are cracking jokes with what seemed to be the manager of the place.

As we were checking out the menu, the Hostess mentioned they had Happy Hour at 9pm and it was half priced appetizers and drink discounts.  It was only 8:15 and we didn't mind waiting for food until 9.  So we explored for 45 mins and returned for happy hour.  For drinks, she ordered a vodka and cran and I got the Miller Lite.  At the end, our receipt had Absolut and cran, which is at a premium cost.  We were expecting them to give her just the house vodka and cran.  Oh well, you live and you learn.  

For the appetizers, we had the grilled cheese, sweet potato fries with garlic mayo, and the philly cheese steak sliders.  I would highly recommend the grilled cheese because this is the perfect comfort food.  The side of tomato cream dipping sauce was a very nice compliment to the sandwiches.  If you like garlic, then you will love the garlic mayo dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries.  I love garlic so the sauce was great to me, but some may find it too strong for their taste.  The sliders were okay.  Kind of dry.  It would have been nice to compliment it with a dipping sauce or maybe I could have used a condiment (ketchup, mustard, or mayo) to offset it.  

Highly recomment for happy hour as their prices were reasonable.  Not sure if I would go here and pay regular prices unless I'm in my drunken and hungry state after bar hopping/clubbing.

Naughty treats for drunken souls! This may not be the best place to go if you're a girl that doesn't want to see your man (or woman) looking at other girls dancing in scantily clad clothing 15 feet away from you. 

Directly in front of the Pussycat Dolls Casino, MunchBar's greasy, all-American menu sounded great at midnight. We were buzzed and craving some serious naughty food. The fiance ordered the wings (honey and spicy) and I ordered the hot dog w/ pretzel bun & criss cut chili fries!

OMG did that hit the spot! It was soo good. He's a wings aficionado and raved about the wings. They were fantastic. The spicy wings were more on the spicy/vinegary side and not gross and buttery. They were meaty and very crispy. 

The hot dog came out perfectly grilled on a warm and squishy pretzel bun. This wasn't some $1 after hours hot dog. This was a real treat. When my hot dogs are delightful, I like to dress them up with the honor they deserve: mayo, ketchup, pepper and mustard. My baby got the works and it was among the best hot dogs I've eaten. The chili fries were very good, but frankly, I was transfixed by the glorious hot dog to notice the nuances of the fries and the chili to cheese ratio. 

Service was fine. The view of the dancers and other female diners evil-eying their boyfriends all added to a glorious night of hogging out. I carbed out and it was totally, utterly worth it.",Px7Wv8upFSmB4660i9bOsg,7,9,4,w8kipSlgo1ENMu7b9vUYfg

However, I wish that this restaurant was the 24 hour restaurant of choice in Caesars but sadly it closes pretty early for what you would expect with the location/type of food. I only managed to eat there once during my last trip but I would have gone back if I had the time!

The food: My husband had the turkey burger which was a great size for the price and came with all the fixins of a Thanksgiving dinner. Yum! It also came with a huge bucket of french fries which were perfectly crisp and tasty. They really know what they are doing with their fryer! I had the Jalapeno burger and even with being from Texas I was pleased that this burger actually packed some heat! I find a lot of the ""spicy"" Mexican foods I've had in Vegas pretty much have no burn at all but this was not the case with this burger. It came topped with fried jalapeno slices, jack cheese, guacamole and this divine spicy sour cream. Delish! I substituted my fries for tots and was a little bummed at how much smaller the serving was than everyone else's bucket o fries but they were still really tasty and nicely fried to a crisp. My friend got grilled mahi mahi fish tacos and it looked so good she was nice enough to give me a bite. It came with these adorable little corn tortillas and all sorts of tasty sauces and condiments so you could build your own tacos. As if that wasn't awesome enough I don't think I have ever tasted a more delicious and perfectly cooked piece of mahi mahi. It was moist, light as air flaky, not ""fishy"" at all and just all around perfect. I would order that next time and I am super picky about fish so even I'm shocked that I say that. Everyone left the restaurant full and happy. The prices were reasonable, too. $15 for a burger and a boatload of fries isn't bad in Vegas!

The decor: Fun, funky and doesn't take itself too seriously. We loved the chalkboard look they had around the restaurant. It gave the place a great vibe. The chairs were comfy and everything was spotlessly clean.

The service: This is the only place I would have shaved off part of a star. The girl was nice enough but seemed to be kind of annoyed with the presence of customers. She did not come back to the table very often to check if we needed more drinks, etc. Also, my friend ordered a bloody mary and when she received it she asked if she could have a few extra olives. The girl did not come back for 30 minutes and when she did she said ""Did you still want those olives?"" and when we said yes she was still gone for another 10 minutes. We weren't sure if she just forgot for a while or if she really didn't want to have to give my friend the olives. No biggie, I guess. She did eventually get her olives but it seemed like a silly thing to have an issue with.

All in all we will make sure we come back to MunchBar on our next trip to Vegas...and keep our fingers crossed that maybe Caesars will add this to their 24 hour restaurant list for those not willing to pay $30 a person for a late night meal! They do have a takeout window but it closes at the same time as the restaurant so maybe they could consider just keeping the window open!",WwWI691N_jcVBmJ9Zs8-0A,1,1,5,dNzH01jed_ILCjb3-2LQJw

After about two bites of food, we both decided we weren't impressed then we thought it was maybe because we were tired and ate some more unfortunately nothing changed after a few more bites. Her grilled cheese wasn't very cheesy. I think the cook only put one slice of cheese in the sandwich and it was a very weak flavor. The tomato soup tasted like a can of tomatoes with no flavors or spices at all. 

My wrap was heavily dressed. There was hardly any chicken or tomato all I got was a lot of lettuce and dressing and because of the overwhelming amount of dressing, the lettuce was super soggy. Bleh. The fries that came with the wrap were warm and later became ice cold. I couldn't even enjoy the fries. We ended up eating half of our meals and then going to a Walgreens to see if we could find something to supplement the bad experience.",VjzK7jhmyC5KManY_z-x0g,2,2,2,SNbWjkuH0NBe3tS6kc_9_w

It did seem to take a little longer than expected for our waitress to show up initially and for us to get our food after ordering. Aside from that, our drinks were refilled quickly and we were checked on during our meal. Service was friendly overall.
The food itself all looked and tasted really good. I had the turkey focaccia sandwich and shared some chili cheese tater tots. The portion for the tots is huge! The sandwich was good and the fries it came with were hot and crispy. A variety of munchies were ordered by our group and it all seemed good. I did notice a smores sundae on their dessert menu that sounded intriguing and absolutely delicious. Got too full on this visit tho, so that will have to wait for next time!
Prices are slightly lower here than at Central(which is CP's 24hr dining spot). A side note, one can order from Munchbar for food service while playing at the poker room. You could probably order takeout also and take it to the sportsbook just a short walk away. Then nosh and enjoy watching whatever sporting or racing event.

I'd wanted to try MunchBar so I walked up and took a look at their menu. Geeze. Ridiculously priced items. There's not a whole lot to pick from, within walking distance, on a 40 minute break. I asked the hostess how long it usually takes to get the meal because I only had 30 minutes before I needed to head back to my shift.  She said, ""Oh, no, it's fine. It takes like 10 minutes to get your food out after you order."" With that information, I took a seat at the bar. 

I don't know when this supposed 4-7 happy hour is, because I came here at 4:15 PM and sat at the bar and was not given any happy hour menu. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos, then changed my order to the jalapeno burger, rare, because I was worried that for $17, I was going to get a 3 inch tortilla with some skimpy toppings. I decided to just order a burger because it was the cheapest option (Fries alone are $8?!?!?!) I ordered at 4:20 and didn't get my ticket to sign until 4:33. I didn't get my food until... 4:51 PM.Suffice to say, I was pissed. I had to get my own napkins, didn't have any silverware. Ridiculous, especially when I had already tipped when I paid my bill before I got my meal. 

The burger was good because of the toppings, but wasn't worth the $19 total I paid. The meat on its own wasn't that great - tasted like ground beef with pepper. I asked for a to go box and I put my food in it. Some other waiter offered to wrap it, but I said, 'No, it's okay, I need to go"" and left. I really wasn't trying to stay for another hour. 

I hate places that don't respect the customer's time and I really hate it when servers disappear and are seen standing around chatting when that meal could have been made really quickly.
