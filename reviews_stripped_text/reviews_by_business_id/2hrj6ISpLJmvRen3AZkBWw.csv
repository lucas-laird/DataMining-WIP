Just this once experience sucked. Usually I'm ok with it.",9DdFh9ptDjmSZbriUwGvBg,0,0,2,BoEVxeH9Gwf0rDl6JjkR5Q

I went back and they told me that I can't get my meat unless I have my receipt with me, which I didn't. I wasn't gonna go al the way back for a receipt to come in and get meat on a sub, it would have cost me more in gas to do that. I will never go back to that place ever again! Bad service! Who eats a sub without meat?",YoXdL0qpGkED_Yl1RuLDDA,0,0,1,h8RAv5yqY7VykChKfi2fcw
1606593,2014-07-03,6,2hrj6ISpLJmvRen3AZkBWw,Not one of the better Subways I've been to. It is open 24 hours however they need more then 1 guy working. This guy seemed like it he knew nothing about the sandwiches or how to work the register right. it took almost 20 minutes to get a sandwich with only 1 person ahead of me. I had a cold cut combo and it was supposed to be $5 yet when I got to my car and looked at the receipt he charged me $5.25 instead. It's not like the extra quarter broke the bake it's just that the guy was lost. The fillings on my sub were great but the bread was crunchy and hard. I got some oatmeal cookies they were soft and good. I might give this Subway a shot at a later date since I shop at the nearby wally world and since they are open 24 hours.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,10,9,2,9jazx8h78DIuB-Y0S3mJYQ

1834164,2017-10-02,0,2hrj6ISpLJmvRen3AZkBWw,"I've been here a few times already & I keep coming back bc of the incredible staff & when I mean incredible staff I mean Leaire, (would have given this a 5 star for her) she always makes me feel welcomed & loves to ask about my day & how my week was & gets my order perfect instead of asking her for more things. This last time I came, I was with a girl Alexandria. WORST employee you guys have there, she was so rude & looked like she hated being there with the plainest attitude. Was giving her coworker rude looks & I had her fix my sandwich about 2-3 times bc she just being stingy with the amount. ""Have if your way"" ha more like have her HER way. Defiantly will be calling ahead to see if Leaire is working because I guess it's kinda hard for some people to make a sandwich.",GPs25jpsmH-jTedShH9wfw,0,0,2,YKMhQzh7ZpCMAJy1EPG4bA
2033898,2016-10-03,0,2hrj6ISpLJmvRen3AZkBWw,Ridiculous. I waited 36 minutes with 2 people ahead of me and ended up having to walk out to get to work. 36 minutes. if you're going to only have 1 person maybe make sure he can handle making more than 2 sandwiches an hour. Definitely don't go to this location if you're looking for a quick lunch.,xvrRId4lNcUS1PQGN5UCpQ,0,0,1,69LdFyiUdbuDOL1Nl2BQCQ
2340269,2017-10-07,3,2hrj6ISpLJmvRen3AZkBWw,"Wow. Just wow. The management here needs to train their staff big time. We walked in and immediately I see two customers ordering sandwiches and one girl making their sandwiches VERY SLOWLY. Also behind the counter is the  ""supervisor"" on duty, who is on the phone enjoying herself while more people come in to get their sandwiches behind a backed up line. 

After 15 mins of watching this girl make SLOW as possible sandwiches for two demanding customers who want everything just so, another customer walks in. We casually tell her we have been waiting almost 20 mins and she says loudly ""Oh no I have to get going I can't wait that long."" 

Then by some miracle the ""supervisor"" gets off the phone and helps move the line along built up by this SLOW AS A SNAIL girl. The ""supervisor"" makes my boyfriend's sandwich in 8 seconds. Mine took 3 mins by this SLOW girl who struggled with avacado..... finally I told her to just wrap it up I have to go. 

Overall I can see the associates are not floor ready for speed and accuracy. I can see the ""supervisors"" are not trained with self awareness and leadership skills to build the business.",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,5,0,1,kAkr7GP8VTmY3hnw9D7qLA

has management ever heard of greeting customers ?? ohhh wait that would mean you need to take your face out of your cell phone and stop texting. New employee completely not ready to be left alone especially not at lunch time. Third employee grunts when you speak to him. If you all hate your jobs that much GET OUT Otherwise remember you work in a service industry put a damn smile on your face and fake it till you make it!!!",lVgk6IWZol8Q-ASsVx93eA,0,0,1,FcC4k9VYpkUb5xUPdV-kHw
4042488,2017-03-20,1,2hrj6ISpLJmvRen3AZkBWw,"I have gone to this Subway since it opened and it was always great, good service, clean and good employees! Lately in the last 6 mos everything has changed; the bread is stale, the servers are sloppy, and slow. The restaurant is dirty, with dirty tables, the trash bin overflowing with garbage and items on the menu were not available especially the honey oat bread which they have been out of at least 5 times in the last two weeks! The soda fountain is dirty, needs cleaning and needs to be refreshed with flavor syrups and is mostly soda water! 
Today, they were slow, let my sand which sit after toasting and wandered off somewhere, then fixed the person behind me their sandwich while mine sat getting cold and then when I asked for sweet onion sauce the server almost dumped half the bottle on my sandwich! The final straw, no napkin served in my basket. Which would not be a big problem if not all these other things that are occurring. I think the good employees have left and management is not keeping tabs on the new ones and/or training their staff right. Today was the LAST STRAW, I will not be returning!  
Went there again on Wednesday , since it is so close to my home, to see if anything had been corrected, IT HAS NOT!!! If anything things were WORSE!! I almost threw up when I checked the sofa fountain, FILTHY!! The two young male workers were not making their selves useful and cleaning anything when they had time on their hands. It seems like there is a big turn over in employees, I wonder where the manager is??? Too bad because this used to be a great place, CLEAN, courteous workers who did a great job! I wonder what happened, no oversight I suppose, the Health Dept should get involved!! I definitely will not return! Almost forgot they had NO NAPKINS, since when does a restaurant run out of NAPKINS????
Today is 3/20/2027, since my review I have gone back just to see if anything has changed and it HAS NOT! Yesterday and the day before when I went in, no one greeted me much less waited on me even though there were NO other customers were there. The help was busy talking among themselves , completely ignoring me , I walked out after 10 minutes! And there was an older man yesterday and he was busy getting bread ready for the oven and the girl was just ignoring me so again after 10 Minutes I just walked out! It appears this Subway is not getting the message that your customers come first! Won't go back EVER not even to check on them!",Ae9z8POfAtN9Fchc97Mazg,0,0,1,X32Ez02bFYHmmWyILY1XjA
4052479,2013-03-30,1,2hrj6ISpLJmvRen3AZkBWw,"Just your average Subway sandwich located in Centennial.  I was in the area craving meat, but because it was Good Friday, fish is the only thing that I can have. I checked out Smashburger and Teriyaki Madness just in case they had fish options.  The answer was ""no"".  So, I settled for this Subway.  All I got was a 6 inch Tuna w/double tuna and zero condiments.  Because the mayo was missing, taste was no different than a can of tuna.  It did help that I had their tasty Honey Oat bread choice.  I've tried other meals from Subway in the past.  My favorites include their Steak and Chicken Breast.  

Overall, my order was quickly made even though this place was packed for lunch. Service was good and my meal was good en ought to sustain me for a few hours.  I use to frequent places like Subway all the time, but with places like Which Wich, Capriotti's, and Firehouse all over, places like Subway now become an after thought.  However, one thing that Subway has to offer is cheap eats, consistent taste, and great service from their sandwich artists.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,3,1,3,YfQvnb_D_1-_mDDPIqWJJQ

5074062,2018-05-17,0,2hrj6ISpLJmvRen3AZkBWw,"This is one of the busiest subways I've seen, but for some reason they are also the slowest. Just like any other made to order, cafeteria style restaurant, speed is a big deal and they just can't figure that part out. I would come more often for a quick bite when I'm in the area but ""quick"" bite and this subway don't go hand and hand lol

The food is as expected. Fresh baked bread, thinly sliced meats and cheeses with a decent assortment of vegetables and sauces available. 

Pricing is comparable to other sub businesses and the location is great.  I'll be back when I'm in the mood for a simple meal with time to kill.",E7SNJmkznqEChusdrp25aQ,2,0,2,xJZQmdOVn047Za8KQzFyBQ
