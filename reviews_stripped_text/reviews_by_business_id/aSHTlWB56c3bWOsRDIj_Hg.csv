1747018,2018-05-12,0,aSHTlWB56c3bWOsRDIj_Hg,Place is convenient for me.. I usually stop by for their fruit tray. I haven't had anything else from this place but the menu looks appetizing and the place looks nice and clean. Only thing for me is that as soon as you go inside the smell of that fabuloso (scented floor cleaner) is too much. Everytime i get the fruit i swear i can taste it. I think they need to tone it down a bit and i would go more often.,9f5NRRXg2Og0paQxplYXQw,0,0,3,e5ZQ9el9YgIYG1z0SwC9fA

It includes watermelon bites, mango bites, jicama bites, peanut candy, other candies and a whole cucumber. My friend found this place on Facebook so we all hit it up! It was delicious and perfectly seasoned. BUT there's no table or chair to sit so find a place to eat before you get something huge!",pIekRRbcZvQbwYobu7f6sA,1,1,5,hz7KccR6S8SImSnAZ03YYw
