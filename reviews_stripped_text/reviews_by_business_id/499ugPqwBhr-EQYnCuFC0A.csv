28605,2015-06-07,0,499ugPqwBhr-EQYnCuFC0A,Very Delicious may I add! Very family friendly! Great Service! Affordable prices! One of the BEST Thai/ Hawaiian fusions in Vegas that I know!

70232,2014-06-11,0,499ugPqwBhr-EQYnCuFC0A,I give this place a two because I had the pad thai I ask for 2 in spicy and it was soo spicy my stomach hurted my mouth was burning. I could taste the original flavor of the pad thai. I can only imagine what a 5 or 10 taste like. Wish it wasn't spicy so I could enjoy it.,LKYiZg-KzmKxtJUXBAxlbQ,1,0,2,sEmoK2M3EitpsJ0Dvcgu_g

291018,2014-11-03,0,499ugPqwBhr-EQYnCuFC0A,"Food was good. Not great.

Ordered the pineapple fried rice and chicken pad thai. 

I asked for no shrimp, chicken only and extra egg on the fried rice.  There was not even half a chicken breast and I counted 5 pieces of pineapple in the whole order of rice.  No extra egg either.  

 also asked for extra egg in the pad thai.  No extra egg in the pad thai.  They charged me a dollar more for chicken pad thai which also had less than half a chicken breast in the whole order.

I placed an online order for pick-up at 6:15, as I was out running errands. The owner called me at 5:50 telling me my order was ready for pick-up.  I arrived at 6:10 and needless to say my food was barely warm.  Very dissapointing.",fwFmhD6QSnPGNWN92qVAOA,0,0,2,0A2eQg7Y0ok-n14Dl0oG8Q

1228215,2014-08-09,0,499ugPqwBhr-EQYnCuFC0A,"First impressions are a little off-putting. While the staff was extremely friendly, there were problems; because of the language barriers, be sure to use the numbers on their menu. Then double check. The flavors of the dishes my party and I ordered were bland at best with low quality meats. A few tips for future patrons: the Pad Thai is very heavily seasoned with fish sauce, no matter what meat you order in it. And their spice levels are not very spicy.",LdSeMJkMtcKjbc1TwnqNBw,0,0,2,aMNezgF8P1HpcpRnYmj3KA

There are only seats for about 12 people in the entire place.  The panang curry was good, but I ordered spicy level 3, and it was SO SPICY I had a difficult time eating it.
It is clearly a mom n pop place, so I'd give it another try if I lived around to support their business.",6kLArh8EBiSiaDfqt0CmVg,1,1,3,D8hN2A4_Vyz-utB-7H_jbA

I ordered Pad thai noodles and basil chicken both number 7 thinking it'd be pretty mild, boy was I surprised. It was extreme spicy. I'm Mexican and I love spicy food and this was good but super spicy. Both were great dishes. Like others said the servings are quite small for the main entrees but it was more than enough pad thai. Would definitely order again, but at a spicy level of 4 next time!",-jPBR0iUPkoK8pXynY_KHw,1,1,4,z7boxH9XW2nkj9mMiS7l-g

The thai tea was tasty, but the pad Thai was too fish saucey/too salty, it was in an abnormally neon orange sauce! I feel like that I would be radioactive after eating it... :/ the chow mein was like stir fried ramen noodles. I feel that I can make a better chow mein at home... The owner was polite and he kept checking up on us. The food is just ok, nothing to rave about, but we would not be coming back :(",e-0zEgp_EK9oBbyQpyI71w,1,1,2,F6jAPsHxuuB919qouB-0Zg

The curry was supposed to be 7.95 and the egg rolls 3.95 when the guy showed up he wanted 19.35. When I called back he said the menu on yelp was wrong and the prices went up?

4147532,2014-02-05,0,499ugPqwBhr-EQYnCuFC0A,"What a pleasent little surprise Thai Noodle Cafe turned out to be.  I don't know how long it has been open but I just saw it recently and being so close to home for me I had to try it.  My initial impression, it is a small kind of place.  It felt like an old pizza kitchen.  Like maybe it was a Dominoe's at one time.  There are a couple of tables and a counter with a couple of pamphlet folded menus along with some pictures and paintings on the walls.  Not much else to speak of here.  It was quiet when I walked in.  Though it was 5:45 in the evening there were no other diners.  I walked right up to the counter, glazed over the menu for a minute and decided on my favorite Thai Red Curry.  It was ready in just over 5 minutes which had me concerned.  How fresh could it be coming out so quickly?  It also looked like a small serving.  Did I just pay $9.69 for disappointment?  Alas, my fears were put to rest when I got home and began to serve myself up.  There was a lot more curry and rice than I had thought.  The packaging was deceptive.  And this was good food too.  It did not taste like it had been sitting out waiting for me at all.  There was a a ton of curry and coconut flavor going on, the chicken was tender, the vegetables (bamboo, carrots and bell pepper) were still crisp and the steamed rice was still steaming.  The fresh basil used was the sweet Thai variety and was a nice touch.  Sometimes basil can be too pungent and overpowering.  This was a perfect compliment to a good curry and that made for a nice evening.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,0,4,3sgGzQUKLNaVz5YqrVYU2g
4371934,2014-06-12,0,499ugPqwBhr-EQYnCuFC0A,"I've been wanting to try this place for months and finally went today. I ordered the spicy basil beef (spicy level #5 out of 10) I gave it 4 stars because the food was very delicious. I didn't give it full 5 stars because I was very disappointed with the portion size. There was so much vegetables and very little meat. Also another thing I questioned was every other place ordering spicy basil beef its been ground beef this place made it with sliced beef it honestly looked and tasted like Mongolian beef but still good. I dont know if I'll order it again but the customer service, Thai tea, & over all food taste was good enough for me to go back and try something else next time.",NFodPTpbWK7dSymxaBiUXg,0,0,4,jMNUTpE1KWAtF4UVdRkq8w

It was billion degrees outside and we were hungry but not willing to risk sunstroke to grab a bite. We noticed this place had online ordering through the Yelp App so we decided to give it a try. 

We had Larb, Pad Thai with Chicken, Chicken Satay and Pork with Chinese Broccoli.  We decided to go with Level 1 on the spices for everything having read complaints in other reviews. 

Everything was hot, tasty and delivered ahead of schedule. Using the online delivery was easy and you can even prepay the tip. 

A friendly gentleman showed up at our hotel door bearing delicious food and that was that. Hassle free dining.

When I had finished my other shopping I returned and went in to place an order to go. When I try a new Thai restaurant I always start with Pad Thai and panang curry. Both dishes were great, as good as any other Thai place in Vegas and better than many. I have been back several times to try many different dishes and have been very happy with consistent top quality every time. The food is really great, the location is close to home and the prices are very reasonable.

So I looked up Thai food near centennial hills and I found this spot.. It was a hard place to find since they didn't have a big sign to see.. But I eventually found them.. As I went inside.. It was a bit small.. Possibly about 15 people could fit inside and eat comfortably.. But thankfully, no one was there. I ordered the wonton soup and my girlfriend ordered the house noodle special which was seafood tomyum noodles. It took a while for them to cook, but at least I know it's fresh and not one of those restaurants who heat up their pre-made food.. The food was amazing.. And the man who I ordered from served us our food.. And made sure we had everything we needed..

When I walked inside no one was there but a little old couple (the owners), it's a small seating area and the decor is ehh. I still placed my order even though I was beginning to worry about my choice of this place. I got the Pad Thai (level 4) and Green Curry (level 4), The Pad Thai was yummy and the spice was prefect, there was a good amount of chicken but they forgot the peanuts. My green curry was kind of greasy you can see it settling at the top. I still ate it and the taste was there it was spicier than the Pad Thai but not too bad. I would go back but I'm still on the hunt for a great Thai place in my area. This one will get me by in the meantime.",rwxIAhvgoYQZr6VNz1lvhA,1,0,3,ZE8lztXfz9gMUdhf1fHHRA

I had again the pad thai and pineapple fried rice. And make shure you ask for it mild cause even mild is spicy. The pineapple fried rice is even amazing.
