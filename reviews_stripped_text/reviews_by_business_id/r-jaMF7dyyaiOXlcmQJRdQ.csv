Freshly slices deli meats and cheeses which is a plus!!
I had the philly cheese sandwich on wheat. The bread is like cardboard. No flavor. Not tasty ...
Women watching their carb intake will be very disappointed to waste their carb usage on the bread here.

Meat was sparse in my sandwich. Overly cheesed up to bulk the sandwich. Not cool. Not returning.

3 stars because I respect that they cut up deli meat and cheese from a cube right in front of you... That's rare.. Can't find that at a subways or togo's.... Ya feel meh.. So I'll up to a 3 ...",fNFot7D1YeUghbbML0Ua4g,0,0,3,JnxcV4cCD3-4PltkmSCjiQ

As i was about half way through my Philly sub i bit something hard. So as anybody would do I pulled it out of my mouth and as you can see it was bone/cartridge. So needless to say I called the store. Spoke to the manger Lacy who said that is not possible, our meat is brought into us. I said I don't care YOU SOLD IT TO ME. I told her i can bring you my wrapper, and the receipt to prove we bought it from you. She said well when you can prove it, call me back!! Wow what great customer service. She was unapologetic, basically called me a liar! This is horrible customer service!! So I thought I would share my horrible experience with this place. I will be headed down there with everything and see what happens then!!

So I returned to the store with the bone, and receipt. She told me this is from their peppers and it happens from time to time! So wait a minute this is from peppers yet has meat and fat on it??? this happens from time to time? THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT ON THE PHONE AND MAKE IT RIGHT? Instead you called me a liar, and provided zero customer service. She said it was against their policy to refund any money because we had used a coupon on one out of 3 of our sandwiches! I was a little frustrated and speaking firmly but she asked to me to quit yelling at her or I would have to leave the store. she was worried about what the other customers would think. Ummm lady how about the customer right in front of you? Ugh... At the end of this horrible experience i received a refund, and they lost a customer who works across the street and the business we would have brought.",6AbktYqjPZ0fE117YS_qbg,1,0,1,ZuyVYcKlm7QeKNu74m7d7g

Took soooo long mostly because the girl was too busy flirting with the previous customers who kept complimenting her on her retainer (really guys?) I was literally yelling not to put vinegar on the sandwich right in front of her but she was laughing with the other customers and soaking vinegar on it. the cook could not understand I wanted a grilled sandwich on bread not a wrap and had to unwrap my sandwich because she forgot stuff. Ordered a large drink and they gave me a small I just helped myself to switch it out. Only good thing was when I checked the recipt they forgot to charge for one of the subs and chips yay free food.

To start the people there just seemed miserable like we were inconveniencing them by coming in 40 minutes before they closed. The girl that made our subs was super rude. When I asked for the new parm bread she rolled her eyes and said ""nope don't got it"" (like ok no big deal no need to be rude) Then when she's making our subs and I say mikes way she just proceeds to make the subs and I notice that there is no onions and thought maybe she would get them from the back or something and when she goes to finish I say ""is there no onions?"" And she once again rolls her eyes and says ""nope and I'm not about to slice anymore when we close soon"".. now when I was about 15-18 years old I worked at the Jersey Mikes in Boca Park. And that would have just been unacceptable I'm paying $50 for 4 sandwiches but again whatever. When I go to ring out she just holds out her hand for the money and is done.

I got it Mike's Way which includes tomatoes, lettuce, onions, spices, oil and vinegar. The bread was freshly made and quite good. A few of the guys tried the Original Italian and they all raved about how good it was, so I'll try that next time. 

  In short, everyone at the station was happy Jersey Mike's and I'm sure that they made 10 customers from our visit. The service was great and the new owner is a great guy.

The roast beef that was made in house was bland.the meat portions seemed less than Subway .The tomatoes looked old and soft. Staff was friendly all tho the place was dirty. Soda machine holding nasty water in the tray. Don't think we will be returning. Not a happy experience.,mY_mBrvJjT-1M5re8kbnDA,1,0,1,fHiBLb4NRYw3mdPuQInPLg

I was a little disappointed because the bread wasn't as fresh as at any other location where I've been. The rest of the sandwich was fine though and still beats any other sub shop around.,B5BmRbPULPZqrBN8SxYNYw,2,0,3,ZHlFPkMZkTpWTnmGxyUDbw
