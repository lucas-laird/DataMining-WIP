The hot dogs were very loosely wrapped, so all the toppings fell off/apart. There were also a few details that were missing on the customer service front. The cashier didn't tell me how much the total order was when I was done ordering, didn't ask if I wanted a drink, etc. I know this is a fast food place but come on. There needs to be a sense of service and at least some quality.",4r_4feU3sXI4K-U-T1pPdw,0,0,1,O-rbjY0t9toFYRVRJ0wdHg

1935253,2015-03-01,0,AhAuNIkWtht0Fq4gEJzodA,"I went through the drive thru about 8pm on Saturday the 28th 2015. I waited about 1 minute till someone took my order for 4 corn dogs. I waited 15 minutes in front of a vehicle and the drive thru person handed the vehicle 1 little bag. I then waited another 5 minutes at the window and all you hear is laughing and yelling, the cashier finally took my money, he gave me my change but no receipt. I then received my order and no receipt in my bag so I asked the cashier for my receipt and he scrambled around looking for one. He finally produced a receipt but the amounts were different; pretty shady.... When I got home I only had 3 corn dogs in my bag; how do you split 3 corn dogs for 4 kids?!.... So, I call Wienerschnitzel and ask for the manager and the guy who answered the phone said that the manager is off. No manager on duty is a health code violation per health department. I asked the person whom I was talking to for his name and he refused to tell me and I asked for the managers name and he said it was against company rules to give that information. I don't know the the cashiers name cause he wasn't wearing a name tag. This is bad business and I will not be coming back and I will make sure to spread the word.

Not complain.  And they let me keep the incorrect item and made the item I wanted.  That is a damn good customer serv8ce experience.  They didn't have to let me keep the incorrect item but they did and made the one I wanted free and walked it out to me.  I didn't catch his name.

2585836,2007-04-05,3,AhAuNIkWtht0Fq4gEJzodA,"Since I reviewed Nathan's I should review the exact opposite of a good hot dog joint.

I do love the dogs.  One day in high school, my friends and I had a day where we did stuff that we'd never done before.  One of those things was go to a Wienerschnitzel.  I didn't like it then.

I then married a man who LOVED Wienerschnitzel and would bring it home at every opportunity.  I then learned that I hate Wienerschnitzel.

I've made better hot dogs at home on my grill much cheaper.  I don't know what they do to them - mayhap I don't have enough fake German in me to like them - but they've always tasted slightly of ass and cat food.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,2,1,1,BKq5IcdIUBFh2_EpWUS6eQ

But we were home before we realized the kids didn't get their kids meal toys and I was ok with that(less trash around the house) but after feeding everyone else I sat down to eat my food and I got way more then what I asked for with my meal. There was a LONG HAIR melted right into the cheese in my chili cheese dog, at least 6 inches of HAIR were hanging out the dog. Never again! NEVER!",j-m430aGP_fRLk--yrn7wA,1,0,1,E7q4OV07KQ6FBrM9J3pDqA

We all had something different- one vanilla cone, one chocolate dipped cone, a root beer float and a copycat blizzard. The price for a regular cone is 99 cents, while the root beer float is $1.99. Not bad. I had the root beer float and it's pretty good size, but I didn't finish the root beer part.

This place is small but the cool air inside was refreshing on a humid day like today. The three people working here were nice. We were the only ones here until another customer showed up.

The neighborhood is a little bit of a rough area, but it's not too bad. As far as the restaurant goes, it's relatively small, and looks to as if it is geared towards takeout, they don't necessarily want a lot of customers in the dining area. Food quality is good and service is a little above average for fast food. They are always running specials, many times for 5 corndogs or chilli dogs for about $5.00.

We only live down the street so we didn't check the food before we left. To my horror my daughter comes in to tell me she found something in her food! I looked and it appeared to be a piece of a brillo pad that was mixed in with her chili cheese fries! I took it back and the manager just thought I just wanted it for free despite the fact that my 7 yr old daughter ate half of her chili cheese fry before discovering that there was a piece of a brillo pad, they refunded my money after snide remarks. My daughter is now 9 and thanks to their horrible service and lack of sanitary measures are the reason why my family and I don't eat at any Wienerschnitzel ever again and I advise all my family and friends not to eat here unless you want to eat cleaning products/supplies with your meal.",gGdyC-aNnDZNafMtVsHJMg,0,0,1,1931k0UDU1ACpIr2d5PE6w

The pastrami reuben suffered from the same problem as at other Wienerschnitzels, could use more pastrami, but it was a $6 sandwich, not a $15 one so can't really complain.  One big plus: while they don't participate in the app promotion, they take emailed coupons!
