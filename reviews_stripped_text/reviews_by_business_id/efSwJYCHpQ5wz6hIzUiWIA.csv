Fast, always a prompt service, amazing customer service and awesome associates. This is by far my favorite Taco Bell in all of North LV. It's never too crowded and its in a great location- got a Walmart Neighborhood market and a 7 eleven across the street, as well as a post office and an Albertson's in the upcoming corner.!!!!!!!! 10 star review!!!!",aT9nUrNXniWFS4FGB8y_yw,0,0,5,T6bYE0IavKFuszEKne9MjA

First off the cashier didn't seem to understand I didn't want shredded chicken tacos I wanted the other kind of chicken. Then I didn't realize 1 hard shell basic taco was damn near $2.00 like what happened. These tacos aren't all that and not real mexican food. I just didn't feel like driving to get cheaper real mexican food. 

Got my order fairly quickly but when the little bish handed me my bag I said thank you as I always do. The rude lil bish kept walking to talk to her friend that was eating in the dining room. I'm so big on customer service no matter what kind of job you have. You chose this job to work at Taco Bell so do your best working there cuz without customers you wouldn't have that job.

No disrespect to this industry but they asses crying about how they want more than minimum wage. How about stepping up your game to deserve a raise. I definitely don't make what I think I'm valued at but that doesn't mean I do a half ass job or a crappy job either. 

So here's the kicker!!! These wonderful fast food workers didn't give me 2 of my tacos!!! What kind of nonsense is this? I shouldn't have to check my food since that's their job but I knew better. I WILL NEVER PATRON OR SPEND MY MONEY HERE AGAIN!!! I could have spent my money at IN-N-OUT for alot less money that has better food with great service.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,1,ci2a900X8EsElQiLat8RqA

3326541,2015-11-01,1,efSwJYCHpQ5wz6hIzUiWIA,"I don't even want to give this location 1 star because they don't even deserve that. We walked in and we waited at least 15 minutes and the 3 employees which included the manager Leslie didn't even acknowledge us. They kept talking to each other in Spanish about something else and they even saw us but didn't even tell us ""we'll be with you in a second"" or anything like that. They just kept making food like we were not even there. After about 15 minutes the manager came up to take our order but by then we were so mad I just asked if she was the manager and walked out. She didn't even care that we walked out. She didn't try to stop me and ask what was wrong or anything. I have never ever waited at any Taco Bell without even being acknowledged for that long. Terrible service. Don't ever go there. That is the worst manager ever.",MWkAFgV73v3XGer74varrw,1,0,1,CL07peZ13PnnSh2MMxyqTA

3696597,2015-12-02,0,efSwJYCHpQ5wz6hIzUiWIA,"Taco Bell is very popular in the vegan/vegetarian community.
 (Just ask for no meat or cheese or sour cream) (sub with gauc, rice or beans) Sometimes it's hard asking people that because they think you're crazy and sometimes aren't very friendly with me asking this simple task.

This Taco Bell was a very pleasant experience! Odilia B was so friendly and understanding! She even drew a little smiley face on my bag. 
Thank you for hiring such nice employees like her!",ywa54DWkl27dlSMlPlkrYw,1,0,5,_zUjxxHV0TWs9TTfuyTtVw
4037664,2017-04-11,1,efSwJYCHpQ5wz6hIzUiWIA,"This Taco Bell is awful! My boyfriend and I both got sick ordering from there around 6:30 pm last night Monday 10/17 ! Burrito Supreme looked like wet vomit because it only had beans and meat, but sadly we were hungry, The Veggie bowl was skimpily packed, and my bean burrito was barely warm. They obviously don't give a sh** I just spent the night cleaning up his vomit, and I have been sick all day today . Do NOT go here . Try a different Taco Bell. Maybe the one on Nellis but this one is a RISK! #foodpoisoning  #negativestars #healthdepartment",xIZJDuBpKBC8U4nliViPFg,0,0,1,vGXidX6jY_jURW4By9aNHw

4628462,2016-08-02,0,efSwJYCHpQ5wz6hIzUiWIA,"So you're probably wondering why I'm writing a Yelp review for a Taco Bell. Normally I wouldn't. But here's the situation.

This area has a lot of vacant store fronts, and empty strip malls. But I'm passing through the area, and I'm getting hungry. I see this Taco Bell, and figured I know what I will get for my money--so I stop in.

The attendee took my order--and they are very pleasant and efficient. I went to the restroom. It had a bit of normal wear and tear--but it was clean. I picked up my meal, and the tacos were visually full, and well assembled. It tasted fresh. So why am I writing? I am writing because of what I saw at the condiment table. (See my photo.) 

Normally, fast foods places just grab a handful of hot sauce, ketchup, (whatever) and toss the packets into the bin. But someone here took the time to nicely organize the packets of sauces into the bin. I mean, if the management and staff are sweating a small detail like this, it explains why all of the other details of my visit were on target.

I do not know if I just got them on a good day; but if this is how they operate every day, this store is well managed, and the team is well trained.

Maybe no one else would notice this small detail--but I did, and I want management and team members in this store to know that I noticed.",psU9IaROPzivxgO2jDcmJg,0,0,5,5Bir0ha24-HdWPE9j7xRng

He was very polite to her and didn't seem to let her attitude bother him. I go here about 3x a week and although, they can be inconsistent with the food preparation, I admire the positive attitude displayed by the staff.",zdB9A1QHk_f-ikkdvIQnXA,0,0,4,m-sXwofUC_NLo-2gXwg4jw
