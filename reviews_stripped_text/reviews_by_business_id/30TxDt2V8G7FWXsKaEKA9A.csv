I received a confirmation email and my credit card was charged for the order. Over an hour later, at 10:40pm there was still no delivery. I called the store, they advised me they had no record of my order and that they couldn't do anything because there was no manager there. So...I was left hungry with my credit card charged and no solution. This was my first attempt to try Marco's pizza, guess it wasn't meant to be. Seems that if they truly didn't get my online order, their systems are not to be trusted, maybe call the order in instead. If they did receive my order and just failed to process it, then they should've admitted to the truth and handled the situation in a more professional manner. Terrible customer service.",dD2F-Gp4srPRGVpBJNiSag,2,0,1,n-lrZwP_V7g8rS6gjir0_A

1311471,2015-12-01,1,30TxDt2V8G7FWXsKaEKA9A,"Pizza was pretty good. The large looks more like the size of a medium to me. Just was smaller than I anticipated. Wings need help. Very small wings without a whole lot of meat on them. Lower quality maybe? Customer service was great, very nice people. My kids liked the pizza, so I may order again since its 2 minutes from my house.

Update: gave an extra star, from 3 to 4. Had it tonight and I got the extra large pizza and a Caesar salad. Caesar was great and has lots of shredded parm (which I love) and the extra large pizza is the size I like. It even tasted better and looked more ""New York"" and less Pizza Hut. Prices are reasonable.",P5neFGzLzxsvFLFEhxKx3w,3,1,4,73x242mT59fxyUAER9_o4w
1467284,2015-11-24,2,30TxDt2V8G7FWXsKaEKA9A,"I received a flyer with coupons for Marco's so I decided to try it tonight. The flyer advertised a large pizza with 1 topping for $8.99 and had a coupon code to enter online. Unfortunately the coupon code didn't work online so I phoned in my order. The person who answered the phone was polite, easy to understand and efficient in taking my order. I asked if the 1 large pizza with 1 topping $8.99 deal was available still and she said yes. So I ordered a pepperoni pizza. I was informed that it would be ready in 15 min. My order was ready on time and the staff was friendly. 

Once I got home, I dove in and tried the pizza and it tasted pretty darn good. I particularly liked that the pizza slices were thoroughly. This is important because otherwise you risk ripping off some of the topping from the other pieces of pizza. 

Overall I really liked this place. I'll be coming back for sure. 

I gave it only 4 stars because the coupon code didn't work online. Other than that, this place is good in my book.",IEQjRwcXUJQ4J-x4H6Nfsg,3,0,4,Un7qRLRttAHS9gLZalGMvw

First, when I arrived at the store after a very long drive from California, the boys behind the counter did not know which pizza was mine. We figured that out and I left quickly to get home. Opened the box...ugh. Thick crust. I called the store to see if maybe they could simply make another one with thin crust for me and got horrible customer service from the actual owner! He said I wasn't his customer, but actually Grubhub's customer and he couldn't make it right. Seriously? After arguing with him, He finally agreed to make me one...but I'm never stepping foot inside that store ever again.",AlyjFSDxJim8e44yRcvNvw,0,0,1,v5nLHRGlNbdcl_V2BzX1Tw

The management at this particular location has been great about reaching out and cultivating relationships with local schools- fundraisers, discounts for school orders, etc. and they've been easy to work with.

Their pizza isn't as greasy as other spots, which I really appreciate. Of course, you can cancel that out by asking for their garlic butter crust dip, which I will probably have to use hypnotism in order to avoid in the future. They also offer more than just 'za, with sandwiches, wings, and surprisingly fresh salads.

I received a flier in the mail with coupons for Marco's and decided to use one of them tonight.  I called and ordered a White Cheezy which is listed under their Specialty Pizza section.  It's topped with 4 kinds of cheese including feta and has  onions, bacon, and garlic butter sauce on top.  I ordered the large which is a 14"" pizza.  The person who took my ordered said it would be about 13 to 15 minutes and I drove the mile and a half to pick up the pie.  It was almost done.

I paid and then brought the pie home.  It was large enough to serve two (cut into 6 slices), and there's one slice left for morning.  This will be my ""hearty meal"" before going to give platelets.

The pizza was good.  It had a taste from the feta that made it different from other pizzas I've gotten.  There was a fair amount of oil on the cardboard box but the pizza itself didn't taste oily.

The restaurant serves other things and they make pizzas that you build the way you want.

This is a national franchise with several locations in Las Vegas.
