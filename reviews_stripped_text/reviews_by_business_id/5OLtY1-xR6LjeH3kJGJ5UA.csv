1 of the owners, Larry, was very helpful and knowledgeable on products. He even offered to special order for me.",Ul_sA8p9Wgs0FxE8OHfDyA,1,1,5,B28_IBKYMzs_2TQ7Rn-SUQ

I absolutely loved their incense holder as it saves me the trouble of messy ashes once the incense burns. The couple who owns the store were so lovely and friendly it was such a pleasure talking to them. Will definitely go back to buy more incense and they even gave us a free pack of incense,",KpzBuLOzRq6cOWc7z7Qw8g,2,3,5,8rmN43UhVb2lO8CgY6Vv5w

There are clothes, accessories, and a wall of natural beauty products. Very clean store, the owners were friendly. Stopped in for a specific item and left already planning my next visit.
