I purchased a single slice of pepperoni, sausage, and ham pizza on the afternoon of 4/11/15, shortly before hopping on a bus out of town.  About seven hours later my body began rejecting ALL contents of my upper and lower intestines in the most horrific and prolonged way imaginable.  It is now four days later and I still have not fully recovered.  It was some of the worst agony I have experienced.

Just a warning for those with the foresight to check the reviews before deciding.  How I wish I had chosen ANY of the other restaurants at the Riviera food court.

How did the pizza taste?  My recollection is that it tasted a little... ""off"".  But certainly not in a way that would send up a red flag.

And they have the gall to stiff me for one slice. No thanks. I like honest merchants, who abide with their ads, their representations, and their product. Full of internet-special gimmicks. AVOID. DO NOT BE MADE INTO A FOOL.",9LX0aIyVbmhfEjqJEbt4ZA,0,0,1,X6ZkOrqmIGqI1jPUhogbEQ
