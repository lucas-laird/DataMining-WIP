Their French fries and chips are all handmade with REAL potatoes that they cut themselves and they taste amazing. 

The portion size is great, as well as the price. They don't charge you $9-$12 just for you to be hungry again 30 minutes-an hour later. 

There are also cute games in the store to keep you entertained. They were kinda torn up and should invest in newer ones, but some were in decent condition to keep you entertained while your foods on its way.

The place is just great in general and the food is great! Definitely recommend!",nqZ1G0v4rfMMKxMPMXNYUw,7,3,4,qRQCmxLhCSYOcNT-ElCBmA

The service was excellent. Very attentive. I had basic scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, crispy hash browns & sourdough toast. It was perfect. My friend had the egg salad sandwich with homemade potato chips & pasta salad. She liked it. I tried the chips, delicious, especially dipped in ranch. The pasta salad tasted like strong italian dressing, we didn't care for it. Then we had the mini homemade donuts! They were awesome little fried donuts rolled in cinnamon & sugar! Mmm! Loved them!

50973,2012-11-13,1,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"Okay- I hope Rambo's owner reads my review... I live 2 blocks (Patrick & Grand Canyon) from Rambos. I came here for the 1st time after a night at Putt Putt with friends...
Rambo's has no close time on their door- me being in the industry, I would never walk into a restaurant at closing time... But since it was early and others were eating inside, we were excited to get dessert from a 50/60's spot. That being said, a 4 top of us came in after mini-golf around 915 on a Wednesday night. We were greeted by a friendly staffer and asked to choose a seat. Another friendly wait staff took our initial drink order and then another server (who ended up being our server) had an awkward interruption/introduction in the middle of it. 
We got an iced tea, a root beer float, a coke float & a ice cream. I get it, a $17 check isn't worth keeping your doors open for...
But: cardinal sin #1: your server seemed to rush us w/out any reason... There was another table that hadn't closed there check out and was still there when we left.
#2: if you don't have hours posted, you should better inform your patrons of hours, etc.
#3: if you are a server and take a table from another server... Deal with it! I mean, don't rush that table out when we don't order a full dinner. Don't drop our check 5 minutes after we get our order. Don't turn the music off in the restaurant and rush our tab when we haven't asked for it.
We loved the vibe and will be back because we believe that a cool place deserves a second chance... So, don't disappoint Rambo's! We are rooting for you!",1prJgTrk4kH85h6mvDTL3A,3,0,4,xjfsbQ5_b-m3p81ND-qVNg

We smiled the entire time we were there.  Rambo's Kitchen ambience, theme,, and menu suit my husband and me perfectly.  We're still stunned that such a perfect place exists.

Super fun environment and still comfy and relaxing.  We had the fish tacos (super fresh and tasty), hot open-faced turkey sandwich (awesome), clam chowder (thick) and onion rings with special dipping sauce (perfect).  Then we split a gigantic milkshake which was absolutely delicious.

We were seated immediately and received prompt, very friendly service.  The prices are ridiculously low.  This would be a great first date place for couples of any age.

Next time, we're bringing our 1978 VW Bus so we can cruise down in style for some of the famous mini donuts we've heard all about.  Hopefull we'll get to meet Rambo one day!

She was so sweet, quick and helpful with the menu items. They were out of hollandaise sauce (my friend wanted eggs Benedict) but she explained that much of their food is done from scratch so I can appreciate that and understand some things are limited quantity.

161540,2012-08-06,0,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"In the spirit of getting back to my original burger 'to-do' list from way back, I finally ventured over to Rambo's Kitchen last week to see what they have to offer. It was on a Vegas top 10 burger list I read a while back but was located in a part of town I rarely went through, but that's not an excuse any more. What has been an excuse for some time though, are the very polarizing comments and responses on their Yelp page. It seems that they've had some issues with customer service from time to time, and instead of just apologizing, their representative on the site tends to be a bit too defensive in his responses. This all made me a little hesitant, but finally decided to evaluate for myself. How did it go?

Rambo's is located in your typical Vegas neighborhood strip mall, but the interior is pretty unique. Much like the Metro Pizza on Decatur and Flamingo reminds me of the 80's Saved by the Bell diner, this place is fully decked out in 60's theme with posters, surf boards, books about the 60's, tie dye, etc. There's even a TV with all sorts of 60's-era commercials playing on it, and music playing throughout the restaurant from that period. I brought this place up to my girlfriend a couple months ago, but after looking at their menu she nixed the idea as we're trying to eat healthier and there isn't much on that front to choose from, although there is quite a bit. They offer a few burger choices; the one I initially went in for is the self-titled Rambo Burger: 1/2 lb burger stuffed with a special combo of cheeses and topped with a stack of pulled pork, bbq sauce, topped with an onion ring on a toasted bun, but after contemplating it I just didn't have the appetite for such a thing on this visit. Instead I went with the waitress' other recommendation, the cheesy cheese burger: 1/2 lb burger stuffed & topped with a combo of cheeses and topped with bacon, lettuce and tomato.

What was brought to me was a bit less that groovy. Sorry, had to. The meat didn't have much flavor, the cheese that was supposedly stuffed in there wasn't noticeable, but there were lots of what I think to be fat chunks. It was also very dry by the end, and I ate pretty quickly. The bun was a bit too big for the meat, but good, buttery, fresh and sweet. There was way too much lettuce and I had to pull some off. The cheese was melted and good, but I don't know about 'cheesy cheese', just kind of a regular cheeseburger. The bacon flavorful, but some of it was not cooked enough and it was a bit chewy. Yes I chickened out on ordering their signature burger, but if this is a sign of how that might be, I question why this was on a top 10 list I read in the past.

The fries on the other hand were very fresh and great at first, but got a little oily near the end. Still they were decent, of the natural cut variety. My pickle slice was a bit small, but hardly a deal breaker. The additional side option seemed a little excessive, I went with a pasta salad as it seemed like a good idea, but just ended up being a bit too much food. The piece of bazooka gum with my bill was a nice touch though. The final price of $14.46 is about normal for a local spot with a 'fancier' burger, but I can't say I'd spend that again. I'm sure Rambo's offers plenty of tasty options for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but based on my meal I can't really stand by the burger.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,0,0,2,xkulqMlxMF5LpupIfKwfNA

482997,2012-01-14,0,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"I don't do this very often here on Yelp, but I literally just arrived home from Rambo's Kitchen and had to write this review. First off, the staff was friendly and the location is great, right next to our house off Fort Apache and 215. I had been following reviews on this place for a while and had pretty good expectations built up. 

As we arrived, I saw on the door that it was ""All You Can Eat Fish and Chips"" night for $12.95. Score, I thought! As we were seated, I took a quick glance at the menu and noticed that with ordering these fish and chips came some stipulations. No sharing, no coupons, no specials, and 1 hour maximum eating time. I wasn't overly hungry and didn't care about the time--I was looking to gorge myself on fish and chips, but just enjoy a nice dinner. This all didn't sound so bad...until...

My first basket arrived. 2 pieces of fish, a dinky container of pasta salad and a decent amount of fries. When I say dinky container, I mean like the container they serve your salad dressing in. Overall, the fish was okay--pretty greasy, but what can you expect with a 1960's diner-esq place. The waitress was nice and saw I was about to start on the 2nd piece of fish, and she put in another order. About 20 minutes later...out came a basket with 1 piece of fish in it. Seriously...1 piece!! I actually laughed and said is this really ""all you can eat?"" At this rate, the maximum amount of fish I would be able to order would probably top off at 2. I ended up not even eating the fish, we asked for the check, and walked out.

Overall, if you are looking to sign a verbal contract with your order and feel like the staff is watching your significant other with hawk eyes to make sure he/she isn't reaching into your basket, then by all means, go to Rambo's Kitchen. Other Yelper's had nice experiences, and I can honestly see the potential, but I was embarrassed to be served in such a way.

Its easy to pick up on that the owners really did put their heart and soul into the making of this place. For pretty much every meal, they have something for you. The following are my recommendations based on taste and price: 

Breakfast ~
Pick 3 Deal is only $4.99 (if you get there before 11am)  and you can choose from eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, or pancakes. All are delicious, especially for the price. 

Lunch ~
Pick 2 deal is around $8. Using Panera Bread as a comparison, its better. Much better for around the same price. The chicken salad sandwich and clam chowder (white) are my favorites, the clam chowder being the 2nd best I've ever had (the first being at ""Dan's Clam Stand"" in Gainesville, FL)

Dinner ~
The spaghetti is $8.99 and is available for AYCE on Sundays and Mondays. They use a heartier sauce, which I am typically not fond of, but this stuff is amazing. Growing up in an Italian family, its difficult to find pasta dishes that beat the ones that my grandma used to make, but Rambo's spaghetti sauce is a very, very close second. And, to me, that's saying something. 

For desert, you cannot go wrong with the mini doughnuts for the price. Absolutely delectable and very reasonably priced. 

Even though the food is good, the service (for me) has been unprecedented. At the end of their meal, they give you a card to fill out that lets you give suggestions and rate everything about the place - its very obvious they care about their customers. 

As for the people that are saying they have had bad experiences, I have been coming here roughly once a week since August and have not had a single bad experience.",4lN1VyjuYBYss8FwApkZuA,9,1,4,I5K-icHusvUQ5BDV_G6G1g

My main squeeze and I thought we would cruise on over and check out this Rambo's kitchen joint.  The atmosphere is radical.. a little trippy.  I was stoked about this place because if you know me, you know I love places that serve breakfast all day.  With that being said I order a breakfast burrito .. nice and plain just the way I like it.  I went ahead and splurged for hash browns (add $2).  This was a tough decision as they have a cheesy grilled cheese with your choice of 5 slices of cheese (Yup 5 slices I say -please take note my Muncheeze friends!).  Michael saw the club sandwich offered a choice of mayo or miracle whip and was sold...  Michael loves his miracle whip!  Order has been placed.. what is that on our table?? A couple of delightful genre appropriate coffee table books and a deck of cards.  Groovy!  For some reason it seemed to take awhile to get our order considering it was a sandwich and some eggs.. I think maybe the cook was MIA for awhile so that gave us time to read about the top Beatles songs of all time and watch some classic 60s commercials.  
The food is not A-OK but just OK.  Michael said his club was ""pretty good"" however my breakfast burrito seemed like something I could have probably made at home and the hash browns were a tad too peppery.  They do have the good crushed ice and cherry cola in their favor but I am sad to report I don't know if I would need to go back.  
In conclusion, I think this is a place you should check out because the decor is pretty cool, the service was good but they may need to spruce up the flavor profiles a smidge.

857277,2013-08-24,1,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"For the record, I hate giving this place two stars.

The place is adorable.  Every square inch is packed with some kind of memorabilia or decoration from the 60's/70's.  There was obviously a lot of care and thought taken when decorating and it pays off big.  They also play a lot of Rolling Stones, Doors, etc, to add to the hippie experience.  

The servers are also really great, especially Misty.  She's very sweet and willing to make recommendations on the menu.

Unfortunately, each time I've been here, at least one person at my table absolutely hated their meal.  I'm not talking about ""eh, not my fave"" kind of reactions, but ""I can't eat anymore of this, no, no, no.""   One of those meals was a pulled pork sandwich (apparently the meat texture left much to be desired).  

The other hated meal was my egg salad sandwich.  Now, I am a big egg salad enthusiast and will eat pretty much anything.  But, I really disliked this sandwich due to the overwhelming amount of celery in the filling.  I could only taste celery in each bite, which was gross. Also, the egg chunks were pretty large and not mashed like I prefer.  So, after a few bites, I was done and I sent it back.  I NEVER send things back, but it had to be done.  Luckily, they were very nice about it and brought me a chicken salad sandwich instead.  The chicken salad was much better, but not the greatest.

Because I love everything else about this place, I'm going to give it a few more shots.  They serve breakfast all day, so, that might be the best bet.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,7,4,2,y-oK4d1RMtmTsq6xOcMLtg
862940,2012-12-07,4,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"Okay, let's try this again.....

First let me apologize to yelp and the owner of Rambo's kitchen for writing a review that fell ""outside"" yelps TOS. I am usually a fairly soft spoken and respectful person and I am sincerely sorry for anything said in my previous review that was found to be disrespectful or a ""personal attack"".

Now to my review of the restaurant.....

I have been to Rambo's at least a half dozen times and despite what Yelp or the owner might think, I have never had a bad experience or a bad meal. All the food and service I have ever received there has been decent. As stated in my ""too personal"" review, I would give Rambo's a solid 3 stars to a soft 4 stars, which actually falls right into line with Rambo's average review, if it was just about food and service. More on that later.

The Rambo Burger was excellent. I do think that the thimble sized portion of cole slaw is a bit silly.

The first time my wife and I went there we order the fried zucchini app and it was one of the best we had ever had. Nice long lightly battered spears of zucchini that were just wonderful. The next couple of time we got the FZ the quality went down each time. We have never ordered it again.

My wife loves their salads. My 16 y/o sons loves everything, but come on, he's a 16 y/o boy.

Service? Hit and miss. Sometimes you get your order right in and it comes to your table in a timely manner, other times, not so much. Some times your water glass is always full, others not.

As for the one star rating, it needs to be understood that my wife and I try to avoid the big chain restaurants. In these difficult time we choose to go with the locally owned mom and pop places. It take guts and determination to run your own restaurant.

That said, I do not understand the attitude that the owner takes when someone gives him a negative review. Just be gracious. Accept the fact that sometimes your restaurant will hit a home run and other times it will strike out. Rather than going to the surveillance tapes to attack dissatisfied customers about their timing issues, why not just say ""Sorry for you bad experience"" and determine to improve in the future. People do not right reviews, good or bad, because they like you or dislike you. They write review because they had an emotional reaction to their experience, good or bad.

With all due respect to the owner of Rambo's, I cannot separate the food and service at Rambo's from what I feel to be a severe disconnect from the owner when faced with a legitimate, honest reviews that he doesn't like.

All parts equal the sum of this review and that's why it is a one star review.",_8qu8GfnQCv0yae2i-OU5A,15,7,1,nna62li7c8uoUqhDW4fdHg

Walked in and place was basically empty, except for the eclectic decor of 60's and 70's memorabilia. Very colorful place with tie-dye table clothes and such. Definitely gives a laid back atmosphere to the place. 

Everything went pretty much normal from here. Ordered drinks (no beer? what up wit dat) Then ordered food. I had the Rambo Burger, my wife the Cheesy Cheese Burger, and my son the Corn Dog Kitty basket. My burger was excellent. It's handmade and stuffed with cheese. Was cooked perfectly with slight char on outside but very juicy still. Topped with the pulled pork and barbecue sauce, it was a delicious sloppy mess. I also had the hand made potato chips which were a bit soggy but still good. My wife liked her burger and one my son ate all his food too. 

My only other qualm with the place was $6.89 for my son's kid menu basket. I mean it was decent size corn dog, but I expect $5 and under to feed my two year old. All in all it was just under $40 after tax and tip for two burgers, a corn dog, some fries, and one drink (i had water, wife iced tea) Bit pricey for what is basically a diner, but the food was good enough to have me go back.",x16Fl_5h9aX4tn38kKSGHw,2,0,3,5ZapIBAhYGRclY6jrAjhsw

Second time back the expireience was not good. There is a waitress there who is such a fake phony actress it makes you sick to your stomach. I think her name is jennifer with the ghostly white skin and red hair. She brought us our breakfast. Eggs were cold, pancakes were hard as a rock and also cold. She could see we were not happy and put on a fake smile with her fake nice attitude like nothing was wrong.
Wanted to give it another shot with a take out order and spent $40.00 for fish and chips for the family. I got there early to pick up the order and was greeted by the same phony waitress. Got home 1/2 mile away to fish that was cooked in the same nasty oil probably used all day long and never changed out. The same oil was also used for the nasty french fries that were god awful. I will be sure to shut this place down by word of mouth alone. Get rid of the fake phony waitress who is just looking for the next gratuity then maybe the negative reviews will stop.

When we arrived we were promptly seated and the waitress came by at took our drink order. We all ordered water and then ordered our meals.

We were then IGNORED for 45+ minutes while we waited for our food. No check ups by the waitress, no I am sorry your food is taking so long. hey do you need a refill, no nothing. At that point since we were out of time and had to get back to the office so we got up to leave. That is when we were finally noticed. The waitress came running over almost freaking out  saying our food is just about ready. Where were you 20 minutes ago?

Anyway one guy in my party had guilt over leaving and paid for the whole order to go. I disagree that he should of done that since we were not into them for anything because we were all drinking water but that was his choice.

I understand that sometimes freshly made food takes a bit longer when its prepared fresh, but not 40 minutes. but there is no excuse to ignore someone for that amount of time.

P.S. In response to the owner's comments, I stand by what I said in my review as accurate. So based on what the owner says, good customer service is to call me a liar, write a snarky insincere response, and rally against yelp and other review sites complaining about how unfair they are?  I have read all the owner's comments left towards other Yelpers and there is a consistent theme throughout them. If something goes wrong during your visit, don't blame the restaurant. Not a very productive response in my opinion. I think highly of yelp as yet another tool for consumers to made educated decisions about where to spend their hard earned money. It is also good for businesses that go above and beyond because they will always be rewarded with my repeat business.",zFszUTKwfFIWK6EAYCyR7Q,11,4,1,-EX8cKuXWe0L26aNJZGxSw

I even sent my parents here to try it out. They came for dinner (yes they're open pretty late), said the meal was like home cooked food, including the meatloaf. The owner welcomed them and when my dad proudly informed him that my mom had attended Woodstock it created an instant bond!

I stopped in last night for dinner, and knew the moment I walked in that this place had a shot at being great.  The restaurant is decked out with tie-dye, vintage concert posters, and other 60's and 70's era memorabilia.  A few menu items and specials are written on the wall, and the music plays at an appropriate level.  Last night ""Bernadette"" by the Temptations was on as we entered, a personal favorite.  

The menu has a lot of variety; its a good idea to ask your server what's delicious?  Most items come with a side, and even though there were a lot of choices, we both ordered the hand-cut fries.

Our Dinner:

Sm. Onion rings - They were standard onion rings, not too greasy, crisp coating.  The side of ranch they are served with is key.

Turkey Avocado Croissant w/ hand cut fries - A flaky, buttery croissant hugged some fresh slices of avocado, lettuce, tasty turkey, and a little aioli.  It was very good.  The FRIES are excellent.  The hand-cut bad boys were in-and-out strives to be, but falls short of accomplishing.  They aren't fast food fries, but they are similar to in-and-out in cut.  

The RAMBO BURGER - Oh Yeeeaaahhhh!  (Hulk Hogan voice)

As soon as I saw this I figured, ""I worked hard this week, I earned this.""  This juicy, 1/2 pound burger is stuffed with various cheeses, (mild with a hint of sharp cheddar) topped with home made BBQ Pulled Pork and an onion ring.  The lightly toasted bun was incredible.  If this burger won an award, it would first thank the bun for its great support.  There is a roll of paper towels on the table so fear not, a little contained chaos is what all of us need once in a while.  I liked the flavors a lot.  I asked for a side of BBQ sauce and dipped a bit because it was so good.

The Cod nuggets ( i forget the price ) - tasty but small portion

Bacon Dog $3.79) - I liked it - onions would've have made it a hit !

The Big Fish Sammie ( $7.99 but made it a "" basket"" for $3 more - you get a soda, fries/chips and a side - potato salad ) - It's a decent sandwich - definitely needed more tartar sauce. and i loved the chips.  Price seems a little on the high side for what you get.

Double cheese burger ($5.49) - asked for char-broiled but i don't think i got it that way.  Bone dry burger - dire need of salt.

They are going to featured in the RJ I think she said the 23rd. 
She asked us to fill out the comment cards, she told us she listens to what the customers have to say. That is why the coleslaw is so good.

They have a whole station of toys, puzzles, books, & games. When we sat down, my boyfriend brought the Rubix cube with him to solve. We found out that if he solves the Rubix cube, we get free donuts! Such an awesome plus! (He solved it btw...& we devoured the donuts.)

I ordered the Cheesy Cheeseburger & my boyfriend ordered the Rio Grande breakfast. Both reasonably priced. My burger was HUGE. I'm a tiny girl & I could barely fit my mouth over the thing! The Rio Grande looked delicious, I didn't try any, but he loved it! We also ordered a pancake to split & it was one of the best pancakes I've had. 

I'm only giving this place 4 stars because our food took quite some time. I totally get that everything is made fresh but being pregnant & hungry...time isn't always your best friend! Another reason for the 4 stars is because I was a little upset with the way my chair kept getting bumped. It's definitely a small space. I was also a little annoyed that a party next to us had a full table plus people that were with them standing around  their table. It was totally awkward having someone's back against my head. But not the staff's fault, at all.

We went around 9pm on a Tuesday - they close at 10pm. The place was empty except for one other table. We ordered a grilled cheese with bacon and the foccacia grilled chicken sandwich. We waited about 45 minutes for our food. I really have no idea how it could take that long to make a grilled cheese and chicken sandwich. 45 minutes! I guess this is why they have games and books on the table? So, when the food does show up, the grilled cheese with bacon does not have bacon on it, as ordered...And, the chicken sandwich was not made correctly either. On the menu it says it has roasted red peppers, balsamic mayo, etc. and sounded great (and it was $12-13)... but, it came with just plain mayo and lettuce and the chicken was so thin and over cooked I could barely bite through most of it. 

We didn't bother sending anything back because we had already waited way too long and we were starving... I really wish we had just sent it back. We mentioned that there was no bacon on the grilled cheese when we asked for our check so we weren't charged for it. In the end, we paid about $33 (after tip and tax, etc) for a simple grilled cheese, a tiny chicken sandwich and a few potato chips. Like I said, I really wanted to like this place, but we won't be going back. I think the waitress - who was very nice - knew they screwed up.

1893048,2014-11-03,14,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"Recently featured as a ROTD, my BF and I came by for dinner. Prices are all over the place, with a few good deals but a lot need to come down a buck or two to be reasonable. We were one of two tables, yet our order took 25 minutes to come out and the entrée was unacceptable in quality. 

FRIED MUSHROOMS: $7 for 8 button mushrooms. Lovely crispy breading.
FRIED PICKLES: $5, overbattered and greasy but sweet-and-spicy dipping sauce was awesome.
FOOTLONG CHILI DOG: $8, shriveled hotdog looked like jerky it was so overcooked and the chili looked and tasted like it came from a can. One of the worst things I've ever been served in a restaurant. Intended to split it with my guy, but neither of us would eat anything beyond that first bite.

Our waitress noticed our uneaten meal and we expressed our dissatisfaction. They offered to box it up but not to remake it. She removed the hotdog from our table, showed it to the female manager, Kelly, (who left the scene and never returned), and brought us our check along with a comment card, stating that ""the system"" did not ""allow"" her to give any ""discounts"" but that we were welcome to leave feedback. The hotdog was still on the bill despite being sent back because it was inedible.

We asked to speak to management (who should have taken the initiative to come speak to us), and the male owner, Robert, came out and asked what the problem was.  We again reiterated that the hotdog was inedible, both looking and tasting like it was made yesterday. 

His response? A defensive, ""Well that's just like, your opinion."" Literally. His exact response, no irony whatsoever. He then went on to rant about how he's ""not afraid of bad Yelps"" and his food is made to order and if we're dissatisfied that's our prerogative and it must be our first visit because he ""doesn't give discounts.""
In the end, unable to reach a civil agreement, we were given the ultimatum to pay in full for a half-uneaten meal or he ""could comp the whole thing, whatever.""  I assume that was intended as a bluff but I simply left. 

I like their concept, but management is completely unprofessional and has no idea how to run a business or a restaurant- which was evident when they were featured on the show Hungry Investors.  Clearly they were unable to benefit from the publicity and learn from the experience- the same issues that held them back then are still here now.

The deuce next to us complained to the server about the wait time, their food came  to them a few minutes after they complained. This deuce sat after us and ordered after us. We were still waiting. From where we were sitting we could see the plates lining up to be served, the servers were in a  constant state of confusion. One server came over to us forty minutes after we ordered and asked if we needed anything we said yes our food would be great. When the food did arrived I asked the server what the hold up was she reached into her bag of excuses and said the kitchen had made a mistake with our order.

Seeing the Facebook post about Rambo's being in danger of closing, we went over for breakfast to show our support.  Unfortunately, today we had our first disappointing experience.  With the weather being so beautiful,we asked to sit outside.  They were going to clean up one of the tables for us.  We waited for 10 minutes and got impatient so we cleaned off the table ourselves.  We waited an additional 5 for someone to take our drink order.  Our waitress was very kind and apologized for the wait.  She came back with drinks and said she would put our order in right away.  We waited, and waited, and waited.  We saw some people who had parked right near our table arrive, eat, and leave, all before we got our food.  At this point, I went inside and told someone that we had been there an hour and were wondering how much longer it would be for our food.  The waitress finally brought out our food very apologetically and the man who I had spoken to, came out and told me, in a rather demeaning way, ""I checked the ticket, it was only 30 minutes, not an hour,"" and also questioned why I had not complained earlier.  I didn't quite know what to say.  I had only said we had been there an hour - I do not know when our order had been put in.  We have always had such positive experiences at Rambo's, we were truly saddened by the service we received today, especially when we tried to go to show our support.

I had the Wednesday Rambo Burger basket Special for $11, which I thought was a little steep until I got it. The Rambo burger is as good as it gets and definitely one of the best burger I've had. Sweet and tender BBQ pulled pork and crispy onion ring all between nice a bun, and it still had a really delicious 1/2 lbs burger inside. There was also some cole slaw, steak fries, and a soda. It was a struggle to get it all down, my mouth wasn't big enough for the Rambo burger.

The menu has everything.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, sandwiches, salads, burgers, shakes. The peanut butter and bacon burger stood out as something I may or may not try, just sounds difference. AYCE fish and chips Friday's nights.

Also checkout their webpage for all of their specials and coupons that you might be able to just print out and use.

I can easily see myself coming back eating, relaxing, and playing.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,7,4,4,oBgpShIVH7hhZVqCm9u_3Q

I will keep this one short and sweet. The food at this place is very average. Without a groupon that gives you 50% off, this place would be very over priced for the quality of food one is served. The food averages around $10-$13 and although that may not be too pricey, I feel as if any random guy could cook the same quality of food. 

As the service goes, from reading other reviews it has come apparent to me that neither the owner nor servers are very nice. I don't like an owner who trolls on yelp to only dismiss and refuse to accept any bad reviews (the reason why my last review was deleted). 

I will not come back to this place to stand up for those who the owner has verbally attacked. In addition, the food isn't great and won't be missed.",iYpP1bb2LN5RJaucO4Azlg,19,3,1,oqtetHIN3PyUjO-ksalnBQ

I've eaten at places with great food but not great ""spirit."" I love eating at places humming with the buzz of people, friendly servers, good music and things to look at.  Rambo's Kitchen will assault you with so much stuff to look at, even their menu will make you a little dizzy.  But I like the vibe - colorful, eccentric, warm as sunshine and playful.  There's a table at the entrance with all sorts of games for kids and adults.  I loved this place.  I entered and left it in an extremely happy mood, especially since it is very kid friendly.

I wanted to try everything on the menu but hubby and I ended up ordering the same thing - blue cheese burger with bacon. He thought it could use more grease but I loved it - very tasty stuff and I pretty much bathed it in their equally yummy blue cheese dressing so my mouth was pretty lubricated (kinky).  My accompanying fresh potato chips were EXCELLENT.  Thin crisp light slices of potatoes that could be eaten alone or dunked in their smorgasbord of dips.  The service was so friendly and accommodating that matched with the colorful place and great food... I couldn't help but bounce in my seat while eating my meal.  Seriously.

Instead you come in to find all old school 50's to 70's paraphernalia. They even have old school games spread out on some of the tables.

As for the food, I would say it was average. If anything, I say its a bit pricey just for your basic burgers, salad, etc. After going over the menu and deciding I didn't really wanna spend more than 10 bucks for lunch, I went with the pick two option of a half sandwich and either a salad or soup. I went with the shaved turkey on sourdough with a garden salad because their soup of the day choices were barley and tomato. Price for that was around 7 bucks. After I finished my food, I was actually still hungry. So I had no choice but to order home made fries on the side which were actually not bad. But now im going over 10 bucks since the fries were 3 bucks. SMH.

The total plus tip was around 13 dollars. Again if I was gonna spend 10 bucks for lunch it should be worth spending but in my opinion, here was not worth it. The only shining light was Misty, who was my server. She was spot on from taking my order to bringing it out, to refills, to getting my check, to cashing me out. She did her job with a smile. It is not her fault the food and prices were the way they were.

The food doesn't stand out as much as the decor does. I've ordered many items from their menu and all have not left me wanting more. I've come to know of this place through my co-worker. Our doctor likes to order the fish and chips from here so we  do  order lunch here once in a while. 

Last time I ate here I had ordered a Philly Cheese Steak, but unfortunately they decided to stop serving philly steak. They let me know I can have a chicken cheese steak instead. Ehhh.. I opt for it. Chicken was dry, bread was on the hard side, and fries wasn't crispy enough. I do love their ranch though. I can drink it like water. LOL.

Their menu is kind of cluttered. There is too much going on. I don't know where to look first. 

I honestly would not eat here on my own pocket, but if the doctor wants Rambo's for lunch well I guess I have no choice. Any other day you probably won't see me here.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,13,8,2,aZGbP9P_-UU-hVYORup1MA

They don't really have anything healthy on the menu so I stopped going when I changed my diet to eat healthier but I still go every now and again when I feel like splurging

They have great good and many choices for potatoes. I love their breakfast potatoes. My coworker loves their homemade potato chips. They are very generous with seasoning which is not so common these days with so many food allergies. 

Their prices are kinda high considering the menu items they offer. When I get a grilled cheese and fries and no drink, it comes out to $10. I can accept $7 for that type of meal but $10 is pushing it. 

Up until recently, I never had any problems with my order, always right and always hot and always delicious. However the past 3 times I went, they got my order wrong every time and it was the same waitress. She's friendly but her attentiveness is not the best. If I knew her name, I would tell you but I do not. The first time I had her as a waitress, I went on my lunch break with a friend and told her straight away that I only have an hour for lunch. She brought the food soon enough but she took forever to bring the check, I had to ask her to bring it. After she finally brought it, she proceeded to take 15 minutes to come get my payment. I might have understood if they were busy but it the lunch rush was ending when I got there. 

There is definitely something to be said for the atmosphere. It's a 60s diner so there's pictures and peace signs everywhere. They also have games! Yazee, Uno, trivia games, 8 ball, puzzles and many more. Its fun and fascinating.",bWpuz4YRMo5VL3Vsh64ZrA,5,1,4,kUnyjQ-RD1lxkldP9eiFdQ

Upon arrival, we immediately noticed the 60's diner feel, which was pretty awesome.  It was busy upon arrival, but we were acknowledged immediately and was told it would be about 5 minutes.  5 minutes was no biggie since there was so much cool stuff to see all over the walls.  There was also a little area near the hostess stand for classic games (even a magic 8!  I haven't seen that in ages).  

 When we were seated, I noticed a nice flat screen hanging above that played nostalgia to match the restaurant's ambiance.  I didn't pay much attention, but my seldom glances caught bits and pieces of cartoons and a clip of the 3 Stooges.

 The menu was quite tremendous in size, with tons of offerings (the walls had menu options on it as well...along with daily specials).  I ended up getting a 1/2 lb Chili Burger with homemade chips (recommended by the waitress) and a side of potato salad.  Jade ordered what I believe was called the Rio Grande.  Grande indeed!  Ordering this comes with a free coffee as well.  Look below to see how I felt about the food:

Chili Burger plate:

 This was really good.  It was made to order and I took mine medium rare.  This one definitely will require the use of utensils rather than your traditional approach to a typical hamburger.  The only thing I disliked was that the Chili incorporated the use of beans.  I like beans in chili, but not in my Chili Burger. I know that sounds a bit picky, but it's just my personal preference and figured it would be fair to give you a heads up.

 The Homemade Chips were recommended by the waitress, but there are other options:  French Fries, Steak Fries, Onion Rings, etc.  I was pretty pleased with the Chips.  

 Potato Salad:  Nothing special here.  Like the chips, there are other options.

Glass of water w/ Lemon:
 
 Oh good... no weird tasting tap water and they remembered the Lemon. Score!

Coffee:
 I'm personally not a coffee drinker, but Jade is.  When she has a complaint about the coffee, I usually know about it within minutes.  Lucky for me, no complaints!

Rio Grande:  Grande? Yes , but it's also 90% potatoes.  I wasn't really a fan of this.  It's good for sharing, but it just wasn't as great as we had expected it to be.  It reminded me of  a Hash House A Go- Go type of dish, but not. Egh, don't take my word for it...you might be a fan.  

Pros:  
 Very Good Service (quick to refill and check up)
 Very Reasonably Priced
 Diverse selection of food/drinks
 Games (we played checkers while we waited for our food..that's a plus!)

Cons:
 Very tight seating
 Was not a fan of the Rio Grande (that's just me though...try it for yourself).

Tips:
 Pick up a game or two to kill time while waiting at the table.
 Don't forget to check out the menu Wall + Daily specials =)
 Expect a bit of a wait... we luckily got seated before a huge rush (Sunday brunch)
 Try the pancakes and let me know what you think (they looked Super Fluffy)!

Overall:
 I like this place.  I definitely plan on making a return visit.  I am actually considering taking my sister to this place.  I think she'd like the food, but most of all dig the ambiance of the place. If it wasn't for the tight-seating, I would have given this place a perfect rating. ...

I have to tell you, I believe her; this was one damn tasty sandwich.  Instead of the included french fries or some other fried dish that has escaped my memory I chose a house salad which was fresh and came in a classic wooden bowl like I used to have has a kid.  The Italian dressing was decent but nothing to write home about.

Service was very attentive from the tag team duo of Tammy and Misty.  I was checked on in a consistent and friendly manner and they kept the 60/40 split Arnold Palmers flowing.  That's all I ask.

The ambiance inside was interesting; I'm not sure what the theme was supposed to be but to be honest I didn't give it much thought or attention since I was sitting outside on the patio.  If I'm ever in the area again I will definitely stop back in for another meal.

3015105,2013-12-09,0,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"I passed by Rambo's Kitchen countless times the past few years and on the way to IHOP Sunday morning with my mother and husband, my hubby suggested that we give Rambo's Kitchen a shot.  Located on S. Fort Apache in Las Vegas, this was a great down-the-street 60's diner find.  The place gets packed for lunch and dinner, but breakfast was no exception.  Fortunately, we arrived before the crowds arrived and were attended to right away.

The tables are decorated with photos of icons and postcards from the 60's. along with trivia books on the tables.  The kitchen is very small and there are a few tables inside.  It's really lively with lots of memorabilia inside and 60's music playing overhead.  The menu is fairly large for a place of this size, but we found a few items to try.

The mini donuts are fluffy and have just the right sweetness. Who doesn't love fluffy fried dough covered in sugar?  For $2 you cannot beat getting a basket of them to start.  Their waffle is soft but has great flavor, as does their french toast that is cooked coated in a waffle or pancake batter.  My mother remembers french toast being done this way in the 60's and has not seen it since then.  She loved it.  All the other options we received, from scrambled eggs to their delicious sausage links, were tasty.  My husband got creative and ordered a cheeseburger with a side of hashbrowns and an egg, which he placed in the burger to make a breakfast burger of his own.  

The servers will modify anything for you, including french toast, which my mother opted for regular bread instead of their raspberry swirl bread.  They have sugar free syrup and all sorts of options for your meal needs (egg whites only, spicy sausage, etc.).

The only negative would be the cleanliness of the ceiling items, as there was dust gently falling from the light fixtures overhead, and the fixture chain, which was coated in dust.  The same went for their ceiling fan blades and their air ducts, including the one over the kitchen, which was a dark, dark grey color from not being cleaned.  The cook also used a microwave, which I found to be slightly alarming (he used it for the meats and some eggs).

Although good food and the fact that I would love to eat here again, I'm hesitant to do so for the next few months until the cleaning is done and that microwave is tossed into the pits of hell.  I cautiously suggest that you give this place a try.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,3,0,3,vmzIWtN-IsxsxXvmNeP0Ng
3018377,2013-01-08,5,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"A co-worker recommended this place, so my sister and I went for dinner.  All in all I just wasn't impressed with this restaurant, so much so that I won't be back.

The decor is psychadelic 60's.  Well, actually, it seemed to flux from random things of the 60's, such as bands or movies, to just psychadelic looking stickers.  It seemed like they were just desperate to fill in every empty space on their walls.  It's a bit over the top when you walk in, but I can understand the fun for people that particularly enjoy that decade.  I don't happen to and even if I did like the 60's, their decor could have been way less cheesy and still been faithful to the theme.

Each table has books, toys or memorablia from that same decade, which I thought was interesting, especially since our table featured a Greatest Edition of Archie Comics, which I loved when I was a little girl.  Obviously the music they play is from the 60's and they even show muted Ed Sullivan Show clips on a large television.

When we placed our orders, I told the waitress that I had wanted a hamburger, so she recomended the special which was a Rambo Burger.  The menu didn't really give a description on the specials part, so I ordered it.  It came out with shredded barbecue beef on top and an onion ring.  I really just wanted a simple burger and had there been a description when I ordered, I would have picked something else.  Still, when I scraped off the extra meat and put the onion ring to the side, it was a decent burger.  Actually, the quality of the burger is why this review is two stars instead of just one, espcially when my sister didn't like her chicken Alfredo.

All in all, I wasn't impressed with the service and when we got our bill I was shocked when our total came out to close to $40.00.  Like I said, the food was good, but I can't spend that much in what I assumed would be a mom and pop style establishment.

1/9/2013 (Response to Owner's Comments)

If there's one thing that kinda irks me, it's the inability to quietly take a less than positive review and use it constructively instead of trying to defend youself against one person's bad experience.  I'm ALWAYS more than willing to give a second chance, and if you check my past reviews, most locations get a better review from the first time when I wasn't impressed.  This owner response was that second chance.  However, since the owner(?) was able to go into better detail of my review, I figured I would and could afford him the same courtesy.

1. Cost: I hold in my hand my receipt from Rambo's Kitchen dated 12/26/12 for the total amount of $36.36 (""close to $40.00"").  Now, even though I wasn't that impressed with the service, it wasn't horrible, so I decided to round up my bill with a tip of $3.64, more for my convenience than for the server's reward.  Hence, my bill came to $40.00.  Now, the reason for the increase in my bill is because I failed to mention the ""$5.00"" milkshake that we also ordered.  My apologies and the subject of my next issue.

2. ""$5.00 Milkshake"": I love the name of that item, all I can think of is Vincent Vega and his outrage that something made of milk and ice cream can cost $5.00.  Of course, when he tasted Mia Wallace's shake, he had to agree that it was an amazing shake.  I couldn't.  The ice cream they used must have been thawed and then refrozen, because there were crystalized parts of it that just tasted like straight ice.  It wasn't quite blended well and I'm pretty sure if I was a waitress (as I have been, so I'm speaking from experience) I would have noticed if an item had barely been touched and asked if something was wrong.  I assume this is not a policy at Rambo's, but everyone has their off day and it's not like this is fine dining.  In fact, the person that ordered this shake, took one taste and didn't touch it again, I ate more than her since I didn't want to waste an entire $5.00.

3. Quality of food: I apologize, sincerely, for stating that my sandwich contained beef, it was pulled pork now that I remember it.  I assume that I just glossed over that information and picture on the menu, so I apologize for that as well.  Now, as for the fettucine alfredo.  I had decided that I wouldn't go into detail in my original review, but fair's fair.  My sister loved it.  She brought the rest home to eat the next day.  Of course, when she woke up at two in the morning with stomach pains and spent the rest of the next day glued to the toilet, she instructed me to throw away her takeout food.  I'm not sure if it was undercooked chicken or something else, but the food made her sick.  However, I'll state it once again, my hamburger (once I had scraped off the pulled PORK) was delicious and I didn't get sick.

In summation, I appreciate the archived positive reviews that were included and wish congratulations on the patrons that enjoyed this restaurant.  I was not one of them and definintely won't be.  Accordingly, I'll remove one star due to owner understanding.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,10,4,1,WHQhdfU1JyZbjuw2tRDG6A

The staff seemed very nice and the decor is fun and very laid back, but clean and set up very nicely. 

However, the food, once we brought it home was less than stellar. The burgers were not done very well, the corn dog was completely cold (it's less than a two minute drive to our house), and the fries were flaccid, flavorless and beyond disappointing.  

The only reason this was not a one star was due to the nice service and friendly atmosphere. I suppose we'll still have to try the breakfast menu there, but as it this is not a place we will frequent for dinner again.",4yG4J05aKzE2zov0Jr37kg,2,0,2,GCw01vOXjTY_0qOXn6BqNA

First off, let me say the service was super friendly and the decor is faultless. Five stars for service, four for decor.

Now, on to the food. We ordered a serve of onion rings with ranch dip, the wife got a breakfast plate with eggs and other things and I had some sort of breaded chicken sandwich.

The onion rings were awful, only breaded on one side and so drenched in residual oil from the cooking. Rather than ranch they came with some sort of light brown sauce that looked like peanut butter but tasted vaguely of barbeque sauce. I wasn't a fan of rings or sauce.

The main meals were decent - they were what they were. OK enough and entirely unremarkable. The real star of my meal was my waffle fries which were cooked perfectly.

First of all, I've never had a bad experience at Rambo's.  I think being a groovy guy or gal is a requirement of working there, because everyone has a laid back, pleasant vibe about them.  Second, the atmosphere is delightful.  I've been to many a 50s diner, but the 60s diner is pretty unique.  I love that each table has a retro card game and a coffee table book of some kind on it - what great conversation starters!  There's even a Magic 8 Ball to play with - though it gave me some pretty upsetting answers concerning my love life last time I was there.  Outlook not so good?  Come on, Magic 8 Ball.  You're killing me.  

The food!  Oh my!  So much caloric-overload goodness!  I'm sad they no longer have their Kahuna Philly Cheese sammich - who would have thought pineapple would taste so perfect on a Philly?

I actually really liked it. I grew up listening to music from the 60's  ( my dad was kind of a hippy ). 

We started with the fried mushrooms .. these were not the ordinary little tiny button mushrooms. These were pretty large and full size.  They came with a light batter with Parmesan cheese and ranch dressing. They were delightful!

I ordered a Rambo burger ( cheese inside , burger , pulled pork and a huge onion ring ) and let me tell you , the flavor was amazing. There was not one flavor that overwhelmed the other.  The cheese was just the right amount.  It came with fresh cut fries with skin on , and i opted for the potato salad.  Fries were yummy , but i wasnt a fan of the Potato Salad.  

My wife ordered a Turkey Avocado Croissant with fries.  She was in heaven. She explained that the croissant was fluffy and buttery , the meat delectable.  One of the best she has in quite a while. 

We ended the meal with a piece of fresh made red velvet cake. It tasted like it was made with vanilla frosting ( my preference anyway ) but after talking with one of the owners it was a lightly whipped cream cheese ( can i have the recipe please ! ) 

All in all a great meal.  It set us back less than 30 dollars ( not including tip) 

Service was excellent , the waitress ( Emily ? )  was extremely friendly , knew the menu well and even offered us books and playing cards while the food was being cooked.   It wasnt the fastet food in town , but good food sometimes takes a little bit longer. 

Definitely will be back !",-B731Wh1510uXX9eC1orQQ,8,3,4,Or2pbiqoFt9R0yEu9r82jA

Had the Pastrami Rueben with provolone (instead of Swiss). Really good! Have had their pork chop dinner and some other dinner stuff entrees before, & really weren't impressed. But, have always loved their breakfast. Can't go wrong with those donuts! Almost had them for dinner....I mean tomorrow {is} Mother's Day. We'll have to go back for donuts another day; went for the chip instead & was happy about it!

Cons: Kids corn dog was too crispy, verging on burnt. Bread was too burnt w/ the spaghetti. Just have the chips, skip fries. My +1 didn't love the spaghetti/meat sauce at all. I tasted- It's exactly what you think of spaghetti/sauce in a diner type atmosphere. 

Pros: Service! Service! Service! Fast refills. Owner checked on us after food arrived.  Servers helped each other for the sake of the customer. Our server was good, comfortable & had a smile. Any problem we had was fixed so fast, it wasn't really a problem at all, so I haven't mentioned it here. That's good service!!!

You know what, though, we have fun here (with our puzzle-loving 3.5 year old) & just the two of us playing trivia! As long as food is ok & service is great, we will always stop by!",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,8,0,4,6sexLnOa38-CaOmIrxMKEw

So, it was a Tuesday with nothing better to do, so down the road we went.

 As others have commented, it is small, but interesting and packed with things to look at from back when I was young. The servers were as sweet and helpful as they could be. All the toys and games were great- it kept Little Guy entertained the entire visit, and we were distracted from the long wait, too (it helped to order an appetizer of surprisingly good chips and guacamole). I had the daily special of BBQ meatloaf with mashed potatoes and vegetables, all of which tasted fresh and homemade. Babygirl had the bacon cheeseburger, which involved not only your choice of cheese on top of the patties, but American melted in the middle, too. YUM! Little Guy lost interest in dining since it was interfering with table space for the Barrel of Monkeys and Star Wars puzzle, but they blessedly serve breakfast all day and he can always be coaxed into consuming pancakes and sausage. (His critique: ""the pancakes taste like muffins"". ? Do with it what you will)

. So, we all had plenty to eat, but as we all know, that has nothing to do with dessert, so we ordered up their special, a bizarre concoction of French toast, peanut butter, bananas, chocolate syrup, and dried banana chips. Now, if a contestant on ""Top Chef"" dared to serve this aberration to the judges, Tom Colicchio would grab him by the seat of his pants and forcibly eject him from the premises. We ate every bite. I am so ashamed. BG wants to go back for another one of those cheeseburgers. We will wear dark glasses.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,5,5,4,D_ymZTStY6Idk9sL14WB_Q

Came here on Sunday for lunch because they have free wifi, and they allow dogs on the patio. It was a beautiful day and the place was full outside (I did make reservations though), and it seemed jammin inside. It seems we were overlooked as we didn't get menu's for a while after we were seated, but once they took our order, they were quick.

They have everything on this menu. It's not anti-vegetables, as they do offer a few, but it's diner food. Tons and tons of it too. Sandwiches, pancakes, egg's, salads. Nice sized portions and a gal named Flo servin it. (just kidding, no Flo here)

I got the veggie sandwich, a grilled portobello mushroom with sliced avocado, tomato, lettuce on thick cut toasted rye with chipotle mayo. It was very tasty. It came with a choice between cole slaw (delicious), potato salad (has mustard in it, yuk) and pasta salad. Obviously, I got the cole slaw and LOVED it. Very good. My dish also came with a sliced pickle. Tien got the chicago hot dog, his came with 2 sides; he got potato salad and fries. He liked his hot dog and he didn't mind the potato salad. Got dessert, which was a lemon cake with cream cheese frosting. The cake was very moist, and tasty. They also have mini donuts for dessert and I will try those next time.

Coming up this June they will be airing an episode of Jon Taffer's new show ""Hungry Investors"" featuring my favorite neighborhood diner - Rambo's Kitchen (its actually in my neighborhood).

If I really think about it, I should be disappointed. I get the feeling that once the show airs, my quaint little neighborhood diner is going to become a little harder to get in to.

Don't get me wrong, I am happy for Misty and the crew, and I hope the national spotlight proves to be a windfall for them all - but I will miss all the special attention they give this humble patron. I hope they remember this little guy when they hit it big. :)

By the way, for those of you who thought this place couldn't get much better, they just changed their awesome homemade potato chips and now they are 'even more awesome' - thinner and crispier than before, but still as delicious as ever.

And the chips aren't the only things getting better, time has certainly helped improve their skills in the kitchen, as just about everything is tasting better every time I order it.

For those East-Siders who don't get around to our side of town very often, this is one place I promise is worth the drive. Pretty soon, there will be all kinds of people driving a whole long way to dine at Rambo's Kitchen.

I've been in the plaza several times when I was picking up Thai food nearby, but I never never stopped here.  Sunday, they open a 8 and I was there at 8:10.  A little warmer and I could have eaten outside, but it is December!

Misty was my server and she was a gem!  Very pleasant smile, lots of helpful information, lots of coffee refills.  

I ordered the Red Rock Bene which the menu describes as layers of Focaccia bread, bacon, fresh spinach, poached eggs, and homemade Hollandaise.  It's not ""layers"" of Focaccia.  Rather, there are two very large cuts of Focaccia each about two and a half to three inches tall.  I'm guessing those are the cliffs at Red Rock.  The rest was the standard Benedict except for the bacon.  The breakfast comes with choice of home fries or breakfast potatoes and if you get breakfast potatoes, you can get them plain or with fried onion and peppers.  There's a small charge for the onions and peppers, something I didn't see on the menu.

The Bene was OK.  There's simply too much bread. I ate one slab and halfway through that, I moved the other poached egg and spinach onto the half eaten cliff.  The breakfast potatoes were seasoned well and the onion and peppers were very good.  Worth the up charge.  Other than too much bread, my one complaint would be that the eggs were poached too long.  They were not runny when pierced but were semi hard yolks.

I really liked the inside.  The 60s, tie dyed things, peace symbols, and the music being played that I grew up with made for humming along with the sound track.  It was OK.  There was only one couple besides me in the place and they were at the other end so no one needed to go running out!

Hubby enjoyed the pick three and I enjoyed the chicken fried steak.  Another massive meal with 2 biscuits under the steak covered in gravy.  Yum!  

They also have great choices for the kiddos including French toast sticks and scrumptious fresh mini donuts.

Second night, had the chicken alfredo. Not good like the night before. Thinish sauce and mediocre texture on the chicken. Lots of butter running around the bottom of the bowl. Garden salad with meal was not good. Mealy tomatoes, stale croutons. Served in a sad chipped wooden bowl.

Staff is friendly. Seated right away - food pretty timely. Ambiance is pretty nice with a mostly 1960's theme including music. But tables were a little sticky. Fun things to do while waiting - card games, puzzles, coloring books.

After telling our server, she took it away and didn't come back for a while. She returned with a comment card, saying that, sorry I was told I can't discount the bill but here is this comment card for you. Upon asking to talk to a manager, she left again and again left for a what seemed like a long time. At this point I've been at this place over an hour and there was one other table in the whole place. Finally the owner came out and basically got in my face. It was almost comical. This guy actually argued with me and told me my concerns were ""my opinion"", and rambled on and on about why he didn't discount my food or came over but had the server bring a comment card. He was rude, unprofessional and it was obvious that he is the last person that should ever be in any kind of hospitality service.

I had the Chicago dog, first of all it was $5.?? and all I get is a hot dog, really? No fries included? Drink? The hot dog itself was a little too salty for my taste but the fillers made it a little better. The bun, well, my husband took the first bite and as he handed the dog back to me, the hot dog fell through the bun?! WTH? The bun was toasted so by the time it got to me, it was pretty hard so I guess that's why? I dono. Husband liked the snap in the hot dog but I don't care much for it, I like to get the food to my belly as fast as possible and the snap is kind of an obstacle haha.

When we arrived, we were the only customers there and I usually like this because then we have all the server's attention. She greeted us and told us to sit anywhere we'd like. On our table were three different things: a Monopoly card game, a music trivia book, and a huge Time magazine? (didn't pay attention to that one, sorry). They also had a bunch of vintage memorabilia decorating the whole place. Posters of 60s and 70s icons with a little kitschy vibe going on. 

They have a HUGE menu that offers a variety of diner food staples. I immediately wanted to try their Fish & Chips, and my BF got their Fried Mushrooms for appetizer and a single patty burger. The fried mushroom were hot and made to order. I'm emphasizing this because there have been times when appetizers weren't made fresh. Finally our entrees arrived and my order was as big as a new-born baby. I liked how crispy the batter was and the home-cut fries were pretty tasty. I like the thicker cut fries for fish n chips, it really feels authentic for me at least. I even enjoyed their tartar sauce that didn't come out of a jar. I didn't try my BF's burger, since I had a big basket of fish and potatoes to finish (but I end up bringing some home, even after giving my BF half of the fries). He seemed to enjoy his burger, so that's good. 

Our server was so nice, she really made the whole experience even more pleasant.

If you want to do something more exciting while you wait they also have a selection of games you can play.

I came here on two occasions the first time I had their Fried Zucchini . It was crunchy on the outside and nice and crisp on the inside. I liked that the zucchini wasn't soggy. We also had the Chips & Salsa with a side of Guacamole. The chips were kind of hard. I think it's because they are home made and they didn't fry them enough. The salsa  and guacamole were tasty though. I ordered the Egg Salad Sandwich which I thought had a funny after taste. I wanted my hubby's Crisp Chicken Sandwich instead. The breading on that was delicious! The steak fries were a nice golden brown. We ended the meal with warm mini dounuts. YUM!

I am a vegetarian and I was surprised to find there were meat free items on the menu, so I chose a cold veggie wrap. It came with a choice of two veggies and cheese, so I picked red and green bell peppers and provolone cheese, and hand cut fries. 

The order was ready in no time, and I brought the food home, and cut the wrap in half. Right away I noticed how empty it was. I expected it to be stuffed with sliced peppers and maybe some lettuce or anything... but it was just filled with diced loose red and bell peppers, and one measly slice of provolone. I am posting two photos to this page to illustrate. 

The white tortilla was plain and super burrito size,  but the whole thing had no flavor. I guess I should not have ordered peppers - had I known they were tiny diced peppers I would have ordered a different vegetable. No side dressing, nothing. I was very disappointed. I could have made a way better wrap myself. Lesson learned to not order a veggie wrap at Rambo's - if you want a really good veggie wrap go to Aces Bar and Grill on El Capitan. 

The wrap came with a side and I selected hand cut fries. They were just OK, no real flavor, not much of a seasoning. Just fries. They weren't soggy though. 

Since I did like the atmosphere and the service, I will consider giving this place another chance some other time. Maybe I will try ordering something from their breakfast menu to see if the food is any better the second time. But don't order the veggie wrap unless you like a dry, tasteless waste of $9.33. Did I really pay that much? :-(",TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ,1,1,2,6RFO1UTpQoNyb-2LT8vgyg

There was only one open table that was able to seat six and they wouldn't seat us. The hostess wanted to leave the table open ""just in case a larger party came in"", rather than seating the customers they already had. They wanted us to wait at the front for a smaller table to open up. Once we convinced her to let us have the table the hostess was extremely rude and told us with a really sarcastic tone of voice that she would get our server. We ended up leaving before she came back because the customer service was just so bad.

Having looked over the extensive menu about twenty times over, I finally decided to order a country fried steak. My partner in crime wanted some fish tacos.

During our wait, we were very much occupied by the card games on our table. I have always been fascinated with the 60s and I pretty much pointed out everything I recognized like a child would peering into a tinted glass window.

After a while, our food came. I was beyond stoked to try it and didn't hesitate to dig in. Long story short, my plate ended up pretty clean. As for the fish tacos...They were alright. They needed some flavor. We then indulged in some mini donuts and both concluded we would even come just for those. The bite sized, cinnamon-y, little balls of dough definitely made up for the lacking tacos.

Overall, Rambo's Kitchen is a good time! The food is great, and with its theme all over the place, you'll never be bored. I did come back after the first time, and I will continue to do so!",KAIG8_R5vcBt-CGUi4bkPA,5,2,4,P6p8_ce-jOJdrkS_Eu0JfA

Forgot what the wife had but she said it too, was great. The only downside is the price of the sodas. Juuuuuuuust a little high.
Yesterday i had a double burger with those GREAT fries. Tasty burger & bun. Need i say more about the fries? Wife had a wrap, but not just any wrap. She was able to actually order her wrap with what she wanted in it & got it in a 1/2 size. Just perfect. 
Next time we go, we're gonna order desert first w/ a malt, & then if we have any room left, we'll order food.

There was a young Barry Gibb (unshaven, and I didn't see that majestic mane!) singing on the telly and a burst of (basically) Retro as we strode towards our seats. Color after color, flowers, peace signs, framed posters and old LP covers pasted all over the walls. 

My galpal and I were chuckling at this one vintage meme poster that said 'I haven't had my coffee yet. Don't make me kill you', seeing as we're coffee lovers. Individual tables had either a choice of old card games, old magazines (they even had archie comics!) and board games for the kids. There's really nothing a family could say no to over here. And when you enter the bathroom, there's a life-size figure of Elvis Presley staring at you! (I'm not quite sure if that's a good thing, but it sure made the whole experience way more interesting) 

I could talk about the restaurant's fascinating decor/designs all day but it would probably be wise to move on to the food. This is where my reason for a 4 star (and not 5) comes in. The presentations were neat but the food quality itself didn't blow us away. It could've also been our food choice, which was Nacho Chips for appetizers and we shared a Peanut Butter, Bacon, Fried Egg Burger with french fries and cole slaw. For the most part, the burger was a little bland for us. I found myself lathering my fries with a lot of ketchup to give it more taste. My guess is that the peanut butter may have hindered the burger's full potential flavor, sadly enough. Our server was really nice nonetheless and the manager was really sweet. 

And I, being someone who feels like she was born in the wrong era, found myself humming along with the songs. Beatles, Peter Paul and Mary, you name it, I hummed it! And it was also a great way to commemorate another year of Woodstock happening in New York today!

@ Flame Broiled NY Steak - After our waitress forgot to ask what temperature I wanted, it would have surprised me if they got the medium rare steak right. They did, but it was still very chewy. I question why they put it on the toast, when its really too  chewy to eat it like a sandwich. I requested melted cheese and sautéed mushrooms, but it didn't do anything for the dish. Maybe if they didn't forget to melt the cheese prior to cooking, this would have been a lot better. 

@ Fries - They're just fries.

@ Chips - This included potatoes and sweet potatoes in form of chips. They're good, but need some sauce. It does cost $0.50 for BBQ Sauce. Talk about nickeling and dimeing you.

@ Coleslaw - Good and fresh ""homemade"" coleslaw. This is one of my pet peeves of mine, but if a place says something is homemade it annoys me. The prices I'm paying for, this is an expectations not a bonus. Otherwise, I would just go to a frozen food isle and just pop something into a microwave and it be cheaper. It also implies that other stuff aren't so homemade. /endrant 

The others in our group got the Rambo Burger, BLT Sandwich, Zucchini spears, and Philly Cheese Steak all were good.

The price of the items are kind of pricey for what they are. $10 for a Philly cheese steak, $9 for a BLT, and $8+ for a breakfast platter. The restaurant.com helps to balance the cost of the meal, but I rather they just  lower their prices so I don't have to jump through hoops to get the stuff at a reasonable prices.

Service definitely had issues. Our waitress was day 2 on her job, so it was understandable. Her inexperience did show when she would constantly come back to ask for something she didn't get right the first time.  This happened quite a few times. While she is friendly, she  has to learn the menu. 

The food is good, but not great. With the relatively high prices and nothing special about this place in terms of the food, I don't really see any reason to return to this place. One major high note, we were within $0.50 of meeting our requirement for the Restauraunt.com. Oh yeah!",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,1,2,3,AlCJCp7hcv-wxj1AQxdngQ

Well There were only two people we saw and we decided to go ahead and get our own since it was so busy. (please detect the hint of sarcasm in my font)

I ordered the Rambo Burger. It wasn't like the picture when I recieved it. Now that's kind of a disappointment. I also ordered chili cheese fries. Which was an extra 6.89...ok? My 11.00 burger came with fries but if I wanted the chili cheese I had to pay full price? Instead of ordering a side of chili, cheese, and onions? Well my LARGE coleslaw came in a ramekin. My coworker got a side pasta salad which comes in a one ounce plastic container? But that doesn't explain a normal size fry is more than a swallow? I was disappointed in the sides not being fried as a small lil mouthful. My burger was good. But...I expected cheese in it and I didn't get much. The server said there's two ounces of cheese in it. Nope...there wasn't maybe .5 or less of an ounce. I'm sorry I know my sizes because yes I am an expert in the restaurant industry. Unfortunately the service and the food were just ok.

4835449,2014-07-22,2,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"I saw this restaurant on Groupon and bought two of their deals.

While the service was awesome both times I came here, that unfortunately was the highlight during both visits.

Both times I came was during breakfast. I should preface this review by saying that my initial draw to this place was their menu claiming that everything was homemade. The word homemade is in the description of almost everything on their menu.

The first time I got the chips and guacamole, doughnuts, biscuits and gravy, a side of bacon that came with the biscuits and gravy, and I also ordered a side of eggs to round out my groupon. I was told I had to wait for the guac to be made, so that was promising to hear. When it came, it was such a small amount, like two spoonfuls worth that had fit perfectly into a little plastic cup. The same size that jalapenos are put in a sports events when you order them on the side. The guac was more tomatoes and onions than avocado for it being guacamole, it was more like pico de gallo with some chunks of avocado. Some salsa came with it that was pretty good. The doughnuts were okay, they just tasted like some canned biscuit dough that was fried and rolled in cinnamon and sugar. The eggs were good, probably the best thing I ate, while the bacon was particularly small, limp, and chewy.

Then the biscuits and gravy came out. Right from the jump, I knew I had messed up by ordering this. The gravy that was supposedly homemade looked nasty, like water mixed with milk with some specks of black pepper. It was so soupy with no sign of thick richness that breakfast gravy is supposed to have. Against my better judgement, I still dipped my spoon into the gravy to taste it. The bland out of packet taste was the nail in the coffin that made me order a replacement of pancakes. I didn't even get to taste their supposed homemade biscuits, but after tasting the horrendous ""homemade gravy"", I don't think I missed out on much. The pancakes just tasted like IHOP quality with a hint of cinnamon in it, nothing special.

When I came again to use the second groupon I had, I just ordered the pancakes, eggs, bacon, hash browns, and the doughnuts again. Or I at least tried to order the doughnuts, but they  ""didn't have any"". I was one of the first ones in the restaurant after they opened in the morning, how are you already out of one of your ""homemade"" signature breakfast items? I'm guessing someone forgot to pick up the can of biscuits from the store. All my other breakfast items tasted like your average chain diner food like IHOP or Denny's. I had a couple of dollars to spend for my groupon, and as I was deciding what else to order, miraculously, a different server came up and said they now had doughnuts to be made. So I just ordered them to go and settled my bill. 

With all the time they put into the theme and decor for their restaurant, they should have put some of that effort into making their menu items taste better. I wouldn't come here to eat food at full price, and I am not inclined to get another groupon to try their lunch or dinner options. The food I had was average at best. There are plenty of other restaurants in town that can actually make breakfast food from scratch that tastes good.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,5,2,2,LjTRrJgcJiyb0IKo_uEgeQ

I've been back to Rambo's several times since my original experience and have had a few different entrees, none of which was really great, unfortunately.  I think the place could use the help of an experienced chef who can give them a better selection of menu items.

This is a really neat place, aiming to be Las Vegas' first and only 60's themed restaurant.  The decor is really fun and full of 60's memorabilia/pop art, etc.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I haven't actually had the food yet - my girlfriend and I stopped in to get a couple malts.  We came in just at closing time and the owner gave us 2 malts for the price of one as a ""welcome to Rambo's"", which was very nice of him.

Waitress came to take drink order and I put in order for my child's meal and a appetizer.  She brought the drinks but then didn't return to take the order until the app and kids meal was delivered.  We ordered our food, I fed my daughter, we ate our huge order of zucchini.  The zucchini came with a small dipping cup of ranch, we were charged for the extra ranch we needed due to the size of app.  After a while I went to go refill my drink myself and ask about our food.  2 orders of fish and chips.  It had been over 1/2 hr at this point and I knew there was a issue because I could see all the staff in the corner.  I could also HEAR them talking about a lost ticket.  We were about to leave and I even told the waitress ""I just saw the cook drop in fish, is that ours?""  Wondering why it had been so long.  The waitress was sweet but clearly not trained to know how to handle a screw up.  She proceeded to lie to me and say ""it takes a while because we need to make sure the fish is cooked, and what I saw was a to go order.""  She clearly was oblivious that being the ONLY customers in the restaurant, no one came in for take out and I had a clear view of the cook.  Also its pretty common knowledge when you are ordering fried fish it only takes a couple minutes, not 30!  We proceeded to eat and before leaving a lady came over full of bad excuses... We switched staff, etc.  Well as I said had a clear view of the 1 cook who was there from when we walked in to when we left, and we had the same waitress so who knows what staff she was talking about.  She gave us a couple donuts which from what I have read is their ""apology.""   We also used a groupon, which by the way means you cannot order 1/2 the menu, no specials, etc.  Bad experience, mediocre food for the price, poor service, and penalized for using a group on.

PS.. in response to Robert.  My daughter never sat on the floor, never colored on your very doubtfully ""new"" tile.  Shame on you. She was bored to tears at the amount of time we were there, as were we.  My experience was accurate.  I watched the SAME cook in the kitchen, and our meal there took over 1 hour.  Bought the groupon on the way in and have a time on the bill.  People came in after us and left before us.  As I stated we were the ONLY table.  There was not a 7-9 nominate delay, It took 15 minutes for app, than another 30 for meal.  The waitress LIED, a weak apology was given at end with a couple donuts.  If going back there was ever going to happen, your response has changed that.  Good luck in business.",SYkJgGz0FWIsP2XmFbX0vw,12,5,1,O1G9qfRMWulwW-VT5IpOFg

The interior of the place is very...interesting. Bright, crazy all over the place, I love it! It's not that big though just about 7 tables and a little breakfast bar area. It was kind of cramped inside so we decided to sit on the patio area. There's not really much of an atmosphere on the patio.. you get a nice view of the parking lot HAHA but the weather was perfect so we had no problem. We ordered:

-Open Faced Hot Turkey Sandwich: Comes with veggies, French fries & cranberry sauce. My man loved his dish.. ate everything on his plate.. He said it was like the Bobby from Capriotti's but way better. His entrée also came with a choice of soup or salad and he got the beef soup which was also tasty. 
-Chips & Guacamole: I wasn't that hungry so I decided to just snack on some chips.. It also comes with salsa.. I thought the guac was just ok.. it could have used some more lime/cilantro/garlic.. basically some more flavor. Also the ratio of chips to guacamole is a bit off. Definitely could use more guac. 
-Iced tea: Fresh brewed plus they add flavors like peach for free.  

Everything here is home-made and if it's not homemade they let you know. The food for me was just average. I will be going back though to try some more dishes since their menu is huge. So why 4 stars for just average food you ask... our server MISTY was AMAZING... She was nice, charismatic and knew the menu like the back of her hand.

As for the staff and the service I would give a total 5 stars for that. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She showed us the specials and never let our drinks get empty. I also would give the decor a 5 star. It's filled with old record albums from the 60's and posters from that era as well. If you visit the restroom don't let Elvis scare you! They also have a ton of board and card games you can play while you wait. How could you not like that?

Now the food. I ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich that came on a buttery croissant. On the side I had their fresh made potato chips and coleslaw. I really liked the coleslaw! I'm very picky when it comes to this dish, but their version was yummy! (And was made with mayo! Yay!) I just wish I got a slightly bigger serving then a little tiny to go cup. The chips were huge, crisp and very tasty. The sandwich was good to, but just average. My husband ordered the ""Rambo"" Burger. It had a combo of chesses, bbq pulled pork and an onion ring. Which sounded delicious, but lacked flavor.

Actually only ate half and then took the other half for lunch at work the next day. The staff has always been friendly, especially Ashley who was there both times we went. She was very friendly to our kids and helped make the experience even better. The only reason they dod not get five stars is the pricing. For the burger the pricing is good, you really get what you pay for, but for other dishes it seems you pay a lot for what you are getting. The food quality is really good and so is the service, so we will be back. But, if you expect this self proclaimed ""60's Style Diner"" to be a cheap place to grab a bite think again. It is important to mention that they do have specials though out the week that seem to make the pricing much better, but they have no specials on Sunday when we usually go.",EcYPCwJtFcQ-Ih9BG6mcUA,2,0,4,cynfnQZf725ei8fGEuN8IQ

I paid and gave cash,  asked the waitress if she gave me a 5 and 5 ones,  she exclaimed yes and didn't and also gave me the wrong change.  She argued then saw I was right and didn't apologize.

Had seen the groupon a couple of weeks earlier, and the menu looked amazing, and of course the décor was right up my alley, and we decided we had to try it!  We were staying on the strip, and took a drive out on July 4th for dinner, and they were closed! Only 7 miles out from the strip.  We were disappointed, but came back on Saturday for dinner after a long day at the Grand Canyon.  We loved it.  A great menu. The décor was very eclectic.  If you wear tie dye, they offer a 10% discount.  My husband got their burger with peanut butter, bacon, and a fried egg.. He is completely a burger expert, thought it was different, and amazing!  My son, got their white chocolate, raspberry swirl French toast, and again different, but very yummy!  I got the Chopped sirloin and thought it was delicious!  Misty our waitress, was so personable!  She made us feel like family and made a lasting impression!  We ordered home made donuts for our dessert for later. YUMMM!  We loved the service and the food so much, we came back for breakfast the next day before we drove home.  Chicken fried steak and eggs were great! Moist and tender enough to cut with your fork.  Definitely a place we'll be stopping at every time we're in vegas!  Check out their menu.. the food is fresh and made to order.  It's not a big place, located in a strip mall, great outdoor seating available, and one table for a party of 5 or 6.    It was a bit warm indoors, but not uncomfortable.

A lot of love went into theme-ing this place out in a 60's vibe. The music is great and the service is nice and friendly. 

The food is so-so and the menu pricing doesn't match the menu pricing on their website...about everything is $1 more on the menu in hand.

I think the oil in the fryer was due for a change as I was at the table furthest from the fryer and I was coughing a bit on old oil fumes.

The fresh cut potato chips could be cut a bit thinner. 

The cheesy cheese burger didn't knock my socks off, but my girlfriend enjoyed her blue cheese burger. I like a toasted bun but the top bun was a little singed and it made the whole burger taste a bit dry.

I came with a groupon which made it bearable but had I paid over $30 for 2 burgers and chips after tax and tip, I'd have thought I was ripped off...a ton of these bar and grills around town put together a really good burger and fry meal for under $10 that's better than the one I ate tonight. 

In a town of buy one get one's and all you can eat everything everywhere, I'd have to think twice about returning to Rambo's thinking it's a place to get your money's worth.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,5,3,3,XxRqeE-0NO870E3kGyHlCA
5129865,2012-01-14,0,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"Simply put, I absolutely adore this joint.

The atmosphere is an explosion of late 60's pop and counter-culture. I get the feeling that it's done with earnest, happy reminiscence of the era, unlike the way many 50's diners weakly try to emulate an era. It makes me wish I were alive to experience it first hand like the owners (who will happily share their memories with you).

The service is always incredibly pleasant. On one occasion, there was a mix-up with our food and they went far and beyond what we felt would make it right. We had more food than we could possibly eat in one sitting to make up for the little mistake. And the portions are big to being with. Not cartoonishly huge like they're trying to make a name on them, but big enough to satisfy big appetites like mine.

And what great food it is! It's all wonderfully prepared in a home-style way. I've thoroughly enjoyed  everything I've eaten including the incredible Rambo Burger! My wife and I bring all our guests to Rambo's for good, fun meals, and every one has enjoyed it.

Personally, I'll take a mom-and-pop over a chain restaurant or some overblown, super glossy joint any day, for the feeling AND the food. And Rambo's is a perfect example of why.",J2zVr8lKirvoC_cIHgSlcQ,3,0,5,TC7e0r8NrJci918gz7_5fQ

Billed as a ""1960's Diner"" but far kitschier than that simple designation in both concept and execution, Rambo's Kitchen is a place I'd been meaning to visit for a while but given its location one that required an added impetus, something found in a Saturday errand after a much earlier meal on the strip with friends.  Open at 8am and myself the first to arrive just as the doors were unlocked it was to a bright room of psychedelic colors and paraphernalia that I was welcomed by a young woman named Misty and invited to sit anywhere I opted for a two-top with mismatched chairs at the room's center - the open kitchen to my left, a window to my right, Jimi Hendrix IN the table plus a deck of 'Go-Fish' and an enormous menu on it - the latter quickly navigated to the tune of an appetizer and a main plus a side with each scratch-made item prepped to order as I sat listening to The Beatles. Monkeys, and Dylan.  Beginning first with a half-dozen hot donuts dredged in cinnamon sugar for a mere two dollars as I watched the staff of one seat and serve four more tables (whilst also brewing two pots of coffee) it was after perhaps twenty-five minutes that the object prompting my visit arrived and as if to say ""good things come to those who wait"" the golden crisp Monte Cristo was a beauty; light cocoa tones and house-made strawberry preserves taking thinly sliced ham, turkey, and particularly sharp Swiss to a whole new level with each crunchy/creamy bite.  Setting aside a thin and boring biscuit improved somewhat by honey, my request with the sandwich in place of four styles of potatoes, and moving right on to dessert it was admittedly a great showing of restraint that prevented me from ordering the ""PB+B for two"" but with lemon cake and ""awesome"" brownies as the alternatives my choice became simple - the nearly 1/3 pound chocolate-on-chocolate wedge so moist it seemed only semi-solid and so rich that even half the $3 serving would suffice many brownie lovers...so long as the other half is enjoyed with an iced double espresso a few hours later.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,5,4,i0x1qBtBFK11O8xURYjOzA

I was excited about the $10 for $20 on groupon.  We got seated first thing when we arrived. Server came and got us our drinks and took our order. I raised the star to 3 stars only because the food was so amazing. The Rambos burrito was delicious and so was the chicken fried steak but the wait time was so incredibly long. I checked into four square right after we ordered our food and it took 46 minutes to come out. Waitresses were doing their best and working together which was nice to see.

5339869,2013-03-03,1,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"What a nifty concept!!! with great food to back it all up!!!

I must preface this review by disclosing that I was horribly hungover this morning when we went to Rambo's. I could barely read the menu (headACHE!) and the bright colored interior actually made me sick. BUT with some aleve and large amounts of water consumption, I was able to feel human... with Rambo's help.

Note: I read the menu wrong. In my defense, it was a very lengthy menu.  I thought the Pick 3 deal was 3 side dishes to an eggs benedict. I had no idea when I picked 3 items AND ordered the Red Rock Benedict that i was actually ordering 2 separate menu entrees (please refer to previous paragraph).

I think this place is awesome. ANY place that has a board game at the table where I can kick my husband's arse at Snakes & Ladders while waiting for an appetizer gets my vote. Breakfast Lunch and Dinner available all day is another big PLUS in my book. My husband and I are serious offenders of the ""eyes bigger than our stomachs"" cliche. He was so overwhelmed by all of the menu options. We took like 15 minutes before committing to an order. The Rambo Burger is clearly a lunch item (it was 9 am) but my husband could not resist the urge. We ordered donuts for an appetizer AND fried zucchini.... and I accidentally ordered Eggs bacon toast AND hash browns and the Red Rock Benedict. 

Right after I dominated in Snakes & Ladders (awesome idea to have game boards at the table with game pieces), our donuts and zucchini were served. how were the donuts you ask? I don't know because my husband didn't share!!! Apparently the menu clearly states that the fried zucchini was a whole zucchini's worth of zucchini - but I must have missed that part (see paragraph 1).

We ordered A LOT of food. A lot!  the red rock bene was good but -the focaccia bread had to be like 5 inches high... it would have been perfect if the slice of bread was much thinner. But no worries. the hubby wasn't a big fan of the rambo burger...he said it lacked a lot flavor that you would expect with all of the ingredients. He did finish off my bene and he really liked that. The eggs were good and the bacon was crispy. All pluses in my book.

hands down the highlights of our meal was the Zucchini and (from what I hear) the donuts. We are definitely going back because I want to try all items that are hand-battered. The hand-battered zucchini was just delicious. 

The service was spot on but, maybe a tad overwhelming a couple of times.... not with us, but a couple who was sitting next to us within earshot were definitely getting irritated by the number of times their waitress asked, ""are you sure I can't refill your iced tea"" (it was 4). BUT I really liked the staff and they were definitely on their game (nothing went without a refill) and when I asked for a refill they gave me a refill and a to go cup --- nice touch ladies.

The book of a menu that they have definitely leaves you with plenty of ideas for next time. We are definitely coming back (minus the hangover) !!!!",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,0,0,4,kX3HAfEy379SSqXfxouDPg
5345854,2014-04-12,4,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"On my last visit here, they took bad service to a whole new level. We were there a half hour before being acknowledged at our table. After ordering, we didnt get drinks for 15 mins and our food took 45 minutes!

There was a server running around like a chicken without a head, nervously mentioning how she was new there. Each time we had to encounter her we wanted to ask her where the fire was. When we inquired about our food she went to check and reported back to us in such a somber, nervous way that we thought she was going to break the news that our dog died or something. Dramatic, much? Hold it together, this isn't life or death.

The check was wrong on so many levels. They charged me for meat with my eggs, which I didn't get, and for a side of fruit (which could have replaced the meat), and extra for egg whites. My friend was charged for fruit, even though she plainly asked if she could sub potatoes for fruit. They accidentally brought her both, and charged her for both...

It took so long to get our credit cards back that we thought we could sooner leave, cancel the damn cards, and get replacements in the mail before they'd return. 

After all of this, the food was just not good enough to get me back there. Ever. This place is a circus, and a poorly staged one at that.",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,8,3,1,lfmUJd_J-EKqNXA8RcDvHQ
5355363,2012-04-16,0,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"I live down the street from Rambo's and really want businesses in the area to do well, so the Hubby & I try to get to them as often as the budget allows. Our first visit was about 2 weeks ago and we immediately loved the theme and the abundance of 60s 70s memorabilia. It's just an overall fun place and there is SO much to see and do.  Our table had cards, books, and my husband spotted a TV trivia game that he snagged when we walked in. I saw other tables with checkers, kids with coloring books and crayons, and so much more.  We made our second visit to the 70s themed diner today and I was inspired to get on Yelp to write about it. I was so sad to see negative reviews about the customer service at this restaurant because I have experienced GREAT customer service both times I have been in. The food does take a little while but my Husband and I just played games and flipped through the books they have on the table while we waited - If the food is fresh and delicious, I can wait a while for it. 

So, let's get to it... the fresh & delicious:
Both visits we have ordered the fresh doughnuts which are fried up to perfection then coated with cinnamon and sugar and served hot.  We ordered the small size which makes a perfectly sweet appetizer. 

Our first visit: Husband ordered the Groovy Deal which was a turkey avocado croissant served with fries and coleslaw. He really liked it and was impressed with the freshness of the ingredients. I ordered a BLT and added avocado.  It was also very fresh and delicious but how can you really mess up a BLTA?  I ordered a strawberry shake for dessert which was thick, yummy, and served in the can just like a diner shake should be.

Today, we strolled in around 11:30. My husband was in a breakfast mood and I was in a lunch mood which is perfect because Rambo's has many menu selections to satisfy either. I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich with crinkle fries and coleslaw.  The boy ordered the Country Breakfast Platter. My sandwich was HUGE and messy and delicious! Thank goodness for the extra paper towel roll on the table and the fork and knife that I had to eventually breakdown and use. I read complaints about the onion rings being soggy and this was not the case with the rings that topped my sandwich today.  I forced my hub to take a bite when it first came out because they were so perfect.  The fries were perfectly golden and crisp and i just put my coleslaw right on top of my sandwich. Unfortunately, I was so into my own sandwich that I did not take a bite of my husbands breakfast but the portion was HUGE and he seemed to be pleased.

One thing I will complain about - The menu and website boast 'wear tye-dye and get 10% off your meal.' I took note and was sure to wear it for my second visit. Now, I know it's only 10% off which would have amounted to just under $3 for our bill today so I certainly didn't want to have to ask for the discount but it would have been really awesome if the waitress would have noticed that I was taking part in their theme and applied the discount to our bill.  Next time I will just be sure to print out the $5 off coupon on their website to ensure a discount. 

This place gets 5 stars from me because it far exceeded my expectations of a home cookin' style joint. I will definitely be making many more return trips. We're already planning on taking the Hubby's family there for an upcoming birthday.",5Bf2aAJdmZxmkZPDxEDCMw,5,1,5,Y8NWN6dBuMfnOg3Mj50xsQ

After driving past Rambo's Kitchen many, many times my family and I decided to give it a chance. We were highly disappointed. 

The decor was fun and definitely '60s diner-esk. It was a big cluttered. Books and games on every table. There are two large bookcases at the front filled with games, books and nicknacks on it. The music is fantastic fits the theme perfectly. 

Onto the food... I figured that a cheese burger and fries is exactly what you order at this kind of place. My husband ordered the 'special' it was meatloaf. We both ordered a cup of broccoli cheddar soup before our main dishes came. The texture of the soup reminded me of pudding. The base of the soup was clearly not broccoli or cheddar! I couldn't finish my soup the texture and flavor was disgusting. The main dishes finally came and I was pleasantly surprised. My dish looked delicious. Exactly what a burger and fries should look like. The meatloaf looked drier then dry and the 'gravy' was brown gelatin. The hand cut fries were wonderful. They cooked perfectly, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I then moved onto the burger... I have never had a burger more well done and flavorless. The only thing the burger tasted like was burnt meat. 

The meatloaf was sweet for some reason? Weird. The meat was dry and crispy. 

The only reason it gets two stars is because you cant give zero so you already get one. So I really gave one star for the fries. (EDIT: I then took away another star because of the random rude comments of the owner) I won't go back. The owner asked us how our food was and I acted like I had a mouth full of food...",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,4,0,1,kwA0Z7zIqKqzuc2Yl3y72g

She provides great service, service was never an issue, the menu pulls you in...but then the food disappoints once again
 She encouraged us to try something we didn't have the last time, which we were both more than willing to do. My husband got the Rambo Dog with french fries...the hot dog is a big juicy flavorful dog, toppings are overflowing, which the bun wasn't up to the challenge but it was tasty but sloppy, the pulled pork topping once again is yummy. The french fries were bad, not sure if they tend to overcook them  or if their oil is old, but they were greasy. After serving them she noticed the state of the fries and offered to get us new ones, but we decided we didn't want another batch of  brown fries. I got the chicken breast platter (fried) with a salad and mashed potatoes...the salad was a good, the chicken looked beautiful, a nice sized piece of crispy chicken. But upon tasting it, I realized it was over salted, I determined it was the chicken, I tasted the coating alone and was perfect. The potatoes were bland, brown gravy was over the potatoes, which helped, but not enough to make a difference.
We were lucky enough to get some warm cinnamon/sugar donuts for dessert, they were yummy, it made us feel a little better about our meal.
I still love the decor, and music and games, and the fact you can have a drink to take with you. But I will not go back, unless they get new cooks.

I ordered a chicken avocado sandwich. The chicken patty was well cooked and moist but the flavor of the sandwich  was very mild/tame for what I would expect based on the description. None of my coworkers had anything really good or bad to say about the food they ordered.

The staff was friendly and accommodating and the quality of the food was decent. The environment is meticulous and detailed with lots of interesting memorabilia adorning the restaurant. However the speed with which the food was prepared and its lack of punch made my experience disappointing. The restaurant was busy when we walked in so its possible the lunch time rush had a large impact on the food preparation. For these reasons I cannot recommend going to this restaurant when its busy.

5426657,2013-01-06,0,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,Take out only: we had cheesy burger and triple burger. I would say on a scale of 1-10 the burgers were a 6. Average in taste...fries were steak - they were ok.  Got a tiny side of potato salad (too much mustard -- but I'm sure other people like it like that).  No complaints and prob would try again but next time we will skip the burgers and go for breakfast.,zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,1,0,3,eSy0wQciXeMhwZmO5LVTtA

Wifey wanted the club sandwich and was told they'd run out of wheat bread, not good, so she opted for the rye. Standard, typical sandwich and for the great price of $9.
I ordered the cheese steak sandwich. Definitely not enough meat on it as both ends had about 2"" of plain bread. The meat was very dry & cool by the time it got to me.
I can go to Putters by our house and get 3 times the meat for the same price and it comes without an upcharge for fries and piping hot.
It all adds up to us not being impressed with the food and the prices were on the high side. In Vegas when every little bar, PT's, the Lodge and Putters, serve a club sandwich & cheese steak you better make yours stand out, and theirs didn't.
Their one saving grace is their french fries are really good!",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,3,2,2,cXZhRu3jtWnjsdW0jmjeKw

There are games to bring to the table which made it really fun to entertain the kids and made it more of something to go do rather than just eat. My 6 year old wants to go back already :-) 

We ordered the half turkey sandwich and salad (basic but good), the chili ( not as chunky as I like but she loved it) and the pb and j with homemade chips. The pb and j was awesome, the sourdough bread was very good but a little too thick of slices for my taste. The chips were a little too thick and salty but again she loved them and I'm probably a little picky. 

We'll definitely be back with the whole family and maybe friends!",LOm5-jJhZollxsgD7MiBjA,0,1,5,m6IFq3fDZq_IjZozmnu8Mg

What business doesn't know the password.  It is now 1/9/13 and they still have not corrected their error.  How does 3 lunch specials and fish tacos end up being charged $83.11 when it was only around $36 or so.  That difference of money was one of my kids' Xmas presents.

5735046,2012-11-26,0,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"Pretty cool place. Totally busy menu (I took 3 panoramas to get it all). It's a diner like in the olden days so it's very cozy and nice. The walls are decorated with all kinds of posters and Beatles stuff. It's very busy, as I would call it. The chairs also have soft pillows on them so when you sit, your butt's very comfortable! ;)

Service was pretty immaculate. Misty was VERY attentive and she lets you know all the specials that they have. She also recommends different stuff for you so if it's your first time (like it was mine), you might appreciate it. There's a lot on the menu, though, so it might be hard to decide. I came with a friend via a groupon deal so that was pretty helpful. They also have different specials for each day of the week and that's all in their menu as well. So take a note of it for your next visit!

Our portions were huge! More than what we expected and we barely finished half the food before we were full.


ORDERED:
The Monte Cristo ~$12
-- Huge portions and inside is stuffed with ham, turkey, and Swiss cheese. Pretty yummy.

Country Breakfast $10.29
-- It was covered with gravy but underneath all that are your eggs, sausages, & biscuits. Wasn't anything particularly special. Pretty typical.

Chili Cheese Fries $8.29
-- Pretty even amount of the beans and chili and all that.

Service really stood out since they were pretty attentive. Lots to try here that makes you want to come back for future visits. And we came around 1:30pm but their menu is for all day. I really like places that offer breakfast food at any time of the day :)!",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,0,4,42I8R1mIOCeiwBlCANtd3A

5877028,2013-10-02,4,w0XjeV4WIUskQy8wwQf40w,"I came in thinking it was going to be a military/combat theme restaurant (Rambo is the name of the owners pet dog) but If you are looking for a 60s era flashback you need not look any further. 

They are grooving to the hits of the 60s and even the early 70s. The decor is a collection of hippie memorabilia and it was enjoyable going through the store and having fond memories of my childhood pop up and make me laugh; Like the first time I heard that song I was doing...

The menu is all over the place and that concerns me because I want this place to succeed. I really hope someone is able to convince them to narrow their scope a little bit.  I'm sure they are throwing a lot of food away at the end of the day as they make everything from scratch.

I'm getting of my soap box now to tell you they are serving all homemade products and you can tell. The fried mushrooms are the best I've ever had and you can tell they are made fresh.

The Pork Chops are the second best Pork Chop I've had since moving to Vegas. Their Potato Chips are hand cut and made to order. I don't normally like those kind of chips but they were delicious.

The wait staff was friendly and not pushy or overbearing. Gave the tables time to talk, enjoy each others company and enjoy their meals. 

My GF didn't care for the music selection but loved the food. Asked if we could eat outside the next time we patronize them so she didn't need to listen to the music. 

Wear your tie dye for a discount and make sure to ask for one of their ""special"" 1970 style brownies... I kid but they are delicious.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,8,4,5,lmOL475TybVwjGIQ6nqBMw

This is a cool little 60's themed diner that has all the throwback decor. Old books, games, memorabilia, posters, and they're everywhere! I'd say its a little overkill, but in a good way. I like it! The food, honestly, is not that special. At all. (or at least what I had anyway). I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was super bland. Not much seasoning at all. Which, now that I think about it, ""why am I giving it 4 stars?"". Oh yeah, because its such a rad place to go and hang out. Maybe the decor distracted me from the food...

Well the service was pleasant and polite, but straight away my wife and I were weirded out by the taste of the water, then the Coke. It was the ice! Something wrong with it, and no idea what....just tasted funky. Got some more soda with no ice. Problem solved. 

Ordered the AYCE fish n chips (with fresh cut fries) comes out with chips. Back it goes. My wife notices that the chips have been taken off and the fish is sitting there. (Forgot to mention...small restaurant with open plan kitchen. Quite warm)

Food comes out WITH fries. Yay! Fish is still hot. Double yay! Short lived. 

Neither the fish, the batter, nor the fries were seasoned. The fish and the fries were cooked well maybe even good, tasted.... ""Meh""
