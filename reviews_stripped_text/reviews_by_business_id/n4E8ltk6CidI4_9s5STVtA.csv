105619,2016-06-18,1,n4E8ltk6CidI4_9s5STVtA,"The customer service was horrible and the food was only mediocre. My friend and I ordered a 21st Century Burger, an Oink Moo Squeal Burger, and an order of Bacon Cheese Fries and the total came out to about 45 dollars. That is pretty pricey considering that the burgers didn't even come with fries on the side like every other place normally does. 
The waiters did not once check up on us, but we saw that they checked on other tables multiple times. The only time the one waiter ""checked up"" on us was when she gave us the check and asked us how we were doing. By then, we were already done eating so there was no point in that. 
I used a Groupon for this meal, so I showed them the code on my phone. One of the workers took my phone with her for about 10 minutes and walked around the whole restaurant back and forth with it. That was unnecessary when she could've easily used a pen and pad and write down the code. I wanted to ask for my phone back multiple times but it seemed like she was purposely ignoring my table when I tried to ask for it back.

432576,2015-03-16,0,n4E8ltk6CidI4_9s5STVtA,"This review is for the brand new Prime Burger at the Venetian. I believe this is the 2nd weekend its been open. For 4 burgers, 2 shakes, 3 salads = $120 without tip. 

The 4 members of my party went out for burgers on a Saturday night. Shortly after 7, we arrived to small half empty dining room. The atmosphere reminds of an Italian cafe - I thought it didnt fit the burger concept.  The tables and chairs are made of wood. In the back of the restaurant stands an open kitchen - so there is not much of a back of the house. 

The menu offers about 6 burgers and a number of sandwiches. There are a few salad options to cater to the vegetarians as well. The menu offerings remind of another burger place in Vegas called Holsteins. They offer similar burger combinations and boozy milkshakes. The menu states that burgers are made of prime rib meat and chuck and those products are ground in house. 

For this visit, the service was great. We had 2-3 individuals servicing the table. 
Our milkshakes and salads arrived first. The Caesar Salad was not spectacular but it was of great size. The price was $6. The salad was soggy with the amount of dressing it came pre tossed in. The croutons were typical store bought. I wouldn't order it next time. The Kale Thai Peanut salad looked ok. 

I ordered the 21st century burger. Average at best. The burger patty temp was hot and prepared as requested. It looks they cook their burgers on a flat tap which typically leaves them much greasier in my opinion.  I order the artisan Brioche bun. The flavor of the burger was ok just very greasy. 

We also ordered an onion ring tower - $9 WAY overpriced but it was good. It comes with about 6 HUGE onion rings and dipping sauces. I thought the rings were OK - standard - but did feel that price was too high. 

I gave this place 2 stars. There are a TON of burger places on the strip. I have been to about a dozen of them. This place doesn't quite compare to others on the strip. The price is expensive for what you get and the quality at some of the places is far better. This restaurant also lacks atmosphere.  The staff is here is very friendly and attentive however.",9-7sORMHZXNt11JMZqnrdw,4,0,2,96dYkO-ttxiNKjcitAk3Qw

We are sitting here with empty beer bottles, finished food plates, and empty water glasses. I was late joining my group and we tried flagging the server down so I could look at a menu and she just dropped off the check. Someone else figured out I needed a menu when I announced it loudly and mildly rudely. I haven't seen this server smile one time at any table she's served, but I have seen her approach her other tables to ask and refill water. I don't even know her name but all I know is her attitude is horrible. It put me off from ordering, but I finally caved in and had the onion rings. They were heavily breaded but tasted good. They were skimpy on the dipping sauce but I'm sure if I had another server I could have gotten more sauce.

The 2 shakes took about 30 min because the new bartender didn't know how to make them and had 2 wait for the manager and our waiter had to show him how to make a margarita also.

Last night we went to see my visiting parents at the Venitian and we were all hungry so decided to go to the food court to please everyone's different palet.

After looking at the different menu options I decided on a bocca burger and fresh cut fries at Prime Grill.

While I was waiting at the bar for my to go order, I heard a a sound of something dropping on the floor and quicky looked right as the line cook put  something back on the edge of the grill . 

A little worried I asked nice woman behind the bar what dropped. I couldn't tell if it was the burger press or the spatula. The lady said it was the burger press.
,i was shocked .. 

The line cook or chef didn't even put it away to be washed. She put it back on the edge of the grill. 

So I stated , do you know that fell and your cook put it back, she said yes , it happens , not allot but it does , so I said . you know it is a health hazard. I said I have worked in the kitchen and owned my own restaurant and my husband is a chef . and that is unacceptable.
About 5 minutes later she moved it it away . 

But as I was eating my food I kept thinking , what if the spatula fell on the ground  or my food , would they just out that back on the grill ?? 

If I had not of said anything and complained would they of replaced it at all ??,

UPDATE ..

THE owner Robb , personally repaonded to my post and was exrremely nice .. And went over board in his apology. VERY RARE , for a owner to respond.

Me and my friends were looking for a cheaper burger spot. Just a good lo key place.  Something different. I researched some places for burgers in the Venetian. Primeburger came up. Said burgers with a twist. Figured why not I'll give it a try. The best way to describe prime burger is reasonable prices food! But higher end look and taste. Burgers were from $12-20 depending on the model. 

We called to make reservations. The girl on the phone said we can just come in. If you have not been to the Venetian. Getting to primeburger is like a maze. Soo confusing. Def worth the walk tho. When we arrived there was one table left. Our waiter was very nice. Had a convo with us. The first night we ordered burgers. Before we recieved our burgers. We ordered the app of loaded pulled pork nachos. The pulled pork is sooo good here. They fresh fried the chips. All of us could have ordered the nachos for a meal. Sooo good. 

But the burgers. Wow. I usually go to Holsteins at the cosmo for burgers when I'm in Vegas. So it was not expecting much  My friend ordered the BBQ. This thing was crazy. It had a burger. Pulled pork. brisket. Bacon. Grilled onions and was loaded with BBQ. For $18. My friend only ate half. It was big. I ordered the burger with kale and bacon jam. I ordered it med. the kale was very nice. But the burger was juice Central!!! Sooo juicy. Melted in your mouth juicy. Cooked really good fresh ingredients. They have spiked milkshakes. We just drank water. We had been so thirsty all day. 

Overall. Primeburger blew my expectations. Sooo good. We are here 3 times. It was good. I will def be back here next time I'm in Vegas. I recommend anyone to come here. If you are looking for a solid meal that does not break the bank. 

PROS:
- friendly staff
- free fries with Yelp check in 
- cost effective 

CONS:
- hard to find location. Venetian is a huge confusing hotel",s6lIsLlPcjaHDhXxTV9kKQ,9,6,5,9RYSz3TWqD_Ge9a8RI6wQA

Rosa, the hostess, was excellent. Fun, friendly, and helping out the servers whenever she could.

She did what she could, but the handoff was unexplained.

During this handoff, much of my order was bungled. The garnishment for my drink didn't make it to the table and my brioche bun became whole wheat. While not what I ordered, no one came to check on me for a length of time so I just ate it.

In terms of the food itself, my Italiano burger was ok. I was warned in advance that the mozzarella and marinara would come cold but I went with it and did enjoy it. Sadly the prosciutto was very fatty--some of it was almost inedible.

With so many burger places to choose from , Prime Burger is way above the norm .
You can literally taste the freshness with every bite . The beef is succulent and juicy , the bun is soft but not chewy and the milk shakes should be called liquid gold .

Okay, that might be a little harsh, considering I didn't have the service issues that seem so prevalent in other reviews, but it was hard to find anything great about my burger. I got the Frenchie (gruyere, swiss, fried egg, onion relish, grilled onions, frisee, dijon mayo, $15) and it was rather plain tasting- burger was closer to medium than med-rare, I wasn't asked my bun preference (brioche for the French burger should be a given), and there was no wow factor. The dijon-mayo and onion relish were nearly nonexistent, burger had a very one-note flavor profile. When a burger is $15, it should at least be perfectly executed even if the toppings dont work well together.  On the plus side, they have a Yelp check-in offer for free fries ($4.50 value)- they're thin cut, crispy, and salty, and portion is large enough for the table to share.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,15,3,spJKuk6ZNirB_F1QklAVRQ

2163155,2015-05-26,3,n4E8ltk6CidI4_9s5STVtA,"Your typical gourmet burger joint in Vegas: overpriced. Located inside the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes, they say they are owned by the same folks as Johnny Rockets and use ""fresh prime Angus beef that's never frozen."" Do I buy that or not...who knows?

FYI, The menu is not very combo-friendly. An order of a burger does not come with any fries. You have to order the fries separately as the burger only comes with a pickle slice and a small cherry tomato).

Anyways, I got the Cali Club burger on a brioche bun and I'd have to say I've definitely had better ""boutique"" burgers before. The burger was very dry and didn't have that special sauce that typically accompanies burgers. Maybe I overrated having an avocado in my burger. Sounds better on paper than it tastes. I had a bite of my friend's 21st Century burger and it was much better. The fried egg in the 21st Century gave it a distinct and unique taste that was quite delicious.

We got orders of fresh-cut fries ($4.50) and a tower of onion rings ($9). I was not a fan of the fries. If you like small and skinny fries, this is something you'll love. However, I was a fan of the onion rings...really big and crispy. Goes great with ranch. If you're a fan of spicy, you can even ask for spicy ranch.

The service was pretty bad. Yes, they have only been open for a few months but the servers did not know what they were doing. She messed up our drink order and our food took FOREVER to come out.  That might be an understatement. Not to mention, it all came out at different times. 1 burger came out, then an order of the fries, then another burger, then the onion rings, etc...Whatever request we had for our waitress, we had to ask multiple times...

Tough gourmet burger crowd in Vegas nowadays. With the price I paid, I'd rather go to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR or even Shake Shack. You definitely pay a high price for convenience.",juJS5_I5IGzMveRKNBwEVA,9,3,3,hsH_VBWUn4vKEAqzO6t8Cw

The BEST BURGERS we have ever had. First of all, it took us 20 minutes to to choose which gourmet burger we each wanted. Such a great selection.They all sounded so good and different than any other burger we had tried before. We all selected different burgers and shared them. They were all incredible! You could really tell that they were made with quality, prime ingredients.

And that's just the burgers. We had three appetizers: Barbecue Nachos, Onion Rings & Chicken Wings. We loved everything! But, we were not done, we also each got a handmade shake. Best of all for the adults, they have shakes with alcohol. I had the Kahlua Mudslide. It rocked.

Don't get me wrong, I love a great burger just like anyone else, but the fries, the onion rings and then of course the alcohol loaded shakes.  I got the 21st Century burger with grilled onions, bacon tomato relish, gruyere cheese, lettuce greens and a fried egg. The burger was ultra juicy and prepared just the way I like it, medium rare.  We tried the fries and they came out piping out, extra crispy and free with your Yelp check in. We also tried the panko crusted onion rings.  Very thick onion rings and the batter is on the thicker side as well. If you like a lighter, crispier onion ring like Fatburger, you may not enjoy these.  The onion rings are frozen and not made fresh, but overall still very tasty. We decided on the hot brownie with ice cream topped with fudge sauce and a dollop of whipped cream for the finale. The brownie was tasty, but definitely a lot of food.  The burger wasn't cheap at $15, but the quality was there.  i would return to try another burger down the road.",bvryrBoqfM_LDEN1boxjBg,7,6,4,r8OkVmaTcp8xUrsDpS9a5A

2594245,2017-07-18,0,n4E8ltk6CidI4_9s5STVtA,"Fantastic burgers!! This was my husband and my first time here, and we are so glad we tried it! We always have a difficult time finding good, reasonably priced places to dine on the strip, but finding ourselves on the strip and overly-hungry at 8pm from not having had dinner yet, we decided to turn to Groupon to explore possible options, in hopes we wouldn't have to pay an arm and a leg to have a decent meal on the strip. We stumbled across a deal for PrimeBurger, and decided to give it a try. It was easy to find, and we were happy to see there was only one other couple dining there when we arrived, so we were able to get right in. The dining area is pretty small, but it doesn't feel cramped and they have booths and tables & chairs. The hostess greeted us with a smile and gave us the option of a booth or table (worth a point in my book). The atmosphere is nice and relaxing-a refreshing break from the loud hustle and bustle of the strip. Our waiter was super friendly and very attentive. We each ordered a burger with fries and were surprised with how quickly it was brought out. The burgers are good sized, and the fries portions are huge! Our burgers and fries were hot and very flavorful. I especially liked that the servers bring ketchup, mustard, and mayo bottles to the tables, as I like being able to choose how much of each I want on my burger. I also enjoy having mayo on my burger, but I don't like paying the extra charge most restaurants want for it. So this was great! Both my husband and I said our burger was the best burger we have ever had. When we presented our Groupon to our waiter, he smiled and told us it made him so happy to see we had a Groupon, as he now was beating another waiter in the amount of Groupons they processed that day. It was refreshing to see this, as usually when we present our Groupons, the servers look at it with disdain and begrudgingly take it to subtract from the bill, so we appreciated his good attitude about it. Friendly, attentive servers, a clean, quiet dining area, huge portions, and great tasting burgers- we will definitely be back!",y4aEhXdfKAX8klEvOszSCA,0,0,5,iu3MlTET46B4ziR9BpSpvA

The burger was just ok. The brioche bun was very soft and had good flavor, that was a plus. The meat was cooked right as I ordered it, but it lacked seasoning. The bacon looked like good quality but it was chewy. They added avocado, mixed greens, and I think thousand island. The mixed greens should be replaced by normal lettuce in my opinion.

While it is called ""Prime Burger,"" there is really nothing prime about their service, quality or quantity.  Having gone in with the desire to have a burger that is unique from the fast food venues, what we received was truly not different. Below describes the various elements:

Service:  The service is truly lacking.  The hostess, who provides seating for customers, does not always do so in a polite manner.  We had to wait, even though there were several tables available, and finally put in a minute spot.  We would view many customers requesting a seating and not even be to allowed enter despite a volume of available tables.

It appears the manager of this site was pulling trash cans past the tables of those who were eating.  It is one thing to clean and dump.  However, it should not be done within that realm while customers are eating and drinking.

Waitress: Our waitress was hardly kind or considerate.  We gave our order and asked for water to drink.  She would go here, there, and everywhere but never bring the water to us. We finally had to remind her for what we asked.  When the food came, she never brought any sauces to add to the burgers and fries.  Again, we had to ask for them.

Quality and Quantity:  When you go to burger sites like ""In and Out,"" you are provided a quality hamburger for a reasonable price (usually in the $3.60ish range). PB's $11.00 standard hamburger is hardly worth the price or taste.  There is nothing unique and delicious.  The burger has a large bun, small meat, and messy veggies (the grilled onions were hardly chopped and they kept falling out as you took a bite from the burger.)

The fries were put in a cup but hardly tasted unique.

Plus, my wife had asked that the cheese be put on the side.  She was brought it on the plate and it was spoiled.  She called the waitress, who said ""Are not going to eat it?""  My wife said ""no.""  She was never brought back a fresh piece (see the picture for her frustration).

Bottomline:  To pay $28.00 for two regular burgers and an order of fries (and the lack of service) is hardly prime.  Would not recommend and will never return based upon what we described.",5PS5khuAaN7nKAbFkyfzPA,5,0,2,dxQ2oELSz4b_-t5Oa60uDQ

Well, the strawberries had a distinct taste of onion, I had others taste it to make sure it wasn't just me, it wasn't.

Though my server greeted me with a smile and took my order quickly I never saw her again...until I got my card out. She forgot my beverage. Water...which, isn't that just a given anyway at most places? And it isn't even as though she asked someone else to deliver it to me. No. She was happily avoiding me. I tried three times to get her attention but to no avail. I had to stop someone and ask them to please give me some water. I thought she would come back and offer me the lemon I requested or even a straw...nothing fancy, just the basics. But no. Again, I had to stop someone. When someone else came with my food sans the sauce I ordered I thought she would come by and do a table check. Nope. I had to stop someone else.

Free delicious fries with Yelp check in!

My BF got the spicy burger medium rare but it came rare. He doesn't usually like well done burger but he said it was way too mushy like it was and actually really liked my burger. I was sad for him because he chose it as a quick birthday dinner. [We went to Ramsay's Burgr to make up for this meal later so it wasn't a total loss for him! :P I like Prime Burger MUCH more.] In any case because prime uses a duo of beef cuts, opt for more well done if you don't want a super soft burger. We didn't complain about rare vs med rare, so we have no idea how they would have fixed it, but I bet they would have recooked his burger. Service was overall very friendly and helpful. 

I ordered my burger well done and it was the best burger I've had in years. Tender and juicy, not excessively fatty at all. I got the one with bacon and pulled pork. My only gripe is that the pulled pork wasn't a clean pull and had huge gooey lumps of fat. I opened my burger and had to scrape that off. Bacon was also more flabby than crunchy and I'm a crunchy bacon gal. I would order a regular burger next time and be happy I think. It wasn't a total loss because my fiancé inherited my bacon and we used the pork (after I cleaned it) to make delicious pork+fries+pickle bites.

Don't bother with the alcoholic shakes as they had zero discernible alcohol and were mildly pricy for what you got. 

Something is off with their soda machine. I tried Dr Pepper and it was WEIRD. Tasted like diet almost but not quiet? I replaced it with a cola and it was also really off tasting. Hope they get that tweaked and fixed.",noY3yU_h40qeo-hkXGb4CA,2,1,4,jkQ-sAIC4dpk5d6ULxepwg

The filet looked and tasted like a top round steak.  I also ordered 3 milkshakes, 2 vanilla for the kids and 1 of the alcoholic versions for myself.  They only filled the shake cups half way. I told the manager the shakes should be filled to the top and he asked me if I paid for 1 shake but had them split it in 2 cups, I said no. Then he said they put a lot of alcohol in it and that is why they are small and expensive.  I explained to him that they were for my kids so there was no alcohol in them.  His response was conversation ending rude ""Well, It's Vegas"".

I was shocked because I had never been to a restaurant that was out of food on a normal day... let alone a restaurant in Vegas. We were already seated so we decided to just order lunch; I ordered the Mahi Mahi burger and it was no better than airport food. It tasted like a burger I could get at an airport bar/restaurant. 

I would not recommend going after 10:15 for breakfast, as it seems they run out of food. If you have the opportunity, try a lobster roll from the restaurant across the walkway.",SQlErHK-qq8rrRZe1eMCzQ,1,0,2,gjJFKcGsKHj_qQuEEbN29A

I walked the Strip looking for lunch. After sitting down in one burger joint and being ignored for 20 minutes it dawned on me that I didn't check my bookmarks in Yelp. Lo, one of my Yelp-amigos had written about Primeburger and I had bookmarked it. A quick look at the map and it was clear that this restaurant was only 1 km away and so WHOSH!, off I go. Well it wasn't really whosh because I kept getting Pokemon alerts and picked up about 25 creatures on the way. 

The walk was worth it. I had the Hawaiian 5-oh burger and at the waitresses recommendation the ""Mudslide"" alcoholic shake. Add to that the fact that you get a free order of fries by checking in with Yelp and Oh Yeah, I was in burger heaven. 

Service in Primeburger is awesome. Angel and Pricilla took good care of me from beginning to finish. I also noticed the kitchen crew was having a good time which means a lot to me.
