989357,2015-10-10,1,TDL9WXyjmBGGxl9yfbQ89w,"Wanted to grab a quick bite of food here while shopping and made the mistake of ordering at this place... It's absolutely disgusting. I ordered my food because it looked fresh when I saw others getting their food. The food had no taste and the Spring Rolls they serve are foul, they taste like the frozen garbage you buy at Wal Mart in the frozen section - actually some of those taste better than this. They probably got those Spring Rolls on Clearance somewhere because they tasted to grotesque. There is no other word for it - it was THAT BAD. Save your time... Go to Panda Express across the parking lot, at least you know what you're going to get. They show Fried Rice on the menu however when we ordered that they said they didn't have enough for two orders after I had already paid. I was then offered an extra spring roll as compensation for them not having fried rice. They can't just fry up some of the regular rice? 

I went to the counter after I started eating the food to let the girl know that there food is pretty nasty, she didn't seem to care. She did not offer to take my food back. I asked for teriyaki sauce since the chicken I ordered was pretty bland. The girl the offered me a .50cent refund which was the upgrade charge for the fried rice that you don't have. I didn't  want a refund, I want you to acknowledge that your food taste like absolute garbage. While talking to the cashier, She didn't really want to get off of her Facebook and make the situation right. I could NOT even eat the chicken, every bite I felt like vomiting. 

Your menu looks so nice yet your product taste like shit. Here's some advise... Take some money from your cash register and go eat at a Teriyaki Madness or Samurai Sams and see the product they put out -  If you can come close to that then your food will be good and your chances of having good Yelp reviews and word of mouth advertising will be much higher. Since eating this trash you served me that you call food, I seriously want to vomit. After eating this horrendous food, I did tell at least three mall employees that your food is absolutely disgusting -  the people I told had not eaten at this establishment and most likely won't. 

The food on 10/09/15 @ 7:00 p.m. was wretched. I am very surprised that some people have given this place a decent rating as the service I received was BELOW UNSATISFACTORY. Don't spend your $7.99 on this bullshit (7.99 is not a lot however it's a lot to pay for absolute shit),take that 7.99 over to Panda and get some food that tastes like something you want to eat. 

They get the ONE Star for the Fuze Raspberry Iced Tea / Coca Cola products. Everything else belongs in the dumpster out behind the mall.",aiOp4lhnH-nezm6PqX4VcA,0,0,1,DRGCwmqskL-AKIw1fBzUvA

TEPENYAKI oh my favorite. Gimme a plate with tepentaki chicken with shrimp and noodles and I'm there. 
The young gentleman taking your order and running the cash register was really friendly and nice. He asked if I wanted veggies I said I no thank you.

Next I wait for our order to be cooked, bnb I was so hungry from so much shopping so I I ready to grind that plate lunch.  I watched the guy cook about 5 orders before me everything looked delicious. Chicken, steak, shrimp and noodles oh my. My mouth was watering from waiting I heard my number 85 and i was ready. I forgot ti even take a picture of my plate but I got another picture of a chicken plate with rice. 

Ordering noodles is an extra charge I didn't care we don't have this back home. 

Food was delicious. Staff are friendly.",IVyQ9FDHed41xgMj9C6yGQ,16,19,5,ABhQBLpz-cqsXYxdOVWUVg

One order is plenty for two people and only costs $12 including small drink. Cooked fresh, and people are friendly.",J8I2XyDkxEWJm01uPWzLxg,0,0,5,BwpAg15rvb9BlXTumSyFBg
2055439,2017-01-31,0,TDL9WXyjmBGGxl9yfbQ89w,"Got the Teriyaki chicken plate and Beef Udon. The chicken was cooked well and had decent flavor, however the strips of chicken put out were paper thin and not very appealing to eat.  The vegetables that accompanied the dish were OVERLY salted and tasted more like they were boiled in a pot of sea water rather than steamed.  Likewise, the udon noodles were way too salty. Presentation of the udon was nice as it came with sliced beef, hard boiled egg, bamboo, green onions, fish cake, and a piece of dried seaweed, but unfortunately the overall taste of the noodles was too salty and ruined the dish for me. Japanese udon noodles are never supposed to be that salty...the broth yes, but noodles? Never. I give this place a 2 star rating solely on the efforts of the teppan cook.",nqhwcj0DBMo5Yn7aviestw,0,0,2,d1xlz8STQyvh3JERJEbe3Q

Decided on shrimp tempura udon but most people were ordering the stir fried meat.  I felt like something comforting but had to wait as they had to cook the noodles. Got 3 shrimp and 1/2 hard boiled egg with bamboo shoots, green onions and udon",3gq1d-Qiyajk5TWq9jNytA,8,7,3,quRMi938CaEV1XIiEDGe4w

3357771,2015-03-01,0,TDL9WXyjmBGGxl9yfbQ89w,I decided to try this place out since I typically like teppanyaki ave fast food teriyaki restaurants. The food looked alright and the selection wasn't very good. I ordered the steak and it was pretty enjoyable. It reminded me of the technique used to make Chinese steak more tender (not a bad idea). I would eat here again because I enjoyed my meal and also because the service was good as well.,UZgYI5HEamlQunGmejLltA,0,0,4,isLUrutL5QdBjz7B_34Ikw

3634583,2016-08-12,1,TDL9WXyjmBGGxl9yfbQ89w,I was early getting in to Vegas and wanted to pick up an item I knew I could find in the mall. It was also midday and I wanted what I thought would be a light lunch. It was really enough for two people and I could not finish all the rice. a plate of rice and steamed veggies and a large pile of teppan grilled teriyaki chicken on top. I knew I was in trouble from the weight of the box when it was handed to me. The food was OK. The woman who waited on me was pleasant.,Z128ihQea7BLPh2T9q9sKA,5,2,3,3wRfVXGyM2YiwE996RVZyw
3762362,2014-12-24,1,TDL9WXyjmBGGxl9yfbQ89w,The teriyaki chicken was pretty good.  They were a bit stingy with the amount of chicken. The vegetables took up a lot of the space in the container. The beef udon  was okay.  Would come back again if in the area.,XUEwSGOGARxW-3gPiGJKUg,1,1,4,WIJ_XV-q95pKi8U5p2pSwQ
3886562,2016-05-26,0,TDL9WXyjmBGGxl9yfbQ89w,Food was great. Only reason why I rated it a 3 star was because the person that made our food was constantly on his cell phone. To me that really isn't sanitary and very bad for business if he's doing it in plain few of the paying customers. He has black spikey jersey boy type hair with earrings on. Next time put your phone away.,08YC3f1Gsr1mPeuu27oLow,0,0,3,j1-LdK7sq4j5bwmf7ccbEA

The ramen is a hidden treasure since most people will only notice the teppanyaki grill, which was also quite good and freshly prepared to order.  It was a nice change from typical mall food.

Service was great offered samples and there is a noodle station if you are interested in a hot noodle bowl.  Super simple menu with a beef option or add shrimp.,b3tK3CkLOfrWpSuvn9Yo1g,0,0,5,URpH7Y1aNPs0qwLAOye6Tw
