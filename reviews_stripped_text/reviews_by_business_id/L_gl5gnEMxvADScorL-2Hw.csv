I ordered a dry spinach egg white omelette with a little feta and it was one of the best I've had in Vegas. Just had a great spice on it. I asked for avocado on the side instead of potatoes and toast and they accommodated me. No brewed iced tea w/free refills - just bottled tea, which was a negative for one of my lunch-mates.  My other colleague loved the steak and eggs -- a great deal at about $5! Dinner/lunch/happy hour menus all look great too.  Seemed a bit smoky the first time I was there, but it was fine at lunch-time today. Highly recommend this place.

It is walking distance from the MGM Grand.

The exterior is not representative of the interior:  granite counters, new bar stools, a lounge area, two nice pool tables with enough room to play.

The bartenders we had were HOT.

619192,2013-10-01,1,L_gl5gnEMxvADScorL-2Hw,"Wow. Went in there for lunch today and it was awful. 

Service was SLOW and food was cold !

Had to beg for a check.

They separated the check between the food and drink so I had to run my credit card twice. 

When they brought my food out, another customer grabbed some fries off my plate as the waitress was walking out. They just replaced the fries and not the entire order. This made my food cold while the fries were hot. AWEFUL !!!

Then the same guy that touched my food was so drunk he slipped and busted his chin on the bar that required the police, fire and medics to come help him out. 

#1) The bartender should not have given the other customer so much to drink.

#2) Once another customer touches my food while she is walking to me - the entire order needs to be redone.

#3) Service was slow and the bartender was giving away free drinks.

#4) Don't give me two checks to get a bigger tip on a single meal. That has never happened before.

If only some geeks took over this bar and system linked a few PS3s or Xboxes to take advantage of their mounted TVs and couches they have on the right side of the bar the place would be absolutely perfect.

They have two happy hours going on. For those times please take a momen to take a look at someone else's review cause i dont really remember what times. Just know the early one ends at 7pm and the late one starts at 11pm.

Ordered one beer, a Stella. Tastes like any other Stella out there. Service was good. Ayumi? Aime? Aira? Whatever the server's name was, she was great. I felt sorry for her cause my roomie kinda gave her a hard time.

Other than that, the decor is nice. Very nice. It's like a lodge/tavern with ""bar scene"" paintings. It was kinda smoky cause there was a guy next to us heavily smoking a cigar.

When we first started going almost 2 years ago the service was amazing, now it's a joke.  Every time we order the bartender has to ask what we ordered again...when only 2 people ordered.  Ask for my tab and the bartender won't give me the check, just tells me an amount.  Then when he ran my card it was for a different amount.  When I was ordering Johnnie black he asked if I wanted blue instead, I said no, and his reply was to say it must be too steep for me.  When did bartenders start insulting customers.  Then throw in the female night bartender sitting there ignoring us, when she does talk to us it's about how she use to do meth.  I'm also amazed that when they run out of a liquor they can't restock it because they don't have access, what bar doesn't let their bartenders restock?  They're always out of tapped beers, I assume for the same reason.  What use to be a great way to end the work week has turned to be us walking through the door with disappointment because we know it's going to be shit service and no selection.  Last year they didn't run credit cards for a month and then back charged them all at once.  A couple weeks ago they stopped accepting credit for tabs less then $10.  It's one thing after another and now we are over it.  Having worked in the bar industry for 10 years I'm amazed this place stays open, they must do good on the video poker because it definitely isn't based on their bar business and customer service.

Not to be confused with the restaurant, this BJ's is a small sports bar and grill tucked away on the west side. We came in for the happy hour a few days ago and were pleasantly surprised. There a nice list of $5 food specials: spinach dip, sliders, wings and more. The gyro sliders were pretty unique and delicious, and the spinach dip was a sizable portion.  For HH the drinks were half off, my three draft blue moons only came out to about $7 which is a great deal. Unfortunately they really need to update their draft selection. BJ's only has a handful of beers on tap and most of them are domestics, no crafts or seasonals =(.

Service was great. The ladies at the bar were attentive and on point with their recommendations. The lounge area over to the side is great for large parties that just want to kick back and hang out.

3979699,2014-01-16,0,L_gl5gnEMxvADScorL-2Hw,Just happened to stop by and I'm glad we did. The bartenders and waitress were super friendly and the food was amazing. It is refreshing to go to a Vegas bar and not deal with attitude. Bartender Hugo told us the food was great and he sure was right. We had mild grilled wings and a fried veggie appetizer. I signed up for a card that gives 25% off all the time for girls. They also have food and drink specials for happy hour from 3-7 and again at 11 pm. We will definitely be back.,STgjoMKvZHw83rSHWHCoiQ,0,0,5,eHgU2EuCpYu-iSGWrobu0w

Plenty of screens for the big game on Thursday nights and Sundays via DirectTV. The place was light on customers, only 4 other people here at 1:30 p.m. 

I ordered the BJ's BLT with a fried egg. And a side salad. Spring greens with a side of balsamic dressing. 

Overall very tasty. Great bartender and service!

4154396,2013-11-20,0,L_gl5gnEMxvADScorL-2Hw,"I've been going to this BJs Cocktail Lounge since about May 2013. I've been going there at least once a week since then (sometimes up to four times a week). 

First of all, the wait and bar staff is extremely friendly and personable. I really like going there because of this. They will definitely remember your name if you frequent this place enough (of course, I'm sure they're paid to do so). Nevertheless, they seem very genuine about it and I always feel very comfortable going there.

For a bar that is themed like many others in Las Vegas (fairly dark, video poker machines, many televisions, some times very smokey) BJ's doesn't have a dive feel at all. It definitely is very clean, new and nicely decorated and I consider it much more upscale than par for Las Vegas.

A friend of mine and I frequent BJ's for lunch and happy hour. They have deals for both times. At lunch, they have a $10 lunch menu that's actually, for the most part, worth the $10. I've had pretty much all of the burgers offered on the lunch menu (they're generally always cooked to preference). All have been good. The BBQ bacon burger is very good - thick patty, cooked to order and the bacon does not disappoint. The personal pizzas are also very good as well and more than enough for one person to eat. The only time I was not pleasantly surprised with my meal was with the mushroom burger. The mushrooms tasted a little too ""wild"" for me and under-cooked. However, this could be that I just don't like mushrooms that much since I rarely eat them. I guess you learn something everyday.

My favorite item on the menu is the Prime Rib Dip sandwich. This is offered on the $10 lunch menu. It's a very sizable sandwich with juicy roast beef on a baguette roll smothered in onions and Swiss cheese. Additionally, it comes with a cappuccino cup full of Au jus, an excellent garlic horseradish sauce, freshly cooked potato chips and is really quite amazing.

The happy hour BJ's offers is also extremely good. All drinks are half price from 4pm to 7pm. They also offer a decent assortment of $5 appetizers. A Dogfish Head IPA will run you only $3 at happy hour (opposed to 6-8 bucks at the few local places that actually have it). A Coors Light (or equivalent) will run you under a $1.50. I've really only eaten the chicken wings at happy hour, but they are pretty good as well. They're not breaded or fried, but grilled and slightly charred (different but a nice departure from basics).

All in all, I would probably give BJs 5 stars, but I'm still reserving that for a place that I would deem ""perfect"". However, I don't think I've been to any place like that yet.",lTrFOWPEb_NkbOLNN9Dkrg,1,0,4,ihTfMLSOcfxEc9aKB_ykVA

The lounge is dark with many comfortable nooks for privacy and a modern style to the decor with big comfortable sofas and smoking chairs where you can sit for hours. There are TVs are everywhere so you don't miss any action but its hard to pay attention when you have lovely waitresses attending to your needs.

The service was good *they didn't have any other customers hello* and they did turn on our game with sound. The food quality is very good - I ordered ahi tuna and my boyfriend got the gyro with sweet potato fries. The ahi was lightly seared and very fresh, and was a nice presentation. They had decent red wine as well. The only thing we didn't like was when we got the bill - I was playing video blackjack the entire time and I was playing more than $20 but this place won't tell you that they don't comp your drinks. I rarely play so I don't know the rules about comping but I swear I have been to numerous places in Vegas that will comp you as long as you are playing $20 and a dollar a hand. Ah well.

4620418,2013-09-27,0,L_gl5gnEMxvADScorL-2Hw,"I really enjoyed the BJ's Cocktail Lounge on South Decatur. This one? Not as much.

The positive is that they do serve the same Thursday prime rib dinner for $6.99. They also have half price or two-for-one drinks during 4-7pm happy hour (all I know is that I had two 60-minute IPAs for $6). The prime rib was decent--great for the price anyway.

The negative is that our server wasn't quite there. She took a long time to come around, which wasn't so bad since we were watching the game. But she brought out our dinners without any silverware and when she brought my second Dogfish Head, it magically turned into a Miller Lite. In both situations, we just bypassed her i.e. we grabbed our own silverware from another table and I just went to the bar to get my beer replaced.

Overall, an A-OK experience. Nice big place to watch the game with solid food and drink specials.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,2,1,3,i-FF_NO0jl9EWSRRRNl7oQ

And, the employees remember who I am!  Sure, they all call me ""Mr. Manhattan"" because I order that drink most often, but still.  They recognize me!

Happy Hour occurs on weekdays from 4pm-7pm, making it the perfect after-work pitstop.  Long day at work?  No worries, BJ's has 50% off drinks and $5 appetizers to keep you going.  I've had their Tempura Calamari and one of their chicken sandwiches, and both have been tasty.  A step above average bar food.  Be sure to try their herb-infused fries, they're an addicting side to have while enjoying a few drinks.  The decor, staff, food, and friendly atmosphere have kept this spot in regular rotation for me recently, and I don't see that changing any time soon.

Without Amy this place just isn't the same. I don't think I'm gonna go outta my way to come here anymore. It's pretty far from my house, and it's become a f*cking sausagefest of horrific proportions. Aaron K and I used to come here about once a week to perform our weekly womanizing, but that just ain't possible anymore. In the words of a NW Vegas local: ""I am a frustration and dissapoint"". 

Bobby is still the coolest guy in Las Vegas. My advice for all you guys is to come after midnight when Bobby is working. He is the kitchen manager, and he makes sure the food tastes excellent. The burgers here are way better than Steak & Shake or Stripburger. Don't get me wrong, I love Steak & Shake, but somehow Bobby's burgers are light years ahead of them. Also, like I mentioned in my previous review, Bobby knows everything! He is like the real life Dr. Manhattan, I mean he can see into  the future and stuff. You can literally ask him about anything and he will know the answer. 

I bet a lot of my Yelp friends and followers are wondering: ""Why is RP hanging out at a bar? I thought he was straight edge."" Well, I don't drink here, I just come for the food. And believe me, the food on graveyard is way better than any 24 hour coffee shop at a Casino. 

Now, if Bobby quits I am gonna give this place a 1-star review.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,5,5,5,vxCqwdS9FIKa7PP-ADucYQ
