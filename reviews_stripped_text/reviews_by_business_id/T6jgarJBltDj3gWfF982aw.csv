Yelped & this place was a minute away!

Super fresh & fast... and the place was clean! Exactly what I look for in Subway :-)

Boys have energy again & we're back to the fields!",DK01jsn-JcbiBamE1pB1mQ,0,0,5,M4twKk3KFNPGVr6GdIS5FQ

I will never go to this location again, I was not able to eat my sub due to her squeezing the whole sauce of chipotle, and she tried warming up my  sandwich and adding condiments I didn't even ask for!",75epMWO0WbTrKfNSm0CNCw,0,0,2,x3HHClG3wFQVyy6kVBM8tg

Customer service is bad 
Didn't offer to toast my bread 
Put to much sauce and messed up my sandwich 
Don't go here they are lazy, and a bunch of jokes",XcQutYF_2yawZW8SyeNJUw,0,0,1,WLOqpusXJlvlBypMSVBfnw
