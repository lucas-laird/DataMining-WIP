We walked in, nobody greeted us, we sat ourselves, and the bartender came 5-7 minutes later... Not to mention it was freezing in there! 
We ordered a $20 pitcher of mojito cause it was their especial. We got it, and only then did she tell us that the mint flavor was mixed with the syrup (no mint leaves at all). None the less, it was nasty af. 
We ordered, food took a little while to come, and service was just alright.. (she never came to check if we needed anything).
Food was not great.. Some stuff was obviously frozen and I really hope I don't get sick from the ahi tuna and salmon.

I loved it when it was Murphy's Law... so for my Favorite spot to change I was a little scared to go in. 
""what if my fave's are gone??""
""what if the foods bad??""
 well ALL MY FAVES are STILL THERE :D
The food that they have is OMG AMAZING! && they're me-sized portions... NOM NOM NOM!!!!

727451,2013-09-10,3,vFWYJFEEp-HeO7bsJOyEZA,"I was staying in the neighborhood, and decided to give the place a whirl.  

Upon entering the smell of smoke was really strong, but found a place near the door where it did not seem so bad.  

I was cheerfully met by the server, who was pleasant, but requested that I order everything by numbers, instead of the foods name.  No problem, I agreed.  

I ordered the Octopus and Caesar salad with anchovies.  The salad was really good, the octopus was past chilled, and frozen.  I brushed this off, and ordered the escargot and a glass of zinfandel.  Well, after a few minutes, both showed up, and the zinfandel was a pink one that was cold, so a white or pink zinfandel or some sort of nasty swill, which I tried to get my server's attention, which I waited for for around 10 minutes, and finally walked to the bar to get a glass of red.  

I finished the wine and my escargot, which were OK.  Then the disturbing part began.  I was watching the end of Monday Night football, when I glanced over at the bar and noticed a patron's scrotum hanging out of his underwear while he was stumbling around.  Maybe in Vegas this is acceptable, but somehow in my opinion this mixed with tapas does not jibe.  I was grossed out, and could not leave the place fast enough, and I waited, and waited while trying to make eye contact with my lack of server, who finally signaled to me from afar whether I wanted my bill, which I obviously did, and she obliged.  She then said he had dementia, which I called BS on.  He was drunker than cooter brown, as he had to be helped to get his pants back on.  He was not the only person in here that was plastered, as I noticed many other people stumble by.

Maybe I am wrong, but tapas and a smoking bar full of slot machines and drunks does not really match.  You could not pay me to go into this place again, as it was more than the sad display I witnessed at the end, it was a place that wreaked of smoke, where you are trying to have a nice meal.  If they do not want to alienate their loyal clientele, they should serve tater tots, and spam as when you are that messed up, something that soaks up booze when the staff is clearing over serving the customers would be adequate for their clientele.

Had to hunt down the 2 waitresses that seemed to be serving our table more than once. Tapas on the happy hour menu were less than mediocre. We ordered several off the menu to try & quite honestly there's too many on their menu to make anything from scratch it seems that most are frozen to order. Even some items seemed like they were nuked as there was no crispiness to them where there should have been nothing but crispiness. I wouldn't go back as there are far too many other places to either try or that I actually enjoy going to.,uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,0,0,2,7z4lfKnuA96KG9u22C5pMg
1654126,2014-03-22,5,vFWYJFEEp-HeO7bsJOyEZA,"Place was pretty dead for a Friday night..
Their dine-in area was so big, but so empty.. So girlfriend and I sat at the bar!

We were greeted and helped by Eric throughout the whole night.. I would say he made the experience ""ok"" enough for us to stay!

We were definitely turned off when both bartenders, at the bar, had no clue what cocktails they have! We stuck with the simple things-- Moscatos, Mai Tai, ""Peach on the Beach"", Sparkling Moscatos, and our mixed drink that includes Absolute Peach Vodka, Pineapple and Sprite (which usually is with Ciroc Peach, but they didn't have). The wine was wine. A couple of our cocktails, as my friend had put it, should've been drank at the club! It was too strong for our little pallets! Lol

Now let's talk food.. I wasn't impressed..
First round we had :
* Stuffed Dates - I've never seen such huge dates, which wasn't a good thing in this situation! Had so much blue cheese where that's all you tasted!!
* Mango Chicken - The dish had grilled chicken with some type of mango salsa. Bland, no special flavor, and had some type of kick to it.
* Crab Cake - I liked this dish out of the three! The look of it was weird because it looked like a hamburger party, but crab was chunky and the sauce paired with it really well! Although I've had much better crab cakes, this was good!

Second, we ordered Buffalo Chicken Wings.
They were good to me, but it's fried chicken with added buffalo sauce.. you CAN'T mess that up! You get 5, decent sized wings with not too much buffalo sauce and a side of ranch! 

Lastly, (we blame the alcohol for having to order more food) we ordered Meatball Sliders and Shrimp Ceviche.
* Meatballs tasted like something from a can or those frozen ones. Plus they were really small for the size of bun they chose. I like my meatballs waaay bigger and made with real ground beef!
* The ceviche came with Tostitos nacho chips. Had good amounts of shrimp. To say the least it was ok..

OVERALL - Food was mediocre and bland.. Drinks were drinks, nothing special... And our bartender was really friendly, funny, and attentive! ¯\_(?)_/¯",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,6,4,2,hiJwll1gALke9LOfwGrkvw

2224794,2014-05-21,0,vFWYJFEEp-HeO7bsJOyEZA,"My girl and I went here because of a groupon while visiting over the weekend . I yelped it and gave it a try.

The vibe suggests that this place is a locals preferred bar (as it is off strip) which is kinda of weird because everyone in vegas is a  transplant or decendent of one but I digress...

The fellow patrons seemed like older regulars who weren't happy, smoke, drink and play video poker constantly.

We were greeted but it didn't feel good as the one bartender talked on the phone as we waited to order. As we tried to find a table to sit at outside, we had difficulty finding a table that didn't wobble so bad that if you hit the table your beer would surely fall over. There were also a few tables that were broken to the point where you could get really hurt. we went back inside and after 2 tries we finally found a table that didn't wobble so bad.

I returned to the bar to order our second round and then ordered the bacon wrapped dates. When our dish was brought to us the bartender seemed to have made a pleasuring attempt at interacting with us. He told us about the bar and the food and seemed to have a personality..he even mentioned that he was from the Midwest.

We then ordered the garlic fries and  angus cheeseburger sliders......They were soooo good. I recommend them...the bacon wrapped dates..not so much.

They had 13 flat screens and while patronizing we happened to catch the Michael Jackson Hollogram thingy.

Two other female visitors arrived dressed like non locals and said ""fuck this shit...lets get out of here"" distressed by the non greeting and come get your own drinks and greet me attitude of the bartender. We understood!!!

Long story short....

FOOD IS GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (kitchen has nothing to do with bar and bar makes no money from it as explained by the bartender in a unfair attitude)

Groupon is worth its value (main reason we patronized)

Drinks are .....we only had beers but no foam, ice cold and in a logo glass...so great to me.

Would love to give this place a rave review but two friends asked me if they should buy it and I replied "" Feels like a locals preferred place but the food was great. I think you should buy senior frog's deal instead"".

I'm sorry Barefoot Bob's ....would give you a five if maybe a different night or bartender or no feeling of older down and out fellow patrons.",WQmUQtZTR9oE97GIQnxDtw,0,0,3,5ZOykyyqQ9IFZ6R049k37w

We ordered a nice variety of things - from the rice balls to sliders. Everything was good, stuffed dates and mango chicken were excellent. We ordered 7 dishes and I got a draft beer and our meal was less than $40 which I thought was a great deal for the amount of food we received. The croquette was a little too greasy for me. We would come back, and I noticed there is currently a groupon out for half off drinks (no food). 

I was concerned about smoke smell, but we are both pretty sensitive to smoke and it only got bad as we were leaving and 3 people at the bar lit up....and we were sitting right beside the bar.

Came here on a Friday night with my friend, it was extremely dead. First thing I smelt was smoke but hey, it's a bar what did I expect? Immediately greeted by Eric, our bartender for the night. He was very nice & attentive. He did mention he just started working so he was kind of clueless with the cocktail menus as well as the foods but I won't hold that against him!

For the foods--  this place is at the bottom of my list of tapas foods. We ordered..
Mango chicken -- nothing special about it looked like grilled chicken in mango salsa. 
Stuffed dates -- The dates were so big! & was wrapped in a small size bacon that didn't match the portion size of the dates.
Crab cake -- this was pretty delicious but the presentation of the dish wasn't appealing. When it came out it looked like a burger patty swimming in sauce. 
Buffalo wings-- nothing to say there it's wings lol 
Ceviche -- it was pretty good. The chips looked like it came outta a bag that you buy at the super market.
Meatball sliders -- meatballs were midget size compared to the bun. Tasted bland.

Cocktails & wine-- got the job done. They weren't terrible.

The first night was awesome met a guy who knew everything even recommended what to eat and we did.  The service was great and we left happy.  

The next time we came in the service was happy to see us and greeted us nicely made us feel welcome good service and nice drinks.  Comps good for gambling.

The next time service was not so good the normal bartender greeted us but left shortly after.  Keep in mind my man was gambling the whole time I was sober driver and was going to pay for my 2 drinks in 2 hours no problem.  But we were not asked just ignored came to the point he had to flag them down to get a drink for him.  We had friends join us who gambled $200 had 3 drinks and 2 apps still had a food tab.   My man lost $150 and was pretty much sober we did not have any food.  Our friends who are big gamblers still had a food tab as I said after loosing that much.  When I bartended 10 years ago it was kinda your job to make to people loosing at least feel welcome.  We left feeling like a gem that was found turned into a piece of coal, cold, hard and unwanted.

We took a gamble on booking this place for Game Day Sunday. They were advertising $80 all you can eat game day buffet, endless draft beers/bottle beers, reserved seating, and halftime raffles. Sounds great, right? We're just a big group from Portland, some of us have served in the industry, and we were looking for a fun low key place to watch the game.

Expectations=exceeded. When they said ""endless draft and bottle beers"", they meant they'd bring full buckets brimming with cold beer bottles every 30 minutes. When they said  ""game day buffet"", they meant delicious pasta, pulled pork sliders, nacho bar, hot wings, and more. When they said ""half time raffle"", they meant my friend was going to win a full-sized neon Fosters beer sign and tons of other stuff, along with celebratory Fireball shots for everyone in our group. Ok, a COUPLE of shots for every single person in our group.

I WILL SAY: As a non-smoker (as most of our group is), we actually lucked out with the last minute reservation of an outside table. Had we been stationed inside the building, I don't know if we would've had as much fun. But with an outside table, we were able to breathe easy, move around, be loud, talk smack to the losing Broncos fans, stuff our faces with nachos, and make general game day merriment. And Angie, whom I take it is a manager, was in charge of our reservations and not only was she prompt in responding to my email query, she was the ultimate loud mouth hostess with a sassy attitude and I gotta give it up to her for that. Thanks, girl.

We MORE than felt like we got our $80 worth. Well worth the hike from the hotels we stayed at on the strip.

We ordered our shots of Jameson (only $4, not too shabby!) with a pickle back. (Trust me, if you haven't tried this, you MUST.  There is something delightfully crazy about how good pickle juice tastes right after a shot of whiskey.  It sounds like it would be awful, but it is DELICOUS!)

5476685,2013-09-05,2,vFWYJFEEp-HeO7bsJOyEZA,"A review on the fly,  well let's see,  $3 barefoot wine is hard to beat. 

The strange mix of old Murphy's Law with island theme is a little off putting,  but we are here for the food. Though if you're not a parrot head you may want to bring ear plugs. 

Okay,  the food:

Bacon wrapped dates,  well the comparison to Fire Fly is an obvious one,  but they are totally different,  at Fire Fly they aim to bring out the sweetness of the date,  here it is less sweet and more tang,  I honestly could not pick between them,  they are both very good. 

The escargot...... simply amazing,  fantastic food,  a must have. 

Lobster ravioli,  very good. 

Chicken satay,  the taste is ok,  but due to the size of the chicken pieces it would be very easy to over cook,  as in this case,  dry chicken is just not good. 

The meatball,  excellent, I was worried that due to the size they would be dry,  but nope,  it puts most Italian restaurants in town to shame. 

Tamale. Decent,  a little more meat would be good,  it was also a little dry. 

Risotto balls,  sorry but that sucked,  like biting into sand.

Croquetter, okay,  not as good as Fire Fly,  but ok, more like deep fried wipped potatoes than anything.

Mac and cheese... seriously seriously good,  the portion size is insane as well,  you could make a meal out of it by itself,  in no way,  shape or form a tapas dish,  but damn it's good. 

Duck slider,  way to heavy on the cherry reduction,  but, a silly amount of duck,  for the price, the sweetness of the cherry reduction would have been fine with the duck, but the amount just totally overwhelmed the duck so all we were left with was the overly sweet cherry. 

Service was a little hit or miss, having one of the bartenders act as the wait person may be a good idea money wise, but it can lead to long waits if they are busy at the bar.

So in the end, this place has some outstanding dishes and some that are just plain nasty, how they can come out of the same kitchen is beyond me, but it is certainly worth visiting and with dishes like the escargot, it's clear that someone knows how to cook.",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,4,3,4,EVkZ6AE3HKLSKvnt5ffiyg
