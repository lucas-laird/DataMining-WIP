If you want to sample any of the lemonades just ask and they will give you a taste. The beef on a stick is always good but the pepper jack cheese on a stick goes nice with it. The cheese on a stick isn't too spicy but still has a nice little zing. I tried the funnel cake sticks and they were made perfect. Not much greasy and not as sweet as they appeared.

Swung through the drive thru today after my workout- gotta stay fat somehow, right?
In any case, the line wasn't long but the wait kind of was: was probably probably in line about ten minutes.

Ordered the beef hot dog on a stick and the american cheese on a stick. No clue what to expect, I usually just hit up Sonic when the random corndog craving strikes. But with the rave reviews here, surely this place was something special.

Got home and shared my treats with the BF: I got a bite or two of the dog with some regular Frech's before he inhaled the rest with some spicy brown mustard. Both of us were perplexed by the cheese on a stick (american)- seems like it's supposed to be their take on a grilled cheese, and it's not bad, just... odd. 

Probably won't be by often, but definitely giving an extra star for the spicy brown mustard- will scoop up an extra packet or three next time I go in.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,0,0,3,1xqYo7zyFamrov7UrQejKw

I was hungry after work but didn't want something heavy. I remembered hearing this place had opened up and had a drive thru! It isn't too far from work so I headed over. I missed the place the first time around. You have to turn into the shopping center with the stop light to get into the parking lot otherwise you can't get to the restaurant. Eventually after turning down a side street and turning again I was back on Charleston and turned into the plaza. I made it! 

I ordered a beef hot dog on a stick and a pepper jack cheese on a stick. It was almost $7 for the 2 items. I don't normally buy corn dogs so I don't know if the price is good, but $3 something for a corn dog seems a bit high to me. It took a few minutes to prepare my food but when I bit into the corn dog it was warm. Same thing with the cheese. I expected hot gooey and cheesy but it was just warm. Even the batter on the outside wasn't crunchy. I was disappointed. The food was good, but I was expecting more. Maybe I went on an off night? Maybe that is the normal temp of their foods? I know they are supposed to batter and cook everything fresh to order so I don't really know what the deal was. I probably will try them again if I'm in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,5,4,3,IQAgA_Gl7kZUKz4uy9ZsLw

I had been kind of sad hearing they had removed the HDOAS from fashion show and boulevard malls and I was a little nervous I was going to have withdrawals, but then I remembered this location and off I was to take care of my craving. I pull up to the drive thru and the menu of course reads all about the basic 5 items menu but they do have a combo of - 4 sticks, 1 funnel cake sticks, 1 fry and 1 lemonade for $12.99 so I figured let's just do it. Not only did it take them 20 mins while I was in the drive thru waiting but then the sticks (hot dog and cheese) were so over breaded you couldn't even eat it and then by the time you got to the meat or cheese it was cold!

I have nothing negative to say about my experience, it was actually above and beyond what I would ever expect from a Hot Dog on A Stick. I had only seen Hot Dog on A Stick in the food court at the mall before, so I was surprised to see a location in a small shopping center AND it has a drive-thru! Score! I was greeted by Casper, who went over the menu and specials. On Mondays & Wednesdays you can get double stamps on your rewards card. After you buy any 13 items you get 1 free! Don't forget to ask for a card! Casper also said that when it comes to drink sizes, the souvenir cup is $4 and some change, but you get $2 refills. This ends up a great deal if you plan on coming back. Casper also gave me a sample of their new orange lemonade flavor and it was refreshing.

I started out with a ""Cheese on a Stick"" priced at $2.85 and chose the American cheese (they also have pepper jack). Yum! This one isn't as big as the regular hot dog on a stick, but is very cheesy and was my favorite! Next I had the ""Beef on a Stick"" priced at $3.35 and again was pleased. The corn dog was made with an all-beef Nathan's hot dog. The corn dogs are battered and cooked fresh to order and both of mine were cooked perfect. 

Aside from corn dogs, on the menu you will find funnel cake sticks, french fries, hot dogs (in a bun!) and of course lemonade that is made fresh about every 2 hours in a variety of yummy flavors.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,25,22,5,IsXlb214pkml296_unJAfQ

I came to this Hot Dog On A Stick for the first time today.  It was about 11:40 AM and there was nobody inside.  The drive-thru seemed to be a little more busy.  There was only one lady working here today and she was focused on the drive-thru people.  Poor girl was working the drive-thru, the front counter and the fryer.  Things were backing up.  She had to apologize to everybody for the wait.  She acknowledged me a few times while I waited for her to bring the car line down a bit.  I give her credit for that.

The worst part of what seemed to be a very long wait was the alarm that was going off the entire time.  I know exactly where it was but I cannot say for sure what it was.  It was a device in the ceiling that reminded me of a dying battery in a smoke alarm at home.  But this beeping was not in any sort of sequence which made it all the more irritating.  It was so random.  I could not wait to get out of there.  With my food of course.

I ordered two corn dogs, two fries and a lemonade (not all for me).  This came to over $12.  That is steep considering I can go to any Rebel Gas Station around town and get twow corn dogs for $1.  And I wasn't really even that thrilled with the dog.  The batter was too cakey for me.  The fries were good.  I like that they use seasoned salt rather than the standard table salt.  I wish they hadn't used so much of it though.  The lemonade was really good.  I like the hand churrned stuff.

4558358,2013-09-09,2,SMUEM_BxyRP31kMQNTX7bg,"First of all, I should tell you I have a serious addiction to HDoaS. I love all their food and drink, and I do not think I've ever had a service issue to complain about. So, this review is going to be all positives. Pretty much you're going to read this for my recommendations!

I always get the same three things here: the beef hot dog and the pepper jack on a stick and a regular lemonade. They're the best things on the menu, I believe, and really the best way to introduce people to HDoaS. See, it's the simple stuff here that delivers. The hot dogs are quality Nathan's (I think) so you're not getting value-brand stuff. It shows when you bite into a hot dog -- the meat is still fairly moist and flavorful, and you can tell it's legit comfort food. The cheese, too, is perfect. It comes out super hot and gooey, and you need to take your time getting to it. There's actually somewhat of a science to this: you can't get to it too quickly or it'll be too hot, and you can't wait too long or it'll be too cool. You really have to Goldilocks it, and my informal scientific study reveals the magic wait time to be around 45 seconds from presentation to consumption. Results may vary, so have the lemonade available for when you burn your mouth. Having said that, I accompany my foodstuffs with lemonade. I don't go for the different flavors they offer (lime, cherry, frozen) because I think the original is perfect. It ain't broke, don't fix it...

As mentioned before, they make the food to order. That means your order could take about two minutes, so don't be upset. It's worth it. Also, just so you know, this place is not a budget eatery like Taco Bell. If you wanna eat a ton for $5, this place isn't your best bet. I spent $18 today on two combo meals plus a cheese. Totally worth it, though. 

This particular location has a more expansive menu featuring chicken and other stuff. I've never ventured outside my comfort zone with their food, so I cannot report on their worth. Probably also really good, though.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,1,2,5,BuV2ALaeOtrExrLIRpzbHg

What's not to love, freshly battered and fried hot dogs, turkey dogs, and cheese on a stick. They are heaven. They also serve up the best freaking lemonade I've ever had in my life. Shout out to Cherry Lemonade, I love you.

This location also offers fries, chilli cheese fries, and just plain ol' chilli. On my visit, I got a turkey dog and pepper jack cheese on a mother freakin' stick. Just as awesome as it is at the mall without all the teenagers behaving like teenagers.

Service was quick and friendly. The store was super clean. 

This location has a drive-thru and a frequent lemonade card. Buy 12, get your 13th free.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,1,1,4,tXKn_iFKOShZXwvXyxpWPQ

We were on this side of town and super excited to see this place. My teen is a huge corn dog lover and we have gotten these at the mall a bunch of times. Not sure if this is just something you have to eat as soon as you get it, but we did the drive through and drove 20 minutes home and by that time they were pretty meh :-( 

Corn dog loving teen ate 1/2 of 1 of the 2 she got and was done. I got the new mini corn dog bites and ate them in the car and they were pretty bad even being piping hot. The tiny hot dogs were tough and when you tried to bite it in half, the whole thing came out leaving the corn dog shell. 

We got two combo meals, an extra turkey dog on a stick (cheapest option) and the mini bites and it was $26 something. Seemed very over-priced to me. Combo meals are $7-$8 each, so for a family of 4 you are easily over $30. 

Price wouldn't have been so terrible if it had been decent, but it wasn't. I think we just like the ones at the malls better. To leave this on a better note, I will say that the employees were very friendly, so that's always nice :-)",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,1,0,2,br9Qbg6rJgtSQOG4jpLqWA

5819464,2015-09-25,0,SMUEM_BxyRP31kMQNTX7bg,This has been my best hot dog on a stick experience ever. I was having a hard time picking a flavor so after having them give me samples of all of them I stuck with the original. They were very patient and friendly. I do own a business so I did pay attention to the staff names. MEGAN and JOHN were the best they made my experience just as when I use to go and I was a kid. My dad would be so proud to come to this location he was actually friends with Dave.,8imyDDBAOGngxf_a4kyseA,3,1,5,1wW9c7CsPcQC2UKS3EdmOw

This place is pretty big and just like the mall great lemonade and sticks.  Check them out they even have Nathan's hot dogs now so if you like hot dogs this is a great inexpensive place to eat .  

Happy eating  xoxoxo",RCgfxH5PclsgSKRWDGJ86A,2,2,4,u1i4c6_RaD3PWLQah1nLpA
