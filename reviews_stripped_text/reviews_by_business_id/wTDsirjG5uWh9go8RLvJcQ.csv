We had a party of 4. The food was 50/50. The salmon was edible and I  really enjoyed the lamb. The fries were old and dried out and so were the chicken wings. We found a piece of hair in our ketchup.

154134,2017-08-06,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Decided to give Robert Irvine's public house a second try. Was very pleasantly surprised with how far along they've come since opening weekend. We were greeted by the front desk host in the most warm welcomed manner. I was immediately taken to my table, and immediately had our waiter bring our drinks out. We ordered three appetizers, the chicken wings, the steak tartare, and the French onion fondue. Impossible for me to pick which one was the winner as all three were above and beyond amazingly delicious. The chicken wings were cooked to perfection with a perfect glaze sitting on a wonderful warm crostini. The French onion fondue was so amazing that I started scooping it up with just the spoon bypassing the Bread. The state tartare was extremely high end, better than most of the steak tartare I've had in expensive restaurants. 

My partner ordered the shepherds pie, made out of lamb. One word came to mind when I tried it, orgasmic!!! 

I ordered the steak and fries that came with beautiful asparagus spears. The steak was cooked to perfection with a wonderful delicious chimichurri sauce. 

All in all I gave my second trip to Robert Irvine's public house a five star because there wasn't a single thing that I can honestly say what's mediocre. Everything and everyone was perfect!!!!

As a foodie, I definitely definitely highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for high-quality excellent service great food within a reasonable budget.",vrYY6ByqCS-2We-raSqjXQ,2,0,5,e5EmukhafseRQb-Yg4EqIQ

Shepherd's Pie: DH said it was the best he ever had. I on the other hand did not like it at all because of the gaminess of the lamb. I am also not a fan of the gaminess of goat cheese which is used a lot throughout the menu. 
Chicken Wings: Solid. They are very good buffalo style wings but nothing special that stands out among other solid buffalo style wings. Overpriced.
Poutine: Everyone in my party loved it. I thought it was too salty.
Shoestring Fries: Everyone enjoyed this. Loved how thin, hot, and crispy the fries were. The curry mayo aioli is delicious.
Mixed heirloom tomato salad and Spring Green Salad: Liked both salads. I would definitely get the mixed heirloom again. If you like tomatoes this is the one to get.
Wild mushroom pizza: It was good, and the goat cheese was not overwhelming. But I probably would not order again.
Skirt steak: Ordered it medium. It was okay. The chimichurri was  good. I was little underwhelmed by it.
Fish and Chips: First time we went, they were sold out and was waiting for their shipment of fish. We got it on our second visit. The fish was perfectly cooked. It was moist and tasted fresh. Was missing the tartar sauce but I could understand why he wanted the taste of the fish to shine through.
Ponzu Glazed Salmon: Again, another solid dish. perfectly cooked, but not wowed by it.

In summary, the food was solid. The chef did a good job with execution. But I wasn't wowed by the food from a personal preference standpoint. I would probably give it more a 3.5 stars only because I expect more from a celebrity chef, las vegas, and its price point.",XgYdrDcVzlQ5h2_oPS_3Ug,0,0,4,81_CBfQ5o58nWsvEMdCw3w

The long story short is that at some point during the service I was extremely dissatisfied. My luck turned around when I spoke to the manager, Marcos, and I informed him of what was going one as it was not the waitress or the runner. I don't want to go I to detail to skew anyone from going here. Once I let Marcos know my concerns he went the extra 1000 miles to complete service recovery.

697345,2017-10-15,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"My husband was excited to try Public House, so I made reservations for Saturday night. We arrived about 15 minutes early and were told they were overbooked and short seaters, so we would have to wait a while. They had a party of 70, one of 40 and a third of 24. I was not optimistic. But we were seated only a little late. When we ordered our drinks our server said the bar was backed up and we'd really appreciate our drinks once we finally got them, but it wasn't too long of a wait either. The appetizer, the French onion fondue, was pretty good, but bland. The food came out fairly quickly, which was unexpected, but it was just ok. I ordered the fish and chips. The piece of fish was huge, but it wasn't served with any type of sauce , and was too dry. The chips were of course fries, but they had mustard and various other things on them, which was not in the menu description or I would not have ordered them. For me, it made them unappetizing. I am sure that many people would like them. Hubby got the F&K burger, ordered it medium, got it med rare. He said it was ok. At least he had regular fries. Bottom line is, it wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was average.

717234,2017-09-14,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"I thought it be a great idea to make my first yelp review for one of my favorite celebrity chefs, I've been a fan of his since he led the blue team on season two of worst cooks in America. But never in my wildest dreams did I expect my experience to resemble that show. For our vegas trip I brought my wife and we decided to try as much food as we could. The ambiance is nice and subtle and the bar is where we sat. The best item on the menu was the French onion fondue and the appetizer rib. Very good dishes but that seemed to be the culinary ceiling for the cooking staff. I mean I understood walking into this place that it's specially was gastropub food so we ordered simple classics like the fish and chips, but to my shock it was the most haphazard rendition of the dish I've ever had. The dish tasted like a remedial culinary students attempt to try a new twist by offering nothing at all. If you would like any green like cabbage with it don't even bother the chef on duty has the audacity to put a little scrap of flavorless cabbage strips. And nothing excelled with the shoe string fries or dry cod and an oddly to tangy malted aioli. But the best redeeming factor of this place other than the nice bartenders was the pub aspect as the gastro was sadly lacking. We tried the founders selection and my wife really enjoyed the raspberry rubaues draft. But as much as she enjoyed her drink the managerial staff seemed to love there's even more. I mean to each its own. But the bald manager Marcus seemed to take away from the ambiance as he seemed to enjoy a few to many pestering guest to guest at the bar. It was nice to see Irvine himself there but unlike other celebrity chef properties his presence didn't really outshine the lower quality in food. Well if your in Vegas and want to try some beer and enjoy watching the management act like dummies id really recommend this Gastropub.",EMdMROyaLHNsKnlZvTq4NA,0,0,2,UJGuY1Ua12eyXVBtBM4cQA

From the moment we sat down at the bar, we were given everything one hopes for when they go out to eat. They were prompt, attentive, and full of information about the restaurant, and all its offerings. While we debated about what to order, Juan suggested something my girlfriend and I had both been looking at, so we ordered it. The burger was made with Creekstone Farms beef which is exceptional, deep fried bacon, sautéed mushrooms and onions, green tomato and lettuce shavings served on a brioche bun and offered with an insane fondue to pour over the burger.  We have been residing in Vegas for two years now, and this was absolutely one of if not our best experiences at any restaurant.  This place is a very fun environment one can plan to either sit and have a nice meal, or sit at the bar as we did, and enjoy great food, sample some wonderful beers, and receive the type of service so few restaurants offer anymore.

I asked if they had a separate menu for vegetarians/vegans. The host said no, but they could customized a few options and she told us to ask our server.  So we went in, we were shown to a lower table with the most uncomfortable chairs ever. (The  frame of the chairs were made out of some sort of hard wood, I guess.  They didn't hardly have much of a back to them and the arms came up really high.) I asked the server for options that she could recommend for me.  She said we don't have many, this is mostly a meat place.  We should  have left then, since it seemed like my questioned annoyed her. I knew my husband was tired and hungry, so we stayed.

I ordered the BLT with cheddar cheese/without the bacon and a side salad with no cucumbers. My side salad was full of cucumbers. The BLT looked like one you would get from Sonic, but worse.  I basically got texas looking toast that they called brioche bread with some shredded iceberg lettuce, a few sprinkles of  some sort of shredded cheese, one tomato slice and a little bit of avocado mayonnaise.  I wished I would have taken a picture, but I didn't. I was so busy looking at this $15.00 sandwich that I was going to force myself to eat.  I scraped off the iceberg lettuce, which the little bit of the cheese that I had came off with it.  (I really expected much more from a celebrity chef's restuarant)  I would have been ashamed to have served that sandwich to anyone.  So my husband ordered the Shepard's Pie.  It was the worst Shepard's Pie that he has every had. (He was actually feeling ill for the rest of the night). Then we  go ahead and ordered the peach cheesecake, thinking something had to be good.   The cheesecake was actually the only thing that was good.

Not sure how most of  the other reviews are glowing, but we will never eat there again.  It seemed like the only people that were happy there were the ones sitting at the bar.   It  was our worst meal that we had in our 6 day Vegas stay.",NlXPKjeNk4YHHD0jt_Fnng,2,1,1,DO0dWS_pMU0MujviYoTWbQ

While new restaurants generally have some kinks to work out, this Chef's TV shows indicate a high regard for precision, quality and industry expertise which should get the show started much faster; but it did not. Interesting menu choices overall with something for everyone in a group or those looking for a wide array of options; from finger food and sandwiches to a massive steak! Overall, the atmosphere is bland which brings me to our actual meal... we got the poutin app. which was flavorful but was not at all hot and was very skimpy on the gravy... got the bechamel burger which is really messy and hard to eat but the burger had no seasoning on the meat... got the BLT to and the bacon was overlooked and the sandwich is a bit skimpy.. last meal was the fish and chips.. more like a plate of fries and a piece of very bland cod; no flavor at all in the fish or the batter and no offer of any condiments! Skinny fries are a horrible choice for the meals and again no condiments were ever offered.. let alone put in the plate... specialty drinks were good and met expectations.. prices are reasonable for Vegas... given the choices in Vegas Chef Irvine gets my vote for one and done.",u3cTiI5zSAC8_eGBAe6n0Q,2,0,2,wkFva3yxRMhOP7SY47J1Qg

The restaurant itself is very nice. The service we had was great. Where they fell short was the food. I had the chicken wing appetizer. The wings were all different sizes. Some drumettes were much larger than others on the plate, and the smaller drumettes along with some very small wingettes were stacked under the larger pieces. Because of the size difference the  smaller pieces were over cooked, dry and tough while the larger pieces were fine. I had the fish and chips. When the plate came out it had a slight off odor. The fish was heavily battered which was bland, and the fish had a mushy texture, and had a unpleasant after taste. The fries were shoestring fries covered in a curry aioli. I'm a curry fan, but not a fan of this aioli. As a result I didn't eat my fish and only had a couple of the fries before I pushed the plate away. My wife had the shepherds pie which was good, although there are two shepherds pies listed on the menu for the same price, one explaining the ingredients of a traditional pie,and the other only stating "" chefs preparation "" which is confusing, but our server explained it was a vegetarian shepherds pie. Our server was great and he discounted our ticket, and offered a discount on our next visit.  With the number of dining options in this town whether it be a celebrity chef or not, you only have one chance to impress, and Robert Irvine fell short.",xHlOR3IM4u2b2yL4FAe_PA,0,0,2,gVj7dNdGxoSaTWeQHXVtPQ

1092164,2017-08-06,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Went here 4 nights ago. We were seated after 2minutes of waiting just standing there with the host. She couldn't take us because she said the other host had to seat us which was fine but weird because this place was dead. it was around 9:30pm btw. We get seated and then have to wait almost 10 minutes for the waitress to come and greet us. which is again weird because we were only like the 5th table in the restaurant. The waitress was nice but with no personality whatsoever, barely even spoke. We ordered our beers and then had the signature buffalo wings as an appetizer. They had a different taste to it and not in a good way. Whatever seasoning they used, they over did it. We didn't finish them as it felt like our mouth was full of way to much sodium already. Then we order our entrees, and when I ask for the tomahawk ribeye, the waitress just said we don't have it. again no reason why, no apology, no personality. Its the 4night of the grand opening how do they not have a robert irvine signature plate. Anyway, I ended up getting the skirt steak and asked for it medium well. The plate comes out maybe 10 minutes later, not too bad, but the fries are hard, cold, stale. And the steak is barely warm as well. And its probably because as you can see in the pic, it is not medium well. it is red and barely cooked. Its edible and it has a plain taste to it and I'm starving so whatever. We then have the signature dessert which is something with banana and espresso. Nothing special, i didn't even care to finish half of it. The atmosphere in the restaurant not nice either, its so loud even when there is no other customers. It makes u feel like you are still out there at the slot machines gambling. I noticed they had a view so I go and take a look at it. It was a very poorly designed restaurant. don't sit by the view because you will be staring at the bus stop and the parking lot. Not nice. Wouldn't come back, would not recommend. The beer was the only good thing here. Waste of time and money, as it is not cheap.",fu2hoswfjPQ6wV-YP-p_tA,0,0,2,dYi7wiCVpnTXkke5aI7nKw

1241445,2017-08-01,11,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"This was an overall wonderful experience. From beginning to end, everything was spectacular, including the staff and Chef Irvine himself. Our table of four made a reservation through Yelp, which was very convenient. 

To begin the night, we had Hickory Smoked Chicken Wings and Poutine. The Chicken wings were juicy and were covered with a heaping amount of sauce, which was delicious. It had a spicy kick to it, but it was not too spicy where it overpowered the smokey flavor in the wings. The poutine, unlike the traditional version, used crisp tater tots as the base. Surprisingly, the tots were able to stay crunchy from the first piece to the last bite! The pulled pork was also very tender and flavorful on its own, giving the poutine an extra dimension of flavor. The peppered goat cheese also gave a light, creaminess to the dish.

For the main course, our table shared the Tomahawk Ribeye Chop. This is a 40 oz Creekstone ribeye chop, that is served with a side of fingerling potatoes. The steak was cooked to a beautiful medium rare, allowing it to be tender enough to cut through with a butter knife. The steak on its own was very delicious, but it was accompanied by a lemon truffle vinaigrette than enhanced the natural flavors of the beef. The fingerling potatoes were amazing, to say the least. They had a crisp skin and a light, airy middle. They were seasoned to perfection; I probably ate 40% of the table's potatoes! On this day, we also received an extra side of seasonal vegetables to accompany our meal, which contained carrots, broccolini, baby squash, and asparagus that were lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. 

To end the night, we had the English Banoffee Pie and the Warm Bread Pudding. The Pie was a recommendation, and it was the wonderful marriage of an elegant banana cream pie and ooey gooey toffee, without the extra sweetness that you can get from either of the desserts by themselves. It was accompanied by an espresso ice cream. But the real table pleaser was the bread pudding; the bread was warm and soft and not that sweet at all, but the tartness from the rhubarb chutney and the slight sweetness from the strawberry anglaise sauce made this dish absolutely amazing. The two flavors offset each other to give a perfectly harmonized dish. The almond brittle that topped it, though may look like a decoration, also gave an extra crunch the dessert needed that was also very good. 

The entire experience was amazing. The food was amazing, and Chef Irvine checked by our table about 3 times to make sure we enjoyed our meal and to get our feedback on everything. Definitely will be taking my friends and family who visit Vegas here!",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,28,21,5,lETU0dCz0wYOhMxb3Z0ThA

When we arrived there was nobody to seat us however the couple waiting in front of us mentioned a staff member had said they'd ""be right over"" but that was several minutes before. Hubby and I waited a few minutes and when no hostess appeared we went and found our friends in the restaurant who had already been seated. Not sure how long the poor other couple waited.

This place was not busy and our waitress was horrible. My soda wasn't refilled and she never checked on us, she was sooooo slow, and we had to waive her down after we'd been done eating over 20 mins to get a bill. Very distressing was that I asked if we could use player club reward points and she said yes. She took my card, never asked for id or me to sign anything and used $100 worth of points. Never at any casino have I not had my id checked against my card.

The food was meh and lower meh at that for the price. And, for a place that wasn't busy, it took an unusually long time to come out.  My friend's steak was greasy and swimming in chimichurri, they were out of the chicken sandwich I wanted to order yet I don't know why because they seemed to have all the components, my husband's chicken sandwich was fine and everything food wise was really unremarkable.

1428890,2018-03-14,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"My husband and I are big fans of Robert. We made reservations at his restaurant at his restaurant specifically on our last night in Vegas AND to celebrate my husband's birthday. My husband joked he had hoped Robert would be there to wish him a happy birthday. In a matter of minutes, I happened to look at two gentlemen across from us. One was holding up his cell phone and you will never guess who he was talking too. IT WAS ROBERT!!!! I told my husband to look slowly as I think Robert noticed I saw him and asked his friend to put his phone down a little. Luckily hubby caught a glimpse of him anyway which made him smiles.

When our food arrived well our smiles kinda went away a little. My husband said someone on Facebook suggested the French Onion fondue. Before I say anything else, both myself and hubs had terrible colds so our taste buds were not at their best. The fondue was just ok. It tasted more like french onion soup but just extra thick. I thought it would be served in a fondue bowl but it comes out on a platter. It's accompanied with french garlic bread slices. They were delicious and baked at the right crispy texture for dipping. It was just difficult to get the fondue to stick to the bread.  We did not finish it because we wanted to make sure we ""saved room"" for our entrees.

My Burger-

I ordered the Original burger.  Since I had a cold, I wanted something soft but filling. Well you do get that with this burger but with a twist. The description said it comes with PH sauce. I did not ask our waiter what that was because I trust Robert's cooking and recipe development. I wanted to be pleasantly surprised. Well I was surprised but not quite on the pleasant level.

The burger arrived oozing of sauce or cheesy sauce. When my husband saw it he said ""You are going to have a hard time eating that"". He was right. Even though I am a woman, anytime I order a burger (unless it's wrapped in lettuce..don't ask) I am picking that sucker up with my perfectly polished hands! Yes I believe burgers are meant to be eaten with hands not a knife and fork. Well the sauce made the burger patties so slippery, I could not really get more than one bite in before I had to slice and eat it with a fork. I felt defeated. I also thought it would be a thicker patty, instead there were two and they were on the thin side. I thought well at least I have fries.

My Fries-
Since this was a birthday celebration and our last night in Vegas...plus a cold okay enough stupid reasons why I kept the fries when I should asked for veggies when I am supposed to be on a diet!  I was looking forward to them because they looked beautiful. When I bit into the first one, it lacked flavor. Again I am working with impacted taste buds but surely I thought I would get a little kick of something. Alas...no.  The french fries here reminded me sadly of the ones at In and Out Burger. I know there are many fans of that chain. I am not one of them and especially not of their fries. Robert's fries were 1 and only 1 notch above theirs. My only thoughts were it has to be the oil they use to fry them. It must be a different type of oil than beef talo. I know a little about oils because I once worked for Kraft Food Services. I used  to take orders for restaurants so I had an ""education"" on how oils can change the flavors of fries. I was shocked the fries were flat tasting. As a result, I did not finish off the fries which is rare for me.

Overall Experience-
Robert's place is beautiful! Great layout. I was surprised how nice the Tropicana is just in general. It looks practically new when you walk into the lobby. I can see why Robert decided to have his restaurant here. I wish I could rate his food higher. I just expected more because of who he is in the food industry. I am not giving up here. Robert is good at tweaking. It's my hope he will see the reviews here and make some adjustments. I would like to give his place another chance.

The staff is quite friendly and energetic. I did not see anyone with an attitude or goofing off. Everyone walked around as if they had a purpose. We never felt overlooked. 

Suggestion to Public House-

Please make your Original burger simple!!! When you give a menu item that name, one thinks this is their 1st and or easiest rendition. This burger was not easy and definitely not simple.  My last suggestion is compare your fries to In and Out and then your competitors in Vegas like Whalburgers or Gordon Ramseys. Their basic fries just have that flavor you would expect where they taste less ""potatoey"" than yours.  They are not greasy by any means and neither are yours. Good fries don't need to be greasy to be good. Yours just need a little extra umph! :-)

i hope you take this a constructive feedback. Your place adds class to the strip and is a big plus to the Tropicana.

It was nice getting a glimpse of Robert too even though it was on someone's cell phone!",_wPjyduK-knw-AC8hvKiSw,2,0,2,wjoMPDINWDbRiJ4yVMuaEQ

We wanted something unique to RI. His fish and chips, we avoided, too non traditional, we figured it was due to Ramsay's chippy place. We opted for the Fondue Burger and Poutine. Both were really good. We liked it enough to plan another visit to try the Sheperd's Pie and Chicken Sandwich. The service was friendly and efficient, however our server pushed the Tequila a bit much, we get that it's special, but we said we were not Tequila drinkers and he should have let it go.

    This is a new restaurant on ""The Strip"" so that was our reason to try, & neither myself or husband had been inside the Tropicana....... nicer than I expected and had been modernized, SURPRISE! and The Trop offers free parking so that's a PLUS also 

     Let's start with drinks ~ we each ordered ""specialty"" cocktails. A Rum punch for me and a Libra something for the hubby. Both were pricy, to be expected on the Strip, however it seemed to take awhile to get our drinks (and the restaurant/bar wasn't anywhere near full,) Saturday night 6pm ~ this is early for Vegas!!! Anyway the drinks appear.....mine looked like a mini cocktail, I even commented, which I don't do, but I felt this was outrageous! My cocktail tasted good, just small ~ my husbands drink was good and a more fitting size for the price $$$$$

    APPETIZERS ~ we ordered the Lump Crab  Aranchini, just SUBERB! And we were both surprised how crispy golden brown served with a SIRACHA sauce (wasn't scorching & and I am a hot sauce sissy!) DEFINITELY ORDER THESE

    The Heirloom Tomato  Salad, beautifully presented and tasted as DEEELISSSH as it looked looked! Ofcourse Heirloom Tomatoes are seasonal so beware what time of year this is on the menu~

    Main Courses ~ were DELIVERED before we were half way finished with the Heirloom Tomato Salad.......the food runner stood there as wee looked at him kinda surprised......then he asked IF we wanted him to take it back???? We said no, fearing our plates would be placed under heat lamps plus my fish & chips couldn't survive a reheat  we did mention this to our server, who seemed appalled ~ well HELLLLOO, it's the servers fault! Not the kitchen, as the server keys in the order and needs to time their tickets~
     I had the Fish  & Chips  ~ this was not something I would usually order however the menu was limiting for my tastes ~
     The coating on the fish was malted beer batter and served golden brown~ on the menu it comes with a curry sauce, which I asked for on the side....thank goodness as I think it would have made the fried crust mushy (Ewww!) PLUS we not curry people. I did try the sauce, it was OK, mustard like with curry. Remember this is an English Pub style eatery and the English do like curry..... still seems odd curry or Mustard with fish. 
    My Husband had The Skirt Steak served with chips (fries) & asparagus ~ the presentation was Ok & he said is was alright~ 

   We did not order a dessert, however did see many passing by....appeared to be GENEROUS in size ~ 

    The wait staff were eager.....always asking to clear our plates while still eating....this is a training issue ~ constantly filling barely touched water glasses ~ our server was very eager to give us his card once he learned we were locals, like BEFORE we got our cocktails, so we could ask for him upon our return. 

Overall I don't see going back for a meal, and would order a different cocktail,  however the apps/Salad were all worth it!!",bdRS6ZRxf6CNrnULnMI1cg,2,1,3,WKIWFnn9BzfyhpxJO8Ra-g

1666035,2018-04-09,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Mixed experience. The downside is a shame, because it is a simple fix- Robert Irvine's nickel and dime's customers to an outrageous extent. We sat at the bar and had a slightly ornery yet fantastic bartender that we enjoyed. You could tell from chatting with him that that he feels walled in a bit by the curmudgeonly nickel and diming that takes place at this really nice space. One example- we had a fantastic appetizer that was almost like a deconstructed grilled cheese (it was called something like a french onion fondue). There was quite a sizable amount of the fondue, but not enough of the excellent thinly-sliced crostinis (unless you little doused them in a disgusting amount of the fondue). We only ate about 1/2 of the fondue and then asked if we could each get one crostini more- we were told it would be 5$ extra for a basket of them and the bartender seemed quite embarrassed by this fact. It was already 14$ for the appetizer. A great resto wants customers to be satisfied, and wasting 1/2 the appetizer because you are so cheap to not give enough bread to complete it is just off-putting and made us not want to return which is too bad because the bartender was excellent and the appetizer tasty as can be. The bartender's attention to detail with drinks was A+ quality! He surely was a craft cocktail bartender. 

There is also no Happy Hour and the bar was highly empty on a Saturday in April. I wonder if others are also put off by the nickel-and-diming. Something must be off because the space is really nice...not sure we'll be back.",715N9CM6qrRp_lLzgp79rw,0,0,3,4_rOTBGXKprVK4zt4ffr_g

The wild mushroom pizza was rather limp and I couldn't taste the truffle oil that is part of the description on the menu. There are more goat cheese than mushroom and I felt that really overshadowed the ""mushroom"" part of the pizza. A more apt name for the pizza would be ""Goat Cheese Pizza with Mushroom Accent.""

The Shepard's Pie came  in a cast iron skillet. It was so hot I almost burnt my tongue. Ha to wait a few mins to let it cool down. So I ate the lump crab balls in the mean time.  The crab balls were OK, more like a crab cake but round like a takoyaki ball. Not sure if it was worth the $17. But this is Vegas and a Signature Chef's restaurant. Finally got to start on the Pie. It was also OK nothing to write home about. I've had a better Pie else where, Costco, for much less. It was so filling I could not finish it myself. 

The pastrami looked tempting as well, but it looked more like a Ruben, though technically a Ruben is a Pastrami with sauerkraut and cheese. 

Being this was a Robert Irvine Signature restaurant, I was expecting more, but it was somewhat average and over priced, like double. I would have given 5 stars if it met and overcame my expectations.

The seating by the window does have traffic beneath it but lots of signs and people watching, it you take the chair facing the west you can see the strip.  There is more than one chair at the table.

The waitress came over after about five minutes, but we were still figuring out where everyone was sitting so we probably did not look settled.

The beer selection is amazing.  My family wanted to take it home and frame it.

The food is off the chart.  We did every appetizer and the beef tartare dissolved in about 2 minutes we had to order another one for the table.  The skirt steak was to die for but I think and we all agreed the signature dish that will keep people coming back is the shepherds pie with lamb.

There's a giant glass wall at back of the restaurant facing MGM with an intriguing view of the walkway along LV Blvd.  My recommendation is to ask to sit along side the window when you visit. 

You have to accept it for what it is... it's a modern pub. As such, if you're expecting a five star dining experience because of the celebrity chef owner, you may be disappointed. But if you come with the understanding that this is an upscale pub you will likely be highly impressed. 

As a vegetarian I ordered the mixed heirloom tomato salad & grilled ciabatta, triple cheese pizza, and dark chocolate panna-cotta. With the exception of the pizza the food was presented in a very creative fashion and was delicious. My mouth is watering thinking about it. When they brought out the pizza I had to point out that the kitchen forgot the pesto and arugula-- I understood, it was opening weekend. Taste-wise I would recommend the heirloom tomato salad and panna-cotta for any future eaters. I really enjoyed them. 

My husband ordered the French onion fondue and the pastrami rachel. He could not have liked the French onion fondue more and raved about it, but was slightly disappointed with the pastrami taste-wise. Once he reminded himself he was eating a $17 sandwich at a pub and not a steak at a fine dining establishment he was perfectly satisfied with it. Again, I wouldn't expect fine dining.

It was a large hamburger, with 4 Parker House rolls as the bun. The steak & Guinness pie was not very good. The gravy had a very strange flavour, and the meat was very gristly. The fish in the fish and chips was greasy and bland, while the ""chips"" (skinny fries) were served ""loaded"" and were not very good. Prices were high for what you got. We got 2 desserts between the three of us, the bacon-coated cheesecake that the waiter swore was fabulous was awful, and the spotted duck with vanilla cream sauce was sticky and clumpy. For a total bill of almost $100 the food did not meet our expectations, although the service was very good.  Nonetheless, we will not return.",gvvs4u68jw04KVUjiU8GHA,0,0,2,ONLuSBtRltHOp0ZYMVs0WQ

We both decided to try the burgers. You can't go wrong with burgers right??? Wrong! 

I ordered the Public House Burger which came with ham, fried egg, lettuce, tomato and the Parker House Roll. First off, I think the waitress forgot to pick up our orders on time.  My burger was almost cold! But I didn't complain because we waited a half hour to get our food. The Parker House Roll looked like Hawaiian bread but it was so hard and lacked flavor! I didn't even eat 95% of the bun. I substituted the fries for tator tots. The tots were the only things I enjoyed.

My friend got the F and K Fondue burger which came with bacon, mushroom, lettuce and a cheese fondue which I guess you're  to pour over the burger which where the ""Fork and Knife"" comes into play. He hated his bun too and it was a brioche bun. So hard! The cheese fondue was actually really good. We dipped out tator tots in the cheese!

Our waitress sucked! We barely saw her and they weren't that busy. The male runner did a way better than she did. He got our drinks and salt and pepper (btw which isn't on the tables because Robert Irvine doesn't want it on the tables).

The decor and bar area looked very nice but I won't return due to the poor service and horrible overpriced food! Burgers were $23 a piece. Would have been happier with a Quarter Pounder from McDonald's. Yes, you heard me.... McDonald's!

We stopped in for a late dinner, given it sits in the Tropicana casino.  Pretty simple order for my wife and I to split. Wedge salad, classic poutine and public house burger.

Wedge and dressing had good taste, but really under dressed (and I like my dressing on lighter side).

Poutine, nothing about this was good. Dry as far as gravy, actually didn't really see any, cold and coagulated bowl. Pretty sad F on the poutine.

Burger, overall ingredients not bad. Flavor decent temp on the cold side, egg over hard so didn't run. But burger temp was supposed to be pink, it was gray.


Maybe Robert Irvine needs to come back and do an assessment.

It took a few more minutes for our server to arrive but as soon as he came to the table he greeted us with an extremely genuine excitement and took our orders right away. 

We got an appetizer-- the onion fondue (DELICIOUS) and two entrees-- a burger and a pizza. My pizza was soooo yummy, the toppings were well balanced, and the crust was perfection! My friend's burger was HUGE and she said it was delicious. We had a bunch of fondue leftover after we had finished all the bread that came with it and the waiter even brought us more.

The place is very nice, large bar but huge. Way to big for the tropicana. I could never see it being full, ever. We arrived around 6pm on a weekend night for dinner and it was very slow. Seated right away. We were handed the menu and i literally didn't know what to think...i thought this was a pub. The menu is all over the place. No sense to direction at all. You'd think a pub would have pub food, but i guess not this one. 

We ordered our drinks, they took forever to get to our table with them and to take out order. I cant remember the name of the waitress but she had red hair. We ordered our appetizers and entrees at the same time. The apps took foreber to get to the table as well. You'd think because it was so slow the service would be faster. Not this place. Our drinks were never refilled or asked if we even wanted another. 

Our apps arrived stone cold! Wings and a pizza. The pizza had so much flour on the bottom, it was disgusting. The wings were horrible quality as well and the ranch tasted like it wasn't held at the right temp. 

By the time we recieved our entrees we had waited 45 minutes. I ordered the sheppards pie and my partner ordered steak dish. This place served me sheppards pie without crust. I told our waitress and she said the chef didnt like the way it came out and decided not to serve it with crust. What a waste. I've never heard of a chef just saying f*** it and serving it how they want it. My partners skirt steak was ordered medium and was very chared as well.

Maybe their dessert is good, but our waitress handed us the check without even asking. So we just left. We would of talked tothe manager but he looked busy sitting at the bar watching the game. What a joke this place is.

2477811,2017-09-05,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Vegas has quickly become the Mecca of celebrity chef eateries. You'd expect Wolfgang Puck and Jose Andres to be here, of course, but Chefs Gordon Ramsey, Scott Conant, Christina Tosi and Chris Santos all have eateries here, with rumors of more to come from leading lights like Alex Guarnaschelli.  So when I heard that the ""Muscle Chef,"" Robert Irvine was coming here, it wasn't exactly a shock.  But experienced fans and foodies alike know that you NEVER go to a restaurant on Opening Week.  You give them a chance to work out all the bugs and the kinks FIRST, and then try it, so that if stuff still goes wrong, at least you know it's not because of 'premiere jitters.'

So we finally found our way to the Public House, and WOW.  It was everything I expected and more.  Besides the fantastic view of the Strip, with the MGM Grand directly across the street, the food was definitely all that and a bag of hickory chips.  Those who follow Chef Robert know that his particular M.O. is taking comfort food classics and putting a healthier spin on them. (To look at the man, you'd think he only survives on huge haunches of mutton or beef.) So the grub was everything associated with the Irvine brand and then some.

Take the poutine, for example. When you hear the word, if you've had it before, you know what to expect: hot, cripsy fries smothered in rich gravy and ooey-gooey cheese curds.  Chef Irvine's version still has the ooey-gooeyness thing going, but he dials it back with marinated and grilled sliced Shiitake mushrooms and onions and fresh greens, with tender, shredded pork subbing for the usual crispy bacon bits. With just a taste of the curds still asserting themselves, the meaty goodness of the pork and 'shrooms informs the app in a way that finds you not missing all the extra calories!

And can I get a witness on the French Onion Fondue? They just need to bring a LOAF of Ciabatta bread to the table to go with, because the fondue itself is so damn good, you WILL finish it off with a spoon once the bread slices are gone...trust and believe!

Where Bear had the fish and chips for his main course, (and one taste told me to order THAT on our next visit), I stuck with the Shepherd's Pie.  It was lovely enough, but a little on the dry side, because I was missing the gravy that comes from mixing a roux in with the natural juices of the meat - in this case, ground lamb.  I mean the mashed potato crust does provide texture and moisture, and I know it skirts the extra calories.  But not having the gravy was my only...'BEEF' with this dish. (Sorry...)

The 'Banoffee Pie' was something I'd never heard of before, so that was my go-to for dessert. Light, fruity, with just a hint of the toffee within, it's the espresso ice cream that finally sends you into Sugar Nirvana, instead of Sugar Overload. 

Our wait person, Raimonda (sp?) was funny, knowledgeable and kept the drinks and recommendations coming...not to mention that she walked us out and made sure we had her card before we left.  Now THAT is customer service!  

We don't frequent the Strip THAT much, but we'll definitely be requesting seating in her section, the next time we're back down there.

However. I dinged them a star due to the pizza. My last visit in November, I ordered a cheese pizza to go. It says it has arugula/rocket on it, which is my favorite flavor on a pizza. But it didn't say and I never presumed they'd bake the pizza with the arugula on it!!! You NEVER do that! Please! It basically alters  the flavor profile of the arugula from beautifully bitter to murky and dirty bitter. The texture of the baked arugula was like seaweed.

2612572,2017-09-29,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"I'm a fan of Restaurant  Impossible so when in Vegas with friends staying nearby at MGM we had to try Public House.  Unfortunately this place is the type of place that you normally see on Restaurant Impossible.  Robert Irvine would be embarrassed that this place has his name on it. From food to service it was a mess. It is a nice place inside, just the food and service are poor. 

For three couples we started with the French Onion fondue.  It was like a thick onion soup served with bread. The fondue itself was very good however it was served with 6 small slices of under toasted bread.  The amount of bread was small compared to the amount of fondue so we asked for more bread. They charged us $5 for 6 small circles of bread. 

On to the entrees.  Grilled chicken sandwich with watercress,avocado, brie and fig marmalade was overly sweet and missing chicken on one half of the sandwich.  I showed the waiter and he asked what I wanted him to do .I again showed him that half was missing chicken. He said he would bring a piece of grilled chicken. He comes back 10 minutes later to tell me that the chef says it will be about 20 minutes to get another piece of chicken for the sandwich.  Really ?  Instead of waiting since we had a show to catch we were offered a free dessert.  I would have like the chicken sandwich that I ordered. 

Shoestring fries served with the sandwich were an obviously frozen product, barely warm, no seasoning. Robert Irvine would taste one on his show, say ""garbage"" and throw the fries. Complete failure. 

Margarita pizza.  Arrives with warm edges but cold center and bottom. Obviously another frozen product. It was like eating a frozen supermarket pizza. 

Salad of roasted vegetables was a pile of mush. I dont even know how they sent this out of the kitchen. 

BLT wasnt bad but it wasnt good either. Think of the BLT that you make yourself at home. Nothing special, just OK. 

Overall this place was a mess. Waiter was nice but had no clue how to deal with a customer who receives poor quality food.  I do hope Robert Irvines reputation doesnt take a hit because of this place. It really is like a place that he goes in to fix on Restaurant Impossible.

~Good beer list & interesting cocktails

Visited Robert Irvine's Public House this weekend for dinner.  We were staying at the MGM so it was an easy walk across the bridge from MGM to Tropicana.    We were tired and hungry and hopeful that this place would be good.  IT WAS!  

Service was fine, not fantastic as our water glasses were not kept filled, but the server was pretty attentive otherwise and the food came out fast.  They didn't bat an eye that I walked in with my own beer, but I did order a drink later so I guess I evened that out, but I appreciated it.

My husband ordered the Public House Burger.  Its huge, served on Parker House rolls, includes shaved ham AND an egg, and my husband said it was literally the best hamburger he has ever eaten.  I was a little jealous because I love burgers and it looked dang good.  I went with the Pulled Pork Cavatappi and Cheese which is essentially mac and cheese with pulled pork on top.  I was hesitant because everywhere I have eaten mac and cheese in the last year has been a disappointment, but this was DELICIOUS.  The cheesy sauce was creamy AND flavorful with a cheddar taste to it and the pulled pork was perfectly cooked, tender with a tangy and zesty BBQ sauce.  It was wonderful.  I could have eaten more!  Its not huge for a pasta dish that has nothing else with it.  But now, as I write this, I wish I could eat it again.

It is not cheap, but standard Vegas 'TV chef' pricing.  We will definitely be returning... hopefully I'll try something else, but I don't know if we'll be able to with the memory of what we ate!",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,1,0,4,9YUgj0cXIHoZWdlADsGBAg

From the ambiance to the food, amazing experience!
Absolutely loved the decore inside, everything was so welcoming, the staff was awesome! Our server was great help when it came to deciding on drinks 

Now the food!!!
I had a medley of food to eat. Started off with the keep calm and Cary on, signature drink, and it was amazing! They had a great choice of mixed drinks and an even bigger choice of draft and bottled beers. For appetizers i had the French onion fondue and the lump crab arancini 
Oh My Gosh! For the first time have a fondu I hope every other time is as good as this one, the onion the cheese it was purely amazing and delicious. Now the lump crab arancini, heaven sent crab balls!!!!!! Lol, they were sooooooo goood I could I've eaten those and only those, the crab so tender lightly breaded with hints of lemon in the meat! Along with the sauce in the plate became an instant fave! I then went on to have the roasted vegetable salad, absolutely a great salad, I have to be completely honest here and say it wasn't one of my favorite dishes solely because the salad comes with cilantro, and I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, kinda took away from the salad for me, but cilantro aside the rest of the salad along with the tahini dressing was very good! For my entree I had the ponzu glazed grilled salmon, by far the best salmon I've had at a restaurant in a while, the sauce it came with was absolutely amazing and the ponzu flavor was not too salty and just enough hint of lemon, along with the spinach the dish was exquisite 
Last and not least desert! I tried the bread pudding which was very delectable! The sauce was delightful and the almond brittle was great!

I have been here 3 times,  (my meals are comped),  here is my experience.

The skirt steak in my opinion is good (I've had this twice here), however it is overpriced. It is the same skirt steak that used to be served in the Cafe, (the cafe has been replaced by the buffet).  It is the same steak believe me, I have ordered it from the Cafe several times! Same flavor, same fries; the only difference is this one has chimichuri sauce and of course a much higher price, it is $11 more.  People this is Cafe skirt steak with Robert Irvine's name on it!

My spouse had the fish and chips, I had a taste...again in my opinion the fish was not bad, not too greasy.  Here's the problem, you only got 1 piece of fish, that was about $25, it is not worth it.  You can go across the street (MGM or New York New York or even Hooters) and get fish and chips for half the price.  

On another occasion we left when we came in to see this limited menu and was told it's open seating, only to then be directed to the bar. If I wanted to eat at the bar I would go to the bar.  

On another occasion we left when we were told we could not bring any ""outside"" drinks inside the restaurant, when I say outside I am talking about from the casino. We gladly took our drinks and generous tip money to the Biscayne Steak House.

I tend to not let one incident judge my overall experience.  We can all have a bad day.  But I've had enough now.  I feel I can write this review honestly and fairly.

For all of the hype, grand opening parties, million dollar renovation, full size picture on the building, etc. you would expect more.

So far we are pretty disappointed but hoping the two signature dishes we ordered would make up for it. My wife had the Stone fried shepherds pie and I had the F&K fondue burger, medium. Well again, the shepherds pie was so tasteless she had to add the Camembert cheese for my burger to give it any taste at all. My burger was ok, over done and a bit dry.

You typically have a lot of poorly decorated restaurants in Las Vegas, but this place was done nicely. It looked like something straight out of HGTv. There were plenty of TVs all over the restaurant for you to catch up on games throughout the day. They have plenty of drinks on tap and a fully stocked bar.

The service was pretty good. I came to the restaurant with a group of about 10. They did a good job in making sure we were accommodated. For example, one friend wanted chipotle sauce for a dish and the chef came out and talked to him. They weren't able to make it but he offered alternatives.

I ordered fish and chips and the warm bread pudding. With the fish and chips, I wasn't looking for great just something that was safe and regular. I didn't like the amount of bread on the fish, I felt it also could have been seasoned better. I also didn't like what they did with the fries. They have a malted curry aioli and cold slaw in it. The fish sat on top of the fries as well. It gave the fries a fishy taste and it was too salty with no ketchup. I wish they would have separated the two, and just made the fries plain and gave you dip to try it. The fish didn't come with any sauce either so, I guess they want you to eat it plain or with the ""seasoned"" fries. Typically fish and chips are a safe dish, and I couldn't even finish it even though it was my first meal of the day at 1 pm after a night of raging.

I ordered desert and I was told the bread budding and the apple pie were the favorites. I picked bread pudding. Again, I was disappointed. It has some type of cherry sauce. And it just made me disappointed and hungry when I left.

My friends ordered various food and they all had similar complaints of the quality of food. I had friends that enjoyed the Lobster Roll--I wish I would have ordered that. All the entrees looked pretty and they all had a unique twist. 

Overall, beautiful environment wish the food matched up. I won't say I held this place to a higher standard because I didn't know it was Irvine's restaurant until after I had eaten. I didn't look at the store title, my friend just told us to go after walking aimlessly looking for an open restaurant that we didn't have to wait an hour to be seated. If you go, I highly recommend you read the menu before you order and look at the ingredients.",rCoVEszhUNGwNhW34xzxJg,6,0,2,Yd9g0zHI16KJ1T-k_d3bww
2995476,2017-09-06,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Visited this restaurant while staying at the Tropicana on business last week (it's located on the casino floor...kind of tucked in the back so it's easy to miss if you don't know it's there!).  The restaurant opened just a few weeks ago and I was lured by a promise of a free appetizer w/ entree purchase for hotel guests.

The decor is casual but very stylish and it's clear there was a lot of attention to detail when deigning this place.  I sat at the bar since I was eating alone and was served by multiple bar staff who were all very friendly and attentive.  I took FOREVER to browse the menu because literally everything sounded delicious.  I settled on the Gazpacho appetizer, Fish and Chips, and a glass of white wine.

The Gazpacho was incredible, and I don't even like tomatoes!  It had lots of flavor and came with a little scoop of pineapple sorbet floating in the bowl.  The fish and chips was also delicious, but had a twist: the fries had a curry aioli, feta cheese, green onions and bacon on top.  Sounds like a weird combo but it worked!

The bar also had a large selection of draft beers and a huge selection of bottled craft beer, which was neatly displayed in glass-front refrigerators below the bar...almost like an extra work of art!

I highly recommend this restaurant, and will definitely eat here again on my next trip to Las Vegas so I can try another of the menu items!",t7HM5s8CTDbPHXyGeZoehA,0,0,5,8V2urdUP19lnypPGBI_IOQ

3016386,2017-07-27,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Superb!!! On behalf of my husband  an Active Duty Militant of Nellis AFB and the USO we had the pleasure of being special guests of Chef Irvine himself! It was definitely a out of body experience and pleasure! The Grand Opening of Robert Irvine Public House at Tropicana Las Vegas was absolutely superb!!! For starters I tried the Heirloom Ciabatta Salad. This salad bursts of delicious flavors from the dressing to the crisp Ciabatta Bread topped with plenty of tomatoes! My husband has such a distaste for tomatoes but his tastebuds definitely were compromised with this starter dish! Next we tried the Wings which were to die for.  They had little spice to us because we are die hard spicy food eaters but to other in our group they seemed to have a little trouble handling them and they were served with a creamy blue cheese dressing. Also what I found unique was that these wings were cooked in Moonshine and the taste was like no other they are definitely a must try!! We also had the the fries that were topped with bacon and feta cheese...I LOVE FETA!! These fries had an interesting taste if you love loaded fries this is a good try...its not for everyone because of the unique cheese used. 

Don't get full on me just yet we have much more to rave and rant about! Next we had the Steak and Asparagus and OMG I love my meats but the crisp and fresh seasoned asparagus was close to the best in my book. My husband said the Steak was hands down his favorite so its safe to say that one should not be ordered without the other! We tried the Caramelized Onion and Prosciutto Pizza Mmm Mmm Good! Ok so for the last dish that is not in the desert realm my favorite for today's eats was the Marble Rye Bread Pastrami Sandwich...that alone would have gained a 5 Star rating from me! 

Ok so now let's get down to the sweet business...we tried the banana wafer pie with ice cream, the cheesecake served with peaches, the almond pie served with a plum topping and all 3 were MAGNIFICENT!!! 

Now that we are all drooling from these delish descriptions of Excellence let's take a glance at the staff. The staff was great! Our servers were so attentive it wasn't a moment where we needed to call on them for anything they addressed us with what we needed without us asking! Over all this place is a definite GO to and REFER to for anyone in the city of Las Vegas! 

Thank You Chef Irvine and Staff for the excellent experience and Congrats!!! I'm definitely looking forward to trying new things during my next visit !!!

Often at places like this, if you want to do a take out order you ask the hostess. I did, and she directed me to the bar. The first bartender I talked to had me go sit on the other side of the bar to talk to the other bartender. While all the individuals in this scenario were polite, it just seemed like overkill shuffling to me, and then unfortunately there was an order mixup and they gave mine away, so I spent 20 of my 30 minutes of lunch waiting for a salad. I understand that happens, not upset, but it didn't make my shuffling experience any better.

I first came here for lunch, but the server never came, so I left. 

The restaurant was fairly quiet for being located by the casino.
I ordered a burger with French Fries. My food came about 15 minutes later. 

My burger was big. It was cooked well and good, but it wasn't worth telling my friends about. Fries were thin which wasn't really my favorite. 

I thought my credit would cover this food, but I guess it wasn't part of Tropicana. 
I should've confirmed before I ordered because I would have chosen another restaurant if I knew that.

The kitchen and servers were working as a well oiled machine. Our server Keiona provided a thorough explanation of the menu. She was spot on following up throughout our meal. Her associates also helped with removing finished dishes.
 
The dining room is a large space open to the casino on one side and a wall of windows on the opposite side. Seating was comfortable and tables were reasonably spaced. The background music was the same as the casino and was a little on the loud side.

Starting out with the Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho which arrives with a ball of pineapple  sorbet floating in the center of the bowl. First you puree the sorbet so it mixes with the mint and the tomatoes. This was a delicious cold soup on a warm summer day. The pineapple flavor is a nice twist. 
The next appetizer was the Lump Crab Arancini. 4 nice size balls crispy on the outside and tender  inside. The dish is perfectly matched with the lemon tarragon  crème frache, siracha  balsamic glaze. Great flavor. 
Four entrees were selected. 
Chicken Tenders, battered and  served with skinny fries, and celery sticks.

F&K Fondue Burger cooked medium. Black Angus meat, mushrooms, onions, crispy smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, on a brioche roll. Served with fries and a large bowl of fondue on the side. If the fondue is poured on the burger, you will definitely need the fork and knife. The burger was juicy, great smoky bacon. Not a big fan of the fondue. 

Lobster Roll with sofrito mayo, lettuce, heirloom tomatoes on a grilled split top bun. 
A large portion of lobster stuffed into a bun the resembles Texas Toast. Excellent taste, just melts in your mouth.  Focus on the lobster and not the generous serving of fries..

Ponzu Glazed Salmon served over red quinoa,  baby spinach and roasted onion salsa. The salmon was perfectly grilled and the Ponzu sauce provided a sweet tang.

The shepards pie made with ground lamb remarkably did not leave a greasy after-taste. The word I'd use for every mouthful is sumptuous. And then, there was the lamb shank.

Went by to grab a late lunch at 3 pm but were told the hours had changed and they only served a limited menu. And, they were not seating at the tables. Only at the bar. Even though there was a perfectly good table right in front of the only TV playing the game we wanted to watch we were relegated to small high tops which were too far away to really watch the game. For a place that advertises its football specials and as the place to watch the game, you'd think they'd maximize access to the TVs!  The TVs are lined up over the bar, making it hard to really watch any game unless you are sitting at or around the bar. 

Anyways, on to the ""limited"" menu. There were a number of appetizers available but the only entrees were pizzas. 

The mushroom pizza with goat cheese and arugula sounded fantastic from the description. However, it was easily the most disappointing.  It was at its base a cheese pizza with a red sauce base and mozzarella, and to be honest that's pretty much what it tasted like. I couldn't even taste the mushrooms at all. The crust was nicely done on the outside but was too thin and soggy in the middle to really hold up the ingredients. Now I love me a good crust. However, even while the edible outer crust was well cooked, it was lacking flavor.... salt? The featured ingredients were more like an afterthought sparsely sprinkled on top: a few under seasoned mushrooms, a few blobs of carmelized onion, and a bit of goat cheese. It was topped by a reasonable mound of arugula. The arugula was fresh but you could have fooled me that it had a truffle vinaigrette as there was no aroma or taste of truffles. Why even mention the truffle vinaigrette? Overall, I wouldn't have known this even was a mushroom pizza if I hadn't pushed aside the arugula to double check. 

The pepperoni pizza was marginally better, only because the sparse bits of pepperoni actually added a bit of salt to the otherwise bland pizza. My boyfriend had to ask what the brown spiral over his pizza was.... It was  pesto, that had apparently been baked along with the pizza. In my opinion, pesto is best fresh with minimal heating. It would have had better effect if drizzled on post-baking. 

The only thing that was truly good was the hamachi poke, which tasted fresh and well seasoned with green onions, sesame oil, and, I'm guessing miso paste. It was unfortunately served with six-seven small fragments of taro chips, not nearly enough. Our server was relatively absent and we were hungry so we never got the chance to ask for more. 

The service was basic, no frills, pretty standard for a bar I suppose. I guess I expected a little better than standard though.",O4CgCFsGOjKe-Py-cJAo3g,0,0,2,RNkR9UbAQzizEzdG478zbQ

The menu looks good with some well thought out preparations of some standard pub dishes.  I just think they still have some kinks to work out though which is why for now I'd give it 3 stars instead of 4.

With Yelp check in, they offered a free appetizer when you order an entree, score!  We opted to try the Public House Poutine which we both thought was pretty good.  It's some crispy tots topped with pulled pork, shiitake gravy and goat cheese.

The entrees ordered were the Steak & Frites, and the Kurobuta Pork Chop.  I'd say the pork chop was the better of the two, mainly because the overall execution of the steak dish fell short.  The temp of the skirt steak was done nicely (mid-rare) but it was just under seasoned and generally bland. While the asparagus was hot and al dente, the fries on the other hand were painfully stale and cold.  The pork chop on the other hand had more flavor and the other components on the dish hot.

The other thing was the restaurant seemed under staffed and the staff looked kind of out of sorts.  It was about 1/2 full but was still hard to find a server or busser when we wanted to get some steak knives that wasn't brought with our entrees.

The menu looks good and I'd love to try some of the other dishes so it's worth going back for another try.  Hopefully some of the kinks are worked out by then.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,12,6,3,xQIvD7m8j6_tZtdbl-4KEw

3738204,2017-11-27,1,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"I've watched Robert Irvine on Restaurant Impossible for years and the biggest complaint he has for chefs he works with is that they do not season their food enough.  I think it must have been a long time since Robert has eaten at this location as that was the main complaint from everyone at our table as well - no/not enough seasoning on any of the dishes.

Walking in the atmosphere was very nice.  Pub feel with dark wood, but lots of windows so it did not feel dreary.  We were quite excited to eat/drink here.  The bartender was really nice and let us sample several of the many beers on the menu.  After selecting the ones we liked best we turned to food.

Our table ordered the F&K Fondue burger (you pour the cheese over it)/fries, a Pastrami Rachael sandwich/fries, the potato/chicken soup and a Pepperoni pizza. The best comment from our group was 'the beer is good'.  The F&K Fondue burger was too messy to eat with the cheese, so they just had the burger which was just OK.  The Pastrami Rachael sandwich was good, but one side of the bread was totally soggy.  Everyone at the table felt that the fries had no seasoning at all - not even salt.  Most of them were left on the plates.  I was surprised that the potato/ chicken soup did not have chunks of potato or chicken in it.  I could taste the potato, which was the consistency of mashed potatoes, and found only the smallest of pieces of chicken - nothing like I expected.  The pepperoni pizza was good (not great), but kind of hard to mess that up. :)

All in all it was a very disappointing experience.  I really love Robert but I don't think he knows what the food at his restaurant comes out tasting (or not tasting) like.",VvC0o-ipycCZkIgDAGvCKg,1,1,2,HxZ-C1WiXibsT1lowukJJg

For dessert, we shared four dishes--English Banoffee pie with espresso ice cream, spotted dick with vanilla custard sauce, triple chocolate skillet baked cookie, and a dessert Shepherd's pie with strawberries, pound cake, and lemon curd.   The Banoffee pie and spotted dick were favorites with me.

4286270,2017-11-22,5,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Very underwhelmed about this place. 
Especially from a food celebrity expectation. Just saying. 

The restaurant is Block by slot machines so it is difficult to find. 

my friends decided on this place due to seeing a show in the Tropicana. Agreed to meet up for dinner.

Service - 5 stars it was spot on. The waitress even offered to split appetizer on separate bills as their POS system has that option.

Ambiance - the interior and design felt old and tired much like the casino. It felt as though they kept the old interior decor from a previous restaurant in the interest of saving money. not what I expected from a food network celebrity. 

Food - croquettes were good. Not sure I would of used tzatziki sauce with croquettes? But ok. 

I ordered the shepherds pie. Portion was good. Serviced in a cast iron dish. Food piping hot like it should be. HOWEVER it had so much oil in it I think I might of had a heart attack. Please see my photo for reference. no dish in a restaurant should have a pool of oil sitting in the bottom of it. The pie could of used some more veggies in it too. I've had better. 

Yes I could of sent it back - however -

One of my gripes with Vegas restaurants . Many people have a show to attend after dinner. Sending it back to wait for it to be redone properly simply isn't an option due to time constraints. 

I tried a bite of my friends fried liver and onions. the liver was tender and flavorful. Crust was a complement and didn't over power the liver. 

My friends salmon looked spectacular as far as presentation. I didn't get a chance to try it. 

I do recommend their fingerling potatoes. Buttery and creamy on the inside - not dry which I loved. 

Walking out I saw a couple of dishes on other tables that looked way more wow than the ones we ordered. Yes I love to stalk other people's plates in restaurants don't judge me . 

I feel like this restaurant could of been a crown and facelift to the tired Tropicana - but it managed to blend into the mediocre casino and didn't do anything to impress me.

If you are looking for an amazing pub experience I recommend Gordon Ramsey's pub restaurant inside the caesars palace. it will knock your socks off.",L6nrDwHJDyV0KThjON-Kog,11,4,2,7OPUsfyPQt1LmgtuHXw3eg

The lobster salad tasted mostly of cilantro, and as it was served, I couldn't pick out up and eat it like a sandwich.  There mini loaf was not cut with the lobster salad put into the loaf.

I dined with a friend and since neither of us was starving we decided to share a meal. We started with the Mixed Heirloom Tomatoes & Grilled Ciabatta. This was an awesome starter that we both loved. The avocado and lemon ricotta on the toast was so good. It definitely gave the salad a nice pop of flavor. The portion on this was generous and was perfect to share between two people. 

Fish & Chips made for our main entrée. The fish was a nice large piece that was flaky inside and crispy on the outside. We both liked the fish. The chips were pretty good, but we both agreed that the malted curry aioli was not the best flavor. My friend and I aren't picky eaters so it's unusual for us to dislike something. I think the chips would have been better without the sauce. We found ourselves picking through the fries trying to find some that didn't have sauce on them.

The finale to the meal was the Warm Bread Pudding. It was between this and Banoffee Pie. I asked about the two and the waiter explained that the banoffee is served cold and the bread pudding is served hot. The bread pudding wasn't out of this world for either of us. The strawberry anglaise and rhubarb chutney were really good, but the bread part didn't have much flavor. I don't think I would order this again. 

Our waiter was great. He was friendly and attentive. He had good information about the menu when I asked and he definitely knew the menu well. The staff assisting him was on top of water refills and clearing empty plates.

Our server took a while to get to us but no big deal since we weren't in a rush. I got the F&K Fondue burger and my boyfriend got the Public House Burger. Pricey burgers but I guess that comes with dining in Vegas.

The fondue burger was fun- the novelty of being able to pour the cheese over whatever you want is definitely a good time but it does get SUPER messy. Burger was a little overcook.

Had a bit of the public house burger and it was decent- nothing special but good. However, after we left my boyfriend started feeling ill but we thought it might have been the drive. He couldn't keep down any food we had after that and was sick all night. He felt better the next day so we ruled out the flu. We suspected it was the burger since that was the last thing he ate before he got sick. 

It was a bummer and we probably won't go back- there are plenty of other burger places on the strip.

4655942,2017-10-24,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"While staying at the Tropicana back in August, my girlfriend and I woke up famished after a night on the town and decided we didn't want to wander too far for lunch, so we went to the lobby and followed the signs to Robert Irvine's Public House, just steps from the concierge. I've always liked Irvine on Restaurant: Impossible due to his rational yet seething attitude when dealing with careless restaurateurs and staff - I always crack up when he loses it, but he always manages to come up with a winning plan to turn things around. Reality television aside, the main reason we stopped in, aside from the location, was the well-rounded pub grub menu and, of course, hair of the dog. 

Upon walking in, we loved the open concept with a large wraparound bar that livened the place up. Seating options abound - the place was pretty empty when we dined for lunch -  both at the bar and at a variety of tables. Our server was a charismatic man in his forties who took care of our orders promptly and without error. 

The menu prices at Robert Irvine's Public House are just above average for pub grub; appetizer options range from $14 - Spiced Lamb Croquettes or the Traditional Poutine - to $18 - Lump Crab & Pancetta Arancini or Japanese Yellowtail Poke. The salads are all modestly priced for the creativity, but the portions are small for what you're dishing out. The burgers, sandwiches and pizzas are the best bang for your buck - all are between $12 and $23. Keep in mind this is the lunch menu; on the dinner menu they feature more of the same, plus some mains.

I chowed down on the Stone Fired Shepherds Pie ($24), which for some reason was featured on their lunch list at the time, yet looking back on it now I'm only seeing it listed for dinner. The pie came loaded with ground lamb, onion, English peas, and a mashed potato crust. It was prepared excellently, the lamb not dried out nor sitting in liquid, and the peas were slightly sweet and soft, contrasting the fluffy potatoes beneath the crust. At first the portion seemed undersized served in a cast iron pan, but I left stuffed and ready for more partying! Adding to that, my girl thoroughly enjoyed her Grilled Chicken Breast sandwich ($17), featuring a soft chicken breast, watercress, avocado, fig marmalade, Brie, balsamic mustard, all loaded on a toasted Ciabatta. All sandwiches and burgers come with a side of fries. She seemed to enjoy the cocktail she got and I had a chance to down some beers from Colorado's now-famous New Belgian Brewing - one of many craft beer selections on the extensive drinks menu. 

Robert Irvine's is a solid contender for upscale public house munchies, with innovative yet accessible food dominating the menu. Having the option to try traditional dishes ranging from Oysters (market price) or Steak Tartare to Braised Lamb Shank or Ponzu Glazed Grilled Salmon is the type of variety many pub diners are seeking more of, so good on Irvine for stepping up to the plate. The service was excellent, the prices were average (for Vegas, at least) and the food - pretty damn good! To bump this up to five stars, however, I think a touch of culinary modernization couldn't hurt.",63NmoNMOek4R5DX7WA9ffA,0,0,4,7Qy1KK4r0B7mq2HRip-tcw
4663913,2017-08-16,1,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Since my girlfriends and I were staying at the Tropicana, I was eager to try out Robert Irvine's newest restaurant. Part convenience, part foodie, and the need to explore brought on the excitement both times I went during our stay.

The place has a very cool interior which is a completely open, fresh, and modern. 

The food I must say was really good. Our favorites included the asparagus (yes you read correctly, the asparagus), skirt steak, and chicken wings. The wings are dressed on a plated garlic bread strip and covered with spicy buffalo sauce. The wings have a really nice kick to it!

My favorite was the F&K Burger... it was out of this world delicious. I chose to have the warm fondue cheese that accompanies the burger to be set on the side. Well after a few moments, I ended up pouring some of the deliciously warm and butter tasting cheese over the well dressed burger as they show on the menu. Then I'd dip each bite into the bowl of fondue cheese. What an experience!

As a new restaurant, there are a few kinks that still needs to be worked out. For example, our server Wendy was a nice lady but clearly had too many tables. She did her best to get us our missing items as quickly as possible. Since we were on vacation and having drinks, the wait really didn't bother us however others may have had an issue. 

The other issue was that one drink in particular that my niece wanted was unavailable due to a few missing ingredients. 

Since the restaurant has only been open for just 15 days when we went, I can still say that this was a really good restaurant to visit. Yes there are a slew of other restaurants in the area but here you can expect quality food, simple yet palette pleasing dishes, nice decor, great view, and a different spin on your favorite dishes.

I had the duck confit that was really good. The first time I was there I had the shepherd pie that was also amazing. My wife had the the fish n chips both times and said the flavor was nice but it had more batter on the fish than was to her likings. I'm really glad they have a kids menu which we order off the first time (cheeseburger) but this time the kids slit the fish n chips. 
For an appetizer we had the French onion fondue which I would not classify as a fondue but just a regular ole dip. Don't me wrong it was pretty tasty but it only came with 5 pieces of bread so we got a second helping which added 5$ to the menu. It was good but 18$ for an app was more than I really wanted to spend. 
Last we hit the dessert menu. Almond cake, I don't need to order that again. It was very underwhelming. The flavor the nuts the peaches were all real flat.

The prices might seem steep - $24 for a burger and fries - but the servings are colossal. The patty is an 8 ounce black Angus beef burger. I ordered the pub burger, which has ham, an over easy egg, and miso mayo, and is served on a buttermilk biscuit. As soon as I took a bite, the bottom of the bun disintegrated due to the egg yolk and other juices. Tasty, but completely impractical. 

The meat itself didn't have the big beef flavor I expect when I pay this much for a burger. It was okay, but that's all. I grind my own sirloin and other beef cuts when I make burgers, and I know they could do better. Maybe it was just under seasoned?

But, everything else was great. The tater tots are super crispy, and the skin-on fries are excellent. My wife got a grilled chicken and bacon sandwich that was perfectly cooked with a nice ranch dressing. My daughter got a phenomenal buttermilk fried chicken with a tangy citrus sauce.

Big fan of Robert Irvine's TV shows, so I was looking forward to actually trying some of his 'product' first-hand.   While my horrible experience isn't attributable to him, it left a bad enough impression, plus there are plenty of other great venues in the Las Vegas area, that I have zero desire to give his place a second try.

A friend & I showed-up at about 8:15PM last night (a Monday evening).  No line at the hostess stand, and plenty of dinner tables & seats looked open & ready inside.    The hostess informed us that they'd just cleared out a large group (VMWare convention is in-town), so that they were re-assembling the dining area, a table for us would be ready in ""a couple minutes,"" and that we were welcome to sit at the bar while waiting for our table.

  We sat at the bar, & I was happy to see they've got a very impressive selection of beers.  We each ordered one beer.  I'm a 'lightweight' when it comes to alcohol & since I had driven us to the Tropicana, alcohol consumption was a careful event for me.  But because I believed we'd be there for at least an hour and that I'd eat a large meal, I got a beer that sounded interesting, but had a high volume of alcohol in it.   The beer was great. Eventually the bartender asked if we'd like to run a tab, and I said yes, because we were waiting to be seated for dinner, & would like the two beers just added to our dinner tab.    She informed us that wasn't possible -- drinks ordered at the bar had to be paid for at the bar.  OK, a nuisance, but no big deal...  We finished our beers after about 20 minutes, and still had not been seated at a dining table.  We had to flag-down the bartender to pay for the drinks, then we got up & went to the hostess stand, about 12' away & in plain sight of where we'd sat at the bar.  By now, there was a small line of people waiting in-front of the stand, but since we'd already checked-in, we stood towards the side & patiently waited for a couple min.  The hostess made eye contact with us, and I politely mentioned to her -- the same hostess we originally dealt with about 22 min prior (the one who said our dining table would be ready in ""a few minutes"" & suggested we sit at the bar in the meantime) that it'd been a while, & we were still waiting for our table.  She gave us a blank look, and asked my name.   I gave it to her, and she checked what apparently was a waiting list that she was carrying, then said something like ""I don't see your name on the list.""   Well of-course she didn't -- she never asked for my name when we first checked-in with her.    Without an apology or any sign of guilt, she then had the audacity to add my name to the *bottom* of the list, with about 5 names above it.    Thankfully, there was a second hostess that I think must have known that the other one was incompetent, as she came over immediately afterwards & told us she'd try to seat us quickly.   But only as we were being led to a dining table were we informed by this other hostess that we could have ordered & consumed dinner while seated at the bar. and that for some reason, the only food items they were able to serve that night were burgers, pizzas, and one other type of food, *not* the full menu.

Upon hearing this, we'd experienced enough of Robert Irvine's Public House treatment, and opted to dine elsewhere.

While choosing whether or not I am sober enough to drive a car is always *my* responsibility, the sheer ineptitude we experienced at Robert Irvine's Public House caused us to leave long before we anticipated, and without consuming the food which would have sobered me up enough to get behind the wheel.    Had we just gone there for a beer, or considered that their incompetence could have resulted in us leaving The Tropicana sooner than expected, I would either have not consumed the one beer, or would have chosen a beer with less alcohol.     We ended up having to just kill time wandering around The Tropicana for about 45 minutes before I felt I was safe to drive my car.  Obviously, doing so was important, but it was also more of my valuable time wasted by the incompetent hostess at Robert Irvine's Public House, & as a result, I have zero desire to return to it, and very little interest in even returning to The Tropicana.   

As a fan of his various shows, including the one where he'd help train/re-train restaurant staff & owners on customer-service, the irony of my first & likely last experience at one of his own restaurants isn't lost on me.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,3,0,1,pzuuDlixB0VXp0Oq8YVNyw

We went to have a quick burger here at 4:45 as I've had a few beers here in the past without eating and thought we'd try the food, we were told by the hostess that the whole place was reserved and if we wanted anything we would have to sit at the bar and use a very limited bar menu.  There  were only six people at one table in the entire place and a pretty full bar. Never once were we told that the full menu wasn't served until 5 and we could wait. So, we went over to the Tap at the MGM and ate there, the burger was amazing and the staff were great I highly recommend the Tap at the MGM. Back to the Public House we went back about an hour and a half later and the restaurant was still empty, I asked for the manager and told him what happened. He danced around with ""well, some of those tables are reserved and people come and go"" I pointed out that they were just as empty as they were an hour ago and that his hostess was an idiot for not finding a place for a paying customer.      The manager then started yelling that I better not call her names. (she wasn't there and I was referring to her lack of customer service and actions) he then told us to leave. I doubt if I would ever return and this possibly includes staying at the Trop. I owned a place rather like this and would never let a customer leave unhappy.

Chefs cook what they love to eat.
Therefore, if I want a solid body like chef Irvine, I should eat what he cooks.  

WIN!

Cheese curds, deep-fried this and that, butter milk, butter sauces, oh yeah, let the body sculpting begin!

Straight up, take pub classics from around the world, enhance them by boosting up their flavor with American excess and you have Robert Irvine's Public House.  Just keep in mind, sometimes messing with the classics doesn't always mean better.

Starters are meant to be shared. Top props to the steak tartare.  Tender, hand cut beef, traditional prepared with onions egg and capers, but improved with the addition of lemon zest which serves to bring out the metallic flavor of the beef.   The crab, pancetta and mozzarella arancini, also very good. Creamy rice on the inside with the crispy breading on the outside. Crème fraîche and tarragon blend the flavors while a siracha and balsamic glaze adds an unexpected earthiness.  Finally the Public House poutine. This is an example of why you should not mess with the classic. Crisp tater tots smothered in pulled pork and shiitake onion gravy, goat cheese, and sorrel.  Heavy, the sweetness of the onions evident, goat cheese adding creaminess.  Flabby.  Greens do nothing for the flavor or health factor of the dish.

For mains, great braised lamb shank.  Not overcooked and stringy, this one tender and deeply flavored. Solid mussels and frites.  Relatively pump mussels steamed in a creamy beer and butter sauce.  Dipping the crisp fries into the cooking liquid after swallowing down a mussel, ahhh.  Agreeable fish and chips, a heavily battered properly cooked piece of cod on a pile of thin cut fries is tasty enough.  The curry aïoli atop the fries makes the dish. The addition of coleslaw bacon and feta is puzzling. Lastly, the shepherd's pie, no complaints.  Not excessively oily, the cook ground lamb imparts just the right amount of gaminess to the rustic dish.

Service is a work in progress. Still clumsy. It should improve with time

Well-chosen list of beer and gastropub staples.  Typical resort markup.

Oh hey, I feel my belly is firmer.  Maybe the start of my six pack abs?  I better go back and try more.

The table next to us, that sat down after us, got their food after us, and finished eating after us, received their check before we were given ours.

5279993,2017-11-16,3,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Happy to wander the world seeking out great meals but not so fond of Food Television there was no real reason to know Robert Irvine before the Chef opened up shop at The Tropicana, and although the name Public House still seems terribly unoriginal with two additional Restaurants similarly dubbed less than 3/4 mile away it looks as though the Restaurant Impossible star's spot is doing quite well based on a visit Saturday evening

Reportedly built at the request of Tropicana High Rollers in need of a place to use comps, the property certainly never considered a dining destination in a city filled with several Resorts that could legitimately make such a claim, Robert Irvine's Public House officially opened its doors in July after significant hype including a daredevil stunt during which the TV-Star lept from the top of the white tower over a year prior, Chef Scott Green making his return to Las Vegas after a stint in Canada to head up a kitchen focused on accessible fare and Irvine's British upbringing

Admittedly a first-timer at The Tropicana, its southerly location on The Strip and lack of dining venues never really a draw despite being one of the few places in town still offering free parking, it is upon entering the front doors that signs immediately point guests left towards the sprawling room with a bar and lounge up front plus several tables and banquets lining the space behind, a dinner rush of over 150 covers seeing the place slammed on a big football weekend but a party of four happy to wait until the assigned 8pm reservation time while sitting at a 1st come-1stserve high top.

Doing a reasonable job of isolating itself from the floor, a walkway between slot machines and Public House's doors at least 15 feet wide, it is only once diners make their way to the back that the full scope of design can be seen, varying shades of wood comprising floor and ceilings sandwiching comfortable orange leather seats, stone walls and a big glass window facing Las Vegas Boulevard outside.

Dining with three frequent tablemates and thus able to sample a wide range of the menu it was after others had requested Cocktails and Beers featuring flavors like Peanut Butter and Passion Fruit that Food was ordered, a total of 12 savories far more than would be recommended for even a group of six and beginning with Appetizers including Deviled Eggs atop Mustard alongside Tater Tot ""Poutine"" with Pulled Pork and Goat Cheese plus smoky Wings featuring Irvine's own Buffalo Sauce and 2 styles of housemade Dressing.

By no means a bad way to begin, even those tired of ""small plates"" and ""gastropubs"" likely to find lots to love in the Tots that remain crispy beneath Mushroom Gravy and a bubbling dish of French Onion Fondue meant to be slathered on Toast, it was with some additional Bread requested and Gruyere still molten that a trio of Salads soon appeared, the Heirloom Tomatoes vibrant and acidic amidst fresh Herbs and Garlic while the ubiquitous Beet Salad outperformed many thanks to Grapes and lightly pickled flavors, the same sadly not to be said for a dish simply listed as ""Roasted Vegetables"" that featured good Produce but seemed poorly conceived as the Sauce was too thick to be considered 'Soup' and too runny to function as Dip without getting messy.

Using a pair of bar items plus thick-cut Steak Tartare served with housemade Potato Chips as a sort of mid-course, crowds beginning to dwindle around 9:30, suffice it to say that the much publicized F&K Burger smothered in Cheese is tasty but plenty in its smaller ""Slider"" format while the shrunk-down Fish & Chips unfortunately suffered from Cod being too bland, the bed of matchstick Fries showing far better amidst Bacon, Feta and thickened Vinegar.

Rounding out savories with two items one won't just find anywhere in Sin City, the Buttermilk fried Duck Confit crisp and intensely flavored but balanced by a Jean Georges-esque combination of braised Greens plus ""buttery"" Hot Sauce and Irvine's signature ""Stone Fired Shepherd's Pie"" achieving where many others fail by letting the Potatoes get a little bit crispy which adds texture to the classic Lamb filling, it was with most already stuffed that four Desserts arrived with each presentation proving at least enough to warrant a bite from each...and several more for others.

Part classic and part clever, items like Apple Pie and Blue Cheesecake saved for a later date, it was instead with bites of Robert's famous Banoffee Pie that things got underway and taking a far lighter approach than most to the combination of Bananas and Toffee while mellowing sweetness with Espresso Ice Cream the presentation sets a high bar for the dish locally, the same to be said of traditional Spotted Dick served in warm Vanilla Sauce while the Dark Chocolate Skillet Cookie and ""Dessert Shepherd's Pie"" are definitely best shared, the former as rich as it sounds while the item in cast iron riffs on Trifle with sliced Berries, Meringue and cubes of Pound Cake",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,6,4,8DFHGmrIRs_WM8Aw3Ejk7w

There was a lot of flavors and it was tasty.  I devoured all off this gravy goodness.  This is the reason for star #2.  The dinner went downhill after this.  I ordered fish and chip.  It was very bland and just one large fish.  The batter and fish lacked any seasoning.  The fries had some thing like egg on them, but wasn't quite sure what it was.  I left 3/4 if the dish on the plate. The wife got the Public House burger and ate less than quarter of it before she was finish.  The wife felt that I make better fries (from the frozen store bought one) than she was served.  For some strange reason, there was lack of salt and pepper on the table - every table!

Now to the rest of our experience - the service was less than desired.   Glasses were left empty.  Server all seemed rushed.  Not once did the staff asked how the food was.  The list could go on. When we asked for the check with 3/4 of our food still on the table and said no to a doggie bag, the waitress looked confused, but never asked if something was wrong with the food.  We weren't looking to have this comp'd but wanted the staff to care.   

Over all, I wouldn't come here for more than drinks and appetizers. The decor along with the sub-par food and weak service made this place feel more like a hotel Cafe.   We will not be back.",8VZVynKwkqKcFSRxAIpgBA,0,0,2,us_-8t3cSdkT_KlCFnn29g

Sharing plates to try everything, we had the duck confit, poutine, wild mushroom flatbread, and shaved kale salad. We were very pleased with all of the above! The poutine was so pretty! On tater tots, loaded with goat cheese and gravy it was to die for. The duck melted in your mouth. The salad was super tasty and cut into a size you didn't have to get messy with.

However, I must confess they righted each one of them.  But before they did we were stunned and thought: ""How could Robert Irvine's own restaurant suffer from the same failures as the very restaurants he rescues."" It was almost on oxymoron.  
Strike one:   The hostess let's us know the father gets one free pint.  Then the waitress says the same and lists them: ""Bud Light, Coors Light, Michalob Ultra and Corona only"" so I joke with here and say ""What do all those beers and making love in a canoe have in common"" My wife chimes in before the punch line: ""Some thing are worth paying for."" We joke: ""Robert sure is a cheap skate."" So we order our drinks a prosecco and a La Chouf on draft.  The punch line: ""They are all fucking close to Water.""
Strike two: Waitress comes back with prosecco but no draft.  WTF.  ""I am so sorry but today is our last day of this food menu and draft list. We are out of the La Chouf.""  Just exactly how is your last day of your menu any excuse and now my problem???  Anyhow I ordered another, Delirium, which was great and the waitress apologized and the manager comped the draft. So we think strike one and two erased right??? Nope Strike Two continue like a Star Wars saga or a runaway train.  We order all appetizers including the croquettes.  Waitress states: ""I am so sorry but we might not have the croquettes as it is the last day of our menu and we make them here from scratch yada, yada, yada"" Who gives a flying f@ck right???  Waitress will check.  Not 30 seconds later I see another waitress bringing out two orders of croquettes.  The wait staff is suffering from fake news, and bad management.  
Strike Three: One of our appetizers was the French fries with bacon and chèvre.  They would have been great if brought out HOT as opposed to room temperature.  Of course we complained and about 5 mins later a new order came out hot and it was comped also.  
All in all the place was good.  We will probably be back on another Vegas trip.  But man, when you have a prominent successful TV show about rescuing restaurants you can't afford a hitch in your own ride.  Time to look in the mirror first before you flunk out of Vegas.

For a celebrity Chef that I have never thought had any reason to be a celebrity Chef I will say this was spot on!  I had a beer and the fish and chips. Now the beer selection was very ordinary, nothing special. The fish and chips, for a British guy he should be absolutely ashamed!  The breading was flat and bland, greasy and very blah. The fish itself was very good, I will give them that. The fries, very very average. The curry sauces was bland, with feta???  Not a combination you would pick but I was good, love feta  

As the average continued I had a Manhattan which was made with a cherry from a jar, same shit you'd buy at Target...you're a celebrity chef and this is what you offer???

If you're wondering where the restaurant is located, just stand outside and walk towards the Hooters Casino next door.  PH is hard to miss as it looks like the newest construction to the Trop in 60 years.  Here there's plenty of parking and it's free.

The restaurant's really nice and with plenty of space.  Right up front is the U-shaped bar area with two dozen or so taps easily in sight.  Next to that is a wide lounge area great for parties.  When I was here, there was a bachelorette party next to a group from a convention.  There's even shuffleboard.  There's so many tables in the dining area, you probably won't need to worry about reservations.

There was so much good stuff on the menu, I couldn't decide and was taking forever.  So I just went with the F&K Burger ($22) which had crispy bacon, caramelized onions, and mushrooms.  It did not disappoint.  Juicy and topped with a fluffy shell of a bun.  I also went with the Ahi Tuna Sashimi ($17) which was nice light dish and tasted so fresh.

5877356,2018-06-12,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,My husband and I stopped in for a quick dinner and had the worst experience I've ever had a restaurant. A drunk guy made rude comments to my husband and I at the bar for no apparent reason. The bartenders were incredibly unprofessional and irresponsible in protecting the rights of their guests. Super disappointed that the drunk aggressor was given another beer after ruining our dinner!!  It's by far one of the saddest and most disappointing moments I've ever experience as a customer.  I will not support a business that fails to keep their guests safe and protected from being harassed.,y2dg8Oa2dZxb1evdRkmwZQ,0,0,1,lkzK1idN5aga9qomDuLXpQ
5897838,2017-09-05,1,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Robert, your own restaurant needs severe help! Super disappointing on nearly every level. Let's start at the beginning shall we...first of all it wasn't busy at all (only about 1/3 of the  tables were occupied) and we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait for a 4-top table. I guess it's my fault for not recognizing this as a sign to run the other way. Next complaint is the food. We just ordered appetizers to share, which we would typically expect to be no more than a 15 minute wait, but it was over 30. Steak tartare was warm & flavorless, chicken wings cold and dry, unexpected large chunk of brown papery yellow onion skin found in the mushroom pizza. I do have to say the Poutine was awesome though. After the steak tartare was a flop, our servers suggestion of the Korean Spareribs was superb & delivered to the table while still hot. Due to the problems we had, our server went and talked to the manager and comped both the tartare and the pizza. I mean it's nice that they were comped, but I really just wanted to speak to the manager. He apparently was too busy doing nothing to come by though & just said bye to us on our way out when he should have been helping his staff. Also on our way out we noticed how the food temps came out all wrong. The food runners are pulling things out from under the heat lamp and placing them on trays while they wait for the rest of the items to be made, not only is this not appetizing, but it could be unsafe. Food should be delivered as it becomes ready. It's way more reasonable to have things delivered separately and at the correct temp than wrong temp but all delivered at once. And finally our server, now granted he was probably overwhelmed by the kitchen problems that the manager wasn't assisting him with, but never got any water refills during our long wait, and he realized after he had charged my card that one of the items he was going to remove was not actually gone, so more waiting while he deleted and rebilled. Really the whole experience was a train wreck & I expected so much more from the man that fixes so many restaurants with the exact same problems",LqSxTQXWp2csyOCftoWE4w,0,0,1,C6z9FtinYES16XmwiVKG5A

5956740,2017-12-04,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Everything was delicious! 

We ordered:
Starters:
steak tartar (yummmm! Never had anything like it!)
Crochets 
Fondue ((cheesey goodness)

Dinners:
Skirt steak (my fav of everything)
Shepard's pie (tender steak in a soup kind of lot pie.
Rabbit pie (huge, way to much food, and the meat was too gamey for me, my friend tht ordered said she wouldn't order it again.

Dessert;
Banana pudding ( most popular, tasty and light. Big enough to share)
Blue cheesecake ( friends liked it and that it tasted like blue cheese, didn't try cuz I don't like blue cheese.

Drinks: riseling, space dust, and unicorn tequila shots( a must try!!!! Soooo smooth!) 
A friend also tried ordering a blue moon, but they don't carry it but Casey said they have something better and our friend loved it.

Casey was a fantastic server that made great recommendations. His service was spectacular and made our evening that much better. He deserves a raise!",GSNMFhQ35gIbh0J76kfnWA,1,0,5,0lX5w1WyPwTkF0z3-1WESg
5961136,2017-08-08,2,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Kind a pricey for what you get. The food is ok but not spectacular. Nothing you go home and write about, Had the lobster sandwich. Bread was a little stale and not a big fan of the dressing for it. My two last lobster sandwiches were from local food trucks and there were clearly better and tastier. Also had the French onion fondue. Like a mix of cheese fondue and French Onion soup aka cheese sauce with a bunch of onions in it. Hard to scoop up.  I would prefer to have those two dishes separate. The chicken wings were just as good as next door at the Hooters but priced way higher.  Last I had the crab balls. It was hard to taste the lump crab. Again many places have super delish crab cakes in town that I would much rather prefer. Best part Robert Irvine was walking around and giving photo ops. Without Robert in the room, the place is clearly over priced. They should step it up a notch or lower the price. The competition in town is tough. This would not be the first, second or third places I would go to for this kind of food. The room is really loud.",ZNCU9UFTa_UWmkwMztkEbA,0,0,3,Pl-0VIhomd6yfxNxXztAgg
5969898,2017-11-05,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"Was there the second day it opened for lunch. Great reception, nice wide open airy space. Had a great vibe. Staff was very attentive and even walked us out after our meal.  
I had the special bacon burger - my advice YES get the burger - NO don't pour the fondue cheese over the burger. I cut my burger up and dipped bites into the sauce. The sauce is heavy, but ooohh so good. 
Good choice of beers on tap. 
Making plays to return in the evening 

2nd here. This time after SEMA show for dinner. We had the porkchop and the skirt streak. My I my this was an excellent meal. The skirt steak was served with a delicious and slightly spiced sauce, asparagus and fries.  The pork chop was huge, had great flavor and served with mashed potatoes. The sauce was excellent.  Next time I am going to sub for the mashed potatoes.  
They now have Guinness on tap! 

Our server was excellent and attentive.  We were cracked up when we heard the sound of what thought were flip flops dragging on the floor  only to see the manager wearing some fancy like slippers. Really slippers?!?  Shoes may slip on but these were slippers - no backs on the heels.  Kinda weird we notice stuff like this!!!!",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,1,1,5,2fqAhlmRHj4TOO3wKrOOIQ
5972355,2017-10-11,0,wTDsirjG5uWh9go8RLvJcQ,"I was Robert Irvine's fan, and this was my first time visiting his restaurant.  Unfortunately the food here was disappointing.  Most of the food I ordered today was just not spot on and just ok. 

I started with a glass of watermelon cooler as the drink since the waiter highly recommended it.  But it tasted just like watermelon juice heavily diluted by vodka.  The waiter said it would be very refreshing, and I would be able to find watermelon pieces inside.  Unfortunately I didn't get it.  And I also found that it was charged as $13 instead of $12 according to the menu.  Not a big difference, but I am wondering how many times they have charged customers with the wrong price.

My appetizer was crab & prosciutto arancini.  To be honest, I've never had arancini before, but I can tell some thing was not right.  The crab and prosciutto tasted good together, and the cheese did not overpower them.  But the cheese was not melt down thoroughly, so it tastes like chewed bubblegum.  And the size of those arancini varied a lot, and the sauce added one more creamy element on top of the creamy inside of arancini.  I would say it lacks of contrast here and make it tastes too heavy.

Duck confit was my entree.  It was an option of buttermilk fried chicken, but I didn't expect the duck confit would come with a fried breaded skin.  I somehow feel it works, since they nailed the tender duck confit and added a crispy skin to it, but the crispy skin somehow lacked the crunchiness.  Maybe it was because of the breading.  And the sauce underneath the duck was super sour that I felt the chef spilled a whole bottle of vinegar into it.  Personally I don't think the sauce went well with the duck or the vegetables aside.  Once the vegetables were soaked in the sauce, they tasted like pickles.  Maybe that was the idea, but I unfortunately cannot appreciate it.",nh5xqonoQXGRsYfVVsGRrw,0,0,2,O22l9j8XCLFkq_pnNWJP6g
