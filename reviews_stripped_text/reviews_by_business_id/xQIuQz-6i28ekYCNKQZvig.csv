Beware if you have a corn allergy, they replaced the egg with sweet corn and supposedly some spices?  It was hard, dried out, and had no flavor.  Until they go back to the original recipe I will no longer eat here. The staff is great and if you are eating something other than fried rice the rest of the food is great.",Q5pO4T7zv2FN1wzKQEyRqQ,0,0,1,dWjQHYsHyBf6IIG_xK0Jmg

And their restroom is always clean as well as the dining area. I think they have a pretty good management. My favorite food here is Kungpao Chicken. I like it with their chili sauce.",GEWZ3jvNkUaGTUZVoT7Xrw,0,0,4,MxxtnX7a59FCv3VrpiNV9A

However, it is always made fresh at the store and it is very flavorful. What they do not have in authenticity they make up for it in consistency and good value.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,1,0,4,nXXhVSlX6s7j4XiDV0oYcg

They had a little mixed vegetables left and she offered me to wait a few minutes for fresh mixed veggies. This made the whole meal nice and hot. I don't know here an,e but she was tall and black. She did a really great job and I hope she's recognized for it since it was just before she left for the day and could have easily coasted in her last few minutes, but she didn't. Rare work ethic. The meal was delicious, fresh and hot and reasonably priced. The seating was comfortable and clean. Whole experience was very good.",GKMclGgHTtuBKZDUQFzj4A,0,0,5,FWZkEPWLzsAn9byg20pF6w

That's horrible service. So if your hungry don't come here. And they didn't even have white rice.  How do you open and jot have the food ready.,eFagOZH38G-dkE0Rd7Cngw,0,0,1,ifdUPdYg6jzA1GWt2SyqQA
1880214,2018-04-15,0,xQIuQz-6i28ekYCNKQZvig,"I have been to this particular Panda Express several times and the offed has always been great. Not this time. The service was the same as always. I was offered to sample something. The server was friendly and I was through the line in just a few minutes. This time however, the food was lukewarm and that affected the taste greatly. I ordered half noodles, half fried rice. Tasted the same as always but was lukewarm. The orange chicken wasn't hot either and it tasted like it was over cooked and it was difficult to bite into. I also had the sriracha shrimp which also was not at the proper temperature. The last time I had it the shrimp was covered in a somewhat crispy batter. This time it was soggy. I might try this one again because this could have been only a bad night for the chefs but its no excuse. If its bad next time it will be the last time.",n0mvVYcr4FR5l4Jh7B-dFg,0,0,3,-BJ_bGmUabO3AOMTdMfCFA

This location shares space with Chipotle and a no-name pizza shop, so it's usually bursting with tourists -- some who smell better than others.  Seating can be scant, but I lucked out on my last visit and somehow wrangled a single chair and small table.

The food was definitely Panda quality and I recommend their famous Orange Chicken and their newer Beijing Beef, which came along during the Summer 2008 Olympics.

Odd moment, though: at the end of my meal, a homeless man approached me and asked if I'd buy him dinner.  After I politely refused, he asked if he could finish mine (there was very little left).  I agreed, he took ownership of my fork, and quickly polished off the remnants of my meal.  I rushed out the door, didn't look back, and hopped over to Casino Royale to double fist $1 frozen margaritas for the monorail ride back to my hotel.

Oops, so much for what happens in Vegas. . .",ywf1G9IvDLg_KytwLimFCw,0,0,3,IFLZXkaBah5ZJ4wlNyhe_g

Yes, it's not real chinese food but it'll do if you're hungry and want something filling.  I thought the food was pretty tasty since we ordered the chow mein, mushroom chicken and orange peel beef.  The only bad part was that both friend and I got upset stomachs later on in the night.  Not sure what happened here since we do eat at Panda Express near us and we never had a problem before.  So I guess it was an off night for both of us. =/",sb96wZI0rH2Dbtfa_QRGfQ,0,0,3,OQol8L0fgQ3djO4Aoe_qxQ

One of the best as far as that goes. They always have fresh selections, hot, and taste very good. Can't really ask for much more.",GqPpA9-IyiPNIVxXHbDS-g,1,0,5,IySd4WUT-LLMKTI0TcCTdQ
