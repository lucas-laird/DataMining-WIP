The only seasoning they used was black pepper so, yeah it was spicy, and the crawfish was the size of my fingernail. They only used two kinds of seasonings on their food, black pepper and Cajun seasoning. Creole/Cajun food is about flavor not spice.

I did see the reviews before coming here but I figured why not give this place a chance. I got the shrimp, chicken, and sausage gumbo. At first it tasted really salty, my fourth bite into the dish became overwhelming. It began to taste very bitter. Maybe they overlooked the roux and that's how the whole dish became bitter. I noticed that there were no okra, and that's a big ingredient when it comes to gumbo. But hey, everyone has their own style so I wasn't to judgmental on that. What I did find disturbing was that the holy trinity was not in the dish at all. The holy trinity which consist of onions, bell peppers, and celery. There were onions in the dish but not the other ingredients. That's a big thing in Cajun cooking, how can you not have the key ingredients that makes up some of the flavored of gumbo.

So I went ahead and tried both their regular gumbo and the voodoo chicken which is supposed to be the spiciest and from a scale of 1-10 I would rate it a 6 in heat. But I am in to spicy, no shrimp was included in the regular order but you can ad it for 2.99 or so totally worth it. You must try their voodoo poppers stuffed with cream cheese, bacon and corn!! Mouth watering delicious! Also your gumbo will include a drink and a side of either French or hot water corn bread, I am telling you skip the French bread. If you've never had hot water corn bread you're in for a nice treat. As far service they have some young kids upfront sometimes who are trying hard, so be patient it's worth it.

The red hot chicken is labelled as their hottest dish, and it's an enjoyable buffalo-sauce based building heat that makes me think of wings without the mess. The crawfish etoufee, which I expected to be one of their stronger dishes, was pretty dismal, with minimal heat and a rather bland roux, and large finger-sized pieces of celery. Both dishes were large for the price (under $10/pp), and all dishes seem to be served over rice- a disproportionate amount of it.

Service was okay- it's a walk-up style spot. Dining room is clean with Vegas and New Orleans-themed art on the walls. Tables have a variety of hot sauces available, along with a store-brand bottled version. 

For those outraged about the lack of dishes like alligator, crawfish, etc on the menu, their website offers an explanation that references their commitment to quality and inability to guarantee fresh-sourced specialty products.

2029933,2017-08-26,0,G64LZzcDOBzR55jn2yRKYw,"Delicious. And has a drive-thru. Just sayin. 

What brought me here was finding food that my mother-in-law could eat. She had surgery on her gums and was indefinitely subscribed a soft foods diet. My husband and I were eager to find her something delicious that wasn't mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, or a smoothie. Magically, we both agreed that jambalaya or gumbo would be a great choice,  but we didn't think there was anything nearby, quick, or convenient. 

Enter J Gumbo's. A quick Google search of ""gumbo las vegas"" and off we were. We were excited to find that the location had a drive-thru since we planned to order the food to-go and bring it to my in-laws'. 

The initial impression was that the food had to be good. The dining area was packed; something visible from the outside. 

The snag we encountered was in the drive-thru experience. It moved slowly that day. In fact, there was probably at 30-minute wait between when were handed out first bag of food and when we were handed the rest of it. Here's the thing: when the rest of the food came out, the person who I imagine was a manager or the owner, popped out of the window, apologized profusely for the delay and insisted we take an order of fried okra with her compliments. But that wasn't all. When we arrived to my in-laws' and began unpacking the food, we found that we were also given a fresh batch of the food that was first handed to us. I appreciated the acknowledgement from the team of the issue, but appreciated even more the effort to which they went to make things right.

It was really thin and I had 4 pieces of sausage in it, a lot of rice, and not much else. The white bean chili was okay, nothing to write home about but much better than the gumbo. And the beignets might have been okay but I gave them to my daughter. I was too put off by the fact that there was more powdered sugar than dough, and it was everywhere in the bag.

It all started out one hangry afternoon.  Upon online recommendation,  we drove a half an hour to get here. We had high hopes. 

Turns out.....this is just not the place for a sober,  hungry,  hopeful person. This is better for an ""I've hit rock bottom"" sort of a day/life.

My first eyebrow was raised at the sight of the the drive thru, BUT we don't judge a book by its cover. Maybe this was like a mediocre looking woman with a miraculously beautiful interior, right? 

The second eyebrow was raised when the only other customer returned his bowl and asked if they could microwave it. BUT maybe the man just likes a good burn, right? 

Now, I personally only have two eyebrows....but if I had more,  they would have risen up.  

The voodoo chicken was perhaps legitimately under a spell. The seasoning had a flavor best articulated with the word ""spoiled. ""  

The bread was not fresh. The gumbo was not hot.  All of the food was extremely salty.

My chips were smothered in delicious drunken chicken , sour cream and jalapeños. My mind felt like this is something back home, insanely smothered nachos. They were good but they should thing about making their own chips and then it would be off the wall. The chips were the standard round corn chips you get at sports events. 

I also got the bumblebee stew. It was soooo good. So sweet and yummy. I was surprised there was no protein in it but that could be what makes it appealing as well. Over all I give that dish 5 stars. Maybe watch out for the onions as they can be big and chunky. The stewed tomatoes are bomb.com 

Drunken chicken was excellent. Spicy but not too spicy where you want to stop eating. I like the little green onions. A lot. Keep doing that. Adding sweet corn to it just a little would be yummy too. 

Got the red beans and rice and the beans were so good. Tasted like grandmas beans. I don't even care if they're fresh they're just good. The sausage was good. This dish would be my least favorite of the 4 things I ordered. Not even saying its bad though just more on the mild calmer side of the spectrum.

I was excited when I found out there was a location opening right down the street from me and almost in tears when I saw that they weren't getting much foot traffic. Now, the location is under new management and doing much better than before.

I introduced her to soul food(Ribs, greens, cornbread) and this last weekend it was Creole food.  She had the gumbo while I ate a P'boy sausage sandwich.  The sandwich was stuffed with plenty of sausage and the bread was excellent.  There was also a side of Cajun mustard which was very good. The gumbo was surprisingly tasty.  I really didn't expect this quality of Cajun food from this tiny hole in the wall.  The people were also very friendly and make you feel like family.  There was a nice hello upon entering and a goodbye when I left. Overall, another great find in Las Vegas!",iX-t7TyTWOBMKr7hYwXdew,1,0,4,HvYNmNSWakOpCfE9Ih6MnQ

First, I love that they let you sample any of the gumbos.

Next, I love that the menu is designed by least to most spicy.

I ordered the Voodoo Chicken, served over white rice with a slice of garlic bread. 

The chicken was super tasty, full of flavor and perfect heat.  I would order it again.

The garlic bread as some have stated was a bit crumbly, but it was still good.

Overall, it's a great quick fix for gumbo.",qmYullp32aXFUr8WMVFrOA,1,0,4,DKltCWAeMxyDyyxrTApKmA

So, we ordered 2 gumbos and a child portion of red beans and rice. 

I am sorry to say that the best part of this meal was the Community Sweet Iced Tea. That is a Louisiana Staple. My husband had poured himself a coke and took a sip of my tea and decided to dump out the coke and get tea. 

Anyway, when our food came my husband took 1 bite and looked at me and said ""You are not going to like it, it's bitter"" He was right, I didn't like it. It tasted nothing like the gumbo from central Louisiana where I lived for 22 years. I did however take several bites to try and figure out what the bitter taste was and I couldn't put my finger on it. 

The red beans and rice also did not taste right. My 16 old just spit it out. For a baby that's no big deal but when I tasted it I wanted to do the same. 

After not being able to stand anymore we just left. We didn't even try the beignets. 

I gave the extra star because of the service and the iced tea.",rRuFzqkOHv3daWl_Fh126A,3,0,2,FBxLOeBVbdd0EjNeOCLmUw
4919904,2018-06-05,0,G64LZzcDOBzR55jn2yRKYw,"I've been here twice.  Today I decided to order ""kid size"" portions of multiple favorites so that I could sample a variety.  The shrimp Po-boy was really tasty.  I got everything that typically comes on it except mustard.  It is what I consider pricey, until I tasted it.  Then I was okay with the cost.  It looked at tasted rather authentic to what I'm used to; although I was hoping for the shrimp to be fried in different kind of cornmeal coating.  Still, it was very good.  For the cost of the po-boy, I wish it came with a small side of 'something' (ex. okra, hushpuppies, fries).  I also ordered:  gumbo, crawfish etouffee, red beans & rice, and jambalaya.  My favorite was the crawfish etouffee; seasoned nicely with a nice portion of crawfish.  The other items were good, but right on the verge of being too spicy for my taste.  I learned today that the ""kid size"" portion is basically the ""kids meal"", and is actually of significantly good size.  Considering how much I ordered, I will have some tasty meals for the next couple of days!  The fountain includes Barq's root beer.  The service was friendly.  My order took a while, but it was worth the wait in the seating area (plus the beverage fountain choices helped cool me down in the Vegas heat).  Next visit I plan on ordering the street corn, fried okra, along with other choices.  I noticed a catering postcard at the counter.  It listed the items available, many already available at this restaurant.  I noticed the catering choices included dirty rice!  I wish it was offered at the restaurant as a side dish (I asked, no go as of this review).  The gumbo here is not my local favorite, but the crawfish etouffee is number one on my list of choices thus far at this establishment.  I would like to see more items offered on the menu such as:  catfish meals (only as a po-boy currently), hushpuppies and dirty rice.",Cfwvos6oFlDquGiI2Qy1gQ,1,0,4,87LxwjWRxm5Es9APqtTkyg

Convenience: Drive through although it did take a while.

Edited three months later:
I think the place is under new management. Waited at the drive through to no answer. Walked in to order. 
The tea hadn't been changed since the morning (after inquiring) way past the time control safety. After notifying the staff it had to be explained that that's a health violation. Once we arrived home, the food tastes similar but there is a lot less protein and veggies making the size a lot less remarkable. The food tastes good still but not anything noteworthy any longer.
