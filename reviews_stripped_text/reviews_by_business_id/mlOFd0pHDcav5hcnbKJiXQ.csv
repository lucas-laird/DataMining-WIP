87527,2017-07-18,0,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,"Ordered delivery. Took a bit longer than it stated on the app but that's okay. Got the beef and onion bento box. Loved it. I always crave yoshinoya and there isn't one around. This place is delicious and tastes fresher. Miso soup has no seaweed or tofu or  green onion but it was very flavorful and not too salty.I wish the bacon around the quail egg was crispier but overall I enjoyed my meal and will be ordering from here again. Also,I think the prices are very reasonable. Definitely give this place a try! 


Update: 

Second time ordering from this place. This time I got the pork bento, beef and onion rice and noodle bowl and two miso soups. Food arrived faster than estimated which was a plus. And I was also happy to see that they've included utensils (very cutely packaged might I add) but I immediately notice that my miso soups are missing. I called the store in a panic and the lady on the phone explained to me that they ran out for the day and my card had been refunded. I am very disappointed since I was really looking forward to the soup... But just from a customer service standpoint, it would've been nice to have been alerted before my order arrived. In fact if they would have called and let me know I would've ordered something else in place of it. Other than that the beef and onion bowl was good per usual but the pork in the bento was a bit dry and in need of a sauce.",V-Y2bJWLjKlxr_gn-YIkUQ,0,0,4,R9ek3Q5qbZH1cDESLGORGg

Food- 8/10 - I got a chirashi bowl, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It isn't anything mind blowing but I usually tend to enjoy simpler flavors. The fish was decently fresh, but the eel really stood out. The eel was grilled perfectly and wasn't to overpowering with the sauce. 

Service- 6/10 - The service is really friendly but it's also extremely slow. It took them 20 minutes to prepare my bowl, so if you're in a rush, this place may not be for you. 

Portion- 7/10 - The portions here are good, though a little inconsistent. Some of the fish I got was sliced thinner than others, but I didn't mind.",F5DnSfh5Hhp1NrjEfZnRiA,1,1,4,xvEQdb89CY6ucHrGWVWw9Q

FOOD: Their bento boxes are so worth it! I got the Eel Bento and it came with so much food. It included rice, 10 pieces of eel, salad, and a bunch of side dishes. They have a lot of other options such as noodle bowls, rice bowl, rice balls, rolls, salads, and soups. The squid salad is delicious. The miso soup sadly had no tofu or seaweed it in.

DRINK: They have this complicated filtered water machine that took me some time to figure out how to use. They give really tiny water cups so you constantly have to get up and refill your cup. They have an instant latte that you can purchase and use their hot water machine to make the latte. Surprisingly, they have a variety of smoothies that you can choose from. Everything is great to take-out orders.

1409484,2017-08-31,0,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,"Stopped here to pick up some lunch after having class on a Wednesday afternoon. It is located in the plaza where perfect scoop used to be in a corner spot facing south. Parking is decent as this plaza isn't that busy overall. 

As with most, this is a korean owned japanese establishment offering bowls and bentos, as well as rice balls, and some other smaller things. 

Originally i wanted to get a rice bowl but was told id get more food when getting a bento. For a dollar difference, ($11 for fish bowl vs $12 for bento), i opted to listen and get the bento. I had been craving some eel for a while so thats what i got. 

Eel sounded like it was oven baked/heated as i heard a ding a minute or two before getting my food. 

You get about 12 slices of eel on top of a bed of rice with a side of lettuce/kale/tomato salad, pickled daikon and celery, slices of sweet egg and inari (the tofu pouch thing), mini sausage, and quail egg wrapped with bacon. The sides overall was decent. Only complaint would be the kale. They left the thick mid stem which is kind of hard to eat. I would have preferred the mid stem removed and the kale leaves to be cut into thinner strips. 

The eel was pretty decent. Very soft in texture. Not overly sweet. Maybe i was hungry. It was pretty good overall. Not bad for $12. Still looking for a place that would serve a rice bowl with a huge slab of unagi on top .. mmm XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,4,il0m5SVLubABil2Y7c9_GQ

1663965,2017-07-25,2,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,"I finally tried Kuben, as it has always caught my eye while visiting Recess Italian Desserts a few stores down. 

Very different presentation of the bento box from what I'm used to (being from Hawaii). But that doesn't mean that what it contains inside isn't good. I went for the beef bento box. Very flavorful. In the bento box, contained a bowl of salad, side garnishes/ veggies, sausage, quail eggs wrapped in bacon, and of course, teri beef with onions on a bed of white rice. All for $11.  Aside from the bento box, I also tried the salmon bowl. The salmon was soft and so fresh! You can get 3 free toppings on your bowl such as furikake, green onions, scrambled eggs , imitation crab, and edamame just to name a few. Each additional topping is a dollar.
The least thing I like was the chicken bowl. The chicken was kind of bland for my liking, but I am pretty sure that's right up the alleys of the healthy enthusiasts. The best part of the chicken bowl was the bottom layer where it contained noddles (comparable to Korean jap chae) and rice. 

Inside is small but, a very good and clean place to enjoy your food. Overall, a good experience. Will be back to try the unagi (eel) bento and the different variety of what they call rice balls, which I call their verision of musubis.",XULyn-0VorP6E0Nlh1ot6Q,2,2,4,cXF26Ag1DtRGrr1rjOGkhA

1772179,2018-02-24,5,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,"Kuben has been on my radar for a very long time, but I never found the time to go until today! Unfortunately, between finding the place and actually going, it looks like there's new management. And with new management comes a change in menu and product. This also means that most of the glowing reviews for Kuben are now null. Sadly, I didn't realize any of this until afterwards. So reader be warned, there is no beef bowl. The new salmon bowl is cooked. Check the dates of previous yelp reviews to make sure they're referring to the ""new"" Kuben.

I ordered the eel bowl. It was 10 dollars. There were 6 thin slices of eel, like wafer thin slices. Unlike the previous menu, you could not choose any toppings. The new menu says it's served over rice or mixed greens; I was never asked to choose and ended up getting a mix of both. There was a small smattering of sesame seeds and maybe a hint of furikake. The eel was tasty. The greens were too bitter for me. Without the personalized toppings, I felt like the bowl was pretty to look at but not very tasty. I wish they utilized the counter space a little more instead of disappearing into the kitchen to prep my food. 

Service was friendly but not very helpful in recommendations. I was the only patron when I entered, and it took 15 minutes for them to prep my bowl. I really wanted this place to be amazing, so I'll probably revisit Kuben in a few months hoping that they'll have improved. In the meantime...I'm really not wowed by this place at all.",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,12,4,2,xrbutmreplhGTtzY1hBOkg
1821399,2017-07-17,0,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,"I was so excited when I saw this place was coming in. Japanese Bento! Yes, there are plenty of sushi places that offer Bento options, but those are dine in and not typical for take out. This is ther perfect example of Japanese Bento Take Out. 

As a white girl who loves the Japanese culture and food, they were surprised when I walked in the door and spoke to them in Japnese- mind you I'm not fluent but they were susrpised non the less and had to do a dpuble take. Lol

A HUGR plus is they have Onigiri- Japanese Rice Balls- the kind we see characters in Anime eating all the time. So of course I had to try it (sorry not pictured) and it was AMAZING! Can I get that for breakfast!? I'm going to stop by tomorrow and try. :)

I ordered the Chickn Ben to and its tasty. Also comes in a very cute box as I have also added to Yelp photos. The sides a tasty, especially the tamago- Sweet Japanese Egg. I'm even liking the pickled veggies which I wasnr sure of at first. 

I am looking forward to seeing this place expand. I'm hoping they add many more dishes to their menu over time. I would like to see items not really found in other Japanese American restraunts. The more authentic the better! Ocha. Daifukumochii. Maybe a traditional japanese breakfast for a Bento box!? 

Looking forward to eating more of your food!

1871155,2018-05-10,0,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,I have read some of the reviews. I'm surprised. I walked in and was like oh you only have sushi which I love but can't eat anymore for food allergies. The gentleman from South Korea was very polite and explained the menu. Some people say they weren't helpful. He was very helpful that's how we learned the gentleman was from South Korea. We got a bento bowl and the bento box. I saw that someone said the rice was too sticky and maybe they came at the wrong time of the day or just that batch was bad but ours was delicious. I was worried the chicken wasn't going to be too good and expected dark meat but nope it was really good and very flavorful. We really enjoyed our food and definitely plan to go back. I would suggest those with not so great reviews maybe give them a second chance. Ask to see if they can taste the rice before they get a second order or ask if they have rice less sticky. Ask why they cook the salmon and if they can get it uncooked maybe it's a regulation with the city. Either way we enjoyed it. I'm known usually for only writing reviews on places I enjoy. Those places that are okay won't get me to write. Those places that are just plan awful I really won't waste my time unless it's worth warning someone.

But i actually ate here and it was really cool. So for ambiance I give them a 5/5... The place was tiny but very very clean and very cute!

The owner of the place was very nice. He actually gave my friend and I free miso soup which I thought was a great touch! And it was perfectly seasoned. I've had some miso soup where it was too salty or too bland but this one had just the right amount saltines with great miso flavor.  5/5 but just a heads up it did not have the seaweed or the tofu but hey it was free! :) and just a side note... While we were getting ready to go.. It started to pour outside and the chef and his assistant ran outside and played the rain! Puhahahaha it was hilarious! But when they came back in... They were like did you see the rain????  And they gave free drinks to the people that had just gotten their food... Reasoning... It was raining and that must make your thirstier so get a free drink! I didn't quite get the logic but it was very very sweet!

Don't forget to check in as you get a free soda! Yay!! Or you can get ice cold water from a cute little water cooler they have next to the coca cola fridge holding their canned drinks. They do not have a soda fountain...FYI. sucks but hey we can all get free refills on water. Lol 4/5 

I got the bento box with beef and onions... And I gotta tell ya.. It came with a tons of stuff!!! The pickled veg was sour with a hint of sweetness and it balanced out the food really nicely. Then you had some deep fried tofu skins and sweet egg pieces... Then a kurabota sausage with the steamed veggies and bacon wrapped quail eggs...I gotta tell y'all... Pretty much everything in that bento box was on point. The beef and onions tasted like a really good bulgogi... The meat looked a little sketchy at first since it looked like it had alot of fat... But nope the meat was tender and very flavorful. I just mixed all the meat and onions with the rice and dug in. It was delicious.  5/5

I had never ordered a chirashi bowl anywhere before and its basically sashimi over rice. It came with 4 types of fish over warm rice. It was very plain and bland.

The BF and I opted for the chicken bowl. From there you can pick your toppings. We also got one mini roll and a rice ball.

Their bento boxes comes with a variety of items that keeps your palate from getting bored and is organized in a very Snap/Instagram worthy way that is aesthetically pleasing to look at. Almost so that you don't want to eat it... almost.

Their unagi eel bento is very fresh and comes with about 10 pieces over a bed of rice. Each eel piece is surprisingly flavorful and soft, which it makes it very easy to chew and digest. Their salad is also good and comes with dressing separately which is an excellent decision and gives you the choice to decide how much dressing you want or save for later in case you don't want to start eating a soggy salad.

They also did a similar thing with their rice balls, so if you want to buy one and save it for lunch or a mid day snack, you don't have to worry about the seaweed getting soggy and nasty.

They are also updating their opening times starting on September 1st for those of us who aren't early birds. For it's conveniently located spot near where I live, I'm definitely sure that I'm going to come back and try more of their items soon.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,3,1,5,51TjS2_IiGhbkn1Em3mJkw

2557195,2017-06-20,18,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,"My colleagues and I researched a new place to try for lunch today and we chose Kuben. A small bento box restaurant where everything is home made.

Because we did our research before arriving, we all knew what to order. Two of us ordered the salmon bento box and one the chicken bento. We found a great check-in offer for a free drink. The drink case had many varieties of San Pellegrino canned drinks as well as soda, water and apple juice. We sat along the wall and listened to the KPOP playing in the restaurant (no BTS, but still nice music).

Our food came up within about 5 minutes and I went to the counter to pick it up and I told the Korean girl ""Kamsahamnida"" thank you in Korean. A gentlemen behind the counter came out and asked what I said and told her to give us all a free miso soup :-). Who knew being polite and knowing a few words in another language would get us all something! That was very nice of Kuben. 

We looked over the food and snapped a few pics (try not to drool as these pics are quite mouth watering). There was a very large assortment in the bento box. The cooked salmon steaks were served atop rice and topped with sesame seeds, a sausage with peppers, cauliflower and brussel sprouts, bacon wrapped mozzarella, some pickled veggies and egg with cooked tofu. Lastly there was a salad with a nice dressing. A filling meal that tasted delicious from the first bite to the last.

Lastly, whilst we were eating a young kid came in the store selling chocolate bars to raise money for basketball and the employees purchased the whole box. He then proceeded to give a bar to all of the customers! Very nice people at Kuben a truly over the top experience!

The food is not bad it's just that we would not wait for that long again for average food. I thought it was a great concept and addition to the neighborhood spots to go to. But they're just really really slow and I wouldn't come back with more than two people. 

Don't let my review discourage you from eating here, the food isn't bad it's just that I had maybe too many people for the two staff to manage at that time. It's definitely worth coming to even just to try.",Zqk-ye_OHeH_sS1JsdsLgg,2,1,3,am8w77GRa766Fu4hlFzX9Q

The customer service is top notch, that is for certain. The food in the bento was edible but I couldn't say much beyond that. We had salmon bento and eel bentos. 
The rice was far too sticky and saturated and made for a really unappealing texture. Japanese rice isn't typically served this way. 
The eel had a decent flavor but again the texture was a bit off. The salmon also looked like it was potentially made ahead or previously frozen; I don't know if this is true, but this is the impression I got from look and texture of the ingredients. 
The Gyoza was not cooked fully, the outer edges were dry and completely raw, but of all three bento boxes, the gyoza was served this way, so I think this is just their method. Gyoza should be cooked fully and crispy on the widest end. 
The CA roll included tasted like what you'd get at the grocery store. 
I hate to have such a bad review for this place because it's clear this is a small business and they're trying very hard but the food is what needs to speak for a restaurant first and foremost and the food is just not that great.

The beef and onion bento was good, for the most part. The beef and onion (gyudon) had the thin cut meat and was the perfect amount of mirin/soy/sugar flavor. 
The salad is small, but a nice addition. The rest of the sides were decent, but nothing special. Edible, but nothing I want to go back to eat.

NOPE! Didn't happen, and she took the entire phone order while my kids and I just stood there looking F$c%3n p-off. Bad customer etiquette, but then when she took our order super friendly that is total BS!

I get it. it is a small shop just starting out, but they need to prioritize with the customers that is right in front of them, especially if we were there before the phone rings. Hopefully they'll get their act together and if she was the owner then I hope she reads this as this town is all about service and great food.  

Inside is small with 9 bar seats along the wall. Decor is ok nothing special.  I cannot recommend this for big family to dine in, but to go order - yes.

I had the Chirashi bowl which had 4 different kinds of fish, ginger, and rice. One of the types of fish that it comes with is the eel, which was so tender and well seasoned  that I'm looking forward to getting an eel bowl specifically in the future. I also took a pork bowl home and had it the next day for lunch and the pork was also cooked perfectly. I'd order both of these again. Just a quick note that the fish bowls do not come with added toppings. The menu lists ""bowl toppings"" but doesn't specify that it's just for the rice & noodle bowls. 

The reason why I can't give this place 5 stars is because of the seating. There's only about 8-10 seats in the restaurant, so if you're planning to eat in, that might not happen. They definitely have enough room to comfortably add a couple of 2 person tables inside, but currently just have wasted space. 

I really enjoyed the food here, and I can't wait to go back, but I can't comfortably stop here before heading somewhere else because of the fact that eating in is hit or miss. 

Update: I'm upping my review to 5 stars as they've added more seating to the restaurant. Theres is now a four person table in the back and a two person table in the front. It adds six more seats and makes it easier to find a spot to sit and eat in. They've also recently changed their hours and now open later but also stay open later as well.

I have one pro/con here.  The presentation/packing was really nice, however because of that, we pay for that nice packaging which adds to the cost of the meal.  I would rather see the packaging be a little more basic and bring the cost down.  

All in all, I will absolutely be back and I will definitely recommend this place to others.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,0,0,5,pyHfZ9DBu9NGzZZnvvblFw

Had a salmon bento box and it was outstanding. Salmon was seasoned perfectly. Food was so good I stayed a little longer and ordered a mini California roll too!

Friendly staff and you get a free soda w/Yelp check in.

Pricing could be better, since they are made fresh -wait times are longer. 

I had the spicy tuna mayo but my friend customized an Onigiri w/beef and spicy sauce which was sweet and delectable.",ACuDmNyIwm3WfXbJWJ_c1A,0,0,5,H58Q_iIX-2PMVUnL272waQ
5319960,2018-07-02,1,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,"I remember seeing this place before they opened for business and I thought this was going to be a Cuban restaurant with a twist or something. But surprise, surprise! They serve Japanese bento boxes, sushi rolls, Sashimi, doughnut sushi, sushi burrito, salads, and such.

Salmon Skin Salad: 5/5

Salmon Carpaccio: 5/5

Salmon Sashimi Bowl: 5/5

Donut Sushi: 5/5
I wasn't sure how I would attack a doughnut sushi. Do I eat it with chopsticks? Should I pick it up with my bare hands? So, I started with chopsticks and when I had a small portion left, I wrapped it in seaweed and picked it up with my hands. You can choose what you want on your doughnut sushi (fish, sauce). I got tuna and salmon with ponzu.

Cowboy Roll: 5/5
When you want beef and fish at the same time, like surf and Turf, this is the roll for you. Or if you have friends who doesn't like the concept of raw fish, this is it for them. Crab, cucumber, beef with ponzu and eel sauce. I got it without gobo.

I've been here a couple of times now and everything has been consistent: great service and good quality food(especially fresh fish). They even remembered me from the pictures I posted on here.

I appreciate that you can get good food for a reasonable price. Their space is small so I'd imagine they get packed during busy lunch hours. I've only been here at night after going to the gym and right before they close. You can always get your food to-go. I'm excited that they cater - I'm definitely having one of my meetings catered by Kuben!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,2,5,5,lrbiyVaZNOBq_Yj4jfFi3w

5515106,2018-01-03,0,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,"This food reminds me of bentos and meals I had in Japan. Simple food with the right flavors. I've been a couple times and have tried a few things: eel bento, pork bento, pork bowl, beef and onion bowl. My favorites are the eel bento and the beef and onion bowl.  The bento has a lot of little treats, sausage, picked veg, seaweed, bacon wrapped egg (quail?), salad. I usually can't it is all at once. The meals are well priced, but the additions for the bowls are kinda pricy for what you get. The other annoying thing is that they never seem to have the egg.

The beef and onion bowl reminds me of the beef bowl at Yoshinoya.. but better!! The rice here is dusted with a generous amount of furikaki. Soooo good. My complaint is that it's pretty pricey for what it is. But I haven't found anything like it since Yoshinoya left Las Vegas. So.... Compromise...

We ordered a yellow tail ""donut"". I couldn't eat it bc I'm preggers. But my husband says he enjoyed it. He did comment, however, that it was hard to eat the seaweed with it, since the donut sat on the seaweed and the seaweed wasn't cut with the donut. 

We also ordered a salmon burrito. This was a pleasure to surprise since it wasn't a giant burrito but rather 2 smaller burritos. Makes it much easier to eat!! It was also really tasty. Next time, I'm going to ask if they can make it with seaweed wrapping instead of soy paper. 

Salmon skin roll was just okay. I think I was disappointed that the rice wasn't vinegared. So it really lacked flavor. Probably won't be ordering this one again.

5636438,2017-07-14,0,mlOFd0pHDcav5hcnbKJiXQ,"Full disclosure: I have not visited this restaurant; this review is for the food I had delivered. I'm pretty sure this establishment uses a third party delivery service; keep that in mind when you read any comments about the delivery itself, please!

I really don't know if I should even be writing this. It's my first order from Kuben, so I haven't really sampled much of their menu. But it's a good review! So no harm done, right?

Wow! I ordered the unagi bento, miso soup, and a salmon rice ball. I initially subtracted two stars; the miso soup was bland, with no wakame or tofu. The salmon balls were inexplicably spicy! Of course the Korean printing on the label should have given me a clue. 

The bento box, however was beautifully prepared and presented. I would have preferred some steamed sesame spinach instead of the included packaged salad, and the sausage was a bit off-putting in both appearance and taste, but there was fully SIX SUSHI ORDERS' WORTH OF UNAGI! If you ordered 6 orders of unagi sushi from a sushi menu at a price of $6.50 per order (2 pieces per order) ... well, you do the math! This bento was a bit more than twelve bucks, plus taxes, delivery and tip. Great bargain! The eel wasn't prime grade, but it wasn't cat food either. And really, the salmon rice balls, although unexpectedly spicy and probably not made in-house, were actually ample in size and very tasty!

So, minus just one star for the really dismal miso soup. 

A word about the delivery service, which I suspect, as I said, is a third party. It was about an hour later than guaranteed. Yelp helped out with that though, and very promptly, too. It's just a bit hard getting to the customer service section on the YelpEat24 app.

Good place for lunch! I'm looking forward to trying the other items on the menu.",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,0,0,4,hfXWLZ9dgePu3xg066zYDQ

I ordered the eel bento and loved it. Portion was great (plenty of eel) and their pickled radish, boiled quail eggs with bacon around it, and sausage was really good too. My husband ordered the beef and onion bento. He enjoyed all the side dishes, too. BUT unlike the eel bento, you get very little meat with the rice. My husband wasnt even done with half the rice by the time he finished the meat. Their mini rolls are also good and i enjoyed the dressing that came with the salad. Packaging is really well done.
