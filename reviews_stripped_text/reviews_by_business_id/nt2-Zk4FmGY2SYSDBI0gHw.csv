They have decent food but depending on what you order, some of the prices are kind of high for a small family owned restaurant. I'd stay away from the burritos or combos for that reason and only order from the tacos and breakfast sections of the menu. 

Their al pastor tacos were pretty good but their super nachos were far from being super. It was mostly chips and not very many toppings. We took it home it threw our own toppings and salsa on it! 

Although they're food is decent, they do have some major issues that I noticed the first few times I stopped by:

1. This is basically a take out only joint because they only have 1 table inside

2. 50 cent fee to use a card no matter how much you order 

3. Received advertisement/coupons in the mail stating that breakfast was served from 5 am to 10 pm, however, when I stopped by one morning at 7:45 am they were closed. Apparently they don't open until 9 am every day!

4. Only open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday despite having a 24 hour sign

Overall based on the convenience factor of this location, and its proximity to several residential areas, I think they're going to give Roberto's a run for their money.

Not entirely sure on the negative reviews and all as  it seems better selections that what you get at a taco truck but better prices than some of the really expensive places in town(E.G. Dona Maria).  The cashier really seemed to know what she was doing in helping explaining any questions I had and checking to make sure that everything was in the bag.

I will say that the flour tortillas for the tacos are really thin and pretty much disintegrated after the first bite so I had to use a fork to get everything else so that is a downer.  But I will say that the food seems as fresh as you will get anywhere else.",cy4CP4shM8hCXnU7BOwxSg,0,0,3,T3RNcwAD8Dd4kZWGh3knqw

Wow! It was really good! After seeing the bad reviews & ratings, I really expected to not like it. We will definitely be back! They have some great specials we will totally return for.

After 45 minutes I went in and asked to speak to a manager. I was told there isn't one on staff and so then I asked for my money back and was told that our food was being made that they can not refund my money.

I bought a Durango burrito with what was suppose to be carne asada but what I got was a burrito with shredded almost paste like beef. Beside the absolute god awful texture of the meat, it was obviously not grilled and tasted disgusting. I couldn't believe that the owner/ Managers let their employees sell that to people. It's sad how little effort they put into the cuisine. Hopefully, the powers that be see this review and start taking pride in what they do instead of putting dog food on a plate and calling it mexican food. Save your time and money, go to Roberto's which is right down the street and get some food that at least resembles Mexican food.

As an update, I call and ask if I could just bring the food back and get a refund. The woman that answered the phone said that the manager would not be back until Wednesday and he was the only one that could give a refund. This place is a complete waste of time and money. Avoid it like the plague. I will be contacting the manager on Wednesday and letting him know what a total crap hole this place is.

Update to the Update:
i got in touch with the manager and was told that they do not do refunds on the food. He offered to remake it or give store credit. I strongly declined as there was nearly nothing of a $50.00 that was even half decent. This place is a ripoff.",frQi2KwWlshr7OXouAqoiQ,4,0,1,dX4t6FFmkLLo3QVOwhFBpg

My wife wanted a, pepper burrito with cheese and quac. They tried to charge me, i kid you not, 11 bucks for a burrito with no meat and only pepper cheese and guac. So, the bill, with what i ordered came to 22 bucks. I said ok, cause wanted to try it instead of robertos, which my go to for a Californian. Even though it was for 2 burritos. I said to my self a bit pricey, but what the hell. I give them my debit card and they said its a 50 cent charge. I genuinely was shocked and said to the lady behind the register, ""what is the minimum?"" She said there is no minimun its a 50 cent charge for cards. That was the last straw and went to roberto's instead. I know what ur thinking, why would i not pay the 50 cent? Because i was about to pay 22 bucks for 2 burritos and one of those burritos had no meat. I was not going to pay an ectra dime for take out. I go to roberto's and get food for 4 people for 22 bucks.
