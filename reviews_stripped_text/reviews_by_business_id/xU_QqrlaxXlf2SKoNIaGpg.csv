We ordered two gyros and the chicken souvlaki to go. The souvlaki was delicious, as were the fries on the side. My dad, a born-and-raised Greek, said the gyro was fantastic. The owners were so kind and welcoming, really wonderful people. To top it all off, we got a pretty hefty amount of food for a great price.  Highly recommended!",febUHTZsQZQ3WqYLQOxTUQ,0,0,5,1a9_FztvlRD5_9bF0IGBiw

It is very seldom that I ""single out"" a certain THING that would make me come back to a place - however after meeting BRENDA (our Server/Waitress/New Friend), My and the family will DEFINITELY be returning customers here...!

She made us all feel like we were at home with the family - and that is something that is not easily found these days....  E & N, I take my HAT OFF to you and your staff!!!!!

My wife had the Chicken Slouvlki and it was excellent. (The table next to us all ordered the same thing. They were friends from a local Greek church and they recommended the Greek items!) But man I'll tell you - I dreamed of that lasagna last night. It arrived steaming hot with cheese perfectly browned. The sauce was obviously home-made... Just a bit spicy. Wow... Great stuff. For dessert we stayed with the recommendation of the other table and got baklava. Yum!  This new restaurant shows a lot of promise.

1620848,2014-09-07,1,xU_QqrlaxXlf2SKoNIaGpg,"We had driven by on Friday and checked out yelp seeing great reviews so we stopped in for dinner Saturday - there were about 6 tables occupied and we knew the people at two of them - one family have been eating here every Saturday for 3 months and the other a first time yelper.

We ordered a lot of food for us but it was all good and all was eaten.
My kids had chicken fingers and Bacon Burger w/ onion rings & sweet potato fries - all was devoured.  We started with spanikopita and it was very good - very similiar to what I had in Corfu, Ithaca, and cephalonia - Greek food lovers will be happy here.
We also had surf & turf w/baked potato and ceasar salad.  Salad and Baker we very good.  The fried shrimp were good sized and tasty with a perfect heat Cocktail sauce.  Steak was OK - not great.  Our friends both had the lasagne and said it was very good.

We had the KOK cake for dessert - light chocolate cake with chocolate whip cream enrobed in chocolate - not a death by chocolate - just a coma -+ good stuff (we got the last one by calling dibbs partway through our meal).

Best of all however was the staff and owners.  All very caring and attentive - these are obvious life long restaurantaurs who moved to Vegas to be near family and do what they love.  Great casual feel - good family prices - care going into the food.

We will be back to try the Italian which is supposed to be great - we also had calamari and the red sauce tasted homemade and was good.

This place is exactly what Vegas needed - tri- state folks think classic NY Greek diner (the good one not the greasy one).",IOXZVTwpeAeFOcaxo5tphg,1,1,5,3Ulq9Ev9slVwuAc_KKKiwg

I know that the two previous restaurants failed and would hate to see a similar fate. The last visit they brought out complimentary spanakopita which they hopefully will be adding to the menu. I have never had before but it was delicious. Have had the Scampi which was very good and both visits my guests and I have cleaned our plates. They are open for breakfast so I am hoping to be there again soon for that. I urge people to stop by and they will not be disappointed!!,_WYaKcttTZozFqv8NXGO3w,0,0,5,vPayWHqNyR54gk-XG4lcXA

2821881,2014-09-30,0,xU_QqrlaxXlf2SKoNIaGpg,"From a Professional Blogger, on Date Day 9/30/2014 for myself and my wife, we decided to try this wonderful eatery. From Breakfast, to greek, to seafood, to italian, its a wonderful delightful place to eat. We ordered the Fried Mushrooms probably the most delightful we have ever had in the U.S.A, This restaurant was definitely middle of the road diner food, offering breakfast all day, and great wait staff indeed. The Food we then ordered was Meatball Hoagie and Fries, and then the homemade specialty Lasagna which was all great, and wonderful. Very good prices, and family atmosphere, serving incredible Ice Tea unsweet just like I love and Pepsi Products. 

We took a recommendation on dessert but you may want to take your luck to the new pastry and fresh bread shop next door, or 2 locations down the street Pink Box an incredible donut shop. Unless you are hung up on Greek Desserts, it was not for me, as I love cheesecake but mixing it with a whole lot of Greek just did not work. 

The restaurant is clean, the restrooms incredibly clean, and yes, the facility incredible with an old school coffee shop bar by the register. 

You just gotta try it , and hope it was as great as we went, we will definitely take the boys next time.

My daughter went in and we ordered two gyro sandwiches to go. She said they were Greek ( like us) and they were really funny and nice so, she waited inside while I waited in the car. It took a while but, that's okay they make everything fresh to order. 

The sandwich was nice and hot. You can tell they care about what they serve. I asked for extra feta didn't get it, potato salad was no bueno, the fries were nice and crisp, pita was fresh  but, the gyro was good!!!",UNPmsDGDC13zTkGEKMVwdg,0,0,4,OEWyOVj1fV0KmyR-fzB0mQ

However, once inside the place was empty.  About 20 minutes in 3 more families came in. Slow night since it was already 6:35pm.

The chicken noodle soup was amazing.   My 2 year old got another bowl - it was that good. 

The fried pickles and chicken tenders was just okay since it was cut in quarters instead of sliced chips.

My wife loved the broiled chicken on rice.   I tasted it and it was very flavorfull.

Meatball sub was delicious as my daughter devoured 3/4 of a 9 inch sub topped with massive cheese.

I ordered rib eye cooked medium but it came out well done. I sent it back and 2nd time was the charm.   Rib eye was cooked perfect, however my entire family was already done.  This was the reason I took a star away. 

Karen our waitress was super friendly and did an excellent job making sure we were taken care of.

I wish they had more kebabs on the menu and maybe a little more of the typical mediterranean fare, though I know it's not their prescribed fare.  The service was pretty good too, but it was dead in there.  I think that might be a result of the location more than anything else.

The restaurant is very homey and inviting and we also felt that from the staff as well. Definitely a place to take the family when you're too lazy to cook. 

I opted for the chicken parmesan and kiddo had the cheeseburger. I really enjoyed my meal. The pasta had a spicy meat sauce and the chicken parm was still crispy and delicious! I hate when i get chicken parm that's soggy because it's been soaking in marinara :-( It was also a nice thick breast piece instead of the usual pounded out thin cutlet. He seemed to enjoy his meal and also opted to finish my pasta as well. 

We both had a piece of the baklava and oh my it was a perfect ending to our dinner. The layers were very fluffy and flaky, even better drizzled in honey and chocolate.  The few baklavas I've had in the past seemed to be more compact and on the oily side.  Besides the food, I was also impressed by the price. Pretty affordable for such good quality.
