The TNB Burger with bacon jam, yes I said jam!, was incredibly tasty. While the truffled tatter tots as a side were some of the best I have had in a while. Make sure to wash your meal down with their home brewed sweet orange mint Iced tea.  The location is quaint, being located inside an antique shopping.

But I couldn't give it five stars because the lack of tableware was a turnoff.  The sandwich, fries and salad were served on a piece of paper on top of a small baking sheet.  Eating a dressed salad off of paper is weird enough, but trying to stab into the salad pieces with a dull plastic fork was downright frustrating and unpleasant.  My iced tea was served in a cheap plastic cup as well. Given the fact that the menu is so unique, I'm surprised they want to cheapen the whole experience with plastic tableware.",Tx6kE6Yb_pUxkNhl_N7-xA,2,0,4,TOS49FXHprp-dKVnH2t6Ug

532766,2014-07-31,0,zblKqBFWq7HMACwacMpzig,"I LOVE bacon. I l LOVE truffles! Hence, I eat them a lot. You can image my excitement when I discovered this cute little cafe in Vegas (of all places). 

The food was delicious - can't go wrong with bacon and truffles. I had the buffalo chicken + bacon mac & cheese. My co-worker had the burger + truffle tater tots. Oh my goodness! Both were amazing. I've tried a lot of different variation of (fill in the blank) + bacon so I know what I'm talking about when I say this place is outstanding! If you want exceptional, inexpensive, award winning (their bacon jam!), home made options, this is a must try. Skip the fancy cafes in Vegas; Truffles n Bacon Cafe is SO much better. 

Vegas is a town living off of tourism and hospitality and this little cafe is above and beyond any 5 star hotel/restaurant. I'm not kidding. The customer service alone is worth a visit. The owner, Magnolia, was very friendly and went out of her way to make sure our first meal in Vegas was a good one (we literally had the cab drive us there after we landed). When we got there, they were closing up and Magnolia offered to re-open the cafe so we can eat. Who does that? So very kind of her. This was our first visit to Truffles n Bacon Cafe but it's going to be on my list the next time (and every time) I'm in Vegas. Save your money for gambling, bottle service and whatever else you wanna try in Vegas (wink, wink), and come eat here. Now.",bz5_-Pt3FJfbxD_7I7zZdQ,1,1,5,gjL92YzRFDU6KUsb7s5GgA

I had one of the specials, a succulent burger topped with chopped brisket, Ortega chilies and melted Havarti cheese...delicious and decadent!! It came with perfectly dressed greens and herb seasoned tater tots. My brain almost fell out on the floor!!! 
   My son had Not your Mama's grilled cheese... melted cheese with brisket and mustard greens, french fries and greens...again so delicious. We finished with a Ice cream sundae with warm fudge and yummy heath topping! Everything was fresh, top quality ingredients, made to order and oh so satisfying!!!

1254128,2015-03-05,0,zblKqBFWq7HMACwacMpzig,This review is for Truffles and Bacon...  When I walked into this place it had a funny smell but the place itself had a clean appearance. The employees seemed like they didn't know who does what.  They brought us water and forgot the straws.   I ordered a brisket and grilled cheese sandwhich with truffle fries.  Our food came quickly. The sandwhich itself was pretty good but was lacking a quality bread that I would expect from a $12 sandwhich.  The Truffle fries were horrible (I'm pretty sure they just poured truffle oil on them).  The side salad was actually pretty refreshing.   I give it 2 stars because of the smell inside and for 2 people for $30 I expect a higher quality of food.,t0019kqwdx5lsfUf86J0zA,0,0,2,1QuTmVaoIaC2BPWix0JwTA

1644237,2014-02-25,2,zblKqBFWq7HMACwacMpzig,"There's new place opened inside the Antiques at the Market called Truffles n Bacon Cafe with interesting deliciousness going on! Sandwiches, salads and soups are borderline gourmet. 

The ""Pimp My Bruchetta"" is what I ordered. You get 3 pieces of bruchetta and pick your choice of toppings. Some topping choices I'll mention: minty peas w/bacon jam, mushroom & brie, halomi cheese w/sautéed grapes and Babaganoush!! This also came with a side of salad greens that's tossed w/a vinaigrette. I was real happy with my choices I got. Especially the babaganoush which was perfectly light in texture. Mushroom paired with Brie was brilliant!  I consider these more light bites though than a meal.
 
So still hungry I'm up for round two and go for their signature grilled cheese. A panini w/chipotle mayo.  Not too bad! Grilled cheese with a little twist. I love the chipotle slaw on bed of greens it came with. It added a little zing to the the cheesy sandwich.
 
Dont miss getting their citrus iced tea! They brew their own tea and top it with a mint leaf and slice of lemon. Very refreshing! Compliments all the sandwiches.

Other menu items that caught my attention ""The Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese"" with short rib, bacon jam, cheese and  broccoli rabe, their signature burger  comes with burger, mac n cheese, bacon jam, siracha ketchup on brioche bun..with fries seasoned in truffle oil. Yum! There was also another sandwich with brisket in it.

So with all that good stuff mentioned, where's the bacon in all this? While waiting I took a second look at the menu and bacon is only present as a condiment ( TnB's bacon jam) My server did say the menu changes and they do different specials each day, so Im assuming maybe it's on their daily special or the board that was in the main dining room. Dont get me wrong, the menu is pretty good but bacon lovers looking for bacon at Truffles n Bacon might be a little disappointed.  What they can do without is the tater tots! I don't know but they reek of the frozen type variety. Mine went untouched after the first bite. Hence why this time around it's not a solid 4 stars yet.  I really enjoyed the rest of  my lunch though. 

The cafe is cute and simple. The kitchen is open and you can see their work area is pretty clean.  The main dining area has banquette seating  and the second dining area by the window is smaller  with 2 sets of tables in there.  It's the perfect setting for this antique mall. Speaking of which, where is the Antiques at the Market Mall?? Right across Sunset Park, just past Sunset Road. You'll see their marquee and some banners for it. Turn into the parking lot and go ALL THE WAY to the back. It's brick colored building with ANTIQUES in green letters.

Staff is really friendly and all orders came out in a timely manner. My table mates and I  were happy with what we ordered. Everything for the most part is reasonably priced.  I'll be sure to keep this place in mind when I'm in the area.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,12,9,3,fOOIG_uk55iXoRwbZ6E56Q

I would imagine this spot to be popular with the kind of people that would go antiquing for the day and then stop into this quaint café for an afternoon tea - and they do serve an afternoon tea!

After a long morning in the office - it was a welcome change of pace to walk into this spot for a quick meal. I got the popular here Signature Burger with tots and the free check in citrus tea. Everything was tasty - come on, how could bacon jam not be - and it all came out rather quickly. I had ordered, scarf'd down my meal and was out in less than 30 mins - without feeling as though I had.

Decided to go for the TNB Café Signature Hamburger topped with crispy mac n' cheese, TNB bacon jam, and Sriracha mayo.  If you can put together a perfect hangover food, this would be it!!  Savory and greasy to soak up all that booze.  I also like the profile of saltiness from the mac n' cheese and sweetness from their signature jam together in one bite.  The dish came with baked tater tots tossed in truffle oil, which I didn't really care for since I really don't like that synthetic/artificial flavor of truffle oil.

While we were waiting the server brought us out a little amuse-bouche of toast with hummus and a garlic spread, very nice of them!  Our food came out quickly and owner Magnolia was quick to make sure everything was okay, and to make sure we were taken care of. 

My husband's Mac n cheese was delicious, not dry, not greasy, just perfect. My grilled cheese was also delicious - the combination of melty cheese, tender brisket, and slightly bitter kale was a match made in heaven...it was the ""big O"" of grilled cheese.

The place was empty about 2:00 PM but I was greeted immediately upon entering. I had read so many good things about the TNB Signature Burger and ordered one to go with high expectations.

These expectations were met and exceeded!! The fresh burger, mac-n-cheese patty, brioche bun, and bacon jam..oh bacon jam..melded together to produce a sandwich that truly was an experience. Sided with truffle oil tater tots, this combo really hit a home run. It's not the least expensive burger combo (about $14), but a great treat for a special celebration.

We needed a small break from all the buffets in the hotels. Boyyyyyyy....did we make the right choice because ALL the food was ""A freaking MAZING"". We have eaten in dozens of restaurants but the cozy, homie decor, made you feel right at home. Flavors were bursting into our palates as the dishes were honestly...""ONE OF A KIND"". 

I made sure that the whole family ordered different dishes so that we would have the opportunity to try as much as we can. I had the ""Not your mama's grilled cheese sandwich"" w/ Tator Tots, my husband had the ""TNB signature burger"" w/ potato wedges, my daughter had the ""Mushroom BLT burger"" w/ Tator Tots, my boys had the ""Godson's baked Mac & Cheese"" w/ Tator Tots, my cousin had the ""Ruben sandwich"" w/ tator tots & my bro-in-law had the ""Skirt Steak"" w/ tator tots. All the dishes had a little side salad of mixed greens which was perfect so I didn't have to order my usual side salad that I never finish in other restaurants. We all had either homemade lemonade, citrus iced tea & peach iced tea.  All three were delicious and definitely refreshing in the hot Vegas weather. We ended our meal w/ an order of apricot & mixed berries scones which my personal fave was the Mixed berries scone.

We had the opportunity to take a peek into the kitchen because our table was right by the kitchen door & my 2 year old son was scoping out the scene. They leave the kitchen door wide open which is great to see that the kitchen was super clean & the chef was handling all the food up to code & preparing dishes w/ ""CARE"" which made me feel good about eating here considering I use to be a Restaurant Manager for 10 years and there's a reason why restaurants keep their kitchen doors closed.

Nothing particularly unique about it, just a good, hearty chicken and avocado sandwich. I think it had roasted peppers too? I had regular fries and it came with a small side salad as well - both were properly prepared and tasted good.

But what I do remember is the yummy Dirty Brownie - I ate it for like 4 days savoring the chocolatey goodness with the bits of fruit inside.

The only criticism I have of this place is that the service took a while. It's really only open for lunch hours, and I generally like my food to be timely when it's lunchtime. Also, the two sandwiches came out a good ten minutes apart, which is always a little awkward when you're eating with one other person.

They're currently located inside the Antique Mall, but will soon be moving locations. The owner mentioned the new location will be somewhere near Pebble and Eastern if I'm correct? ...In the same shopping complex as a Cuban restaurant and a movie theatre? LOL sorry that's so sadly vague, it's the best I got though.

Let me just cover your meal for you. Go for whatever on the menu PLUS BACON JAM. If 'Winner of Las Vegas Best 2014' is printed on the menu right under an item, how can you NOT try it? It definitely won its place for a reason and a spot definitely well deserved. Not to be mistaken as a sweet jelly similar to the typical fruit jellies in a jar, more like a clusterf*ck of bacon bits with a hint of sweetness.

The sandwiches are just OK to me, but it could also be because I don't really get that excited for sandwiches in general. I honestly would be perfectly happy with just the bacon jam and their tater tots as a meal...so nutritious. 

Although certain parts of the menu are just alright to me, it's the small details that matter.. the complimentary citrus tea when you check into yelp, the friendly 'at-home' type of service, and the overall decor and style is what makes me a true fan.",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,5,5,4,wSaGRdjrwhvri88JsEbEMg
3684536,2014-02-23,0,zblKqBFWq7HMACwacMpzig,"A group of six of us had the pleasure of trying Truffles N Bacon today.  We were celebrating a birthday and, since we had no definite plans, I made the call to give them a try even though they had just opened and most of the existing Yelp reviews seemed to be from people with almost no prior reviews.  In short, all six of us left extremely satisfied and will all definitely return.

Truffles N Bacon is located INSIDE the antiques mall.  It's a little difficult to find, but worth it.  The room itself is small, yet cozy and inviting.  The staff are very friendly and made us feel at home right away.  The menu is quite large and everything sounds delicious.  On top of that, there is a specials board with even more delicious-sounding items.

I started with the citrus iced tea and it was wonderfully refreshing.  The tea was light with just the right amount of lemon and, best of all, it was not too sweet.  There was also the occasional shred of mint leaf which was a nice touch.  With the entrees we ordered all being extremely rich, this iced tea was perfect to cut through the flavors and cleanse the palate.

Most of us got either the Signature Hamburger or the Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese.  The hamburger had a nicely cooked beef patty (quite juicy), a rectangular slice of crispy mac and cheese, and bacon jam.  A Sriracha mayo came on the side.  A side of fried tater tots tossed in truffle oil was also included, as were some salad leaves.  With the addition of the Sriracha mayo, the burger was excellent.  Savory, cheesy, spicy, and a hint of sweetness from the bacon jam all at the same time.  I also enjoyed the added texture of the mac and cheese noodles.  If I had to find fault, I would say the generic sesame seed bun could have been swapped for something lighter and homemade.  The menu listed the bun as a brioche, but it just looked like a regular supermarket sesame bun.  A fluffy eggy golden brioche bun like the ones used at Bachi Burger or Umami Burger would have been better.  But it's a small complaint for an excellent burger.

The Not Your Mama's Grilled Cheese was also excellent.  The bread choice was thick, crusty, and a perfect contrast to the mound of soft short rib, bacon jam, cheese, and blanched broccoli rabe.  The flavor of the short rib was great and elevated the grilled cheese.  As my friend said, ""this is definitely not my mama's grilled cheese"".  The dish is perfect and comes with sides of truffled tater tots and salad.

My friend ordered the Pimp My Bruschetta, where you can choose any three of five types of bruschetta.  She enjoyed the minty pureed peas with bacon jam one the best.  She also had the mushroom with Brie and the babaganoush and liked them very much as well.

We also all shared an order of Godfather's Mac and Cheese.  It was the best mac and cheese I've had in a long time.  It comes out hot with crispy cheese and burnt edges.  The short rib added savoriness and the flavor was incredible.  They should do this exact same mac and cheese, add red chili flakes in with the cheese, and call it  the ""Hot Godfather"" or something.  I'd order that.

We also received a very nice dessert platter from the kitchen to help us celebrate the birthday.  It was a very appreciated gesture and the staff seemed happy to do it.

This might be an overly long review considering it's longer than my review of Per Se, but I was very impressed by Truffles N Bacon and want them to stick around, so I figured I'd post something more detailed than what was already on Yelp.

If I had one critique of the food, I would say that the spring mix salad on each entree platter was unnecessary.  It didn't really add anything to the meal.  I would have rather seen them come up with some signature crispy apple/carrot/radish slaw using an acidic and maybe slightly gingery dressing (no mayo).  It would be the perfect contrast to the rich food.  Serve it chilled in small chilled ramekins and it would be much more appreciated than just simple spring mix.

My only regret was not having room for the french toast bread pudding they had on the specials board today.",M9hpSOJG67mGXuwlansGjg,4,0,5,a14A4koero3w_nFCc4VG1w

4261697,2014-05-28,2,zblKqBFWq7HMACwacMpzig,"Tucked away into the back corner of the Antiques at the Market, I sort of felt like I entered a cutely decorated friend's house. The only downside is that there wasn't anyone to greet us and we didn't see a sign that said ""seat yourself"". The layout added to the confusion because there was an open door to the kitchen with people working hard in that area. We were thinking...do we go up to that door to order? Do we take a seat and wait for someone to notice us? We saw another couple in the restaurant eating and just decided to take a seat and figured that someone would be out soon after that. We waited about five minutes and I decided to go to the open door to see what the format for ordering was for this place. I stood there for a solid 30 seconds before someone acknowledged me and they let me know that someone would be right out. 

After that bit of confusion, the service and food was absolutely excellent! They had some interesting specials, but I came there on a mission...to try their signature burger. I enjoy places that have distinctive items. I consider myself a decent enough cook and I eat salads everyday for work, so I when I go out to eat, I turn my nose up at ordering Cobb salads or dishes I can make at home with ease. I go out to eat to be wowed and I was definitely wowed.

I ordered their signature burger with fries and their iced caramel coffee. My boyfriend ordered their cubano burger (it was a special on the chalkboard with pickles, pork, ham, mustard, on their bun) with a vanilla iced coffee and tater tots. I will just say that when I bit into my burger, my eyes just bulged...so many flavors! The salty-sweet bacon jam, mixed with the huge portion of mac n cheese (it was the type of mac n cheese that I love because it has the crispy baked edges and super creamy), with a juicy patty. I was not able to pick out the sriracha ketchup out but the flavor combination was divine. My boyfriend took a bite and said ""I want to make love to this burger"". The fries and tater tots are made with truffle oil, which is my personal favorite way of having fries. I feel like that meal hit a lot of my favorites!

They had a prepared pitcher of cucumber-lemon flavored water for anyone to grab. The only downside to that is my boyfriend hates cucumbers, so he was not able to grab any water. The iced coffees were a little too sweet for my taste. Still great and next time I would like to try their signature iced tea. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Grab a bite and then let the food digest while walking around the adorable antique market. It makes for a lovely lunch date!",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,6,1,4,fgl6e9Z-C618hFSaEXbH1w

Can't recommend just one thing because they are all delicious-- Definitely try anything with macaroni and cheese. Their signature iced tea is so refreshing. I've asked for it Arnold Palmer style which makes it even more delicious to drink. Food is definitely a little heavy but you will be satisfied with left overs

I had the watermelon shake and the grilled cheese. My husband had the bruschetta. The watermelon was perfect, sweet and refreshing with a hint of mint. The grilled cheese which was probably the best I have ever had came with tater tots. My husband made a face when I ordered them over the sweet potato fries since he isn't normally a fan but once they arrived he couldn't keep his hands off of them. He loved all three of his bruschetta (bacon jam and pea, baba ganoush, and haloumi cheese and grape). He declared the bacon jam and pea his (marginal) favorite which was a surprise because he normally doesn't like peas either.

It is fully toasted with a healthy portion of pulled pork, tomatoes, bacon jam and kale. And get the tator tots on the side...trust me.

Located inside Antiques at the Market and bolstering its Williamsburg-hipster credentials with a name like Truffles n Bacon Café I'll be the first to admit that I entered Jackie Lim's tiny restaurant as a skeptic but with a selection of specials equally well crafted as those on an exemplary daily menu I emerged a believer; sentiments that even steamy temperatures, amateur service, and a room-full of needy Red Hats couldn't thwart.  Based on the concept of accessible decadence and tucked away in a cozy corner with cute décor it was just past noon when I arrived at Truffles n Bacon and invited to seat myself after self serving the first of several cups of water menus were presented, a thin young man with odd mannerisms butchering pronunciations while more senior servers attended to a private party at the storefront window.  Every bit living up to its café credentials with a crafted menu of soups, salads, sandwiches, and small plates it was with some remorse that I passed over options like the Mac n' Cheese and Bacon Jam spiked sandwiches but focusing first on a duo of appetizers I was immediately free of regret, the small $2 scone a textbook example pocketed with butter and apricots while all three rounds of bruschetta proved bold  and balanced, the saline-sweetness of the haloumi and grape composition particularly enthralling.  Moving next to things more substantial suffice it to say that with housemade preserves gilding the proverbial lily one should pay close attention to the buttery brioche enveloped 'Monte Cristo' whose lack of deep frying renders it particularly light - a matter of particular importance to those with smaller appetites as no one should leave Truffles n Bacon without ordering dessert, the decadent wedge of dark chocolate brownie still molten at its core while two batons of vanilla custard laden bread pudding were treated to a high-temperature sear rendering the exterior caramelized as insides presented hot, jiggly, and amongst the city's very best desserts.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,5,4,zQHIDgddhRfRou_sEzHP2g
5349068,2014-10-16,6,zblKqBFWq7HMACwacMpzig,"Quaint, cute, cozy, and of course, amazingly delicious. I've been meaning to try out this location due to the reviews and the close proximity to my house. I finally got to try it with a friend and then got to try it again recently. 

Here are some of the things I tried:

Bacon Jam with Garlic Toast: Bacon jam is a thing? I'm actually not particularly a huge fan of bacon so this didn't make me go crazy. Though, it was very interesting. I had expected it to be savory but of course, since it was a jam, it was sweet. It was a sweet on savory toast. Sweet and savory ... one of the combos that I HATE the most. However, this certain combo didn't mess up my mind but that was probably because the taste of the bacon jam masked the garlic toast taste. Kehehe. It was good and worth of a try. 

Ryan's Choice with Grilled Chicken: Grilled cheese panini with chipotle mayo and grilled chicken. I have to say .. this was delicious. I LOVED the grilled chicken in the sandwich. It wasn't dry. It was juicy and so yummy. The flavors mixed so well together. Also, whenever you get a sandwich, it comes with either tater tots, sweet potatoe fries, or potatoe wedges and I opted for the tater tots. The tater tots were yummy! Crispy enough on the outside, warm on the inside, and just enough seasoning to top it all off. I don't even need ketchup for it! 

This Ain't Yo Mama's Sandwich: I got this the second time I visited. This normally comes with brisket but I subbed it with chicken instead because their chicken is delish! This sandwich has their famous bacon jam in it. Well, I wasn't so sure about this one since I wasn't a huge fan of their bacon jam but it worked very well with this sandwich. The flavors blended in very well. It had a nice sweet end taste to it. Now this is the type of sweet/savory blend that my palette can get used to! 

Dirty Brownie: This has cherries inside it! You can get it with ice cream or not. We decided not since we were quite full. But the brownie didn't look like the ones I usually see .. it was pretty GOOEY. It was warm and GOOOEY with chocolate and cherry goodness. It was rich and very good but it definitely should be something you get with ice cream. Delicious! My friend loved it very much. 

What I typically do is take half a sandwich home cause half a sandwich and some tater tots is enough to fill me. So it's great! I get lunch for the next day. The bread does get soggy but everything still tastes really good the next day.

When you check in on the yelp app, you also get a free cup of their signature citrus tea with a purchase of $12. Be warned: it has mint in it. I'm not a huge fan of the mint but the last time I had it, it was very subtle so it didn't bother me. It's VERY refreshing but I wish there were more lemon flavors in it.

The ONLY thing that bugs me is that it closes early. It's so hard to try to take my friends here when they're only free during the night! But since it's inside an antiques mall I guess I can't expect it to be the usual Vegas hours. Also, why don't they have regular fries?! They have sweet potatoe fries!!! I just love regular fries :P and wouldn't mind if they added it to the menu.

Overall, amazing places. I would love to go back and bring my friends. Delicious and worth a try. The server is also very very nice. Be a little patient as well cause there's only one server. Not a place you wanna eat at if you're in a hurry!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,8,7,4,YZSdF0JtrmXpOBAfjoQoIA

5492374,2014-03-03,1,zblKqBFWq7HMACwacMpzig,"Unique location and amazing food!  This little gem is hidden in the corner of the Antiques Market.  They have only been open about 2 weeks but I predict longevity for this cafe.  The chef, Jackie Lim, is a transplant from NYC and has brought her signature bacon jam to Vegas.  Rumor on the street that she cooked for Bill Clinton...well there's also a picture on the wall =)  The style comes across as comfort food with an Asian touch, done with a rustic twist.  The meal starts with complimentary chips and home made garlic hummus.  After stalking the Yelp reviews, we settled on the TNB signature burger and the The Ryan (panini with brisket).  However, other options were quite tantalizing as well, such as the Chicharron cobb salad...and I don't even like salad.  But hands down, the highlight of the meal was the TNB signature burger.  One of the best burgers in Vegas, what is there not to like about a hamburger with bacon jam, mac and cheese, and sriracha mayo inside a brioche bun?!  The rich flavor from the gooey mac and cheese pairs perfectly with the spicy sriracha and the sweet/salty bacon jam. The burger comes with a side of greens and fried tater tots tossed in truffle oil.  My one small complaint was that my tater tots weren't as crispy as my fiances...noticeably pale compared to his golden ones.  But minor discrepancy that I'm sure they will work out.  The staff is extremely friendly and constantly checks to make sure everything is to your liking with the meal.  The Ryan had amazingly tender brisket, but it pales in comparison to the TNB burger.  As we were eating, a food critic happened to walk in, so of course I eavesdropped on her conversation.  They apparently have fresh brewed citrus teas, and a collection of fresh made pastries.  On the weekends, they have different flavors of scones, cakes, and brownies for breakfast/dessert as well.  These delectables are created by a baker of Finnish origin, also a transplant from NYC.  With the myriad of unique daily specials and a strong base menu, I'm rooting for this restaurant to survive the Las Vegas market.  The cafe has a quaint feel and after eating to your hearts content, you can browse the peculiar items at the Antiques Market, giving your stomach a little time to digest.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,4,4,5,KhjJL55xNn13-ib80To90g
