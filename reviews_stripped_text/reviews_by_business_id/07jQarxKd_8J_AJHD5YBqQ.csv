84800,2015-05-17,0,07jQarxKd_8J_AJHD5YBqQ,Overall this place was really good!! Sometimes it can be really hard to find healthy options when eating out. But this place solves that! From the calories on the menu to the detailed listing of what's in each dish. I came in today with my boyfriend while out running errands. I was starving and wanted everything but decided on getting the El Mexicana which I would give a 4 out of 5. The boyfriend got the Yee-ha wrap and ate it all before I could steal a bit. He loved it! The El Mexicana was good the only two things that I would have to say weren't was the salsa on top and the steak was a little dry. The salsa tasted like it came from a jar. Which isn't a huge deal but made me a bit sad because i was excepting fresh salsa. Now the steak being dry might just be because I like my steak medium rare. But it was still really good! My boyfriend even said that the brown rice actually tasted good and he hates brown rice! This place is great and I look forward to trying other dishes and maybe getting the meal plan.,0STzoFERNkIAFtuA5SI0Qw,1,0,4,HafErJPWQGO4KDLObnfMrA
86115,2017-06-01,0,07jQarxKd_8J_AJHD5YBqQ,I love finding healthy places to eat. This place appears to have excellent food and options. It is a little pricy though. I did get the Char broiled chicken strips for under 6 bucks. It's 4 of of chicken stripped with a choice of dipping sauce. Good source of lean protein. Ill be back for the many other choices when im reading to spend 10 bucks for a salad,3hb6QHWNPmFZQ0JPVnJL0A,0,0,4,7MNHbhw7-25jRnM0IW3Kfw

My wife had a Grilled Chicken Entree which looked tasty to the eye but the chicken was very dry and seemed like it was pre cooked and later microwaved. The broccoli was good and the baked potato side she ordered was a bit dry as well. She also had a chocolate Peanut butter protein shake that was a bit watered down. 

Going in for my first time I observed the personnel behind the counter were young which isn't a problem but at the same time young people seem to not put as much effort into a JOB as someone that really supports this type of business. So I assumed the food would be a bit bland. 
Nothing against hiring younger crowds but you can't expect them to be as dedicated, besides, to them it might just be another paycheck. 

My wife and I will be back and give it a 2nd go. Thanks for having us",MGrJ-M6_mQ7xvT2bpB_JcA,2,0,3,erQDTpXFZ69JvLzq0L1e3w

About 2 weeks ago my wife and I stopped by for lunch and I noticed that our dishes were dirty, my wife didnt want to make a scene and went up to the shift manager in charge at the time and let her know that both our dishes were dirty.   The young lady in charge inspected the dishes herself and apologized to us and served us another meal in clean plates.

Well two weeks later I convince my wife to give them another shot since I love their menu and they let us down again by serving us dirty dishes.  It almost seems like the dishes were only wiped down with a cleaning cloth and no actual person or machine is cleaning these dishes.  Again, I am not a person that over exaggerates just wanted to review and hope they get this fixed...

He liked the bbq chicken wrap he got even though it was just that - chicken and bbq sauce. But the western potatoes he got were wayyy spicy, even for me and i love habaneros!

I got the chicken sandwich - chicken was a little dry but still was good. A huge sandwich for me, i cut it in half. And i got mixed veggies for my side which i LOVED. 

We also ordered 2 fruit smoothies/juices (strawberry & four berry) which were watery and sweet and reminded me more of flat Shasta. We put them in the freezer and forgot about them so they froze. But they were even better this way as they turned into delicious granitas!! 

Still, i would ordered from here again. It is a bit pricey... $40 lunch for 2",Fc5wACYVg9215AZPm5lHXA,1,0,3,ArfrU-Tlsxm4H9puStRHQw

That worked ""decently"" for awhile. EVERYTIME I called to place an order.. The phone service was POOR. No phone or business etiquette. After the service I received today, I will NEVER order from this location EVER again. I called & placed a delivery order.. After dealing with the rude female who took my order.. I was relieved to get off the phone. About 5 minutes after placing my order I received a phone call from MMG stating that they had ""ran out of what I ordered"". I didn't mind (even though it was A BURGER & they are A GRILL??) .. I asked to cancel my order & I wanted a refund. The girl said it was no problem... I then asked if they had a reference number or SOMETHING so I could verify they had refunded my money.... She then began to have a conversation with her manager (while still on the phone with me) talking about the cancelation & I could hear him say ..that to cancel I would have to contact my bank. The girl asked her manager if he wanted to just talk to me himself... WHICH HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO CALL ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. After about a minute of the girl & manager going back and forth (I'm still on the phone.. Hearing everything) the manager picks up the phone & says (verbatim) ""Hello"" I said ""yes?"" He said ""hold on"" (so rude).... Then they started talking again. Then he said ""hello?"" I said ""yes, I'm here"" he said ""it's been voided"" & that was it.

We have health issues and dietary restrictions that make it difficult to find a good place to eat. This place had everything we were looking for and more. We got some chicken wraps as we needed to get going fast. This was the best fast food ever. My BBQ chicken wrap was spicy but very flavorful. The cucumber salad had the perfect balance of vinegar onion and cucumber to make it amazing. The salad tasted fresh and not out of a bag like some places do. Another good point was that there to go boxes are reusable. I don't mind advertising for these guys. They really make eating healthy easy. Plus their mango smoothie was the best I ever had. It wasn't just overwhelming sweet. It had that sweet tart flavor that comes with a real good fresh mango. Perfect. Our family raved about the place for an hour afterwards. Most places disappoint because I can cook better at home. Not the case here. It was worth the money and I felt full AND satisfied. Those that do fast food know that is hard to do. Good job guys!

So we inquired as to the whereabouts of the chicken and turkey meatballs.  They accommodated us by re-making the meals.  However, due to the time it was taking we had to ask for our ordered to go.  When we got home the turkey meatballs were still missing.  

I felt that the persons cooking the food were not supervised adequately.  They truly did not seem to know what was to be included in the orders.  A couple of other persons had to return food due to the fact that there were items missing.  The gal working the cash register needs to be trained in her duties.  She does not have a grasp on the menu or working the register.  

My husband and I are so interested in their meal plans to take to work. We are a little nervous ... looking for someone who is receiving the meal plans...How is it working out?  

Again, I really want this place to succeed.  The concept is great.",577yFF9Pj8_zKZ2rxWTa8g,1,0,3,mXKENqSCjN9IGDt2w0DfTA

The cashier was friendly and gave me some suggestions on the menu since it was my first time. Not to discriminate on age because I've seen 10 year olds throw down on the kitchen network, but I should've seen the young lady who is supposed to be a cook behind the grill as a bad sign. She looked like she was 12... Do you really know how to cook?

I ended up getting the Tex Mex wrap with a side Caesar. I understand that the ingredients were supposed to be healthy, but the fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheese they put in the wrap was not very good. At least put the sour cream on the side so it's not all melted and gross in my wrap. The fat free Caesar dressing on my salad was thick and shiny: not yummy. I've never not finished a Caesar salad and I left this one alone. I've bought really good lowfat and fat free Caesar dressings at whole foods before- this one was a bad choice by the owner or chef.

Suggestions to the owner: get a real chef or experienced cook.

I doubt I'll give this place another chance.",NC7rJju47IS8OprG-clXvQ,2,1,2,g-ZMhRtvqaapWek1TCt-bg

  I get that it's a healthy place and it's why I tried to like it here, but common with the bland taste. You can serve sides like broccoli, rice, and beans with some flavor and some sauce or something so it's not so dry. 
  It's not that hard to use some herbs and spices with an adequate amount of salt. I've tried the raw broccoli thing before; it gets old pretty quick and in all honesty, it's not necessary because it's so easy to add some taste.   
  For real, bland and dry broccoli and other sides is the taste of their food. The wraps are sub par at best and they are not that flavorful. 
  I'm not sure what everyone else is raving about but it looks to me like the Rocky Balboa and other things are masked by the sauce and cheese. And to be honest the Balboa is not anything I would want to try, having considered it 3 times. 
  I wanted to like this place but the best thing I can say is that they have a 5 star apricot smoothie and I love that they give you plastic wear that you can reuse for when you cook your meals. That's not worth my 4th visit here, which is very disappointing.
  Thank god I actually do prep my meals or I may feel forced to go here more often to get a healthy meal. God forbid North Las Vegas get a Greens and Proteins or something other than a carls jr or Chipotle. 
  Step it up MMG! Change your recipes by adding some herbs and spices to your veggie sides. Add some taste and texture/sauce to your rice and beans because there is Zero and please let me know when you do. I would love to Love this place, but it is impossible when I cook better than you do.

Dropped by for lunch with my boyfriend for something light to eat. Prior to arriving, I visited Muscle Maker's website and perused its menu. I based my order on the photos on their website, foolishly thinking that what I saw was what I was going to get.

Fresh Shrimp: On the website's menu, there's an image of a small bowl containing what appears to be seasoned shrimp garnished with diced tomatoes. In reality, I received a small bowl of plain shrimp. At a fast food franchise, you know your food isn't going to look exactly how it does in the photo. Maybe I should've thought the same before coming to this place.

Baked Potato: They didn't have any sweet potatoes while I was there, yet they did have sweet potato fries, which I passed. Instead, I ordered the ""baked"" potato, which I watched one of the employees microwave. 

El Mexicana: This was my boyfriend's order. We both agree it was bland. Enough said.

I had a co-worker rave about this place years ago and at the time; they were just based on the East Coast.  Well, now they're here and I was curious if my bud knew what he was talking about. Their menu consists of wraps, soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, protein shakes, and smoothies.  Also on their menu are the total calories for each dish.  

I had two meals.

Meal #1:  Premium Burger, Baked Potato, and an extra Chicken Breast.  There was nothing really special about the baked potato.  It was on the small side.  I thought that the burger was as juicy and as tasty as it gets for a 90% lean burger.  The highlight was the chicken breast. I eat a lot of chicken throughout the week.  In my opinion, Muscle Maker's was one of the best clean chicken breast that I've had in a while.  The meat was thick, plump, and grilled just right. 

Meal #2:  Rocky Balboa Wrap.  I only got this because one of the regulars and the employees suggested it.  I'm glad they did.  This wrap had chicken breast, turkey meatballs, cheese, and marinara.  This isn't the cleanest meal on their menu, but perfect if you're trying to up your calories and at the same time get your protein in.  Taste wise, this was pretty good.  


The restaurant is clean and they should be since they're new.  The staff is great and there are a lot of them.  This Muscle Maker is located near the 24 Hour Fitness, which drove a lot of post-work out diners here. So, it can get busy. Overall, I'm a fan will come back.  I have an office just 5 minutes from here and when it's time to pound some protein, it's nice to know that there's a place minutes from me.

I had a chicken Caesar wrap with pasta salad and a mango smoothie the first time I went.  They were very generous with the chicken, and the chicken Caesar wrap is supposed to be low-carb so the chef sweetly double-checked with me that that was still the side I would like.  The mango smoothie was very good!  The girls working the register have been super sweet every time I have been there.  I can't imagine anyone complaining on their service- I watched them be nice to every guest and try to help everyone the best they could.  My later visits I modified the wrap to get a shrimp Caesar wrap with a regular white wrap rather then lo carb.  I also tried the cucumber salad but unfortunately I did not like it as much.

I walk in and in greeted by a girl that asks if I've ever been there before. I said no. And so she tells me about this free shirt offer they'er having. Cool. Nothing about the food


So upon arriving I'm hit with a sewage smell. Idk if they were having plumbing problems, but it was def pungent... Not very appetizing.

I'm a nice person I give places a chance, especially mom and pop places that are new or just open up. I've never heard up this place before but apparently there all over the east coast.  


But this place..idk after ordering the burger. Pretty much the most simple thing to make they couldn't even really do. They gave me the burger with a        Piece if turkey bacon that wasn't even grilled on the flat top. Just right out of the package it seemed like-_- 


The brown rice looks gross just simple not even a unique touch or anything.... Especially after going to GREENS AND PROTEIN for the first time last week and then coming here WAS A HUG DISAPPOINTMENT..    Tables were wiped down with a dirty towel you could tell.. And everyone there seemed like they were just interested In getting to the gym on time or going home to sleep then do their job. 


I specifically said like 3 times this is my first time coming to this establishment. The girl who took my order didn't even give me my change back I had to ask for it-_-.  I will not be returning to this place. Id honestly rather drive the 20 miles to greens and fucking proteins .... Even Rachael's kitchen down the street is better and healthier. Give me a break. The owner should look for better employees and a better cook. Take a look at this piece of turkey bacon. Wtf?! Joke...


Oh and btw.... After having a couple bites of the burger it's more like an undercooked sloppy joe. I seriously have no clue or any idea how this thing stayed together..  

Seriously people I'm not just some pissy bitter person that got a snooty cashier so I decided to write this review. I'm writing this so you don't go and waste you 10 bucks like I did. People work too hard in the valley for fake ass people to be opening so called health food joints that are anything but that.... Huge disappointment HUGE.

I was excited to go my first time. Just wasn't overly fond of the lack in taste of food and girls who were there pointlessly. They were prolly intended to be eye candy but didn't work out at all.

I have not tried their food, though the menu looks really appealing. I tend to come here after the gym to grab a low calorie protein shake. Their shakes are really delicious and pack a lot of protein - over 40 in a 32oz. The prices are reasonable too. I really enjoy the Snappy Apple and Fresh Strawberry Banana shakes. Be sure to specify you want a protein shake and NOT a smoothie, as they have those too. 
One of my favorite parts is being able to check nutritional content. The menu does not display it but it's available online.
The restaurant is always very clean and tidy. Staff is friendly and has been efficient the last few times, though I remember a time of me standing at the register for a while without anyone approaching me.

This is a place that has its beginnings in the East Coast. They offer meals suited for body builders, calorie counters and weight watchers. 

They have smoothies, wraps, salads, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, protein shakes, sugar-free cheesecake and protein cookies. Calorie information on all items and macronutrient information on some items are posted on their menu.

Rocky Balboa Wrap:
Turkey meatballs, chicken breast, marinara, reduced-fat mozzarella in an herb wrap. Yup, lots of lean protein. Very tasty! 5/5

Turkey Meatball Parmesan Wrap:
Turkey meatballs, Parmesan, marinara and reduced-fat mozzarella in an herb wrap. It's like Rocky Balboa minus the chicken but with 15 more calories. 4/5

Caesar Salad:
This was ok. Nobody gets excited over a Caesar Salad anyway. Dressing, croutons, chopped lettuce with Parmesan cheese on top. 3/5

Cucumber Salad:
Think sunomono but with onions. In other words, cucumbers with pepper and vinegar. It's the easiest salad to make but refreshing and tasty. 3/5

Turkey Chili:
With my recently developed tomato allergy, I had to specify I can't have salsa or tomatoes on my chili. I'm also not a fan of sour cream so, I asked for them to not put it on my chili. They seem to be pros at customizing their dishes. They made my chili according to my specifications without hesitation. Ground turkey, red beans, low-fat cheddar on brown rice. This is so yummy and better since you get lean protein from turkey and complete proteins from brown rice & beans. 4/5

BBQ Steak Wrap:
You can also get this with chicken instead of steak. Fat-free hickory BBQ sauce, reduced-fat cheddar cheese in a white wrap. The BBQ sauce was good. Tangy, sweet and smokey. The steak was tender. 4/5

Strawberry Protein Shake:
At 280 calories and about 42g of protein...this has got to be one of the most nutrient-dense protein shakes I've ever had! It tastes like candy too. 4.5/5

Chocolate Peanut Butter Protein Shake:
I get a similar protein smoothie from a smoothie chain in town but that one has 500+ calories and only 20-30g of protein. Whereas this protein shake has about 390 calories at about 42g of protein. Yum! 5/5

The wraps come with either free sides (baked potato, broccoli, Caesar salad, cucumber salad, brown rice, western potatoes, veggies or pasta salad) or upgrade your side to Cajun pasta, turkey meatballs, turkey bacon, rice and beans or spinach. You have a low-carb wrap option for a few cents extra.

I love their to-go containers too. Their reusable and microwave-safe which I'll be using for meal prep! Great stuff. Their menu is dietician approved - nutritious and delicious!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,3,4,OLIJTaslbo8zP8bzxnC1Pg

Before our food was brought out, my husband noticed hat the guys cooking had no hair nets and one guy kept licking his finger with the glove on.  He was not happy with that at all.

I ordered the chicken teriyaki, thinking that there was no way that could be screwed up. I was wrong. The chicken was dry, and the entire entree was flavorless, like they didn't even use a sauce.

Some people have stated that they are slow but I offer that they cook your food fresh as ordered so that definitely takes a bit of time. To me, it's worth it to wait for something cooked and made fresh rather than have something done quickly that is full of ingredients that have been sitting around for awhile.

I started a new way of life more than 3 months ago and clean, high protein, low calorie, healthful eating is a big part of that. MMG has been such a help for me as there are so many days that I get tired of cooking and they do it for me and cook the way I would. They have a menu section dedicated to entrees under 400 calories and that's right up my alley.

I suggest the Mona Lisa Wrap, the Penne Romano, the Godfather as well as any number of their awesome protein shakes.

If you pay attention all the bad reviews are from people that have become accustomed everything that your body grazes but doesn't need. Bland taste?! WRONG!!! The food here is very flavorful. Society today is just used to over seasoning their food. 

Okay, enough of the rant. Bottom line..... My family and myself absolutely love this place. We frequent it 2-3 times a week for a post workout meal. I see them make meal plans for people all the time!!! There is no other place to eat healthy and with top notch customer service to boot.",12_Tc17Y9nBJWoJzdhBhlQ,2,1,5,W2KjdcMiwJV6kg0qG-Eetg

It's just sad to see that they aren't all great as they seem to be. A healthier approach should be tasty! 
I ordered the Mexicana which tasted like canned salsa on top; Sweet Potato fries which tasted like they were microwaved after being frozen ($3.99); and a side of guac $1.99 for 2 oz

It got me by from hunger but I would not be coming back.",Wdm3hCNmJwD689wD6-Bb0w,1,0,3,swH4YLjI6eDTZ7gfpQQ6wQ
