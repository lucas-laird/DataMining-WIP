The guy that seated us didn't look like he worked there. The only xtreme thing about this place was the dude's shirt. The waitress didn't even thank us after. The sushi was decent. Definitely not worth the service. Balls I tell you, balls!!",1DKYCvYf_ec7msT-lL6fOA,3,1,1,G8rV2aoco3pI71BYzIcLlQ
37682,2012-06-18,0,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"Tiffany our server was good.  The sushi was the worst I've had in years.  The xtreme sushi in southern highlands is the best. The fish in the southern highlands location are cut very well.  Takashi is the man he is sushi.  The silverado location was horrible.  Too much rice it over powered everything.  There were no uniformity, some had little rice how it should be and others had tons of rice for nigiri sushi.  What can I say the original location is excellent.  The chefs are top notch and the quality and consistency is always great.  Silverado location is the same company but not even close with quality.  

I guess they will need a clone of the southern highland chefs.",AB9feSffr3izgqH8N1NVdw,0,0,1,Mal8_vo7IAAZ1USMnY5CeQ

She stated that the patio was closed and that there was a 15 minute wait for the patio.  We asked if she could come get us if we sat at the bar ( my girlfriend and I btw),  In a panicked mood as if she had the whole world on her shoulders said yes i will get you when ready.  We sat at the bar and there was a murder scene on tv which means management was not paying attention to their entertainment.  There was no bartender and the only person who finally came to the bar was a server who didn't know how to bartend.  One random server started to tell us weird drink specials and the bartender had no clue.  We ordered some saki bombs and after 15 minutes we went to the host and asked about our seats.  She looked completely baffled and didn't remember us.  The random host actually seated us and she was horrible.  More interested in how she looked than her job.  We quickly ordered and after 20 minutes had not received one thing to eat.  We decided to move to the bar.  Upon doing so it was a Sh*t show.  The Jersey shore character posing as a idk what..manager, chef... a person pretending to work there was destroying the sushi he was preparing.  The bar was drinking with each other and doing shots with everyone which seemed fun but completely un-professional.  We had enough of the clown show and I found the original server to come to find out  I over paid for the original ""happy hour price i was supposed to get on my 2 shots.  At that point I paid w/ 20% gratuity because servers should be penalized for a horrible establishment, horrible management and horrible owners.

The variety is awesome from the get go but now they charge more and your getting less on your plate. Not just a little less but alot.

Ordered the kids meal which says it comes with desert. When it was time to get my son the desert- sorry we are out of desert. NO offer of substitution, no discount on ticket- just F U.

154105,2014-01-20,0,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"Our waitress Julz was awesome!!!!! Everything she recommended was incredibly delicious. Ask for the garlic ponzu sauce to dip your rolls in, trust me it's orgasmic. The Xtasy roll and The Kobe Burger were to die for. I'm definitely coming back soon. This was our review early last year five stars back then. 

They changed management in September 2013 and we went twice to give it chances this was the third chance and this is awful. I gave it two stars because the service is still decent but the food is awful!!! First it is a long weekend and it is early Sunday evening no Kobe Beef no Goya that's to start, we didn't get a delivery of food. The shrimp tempura was 4 pieces and they were in a depressing plate with more breading than anything. The rolls were mediocre at best because all the sushi left. My mother cannot do traditional rolls so she has to do the cooked ones and when it came out it was deep fried in old lard. The vegetable tempura was ok except the sweet potato was raw. 


Before the manager used to come and give free cocktails he was a very muscular Italian guy mixed with Japanese the new manager is no where to be found. Sadly to say three strikes you are out and we will NEVER be coming back. Before this place was happening and I recommended to everyone heck I moved from Henderson to Centennial Hills and I would still drive 30 minutes to eat here now it's just depressing here.

There is little experience behind who is making the rolls (rice was not cooked correctly and did not stick to the roll, which was cut into huge, uneven pieces), house salad was drenched in dressing, almost inedible.  it's too bad because outside dining is hard to find here and they have a great patio, but we won't be going back.",-PseE2QGddW0IZ3sbZ_rNQ,0,0,1,IGdS8B64bUlNpsJPo__gqg

We arrived at 9pm which we thought would be a good time to avoid any type of wait. A strong pungent fish odor hits you as soon as you walk through the door. Even though there was only 2 people at the bar that we could see and it was relatively quiet, it took about 5 minutes before someone came out and greeted us. He said it would still take 5 minutes for a table. So we waited. TWENTY MINUTES LATER ... We were still waiting. Did they forget about us? Were they hoping we leave so they could close early? Did they run out of sushi? Was it too much to ask for the employee to stop BSing with the sushi chef to seat us? Does it really take 30 minutes to get a table at 9pm in a neighborhood sushi place??? We finally CALLED and the same person came out talking about having only 2 servers and a big party. FAIL all around.

227251,2014-01-25,0,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"Not sure what our servers name was (Matt or Adam?) because we hardly saw him. 
He hardly spoke to us and the two 3-year old girls we decided to take out to sushi. 

First of all, we requested a secluded spot due to our little guests, in order to not bother other people. Mistake #1: we are sat around young adults and others that are trying to have a cool and quiet Friday night sushi dinner. The opposite of the a 3-year old's idea of fun. 

It seemed clear that our server was a bit put off by our younger guests. Maybe he thought there would be a rice tornado for him to clean up followed by a horrible tip. Mistake #2: You shouldn't assume anything about your customers. we are avid restaurant eaters, great tippers and we've been to Xtreme sushi before - it was good then. 

We sat down to open our menus and received a waft of wet dungeon within each old rag-wiped page.  Mistake #3: making your customers stomach turn before they have ordered. We politely told our server - very nicely, just so he could tell everyone else. 

One of the appetizers we ordered was a Miso soup - 1 order and an empty bowl, so that the two girls could share it. That miso soup was super cold once we got the second bowl we requested. Mistake #4: no apology, not even a smidgen of remorse. 

And don't get me started on the edamame fiasco. I mean, isn't it one of the things you eat prior to getting sushi? We ordered two servings. We eventually received one bowl and just reminded him of the second. Mistake #5: We never got another one, or an apology. We thought to ourselves, ""Maybe he's new?"" 

More than enough time goes by between our server's visits to us and we are still just hungry and patient. Our waters are gone.  Mistake #6: we have to ask other table's servers to please grab us some refills of water. 

Once our rolls come, they are promptly whisked on the table, as if our server's smoke break was starting. Mistake #7: the sushi is served on big white round diner plates. Not the long, dark and sleek traditional sushi plates that we are used to. Mistake #8: Where the hell is the wasabi and ginger? Why, when we ask, is it like asking for your first born child? I mean, c'mon! 

Due to the time in between our server's visit, the server's mistakes, the cleanliness of things and the quality of the food, we decide to just tell another server, the one that would grab us water, that we are not happy with the service. 

We see that server and our server discussing in the hallway. 
Mistake #9: Our server takes it out on us. He is not happy and shows it when he delivers our green tea ice cream (the only dessert they have in stock) with out one word. Anyone in the industry (the industry we have been in ourselves) knows this is not the solution. 

To top it all off, we had a groupon, the only reason we came to xtreme sushi, and it doesn't apply to All You Can Eat sushi, which we had.  Awesome. 

Needless to say, we won't be back. Anyone want our groupon for this place?",sRIexTzQJqkgs82u-qc9Fg,5,0,1,E8lKoMuQMpprAVtDRs6Cyw

Tonight, I arrived at 6:40pm by myself.  There was only three patrons sitting at the sushi bar and another three tables of patrons throughout the restaurant.  A host or waiter, unapologetically,  came up to me and said that there would be a 20 minute wait for myself because there was only one chef working tonight.  I left.

I would not advise anyone to go here because there is a very good chance it will be a waste of your time even on a slow night because they refuse to staff chefs properly.

308242,2014-05-23,1,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"I first learned about Xtreme Sushi from a Groupon offering and bought 2 coupons.  

The first time we went, we sat outside.  Several of us ordered the ""All You Can Eat Sushi"".  It should be called ""All You Can Eat Rice"" since the fish was barley visible.  The fish was sliced so thin that you could see right through it, and the chunks of rice where big and tasteless.  

The service was adequate, but I had the feeling that the server did not want to be there.  To top it off, we couldn't use the Groupon for the ""All You Can Eat"".

There were two reasons for going a second time.  First, I had a Groupon to use and second, I figured if I ordered a la carte, the food was bound to better.  This time we sat at the sushi bar and ordered a salad and a cut roll.  The food was OK and since it was NOT All You Can Eat, there was actually fish included!

The Sushi Chef was cooking something in a toaster oven and the smell was so bad I had to change my seat, trying to get away from it.  The Hip Hop music was loud and annoying.  The green tea tasted more like dirty water.  We had to ask for the wasabi and ginger and our server brought one very tiny serving for the 2 of us.  Really?

Oh, and I did I mention the menus, OMG they were so dirty and sticky that the pages stuck together.  I'm sure they have not been wiped off, EVER.

 I developed a terrible headache from the horribly loud music and obnoxious smells coming  from behind the sushi bar and couldn't wait to get out of there.

I learned two very important lessons from my experience at Xtreme Sushi & Sterling Steakhouse.  First, never buy a Groupon before checking reviews on Yelp.  Second, even if they were giving it away, it was not worth a second trip just to use a coupon.",Uj0FfOBt-QcdMBl8rn2w2g,0,0,1,h9Gi8gb50b2vg8VjsnLDqA

The AYCE has just about anything and everything on it from appetizers to burgers. We have never really had ""great"" service there. Sometimes we have ""good."" As of late I would say the service has been poor. The past couple of times we have gone we have been forgetten by our server (for close to an hour). There is a great selection of sushi. My Wife is allergic to shelfish so she really appreciates the many different rolls. However there is no consitency with the rolls. The ingredients listed seem more like general guidlines as you can order a roll then the next time you come it tastes completely different. Quality of the fish is also very inconsistent as sometimes it will be great then others it will be fishy or taste of bleach.

I ordered a teriyaki chicken lunch meal, and when it arrived, it literally looked like the chicken was strips reheated from frozen with some flat glaze on it.  it was sitting in a pool of water, which reaffirmed my guess, and then tasted very blah and mushy.   i also had to ask them to bring me i believe two different items that were listed on the menu but were not brought out.  the waitress had to ask me again what it was that i had ordered, and to point it out on the menu.  the place was NOT busy, and it was not a complicated order.  they also botched the pricing for one of my coworkers (almost double price), and the excuse was that it rang up different in the price register since it was a new menu...  needless to say, i ate maybe one bite of chicken and left it to soak in its water.  the california rolls were okay.  i have no reason to go back there, even though they handed us some more 20% off coupons.  we left them on the table",XWIvjOLBDSUkuzsh2UB-CQ,1,0,1,9namwyKrpoJJKhAyYC8fVw

The sushi here is disgusting.  They also try to give you mostly rice.  The rice ball under the nigiri is NOT supposed to be bigger than the slice of fish that's on top of it.  We asked the sushi cook Balthazar if he could make the sushi rolls with less rice, he said NO rudely.  Then proceeded to tell us If we didn't eat the rice we would be charged for each item.   He threw our plate back on the table.   The rice tasted like perfume or something.   Disgusting!  Defiantly NOT rice vinegar.  We told the waitress about it and she even tasted it and said it tasted like acetone!   We didn't even want to eat anymore because we were disgusted.  

The sushi cook Balthazar needs some lessons in being nice to customers and he needs to learn how to cook.   He was super rude to us.  Makes me never want to eat sushi ever again!

Then the waitress charges us for the two AYCE, $25.95 or something and a roll because my friend had eaten one roll but I'm sure she couldn't taste the acetone in that one because that roll was drenched in sauces!  Umm we shouldn't be charged for anything esp since she said it tasted like acetone!   First off rude service and disgusting, cheap mostly rice sushi from a guy who defiantly needs cooking lessons.

Waitress dropping off rolls identified almost every roll she brought wrong and twice tried to give us someone elses order, but there has been a MAJOR improvement in the food and I saw a lot more attention paid by waitresses at more tables.

First thing I ordered was Mussels from waitress. NEVER GOT THEM! I had FOUR plates piled on top of eachother and an empty water glass for 15+ minutes... I had to get up and go find a waitress- not even mine- to get more water. My waitress FINALLY came back after someone else brought me more water and said she was new and still learning, I said...still learning to pour water? She just shrugged. Her apology was very insincere. I asked for a manager. 
     Another waitress came over and said she was the ""acting"" kinda supervisor, 'cause there was NO manager on duty at 7pm on a Thursday night in the restaurant?!?!?!?! I said just bring me my check and that I was extremally unhappy and pissed off- not only by service, but having not gotten some of my food, and that the salmon in one of the rolls tasted a bit off. I fully expected a discount, as I didnt get some of my food and was not offered any dessert either and got 1 glass of water. There was no discount, I left COMPLETLY unsatisified. (fyi- I had my birthday dinner there in April, brought this restaurant a private group of over 30 people- was not a phenominal experience, but was decent for a large group and yet I got treated like this.) 
     Another thing to note, sushi bar only had 4 people at it and outside had 1 table, so restaurant was not completly full! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!

AGAIN......DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!! Maybe if enough people stay away, they will change the service and the attitude! What a terrible horrible awful experience...... thank goodness for Carl's Junior, where I stopped on the way home for a turkey burger even tho I had just paid 25 bucks for 4 items at Xtreme Sushi......",V8asoNKiCy23Px6d1idkLQ,4,0,3,r1Iz_tE7me0kD1qkAuI1JA

In fact, everything took a long time: ordering, receiving each food item, paying the bill, etc.  Apparently there was a private party in the back and the only 2 waitresses were busy there.

The deep fried Shumai is the only reason this place is getting more than 1 star, although by the time it got to our table it was barely still warm.  Since its deep fried, I'm assuming it just sat in the kitchen for a long time.  The garlic tuna nigiri eventually came next, and after eating it I wish we would have left right then and there.  The tuna was cut wrong, and it did not taste appetizing.  BTW they don't give you wasabi and ginger with your sushi, you have to ask for it. 

All of our handrolls were made with overcooked rice that was much too warm. The rice to sushi ratio was all wrong, and the rest of our rolls tasted awful.  After attempting to tell the waitress the spicy tuna was missing avocado and tasted awful, she insisted it was in there and left. I tried to send it back, and after over 30 minutes of sitting around trying to get the stupid awful roll off my check, I decided to join yelp to write this review.

Our ""quick sushi lunch"" became a 2+ hour ordeal. All we ordered was 1 shumai, 1 nigiri, and 2 rolls.",qizOINQJySNRfCakD9dkSw,0,0,2,oNBnYKz0am_VfOgToqPzeQ

Sushi wise, fish quality was ok and the chef seemed to be generous on the portion but the rolls and some of the appetizers we tried were way below par. 
Apparently they are targeting a different crowd of people. Rows in general were soaked in ponzu & soysauce. We could taste nothing but saltiness. The extreme organsm we ordered was flooded with yum yum sauce ( a seasame mayo miso dressing) that made the dish unpalatable. Imagine the frosting on the cupcake, that's how over-abundance the sauce was. 
They offer 4 types of ice-cream Mochi- strawberry, mango, vanilla and red bean. Simply skip the first 3 and stick with red bean. Classic green tea ice-cream was the most tasteless macha ice-creamI've ever had. It's like green-colored vanilla ice-ceam.",jR1QaUqe2bccY7I9BWGZBg,0,0,3,Gjt-8P_YGVgKXRyYoHOmIw

I wanted to buy my boyfriends parents dinner since it was their wedding anniversary, I gave a waitress my card and when the dad was presented with the bill it was for the full amount. It took 5-10 minutes of finding the original waitress to tell her the mistake she made and by then the surprise was over. 

I went there last week and wow the same crap again. Was there with 3 other people and well ordered at the same time. I ordered miso soup and a Philly roll, not too hard to screw up right?  Wrong. I got the miso soup when everyone else received their food. Another thirty minutes pass and no Philly roll. Waitress comes over and asks if i want anything else, so out of patience I order again. Another 30 minutes pass- still no roll- all while the others at the table are still getting all their food as they order. 

I'm in F&B so  I understand that at times it can get hectic on a Friday night but this was inexcusable. Finally after an hour my friend complains to the manager that is has been over an hour since I ordered and I want to cancel the order. The only reason the place isn't getting  a one star is for the manager and his attempt at fixing the situation. Boxed my simple Philly roll and took it off the bill.

588442,2011-03-23,2,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"I absolutely love sushi.  Maybe that means I'm going to be a tougher critic than normal, and maybe also beause I've had sushi just about everywhere in Vegas.  I went in with very low expectations due to the Yelp reviews and was still disappointed.  It's too bad because I really wanted to like this place...

The food was ""meh""...we had the following:

- ""Avacado Salad"":  mixed greens w/avacado in X dressing.  ($5.75)
Can you screw up a salad?  Yes.  That ""x dressing"", which I notice seems to be on like everything on the menu, was horrible.  It tasted like a watered down thousand island minus the relish (it was smooth in texture).  Not worth the $5.75, sadly.

- ""Kayla's Roll"": spicy yellowtail, daikon sprouts, seared tuna, topped w/garlic sauce.  ($14.90)
This was okay, but very loosely made and kept falling apart.  Again, overpriced.

- ""Albacore Sushi""  ($4.95)
OK so I asked for albacore, not seared albacore.  They have both on their menu...guess what I got?  Seared...same price, still ate it, didn't say anything to the waitress.  It was standard in taste.

- We asked for the spiciest roll on the menu...didn't like the waitresses recommendations so she had the sushi chef prepare a special, extra hot roll.  I can't remember how much this one cost, but it was probably overpriced.  I indicated to our waitress no cream cheese, no tempura, just fresh fish and extra extra extra spicy.  The roll that was produced from this request was very large, pretty much impossible to eat in one bite.  It was not spicy by any means, and had tempura shrimp on the inside.  Again, didn't say anything to our waitress, just ate it.

Now...you're probably asking yourself why, after all these mistakes, we did not say anything to our waitress.  Because the service at Xtreme Sushi = Xtreme SUCK and it was not worth our time/effort.  Putting in our drink order, we asked each for a glass of water and our ""adult beverages"".  Water was not brought.  We placed our order w/the server and again asked for water.  The salad was brought out.  Still no water.  Then our ""special"" roll was brought out.  I flagged down a girl walking around refilling other tables' water and asked for the water we had requested, as well as extra wasabi.  She brough the water.  No wasabi.  I asked another server for extra wasabi.  He did not bring it.  Our server came by the table, so I asked her for some.  Finally she brought it.  We ate the entire ""special"" roll.  She came by and took that plate and the salad.  About 25 minutes goes by...where is the rest of our food?  Finally I flag down our waitress.  She replies ""what else did you have?""  You've GOT to be kidding me!  After we told her it was about 10 minutes that went by and the albacore was brought out, then a few minutes later our Kayla Roll.  During our consumption a different server, Jersey Shore lookin' fella, came by with some random roll we didn't order.  My friend and I looked at each other like ""should we just take it cuz of our hastle?"" but we told him he had the wrong table.  He then came by a second time with another roll we didn't order!  Do we not have table numbers here?  I guess we shouldn't have been surprised at this point.

Hence the reason we did not say anything about our food, as we probably would have been there another 3 hours.  The dine in menus were regular sheets of paper, photo copied in black and white, I'm assuming from their S. Highlands location. The restaurant itself is huge, but you would never think so from pulling in the parking lot.  I felt like I was walking thru a maze to get to the restrooms (I don't see how they will ever fill the whole restaurant).  The food I would give 1.5 stars.  The service I would give -1 if it were possible, so that kind of averages out to 0.5 to 1 star.  I noticed none of the servers were Asian and the girls wore corsets.  There was one or two decently cute ones so that could be a plus...I guess.  If the food/service were just a tad better I would probably want to come back when the weather is a bit warmer to sit on the patio.  Otherwise, no.",9xBDxlvOPBT8I2L9lVSqxg,1,0,1,5kcvo8N06G2b167h2mdjZQ

595078,2011-06-01,4,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"Absolute WORST... let me reiterate... WORST restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas. First off to get it out of the way, I'm a big fan of sushi joints in Vegas. There are a ton of them and for the most part they're all pretty decent, if not some of the best you'll ever find on the west coast. 

Me and a few of my friends decided to eat here, considering it is a fairly new establishment and it's located on a busy major street; off the 215 freeway on Eastern. We're all avid sushi lovers and always willing to check out a new joint, especially a sushi joint, so its safe to say we had fairly high expectations. First mistake. The place was pretty packed; there was an outside patio and bar situated as a waiting area. It took them 35 minutes to seat the five of us in a booth right next to the kitchen. It's important to note that there is a distinct sewage odor around that area. Anyway, our server was pretty friendly and took our orders fairly quickly. You know how you have a perfect service experience up until after you order and you say to yourself this might not be so bad afterall? This was it. And it went down hill from there. 

We ordered edemame and pot stickers for the table and it took them 30 minutes to bring it out. 30 minutes. Immediately after the edemame and pot stickers came out, our entrees arrived EXCEPT for the three, 3, rolls of sushi we ordered. It took an additional 45 minutes for us to call for the manager because the sushi hadn't arrived yet. Yes you read that right, 30 minutes plus and additional 45 minutes for 3 rolls of sushi. Need I go any further?!?! We never got the sushi cause we bounced a few minutes afterwards.

OHHH I should ALSO add that we did speak to the manager, who vowed to box up our sushi when it was ready to bring out and have it on the house, BUT the manager NEVER returned to our table 15 minutes after we spoke to her!!!! I shit you not. You cannot make up stuff like this. 

By FAR the worst restaurant I've ever been to. Period.",sAddRs0nwVpFPloZVWq-pw,6,2,1,Ur4vNm4lII3vwjl46Sa_Gw

We always eat at the Southern Highlands location and it has never let us down. We tried this location out and we will never come back. Our menus were falling apart and dirty.... literally the worst looking menus I have ever seen. We asked if we could have ones that weren't all stuck together with food and our waitress gave us these little TOGO ones. Not a great start. We were place all the way in the back of the restaurant and we even asked ""if we do all you can eat you won't forget about us back here will you?"", she laughed and said of course not. Well about 30+minutes after we ordered our FIRST order of sushi, some of it came out. We had to repeatedly ask for chopsticks, and wasabi & ginger, and soy sauce bowls. We quickly ordered our next round and good thing we did because only some of that showed up, about 30 minutes later. We never got all our sushi, even though we repeatedly asked for it. Our desert showed up before our sushi and we asked ""so I guess we are done"" and the waitress had NO clue that we were still waiting on orders. It took her forever to get the check back to us so we approached the manager and he looked SO annoyed to be bothered with a question that we just paid and left.

First, I like to point out the plain question 'how is this place still in business?!??' the staff there is pretty much clueless and completely disorganized. Their GM is this guy with an xtreme Mohawk. He tells people he's the GM but all night I watch him bartender and wait on tables. Most of the staff, including the rude hostess, look like they came off a bad episode of Miami Ink. They were all tattooed and sloppy looking. Not appealing when they have to serve you your food. It doesn't stop there. At the sushi bar, there's a guy that came off the jersey shore to give your plates the finishing touches. With his unwashed hands, he crumbles tempura flakes in your sushi roll. During his shift, I watched him eat and drink and not wash his hands. He does however wipe them on a rag that's used to wipe off the counters with. He carries on like it's no big deal. Health department? 

This place has such a great potential to be something good. But the poorly trained and unappealable staff makes this place a nightmare. The health department needs to come here because there is nothing sanitary about it. 

Oh, about the food. I ordered a seaweed salad and when it came out, half of it was frozen and looked like rocks. I asked the server to take it back and he apologized to me and said that ""I just got it out of the freezer so it didn't have time to thaw."" 

Happy eating folks. If you do go here, have just a drink because at least you know it came from a bottle and no one touched it while he was eating.",hgGRHZsGPPoVD3JXBwEr6Q,3,0,1,d57A2RsHVsmqqwMmevLlbw

Xtremely slow.
Xtremely rude.

This place isn't called ""Xtreme"" for nothing! A few girlfriends and I settled for this 2nd string quarterback because the Heisman winner, Goyemon, was running a 2-hour long wait that night. None of us were that hungry so we didn't want to do AYCE, choosing instead to opt for a la carte choices. Everyone else ordered rolls which came out first while I waited for my hot item to come out from the kitchen. And waited. And waited. By the time everyone else around me finished, my order still hadn't arrived so I told the server to cancel my order, and she seemed completely unaware that I had even had anything to begin with. 

The whole time I was debating whether or not to say anything to management, and when I finally mustered up the courage to do so, it seemed only logical that the Jersey Shore character expediting at the sushi bar would be the one I'd need to talk to, since his face was the one plastered in celebrity photos throughout the restaurant. As I started to talk about my frustrations about the service, he waved me off and said I'd need to speak to the manager who was that other guy tinkering around some bar in the back that wasn't even occupied. Okaaay. 

So we did, and as I was mid-sentence, the manager actually turned and walked away for me. What does this mean? Are we done here? Because I didn't think we were! He came back with his card, and wrote on the back that next time we came in, I'd have 50% off my tab, apologizing and adding that unfortunately they only had one cook scheduled in the back kitchen to accommodate hot orders. 1 cook on a Friday!? There are too many things I could say about this lack of common sense so I need to cut myself off now.",v6oGFvXjuJ5DMT3pUqMXnw,12,2,1,088OaPviE7Syq5XLgOjNpg

We stood there like ducks until finally she came up to the front. 

We ordered all you can eat sushi....20 minutes pass and NO sign of our food nor any explanation of an extended wait from our server. 10 more minutes pass, and we are brought 3 appetizers that we didn't order. We didn't touch the food until finally our waitress came to the table and explained she ""ordered them for us...enjoy!"" Odd.

I would have appreciated it she was honest with us from the beginning, offered for us to select a complimentary appetizer, and given us an approximate time for our wait. I felt deceived.

Certified regulars of this Palace of Pain, we endured mild mistreatment simply because we became hooked on the food and it's close to the house. We came here on 11-26, my birthday!, for a nice meal before heading to the bar. We should have known from the clueless hostess who we asked twice for outdoor seating, then led us to an indoor booth. Finally when we said, ""can we not sit outside for some reason?"" a different hostess replied, ""Oh, sure we can set that up."" Hmm...

Since we weren't starving and had some drinkin' to do at the next location we didn't all do the AYCE, just ordered random rolls. An hour later (60 full minutes) members of our party hadn't received the first rolls they ordered. Second and third orders arrived and we reminded the server we were still waiting on some of the first items ordered, which she said she'd check on. Twice. How does that work? If I took a number at a deli, say 23, and 42 got his food next....there's a problem. Simple math. The place was busy but nothing warrants that kind of service. After a third time of asking where the missing rolls were, while exhibiting some visible displeasure, the waitress did bring some ""free"" sake but no rolls (the price being our sanity). When they finally did arrive, basically when we had our coats on to leave, we sent them back, completely tired of waiting and being treated like sake drinking children.

The final chapter? When a member of our party calmly spoke with the owner, who self importantly posts himself up at the sushi bar, apparently watching orders not be made, this man had the nerve to argue that we had only been waiting 30 minutes. 1. What owner argues with a customer? 2. Even THAT amount of time is ridiculous for one roll!!!

Kobe beef burger is included on AYCE.Need i say more?

must try: the krispy kristy. crispy rice square w/special sauce w/asparagus and crab.

the interior has a modern feel, very clean and staff are very friendly

had to deduct 1 star because they have changed some rules: there is a time limit(but they don't require you to finish your food), only 1 dessert per person and.. the pacquiao roll(no rice, just raw fish in soy paper) is no longer a part of the sushi buffet.",7MLxbXcn0kSbhIpjasvhIQ,1,0,4,m7w7SmY6jeMGe6CjwGdS9Q

Now, I've never been THAT impressed with the place, but two days ago, my buddy convinced me to go sit at the sushi bar with him and enjoy their happy hour - which is awesome to have on a Saturday. I got the sashimi, and they gave me an awesome portion. The drinks were solid, and we sat and watched a game while eating sushi, drinking sake, and watching the chefs do their thing. I wish I knew the name of the chef in charge, because he was awesome and directing those he was working with.

It is very new and they were still finalizing some of the outdoor heating on the patio. The location is great and I especially liked the roll-up door that provides a sushi bar for the patio. 

I think the servers are new to working in a sushi restaurant but they were friendly and provided good customer service. If you have been to a sushi restaurant and know what you like or want you shouldn't have any problems. 

They have a very nice decor inside with a large wine room behind glass, along with additional seating further back in the restaurant. We sat up at the sushi bar enjoying a nice afternoon view. They had similar variety of rolls and appetizers you can find at many of the sushi restaurants, along with a few I had not heard of or had before. 

The sushi chefs working at the time of my visit were very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. We were given a complimentary Hamachi salad to try. I found a new favorite roll which was the Yoshi Dynamite. With our mochi dessert our server included a half sample of red bean to try. 

We left totally full and very satisfied. Their AYCE lunch was $19.95 and I thought was a great deal, considering how much I ate.

I went with my husband, a friend and together we had 3 toddlers with us. I was a little apprehensive at first, as previous Yelpers had reviewed the service as slow and I was worried about bringing the kids there on a busy Saturday night.

We went at 5:00 PM in order to feed the kids early and get a head start before the crowds. We were seated right away and instantly fed complimentary bowls of miso soup and our drinks were brought right over. We ordered for the kids first in order to get their food expedited.

The three adults went with the AYCE option and it was worth it! If you eat 2 or more rolls, order edamame and an appetizer, the deal is totally worth it!

The edamame came out first and was fresh and delicious. The kids meals came out next and each was delicious (we tried the Japanese chicken nuggets (really good, nothing like what you'd think of from fast food places), combination fried rice and a chicken bowl with rice. The kids (aged 4, 4 and 2) devoured their food. 

Our rolls took longer than I'd hoped. If it had just been adults, the conversation would have kept us busy but the kids were getting antsy. The rolls were fresh and delicious as were the baked green mussels. We tried several different rolls and all were delicious. The Tiger Roll was exceptionally incredible, as was roll with spicy scallop combined with spicy crab.

 At one point a server brought us 2 rolls that we didn't order. He said, ""these are complimentary"". Apparently another couple had ordered them and got sick of waiting (again, the wait time is a downer) and left. We were given their rolls.

I have to give the staff kudos. They were very patient with us and catered to the kids. My two-year old had a meltdown (we were waiting for our first round of rolls and she started to get tired. She ended up having a tantrum on the floor of the restaurant). The server raced over with full coloring books and crayons for all the kids and was very sympathetic when we said we needed to leave. We thought we might get charged as we had only finished half our meal. She just packed it all in to-go boxes and we were on our way.

As we left, the lobby, lounge and sushi bar were full and we ran into some friends who were told that the wait was now one hour. (This was at 7:00 PM).

So all in all, I recommend the place, but don't bring kids as the food is slow to come out. If you are really hungry, arrive early if you want to be seated right away. I'll definitely try it again as a date night or girls night out stop.",SgEtYp0N1P6ar6uKbGJCiA,3,3,4,OmL3aziRtG3D1lAoCgL9Qw

The food was not good quality, it was messy and the rolls were not tightly wrapped so they basically fell apart while I was trying to eat them.

When I decided to give it another chance, it was equally disappointing.  The waiter was overbearing and a little too comfortable - not professional to say the least. 

It was overpriced and just had a strange vibe.  Then I read recently that Xtreme Sushi earned a C grade with 40 demerits, one short of closure, after inspectors found spoiled food, no hand washing and food stored at the wrong temperature during a routine inspection on June 20.

The guy at the front was incredibly annoying and extremely dumb/creepy. Our server was a complete joke of a server. She had no idea what anything was... At all. She told me that the Specialty Rolls were also included in AYCE (All You Can Eat) even though it said they weren't on the menu. With that being said I asked her about the ""Steroid Roll"" (which only came with 2 pieces) and she claimed that it was a pretty big roll but it wasn't that much bigger than a standard ""Xtreme Roll."" With that being said, I ordered it. Well, the roll was MASSIVE. Literally, MASSIVE. It came with two pieces and they were each about 2 pounds of sushi. It was so big a lady across from us thought it was some type of cake/dessert. It was so much food wrapped up into a roll that it grossed me out. The server then came back and when I told her that the roll was way too big and that she should've told me that this roll was going to be my entire meal, all she and the moron up front had to say was ""Well, we're not called XTREME for nothing,"" and proceeded to laugh together. It was the biggest joke of service I have ever encountered. Overall, I'll say that the food for the most part is sub-par. They do use way too much rice on their rolls and everything seems like it's done half-assed. The service on the other hand, is flat out atrocious. Half of the staff don't even have matching uniforms (even McDonald's has that) and they really don't know what they're doing.

Unfortunately, we were sad to find out that a new management has taken over.  They have refocus their attention from an AYCE Sushi establishment to a half ""Tapas""/half AYCE sushi type of restaurant.  Not quite sure the mix.

First thing we noticed is that the menu had totally changed.  In fact, the number and types of sushi is less than a 1/4 of what was originally offered.  In addition, there no longer are crabs, mussells, oysters, and other ""favorite dishes"" as part of the AYCE or on the menu.  Even though there were limited selections, we decided to give it a try.  Well, we were rather disappointed.  Wow, all I can say is that the quality has gone downhill.  The fresh high quality fish have been replaced with something that is pretty bad.  This reminds of the commercial where some guy orders sush from a gas station... Enough said.  Everything is drenched in some eel sauce, orange sauce, or whatever to cover and hide the quality of the dish.  It was soggy and just crap.  The rice was just plain awful.

The only thing that we enjoyed was the dessert.  The tempura strawberry, vanilla, and green tea was very good.

As for service, it was great at the beginning.  However, as the dinner wore on, the service got noticeably slow.  And, we had to ask the bus boys to track our waittress down.  This should have been a no no.  In addition, a couple orders that we did not make arrived at our table.  And, we notice other tables experiencing the same issues.  Whatever... 

Management seems to be very nice.  The manager stopped by to ensure that our requests were met.  However, no matter how nice you are, the food still dictates the quality of the restaurant.  And, it determines whether we would continue to return here.

Overall, I give this restaurant under new management 9/13/2013 the following ratings:

AYCE Sushi - 1 star or D-
Dessert - 4 star or B+
Service - 3 star or C

Based on this experience, we would be extremely hesitant to return.  There are so many better quality Sushi restaurants in Las Vegas (i.e. Sushi Mon).

Hamachi was not fresh & was a few small pieces of it on rice that was huge. Also ordered Albacore, scallop, tuna, unagi & a roll. Overall was not impressed with the place. The water tastes gross - they need to do something about the disgusting taste. The cases where the fish was kept on the bar seemed dirty as well especially on the tops inside the case. They were washing some kind of bean sprout while were were sitting there & it smelled horrible like a really rancid fart.

Some one told me long ago, ""You get what you pay for."" There are many other streets in Las Vegas and I would suggest that reviewer visit them.
We walked into Xtreme Sushi on 01-22-14 and there was no one there to greet us. We walked around the corner and the sushi chef said he would call someone for us. The place was empty so I am not sure where everyone was or what they were doing. The man who would be our waiter, failing to ask if we wanted to sit at the sushi bar, sat us in a room with a bar and a couple televisions on and some current music blaring. The bar top had several cases for alcohol strewn about and a half full carafe of water that remained in place for the duration of our stay.
I understand this is the young and hip generation but to answer a customers question with ""Yeah"" seems a bit casual to me. Yet this IS Xtreme Sushi I suppose.
In all fairness the rolls were just ok. The tea was served in a sticky coffee mug. Once I can forgive maybe but when I asked for more they brought a second mug which was also sticky. I give an 'F' for presentation. Along with presentation, and at the risk of sounding racist, I would suggest a sushi place hire some Asians. Our server and his assistant were both Caucasian and the sushi chef looked Hispanic.

1734785,2011-04-04,3,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"I had decided to try this place out since I had purchased a Groupon deal for this location.

The place had the potential to be good - it's in a great location and the interior decor and atmosphere were attractive.  There was about a half hour wait when I first arrived, which was understandable considering it was a Friday night, so I didn't mind waiting.

We were then seated in a corner near the sushi bar.  We were attended to promptly by a seemingly friendly waitress.  I was able to use my Groupon on the all-you-can-eat price, so that was a plus.  Well, that was where the niceties ended.  We ordered five rolls to begin with: Dragon, Rainbow, Volcano, Kate's K, and Double S.  Well, we waited at least a half hour to get our first roll and that was only after I had caught the attention of the hostess.  When she brought out our first roll, she called it the Japanese Lasagna, which was not one we ordered.  Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I decided maybe she mistook it for the Volcano (as they are pretty similar), yet I noted that there in fact was cream cheese in the roll - making it more likely that it was indeed a Japanese Lasagna.  I refused to eat it, as that is purposely why I do not order rolls with cream cheese, but since my brother likes that roll anyway, he proceeded to eat it.  This is also after we had to ask for place settings.  When our waitress FINALLY showed up again, I let her know that we had not ordered the roll and she proceeded to ARGUE with me about how it was in fact the Volcano and not the Japanese Lasagna.  I'm sorry, but A) it had cream cheese, and B) even if I were wrong, I thought it was poor customer service to argue instead of just bringing me a new roll.  I let her know that either way, it was the only roll we had received out of our five in about an hour that we had been there, so what was the deal?  She then brought us some more rolls and I refused to believe that any of them were correct, except the Dragon.  The avocado in all of our rolls was nowhere to be seen.  The best part was that five rolls later and I had never received my Rainbow, which further proved my point that the first roll was erroneous.  So, when the waitress asked if we wanted anything else, I ordered the Rainbow again and that's when she asked ""Oh, did you not receive your first order of the Rainbow roll?""  Duh.  She never once apologized and just brought us the roll. 

This was seriously one of the worst sushi experiences I have ever had.  I was glad I had received half off due to the Groupon I used, but I would never go to this place again, even if it were free.  I would have given it zero stars if I could.",6N8scdRhsaGLZxvqriE7iw,1,0,1,NBv90-7H6XMDWA21Gc8obQ

The rice is not even close to sushi quality the fish is not fresh the service well there is none. It would be nice to get a drink before you are half way done with your meal!  When you pay 30 bucks for all you can eat you would like to order what you like but some guy in street clothes kept bringing over half rolls from other peoples half orders for me to finish. Trust me on this one there are plenty more sushi restaurants on Eastern that will blow this place away even if they dont have a outdoor patio looking at a parking lot.

Where to begin? Here it goes... We went as a party of 4 adults:

Even though the restaurant was quite empty, there was a little bit of a wait.. & we were seated down the hallway, RIGHT NEXT to the only other table (with 3 crying children), in the room. 

I get it, children will cry. When we sat down, we could feel the kids pushing on the back of the booth seat, repeatedly; so we had to politely move one booth away..

The music was not at a dining level, I could have sworn we were at a Jay-Z concert! We couldn't even hear each other speak across the table... lots of lip-reading.

The service, overall, was mediocre... at best. 

The water served was like drinking pool water!! I had to order lemon to try to mask the nasty chlorine flavor.. One of us asked a man what beer was served.. he looked at her like a deer in headlights & said he send the server right over.. but no such thing happened.

Three of us ordered ""all-you-can-eat sushi""-- & one (not a sushi fan) ordered a few appetizers, as her meal. The waitress brought the appetizers, along with ONE small dish of some ginger & old dried up wasabi the size of the tip of my thumb. (For the three of us!?, you're too generous!) Absurd!

After we put our first order in, we waited 15-20 minutes(!) for just 3 rolls to be made. By that time the ""crying kids table"" left & they had seated another couple with a crying kid RIGHT NEXT to us, AGAIN-- after explaining why we had moved over! We should have left when we had the chance.

The sushi was dis-gust-ing. In other words--revolting, repulsive, off-putting, unpalatable, foul, nasty, vomitus.. Take your pick. NOT FRESH IN THE SLIGHTEST. The ""tempura"" shrimp was cold & soggy. The tuna, warm & mushy!! Gross! The presentation was even horrible. 

Had to ""fish"" other tables for napkins, ask for wasabi & ginger for EACH of us that ordered sushi, not to mention- when we told our server our second order, (5 rolls) she didn't write any of it down, & guess what?! Just 4 rolls came out to the table! We took that as a blessing...
 
Couldn't believe they had ""Best sushi in Las Vegas"" printed on their menu! Someone needs to take a permanent marker & fix that, they spelled ""WORST"" wrong. 

$80 down the drain, should have gone to In-N-Out! 

... & for those ""compliments"" by people who think we ""should have complained"" & think I ""must be such an awful person"" to write my opinion & experience ...  Mentioning this to a manager was not worth my breath, that's what YELP is for, duh. I've been in the hostess/ server/ restaurant/ customer service business.. The etiquette-it's pretty simple!!

Simply put, NEVER AGAIN.. ever.",w6r0sLbhuHrNTPgrZlbFdw,13,1,1,obdoOhBKPlSGkzXAzvgw6w

Waitresses were night club uniform at sure enough brought our drinks out quick, but when it came to ordering, our waitress acted like she understood our orders, but obviously when our first trays came out, everything was wrong!! Two different specialty rolls were plainly laid out on one tray, our order of 3 dozen mix nigiri only showed up as 4 pairs. And only half our orders of appetizers showed up little by little after waiting over an hour. Our waitress never asked or refilled our drinks but had the nerve to ask if we wanted to order more... By then we were quite upset and losing our appetite, we actually had to repeat our first order to her because we never received half of it yet.

Bad service. Overcooked fish. Too much sauce on everything.

One story: We came for AYCE sushi during our lunch break. At the end of the meal I decided to cleanse my palette with tamago. The girl came back with TOBIKO. I informed her that a mistake was made. She continued to tell me that what was in front of me was TAMAGO. Patiently, I explained that tobiko and masago were both fish eggs and that tamago is essentially scrambled egg with sweet seasoning. She continued to defend her point until I Googled ""tamago"". 5-8 minutes later the waitress apologized and I didn't get my tamago....",WJtYhMtC279hbQz5rOznug,5,1,2,R41Q7_o6M9v8-hUaCBsjHA

I'm a bit of a sushi snob. I know people say that, but I'm quite picky. I mock people who make some idiotic paste out of wasabi and soy sauce. Seriously, you shouldn't need much of either let alone some vat of paste. I'm also not one for mayonaise laced rolls or fried fish. Boring. Anyhow...

I've been here twice now with last night being my second visit in less than a month. Here are some of my problems
(1) No specials. Seriously, you can't at least try to come up with something new and interesting? No live shrimp? Nothing? Seems lazy to me.
(2) No drink menu. I don't need you to make up silly martini's but I would like to know what sakes you carry. I was actually thinking I wanted a nicer bottle last night but gave up and went with a second bottle of sparkling.
(3) Service. Second time that the service was slow and just outright bad. The first time the server was kinda dumb. I was very specific on what I wanted and she brought me a roll that I had to send back and I NEVER send back food. 
(4) Ridiculous roll selection. I am so over these stupid places that offer so many rolls that it become overwhelming and most of which are just fried, saucy crap. Why people order these I don't know.
(5) Hostess in hot pants. Seriously folks, this isn't a strip joint. I don't want to walk in the door to some chic with pants up to her ass. It's demeaning to her and offensive to me. You aren't that cool or trendy either. Get over yourself management.

2154914,2011-06-06,0,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"I went here for lunch this past Saturday for some mini-graduation celebration with the parents.  It leaves a lot to be desired.

While the layout is unique (different eating areas for privacy), it also makes this restaurant feel cramped.  One interesting piece is the Kids' Area in the back with 2 Xbox 360s and a PS3 set up on some dining tables.  Umm, different, but I appreciate the effort?

The décor is pretty nice, a little too upscale for what this place is at times, but still pleasing.  So why are the menus printed out (parts of it cut off), folded, and not even laminated?  Hmm... The drink menus sure do have a nice leather menu even if the outside is never cleaned and make you want to pick it up with a napkin.

So okay, whatever, we sit down and it is kind of dark.  I had to unfold my paper menu (lol) and tilt it up to get a strip of natural light to read it.  The waitress did not really seem to be all there but I think she was used to the night shift (she had on a cheetah-print corset and some spandex-looking pants).  We order, food is overpriced for the quality as well as slow to come out.  I got the Dragon Roll (hard to screw up IMO), my mom got the tempura shrimp (average) and my dad go the sashimi plate (presentation was nice).  The host (yes, male) had to refill our drinks.  Kinda sucks because this place is close to where I live and has $19.99 AYCE sushi (sans steak & sashimi) for lunch.  The sushi is definitely not TERRIBLE but definitely nothing to go out of your way for.  Also, I only tried one roll.  I gave it two stars based on that.

If you are coming to get drunk and have mediocre sushi but can't quite afford or feel like driving to the strip, I guess this is OK.  I will (read: have to) come back to use my Groupon I bought awhile ago... But hey, it's down the street.",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,2,0,2,u6FGEAWYwnfP9UaEs-JnrA

I don't understand why the servers don't know what they're serving!  They should come in early one day and have them see what they serve.  Either they have the sushi chef show them what they're serving or at least have pictures of what they have.  The server was giving me the names of the sushi I ordered and she was giving the wrong name for each one.  Now let's get to the reason why I still gave them a five star rating.

Their sushi are excellent!  At first, the sushis were not tightly made so they were falling apart when you picked them up.  Now, they're rolled well and tastes so damn good!  We actually ordered the AYCE this time and we took advatage of it.  You can order the whole menu but the steaks, lobsters, and sashimi.  It was a nice change from the timed, limited choices from other sushi places.  We ordered our fill of sushi and then came dessert.  I got the tempura battered ice cream.  One word can describe the delicacy: YUM!

I went to this place for lunch yesterday with BF and we did the AYCE. Sat in the bar area in a booth cuz the bar was too crowded. The rest of the place was empty from what I saw in the back. Started with pot stickers and calamari and they mentioned there was a party of 9 in the back holding orders up so it would be a small wait..no problem. Pot stickers were really good! Ordered 4 pieces of garlic tuna and bf had  specialty roll...something helmet..It was soft shell crab inside a roll, as well as shrimp tempura. The garlic tuna looked and smelled great, but the texture was rough. Is that possible for raw fish? The tempura shrimp was flimsy...crispy but flimsy. Next I ordered some edamame which they offer salted or with garlic, we did the garlic. I also ordered a philly roll. BF ordered some albacore. After about 15 minutes waiting for the philly roll...asked where it was at, the waitress said it was coming out shortly. He finished his albacore, and ordered garlic tuna, kobe beef burger, and some chicken yakitori. He received the tuna, and kobe beef burger, and I still had not received the philly roll. Really? It's a cold roll, takes 2 minutes to make at Yama and Bluefin!  Asked again...was told, oh, let me check. Different waitress went to check, it got mixed up with the party of 9 apparently and was never made. 30 minutes now..still waiting. Finally it came out in like 2 minutes like it should. To top it off, the salmon was not fresh tasting at all. Put a sour taste in my mouth and I was done eating that day. What a freaking waste of my time. 
My issue was A) the service - asked the waitress numerous times for ice water, never got it. Finally got it on the fifth time asking. B) The bar area was crowded when we arrived, but there were maybe 5 diners total including us when we were leaving. C) If there is a large party dining, I understand things take longer to get out, I get that, but don't consistently blame the large party in the back when I'm seeing the chefs in the front cleaning their stations and prepping new fish for service. D) It seemed like we had 3 waitresses. I'm all for playing the team role and helping out, but when orders are being messed up, and food is not being received, the waitress who placed the order, is not going to know if it was received when the other two are serving the dish and taking the empty/finished dish away. One waitress, one table, one area...seems to work better. Maybe the original waitress I placed the order with did not know if I had received my food because the other two were clearing our plates. 
I guess this place is great if you want other food included in the AYCE price, but the sushi is not as fresh as I've had from Yama or Blue Fin. I'll stick to those two places thank you very much!",48Ip5iJtWNvxo9QrdX07Og,1,0,2,hhIUAX89UWvsuJFhvxb0oA

I recently moved to the Las Vegas area and have been here three times, and each time it was great! 
I have tried various sushi places around, but this one is for sure my favorite.
Every time, I have ordered the all you can eat. The service has always been great as well, one server in particular was awesome.. although I forgot her name (she had tattoos and piercings) She was fantastic and super sweet, she gave awesome recommendations as well. She was super attentive at bringing us out more sake, water, and checking in on us plenty for when we were ready to order more rolls. Even the busboy was friendly, chatting with us, and asking if we needed anything else.
The food has been my favorite of any sushi place. The poke salad was delicious, veggie tempura was cooked perfectly (sometimes I've noticed that certain places don't cook the sweet potato all the way, it's awful eating it when it's hard as a rock) it was great here. I've tried various sushi rolls each time, but my favorite for sure is the lasagna roll. Yes, I know it's more of an ""amercanized"" roll, but I love the different textures and flavors that it packs, all in one bite. Even with more traditional rolls, they have all been yummy!

In order to have excellent nigiri sushi you need to have excellent rice. Undercooked cold rice doesn't cut it. The fish is frozen which is fine because its an all you can eat but why does salmon nigiri look different then salmon in the rolls? Almost looks like it had freezer burn. When I mentioned that I was waiting for my x-treme orgasm (sashimi salad) after 35mins, the response I got was ""don't worry, its still coming"" unfortunately the lumpia never made it out at all. Having educated servers would be a big plus, when you order tamago and then say egg sushi to simplify and the server replies ""oooohhh I always thought that was a piece of cheese"" my confidence in the experience definitely doesn't grow. On top of that why does the tamago at xtreme sushi Southern Highlands look and taste completely different than the tamago here? Nothing makes sense at all.

Overall the food is edible but below average, service is slow and mistake laden with below average product knowledge. They should probably burn this down and collect the insurance money, stick to the quality version in Southern Highlands.",XHyjpxiGpL_0m4snbBfOKQ,1,0,2,fHoFfea6ewn-PXncOg9C1A

Cool atmosphere with the outdoor seating area.

Service (for some reason) is still hit and miss.  

Soup is automatically brought to the table when you sit down.  Personally, I'd like to be asked first if I would like soup; I feel bad telling him/her no thanks after they bring it over.  

The chefs are very friendly, greeting you when you arrive and thanking you for coming in when you're leaving.  Nice touch.

Then tried to get other patrons involved. Little did he know that my friend was a sushi chef for 4 years. The waitress went to the back and tried the rice, and when she came back she asked us if it was acetone we were tasting? Then she proceeded to charge us extra because we did not eat it.

2909545,2011-03-16,5,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"Wow. Where to begin.

My husband and I decided to check this place out on a Sunday afternoon as it has been open for about 5 months. It took over the pre-exsisting Melting Pot location.  The restaurant was confusing the moment you walked up to the door.

Posted on the pillar at the entrance of the property is a sign telling you it's open seating and to just find a spot. Inside there are white leather couches parked in front of a big screen television that was blaring sports. Outside you can choose to sit on the pation or at the sushi bar. I didn't realize there were actual booths to sit in until having to use the restroom which would make this open seating thing even more confusing. The property is very big so it's maze like in it's layout. I couldn't imagine how long one would wait if they chose booths in the back of the restaurant as we waited forever sitting right in front of the sushi bar! 

Once we sat down, there were dirty dishes stacked up at the end of the sushi bar. The sushi chef was friendly enough and greeted us but that was it. We sat for several minutes and had to ask to get drinks and had to ask for a menu. Which was a poorly printed paper fold-up menu. Weird.  He didn't seem to know who to get and didn't offer any information about the new place i.e. this is our specialty. The service all around was inconsistant, confusing, and slow. We had 3 different people coming and going and we had to grab whoever was passing to order or get more drinks. When the waitress  (in their awful awful ill-fitting-out-of-place corsetts) finallly showed up, she greeted us with her pad  and pen and ""what can I get you"". Personality of a glass of water. Which we were not given either. Couldn't offer any suggestions for drinks or specialties of the house,  My husband and I looked at each other because it was as if we were a bother to the staff there. We started with edammame, he with spicy tuna roll , vodka tonic, and an ""Asian Pear-suasion"" cocktail.  I told her I needed a moment to look at the menu but we would start with that.  My husband's vodka tonic came out, then his spicy tuna rolls. He was done with BOTH before I even had edamme. I asked the sushi chef 3 times if it was coming or if he knew that status of my cocktail!  ""it's coming"" was the only response I could get.  Needless to say, the edammame came about 10 minutes after my husband had already finished his rolls and the drink about 5 minutes after that. Ridiculous!  The rolls were very good he said although not sure if good enough to tolerate the service again. The cocktail was a little heavy and not as ""pear-like"" as I expected. Wouldn't order it again. 

When we were ready to order more, we had to grab the manager passing by to get an order in.  For most of the time, he stayed at the end of the bar chit-chatting with employees and occasionally taking food out.  I guess he didn't notice all of the people looking around hopeful to get some service. He started to chit chat with us about service during the week and how much he drinks at night at work. About how when people complain he just tells them to have another cocktail! Yikes.

By the time we left, we were over the whole place. The terrible and confusing, inconisistant service, over-priced food, and dark, depressing enviroment.  You can go almost anywhere else and get it better, faster, and great service. As we walked out, the manager was sprawled out laying on the couch watching tv.",zoosTCy_K4bR_W28L6CciA,1,1,1,1YqpGu8Jh5fXwmYuE_4Zlw

It was actually the food my kids ordered that was pretty bad. They both ordered a teriyaki chicken combo meal and the teriyaki sauce was extremely sweet. It's like they took 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce and added 1 cup of sugar to it. Also, the prices for the rolls were really pricey, compared to other sushi restaurants.

2980809,2011-09-30,1,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"We wanted to try a new sushi spot. And through word of mouth, we stumbled upon here. We came in with no reservations, pressing our luck. Luck was on our side because we got seated immediately.

They had a list of alcohol they served here, we were in the mood for just wine though. My boyfriend enlisted the help of our waitress for suggestions and of course she said ""they're all very good but I like the little black dress"". It was the cheapest one they had, my boyfriend felt a little fancier and wanted something more pricey, so we asked her what she thought of this wine and that wine. She was honest and said ""Oh, I don't know. I'm sure it's good but I've onIy only had the LBD, I can't afford to try anything else"", lol. That made us laugh. So after we settled on our wine option, we ordered. I opted for the AYCE and my boyfriend just ordered udon noodles. I wasn't too impressed with their food, their sushi rolls didn't live up to it's name but they offered half rolls, so that was a lot better. Certain fish weren't fresh. Their AYCE is pretty open though, there's udon and rice plates included. I'm much more of an appetizer and raw fish only kind of person.

I'm not sure I'd be back, I've had better sushi elsewhere. Only thing I'd say, I got better service here, although plates sat on my trouble for a while. Our waitress always smiled and was kind, even when I had hesitations about my order.

enter the restaurant and we were told that there was a wait, we said that was fine and we would just wait at the bar.  the three of us sit at the bar and watch the guy behind the bar talking and drinking with a customer, he NOT ONCE even acknowledged our existence.  This went on for about 10 minutes, even when another party of four more people sat at the bar.  finally a girl came behind the bar and i asked her if we could order from her, and we finally got our ridiculously overpriced sake (more than double what you would pay at most sushi places).  we then were seated and given soup while browsing the cheap paper menu's tri-folded on cheap paper (very classy considering the price for everything).   while looking at the menu the busboy came and took all three of our soups before any of us were near done.  

the waitress was nice, but you could tell she was new and a little overwhelmed.  we ordered several rolls and an appetizer and after waiting for more than 30 minutes we asked to talk to a manager.  a woman came over and i told her about the experience from the time we walked into the door and she just stared at me like a deer caught in the headlights.  i told her to cancel our food order and she said she needed to ask the owner.  to my horror she indicated the owner was the douche bag behind the bar that didn't acknowledge any of the patrons that are paying his overhead cause he was too busy drinking and trying to pick up a girl.  UNBELIEVABLE!  i asked the manager to just send the owner over, but he refused to come to my table.  i refused at that time to pay.  

on my way out i confronted the owner, he was demeaning and rude beyond words.  i told him that i couldn't believe he didn't help or even say a word to us when we sat at the bar and his response was ""i'm not a bartender, i'm the owner"".  the whole time i was talking he kept trying to talk past me to the man in our group, you could tell that this foreign excuse of a man considers himself not only above serving a drink or saying hello to a customer, but also being talked to by a woman.   

i cannot wait for the day his business shuts down, and we have all bet money on the month that it does, it's just a matter of time.  

until then, sorry i could give you no review of the food as it never came out.  i can tell you though the prices do not justify the service, and the owner is a complete disgusting greasy ass.   head up the street and go to i love sushi, it never disappoints.",IUeBuSW5NDaup7hqcdfZNQ,16,1,1,t3Vq5uZWs-5ahIjNhjVyRg

First the good: Service was really good, and ambiance was nice with cool outdoor bar, tvs to catch the game, and a kind of lounge-y vibe. But the sushi was dry and chewy, and there was NO presentation - just 2 sushi pieces on a huge plain white plate. It was not very fresh and the Japanese ""chef"" who served me seemed uninterested in the sushi he served and obviously took NO PRIDE in what he was presenting. The pictures do NOT represent the presentation that I received.

I had uni & yellowtail and a yellow tail hand roll. The sushi ""chef"" asked me if I wanted anything in it? Really?! Did this guy know anything about making sushi??? I said: ""Sure. Surprise me. Make something nice."" I get the cone-style hand roll with 2 thin slices of yellow-tail accompanied by 2 slices of cucumber and rice. That's something special??? Bland and uninteresting. The fired soft-shell crab was very small and a bit over cooked, but edible.

Then the kicker: As I'm sitting there waiting for my server to return (with my check- she had kind of disappeared), I was watching this other chef (head chef? he had a white coat - bad sushi ""chef"" had grey coat) pulling stuff out of the sushi display counter and one of the containers of fish fell to the floor. I watched and waited to see what he'd do, and he PUT IT BACK IN THE COOLER to be served again! I was appalled! I'm thinking I need to call the Health inspector! Add to that, the sushi bar doesn't have covers on the back side of the fish storage counters (which may explain why my pieces of sushi had dry spots on them).

I always order a rainbow roll first to get warmed up and the California roll part was sooo disgusting. The crab mayo mix had more mayo then crab and the rice tasted old. It honestly reminded me of grocery store sushi. For my second roll I decided to show the chef a picture of a roll from yelp and said, ""What is this? Can I have this one"". I thought that showing the guy a yelp photo would make him think I was serious about my fish. He definitely didn't even attempt to give me something similar to the photo. I ate it anyways, I was starving. I decided after that to ditch the specialty rolls and just eat sushi until I had at least had my moneys worth. Our server then came up and offered us some dessert. We said yes ordered and asked for the check as well. I'm not one to overly exaggerate so it was about 15 minutes before we saw her again. With only one dessert and no check.

It's different and interesting and worth a try... the service seems a bit lacking- like the servers are still learning. When we ordered ""Flying Fish"" out of pure curiosity, our server failed to tell us it was Flying Fish Roe- totally different!! Why even have it listed wrong on the menu? So it wasn't the fish- it was the eggs and it wasn't good... I'm not an amazing sushi connoisseur- so I wouldn't know if flying fish is only served as eggs!

Came in here with a party of 20 for my girlfriends birthday and was sat in one of the back rooms. we pretty much took up the entire room. We were all told we all had to do either AYCE or order off the menu individually. a few of us didn't want to eat but since we were being forced we all chose AYCE. my boyfriend and I ordered 4 rolls and a large sake. after about 30 minutes of not receiving either (a few friends still hadn't received their orders either at this time) we went to the bar to grab our sake. there was no bartender so we stood there for about 5 minutes and finally someone came up. we told her about the sake and supposedly the waitress never put in the order so we bought a large sake at the bar. the sake bottle looked pretty small but we took it anyways. come to find out she gave us a small sake bottle instead of the large that we paid for. when we brought this to our waitresses attention she ROLLED HER EYES and walked away... dude wtf. she never retuned with our right sake and she never returned with our food. when we asked her where our sushi was, this is what she had to say. ""Listen there are 20 of you, if you know anything about the service industry you would understand this is a challenge"" I honestly was so shocked this left me speechless. Myself and 3 other friends never received a roll, and when we got the bill she had added auto gratuity. I have never in my life asked for a auto grat to be taken off but this was an exception. i asked her too and she said she couldnt, the computer didnt ""work that way"" when i advised her I am a bar manager and i know damn well its against the law to force someone to tip you she walked into the back and never returned. we paid our bill (the large hot sake we originlly ordered was on the bill also btw) and left. When i got home i called to speak to a manager becuase i was FUMING. we were told there was no manager present.

3391570,2014-05-07,0,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"Zooooweeee! so many poor reviews!
I've seen this place for years and we finally gave it a try today, didn't check on Yelp before coming here so we came in not knowing anything about the place.
We step inside and first impression was  a bit perplexing. There is some kind of wine display in a window on the left then then you go in further and there is like leather lounge furniture that kind of makes it look like a nightclub or lounge bar. There is a sushi bar on the right and the place looks modern and not like a traditional sushi restaurant. We follow our ""host"" which turned out to be our waiter, will have to say he didn't really give a welcoming impression, but we followed him to the left down a dark hallway, then to our booth where it's cozy and kind of dark. We've never dined in a place like this before, a little dark and loud music that I didn't care for at first, but later changed into music we liked (traditional Rock), it started out hip hop, but later mixed into other blends of music so we welcomed the subtle changes. Out ""host"" said someone would be right with us to take our drink order, but it turned out he became our waiter. Once again I will say he was very efficient, but not really relaxed, more like uptight for some reason. We were in on a tuesday and around 5:30 so not quite full on dinner time. We both wanted the All you can eat plan and picked several items that looked interesting. Our waiter didn't write down the order, but did repeat what we requested before he put in our order so at this point we felt we were in good hands. We got a roll that was like a tongue twister, something like ""moisty poystie deliciousty"", and ""Russian Missle"" (found the name amusing), ""Tuna Tower"" , ""Chihuahua Poke"" and others that  I can't remember at this moment, but there was a really good if not too complex selection of sushi items. I really like Japanese curry and almost ordered it with either noodles or rice, but never got around to it because the sushi kept me perfectly occupied! 
First of all, I don't know the history of this restaurant. I know it's been here a while, but the banner above the place says ""Under New Management"". Here is the best part, the Sushi was A #1! Every bite was very fresh and flavorful. We can't stand the various Ponsu, Eel or whatever kinds of sauce most places put on sushi and often request they not put it on. (Sometimes they remember, sometimes they forget) The various sauces that were on the sushi and decorating the plates were absolutely perfect! None were overpowering or too salty, flavor profile in the sauces were perfect and the best we've ever tasted. I know that sushi rice is a very important component of the sushi experience and in this case I could actually taste the separation of the rice and the fish. The rice was perfect and subtle seasoning made it spot on. I can actually taste what sushi is all about with every plate that was presented to us, each item hit the mark as far as both me and my wife's tastes was concerned. We LOVED the sushi here and although the service was kind of on the cold side the waiter was very efficient and we never really lacked anything. Yeah, the ginger and wasabi portion was Xtremely stingy, but we didn't really need more since the food didn't require much help in the taste department.
I am still kind of surprised at the negative reviews everyone is leaving on here, but in our case we can't find much to fault here. Maybe diners are coming at peak times and the staff is overwhelmed because they are short staffed? Under stress, waiters can be overwhelmed and not be on their ""A"" game. I am hoping we came to Xtreme Sushi on a turning point in food quality and service. We will dine here again for sure and we hope the future visits won't let us down. We are always looking for a good place for sushi, but because of inconsistent preparation or other factors we continue to search like we did today, but in our first try here, it was Xtremely Awesome!",rn2DB_YX0BvToYe50RNr_Q,1,1,4,SxQlIO1ubyO9PvlrE2AZ5Q

I had visited the location in Southern Highlands, and I wanted to like this place just because! My first experience here, however, will definitely ensure that I will NEVER EVER return here, no matter what occasion.

This has to be one of the toughest reviews for me to write because there are so many things that went wrong during our time there. Now, I am taking into consideration the fact that it is a new restaurant and some of these employees may have never worked in a restaurant before, so please do not think I am being too critical. In fact, I've worked at 2 completely new restaurants, too, so I know how it goes.
My boyfriend and I arrived at about 1:30pm. We got seated in small section of booths. Our waitress, Tatjana, came over and introduced herself as well as the menu. She was extremely cute and friendly, and was quick to get our water and take our initial orders for our AYCE. 

We ordered and went straight for the sushi first:
Screaming Orgasm
Amaebi
Albacore
Garlic Tuna
2 Spicy Tuna Hand rolls
Anago 
1/2 Krispy Kristi Roll
1/2 Helmet Crest
+ 2 other half rolls

A few moments after, our Screaming Orgasm came out. It was decent. The sauce seemed a bit bland. We finished it, though & then 2 spicy tuna CUT rolls come out. It was put down on our table even though we had mentioned we didn't order it. During this time, there seemed to be a lot of confusion regarding the table numbers. 3 different people came to our table with wrong orders, MULTIPLE times, but our nigiri came out just in time.

Amaebi - served plain, not the best.
Albacore - I got seared albacore. I ordered PLAIN albacore... & yes there was seared albacore & regular albacore on the menu. I've had MUCH better.
Garlic Tuna - didn't taste like garlic sauce on it! It was closer in taste to ""cajun""
2 spicy tuna hand rolls - never came. We guessed it must be the 2 cut rolls on our table, so we decided we might as well try it. Before, I even chewed it, once I put it on my tongue I could taste the rice. It tasted as if there was soap in the rice. It was a really strong, bad, taste that even overpowered the spicy tuna.
Anago - unlike Unagi, Anago is usually prepared by the actually sushi chefs, not store bought. It was decent, Sushi Factory wins.

We never got our 4 half rolls, even after an 1hr+ of waiting. We waited some more.
The waitress did acknowledge this, so we asked for an order of mussels, and combo tempura, anyway. Hoping to see if ANY of our rolls would come out. Our mussels came, and were probably the tastiest part of our meal. But, as for our other orders, still nothing, and it was already 3pm. 
Our waitress let us know that the kitchen was a little backed up and also mentioned  she'd speak to management and see what she could do. First saying ""I hope you don't have to pay for this."" But we said ""No, it's not your fault.""
We waited 15 more minutes. No manager...
I finally had enough. I didn't want to seem rude, so I flagged down the waitress again and explained to her that I had to go to work soon, and asked for the check. She said ""I'm very sorry for your experience"" and I couldn't have agreed more. Tatjana gave us 1/2 off for the trouble, which was thoughtful. She asked if management had been by to speak with us yet, and we told her ""Not yet, but I would love if she'd come by."" 

When management finally came by (a mid-late 20something brunette with a hat on), she seemed as if no one had told her about the situation, and stared at us blankly. I explained to her that I'm sure that it's a new restaurant and you are all still figuring out the kinks but, we received hardly any food and felt neglected as opposed to the rest of the restaurant. She responded ""Well, like, we were supposed to have a soft opening for family & friends only, and we just weren't really ready for this, you were, like, the only table that had this happen."" I told her we weren't complaining. ""We just want to let you know that, although we are upset, another couple could be much more upset than we are now, and it'd be wise to address this issue in order to prevent it from happening in the future.""

I kept pleasant, even though I was irritated AND STILL HUNGRY, mind you. I wondered ""If we were the table that this was happening to, AND you knew,  then how is it that YOU, as management, cannot fix the problem?! Especially if we are the ONLY table that had this problem?!?! Just ONE table to pay extra attention to!"" Honestly, it was so unprofessional, poorly handled and poorly executed. IMO they looked OVER staffed, considering the herd of employees we had to walk through to get to our table.

Besides this, our main waitress was great, and even offered us the dessert at the end of the AYCE even though we didn't want any. This would have been a one star rating, had it not been for her. I tipped 20% because of her customer service alone.

I've been here with a large group on a few occasions and was very disappointed. The sushi is very mediocre but the service is much worse. The rest of their food is nothing to write home about. The waitresses will give you plenty of attitude if you ask them questions about the menu and they frequently get orders wrong...I've seen it. That's not to mention the long wait time. Something as simple as a glass of water may take 20 minutes to get, or be completely forgotten.

I'm not sure whether this place is just poorly managed, poorly staffed, or both. I get the impression that they just don't care one way or the other if they satisfy their customers and it comes across in the service as well as the quality of the food.

The decor had modern and simplistic furniture. Theme for entire restaurant was earthy with modern touches. There was a heated area for those who wanted to eat outside, the first room by the sushi bar had a seating area circling a big ottoman, perfect for a group, a room for bigger groups, another bar in the middle with a few rows small booths for couples/small parties . Only thing was the isle with small booths for two people seaters was nice and secluded (perfect for dates) but small and facing a plain red/orange colored wall. Also the lighting was almost too dim to see the menu. I don't know how the couple in the back corner was able to read their menu.. The bathroom was  almost like a maze, kind of hard to get to, but definitely nice like another reviewer had said....until you see the graffiti.

When we were seated, we were handed two menus printed on regular paper that had food smeared on some spots. The service was great! Our server and bus boys came back in a timely manner, our drinks were always full, dirty plates were always cleaned off as soon as new ones came. Not making this a racial debate but not one asian person was working here (that I saw) but I know to some people this does matter, figured I'd say it anyways. All the ladies serving were wearing corsets. Kind of seemed like they were trying to make this place seem higher end than what it really is.

I asked the waitress for a suggestion, she said the Helmet something roll with soft shell crab, it sounded great but asked if it had shrimp in it because I'm allergic she said no so I ordered it. When I was taking a closer look at the menu I found what she suggested and it turned out it did have shrimp in it and she gladly had it be removed. The best dish overall, sadly, was the tempura ice cream. Beautifully executed, absolutely delicious that we ordered 2! Didn't make sense though that we had small bowls for dessert but the spoons they brought us were humongous.

I ate my money's worth of food (with or without the discount it doesn't matter) but the fish was not the freshest I've had, I would only come back for the tempura ice cream or drinks with some friends. I didn't get to try their Surf n turf or curries on the menu.

When it comes to ""All you can Eat"" places many people will run you until you drop, and then not compensate for it tip wise...maybe this is why some aren't getting the best service haha) For ""All You Can Eat"" they give nice thick pieces of fish (unlike most who give paper thin slices), and I've always been happy with the quality, presentation, quantity, etc.  I'm a BIG sushi eater, so my opinion is not to be over-looked.

After 30 minutes I asked how much longer and they said another 20 minutes. As much as I am a masochist and like to be abused, not when it comes to wait times for food. The other two times I visited where both at lunch for the all you can eat special. If you choose to go this route I advise you to eat before you get there as you will wait so long for your first plate of sushi you will be starving by the time you arrive. When you finally do flag down a waitperson order everything you want right then and there, including your drinks, water, chopsticks, and anything else you might need to enjoy your meal. My last visit I had to actually get up and walk to the sushi bar and retrieve three sets of dining ware for me and my friends. This is after I had asked our server several times for a setup. The server was good enough to bring us water after we asked the second time. 

The sushi itself is OK, but the chiefs cake on various sauces which leads me to think their rice and fish are not that good. There are better sushi places in town. I think this place spends way more effort on it's ambiance than the quality of its food or service. I have grown passed the age where trend matters. I want good food and I want to be catered too.

3795662,2014-04-07,1,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"The service was so... bad on April 5, 2014. We were a large party who all ordered the all you can eat sushi for dinner. Before we sat down we told the manager that we would like to sit separate as families because of the ease of splitting the bill and for better service. The manager was very rude and said that they didn't have 3 tables to split us and that we would have to wait 45 minutes if we wanted to do that. But, as we were deciding on what to do there were several other parties waking in without a wait to be seated which makes me think that all they really wanted was our 18% gratuity. So not wanting to wait the 45 minutes they sat us in a back room which was too warm and per the waitress wasn't able to be made any cooler.  Then prior to ordering we explained to the waitress exactly how we wanted to split the bill. Then we all began to order our appetizers and rolls. Our rolls came out before our appetizers and we had to keep questioning about the dishes being delivered to us because other waitresses/waiters were just dropping off rolls without explaining what they were so we did not know whose roll it was. Then about 1 hour into our meal our waitress finally let's us know that there was no calamari (which we ordered as an appetizer) and were also told they we out of fried wontons and soft shell crab. At the the end of my meal I had reminded the waitress that I never got my appetizer of tempura shrimp and we also again had to explain the split of the bill to the waitress (which was one of our initial concerns explained to the manager).

So being upset because of the rude manager, the poor service, and unavailable food we requested to speak to the manager. We waited an hour to speak to the manager and we were very upset at the situation so the manager FINALLY responded when we had to raise our voices. We believe we should of been told about the items not available prior to us ordering. We shouldn't have felt like since their 18% gratuity was guaranteed that they no longer had to provide good service. We shouldn't have felt like we were being neglected. We also had to overhear the manager and other staff speaking rudely about us as family members passed them in the walkways on the way to the front door.

Is it okay to take 100% of our money plus 18% gratuity but not give 100% in service? I don't just go out to eat for the food but for the experience with my family. I find this very disturbing that an establishment would hire on a manager who couldn't handle this situation better. From the rude attitude to the unresponsiveness he was just about the most unprofessional manager I have come across. He accused us of trying to walk out on the bill when members of our family  were still eating and belongings were left behind (half the party finished eating and just had to go just outside the restaurant to have a cigarette or just let a restless child go out a run around outside). We never intended to walk out not did we ever hint that we were...Why would we ask to speak to a manager if we were going to walk out on the bill?!

We decided to call the police so that we could file an official complaint against the company. We were able to get an incident report filed and we will see what the future holds for  them....By reading the other reviews it doesn't look very promising for them. 

I officially HATE this place and would NOT recommend this place to anyone!!!! DON'T WASTE your time or money it's NOT worth it!! The one star rating that I gave was even more than deserved!!",1AixbwxpuYFljm-k_pkQBA,1,1,1,TKOqACDLzPXldCwk5qIqpA

The ebi was as plump and delicious as I have ever had. The staff was attentive. Food was above the bar of other AYCE bars. The only knock I had was the decibel rating of the music, once our waiter tried to take our order and could not hear, he turned down the volume. We did not need to ask. Joe was awesome, he made the experience.

UPDATE! 
I have been back since my first experience and everything that I said above, was the exact opposite. Okay, maybe not the everything, partly due to the fact that I could not get seated.

Probably checking that the table(s) were getting ready and keeping them calmed down and that is fine, but could you just, at least acknowledge my existence. I am hungry. I have money in the pocket and I could give a crap about how many drinks you had at such & such club, last night. It pissed me off so much that I have not been back. I got in my car and drove up the hill to Osaka and dined with Wayne Newton....okay not with Wayne, but next to him. Osaka on Eastern has better art, as well.

Anyway, the first time I went, I gave the place 4 stars. After the last experience, I would give it 1 star. So for my overall experience I will give it 2 stars.",KQqDOlCMgVbdfLWUpFjQeg,4,1,2,ciToBIRTRmgCCbehNhoDkA

(1) This place is not worth your time
(2) This place is not worth the calorie consumption

1 star = only because you can't give an establishment zero.

This place is dark, gloomy, and depressing.  The waitresses wear lingerie tops, I guess to try and make the atmosphere seem like a lounge, where young adults can come and hang out or have some drinks.  Which is fine.  So don't come here for sushi, or for good food service because you will sit 30-45 minutes at a time waiting for your appetizers, and even longer for your main sushi dishes.  The restaurant was pretty much full when we came and they had only 2 chefs.  They need to hire more resources and allocate them accordingly to meet their hunger demands.  It's ridiculous.

Here is what we ordered:
Garlic Edamame: too much vinegar; tasted like edamame adobo
Fried Oysters: these were actually good, but sauce was ok, it was just Tonkatsu sauce
Voloshin Motion Potion: was good, if you must come here, order this roll
Tuna Poki: salty; too much sauce, but a good serving.
Funny name roll: good substitute for raw fish since sashimi isn't available for AYCE menu.  
Krispy Kristi: too big for crispy rice, they should make the serving smaller and the spicy tuna over powers the roll
Mussels: dry; nothing special
Fried tempura ice cream: worst i've ever had, it was cold and ice cream melted when we got it, and it has more shell than ice cream. boo!
Garlic Tuna: very good..oK that's why I give this place one star.  Best garlic tuna I've ever had.

Over all, the food was not too bad and doesn't really bring about any huge complaints, but it isn't anything to rave about it either.  It was more the slow service that puts a damper on the whole dining experience.  They have super small menus that you can barely read in the dark, and they don't even give you dishes until you ask for them.  How are you supposed to eat AYCE sushi with no dishes?  Crazy.  There are way too many sushi places in Vegas to even bother coming here.",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,6,1,1,O4sA60Tx2ELP33gE0bgN3A
4034195,2012-08-08,0,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"My wife and I had the honor of getting a special invite to the opening of this place two years ago when this first open.  That first day was a tragic experience.  There were too many servers and many were not sure of the menu or the selection.  The service was slow and my wife and I spend almost 3 hours there waiting for rolls which would take what seemed like forever to get to us.  Not to mention the computer system went down and it took forever for us to pay and leave that I was almost late for work.  With all the negative experience, my wife and I think logically and we understood that this was not the grand opening and the owner was just trying to test the waters.  The sushi was actually very good and reasonably priced.  We went back two days later to give it another try and the problems seemed to have been corrected.   We tried aged steaks, and I have to say it was the best steak I had ever had.  It was very tender and flavorful.  So our journey with this restaurant began....

Since this place is only a mile from our house, we went here a lot.  My wife and I are both sushi nuts and the all you can eat price cant be beat.  It is nice to go out onto the patio and eat, especially when it isn't too hot out.  I am a big fan of their dragon rolls, and really any of their eel selection.  When you purchase all you can eat, you can also choose from other items on the menu, and not just the Sushi.  The decor is nice, and I like it when I am able to use the couches in the front of the restaurant,  with that being said, there are many reasons why this place has three stars.

Although many of the opening weekend problems have been fixed, this place is hit or miss on the service.  About a year ago I took a friend there.  We waited and waited, wand waited for our rolls.  There were only a handful of people in the restaurant at that time, and I found it quite unacceptable.  We were there for almost four hours because it was a business meeting of sorts, and neither of us got our fills because either rolls were never delivered, or were delivered late.  This coupled with declining quality of the sushi made over the few visits priors did it for me.  I have not been back there since, and probably wont go back there for sushi unless some asks me to go there.  I have heard from friends that the sushi quality had been going down hill as of late.  I will, however, go there for the steak.  I am hoping that the steak quality has not gone done.

It is sad that I have not been here for a while since my wife and I loved this place, but were are big on sushi quality and service.  We have gone back to going to Sushi Mon on Maryland Parkway and Silverado Ranch.",CqjkWaSsBohLPh9NDIRIGg,0,0,3,jC-1ioUFNDX0v8cgyOBwrA

One of the 'pros' to Xtreme Sushi I had heard from friends was the price. And they were right, AYCE is cheaper then most places...  We missed lunch but dinner was only $24 each. However they made up for the cheap AYCE by charging $3 for iced tea. 

We started out with an order of edamame and the Xtreme Orgasm salad. The edamame took far too long to come out. The salad was boring. Big slabs of tuna on some mixed greens with just a drizzle of sauce. I realized what kind of establishment I was in when the waitress informed me that ACYE means I am expected to eat all of the salad... I order salads at various AYCE sushi places around town and have never, EVER had the waitress give me a hard time about not eating all of the lettuce. 

On to the sushi. We ordered multiple rolls and nigiri... We specifically requested 3 orders of seared tuna nigiri and 3 of garlic nigiri, and recieved 4 of each. Normally this would not be an issue, normally we would be fighting over who got the extra order...  but the fish quality at Xtreme was crap. Apparently 'seared' means 'dry and chewy with blackened rice'. 

The only item we ordered that I wasn't completely disappointed with was the Caterpiller roll. Which was the only item we ordered that was completely cooked. In the end we were charged for a half roll because we didn't finish all of the food. It was only $4, not worth arguing about nor was it worth punishing our tastebuds over!

I'd rather pay a few dollars more for better tasting sushi then to ever step foot in Xtreme again.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,6,1,1,MD76N26K8v5i04H9ztqjmA

It was really nice because it gave us a good vantage point for watching the sushi chefs and people watching.  When it got a little later and chillier, they turned on the heaters so we were plenty warm.
We went for the AYCE...really good price.  My favorite part is that you can order 1/2 a roll.  We got to try a couple different rolls without getting to full.  Their appetizers, specifically the goyza and wontons are really tasty and had a great sauce to go with them.
My husband and I ordered beer with cold sake.  Our friend ordered the Godzilla's Revenge drink.  I really liked how the cold sake came out in this cool little bottle with a center holder for ice to keep the sake chilled.  It was the house sake so it was very reasonable and easy to drink.  Nothing too special but it was still good!  My friend didn't love the Godzilla's Revenge but said it was ok.

i will start off with the things i like because that's a far shorter list of the things that were horrible. 
likes include the decorations and design of the place is very well done it looks lavish and new. the bathrooms were fabulous, nice tile work. the other like is the tuna poke. it was very flavorful and different than other pokes Ive had. that's all the likes.. told you short list now for the dislikes. and for counting sakes lets number them: 

#1. remember i said the bathrooms looked wonderful, that is till you get into the stall and there is rude graffiti carved in the door. so you have your pick of penis pics, swastikas, racist comments, and one ""have a wonderful day"" carved into the door. i know graffiti is not the places fault but its obvious they are doing nothing to stop or cover it up. can you say replace the door. 

#2. the first person to our table brought complimentary miso soup. that's it no drink order or hey your server will be right with you. he just set the soup down and walked away. 

#3the server finally came by and asked for our drink order but we did not get our drinks till after we had our first order of rolls on the table and it was only after i asked if i could get my drink. 

#4 when the waitress took our order my friend asked for a fork(he dint use chopsticks) well he got it after asking three different people and asking a total of 4 times. 

#5 when the people who deliver the rolls set them down they don't say what they are or anything. then when we asked what they were she had to take out a menu and find it saying"" she thinks this is "" and ""I'm not sure what that is"" should you not know what the hell your serving? 

#6 as we went they kept bringing out roll after roll but not taking the old plates away, at a time we had 12 dirty dishes stacked at the end of our table 
. 
are you keeping track? that's 6 bad things and i haven't even gotten to the food quality. 

#7 the rolls on a whole were bland and flavorless.it was like they all were California rolls topped with different things. we kept ordering rolls to try and find one that was good but none. 

#8 the fish freshness was not up to par. there were a few times i wanted to spit it out. i have had some very fresh fish and fish you can tell right away if it is or is not. and theirs is not. 

#9 the orders were wrong. and when pointed out the server just said "" that's yours"" and walked away. 

i believe I'm stopping at 9. if i could i would give them a half a star not a full star. it was the worst service and quality i have ever had. the worst part of this place was 2 hours later when i got sick. 
over all..........dont i repeat DON'T go. that is unless you like crappy food and even crappier service.

Since we have not been here for a while, we decided to take our daughter back for sushi.  Our daughter has been eating sushi for over 10 years and has become a real food expert on taste and texture.

She was very disappointed with this place on this visit.  The rolls were mainly rice with very little substance other then rice.  She ordered a California Roll and a Caterpiller Roll.   Again, the rice was excessive and the eel, was very rubbery and chewy.  This place used to be at the top of the list and now, Yum Yum Sushi has passed this place up which is sad since they portray themselves as fast food and this place is supposed to be a classy sit down joint.

Tiffany our waitress was awesome and it is sad she has to work in a place that is heading downhill as she deserves and belongs in a place heading up for great success.  Tiffany provided one of the best services we have had in a while from anyplace we have been to.  I believe this place took a beating when they decided to do groupon as they were not prepared to handle the response they received and it seems like the quality has given way and that is why the rolls are so huge with rice.

I'm going to honestly say that I like the sushi they make there (especially the Kayla Roll), however the service has been soo bad that I will not return again.

4843195,2011-01-05,1,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"My first one-star review. I feel really bad, but this is necessary. 

Before I start off about everything negative with this place, maybe a couple redeeming factor should be said. The restaurant is new, so the decor is pretty nice. The lounge area at the front seems inviting. Hmm... That's it!

We had a party of eight with us that night. We all did all-you-can-eat except for one pair of couple. Given we are regular at AYCE, we know our orders can be pretty hectic, so we wrote down our orders on a piece of paper with how many number of order each. This should have made the server's life easier and the orders to arrive quicker. 

Well, we were wrong. One thing I can say is that I am glad there is no time limit at this AYCE because our dinner was 2 and a half hour long. This was not intentional on our part. 

First, they give you all the rolls you ordered, which I am sure it is a strategy on their part to fill you up with rice. Then they bring out four orders of the nigiri and the server asks you if you have gotten everything you ordered. WAIT A MINUTE! You had a list, didn't you??? Anyway, we waited for our food longer than it took us to eat our food. It was terrible! 

Second, the rice was cold and hard. I felt like I was swallowing pebbles no matter how much I chew. The fish itself was very decent and fresh, but the rice was terrible. However, as fresh as the fish was, the rice is about 75% of the nigiri, so there wasn't much room to turn this into a more positive situation. 

Anyways, this place is one dollar cheaper than your usual AYCE. I'd avoid it if I can. Good luck!",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,9,3,1,0eoZxpX0AWdsEkZDBuHQww

So the night before she went on a trip we of course wanted to go out and do some things before she left and just have a good time.  So when it came time to eat we came here to try it out for the first time because we were having a sushi craving.  Sat down the place looked very nice inside can't complain about that.  We were asked if we wanted to go to seat outside or inside and we decided outside.  We sat down a service assitant brought us plates and chopsticks quickly that was good.  We were trying to figure out the menu so it took us a couple of minutes on trying to start deciding what to order.  

After about five minutes the same service assitant came by with wasabi and ginger plates.  So we started wondering where our server was.  Another table on the patio that was a couple of tables over got served some sushi so we thought great she will be right over maybe she just had to get that plate out to that table.  She walks back inside.  Couple more minutes go by and we know what we wanted and a different server drops some drinks over to that other patio table.  This time we think great that must be the server who is supposed to take care of us.  She walks back inside.  So it's been about ten or fifteen minutes since we have been there and we decide if one more server comes out to the table next to us and doesn't acknowledge us we might as well just leave.  Sure enough a third server comes up with another plate for that other table and looks at us and goes back inside.  We decide to get up and leave after more than 15 minutes of sitting there without getting anything but the wasabi and ginger from the server assistant.  

As we're leaving that same server assitant is pointing at us to one of the servers and I'm assuming asking why we were leaving.  I guess they didn't want to stop us from leaving either and apologize for not helping us.  We won't be going back even after we heard the sushi was good here.  There are plenty of amazing sushi restaurants in this town.  We'll just keep going back there instead.",SP0Kz0EtEMPcYhIscukXTg,0,0,1,pbLnr190eaLe68qYai7ITQ

This is honestly, the worst sushi restaurant I have tried in vegas. I gave it several tries 3 years ago.. service was terrible, quality & taste was mediocre, and each order took extremely long... on a non-busy day. I heard this place got new management so I decided to give it a try.

The service has much improved! At least I get greeted & seated (with old management, I was never greeted and had to awkwardly look around for a seater or waiter). 

The quality of the fish is terrible. The taste is terrible. If you're someone that orders and enjoys rolls, this can be reasonable. For a person who eats solely nigiri,  avoid at all costs. There are only 2 things extreme about this restaurant. 1) The extreme amount of rice. 2) The extremely small slices of fish.

Avoid at all costs. They have an ayce sashimi for $59.99, but due to its lack of quality, I would rather eat at smiths.",8Ma3YcY9veaQ-wyAWQ2cBg,5,2,1,kIlgZ_N7YSRmEUyfAbLNxg

So we ignored it whatever and because we were excited to try a new place.. For starters, the menu was just sticky and gross and old..  It was kinda gross holding a menu that was sticky.. And pretty interesting for a sushi place  they would have a folding menu and not like a flat 1 page menu, which makes it easier to order... So again we ignored it and decided to proceed with ordering... we ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and i must say the sushi was terrible! The poke salad, almist made me vomit! I was eating poke and it was not tender like all the other sushi places i have eaten, plus the temperature was not right and i felt like i was eating bones in my poke! Then i ordered the lumpia shanghai, it was gross as well i had to through my food under the table hoping i would not get charged! All the sushi rolls were terrible not fresh like all the other sushi places i have been to.. The presentation was horrible.. my freinds nd I love to take pictures of food and it was hilarious how my friend and I had to fix the sushi because they made the rolls so sloppy!

No communication between the sushi chefs and waitresses. The waitresses had no problem blaming the sushi chefs for how slow the nigiri came out. I understand that they are the ones making the sushi, but it is the waitress' duty to make sure that the food is coming out in a timely manner. If the sushi chefs can't handle all the orders for people that do AYCE, they shouldn't have AYCE to begin with.

However, we went there on Valentines Day ( I know crazy time to go) and received the worst service ever! First, our waitress was HORRIBLE. More horrible than usual. Their service usually sucks anyway, but that day it was extra bad. It took a long time for her to finally come to our table to place our drink order. She just kept telling us ""I'm sorry we are very swamped."" So after she finally came back to our table we placed our orders (we did all you can eat). They brought all my rolls, but only brought my bf one roll out of the 3 he ordered within an hours time. We had to hunt down our waitress and waited about 10 mins till she finally made it to our table. We asked her about the rolls and she stated she would go check on them. She came back 15 mins later and asked if we got our rolls. We told her no. She apologized and relayed again that they were swamped and said she would put the rolls through again. We declined and asked for the check. The waitress brought back the check and she charged us 2 all you can eat(s)! My bf told her we were not paying for two all you can eats because he only received one roll. She stated she had to get the manager. 

When we spoke to the manager we told her we would happily pay for one all you can eat and pay for the individual roll that by bf got. She fixed our check and we vowed to never come back. I'm just sayin' a good manager would have just charged one all you can eat and comped the one roll due to the horrible service. It just didn't seem like she cared. 

Also, they removed a lot of my fave rolls from their menu. I tried ordering super white tuna like usual and the waitress looked at me like I was crazy.",6yD8DrSkVCI-u8u5MzLCgA,2,0,1,bSbj8RG1YbxMJn1DcL9Uzg

5361269,2011-07-09,0,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"**Summary**
       - Value - $20 for a menu you'd usually see at dinner for $25 or $27. Now that's a deal.
       - Rolls - A lot of the rolls are different and very unique. The Yoshi's Dynamite is by far, the best roll ever.
       - Freshness - It's pretty good. I've seen better, but then again, I've seen a lot worse.
       - Decor - The decor has a very modern Japanese feel to it, from their contemporary all white couches to their waitresses in corsets.
       - Service - The service is friendly, but XTREMELY SLOW when there's a lot of patrons. To avoid this, I usually go during off hours or during lunch when it first opens. 
**Price**
       - $19.99 AYCE Lunch 12am - 3 or 4pm (I can't remember)
**Must Haves**
       - Yoshi's Dynamite - Yum yum scallops, salmon on the outside, with eel like sauce. Also, they use a blow torch to flame it after. This has got to be my favorite roll of all time. I can literally eat two of them.
       - Protein Roll - Salmon/tuna on the inside, salmon on the outside with a ponzu like sauce. It's a very good roll if you like salmon and don't want a lot of rice. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg?select=dkFqpCVDg2ZfCuNhi3AqxA)
       - Pontoni Roll - Shrimp tempura on the inside, large fresh water scallops on the outside. They use a torch to flame this too. The scallops are nice and large.
       - Uni/Sweet Shrimp/Large Scallop - This is the only place I've seen offering these two delicacies during the day. Also, it's one of the few places where you can get large scallop nigiri instead of the tiny ones. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6oLnLmdo9FhuAeR-vLQ4tg?select=vlRcz043jBTHq5DYwmWSjQ)
       - Fried Soft Shell Crab - Fried goodness.
       - Baked Mussels - Some of the best baked mussels in town. It's all in their eel sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig?select=W2EHApKCRZSDbpxwJ7KaZw)
       - Xtreme Orgasm Salad - Screaming orgasm (seared ahi tuna sashimi with sauce on top), but on a bed of leafy greens. Perfect for those watching their carbs.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place when they're not busy. The value is incredible, the rolls are spectacular, and the nigiri is delicious.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,2,1,5,Mll43couO1aoeG_tEC58nA

We even got to meet the owner and he was able to explain to us about the Groupon miss! I know a lot of the bad reviews were based on the Groupon but from what I understand they ran the Groupon when the owner was out of town and he was not aware so the restaurant got slammed and they were not adequately prepared / staffed for it. It took them by suprise = bad, slow service. I know because we went when they had the groupon and did not have a good experience BUT we decided to go back and it was AMAZING!

First of all, the atmosphere is very up class, modern, hip, young professionally and I love it. They have a open bar that opens up to the outside facing sushi masters!

Tempura mochi - I said it...TEMPURA MOCHI - strawberry was my favorite!
The yellow tail sashumi
The red-scarlet roll. OMG- the best!!!

Nothing gets you through a ride like that unless you have food to look forward to at the end, so all-you-can-eat anything sounds good.  On the recommendation of a co-worker, we headed over to this spot and were 20 minutes early, since they don't open until noon.  
At that time, the doors opened and we sat at the sushi bar, which has some very comfy, cushy stools to sit on.  The waitress took our drink order promptly, explained the rules of the AYCE option, basically giving us 1.5 hours to eat anything on the menu, except for the page with steaks, and we were off.  Before she left, not only did we order beverages, but a couple of appetizers and rolls to get the party started.  

Two guys and a girl with big appetites indulged in:  tempura vegetables, fried calimari, 2 orders of Fried Lumpia, a Russian Missile roll, a Katie ""K"" roll, 4 orders of the Pacquiao roll (the guys loved that roll the best), and at least 3 other rolls for the guys.  I wasn't paying that much attention to their food because I was too busy eating mine.  I had the tempura red bean mochi ice cream to top off the gorging--I'll stick with regular mochi the next time because the tempura coating just didn't do it for me.  Our waitress kept checking on us, keeping my glass of iced green tea full, and making sure we had enough food throughout.  The sushi chefs were friendly and attentive, too.

For $19.95, the amount of options to choose from on their menu, AND the way my friends and I can eat when we're really hungry, we will be back.  There were more appetizers and rolls that we didn't get to this time around!",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,4,0,3,4KakWocoiiIAmQPwoYa4-A

We got our food in a really timely manner and ate almost every last bit of it (one of our group member ordered one piece of the steroid roll and we were unable to finish it).  The waitress was fantastic - she was very attentive with drinks, taking extra orders, and remembering who had what as the sushi plates were passed all around the table.  If things hadn't gone well it would have been very upsetting to me, since I was the one that chose the place, but I could not have been more pleased.  I will bring friends and family back with confidence.",wKwJGB84SaZ0so2TWmhinw,1,0,5,mjPAHsG_Y6Oux3XNmcX2Uw

service is Xtreme-ly slow, food is mediocre at best and the wait staff should all be working at night clubs.

maybe the name Sushi and Steakhouse should have been a hint?",q6ShBpgwKGyXoM24wPuSyg,0,0,1,4kURxKXpS-fZgtV-EUbYHA

Ordered a rib eye, and it was wonderful, i usually am not the type to eat much red meat, but i will go back for their steak any day!! Also had the baked fantasy and loved it! Our waitress was soo nice , we even said it was alittle warm in the building and she offered to turn the heat down. Prices are pretty good! And the menu has tons of different things i have never even seen before... The booth seating is a little crammed but i LOVE the privacy. What ever went wrong in the past seems to have gotten better, glad my first time there went very well.. would LOVE to go back. 

p.s. im allergic to fish....but not shellfish... and i found xtreme had a wide variety of alternative rolls. yay!",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,1,0,4,gSDazr_-nhQpXnx7GdceVA
5778696,2011-03-20,1,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"Guess it pays to walk in w super low expectations, because I was pleasantly surprised but notice I still only gave it 2 stars. I had a great experience at the southern highlands location so decided to give this one a chance w a groupon. 
We were seated at a booth by the sushi bar. Like others had mentioned it is kind of weird that the waitresses are all white girls and wearing corset tops. Although I disagree that any were attractive - muffin tops galore... I don't think sushi chefs were Japanese either, one said he was Korean the others looked Filipino. 
Anyway back to the positives! I thought service was very attentive, they checked on us frequently and were very friendly. Our server was Heather, but seems to be a tag team effort because other girls also helped us out. Slower than most sushi places, but not as bad as yelpers had said -appetizers started arriving w/in 15 min and nigiri maybe 5 min later. We ordered a bunch at one time and some things like the voloshin motion one did take over 30 min to arrive. The order that things came out was super random, appetizers were all easily fried but some came 15 min after others? That's on the kitchen though, not the servers. I mentioned I didnt get my soft shell crab and she got it for me. 
Nigiri had a lot of fish to rice, but it was cut pretty sloppy and I was worried that my salmon and scallops seemed to be at room temp. But its 24hrs later and I'm fine. 
Poki roll was AWFUL sesame oil was overwhelming, consistency of the fish was nasty, and it was filled w ocean salad. I tried 1 piece and spit it out. Krispy Kristi roll also bad. It was a really sad version of Ra's crispy spicy tuna. 
I really like the selection of sides, but the sushi is pretty mediocre overall. Helpful hint - their tempura sauce is awful, tastes more like shoyu, so ask for the sweet chili sauce for calamari or just keep it from won tons or lumpia. 
Although this place exceeded my low expectations, I still wouldn't recommend going unless you're using the groupon. I'm thrilled service was good, but there are so many better sushi places in this town, don't waste your money. They also charged $2.99 for hot tea which kind of pissed me off. That's more than 10% of the sushi price - wtf! It also took an hour and a half for dinner btw",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,2,MNEB4OgwkH19b7FBp42Bhg
5794986,2011-11-04,2,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"HIGHLY likely I will not be returning!!

First, ""Would you like to eat inside or outside?"" and its the first day of the cold Vegas weather... we chose inside... Nevermind that the restaurant is completely open near the bar. Sure it's gorgeous and I'm sure very nice on a decent day. Even the waitress was walking around with a coat... is there a heater in here somewhere? 

Second, took a good 15 minutes (no exaggeration) for a drink order, I just got a simple glass of water.. It was refilled twice in my hour and a half stay... spicy food makes me thirsty!

Third, AYCE sushi... okay, okay, thanks for charging us the lunch price even though it was after 3p... but where's the fish?? The rolls were PACKED with rice. It was getting stuck in my throat, but could I wash it down with water... no:[ water glass is empty!

I'll give it to them on the Nigiri, garlic tuna and eel. Delicious, although the eel is usually served warm in other restaurants... I guess it was supposed to here too, but after sitting out in the cold for a while it cooled down pretty fast.

My friend and I were only able to place 2 orders in.. and we stacked them up! Getting a server to the table was a chore. 

Of course, getting the check and making sure we paid were very quick trips!! I would not recommend coming here... maybe its a different story if you sit at the bar... in the summer.",xvtBlzl5ZPgrGiWLA97bGQ,2,0,1,0bPNSBI42oGpW6aFJ4rL6g
5797210,2011-11-29,0,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"Returned here a couple months ago. I typically like to give places second chances, and usually with sushi I like to give them a redemption because sometimes the batch isn't always great the first time around (hey, it happens, sometimes you'll get that time where it wasn't as fresh as it usually is).

It wasn't the sushi (it was decent as it had been the first time and it didn't give me an upset stomach either), but it was the snide attitude I got from an employee who happened to read my review on this place the first time. They took offense to what I said at the end of my last review and called me out in front of my ENTIRE party about it (and when I explained and even offered to ""apologize"", they still gave me attitude right until the end). I have to say yes, it was embarrassing by the way the employee made it sound like my entire review was bad (in which it wasn't, you can read for yourself!), and publicly announced it in front of all my friends, which made it sound even more awkward. I didn't appreciate the way the employee handled their reaction with my review, and for that reason I'm not planning to return here again, despite how everyone else was nice to me, it was that one experience that ruined the rest of it for me. 

If you're not going to take honest reviews in a professional way, then I don't think the restaurant business is the place for you to work.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,5,0,2,1IK-NGpzakOgTahlceWPiw

While I know I probably can't expect much presenting a Groupon, I would have at least expected a sushi place to have fresh fish and the sushi we had didn't taste very fresh.  There was also some roll that had rice kind of fried/grilled/some other sort of weirdness on the bottom and eating it was highly unpleasant (the texture and taste).  It has been a while since we went there and maybe things have changed, however, when my husband and I went it wasn't great.  Our waitress was very nice, though, and made that part of it, at least, a bit better.",JxHB8pSbpcA8NzkuaiJxdg,1,0,2,EuXtG2RhFyPZAFy3PVB4DQ

5841594,2014-04-07,0,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"They should call this place X-tremely Rude!! I don't know what happened... More than likely it's because they are under new management! I do not advise you to go here period!!  Service is horrible, it was evident that the manager had better interests than to meet the needs of his customers! Talk about a bad experience.

Among many other things, They didn't even have everything on their menu and they still charged us full price
For the AYCE sushi!! We waited so long to speak to the manager (about an hour) who, by the way we over heard, was talking to the sushi chef in the back trying to figure out a way to explain to us why majority of the items on the menu were not available!  It would have been easier if the waitress gave us a heads up about that!

The experience was horrendous! They need to hire better employees who understand that good business comes from providing excellent customer service.  Xtreme sushi! I am Xtremely disappointed! I highly advise
You not to go here if you are looking for a drama free lunch or dinner.  

To the owner of the company - you may want to re-think the managers who are running your business.  Matt was a poor representation of a Manager. He was very immature and unprofessional. Not once did he come to our table to resolve the issue. Because of this you will lose an xtreme amount of loyal high paying customers.

5959467,2013-01-12,4,I-KFzdnJcqbUHOAdO2I7Ig,"So... I haven't been tempted to come back to this place since my first visit, until this week. My coworkers were in the mood for sushi and I said yes to their invite before I knew where they were headed. 

We arrived at the restaurant around 12:15 and the place was pretty busy. We walked in the door and I was already turned off by the fish and vinegar smell that welcomed us. That definitely set a bad tone for our meal. We ordered our food and each of our dishes seemed to come out pretty slowly. Not great, when we have a time limit.

One at a time, our food trickled out of the kitchen and I can't think of one thing that I ate that was even slightly good. The tofu was flavorless and soggy, the edamame was bland, all the sushi and rolls were poor quality and texture. All the fish had an extremely fishy smell.  The sauces were too thick and sweet and I think everyone at our table had to force themselves to eat most of the food we ordered. 

I'm not someone who dishes out 1 star reviews very often, but I'm absolutely shocked that this place not only stays in business, but that they were actually pretty busy when we came. The prices are cheap for AYCE, but I'd rather pay a few more dollars for something edible. If I wasn't dining with coworkers, I would definitely have said something about both the service and the food.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,6,1,SKlwM0joFqEzRAVqhcSLrg
