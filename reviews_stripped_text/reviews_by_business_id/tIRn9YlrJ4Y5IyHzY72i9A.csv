   The Winchell's in there is also very professional and friendly.

745360,2013-09-27,0,tIRn9YlrJ4Y5IyHzY72i9A,I love subway. I used to be a manager at another location and I have to say this store employes by far the RUDIEST employee I've ever seen. She's a heavier set white woman and every time I go in this store she's impatient and just plain rude not only to me but my co workers notice it as well. she defiantly gives this store a bad look & if she worked at my store I would have already fired her! I will always go to subway just NEVER this location. Upper management should defiantly check into this.,P9TtVswd7QfXjlYQvSR8vQ,0,0,1,jx-V_tSp46K1f2o_BchKKg

The girl behind the counter was not friendly either.

There was a lady wearing a headset that was really nice and friendly who started my order, not the one that actually made my sandwich. The one taking my order was younger I believe and when I was adding items like pickles and olives to my sandwich it was as if I was asking for lite of everything. I had to ask for more to get a ""normal amount"" and even then it wasn't like she seemed unhappy about it. I really hope she was just a new artist and will get better.

Why? I never really knew, since I think i make a bangin' sandwich, if i do say so myself (thats my PRIDE talking) but it is nice to go and not have to do any of the work.

Subway used to have TONS of 5 dollar subs but now theyre are far and few and I understand it. Food prices are going up and i never knew how they could do it so cheap considering workers pay, food prices and space rentals.. BUT anyway..

This subway is my favorite. They have a drive thru that makes it super easy to get your sandwich if your tight on time and its 24 hours. Yes ladies and gentlemen no more excues or late night junk food after clubbing, work or drinking, when you can drive thru to a subway.

The employees are so friendly and i always tip them because they have failed to make a mistake and theyre sandwiches just taste a bit better than other subways.

What dont i like, but its not their fault? That its connected to a winchells! yes, talk about hell. here i am trying to keep on my diet and i cant even walk in because my nose smells the fresh baked donuts and my fast ass wants one. such a tease! thank goodness for drive thru.

Favorite? Italian sandwich and theyre new pastrami melt. Nom NOM nom. I may just drive over now and over myself some subway.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,3,1,4,Cq2_G10qkVnAI_9v9DfzIQ

If you do not like people or like to be a little friendly you should not work with the public.  Ugh! I will chose a different subway next time.,E_sVrthOwZjPpCNAx3YBxA,1,1,2,ZDJ80q7BJ9zGvM-xhaBm3w

The restaurant was flea and the staff was nice. There is a winchell's donut sharing with subway, so when you come out of he restaurant, you have a unique donut and sub smell!",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,1,1,3,tMJ0HR72frCrF4_jSpf4HQ
2818056,2015-08-19,0,tIRn9YlrJ4Y5IyHzY72i9A,"I waited several minutes before even being acknowledged. The employee who made my 6"" sub was rude and impolite. She kept saying, ""what? What did you say?"" While I was ordering. She practically threw my order at me after I waited again for her to ring me up for my meal. As I handed her my card with my hand held out for her to place it back in my hand she threw it on the counter. There was ONLY me and two other customers in line at the time.) Both of the female employees were less than efficient in providing decent customer service. If it didn't make matters worse once I left and got to my destination in which I began eating my sub there was a long curly hair on it, then I think oh wow she didn't have a hair net covering her long curly pony tail.

I used to come in the morning before work and they would always tell me it would be 20-30 minutes before they could help me because they were doing beginning of day procedures. Sometimes, no one even comes to the counter and you have to stand in the lobby for 10 minutes.

If you've been to one subway then you've been to them all. What stands out from this one and the others is that its 24 hours, has a drive thru, shares space with Winchell's, and is well kept.

3723817,2015-03-29,0,tIRn9YlrJ4Y5IyHzY72i9A,"I had left another Subway location(see the other review) to come here and should have stayed where I was. I arrived as the gal behind the counter was building two sandwiches for an OCD college kid.

There was a couple in front of me that had been waiting 20 minutes before I got there. There was a guy who was in charge but he was working the drive thru window.

A woman showed up to pick up a catering order that was wrong that took the staff gal off the line for a good 10 minutes.

The couple in front of me ordered 5 sandwiches. Two were veggie and the guy ordering had a cow when the sandwich dude touch the bread of the veggie sandwiches with the gloves he was wearing to touch the meat of the prior subs.

I am 30 minutes in the building, it is my turn and then the guy tells me to hold as he just got a drive thru order and had to make it before he could help me. So let me get this straight, I am waiting 30 minutes to place my order when I should have just hopped in my truck and went through the drive thru to bypass everyone waiting in line.

The other gal got done with restocking and the catering order so she built my subs and I was finally out of there.

I needed to get my wife something for dinner and she wanted to try the new Italiano turkey melt.  She enjoyed the sandwich.

Part of this Subway is shared by Winchell's doughnuts so you can get two fixes with one stop if you care.

Service was OK but the guy didn't know how to make their electronic payment accept Apple Pay.  I'll be damned if I download their app to pay through them.  This would only be a back up place to go as the other location is closer.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,5,3,9xl-WEUiPz2pZJvnLTDHXw

However, there are times when I desperately need something to eat, and I just want it quickly and to be fresh-like. Enter Subway toppings! It's a salad on bread. When I need to kick start my morning, I am going for the egg whites, just load on the veggies and a squirt of mustard. 

We used to go to another location in our hood, but we recently branched out. Glad we did. This location is super clean, well-managed and open 24-hours. I could seriously tell appreciate a difference. This Subway cares. Plus, if you like to mix your fresh-like with your dough-like, there's a Winchell's inside too. Nothing quite beats a veggie sub and glazed doughnut combo!

The second thing I am a fan of is irony, which is why this subway is great. A restaurant known for its healthy meals sharing a building with a Winchell's Doughnuts, priceless. In the 15 or 20 times I've been there, I've maybe seen someone order doughnuts twice, I can't help but feel for the neglected Winchell's employee. In my opinion, they should open another subway in place of the Winchell's, now THAT would be innovative

but I digress... 

The Subway is open 24 hours, and has a drive through. I enjoy the fact  that they keep things extremely clean and they are not stingy with portions. 

I should mention that they have dealt with some credit card fraud so they require ID when you use your card.

Tell them Nathaniel sent you, it won't get you a discount, but it will do wonders for my ego.",mF17tuSzeZwoDqtGfu3Xjw,1,1,4,hCpBzfqIoBkanKhw7ffPhw
5583183,2013-09-19,0,tIRn9YlrJ4Y5IyHzY72i9A,"Jared would be proud.  Turkey subs, wheat bread, healthy veggies, no condiments.  
I love the concept of Subway.  I wish there was more consistency among the locations.

The veggies at this location are usually fresh tasting.
The employees are always friendly and helpful, some appear to have been there for a long time, some are new.
There is an added benefit of this location sharing space with a donut shop.(sorry Jared, none for you.)
The breads are delicious.
The large subs for parties always taste great.

However, that said, there are several things hurting at this location. 
1) The meat other than the turkey always looks bad. Especially the roast beef which is a dark artificial looking brown.
2) They don't have the white chocolate Raspberry cookies.
3) They almost always mess up my order somehow causing delays.
4) They are kind of sloppy making sandwiches and I watched tuna fall into another bin and they didn't do anything about it while I was there.  It was not very busy at the time.  Today when I was there it was busier and they were scrambling to keep up but it seemed neater.
5) The chicken appears to have painted on grill marks.

Overall it is a decent, healthier alternative to lunch and September is Subtember $5.00 footlongs so it is a value!.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,0,0,3,dwIQHeINZp7pYeRAA4ZmIw
