I arrive and am told it's going to be another 25 min. Prior to ordering online, I tried calling in my order and the phone rang for 9 min. Now I'm sitting here waiting for my pizza and the phones are ringing none stop so I now know why no one picked up because they think since they are short staffed it's okay to not take business. Definitely not a good place for a quick lunch. They say they are hiring all positions and are short staffed but this is ridiculous.  It's now 11:47 and still no pizza.",X_RMmWX1IMQpxX0lbm5IRQ,0,0,1,BrpPiug0LYMD4rzYN-w73w
