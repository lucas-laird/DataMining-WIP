I had the Breakfast Sandwich minus the bacon and my b/f had a Shrimp cocktail and Greek salad.

1539254,2009-07-30,0,7Wr0piSMGiq5qy5opiLNrA,"Swimming makes you hungry, doesn't it? The Cabana Grill will cure your food fix. This place is located in the MGM Grand Pool area. Prices average about $10-15 a person. Which is fair considering it Vegas, and in the pool area, where its the only restaurant in site. Unless you want to leave the pool area. I don't think outside food is permitted, but I'm not to sure. 

The sandwiches must of had about a pound of meat! Really, insane amounts of meat. I had the grilled ham and Swiss burger, which came with fries and a pickle. I only ended up eat half the burger, cause it was so massive. Remember what your parents told you, ""wait an hour after you eat, before getting in the pool"". After the massive burger I felt like an anchor in the pool! LOL! 

Some of my other buddies ordered the cabana dog, which was also massive, looked like a foot long dog. And the bucket of nachos...it was literally a big ""bucket"" full of nachos!

The salad was better than the burger though, but the fries with the burger were delicious. It's located in the pool area and I'm not sure if you need to be a guest there to get in. 

The service is okay though, but they are really bad a refilling waters. I'd highly recommend checking Cabana Grill out when staying at the MGM. I think all the food was under $20 during lunch, so it's not bad in Vegas terms.",19ovO-9P2DgBeQ-W1BwaVQ,0,0,5,X08N1n9ilZy8Gl9r3rd7uA

I had the chicken strips which came with 4 big pieces of chicken and a bucket of seasoned crisscut fries.  Tasted good and there was a lot of it.

The grilled cheese sandwiches were a different story.  Two sandwiches came out with the cheese barely melted.  Thats not grilled cheese in my book.   Also one sandwich was missing the fries it was supposed to come with.  So it took a while to get that straightened out.

The frozen drinks were not that great either and kind of expensive, $20 dollars each. Considering that the service wasn't very good, it was annoying that the bill had already added in the tip for a group of 4 people.",Cea45bU6zSRZSer822iobw,0,0,2,XgfOPLlAoEbdkzgMcxHyhw

Definitely  NOT one of the better poolside services.
And very overpriced, but then again which one isnt except your house.
Ordered the following:
Nachos with chili= $20.00. The only item worth eating, a huge portion, and not bad at all. Chips, cheese sauce, and toppings all spot on. easily 2 people can share this and call it a meal.
""Warm"" big pretzel with cheese sauce= $6.00. Tastes like it came from the ass-crack of a homeless Bavarian, fucking disgusting. Stale, borderline hard, gross. I dont think even a homeless person would eat this, wow.
Chicken tenders= $13.00 Garbage. comes straight from the freezer, jack in the box tastes better, and the waffle fries limp and lukewarm, inconsistently seasoned (some parts to death some not at all) . Only thing tender is my ass after the price/butt-rapeage.
1 powerade, a fucking coke, 6.00 each.
Pineapple mojito finished in 3 sips filled with 60% ice, $14.00. Tasty but gone b4 you know it.
Come to the pool with McDonalds bags as half the ghetto bastard crowd does (not that a casino food court is a bargain either.)
Granny goose ordered the burger another disappointment RAPE ME $18.00.
Only reason not one star is the value and taste of the nachos. Rest is overpriced crap.",3YK7REruC4FwDTOj8zUYcQ,3,0,2,35ymWXmMnvfhUTbYX9-hDw
3563441,2014-10-14,1,7Wr0piSMGiq5qy5opiLNrA,"The Cabana Grill is one of the more casual dining options offered by the MGM Grand located at the Grand Pool. If you have a cabana or daybed then this is where you can order food from. Other than that, you can choose sit down service which enables you to dine outside underneath the fans and misters (covered from the sun) or the walk-up service to order directly from the kitchen and take your food back to your chairs.

""Dining in"" was a great experience with a nice view of the pools. We were seated promptly and the service was friendly and fast. Walking up to  the grill itself to order was also quick and easy. It would be about $13-$20 a person for a meal, but keep in mind the portions are pretty big.

Nachos - The. Best. Nachos. I. Have. Ever. Had. This is on their menu as an appetizer, but it takes about 3 people to finish these nachos. Everything about it is perfect, order it, with extra jalapeños. 

Spicy Tuna Roll - Decent-sized roll, but nothing extraordinary. The soy sauce comes in a cute package that looks like a fish.

Chicken Tenders - About 5-6 pieces of chicken tenders and comes with a side of delicious fries. Order the jalapeño ranch as your sauce of choice, thank me later.

I still have more to try from here, but I can't get passed my nachos and chicken tenders addiction just yet.

3718134,2010-08-10,0,7Wr0piSMGiq5qy5opiLNrA,"This place isn't cheap, but it's not too expensive either due to the large portions.

I ordered the vegetarian omelet for breakfast on my most recent Vegas trip and I was very satisfied. The omelet was large enough for two people and came with hash browns. The service wasn't bad either. 

I came back for lunch with my boyfriend and he ordered a chicken cob sandwich. The sandwich was also large and came with a pile of criss-cut fries and a pickle. The service wasn't as good as my breakfast experience, because there was some seating assignment confusion. Three waiters passed our table and never asked our order. After 15 minutes of waiting, we asked the hostess stand (which we were seated adjacent to) where our waiter was, and then our order was promptly taken.

If you're tired of fast food but don't want to drop $25 on a meal, then give this place a shot. You'll get a lot of good quality food for about $13 a person.",uh1qv2sixgk8CLucukNWbw,1,0,4,_Pej-AY40NBr1OEBmRnFDw

The food is pretty good too. The nachos ($14) and nacho fries ($17) are SOO good and huge portion too! The BBQ burger ($18) is also a great choice. Yeah, it's pricey but it's Vegas and right by the pool. 

The Bloody Mary was boooomb and strong. I was pretty tipsy after the 24oz. The blue slushee (blueberry something) is the best one out of all of them. $24 for 24oz with souvenirs cup and then $17 for refill. The liquid drinks are waaaay stronger than the cocktails though. You'll get more bang for your buck that way. 

We always have a great time when we come here, and will continue to come time and time again! No pictures since we didn't bring phones to the pool :(",mCUciHl2wNzTMbKtGPwVeA,0,1,4,NWovVBiWxNEIclPV-UHQgw

4525789,2014-07-28,0,7Wr0piSMGiq5qy5opiLNrA,"The Cabana Grill is located poolside the MGM Grand Pool.  If you choose to ""dine in"" they have an outdoor area that is separated specifically for restaurant patrons.  This area has fans blowing and mist machines going to keep you cool in the intense heat.  

There is also a self serve area where you can go up to a counter and order the same food and either take back to your room or eat in a shaded area with outdoor tables and benches.  

I came here twice and participated in both options.  The dining in experience was nice and relaxing.  You are able to get a nice lunch while also taking in the poolside atmosphere.  I had the club sandwich and it was huge!  The fries were amaze balls as well.  I was completely stuffed after this meal which rarely happens for me.  Prices were relatively inexpensive.  A cheap lunch could run you from $10-20.  They do serve alcohol hear, as they do at almost every establishment in Vegas.  

I also had the pizza from here to go and this was not as good.  Though it is cheaper to grab your food on the go it is much more of a pleasant experience when you are seated and dining under the fans.  The slice of pizza was just average and it was $8.  For a dollar or so less I could have went to Bonanno's in the food court.  The fries on the go option was nice though.

Most of it is in the shade which feels excellent with a few misters on the sides.  We took breaks from the pool, on two days, and it was nice to cool off int he shade before hitting the pool area again.  We had excellent service each time. We came for lunch but I had breakfast foods and it was perfect. Also, I eat gluten free and they have gluten free bread. This is huge for us GF eaters. You thus can get burgers, toast, etc.....  Really improves things to have the GF bread. They actually have a separate GF menu at the grill with a ton of items like fish tacos among other good sounding things.   I had bacon, eggs and GF bread and it was tasty!  Our service was very good. Two of the days our waitress was excellent. I feel so bad I forgot her name. Aylani!?  Top notch. She won't be a waitress for long. She will be in management I am sure.  Also, the busboy, Gino (I think it was) was excellent.  Kept filling those drinks and you need that water on the hot days!
