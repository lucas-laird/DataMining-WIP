Then when I get my sandwich I noticed it was dry...it was supposed to be with Dijon mustard as advertised. At first I thought ok no problem, let me just ask for some on the side. When I ask for it..the lady had no idea what I was saying. Pointing to the breads and saying sandwich....don't know how u mistake that for Dijon mustard. So after 5 minutes of trying to explain to her what it is and going through mayo and other condiments that I wasn't talking about, she finally says she just makes the sandwiches...umm..o..k..obviously not how described in the menu...then my girlfriend asks for her rolls they forgot to give her...so I go to another worker who hopefully speaks a bit of English if I can get it and she say says ""she didn't give it to u?"" No...that's why I'm standing here waiting like an idiot. Then my girl asks if she can get her pizza warmed up and the girl says we can't its against policy...my girl wasn't having it and thankfully the chef heard and told her of course u can just put it in the oven! In a tone where it seemed like he wanted to call her a jackass. Any way ..stay away from this place..they can't prepare a sandwich like they describe and what they did make was horrible..pizza was bleu...just don't go here...walk FAR AWAY!

1435139,2018-05-23,0,RycZOiohghoI0Ssg2Qqgqw,"On Sunday May 13th, my daughter and I arrived to the Paris hotel for a much anticipated 3 night mother's day getaway. Check in went well. The room was clean. We had a great time exploring the hotel, pool and gambling. 
We walked past JJ's earlier in the day and the pizza smelled great. That evening for dinner we decided to stop at the window to grab a couple of slices to bring back to our room.  The window agent wasn't there and as we waited a line began to form behind us. The agent (Teresa) walked past telling us to go inside. We approached the register and waited when we noticed that Teresa was helping the gentleman that was behind us farther down the counter. So we went down there. She brought his selections to the same register we had been waiting at and then began assisting people that began to line up, again that had been behind us. For a 2nd time Teresa walked past us telling us go over there. 
When it was our turn in line, we mentioned to Teresa that we didn't think it was fair that she kept telling us to go over here or there and helping other people in front of us. She claimed she didn't do that when she absolutely had. We asked to speak with Teresa's manager and she  said she would call a manager. While waiting her coworker ""Katrina"" sharply said : oh its mothers day and some people just want to complain"". I asked her to repeat herself because I was astonished that this employee would be so rude to a customer. She said ""I wasn't talking to you I was talking to my friend.  We have to work on mothers day and  I feel sorry for you being in a bad mood while some people have to work.""  I was completely taken aback.  I was already frustrated with the back and forth about the line and Katrina was just making a bad situation worse. My daughter told Katrina to stop talking to us because she could tell that Katrina was just making a bad situation worse. 
The woman behind me in line asked me what was happening and I told her. Katrina yelled that I should ""get out of line and go wait over there and stop complaining to her guests"". Shortly after, Frank a manager from another area came over and asked what was going on. We explained the situation. he apologized and asked if we wanted to file a report. I told him i just wanted him to be aware because I personally have spent over 35 years in the customer service field, my current position is  Director of Toursim and if one of my employees would have spoken with a guest that way i would have immediately sent them home while the situation was investigated.
Frank assured me that they would investigate and even brought me to another area to file a report. I asked if this was just a waste of my time and he assured me it wasn't. I'm not sure what transpired but i do know that Katrina was still working at the restaurant as we saw her when we walked past. i was not contacted again by management during  my stay despite filling out a report with my phone number and room number.

1572157,2013-10-14,0,RycZOiohghoI0Ssg2Qqgqw,"So the sandwiches here are fantastic. Was in town for the weekend for a girlfriends wedding and stayed at the Paris. We ate JJ's sandwiches twice as we really enjoyed them the first day when we swung by during the slow time of the day and grabbed a late bite. 

That bring said, our second experience here was nowhere near as positive as our first. The bakery was packed as it was lunch hour so understandably there was going to be more of a wait. 35 minutes for a cold sandwich is a little extreme though, especially considering my friend who ordered her hot sandwich at the same time as I got hers about 20 minutes before I did. Multiple people who ordered after me had eaten and left by the time I was given my lunch, which I only received after asking what the eta was.. They had lost my order. Then made my sandwich but threw it out before even offering it to me as they made it wrong. And then, when I finally did receive it, it looked completely different than it had the day before, even though I ordered the same thing. 

I would chalk it up as a mistake seeing as I have worked it the service industry and I understand that happens. Problem was, I was 1 of about 10 people who waited an exceptionally lengthy amount of time for their food, just to watch people who ordered way after us leaving with their meals in hand. 

JJ's has great food but don't come starving and expect to be patient. They sandwich line is incredibly unorganized and while the chefs are friendly enough, the food is not consistent. Lost orders, orders made incorrectly and a lot of confusion behind the counter are going to be on the menu if you decide to come during the lunchtime rush.",N0L0HPDeFzLmun5jmUKkMw,0,0,3,Kht2LAmmqcgq39SRjNfmrg

But not nearly as good. It's a fix of calories. I'd probably avoid dinnertime and see what they have to offer for breakfast and lunch as the place really is a bakery, and from the menu seemed to be teem with French delicacies ranging from croissants to specialty sandwiches.

Hilarious anecdote: if you see a cash register technician named Aziza, tell her I said hi. In no fewer than 3 questions I tried to find out what nationality she was. The answers started out with ""Europe"" and ended at ""Eastern Europe"". Maybe it's company policy to not let your clients know you aren't French.

It was cool to see them making the dough and pizzas by hand right there behind the counter using an old schoolish oven. The crust a was so crispy!

I ordered the chicken ($10.) and hub ordered the vegetable ($8.). When I asked the cashier what condiments came on the sandwich he replied, ""whatever the menu says is what is on it."" A little rude but I didn't expect much out of him. 

The wait was about 20 minutes. There were 3 employees assembling the orders. It took awhile due to the new menu and they were still getting use to which sandwiches had what on them. 

The chicken sandwich was decent. The French baguette was soft and fresh. The chicken was served in small pieces with lettuce and tomato. The chicken didn't have much flavor. I added additional condiments to help it out.  Since the chicken was in small pieces it kept falling out of the bread so eating it wasn't easy. The portion was small for the price. The sandwiches do not come with a side. 

They bake all of their bread, pastries and pizza fresh everyday.

If you need a cheap quick bite to eat and are too lazy to venture outside to get something, the 2 slices of pizza and a fountain drink for 10 dollars is probably the best deal you'll find in the Paris Hotel. They really need to add a food court of some sort in there....

I was looking for something substantial to fill my stomach for a low price and didn't want to have a dinner of just pastries (though i was tempted...)  Since every place I looked, including this one, was charging at least 10 dollars for a salad or a sandwich, me and my friend decided to split this deal.

I got a slice of combination pizza which was large but probably only halfway covered with toppings. The toppings were heavy in mushrooms with most of it densely packed in the front 1/3 of the pizza. It tasted not too bad until I hit the crust which was rock hard. Im guessing the pizzas are inconsistent as well since my other friends got  the combo slice the next day and it looked totally different.

The pile of smoked pastrami was so big, I could only eat half the sandwich and I was hungry after a six mile walk. The sandwich included peppercorns and chips too. That was a nice touch. The restaurant is on the nice Paris rue walkway to the Mirage and was authentically decorated.

That should automatically make me want to give them 1 star and it almost did until I ate the crossant. I hate them but the Crossant was delicious. They get 1 star for the crossant. 

Other than that, it was typical food, like what you'd receive in an airport. The egg basically came from McDonald's. It was bland no flavor. The bacon was decent and crispy. The portions were huge. The Cheese Danish was good (as per my dad). The coffee apparently was terrible. 

There was also horrible construction noise as they were renovating something next door.

4654826,2016-04-20,8,RycZOiohghoI0Ssg2Qqgqw,"In the heart of the Las Vegas Strip dessert J.J's Boulangerie pumps out out of this world tasting dessert. It is really out of this world and in Paris off the Rue de La Paix Shopping Walkway. It is a place where the aroma of baking bread, pizza, and dessert could lead you off the main cobblestone walking path of Paris into a working bakery and restaurant that is modeled after one in Paris, France. 

        Before I continue with the review, here is a trivia question. What does boulangerie mean? The answer is that is the French word for bakery where bread is sold.

      I have stopped at J.J 's Boulangerie for nearly a decade-and-a-half. The majority of the visits were for a light breakfast. I appreciate the remarkable attention to detail in the Paris theme that gives me a unique experience in the desert. Over the years; I have enjoyed looking at the brick interior, vaulted ceiling, display cases of culinary heaven, chefs creating pizza pies, tourists from around the globe united in a Parisan restaurant near the Eiffel Tower, people watching along the high traffic Rue de la Paix. Most of all I enjoy the taste aspect of the boulangerie. 

     This is a self service eateries that is open from 7 AM to the very early morning hours. The food offerings are impressive. They include croissants, pizza, sandwiches, baguettes, salads, scones, pastries, and gelato. The love of my life in this slice of Paris has been their raspberry napoleon. Up to this writing, the J. J's raspberry napoleon is the best dessert that I have had in Las Vegas. I will repeat it again:

 Up to this writing, the J.J's raspberry napoleon is the best dessert that I have had in Las Vegas!!! :-) 

   When I bite into the raspberry napoleon, the taste elevates my taste buds to a state of deliciousness higher than the Eiffel Tower. It is so delicious that I feel like I leave this world and end up in another world like Paris. This dessert that I write so highly about is a creamy puff pastry that is a Paris import. Isn't neat the way the unique hotels with fantastic themes bring great food into Las Vegas? The raspberry napoleon from Paris was originally called the mille-feuille in Paris. It is three layers of puff pastry known as pate feuilletee filled with two sections of flavored pastry cream and topped off with powdered sugar and raspberry touch. 

   The coffee is also superb. I consider it the mystery blend coffee because it is unadvertised. It is a delectable mystery blend coffee that you serve yourself and refill. It is the perfect coffee to go along with delicious food. 

  Over the years, I have ordered other food here. This includes a strawberry shortcake pastry that I rate highly, a vanilla napoleon, and other food. 

  J.J's Boulangerie is a very popular spot in Paris, Las Vegas. It gets way too busy where a line can extend to the Rue de La Paix. Regrettably finding a table is similar to winning a game of chance at the casino. On a good day you can grab a table along the Rue de La Paix. However, on a bad day every table in the two Parisan themed rooms fill up delaying the pastry for another time. I feel that the drop the rating from 5 to 4 star flaw is that their is a want for taking out and insufficient seating. There is a want for a take out bag where customers can carry the food to a nearby bench or any nearby seating place.

   After nearly a decade-and-a-half my heart still beats strong for the raspberry napoleon. As they say in Paris ""je reviendrae"" : I will return.

These pictures include the best dessert that I have had in Las Vegas up to the time of this review : The raspberry napoleon.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,7,4,R99rRXoPffqEmz47xe1pLA

4957989,2016-10-04,0,RycZOiohghoI0Ssg2Qqgqw,"Decent joint to grab a quick sandwich, but like most everything in Vegas, what you pay is greater than what you get.  My buddy and I arrived into town very early on a Thursday morning.  After checking in, we decided to grab some breakfast.  We got into the line for JJ's and it was about a dozen deep.  This isn't so bad, but I only counted 4 employees working while I was there.  One was getting bread and desserts out of the case.  One was operating the register.  2 were working on hot food behind the counter.  This was a recipe for a long wait, which we had. 
 
When I finally made it up to the front of the line, I ordered a sausage, egg, and gouda sandwich on a croissant.  Price with tax was over $11.  I know it's Vegas, and I know it's the Strip, but this was pretty outrageous for what I got.  I sat down and waited less than 10 minutes before my name was called.  The croissant was sort of sliced like a taco or pita with the stuff put inside.  The eggs were scrambled well, they weren't overdone and they were hot and fluffy.  The sausage was overcooked.  It wasn't burnt, but it was tougher than it should have been.  The casing was difficult to bite through.  And, there wasn't much of it.  I would say around 50% of the bites of sandwich had sausage in them.  Now, this may be a good thing given that the sausage was on the dry side and overcooked, but it was annoying to order a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich and get sausage in every other bite.
 
The gouda was cold.  Not room temperature, not chilly, it was cold.  It was clearly just taken out of the fridge and placed on top of the sandwich right before sending it out to the floor.  No warming of any kind.  This threw off the entire sandwich, because instead of the hot eggs and sausage making the cold cheese melt, the cold cheese made everything sort of room temperature.  It was a disappointment to be sure.
 
All of the above said, I would probably return if I stayed at Paris again (which is probably not going to happen, but never say never).  It's quick, and you can get food fairly easily.

I think it's better to order something that's already made here since it takes a little time for the workers to make your sandwich, salad, etc. If I was starving and didn't want to wait for waiter service, I'd stop by again.",Rjd9Td7yYOqu0A1e2KDAyA,0,1,3,TRz72e5i89i6rs_7aLAcjA

I was in breakfast heaven, although considering the size of the croissant sandwich, I should have shared. The croissant was made with real butter, and the eggs were perfectly cooked.

We stopped in on a Friday morning and got a couple sandwiches. The line wasn't too long but it seemed to move incredibly slow.  You place your order at one counter then the order is completed at another.  

Once the order was placed, it probably took a good 20 minutes to get the three sandwiches.  They had only one person making all of the orders which seemed really mismanaged.  I felt terrible for the guy who was trying his hardest to keep up.

We ordered two ham and cheese and one sausage, egg and cheese. The ham and cheese looked decent and had a good amount of ham.  The sausage sandwich was better than expected.  It had a really good, European style sausage and the egg was incredibly soft and airy.  It was actually pretty tasty.

The prices are about on par with Vegas, overpriced but you know that going to Vegas, everything will be.

If you're looking to have a taste of tacky Vegas themed restaurant then JJ's is your best bet to have some Parisian eats.  Around breakfast time, the lines can be long but moves quickly. It's right across from the Le Village Buffet and offers fake outdoor patio seating. My favorite food to order besides the fruity danish and fruity desserts is the smoked salmon baguette. Having had the smoked salmon baguette just wants to wisp you away to Paris France. 

I wish other resorts like Treasure Island, Mirage, Luxor and Excalibur can follow what Paris still holds to its theme. I'm talking about restaurants that fit in with the hotel theme. But anyways, JJ's will always be my go to Parisian eatery at the Paris Hotel. 

I would like to also add that I am a huge fan of their fruit tarts, French eclairs and decadent chocolates.",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,12,11,4,43Dr6fdxEUQ58M7C9MHv6g

EVERYTHING seems to be more expensive unless you're in a dive casino, then it's super cheap. Sorry while I digress, so I ordered the ham, gruyere cheese croissant breakfast sandwich.  $10.95 plus tax. Yes, you read correctly. It's not cheap but it's uber tasty and filling.

The croissant was light and flaky. Stuffed in it was the fluffiest scrambled eggs I've had in a long time. It was covered with slices of smoky ham and tucked around both were slices of gruyere cheese. They wrap it in wax paper for you to go and it's the perfect breakfast sandwich.  Simple yet delectable in taste. I would definitely go back again when I visit Vegas. 

As for their coffee/lattes, I can't say b/c they don't carry soy milk so I had to pass on it. Maybe by the next time I visit,  they will start offering soy milk.",VBG-VBPmxh-xMbrzmzLp-w,6,5,4,yfqjPSo2OJ0kG7EskaY6-w
5514964,2011-03-25,2,RycZOiohghoI0Ssg2Qqgqw,"After landing and checking into our hotels, my buddies and I found ourselves standing in the Paris casino, debating on where to go to fill our stomachs.  Though we were starving after kicking off our day with a couple of rounds of drinks, we couldn't just eat anywhere mind you.  With our snooty, foodie status and exquisitely high standards, we needed to find a place that would fulfill not just one, but TWO important criteria:

1) whatever was quick so we could get another round and gamble, and
2) whatever was closest.

Since we were about 20 ft away from JJ's while pondering what to do, well...they won.

Now, after seeing other reviews, JJ's apparently sells a bunch of pastries and bagels for something light and quick.  To be honest, I have absolutely no idea if that's true.  Maybe they're only around in the morning, or maybe they were there and I just didn't see them, but I was too focused on getting my hands on their hot Italian Deli sandwich.

Loaded with salami, ham, provolone, lettuce, and tomatoes, this is one hefty sandwich.  For about $9, you get a near footlong PACKED with all this meaty, tasty deliciousness.  Quite a good deal considering where you're at and what you're getting.  The toasty, crusty bread they use seals the deal, but it would still taste so good even if they didn't.  So much better than a $5 footlong from Subway.

Since one of my buddies ordered the cold prosciutto sandwich and then remembered that he doesn't like prosciutto, I felt bad and swapped halves with him.  Now, if you are a fan of prosciutto, this is the sandwich for you.  This thing was literally overflowing with meat from beginning to end (also had provolone, tomato, and lettuce in it).  I didn't think it was quite as good as the Italian Deli, but it held its own.  Not sure if my sodium tolerance could take eating a whole one though.

The bulk of their menu consisted of the sandwiches, as well as salads and pizzas, but I would probably skip the latter.  Although I didn't actually try it, it didn't look nearly as appetizing as some of the photos on here would make it.  Well, one in particular at least; the cheese and pepperoni just kind of blotted together into an oily-ish mess.  In any case, considering we went again the next day for that Italian Deli sandwich...I'd say it's a good bet we'll be back next time.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,7,5,4,II4BgGFFKYpZeI4V1mZJTg

I bought a croissant and their Parisian Blend coffee. The croissant wasn't even as great as a grocery store croissant. I'd had a cheese danish last time and I remember it was amazing. To me it seemed more Euro-style (rich and heavy on the butter, great texture). The coffee was probably the worst I've ever had actually, sour and old. I threw it out and refilled from another of the dispensers and that one was actually palatable, although still shamefully weak and tasteless. 

A place like this - although touristy and 'fake Paris-y' - should at least deliver on their staple stuff like coffee and croissants. I'd only return if I have to.",Svj0Mi7FS9pN2CGBSH-Bug,1,1,2,QO-t8QGliPLDFilBHrs1WQ
