The atmosphere is unpretentious and modern. The staff is pleasant and happy. The prices are fair. The food I had was yummy. The coffee is very good, and, yes (believe it of not) they allow you to add the sweetener yourself.  There was none of that ""we can do it better than you"" attitude like at PublicUs or that ""we tell you where to sit"" shtick you get at Makers and Finders.

I'm a bit of a coffee snob from Washington and I've  visited roasters all over the nation. But this place annoys even me. It's the kind of shop that grimaces when you ask for vanilla in your latte and says ""we don't really do flavors, but their some some syrup over there.""

They try to act experienced because they roast and have a trendy space. But it reality it's an excuse to have their largest coffee be 12 oz and act like that's special because "" they use 2 shots"" and say we only offer one size.

Vesta does. If I refer to this place as ""Vespa"" when you are around me, I apologize, but thats what I call it :D

The shining star here for me is an unsweetened macadamia nut mylk latte. It's amazing.

Second place award goes to unsweetened matcha latte sub out the milk with the macadamia nut mylk and call it a day. 

Their pour overs and coffee and nitro is simply amazing. The Donut Bar even carries their coffee!

Support a local roaster and buy local.

The service is outstanding and the owner is always in to greet you. Toast and sando menu is small and I think they should keep it that way.

Clean and open the place is usually packed. Not sure why people think this is hipster and overpriced. This is not a chain and fresh, quality, local ingredients represent.

If you are coming here to look for $2 coffee, skip everyone the waste of time with your ""its overpriced"" reviews. Move along because there is nothing to see here :D

1482316,2017-02-19,0,4Nj2ktP2NjCbv2aKeH3ZBg,"Visiting Las Vegas for the weekend we decided to venture out for breakfast and happened to park right outside Vesta. The glass panels gave a great view from outside and we immediately knew this place was worth a visit for coffee so returned the following day.

Inside it's spacious and seating is comfortable. There are several options for seating from small tables (that can easily be grouped if you have more than a few people) to a long bar across the front window and the smaller bar seating where you can stare at the friendly people making coffee. 

Everything in Vesta appears to be new, and either wood, concrete, or white porcelain. Very chic and simple decor theme. Surprisingly thoughtful inclusion of sound damping on the ceiling means that the otherwise mostly-concrete interior is still quiet enough for conversation without having to strain your ears or increase speaking volume to compete with others. And - the chairs have rubber feet. Attention to detail matters - thanks to the interior designer of Vesta!

The menu has a bunch of creative chai-like and high-end coffee selections, and I found great explanations were available to help us decide what to get. Amazing beverages were served in nice cups. This place is definitely keeping things in the high-end bracket on every front.

There was a mix of young and old here. Some working on laptops, most just having conversations. One group had put their coffees on the floor and was taking photos - I have no idea wtf that was about but I guess it takes all sorts.

Bathrooms were really nice too. 

Parking was easy, this area has plenty of free spots right outside or no more than a minute walk away. 

Soooo... why not 5 stars? No water station and no outside seating. I've always found great convenience in being able to fill up a water glass. Not sure if that omission is a local thing, but I missed it. I had to ask twice before being able to get water. The weather today was perfect for sitting outside, but their are no tables or chairs on the sidewalk here. This is a tiny nit-pick though as the service and everything else about this place was actually outstanding in every other interaction.

1694612,2017-01-08,3,4Nj2ktP2NjCbv2aKeH3ZBg,"Barebones urban chic, that describes Vesta. Someone took a garage, swept it out, installed some clean concrete, real wood countertops, large roasters and street-view windows, and thus opened a coffee shop.

Their location is primo, settled into another side-street of the arts district. By virtue of that, Vesta (though new) already attracts a steady stream of the ilk who flock to First Fridays or who are permanent residents of the neglected and oft forgotten Las Vegas arts scene. That's right: Vesta is a good fit for anyone wanting a quick cup, but especially those young 20/30-somethings who are in search of a ""coffee hangout"" in this part of town more than they are a ""coffee experience.""

I had a macchiato, which though somewhat petit, was well-crafted, not bitter. Accompanying was a bowl of their soup of the day, a carrot ginger, just what my congested sinuses needed. Due to the latter, I can't comment much on the taste, but the texture and temperature were right on, ready for dipping the included bread sides. 
On said bread, the melted cheese was somewhat unappealing, its bright orange hue overpowering the muted color of the soup. If I souped here again, I'd ask for toast plain. 

There are no creature comforts or unique styles here that make Vesta remarkable, but the prices are right, the location key, the interior sparse but clean, and the taste of the things is fine. They make an effort to remember your name on the first visit which is neighborly, but you must collect your own food and drink when it's ready. There's no pastry display, so if you want a plain croissant, for example, you must order a croissant-meal from the menu. Thankfully, you can get one for $4.

So, a-ok overall. It just needs an ounce of character injected, or a little extra je ne sais quoi to ensure people make them a habit. Until then, I'll be back on a First Friday when in need of a quality grab-n-go.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,5,4,3,7stDyGb7J58Vo3_PHIOmSQ

Their lattes are okay, but their regular coffees and pour overs are more their forte. The breakfast croissant is huge, flaky, and nicely seasoned like an everything-flavored bagel. I like that their fromage blanc (and other menu items) is made in house but wish it had a touch more flavor and portion. The avocado toast is decent, but better with the added egg. Chia pudding is a pretty solid version too, with fresh fruit and lots of flavor.

I then taste tested them alongside Starbucks Cafe Verona blend, French Roast, and Italian Roast. The Starbucks beans were superior in flavor, body, and overall Satisfaction. It could be that the beans haven't had a chance to mellow, but the cup produced by both Vesta brands under the same exact conditions (Vaccum press, 30 grams of beans, 250 ml water at 190) were inferior flavor to the Starbucks brands.

A refreshingly open space, gorgeous soft lighting, friendly vibes, amazing coffee roasted in-house - does this sound hipster enough yet? Although Vesta has only been open for a few weeks, this dog-friendly establishment has already exceeded my expectations (mostly because adorable dogs grace my presence while I'm doing my work tbh).

Being my go-to place to work on my laptop, there are several outlets along the bar and on the walls if I ever need to charge up. Parking is not an issue since there's a lot right next to the building, but there is a lot of street parking as well. Just be weary when you're parked on the street for more than 2 hours because you may get a parking ticket if your timing is unfortunate!

What I've Had:

Three-Kings Pour Over - 5/5 // $5.50
If you need to stay up until 4AM, DRINK THIS. With a blend of 3 different origins from Ethiopia, this will surely give you the energy to get sh*t done. I'm still learning a lot about coffee, but its airy body makes it feel lighter and smoother than a regular drip. If you've never tried the pour over method and you're trying to get through your day, I highly recommend trying it.

All The Things - 5/5 // $4.00
Everything seasoned croissant w/ house-made fromage blanc (a.k.a. french-style fresh cheese). I haven't had a ton of croissants in my life, but this croissant has been the best croissant I've ever had in my entire life. Its texture was the right amount of softness and flakiness and the house-made fromage blanc paired so well with it.

Sweet Dream - 4/5 // $4.50
A simple and sweet dessert of nutella, almonds, coconut, and himalayan salt on a sourdough toast. It's a lovely sweet fix from the menu, but I didn't think it was amazingly spectacular.

Sooner or later, I'll probably try everything because I'll be coming here so often. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, the friendly staff is sure to help you!",8RuySv_b1YVWVK_0mMqKOw,36,27,5,OusI-uND-GVLfYwLsQcRVg

unfortunately, i was left with not much more than the bitterness from the coffee.

the coffee itself is good.  everyone's palate is different when it comes to coffee.  i personally prefer my coffee to taste a little bit deep, a lot dark, very nutty, a bit chocolaty, and very smooth.  vesta makes a coffee that's a bit more fruity, light, tart, and extremely bitter.

the hubs and i went out of our way to come here because i was so excited to have a true coffee roaster here in vegas.  when we arrived, we were immediately impressed with the space and loved the atmosphere.  we were in the middle of ordering when a very rude guy interrupted us and began a rather lengthy conversation with the cashier about his blog or whatever and she just ignored us until i spoke up and said ""i'll also have...""  no apology, no nothing.  just rude.

we were a bit hungry so we ordered a couple of sandwiches.  i ordered what they call the hawaiian benedict.  and as most people know a benedict is an open faced sandwich with a poached egg and hollandaise.  my ""benedict"" was a regular sandwich, with an overcooked egg, undercooked spam, and some sort of weird sriracha mayo spread thing served with what i can only assume were ruffles potato chips.  and it cost $7.  sorry but i'd much rather go down the street to goodwich where i can get a crazy good sandwich for the same price.

i really wanted to love it here but i just wasn't impressed and i won't be going out of my way to come here again.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,5,1,2,uhf5K2Ko7W7Di4HQF3qwhQ

The service is fast (a rarity for LV craft coffee) and always genuinely welcoming. Today we walked in [unwittingly] after closing.

Don't worry when you walk in and see all the MacBook laden bearded hipsters.  They don't bite and are actually kinda fun to people watch.   I'd been wanting to check this place out for some time and since we were in the neighborhood (sorta) we made a quick run in.

So, I'll start with parking. We came in a Sunday & parking was easy. I believe they have a small shared lot to the south of the building but there was plenty of parking on the street.

Building/ walking through the door/ Interior design: Simple facade design & signage. Good finishes with no crazy elaboration. Very nice. As you walk in, big open space with views to the coffee roaster at the end. Industrial chic. Easy to find the register without any interior signage. No menu boards but they have paper menus at the register for ordering. There's an queue area if need be to the left of register. Love the patterned use of subway tile. Simple black/ white / warm wood design. May need a little pop of color but possibly with future artwork. Low chairs are comfortable but as a person w/ back problems, stools w/ no backs are not my thing. And I always harp restaurants/ bars should have purse hooks, especially when backless stools are provided at counters.

Service: the kids behind the counter are very friendly, nice & helpful. They welcome you as you walk in the door. They also helped me decide to order a cappuccino. 

Food: my boyfriend ordered an egg/ cheese sandwich & he said it was very good. I ordered a savory avocado tartine/ toast & it needs help!!! It has great potential but the mainstay of the toast, the avocado was NOT RIPE. It was hard & tasteless. And it was supposed to have salt (Himalayan) but I tasted none. If all the elements of the toast worked, I'd highly recommend. So if you order, ask if the avocado is ripe. 

Coffee: Delish! Albeit, because of health reasons, I drink decaf and there was none (yet, but soon I was told- #1 request from patrons). But coffee was VERY GOOD.

The atmosphere had a hipster vibe. A lot of people were on their laptops or reading a book. It was quiet, staff was friendly and the place was pretty calm and chill. Natural lighting filled up the room. Tables and chairs can be difficult to get if you come during peak hours. We took the last two empty seats in the restaurant located up on the bar top.

I ordered the Hawaiian Benedict Sandwich. Came out pippin hot, fresh and flavorful. Pretty big portion too. It came with a small side of chips. Boyfriend order the sausage breakfast sandwich. He enjoyed it and honestly, I liked his a bit better. I wasn't a big fan of the over easy egg on my Hawaiian benedict sandwich...it was super runny. 

For drinks, I ordered the macadamia almond latte that everyone orders. I guess that's their specialty drink, am I right? It was alright...not sure if the caffeine is strong enough because I didn't taste any hint of it. To me, it taste like almond milk, it had a thick consistency unlike most lattes. Boyfriend got this berry hibiscus looking tea.

 I wanted to love Vesta and their hipster vibes so much especially after hearing their story and reading all the fantastic reviews on here.  They are just trying too hard to fit a mold that doesn't work for everyone.  
I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous so I ordered my favorite drink to try at a new shop, a nonfat vanilla latte.  The barista told me that they did not have nonfat milk so I asked for soy instead.  He somewhat rudely said ""nope"" and then asked if I drink any nut milks.  I finally settled on almond milk which was fine.  He then told me that they do not have vanilla flavor either.  I asked what they did have and he told me they only have simple syrup (nothing more than sugar/water to any coffee lover) or a cardamom simple syrup.  I asked him what was in their Macadamia-Almond latte because that was what my friend was drinking.  He was obviously getting frustrated and informed me that both the macadamia nut and almond flavors are just milks made from those nuts.  I settled on that drink which let me down severely.  Coffee, nut-milk, different nut-milk, simple syrup.  Not impressed.  I completely understand letting the coffee stand out or whatever but this drink was straight up not good; ruined by the simple syrup alone.

My morning does not feel complete without a cup of black coffee - no bullshit (aka cream & sugar to mask the subpar flavor of something like Folgers)
I was in downtown staying at a nearby hotel for the Super Bowl weekend with some family members, and I NEEDED to find a legit coffee place that preferably roasted their own beans
Enter Vesta Coffee Roasters!  They exceeded my expectations and sustainably source their coffee from all over the world
Thank you yelp gods, yet again for leading me to a quality coffee place in Las Vegas
My husband and I loved their coffee so much that we came here (no joke) three mornings in a row just to get our morning caffeine dose.
I am a fan of their pour over Guatemala roast, and my husband prefers something fruity and acidic like Kenya or an Ethiopian roast

This place is super hipster/industrial in decor, in a quiet street in downtown Las Vegas.  I also love that they offered matcha here too!  In three days, we tried three of their pour overs, nitro cold brew, the macadamia nut almond milk latte, and matcha latte.  All drinks were great!  We even took extra on our last day their because we knew we needed extra caffeine for the road driving back to San Diego.  I now know where to come next time I'm in Las Vegas.

Vesta does everything there from roasting to brewing to serving up a friendly smile. This place has their stuff together.
Staff seems to remember me which is really nice. I see most of the same employees there so I know they are happy and that speaks wonders. 
The place is always clean, i don't think I've ever seen it a mess. Very urban/hipster vibes when you walk in. They let dogs hang out there if on leashes of course. Just kind of all flows well.
I love their hot blend. It's sooooo amazing. Usually I add milk to my coffee but this is too good to add anything to. A huge flavor boost in my mouth. For me to drink it black says a lot. They have some simple food options but nothing too crazy. Just light snacks and sandwiches.

The coffee is very very strong, I could definitely feel the expresso kick in--which is rare because of my coffee addiction. The chia bowl was tasty too, but there was a spice in there throwing it off a little for me. I wish their menu was as big as Makers & Finders or PublicUS. 

Not a fan of the silverware. I don't expect fine china, but it looked/felt cheap, almost like it would give you a rash if you were allergic to the metal.

From the friendly baristas to delicious coffee makes this place a great place to hangout with friends or work/study. This converted garage-like space into a cafe with its modern and streamlined decor makes it appealing for all generation despite the crowd is full of Millennials and the upcoming young Generation Z.

Their Macadamia Almond Latte is simply delicious and balanced, not too sweet. The milk & honey toast was really good and was a balanced flavor of sweetness and savory. Paired well with my latte. Another noteworthy drink is the Matcha Latte, which was subtle in flavor and not watered down like other cafes.

Another cool aspect of this cafe is the in house roasting machine. Very few cafes promote locally roasted coffee beans but this particular cafe takes pride in their coffee. I would also suggest sitting at the bar, which allows a great way to watch the baristas prepare your delicious hand-crafted drink or the cook preparing a delicious meal or snack.

When I asked Daniel about going here, he said that he was quite sure that his wife, Minky, would love the croissants...and she did!  She said that this was her favorite meal of our entire trip!

The bonuses of Vesta is the free parking lot, the convenient restroom, the fruit-infused water dispenser, and the friendly service!  The sunlight was warming up the environment, so the shade was pulled down for the customers. Daniel noted the garage door opening on the side of the large room which was converted to blend into the decor!  Cool!

Daniel and I split the Vesta Breakfast Sandwich and the Truffle Croissant Sandwich...yum!  I enjoyed the flakiness of the croissant and the heartiness of the Breakfast Sandwich. I was more hungry than thirsty, so the self-serve fruit-infused water was just right for me!

3877250,2018-03-07,1,4Nj2ktP2NjCbv2aKeH3ZBg,"I completely agree with Vesta's origin story, that it was created out of necessity. Vegas was completely devoid of a truly great independent coffee roaster until Vesta. Vesta not only fills that void, but created a wonderful space in DTLV. The coffee shop is a vision of what all local coffee shops aspires to. I love the interior that is brightly lit with the clear panels of their garage door to the showcasing of their roaster. 

As for the coffee itself, I am blown away by how good not only their espresso is, but also their specialty lattes. The macadamia-almond latte is probably my favorite as I love nutty flavors. They show so much restraint with the sugar and syrup as the bold coffee and nutty flavors really come through first. The hazelnut latte is more subtle in flavor. I have yet to try the matcha latte, which is next on my list, but I did try the Golden Milk, which was not my cup of tea. That's not to say that it wasn't good, but I don't think turmeric drinks are ready for prime time, but I appreciate that it's on the menu for those who enjoy it. 

Another favorite of mine is their tartine toast, which goes wonderfully with their coffees. I initially was a big fan of the sweet dream, which had a wonderful balance of nutella, almonds, coconut, and Himalayan salt, but my new favorite is the milk & honey. I love the house-fromage blanc, topped with honey and cinnamon.

I also decided to order the avocado toast with a poached egg and it really was the perfect size breakfast.

We ordered a matcha latte with a tad of simple syrup to sweeten up the heavy glassy notes of the matcha powder. A cortado was also ordered, delicious with its dark, yet creamy texture, packing a highly caffeinated punch. Two avocado toasts, one with a poached egg, sprinkled with red pepper flakes, was the perfect brunch pabulum for the lively conversation that would be our usual talkfest. 
The neighborhood of Vegas named The Arts District, is slowly trying to revamp itself into a more sophisticated, cultivated area that supports the arts, small businesses, restaurants and coffee shops.

I'm a little indifferent about the location. There's a small parking lot and additional street parking, so if it's busy, you might have to drive around to find some parking like we did. Even so, we found a street parking spot within 5 minutes, so it's not really a hassle.

If you are a coffee aficionado, you'll appreciate the attention to detail Vesta applies to their drip.  First off, as their name implies, they roast on site, which is an art in itself.  Their grind size is on point and looks like they use ChemEx (or similar) glass dripper.  Everything in the establishment is clean (clean is good).  I watched the person making my coffee and noticed he let the grinds 'bloom' first before pouring more hot water (in a spiral motion).  I consider this a more advanced move and unexpected from an retail place where queues can get long.

I love that they do offer vegan options, especially their housemade macadamia almond milk. The inside is very spacious and simple in decor. Overall, the food and drinks are yummy, but the service needs some work still. 

The first time I came here, I asked the cashier for her recommendation so I ended up getting the Vesta breakfast sandwich without meat ($7), and today I just realized that's the exact same thing as the cheese & egg sandwich ($5) just $2 more! The cashier should have just told me to get the cheese & egg sandwich! I'm going to assume just that one employee isn't up to par. After a month of being open, I feel that all staff should know all of the menu items, especially since there aren't that many. Also today, I was told that the only sweetener they had was simple syrup by the cashier. After I sat down with my latte, I asked another employee that was walking around and she clarified that they DO have honey! Again, maybe some employees just need more training. 

I wish they had more coffee choices/flavors, but maybe that's coming in the future? Hopefully! I have tried their matcha latte with nut milk and their macadamia almond latte. Both were very good and recommendable. The breakfast sandwich and their avocado toast were great as well.

We also needed a break from the loud gaudy Vegas scene. I found this location on Yelp and gave it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised with this coffee shop. They roast their own and have some tasty breakfast treats. The interior is minimalist and the staff super friendly. It is a wide open modern interior but very comfortable. Lots of local regulars and a few interesting characters to keep it authentic. I could easily see myself being a fixture at this coffee shop.

I enjoyed the Aztec mocha (double shot, half of normal amount of chocolate with almond milk) and breakfast sandwich three days in a row. Absolutely delicious. I would go back in an instant the next time I am in town. The only reason I am giving them a four instead of a five is because they need to pull their espresso a little longer. It is a bit on the sour side. Beyond that little mis-step they are awesome.

Parking: plenty of parking in the private lot, some street parking. The neighborhood appears to be in transformation and I loved the architectural details popping up. The bar across the street definitely has some cool details. 

Ambience: super chill, low key. This is a place you can comfortably work at and also have a good time catching up with friends. The space is laid out very nicely with room to spare. I found myself wishing for a cozy armchair but then I'd fall asleep and maybe they don't want that hahaha! The customer service is also beyond! They're really attentive, warm and friendly. This is definitely the neighborhood vibe we all want to experience. 

Food/Drink: completely on point! I had the hazelnut latte and it was delicious. I also tried the avocado toast which was on Tartine bread and you know how we SFers get down for our bread. My fave thing though was the ham/cheese croissant galette. I could eat that everyday. They also have fruit infused water available.

You can pretty much find a coffee shop with well trained baristas on every corner in seattle so I came here with high expectations. Went to several sub par coffee shops in the area until I found this little gem. The atmosphere 5, people and staff 5, coffee 5, talent of baristas 5. The only reason I gave them 4 stars overall is because they don't have soy milk and I realize this is a purist thing to do but I have dietary restrictions. Also they don't have punch cards or reward system. Also place is not very kid friendly if you come with children. What made up for it was when I brought in my toddler Tyler made up a drink that was not on the menu for my little guy. Thanks Tyler!

When I walk in to a coffee shop and they don't know what a cortado is, I usually walk out. I came to Vesta and asked for a Gibraltar and they made it with perfection.

What the....!?!  Beans are roasted on property?!  I love supporting local retailers and these beans are bomb.com!!  They are perfectly roasted, somewhat mild, not overly dark or burnt tasting like that ""star..."" place.  

Vesta has a nice selection of drinks and food to choose from.  We were only here to buy a few pounds of beans for home and to get yet another iced latte.  I can't talk specifically on the food.  What I can say is that the menu options looked great!  They had a corn chowder for the soup of the day...looked YUM to me!

There is plenty of parking out front and a dedicated parking lot that was full just to the south of the coffee shop.  Vesta is located off Charleston and Casino Center.  Lots of seating inside too!  Staff was genuinely friendly and outgoing.  I can't wait to swing by for lunch one of these days!

5228705,2017-02-27,5,4Nj2ktP2NjCbv2aKeH3ZBg,"The Yelp Book Club had its first meeting of 2017 here at Vesta on Saturday. 

This spot was chosen because: 
1.  I'd seen photos of the Matcha Latte, and was dying to try it.
2.  They have vegan options.
3. Location, Location, Location.

I'm torn on the rating to give Vesta...I keep switching from 3 to 4, and back to three stars.  
I think for now, I'm going to stick  with 4, because besides a few minor inconveniences, I really enjoyed my visit.

So first and foremost: HUGE props to the place for having parking that is not metered.  The parking lot is a little small, but we were able to park with no issue. 

Vesta is a cute spot, Its extremely minimalist in decor, which is kind of a ""meh"" for me.  The chairs aren't comfortable.  If you're on the fluffier side of the spectrum, they're a little small.  They do have high stools though, but those aren't super comfy either.   There isn't a ton of seating...but the vibe here is good.   

The employees were super upbeat, and friendly.  I had questions about a couple of the items, and got answers with no attitude or anything.  

They roast on site, which I love.  I didn't try their house coffee this time, but definitely plan to go back again to try a pour over or two, and maybe even pick up a bag of beans.  

The drinks are made without sweeteners, so if you want sugar/stevia, you'll have to ask to have the drink sweetened.  If its not sweetened to your liking, there is a station with packets so you can sweeten to your own taste.

The menu isn't overwhelming, which I like a lot.  Like the decor, its pretty minimalist, but even being a small menu, there's something for everyone, and a lot of variety. 

This visit we tried: 
Matcha Latte:  Culinary grade matcha with whole milk:  this was really good.  Something about matcha makes me think of freshly mown grass, but only the aroma.  The flavor is delicious, and super refreshing.  I'm not usually one for tea lattes, but I liked this a lot.  Latte art was on point!  I had asked for sweetener, and found it a little under sweet for my taste, but I really like that...they don't add a ton of sugar to your drink.  It didn't need too much more to be the way I wanted it.    

Aztec Hot Chocolate: This was awesome.  Raw cacao with whole milk and chile, mmmmm.  Spicy and delicious.  I don't know if my fella got it sweetened or not, but it was delicious.  

""All the Things"":  An everything bagel, but instead of a bagel, its a croissant!  Buttery.  Delicious.  Served with a house made ""fromage blanc""...which in French is white cheese, but this was more like an unsalted butter...maybe it had cheese in it?  Like a cream cheese?  Either way, it was really good.  Delicious. 

My partners in books both got the avocado toast, one with a poached egg on top.  It looked amazing.  I didn't get to try it due to my allergy, but...seriously, this is a sexy dish.  

All in all, it was a good experience.  I definitely want to come back to try some of their house roasted coffee, and some more of the food offerings.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,10,6,4,kCHG249CFW48hY1zmr1luA

It has a vet open, bright environment. Very simple in its design, but put together in a very attractive, communal sort of way. The music is A+, by the way. 

I came in for the Macadamia Nut Latte, but was sad I didn't come with an appetite. My coffee was delicious, lightly sweetened, as requested. The espresso was the star of the drink, very smooth, yet present in the drink. The macadamia was more of a complimenting flavor, and a great one at that. 

My friend ordered an egg sandwich that was dripping syrup. I almost ordered one, even though I was full from breakfast still. It looked amazing, and my friend practically inhaled it, he liked it so much.

COFFEE: Their macadamia almond milk latte is great but for the past few times I've tried it, the coffee flavor isn't very pronounced which I look for in my coffee. I did really enjoy the hazelnut latte that comes with rosemary maple syrup and would love to come back to order it again.

I was a little concerned driving in because parking is limited to a small lot behind the building (half of which are reserved for apartment owners and other businesses) and the street spots, while free, were being utilized for an ""Antique Car Show Sunday"" Show. But, I arrived just before 9am and by 10am, those cars were cleared. And on the plus side, all this parking is FREE. 

Since it is impolite to touch tarot cards with greasy hands, I opted not to order food, but Heather got an egg and cheese muffin that truly looked like gourmet cheesy goodness. 

This is definitely the kind of place where every barista will know your name! Additionally, there is a decent amount of seating and plenty of space between the tables, so if you're coming here to get work down, you've got room to spread out!

And lots of delicious high-quality breakfast goodies like the salmon on Ricotta toast with dill that I'm enjoying!

I seek this place out every time!",UWfSqnvRWH4ywwdNlwQ46g,1,1,5,rvIgkNh6Z5NcWNsypZ1MPg

I literally rolled out of bed, threw on some yoga pants and a bulky sweater, rocked a top knot, and made my way in to post up and get some work done. There is some street parking right in front and a little side lot. Very convenient for people like me who love the luxury of working from a cafe, but despise the two hour parking limits or paid parking all about the city.

The decor inside is sleek and simple. Tables, bar tops, roaster in the back. It's like coffee heaven. They have a variety of teas and espresso drinks that will satisfy almost any craving for caffeine. The staff is eclectic, cool, and very kind. I heard them welcome nearly every guest by name, so it's clear that they take great care of strangers and regulars alike. It was my first time in, and I was guided through their hot tea selections with great care. I ordered a pot of their herbal tea (forgive me, but I don't recall what she said the name was) because I wanted something calming. I received their wi-fi password and dove straight into work.

Vesta has a steady stream of guests coming and going, so people watching is a major plus of the location. I opted to stay for several hours so I ended up heading back to the counter for an order of their soup of the day, Vegetable Chili with toast. The chili was full of a variety of beans and the toast was browned just enough to add crunch and sprinkled with a light dusting of white crumbled cheese.

I'm already planning my next morning to post up and get caffeinated. .",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,19,14,5,c91vlvr-T77rziN6apRhUA

The environment is open casual and comfortable. This little arts district is peaceful and uncrowded off the strip and walking distance to downtown. 

Looking forward to returning on next visit.",eOKQlI8wYpkM_A1Y2VojXA,0,0,5,TPNmb9h10EtdpUhNsKzsGQ

I live in Nashville where independent coffee shops outnumber Starbucks, and it is taken very seriously. Vesta can absolutely compete with my top 2 in Nashville. I will come again next time I'm in Vegas. Oh!  And get the breakfast tacos if they are the special of the day. So delicious!!!",LaAFCETggjSGm-ZVE97VsQ,1,0,5,4yWGCgN8aqh7tqt8_fDPFg

One downside is the smell. They don't have hoods over their cook station, and their windows aren't always open, so the place smells of grease and smoke. The smell stays on my clothes every time I leave. 

If they could get the air circulation handled, this would probably be a regular stop on our Vegas trips!",JfSZw_3FulzKhSnaXopoEg,1,1,4,OM6mFzeWrdAsruPTXk-bpA
