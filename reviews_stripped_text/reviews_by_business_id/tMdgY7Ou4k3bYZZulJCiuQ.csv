Had THE COMPLICATED ORDER sandwich and THE BIZNESS Salad.  Both selection are some of the best eats I have had in Vegas EVER!!

Went here 3 days in a row during a trip to Vegas and was delighted by the incredible food and friendly staff each day! :) 

SETTING:
Located in the LGBTQ Community Center and very inviting and clean. I was pleasantly surprise by the modern design/furniture and constant flow of traffic. Plenty of seating and not crowded feeling at all.

FOOD:
Amazing for vegans and meat eaters alike!
The sandwiches, pitas, salads, soups, smoothies, coffee...tried them all and was very pleased with all of them. I don't think there is a single flaw in the menu! 

All around an amazing cafe that you need to check out! Wish there was one near me...too bad only 1 exists.",hDV-nmq23fU9KdcbacSRuQ,0,0,5,7y9p55BAtpHv3umGOfwiyw

I never write reviews.  I mean, ever.  But I feel that these guys deserve a review, no, they deserve praise!

The food was exquisite and the service was superb.  Imagine a small sandwich shop with four star food and service couple with a hip atmosphere. Truly an experience you have to see for yourself.

I had a sandwich called ""miss piggy"".  An appropriate name for hardy meets healthy.  I never thought healthy can be both scrumptious and filling.  I can still taste it and can't wait to try it again.

I tell everyone I know about this truly under-rated cafe/restaurant I have ever encountered.  Somehow, I feel enriched by the experience.

- We took a Mocha Latte and a Hot chocolate. Both were terrible, any coffee from the 7-11 next door would have been better.
- Also, there pastries look like home-made (a little messy), but are just average in taste.
- The prices are high for bad quality beverages.
- The coffee place doesn't have its own place, it is shared with the Center Lobby, which means : you're just sitting in a place with a lot of coming and going of people not even taking anything in the coffee.
- You keep seeing the center officer reprimanding people in the space for not sitting right or whatever, like in a Library.
- There was a Wifi access point that said Bronze Cafe but that one was ""not open to the public"" ... so, you had to use the center Wireless, which doesn't work that well.

Well, if you want to relax, this coffee doesn't deserve the effort. You can have a better experience by taking a coffee at the 7-11 and enjoying the free wifi and seats at the Center in front of Bronze Cafe, or simply by looking to one of the numerous better places !",XwLfgaJZemm5UofnXJgQLQ,5,3,1,Oj9aCeZlIjhBZMnW4UJHfQ

One thing I do object to is that the plant based sandwiches are a dollar MORE than the animal sandwiches (which makes absolutely no logical sense).  AND charging $3 extra for 1/2 c of diced seitan.  Too much nickle and diming for my liking.

I love the brussel sprouts too, perfect combo of sweet and sour. 
I always giggle loudly when they ask if they can toss my husband's salad.
There is nothing like waking up early, grabbing some grub from here and going on a hike or a day trip.

It did not disappoint, it had bacon jam which was slightly sweet, maple bacon and plenty of it, lettuce tomato and some sort of aioli.  It also came with a small side salad which was just spinach, however it was tossed in a light, slightly tangy lemon vinaigrette which was ever so good. The price was a little over $9. The drinks are a little pricey, $1.50 for a can of soda or $1.95 for water or San Pell which I had. But I guess you can't have everything. I was also surprised by how crowded it was, we got the last table. There are couches as it is a community center that were free.

I opted for the soup of the day - fresh veggies and kale, along with the California Turkey sandwich (Turkey breast, avocado, mixed greens, tomato, red onion, basil aioli, lemon vinaigrette, on Ciabatta bread). What's the word for 100 times more than just yummy! The sandwich came with mixed greens - so tasty and fresh I imagined they were picked today.

Kale can be bitter, but the seasoning and texture of the soup brought out its best flavor. They had an intriguing method for making coffee (which I hardly ever drink). Ice cubes in a glass container dripped water over coffee grounds, which then filled a coffee pot. I couldn't resist. And since I drink coffee so rarely I had to get a dessert to go with it - right? 

A mango cookie with a dollop of apricot in its center seemed like a good choice and - just to make sure I ate every crumb - stuffed as I was - it was heated slightly so it was just a teeny bit soft and oh so marvelously delicious. 

The service matched the food. Everyone couldn't be nicer, more knowledgable about every detail of the products, and eager to make your experience memorable. Though I had black coffee, I was offered home made almond milk - a first for me. Should have had a glass of that - but I'll save that for the next time. Lots more on the menu for me to enjoy.

One last word - this spot is owned by a gay couple and is located in the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada. Didn't bother me in the least, I found the atmosphere quite friendly and welcoming - but if that puts you off - sorry to say you'll be missing a really good meal.",3IJBR4zpeHtYxzRFuBMCxw,4,2,5,lTG6x3np2YF4D0atmqbvqw

885486,2014-02-15,0,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,I ordered from here and was very pleased. This place has some of the best and freshest food consistently. They have a great selection of healthy fare. It is a little difficult to find it in the community center but well worth the effort. One of my top 5 restaurants in Las Vegas that wont break the bank. The food is just so good you can't pick something you wont like and they have a nice eclectic menu. The juices are great as well. This place is just hands down wonderful.,EszAdfLgeTdcMCahcYxyGA,0,0,5,fCnM88binqNocgVjHidc1g

955073,2017-06-14,0,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"There was a seminar being held at my daughter's college about a month ago, and this cafe made an appearance, offering free sandwiches and desserts. My daughter was able to taste their ""What What?"" sandwich and one of their cookies. She loved it so much! She'd been raving about their food for an entire month, before we decided to go last Friday.

As you may know, this establishment is a big supporter and advocate of the LGBTQ community, which, I am, as well. Their restrooms are gender neutral, allowing for men and women to access the facility simultaneously (there are multiple stalls). 

The Bronze cafe, is, I'm my opinion, located in a rather hidden spot. You could drive by the place as I did and miss it because nothing screams- Gourmet Sandwich spot! The building, itself is pretty nice. The inside is very clean and cozy. There are sofas, cushioned, single chairs, as well as dining tables throughout the place. Computers and a sizeable library is also located within the premises of the restaurant. 

So, on to the food. I mentioned above that my daughter suggested the 'What what?"" sandwich. It comes with turkey, pepperoni, red onion, tomato, greens, basil Aoli, oregano vinaigrette, and it's served on toasted ciabatta bread. We both ordered one, however I requested avocado be added to mine. The addition was an extra $1 charge. I'm not used to eating sandwiches without mayo, so I asked if they had any, and I was told that they had a vegan mayo. I decided to just go without it.

My daughter and I chose to sit in the sofa area to wait on our food. We waited only a few minutes before being told our order was ready. Awesome!!!! We opened the bag containing our sandwiches and they had been placed in these cute little brown boxes!!! Different. Unique.

I go to eat my sandwich and about 1/4 of the way through, I bite down on something hard. It's a toothpick, but in looking at the sandwich up close, you can't see it. And I know that toothpicks are often placed in sandwiches, burgers and the like, to hold them together. But, I felt it should have been visible prior to eating. Anyways, because I couldn't see how the toothpick was placed (I'd already pulled it out when I bit into the sandwich) I thought maybe it was just misplaced. But, then my daughter began to eat her sandwich and she too bit down on it, unaware of there being a toothpick in it. I continued to eat and there was a total of 4 (hidden) toothpicks. So, this is just a heads up. Also, with the sandwich comes a small side of greens (possibly green leaf lettuce?) which tasted so fresh and delicious with the side of vinaigrette they give you.

In summary, we loved the sandwiches. Soooo good! Would definitely recommend and I'd go out of my way to go again. Great, fast customer service, friendly employees, fresh, good tasting and neatly presented food equals a place worth visiting!",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,0,0,4,Av12lh6x1b4pxJ2CvQdy8Q
955267,2014-03-10,4,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"PROTIP: Check in on yelp for $1 off each sandwich or the Bizness meal (as of 3/9/2014)!!

Located inside the Center on Maryland and Clark. Best spur-of-the-moment find ever! They offer scones, cheesecake, cookies, healthy bars, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, lattes, coffees, and quinoa sides. They have flavored agave packs here! Skinny tubes of it for less than $1. Very cool. Offers vegan, vegetarian, and meaty options. Now that's what I call: choices! 

NOTE: They do delivery here! $3 charge for orders less than $30. Free for over that price. Great idea for DTLV residents or for company lunches.

Goodwich was closed by 3pm on sundays. Thought we could make it, but we were an hour late! Curse you daylight savings! But really, if we didn't forget, we would have not found this place sooner.

I pulled up the yelp app looking for nearby eats and they directed me to the Bronze Café located in the Center. I did not expect this place to be so good! The guys working here were AWESOME. Love them. They made excellent recommendations. 

While we were waiting for our food, he gave us spoon samples of their chocolate cheesecake, strawberry, and pecan. Amazingly high-quality. Fresh. Housemade and NOT bought from a distributor. Bronze Café, for sure, is the real deal.

We ordered the kale, banana, apple vegan smoothie. Yummy. Not bitter and the perfect amount of sweet! Refreshing for a perfect spring/summer day. Comes in two sizes. 14 oz. ($4-5ish) and 24 oz. ($5.75). Get the bigger size. So worth the health.

There was extra smoothie in the blender so our server gave us the rest in another cup (See pic). Now that was really, really thoughtful. Seriously. It was a lot of juice! More than what I can say about Jamba Juice (you just know those jamba jerks have extra but won't give it to you!) 

To start we had the HUMMUS: chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, cumin, paprika, lemon juice. I could have sworn it had roasted red pepper too... Comes with warm pita. ($3.95) kinda small for the price but it's only $2.25 if you ordered a sandwich/salad. Great for a small lunch/snack size. Creamy, smooth, fresh. Ridiculously tastes like tacos to me. The spices they used and the freshness just got to me. I wish I bought a tub to take home. Waaayyy better than store-bought hummus. Must-try!

My friend and I also ordered the Tree of Life (vegan) and I ordered the LGBTQ sandwich. 

Tree of Life sandwich ($9.95): roasted red peppers, avocado, mixed greens, tomato, housemade pickled onions, housemade vegan cashew creama, brazil nut crumbles, mango cilantro vinaigrette on a pita flatbread. Comes with a small side salad of mixed greens in the vinaigrette. 
LOVED this. The crunch of the nut went surprisingly well with the avocado and the veggies. What the heck. These guys know how pair flavors! Who knew vegan could taste so good. (They make sure to note that pita bread isn't vegan, but this was so good).

LGBTQ sandwich ($9.95): housemade bacon jam, maple-glazed bacon, mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, basil aioli, lemon vinaigrette on ciabatta bread.
Obviously not vegetarian. Comes with a small mixed green salad with vinaigrette as well. So freakin' bomb. The right amount of salty from the bacon without being overwhelming. Balanced out perfectly by the cucumber and tomato. Bacon was NOT greasy and complemented the veggies amazingly. And for Jesus's Chrysler sake, this has bacon jam in it. Bacon jam. I wanted to cry, confess, and break down in food-heaven convulsions right then and there. 

Going to try their scones next time. Reasonably priced and way better-looking than starbucks' overpriced frozen sweets. Ranges from $1.75-$4ish. Big portions for pastries/scones/bars.

I think I found my new lunch spot. It's also a chill place to kick back and read a book or bring your laptop. I believe there is free wi-fi and a few outlets. There's a reason why this place has 5 stars and I can definitely see why. 

Checking out The Center was on my to-do list forever, and it's an absolute gem to find this awesome café here. Character, culture, and no gimmicks. The service, well-thought out fresh menu, and the options are fantastic. My favorite surprised find by far!! Next time you're in the area, you have to stop by here! One of the perfect places to grab lunch in DTLV.",tQvoC8V-kvw6t0VIBbrd9A,10,6,5,za3Qcm37I1QNcG9AAGjk0g

977873,2013-08-27,0,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"I'm so glad that the LGBTQ Center made the move to their new digs or else Bronze Cafe wouldn't have been possible! I have been a part of the Center through volunteer programs and trainings and after a few times in the place I realized I needed to try the food that the cafe had to offer. 

I tried the beet salad which was delicious, very fresh and flavorful which made me so sad when my little plate was empty. With the salad I tried the LGBTQ sandwich which is such a great play on the well-known favorite, BLT. Unfortunately, this sandwich at the cafe has now and forever ruined my BLT experience! I loved it too much and I'm pretty sure not even Pinterest can cure the cravings! I'll just have to settle for trying again some time, but I don't want to miss out on all the other delicious things the cafe has to offer. What made this sandwich particularly delicious was the maple bacon jam...SERIOUSLY! Maple Bacon Jam. Amazing, enough said. All their ingredients are so fresh and they damn well feel like they are made with love.

The cafe also provides so many vegan and vegetarian options which I believe is so hard to find when surrounded by meat-eater locations. The next time I'm there I really wanna try the Tree of Life Pita (I've heard great things about it) and maybe some of their slow drip iced coffee. Oh, and they have desserts! Vegan cheesecakes, cookies and cakes! There's just so many things I want to try there and the best part is that I leave without feeling like I just ate a ton of fried bar food that will be killing me later. Their food and especially their fun fruit water drinks are so health conscious and yummy that you can't go wrong.

1057539,2016-01-29,1,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"Hands down Bronze Café is one of my favorite places in town.  This wonderful café is nestled in The Gay & Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada (The Center) on Maryland Parkway.  The café is a small part of The Center, but supports and furthers the mission of the space so well: ""[The Center]...promotes activities directed at furthering the well-being, positive image, and human rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community, its allies..."" 

This café focuses on fresh and wholesome ingredients with an emphasis on minimal animal protein through a wealth of vegan offerings. The emphasis on whole foods and vegetables speaks directly to The Center's focus on the ""well-being"" of the LGBTQ community and its allies. In the past few years more establishments that focus on vegan fare have been becoming popular in the valley. And this place is certainly a fan favorite. There are always lines during lunch and the dessert options are limited later in the evening, but those are my only two negative observations. Not complaints. Who can complain about flavorful and varied food options that do not include meat? 

And, make no mistake, the food is delicious. The thing that stands out to me about the many selections I've tried is that they are so well seasoned. These favorites include: the bizness, tree of life, beet salad, Brussels sprouts, hummus, and tonight, the tofurky sandwich. Many of my favorite dishes tend toward a bright citrusy flavor profile and that makes me happy. They just know how to work with textures and flavors and quality ingredients to make simple food sing.  The sandwiches are prepared with high-quality bread and there is a wealth of vegetables--either on or accompanying--the sandwich options I have eaten (see above) or eaten. 

It's a café, but it's also a place that people are willing to go out of their way to visit on a regular basis because everything about this place feeds them. I want to eat well, but when I can do it in an environment that is community-centered and positive, it is a pleasure.  The Center and Bronze Café honor the communities they serve. The Center continues to be one of my favorite places in the Valley. In part because someone had the foresight to create an eating space that feels like the best parts of Vegas.  For my money, it is what so many other places in this town strive for.  I am so much less interested in ""hipster"" and ""modern"" than I am in community advocacy, delicious vegan fare, and free HIV testing. I could not be a bigger fan.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,3,4,5,XGYY0psbrs5iDzznO3RTaw

She ordered an extra side of croutons that are torn pieces and packed with tons of flavor and a little kick. I ordered the what what sandwich. The combo of turkey and pepperoni with the greens and basil aioli was so delicious. And top it off with this ciabatta bread that's crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. He got the Miss Piggy sandwich, which was a chicken salad with bacon and green goddess dressing, basil aioli and lemon vinaigrette. Unbelievable combination of flavors.

I would have ordered the same thing (and I will next time I go), but I wanted to try something else, so I ordered the The Bizness, which is a kale salad topped with your choice of three items. I got the brussel sprouts, beet/quinoa, and spiced chickpeas. This was one tasty salad, don't get me wrong, but after having a bite of the LGBTQ, all I could do was stare longingly at it while I munched on my veggies.

To improve the menu, add some romaine or red or green leaf lettuce to some of the menu items so it's not all the same salad mix & dressing on most items. The salad mix used is high quality but the same mix is used for the side salads and the veggie sandwiches. So when you order one of their amazing veg sandwiches like ""Tree of Life,"" it is topped with all the same salad greens & same dressing that fill the plate next to it. Also, add a nutritious mocha smoothie option. Competitor G&Proteins has an good one with coffee and dark chocolate and greens that you guys could totally improve upon. 

To improve the ordering process for customers, bring back the labels on the backed goods / desserts. Labels have been gone for a long time now and so you have to ask about each one of the items since they aren't on the menu. I feel bad for the employees and for the people behind me if there's a line.

So much so that I've been I've been putting off writing this review for months!  My heart says ""5 stars!!!,"" while my yelp-reviewing objective-lawyer-brain says ""3....""  Accordingly, I shall split the baby and hope that I can one day soon update this review to a full 5.

Heart:  The food is great and, importantly, has integrity.  Order one of the fantastic sandwiches or--if you're looking for a feel-good (or rather, feel-even-better) option, order the Sandwich as a Salad (better yet as a KALE salad!).  In fact, you will feel good about your meal here in almost every way, once you get it (caveat: see below).  Chef Peter is a talented and committed cook as well as a natural host with an earnest, caring demeanor.  The other staff are mostly friendly and entirely welcoming.  I have recommended this place to many colleagues, brought more than a few for lunch, and created some Bronze die-hards along the way.

Head:  Ugh, the wait.  Some of this is due to expectations:  the café setting leads one to anticipate that you can grab a quick to-go order or have a brief lunch while on break from your downtown office.  That is sometimes, but not always, possible (aside from ""grabbing"" a pre-made item, of course).   I have waited upwards of 20 minutes for a to-go order.  Nevertheless, the food is so good (and I feel so good patronizing a local small business), that I simply build in the possibility of a 20-minute wait into my lunch trip if Bronze is involved.  However, when the wait is supplemented by receiving the wrong order, it is frankly dispiriting...  Just yesterday, the BF--who orders along with his entire small law office--did not receive his order.  Then, when they brought it after being notified, it was incomplete :/

All that said, I will keep going back and keep recommending it to others, just with the caveat that you give yourself plenty of time and check your order before you leave.",YGPSb7fJqaAESZpqgZ6urg,0,0,4,15JfmgaDEGZLQfAlxDubLQ

The maple glazed bacon jam is to die for. Delicious, flavorful and unique in a very good way. It's big enough to split with someone.

Also got a green tea frappucino. It's not as sweet and flavorful as other places, but I'm assuming it's healthier. It was a bit frothy too.

Lots of options to choose from including vegetarian, vegan, desserts and drinks.

A little pricey, but worth it. 

Very difficult to find. It doesn't look like a restaurant from the outside. It's a LGBTQ center with lots of books, sitting area (inside and outside), computers, greeting cards for sale, flyers for events, all gender restroom, etc. and a deli inside.

They have a plethora of veggie and vegan options. You really can't go wrong here. Fresh salads, pitas made with organic and premium ingredients, fresh juices, smoothies and desserts. 
Firstly, I have to commend the service. The guy on the phone was so patient and so friendly. He explained all the menu options in detail, no hurry. Thy deliver for free for an order of $30. Prices are more reasonable than the strip. About $15 should get you a drink and sandwich. Delivery was under 30mins and very well packed. Communication, payment and invoice were super professional. 
Tried the tree of life pita. Really liked it, but it was more like a salad in a pita. I was missing an earthy falafel or something wholesome in it. I should have gotten the good earth pita (with eggplant and mushrooms)... Next time. The watermelon chia drink was super healthy, filling and tasty. 
Also had the Ghirardeli blended coffee which was at par with a Starbucks frappuccino. Tried the zucchini chocolate brownie - didn't like it. Should have ordered the cheesecake. Overall, ideal meal for 2nd or third day in Vegas when your system is screwed up with alcohol and bread/meat.

I tried the California Turkey Sandwich with the red pepper hummus.  The sandwich was good.  It was served with a side salad that I wasn't aware of.  The hummus was just ok.  I felt it was a little too 'thin' for my taste.  I expect hummus to be thick and creamy.   It just wasn't my cup of tea but the pita served with it was nice a warm.

1658313,2014-12-21,2,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"Bronze Cafe has an amazing and flawless menu.  And I can say this because I've tried most everything they offer.  To say that every detail of their menu has been carefully thought through and scrutinized is an understatement...no stone is left un-turned in crafting robust and refreshing flavor combinations.

Let's begin with my favorite sandwich on the menu - the Tree of Life Pita.  SO GOOD.  And all veg.  I'm a hardcore carnivore and I will still choose this every time I go.  But if you're really craving meat, you can't go wrong with the LGBTQ (a genius spin on the BLT...with lemon vinaigrette, greens and q-cumber thrown in for good measure) - everything blends together so well.  Also outstanding are the California Turkey, the What What (tastes like pizza!), and the Green Goddess Chicken Salad Sandwich...I wish I had enough stomach space to order seconds on all these.  Truly amazing sandwiches across the board.

Now on to some additional and notable highlights.
David's Special is probably the best salad I've ever had.  Very hearty without being too heavy and a mixture of flavors that compliment each other perfectly - kale, beets, quinoa, spiced chickpeas, avocado and hemp seeds...and with their signature lemon vinaigrette that binds it all together.  I never thought I could love a salad so much.

If you're there for breakfast, get the Swedish Oatmeal.  This is not your standard oatmeal...it's SO GOOD.  A perfect balance of spices and sweetness.  I also recommend getting this for not-breakfast.  Just eat it all the time.  And their smoothies...drool.  The pumpkin smoothie (not sure if this is a seasonal offering) puts certain commercial coffee chains to shame.  Just hook it to my veins.

And the desserts are also amazing...so if you still have room at the end of your meal, I recommend the peanut butter snickerdoodle, the chocolate zucchini cake, or a slice of their vegan cheesecake.  Don't let the ""vegan"" description scare you.  It will knock your socks off.

To summarize, all the food is stellar.  Order anything and walk away happy.  But the biggest compliment I have for this place is the refreshing friendliness and helpfulness of the entire staff.  Chefs & owners Peter & Dave treat each guest like a friend and the staff couldn't be more pleasant and eager to help freshly make and serve your food with a smile.  Special shout-out to Carmen who served up the food in the most cheerful manner I've ever seen.  Bronze Cafe is a home away from home.  Go.

1677709,2015-08-25,1,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"One bite.  That is all it took for me to know this was the best sandwich I've ever had.  But before getting into that, gotta talk about the Bronze Cafe.  No large signs outside as I was hoping so after avoiding a sideswiping accident, that would have been my fault, I pulled into the parking lot of the Center.  Parking lot was pretty empty on a Sunday so i was wondering if they were open.  Staff were so inviting, friendly and the guy seemed to know everyone who came into order or leave on a first name basis.  I was recommended the LGBTQ sandwich which contained bacon jam - of course I'm ordering this.  Kid wanted a Caesar salad and we got a macha chia pudding for dessert.  Our food came out just a couple minutes after ordering! Some kind of world record sandwich maker back there.

Ok, the LGBTQ sandwich...one bite.  This thing is sandwich perfection!  Already knew the bacon jam would be amazing but combine it with the lemon vinaigrette...wow!  Scene stealer was the ciabatta bread.  I'm used to some kind of crusty flavorless roll whenever i hear that word but this thing was a soft moist pillow that held everything intact.  Definitely a sandwich I will eat every time I'm in town.

Chicken Caesar salad.  Look a bit closer...that is freshly shaved parmesan cheese and a ton of it throughout the whole salad.  Croutons are flavorful with a nice kick of heat at the end - no space-stealing bread crusts here.  And the dressing is green??? Whatever is in there produces a refreshing caesar salad; not a typical adjective that I'd normally use for a Caesar.

Watermelon chia juice - Fresh watermelon with little crunchy seeds.  Do not let this thing get warmed up, its not as fun to drink.

Macha chia pudding - If you like macha, then you'll love this.  Its a delicious way to fill in those last remaining empty spaces in your fat belly.",2AmyrQ0f7ErlXYdkXKLGPg,2,2,5,Oh6T2qwwvLHKLwkFwi7aJw

Bronze Cafe is inside The Center so there's no signage when you drive by. There's plenty of parking unlike at other places downtown.

I love how everything here is fresh. They give samples of their soup of the day , cheesecakes and iced coffee. I get their miso soup whenever they have it for the soup of the day - surprisingly better than the miso soup at some Japanese restaurants imo. Coconut curry soup is great as well. 

I have not tried any item that I did not like except for the ""complicated order"" sandwich since I'm not a fan of the bacon jam or bacon in general. My favorite is their ""Good Earth"" pita (9.95$) which is a soft & delicious pita bread w/ spring mix , lemon vinaigrette , roasted vegetables ,  mushrooms , hummus , sprouts and spicy sunflower seeds inside. I like this over their ""Tree of Life"" pita (although that one is still really good) since the spicy sunflower seeds adds a nice crunch. Even if you're not vegan or vegetarian , it's a must try. I also love their Bizness salad (9.95$). I normally don't even get salads when I eat out but their salad is the best. It's a lemon vinaigrette massaged kale salad base + any 3 sides. 

They also have a great drink selection although they discontinued my favorite matcha blended smoothie. They can recreate it though but it depends who's working. They still have the matcha superfoods blended smoothie (6.50$) but it's more of a protein shake. 

Food is expensive , salads/sandwiches/wraps start at 8.95-12.90$. They have student discounts but still pricey. However if you're into eating healthy , Bronze Cafe is worth looking into.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,7,4,5,j7bGqW4D9LC17THZ18OiWA

The executive chef and co-owner, Peter, is also an absolute sweetheart!  The boyfriend and I couldn't decide on a blended drink.  It was a toss-up between the chocolate blended or the chai blended and Chef Peter accommodated my request in making a blended mix of both!  Super yum!  Oh but the most surprising thing was their LGBTQ sandwich, which is probably the only non-vegan item on the menu because it was a bacon sandwich with bacon jam, accompanied with a fresh lemon side salad.  My taste buds were dancing when I had this sandwich.  It may be on the pricey side but it's completely worth it.  Also, if you check in on yelp, they have some discounts available, as well as on their page on Facebook.  One last surprise was their ""Tree of Life"" sandwich.  I'm not really a vegetable eater but we gave it a shot because it's their most popular one.  I loved all the flavors and I totally forgot that everything I was eating was healthy and vegetable-y!

The staff is very friendly and helpful. He was very patient will I was trying to make my selection. I settled on a curried quinoa salad and while it was flavorful it was dry as dust. Just a suggestion: this one would be excellent if it was a little moist and easy to swallow.

The Bronze Cafe is nestled in the center of the LGBTQ center here and I'm always wiling to offer my support. It just wasn't the stellar experience I was expecting.

The food is excellent, light but filling, leaving us satisfied until dinner. The  smoothies were very refreshing as well, topped off with an all natural oat bar for desert.

2071890,2016-03-03,6,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"Bronze Cafe is located inside of the LBGTQ center. The center is pretty neat, it looks like a library with couches, computers, and a small section of books. The Cafe is smack dab in the middle. It's fast casual where you order at the counter and then they call your name or in this case deliver to your table. Since I knew I was gonna eat here, I spent half the day browsing the menu trying to decide what I was going to order. While doing so, I found out they had Groupon-score!! Each Groupon included a cup of soup, a sandwich or salad and a dessert for $11. Not a bad deal considering the salads and sandwiches are anywhere from $9 and up. 

I ordered the LGBTQ sandwich, the soup of the day, and a brookie for dessert. The sandwich had maple-glazed bacon AND bacon jam, as well as mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, lemon aioli and their house made lemon vinaigrette all on a ciabatta bun. To me this tasted healthier than it should have. After all there was 2 kinds of bacon on this thing. I think they over loaded the sandwich with lettuce and cukes, and don't get me wrong it was good, but it was pretty dry. I couldn't taste any of the aioli or vinaigrette so I would probably ask for more next time. I enjoyed the bacon and the jam though and everything tasted really fresh. The soupe du jour was chili verde, and it was good but spicy!! It was very hearty with chunks of tomatoes, beans, and lots of spice. A cup is a decent sized portion but I didn't really like it so I didn't finish it. FYI the soup changes daily so give them a call to see what they have. The brookie which is a cookie and a brownie together was dry and flavorless. It crumbled as I bit into it. Definitely would not order that again. 

I also purchased a beet and goat cheese salad to eat for lunch the next day and that salad was amazing. It has small pieces of beets, walnuts and goat cheese tossed in their lemon vinaigrette. I don't even like beets, but I do now. This salad is fresh and filling and I wouldn't for sure order it again. The workers were all super friendly and smiley, especially the cashier.

2229672,2014-08-19,2,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"My review for this place is way overdue, but I've had quite the love affair with Bronze Cafe. I was working in downtown Vegas for a 3-month project, and Bronze Cafe happened to be close by and had delivery service. I chose this place on a whim my first week there, and ended up getting it for lunch at least twice a week, every week for the duration of the project. YES, it was THAT good. And being the insatiable, variety-loving foodie that I am, I ended up cheating on the Bronze every so often and trying other lunch places nearby.... but none of them made me feel the way the Bronze did -- giddy, warm, happy, cared for, so I always came crawling back.

Maybe it's the way they carefully assembled the salads and sandwiches like the pieces of culinary art that they were. Or maybe it's the love and care they put into their freakishly delicious vegan baked treats. Whatever the ""it"" factors were, they got me hooked and begging for more each week. It's with some sadness and nostalgia that I write this review now, sitting some 500-plus miles away, fondly reminiscing over the great times we had together.

ANYWAY, I may never get over you, Bronze, but I think listing some of your great qualities to the world so that others may be able to love in the same ways that I love you will help give me some closure. So here it goes:

FOOD: In one plain word.... Uhhhh-mazing. The breads for their sandwiches are always the perfect balance of fluffy and crunchy, the dressings are unique and always drizzled to the right amount, and I haven't had a single thing that I didn't like. My favorites are:
- The Bizness: Massaged kale salad base, with up to 3 added sides; the best ones are the spiced/curried chickpeas, beet & quinoa salad, and roasted brussels sprouts (with some sort of crack-laden sauce that has me licking my fingers and utensils every time). You can also add chicken!
- The Complicated Order: Trust me when I say that everything about this sandwich is a win, from the turkey to the bacon/bacon jam to even the Qcumbers (cucumbers)! 
- Tree of Life pita: Breathes new life into me every time, with that amazingly soft and fluffy pita and roasted red peppers. 
- Banana boy bait: Some of the best banana bread you'll ever have
- Strawberry jam cookie: Oh.... be still, my heart! The perfect combination of chewy and crumbly shortbread and rich strawberry jam
- Peanut butter snickerdoodle cookie: I'm a sucker for nut butter, and this cookie only worsens my addiction. It's super crumbly and delicious!

SERVICE: People are always sweet, friendly, and helpful. Plus, if you come in a lot (or call in a lot, like me, to the point where they start recognizing your voice....) they will show you little tokens of their appreciation for your loyalty! 

AMBIANCE: Vibrant, warm, and colorful. They're located in an LGBT center and the cafe is really cute, with a colorful dining area surrounded by shelves of eclectic books. 

Both my vegan and non-vegan friends also enjoyed this place! Till we meet again, Bronze!",8uWZnfSJ8F73Bg0S7u3jiQ,4,3,5,vgS0qh28VO4r9k10DgoYcQ
2235869,2013-05-19,1,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"Move over Red Velvet, because the Bronze Cafe is serving up gold! The day before Mothers Day, they offered a free drink to all mothers, a promotion I learned about via facebook. This very sweet gesture brought me in to sample their creative cafe cuisine, as well.

My Tree of Life pita was packed full of flavor. I usually believe any sandwich needs cheese, but I did not feel like this pita was missing anything! For $9.95, it was large and filling, and seemed to be made up of quality ingredients. I'm tempted to add on some marinated seitan next time for an additional $2.95. Healthy side salads are only $1.95 with a sandwich purchase, and served in an 8 oz. deli container.

The friendly barista encouraged me to sample a few side dishes and their raw vegan ""cheesecake."" My free Mothers Day beverage was the almond coconut blended, per his suggestion. Chewy bits of dates sweetened this creamy, vegan smoothie and reminded me of the date shakes served at China Ranch. I could drink another one of these right now.

Bathrooms down the hallway are simply labeled as ""the johns,"" and not separated for men and women. Just a note, as this confused me for a second before realizing the common entrance was for everyone. 

I also took home a vegan strawberry cookie from the tempting pastry display, and found it to have a cake-like texture. It reminded me of a muffin top.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,8,5,5,cnUCq_sCpFFYpb9kTiGzMg
2245644,2017-01-10,0,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"Warning ! Food Poisoning !!! Yesterday was the first and last time I visit the Bronze cafe. I went in during lunch hour and ordered a complicated order sandwich without tomatoes, a cookie, and a coffee. The staff seemed like they were in no hurry to help - there were four staff members that I could see behind the counter three of them were taking a really long time to do basic tasks but one girl was doing her job diligently. Some of the staff took people out of order in the line. So it had me thinking what was the purpose of the line???
When they finally brought out my food - the male employee comes out and starts whispering to the female employees about my order. I over heard him say that he put tomatoes on the sandwhich and was going to take it back-I could also see him about switch out the cookie for a new one- but the lady (his supervisor I guess) stopped him. They said some other things but could not understand them. I'm not one to send things back because I'm afraid that the employees will mess with the food ( spitting on it if you send it back, ect) so I take the sandwich home anyway and take off the tomatoes. I also like to give people the benefit of the doubt - he looked like a young guy maybe he was on training or new and didn't know.
Things went from bad to worse after I ate the sandwich. I started feeling nausea. Then throwing up so much that I almost went to the hospital for the food poisoning. I know that I got the FOOD POISONING from the Bronze cafe because the sandwich was he only thing I had that day. I was really disappointed to get food poisoning after seeing all the positive reviews - but maybe Bronze cafe has let those positive reviews get to their head and have begun slacking on their food preparation standards. I am a very disappointed and very sick former customer !


In response to Mr. David M.: I had my Dr. conduct a home visit. My Dris a licensed MD practicing medicine for over 20 years confirmed based on his in person  analysis of my symptoms, contents of my stomach, determination of what I had eaten, and his expert medical training and experience that I had received food poisoning because of the food from Bronze cafe. I am not aware of which medical school you went to. 

My review is not the only one on this Yelp page complaining of food poisoning, nausea, and vomiting after eating your cafe's food. See Jason S review March 2015. Perhaps if you spent more time on your food handling procedures and less time representing misleading information implying that your small staff eats every item on your large menu each day  you wouldn't have this problem.",GkhjsgQ8SxShVeD-PZhI0A,1,0,1,yxm-rNxuxOKf90POwRhZng

This review should've been posted a LONG time ago but I have been procrastinating.  As my opening says, their bacon jam is superb!  They should sell it in jars.  I love all their sandwiches and salads.  My favorite is the LGBTQ sandwich.  It is a highly evolved BLT sandwich on a ciabatta bun.  Get the bun toasted and it adds so much depth to the sandwich.  They can also make all their sandwiches into salads.  

They make drinks of the blended kind, fruit waters, coffee, and your regular bottled fair.  My favorite is the Vegan Kale Apple Banana Blended.  Also, the cafe serves lots of pastries!  Their version of the brokie called the Loving vs. Virginia., a marriage of brownie and a cookie.  I can never pass up on this when I'm at The Center.  

Oh, BTW, most of their food is vegetarian/vegan.  You cannot really tell that they are though because it is so good!

Sweet, because the Tree of Life Pita Sandwich is probably the tastiest healthy sandwich I have ever had and BITTER because in order to enjoy my lunch as much as I enjoyed it today, I will be forced to visit the Bronze Cafe every single day. Damnit.  ;)

I was going to order the LGBTQ because I'M NO VEGAN. Also, because I LOVE BACON like Ron Swanson loves bacon. But, in an effort to halt pre-holiday weight gain, I thought I would see what the fuss is about this ""Tree of Life Pita."" 

And in this case, the FUSS was ON POINT.  I grabbed my pita to go and when I got back to my office and took my first bite, I was in fresh, veggie, avocado, tomato-onion, cashew ""crema,"" sunflower seed, mango cilantro ginger vinaigrette HEAVEN. If you don't know what I'm talking about, the only thing I can do to better explain my feelings about this sandwich is by saying this: go to the Bronze Cafe, order the Tree of Life Pita, take your first bite and proceed to basque in the fiery explosions created by the fresh pita/vegan/veggie flavor delight. 

I really cannot recommend this sandwich enough. I mean, really. It was filling, but in a ""healthy-full"" way.  You know, the ""healthy-full"" feeling that is opposite of the feeling you get on Saturday morning after eating pounds of bacon, eggs, toast and pancakes. 

Also, the cafe is very cute and the service is fast and friendly with a smile. I was in and out with my sandwich boxed up ""to-go"" within 10 minutes and less than $10 was deducted from my wallet.  I literally cannot find one thing to complain about other than the fact that I no longer feel I can visit another lunch establishment in the area in good conscience after having such a great experience here.

Served on a delicious Ciabatta bun. They lietrally stuff the sandwich with the chicken salad. Also, with a side salad with a yummy dressing. My boyfriend got the Miss Piggy which is the chicken salad sandwich with bacon. He said it was super yummy. We sat outside since it was sunny and not too hot.

* The bizness: I usually hate kale, but this is so good. I prefer it with the spiced chickpeas on top, but you get two other sides. This is will fill you up.
* Tree of Life- Dang! It's as messy as it is good. Comes with a salad and whatever dressing is on it is really good and different.
* Vegan Cheesecake- Get it by the slice or the whole thing. This was tangy and has a great texture.
* Iced Coffee- If you drink it black, which you should, this is the best coffee in town. It's so strong and smooth. Ask to water it down if you're gonna chug it because you'll be flying.
* They will microwave your cookie. Aw yiss.
I have to emphasize how great the service here is. They are patient but also great at recommending stuff because they explain everything. Don't think I'm a health food nut or vegan. I'm not. This place is just that good.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,9,6,5,jHMqCHif7fq2rMfvKvvI6Q

When I got in the cafe is pretty small but the workers were really friendly immediately offering a small sample of their soup of the day which happened to be coconut curry.

 The sample was okay but instead we ended up ordering their top most popular sandwich: the tree of life pita, California turkey, and the Apple kale and banana smoothie. Both the sandwiches comes out freshly made but Flavors cut short, it just didn't impress me. It literally tastes like the exact same roasted bell pepper sandwich I make at home, so to come here without feeling any sense of awe or amazement just fell extremely short of expectations. 

The sandwich is vegan and all you can really taste is sour and bell peppers. The salad dressing they use is a bit on the overly sour, and I couldn't really taste any of the other dressing they put on it sadly. Another note that depressed me a little was the extremely thin to almost nonexistent avocado on the sandwich, I didn't even notice the pita had avocados when I bit into it which is sad because I am a huge avocado lover and it was the main reason I ordered the tree of life pita. I felt robbed of my avocado.


I mean when I see their yelp score I think to myself, there are plenty of places that are better than here and don't have 5 star ratings on yelp. Don't get me wrong, this place isn't disgusting at all, it just doesn't deserve a perfect score though In my opinion. 10$ for is a kinda pricy for a tiny pita or sandwich that I can make at home for almost nothing and pack it with more than just 3 tiny avocado slices that are paper thin.

The food here is just very plain in my opinion, and I'm not at all impressive, location is extremely small and nothing to be amazed at (about the size of my desk). I would of been more happier spending the same amount at skinny fats for their kale smoothies or sandwiches. I really do want to give this place 5 stars but sorry to disappoint, bronze cafe just simply doesn't get the gold.

The Bronze Cafe is sandwich & coffee cafe located in The LGBTQ Center.  I don't fall into any of those categories, but completely enjoyed my time at The Center and at the Bronze Cafe.  The staff is delightfully warm, welcoming and helpful. 

The Pita sandwich I enjoyed comes with roasted red peppers, avocado, mixed greens, tomato, housemade pickled onions, housemade vegan cashew ""crema"", brazil nut crumble, sunflower seeds, mango cilantro ginger vinaigrette and is served on Pita Flatbread.  The housemade items are amazing!...I loved the pickled onions, cashew crema and the vinaigrette.  The sandwich also had a nice crunch to it.  I tried a couple of their sides, the quinoa and baba ganoush were both solid.  I also heard lots of great comments about their baked goods from others.

Don't come here looking for a sit-down restaurant...or patio cafe downtown.  But if you're in the area it is worth stopping in just to eat.

2613985,2014-04-07,1,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"I am teetering between 4 and 5 stars on the Bronze Cafe. My friend and I came with our 3 kiddies after a visit to the Discovery Children's Museum on Friday since we were in the neighborhood and everyone I know has been raving about The Tree of Life! The people that work here are SO friendly and fantastic. I ordered hummus with a side of pita, the soup of the day (vegetable), and the tree of life. The gentleman who I paid with gave me a 5% student discount on top of my Yelp check-in. Lunch here was very fairly priced and with exceptional service. 

They have 2 tables seated outside if you want to dine al-fresco, which we opted for, and an employee helped me carry my food out because my life is always a handful. The hummus was so fresh and tasty! You can tell it wasn't packaged and sitting there for days. The pita was very soft, and my daughter was so happy because hummus is one of her favorite foods. She also enjoyed the soup which had a plethora of various veggies (zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes, carrots, hominy) and a very light broth that tasted like a bunch of boiled down veggies. It made me feel good finding such a healthy lunch option for her on the go. Lastly, I was able to eat my pita and boy was it delicious! I don't know what about it makes it so good (I think it's the sauce), but I want to come here after every visit to the museum and feast my face on this tree of life. It was packed full of veggies, roasted veggies, greens, avocado, and some hummus that I threw on there. I don't know if I'll be able to stray away to try the bizness but everyone knows of my love for kale. 

So why the 1 star removed? Well, I am a parent, and kind of prude. I love the LGBTQ community, but I didn't realize how different things would be when I came with kids. First of all, at the entrance is a bowl at the help desk. I was going to grab a mint, until I realized they were condoms. Then, when I took my daughter to the restroom, there were two other guys in there. My daughter was puzzled like ""why are there men in the bathroom?"" It was just a little strange to see men in our little sacred ground of a restroom. Lastly, there's a library here, and my daughter LOVES books so she runs over and grabs some books while I am ordering and paying. Yes, I know that I should have been watching her more carefully, but since we are at least once a week library frequenters, I figured she would be fine. When I'm done ordering, I walk over to her and her friends, and I notice that it's a LGBTQ library. Some of the books have photos on the front that are not appropriate for little children. Several have textual content that is definitely not appropriate for children (luckily none of them can read, they're 4 and under). After I noticed this, I told them they couldn't get any more books. When I talked another friend of mine who recommended this place to me, I told her what had happened and she was shocked, because her kids have also grabbed books to look at while waiting. Therefore, to parents, watch your children. I will definitely be back to try more delicious food and keep a closer eye on my children.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,4,3,4,A8-0ezW8zXiEUyfhSNnLmQ

You can choose from curried chickpeas, sesame broccoli, beets, chopped avocado, roasted brussel sprouts, quinoa with almonds, etc. All are beyond delicious when tossed with the kale and stirred up together, and is perfectly filling.

My favorite sandwich is the Green Goddess (chicken salad). The portions are large, and the side salad that comes with the sandwich is enough for a whole meal.  You can upgrade this sandwich by adding bacon. Either way, the sandwich is amazing. 

As for the pastries, I've tried a few different options- mainly vegan- and those can't be beat as well.

I was ordering the coconut date shake until they changed their dates, it doesn't taste as good to me anymore. 

My favorite item on the menu isn't even food, it's their cold brew coffee. It's the best cold brew I've tried, with a little bit of soy milk, it's perfect. No need for sugar at all.

I did GPS it and it was still very hard to find to the point I had to call and only had to listen to a voicemail explaining where is was.  Kinda frustrating and voiced my opinion of maybe hanging a sign.  I think they deal with a lot of to-go and deliveries to downtown areas but really they are good enough to expand.

I got roasted red pepper hummus with pita, fabulous.  I got the tree of life pita for my friend, I was told a nice zesty veggie sandwich.  I got the california tofurky with avocado and lots of other yummy things.  Each came with a salad and dressing, the sandwich was large I could only eat half and ate the other half later!

I encourage everyone to read them, as they are full of insights and examples as to why and how the food served here is full of passion, care and special ingredients.
Perhaps what I can add to the posts already here is my attempt to convey the social message and community mission of this dining destination which is literally the front door and welcoming station to institution dedicated to human rights, understanding, dialogue and education about many topics ""ripe"" with all sorts of implications and social controversy.

From the free wifi, to the community meeting rooms, to the wide variety of community partners in the ""Center"" of downtown Las Vegas' emergent neighborhoods which are in the midst of an urban renaissance.

The Bronze Cafe is deliberately designed to nourish the mind and the soul as well as the stomach.  It structured to engender discussion and understanding, as well as nourishment.  Its ownership and management have chosen very ambitious goals and responsibilities -- and they carry out these tasks with dignity, hospitality and professionalism.

Oh, and not incidentally, the food is awesome.  And, although I was just a ""random"" community member, as a welcomed member of Green Drinks Las Vegas at its monthly meeting last night hosted by the Bronze Cafe at The Center, I was honored to be treated to a wide ""tasting menu"" last night.   I and about 20 others at this community meeting were provided a number of sandwich and drink samples from this restaurant which is truly a community treasure on many levels.   I can assure you that everything without exception was delicious, full of healthy ingredients lovingly and expertly and professionally chosen with care.

Could I say more.  Probably.  But the point is that this business is special and I encourage others to take advantage of everything that it has to offer.",oQ7irCudwDr73-938pXQIg,7,5,5,O-AnCpDHsjSZ7BTi-HYcew

It's located on Maryland parkway and Charleston. It's pretty tiny but full of delicious food. The pastry case is always stocked with vegan and non vegan options. *the zucchini banana chocolate muffin is so ridiculously good!!! Ask them to warm it for you and it practically melts in your mouth. The ""cheesecakes"" have never ever disappointed. The blueberry is fabulous! Never tastes artificial and the crust is perfectly crisp! The coffee has never disappointed, made hot and fresh, and always smooth. The melon waters... The turmeric and canteloupe is by far my favorite... It is a perfect summer beverage. 

The smoothies... We've tried the cocoa super food (smooth and delicious and hearty) and the coconut almond (light, slightly sweet, and thirst quenching) I would recommend either after a lifting session or yoga. Both are full of nutrients and electrolytes. 

The sandwiches... So far we have tried the good earth pita (stocked with veggies and full vegan goodness)  and the tree of life pita (our fav) very hearty and the dressing was out of this world!! 

The salads... The Thai peanut was surprisingly very very good! I wasn't expecting it to be as savory as it was and textures all blended surprisingly well. It was a day we split the salad and a pita and we were both very very full and satisfied. THE BIZZNESS, is exactly that, the business! We always try different options. You get to choose three options over chopped kale in a perfect lemon vinaigrette. So far we have tried the hummus, the babagonoosh, roasted beet and quinoa, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, spiced chickpeas, avocado... I think you get the Idea (so many options)! It's always a go to For us and is always delicious. 

Their soups are insane. The split pea and lentil are two of my favorites. I would recommend checking out their face book daily to see what the days options are. They also had a vegan tamale that was put of this world. My boyfriend said it was the best tamale he has ever eaten. If you see one make sure to grab it.

I found out about them from a fellow yelper that told me to try it out, that it's one of the best vegan cafes in town. So the next day I pulled up the menu and called to place an order.
I decided to drive there for my first time instead of having it delivered so I could feel out the vibe of the place. Right when I got there I saw a lot of the tables full which is a good sign! I was immediately greeted by the staff there. They were so friendly and willing to make my first time experience well remembered. They offered me samples of their fruit water and also gave me a 10% discount for working in the medical field. 

I headed back to work and sat down to enjoy my lunch. I ordered the tree of life pita, the complicated order, the apricot almond bar and one of their began blueberry cheesecakes. I haven't been this impressed with an easy fix for the longest time! The flavor was unbelievable! The bacon jam, basil Aoli and the lemon vinegrette alone is enough to make anyone fall in love! The desserts were absolutely delicious and I highly recommend their fruit water even though some people might think that it's too sweet. 
I've ordered from here now two days in a row and I am probably going again today. I would rate this place more stars of it was possible. I even grabbed a handful of menus to hand out to the different departments of my work. More people need to realize the different options that are available in this town and not just go to taco bell or burger King.

The lobby area - where you will find the Bronze Cafe - has the feel of an open library, with some computers available for use against one wall, and book shelves along a longer curved wall. I really liked the atmosphere, it made me feel like I was a little bit more cool just for having been there.

The counter guy was super friendly, and offered us a sample of their lentil soup with veggies. It was very flavorful, and actually light & refreshing, which is quite an accomplishment for a bean soup.

I really like roasted veggies, so I ordered The Good Earth, and I also got an ice-brewed coffee. The sandwich had lettuce, tomato, roasted? mushrooms, roasted eggplant, alfalfa sprouts, an orange dressing of some kind, sunflower seeds, and what tasted like candied walnuts. I love eggplant, but it really wan't cooked well enough. Cooked eggplant is kind of mushy (and delicious!), but this was still pretty firm & spongy, like it was pretty raw. All the other ingredients were fantastic, and even the candied walnuts went surprisingly well with the other ingredients. But for a roasted veggie sandwich, I also would have liked to see something other than just the eggplant & possibly mushrooms. (I am not sure if the mushrooms were actually roasted. I have not heard of such a thing, but otherwise the eggplant would have been the only roasted veggie.) The pita bread was delicious.

My friend had the Tree of Life, and she thought it was awesome.

I can't really judge the ice-brewed coffee, as I have never had it before. I had heard it was much less bitter than heat-brewed coffee and so I really wanted to try it. But it pretty much just tasted like iced coffee but not as watered down. It could be the most phenomenal ice-brewed coffee ever, but it was my first taste so I can't compare it. Personally, I will stick with regular coffee in the future.

Weird, right? I didn't like my sandwich or my drink, but I still gave it four stars. I liked the atmosphere and the service, and I just feel like I happened to order the wrong thing for me. I feel confident the next visit will be a five-star experience.

The Tree of Life Pita is a vegan sandwich that's pretty glorious. It's delicious, flavorful, and healthy. Wrapped in a soft pita was a mixture of greens, mango cilantro ginger vinaigrette, avocado, vegan cashew cream, and pickled onions and roasted bell peppers. 

For a late afternoon snack I picked up some type of quinoa/chia seeds bar. Although, it was tasty, filling, and super crunchy, each bite let loose crumbs and seeds. 

Not only was the food I had delicious, but the prices were reasonable.

As I am looking at the smoothies, my food comes out. Wow! It was a lot bigger than I thought (that's what she said).. It also came with a side salad that I devoured. The ciabatta bread was soft and fluffy and the sandwich had ample amounts of turkey and avacado! Yum yum yum!!! Let's just say, my plate had no survivors. The tree of life looked massive!

Chili: very bland, overpowered by large pinches of cumin. Very meaty, which was nice, but was disappointed that it didn't come with a side of cornbread or some sort of bread. 
Hummus: also pretty bland and comes with side of pita, which I used some for the chili. I wasn't super impressed, I would recommend maybe a variety of veggies to accompany it. 

Perhaps it was just a poor choice of food that I ordered, but then again, if this place is that good, anything ordered should be delicious.

We finally made our way to Bronze Cafe after getting cut at Hi-Rollers nearby. After seeing the majority of highly rated reviews by fellow Yelpers, this visit was long overdue. 

The Tree of Life was what I originally planned, but it changed in a split second like a Jedi mind trick when I saw BACON JAM and MAPLE BACON described in the LGBTQ Sandwich, a pretty BOMB rendition of the BLT. We also chose to split the Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad with Candied Pecans. Service here is very pleasant and the workers even toss your salad order if you would like them to. Unfortunately, this salad was lacking in flavor and the pecans lacked that sweet toasted flavor. Their version of a Snickerdoodle was dry and crumbly. The Loving vs. Virginia (AKA Brookie) was nice, warm, chewy, and decadent.

Great spot to chill and meet up for a nice healthy lunch. I'd like to return to  try the highly raved about Tree of Life Pita and Bizness Salad because I heard it was the business...For now, it sits at a little more than A-OK for me.  ALOHA!!!

These very words were said to me many times during CrossFit class by a friend: ""YOU GOTTA GO TO BRONZE CAFE KEV, YOU GOTTA GO! YOU'RE AN ELITE YELPER RIGHT?!""

Ooo! I am indeed a Yelper and you're calling me out! I never took the time to drive myself out of the way to eat at a little cafe, but one day the opportunity came when I had to make a visit to the adult Disneyland, the DMV. Yelp said it was 1.2 miles way? HUH... LETS GO!

I normally don't write reviews on first visits, but it was good... really good... seriously really good. I had the Tree of Life sandwich ($9.95) to go which is VEGAN, but a bite of that gyro sandwich MASTERPIECE had me considered a vegan lifestyle for a quick second. I don't know why its called Tree of Life, maybe because you feel completely transformed, like a born again virgin. The sandwich consisted of something like pickled onions, roasted red peppers, avocados, greens, tomatoes, and MAGIC. 

Sort of a tangent, but I took a bite of my TO GO sandwich in my car (bad habit) and was so amazed that I decided to eat the whole thing in my car, go back inside and grab a fork to finish the side salad, and was late for my class and quiz. Was it worth it? You bet. 

I am excited to come back and try the soup, salads, the BIZNESS, bars, pretty much everything.

The mole is made with sunflower seeds, raw cacao and chipotle.  It has some kick!  I had the California Turkey on ciabatta bread.  Both were very fresh and tasted great.  A good blend of flavors.

There's free WiFi here, a resource library for the community of books and movies on DVD, gender neutral bathrooms and the friendliest service in town.

We also ordered an oversized chocolate chip cookie (warmed up!) and she had the mango ""cheesecake"" (vegan/gluten free).  Both hits!  

Try their new drip coffee.  It tastes very smooth.  They brew it overnight cold for over 12 hours.  It makes a difference especially if love iced coffee.

Can't say enough good things about this place.  They welcome everyone, gay and straight, with fresh food, healthy treats and everything made in-house.

You really can not find any other place like it.  We like it better than vegan spots.

They do have plenty of options for those who are not vegan.

The Vegucated Order sandwich: A meat-replacement dream packed with tofurky and soy ""bacon"", coupled with a nice blend of coconut ""bacon"" jam, in between tasty ciabatta, this sandwich was both filling and tasty. However, at $13, I would definitely suggest splitting it, or saving half for another meal.

Curry soup: Personally, I like my curry thick. This curry is more liquidy. Still, good flavor and would be great to take home and devour with a bowl of nice, hot rice.

Monkey Bread: This sweet bread had a nice and soft texture; not too dry, not too wet. Nice blend of cinnamon and chocolate chips.

So many places in Vegas create incredible smoothies. My favorites include Greens & Proteins and (believe it or not) LVAC. Bronze Cafe is a new favorite third with it's ""Too Good For You"" smoothie. I drank two large glasses in the past two days. Kale, chia seeds, protein...

The sandwiches are incredible. The LGBTQ is the best BLT I've ever eaten. Not sure where Chef sourced the bread or the idea to include Q-cumbers, but the whole thing is brilliant and somehow makes me feel more like a vegan and less like a bacon-eating carnivore. I savored every bite.

This is a hidden find for visitors and locals alike. When do you ever hear, ""Hey! Wanna go to the LGBTQ Center for lunch?"" I hear it fortnightly if you're at my job at least. Who doesn't want house-made food at a fair price? I cannot even begin to tell you my excitement with this location. First off, get here quickly. They take customer service seriously. The con to this is potentially long lines during rush hour. But, if you can afford the time, wait in line. You need to enjoy this place, omnivores and vegans alike! From their made-from-scratch soups and salads, to their sandwiches and pitas, this place will satisfy anyone's cravings. Because it is located inside the Center, it is a shared space, so seating is limited adjacent to the gender non-specific, inclusive bathrooms.

So what do you order: Well if you're looking for color and presentation, please order the biz-ness salad. You will get your vegetable servings for the day! Want some meat in there? Try the LGBTQ and you will love the bacon jam. Want something more ""adventurous"" on the menu? Try the Tree of Life Pita with the vegan cashew ""crema."" You will not regret coming here. Just don't forget to check-in or show your government ID for a discount. I'll sure be back for more.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,7,5,5,I2t6TorQdZzEBUsq_YFhDg

Food - 5 stars
Coffee - 5 stars
Ambience - 5 stars

Came to get coffee and brunch one day, ordered the tree of life pita and the turkey club, both were amazing!! Fresh ingredients, healthy organic options, flavorful sauces, and beautiful presentation. The ice coffee was very good too, they brew ice coffee with the proper apparatus and the taste is perfect.

My complaint is on one female staff. While we were standing in line ordering we were disagreeing about the drinks option and this staff started to join in and started to reprimand me for my choice and lecturing me. That's extremely inappropriate and not any of her business. Then after we ordered, she was forcing me to write a tip. I'm ordering a togo order, where there's no service involved therefore I do not tip. She gave me an extreme hard time about not leaving a tip and continue to say that I can leave a cash tip. Wow! Talk about hustling! I'm not at the strip club!

This is a dependable eatery with consistency and fantastic smoothies. We love that there are healthy meals that are tasty and the portions are insane. Never have I ever been able to eat more than half of my order. Never. Not once. 

I love The Bizness - David's Special. Yummmmm. The curried chick peas are stupid-good and the beet salad will leave you trying to stuff more of it into your body, because you just don't want to stop tasting it. 

I've always had Bronze delivered to the studio, but on this day I had a vendor in town, so we made the trip over with a buyer who eats there nearly every day. The cafe is located within the LGBT Center in DTLV, and it's LITERALLY JUST A CAFE. I'm talkin' a glass case with delicacies, pourover and coldbrew, and a few staff members in aprons. it's like 20 feet long - maybe. I was BLOWN AWAY. I couldn't even fathom. 

The customer service is straight ridiculous....ly awesome. We were offered free samples of black eyed pea soup - of which I would normally decline politely, but I've never tasted anything from Bronze that I didn't want to devour in its entirety...so I said hell yes, and I'm glad I did. It was scrumptious! I truly hope that it's on the menu next time I'm there because I will be ordering double. The staff is helpful with decision making, not pushy and super duper friendly. When we got up to leave, they came around the counter and took our trash from our hands. IT'S ONLY A CAFE! They are fantastic. 

By far the most popular order is the Greek Goddess. It's a delicious chicken pesto sandwich that everyone is nutty for. I've never tried it due to the gluten-factor, but I shall soon. Oh yes, I shall.

Since writing my original review I have stopped by this place regularly. I found my favorite dish (The Complicated Order, made as a salad). I also love the guac and mole as a salad and the LGBTQ prepared the same way. (I don't eat bread). 

One afternoon I got back to the office and noticed that they had accidentally made my meal as the sandwich instead of a salad. I gave them a call expecting a replacement the next time I was in. They actually one upped me and offered to delivered the correct meal to my office, and threw in a complimentary (and ridiculously delicious) slice of vegan/gluten free cheesecake. So yum! 

I am always impressed with the quality of food and service at this little spot. 

********

The staff was super friendly and helpful. 

I ordered the chicken chop chop salad, a mint pineapple chia drink and a mint chocolate chia pudding. 

The salad was plenty large. I do wish it had more veggies and less plain lettuce. But the homemade dressing was yummy and I was satisfied. 

The drink has a good flavor and I love chia. But there are some other weird consistencies in the drink. I'm not sure what exactly. Since pineapple should be pretty soft and shouldn't leave any rough pulp...but it was tasty and I finished it. 

The chocolate mint pudding was great! Again, I love chia. But the mint added to the cool chocolate pudding was super refreshing and just what I needed when I crave something sweet after lunch. 

I will def be back for more, to try another salad.",GmzwysGSE-gh0-RgG1_QNA,1,0,5,ebI2aXy7nQE-Sln5vWZvKQ

4106870,2016-09-17,2,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"We're fast approaching the end of 2016. Fortunately, it wasn't too late for me to visit one of Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in 2015.

The original Bronze Cafe (not the new one on Fremont St) is #18 on that list, and after surprisingly discovering their Groupon offer last month, I finally made my way there for lunch today. Located inside what's now simply called ""The Center' (formerly The Gay & Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada), this all-day-but-probably-best-for-lunch spot has a menu full of vegan offerings but doesn't leave out us meat-eaters.

After presenting my Groupon, I proceeded to order a soup, a ""sammich"" (rather than a salad), and my choice of any pastry (but I chose a simple cookie because that's what the offer had read).

Soup of the Day (normally $4.95 w/ entree, $5.95 without): today's black eyed pea soup was actually my favorite part of the meal. It was a hot, comforting, soup with a vegan-yet-hearty broth and not-overcooked legumes and vegetables. I almost thought that the plastic container was going to deform with that heat, and I contrary to scientific pursuit, I simply opened the lid and finished the entire soup right then and there.

The Complicated Order (normally $12.90): it's rather simple if you just think of it as a super loaded BLT. It's the ""LGBTQ"" (another menu sandwich) plus avocado and turkey, and they anti-skimp on the turkey. For reference, the LGBTQ itself is pretty much a BLT but as follows: Lemon vinaigrette, mixed Greens (both inside and as side salad), Bacon jam (and bacon strips), Tomatoes, and ""Q-Cumber,"" plus a basil aioli and their ciabatta bread that's pretty much all you can choose from if you're not gonna go gluten-free.

I almost felt as if I were eating a stacked pastrami deli, albeit with no pastrami and several other layers instead. It was huge, it was meaty, and I enjoyed pretty much every ingredient moderately. I've gotten more intense flavors from other sandwiches (well, one particular sandwich-specializing shop in town), but this is quite delicious for something that might be labeled as healthy.

Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2.25): this could use a crunchy exterior, but it's a very chewy cookie with a lot of oomph (read: thickness) and good chocolate flavor. It's clearly not the butter-rich cookie fresh from your grandma's oven, but it's somewhat addictive all the same. I appreciated that it's pre-sealed in plastic because I was pretty full from the other parts of lunch, so I ate this cookie just before writing the review.

I could definitely see myself coming back to Bronze Cafe for more of their take on fresh and often (but not exclusively) vegan food. The Center is a very friendly and inviting space, and they have a great parking lot, so don't let the Downtown Las Vegas location dissuade you as it somewhat did me.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,6,4,euRQSJ4foEOTD9ZObh5KAg

I'll qualify my review by saying I don't eat lunch out much, so there might be other excellent places out there, but my boxed lunch yesterday was the best I have had in Vegas and very comparable to the delicious boxed lunches I used to get occasionally at meetings in Denver that were catered by Udi's, for anyone who is familiar with them.",hkIJZTRZ0Lgy3UiU_J8FnA,2,2,5,iKLCBrAgonshmvlkA_cAhA

I tried to find this place once and was really confused and then gave up. I guess I wasn't expecting it to be in building that doesn't look like it would house a restaurant/café such as this. 

I had the LBTQ----- I think it had one more letter but for some reason it currently escapes me. Let's just say I don't think you could put anymore bacon on the sandwich. I mean you could try but I don't think it is possible. WoW all that yummy bacon. Topped with a basil aioli, on a chabata bun with fresh veggies. This sandwich was amazing and fresh. I would never expect it to come from a place that  looks like an old library. I really wish this were a more apparent restaurant some where. The prices screem fresh and high over head which i don't think fits the local. Don't get me wrong I will be back the next time i am in the area.

So have used Yelp to try to find healthy alternatives across the country. Found Bronze Cafe online and have it a try - awesome food, awesome service, lived up to the Yelp acclaims. I got the Green Goddess sandwich, and have to agree the fresh soft bread makes this sandwich. Delicious and love the salad with it with tangy lemony dressing. My husband got The Bizness David's Version and raved about it. It is possible to eat healthy and enjoy it if all the food tastes like this!

Let me preface by saying I am not a big sandwich person. Additionally, lunch for me has to be hearty meal, which sandwiches are usually not. But nonetheless, a friend a I decided to check it out for lunch one day we weren't too famished. The Center is very nice, with ample parking and big, big windows. I think they could use a bit more vegetation outside, what with the white walls, white stones, white fences, etc. But it gives the place a nice, light, airy feeling. 

The Café is right at the entrance, and they have a couple of tables to enjoy your lunch at. We placed out order (LGBTQ for me) and since no tables were available, we took a seat at the lounge chairs in the back by the library. I can understand how they are trying to offer a community space to hang out at, what with the free Wi-Fi and comfy chairs, but really the tables should be for eating. People were taking their dear time, and although the chairs we sat at were comfy and there was a little table to place our food on, it would've been better to sit at a table. Just saying.

On to the food! The sandwich was THE BOMB! It was incredible! Best BLT I've ever had in my life. Period. Also, it looks like a small portion but I ended up very satisfied at the end. My only complaint would be that the tomatoes could've been a bit more ripe but other than that is was delicious and I will definitely be coming back, and often!",Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ,7,1,4,gVp-7d086e2On6C9Zv92Hg

The Bronze Cafe is a hidden gem inside of a ""center"" that supports and welcomes all of our friends within the LGBT community. I'm kicking myself for not paying attention to the name of the facility, but it looks brand new and the people are very friendly. 

The menu offers a variety of sandwiches, salads, speciality dishes, and smoothies. There are definitely vegetarian and vegan options as well. I felt healthier just reading the menu. I ended up ordering The Bizness salad which is a kale based salad with your choice of three toppings. The toppings aren't just the typical salad options either, they're gourmet veggie options like Brussel sprouts (which were bomb) and spicy chickpeas (also a good choice). One of the best parts about this place is the portions. They are very generous for the amount!! I appreciated it because I was starving. 

Another cool service is that they have a delivery option for a small $3 fee (within the zip code). They did warn that they have limited drivers, but I like that the option is there in addition to the Eat 24 option for delivery.

4261737,2015-09-18,1,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"This place is a gem!

Had a free afternoon and came in here to grab some lunch. I had totally spaced the fact that I had a Groupon that had expired. Right off the bat, I was greeted and they were super cool with letting me use that expired Groupon (some places can be sort of leery about using the value of the price paid, which is an actual Groupon policy) . They also have a discount for students! They asked me instead of me prompting them with that question. They also asked if I wanted a cup of water. I just really love places that offer awesome things unprompted. 

I decided on The Complicated Order without aioli. It was such a serious sandwich. I could barely take a bite! The ciabatta bread was fresh and the warm turkey was great paired with the bacon jam. I really dug that bacon jam was generously piled on and it was not super sweet as some bacon jams tend to be. Rounded out with the crisp cucumbers and lettuce, it was a great sandwich. 

Now I am about to write an entire paragraph about lettuce. I have only recently learned that I hate lettuce on sandwiches. All sandwiches seem to have a soggy piece of iceberg lettuce that wilts when it touches a warm sandwich. Or the lettuce is just a bunch of bulky filler that offers no flavor. Don't get me wrong, I am obsessed with salads and I love certain types of lettuce. But really, iceberg  is gross and maybe only serves to make someone feel better about eating a burger or something. But this sandwich has mixed greens and the greens are dressed in a vinaigrette! It works! It is the first time that I have been happy to actually eat lettuce on my sandwich. 

I plan on coming back here again to try out some of their other items. Maybe something in the opposite direction (vegan) of what I ordered.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,8,6,5,tl6BNDH49sNdjQBLwabnyg
4262630,2014-10-12,0,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"After mentally bookmarking this place for several months, it pains me to say we were rather disappointed after making the trek over here today.
We were promptly and happily greeted by staff upon entering. It must've been obvious it was our first time (I'm sure the long pondering period and questioning glances to each other had something to do with it) and we were graciously extended help with choosing what to order which was appreciated.
 I went with the ""Complicated Order"" and my boyfriend chose the ""Guac and Mole."" We also ordered a 16oz cantaloupe/chia seed juice and a Ghirardelli mocha. We were brought these beverages first, and immediately we questioned why the cantaloupe juice was a huge 24oz. We didn't order that size. Were we unknowingly charged for that size? Did they run out of 16oz? Who knows. I already paid. And tipped, for that matter. A little too embarrassing to squabble over after the fact. 
Over 10 minutes later our sandwiches were brought to us. Seems like a little long to put two sandwiches together, but maybe that's just me. Even more annoying that once our food was set down and repeated to us, both my boyfriend and our server realized they'd gotten my boyfriend's order wrong. The sandwich was yanked away and we were left to share my own as we were both too ravenous to wait any longer. By the time his sandwich was corrected and brought to us some 10 additional minutes later, he'd already finished the other half of my own. We were given a simple ""Sorry for the wait."" No compensatory anything was given as retribution for putting a damper on lunch. Mind you, $40 later.
Not a good first impression left. What peeves me the most about this entire experience is the fact I tipped these people 20% prior to even receiving our food. Completely undeserved. Nobody's fault but my own, but definitely a learning experience going forward. 
We're no vegans or vegetarians, but we still appreciated the high quality of the food we received. It just wasn't good enough for us to go out of the way coming back here.",pgMxiwSL7Hhz98jxCkYqHA,4,1,3,Ms4--iwJ1mODgTRFyQRnuQ

The food is phenomenal, and the menu has a pretty solid range of options depending on your dietary preferences. I've only had their sandwiches (no salads or soups), but every sandwich is tasty, filling, and not something you'll find elsewhere. I'd also recommend picking up a drink and something sweet to complete the meal -- my go-to order is the Miss Piggy with a large blended chai and a strawberry oat bar (or strawberry cookie). 

The staff also deserves a shout-out, as they are always friendly, welcoming, and eager to give you the best service possible!

P.S.: When you're there, check out the gigantic yarn/woven mural of the city across from BC -- it's incredibly detailed and you'll want to stare at it for hours!",xoM1PfPwdY5HC0bfwM8cOQ,7,6,5,VLZDbMmcDjuPC_mEg7l9QA

I also think I have fallen in love with a sandwich and it couldn't have a better name... The Miss Piggy! This delicious sandwich comes with a creamy, phenomenal Green Goddess chicken salad, stuffed between a fluffy ciabatta bread. I've never had Green Goddess anything before and I have to say, it is life changing! Why haven't I been having this on EVERYTHING I eat?! Sandwich also comes with red onions, tomato, and arugula/salad mix. Plus an extra helping of salad on the side.

While here I also tried their Coconut Curry Mushroom soup (the soup of the day). Creamy, with a kick, and plump toothy mushrooms. I did not get an actual cup, but my friend liked it so much she ordered it for her lunch.

Lastly - do not overlook their baked goods because you will miss out on something delicious.

Extremely well-priced and all of the fabulous reviews on here from fellow Yelpers are spot on! This place IS a gem. I had the Tree of Life Pita which came with a side salad and it was a lot of food for what you pay and way better than anything advertised as ""healthy"" on the strip!

Then you see they have a great choice of sandwiches and salads, which are wonderful.  I had the BLT essentially, but they have a way cuter name for it.  Anyway, it is FULL of bacon, and a heavenly little thing called bacon jam (see my review of Honey Salt another place which supplies this wonderful condiment).  I had a latte which was awesome, and then we checked out their baked goods.  I had a loving v. virginia which is the legalization of marriage between a cookie and a brownie.  It was such a cute name I HAD to get it and it was worth the $3.95, although being a bit of a baker myself I think it could have been cooked a little less.  Now, the only reason it is not getting five stars is that there is not too many tables, but here's the thing, it's a CENTER and probably not meant to be a restaurant, but that's ok!

Original Review:
My office is nearby so I've visited the Bronze Cafe lots of times. The food is great - lots of healthy, fresh veggie options & good stuff for you meat eaters too. The coffee is great as well.  

My usual is the Tree of Life Pita. Soooo yummy. The Guac and Mole is good too.  The baked treats (including vegan options) are so tempting & yummy.  They also have vegan soups every day. I tried a sample of their new black eyed pea soul today...very good and sure to be a favorite when the weather gets cooler. 

They have gluten free options too if that's a concern for you. 

Check it out...great place to grab coffee or lunch!",cEZvNv7G9N5VsmiGhfKfwA,0,0,5,Zv3VDN6sWIdseqSEakQKXQ

Located at The Center, this cafe serves up delicious sammiches guaranteed to leave you satiated and satisfied. One of my friends went to order and I ran to ""the john"" as soon as we got in, which were clean. Then out I went to get some grub.

There are so many options to choose from, and I couldn't choose one.  I knew I wanted something savory, and asked for some help from behind the counter.  The Guac & Mole was suggested which had avocado, vegan mole, carrots, cucumber, alfalfa sprouts, vegan ranch dressing and lemon vinaigrette all on ciabatta. I ordered the watermelon juice with chia seeds with it, too.  

One of my friends had got her food already and I waited patiently for mine.  My food came out and it was presented so nicely.  The sandwich was cut so perfectly and the salad looked so fresh.  I took one bite and could not stop. The mole to guacamole ratio was the bomb! Everything was paired so nice and the bread was toasted to perfection! My savory craving was met and surpassed. There is a certain temperature when eating sandwiches, sound silly, but not too cold, and not too hot like I'll be coming down with something in a few hours.  My teeth are also sensitive to extreme temps.  Luckily this was just right. I can't complain the slightest as I was completely happy with the temp. The juice was very refreshing as well.

We were all loving our sammiches! I didn't want my sammich to end, but unfortunately, all good things come to an end, and my sammich was gone.

I recently got transferred over to a new location for my job, & I was pretty bummed out because I had all of my ""go to"" lunch spots by my old store.  Luckily I came across some great reviews of the Bronze Café on yelp & I'm glad I can add this spot onto my new list of lunch spots.

The first time I came to this Café I got lost trying to find it.  I was expecting a stand alone café but it's actually inside a community center.  When you get inside, it somewhat resembles a student services center or library.

Now on to the menu, there were a ton of things I saw on the menu that I wanted to try but I went with the more popular items that were reviewed.

FOOD:

LGBTQ- A twisted version of the class BLT that we're all used to.  This one definitely takes the cake!  I love anything with bacon & this sandwich not only has strips of maple bacon, but also bacon jam spread onto their ciabatta bread.  I was a little hesitant about the cucumber but it actually compliments that sandwich and gives it that fresh little crunch when you eat it. I crave this sandwich often! (my favorite)

Green Goddess Chicken Salad Sandwich-  This sandwich was really delicious and although its chicken salad you don't feel the heaviness of a typical chicken salad in your stomach.

Hummus- Their hummus is really tasty & they serve it with warm pita bread.  It's a great side dish that only costs an additional $2.25 if you get a sandwich.  Sometimes I'll just get the hummus by itself and eat that for a light lunch.

Vegan Banana Boy Bait-  I'm not a fan of bananas or banana flavored items, but the Banana Boy Bait is an exception!  I sometimes just crave this and this alone, it could be a good snack or even a dessert.  It's not too sweet and the banana flavor isn't too overpowering.




DRINKS:

Vegan coconut almond blend-  This was the first drink I purchased here and I really liked the concept.  It's blended with coconut water and they added almond butter for texture.

But my all time favorite drink from the Bronze Cafe is the Matcha Green Tea Blended.  The drink is not too sweet and not too heavy, it's my favorite green tea smoothie I've ever had here in Vegas.",eo775Ge7MXWqqHpOBDI5IQ,4,1,5,eTqzFqOR9ZQNJweG_QcavQ

I stumbled upon Bronze Cafe a couple years ago after doing a search for ""vegan"" in Las Vegas, and I now eat here at least once a week. It's a great place for vegans and non-vegans as they have plenty of items with meat as well as without. Their produce as well as their baked goods are all fresh. The staff is always friendly. I'm not strictly vegan but I love vegan restaurants because they tend to have so much more flavor. Many vegan restaurants here in Vegas tend to miss that flavor boat so they tend to fail in comparison with vegan restaurants in LA (*drool). I can say with complete confidence that Bronze Cafe would do very well in LA even with the competition.

Don't judge it by its location or easy and simple atmosphere... There's a few select items that pack an amazing punch with every bite that will blow its competitors out of the water. 

Loved the Tree of Life Pita - Even if you're not Vegan or Vegetarian, its a must try.  This is my personal favorite and go to.  The flavors are excellent together.

Thai Salad - Wonderful and yummy with great flavor

The Complicated order - If I feel like being bad, this is it.  Packed with loads of bacon (that I think are done in the oven because its not greasy) and turkey.  I couldn't put it down, but I was stuffed afterwards.

The other sandwiches were good, but the Tree of Life and Complicated order my favorites. 

Sides - some were better than others, but not because they were bad but they weren't as exciting as the sandwiches.  With flavors this good, you have a lot to live up to with each bite.  And they were great about letting us sample them. 

They also have a slow drip cold coffee device right by the register that looks fun... I don't drink coffee, but I was told it takes 8 hours to brew.

I love the service.  Even though its a simple cafe, they are great.  Super friendly and attentive.  A definite must try!  And the best part is they deliver.

First of all, we were warmly greeted by the manager David, who made it a point to ask us for all our names after we ordered. We came in just planning to get a few juices and smoothies, but left trying quite a few items on the menu. After ordering Raw Vegan Superfood smoothie (which is so tasty and creamy), we ended up staying for a lot longer.

First of all, the LGBTQ Sandwich - OK, I've had BLTs and I've had Bacon Jam. The housemade bacon jam is a godsend. There is nothing I've had like it, it's meaty, savory, smokey, and sweet. Get this sandwich!

David also made an off menu sandwich for us called ""The Complicated Order"", it's a GLBTQ crossed with ""The What What"" (which is a fantastic sandwich in itself). AWESOME, even better than the LGBTQ.

The scones we tried (Bacon Jam and Poblano Cheddar) as well as the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cookie and the Loving vs. Virginia (a brownie baked with a chocolate chip cookie on top) were all unique, but most importantly, incredibly tasty. 

We also sampled the Swedish Oatmeal, which was yummy along with being satisfyingly creamy and hearty.

We also had a chance to meet Paul, the chef and I made it a point to tell him how awesome everything is. Along with David, I'd definitely make it a point to stop by here whenever I'm in town.

5090431,2014-01-17,0,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"Today was my second visit to Bronze Cafe at The Center.  My first trip was during a Las Vegan Eatz Dinner club event, where I (along w/ about 40 other people) enjoyed tastings of EVERY SINGLE VEGAN ITEM ON THE MENU!  I was thoroughly impressed!  While I'm a fan of chick'n & ""beef"" - I do also enjoy when a chef can create fabulously fulfilling delightful and flavorful food - without any of the ""fake"" items.

I've been meaning to go back (like every day since) but the location is a bit outside of my normal travels.  Today at work, it was ""fried food"" day at our company cafeteria/dining room.  I was craving something not so terrible for my diet - I wanted something FEEL GOOD.  So I decided to make the drive over to Bronze Cafe.

It was busy, but not overwhelming.  Seating inside is limited so I took my order to go and ate at the picnic tables outside.  I decided to order my favorite sandwich from my previous tasting event - which was the Guac & Mole.  People rave about it - so I just had to try it.  (PS Paul Graham from Eating Vegan in Vegas did a fantastic review on the joint (and this sandwich) - http://eatingveganinvegas.tumblr.com/post/56611156953/the-bronze-cafe-continues-to-share-the-love )

The Guac & Mole is a vegan sandwich on perfectly baked ciabatta bread (if they don't bake this stuff in house - I want to know where they get it! - filled with avocado, alfalfa sprouts, shredded carrots, cucumber, lemon vinaigrette, vegan mole, and house made vegan ranch.  I realized about half way through the sandwich that I was actually smiling while eating my meal - there you have it, my mouth was happy!

I also took two of their 'bars' to go (but quickly devoured them when I returned to my desk).  I chose the Vegan Almond Apricot Bar (crunchy, chewy, soft, gooey - all of those good things, all rolled into one!) and the Vegan Blueberry Bar (think blueberry muffin, but not greasy w/ a nice crisp top.

What's also great about this place is they also have plenty of non-vegan options for your meat eating friends!

I think Bronze Cafe may be my all-around favorite spot for a casual lunch (or dinner). Their sandwiches are out of this world. I'm a sucker for vegan/vegetarian friendly places as I'm generally not a huge meat-eater.

Their veg sandwiches are pretty great. They're more than just some vegetables slapped between some bread. They're flavorful & delicious! My favorite veg-friendly sandwich is the The Good Earth: roasted vegetables, spring mix, hummus, sprouts, lemon vinaigrette, and spicy sunflower seeds all on a soft & delicious pita. I like this over the Tree of Life Pita. My go-to non-veg sandwich here which I consider to be one of the most delicious sandwiches... well... in all of Las Vegas is called The Complicated Order. It's an LGBTQ (that's a sandwich) w/ avocado & turkey ;D That's housemade bacon jam, maple-glazed bacon, spring mix, tomato, basil aioli, and lemon vinaigrette, avo, & turkey on a toasted ciabatta. Much bun-love here. Much everything love.

They have salads and the usual cafe suspects. I really like their Bizness. It's a massaged kale salad base + any 3 sides. A little steep at $10 but it's still worth it to me. It's mighty delicious and you get a pretty healthy serving. You really can't find better vegetarian food in Vegas. It's rare and hard to come by here. This ain't LA people! My favorite sides are the beet salad, roasted mushroom, roasted potatoes. Skip the curry quinoa. But really, there's so much mix & matching possibilities just try whatever sounds good to you. Their sides menu is huge! You're bound to find something you'll like. 

In addition to their relatively large food menu, they also have some great drink selections. Pineapple Mint Chia anyone? Also have protein shakes and other blended drinks for your post-workout reward. The Real Results shake is vegan & gluten free. It's quite delicious: housemade almond milk, kale, PB, vegan protein, dates, cacao, maca, & flax. Whew, that's a mouthful. It really is. More like a meal replacement.

This place would normally get a solid 5 star review from me, but heres why they ""generously"" got a 2 star only. My friend ordered the ""California Turkey"" and I got the ""Complicated Order"" which both have turkey in it. We both got the ice blended chai as well. Then within about an hour later when we got home, we both started feeling nauseous and sick and showed signs of food poisoning... I mention also that I have a very strong stomach and don't normally ever get sick from food when other people who ate the same food has in the past. We also are not allergic to anything and Bronze Cafe was literally the only food we have had all day.

I called the cafe and wanted to just let them know we got sick from the food so they dont make anyone else sick because that would be awful. The young man who answered was very polite and said he would let the manager know. A few moments later surprisingly the manager called back and said they were going to check all the ingredients and was extremely apologitic and gave a full refund on the order ticket even though I didnt ask for it which was very nice of them. 

I can see how maybe an ingredient that was ""off"" might of been served to us. As some of the staff look very young (some look younger than 15 years old) they probably werent trained on proper food preparation or have the attention to detail required to safely handle food? It's a shame really, because the sandwiches here are outstanding and delicious. 

It'll take some time for us to have the courage to come back here and eat. Getting sick from eating out isnt a laughing matter and has to be taken seriously! Thankfully the manager handled it with us in a very professional and courteous manner.",Hze9r06sEb-EXEFPwwBTIA,9,8,2,2BVrzZ3fQHUymPKlhRkvuQ

5237465,2017-09-02,4,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"We've visited Bronze Cafe a few times after a good workout. We love the vegan items on the menu. We had the Tree of Life Salad, chocolate and fig smoothie (it was a little too sweet for my taste), banana bread (delicious), The Bizness and a few veggie drinks for the kids. The staff has always been consistently gracious and helpful. The wait time was not too long (during lunch rush hour), and we were able to grab a few tables located within the center. The prices are comparable to the prices for vegan food in my hometown of ""San Francisco"", so don't be shocked with the overall tab. I guess one could never place a price tag on good, healthy food. Also, the order counter and register checkout placement is a bit oddly configured (goes from left to right - and you have to maneuver around small tables to get to the counter to order). Regardless, I'm a fan, and I love the addition to the LGBT center. 

Tip(s): 1. The smoothies can be rather large in size, so we asked someone on staff if we can split the chocolate and fig into two portions, and they gladly accommodated our request. However, this can't be done with all smoothies - not sure why, but do inquire ahead of time, 2. The cafe is located within The LGBT Center, so be sure to look out for the exterior sign which can easily be missed on a 1-way street, 3.

Stopped in with 2 friends for a Welcome-to-Vegas-lunch because we had a bit of time to kill before our hotel was ready for us to check in. Couldn't have been more impressed with all the options, and the staff was so welcoming I thought we might stay all day just to chat.

Between the three of us, we ordered:
-- the California turkey with the most delicious gluten free bread that has ever existed!!
-- the Complicated that comes with a bacon jam I could eat every day for the rest of my life
-- and the Guac and molé with the additional spicy jalapeño cilantro vinaigrette, which is not to be missed.

The range of breakfast and dessert items looked almost too good to pass up, but the sandwiches (which all came with a yummy side salad) were more than enough to fill up on.

The cafe is a bit hard to find, as they're not allowed to promote/have a lot of signs because of their association with a nonprofit. It is so worth it though, and once you find it, I'm sure you'll return! I will definitely be back on my next Vegas trip.",XqYxRgCwv94CWbEgakuUDw,14,13,5,EKDCvDhM88Hw43vvHwa5Cw

Here I was circling around and around the Center looking for a stand alone establishment like an idiot. I had to pull up the Yelp app to figure out where this place was. Guess I should've read some reviews before stopping by lol. Derp :P

THE GOOD EARTH PITA ($9.95): A veggie pita that was ""too healthy"" for my tastes. I like grease and fried food and am probably the most unhealthy vegetarian that has ever existed, but hey, that's just me. The pita was loaded with an assortment of cold veggies and spilling over with each bite. The best parts of the pita were the sunflower seeds and hummus. 3/5   

VIBE: Reminded me of the cafeteria at a hospital. There's a few large tables seating 4+ people available and sofas further out. I would feel kind of awkward eating here by myself since Bronze Cafe seems more so geared towards groups. 

SERVICE: No complaints here. The ordering style is exactly like Starbucks. 

PRO TIP: Military & Students get a 10% discount.

Worth a Return Visit?
My fellow Yelpers obviously disagree with me here but it's unlikely that I'll return to Bronze Cafe. The prices are expensive for what you're getting. However, if you're into eating healthy and like soup, salad, and sandwich places, the Bronze Cafe is worth looking into it.

Located within the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada, a space more commonly referred to simply as ""The Center,"" Bronze Café had long been on my list of places to visit and seeking coffee plus free WiFi near downtown on Saturday I finally decided to drop in, the smiling staff greeting me warmly as I entered while several patrons sat throughout the atrium using a bank of supplied computers or looking through literature supplied in a small library toward the back of the room.

Admittedly located in a rough part of Las Vegas, the surrounding environs largely comprised of rundown housing with no shortage of panhandlers to be found on the streets, the interior of The Center seems to act as a sort of sanctuary to those in the community and with free services available ranging from HIV-testing to prevention and sex education the environment is both open and inviting, the electronic music overhead perhaps a bit of a distracter but certainly not so loud that it cannot be ignored.

Offering a selection of soups, salads, sandwiches, baked goods, and smoothies running the gamut from mundane to esoteric with options for vegetarians, vegans, and those dining gluten free in addition to several options featuring meat, it was entirely in the pastries that my investigation of the café's goods was undertaken and treated to a vegan smoothie shot as I waited for coffee to be brewed I'll admit I was pleasantly surprised, the apple and banana with light vanilla doing an admirable job of offsetting the bitterness oft associated with the greens.

Sipping the espresso over ice, a bold brew with a nutty finish at less than half what one would pay for Starbucks on the Strip, it was with seven items plus a gifted Fruity Pebbles Treat from owner David Mozes that the tasting took place and beginning the rainbow treat a theme of strong flavors and excellent textures quickly arose, any 'artificalness' associated with the commercial cereal completely lacking in a vegan strawberry cookie with a jam center that ranks amongst the best in the city with a pudding smooth mouthfeel and light creamy top-notes.

Trying best to progress light-to-rich it was next in the slightly dry oatmeal cookie that I partook and setting this aside in favor of hopefully better things a bite of the bacon-jam scone proved to be far softer than one might expect from the British tea-time staple, though the savory jam and ample use of butter was none-the-less quite delicious beneath a light sprinkling of sugar with subtle sweetness dispersed beneath.

Entirely impressed by the peanut butter riff on a Snickerdoodle with ample cinnamon and sugar helping to mellow the otherwise rich base it was with equal balance that fruits and vegetables interacted to create the ultra-moist chocolate zucchini bread with the sort of richness that spoke to high quality cocoa, the similarly soft banana-flax cake perhaps a better choice for those desiring something more subtle with a light nuttiness from the fractured seeds coming through on the finish but not a bit of oil or bitterness to be found.

At this point seeing the soundtrack transition to upbeat Spanish dance music as a large group of teens plus a young family with grandparents in-tow sat down to breakfast it was finally in ""The Loving v. Virginia"" that I indulged and having previously tasted no fewer than a dozen takes on the cookie-meets-brownie including Brooklyn's famous ""Brookie"" from Baked I'm confident to say that the version at Bronze Café may be the very best of them all - the chocolate base reminiscing of my childhood afternoon snack while the dollop of dough at the center was just seconds short of fully set, the whole far greater than the sum of its parts and something probably best shared, or at least enjoyed with a cup of coffee, milk...or in the case of Bronze Café, perhaps some almond mylk. 

Setting aside a location that some may find a bit intimidating for any number of personal misperceptions, Bronze Café is the sort of place that is likely to go overlooked by all but those who walk through the doors of The Center, but with strong sourcing, friendly service, and a menu as inclusive as the building in which it is housed it can only be said that there is a whole lot more here than meets the eye, and a whole lot of things to tantalize the tastebuds as well.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,18,14,4,2_TRpLyq1qI0afqoqBjsrw

After a nice morning at the gym, my sister and I finally went here after months of talking about it. I keep hearing positive comments about this place. They have vegan, gluten-free and regular options. But fear not, they have bacon if that's your thing.

Coconut Almond Blended:
I absolutely have a strong dislike of anything coconut. But with my lucky experiences of getting something I hate and ending up liking it (for the past few months) inspired me to get this. Well, I can add this to the list. It tasted like a very mild horchata. Pleasantly and surprisingly delicious! 5/5

Kale Apple Banana Smoothie:
The taste of kale reminds me of a fruit I ate when I was little, Spanish plum. So drinking kale + other fruits isn't foreign to me. This was a little sweetness to it and a nice tart flavor. 5/5

Iced Coffee:
I'm not a big coffee drinker but THIS was good. It takes them 8 hours to make. It wasn't bitter and I didn't feel the need to add anything to it. 5/5

The Hummus:
Comes with warm pita and olives on top. I ate around the olives since I'm allergic to them. Freshly made and delightful. 4/5

The Agrodolce Brussels Sprouts:
Roasted Brussels sprouts with Italian sweet and sour vinaigrette. The sprouts looked a bit overcooked but when you eat them, they still have that crunch. The vinaigrette was a bit tangy and refreshing. 5/5

The Curried Quinoa:
Quinoa, dried cranberries, almonds, parsley with sweet curry. Lots of textures and flavors. Quinoa and almonds are good non-meat protein sources minus LDL's. Cranberries are good for the ladies. 5/5

The Bizness:
Chopped kale with lemon vinaigrette. You can pick and choose 3 side items or roasted chicken / bacon / avocado to put in this salad. So, if you get a combo that sucks then, it's your fault! Accountability 101. But no worries, all the sides they have are good. 5/5

The Banana Boy Bait:
This got me singing ""hey you're such a pretty boy. Hey you're such a pretty boy. You're so pretty"". Banana bread with natural sweeteners. The top has a little crunch to it. They bring it to you hot. Yuuuuuummm!!! I was supposed to split this 50/50 with my sister but quickly ended up at  60/40 - she caught me before it went to 80/20. ""I'm saving you from calories."" 5/5

The roasted vegan sandwich served on wheat bread is good, but I would change it out to the pita the next time. Add a side for $2 and it is a full meal.

So much can change from visit to visit that I always find it a bit presumptuous to assume that a place is 5 stars worth of awesome or 1 star worth of non-awesome based on one measly visit.   And yet one measly visit to the Bronze Cafe, oh, 2 hours ago, and here I am anointing it with 5 stars.   

Enter the Tree of Life.   The Tree of life stars Brad Pitt in a Malick film about the life and the universe.   Yelp/RottenTomatoes Crossover alert!   Okay so this Pita stuffed with veggies and other vegan goodies like a cashew crema and a brazil nut crumble has nothing to do with the movie, but much like I had left the theater after seeing Tree of Life, I had a lot of questions about this Tree of Life after I left Bronze Cafe.   Namely:  was that one of the tastiest pita breads I've ever had? (yes).    Did I really just enjoy a Pita stuffed without any meat products?  (yes).   Did I really just order something called ""Banana Boy Bait""?  (YES)   Well how I really ordered it was I said something along the lines of ""and one of those banana bread things"".    Then the guy who seemed to be running the joint goes ""Banana Boy Bait?!""  to which I looked around sheepishly before saying yes.   It's totally worth any stares you might receive though.   It lasted all of 3 minutes on the table.   I'm not joking when I say I plan to try every sandwich and every Vegan dessert on the menu before my own personal Tree of Life wilts away and has me feasting on dirt and worms.   

Service was friendly, quick and efficient.   The dining area was clean and there wasn't any air of pretentiousness that I think Vegan friendly places can oftentimes be stereotyped with.   In fact it was the complete opposite.

I didn't need to use the restroom so I didn't get to participate in the gender neutrality that it provides.

I love their attention to detail in their recipes. Nothing is halfway done. The bacon jam is a perfect example of how they have elevated their take on a BLT (the LGBTQ) and made it an exception sandwich. I regularly crave this ""bacon experience"" and recently found out that you can get it in salad version. Super exciting.

Everything I have tried has been delicious. Other than the LGBTQ, I particularly enjoy the Matcha Blended Latte, the beet, quinoa and kale salad and the lentil carrot salad.

The Tree of Life is by far the best dish for Vegans- but the cheesecake. Oh the cheesecake. They have different flavors all the time, so don't expect to get the one you want- the ones I have tried are the Green Tea, Chocolate, and Raspberry. They are by far the best vegan cheesecakes I have ever had. Ever.

Now for the drinks, the honeydew, watermelon, pineapple, and cantaloupe. Honeydew is the most refreshing in my opinion, not too sweet or powerfully flavorful. Watermelon is good, but sweet, and the pineapple is tasty, but also sweet. They are all really good and a great alternative to sodas or powered waters since they are fresh squeezed with no added sugar or water.

They also no have a new item, the Chocolate Ambrosia Sandwich with white chocolate raspberry bread for less than 5$ and it is to DIE FOR.

The food was pretty good, though the price for what you got wasn't the best. The vegan sandwiches were around $10, and most of it was lettuce. They did put a decent amount of avocado in, and the vinaigrette and cashew crema on top were tasty, but the crema was only barely dribbled on. I was hungry again within an hour of eating. Again - really liked the sandwich, but it just was not very substantial. If they were more like $7, I'd have no complaints.

They do have nice coffee, and will refill your cup within 2 hours of purchase. They also don't charge extra for almond milk, which is amazing! They also have vegan cheesecake and some other muffins, though I didn't try any.

Ordered online through EAT24 and then picked up on Tuesday 2-2-16 at 5:15 PM.  This is not really a restaurant, it's more like a small cafe inside ""The Center"" which is located on Maryland between Charleston and Fremont St.  The center is unique in that it is very LBTGQ friendly and has gender neutral bathrooms.  
.
$26.64 got me a bizness salad, a David's special salad, and a strawberry cookie. 
.
$9.95 The bizness salad is just a bed of kale with their lemon vinagrette ""massaged"" into the kale and then you pick three sides to go on top of the kale.  I opted for ranch dressing instead of the vinagrette and picked roasted broccoli and hemp hearts, carrot & lentil salad, and curried quinoa.  A nice young man from the cafe called me after I placed my order and said they discontinued the carrot and lentil salad and today I see they have removed it from their menu on EAT24 so kudos to them for that.  I chose brown rice instead of the carrot salad.  When I got home I noticed the broccoli was missing but I went back and checked my order and it wasn't on there so either I forgot to checkmark the broccoli box or there was a glitch in the system.  ¯\_(?)_/¯  Their ranch dressing tastes bottled and I didn't like it but the kale was nice and tender and the quinoa was delicious.

$11.95 David's special salad had thinly chopped kale massaged with their housemade lemon vinaigrette and topped with roasted beet/carrot/quinoa salad, curried quinoa, spiced chickpeas, shredded carrots, diced avocado, and hemp seeds.  The chickpeas are so tasty and have a light spice to them.  The beets are the first I've ever tried that I liked.  Truly a delicious and filling salad.

My favs have to be the LGBTQ sandwich (bacon jam, yes bacon jam...nuff said!), hummus and The Fruity Pebbles Cookie.  The Tree of Life Pita is also wonderful...

Even if the location is off your beaten path...it's really worth a stop.  You won't be disappointed!  I might even see on my volunteer nights at The Center!  :)",9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg,3,4,5,wRfcHfCZO_RZY_yAtvehMA

I'm not a vegetarian, but like vegetarian food (and try not to eat too much meat), so my partner and I split the Tree of Life sandwich, and the LGBTQ bacon sandwich.  Both were delicious!

On our way back home 7 days later, I made sure to time it so we could have lunch there.  This time we had the Tree of Life again (so good!) and tried the Good Earth Pita, also vegetarian and also delicious.  And, because I everything was so good, we got 2 salads (The Bizness) to go for us to have for dinner when we got home in LA a few hours later.  And yes, they were just as delicious as the sandwiches.  Oh, as was the banana bread we got for a snack for the car.

To top it off, the staff was super friendly and helpful.  We ended up meeting Peter and David, the owners, and I wish them the best of luck.  

I don't normally gush about a place like I am now, but I don't normally have delicious, healthy food at a reasonable price.  I just hope I didn't over sell it.",HWhhrOawBPtWsv7sC1gV9Q,1,0,5,crpwlxaWdelTNHPQzv6SHA

Butternut squash vegan soup has the perfect blend of spices (I like to buy 3 or 4 and take home to freezer).

We came in unknowingly at closing one night - and the doors were already locked. They saw us though the glass doors, recognized us as regulars, unlocked them and allowed us to order food before they closed up for the night. Which was over and beyond for exceptional service. Besides the staff being so great, the food is also bomb! Vegan options, fresh prepped salads, juices and slow brewed coffee and close to downtown. Thumbs up for this cafe it's more than you'd expect!",eBlyhj-Wqa6NfOmPiu3T3w,2,2,5,AAHelH45fMnZUntydxQdcg
5939931,2015-02-01,0,tMdgY7Ou4k3bYZZulJCiuQ,"The Bronze Cafe is my goto place for healthy and satisfying food.  The two items that I crave most and tend to alternate between are the vegan Thai Peanut Salad and the vegan David's Special(The Bizness Salad with all the goods ;)  ).  

The Thai Peanut Salad is my favorite pre-packaged togo salad that's perfect for popping in my fridge for work the next day.  The crisp, fresh veggies combined with the creamy peanut dressing is such a treat to have in the middle of the day.  It's the perfect amount of food and the dressing isn't too heavy or greasy so I don't feel like going into a food coma when I have so much to do still.  

The David's Special (The Bizness w/the works) is like a flavorful cornucopia of everything your parents prepared wrong for you when you were younger (sorry mom).  I HATED beets and had a weird relationship with kale before I gave them a shot in this salad. The variety of textures and flavors packed into this one salad are unbelievably good.  I like to order mine with seitan also but it's great just as is.  I've been a veg head for many years and I have never had or made a salad as good as this one.

 Having so many vegan menu options that taste so good makes it hard to decide sometimes so when I go with my friends I like to order several and share with them.  Especially the desserts, I love to get a few different flavors of the vegan cheesecakes since they change up the flavors so often. Gotta try 'em all!",zMtPMIUSunvzJdEeXXkMHw,3,2,5,VBy3bV2O9grbVWO-V0hhsw

I did circle around the building a few times before realizing it was in the building, but I'd circle around 10 more times so long as it meant eating the chicken salad sandwich I had.  The staff was super friendly, with a face like the one that greeted me how could you not leave a place happier walking out than when you walked in?  

10/10, that was the best chicken salad sandwich I have ever had.  
The menu states that there are apples in there, but do not let that steer you away from this sandwich if you are the kind of person that does not like fruit with your chicken.  Because, let me tell you, they make apples and chicken go together like peanut butter and jelly.",axXhiEv1K79RYeIKw_NLzQ,0,0,5,e7EtbPTtmpgiLsKJbEWKJw
