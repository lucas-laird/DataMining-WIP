My Chicken Freshcado, so named for the fresh ingredients, was reported to include avacado.  I found one quarter inch cube of avacado in the salsa on top of the indifferently grilled chicken.  The Three Cheese Penne did, indeed, have three cheeses.  We counted the little piles of cheese grated on top.

Our server, Deborah, seemed like she wanted to be elsewhere.  I sort of wished she had been.  While not quite surley, she was not a happy camper.  What really stood out though was that she had her fingers IN  our food dishes.  Every dish I saw her touch, not just at my table, had her fingers touching parts people might eat off of.  The water pitcher was no exception.  She had her thumb inside that as well.

If you are concerned about germs, choose a different restaurant.

  A friend and I met up for a drink, the total was only $12.20 for the both of us.  I had an appointment to get to so I paid on the convenient little self pay device at the table so my friend and I can get going.  I left a $2.00 and change tip on the machine and my friend left a five dollar bill for our server.  

  We get up to leave and as we approach the door our server the tall middle aged blonde with a short haircut shouts out in an accusatory tone for the whole restaurant to hear ""DID YOU PAY?""  Now everyone's eyes are on us like we tried to skip out on our bill.  My friend explained that we did pay and the bill was paid on the machine and she still questioned the fact!  

  We walked out highly embarrassed after basically being accused of skipping out on a $12.20 bill.  This woman offered no apology after totally embarrassing us in front of the other patrons.

The service has been consistently poor. The server ignored us for at least 30 minutes before coming to our table. She initially greeted me as she was walking by without stopping.  I arrived early for dinner and waited for my coworker. She never brought us appetizer plates and dropped a couple of napkins again while walking by without stopping. We shouldn't have left 15% tip but we are both heavy tippers so I thought 15 would send a message. The service was disappointing for being a slow evening and the food was just ok. The meat nachos my friend had contained blobs of fat she couldn't eat.  Kinda disgusting. Oh well we will find a new place for dinner and happy hour.

Applebee's wasn't my first choice for lunch today, but I went along with it anyway and was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed my dish. It would have been a 4-star experience before I tried the items on the sampler plate that my date ordered. 

I ordered the Margarita Queso Chicken and Green Goddess Wedge Salad off the take two menu. Other than the little bit of browning on the lettuce (hey, we're at Applebee's) it was really good. Still crisp, and the bacon and pecans added a good crunch. It was served with an avocado ranch that was decent, if I go again, I'd order it with a vinaigrette. My first few bites of the chicken really let me down, the thin edges were way burnt and just covered in cheese, but as I got to the meatier sections, it ended up being a juicy and pretty flavorful piece of chicken. The Spanish-style rice it was served on was good too. I finished the entire plate.

My guy got the tomato basil soup, which was surprisingly tasty- it had croutons and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top. I would consider ordering it when I come again. I was not a fan of the rest of his meal, the trio appetizer plate; the boneless chicken wings weren't a good flavor, and the meat in the quesadilla towers were questionable. I didn't try the mozzarella sticks or the fries he ordered on the side, but they looked standard. 

Service wasn't spectacular in any way, but it certainly wasn't bad. I would probably be a little less hesitant to visit Applebee's again in the future.",lluNN1aQlFN7NQQ2BxFBUQ,2,2,3,7xweBxLwKVpV06xXQdd4Bg

This is the first time i've been to Applebee's in....a while

My buddies go every year for Vets day for the free dinner. This is the first i've gone with them. My mentality with free stuff especially meals from establishments is that they cut corners to damage control giving away inventory. 

Very surprised with the 7oz sirloin steak dinners. The veggies were horribly distributed. I was swimming in carrots while my buddy had two.

The potatoes were average. There wasnt anything bad about them but then there was nothing good about them either. The portion size could count as a good thing but more of mediocre is still pretty mediocre.

The steak is what surprised me the most. For such a small piece of meat it had a lot of quality. Each bite was juicy from start to finish. Grilled medium rare so from start to finish and had that lively smokey flavor fresh from the grill.

They cut corners from the sides but wow the steak was awesome.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,0,4,Js7nVXHzVtfCdedxSisDzw

is kept clean.. service is usully friendly when we come and sit down to eat.. 

it's never a long wait for our food.. and the waiters are on top of refilling drinks and asking If everything's alright w/out being overbearing..  they also know their menus which is great because i hate when you ask what something on the menu consists of and getting an ""idk.. i can ask.""  answer.

I only give them 3 stars because of an incident when I ordered curbside.  I made an online order for pickup and sent my son inside to grab the food  [being I was not presentable to the public: hence the ordering curbside] but when we get there... no ones in the curbside pick up room.

so he  sits in that little room waiting for someone to come [which mind u is visible by the bartenders at the bar]  5 min. pass and still no one comes.  so I honk and tell him to go to the front and to tell them that he's there to pick up an order.. so he comes and out and tells me that they said they were sending someone back.  

waiting.. waiting....... waiting.

so I finally get out [pajamas and uncombed hair and all..] and have to tell the bartender that my son had been sitting in the -to go curbside pick up- room for 15 minutes waiting for someone to come back and give us our order.. he was very apologetic and called the lady who was supposed to be there.. to which I grabbed my food and let her know why her ass wasn't getting a tip...  if you know you have ppl picking up food........  have someone there.   food doesn't stay warm forever.

so anyway: my faves:  the quesadilla explosion salad.. and the trio thing they offer.  it's the best way to get a little bit of everything when you don't really know what you want.

They always seem to have fantastic deals and thats mainly the reason why my husband and I continue to come here.

Where else can you get 2 entree's and an appetizer for 20 bucks?! Especially when I order the spicy shrimp pasta and he ordered the ribs and fries. The app we decided would be the spinach artichoke dip. Overall the food is mediocre. Nothing special. Whenever we come here we notice that the food lacks some flavor. Bland? you could say so.

So we were the only ones in the joint as it had just opened. We walked right up to the bar and made our intentions very clear, 2 vodka sodas with a splash a lime please! The drinks came in a tall glass which I did like as it gives the illusion that there's more alcohol in the drink then intended. 

Don't sit at the number 6 spot at the bar as the register is there and other bartender functions I suppose and feels like the bartender is hovering over you. Totally not their fault, should have moved. The drinks worked their magic and an hour and change later I left quite satisfied. 

Oh ya the hostess doing her makeup and licking her hands wasn't cool, even if it's in the corner of the restaurant. Still saw it! Time and place home girl. And when wifey asked for water the inconvenienced look was no bueno either but hey its hump day so who knows. 

Anyone else know a place on the west side (not the old one) where you can get a drink early that's not smoking, otherwise we will be coming back, not quite four stars I'd give it 3.5 if they allowed it.

It had to be valentines night...we walk in and asked to be seated. The girl at the front says the wait is 5 minutes long. On a night like valentines, thats a really good wait time. So, me and my wife waited to be seated. It took around 10 mins to be seated. We sit down and order drinks, as most resturants do. Our waitress name is Jessica C by the way. We look over the menu and decide we want an appietiser and two meals. So, she comes back and we order all it at one time. No issue there and sounds as though it might be a really prompt meal.

A few minutes go by and we do get our appitiser first. I didnt realize that BBQ sauce came with it...no worries, we will just order/ask for ranch. To get Jessica's attention was near impossible. We finally do and i asked her for ranch sauce. No problem she said and we along her way. As we are enjoying what we can of our food, she comes back with other drinks for another guest, well i assumed that the ranch would be on this tray, but no. She gives other people their drinks and continues to take orders. By this time I getting a little heated, we are almost done with our appitiser and no ranch sauce. Again, to get her attention near impossible.. Just so happens when our main dish comes out we ask the cook for ranch and bingo in less than a minute we get it...he even asked if we wanted a little extra...

So, continue our meal...pretty pissed now. And no attention from Jessica C at all. After around 20 minutes or so I do get her attention and asked her for refills on our drinks. And yes i did mention that we got our ranch sauce already. No apology no nothing. This takes forever as well. I finally had to get the bussers attention and ask her for refills. Around 5 mins later Jessica C had our refills at our table...she blamed new customers on her delays. What she doesnt realize is that i watched her the entire time mess with that stupid computer. After a few more minutes we decided we wanted to go and asked for our check. Oh Boy that was at our table in less than a minute. I payed her for the meals and didnt leave a tip...heck no...a tip is a thank you for great service...didnt happen! Even when we left the girls at the front didnt even say thank you for coming and visiting...WE NEVER PLAN TO EVER VISIT AGAIN!!",R7_bFyf6OFcySWj55WeuUA,2,0,1,Msug2zk9KgZCKL5gKOvK6g

I started with a cup of the broccoli and cheese soup.  It was very thick and very tasty.

For the main course, I had their new Sizzling Cajun Steak and Shrimp.  It was a 7 ounce steak topped with blackened shrimp and Cajun gumbo.  The rub on the steak gave it some zing and the gumbo had some spiciness too.  The shrimp were not blackened, but they were good.  As for the gumbo, it was very tasty but I would have liked to have more than one piece of okra.

Service was very good.  Arnold, our server, was quick and coming to the table to take our order, and he was on top of iced tea refills.  

My only complaint was when the music was turned on, it was terribly loud, making a conversation impossible.  I had to almost yell to be heard just across the table.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,1,0,3,FXr661fMLNICOc4MW6d33A

I couldn't say enough about our experience! Sarah is absolutely amazing! Not only is she the perfect waitress for the service but she is perfect for the restaurant! Her detail is amazing! 
She shows pride and what she does and excitement. She truly loves what she does and she loves food! 
She upsold like crazy and we loved it! She was able to focus right in on what we liked and recommended the perfect appetizers and meals. She gave us an experience you would never expect at an Applebee's. After my hubby asked her a few things about a dish she recommended another and he took her recommendation. After he received the meal she comes back and asks ""would you like some bacon to add to that because I remember your first dish you wanted had bacon in it?"" She was an experience you just don't find enough of anymore. She was wonderful from the moment we sat down to the moment we left. She is the reason we will be returning hoping to get another experience dining with her. On top of all that she was really good conversation! 
And aside from the excellent service I was absolutely shocked at how good our food was! She altered everything happily and with recommendations to fit my dietary needs! I was blown away at how happy she was to serve us and how much it felt like she was sharing the experience with us! To be honest I didn't expect much it was close to the house so I thought I would try. But based on this one experience I can tell you I will be returning again and I absolutely recommend this Applebee's location to anyone! Yes I recommend it to even the top Yelp Elites! Try this place ask for Sarah area and tell me about your experience! I would absolutely love to hear it!

I had a lunch special that included half of a sandwich and a small salad. I had the shrimp and spinach salad which was excellent. The sandwich I went with was the California turkey club. The lettuce tasted sour, I had to pick it all off... And the bread was greasier then I would have preferred.

We called ahead to let them know we were gonna have 8 adults 5 kids. They had it set up when we got there which was easy because they were dead. We got led the weirdest route to our table around the bar.....we were sat down and I felt claustrophobic!!!  It was uncomfortable. My back was facing the booths and I could literally touch them. Now I'm 5 foot flat soooo these were close!! One person could uncomfortably walk between our chairs and the booths. 

We ordered drinks I had a kiwi iced tea, pretty good not too sweet thankfully. My mom had a perfect margarita and it was WELL MADE! Served in a tin shaker with a martini glass so it stayed cold. 

SO I always stick with the normal items but decided to try somethin new! Baaaaad idea. We went for the 2 for $24. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip which was awesome. I had the chipotle shrimp pasta(yuck) and my mom went with my usual the 9oz sirloin. My pasta had barely any sauce, bell peppers, and shrimp. The shrimp were perfect. But the ""sauce"" or lack there of was not good. I don't even know how to describe it other then that really, just don't order it. It came with a bland breadstick also!! I ended up eating the shrimp from my pasta and my moms leftovers. Moms steak was a perfect medium rare and pretty tender.  

We then ordered the maple blondie and chocolate chip cookie for dessert. I didn't care for the cookie but the blondie was out of this world!!!!! It's this hot blond brownie with vanilla ice cream, candied pecans, and a maple cream sauce. I'll have two more please!!!!

I treated my mom here on Tuesday to lunch as part of our Tuesday-Mother-And-Daughter-Day-Out (Papa fell prey to the flu, unfortunately enough). She was open to checking the place out since I told her about its all-American atmosphere - country music, can't beat that! - and $20 lunch specials. 

As soon as we got there, we were seated at a booth and Debbie, our server cheerfully took our drink orders in no time while we flipped through the menu. The last time my father and I came here, we ordered the 2 for $20 lunch with spinach and artichoke dip for appetizers and 2 entrees - Bourbon Street Chicken & Shrimp as well as the 7 oz. house sirloin (we're pretty dedicated carnivores as you might see) with unlimited tortilla chip refills! However, my mom and I, trying as we may to watch our diet, opted for something healthier. 

She eagerly narrowed her focus down to the $7.99 lunch combo deal with a choice of half a club sandwich paired with french onion soup. I, on the other hand, got the creamy parmesan chicken served with steamed spinach with mushroom rice pilaf. It was delish, so much so, that along the way, my mom asked for a slice at my chicken, then another one, then another one until she noticed all the barbecue sauce and bacon oozing out of her sandwich that she decided she wanted what I had.

It doesn't matter if there are several hundred nubile dancing Oracles handing out gas coupons along with your pinor noir; if ONE of them farts on your arm reaching for the grapes she's feeding you as she's pouring fragrant mead from the 24k gold goblet, it's all over. Such was the case at the usual emergency fallback place, the Apes on Rainbow and Spring Mountain. 

I tagged along at Sam's Club with some friends to piggyback some items when I realized (sudden, quick, painful) that I was omgfuckingstarving. Since this Ape's had treated me well many times in the past (and I had Gift Card ftw, boing boing) I might as well recommend a quick stop. Our party of five featured several freshly minted dieters, so they were pleased to see the items on the Weight Watchers menu. We ordered the Garlic Herb Chicken, Steak and Portobellos, and sizzling Fajitas with Steak and Chix. I got myself steak and chicken combo as well, which is my Usual. 

Once we started tearing into it, the silence instantly let me know that something was amiss. ""Is it just me, or is it way too salty?"" one of my dining companions said. Yes, and it wasn't just one dish; all 5 entrees and sides came out like the prep cook had just completed a triathlon, realized he had to be in at work, ran in shirtless and started loving the meats and poultry con mucho gusto.

All mastication and conversation ceased and I realized with great sorrow and regret that I had, as they say, ""thought out loud.""

Maybe it's a diabolical scheme: You can't eat it, you lose weight!

But really. It was way too salty. I was starving and determined, so I poured water on mine, got extra napkins and kept eating. But the less guerrilla folks were having none of that.  And when I brought up the scene in ""Waiting"" a few moments later, it was On Tha Floor, Out Tha Door time. 

Extra star for the amiable waitress and the Gift Card. But just because something is free doesn't necessarily make it a Good Value. How jacked is that, huh? Next stop In-And-Out.....",A2HbQtcuK2tkegX7BXcEtg,4,4,2,S_hKlio-3pk351r3GvVBtw

We sat down, ordered 2 waters, one coffee, one Pepsi and a long island ice tea. 

Coffee was so so, the Long Island ice tea was just weak and the truth of the matter is, long islands are meant to be stronger than other mixed drinks. 

I ordered a beer after because I would rather drink something with more flavor. (Imagine that) lol 

Everyone else's food came out alright

, we ordered an appetizer platter. 

Here is where the problem became about...

3 appetizers. 

Chips and salsa
Mozzarella sticks
Cheese quesadilla (no chicken) 

Don't eat meat btw* 

Sooo... 

Quesadilla came with chicken , returned it, came back again with chicken, 

Mozzarella sticks were cold meaning cheese wasn't melted 

So the chips and salsa won! Lol 

Great service I guess... lol I blame it on the kitchen because our food was returned more than once.

For appetizer it was the Spinach & Artichoke Dip which also included some salsa and when we were low on chips we asked the server to bring us some and she hooked us up.

I don't know if the server may possibly have placed her hands all over my straw where my mouth is going to go or what. I asked for a additional straw when the server went by, and she gave me such a confused look, like why I needed another straw. 
She came back with the straw in her hand lacking the paper again and a napkin wrapped around one end of it. I couldn't believe it.. I just set it on the table and forgot about even drinking my beverage. 
Perchance the straws come without paper on them, but they really have to change that because it isn't going to bring me back just on account of that. 

They had great deals on food and was just in my price range. 

The pasta I had, held no favor. I had to drench it with salt and that really didn't work any. It just wasn't a good meal, and I didn't even finish have of it.  I was thirsty and just desired to go grab a bottle of water somewhere. The server seen I didn't touch my beverage and didn't charge me for it.
