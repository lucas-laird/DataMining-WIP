My bf and I were lucky enough to get the owner as our chef.  He was fantastic!  He was entertaining without being cheesy.  He did the requisite tricks but also a few new ones.  He also made some phenomenal sauces which I had never had at other Japanese steakhouses.  I had the scallops - they were cooked perfectly and melted like butter in my mouth.  The bf had the ribeye and lobster tail.  He loved it!  If you ever want teppanyaki when you're in Vegas, head to Musashi!!",yJnZjWUsaO6ZsXD9D-P1ig,0,0,5,9I6-d9K2fCCIaVHzf2AGQQ

An intimate spot for just you and your mate or a few friends. The Chief's  amazing talent always dazzles you with a showy performance. I recommend getting teppanyaki of New York Steak & Chicken combination. A huge per portion, where I could never seem to finish, of chicken, steak, fried rice, and vegetables . Food is cooked right in front of you, so it does take time. If you are truly hungry & need something to tie you over before the meal, Shaggy dog Roll is a great way to start. A shrimp tempura roll that is topped with crab meat & drizzled with Musashi's famous ""Man Sauce"". You can find me there at least once a week.",Vl9lgnsUa9cbVdzL0CWK5w,0,0,5,LWKcm_DW8aHtKG4jfk4y2A

Anyways the first two times were excellent - unlike the other reviewers we didn't do teppenyaki and instead sat in the adjacent dining room.  They have a full fare menu from steaks to izakaya.   We ordered numerous dishes and almost everything was delicious.  This comes at a price of 30-50 a person keep in mind so it better be tasty.

The third time we went we brought some family and the service was really bad - which is really crazy since the waitress even knew someone in our party.  It is a massive pet peeve of mine when service is poor and the restaurant is straight up empty.  This put a damper on the night, since a dish or two had to go back and it got painful.  *sigh*.

The green mussels were odd, the spicy tuna rolls were almost non-existent due to their tiny size and lack of flavor. There were a couple of rolls that were pretty good but I honestly think they only seemed good because we were desperate for something to be good!  

The service was poor, including the hostess up front. They were basically unorganized. 

And finally, the lighting in the dining area was horrible. It felt like we had a spot light on us throughout our dinner. If you accidentally looked up into the light, you'd be blinded for a minute. DIM THE LIGHTS! Please. It's a simple thing to do. 

I'm thankful to live in LA where we have an abundance of delicious sushi.

She had a lot of helpful tips: it's half price after midnight, they are open for lunch (I LOVE that you can order teppanyaki without the show), make a reservation if you plan to go for dinner & the food is delicious!! 

My last visit to Musashi was last week and my friend made a reservation and requested Tiger. They had recently remodeled & the dining room looks great! At dinner, we sat with a group of first-timers who asked my friend for recommendations since the whole staff kept saying hi to her! 

For dinner, I ordered the New York steak & shrimp with fried rice. It comes with salad & soup, of course. The chefs make their own sauces & they are very accommodating if you want it spicier, sweeter, or whatever. The dinner show as hilarious; Tiger was pretty good about picking on everyone! I also think it's quite awesome that our chef is the owner. He definitely set the bar for his chefs to be as fun & entertaining.

I do not remember them putting as much garlic with their steak as they did this last time. I was not a fan, but I just enjoyed the rest of my meal.

After checking in, we noticed the host had already crossed our name off. Either someone already checked in or they marked us off, even though we showed up on time. He did try and hide the fact that he screwed up, by highlighting through my name again. He told me the wait would be about 20 minutes. After we showed up on time for our reservations. He didn't admit a mistake or anything, just told us to have a drink at their bar. We sit down at the bar, no one is behind the bar, so we aren't offered water or an alcohol menu or anything. At least give us a cup of water if you messed up.

About 10 minutes later, a loud Asian lady starting screaming at us to follow her and guides us to a table. She then starts yelling at everyone being seated that we need to sit shoulder to shoulder to each other since they are fitting two more people than the table normally holds. This indicated to me that they did give our reservation away to someone else and trying to shoehorn everyone into a cramped space was the last straw.

Me and my friend got up and told her that she could stop screaming at us, because there would be plenty of space with us gone.

6:00 pm rolled around and my fiance and I got ready to meet his friends for a birthday dinner at Marrakech, the Moroccan restaurant beside Musashi.  They got hung up at Bodies the Exhibit and finally around 8:30, we met up outside Marrakech.  It was closed.  For super bowl Sunday.  What?

Anyway, we were all starving and next door was Musashi.  Inviting, but above all open, we decided to give it a try.  The restaurant was empty aside from one gentleman at the bar, and the four of us were seated at a comfy round booth.  All of us decided on sushi.  My guy and I had the ugly redhead, da bomb, j in my mouth, and something else that I don't remember.  I also got a seaweed salad.  Birthday boy had two mai tais and said they were very good.  He and his fiance also had the sexy redhead roll, and some others.    

Our server, Alex, was funny, fun, and did a great job of staggering our rolls with the chefs so that we had an endless flow of sushi for a good hour and a half.  When we ordered j in my mouth, he told us his name was Jay, and I'm totally gullible...so when I called for Jay we all got a good laugh when he told us his real name.  With our sushi, he also brought us some of their special house sauces they've come up with.  Most of their sauces are for the teppan bar,  he said, but they are expanding into sushi condiments.

Oh yeah, and the sushi was GREAT!  My favorite by far was Da Bomb....with a nice thick slice of fresh jalepeno and lots of spicy tuna in every piece, you can't go wrong.  Everything looked very fresh, was beautifully presented, and tasted great.  Their prices are great for all the specialty rolls they offer, and I can't wait to go back again to try their hot entrees out.

Course, I'll probably end up gorging myself on sushi again....",ScAkGG5VXHNpnMYsGtaadg,3,2,5,y3DRfdxnn-LgpPy-pZOocw

The meal comes with steak (cooked however you like), lobster, shrimp, vegetables, and (fried) rice.  TIP: TRY NOT TO EAT ALL THE FRIED RICE BEFORE THE WHOLE MEAL IS SERVED...it's hard not to eat all the fried rice, but it's just so darn good!  The steak is SO flavorful, it's cooked on a bed of garlic and is so soft and tender and juicy.  The shrimp goes well with the sweet mayo sauce, one of my faves.  And the lobster is so awesome as well, it comes with butter and garlic and lemon.  They have a good choice of domestic and Japanese beer, as well as sake, and also some mixed drinks.  I love their azuki bean ice cream as well!

It's always fun to watch the chefs cook and they do amazing tricks, as well as make your food taste sooooooooooo good!  Our favorite chef is Tiger!  He's very funny, friendly, and cooks the food the best!  WARNING: Some people may find his humor a little offensive, but my family and I think it's hilarious!  So if you have a ""prude"" you're bringing to the restaurant, this is just a heads up!

Every time I go to Las Vegas, I HAVE to come here.  I tell everyone I know about this restaurant!  And that's why I'm writing this review!  I will continue to come back and enjoy my food with great people and great memories!",Y7ZxivXiCG_P_gLs_S24fg,7,5,5,19xcrdLY_XRTfNohzbSloQ

Sauces are wonderful - garlic butter with sesame sooo good, yum yum sauce was definitely yum yum, and the two hot sauces have an amazing kick. The fried rice was wonderful. The soup was great. The salad dressing was great too. The chicken and steak were both cooked perfectly.

Downsides: the chefs ""tricks"" were not too impressive, but he was a very nice guy, the wait staff lined up against the wall staring at you was unnerving, and the sushi that I ordered despite Yelpers telling me not to, was only adequate.

We would definitely return, but only for the teppenyaki.",SQ7pgCfVVj3z1loDb45mzw,0,0,4,EaNqjH2CBjI4Tn89gX9wDQ

There's a private lounge you can relax in while waiting for your table (or, other guests to arrive), and the food and entertainment was really upscale without having a check to match.

Right now, it's next to a Mongolian place we haven't tried, so that's your marker to look for.  Strongly recommend you try this!

The chef was so nice and funny too! We had shrimp, chicken and steak for our selections between the three of us and I have to say, all were equally delicious! What really stood out were the freshly made dipping sauces the chef was creating right in front of us! His creations made it heaven in our mouths, and just made everything from the veggies to the meats pop! Normally you get the same old sauces with Teppanyaki but not here, they make them right on the grill with fresh ingredients and it's that little extra touch that makes this place stand out.

It is a typical teppanyaki style Japanese restaurant, with the sushi bar/sit down area in one room, and the teppanyakis on the other side.  The chefs are good at what they do, and it's nice that they make several of the sauces for your meat and veggies right there as you watch.  Some things don't change from place to place, you get the corny jokes, the lighting things on fire, etc.  Here however, you better be ready for some rated R things as well.  So if you get offended by anything having to do with the male anatomy, tell your chef before hand so they won't make those jokes. The time I ate there with my mother I wasn't sure if she was gonna laugh or yell at the guy, but thankfully my mom's sense of humor prevailed.

On the whole, I would go back there for the food, but I kind of wish they would update the interior and do something about the smell, I know it's keeping first time customers away.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,1,0,3,EGPeEsviXf4NhSkSQ9vlxw

Don't be fooled by the fact Mushashi is inside a strip mall. Once you enter and see the wall of fame you will quickly realize this place is the REAL deal. I am pretty sure every celebrity has eaten here at some point. 

If you're lucky Tiger will cook for you and you will get dinner and a show. All of the chefs have great personalities and you will quickly fall in love with this place for the food and atmosphere.

3 stars if you get anyone else  

As the owner of the place, Tiger needs to teach all of the other chefs his exact routine.  When I first went, I got lucky enough to get Tiger, and it was the best teppanyaki experience I've ever had.  And I've been to  A LOT of teppanyaki places.  My friends wanted to get something quick, and I had to convince them to go there.  Afterwards, everyone was extremely pleased. When I went there a second time, I got another chef, and the experience was average at best. 

I was surprised that there was such a large disparity in terms of the experience because every other teppanyaki place I've been to has had consistency amongst the chefs. In other words, you can go multiple times and get different chefs, yet the food and overall experience will be extremely similar.

When we were seated on my second visit, Tiger was cooking at another table.  It seemed as if he had been going for a while.  When our chef was done, Tiger was still cooking.  He takes his time and the product reflects this. He also spends a long time making fantastic sauces.  My chef only used the generic sauces from the bottle. Not to say that he was bad - the food was still good.  But I was surprised that the overall product would be so different between the chefs.  So definitely request Tiger. And hopefully he'll start training the other chefs to make a product similar to the outstanding quality of his",hwSfLW3McWehVVp0ZOXUbQ,0,0,4,Tw5CM_IRg9mijpA_TIWRig

But she just kept repeating it. When I asked her why she kept telling me that (because I know I have to come in to pay) she finally said they don't take orders over the phone. I then also asked her about their late night menu and she confirmed they had one. So, fast forward 15 mins and one uber ride later and the same rude girl tells us they don't do late night menu items to go. Then she asks us if we want a table or hibachi. We chose a table. Our waiter comes over and when we ask him about the late night menu, he tells us we have to go to the hibachi tables. WTF?! The rudest hostess in the world then comes over and asks us if we have a reservation. Apparently her goldfish brain didn't recognize us from 2 mins ago nor recalls telling us to go sit at a regular table after we specifically inquired about the late night menu. We explained to her our waiter told us to come sit in the hibachi area and she replies with, ""I didn't tell you to come sit over here. UUUGGHHH."" To which I replied, ""No, you didn't. Our WAITER did because we asked about the late night option"" (for the 10th time).

We order donburi almost all the way around, except we had one Japanese pizza order, which sounded interesting. I received my chirashi probably 20-30 minutes at least if not longer, before anything else came out of the kitchen (my wife sent it back to be chilled since it was out so long). Next came the tempura and some of the other food including some fried rice. The Japanese pizza was nowhere to be seen.

The food was adequate. And I should have known better, but the sushi was not great.  The tempura was no worse then anything I've had before, but the selection of tempura was lame - a mix of broccoli and shrimp with maybe a potato (?) or something. No carrot, no beans, nothing else in the vegetable department. The shrimp tempura, however, was slightly mushy. 

After nearly an hour the Japanese pizza came out and was immediately returned because the dough was not cooked. At all. When queried they said the delay was caused by the time it takes to cook the dough. Clearly that was not the case. It is frustrating to be told the order was put in at the same time as the rest of the orders, yet when you finally receive the dish it clearly hasn't been cooked properly and clearly was rushed to the table. It was replaced with some tempura which was fine.

The worst part, and the part that hurts the review, was after the meal we all felt sick to our stomachs, rendering us useless for almost two hours.

704863,2014-03-12,0,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"Musashi is a Japanese Steak house, with a great location on Paradise Road, just off of the chaotic strip. Open only after 5 p.m. and it is conveniently open until 4 a.m. great for the late night cravings. They have a great and popular Teppenyaki area to the restaurant. If you do not know what Teppenyaki is, it is an area in where you sit around a grill and an entertaining chef grills your food and puts on a show for you.  Musashi also has a sushi bar as well as a dining room area. They have happy hour starting at 11p.m. making their sushi rolls very cheap at about starting at about $4 dollars. Being a usual for several years now, the wait staff as well as the sushi chef are very friendly. I have brought with me a few sushi skeptics that swore not to like sushi but were willing to try anyways and they ended up returning for more.
 
 By far my favorite sushi place I have been to a few different ones but I always come back to Musashi in the end. My three favorite rolls are the Christian roll, Shaggy Dog, and the 911. The Christian is a shrimp tempura roll with eel sauce. I may add that I love their eel sauce I make sure my Christian roll has a lot of it. The Shaggy dog roll is also a shrimp tempura roll topped with crab meat and a delicious creamy sauce. These two rolls also happen to be on the happy hour menu so they are about $5 dollars each. The 911 roll is a spicy tuna roll with topped with salmon I also love to drench this with their delicious eel sauce. Unless you can handle spicy food I would recommend sticking to the Shaggy or the Christian. As an appetizer I enjoy having their tofu and sea weed miso soup. I love how fast my sushi always comes out. I never wait no longer than 5 minutes to get a table. The ambiance is great there are as many locals as well as tourist who enjoy going to get a late snack. I like how even though it is open very late it is a family place, meaning that you can bring your kids with you if you get hungry on your way home from a long day. 

 The few downfalls Musashi might have are that sometimes even though they are a clean place there is a strong sewer smell, which makes it a bit difficult to enjoy your food completely. Another downfall is that the Teppenyaki is always full so you must make reservations hours before you cannot just show up without a reservation. Sometimes even with a reservation you are kept waiting a while because something went wrong and they are running late on getting the others ahead of you out. 
 
 Musashi being my favorite Japanese steak house, I would greatly recommend people to try it. From a great location, great prices, friendly staff and fast sushi service I would think everyone would enjoy it. Whether you are by yourself, on a date, a group of friends or a family, Musashi is the best place for a late dinner or even an after work snack.",0nooZDG3lkJyqNJryi-rYw,0,0,5,zFgUKokGuRFX8chTDIf5bA

I've never been to Vegas and considering I'm not even 21, why go? Well, I was there for a dance competition and the night we got to Vegas me and my family was starving! Oh handy Yelp to the rescue! There was no way we were going to eat at a chain restaurant so I looked up a local place. I picked Musashi and really hoped it was going to be good.

Oh and it was! Their shrimp is to dieeee for. No joke. What is it they cook it with, honey mustard? Whatever it is, it is TASTY. I had Filet Mignon, my brother had NY steak w/ Scallops, mama had the same but with prawns, and pops had it with a salmon fillet. I tried a piece of their food and they were all good. Oh and DO choose the fried rice over steamed! Their fried rice was so yummy.

Conclusion? This place beats Benihana any day. I personally don't even like Benihana and this place just hits the teppanyaki spot. I've been exposed to pretty good Teppanyaki spots back in Guam, and it's good to know that there's one in the mainland that is just as good. Plus the service was great!

My chicken had an awesome sauce on it and it was just all around good.  I can't necessarily put my finger on what exactly it was I like about the whole meal.  

The service was at first prompt.  During and after we were finished eating though it took forever for our waters to be filled and our server disappeared and turned into a hispanic man.  I guess they save the fancy cloth napkins for their evening diners though because we got the cheapo paper napkins.  We didn't get a fancy show because it was just us in the restaurant and because it was the lunch menu.  

All-in-all it was a pleasant experience and I'm willing to go back for dinner some day.",YUNzd4DX-KpCRWyLQ0WmtQ,0,0,4,FA6oSLDXSA2gFYZBZoCDHA

Now it seems like a lot of people have rated it highly based on the teppenyaki side but as far as sushi goes, it was simply the worst sushi either of us has ever had. The mussels in which I've never had a truly bad experience with, were falling apart and mushy. I don't know how to even describe the rolls! They were just weird and and the fish was sooooo NOT fresh! I've read peoples reviews saying how fresh it was and I dunno if they came on a good day or maybe they've just never had good sushi before but this stuff was just terrible! Also on the website it actually talks about their unique and modern interior decoration... HELLO!! There we holes in the seats of the booths and the lighting was a bright florescent light hanging right above your head literally blinding you! The place was just downright dull and dreary. 
Look, I have never left a review for anywhere before because I've never felt the need to and I've had plenty of bad experiences in different restaurants before, but I absolutely LOVE sushi and this place was just horrible in every way.

I like teppan, not only cuz its cool to have someone do the cooking in front of you, but i like my food in little pieces and dipped in the the sauces.  Therefore, i do my best to eat teppan when i find someplace new, and I found mushashi through Yelp on a birthday trip to vegas a couple of weeks ago.

My wife and I made reservations for 5pm because we were going to the 7pm Phantom at Venetian and we wanted to give ourselves plenty of time to eat and drink before we headed to the show.  When we got there, we found the place empty, they had just opened up so we were the first customers there (note: by the time we left there were about 10 others) but they were very nice about only having 2 ppl at a huge teppan table.  We sat down and my wife ordered the rib eye and i got the seafood special w/ calamari, lobster, shrimp, etc.  The food was perfectly cooked and was  much better quality than i've had at other teppan places.

To my surprise it was pretty dead : ( We waited in the somber environment for our seats to be prepared and quickly noticed the celebrity photos with the main chef, Tiger, lining the walls near the bar. It became tangible how strikingly different the atmosphere conveyed in the photos was to what we were presently experiencing. But this would soon change. 

Once seated, others shuffled in and joined our table and our orders were hastily yet politely taken by a waitress of ""a certain age"". Very anomolous data so far. I ordered a tall beer that was like $2 (great value) and the New York Steak dish. My expectations were unclear at this point - or at the very least, not high.

Our chef emerged, he seemed to have the typical ""teppanyaki chef charm"", which was a nice checkbox to tick off. As he cooked and plated our food (and our drinks went down), I was completely thrown off. Nothing seemed extraordinary about his technique or the ingredients but the fried rice was simply amazing! He even included a bonus shrimp to each person that wanted one. My friends ordered the Filet Mignon plate, which was tender but lacked deep flavor. Finally, my New York steak was prepared and it was super tender, juicy and full of flavor. It could have been the beer (on-an-empty-stomach) talking, but my New York steak with the shrimp and the exquisite fried rice were the best I've had in awhile and easily surpassed my expectations for this place.

1338318,2010-07-23,0,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"Today i was in the mood to go eat shabu-shabu. So since I didn't know of any good places here in las vegas, I of course had to do my research. I actually first looked up on citysearch to only discover that there were only very few places in Vegas that  served shabu-shabu. So I read my reviews and compared the ratings. ( I base my judgement on the majority of positive votes and also making sure the reviews stood on genuine and honest answers, since I tend to stray away from overly opinionated reviews where I feel that it almost leans on a more negative and very personal scale ) So i came across Musashi ..and I said ""why not"". 

So read the menu and their specials which goes during certain times of the day and since it was early I would be able to make it to the lunch menu. I was totally convinced and gung-ho about my shabu-shabu all until i finished reading the menu.  which i found pretty impressive because it was very extensive. So I ended up changing my mind and went for the teppanyaki menu instead.
So I arrive there and I am seated to the teppanyaki table, and there was already a party group seated, mind you I am alone and the chef greets everyone and is very friendly. The people actually at the table were pretty friendly too and happened to be local regulars also.
 I order the New york steak well done with shrimp ( $17 ) that includes your soup, fried rice and veggies.. and that offer goes until 3 p.m.  As the chef cooks he was very entertaining and his stories were just as entertaining also, just the way I like it. =)  He kept making and suggesting all these different sauces to go with your meals and I tell you they were so so sooo good.  In the end there were about 7 different sauces to go with my food. My favorite one was the sesame with lemon..it was fantastic! The steak came out tender and just-right, the fried rice was amazing and balanced, the shrimp was wonderful, the veggies weren't overcooked, I enjoyed every bite and morsel, all and in between the variations of sauces. I ate up every single thing on my plate.  What also  made it such a great experience for my first time visit was that there were many laughs shared. The chef and the party made me feel comfortable too. Its always nice to know there are genuine people out there and especially when they are grouped together. I had such a wonderful and great experience with the staff, the customers, and my food.. So of course, with my research, I pat myself on the back cause I've done my homework well and by also completing a very satisfied appetite. I am definitely going back and trying other things on the menu. This time I'm bringing in my husband and our friends.

I'm a bit apprehensive about writing this review because I would much rather be selfish and keep this amazing restaurant to myself but my mother taught me that sharing is caring, so don't say I never did anything for you! ;)

Last weekend was marked my third visit to Musashi. I don't live in Vegas but whenever I visit I try to make reservations here and I do recommend making reservations because this place can be quite hard to get into otherwise since they only have so many seats at the teppan tables. 

You can pretty much order anything off the menu and you will be pleased but my faves are the filet mignon and shrimp. The chefs here are AMAZING and very entertaining as well!!

Musashi is located just off the strip and took us about 8 minutes to get to from Caesar's Palace.

The service from the wait staff was good they seem attentive and they kept our drinks filled. The thing that won me over was our teppanyaki chef! His name was Nick and first he was very entertaining with his little show he does with the utensils ,but his personality was something to behold!

THIS IS THE REVIEW YOU WANT TO READ!! First let me start by saying that this place and Ichiza are my 2 favorite sushi places in town and this review is worth the read if your planning on getting sushi here. I have eaten here countless times for late night sushi over the last year usually 1-2 times a week. They have amazing prices for their late night menu which is active from 11pm till 4am EVERYDAY! I go here for the happy hour plain and simple. I have never tried the teppanyaki side of the place. I have been when the place is busy and over half full and I have been when I was the only group there. In my many visits I have had a few long waits for food and check but they have been few and far between. Just like any other place they can get busy or be understaffed and its easy to forget that they also have to serve the teppanyaki side of the restaurant which can sometimes lead to waiting. The service has always been good and I have never had a rude server for any of my visits. The sushi chef's here are very consistent and it is always enjoyable. Once again like any other place it can have its off days with the sushi as well. I am pleased to report that 95% of the time I greatly enjoy the sushi and the 5% that I did not greatly enjoy the sushi it is still good and well worth the price. As I have said the late night menu is excellent for the price which I will now explain further to give you a grasp of the bill you should expect. The happy hour menu is loosely half off all items listed (this is to say a $7 roll might be $3.50 or it may be $4). If you like sushi as much as I do then you can leave like a overstuffed thanksgiving turkey with a very decent variety or rolls and appetizers for about $20 a person. The late night menu has roughly 30 food items on it with the majority priced under $5 per order. The sushi chef's here are willing to make what you want almost anyway you want it. If a roll you like isn't on the menu ask about it and if they can make it then will! If you want a roll fried just ask and chances are they will fry it for you. Overall the place is great and I love it there. I would recommend it to any friend with the same word I have written here.

My happy hour order consistently contains the following rolls and I suggest them to if you don't know what you want. The Ninja roll is my all time favorite (spicy tuna roll that has been breaded and fried). The regular Spicy Tuna roll is always great. For the fans of not spicy things the Christian roll and Washington rolls are excellent choice! If your looking for something that will have you think ""Refreshing"" order the Alaskan roll.

Thank you for reading my review over and if you try this place out I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",LrqHY2HzP9yAFrbR__vi4w,3,2,4,b8NR4Uo_6PsWt-_DSOF7Vg

1403907,2010-09-15,0,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"I love steak.  I really really love steak.  Up until this point the only restaurants I've reviewed have been steakhouses, I think.  So let me preface my review with this:  I generally don't think of teppan as steak, because something about the meat being cubed and then cooked makes it lose a lot of that wonderful rare flavor that I love.

That said... I've had the best steaks of my life at musashi.  You know it's going to be a wonderful evening when you walk into musashi and see the Kobe beef certificate on display on the front podium -- it means that the Kobe is in and available that day. 

And by Kobe I don't mean that American, or New Zealand or Australian wagyu that a lot of restaurants try to pass off as ""Kobe"".  This is real. Certified. Kobe.

It's so different, delectable, wonderful, like bubbles of delicious flavor bursting in your mouth....and really, I feel like if you like steak, you shouldn't go through life without trying this place out at least once. (at least when Kobe is available)

As far as ambiance goes, it's a beautiful restaurant inside, decorated in a contemporary way with red and black incorporating traditional kimono and uchikake on the walls, it's a place that makes you feel really good to sit down in, yet not overly formal. 

We've been here two times, and the second time we were able to get the owner as our chef, and I have to say -- it was a totally different and awesome experience.  He is by far the best and most entertaining teppan chef I have ever encountered -- couple that with the fact that he cooks custom sauces for your meat on the grill that are gourmet miracles, I highly suggest that you request him as your chef if you ever decide to go.

End note:  The pricing here is really reasonable (I'd say 20-40 a person?), but if you're planning on getting the Kobe, be prepared to spend upwards of 100-150 per person.",49ujkyMRcGtTXcF9hTApHg,1,1,5,-Qt4N2ezKKYHobOynE0XSw

Don't get me wrong, all of the guys are great, but he makes delicious sauces and his personality is fun. Not only do they serve teppanyaki here, they also have sushi and a kitchen menu. 

Pros:
-Half price after 12am (last call is 3:30am)
-Make their own sauces (sweet mayo is the best)
-Friendly staff


Tips:
-Make a reservation if you're going on a weekend or around 7pm...they get really busy! You can even request which chef you would like.

-Try the sweet mayo! It's the sauce they put on the shrimp, but I put it on everything. It's amazing!

-Even if you only kind of like fried rice, get it!!! This is the most delicious fried rice ever. Plus if you put sweet mayo on it, you'll be hooked.

-The dinner show can get dirty (jokes) so be prepared!

We ordered two meals.
A seafood mix and a steak and shrimp.
We happened to be sat with what seemed to be ""regulars"".
The chef started out excited and chatty- entertaining. Made a great show with fire and sauces. We could also hear the table behind us was loud and having fun. 
Sadly, the chef was highly offended because I took my phone out. At that point he stopped making the entertaining efforts and just cooked. This didn't take away from us paying a full priced meal. They still charged us over $100 for our ""experience"". 
I will give a star for the efforts he started with, two for the waiter, and three for the sauces, steak and seafood.
 The steak and seafood seemed of good quality and cooked adequately. Though they weren't necessarily flavorful or nicely seasoned; but therefore the sauces. 
I am a huge rice lover... I found the rice completely tasteless and if I may, burnt and non appealing. 
For all the hype I have heard about this place, I expected a bit more. 
It felt dated, almost a bit dirty (Im no health inspector but check out the hoods), and not welcoming. 
Needless to say, it may be disrespectful to many to use the phone at the table- which I totally understand and can relate. However, In this case, I feel it was inappropriate for the chef to take this incident personally.
He had no idea how important or how
Meaningful it was for me- not only to respond to the incoming texts or the fact that I wanted to treat my children to a great dining experience While in Vegas. 

Good luck to them- we will not be returning.",0JzIDpRUdnc_qgo5MEy5rA,2,1,3,dlBBukVS87YuRR3KlRuhMA

We were seated with a later party (around the Teppan chef's area) so as to make our visit ""more leisurely."" They then preceded to seat (and serve) party after party ahead of us. The three of us waited about an hour before paying our drinks bill and leaving, after repeatedly being told that our chef (and food) were ""almost there.""

Unfortunately, everyone else at our station (maybe an additional half dozen people) was also kept waiting, and I suspect they left soon after. Which is a shame, because the food smelled good. Sadly, they just never served us any.

There are several options of proteins or vegetarian if you're ok with a shared grill (this happens anyway at most places but you're not watching).

The chef prepares so many delectable sauces- nearly 10 to accompany the food as you go. The neat part of this experience is that it was continuous throughout our meal rather than the traditional watch clap eat routine.  There is plenty of food so paying $5 to share is not a bad thing. 

The flavors were amazing robust and mouth watering. I am certain there is a lot of MSG which contributes to the flavor however if you're sensitive to this as is my husband you may be wired and awake for the remainder of the night. 

The bartender is very friendly and was a joy to be around. I'm unsure if it's truth or salesmanship but the bartender kept pushing the priciest selection as the ""better "" option. The only other thing that needs to be mentioned is that cleanliness of the surroundings is not a strong suit when it comes to the floors and washrooms. You can probably read heavily into this and I did not actually look for a sanitation grade but as long as you're not MSG weak, the experience of this place and the flavor of the food are a win and make it an awesome place for a special occasion in large or small groups.",03iMNggjXP2tOkfih15ccA,0,0,4,VSLY4_4-3fvMZrr7Gstv8A

I called to make reservations, just about 30 mins ahead of time with no problem. This was on a Thursday night, so I'm sure on weekends, you probably want to make a bit more of an advance reservation. Once we got there, we were seated immediately and waited a few mins for other reservations to fill our community table. Me and my friends ordered a few appetizers and sushi before our meals. Yaka-tori skewers...tiny portion but delicious! 

We ordered our main entrees, and a few minutes after the Tepenyaki chef came out with a tray full of fresh meats and sauces. The tepen chef spoke broken English, and sometimes was a bit hard to understand but enough for him to make it an enjoyable dinner. He was funny and friendly. He even had the ""barrel-man"" to make us laugh...and for you ol' school Filipinos out there, you know the ""barrel-man"". lol! 

I had the chicken and prawns with fried rice, my other friends had the new york steak, and salmon and prawns. All of it awesome!

Made reservations Sunday afternoon for later that night. Lucky for us, we got owner/Chef Tsutomo! 

For this bachelor party of 7 dudes, I would say the Chef himself was an experience. Sure, you've got your typical teppanyaki chefs who flip spatulas, toss salt shakers, and throw in the occasional cheesy joke. This Chef, however, was highly talented and extremely hilarious. Dirty jokes galore, witty comebacks to our stupid drunken comments, and foul props made this experience a true show! Not to worry, no need to get decked out and dressed up either, very down to earth, casual restaurant.

Food was phenomenal. The Chef took pride in his cooking, insisting we try certain foods without dipping in sauce first to really taste the talent. I got the filet mignon and prawns dinner. Meat was quality, seasoning was perfect with a special mayonnaise like sauce on the prawns. Fried rice was moist, and my favorite part was a special little treat the Chef concocted with the trimmed fat off steaks. I only wished the dish also had chow mein.

Chef made so many house made sauces that I couldn't even figure out what to dip my food in, they were all awesome.

For 7 people, stuffed outta our minds, beer and sake filled, and cheeks (on the face, to clarify) hurting from laughing... Our bill was $500 including gratuity.

I also tried a handroll which had uni, unagi, cream cheese, & masago inside. That was different, but I think the cream cheese takes away the taste from the uni. The beef takaki they used thick slices of beef & I thought it was a little overdone. I'm used to thin peices of raw beef.

Yes, unfortunately two of my party were 15 minutes late, but the host was incredibly pushy and rude, not sure if it's a culture barrier or not. 

Walking in, it seems quite dirtier than usual, my boyfriend even complained about the place.. That's saying a lot! 

We order the sushi mediocre, the apps are sub par. Our chef comes to the table and doesn't engage the table one bit. Even trying to get everyones attention to watch this dude cook and he just wasn't even going to attempt to try and have fun with us.

1872761,2014-10-06,9,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"Musashi came highly recommended, after two visits, I can only say this place deserves NO stars.

First visit. We asked for the ""adult"" show for a visiting friend.  Got two bowls of rice turned upside down with some round veggie on top and they called it boobs... great... I paid 20% more over Benihana for rice boobs?  The food was okay, so I'll give it another shot.

Second and final visit.

- 6 weeks out:  Made reservations for adult show for 7 at 10pm.

- 3 weeks out:  Called to confirm reservation for adult show for 7 at 10pm. Confirmed.

- Reservation:  Showed up 15 minutes before and checked in with the hostess, confirmed that we had reservation for 7 and for adult show.  She tells us to tell the server you want adult show.  She then proceeds to sit a party of 3 at our table... they had a 9 year old with them.  While most 9 year old nowadays have probably seen more internet porn than most adults my age, I did the adult thing and let the hostess know that she just sat a kid at the adult show table.  Apparently, according to the hostess, a 9 year old seeing a 2 foot long big black dildo with simulated jiz is, to her, perfectly fine.  I continued to ask for an kid free adult show.  After asking for the manager, I was told that she was not at the restaurant.  After further pressing, we asked to speak with the owner Tsutomu (AKA Tiger)... we explained our situation, about making reservations and blah blah blah... he couldn't give two shits.  Taking the high road, we decided to leave and not scar the poor kid.

This is what I get from wanting to see a big black dildo at a Japanese restaurant.

1908515,2009-11-05,4,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"I was told by a close family friend that I needed to give this place a try, he told me that they do teppanyaki style cooking and one of the things that he kept raving to me about were the sauces, which they make in front of you, that went really well with the different dishes.  He was raving about the food quality, the freshness of the ingredients and how it was a whole caliber above other teppanyaki chains.  Walking in we saw the swanky and posh interior, and I felt we could look forward to an awesome meal.  Unfortunately, me and my g/f this was as good as it was going to get, and left here very disappointed, which was unfortunate considering my family friend really hyped us up and considering we saw all the positive yelp reviews.  I will say we did go do go during lunch and maybe as a result you don't get the full experience that the dinner crowd gets, but I with all honesty I am basing most rating on the quality of the food we received.

We walked in and got seated fairly quickly, as there was a group of other walk-ins sitting and waiting.  I talked to the others sitting there, and found out one couple was sitting there for about 10 minutes and the other group of three people had been there for almost 30 minutes and still hadn't taken their order.  So needless to say, the other groups seemed slightly irritated because of the wait, but I guess I can see how it isn't exactly cost effective to do teppanyaki cooking for just two or three people.  But still sitting that long can be a little irritating.

The soup was a little on the salty side for my tastes, the soy sauce kinda covered up the overall flavors of the dish.  The lunch combination also came with some fried rice which was hot, and did have some crispy rice pieces, which was a nice thing, but I felt that the flavoring was a bit on the bland side.  The sauces that my friend told us about weren't being made in front of us, they were coming out of a squeeze bottle, one being miso based and the other tasted a little soy-citrus base... both were good, but didn't find it much different from the same sauces you get at Benihana.  The chef we got that day didn't seem that into it, he was there and cooking it, but didn't say very much or do much interacting with the guests at the table.  The only reason I bring this up, is that teppanyaki is supposed to be a show, part of the reason you usually pay for this is to be entertained while you eat.

The chef continued on and started to make or meals, I had tried some of the vegetable stir fry that my g/f ordered, probably the best thing I had during this meal, the veggies were well cooked, not over done and rubbery, nice light char on it and pretty well seasoned.  If I knew what was to follow I would have stopped eating here.  Next came the Steak and Prawns - While I went and asked for medium rare, he served it well down, the steak was a brick and the prawns were overcooked and rubbery.  My g/f and I shared a side a scallops which were once again, over cooked.  No moisture left in the disk shape brick we were given, it was inedible, we didn't bother finishing the dish.

I was really disappointed in the meal, I really had high expectations for place based on the reviews and recommendation that I got.  I really wanted to like this place because I wanted to come back and do a late night food run and try their Okonomiyaki.  But after have such a bad lunch experience I don't think any amount of booze and drunk munchies could get me to come back on this trip.  Ill give them a try down the road for dinner, maybe it will be better experience...  But in the mean time I gotta go call my friend and give him a hard time about that recommendation.",8DqQqPnWLMllH2Dd0bETtQ,6,3,2,WYMjDh1T4jB5y0iHywGRaw

then we tried a deep fried assorted stuffed with assorted fish sushi that came in 2, 6.. etc. it was decent.  a lot going on.   I don't remember the name but the sushi is shaped as a fish. :) I thought that was interesting.

2046380,2013-04-16,0,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"My husband and I were recently in Las Vegas on vacation.  We've been to Vegas about a dozen times, and we wanted our last dinner in Vegas to be Tepanyaki.  There are certainly a lot of options for this in Vegas, but we decided to trust our fellow Yelpers and check this place out.  

When we first arrived just before 6 on a Sunday our host asked if we had reservations.  We were a bit surprised since there was only one other party in the restaurant.  We were seated right away, and the other family at the table spoke so highly of the food we were about to eat that we really began to be excited.  

The food was absolutely incredible.  I'm not sure if this is true everywhere, but certainly where we are from in NH you find that a lot of the flavor and seasoning is from soy sauce when you have Tepanyaki.  Unfortunately a lot of Tepanyaki in NH tastes the same.  But man was I impressed by this place!  I've never seen food seasoned and flavored the way it was here.  Flavors were layered and built in such a way that each thing I tasted was better than the last thing.  I had the Shrimp and Scallops and my husband had the Steak and Chicken.  Everything was fresh and the flavors were so balanced.  Often times I get sauces on the side for Tepanayki and I need those to provide depth of flavors.  This is the first time that I've had Tepanyaki that I didn't need those side carts of sauces.  I was so full when I left, but I didn't feel gross because of an abundance of grease.  

Perhaps the only feedback we could pass along to the owners are with respect to the bathrooms.  I did not use their facilities but my husband did.  While it was clear they do a nightly cleaning, some things just need a little bit of sprucing.  For example, there was a wall-mounted air freshener that clearly hadn't been replaced in a few weeks or month.  But that's such a minor detail in the grand scheme of our evening that I almost hate to bring that up.  It certainly didn't detract from the experience that we had though as you can see based on how highly I rated it.

When we walked in there was no hostess, we walked up to the bartender and asked if we had to seat ourselves, he ended up calling a waiter over. My friend asked if we could do the teppanyaki, we were told we could but not until 9:30 p.m. because we didn't have reservations. We didn't know it was mandatory to make one. We had a show to go to so we sat down to dine in the main dining area instead. I ended up ordering the following items: 

Pork Gyoza- $4.50
Shrimp Dragoons- $6.00
NY Steak (Hot Iron)- $18.00

The NY steak entree included miso soup, salad, fried vegetables (they no longer offer mashed potatoes), and steamed white rice. When ordering the steak it could either be served teriyaki style or just plain salt and pepper with a side of oroshi ponzu sauce. I opted to go with the salt and pepper. I ordered my steak well done and it was still very juicy and tender, I didn't end up touching the vegetables because they consisted of onions, zucchini (my arch nemesis), and carrots.The miso soup came with mushrooms, scallions, and little pieces of meat, it had a little kick, it was very flavorful. The salad was just iceberg lettuce topped with ginger dressing which was really good, it was sweet but not overpowering. The shrimp dragoons were a-okay, they're just like crab rangoons except they have shrimp instead of crab. I'll most likely skip ordering them next time. I ordered the pork gyoza steamed, but you can also order it fried, it was good, the pork had a nice salty taste. I really wanted to try the cream balls but they are no longer part of the menu. Our waiter said they were changing a lot of the things on the menu because I noticed some parts of the menu were blacked out. 

Our waiter was very attentive throughout the whole meal, we never even had to ask him for any refills because as soon as we were done with 3/4 of our drink, he'd bring more out. I was really happy with our service and meal.

Pro-
Yum yum sauce-extra points (this sauce is not normally found on the west coast)
portion size- excellent
taste - excellent- (order the chicken, shrimp, rice, and vegetables)
Open late at night- that's a plus

Cons-
-Ordered garlic sauce but I swear it was ginger (i have been to lots of  Japanese hibachi places to know the different sauces- it's OK)
-Soup- I normal like the soup but I really didn't care for this one. Due to it having some weird looking meat in it.

2131412,2017-06-21,1,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"We decided to visit here after reading so much about how great it was on Yelp! and although it was off the beaten path we hunted it down on our second or third night in Vegas.  My wife has recently really gotten into Japanese food and we have eaten quite a bit of it so we figured we may as well try one of the best Japanese places in Vegas.  Because of the low prices and unique ability to eat Japanese at 2am we decided to do some gambling and then go for a very late night Japanese and arrived at the place right before the 2am special began.  It was a bit of a dive place for sure but it didn't really feel unsafe or anything.

When we went in the place definitely did strike me as sort of a dive place and it was semi-busy at 2am (but then isn't just about everything busy in Vegas at crazy hours?)  We were greeted promptly and seated within about 15 minutes.  I must say I did notice a bit of an old, musty smell combined with propane and it was not really a great smell.  Nothing too terrible but it was annoyance to me the entire time we were there.  

Of course we were seated with another family who was there with all of their children (I guess even children don't sleep in the city of Sin!) and after a while of waiting got our chef.  A very American looking chef, not at all Asian and although he was nice, he did seem like he was on the long end of a shift or perhaps working the red eye just wasn't his thing but he seemed to struggle to be interested.  My wife got the shrimp with Soba noodles and I got the chicken hibachi.  Both were pretty good and the portions were large enough.

All in all this place seemed to be a bit overrated for what it is.  It wasn't terrible or anything (although the smell really was a bit of a turn-off for me) but it seems like perhaps the place was once a really amazing place and has slipped a bit.  Or maybe we just came on an off night.  

This place may be worth checking out simply for the historical value and a lot of celebrities have eaten here but for the money you are paying I would think one could find better Japanese steakhouses in Vegas.",MqvuybIfFPZpKbwLcaeutg,0,0,2,SL0fppFEcqkUqZlNT6BW3g

I've only had experience with the tepenyaki part of this restaurant, but it's good enough to keep me going back to this place at least once a week. 

The service is always great, as is the atmosphere. All the tepenyaki chefs are welcoming and have a great energy, making your meal more enjoyable. Young is the best, in my opinion, so if you can get him, you're golden. 

The place is always packed when I go which is a double edged sword. On one hand, it shows that they are a great restaurant with a lot of loyal customers. on the other hand - sometimes it's too busy for me to get seated right away. 

Tepenyaki - for those who don't know - is where they seat you around a grill, and the chef cooks your food right in front of you. At Musashi - with your tepenyaki meal, you get fried rice, vegetables, your meat choice, as well as soup. Each chef also makes their own unique sauces to accompany the meal. It's a great value, and the best place to get tepenyaki in Vegas. 

I almost didn't want to write a review on this place, because I want to keep it all to myself. But, alas, one can't be greedy when it comes to sharing great places to eat. Eat here, and you won't regret it.

The drinks were only free because we walked out after being treated rudely.

We made reservations for 8pm and were there 10 minutes early.  We were told that the table was not ready and we would need to wait a few minutes in the lounge.  We ordered a few drinks and continued to wait as the lounge filled up with others waiting.  We finished our drinks and were ready for more but realized it was already past 830 and we had plans later.

I approached the podium and calmly said we had 800 reservations it is now 830 and we were told it would only be a few minutes at 750.  I asked when we would be seated.  The guy at the podium was haughty and replied with ""whenever it is ready.""  Some others that were waiting had overheard our exchange and began talking saying they had been waiting since 730.  I headed to my party of 6 and told them that we would be leaving right now.  As we pasted by the podium another party had approached the podium.  I announced to all listening that we were not waiting and leaving.

We headed across the street to Del Frisco's, one of the best steakhouses in Vegas.  They were friendly and sat us right away.  The service was a stark juxtaposition to those across the street.

i ordered the ribeye and the BD ordered the NY strip.  Performance wise - it was nothing I haven't seen before.  The beef broth soup was tasty, the salad was forgettable, the shrimp was doused with a mayo based sauce that I really enjoyed but BD hates mayo, the quail egg and bacon appetizer was also on the meh side.  

My ribeye was super tasty.  He put it on a bed of sliced garlic and let that bad boy sear.  Before he served it to me he sprinkled it with lime juice.  It was yummy.  My fried rice was bland until I added 4 other sauces to it and the veggies were great.  The BD enjoyed his steak but didn't really eat much else (he doesn't do veggies or seafood - so more for me!)

Take out

Ordered two filets
One salt and peppered one teriyaki
Neither were filet mignon*
But for strip steaks, pretty freakin good

If youre thinking of ordering
Ask for the teriyaki 
Cause the deep fried vegetables have no flavor
Half the point of deep frying
Is the opportunity to attach well seasoned flour
Was actually the first deep fried anything
That had an absence of flavor

However at least they can claim a clean fryer

PS: best meat broth soup**

* only reason for four out of five stars
** recommendation, serve this soup cold


WINNER WINNER NO CHICKEN FOR DINNER


Order in

Greeted warmly by Cindy
A very friendly and attentive server

House salads with a sweet and clean dressing 

True Love roll..avocado painted over a rice bed
A simple dish as well as a refreshing meat alternative

Godfather roll..delicious balance of tangy spices
Avocado/crab roll topped w/deep fried lobster
Balanced with a smooth line of eel sauce
An original sushi roll and a winner

Crazy hair scallop..basically two scallops
Hiding under a funnel cake
Not for me, but then when are deep fried carbs

Kobe beef..winner, simple salt and pepper


PS: recommendation..
Have a salad and nine ounces of kobe beef
A glass of red wine 
Tip kindly and head home for a nap

This spot stay open til like 4 AM. I never wanna eat before around 12 in Vegas, and after midnight, Musashi offers a discounted Teppan menu...You can still get the regular stuff too, but for almost half price, you get just a wee bit less food(still enough for me, and I have an appetite!)

Tiger is awesome...I think he's the owner. He's cooked for me a few times and we usually rap about the culinary industry since I work in it as well. But be warned...any pretty girls at the table and things CAN get raunchy. Part of why I love this place...They REALLY have fun...

Then, there's Tigers brother in law...Talked to me about eating Dog for a good 15 minutes...haha....Couldn't tell if he was pulling my leg or not, but I'm gonna go with yes, he was messing with me. Haha

And this one other dude is actually my favorite. He remembers which SEAT I sat in months prior, and remembers every time. I wish I knew his name, he's a cool guy. Maybe Jason? I dunno...I feel bad! You're my dude, dude!

A couple quick things...The 'Miso' soup is actually a peppered beef soup, and it's freaking delicious. My GF doesn't eat beef, but she eats this soup knowing it IS beef, because it;s THAT good. And another thing...the Fried Rice... OMG... Seriously, you guys have ruined me for all other fried rice. It's simply amazing. The best fried rice anywhere...And I usually HATE rice!

Yeah, this is my kinda spot...They don't take themselves too seriously but take their food serious as sh!t. Plus, being a late night spot, it's ideal for poker players to grab a bite after a late night at the tables. Seriously, this place rocks. I hate getting off the tables and being reduced to fast food or some Casino 24 hour Cafe. Even if I'm having a bad poker night, I can always look forward to some good Teppan at Musashi.

Thanks Tiger! I'll be out there in April sometime.",8r6iLHioaMxVc2-MXQ89RQ,2,2,4,Hn4aMUfHb401-_3yqSSksQ

First off, the food was amazing.  Meats were all tender (filet mignon melted in my mouth, but the NY steaks were pretty good too), very well seasoned, and the multitudes of sauce were all delicious. A little disappointed with their 'hot' sauce. It was good and probably my second favorite after the garlic one, but it couldn't pass for mild at an Asian restaurant. I ordered the plain ole steamed rice instead of friend rice like everyone else because most teppan places just give you some butter+soy sauce rice with some veggies tossed in. I think the chef forgot and just made all the rice into fried rice, so he just gave me and my friend some, and I was pleasantly surprised.

We didn't get the main chef, so our show wasn't as impressive.  He tried some tricks, but he occasionally slipped up. He generally made up for with the conversation we had, until he got going with the regular at the table and the conversation steered toward strip clubs and pot.

2409990,2011-05-12,1,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"OK. So here is a little history about the place. Musashi was awarded best Japanese restaurant in 2007 by city search and is Open Table's 2009 winner for Best Kid-Friendly Restaurant awards. But better for adults  then kids i think. We found out about the place while watching the food network channel. food network channel say whaaat!?? That's right.

So with that being said and it being my first time attending the place I'd have to say is by far one of the best teppanyaki places i have been to. Compared to the famous benihana's this place is say is 100x times better. Our chef was not only skilled at cooking but was really funny and entertaining as well. The Fillet minion was very delicious. The Steaks are fresh and tender. Great variety of dipping sauces. Best sauces i ever tasted in any Japanese restaurant. The steaks are served by itself or as a surf and turf with lobster or shrimp. I recommend you bringing someone here for a birthday. Only because your birthday guests will get a lovely birthday surprise with their meal. 

The Place opens till 4am. Its one of those places that is closed for a couple hours between lunch and dinner between 3pm-5pm I believe. So anytime before or after you will be able to get in. Reservations aren't necessary. A very popular spot w/ celebrities. Again highly recommended. A great place for entertainment. Enjoy!",9Zze7c6t_PhVUSTzx7Eb-A,4,1,4,CJlEam7Xu30P_VrkT5Rh7Q

You really can't beat their happy hour prices... but you get what you pay for.  It was hard to be a healthy pescetarian here. Lots of fried, lots of soaked in oil-y sauces, all of the specialty drinks have a ton of sugar.

The waiter even said that when he eats there, that he always double checks that the fish is fresh. So... sometimes it's not? Eeek.

On our first night in Vegas, my husband's friend took us here for dinner. Apparently, this restaurant was featured on the Travel Channel, and is the usual go-to place for performers, poker players, etc. during late hours. The decor is very simple and clean. It's a pretty small place. But here, I guess the food speaks for itself. The chef is very personable and friendly. He has a great sense of humor and mad skills on the grill! The food is cooked on a large tepan grill right in front of you. (Think Benihana.)  My husband and I shared an ahi poki salad and the Teppanyaki Musashi Special which included filet mignon, lobster tail, prawns, and scallops with two sides of fried rice. The filet mignon was grilled perfectly to a medium-rare...very juicy. The lobster tail and prawns were succulent. And I'm usually not a fan of scallops but they were fantastic! Very flavorful and tender. I also really love how the chef chops everything into bite-size pieces before putting it on your plate. He also had so many different secret sauces to compliment each type of food. My absolute favorite was a sweet and tangy pineapple mayo-based sauce that I ate with everything. The food was sooo flavorful and delicious. It also had a slightly charred flavor due to the grill which I really like. I was salivating from beginning until end. (I'm salivating while I'm writing this review.) Mind you, the fried rice...which I didn't expect to be anything special...was phenomenal!! I would come here after a long drunken night just for a bowl of the hearty, buttery fried rice. I've been craving for it ever since.

I know that a lot of people never leave the strip when they visit Vegas, but it's totally worth it if you enjoy great Japanese food and live entertainment while dining. I can't wait to come back!",Rolx4E510YoPgQX9LSvx6g,0,0,5,gL5E4fa80UhDJH2LyZuj4Q

A few Samurai Specials:
I. New York Steak and Prawns - no leftovers - nuff said
II. New York Steak and Scallop - I'm not sure if the food even touched the plate
A few Hosokawa Clan Specials:
I. Filet and Prawns - he made bunnies out of the shrimp - too cute.  the food was amazing
II. Filet and Scallops - my selection and I have NO regrets.  YUMMY!!!
Masumi Special: Filet Mignon, Lobster Tail, Fried Rice, & Ice Cream - again....DELICIOUS

WHAT: My friend and I randomly decided to redeem ourselves and try out Musashi when they were actually open, so we headed here at 6pm!

The staff were all so sweet! From our server to our Chef (we had Chef Octavio) - phenomenal! =D

We were first asked the occasion of us being there, we replied ""For Fun."" I did not think my ""for fun"" answer would lead to such surprising consequence, but it really was FUN! I don't want to ruin it for you first-timers, so just get on in there and have fun! Lol. THERE IS DEFINITELY A SURPRISE WAITING FOR YOU... MUAHAHA!

2672584,2008-01-01,2,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"this is a lengthy review for 2 reasons: 1. this was my first time here. 2. NO ONE HAS REVIEWED THIS PLACE ON YELP YET!!

i LOVED my experience here. my boyfriend and i JUST got back from our 4 day trip to vegas, and the first thing i wanted to do was share w/ all the yelpers how AMAZING this place is.  

it's off the strip, in the same plaza as Firefly, so i'm sure many of you are familiar w/ the location.

SERVICE:i made a reservation for 15 people at 10pm on a saturday night, this past new years weekend.  it was not crowded at all.  we were seated right away. the prices on the menu looked a bit steep depending on what you order (about $20-60 for teppanyaki), but let me tell you, these people really know thier shit when it comes to seasoning, adding flavor, and cooking meat.  we really had a very memorable dinner here, thanks to TIGER and YOUNG (and no they are not strippers. they were our teppanyaki chefs).  TIger was obviously the veteran of the two, making vulgar jokes, and toying with us diners.  I'm guessing Young was new, but oh so very cute.  If you do end up eating teppanyaki, ask the chefs if you can wear their hat, (they'll say no, but believe me. they'll make you wear their ""special"" apron instead. trust. i fell for it).  overall, the staff was very attentive and friendly to us.  

DRINKS: i had the lychee saketini and the lotus blossom. both very good, light, delivered fast, and also left me a little tipsy but not too drunk or belligerent to get bloated from dinner.  

FOOD: keep in mind all teppanyaki dinners include salad, soup, rice, veggies, and a shrimp appetizer.  i ordered the Seabass (about $23) and my boyfriend had the geisha special (steak and chicken, about $25).  our proteins were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and they also made the most delicious sauces to go w/ everything, including this delightful garlic thing that i drenched my fried rice in, even though the rice already didn't need much.  

we also ordered 2 sushi rolls. we had 'da bomb' (jalapeno, cream cheese and spicy tuna) which was really good if you like SPICINESS and the 'j in your mouth' roll (pretty much a tempura battered philly roll) which was also VERY VERY DELICIOUS.  

AMBIANCE: i liked it. simple, not overpretentious. you could come in jeans or decked out in your sequined hootchiemama dresses.  

KEEP IN MIND: 
all that matters is that you don't need  to be a high roller here to get excellent service. they made my entire group feel like big ballers for one night.  we were also celebrating 2 birthdays, and my friends each got their own tempura ice cream.  the one thing i will do though, is make reservations for a later time. check the hours on the website.  i do know that they have a daily happy hour from 11pm-4am in which the prices for a lot of the menu items drops down very generously.  seriously, take advantage of this place. it really will bring you good times w/ good people.  and remember, always chat it up w/ your chefs.  they will defintely make sure that your money does not go to waste.",bI93RM0c14qXTcKyeGAJpw,3,3,5,bw_07Tqy_ONKF-tVI603Gw

A group of 5 of us came after work one night at the request of one of the people in the group. We were seated about a half hour after waiting for a table. After looking over the menu I decided to with with the Samurai Special, filet mignon and shrimp, our waiter informed me that it wold be an extra $3.50 for fried rice, which I thought was bizarre, that usually comes with dinner automatically.

We were started out with miso soup. I immediately noticed there was a ton of oil in it. I could see it floating on the top, as well as some mystery meat. The salad was ok, iceberg lettuce only, but I did like the ginger dressing. 

Onto our meal. Started out with grilled vegetables, he put a large chunk of butter down into them. Same with the shrimp. Same with the meat. I was in disbelief in regards to the amount of butter that was used. Garlic. He loved garlic as well. He thought it was so special to make garlic butter. It was overkill.

So our food comes, I can guarantee you that what I was served was not filet mignon. During dinner, one of the people in our group had requested more yum yum sauce. The ""chef"" reaches for the bottle of yum yum sauce and holds it in front of his junk as in gesturing something. He thought this was hilarious, the rest of us thought it was gross and innapropriate. I get that they have an adult dinner later, but we weren't apart of that. It was gross.

 I HATE TO WRITE BAD REVIEWS....but....

 Rolls were loose and small.  Fish was ok tasting (more like all you can eat sushi).  When you eat sushi as much as I do, it is easy to tell the difference between meh, and ahhhhh.  The rolls are small, these are done on 1/2 sheets of nori not full sheets so they are very thin.  The price is ok, but you get what you pay for.  If you want cheap sushi  go to all you can eat.  Rolls, and nigiri are very loose.  Tempura rolls are UGLY and expensive...  Change your frying oil, and roll that roll in flour before you fry it.  Again very small roll for $15.00...

2887657,2014-12-17,5,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"I can tell you this one first thing about Musashi.  The absolute best roll of sushi I remember having in all my years of sushi nom'dom was served to me from Musashi.  I believe it to be a dragon roll type variation at the time and it was prepared by a latin chef.  It may have just been right time right place right company, but my girl also still remembers just how much that one stood out.  It was a second first date of sorts, soo..

Aside from that roll.  The teppanyaki chefs are the most comical and animated here.  This being a spot that my single years most frequented I can vouch that the chefs are truly charismatic and their chef skills are a cut above.  Top notch teppanyaki.  The squid cake is tender.  The rib-eye is to die for.  *Make sure you tell the chef that you like the fat!!!* they will double grill the fat in a special sweet crunchy way and your tongue will remember it more than your first real kiss.  

The teppan menus range from traditional price ranges and make sure to dish out for the Musashi special or the Tsutomu if you are pesceterian like me.  Since it is a shared table, when the chef is done with everyone elses meats then he continues to pull out additional entree's for your upper tier special you will immediately see the faces of envy upon your fellow diners!  Mwahaha!

Make sure to drop a few Sake bombs down your Hiroshima to make the mood perfect.  Traditional kimono adorned waitresses will attend to your buzz for the night and I can't stress how much fun you can have at Musashi may usually equate to a taxi cab or recommended designated driver.  The night is young, or it may not be.  They do open quite late to satisfy Vegas' party people which is also another plus.

I will have to admit that I haven't seen that young latin phantom chef since.  The one that cut and rolled the most prodigious piece of delectable sushi I have or may possibly ever have had in my young adult life.  However I may keep coming back to Musashi my entire lifetime.  Enjoying all the other good things that they offer, and give a glance back to the sushi counter in hopes to demystify the fabled sushi shogun.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,6,8,4,3HJKaGFQX1jYDhDJ6oMbqg

When i arrived the waiter tried to give me a seat at the sushi bar, which i did not want to sit at.  So I asked for a table and i was given a look of disgust.  (First Stike)...  The server then dropped 3 menus on the table with a thunderous thump.  (Strike 2)...  A different server then came and asked if he could get something to drink in which i replied yes i got some water since it was really hot that day.  then it took me almost 20 minutes just to look over the menu.  I was in the mood for some sashimi combo but was not offered for dinner, so I ordered steamed gyoza and fried agedashi tofu for my app.  and a unagi bowl for my main course.  i waited about 20 minutes and the waiter brings me my unagi bowl which i ordered for my main course.  I asked the waiter that should I not get my apps before I get my main course.  He then replied that its being cooked now, but the unagi bowl comes from the sushi bar.  I politely told him that it shouldn't matter where it comes from I would like to get my food accordingly.  The waiter then asked me if he should take the unagi bowl back and bring it back after I am done with the apps.  I said yes please.  
After another 15 minutes passed and I finally get my steamed gyoza potstickers which was a dissapointment where i can tell it was a store bought frozen potsticker and it wasnt even cooked right.  It was mush and i just had 1 bite of that and that was enough for me.  then came the fried tofu which was salty and it was as if no one took any care in preparing that dish.  In total it took 35 minutes to cook frozen potstickers out of a bag and to deep fry some tofu. ( unacceptable)...  The waiter then brings back a cold unagi bowl which was just left out waiting for me to finish my apps...  to top it off the rice was sushi rice.  I never had a bowl with sushi rice before  and that was the last straw...  I put my chopsticks down and asked for the check.  The waiter just said thank you and gave me my check.  He did not one time ask me why I haven't touched any of my food except for 1 bite each dish.  I gave the waiter my money and ask to speak to the manager or owner.  Like I said being a restaurant owner and a chef my self I wanted to have a civilized conversation regarding this matter and to see what kind of operation they are running.  The Server escorted me to the owner who was working as the cashier as well.  I told her straight out that her food was terrible.  She just Said ""Oh! That's Ok I will take care of your bill"" and gave me my money back.  I started to express to her what was wrong with everything and she would have non of that.  she just kept saying "" It's ok , It's ok""...  It just showed me that maybe in the beginning of the restaurant she and her husband started with a bang.  But now they run the restaurant without any care what so ever.  My opinion is if they don't want to be in business then they should quit and stop lying to everyone about their food and service.  If the owners dont care then the server and the cooks don't care either and it shows.

Also, I saw this place on the Travel Channel and thought it would be a good idea to give it a try.

Our chef was the owner, (the one they showed on the Travel Channel episode) who I have to say was very entertaining with his wit and tricks, BUT the food was not that great. 

The main issue I had was that the majority of the food was over cooked. The shrimp that he made look like little bunnies, sat on the grill for way too long and actually started to darken and toughen up.

The fried rice had hard pieces in it because it sat on the grill too long as well. 
We both ordered the filet for our entrees and it was overcooked from how we requested it.

I was pleased that he offered a variety of sauces but that didn't take away from the over cooking of the main dishes.

Aside from the chef being more entertaining, I would have been happy to have gone to a Benihana instead. I don't know if this was a fluke or not and I may give this place another chance but based on my one experience, I would be hard pressed to not go somewhere else.",los0tmpSW5seBsBE1orrdg,1,0,3,ANNbzUm3R-PZRJSud-6WBw

After much deliberation, we came here around 10pm for a late dinner. The place was empty, but they assured us they were still open. More people started coming in after us, so I guess we just bring the party with us.

Their selection is outstanding, with many items you rarely find at your standard Japanese restaurant. Lots of X-rated rolls such as Sex on the Beach, WTF, and J in My Mouth. It can take a while to decide, so if you're with a group, just get a bunch of items and do it family style. 

If you're never had Okonomiyaki, this would be an optimal place to try it. I was a Japanese pizza virgin before this, and I am very glad to have popped my cherry. Okonomiyaki is a savory pancake served with noodles, veggies, sweet sauce, seaweed, various spices and your choice of meat. It's an intense myriad of flavors that balance each other out. A mildly sweet and savory combo on a heavy, but fluffy and delicious batter. It's plenty for one person and goes great with a bottle of beer.

Speaking of beer, Sapporo is $8. That's as much as my meal. Big letdown.

Service was slow, despite us initially being the only ones in the restaurant. We were told okonomiyaki would take 15-20 min, but it took at least 35. We weren't in a hurry but no one enjoys waiting.

He kept our large group of 11 entertained the entire meal, with his dirty jokes and various gag toys.  Lots of fun and good food, which puts this place at the top of my teppanyaki list.

First off, he creates about 7 different sauces for everyone (half of them made on the teppan grill).  The tricks start right from the beginning, with veggies and fried rice cooked before your main entree.  I ordered the Steak Lovers special, which included 3 cuts of beef, which included some kobe imported from Japan.  This included some special fried rice, which was made with some kobe beef fat.  The fried rice was solid and I was glad it was seasoned very well and not overly soy saucey.  It was hilarious when he started to pack a penis cake mold with fried rice and... haha just check my photo and you'll see.  I almost forgot the house soup that came out to start, which was this peppery short rib broth soup, which was delicious.  I also tried some of the rolls my friends ordered and they were pretty good.

The place is about a mile off the strip and the cab cost was around $8 from the Venetian.  It's a short trip from the strip and you could easily walk there if the weathers nice.  Also, be sure to make reservations and request Tsutomu when doing so.",Wwd1itJKifCiPPpZeF8sBA,3,1,5,m0LUck76E-yNHJqsm-T4vg

2989832,2010-08-21,3,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"Yup..5 stars, my one and only five stars, for now. We visited this place many moons ago and I am now just getting around to writing a review so here it is the best I remember it. 

Me and my wife saw this place featured on the travel channel. We were in town for our buddys 40th bday party. We lugged everyone a short drive off the strip into a crowded strip mall deal. We walk into to a relatively empty Musashi. This place to my remembrance only has 2 hibachi tables and some a considerable amount of regular tables. If making reservations one must declare that one wants a hibachi presentation. 

Due to one of the chefs calling in, there was a considerable wait to get our chef. This actually turned out to be a good thing because little did we know we would be getting the owner and the chef featured on the travel channel. We were nice and toasty by the time he got there off sapporo's and sake. The chef/owner introduces himself and immediately begins with jokes and most of the jokes were not of child nature. He picked one person from our group and playfully made fun of her the whole time like a comedian would to our amusement. The display this guy put on was phenomenal and this is coming from a Hibachi Veteran Pro. None of the tricks he displayed had I seen before. He had a cast iron rice former made out of the design of genetials, something you would have to see to believe.

I ordered the Kobe beef, I had never had it before. Needless to say it was ""market price"" and not cheap by any means but I didn't care. The mushroom soup was standard and good. The rice was the BEST I ever had. The SAUCE was absolutely amazing and blows away every sauce I have ever had.  When I got the kobe beef I let everyone at the table have a piece. Kobe beef is very fatty, very tasty and delectable as all HELL.

Overall one of the best places I have eaten in my life thus earining my first 5 star rating and I am no stranger to nice restaraunts.

If you find yourself in vegas and in the mood for this type of food do yourself a favor and skip the Hiltons Beni hana and take a cab ride over to Musashi..son, you will not be dissapoint.",RVMjaJ_1uh3lkyZfkDRZJg,5,3,5,yRMm1id-goyAfZrTzivtwQ

We came in around 5ish on a weekday, and we were seated at the sushi bar immediately.  I was impressed with their menu since they carry some different rolls.  Although the prices are fairly high, I enjoyed all the sushi we ate.

There was a baked tempura lobster roll that I ate four orders of, which tipped our bill to about $80 bucks alone.  Everything was great from the negi to the special rolls.  The fish tastes fresh and they do not skimp on how much they give you.

I'm all down for this place again.  As long as I have a full wallet, I'll go all out next time at the sushi bar.  Try  it out sometime.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,0,0,4,7W-AJzvnJwLg9ZLhhu9IeQ

After figuring out how to get inside, we were immediately greeted by a foul smell that was similar to sweaty socks. Not something you want too smell at a restaurant. Normally we would have left, but we had 9pm reservations and everyone seemed to be raving about the food.

We were seated at a teppanyaki style table alone. After a few minutes another party of 2 joined, followed by an additional party of 5. All guys.

We got our drinks, gave in our order and waited. and waited. and waited. Finally at about 9:35 our salads arrived. Now, I'm from NYC and every hibachi place I've been too, we've never been longer then an hour. Here, we were already 35 minutes in with just our salads and no chef in sight. The salad was bland and wasn't very appetizing. The soup arrived a few minutes later which was actually really good. Definitely one of the only good things about this meal.

Finally at 9:50, just as we were about to complain, our chef arrived. He noticed I was the only girl at the table and proceeded to make a heart out of oil and say ""Thats for you!"". I thought it was a kind gesture until I turned around and heard him say ""This is also for you!"" To my surprise, he was holding a wooden penis. Yes you just read that right. A wooden penis. Wtf. I think I died a little inside, but laughed it off. Was totally turned off by this and I kinda just sat there in shock for a few minutes.

Let me just be the one to say this - I hate when teppanyaki places serve your rice first. By the time any of the other food gets to you, theres no more rice. This was probably the least annoying thing of the entire experience. EXCEPT - for when the penis flashing chef insisted we all try his ""cream"". Please don't take that out of context. One minute I'm eating my rice, the next minute he's forcing some yellowish sauce type cream on the other half of my rice. I took one bite of it and hated it. 
It was terrible. Why would this guy ruin my rice like that?!

 The food was just completely mediocre and absolutely nothing to write home about. I'll probably never come back, or even ever consider it. I think if I was dying of hunger right outside of this place I'd still consider the gum stuck on the sidewalk then go in and have a meal here.",Ozi4jzKG5GtVlVFLcqWpdw,5,2,1,xQs5NSHsljB-oZjcBvkY9A
3024945,2010-10-01,0,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"This place is open LATE, I like most others living in Las Vegas became nocturnal and Vegas dining closes surprisingly early compared to all the other parts of the city that are still thriving all night long. So Musashi was a LIFE SAVER. It become a weekly ritual to have my date night here with my boyfriend. The people watching is awesome, the restaurant is divided into two parts, hibachi tables in one room and sushi bar, booths and tables in the other room. I'll take TEPPANYAKI all day, because you can still order sushi rolls from the other room. You'd be surprised who you will run into here, poker players love this place! 

It's not your average dining experience. You'll probably get drunk, laugh a lot  at conversations with random crazy strangers in VEGAS, and have fun playful banter with your chef. 

The food is really why people keep coming back. The experience is a plus but this place is really my 'cheat meal' when I feel like indulging in fresh hibachi. They are always slammed (even in the AM) but they're generally worth the wait. Where else do I have to be at 3 am anyway? It's normally a couple hours by the time we finish our meal. 

My order is standard for these places, the Musashi Special that includes a taste of pretty much everything. Miso soup, salad, rice, shrimp appetizer, Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail, FRIED RICE and yummy ice cream. It's pricey. About $60 for my meal plus drinks but at night they have saki happy hour. 2 for 1 beer. Shots. Whatever, its great for after a long night out.",kLQmqXOB3-71jR6STtVZ2A,3,2,4,pWljmSRepJo_6rFKg9et7A

First I recommend making reservations and to request Chef/Owner Tsutomu aka Tiger. The chef  is well experienced and will entertain you with his artistic and culinary skills.
 
The location of restaurant is not well marked if you are traveling north on Paradise. It is in a strip mall and the front of the building does not face Paradise. Watch for the cross street Corporate Drive. A tip -  it is across the street from Del Frisco's. 
The restaurant has a colorful Asian flare. The Teppanyaki dining area is separate from the room with regular dining tables. The service staff is very attentive and continues to watch over the table. Teppanyaki dining at Musashi with Chef Tsutomu is like going to the theater. Be prepared to be wowed for 2 hours.
Dinner begins with a small garden salad followed by Miso Soup. The soup was very tasty and flavored with mushrooms and scallions. While you you are enjoying salad and soup the chef is busy preparing the sauces which a too many to remember. But he will provide suggestions for the food paring.
The appetizers ordered were edamame and shrimp tempura. The Shishito Peppers which are seasonal were not available this night. 
Our group ordered a variety of entrees that included New York strip streak, shrimp, scallops, and chicken. But before the entrees the chef prepared the vegetables and fried rice.
All of the items were cooked to perfection as ordered. It's a credit to the chefs experience to keep track how each person ordered the degree of doneness and level of seasoning. 
In my opinion the best were the scallops. They were as tender and fresh as can be expected.
A great beer paring is a large bottle of Sapporo.
The finale was the complementary birthday cakes complete with candle.

I ordered the Musashi Special, which comes with: filet mignon, prawns, scallops, and a lobster tail. Each of the specials also comes with a salad, soup (delish mix of onions, mushrooms and beef), fried rice, veggies, and a shrimp appetizer. 

Our Teppan chef, Nick, was awesome! He really made our 2.5-hour experience completely fun and enjoyable. Yes, they can be pretty raunchy   during the show as described by other Yelpers, but that will only happen if they get that vibe from your table (our table was open to it, so he went there).

All of the food was great - well prepared and flavorful. The sauces they prepare are no joke. They are great! Nick made us their usual sauces and also additional sauces that he thought that we would enjoy.  Spot-on!

The meal ended with ice cream (not all meals include it). The green tea ice cream is really good.

All in all, this is a really fun place with great food. I will definitely be back.",I_Ya_aIkNNtJ46XsmKEk-Q,2,0,4,sokk2ucBOeM2qd2Ru3XrFQ

All while making food look so easy and effortless. This place is a place for people who would love to see the process of how food is made right in front of them with a little ""pazzase.""

Only inconvenience is on holidays, they are super busy and the place will stay booked all night- I think that's the only time we've tasted their food to just be Ok rather than great.   Also since there's a lot of people sitting with one cook we sometimes feel that our food is shared with everybody and we don't get all of it. We've paid attention to see who gets what just to confirm our thoughts and yes, we were right they will share your food with the whole table which sucks because we wish we'd get everything we paid for. Our favorite pick is the Musashi Special which is about $60 per person. Their fried rice is to die for and specially with all their custom sauces.
We've also tried their sushi side and were expecting the best just like their Teppan  side but it was just sushi, nothing really special about their rolls, didn't really care for them.

I had hibachi, filet and salmon. My steak and salmon were cooked to perfection I will say. (My chef was a white man, not hating at all, just not the typical hibachi experience) the fried rice was good. The salad was good. The soup was ok. The veggies were again, ok. The chef did his best but I believe the veggies could be fresher and better quality for him & also my mans lobster was very very chewy. I hear other chefs make several sauces, my group received two which were fine but I was excited to try out the sauces my friends talked about. 

I ordered a bottle of sake when they took my drink order and they never brought it to me. I ended up asking my man to grab us shots from the bar .. As I didn't want to nag about the sake and end up with a surprise ... If you know what I mean. So that was kinda lame. 

About 5 minutes after being seated they turned up the music a few notches, which I figured they did after midnight maybe? Cause I sat down right around midnight. But it was like really loud EDM music and I couldn't even talk to my group/hear them cause it was so loud. I honestly probably wouldn't have even noticed if I had gotten my sake :P

We got started off with some great sake bombs, we kinda  went nuts and bought the way expensive sake bottle at 120 a piece but they have an ok selection if you don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it. Any ways the sake bombs were delicious not to mention we had a waiter there that kept bringing out all these crazy shot's he had concocted. This all happened before the food. 

Our chef came out and he was great, I love teppanyaki places it is like art meets great food. Not only was he amazing at whipping his knives around he was freaking HILARIOUS!

The chef wasn't that good at doing his little tricks, but he was still entertaining. It was during normal hours, and I fell in love with their fried rice and mushrooms. 
Three days later, I came really late at night during their happy hour. We ordered about the same amount food like last time. The server told us it's 50% off so we get half the portions, but it's the same exact food as the normal menu. So we ordered twice as much. 

Here comes the chef who looked at us like, ""great some of my customers are 12 year olds."" Just because we look young, doesn't mean you start downgrading your service (I despise servers like that, and yes, we do look like 12 year olds). I told him twice before he started that no onions on any of our food (my bf is allergic), and he said, ""I'm going to put lots of onions."" He said it in a joking way, but I said it again after just to be sure. He started doing his thing, and he cooked fried rice for the other customers first WITH onions and then he used to same grill to cook our fried rice without cleaning it. The previous chef we had was not like that. He acknowledged our request, and he put us first. Our fried rice had onions...good thing we're smart enough to check. He got even worse when it came to the veggies. He cooked the veggies all at once for everybody, and gave us veggies with onions. Then he goes, ""It might have a little onion."" After that I was so done. I wasn't going to complain anymore because to me this restaurant doesn't exist. I was planning on taking my family here for my graduation dinner, but no thanks. He didn't even give us any mushrooms...he gave all the mushrooms to everybody else. I love mushrooms. I thought we were supposed to get the exact same thing as regular menu.

Our table got lucky being without any under aged customers so we got the 'Only in Vegas' version of the cooking show. The restaurant itself is not very big but it has a homey feeling to it. Not too far from the main strip. The prices range from affordable to high end for entrees including lobster and crab. The portions are big as with any Teppanyaki/Hibachi restaurant. They offer several different meat options, veggies are standard and you can have your meal with white rice or fried rice. This restaurant does not do noodles with your meal which is a little different but they replace that option with bean sprouts. Much healthier. The soup and salad here were very tasty. The broth is not your typical plain wonton or miso soup broth, it actually tasted like beef bone broth. I loved it but it was a little on the salty side. The salads were fresh and the dressing was not over-powering. I ordered a filet mignon entree. Then the show began....

There was a birthday at our table and before the cooking began, the chef brought out a very large black dildo...yes I said black dildo....he went behind the birthday girl and surprised her with it. Told her to close her eyes and then smacked her right in the face with it. Like I said...only in Vegas....then he suction cupped it to the table and went on cooking. With the fried rice, he used a penis shaped mold. How's that for not your typical fried rice.....plus some yum yum sauce squirting out of it....Soon enough I forgot this was a restaurant and I was waiting to eat. It turned into food porn for adults. The food itself was delicious. The shrimp was tender. A large portion of veggies, loaded with butter and soy sauce. My steak was done just the right about of medium rare. Our chef was very entertaining. One unique thing about Musashi is all the sauces they provide you. Besides the typical ginger and white sauce, they give you garlic butter sauce which is made fresh and it is so so so good! You definitely don't want to go on a date or kiss someone after cause it is extremely potent but so worth it.

For many years my favorite in Vegas had been Mizuno's which closed down a few years back shortly after the kids took it over.  It had already started to decline somewhat in popularity amongst the locals.  I had tried a few in town and settled on Hyakumi, although a bit pricy, as the best of the bunch on the strip.  Well that is now closed too, Caesars is going to make a new restaurant concept in the place after over 25 years.

Based on a couple of my Yelp friends reviews I had bookmarked this place off the strip several years ago.  Well I was on an eating frenzy this trip and made it over here.  If you are not a fan of community table eating of any kind then find someplace else.  At least 90% of the time I have enjoyed my table companions and this was no exception.

The food and the show were great!  And reasonably priced for what it is, expect $50-90 depending on what you order with a single glass of beer or wine and tax+tip.  If you want an adult themed show go late to avoid the family crowd.  I got lucky and, even though it was early. there were no young kids at the tables so the young cook was playing to the 20 something ladies I was sharing the table with.  They stay open to 4AM to cater to the crowd that works on the strip.

We stopped here last weekend for a quick dinner as a somewhat last resort when nearby Firefly's was completely overcrowded.  I'm so glad we did!  I have to admit that I was a little wary at first -- the place is in a strip mall and didn't smell so amazing when we first walked in.  (It was totally odd -- couldn't put my finger on it.)  But all worry subsided quickly when we were seated and our server came around!  I'm a pescetarian so I just did sushi, which was probably some of the best I've had, like, ever.  I also got some very reasonably priced sake and Asahi, which complemented the meal nicely.  My husband, bro-in-law, and his wife all got teppan yaki and our chef was hilarious (and R-rated, which made for a fun evening!).  They all raved about their respective meats/fish and I sampled my husband's fried rice, which was probably the best I've ever tasted.

The Samurai Special II with NY steak and scallops was perfect for me! My food was cooked and played with at our teppan station by our beloved chef! Each moresel of food was exquisite! And even better with the sauces that were presented to us.

There were a plethora of sauces and I had a hard time keeping track. Each one was delicious and unique, so I can't really give you tips on which one to go for. 

All Teppan entrees served with miso soup, salad, rice, shrimp appetizer, and assorted vegetables. We had a lot of fun with the shrimp appetizer! Chef Tsutomu made shrimp bunnies!

We also tried the lobster fried rice, which was also very tasty!

As for dessert, I highly recommend the tempura ice cream. Yes, tempura battered and fried vanilla ice cream! And it is just as great as it sounds. :)

..and it's not just the food that makes this place great!

Chef Tsutomu is such a ham. He's hilarious and good at what he does. He is both an expert cook AND an exciting entertainer. If you're thinking about dining at Musashi, request Chef Tsutomu! You definitely won't regret it!!!",U-7EVbeRf1wlSZfHW_gujQ,7,11,5,Bg2BGZuDIKHr41-pXxitSQ

If you're unlucky as us and end up at the regular table, you won't be able to order anything from the teppanyaki menu. You have your own menu of sushi. Man.... that sushi, if you can even call it that, was horrible. I think Ralph's near me has better sushi than this place. I also ordered a chirashi bowl and it was just sad to even look at it. Most of it was salmon (3 pieces).... super thin slices. Their red snapper looking fish (which they said was yellow tail) was really chewy.I think the best thing in that bowl was the imitation crab. 

If you make reservations and get the teppanyaki table, then you're golden. However, do yourself a favor and  eat elsewhere if you cannot.

The reason I gave this place four stars. The soup is extremely spicy with loads of pepper. Not sure how you mess up meso soup. Extremely pricey. There are a lot of choices in Vegas, money can make or break you.

3812067,2008-08-15,2,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"Welcome to the finest Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, possibly the entire country. We have visited this place several times over the past couple years. We are Vegas regulars and go out of our way to visit every time we are in town. 

There are two things that are absolutely outstanding at this restaurant and will blow your mind. First is the service, second is the food. 

The reason we started visiting here was a result of the owner/chef Tsutomu and his previous job. Prior to opening his own restaurant, he worked at the teppan grill in Hamada in the Flamingo. His personality, friendliness and cooking abilities were so impressive that we had to follow him to his new business. After just one visit, he remembered our names. 

The Chef constantly engages his customers, determines their level of comfort and works to reach it. There's really not words to describe how nice and accommodating he is to all his customers. It's obvious they get a lot of regulars as a result of this. It's also nice to see that the owner isn't just sitting the back doing nothing, he cooks on the grill more than anyone else and his wife works the hostess stand sometimes. One time, on our way out, she noticed we were calling a cab, and called it for us, telling them to step on it. All his staff are very polite and well trained. This is one of those rare places, outside my own home, where I always feel truly comfortable and welcome. When they aren't too busy in there, and cooking has finished, the owner will stay to chat for a while at the grill. If you want a remarkable experience for service, come here. I suggest you specifically request (even if you have to wait) for the owner to cook for you, instead of another staff member. It's worth the wait. 

Combine that kind of service, with the food, and you get a winning combination. All the food is excellent, beyond excellent. We cook a lot at home, and know good seasonings, versus salting everything. This guy truly has a talent. Everything from the salads, sushi and grill are recognizable dishes (especially if you've ever been to Benihana's) but with unique twists that give it really special flavors and bring out the ingredients' natural qualities. Even the salad, instead of the typical asian dressing, comes out with (what I think is) an apple flavored dressing. Every sauce in the entire restaurant is hand crafted from his original recipes. The salad and soup are great, but wait until you taste something off that grill. Just when you think he couldn't possibly do any more with the sauces, he adds about 10 more things and it smells even better. We've had the pleasure of him 'testing' his newer sauces on us a few times. Let me be very clear: best ever. We are talking about a culinary genius here. The owner has an honest passion for what he does. I've had steak, shrimp, scallops and even simple teriyaki chicken here, and each was better than the one before. The fried rice is a special treat too. I typically prefer white rice, but always look forward to the fried rice here. 

They have several sake and beer selections here. They get a lot of locals in there after midnight, and they are typically open after 2 or 3am. They enjoy a rowdy crowd in there, but we also took our grandmother and her friends in. The decor is quite nice, not over the top, but not cheesy, like most of these establishments. A cab ride, with tip, from a strip hotel will run you less than $20. 

I cannot recommend this place enough. It's a masterpiece in every way. The prices are moderate. I usually end up spending less than I thought I would, even though they seem high when I look at them. What more can you say about a restaurant with excellent service and the best food this side of the Pacific?

We had a 7:30pm arrived early at 7pm had to wait for the next group to arrive before they started, about 40 min later we started our experience which i was excited about. Since the food channel stated the sauce is what makes them so special. WHAT SAUCE? The only sauce i got was after i finish all my meat and shrimp which was a teriyaki sauce, the cook say put the sauce on the rice. I was thining WTF, i have no more food and rice. Anyway just a bad experience overall, chef was busy talking to a regualr with kids taking up most of his attention and we felt ignored. He was a nice Korean guy, friendly however we felt disconnected from the overall experience. Better to just go with with Benihanna if we are going to do that. No go for me in the future, food was average and service was average. I still gave a 20% tip since it was labor intensive.


P.S also when i went to restroom passing by the other grilling table that crowd was having a blast and they had so many different sauces on their table, The chef is from Hawaii and was doing a great job for the other table. Anyway its just a bummer when you expect more than what you actually get.

3988059,2009-02-04,1,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"slightly overrated.

three friends from San Francisco go in search of the 3rd best steak restaurant in the country (according to the Travel Channel's ""Food Paradise."") so how did Musashi stand up?

the good -- the food. a big reason to go to a teppanyaki restaurant is for the prized Kobe beef, right? unfortunately, our trio took a nasty hit at the blackjack tables earlier that day, and so we weren't feeling as flexible with our spending. i decided to settle for the more affordable filet mignon and shrimp combination, the Hosokawa clan special,  which came with miso, salad, fried rice, and assorted veggies. the shrimp was ridiculously fresh and the accompanying sauces were outstanding. the filet? i felt it was more medium than medium rare, but then again you aren't dealing with massive slices of red porterhouse you would get at a Texas-style beefhouse. the wasabi-mustard sauce was THE standout and none of us were severely burned from the ""flaming onion volcano."" all in all, the food was good. not great, not outstanding, but good. 

the ok -- the service. we sat down for drinks in their lounge and asked about sake and beer selections for the group. our host/server was a little elusive in their answer, until we asked about house favorites to which the reply was: ""well, i don't really like sake or beer. i only drink hard liquor."" my immediate thoughts were: ""come on. at least TRY and humor us or ask someone else in the joint for their opinion. not suitable."" ok, so maybe she was having an off night and it didn't really reflect the service from the rest of the staff. but in the end, our sake/beer questions remained unanswered by the restaurant. thank god for iPhones. 

the really not-so-good -- the wait. i normally attribute abnormally lengthy waits as anomalies, but this one bordered on the absurd and essentially killed the experience. we scheduled 8:00pm reservations (after being denied a 7:30pm and an 8:30pm timeslot) and arrived around 7:58pm. after the hostess told us it would be about a 30 minute delay for the chef to finish up with another group, we were ushered in to the lounge (see ""the ok"") where we proceeded to wait about 45 minutes. after drinks, we were escorted to the grill where i was under the impression things would be heating up. alas, i hovered my hand over the grill only to find it ice-cold. after about a 15 minute wait we were informed that the chef needed 6 more people to join us before he could start cooking and the next party was due to arrive at 9:30pm. it was around 9:45pm before our grill was finally fired up. sure, the staff was genuinely polite through our wait, but that didn't help the fact that i had been running solely on an Encore Cafe Caesar salad and about five Sapporos since 1pm. 

the verdict: it didn't excatly bust our budget and the food was good, but the collective feeling of our party (led by yours truly) was that Musashi is a slightly overhyped experience. maybe next time i'll try the Kobe beef.",SIE7Kcl2C12x1lYWHklOEg,1,0,3,TvpYujZGGJpdrPY7fnIO2A

We came around 10:30 on a Thursday night; the front part of the restaurant was packed, but the teppanyaki part was completely  empty. We were seated right away, and was told the chef would start in a few minutes. 

Another party arrived, and Chef Jason came out. Now, Jason was probably the best part of the entire experience. He was friendly and offered such great service. We had to personally tip him $30 in the end (that's how great he was!) My boyfriend is a sauce person, and Jason made so many delicious sauces that definitely added to the steak and seafood that we ordered.

Some of the reviews mentioned not eating all the fried rice at the beginning of the meal, and it's so true! The rice was so delicious that I managed to finish it all... Before he started cooking anything else. Learned my lesson, because I was so full to fully enjoy the steak, shrimp, lobster tail, and vegetables. He cooked both steaks to a perfect medium rare and the lobster tail was drenched deliciously in a creamy sauce.

I know better, but I never learn.  I am always sad for the fried rice with yum yum sauce that stays behind.  Each time when I give myself the pre Musashi pep talk, I promise myself things like, ""I won't eat the vegetables""  and ""I'll let my husband have the  shrimp appetizer.""  But, it turns out, I'm a liar.  The veggies are as tasty as the rest.  Now, let's talk about sauces.  I am a lady who enjoys condiments, on everything.  Musashi gets me, there are so many different freshly made sauces each bite of each course is an experience.  I have considered asking for a straw, but I would be distraught if they decided to never let me in again.  The last time, I was in Vegas I figured it all out though.  Musashi two nights in a row.

He knew how to entertain the crowd, and not keep the noise at a silence.  Even though most of his jokes did have a dirty connotation to it, I thought he was a character.  The prices are a little high, but for a group of five we paid a little over $150.00 (not including tip).  

Tepanyaki allows the chef to cook your food right in front of you, while putting a show.  (Well, I think that's what it is to my understanding)  This place gives you a vast array of dipping sauces for your food.  My personal favorite is the yum-yum sauce, and the lemon garlic butter would be the second.  I did wish they cooked the food all at once, because you wait for rice, veggies, then meats to be cooked and then you can eat.  It's like a long wait cause he puts a show with it.  The fried rice is good, I've had better but it does compliment the food you eat.  The chef even gives you choice of either adding spice, or no spice.  I ordered the Musashi special, which was like $58.00.  It came with prawns, shrimp, lobster tail, steak and one dessert.  The steak came out really tender, and the shrimp had an amazing flavor with the yum-yum sauce.  And the lobster tail tasted off the hook with the garlic butter lemon sauce.  The veggies were mediocre, but the green tea ice cream did settle everything down in my stomach.  The flavors are such a variety, you wouldn't know what hit you.

I think all of their sushi creations are tasty. I know there are a lot of good ""all you can eat"" sushi bars in Las Vegas, but the portions here are huge and you get your moneys worth for the $15 roll. 

Plus, sometimes if your date orders ""surf and turf"" teppan you might get a morsel or two of the juicy goodness, just because your chef knows ""women come first""

They like to joke a lot and ask questions. They also do tricks with their utensils and hats as most teppan grill chefs do. 

We have come here about 5 times. The teppan chefs are nice and really cool! A lot of famous people come here. You can see their photos taken with the teppan chef on the walls. 

This place gets a five because I have never complained about anything here. Everyone I meet and talk to are from out of town and keep returning here because the food is good.

I want to try to Kobe teppan one day, but its $100 per person. I don't know if I want to pay that! If I win the World Series I definintely will be coming in for some kobe and sashimi!

I remember going to a lot of benihana's (in Las Vegas, and San Diego) and usually they  have Hispanic Chefs. I am not saying that Hispanic chefs suck, but the Japanese teppan chef really add an interesting personality that enhances their Japanese cuisine!

This place has a good lunch teppan menu, and happy hour. But everything they make is perfect. They make a steak miso soup, perfect teppan friend rice, and the ambiance is great. It is is the same strip mall as a lot of great choice dinning options, but if I were in the mood for steak and lobster, I would choose here over Ruth's Chris anyday.",Y8akYgxl9PkE5LsZxwqRfg,1,0,5,8l5vNMiag4eqeA8zyanYhA

We arrived a little before midnight and the host looked like he was not in the mood to work. We asked for a place for two and my husband asked about being sitted where they set the food on fire, excuse my memory but I can't remember the name of that place but I know it's not the bar, and the host looked like he didn't like us asking, he looked really unhappy. Asked us for a moment and then came back to walk us there. Everybody looked like they were not happy to see us and nobody said hello or smiled at us. Just a reminder, it's not  ""all you can eat"", it wasn't happy hour time and the place is expensive, so if we were still willing to have dinner there I would appreciate not feeling like  we were not welcome or bothering them.
We sat down but I immediately asked my husband if we could go somewhere else, such a heavy vibe.
Nobody but the host said goodbye either. Zero appreciation.
We crossed the parking lot and went to sushi way, which is cheaper, has the ""all you can eat"" option and a very friendly staff.",oH-pRxI7Q-qZbZaoVQHeTw,2,0,1,QST0aQZ1AjGW4RI3GPBFgA

My co-workers chose this place for our unofficial holiday dinner, and it couldn't have gone any better! From start to end, this place had delicious food, friendly wait staff, intriguing atmosphere, and everything else you could possibly ask for in a great restaurant.

As we all trickled into the restaurant, we ordered drinks and a few sushi rolls from the bar. The sushi chef was excellent, and a true artist. Every roll that was presented looked absolutely stunning and delicious. Believe me, they didn't just look delicious, they knocked your socks off in flavor. Unanimously, the ""Grand Finale"" roll(refer to pic) killed the competition. So delicious!

After a few minutes, we were sat at our table. We placed our orders, and were all able to order from the happy hour menu which starts at 12am and ends at 3am. Everybody was ordering hot sake, and Asahi beers(both were under happy hour). We also ordered a few bottles of their chilled Junmi Sake(refer to pic) which everybody, even the non-sake drinkers, thoroughly enjoyed.  As soon as our Chef, Chef Nick, came out from behind the japanese curtains separating the kitchen and dining room, he was the best entertainment since Leo Gallagher and his famous sledgehammer. He was truly HILARIOUS, entertaining, and artistic. The Teppanyaki was everything and more, than what I could have ever imagined. 

This restaurant experience was a one of the best I have ever had. When you have the pleasure of dining with close friends/co-workers, and feel as though you made more friends after leaving then when you arrived, its simply incredible.

Anyways, I got the chicken and the shrimp, but you can pick whatever you want such as steak, lobster, etc.  Its just gets a little pricey. obvi.  That comes with fried rice and grilled veggies.  The rice is so amazing.  Probably one of the best fried rice ever especially with that man sauce drizzled all over it (ask for it!) It's a secret, thank me later! I wonder if I could take a bottle of it to go and bring it back to california. Muhaha.  The shrimp and the chicken are really good too! Overall, the food is garlic-y and super savory. MMM.  I chefs are very generous too, gave us extra rice and meat! The portions are big enough though!

i only deducted a star because the time I went which was around 2am (after the club) haha, the wait was so long! Not because there was so many people, the service.  I don't know if that is a regular thing or because it was late night? I was quite disappointed and very impatient.  However, the man sauce made up for the rest of the review.

First thing is on the website it says that late night happy hour starts at 11pm, this is half true. Late night happy hour dinner area starts at 11pm, teppanyaki starts at midnight. Sushi rolls vary from $3.50-5 wide variety smaller than normal. You can order off full sushi menu at full price. Teppanyaki Filet mignon $16, seafood (calamari, crab sticks (imitation crab), scallops, shrimp $18.50. Place is packed at midnight so reservations are a good idea. Waiters aren't the friendliest, ambiance is okay, clean but no benihana. Like I said, if you're looking for a fancy Japonese restaurant... this isn't for you. Small only 2 teppan sections / 4 stove stations. Locals place, big on group events. They don't start taking your order till 12:20am, start teppan cooking till at least 12:45am so if you arrive at midnight, just plan on waiting, however if you don't come right at 12 or a little before, you may not get a seat. Sushi bar is open so share a roll and that'll tie you over. 1 hour 45 min later meal was finished. Chef was very nice and friendly, apologized for our long wait and the food was delicious.

4574399,2011-09-09,0,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"OK... most of my friends will BURN me for the 3-Star rating.   here's my take:

-----TIME SPENT
2x times @ night

-----LAYOUT
small, couple tables, 2 hibachi grills...  seen one hibachi, seen them all.   i DARE anyone tell me that this place has a unique look.

-----SERVICE
prompt seating...   attentive and cheerful waitress.   the ONLY good performer is the owner himself.   another reason why this place is only 3-Star.   his other cook is Mexican (sorry) and is a boring and standard in hibachi performance...   to be fair, i've never had him, but i glance over now n then to see his quiet performance.   sorry again.^^

my friends will kill me on this too, but the owner himself isn't too impressive.   he has a couple of good jokes, but i've seen ALL of his tricks used by other hibachi chefs....   i'm sorry to be so scathing.   i really hate seeing the same things over and over again.   it's like watching another zombie flick.

the ONLY trick that was new to me was that he made rabbits out of shrimp.   i thought it was delightful at which point.   however, he does the volcano, he finds someone to pick on and throws shrimp at, he spins the egg and lands it on his spatula....  i know it's HARD to do, but common fair.   

there was a hibachi chef in texas a few years back (http://www.samuraioftokyo.com) that also owned his own place.   i recalled how masterfully he would incorporate words with whatever he was doing.   like, he would use his spatula to cut eggs, but he would then scratch it back and forth like a DJ and say funny things....  and that was what Musashi's owner was missing.   creativity.

i even remember hearing my friend apologizing to me about the chef's performance.   he told me that the man probably wasn't being his usual funny self because my friend was a regular there and the chef didn't want to deliver his usual routine....   but so what.   being the owner and a hibachi chef should mean something...  it's like being the headlining comedian but not feeling like delivering your trademark punchlines.

the food was excellant at least and the chef made some good sauces on the side.   to be honest tho, i've never had anyone mess up fried rice and rare steak at a hibachi - and his sauces ARE NOT hard to make...   sh*t, i cook the same fried rice & steak at home and i'm just an AVERAGE cook...   good meal nonetheless.^^;

-----PRICING
pricey - but pretty much the average fair as hibachi meals go.  $24-$30 a plate and $40+ for pricier combos.

-----CLOSING
if you're going to open up a hibachi place, i can understand the need to entertain with basic routines... but you're in Vegas and you're the damn owner for god sakes.!  be creative - make your routines lead into unique results...   i really wanted to come and enjoy a show because i genuiningly love hibachis...  so i kind of felt robbed of a unqiue experience....

BTW, i've read the other reviews after writing my own...  and the words ""TYPICAL"" and ""AVERAGE"" pops out a lot.   why give this place 4-Stars when you used any of those words in your review.??

3-Stars for being JUST another Hibachi to me.",nxtqjMAPbIyJT2-0rYFUbA,3,0,3,jTD3YRudmCxuWg0UhTKe6g

I just ended my TAM card exam a few stores away earlier this afternoon and my father suggest that we grabbed lunch somewhere close by. Apparently Musashi had a lunch special going on, $9.50 for a bento box - which was quite expensive compared to $.8.50 at RA by the Fashion Show Mall considering this place offered quite a shady atmosphere. It was a little secluded and just...dark for the most part, not exactly the kind of environment that favors a happy dining experience. 

We ordered a bento with a choice of tonkatsu (pork cutlet) and shrimp/vegetable tempura. It came with miso soup, a potsticker, edamame and salad. Since we weren't too hungry, we asked for an extra bowl of rice only to find out later that additional rice orders were free...and for that I gave this review an extra star. The food was pretty good although I'd recommend Go Wild Sushi and Grill (on Tenaya and Sahara) a thousand folds over Musashi, taking everything into consideration. 

At some point, we noticed how the place needed quite a make-over. The booth couches were ripping and the music wasn't very accomodating. Summing everything up, the restaurant left quite a lasting impression that won't have me going back for awhile.

I've eaten a lot of teppanyaki in my time.  They're all pretty good, but in then end, meh.  They're all the same. With that said, this place is not the same.  This place is a cut above the rest.  The ingredients here were definitely better, the number of sauces they provided were greater, and the entertainment was much, much better.  With that said, they entertained us like we were a bachelor party, which we were.  So you might not get that part if you eat here but you'll definitely get the food which is the best teppanyaki I've ever had.

Order the Miyazaki beef.  It's like butter.  Look it up.  It's better than the overhyped Kobe beef that's on every other menu in the States. Though in actuality, I've learned that in most of the cases, what you're getting is not true Kobe beef.  So maybe they are comparable. They're both from the same Wyagu breed.",FeAVcwJ5XCJdjc9-atv1yA,2,1,5,DGjyhignk-lJ6Vq7RTEISQ

The food is absolutely amazing.  Both on the sushi side & on the teppanyaki side.  We prefer the teppanyaki side because who doesn't love a super fresh meal with a good show?!  My usual order is the chicken & shrimp (Katana).   When I need a little something different, I go for the salmon & shrimp (Ninja).   It comes with salad (yummy sweet ginger dressing), a beef soup (DELICIOUS), a shrimp appetizer, veggies, the meats (with your choice of sauce) & rice.  For a small fee, you can upgrade to the fried rice.  I highly suggest you opt for the fried rice.  It's so worth it.  

We have also ordered some of the sushi rolls to start off & our favorite is the ""J in Your Mouth"" which is a deep fried Philadelphia roll (salmon, avocado & cream cheese) with eel & spicy mayo drizzled on top.  We are also huge fans of the spicy shrimp roll & lobster roll.  As for drinks - make sure you try one of their flavored saketinis!  My favorite is the white peach.  I also enjoy the raspberry.

We have a preference to ask for Tiger (the owner & best chef in my opinion) when we visit because he does make some different sauces that none of the other chefs make.  Plus we love his overall attitude.  He aims to please the customers he is cooking for & if there is anything that can be done to make you more comfortable or if you have any specific restrictions (dietary or otherwise), he & his staff make sure to accommodate you any way they can.  I have taken my daughters (one of them is in a wheelchair - the restaurant is totally ADA compliant & convenient) & other family members who have all enjoyed themselves.  Tiger puts on a great family show for the kids.  If you're looking for something a little more adult - he can absolutely do that as well!  Some of our favorite late night memories with a bunch of friends has taken place here! 

I think the main reason it's taken so long to write this review is because I had too many positive things to say.  It is our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas & whenever we get the chance, we visit.  We also make sure to recommend it to everyone we know looking for somewhere delicious to go.  Heck, we have friends that refuse to come to Vegas & meet us anywhere else!  We are always happy to make that happen.  :)",vb4Y_Kw9JGS6DKgSQE_XrQ,1,0,5,uaNPaXylKNnpjpAJgZd0mA

He definitely has a good memory and makes for an entertaining conversation during dinner with my family and friends.  His special sauces are the best.  I normally get the rib eye, but had my first taste of Kobe beef here, which was REALLY good.  Rib eye is a good choice if you don't want to spend as much, however, if you don't mind spending a little bit more, the Kobe beef was worth it.",2Na5lgDJwN1dPyvLmKmWgg,0,0,5,EaGGkQATxbC0wWJWnIGaPQ

The apple saki is very yummy! It's a perfect blend. It's not sweet or too strong. Just right. Their sushi is fresh and they don't add too much rice to the nigiri which is a plus.

Got to be seated with Chef Tsutomu and he was AMAZING. Funny and super talented. What I thought was cool was he made a lot of the sauces in front of you. Most of the places I've been in in the past already had the sauces done. He cooked the shrimp with yum yum sauce to perfection and my fiancé filet was cooked to perfection. I would have liked to veggies before the entree but all was delicious. 
At the end he cooked the beef fat. So freaking good. 
I tried the yakisoba noddles. Usually not a fan and still not a fan haha but his was better than most. When you get the fried rice YES to the garlic sauce. 
If I were to do it again...filet and shrimp all the way.

We did the teppanyaki and we had a reservation for 6 people at 6pm.  Setting the reservation itself was very easy I called around 10 am and they answered right away. However, when I called back a couple times there was no answer and around 4:30 I got a text (they ask for your phone number when you make the reservation) asking if we could come at 5:30. I told them that was not possible as we had made the reservation for 6 and weren't back at our hotel yet and they said they would just try and make it work...

We arrived a little before 6 to make sure we were on time since we were going to be there at 5:30, but unfortunately since we we're sat with other people who didn't show up until 6:15 we had to wait for them.  I know that is not the restaurants fault but some information and even drinks before the other people arrived would have been great. We were sat at the table for 15 minutes without having someone come by.  The girls that were late finally got there and we were able to order. 

The chef came over around 6:45/7 since he was working on the table next to us when we first got there. Like I said the food was very good and the scallops and shrimp that I got were very well flavored.  The only issue I had was with the chefs jokes.  I get that out table was all older but the raunchy jokes and even the things that he did with the food to make it sexual was a little too much.  Our whole group was feeling like it was being taken too far.  

Overall, I may go back if I am in Vegas since it is always fun for a big group and the food was good, but I would make sure we had a bigger group so we wouldn't have to wait on people who were late and I would maybe ask for a different chef.",jkckGEa9jroz1aNp6MaStg,0,0,3,5dsXP6wmRseC9z8KNNf5gQ

The paint is chipping/dirty, the furnishings have seen their better days, and any decorations that they did have were modest at best. They do have some really cool kimonos on the walls though. Probably to cover a hole in the wall or gang graffiti or something.

The bathroom is a complete disaster. The door didn't lock and the upkeep was... Basically there is no upkeep. I've seen frat houses have cleaner bathrooms. It was pretty gross.

So after all that, I STILL gave this place four stars. Why? The food is that good and the price they charge at happy hour is ridiculously cheap. The food is comparable, if not better, than the much more expensive teppenyaki locations. Literally the cost is about 1/3 or 1/4 what you would spend at Benihanas. The chefs are all very friendly and they put on a fun/funny show, but thats nothing new to this type of setting. 

I do not recommend the sushi here. Stick with the teppenyaki. The uni that I ordered looked and tasted like it was scraped off the bathroom floor.

Musashi wasn't busy on a week night and there was only 2 tables the whole time we were there so there was a little lack of atmosphere you find in busier places. The whole experience depends on the chef you get. Over the years I've had drunk chefs, chefs that were maybe the first day on the job but for the most part I've had skillful chefs. Our chef admitted up front he was enjoying his day off with some drinks and someone didn't show for work so he was called in. I've been in his boat so could understand. It showed in his juggling with the spatula and fork and when it got to the egg toss it wasn't so good. There were a lot of things lacking like tossing stuff and catching it in his hat or tossing food so you try to catch it in your mouth. I think we got the "" I shouldn't really be here cooking for you guys"" show. I ordered a bottle of chilled sake and it showed up in a ceramic sake flask. I've never seen that before. My son worked in a sushi restaurant and any sake showing up in a ceramic flask is the really cheap stuff. The food itself was O.K, perhaps a little overcooked and $3.50 for fried rice which had little else in it a bit overpriced. Musashi does give you extra sauces, chili paste and schriaca if you like spicy and he did make a garlic butter sauce but the presentation was lacking as he only got part of the sauce in the containers. The adult part of the show where he slaps rice into a penis shaped mold was a bit tacky. We were entertaining guests from a small town in the U.K so they probably never noticed it was sub par.

But, I guess the upside is that these shows do work and get people through the door.  The bar wasn't huge and on the dark side.  But, that was fine with me, it was good ambiance.  Also, the price for JW Black wasn't crazy.  Good pour.

We had a very fun table, everyone was into it and had a good time.  I've found at teppanyaki joints this is key, the more your fellow diners are into it, the better of a time you tend to have.  Our table was full and people were into it.  Also, the group wasn't entirely tourists, I'd say it was at least 50% locals.

The starters were standard for this type of meal.  Our chef was very colorful and more skilled than many other teppanyaki chefs I've had in the past.  

We had the Musashi special, which is basically every meat they have.  The steak was cooked exactly to order.  The seafood (shrimp and lobster) was very tender and not overcooked, but also not undercooked.  The sauces were excellent accompaniments, and the fried rice was very good.

I wanted someplace reasonably priced with convenient seating for the nine people in my party who could do saki bombs without being looked at like we are weird and oh yeah, good food.  Check, check, check and check!!

First let me tell you about the food.  No other teppan style restaurant compares.  Musashi is so delicious.  A lot of times, teppan for me is tasteless because all it is is just unseasened food being grilled, not much flavor or style, but evertying Tiger made for us was mouthwatering.  And if you are a sauce person, he makes about a half dozen for you to try and advises you which sauce to eat with what type of food.  And the portions are so generous that two people can definately share one plate so go ahead and order the lobster and rib eye (even though we ordered that AND the sea bass and chicken...both so yum).  Do get the fried rice as it is really delicious.

And now for the entertainment.  All nine of us agreed that we had the best time.  All nine of us agreed that we are coming back next time we are back in Vegas.  All nine of us were in stiched laughing we had such a good time.

Don't hesitate on holding your event here!  And request Tiger to perpare your food.  He has some skilz fo sho!!!",mCrqL6ABB9Aq1_1WWxFIrw,0,0,5,dSDZrtBdA3cjZTbkNCkMxw

This time around I took my family who's never had a teppanyaki style dinner before. I made reservations for 8pm last night, and we got there 30 minutes early. We were really happy that they were able to sit is right  away and we didn't have to wait another 30min.

The service was great. But the chef we got was disappointing. First, he talked really low and I couldn't hear the jokes that were part of the act. Ok.. That's not such a big problem. But as he was going through the whole thing I noticed he skipped a lot of tricks or special maneuvers. Mind you, I'm an avid eater at teppanyaki places and the acts everywhere are pretty much the same. So to see that he skipped the beating heart part, broke my heart. He also skipped a number of things too, that I was looking forward for my family to witness. Again, they've never had this type of dinner/show before let alone been to Vegas.

Maybe the act isn't mandatory or the chefs don't have to have jokes and special gestures? I don't know. I just felt kind of let down.

Our chef's name was Joan (sp?), and he was awesome!!! So friendly and funny. Our party had 10 people total, including one child and another minor, and he balanced the conversation and focus very well. 

Not to mention the food was stellar! I had low expectations because I'd been to Benihana before, and that experience definitely paled in comparison, both in showmanship and in cuisine. I always thought teppanyaki was more about the show than about the food, as oxymoronic as that sounds. Joan proved me wrong! The fried rice was absolutely delicious, the shrimp and chicken I ordered were juicy and flavorful, and the sauces he created were out of this world! I'm drooling at the mere memory...

I wanted to lick my plate before we left. Seriously. The next time I go to Vegas, Musashi will be at the top of my list!",MEdsbK5KTW16uFZ3g8Y38w,1,0,5,EEpiM4Hx0m2ZYiYYMVLQbQ

5049654,2010-02-23,1,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"Been here twice and both times were nice.

Did my 21st birthday dinner here and it was good. Everything was  cooked well and the sauces are great. I had shrimp and scallops and I'm really particular about people over cooking seafood but it was right where it should be- perfectly cooked scallops are hard to find!. He would tell us random drunk stories and how he got his job- apparently the owner is his brother in law. He doesnt seem to have a tight routine show as some of the other teppan-tainers but kinda fun winging it feel. It has some appeal that hes personal with us, like he's a buddy telling us his misadventures while they're hosting dinner. 

2nd time was we had a visitor so the whole family- my bf, his mom and grandma and his uncle from Amsterdam came here so our visitor can experience something different. This time we had Tiger, the owner. I got shrimp and steak this time and it was pretty good again.  His routine is the best, but its a show routine hes had time to put down. He also had a few extra sauces that the first time we did not get and fried potatoes. My BF does not like fat usually (but I do!) - here they get the fat if you order a NY steak and cut it up and reduce it down and put sauce on it....he loved it! Not too fatty/greasy at all, but more of a tasty concentrated morsel of beefy flavor in teriyaki sauce.  Our guest was happy and mom and grandma liked it. They are light eaters and they allowed them to split an entree which was perfect for them so just a tip for light eaters to maybe see if you can share. Even for me, a big eater, one meal combo gets me hella stuffed! 

THEORY ABOUT LUNCH:

Seems like a lot of the bad reviews are from the lunch time. From what I know about teppans lunches are usually the times when the novice teppan cooks are up to practice on smaller crowds. Could explain the difference in pricing from lunch to dinner here and a lot of comments that it wasn't so entertaining and more just cooking . Some of the same ingredients, but maybe dinner are the skilled chefs who know how to entertain and cook (the owner after all usually mans one of the teppans at dinner).For a entertaining experience and quality control warrants a higher price- to me its fair. Havent confirmed this, but just a theory about trainees and maybe I'll ask next time I'm there as well as try to catch a lunch teppan to really rate this place as a whole. I'm sure though dinner isn't always perfect either. I've been cooking for a long time and like to talk, but when guests and distractions are about even I can f*** up some of my star dishes.

 So far my experiences have been good here and I have been to a lot of teppan spots.

Dinner prices are fair- even Benihana charges comparable rates for combos meats at dinner time so its not pricier than another teppan, but I feel I get better quality here and Tiger is awesome. I like that you can go all out and have a wide range of teppan meats here unlike others, but I probably would not go and spend the hundred for the kobe. I enjoy the seafood platters though so I'll probably splurge on a lobster tail eventually. 

Fun for big parties, 2nd time we shared with another small party, but they were cool peeps so no complaints about that, but just more fun when it's only among friends.

Coming back to try a lunch teppan and would love to do the late night small plates in the dining side.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,5,5,zSnJ021Dezt6iTcXHb1iCA

Unlike other teppanyaki restaurants they have many different homemade very yummy dipping sauces to go with meal.

Great spot to unwind with good teppanyaki prepared by talented, sometimes lewd, chefs in an unpretentious, fun atmosphere.

The classic teppanyaki ""show"" is almost flawless in execution from years of experience.  Chefs effortlessly carry on a fun conversation while creating very consistently flavored and accurately cooked food.  Something very difficult to find in teppanyaki joints.

Steaks are cooked to temperature and served with eight dipping sauces, many made on the teppan cook top.  Prawns and lobster tails are sweet and cooked right.  Well cooked veg.  Tasty fried rice (no comment about the chef's sauce).

Dinner sets offer the best selection and value with most sets below $35.

The chef always puts on an elaborate show with acrobatic shrimp and flying vegetables to entertain and wow the guests.  You will always leave this place  fully stuffed and drunk (well at least me lol)!

If you come to Teppanyaki restaurants often, you will often get tired of the same routine they pull, so it's best to go once in a while or bring friends who never experienced it themselves. But the food is always delicious so I don't mind some of the acts getting old really.

My favorite is the Musashi Special, it comes with Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail,

5199286,2010-09-18,17,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"One general rule for restaurants should be: Don't place a collection of Yankee Candles on your hostess stand. From the moment we entered, all I could smell and taste was an overpowering potpourri that reminded me of the cheapest commercial grade bathroom cleaner. As we were leaving, I located the culprit, 2 giant Yankee Candles blazing away. I am not sure why the candles were necessary, but the scent severely undermined my dining experience.

I thought the interior was shabby. I can't explain it, perhaps it all goes back to the scent, but I just got a bad vibe from the surroundings. I requested a wine list, and it had stains. All the little details just added up to a less than amazing impression.

As for the food, I think the main attraction here is the ""Kobe,"" but I was not in the mood for meat, so I opted for the vegetarian entree, which was surprisingly $2 more than the chicken. It did include tofu, a surprising find. I am sure that the food differs greatly from chef to chef, but everything was overseasoned with white pepper. I can handle a small dash of white pepper, but in large quantities, I do not care for the taste. Every item had a heavy dousing of white pepper, so I did not love anything. The chef did create a series of special sauces with sesame seeds, and they were pretty tasty, but the white pepper flavor was there too! 

Our chef was nice, but I am not a fan of sexual innuendos while dining. Call me a prude! Our chef only made the occasional innuendo, but one was directed at me... gross! And, I saw the chef at the adjacent table shape the fried rice into a giant penis and sprinkle ""hair"" on top. This might be hilarious for some people, but I just think it is odd. Yeah, I am that girl that doesn't appreciate penis jokes. However, I accept that some people find them clever.

This is a generous 3 stars simply because my husband enjoyed his salmon, and our waiter was nice. He brought me a new glass of wine when I thought the first one was spoiled. Plus, the white pepper thing may be a personal preference. There is also the possibility that the sushi is good, and they are open until 4am, which is worth at least one star.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,27,15,3,vUeMm-MbBvMbbYlTWREnYg

I came here for a late night dinner around midnight with my fiance and I thought we were going to be the only ones in the restaurant. Nope. Our table had three separate parties and the head chef was BOOKED. At nearly midnight!

I ordered the steak and scallop combo. Broke da mouth! Although the steak was tender and cooked just the way I wanted it (medium rare), the highlight of dinner were the SCALLOPS. The scallops were perfectly cooked - caramelized and golden brown pan-fried on the outside with a soft, juicy center. The two dipping sauces were also quite good as well as the fried rice. 

Many thanks to our amazing chef, who happened to be the nephew of the head chef, for a delightful, fun and entertaining dinner experience. He was very skilled and better than any of the other teppanyaki chefs I've encountered so far in terms of throwing techniques/tricks and cooking. He was a good conversationalist and made us feel welcome in the restaurant. Not only our chef, but also the other restaurant staff were attentive and friendly. We always had full glasses of water and were checked on several times throughout dinner service.

Highly recommended for dinner. Make reservations ahead of time if you want the head chef.

We made an 8:30pm reservation less than an hour before and were seated at a full table.  My wife got the filet mignon/shrimp combo.  I got the NY strip/salmon combo.  The fried rice is $3.50 and well worth it.  We were also served a bevy of vegetables including zucchini, onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts all cooked to perfection.  I actually preferred the sirloin over filet here since they chop it up and put a lot of sauce on it.  We were also able to try a portion of the scallops due to a wrong order and those were really good too.  

I get Misti Y's ""shabby"" comment regarding the interior.  The teppanyaki area felt kind of basementy but you kind of forget about it once the chef starts.  The bar area seemed pretty makeshift too.  It wasn't exactly an area you'd spend an hour at.  

On a side note, maybe it's me being a snob but I scoff at people that order well done steaks.  I know it's a personal choice that I should respect but why would you want to do that to a steak?  No less than 4 people at our table ordered well done!  Their raw cuts of filet looked quite different than the others that ordered rare or medium rare.  Lower quality perhaps?  3 people also straight up didn't want any vegetables even in their fried rice.  Grown people!  More for the rest of us!!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,16,14,4,e2L6wcWadwg67SOTYXze7g

5551322,2016-06-10,2,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"The hibachi restaurant design is likely either hit or miss and in Vegas we are certainly not limited on the hibachi department. Enter Musashi, the small four table restaurant that most probably don't know exists except for the foodies who reviewed it to begin with. It is a no nonsense kind of restaurant, the kind that wouldn't seat me when I was 5 minutes early even though it was empty.

But of course the real question: what sets this place apart from the rest? Two things:

1) There are some unique menu items that you won't find at other hibachi locations. For example, quail eggs wrapped in bacon that explode in your mouth. Pretty darn good. In addition they have some kobe beef options that some hibachi restaurants might not have, although the upper scale ones probably still will.

2) Sauce heaven. If you go to a hibachi restaurant you usually can expect 2-3 sauces to go with your food. And they can range from decent to amazing. Well here you get 7 or 8 that they prepare at varying stages during the performance. It can seem overwhelming but there's a great variety in flavors that are worth trying. Of course I had finished my food by sauce 5 not realizing there would be more.

Overall the food quality was pretty good but not mind blowing. Of course the quality of food at a hibachi place probably has a cap and this was up there but I've had better. The ginger salad wasn't my favorite version and the soup decent enough. It's kind of a restaurant of gimmicks. One of the sauces they give isnt even a sauce it's just tiny pieces of fat from the steaks that were cut off at the beginning and turned into a little treat at the end of the meal. Tasty and cute but silly.

My rating is comparative to other hibachi restaurants and the fact is that Ive had better food at the benihana in the Westgate. That might be because I had a special waiter there who would give me 100 dollars of free food but yolo.

Make a reservation, and it doesn't matter if David Copperfield himself walks in first, they make sure you are taken care of.

When in Vegas....some of the better restaurants are located just off the strip...that Musashi Japanese Steakhouse was just that.

So, after dropping $400 on a Black Jack table (losing 7 out of  8 hands) in less than 10 minutes it was decided that it was time for dinner.  At least the room was comp.  

Whisked away in a large black vehicle our party arrived at Musashi Japanese Steakhouse.  We were hungry, we were ecstatic....no wait, no line....what a way to go.  We were seated, drinks ordered and menus were served.

Here is what we decided on:

Ika-Yaki (Baked Squid)

Broiled Salmon

It didn't take too long before our food had arrived, but we were running behind schedule as we were....there was another table waiting for us at another event....so we still asked our server to please hurry up....sure enough our food began to arrive.

First the Ika-Yaki.....for those of you who like Baked Squid, this was not a bad dish.  

Next was the Broiled Salmon....the Salmon was very fresh and not over cooked.  Very moist and tasty as it was covered in Teriyaki sauce.  The sauce was just about right, not an over dominating flavor.

This was followed by the NY Steak and Rib-Eye.  I have no idea what a NY Steak is doing in a Japanese Restaurant....but that was what we had ordered.  The Rib-Eye was a much better cut, soft and tender, juicy and topped off with some Teriyaki Sauce.  The NY Steak was done the same way, not too bad...I can't complain much about the NY Steak...just that my preference would be the Rib-Eye.

As we were half way through our meal...the rolls began to come.

The 99% roll came first and was all too good to not eat one piece but you just had to eat 2 pieces or more.

We had one more roll coming.....and our server had just informed me that our Ex-Girlfriend will be a little late.  DARN!!  I picked up my phone and called my Ex....she's late as usual....

Ok....I need to settle down a little....I should have gone for the Porn Star instead.....would have been rolling in style.  So finally our Ex-Girlfriend shows up and we just devour her as quickly as we can.   To my surprise it was very good.  Crab, avocado, spicy tuna with halibut tempura and spicy mayo.

Next time I'm going for the Porn Star, she'll be at the table before the Ex-Girl Friend.  I'm also looking forward to their Kama Sutra roll next time.

Overall, the meal was exotic, climatic with loads of orgasmic flavors.  Such an explosive meal....off to the next event.  Will be back for the Porn Star for sure!!

Place was clean, bathrooms clean, not too loud and a nice atmosphere.  

A restaurant to try when in Vegas!!

i've been to so many teppan places in hawaiii---kobe steakhouse, tanaka of tokyo, benihana; none of them can even come close to my time at musashi.  not only was the chef super entertaining, but the food was SOOOOOO good.  

i'll start with the chef---his name is tsutomu.  SO entertaining, SO hilarious, SO fast with that knife and two prong fork, did i mention SO entertaining?  i seriously had the teppan time of my life.  i don't think i've ever had a chef that made me laugh so much and dub me a new name (mercedes).  AND told a (dirty) story about rabbits using the shrimp.  AAAAND busted out so many kinky knick-knacks and toys.  it is definitely recommended that you ask for him.

now, the food---i felt like i got so much more food at this place than any other.  and so many different sauces too!  i swear there were at least 8 different ones.  garlic, spicy, sweet, ginger, mustard, aioli, etc.  i was so amazed!  my favorite has got to be the garlic one since i LOVE garlic.  i also enjoyed the fact that strips of potato were included in the meal.  i think i liked that the most.  i ordered the katana special which consisted of chicken and shrimp.  sooooo yummy.  i also had a bite of my friend's steak which he drizzled with lime (something i had never seen).  surprisingly, it was really tasty!  i ate a little bit of the lobster fried rice too and as much as i don't care for lobster, it was pretty effin great.  but of course, my faaaaaave was the dessert.  tempura ice cream! need i say more???

the next time i go back to vegas, i'm def hitting up musashi and tsutomu again!!! :)

On my last visit we ate at the Sushi side, and noticed the sushi chef was not the same guy.  This reflected on my personal favorite dish: The Ahi Poke salad.

Four of us ordered the poke and found it to be extremely peppery and spicy hot.  Yes, Poke should have a kick, but none of us were able to enjoy it.  We commented to the chef and waiter the extreme spiciness, and even said every time we go to Vegas (which is multiple times a year) we always stop at Musashi and order the Poke salad.

The chef actually gave me a negative feedback by saying that is how HE does it, and didn't apologize.  I was upset at how he dismissed my complaint. He didn't bother to re-do my dish, and I know he could hear my table's entire conversation at our displeasure (we were sitting next to the Sushi bar!).  

I know the chef changed because even the presentation of the salad was different.  I will go back to Musashi, but next time I order the Ahi Poke salad, I will specify to not be so peppery, and not be so ""red hot"" spicy. 

I still am fuming over the last visit, and hope that Musashi will address this review.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,5,2,3,5FXoPnPZOYNDgDUU8AkEuA

Its so fun and the cooks are awesome and friendly, and the food well the food is slap your momma good! They have two types of shows to see the clean show and the dirty show (usually plays later at night when no kids are there), both shows are fun and entertaining. Throughout the show they do lots of tricks and they make amazing sauces that you won't get anywhere else.  Not only is their teppan fantastic and soooooooooo soooooooooo yummy their sushi is amazing also our favorite roll to get is the wet dream.

We were told we'd have to wait awhile to be seated but ended up being seated right away. I'd suggest a reservation if you want a definite time. I liked that we could still order sushi even though we were there for the teppanyaki. I order the white girl and it was pretty decent for being made fairly quickly. Fish tasted fresh but I wouldn't come here only for sushi. 

We both had the chicken, which surprisingly came with fried rice and vegetables. We were ready to order them for an additional fee, so pretty stoked to see it included. The rice was seasoned very well and was tasty! The vegetables were also good. 

I liked that it came with the normal mayo based sauce and the sweeter sauce, but the garlic butter is where it was at! Soooo good I put it on everything! There was also a garlic butter soy sauce that was also tasty. Of course I got some hot sauces too, which comprised of chili garlic paste and also Sriracha. Chicken was okay, cooked well. Portion seemed a little small compared to what I'm used to elsewhere, but still satisfying nonetheless. My sushi roll and chicken dinner came to be about $17 and change before tip. Not bad at all.

5773702,2016-05-12,3,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"I'm amazed that it took me 16 years in Vegas to find this place.

I love Teppanyaki. I used to frequent Hamada when it was on Flamingo (back when it was good), and have eaten at many teppanyaki places, Osaka, Geisha Steakhouse, Ohjah, etc, etc. This by far was my favorite experience.

They have quite an extensive menu, featuring anything from Kobe Beef to NY Strip Steak, Lobster, Scallops, Prawns, Chicken, Salmon and more. Probably more selection than other places. Prices are a little bit higher, but the quality makes it worthwhile. I opted for the Samurai 3 dinner, NY Strip and Salmon, for $33 (add $3.50 for fried rice). So not too bad.

Chef Yung (probably misspelled) was excellent. He does all the tricks with the knife and spatula, onion volcano, etc. He really stood out because he can cook!!! He took some special sauce orders and whipped them up. My salmon could have been prepared 3 different ways, I chose lemon dill and it was great! The conversation at the table also focused on Yelper's favorite subject.....other restaurants!! Tiger the owner has a couple new ones coming up. He also gave us a few to try out which of course I can't remember (thanks Sake and Sapporo). 

Overall, just a very pleasant dining experience, with good high quality food. I'll be back, and I'll be sure to highly recommend to anyone seeking good Teppanyaki.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,6,4,5,phyfPqgD5oAsjj8GsqvTCg

Doing shots, talking about his dick, and even exchanged phone numbers with those girls. Probably going to meet up later and f*** each other. I understand if you make maybe one joke or two but he made my family very uncomfortable and ownership should be embarrassed to call him a chef for this restaurant.

My step mom asked for the guy that was on tv and he treated us amazing...The entire meal was amazing.

5828152,2012-01-04,2,BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ,"I am a Las Vegas local and have eaten here at least 20 times. We ( My husband and I , sometimes with friends ) usually come here after midnight. That is our ""normal"" dinner time and just so happens to be the time of their happy hour. ( we eat teppanyaki, he occasionally gets sushi but it isn't anything super great maybe 3.5 stars for sushi )  You can get full entree stuff for lunch prices in addition to sushi and drink specials. We have experienced shitty service from the wait staff before and other times its beyond excellent. We don't come here for the wait staff though. 

FOOD:::: 
The food is a bit above average but what really makes this place is the amazing side sauces. ( request garlic butter, yum yum, & spicy yum yum for starters ) The chefs are mostly all good besides this white guy we had one time but haven't seen him again. As a frequent customer I do notice preferential treatment and nicer staff. I wouldn't say customers as new combers get poor treatment by any means... just normal.. but as frequent customers we get a little special attention. I would highly recommend coming here..

HOURS, STAFF, & POKER::: 
 In June and July when the world series of poker is happening this place often stays open till 4 or 5 am... but that doesn't happen all the time.. tonight were here and they barely let the last couple in at 2:55. It isn't unusual for them to close early if they are slow. Just call first if you are concerned. Also, if you are unhappy I highly recommend you request Tiger ( the owner, but not on football days/nights :) ) and say ""Hey, last time it wasn't that great, can you make it up for me?"" and he will be sure to get you back on track. The other chefs are great too but like I said if you didn't like it last time you should ask for the owner. We didn't like some guys at first but learned to request certain things certain ways if needed that really amped up our experience. Don't be afraid to ask for something special in a special way. 

ATMOSPHERE::: 
Some of the chef's can be very over the top with x-rated type stuff.. but we almost always sit with locals or people who frequent the place so I'm not sure if that is filtered out at other times.. the chef's appear to work off the mood. 

PRICE::

Upon arriving I had made reservations earlier today for 6:30 dinner. The lady who picked up the phone wasn't very professional, but I was able to reserve a table. By the time we had arrived no one was present at the front to welcome us to the restaurant. We had to stand by the counter waiting for someone to seat us. After a staff member finally greeted us, we told her about our reservations. She had to check if there was an open table by the kitchen after we were told through the phone that there was one available for us. She then said ""sorry your table was stolen."" We were hoping to receive maybe a discount on our order or perhaps receive free dessert for the inconvenience, but she just told us to sit anywhere and didn't even walk us to our table. 

After that rough greeting to our first time at Musashi we finally had our orders taken and we were a bummed that we couldn't have teppanyaki tonight. So we ended up ordering rolls and to our surprise they were very tasty. My personal favorite was the Party N Ur Mouth. It was a roll with deep fried banana, tuna, crab, and sweet mayo. I thought it was unusual at first but we ordered it anyway. And boy was it delicious! We had also ordered the rainbow roll and the porn star. 

Although we had received poor customer service, we surely enjoyed the food. I would definitely come back to try their teppanyaki. And maybe for more of that Party N Ur Mouth.",a9bYTRxQ31rLR6GfRE1ysQ,0,0,4,nhjnhCfoEQ5KjnAN7D92XA

The chef made each person at the table a bunch of different sauces for dipping.  There must have been about a dozen different flavors of them. He then proceeded to cook our food but not until he showed his mastery of the cutlery by tossing his knives, forks, and spatulas around with prowess of a ninja.  This went on throughout the preparation of our dinners.  He also made lots of different sauces on the grill that he used to spice our rice, meat, and veggies. 

The various meats were cooked to order and were also spiced or flavored as requested.  We all left the place with smiles on our faces and full bellies. 

We didn't have reservations but they were able to squeeze us in. So reservations are highly recommended. If they weren't able to squeeze us in it would have been a two hour wait.  There was no wait if you were there for sushi.

With that being said, he told me that it's tip pooled witch is fine. But after asking what percentage of it does he get after they split it off. He said he didn't know.... what?? How is that even possible??? So that's the owners decision on how much they get when they split. They put all the cash tips into a jar and than all credit card tips are added up and whenever the owner feels like splitting it off he does and doesn't tell them how much they made in tips pooled together at all. Doesn't give them a percentage or anything at all. How do you work like that?? He splits it off whenever he wants sometimes takes up to weeks longest this server said was a month he waited once. And he just gives them watever he wants to give them whenever we wants. Doesn't tell them how much they made nightly daily nothing. Doesn't tell them servers any numbers at all. Just pays them as they work that's all. How unfair and how honestly pathetic is that. The owner is robbing his own staff. How selfish and greedy of someone to do.

Musashi is to Benihana what Ruth's Chris is to Sizzler.

We were fortunate to have the owner as our chef. 

He gave us the standard 2 sauces a la most teppan places... then proceeded to make 3 different special sauces on the table.

We told him we liked it spicy and he brought out a special sauce from the back that he had made earlier that day. To die for.

His knifework is also no joke. He is a true showman and takes pride in his presentation, unlike so many other teppan chefs who are just trying to get through their shift. 

I highly recommend you order the Musashi Special, which is filet mignon, prawns, scallops, and a whole lobster tail, along with the usual other stuff.

A good starter appetizer (if you like spicy stuf) is the Firecracker - jalapenos stuffed with spicy tuna and cream cheese.
