However, the Jimmy John's location on Durango is by far my favorite! Their sandwiches are always fresh, fast, and delicious!!
As stated before my favorite is the #12 which is the beach club and they really are freaky fast, but to make it even better this location has a drive-thru! 
An always friendly staff, it's quick & convenient, fresh & delicious, and relatively inexpensive--a good choice overall. -B",-nz0wxpNjlNzS6ttpcXurA,3,1,4,rMxeRhkWD1zTmYGnR2Kylw

It may not seem like much, but coming from a Michigan State campus Jimmy John's (and having 3 friends that worked there), needless to say I was there often. I know mistakes are made at times, if not often, at a busy franchise like JJ's. But forgetting a simple request -  like ""can I have peppers on my #12"" - when there is a 4-1 sandwich architect-to-customer ratio, is inexcusable.

It's not as if I won't return, because Jimmy John's is Jimmy John's, am I right? But come on. The request for 'Pep' was on the receipt, I paid for it, so show me the pep! Also, I overheard a ""No, it's a #15, not 16"" from the girl behind the counter - and rookie mistakes are excusable. No problem.

Next time, put a little pep in your step, get the order right, and I'll be back more often than not.",9gf4vMja2w9dxFH0u-3W6w,1,0,2,LQBdMWdOuZdo2tAqJPUrwg

I grabbed chips and some cookies, got rang up and sat down to wait. There were about four staff members just sitting around at the tables, not doing anything. I wasn't given a bag to put all my items in so I had to carry it all out individually, which was difficult for me to get in the car with and got home to discover that my sandwich had no bean sprouts in it and no one bothered to tell me if they didn't have any or what. Very unprofessional and disappointing as the other locations I've visited were very friendly, asked questions if need be, and would at least give me a bag for my things.

I called and told them of my experience after discovering my sandwich wasn't what I usually see from other locations. They said they didn't know if I wanted bean sprouts but didn't bother asking me and that they didn't know why I wasn't given a bag. There was nothing said about correcting anything and so I told them I wouldn't be coming back and the staff really needs better training.

They're fast and very personable, joking around with me about the amount of calories in my custom sandwich but that I'd ordered it without bread. I informed them I did no bread to cut the gluten, not to save on calories, which then made sense to them.

2140241,2013-05-15,1,cjlYcqxyqRBe_w3OgasPAw,"The only better BLT than the JJBLT is your momma's. 

Crusty, crunchy french bread, a thick layer of mayo, 8 hearty slices of bacon, shredded lettuce, and tomato slices make this staple sandwich a win in my book. 

I'm normally disappointed in any sub style BLT I order because the bread overwhelms the measly portion of bacon and I feel like I'm eating a lettuce and tomato sandwich with bacon bits here and there. 

But the JJBLT is where I can get my fix without incurring grease scars from frying my own bacon (seriously, does anyone have tips not to get splatter damage on my hands and wrists?!) . 

This is not a spot to head to for a late night munchie as they unfortunately close pretty early (9pm) which is why they are docked a star. 

They do however, deliver AND have a drive through which tickles my lazy bone's fancy. You can also call ahead and have your order ready, but considering they can put your sandwich together in about 47 seconds, it's not necessary.

I work odd hours which allows me to frequent businesses during their off hours, so the times I've been here are never during lunch or dinner rushes, so I couldn't tell you how quick they are when there's more than one or two people ordering.  

The decor is standard JJ's, funny and punny placards placed all about, open and airy.  Don't leave without getting a few loafs of day old bread for $0.50.

Sliced turkey breast, crispy bacon (best I ever had!) lettuce tomato, mayo. 

Big amount of meat, and the same seasoning as capriottis almost. Why not five stars? They're sandwiches were tiny. Or maybe I'm a fatty and they just seems small? I don't know, I think they were a bit bigger than a subway six inch. 

The part that really surprised me was there service. Delivered to my work in less than six minutes?! Unbelievable. If I didn't know better I would shave thought this guy made it in his car. How do they make them so fast? I need to know their tricks.

It's free for extra mayo, onion, tomatoes, lettuce, sliced cucumber, and Dijon mustard. 

They have kettle cooked chips which are my favorite. This sandwich place is going to be my new go to pace for when I'm at work or at home feeling lazy. We all know my sandwiches at home are not as good.

I ordered a Hunter's Club thinking it would be on 9 grain bread. REAL Club sandwiches come on bread.  It came on a hard sub roll, hard as in when tapped on the table you could hear it.  When I inquired about the bread, I was told I had to ask for it.  No, I should have been asked which I preferred.  No offer to remake my sandwich.  No apologies either.  
When I  asked what the topping choices were, the guy points to a sign.  I guess he can't offer up any assistance.  I asked if they had sprouts. His answer?  ""Nope!""  
I've never been to an eating establishment that didn't have salt and pepper.  
Napkins are not given when your sandwich is done.  I guess everyone knows that you are just supposed to reach over the counter and get them yourself.  When I asked for them, the guy points to them, ""take as many as you need"".  Geeeze, don't go out of your way Skippy!
Upon entering the ""restaurant"", there is a ""booth"" to the left.  However you can't sit there because it's used as a storage area. 
Also upon entering, we noticed it was rather warm inside.  Three ladies noticed it too and left without ordering. We should have followed suit.

The J.J. Gargantuan sandwich was hefty (for most), but I finished it even though I wasn't all that hungry.  Next time I will swap out the roast beef for more smoked ham.

Overall I really like this sandwich shop, plus they are just down the street from where I typically park my car at night, so I predict that I will be back on a regular basis.

I couldn't help but notice how clean the restaurant was also.  I got my sandwich at lightning speed and sat down to eat it.   

While I was enjoying my lunch ,   I noticed there was a handicapped man trying to get in the front door.  An employee named   GEORGE ran to the front door and held it open for him to come in.   He then took the man's order from the customer side of the counter.   When the man's order was done George asked if he needed napkins things like that.   George then neatly packed the mans order in a bag and the man asked him to put the bag in the back pack that was attacked to the pack of his wheel chair scooter.   George did as the man asked him and then walked him to the front door held it open and asked the man if he needed any additional help getting to his car or anything.   I was very impressed by how nice he was to the man and above and beyond he went for him.  

Jimmy Johns makes great sandwiches and I love them.   But call it what you want its fast food.   I am not use to seeing people working in fast food acting like that.

The first time we ordered delivery, we caught then on a bad day (sort of). Placed the order online, which was great because the website was simple and easy to navigate through. Sometimes I feel it is more convenient than ordering in person and saying ""Can I get the Italian Night Club on French Bread with no tomatoes, onions and mayo. Also I would like to add extra Italian dressing and Dijon mustard..... Oh, and maybe some bacon as well. Can you also cut my sandwich in half?"" They took 20 minutes to show up at our house, which wasn't too bad. An employee even called to let me know that their driver was running late. That was nice of them. Yes, they do add delivery charges, but who doesn't nowadays? We have ordered delivery from here several times already, and they have always delivered in about 10 minutes. So, I guess they really do have ""freaky fast delivery!""

All the sandwiches I have tried have been pretty good. My favorite is the #12: Beach Club. The Italian subs are good, but could use more Italian dressing. One thing that really stood out for me was that the sandwiches are clean and hold up very well. Don't you just hate it when you are eating a sandwich and all the ingredients start falling out on the other end? I don't know how they do it, they must have magical bread or something! I have been to the restaurant a few times as well. The dining area is clean and service is fast and friendly. I prefer Jimmy John's over Subway and Quiznos for sure! Its nice to know that this is an option for delivery, since everything else is usually pizza. For the most part, they do live up to their advertisements, except they don't talk as fast. :p",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,6,4,4,xD2PSNlCY092zKOSBtVTMg
