Fish Taco's $14.95 and had absolutely no taste at all. Clearly the kitchen doesn't taste what they send out. It was very fast though ... probably microwaved. No lime/spanish seasoning/flavor what so ever. And the deciding factor? This is our second time because we thought we might have caught them on a bad day two months ago when we tried them. I used come here in the 1980's and it was always awesome and you had to wait to get in. No so anymore. Very few customers. The frozen cod called fish is flavorless as is the rice. Try Jalisco's up on Durango and near the 215. Worth the drive and has authentic flavor. They also are friendly with excellent prices far below this worn out old, canned sauce, microwave tasteless fare. Too bad. It used to be the ""gold standard"" now it's worse than Del Taco.

The owner really cares about this restaurant and his employees and it shows.  When he is there when we have visited he walks from table to table and asks how we are doing.  And most of the waiters and waitresses are very kind and your food will come out quickly after ordering.

Their complimentary chips with two different salsas and bean dip are delicious and are a perfect compliment to their amazing margaritas.

Prices are very reasonable and the food is plentiful.  Standard Mexican ""comfort"" food.  I normally get their steak and shrimp fajitas.

A nice side note... I love that this restaurant has credit card machines that go directly to your table to pay for your food - no sending the card to Siberia sometimes waiting for your slip to sign - the waiter doesn't even see your card.",WD8jE11b1jaXaGgrMM-gnQ,2,2,4,iFwPpV-kuao6HE2vrw_yzA

I've grown up (a little) now, and the scary-cow-head decor is long gone, but I still love to come here whenever Mexican food is what I'm craving. Their margaritas are seriously amazing, especially the PRICKLY PEAR, mmmm!!! A pitcher pours you like four fatty margs, and for less than $20/pitcher, that's cheap as shit for the quality and the location. Seriously, I dare you to find a better marg in Vegas. Plus, everything that I've tried on the menu has been great, from tacos and tamales, to fajitas and chile rellenos. I don't think you can possibly go wrong with any type margarita or food you may choose to order at Ricardo's. :]

...but the overweight waitress (that wasnt even my table's waitress) was such a total ***** at the register, it ruined this restaurants review.

I had a restaurant.com gift card for $25 off a $50 bill. She said It had to be over $50 and my check happened to total $49.83... She said it had to be over $50  before tax (huh? Tax on food? Guess I never payed any attention to that before). She rang me up a small drink worth about $2 but charged me $10. My new bill after my gift card now totaled $35. It's actually quite hard to spend $50 here for two people, everything is priced pretty fairly.
Also:   Literally all of the other restaurants I've used these gift cards at don't even care if you don't meet the minimum purchase requirement.
Honestly the whole gift card thing wouldn't have even bothered me if it wasn't for her absolute terrible manor how she talks to her customers.

Food portions are very good, we saved the rest of our food, and chips and dips, for later and it tasted just as good. Horchata is sweeter than most places, but with enough ice it'll be balanced.

531198,2015-01-11,1,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"On more than a few occasions, I refrained from writing a review because I didn't want to hurt a struggling new restaurant, even though I didn't have a good meal there.  You get to know the owners a bit, see how hard they're working, and you just don't have the heart to write a bad Yelp review.  Luckily for all parties involved, Ricardo's has been around for decades, which means that my little Yelp review won't make the slightest dent in their future.  But hopefully it will make a few foodies out there think twice about going.

Want good Mexican?  Don't go to Ricardo's.  First came out a giant bowl of free chips & salsas - ranchero, tomato, and some green sauce.  Red salsa was OK, green salsa was yucky, ranchero (what's in it?) was the best of the three, but that's not saying much.  Also, I have a really low salt taste, and the chips were actually under-salted to me.  I got the guacamole appetizer, which was pretty good, I guess (I haven't had guacamole in a really great Mex restaurant).  I got the Chile Colorado, short ribs cooked in red chilies, onions & spices - OK, but too salty for my low-salt-taste palate.  Unfortunately, I was burping this dish back up all the next day (sorry if that was TMI).  For dessert, crazy bananas - hot bananas cooked in caramel syrup with vanilla ice cream and chocolate (although I nixed the chocolate).  Too sweet, not great, like something you would get from TGIFriday's Mexican menu.

I have to commend Ricardo's on their service, which was absolutely first-rate.  In fact, it was so good that I held off writing this downer of a review for a few days.  I got to Ricardo's after 1 a.m., and pleasant, friendly, attentive service during graveyard shift is about as hard to find in Las Vegas as an un-augmented dancer at the Rhino.  Ricardo's clearly believes in taking care of their customers, and gotta say, the portions were very large.  Huge portions plus a great staff have kept Ricardo's going through thick & thin (and there's been plenty of thin) for over three decades.

There was a crowd out front, so I almost didn't go in, since I was traveling for business and was dining by myself.  I thought the host of people outisde indicated a queue inside for a table, but it turns out that the 'queue'  was just smokers.  Having to walk through a cloud of smoke was a bit of a turn-off, but tt is what it is and I went inside.  I was seated immediately.  They have an extensive menu.  I was waited on immediately for my beverage order.  I order a marquarita and ice water.  Margarita was very good.  They offer a small, medium and large.  Other reviews commented that their chips, beans and salsa were good.  Their chips come with a guac dip, tomato salsa and beans.  The guac dip and beans were great, but the tomato salsa was very bland; there was no flavor.  The chicken enchilada was very good in flavor.  The chicken could have been cut up a bit more; it was in big chunks.  The carnitas taco was very good.  The rice was full of vegetables - corn, which is typical for Mexican food, but it also had peas, carrots, green beans and lima beans.  I've never had Mexican rice with these vegetables in themn before and did not care for it at all.  The service was good up to the point of getting my check.  It seemed to take forever and I ended up having to ask for it.  I put a credit card in the check holder and after waiting a lengthy time, was presented with a handheld credit card machine where I had to run my own card and punch in my own tip amount and print out my own receipts.  I've utlized self-service tablets at restaurants before, but this felt like I was doing the waiter's job as this was not a true self-service tablet.

Finally the food itself was okay the chips and salsa were good and the nachos as the appetizers were good but I was really disappointed in the enchiladas I thought they would taste better then what I thought they were terrible the meat had a weird taste to it and the sauce tasted like bland nasty gravy overall did not enjoy the main course overall outside of that everything else is good and I can see myself returning again one day.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,0,0,4,6CXdPZRjTvKxElqHFogIcw

The chips and salsa were unique, they came with two sauces and a bean dip very tasty. My wife had the enchilada, Chile relleno and I had the chorizo con huevos . Both were good, the chorizo was home made and took on the look of sausage, but was tasty nun the less. The wife really enjoyed the Rellano. My only concern is the margarita we had, the wife had it on the rocks and I thought I had a blended? But it was from a slushy machine, which appears to be the trend in Las Vegas. In my opinion it was way too sour and I can only assume this is how they're made here. I will hit this place again and explore the menu but my next margarita will be on the rocks as anything but a blended drink is an affront to the margarita purist.

I haven't tried the food yet, however my friend had their Huevos Rancheros and it looked amazing!

I'm going back for my birthday next week, so hopefully they have an abundant and fresh supply of lobster... Salud!!!

First time trying this place. I've passed by the restaurant many times but never followed through with trying it. 

Overall, I'm not a fan of Mexican food. I'll take Chipotle any day and after today's meal I'm reminded why.

Not that it was bad. But definitely not worth the price. I got the shrimp and lobster enchilada and it came with beans, rice, and pico. Prior to our main meal we got chips with 3 dips (beans, green sauce salsa, and regular).

When I think lunch special, I think the meal should be below $10.00. I think my meal was the day's ""special"" but I did peruse the lunch special menu and most of the items were over $10.00. Mine came out to be $17.00 with tax and tip, ugh.

I like the setup and decor of the restaurant. It's also a cute touch that the female servers are in their outfits (sorry I don't know what their called).

No sushi, no Mediterranean, no Korean, no Greek... so we settled on Mexican.

The servers name, and I'm not kidding, was Pancho Villa. He knew that was good for a laugh. Since my friend Joe speaks Spanish we got extra good treatment. Joe had a Margarita and Deb, a beer. There I sat with my water, casually mentioning to Joe that I prefer the frozen style Margarita. He rattled something off to the server and the next thing I knew, I had a frozen Margarita in front of me. Though I don't drink much anymore, I really appreciated that one and it was very well made.

The chips were really good. Not sure if they make them on the premises but they tasted like they sure could have. I love the chips and salsa thing, even though it tends to destroy your appetite and then you have to fight to get your dinner down.

Great atmosphere, service and the food was good. It was pretty typical Americanized Mexican fare but overall, it was pretty good. It didn't feel like a chain and I'm not even sure if it is.

See why I was confused as to their overall goal? But, then they immediately served bean dip and 2 kinds of salsas with slightly stale tortilla chips....but don't worry I still ate them all. 
I ordered steak fajitas and the steak, peppers, onions, and sauteed mushrooms (?surprise!) were all very good. The condiments, tortillas, rice and beans, were only so-so. 
Overall, if you are tipsy, hungry, in the area, and its late night.... then its worth a stop-in. But, I wouldn't drive out of my way for it. 
However, I did grab a handful of Vegas mags on the way out: LV Weekly, Dine Out, Where, and CityLife..... all of which satisfied my Sunday morning coffee-reading ritual. So...thanks for that, and for my boyfriends bean-breath.",J2sXNzMZQpnAtqAgIqVVIw,1,1,3,5cHGhMCW33mX7O1pvxmyew

2087054,2015-01-07,2,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"Time to update my review since it had almost been two years since I last visited. 

Walked in on a Saturday night and it was very quiet and empty, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and we were seated promptly. There were only 4 other tables occupied. I had been craving a shrimp salad from Lindo's for the past few weeks so I was a bit upset at my husband for not wanting to take me, we were going to catch a movie at the Palms so we needed to eat at a restaurant in close proximity, boo! From what we remembered, the food and service here was good so we drove right over.

We were seated promptly but we waited a few minutes for our server to appear. My husband and I both ordered waters with lemon and a waiter brought out chips along with bean dip, red salsa, and an avocado salsa. The avocado salsa was the best, they only times I've ever seen it made are at catered parties so that was quite a treat, loved it! 

For my entree I ordered a chicken caesar salad ($10.99), they don't have a shrimp salad which was a let down for me. I asked our server if I could substitute the chicken for shrimp, he said he'd ask the chef and that he'd be right back. I knew that if he agreed I would pay a few more dollars which was fine with me. When the server came back out he said that I would have to be charged $20 for the salad if I wanted it with shrimp, I was expecting to be charged a few more dollars but not almost double, so I stuck with the chicken. My husband ordered a steak chimichanga for his entree. We didn't have to wait long for our food to come out, maybe 15 minutes tops. My salad was topped with cotija cheese which gave it a different flavor, not bad, just different. The chicken was a bit on the dry side but seasoned well, it was your average salad, decent. My husband did not like his entree very much, he said the steak was too fatty which is something he detests. Overall, we were not very pleased with our meals. It was subpar. 

Now on to the service. The server didn't even check on us once when he dropped off the food, he only came back to ask if we wanted dessert or the bill. I wanted a flan so I ordered, he came back out with the flan and bill. The flan was bland to me and it had a different texture than what I'm used to, it was not very sweet and if it had caramel, I couldn't taste it, the best part of it was the whipped cream and cherry on top. Overall we spent $28 on our meal which isn't bad but the food isn't that good anymore, I might be back, I might not, for now, I have much better options for mexican food elsewhere.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,5,4,3,eoaNJ5iw6FA6JNhalgOETw

The house entrees include refried beans-with cheese-, rice and their a version of street corn(in this case, it was sort of like creamed corn).

Last night I wasn't planning on going in, but I was in a sticky situation with some guys at the bus stop. I went in and asked Miguel the bartender if I could just sit inside for awhile since I felt unsafe. I can't say how much his kindness and thoughtfulness means to me.

They make guacamole tasteless. That is hard to do! The beans are a salty mushy baby food consistency.

2807801,2015-01-10,0,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"The good:  This is a nice space, with traditional Mexican restaurant decor (of the American-touristy variety), high ceilings, and a huge frosted glass skylight.  The service (at lunch on a Friday) was quick, friendly, and attentive.  The margaritas were well-made and reasonably priced.  The chips were fresh and hot, and came with three kinds of salsa - all good.

The bad:  Most of the food was over-spiced, dry, or both.  I'll give them a pass on my food, because I had the lunch buffet.  The buffet was pretty much indistinguishable from the Mexican station at any hotel buffet.  But my wife's combination meal off the menu was pretty much the same.  She also ordered some cheese-only nachos, which had obviously spent too much time under the broiler and tasted burnt. 

We will give Ricardo's another chance, but for now I can't say that this is the ""treasure"" of a Mexican restaurant that we always hope to find when we try a new one.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,3,W9sxwi955L63ZM07ss49XQ
2824385,2016-10-18,0,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,I have to say that I don't like to give bad reviews unless it totally warrants it. This is one of those cases. I went there with my four daughters. None of us enjoyed our food. My Twins both ordered Carne Asad a burritos. They each had about two bites saying that it didn't taste anything like Carne Asad a. One of my girls actually took the side of beans next to the burrito and put it in a tortilla and ate that instead if her $13 burrito. My oldest daughter got a ck chimichanga.  I mean how hard is it to mess that up. She ate about 4 bites of it. My other daughter got the enchilada suiza which is the same thing I got. It had ck machaca in it and sour cream. The ck was cold and had a horrible flavor. I NEVER complain to an establishment I normally just leave and never go back. I had to in this case say something. They sent the manager over. Her name was Soraya.  She was not accommodating at all. I have to say I wasn't asking for a discount but when the entire table doesn't eat or take their food home maybe you should discount down the bill. Just my thought. After I spoke to the manager our server who was really cool at first became really short with us and him and the other servers gathered and I'm sure discussed that I had complained. Thanks for making it completely uncomfortable. I ended up paying $86 for the meal and I still tipped the server 25%. I will definitely never go back and tell all of my friends and family to stay far away from this establishment.

First we walked in and weren't offered a seat or menus, we eventually figured out that we had to do that ourselves. At the end He was taking so long to pick up my card to pay, so I walked over to the bar myself to save him a trip back and forth and me some time as well. He took forever even noticing that I was standing at the bar waiting for him to run my card. When he finally took my card he asked me if it was mine...?! He then ran it in front of me and asked for my pin which then prompted me to give a tip amount... Now this is when it got uncomfortable. I asked that he not run it as debit and instead run it as credit to print out the receipt so that I may take it back to my table to figure out the tip in private and not while he stood there rudely staring at me. He then got upset when he canceled the transaction and tried to do it again but the machine died which pissed him off further... While being flustered he completely forgot to run it as credit again and made the same mistake AGAIN and when I tried to point it out to him he began screaming and telling me to put the tip amount and that it was supposed to be a simple thing. Pretty much embarrassing me at the bar and telling me to just put 0 for his tip... I explained that I wasn't trying to not tip him and that I just felt uncomfortable doing it that way. 

I myself was a server and know that I would never put down the bill in front of someone and ask that they put the tip amount down while I starred them down. He would have gotten a tip had he not yelled and embarrassed me for HIS NEGLIGENCE.",nDEUdSzCtrzxr6YoqY7IIQ,1,0,1,jy96PMNXBggqzgfOpyPjqw

2927335,2011-02-14,1,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"I've come here twice already. The first night I came it was for a late night eat. This place is open from 11am - 6am, so it was perfect after a night of partying. 

We were seated and given chips, 3 different types of salsa, and water right away. The chips were very warm and fresh, which was surprising considering it was 2am.

I opted for the Tostada Fiesta without sour cream (9.95) and my boyfriend got sirloin steak fajitas (14.95). It came within 10 minutes and boy did it look yummy! We both took a bite and it tasted just as good. The portions were very big, so we weren't able to finish, but we had some awesome leftovers. 

I highly recommend this place for late night dining. It's very mellow since there aren't many people dining and the lights are dimmed a bit to give it a romantic/relaxing mood. 

The second time we came here, it was for the $10 taco buffet. We found out about the it the first time we were here because the waitress suggested it. 

The place was a little more poppin' this time since it was around lunchtime and I'm sure there's a lot of regulars that enjoy the buffet. We were seated and given chips and salsa right away. Pretty awesome considering we were paying for the buffet and we still got complimentary chips n salsa. I also ordered a cherry coke and the waitress brought it with a couple maraschino cherries in the cup, which was a tasty little treat. 

We headed down the steps and to the buffet. It was rather small, but it had all the necessities to get your tummy to grow twice its size. There were tacos, chile relleno, enchiladas, rice, beans, fresh guacamole, salsas, carnitas, carne asada, shredded pollo, and even tostada bowls to make your own crazy concoctions, 

We both put as much food on our plates as we could possibly fit. We just wanted to make sure we tried everything and we sure did. Needless to say, by the end of our meals we were extremely full and very satisfied. The quality of the food was great, especially for the low price that you pay. 

I'd definitely come back again. You get the most bang for you buck with the buffet, but if you want a nice low key dining experience then come here for a late night dine.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,2,2,4,0sv3X0JA7DlWUSjnEH2BzQ

We were not rude, or demanding... we actually were being so patient.

So here's what happened and why he became upset, and left for long periods of time. He came back to finally take our order. We were ALL ready and knew what we wanted. And right as my friend started to put his order in another friend interrupting and said ""can we also get more cheese dip"" as he really liked it. The waiter was stunned by that and then just walked away. I tried stopping him so we could put our full orders in. He just kept going. Then he didn't come back for about 15 minutes. He brought the cheese dip and then put his fingers together saying ""I'll be back un momento"". Okay. I guess. Lol. Then he was gone for a good 30 minutes. He did a Bday table and then took an order of another table who came in after us.  Asked another table next to us if they were okay. Then literally checked on every table except ours and then disappeared again. Completely ignoring us. Then a good 45 minutes into waiting. He finally came over. Said ""are you ready to order or would you like some more queso?!""  Okay!!!  Seriously. What an ass. Then our order took so long. So we got up and went to leave. Manager apologized and said she'd take care of it. They said the order was ready, but it took another 10 minutes. Lol. It wasn't even ready. We ended up leaving and didn't even get to eat. And the girl refilling our water and chips wasn't friendly at all. And ONLY one of us at the table voted for Trump. And that was Mr Queso. But don't punish the rest of us Gringos. So racist.

The good: the relleno and enchilada(cheese) were good, not excellent, but above average.
The bad: the taco...I requested a hard shell taco with shredded beef. This is where authenticity comes in. Mexicans will relate; a hard shell taco is a corn tortilla folded and  deep fried with the meat inside. Then the cheese, lettuce and salsa are added by the eater or cook after. What came to me was a mission tortilla hardshell. Something you get at Taco Bell and Del taco, it wasn't good. This is what we call a lazy Mexican taco. Now, they might have their reasons, but I don't think it's reason enough to offer this atrocity. The beans were bland and undercooked and the rice was salty.

I'm from a small town in Southeast Texas and even the franchise Mexican food in that area is amazing.  Still, I had made a plan with my father and sister to check out Bonito Michoacán, but when we got there, they had NO parking, in the front or back of the building.  So, we drove down Flamingo and found this restaurant and decided to give it a try instead.

Their food is pretty good.  Not amazing, but not horrible.  The jalapeno popper appetizer was my favorite item and it's served with a very sweet sauce that complimented it very well.  My chicken quesadilla was good, but my sister and dad both ordered the cheese enchilada meal and while they didn't hate it, they weren't impressed.  At one point, the manager came by our table to check on us and when we mentioned how we'd come by Ricardo's, she screwed up her face and told us that we didn't want to eat at Bonito Michoacán.  We asked her why and she couldn't give us a straight answer, just kept shaking her head and scrunching up her nose...that kinda irritated me.

My main complaint came when we received the check and I handed over my debit card to pay.  The waitress walked away and came back with a handheld device to swipe my card.  She then handed it to me to choose my tip of 10%, 15% or other and stood at our table while I chose.  I'm sorry, but I like to take my time on calculating a tip and I definitely didn't appreciate having to rush through it while she watched me.

The buffet provided small tortillas for street tacos as well as hard shell tacos. There was also beans, rice and enchiladas.
The enchiladas we're not that great, the sauce was too sweet. Additionally, there was not sufficient enchiladas for our party of 8, as well as the small tortillas for tacos. There was no one tending to the buffet to restock items such as the enchiladas and tortillas for at least 20 minutes which made it a huge inconvenience. You'd think they would have staff on hand to make sure nothing was missing from the buffet to meet demand.

3113596,2012-06-13,0,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"This family-owned and operated fine Mexican restaurant was first established in 1979, with more than one location, but now has only this one place, on the NW corner of Flamingo at Decatur.

The food is terrific, the service is superb, and the live entertainment (when they have it) reminds you of an old-style Mexican cantina.

I dine there as often as I can, and it's a 10-mile trip in one direction, but well worth it.

They have been voted the #1 Mexican restaurant (in the Las Vegas Review-Journal poll) for 22 years, since first making that prestigious list in 1983, 29 years ago.

On October 19, 2010, Ricardo's Mexican Restaurant and ROSANGEL Tequila broke the Guinness World Record for ""World's Biggest Pink Margarita.""  In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month, ROSANGEL, the world's premier hibiscus-infused tequila, gave the Margarita a pink hue.  A portion of the event's proceeds benefitted Susan G. Komen for the Cure® of Southern Nevada.

Ricardo's and ROSANGEL's new Guinness World Record for the ""World's Largest Pink Margarita"" was certified at 7,627 gallons, surpassing the previous record of 7,039 gallons.  To break this record Ricardo's used a 14 ft. tall 10 ft. wide tank, 4,600 liters of ROSANGEL Tequila (1,215 gallons), 5,000 gallons of spring water, 750 quarts of Kelly Y Gonzalez lime juice, 750 gallons of La Paz Sweet and Sour, 1,500 liters of triple sec (396 gallons), and 20 pounds of salt.  This record-breaking libation will make a total of 81,355 -12 oz. pink infused margaritas.

""There is nothing more rewarding than being able to involve one's profession with charity.  We are truly grateful to have the ability to give back and have people really enjoy themselves.  It's a mega-feat for a mega-cause,"" said Scott Schiller, brand manager for ROSANGEL.

""We are beyond excited to break the Guinness World Record for the 'World's Largest Pink Margarita',"" said Ricardo's owner, Bob Ansara. ""After over a year of planning this event it is exhilarating to make history and complete this project.  We are so grateful to celebrate 30 years of business and could not think of a better way to celebrate with our community.""

""Susan G. Komen Southern Nevada is so grateful for the generosity of Bob Ansara.  Eighteen months ago, he had this grand vision and never once lost sight of the tremendous charitable aspect of this event.  We are honored to have been chosen as the recipient of such benevolence and are truly touched by the friendships we've made,"" said Stephanie Kirby, executive director of Susan G. Komen for the Cure of Southern Nevada.

That's yet another reason why you should visit them; to claim that you've actually been to a place where a Guinness World Record was set.

The horchata is recommended and is included in the lunch buffet. Try it! It's sweet with a touch of cinnamon. I prefer it to horchata from some Mexican eateries in Los Angeles, even. When you're seated at a table, you're given tortilla chips and 3 different salsas. The salsas given with the chips are great. One is refried beans; another is avocado-based; the other is tomato-based. My favorite is the avocado-based salsa since it has great flavor and a little spice kick. The chicken tacos at the buffet were awesome. The lady assisting customers at the buffet was so friendly. There were only corn tortillas for tacos, but you can order flour tortillas at your table. I also really enjoyed the rice. It was flavorful without being too salty. The chicken chimichanga is nothing to rave about but still pretty good. For dessert, my party of 4 had split a banana foster. It was a bit too runny for my taste. I'm used to a more syrup-like consistency. Overall, I liked this place and would recommend to others.

Dirty laundry list: 
Horrible service. Not only did our waitress seem to never be around when we did see her she avoided eye contact with our table like we were Medusa or something...strange. On two of her visits to our table she made rude remarks to us! The group of people I was with was not rowdy or obnoxious so I was really surprised to have such a hormonal waitress treat us so poorly. 

The food. Let's start with the basics. Chips and salsa. Chips, no complaints. Salsa, wait, there was salsa on my table? I thought that was red water with tomato chunks floating in it? Wow. It was awful, kids. They serve chips with two salsas and beans and neither salsa worked. It needed more salt, cilantro and onion. It was like baby food level of heat. Bullshit. Next I had cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and it was just alright. Boring at best.

I bookmarked this location & have been asking my husband to bring me here for the longest time & he finally did last night. Atmosphere was nice & quiet the service was ehhh ok 
I was very very dissapointed with the food & my husband felt sick after he ate. 
When our food was brought out the plates were hot but my food wasn't as hot, that I don't like. I ordered a beef enchilada & chili relleno & was so dissapointed (I've tasted better) it was very disappointing my chili relleno was very bland no taste at all $13.00-14.00 for a 2 item combo is RIDICULOUS!! Especially because the portions are very small for the expensive price paid.
My husband ordered a chili Colorado burritos & had to pay $1.00 extra for all meat because he didn't want all the beans which he ended up getting anyway his plate was about $15.00-16.00 which is RIDICULOUS!! 
$40.00 for 2 people & I didn't even order a drink is sad. We were better off going to a little taco shop or Roberto's up the street. Very dissapointed we won't be going back",hMWX2HUTPcP7a-aFBbv-bg,1,0,1,6TQnZqEp7htpUaBGTQ08Iw

My family has been going there for  more than a decade and has followed the restaurant through it's various locations over the years. It's worth it. Hands down best mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Not only is their food top-notch, but the service is always friendly. 

When we moved here from Phoenix we missed a certain appetizer our old Mexican restaurant offered (melted cheese and mushrooms inside a warm tortilla). While Ricardo's doesn't offer this dish, they're still willing to make it when we ask every time we come in, providing a little taste of home in the big city.

My #1 recommendation - The margaritas are superb. Order the largest one they have (we affectionately call it ""the trough"" in my family). Also, paying the extra for top shelf tequila is definitely worth it. You won't regret it.

I sat at the bar for a few minutes the bartender manny or Manuel arrived and I ordered a margarita. I asked for it to be put into a pint glass instead of their maragarita glass(as I always do) because I don't like their margarita glasses. The bartender said it would have to be charged as a large margarita?! But said he would only charge me for a small. I wasn't asking for more alcohol just a different glass. On my check I was charged for a medium margarita. I also put $20 into the gaming machine and was not comped for my one and only drink. The bartender never told me his name. I had to read it on his name tag. Btw I was the only patron in the bar. He asked me how my food was and that was it and he just sat behind the bar between tasks on his phone. I don't need to have a bartender up my ass or anything but some friendly interaction is what you'd expect. I'm mostly pissed that I've been charged more for using a different glass and wasn't comped for the only drink I got when I gambled $20. Been here many times since I was a kid and adult and this guy sucked.

I love breakfast regardless of time of day, so ordered Chorizo con Huevos & wife ordered the special Lobster seafood Enchiladas. Both orders came with rice & beans and Chorizo came with tortillas.
Chorizo was cooked the way I like & tasted ok but lacked that reddish residue oil which would have greatly improved taste & moisture? Wife's Lobster enchiladas was great. She would order same again. 
Beans were ok but better after adding some salsa. Rice was tasteless, bland & watery, like it was re-steamed? but better than dry undercooked rice like some restaurants serve. Again better when sprinkled with salsa. Flour Tortillas were wax paper like & thin similar to those low fat tortillas?

Service was great! Waiter continuously returned to check on us.

The food is ok. I do love that they give you two salsas and bean dip for your chips!!! I eat like two servings of dip on my own. Bad side is after the bean dip and chips I'm too full for my food. The flautas are good. Deep fried flour tortillas filled with chicken.

One weekend day I visited your buffet. Little did you know that was a very hard day for me. 
I had visited many times in the past. That day I came to eat because I knew I could count on it being: easy, fast, good quality and everyone in my small group of 3 people would be able to find something they liked. What I got was something more. I had been suffering from a emotional incident. As I sat there eating....trying to just get through the day. Feeling like I was all alone in the word. I was very sad and speechless. Just then I heard a sweet voice behind me  say ""I brought these for you"" as she sat down on the table a bowl of Spicy Carrots. You see there normally are spicy carrots and jalapenos on the buffet. I like to eat lots of them every time I visit the buffet. Some days I will drive out of my way....just to eat the Guacamole Salad with a plate of carrots. But, that day there were no carrots to enjoy.

4085935,2016-02-19,1,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"As a fan of Mexican food, even I'm a bit surprised I've never eaten at a Ricardo's restaurant before. 

The best thing about Ricardo's are the chips and salsa. These chips are fresh and you get three different kinds of dip. The bean dip is my personal favorite but all three were very good. 

The rest of the food is not as good as the chips unfortunately. I ordered the Carna Asada plate. I expected thinly slices carna asada, marinated in lime juices. I got a top sirloin steak that was dry. I shouldn't have to saw into my steak like a lumberjack taking down a redwood. The plate did come with a cheese enchilada, rice, and beans, which were actually good. It's possible that Ricardo's knows their meat was going to be disappointing so they throw in other food in there.

If you were thinking about the lobster flautas, you should keep looking as well. That one is disappointing as well (bland and dry), and that meal doesn't come with enchiladas or rice. Non-meat items are probably the way to go.

As for drinks, we got a small margarita. It wasn't terribly bad. Not a huge fan of margaritas in general. I tend to prefer margaritas that have some sweetness to it but the alcohol should still be tasted. This margarita was all sweetness.

It's not the worst Mexican restaurant. If you want some late night Mexican food and you rather not deal with the shadiness of Roberto's at night, this is an acceptable substitution.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,1,2,3,w8xlZeCvOJIYcxuGmt2VtQ
4108202,2018-05-04,5,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"My meal was actually going quite while until I bit into something that shouldn't have been there.

Ricardo's Mexican Restaurant proudly boasts of being established in  1979. They occupy a standalone building at the northwest corner of Flamingo and Decatur; my guess is that they've probably occupied it long before becoming part of the sprawling mess of a plaza which is now home to such businesses as Planet Fitness, Smith's, and Zero Degrees.

I went here for a group dinner event. Judging from the group menus section of the Ricardo's web site, we had the #4 option (priced at $32.95 per person, before additional costs for drinks and dessert).

Chips were the starter, and they were pretty nice with a non-spicy pico, a non-spicy refried bean dip, and a mild-medium avocado sauce - then again, when has chips and salsa not been enjoyable? This menu also came with a house salad, which was a nice treat with vinaigrette and tortilla strips. As for drinks, the small margaritas were addictively sweet and not too inebriating, and I didn't look beyond those.

I chose the Chile Colorado entree, which was tender sirloin beef cooked in red chile, onions, and various spices. The beef was good aside from some tougher, drier pieces, and the mix of flavors was delicious until the buildup of salt became an all-out assault on my palate. The refried beans, relatively mundane rice, modest helping of shredded lettuce, and puffed tortilla bowl didn't do much to distract me. I did enjoy the side of roasted, buttery corn kernels though.

Unfortunately, the salt wasn't the only issue. A little over halfway through, I bit into something far too tough, which I soon realized was the corner of a plastic bag. You can't have that kind of stuff in people's food, yo. The saving grace is that I haven't gotten nausea or diarrhea as of writing this review several hours after the meal. Even so, I'm still disgusted at how careless and unprofessional the kitchen staff are.

By the way, I picked flan out of the dessert options. It was pretty boring.

I can't see myself going back to Ricardo's despite enjoying large parts of my meal. I have experienced similar or superior quality cooking at sit-down Mexican restaurants all over town, and those places didn't include inedible items.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,5,2,afp7zkKfXjaY8o2F_b8qow

Two of us ordered carnitas tacos - it was dry, hard strips of meat (not shredded or cubed), more like leftover from the fajitas, with a teaspoon of diced onion, but NO cheese, no salsa, no tomato, no lettuce, that's it.  Tasteless, hard meat.  Two of them.  The beans were fine, but it's hard to screw those up, as was the rice. 

One person had enchiladas, very average enchiladas with very little filling and a whole lot of sauce on top!  Nothing to make your belly smile, that's for sure. 

Another person had the tortilla soup -- and there was NO CHICKEN, but loads of celery!!  Must've been cheap that day . . . it was more of a veggie loaded soup with chicken broth.  

Another person had the meatball soup (not sure what the proper Mexica name is), but there were TWO tiny meat balls.  That's it.  And a whole lot of dark broth.   

I LOVE chips n salsa -- they also had a bean dip and green salsa, all were pretty good, not the best ever, but enough to have me optimistic about my meal.  The chips were the kind I like, crispy, corny with just enough salt.  It is because of the chips n salsa that this is a 2-star (and not a 1-star) visit.  

The place was pretty busy for lunch, but most dined at the buffet.  Perhaps that's your best bet.  They do make some nice sized margaritas, but we didn't have any this trip.

A good friend was visiting from out of town, so we got together for dinner, with a few other friends. There was a large party- maybe Graduation or a wedding, we weren't sure- but it was buffet style. There was entertainment in two forms- (1) a singer who looked like he was from the wild west or was it mariachi-like? It was black- had adornments all throughout- what do you think? (2) a balloon twister animal shaper maker- ok, I don't know what the exact term is, sorry- but anyway, he made some pretty neat shapes for the kids. 

Salsa and chips were very good- we needed more. Refills on water took forever. Our food took a while too, come to think of it. I had the fish tacos, which was good, not great, but good. I don't know if the poor service was because of the large party, but it could've been better. The tables were all occupied, where we were seated. So, it was busy all around. The bill was pretty good for our group of five, so the prices were not bad.

I would be willing to try it again. Maybe it was an off night.

We were greeted promptly by the friendly staff. I have to give some credit to our waitress as our group had two english only speakers, one spanish only speaker, someone who was bilingual and a child. Our waitress was able to easily switch back and forth between english and spanish to assist us. 
The salsa has definitely improved since our last visit. The medium was really chunky and the mild had much more flavor. The chips really are incredible here...probably the best I've had it town. Very crunchy, a bit oily but they are also very large. 
I had the taco salad. Its more of a hard shelled burrito than a salad. There is lettuce, but there are more beans and cheese than lettuce. The salad also has guacamole, salsa, sour cream and olives. I had without the meat, but you can get the meat on it. The portion was huge. After indulging in chips and salsa, I maybe conquered half of it. 
This place does have a roving magician/balloon animal artist. He was a little less aggressive than others I've seen, which was nice.

I went last week for the first time for my boyfriend's parents' anniversary. We got to the dinner 20 minutes later than the rest of the party, but our orders were taken promptly and we were served almost immediately after. Great service =)

They do give chips, guacamole (GOOD guacamole) and dips before the entrees. I ordered the Chicken Ranchero and my boyfriend got a Mexican pizza. The portions are big, chicken was juicy, sauces and spices are bold and give lots of flavor to the dishes. Mucho bueno. It was enough to pack up and have for another two meals. 

Real authentic and delicious meals. I love having multiple little dips and plates of different options in front of me (which is probably why I love AYCE sushi and Korean BBQ so much too.)

We started with an appetizer combo plate, which was very good.  For the main course, I ordered Carne Asada, medium rare.  At other Mexican restaurants, this steak has an inimitable flavor. It came out of the kitchen fully well-done, and the only flavor I tasted was salt.  By this time, I was full enough from the appetizers that I just sipped my margarita and didn't have them replace it.

The main reason for the single star is how tue staff treated a 12 year old girl.  When asking for a kids menu for her the waiter actually asked ""are you serious"". He then leaves the table and comes back a few minutes later and ask if we're ready to order. Mind you he did not bring a kids menu. He was reminded that we had asked for one and he actually said "" I thought you were joking"". A couple minutes later this old biddy comes by with what looked to be a kids menu and says with a real snarky attitude ""children's menus are for 10 and under"". She the proceeds to snidely comment at the child ""you're a big girl now"".  Some people you just want to smack. But seriously, what's the big deal, she's a picky eater that doesn't eat much. So instead she was forced to order a full meal which she maybe ate 30% of. What a waste of food not to mention money.

4684360,2013-07-06,0,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"Was looking for a decent Mexican restaurant off the strip and came across this little gem. I'll break down this review based off of the items I had to eat & drink.

Chips: Were super crisp fresh and delicious.  I found these chips much better than the average fair you find at a Mexican restaurant.

Salsa: They give you three different dips to try.  The bean dip is out of this world delicious, like others have mentioned it is really good.  The green salsa was more of a light Avocado salsa and had a nice flavor and just enough heat. The tomato red salsa was bland and watery with no flavor at all.  Was really disappointed with the red salsa compared to how good the others were.  

Cheese Enchilada: Probably one of the BEST I've had in quite awhile. The sauce had a rich deep flavor and the spices were balanced well. The tortilla was not soggy and filled with delicious gooey cheeses. 

Chicken Taco: The chicken was very flavorful although the tortilla was a little on the stale side.  The toppings were good but very minimal.  

Beans & Rice: One word OUTSTANDING! Really creamy beans that had a nice texture and the rice had some great flavor with the traditional peas in the rice.

Margarita: Had a Mango Margarita and it was average to good.  Nothing to special but nothing bad either.  

Overall a great experience with a very friendly staff.  ""Freddie"" was a great waiter who was super attentive and funny.  Well be back!",_TcrcoVvfSz8T0xkEIYT7w,1,0,4,NV2rshvsUbD1toFrwhtayg

4760981,2015-05-22,5,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"Pretty irritated with some of these down right RIDICULOUS reviews such as Rudy's.  Get it together people, complaining about SALT on chips!  I mean seriously?  Ricardo's is making chips for a mass of people, NOT YOU SPECIFICALLY RUDY!  I assure you, there is salt on the table.  Here is an idea, pick it up and use it!  ""Here's your sign.""

Now for my positive review.  Ricardo's did a downright amazing job catering my husband and I's wedding.  Every single one of out 120+ guests loved the food and I am sure many will be revisiting the restaurant.  I didn't hear one complaint and everyone left fat and sassy.  The drinks and service were unsurpassed and management was involved in every single step of the way...free of charge.  

I have been going to Ricardo's since I was a kid....20+ years.  The owner and his wife work Friday and Saturday and they know you by name and always have a smile on their face.  This is a touch of special for me, they are a great pair.

They have delicious food that I cannot seem to get out of my head.  The chicken Ricardo's is my favorite and melts in your mouth.

As for those chips and salsa you some ding-dongs seem to be complaining about.  Why are you complaining when you have a selection of three sauces?  You don't like one, here's an idea, try the other.  Most restaurants offer one selection and that's it.  What's the mean?  You don't like it and you are stuck.

Ricardo's is one of my favorite spots for drinks and chips/salsa. Service is great, the bussers, runners, servers and bartenders are nice people. I believe it's a family run business and it feels that way.

Their margaritas are some of my favorites in Vegas. The bartenders have made some custom margs when requested that I and my guests have enjoyed.

Their green salsa is one of my favorite salsas of all time. I don't eat the bean dip, but it's usually good when I try it. The red is acceptable, but that green salsa is amazing.",AF66rgcCDT_aSdv3tHoOXg,0,0,5,NbB0DyYA_0FVOk55IZTW5Q

My husband has lived here for 20 years, but I've recently moved from California, which is where we would usually indulge.  After driving by this place for the last several years, we finally decided to give it a try, having friends with us from out of town who were craving some tacos and margaritas.  
The ambience is great, the service is really good, and the food was better than we expected.  My husband and I shared the chicken & shrimp fajitas, with were extremely generous.  Our kids and friends were happy with their entrees, as well.  The adults each had margaritas, which they offer in different sizes, and kids had Shirley Temples & Rob Roy's... very fancy!  
With their chips, they serve a few different types of salsa and warm pinto beans.  Their entrees are appropriately priced for the large portion you get.  We managed to save room for dessert, and ordered deep fried ice cream and flan.  SOOOO GOOD!  
On the evening we dined there, they had a magician roaming around to entertain the diners.  Initially, we were a bit put off, but he was so entertaining that we asked for his business card before he left.  
They are usually pretty busy around dinner time, so keep that in mind if you are hungry and don't want to wait.  So far, we haven't had any problem getting seated right away, but you never know.  It's not too far off the strip, so you can easily take a cab without having to pay for a drive clear across town.

Our Margaritas were wonderful in taste and GIGANTIC in size; dinner dishes were absolutely delicious and sufficient in quantity. We also loved its warm and crispy tortilla chips, as well as the two different salsas and bean paste! The HOT version of salsa could have been a touch spicier, though.

- The hostess and waiting staff (waitress and the one who brought out chips and water) were friendly and efficient. Our waitress was also quite helpful in offering her recommendations and explanations of house specialties.

- The restaurant is huge and its Mexican decor tasteful and inviting. Some quarters can be very nice for private groups. Yes, it has a nice, intimate bar area, but one can have HH anywhere in the dining room, too, besides its bar. We will definitely go back to Ricardo's again!

5093431,2013-10-22,0,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"I classify Mexican food into two categories: ""Tex-Mex"" and ""Authentic Mexican"". I usually don't eat Authentic Mexican food unless I'm in Mexico, New Mexico, East Los Angeles, or Texas. 
I've been to this place a few times in the past usually between 11AM and 3PM, but I woke up at 7AM this morning with a craving for Tex-Mex, so I went there at 8AM because they're open 24hr/day. 
I really didn't know what to expect at that hour (maybe they only served Mexican omelets or huevos rancheros, etc.), but it turned out that they offered the regular full menu.
I got the combination plate, which is usually what I get if I go to Cabo's or Garduno's, but I'd have to say that Ricardo's was better than the two aforementioned restaurants.
I can't explain how it was better, but there was something in the seasoning that reminded me of the food in Mexico. The rice was very soft and the refried beans had no lumps of beans, both of which I liked very much and is not the case with other restaurants.
There was only one man there, who acted as host and server, and he treated me like family. He even said, ""Would you like chips and salsa, or is it too early?"", which I thought was very efficient, and it would be the same thing that I would say at 8AM (of course I answered, ""Absolutely"").
I drink a lot of iced tea, and after I downed the first glass in 60 seconds, he put a carafe of it on my table, which is what I would do as well (I ended up drinking two carafes). 
I wish that I brought my i-phone so I could've taken a picture of the combination plate, because the taco shell was not a regular taco shell, but more like a tortilla that was deep-fried. They also took the stem off of the chili relleno, which again, I thought was great, and I can't remember any other restaurant doing that.
I told the waiter exactly what I just wrote, and he was very gracious and said that he would relay my sentiment to the chef. He also mentioned that they get all their ingredients from California, which made sense.
I don't know what more I can say. It was very, very good.

We were staying on the strip and in need of a quick lunch. I remembered Jessie B's buffet find of the week, and I had my husband sold at buff... 

The restaurant is big and clean. We were seated promptly, and from there, it was all corn tortillas and smiles. First, I was actually impressed that they still bring out a basket of chips, two salsas and bean dip when you are going for the buffet. I half expected them to withhold these treats from the gluttonous buffet eaters! 

The buffet offers cheese enchiladas ready to snap up, or they will roll you up beef or chicken with either a red or green sauce on top. For the tacos, they have small, corn tortillas that they double up and fill with carne asada, chicken or ground beef, plus cilantro and onions. You can also get a crispy taco shell. Then there is a little fixins bar with pico, guac, lettuce, cheese, jalapenos, and so on. My only complaint is that perhaps the food could have been a tad warmer, but everything tasted great, especially for a $9.99 buffet! I was actually very impressed with the guacamole. You can tell from the partially smashed avocados that it is made fresh. I actually went back just for a plate of it and some pico. I am a lady who loves her vegetables. 

Equally impressive was the service. You generally don't expect much service at a buffet, but our water glasses were never less than half empty! That alone is better than most of the magic tricks in Vegas, and they have a table side credit card machine, which is an unexpected, but appreciated convenience.

We finally decided on Ricardo's, which I'd never had.  

Walking in, the inside is a little run down, and shabby.  Its a little on the dark side, and each booth in the bar area we were seated in had a TV IN the booth.  I don't like this...If I wanted to watch TV, I'd sit at the bar.  

We got there in time for happy hour, and so I had a ""small"" regular margarita for $4.50.  
This wasn't small!  I'm glad I only got the small, because it was so big I couldn't finish it.  This was my favorite part of the evening.  It was a good, strong margarita, and I'd go back for happy hour just to have a couple of these, for sure.  

For dinner, I ordered the nachos, no meat (also on the happy hour menu: $7).  
Morgan had the combo carnitas taco and shredded beef enchilada, served with rice and beans. 

Meh. 

The portions were enormous.  I ate a ton of food, and it looked like I didn't touch my nachos.  The waitress actually came over and said ""You didn't like them?""  No...there's just WAY too much food on the plate!  They tasted ok, but I've had better at Qdoba. 

Morgan wasn't impressed with his, either.  The enchilada was good, but we make better at home.  The carnitas taco was bland.  

Service was awkward too...our waitress was nice, but had 0 personality.  She disappeared at random times, and the checked on us twice within about 3 minutes...space it out! Its ok to let us eat for a minute.  Really.

I had no idea this place was open until 6AM! I thought it was a restaurant-lunch-dinner type place- but no, not only do they serve food all night- but they have a bar and gaming open as well. And can I just say that the set up is pretty sweet, comfortable, chairs and booths plenty of room. This was my second time grabbin a bite at Ricardo's. The first time I fell in love with their mini rolled taquitos (chicken) which were meant to be an appetizer but the plate was so big it was the only plate I had- it was the only plate I NEEDED. YUMMY. The second time I had PORK ENCHILADAS- on the menu it states the flavor is AMAZING.. I dont know about amazing but it was very good! Once again the proportions were huge and I barely got through half the plate. 

Chips, salsa, and bean dip were delicious as well! I was impressed :D This place is a little pricey($11-15$ per plate) but I believe well worth the price.",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,0,0,4,9mc6o87ZTXp9GFP7sz9yig

So, after some quick research, yelp reminded me that Ricardo's is 24 hours.  It's been a long while since we've ate there because we're quite fond on Bonito Michoacan, but at midnight their doors were already long closed.   The first thing we noticed was that their prices are quite high when compared to similar restaurants in the area.  Being quite hungry, I ordered one of the steaks that was described like adabada style seasoning.  I was really disappointed; it tasted so bad I didn't finish it and I didn't desire a doggy bag to save it.  I just had them toss it out.  Bf ordered the Huevos Rancheros and said it was just OK.

5507977,2016-01-21,0,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"Since I have a taste for menudo, the wife always searches out places that 1) have it and 2) are good at it. This is the place. I CANNOT stress how wonderful the menudo at Ricardo's is. 
We went right around lunch and the peak of the rush was over, so we were seated right away. The place is decked out like many other Mexican places. Stucco and color are the deals of the day. Nothing overly done, but certainly not bare. Sacramento was our server and he was awesome. The timing on our food was spot on and he kept checking to make sure we were good to go.

As this was a menudo recon mission, I ordered the bowl of menudo and then went with a Colorado Burrito plate. Wife had the Chili Rellenos (and a taste of my menudo). The menudo was wonderful. The broth was rich and loaded with taste. Just enough hominy. The tripe was not that spongey smooth tripe you normally get, but honeycomb! It is served with lime, oregano, red pepper flakes and cilantro. Did I mention how wonderful it is? It is by far, bar none, absolutely the best menudo I have ever had (from FL to CA, MI to TX). It tastes almost like they have vats of it brewing away in the back all the time. So rich and delicious.
 
The Colorado Burrito was good, but after the bowl of menudo (did I mention how great it was?), I could do no more than taste it. The sauce was rich and worked well with the meat, but seemed a bit on the small side. The beans and rice were plain and portions were small. Overall the plate was ""OK"". Other than portion size, I really had no issues. The wife's Chili Rellenos were good. She told me they were done VERY well. The creams and toppings played right to the chili's and she thoroughly enjoyed it. In her case, she could eat half and take the rest home (to be honest, I took most of my burrito home - due to the menudofest). 

Overall, we have now found our go-to place for menudo (sorry, Stations). I am less concerned with the rest of the menu items. They all look good and if they are like what we had, they will satisfy and please. BUT, this is THE place for menudo. Do yourself a favor and try it out.

The atmosphere is inviting and cultural, with a comfortable vibe and color everywhere. The booth we were at even had its own little television to watch! I really like the decoration of the place, it definitely invites you into the experience.

Unfortunately, the food was bland at best. The bean dip with chips was okay, but the two other sides of what I thought was salsa and spicy salsa were too watered down and bland. Even the chips themselves didn't have any real kick or substance to them. I ordered the plan bean burrito, in which the rice was very bland and a little mushy. The burrito itself was nothing exciting, and I only ended up finishing half of my meal (and not taking the rest of it home with me).

My boyfriend ended up finding a long, thick black hair in his food. We immediately told the bus boy, and while it took the manager a good minute to head over to our table, she was nice enough on removing the item from the bill. Our server also gave us a free margarita in place of it. While having a taste of the margarita (and minding they made that margarita kick!), their server either forgot to card him or felt obligated to get him his drink for free. Either way, there is absolutely no reason why he shouldn't have asked for ID in a town like this. That automatically wanted me to drop this review down to a one star.

My conclusion is this place draws you in with the decor and beauty of the atmosphere, but it doesn't make up for the food. Ricardo's has a lot of potential if they offered new menu items if they decided to revamp what they already have with more flavor.

It kind of reminds me of the American style Mexican food of El Torito's from back in the day.

I decided to get the steak fajitas and my Mom decided on a combination plate that included an enchilada, taco and chile relleno. The taco was horrible, she took two bites and was done with it, the enchilada was sad however she liked the chile relleno.

I enjoyed the chips and dips they bring out to enjoy prior to your meal being served.

My iced tea was good and I like that they give you a carafe so that you can refill yourself, maybe because the food is a bit dry?

My steak fajitas was not that great, dry and almost too much of that charred burnt taste as I think they really let them sizzle for way to long prior to serving them. The rice and beans were bland and cold. 

I really wanted to like Ricardo's more than I did and it was actually disappointing to say the least.

Well I can scratch this restaurant off my list for places to try and revisit. 

It was my birthday, not sure how they found out but they did bring me a tasty piece of complimentary flan with a candle and sung to me. However as sweet as that was, it was not enough to salvage the poor quality of fake Mexican/Spanish food they serve.

When the complimentary chips and dip is better than the meal, that is not a good sign!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,3,0,2,VvK9z7zA6JNya8mXepOCEA

the chips- tasteless
the sauces for them- watery/bland and the bean one looked like it had been sitting out since new years.
taco- vile, stringy, old
beans- prison slop ""goop/sledge""
rice- microwave 4 day old soggy and hard in others
steak- grilled unseasoned 
even the tortilla were hard....
absolutely vile- avoid at all costs....

(and fyi the service sucked.)",7jrhS2KtnpBfewdn1mNFzw,1,1,1,hUrEfMaVHuf-2K4qDei6nA

Unfortunately, my appetite didn't cooperate and I only had room for an entree. The seafood enchiladas were good, but lacked seasoning. There was plenty of fish and less shrimp, but both needed some flavor. I dumped the salsa from our chips 'n salsa on the enchiladas to add that flavor. I also asked for some hot salsa and got a fruit based hot salsa which was very good. The rice was not the traditional Mexican rice I'm used to, it was white rice and was probably better. 

I liked the ambiance of the bar/dining room where we ate. They have cool globe lights on the ceiling and the backdrop of the bar is very inviting. I had a prickly pear margarita which I think is hard to find around here and it was very good!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,2,1,4,IPVL326tmRAigse9joAg2g

5941775,2016-10-03,3,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"Touristy. Service was OK, but their food is probably the worst Mexican food we've ever had in Vegas. Ingredients are not fresh. Any other hole-in-the-wall we've tried has turned out to be better than Ricardo's -- a lot of other places won't charge you an arm & a leg, too.",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,5,4,2,piBEVie8BWMCW0Bi9mTbGA

5960121,2011-06-08,2,SEjyjYlMfFFzkHaru6JadA,"More of the same from this place, I'm afraid. The food has gotten more and more bland over the years. There really isn't anything I love on the menu and the only thing I kind of like here is the Ricardo's chicken, which is definitely a little overpriced. There are plenty of items that are ok, but just ok. Nothing amazing.

The service is great and there is no shortage of people to refill your glass or take your order. That's a plus. I really want to love this place. The atmosphere is nice and it's still a great location for large parties with the expansive space they have and plenty of private areas, but the food just gets in the way of me loving this place. If you do come, I highly recommend their lunch buffet. Great deal, for what you get.

If the food was better, this place would be heaven.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,3,3,3uQ2OM-HVDxZJjoIYpOk1g
