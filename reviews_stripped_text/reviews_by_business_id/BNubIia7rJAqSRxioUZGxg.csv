Went in around 1:35pm and decided to get a ""buffet lunch"" for $6.99
Big mistake.... meat was almost all gone except few slices of beef floating with overcooked broccoli. Rice was dry, noodles were barely warm... 

I asked a waiter if they are going to have anymore fresh items brought out and he unapologetically stated that it is late and that's all they have. With that I paid my bill and literally ran out of the place without leaving a tip.

There was a group of us and we ordered several items and shared.  We ordered the spicy calamari and it was delicious.  It is unique--chunks of soft, breaded calamari tossed with green peppers, fresh jalapeno, and cilantro with a thai dipping sauce.  It wasn't rubbery rings like at many (typically Italian) restaurants.  

The vegetable egg rolls and chicken satay were also really good.  If you've never had Thai Iced Tea I recommend theirs, but if you order soda they continually refill it.

The entrees we ordered were green curry chicken (level 7 of heat), vegetable chow mein, chili mint beef (level 5 heat), and chicken pad thai.  Everything was so good.  I think the level 5 heat for chili mint was surprisingly spicy while the level 7 curry wasn't quite as spicy as I expected, but everything was delicious.  If you don't like spicy food, there are still plenty of options (the satay, pad thai, chow mein we had, for example).  We had plenty of leftovers to take home as well. 

The restaurant is clean but a little dull, but they offer a take out option.  Can't say enough good things about this place.",nlBvzDyLMzwSZQ6O8GhuIg,2,0,5,XbdIRP1uzrHn32hKzOB2-w

Calamari, beef jerky, crab rangoon.
 Calamari was chewy. Beef jerky tasted like....... Jerky. The crab rangoons were ok.... Just sad that they use imitation crab.

I'm having a yen ta fo with duck ( #43)

 #70 spicy catfish. For the man.

The catfish actually looked like it came from a fish... Big meaty pieces in the stew. It comes with a large silver tin of stramed rice.

My pho was good. The cabbage kind of over whelmed it, and consumed most of the bowl. It was rather salty for my taste....

The atmosphere here is odd. I know that it is family run and all.... But our waitress was on her laptop, or watching the very loud tv.....our meal was $55...

2338812,2011-03-13,1,BNubIia7rJAqSRxioUZGxg,"I love this place! 

It's always busy here during the week between 11am and 1pm and the restaurant is quite small so there's not a lot of seating. A lot of military personnel frequent this place for lunch because it's not too far from Nellis AFB and the prices are very reasonable whether you're getting the buffet or ordering from the menu. You can order any of their food To-Go, including the buffet but it costs $1 more than if you were to just sit down and eat the buffet. If you order anything from the menu To-Go, it only takes a few minutes and the food comes out fresh.

They also offer delivery, but only within a 3 mile radius and there is a $3 delivery charge. 

I'm always greeted as soon as I walk in, even when the restaurant is packed. The servers/cashiers are always the same (which makes me think this place must be family owned) and they're all super friendly. 

The menu is easy to read and understand, so even if you don't know anything about Thai food, you can easily get by! This isn't one of those restaurants with a menu that is solely in a foreign language. Each item has a description underneath so you know what you're ordering.

I've eaten the lunch buffet once and it was decent, probably only worth 3 stars. But every other time I've been here I just order from the menu (definitely worth 5 stars) because it usually only takes a few extra minutes for the food to come out. 

The prices for the House Specials are about the same as the buffet, unless you're ordering a dish with shrimp in it then it's about a dollar more. The food always comes out freshly prepared and piping hot, and all the House Specials come with a large pot of rice. 

The Thai Iced Tea is so addicting. I don't usually even like tea, but every time I come here I get the Thai tea with cream and I always want more.

Oh and just a side note, I love that I can request for any dish to be spicy and they actually make it SPICY! I'm usually asked, ""How spicy on a scale from 1 to 10?"" I tell them ""8 or 9"" and it comes out exactly how I want it every time. 

This place has never let me down. It's definitely one of my favorite lunch spots.",FycUYNTz4fswU8PE62Ybtg,2,1,5,y-QpXYYBpSsVu0E9hbSPcQ
2409077,2013-07-07,0,BNubIia7rJAqSRxioUZGxg,"So there I was on Yelp! Looking for a Thai lunch buffet in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, none of the reviews I read had a lunch buffet. After searching through the 11 or 12 Thai Restaurant reviews in Las Vegas I stumbled on the picture of Lao Thai Kitchen [It reads ""Lunch Buffet"" under its name].

The lunch buffet starts on Monday - Saturday from 11:00AM - 2:00PM.
Pro's:
1) All of the food was very fresh (even though we arrived at 1:35PM the food was still very good).
2) Plenty of Available seating. Of course, this could be because we arrived at 1:35PM...
3) Five or six servers means fast service.
4) Several Thai dishes to choose from including soups and desert.
5) Servers were very friendly

Con's
1) I recommend arriving for the lunch buffet anytime before 1:30PM because, by the time we arrived, the servers were basically done serving. However, we still received drinks.
2) The distance from the strip or downtown Las Vegas to Lao Thai Kitchen keeps this spot a local secret.

So now your probably wondering why I gave Lao Thai Kitchen 5 stars. When I eat a buffet I am basically eating for quantity and not quality, here the quality far surpasses the quantity. Give it a try, I definitely recommend the lunch buffet at Lao Thai Kitchen.",PxhAaIaM_VmcUSTQqG5OWA,10,1,5,Skp5LFypB-TQH59axq4BSg

Nothing is labeled. But I recognized some dishes. Green and red curry, garlic green beans, tempura sweet potato & plantains, fried drumettes, and a noodle dish I'm calling classy top ramen. All were great!

Other things I tried: pad thai, 2 meat dishes, spicy beef salad, soup, egg rolls? These were good. I was excited because it was the first time in 14 years that they had a separate platter with mung beans, cabbage, cilantro and limes!!! But the pad thai was not hot, so it is something I will try off the menu at some point.

There was other things I did not try. There were 2 other noodle dishes, fried rice, 2 other salads, a dessert? And 2 other soups.

Service was great. I did order Orange chicken for takeout. Hubby said it was good, and he ate the whole thing.

2621859,2010-10-19,0,BNubIia7rJAqSRxioUZGxg,"I've driven by this place on a number of occasions while heading to Thai Cuisine.  We always joke about the front decor being Native American with eagles.  At a closer glance though, the wooden ""tee-pees"" are just ornaments that are supposed to look like Chinese roofs. We bypassed the lunch buffet in favor of dishes from the menu: chicken fried rice, pad see ew, and roast duck curry.  I also tried the Thai iced tea, which was pretty good.  It was moderately sweet, and creamy.

I wasn't a big fan of the fried rice.  It was less greasy than your average Chinese fried rice, but it was rather salty for my taste.  The onions were way too strong (I prefer sweeter onions in fried rice).  It also was just a little more greasy than the better fried rices that I have had at other Thai restaurants.  

The pad see ew was good, or at least comparable to most other decent Thai restaurants in town. The one complaint I had was that the Chinese broccoli was sliced very thinly, and had the taste fried out of it.  My friend thought that the broccoli might have been a little bit off, but I didn't taste any more bitterness than average.  

The roast duck curry was standard, but didn't shine.  It had small chunks of duck, and was nice and soupy.  I would say that the curry here is about average as far as flavor goes, but at least it wasn't overly sweet.  The duck seemed to be prepared well.

Although we didn't try it, the buffet looked decent, at least much better than the LoS buffet.  There were a wide variety of dishes available.  During lunch the place was quite busy, with dishes constantly being replaced as we ate, which is a good sign that the buffet is at least partially fresh during lunch.

 When you tell them you want a 10 out of 10 for heat, they'll really give you a ten. in fact, if they know you (like us), they might even ask if you wanna go higher (too high for the average non-Thai person, which is why they stop at 10 to begin with). 
 I also love their Thai Iced Tea, which is hard to mess up, since I think it comes in powdered form and you just add milk.

3388178,2012-10-08,0,BNubIia7rJAqSRxioUZGxg,"An excellent small, family-owned business.

1. The food is authentic, consistent, and well-priced.

2. The service is excellent. I noted someone else had also commented that as you come through the door, they say 'Hi' to you - yes, they do, and it's a very endearing welcome that starts off the visit well.

3. We have eaten here about 20-22 times over the past few years. It is definitely consistent in its food and service. While not perfect, yes, admittedly, the decor is at certain places in the small restaurant ragged and questionable in it's relativity to a restaurant, it is everything good about a 'hole-in-the-wall' place one could ever hope for. 

4. The buffet - unusual for such a small place - is a nice bonus. And if they run low on an item as lunch time passes because they have an actual lunch rush-hour, and they do, - ask them to cook some more - and they cook up some more. That is exactly how a small, family-owned business that offers a nice little buffet works. 

5. Aside from the buffet, the individual entrees are very good. It may not be exciting or clever to state this but it is that simple.

6. As for the pricing, it is inexpensive, and because the portion size is good, there is generally some leftovers to take home. I like the fact that their menu doesn't change every few months - with the often corrolating increase in dish price. Even during the recent economic slump, they maintained a quality effort.

It's really a hidden gem.

They have such a huge variety of Laos and Thai dishes. 

The best part is that everything is good!

I can honestly say I've tried just about everything.

They have curries, soups, noodles, stir frys.

My favorite thing is that everything is served family style so the portions are large, the prices are low, and it's easy to share.

It's family owned and they're all so nice.

The food comes out pretty fast.

Just some side notes: it's in an older plaza, but it's very sanitary.

They also have a weekend buffet for 7.99. I've never had it but my family chooses that at times. I've seen the buffet and there's a big variety of dishes.



Try these out:

Issan sausage with sticky rice. At home version has more fat, but they serve theirs with traditional dipping sauce.
Pad Thai. Their pad Thai is hands down my favorite in town and I've tried a lot! Theirs is very saucy. I know it's one of those dishes that is different every where you go. This one is my favorite.
Tom Kha Gai. It's coconut milk and galanga root soup. I get it with chicken. 
For dessert get the coconut ice cream in a coconut! It's so good! Their are palm nuts and sticky rice in it.

Just about every dish is under $10.

I ordered crispy calamari and I got a burnt squid! You can actually smell the burnt food when they put the plate on the table. Their orange chicken is sooo sweet like they marinated in sugar and cooked in sugar and orange juice. The barbeque chicken is dry. The only good food in our order was the fried fish but then it is the most expensive in the menu so it better be good. The serving portions are ok. I will not go back here again.",LiNCDonaTMeE2Ig50dvIpQ,0,0,2,RHKB1Qsj-3pQWGJrh2ktyw
4259527,2012-12-20,2,BNubIia7rJAqSRxioUZGxg,"I used to really love the Bankok Boom's lunch buffet (ok, this was years ago). Then I tried Lotus of Siam's lunch buffet which was even tastier (and don't forget all the accolades too), except that is only available monday-friday. I haven't had it in years now, since I work monday through friday- day shift. So, my sister told me about this place- said it was ""small, but good,"" I looked up reviews and decided on this place to celebrate my birthday with my side if the family. We were able to enjoy it on a saturday (the day after my actual birthday). When we reached the place, I recognized it, but it had been years and back then it was just a thai restaurant, not laos also- think 90s college days with one of my college friends (a longtime friend, she ended up being one of my bridesmaids BTW). 

My favorite thing here was the spring rolls with vermicelli noodles- let's just say, I had more than one. So very good- my BIL really liked them and asked if they were handmade from scratch. I had the pad thai- a basic thai dish, pretty good, ground chicken dishes- one of them was way on the salty side- even my mom noticed and said the same thing, beef with broccoli, beef salad (except the beef part was a little lacking), and I'm sure I'm forgetting some other dishes. I went back a few times, but it's not like there were any buttons popping. (The first few years of living here taught me to not overdo it a buffet.) Pretty good for $6.95 a pop. My sister's oldest really liked the chicken wings- fried. My husband liked the soup- there were several choices. Thai Tea comes in 3 sizes- small, medium or large.

Sure, the area is a little questionable, and it's a hole-in-the-wall- some reviewers here refer to it like it's a bad thing (large parties sit in the middle, while the booths are on each side of the walls). But the food was pretty good, and where we were sitting, we could see when the new steaming hot food was placed in the serving trays. Some items went fast! There was a decent crowd. 

I'd come back again. I don't really have thai food a lot, because my husband really fancies chinese food (had lots of it in my hometown, SF). Maybe on a half-day, I'll check out Lotus of Siam again since it's on my side of town.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,3,2,4,MMoJwJKwYDWQ6vFvc5qmmA

I was craving papaya salad and decided to give it another try.  Ordered chicken pad thai and lao papaya salad to go.  The pad thai BARELY had any chicken, it was like a cup of ramen vegetables to noodles ratio.  The noodles were dry and a bit bland.  I was hoping the papaya salad would save the meal, but it didn't.. The papaya was not ripe enough and was hard to chew.  I asked for a 5/10, and I could taste the spice, but lacked the other flavors I was looking for.  I'm used to Lao papaya salad with cherry tomatoes, the crab paste, fish sauce, chilies, and lime that packs a punch with orgasmic flavors.  

Lesson learned, always buy papaya salad from the Laos Market.  They never disappoint!",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,4,2,2,AuMHSTZVkXrXbq3kHeglog

We also tried thier Tempura appatizer. It is yummy but they bread the shrimp instead of dipping it in the same batter as the Veggies which I didn't like.
The only other problem I have with this place is their menu! Take the time to update the prices people! A lot of their items have gone up $1-$2. This isn't a huge deal but it is annoying!",Tj2jOc_Q3lwbT7uiBHZsig,0,0,3,M_b12m3iBbGjvNPZRM6gMQ

Here's what we had:
Thai sausage - these sausages were very different from your usual sausages.  It reminds me of homemade sausages.  
Roasted duck curry - very delicious duck meat and the curry is full of flavors.  
Pad kapow with chicken - this was also very flavorful, but it was not as good as the duck curry. 
the pad jew noodles - thai soup noodles with shrimps, squids, char sui (bbq pork), and napa cabbage.  It was as close to the actual thai soup noodles I had in Thailand.  
~One thing I should mention is that our food wasn't spicy enough.  We ordered 8 out of 10, but it was still lacking some spiciness.~

They also had mango with sticky rice, but we'd have to wait 15 minutes for the rice so didn't end up getting it.  Definitely will come back to try it. 

The service is also very friendly.  Overall, Lao Thai Kitchen offers home-cooking flavors in a friendly atmosphere at a reasonable price!  This is going to become our regular dinner spot! 

p.s. they offer lunch buffet from 11am to 2pm, Monday thru Saturday.  Will and must come back to try it!",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,2,1,4,aSAXLv7KqPDeha8ES3IdQg

Have spent a good amount of time in the Issan region of Thailand, the food up there is more Lao influenced than Thai, and have spent some time in Laos.  The food here, to me, is as closer to what you get over there than any other place I've eaten at here in the States. Took an expat friend who spent 15 years in Laos back in the 1960's and he concurred on the food here.

Can't beat the lunch buffet. I head first for a bowl of tom yum soup and then for a big helping of Lop Mu with cabbage on the side.

Just wish they could find a new source of Beer Lao, miss having it with my Lao food.",YNV_Iw6FY4EdkzSfsP20UQ,2,0,5,D4gg8mN2a2lmp9gvz-80bQ

Arrived at a real hole in the wall restaurant, meaning lots of holes in the couch and chairs. Absolutely not trying to fix the restaurant at all. Holes all over the place.

Try the lunch buffet. Lots of varieties, all mediocres. Granted I have eaten at some of the most delicious place all over vegas, but that doesnt mean you just stir fry everything and call it a thai restaurant. Tom yam koong warm and no kicks. Pad thai doesnt even taste like pad thai. orange chicken too orangy and sweet. 

All and all, for $6.99 you get a lot for your money. But I prefer quality than quantity. Its probably good for the area, but I rather drive a little and dine at thai style noodle house in spring mountain. One and done for me.",gm20Rasn38z5xdnd7_iM4g,1,0,2,HTgUhI-USVJeQZmLjFFznw

It's a small, cute place with a really friendly staff. I believe it's a family owned restaurant, so you know the service was great.

I had the Rice Porridge which was EXCELLENT! I'm a huge fan of any Asian Rice Porridge and this was definitely up to par! I also had two other soups, I am too sure what they were but one kind of tasted like it had a lot of fish sauce or vinegar and that was really good. Then the other one was a little bitter with beef and veggies. That was excellent as well.

We ordered a few other things as well. The red curry was my boyfriend's favorite and I though it was pretty amazing (even though I hate curry), then there was the sticky rice which was great! I love rice, I cannot live without it. A salad that had muscles, I liked that and more things that I can;t even remember.

The Thai Tea was good! It came in a huge to go cup! It was really refreshing and hit the spot after a HUGE lunch meal.

I thought it was cool how they had a lunch buffet from 11am - 2pm Monday-Saturday. I wouldn't come towards the end though. As all buffets like that, they won't have too much left because it will almost be done.

Overall, I gave this place a 5 star rating for the excellent service, amazing food and refreshing drinks. Try it out and see for yourself!",pe7xOX3y1JDM3F5ym5Re0g,2,1,5,tBN0dzBkGyRfsaFJ7A3ghw

They have soda in cans but make sure your drink is always full. I told them it was my first time here. 

I regret not going in sooner. I gave it 4 stars because they dont have the fountain drink machine hooked up. I should of asked for a Thai Tea which i seen they did have, and it looked good as well.

We ordered the appetizer sampler, pad thai ( #8 spiceness) & panang curry ( #3) 
To start off, the sampler is all fried and the breading or coating they use for the chicken wings were a weird texture. The best part of it was of course the cream cheese wontons. The Pad thai was a darker color than most places but was still tasty with the distinct sweetness to pad thai. As for the panang, for a #3 spiciness ( which I usually get when I eat thai food) was a bit spicier than most. Mainly dark meat and I'm wondering if white meat is an option there. We washed it all down with a large Thai Tea in a huge cup. 

warning: I paid with my debit card and when I checked my bank statement it was charged a $1.88 more than what I signed. I called and they mentioned it was an issue they have with the credit company and should reflect the correct charge one the transaction is no longer in ""pending status"".",1pZhDrKyN9ni4oc_xrO_oQ,1,0,3,LN_jhbnN7k2UQAOlNhKTaQ

What i love about this place is that the food is served family-style. We ordered three dishes for four people, which was enough to fill us up. My friend ordered thai tea which he said had a lot of flavor and wasnt too sweet, but thai tea is too sweet for my taste. Someone else ordered coconut water fresh from a young coconut. That was tasty and under $3! 

I ordered the green curry with chicken #4 level of heat out of 10. I definitely wish i ordered it as #6 but the waitress will give you chilli powder to make it as spicy a you would like. The curry is served in a big bowl, and makes more than enough food for one. I was pleased at the amount of chicken that i was given as well. 

On the table we also had deep fried pork skin sautéed with chinese broccoli. That dish is great and should definitely be tried!

The last dish on the table with the duck curry that is in a few reviews on yelp. I would have to side with the people that enjoyed the curry. The variety of vegetables was greater than in the green curry and the duck was not at all chewy. We had it at heat #6, which was an enjoyable spiciness. 

I will be looking for a place as good in Houston.",tf3tHIA2RO-jc6fevnssUQ,1,0,5,75T48IGw0JlrlXX7jTi0qQ
