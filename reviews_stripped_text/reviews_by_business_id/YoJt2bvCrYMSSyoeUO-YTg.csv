Service pretty average as there was only 1 person working the bar. We also played pool for a bit.

Overall a pleasant experience and since it's just around the corner we will be returning.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,1,2,3,E0WCKxskg7VPJYFNH1l8tg

Clean environment, can't say anything about the guests because every one kept to themselves and that's what I like.  
The food was good for an affordable price.  The wings however were a little spicey for a mild but o well they were still good.",4O3nanG5iFHUqGTUWsUnzw,0,0,5,Cav_jEKO4X4IGOjPi0eqaA

What little service we had was lousy as bartender has attitude.  So, we'll go to Casablanca.",aLK5H1F3DxWfJQEkcxzBbA,0,0,1,nrEfYAGqgP7lNZw5S3nDyw

2833434,2013-11-07,0,YoJt2bvCrYMSSyoeUO-YTg,Small quaint little pub. The service is quick and the people are nice . Not the best sports bar as the TVs are small and the sound off . But nice place to kick it in north Vegas. The Beer is really cold and the food is good . Happy hour between 5-7 with pizzas half off.,85ftJTdgBP9K-Dmg8FhSMw,0,1,4,2U_qVikomZ8JjhlQIVB2lg
2885186,2017-09-14,0,YoJt2bvCrYMSSyoeUO-YTg,"Location is convent since I live right down the street but the past 2 times I went here, the bartender (brunette lady) always seems to be in a bad mood. Not sociable at all. I'm not asking for a conversation but she could be a little more upbeat while taking people's orders. Doesn't look like she likes her job at all. When I asked what size pizzas were on the happy hour special she rudely threw a menu at me and walked away. Took her a good 5 min to come back around even though I already knew I just wanted a pepperoni pizza to begin with. I'll drive a little further to go to a different Bar from now on.",_tXlbtyr6f8VoWOVBUzg_A,0,0,2,S0PhMxA8rhtiYvahRPg96g

Some nights are better than others depending on the crowd. But I mind my own business, come get a drink and play a little Keno. Overall, the only thing I can complain about is the music. I wish the jukebox had better selections and that they had Champagne :)",SoiacX2r2mvHqIh3GgRMUw,13,13,5,Glc59NecQPtLPe9YgAoluQ

They have pretty good slider as well, and the pool is only $5 for the hour so I definitely recommend if you are in this side of town.",kS7NvX5dw49xJvujQpL7Kw,2,1,5,VwSeD1Q8L8VJZGYK__AqoA

Our bartender was an older guy) this last time we went we had a girl bartender who would barely acknowledge us, was too busy flirting with a customer on the other side of the bar and charged us wrong.   Made us want to rethink going, or at least not go until the other bartender was there.  He makes sure to check on you, see if you're happy with you're food or if you need another drink.",FVh8pMr7eN0OOWo487Bc_Q,0,0,3,8SPaqcqdPYNIit_dD-ee4w

5644788,2015-05-18,0,YoJt2bvCrYMSSyoeUO-YTg,i had the worst experience i came to make a bet and watch the basketball game. first when i arrived the door was locked at 230 in the afternoon. so when i came in i placed my bet and ask the mellisa if i could get matches she told me that they didn't have any(which is kind of strange every pt's in the valley u have been to stay stocked)so i ask one of the people sitting at the bar so nellis stops me and yllls at me i told you that no one here has matches or a light. so i walked to the store next door and got a light.i came back only to find that the door is locked and now she will not let me in i ring the bell and no answer so i call the restaurant thinking she may be in the back comes to my surprise  she tells me she will call the police if i don't leave and she is fearful of her life. it was the worst experience i have every had and i enjoy all the pt's  in the valley this one happens to be the one close to my house i never thought i would experience any such disrespect. so i called one of the other pt's and they told me oh no the door shouldn't be locked and provided me the corporate  number so i will call to report  mellisa  i will update on the situation.,JjQPTxH9-3nn2Xrg7jZh3A,3,0,1,_kOMPDGJYjjeet1MmXvfQg
