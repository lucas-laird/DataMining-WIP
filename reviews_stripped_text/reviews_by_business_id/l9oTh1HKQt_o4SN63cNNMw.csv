There was a trainee/noob working the register which made the long seem twice as long. It was probably a good 15 minutes before we got to place our order. Pretty crappy ratio when there were only 5 drink orders ahead of us.

The sup said I'm sorry but we are out of the strawburry refresher. I asked for the Hibiscus refresher and she said I'm sorry but we are out of that as well.

Was hier besonders negativ auffällt, ist das Fehlen des üblichen WLAN, die leeren Regale der Kühltheke und das Chaos hinter dem Tresen sobald mehr als zwei Gäste zu bedienen sind. Es gibt natürlich auch keinen gemütlichen Sitzbereich und daher empfehle ich einfach diese Filiale auszulassen und die Kaffeegelüste bis zur nächsten gemütlichen SB Geschäftsstelle zurück zu stellen.",e46dzy4NoNdkWaAJbNQ1vg,0,0,2,mphXXP4ESuQncQl2gMMQNQ

   While the new Buffet grand opening in Caesar's Palace got all the press, a new Starbucks in the Augustus Tower opened without a word. To this day, Caesar's Palace is keeping their new Starbucks a secret. In a way, it is like finding Secret Pizza in the Cosmopolitan.

  On Saturday, I was exploring around Caesar's Palace when I noticed the iconic Starbucks logo near the elevator bank. I decided on the spot to try it.

  This is a busy Starbucks.  Obviously people who stay in the Augustus Tower enjoy Starbucks. What stood out in my mind is that the seating is a large two sided couch. It is interesting seeing strangers sitting on a couch drinking coffee. On both sides of the couch are wall paintings that celebrate Las Vegas. I said that Starbucks is a corporate chameleon. I uploaded a picture of ""Welcome to Starbucks"" on a copy of the ""Welcome to Las Vegas"" sign. One side of the couch faces the hallway of the Augustus Tower, which could be interesting people watching. The other side faces the counter. At the counter, the baristas were friendly.  Near the counter was a constant line.

   Where the Augustus Tower Starbucks is low on seating capacity, it is high on price. This is the Strip after all.

   As I said Starbucks is a chameleon. I am optimistic that they will change the personality of future stores to fit into other places.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,3,2,3,xwgldFn01TLfrLZ1Zvgd1A

This is a much less crowded, lower priced option vs the Starbucks right in the Casino at Caesar's. If you're staying in the hotel, make the walk to get your coffee here.  In the mornings, it's filled with workers, very few hotel guests. It's always easy to get a seat.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  We came here most mornings on our recent stay.  Even came in the afternoon a couple of times.  Just a great place to get a beverage or a bite to eat...at a normal price point!",s6F579ooLepPTV1OJjJ2YA,1,0,5,cH9xV42Icb237nhuVGGTkQ

Honestly you go in here to get your favorite Starbucks drink and already mopping the floors not even a ""hey it's wet watch your step"". Continue to be attended by a blind bat who can't even read an order or even hear if for that matter. Really I needed to repeat my drink order twice. Then the black chick making the drink mentions not even a thank you or gives me a straw. Like honestly speaking a simple ""here you go enjoy"" won't kill you. Then the last idiot in there cleaning the windows doesn't say excuse me and proceeds to pass by me. Honestly these people need to get fired or move to a Starbucks in Montana where the population is the deer. Absolutely horrible service!

Not this Starbucks: Quality is lower than usual and when I mentioned this to the staff they asked me for my receipt which I didn't have because I paid with my Starbucks Gold Card. Without a receipt, they refused to help me. When I wanted to speak to the store manager they said that he is in a meeting and I have to come back 15 minutes later. When I came back 20 minutes later, the manager had vanished already and could be found nowhere. I was sent to a different Starbucks store to speak to a manager there which I didn't do because I had to catch a flight. When I arrived home, I talked to the official (and professional) Starbucks hotline who agreed that this behavior is unacceptable.
