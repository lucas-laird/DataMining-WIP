1086348,2017-01-22,0,BrvDRqQkoFG3B7szaZsRtg,"WARNING!! DO NOT COME HERE!!!! I am forced to give one star but really they should not have any star. First off, we walked in and he asks how many people? We said party of 7. He sits us down and 5 minutes later he asks us if we were with the reserved party of 100. No we were not, so he sits us in a back room where he said it was private. His private room consisted of leftover back seat booth facing the window of random strangers walking by. All facing one way. Not really working if we are sharing food. He didn't want to bring us any chairs either. Ok we were trying to work with him. Skipped that. The old table cloth looks used with stains. Let's move on and ignore that. 
I ordered a sprite. 

And when I got my drink there was a BUG in it!!!! Called the waiter to replace my drink. And the group was fed up we got up and asked if we had to pay for 3 other drinks that did not have bugs in it. They charged us for 4 drinks including the bug drink. No one even touched their cup either. We asked why we're we charged for the bug drink? The owner says ""show me the bug"", the waitress said she had dumped out the drink and confirmed there was a bug in it. Owner ""no show me the bug!"" 

Over $2.50 we paid for the bug drink. Before he murdered us. I'm pretty sure his food and drinks were just as dirty as his personality.",CUra5ICIGcdlWGFK-pMOYw,8,0,1,TVW8AeY44dNJncCdi_i9Rg

1568963,2017-10-09,1,BrvDRqQkoFG3B7szaZsRtg,"Very shocked with the low reviews. Been coming here for quite some time now.  Don't let the name fool you. This place doesn't just serve crawfish... nor is it your typical Cajun ""hot n juicy"" type of place. It's so much more! 

They have tables -- where you can order seafood by the pound -- or you can do the steam pot! The food here is always fresh! Been here for the ""order by the pound"" only once -- and I can say that the shrimp is So fresh! None of that mushy stuff you get at other places. The sauce is a little bit on the sweeter side, but coupled with some lemons -- the shrimp by the pound was finger licking good! The seafood is served in a bag, so expect to get a little dirty. Don't worry, they provide bibs! I hadn't tried any of the other items by the pound - since the all you can eat steam pot is a better deal for my appetite -- but the shrimp quality, I did try, is better than any other places including Boiling Crab and Hot N Juicy. (Definitely not the small cheap shrimps) 

Now on to the steam pot. I have LITERALLY eaten the steam pot more than 20 times... Food is always on point since We cook it ourselves. First you pick the congee base you would like to eat at the end of your meal. Congee is a rice porridge with what ever ingredients you want. We always opt for the pumpkin and pork ribs (extra pumpkin). Then you order the meat and veggies you want. There's a variety of items including but not limited to: cabbage, corn, wild yams (my favorite), emoki mushrooms, shrimp, lamb, beef, fish balls, squid, shrimp balls, pumpkin, taro, and a lot of other goodies. The menu tells you how long each item should steam for so don't worry if you're not familiar of how long to cook an item. Steam pot is all you eat for only $22.99. And when you cook your food -- the drippings from the meat and veggies goes into the congee -- and at the end of the meal -- it's literally heaven in your mouth. Not only that - since everything is steamed... ITS SUPER HEALTHY! 

There's a sauce station now (wasn't there before). The BEST sauce for the meat and veggies includes a TON of garlic and onions with their special soy sauce. (Its worth it - even if you're going to garlicky for 2 days - trust me)

There was only 1 time, where we had a problem with service. But after addressing the issue - that was quickly fixed and never had a problem since.  Alan, one of the owners, is always so friendly and helpful!  He is always offering a free soda or a free homemade bun (not on the menu).... Because we are regulars - he makes sure that we are taken care of. 

Honestly, for $22.99 it's a steal. Come hungry. And ask your server to make the sauce for you -- tell them you want the original sauce they use to make -- and the server will know what you're talking about. Make sure to use the garlic/onion sauce in your congee afterwards. The congee is bland and tasteless (since there is no seasoning) this sauce will make you come back for more again and again. Plus - don't forget how healthy everything is! NO SEASONING. NO MSG.",DC9yjg6hluUKtBdmvVWiVg,0,0,5,pAWHoFTFLXr5NKU9EmYDXg
2150804,2017-02-16,0,BrvDRqQkoFG3B7szaZsRtg,"We saw a sign outside the Chinatown Plaza Mall for All-You-Can-Eat Steam Pot for $22.95 (dinner) and decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did!

You can choose one of 3 types of congee or bone broth. We opted for the bone broth & our server put 3 rib bones, carrots, and corn in the base of the steamer and covered it with the steaming plate.

Then you choose seafood, meat, and veggies that you want. We got clams, house-made fish balls & shrimp balls, fish, shrimp, lamb, beef, corn, enoki mushrooms, and a vegetable combo (sweet potato, pumpkin, taro, and can't remember the rest).

They bring out the various seafood, meat, and veggie dishes, place different items on the steam plate, put the lid on, and set a timer. When it is done, you take the food off & start eating...and she sets new items down and starts the process all over again.

They start you off with a dipping sauce with garlic, greens onion, some kind of soy type sauce and maybe a little sesame oil (my best educated guess of its ingredients). We were also offered a chili paste from Taiwan & Siracha. We REALLY liked the flavor of the chili paste.

Once we got to the end, we opted for another round of their awesomely fresh shrimp balls, blue crab, Napa cabbage, and beef. After all that was cooked and we didn't want to any more items, she took the steam plate off and served us the bone broth that had been created by the steaming of our dinner.

She offered us soy sauce to add (for additional flavor and salt), but we decided to enjoy it salt free. It was a nice end to a good meal.

If you like Hot Pot, then I think you will enjoy this, too. And if you aren't familiar with Chinese Hot Pot, give this a try anyway. They do the work & all you have to do is eat and enjoy. We will definitely be back.",OcpxS8U7evLWyfw1K2pwng,0,1,4,U5XB1Onv3xJNxBUXvW-dNw
2470702,2017-04-11,0,BrvDRqQkoFG3B7szaZsRtg,"I go to this restaurant on each Saturday and Sunday from March to now. I choose the steam pot for it is all you can eat. The lunch price for all you can eat is $19. The food here is very fresh, no matter meat or seafood or veggie. Everytime I was here, I always invited my friends with me and they all like the food very much. It's very healthy and the most delicious part is the porridge under the pot. This is the only restaurant who has steam pot in Vegas. Even in Los Angeles, there is no similar restaurant. Also the date tea here is very good too for it is not so sweet for Chinese and good taste.

In my pics I have visually shown the process used to prepare your food. For the all you can eat there is a limited selection but it definitely enough. My favorite was the head on shrimp. It was so sweet! I didn't even dip it into the sauce. It needed nothing but those natural flavor. 

About the sauce, I am not a soy sauce con osier and often find it too salty; however, this soy sauce based dipping sauce is not overly salty. I enjoyed it. I did need a little Diet Coke to go with it. 

I could sit and eat the shrimp, mussels, clams, and squid non-stop. The surprise, is the rice soup at the end. It is sublime!

2639407,2017-02-01,7,BrvDRqQkoFG3B7szaZsRtg,"It's the New Year and my Father saw a promo ad in the Korean newspaper about this new place. We haven't dined out in a long time due to my Father's health condition and for him to even mention wanting to try a new place.. gave me something to look forward to. 

Their promo consist of 20% off every order with your choice of FREE lb. of Mussels or Clams or a $5 Food Credit. Sounds like a great deal, but ended up dealing with a lot of bullshit.

I made reservations thinking it would be packed and all, but when we walked in, nobody was dining there except for the owner's friends and family doing hot pot with 15+ people.

I told our server, Ting that we had reservations, but she didn't care to listen. We ordered 1 lb. of Sausage, Mussels, Shrimp, Clam, and Crawfish in Garlic Butter. Also a side of Sweet Potato Fries, Corn, and Potato. 

EVERYTHING we ordered was beyond salty, except for the Shrimp. We did mention this to the server, Ting, but again, she didn't care for it and just said oh. It was also lacking flavor and to add being way too salty. It ruined our appetites. We asked for steamed rice to perhaps help with this overflow of salt. That didn't help. We finished the rice, sweet potato fries, and even the potato, because that salt taste was unbearable to even enjoy one bite! I had to order for some Raspberry Iced Tea to help me through all this. That was gone in a few gulps. We couldn't take it anymore and had to stop. Even mentioning how salty it was to the server, Ting she gave a ""oh well"" face.

I asked for the check and the promo wasn't included. I explained to Ting that we saw a promo in the Korean newspaper for 20% off that was good until February, The server, Ting didn't seem to eager to correct this and asked us if we had the gift card. I said that promo never mentioned anything that we had to have a gift card to receive this promo special. Ting said they only do that if you have the gift card. I told her that's the reason why we came here to try this place out, because of the ad you placed in the newspaper. After much arguing back and forth, she told us to wait and went back to the cashier to talk to the manager. Before the server, Ting walked away I mentioned on the check it states free refill for the Raspberry Iced Tea. She said yea? I told her I had my drink cup empty seconds after I received it and you walked by maybe once and didn't even bother offering refills. The server, Ting then asked, so you want a refill? I'm like YEAAAAAaaa?!!?!!!! I get free refills riight??? Ting said, okay. 

Throughout this whole experience, it has been pulling teeth to get her attention to our table, AKA the ONLY table that was there besides the owner's hot pot table of 15+ people. How could you possibly get shitty service without the place being even busy?! Well folks, it can and it did. I even asked what happened to the Sausage order? The server, Ting said oh you want to order that? I said no I already ordered that and I'm asked you what happened to my order? Ting said, I didn't know you ordered that? You want to order it? I told her to make sure to take that out of the check and cancel the order. We were already done, why would I want to order that again when I'm thinking it's going to come out anytime soon?! Nope, I fooled myself silly thinking she put that order in and then tell me I didn't order that?! Even my Family said that's the first thing you ordered!!!!?!?!! *sigh This place sucks balls. 

The server came back and told us she was able to take off 20% this time, but next time we have to have the gift card that says 20% off. And again, I explained to her, that the ad in the newspaper only stated that this place has a promo grand opening special for the whole month of January and states it ends in February with no indication of having to have a gift card to get this special promo deal. All the server, Ting said was.. yeah well you have to have the gift card.

We left this place with all the salty bags of seafood and not so happy tummies. First and last time trying this place. After coming home and reading the ad again, we weren't even honored with a Free lb. of Mussels or Clams, which we ordered both! If you're going to advertise to bring people in, make sure you honor what you're offering in your ad. That isn't the proper way to do business giving some guests this promo special without even mentioning any ad or having a gift card while other guests that told you about your ad in the newspaper, but don't even honor the full promo special that was mentioned! Now that's some bullshit.

The only thing ""Spicy"" that got me steaming is the upset of false advertisement from this place!!! 

I'll stick to Hot N Juicy Crawfish, even though their service wasn't so great the last time I went. At least their food makes up for it!!!",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,10,3,1,XwBYEhJRvTCPgkECaFkK-w

When we finished those we sat there for a while waiting, nobody came back to check on us. We had to flag down a server several times to ask about the rest of our food, got the same answer every time saying that they'll go inside and check. They never came back each time. I got upset, went to the owner and told him what was going on. He said, ""sorry about that""  and its because it's busy. I told him they could at least refill my water which has been empty for an hour and bring us the some of our items which was mainly just raw vegetables. It shouldn't take an hour to do that. But it did take another half hour. We heard the table next to us complaining also, so knew it wasn't just us. Customers that were leaving we heard him say thank you and follow up with, ""sorry about that.""  Heard him say ""sorry about that"" to several other customers. He should rename this place ""sorry about that"" After finish eating, there's the rice soup at the end. We spent so much time there and didn't want to be there a minute longer, so we asked him to take it to go and give us the check. He said ""ok ok"". Came back with take out bowls and the check. I looked at the check and saw an extra $2.50 charge on there for rice soup, asked what that was for. He said since we wanted to take it to go he has to charge for the take out containers. I wanted to chuck the hot soup into his fat face. Instead of trying to compensate us for the terrible experience, he wanted to charge us extra. I have never spent this much time eating at a restaurant ever. Got there around 6:30pm, left at 9:20pm. What a waste of time.",sbmg4w4jXcqoGJkIMv9MdQ,2,0,1,xktUqC3oDkxFYSHm-Givgg

Service
Let's be real, my expectation was not that high since this place is in the heart of Chinatown.. LOL.. Still the servers here managed to fall below the very very little bar I set. The chitchat between servers were very loud, one of the servers kept mentioning how hungry she was and wished there was bread. Then another server dropped the string of a tea bag into the cup and used a pair of chopsticks for our raw food to pick it out. They were friendly, just really untrained servers... 

Food
Expectation:  pick your congee base, then pick your food to be steamed on top of the congee while ""steamed juice"" drips down to flavor your congee. 
Reality: The steam lid is lifted as soon as things are cooked so nothing is actually cooked long enough for flavor to come out. At the end of the meal congee is pretty much tasteless. Dipping sauce is basically soy sauce with scallions, jalapeno pepper, and a ton of garlic. From your veges to fish to beef, everything taste the same when its done. 
Kudos to the interesting concept but this dry hotpot does not actually work. But I would agree it's pretty healthy since you are just steaming everything. 

Price
All you can eat steam pot $22.95 with a good selection of seafood and protein. The usual market price items are ordered separately.",0JBzrP9RikxtYy-Z4SpLJQ,5,2,2,W48jJFm_eC6ulzFHIOXQJA

5429104,2016-12-28,0,BrvDRqQkoFG3B7szaZsRtg,"Came here for dinner with another couch surfer using the promo card of a few pound of mussels or clams and 20% off. I'm not sure how they are making money like this though. Maybe it's just to get their name out? 

We received a free pound of mussels with garlic butter and ordered a pound of crawfish in mild cajun sauce with corn and a side of fish filet without fries. The crawfish was frozen because there's no season for it? This was our first crawfish experience and boy is it a lot of work to eat to get so little out of it! I still prefer shrimp. As for describing the taste of crawfish, it's sort of like shrimp and lobster but not to the point I would crave for it. Both sauces for the seafood were good but I wasn't too impressed. Maybe I just don't fancy this type of food? As for the fish filet, it was crispy and came with tartar sauce but I used the sauce from the seafood instead. It got a tad too salty with the sauce though so I had quick dips instead and eventually stopped using sauce. I'm not sure how I felt about the quality of fish.  

The customer service was good, the restaurant was clean and spacious.",UKU5x7fgNWzzdpCh3PqS0A,2,1,3,MsEyomjFC9L4Yyr_mwt3bA

Came to Chinatown for some vegetarian dishes in Chinese style but could not find any available.  So we ended up dining here for oysters for two days.  Tried them in raw and steamed.  Loved oysters.  Also lessons learned.  I guess oysters are kind of ""cold"" or ""cool"" in Chinese Medicines, so next time we need to ask for some ginger or curry or pepper spices to remove the ""cold"" element in order to better enjoy the food here.  Will come back when in the area.",050B4UdCndUTDYrVBrVofw,0,0,5,PuZpJN1jZwYLkFaPp5gwlQ

We brought some new friends who just came from Guangdong province of China and even they said this was relatively new in China.  We all enjoyed thoroughly the ultra fresh and gorgeously picked out seafood they had for us and I must say this is a hidden gem that I encourage everyone to try asap before they raise the prices.  And oh,  by the way,  the service that I see so many decry here,  I found to be ok.  Go and try it and I believe you will all agree this is a great place for dinner!",5LgPA0DqQzGso79Pry30Jw,0,0,5,Cr26CtefSH3Omf9CvONSzw
