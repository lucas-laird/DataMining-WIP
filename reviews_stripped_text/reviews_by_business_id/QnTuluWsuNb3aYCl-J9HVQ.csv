He remembers who you are and what you drink. If he is not pouring a drink he is talking to you or cleaning. Always on the move. Josh is your neighborhood jokester. If you are having a bad day, see josh and you will leave in laughter. Ginger is amazing. Not only is she beautiful but she is a great bartender as well. She is quick witted and will keep you on your toes. Ryan is quite and makes you feel at home. If you ever get hungry, you will eat well and have the best bar food in town. Nick is a chef and could easily work the strip but would rather bring that quality and passion to your local watering hole.

1209797,2017-06-20,0,QnTuluWsuNb3aYCl-J9HVQ,"We stumbled across this place on accident.  We were looking for dinner but when we went in, it looked like a bar without food.  The signs say that they are under construction so maybe they are building a proper dining area but for now it was just basically some table and chairs on the side.  We almost walked out but are so glad that we stayed.  The bartender came over and she was awesome.   I wish I had gotten her name to give the proper thanks.  The menu was what you would expect - wings, pizza, burgers, quesadillas but the food was way better than we expected.  The steak quesadillas surprised me the most.  The steak was easy to chew and perfectly proportioned to the cheese.  Hubby had the wings and ended up ordering more to go. 
 The wings are fried, sauced, grilled then sauced again which is the perfect way to make wings! 
 We had two of the burgers, one with fries and one with onion rings.  I'm not a big ring fan but I highly suggest you try them here.  There was only one dessert on the menu so we gave it a go.  If you like cookie dough then this is the bomb.  I don't remember what it was called but it was basically cookie dough and melted chocolate inside an eggroll and served with ice cream.  It was way too much for two of us to eat so make sure to share.  We rounded off the night with some darts and a little video poker.  The only downsides were the missing tips on the darts they provide, the lack of a recognizable dining area which I believe they are working on and the pictures that are posted on yelp of the food (I didn't take pictures but what we were served was way better looking than what is posted).",pZ0Wo2SEQBmLY40alBDPTg,3,1,5,3e1dQmPQkFhazeSjS81rKg

The decor is really nice inside, crystal chandeliers, leather seats and such. There is a huge big screen tv off to the side.  The vibe inside was cool, and the music was loud. No complaints from me! Football was on at the time we were there. My friend ordered Chicken fingers , and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Fries (w/no cheese sauce). They were excellent. Enough for at least two people. I thought it was really nice that the cook came out and asked how everything was. I could tell that he takes pride in his work. Anyways the food is great and we will be going back. Our sever was nice as well :)",pUyU6DsygUY51l5k1R1jLA,2,5,4,R02dv2TgP7QJyrubu0AOlg

So far we have only had the pulled pork tacos, fries, and pizza but it has all been really good. I could truly eat the pizza at least once a week... I also hear the wings are really good. You can really see the sense of pride in the new owners. the owners son is in charge of the kitchen and he is doing an amazing job with quality ingredients. We also had a chance to meet the owner who is plugging a lot of money into the place to clean it up and fancy it up a bit. He was very nice and bought us a shot of his favorite whiskey, which was a nice touch, making us feel welcome. We have also had interactions with 2 bartenders; josh and Caleb ( I think was his name)...both were fun and totally engaging, which makes losing on the machines a little less painful! Overall we are so pleased, and now we are just waiting and hoping... please stay this way! Stay consistent and we will be loyal!!",yTirpcbzvPtK5pCni5Op3Q,0,0,4,ljHhTrZd1TqgjyA-glRRQQ

I told my mom about this place and she kind of looked at the place weird from the outside kind of like ""ummm where are you taking me?!"" But I told her don't fear it's got great reviews! Lol definitely all the rave :) The inside is quite inviting for a bar! I love it and the staff was so nice and friendly! 

As locals we just wanted a nice lunch to enjoy outside of the strip. I'm glad we found this place! Golden Knights Fans + Pool + Darts + Great burgers!? Why wouldn't you come here??? 

My mom and I had some bomb burgers and the pickles came sliced on the side which I thought was great because I'm allergic to pickles anyway but it's nice they give that option! I had an Always Sunny burger with an egg on top and the bacon was CRISPY!!!! I LOVE CRISPY ASS BACON!!! :D we also had the dessert too....omg cookie dough goodness. The happy hour was reasonable too....

Obviously were not coming back anytime soon (insert sarcasm lol) if you're looking for a great local bar just to enjoy a nice lunch or maybe even catch some games....this is the place to go....

Also, the ladies room was so nice!!! Usually bar restrooms are meh...but this was well taken care of and pretty nice!

So affordable and we'd gladly paid more because of the wonderful quality of the pizza. We paid $50 the extra was a tip because our waitress was literally AWESOME and their whole staff was so friendly and kind! The Benders brought it as always!
