No one greeted me even though there were two behind the counter. When I couldn't find the bagel chips, I approached the counter and asked the girl at the counter if they were still selling them. She looked up from her phone like I was bothering her and said, ""we ran out of containers,"" and returned back to her phone. 

Now let me teach you a little about customer service...I would not have been so annoyed if you had said: ""I'm sorry, we ran out of containers and should be getting some next week Wednesday.""

Since my companion hadn't seen the old Vegas - it was a perfect opportunity to come out here to Palace Hotel to check out the jerky. The store is on the 3rd using the elevator and it's hidden. I asked someone at the bell desk and they get asked several times a day about the location of this place. I'm just glad I found it. So stepping into the store I discovered the jerky and the bagel chips. My friend had never mentioned the bagel chips so I decided to try the Parmesan cheese garlic flavored one. Very tasty and trust me this one was gone in a day. One container is not enough - I could eat that myself. They also have some sweet flavored bagel chips (cinnamon/chocolate). 

It took me awhile to narrow down my choices for beef jerky. I really like the beef nuggets so I got the teryaki flavor. It was a bit too salty for me so I will go with the regular flavor next time. The beef jerky in strips I thoroughly enjoyed the regular flavor (smokey). The jerky was also gone quickly. It's so easy to spend money at this store - everything is so tempting. Where to draw the line? At $8.50 for the nuggets and $8.25 for the bagel chips - it was a steal.",A1fZP8vgbXjNcCJ2pAzQDg,4,1,5,Hkd9mzvnlJYp9XhppiHuKA

Hawaii folks know about it; It's probably one of the few things in walking distance from the California that's not simply another place to gamble.  One time I took some non-Hawaiian friends there and at first they were like ""wth, where are you taking me?"" But then we got in and they found stuff they liked.  They even told their friends so I think I started something.

Even though we initially didn't realize that LVJE moved locations a while back (from The Plaza) and despite the brutal winter weather outside, our entire family - including the kids - continued on the journey.

It was totally worthwhile (granted, it was my first time visiting LVJE, but I had occasionally received omiyage from there in the past and liked the treats).  The place is pretty small and the aisles are quite narrow, but there's enough room for the averagesized individual to walk through it while using the store's hybrid grocery basket / cart (ingenious, btw, since it allowed my fiveyearold nephew to hold on to my items while I shopped lol).

There's a lot of variety here in terms of sweet, salty and/or spicy snacks, as well as a few sugarfree candies.  I chose to buy the garlic bagel chips, cinnamon bagel chips and pepper beef jerky.  I spent well over $30, but it was worth every penny.  The beef jerky was especially great to bring along with me during the remainder of trip, particularly during long car rides. 

Since then, my parents have taken another trip to LV.  They returned with two boxes of the almond butter shortbread cookies for me.  Within a few days, I had devoured them all =D

Cinnamon Bagel Chips 
(top seller. they're famous for it and everyone comes to buy them) They also have other flavors like blueberry and chocolate cinnamon. These were $7.00 a bag.

Almond Butter Shortbread Cookies
YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM! They're $5.00 for a small box, and trust me once you open them and eat one, you are sure to eat them all in one sitting. They were so delicious, sweet (but too sweet), and crunchy.

Sliced Almond Brittle Bites: Didn't get to try them, but they are made with Splenda. Overheard one of the ladies say she bought a pack as a gift, and ended up eating them all instead in which she needed to buy another bag, and bought two instead to make sure the other one becomes a gift.

Other interesting things I found were dried persimmons, apricots, chocolate covered gummy bears, lemon bar cookies, chocolate covered espresso, and of course lihing goodies.

For the money this is the best beef jerky you will likely eat if you buy the right package. 

You see the package that has the cards on it like a club or spade? Don't buy that one. Get the gold package and try original, peppered, hot and spicy, and teriyaki, all are exceptional. The hot is more traditional shoe leather but very hot and awesome. Very addicting to be sure. 

Here is a tidbit, if you buy at least $50 worth, they will usually throw in a free gfit without you seeing them do it. Spend the money, you can eat some for a snack in your room and then take some back home. We usually spend about $80 since it is only sold in Las vegas.

It is small but full of yummy interesting snacks so we chose a few-

1. Fruit Flavored Beef Jerky - This beef was marinated in Strawberry Syrup. The meat was sweet and you did taste the strawberry syrup.
2. Karen's Gourmet Almond Butter Shortbread - It was OK - my daughter loved it - I don't care too much for hard cookies and these were not soft at all.
3. Chile Lemon Mango - This was a disappointment because I love sour stuff and this was not sour - sure it had lemon but not enough, actually I think salt could have (should have) been added.

The rub was I was put into a panic when I went into Plaza first and saw the store SHUT DOWN?!?!? I had no idea they'd moved or even closed in Plaza. So I was depressed for a good few hours. Damn recession. And then I wanted to just do a walk thru on Las Vegas Club and was SO HAPPY they relocated in the area. 

I assumed they relocated during the Plaza remodel when things were closed there? It would have made sense. But now Las Vegas Club is Struggling big time.

At least they're in a good location that you can see exiting the center casino rest rooms.

The store looks clean and neat, I forgot to ask what they did with all the polaroids they had on all the walls of their previous place. I hope they're all in albums or even boxes, there are a lot of happy customers including me in those pics. 

There are so many good things there. I didn't have a lot of money when I went and wound up spending the most I had in any shop I've been in all week, about $25, well spent. Over the years, I love and bought the mixed nuts, almond butter shortbreads. I love the card symbol shaped jerkys, beef sausage bites, I love the beef steak nuggets! I also love the snack sticks, so many things. MMM. Clam jerky?!?!

When I get home, I have to relax and chill from scarfing down a whole bag of something. So I developed a routine. I open the first bag and take JUST ONE and out the rest in the fridge. I take 1 every time I have a real accomplished day as a reward or a really terrible day, where it's a cheer up. Has to be drastic either way. Then the 4-5 bags I get I can hopefully stretch out until I can go back for another fix.

Top of the list is the Islander Brand Lup Chong (Chinese Sausage).  These are traditional Chinese sausages that were originally crafted in Honolulu, and produced in Los Angeles, CA.  The owners purchased the rights to the recipe and produce the sausages for the store.  These sausages are thick and a bit on the sweet side.  Wonderful for fried rice, baked salmon with lup chong, or just eating along with steamed rice.  OMGDELICIOUS!  Get it!  Grade:  A+

Islander Brand Sweet Dried Pork.  Aunty Karen calls this the jerky that taste like char siu.

Delicious, nonetheless.  Grade:  B+

I did want to try their popular cinnamon bagel chips, but I couldn't get myself to spend $8.75/$9.00 on them (I wish they had a smaller size at a smaller price).  Hubby ended up getting the peppered beef jerky ($8.75), and my friend got 2 different teriyaki beef jerkys ($8.75 and $9.50).

The peppered jerky was good but salty.  Even my hubby who likes salty food said it was salty (didn't deter him from eating it though).  My friend's teriyaki jerkys were really good.  That's why I had to make a second visit to get one myself.  In hindsight, I should've gotten at least 2 bags instead of one.  Hubby and I ate it on our way home to Cali and it's almost gone now.  Shoot.

On the way to Vegas, the topic was not buffets, restaurants, desserts, drinks, clubs, etc. that was talked about but my friend's friend was raging about these shortbread cookies that we must get or we ain't leaving Las Vegas. Sounds like a great idea not to get them because I sure don't mind not leaving LV :D! 

Anyway, this place felt hidden. I dont even remember how we found the place but we sure had to go through flights of stairs and escalators and cut through certain corners before we reached the destination. 

I feel ridiculous and a bit ashamed for not getting ANY jerky because the whole time i was in there, i thought cookies were the only important thing to try! 

Shame on me... hm, I actually thought about creating a whole separate yelp page for Karen's Gourmet cookies but then the sugar rush I'm getting from these heavenly cookies got me all antsy and when that happens, i think it's just better that i stay put and not create anything of any sort because something ridiculous might happen. Okay, i am just rambling on about non-sense now. 

Anyway, these cookies definitely tasted traditional, homemade and rich. Every bite of these cookies tasted perfectly light in texture and had a nice creamy flavor with a kick of whatever certain taste you chose. I personally chose the almond butter as mentioned earlier and it was absolutely mouth-watering!",zjekxY1oWhwHLMYb6J-19g,6,3,5,2yYD8U8Bdo_GOYtb0-qQAQ

Strangely, ""Big Island"" beef jerky is made in Vegas and brought back to Hawaii.  What was a little odd this time was that there were new varieties of cookies and fewer choices of beef jerky.  No more 1 pound bags of anything.  But maybe it's because of beef prices these days.  The shortbread cookies and bagel chips are legendary for those who have sweet tooths.  So easy to spend $50 (or more - way more) here so be sure to stop by close to the end of your trip if you're on a budget.",kkTOV5bnE9hHb5V_zd9b9g,0,0,4,Uy7Ju7dCZ-6tCCrICVK9Pw

I absolutely love the cinnamon bagel chips but they were out since they ran out of containers. I decided to buy the jalapeno parmesan bagel chips instead since I was bummed out and it is very good. Another must have is the almond butter shortbread cookies. There are many other choices like beef jerky and dried fruit. Minimum purchase to use debit/credit cards is $10.

Salt valhalla.

The jerky store called. It's out of me. (I miss it, but I'm never downtown early enough in the evening.)

They have so many different kinds of dried meaty goodness it's hard to know where to begin (I recommend the peppered nuggets in the silver pouches). If beef's not your thing, they have clam, ahi, turkey, pork  and other jerkies as well, along with dried fruits, nuts, candy and Hawaiian junk food.

Between the 2 lbs of jerky that inevitably come home with me and the deep fried Twinkie from Mermaids, trips downtown are starting to get pretty unhealthy.

The Jerkys on the other hand, were aight.  There is obviously something with Hawaii locals and transplants with the jerky thing.  Don't get me wrong, I am a carnivore to say the least.  Still, if I had to choose, I can't resist Chinese style beef jerky.  Luckily, this place supplies it, but you can get a larger variety at 99 Ranch, 168 Market, SF Market or other Asian grocery stores for a lot less.

Besides, we took full advantage of purchasing a dehydrator at Bass Pro Shops during Black Friday and now starting our very own jerky trial and error venture. LOL.

The place acoomodates and caters to locals from the islands and provides airline carry-on boxes as well as incentives for purchases over $100.  Good gifts after a long vacay of losing money...haha (for Hawaii visitors).

So, if I had to pick a place, I would have to say I like local jerky queen, Sun's Jerky, here in Las Vegas.  I believe it's Thai style and love the heat they can muster out...others not so much.  They offer buffalo, chicken and other flavors that is a must to try.

But until Sun's starts to make bagel crisps, you'll find me frequenting both places.  So why 4-stars you might ask...try the crisps then holla at cha boy!
