Until now Chipotle fanatics been hustling and constrained to the one location on strip, squeezed right in between Harrahs and Casino Royale. But time has come, a brand new location just opened in Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood where you can have your favorite meal in a brown recyclable paper bag. You can sit inside or at one of their tables in the shopping mall. Same old stories, no surprises.

So why would you go to Vegas and eat the usual stuff? 
First: Its fast and damn good (Time is vital in Vegas)
Secondly: Its a cheap meat with high quality food (Last longer)
Thirdly: Because you dont always have the mood to go fancy (Rough night?)",HLgjFpxKuvjJ7MCLCw6rHg,1,0,5,WPw8aToKlZS53YjT7dg7eg

It was almost as if they anticipated what people were going to say and ended up putting the wrong things on the burrito. 

Also, there scanner was not working for the mobile chiptopia cards. I had to read out the long number to the person at the register twice instead of the quick scan that I am used to.

2nd person didn't give vinaigrette when I asked. The 3rd person asked if I wanted anything else and I said yes a side of chips, but didn't tell the fourth person. 
4th person asked if I wanted anything else AGAIN when I had told the previous employee, and then paid attention to her coworkers conversation, and had to ask me again because she wasn't listening. Horrible communication. I felt rushed the entire time. Do you rush a patient if they're dying because it's busy? NO. Not one person was smiling. NO ONE, even the manager, wasn't wearing a name tag, otherwise I would've written the name of every person that I had contact with. I didn't feel welcome or valued as a customer.

I found hair, and a kind crew member grabbed the store manager for me. Again, no smile, no handshake, no name tag, no greeting, nothing. I showed him the piece of hair that was in my food. It was a lighter color, but I would know if it was mine. If it was mine, it wouldn't have been buried in the food either, it would've been close to the surface. What he said was ""That's not one of our hairs, but I could either make your food again, or give you a refund."" How unprofessional. How is a manager going to tell me that it's ""not one of theirs""? Who cares? And to think that the issue is going to be solved by giving my money back or making my food again? LOL. My stomach was upset the rest of the day. Customer service? Zero.

I love Chipotle but what's unfortunate for this location is the workers. I guess the saying is true, it's hard to find good workers.  First off there was only one person in the front. I thought poor thing, she had to do it all by herself and then another worker came from the back to help her. But that was short lived as when she was asking what I would want I told her my order which consisted of three chicken bowls and when it ended was when I asked for grilled vegetables and unfortunately for me they only had enough for one which the guy behind me got. I asked how long it would take to which she turned around and glared at me and said 5 minutes. When I said that I would wait she turned around and went to the back again where she came from without saying one word to me or to the girl that was there. A cashier finally appeared which took the guys order that was behind me and the original girl just looked at my three bowls just sitting there, looked at me and I said that I was waiting for the grilled veggies and then without saying a word to me she mumbled something under her breath and went to help the next customer. WTH?!?!?  I think either companies need to have better training to train their employees or people in general need to step up their game as it isn't acceptable and is a bad reflection of a company.  No one wants to pay for bad service as it's one reason we eat out.  

Hopefully these workers will get the training they desperately need.",ETt5294q4Xm1ZB8EX28Ejw,5,3,3,fDD1t6VuEyD-YNfe4xLlKA

I told the girl behind the counter I wanted a bowl. She stoped me and said I had to get behind all the people in line behind me cause they were here first.

3616560,2015-06-23,2,KiTHWMK20GvgPvpHSzTHTg,"A ray of light in a fog of way overpriced, arguably unhealthy food for blocks.

Chipotle usually gets 3 stars from me. It's reliable, does the fill-the-tummy trick, and I salute them for their sustainability chops, considering the chain's footprint, at this stage. But it's Chipotle. Not a mom and/or pop. And there's like not a whole lot of variation in the flavors you can get, when you go there; I usually get the same thing. Every. Time. But in Lost Wages, Chipotle is different. Even magical. 

I needed food. Preferably vegetarian, less than $20 for an entree, and within walking distance from Paris Las Vegas. I searched Yelp for an hour. Resigned myself to eat at the closest $$ Asian place, even though it didn't have very many vegetarian options (though the menu did say to ask, but I digress). But then, the clouds parted, and there was Chipotle.

At home in LA (that's Los Angeles for the tourists, not Louisiana), I eat Chipotle as a last resort. Here, it's a first resort amidst the panoply of resorts. That's a lot of resorts. 

There was a line. At 10:20 pm. There was a line when I left. Not longer than a lunchtime line at any busy Chipotle. You know the one. It moved quickly enough. I caught up on social media, as I wanted to avoid thinking about all of the awkward, as I stood in line by myself. 

One thing I was surprised not to have learned before: sofritos counts as a ""protein,"" so even if you get a smidge of sofritos, like I do because in larger quantities they invariably give me acid reflux, guacamole is extra! Go ahead, take my money. 

But, Chipotle, your experiment to get people to eat tofu at an American quick food chain is going to fail, if you make people choose between guac and sofritos. Just telling it like it is.",7phYLLdHK4pOrD46xJTaPA,3,2,4,taRTi--_zBWGYJ1RS4W1WA

This location in particular only lacks that they get bombarded by guests and If I don't time it properly between my lunch break I have to swing by somewhere else for lunch. Like any Chipotle you go through the line picking out what goes and what doesn't. I've noticed here they are very punctual about keeping the supply fresh. They're not conservative about how much they give you, if you feel jaded by the amount simply ask for a tad more. I find talking to them like a person and saying ""thanks"" will get you what you want sooner than a complaint. The biggest highlight here may be that there's no off the strip type premium charge for their food. They're no more expensive here than any Chipotle I've been to anywhere else and I'm really glad considering even the near by Subway deal is $8 foot longs. The place is a bit small maybe but they do offer additional seating just outside the store.
