The chicken katsu was dry.  The roll and macaroni salad was bland.  But my biggest complaint was the teryaki sauce.  It was watery and bitter.  Maybe I am used to Aloha Specialities  in the California Hotel, but I was not impressed.",3pavDkxevZEENdJ9jvl08w,1,0,2,UJsTfmggo47O0QyrYs5f9g

The meat tastes as if it was microwaved cooked or boiled cook and then thrown on the grill for a little ""grille"" taste.  They really need to cook them fresh when customers order them.  I hope they will change the way they cook their meats, otherwise they will lose me as a customer.",J-WfsRmH4VPsycArml_G9Q,1,0,2,4IwiIOMOy-_6qgf-4pLEQQ

I myself love the affordability of this place; You really do get a lot with your meal---any numbered meat meal comes with Miso soup, macaroni salad, white rice and regular salad or steamed veggies. I especially love Maui chicken special, tofu salad and mango and avacoado salad here--all of these are out of this world!!! Salmon, meat dumplings and noodles are also above average.

This is by far one of the best lunch spots in town. I would not recommend it for dinner, unless it's a quick affair--the place has a fast-food type of atmosphere. However, if you are not looking to dine in style and just want some authentic-tasting Hawaiian food (this restaurant was highly recommended to me by a native Hawaiian co-worker), Maui Rose is an excellent choice.

P.S. A variety of Hawaiian juices, drinks, snacks etc are offered for sale here that are more difficult to find elsewhere.",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,1,0,4,qEmfJn6hNZ6QTotbdyw6wA

The Katsu is average, even slightly on the dry side.

The Kalbi is average, maybe slightly over-sweet

All the rolls remind me of rolls I can pick up at the grocery from Vegas Express Shushi

In fact, the only thing that slightly peeks up above average is the Mango Salad. (Typical garden salad, but with mango chunks, but with a nice zesty vinaigrette that contrasts well with the sweetness of the mango)

There's nothing bad about it, service is always fast and friendly, it's just that nothing about it really pushes it over the top into a higher ranking.  

- Recommended if you just need a Hawaiian food fix and can't be bothered to go to Aloha Island.",j3Xr0XifJTb43Hdmue8b9A,1,0,3,-5jrKrVFNFBuT6OKHme7WQ
