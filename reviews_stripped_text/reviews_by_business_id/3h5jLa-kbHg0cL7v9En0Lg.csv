Everything I have tried tasted good. I just didn't like the fried chicken. It was crispy and nicely fried but there's something in it's flavor that tastes kinda weird/icky to me.The desserts and pastries were good. Not too sweet, not bland either. The new york cheese cake was just the right, so is the pecan pie.

Maybe because it was lunch time, the lady who serves us drinks was a bit too busy to ask us if we need any refills. We had to flag her down. But she promptly got my drink.

The cashier...well, she doesn't look very cheerful. She wasn't rude or anything like that, but she was curt with customers and  just doesn't look welcoming lol. Not very customer service-y.

A lot of nice older folks play here and eat here. Might bring the parentals one time.",iOXqBVY8xbQfMWOmotz30A,0,0,4,NnDXrU-cq_PE20rwYvgSrg

You won't stay hungry in this place it's just nothing special. Lots of choices - Asian, Mexican, omelets, carving station and deserts. The thing is that none of these are anything that you could remember.
The place is good for breakfast - for around 8-9 dollars it's unbeatable if you stay in Sam's Town.
And one quick tip - don't forget to get BConnected card before you go there, it will take less then 5 minutes and you will save money.",Oa3c3GyGMk2eEL_8yjFFWg,3,0,2,G8QMdbpiUpJgufh0vQrg-w

Been us we ate:
-prime rib
-baked catfish 
-fried shrimp
-baked yams
-garlic sticks
-Asian food
-rice pilaf
-mashed potatoes with gravy
-BBQ ribs 
-sauteed mushrooms
-chocolate cake
-peach cobbler
-pecan over cream
(I'm pretty sure there was more but my food coma mind can't remember everything. ..sorry)

Of all the food, the only thing we didn't like were the ribs and messages potatoes with brown gravy. 

We are trying to make the rest of our trip work so we can go back at least once more.  We didn't stay at their rv park but it looks nice and its closer to the buffet than where we chose ...so,  we may relocate. 

I highly recommend this restaurant.  If I could give it a 6 out of 5, I would! 

Before I forget,  it was also clean and most of the casino smoke did not make its way to or table,  which we loved.. .price includes a drink,  salad bar,  dessert...and they let me keep the bones of the ribs for my dog :-)",zl-VhyJ6HpisGv1Z4GDSHg,1,1,5,BjnD9petIHB2pdRhVDWWqw

One of my party ordered a hot tea, and received a cup of pale pink hot water with various residue floating around. The dessert was okay, and the ice cream superb. The service was pretty good, and the staff was relatively friendly. The self serve frozen yogurt area was unsanitary. In order to get an ice cream cone, you had to stick your hand down the container. The sugar cookies were absolutely delish, and the butter pecan ice cream fantastic. All in all, this buffet was a pretty good value for the price 9.99 per a person.

Overall it was good. They had great variety of food. They had snow crab legs on Friday night. They only thing I didn't care for they were not already pre-split to where you could easily get the meat out. I felt as though I was wasting allot of meat. We usually have scissors we take with us and I wish we hadn't of forgot them. But again overall it was good. 

We then went for Sunday champagne brunch.  They had asian items, mexian, breakfast and roast beef along with may other sides. Just wished they would have had more fresh fruit selection.  Also considering it was champagne brunch we never once were offered any and didn't see any out for us to get. I seen only 3 people near us get champagne and they seemed to be locals the way they were greeted by the waitress and knew to ask for it.

Oh and don't thong about going to go get your own drink from the soda foutain. The waitress yelled at me as I picked up a glass and said that someone would be to my table to get my drink selection.

Maybe it's because we got here at 9:40am so the rush hadn't started yet. Anyways, the food was decent. Nothing super special but the usual breakfast items were flavorful (bacon, links, corned beef hash, processed eggs lol). I was pleased to find that they had steamed rice in their Asian section so that made my day. 

Prime rib was served as well and it was tasty, albeit a bit rare. They also had a fondue table so I tried the cream puffs and strawberries. I thought they were pretty good but my mom said that the chocolate was sundae chocolate and not the usual fondue chocolate.

All in all I give this place 3 stars for their breakfast. For a comparison, Main Street Buffet is a 5 star IMO because they have Hawaiian food lol.

The first time I went to the Firelight Buffet inside Sam's Town, it was ok. The food and service was decent enough, given the price. That visit was worth three stars.

This past experience, however, is worth two. There wasn't much of a selection and the meat was tough and dry. The service was also terrible. My grandmother asked for water three times and the waitress never brought it to her. When I returned from the bathroom, she asked me to try to get water for her and then left to get dessert. I was able to get the water for her, but it shouldn't take a customer three times to get the waitress/waiter to bring them something they need. The only reason I give them two stars instead of one is because the ice cream (that you have to ask for, not the stuff you pump from the machine yourself) is good.",2KMzPsn6cTKPbmY3wRLa_g,1,0,2,bgaE5FkeDHRAhWfei88N9g

I will try to attach a picture of it so you can weigh in. Either way, don't waste your money. By the way, the crab, shrimp, lobster I had anticipated was actually very small oysters on the half shell.

For dinner, there is a fair amount of variety and the food is average. The carved ham was really great. Figure in soup and salad, a variety of entrees, dessert and drinks for only $9.99, plus the waterfall ambiance, and you have a very nice dinner.

The Sunday brunch also has soup and salad, omelet station, carved meat station, a limited variety of lunch entrees, desserts, drinks, and champagne. As with dinner, get the carved ham and make sure to ask for a table by Mystic Park. This also costs $9.99 but we went for breakfast and weren't interested in the lunch entrees, desserts, or champagne, so we wished Sunday just had a regular breakfast at $5.99.

The breakfast was amazing for the $5.99 price. Although the food was average (except for the carved ham which was great), they have everything you could want in a breakfast.

Standards like eggs, sausage, bacon and pancakes were present for the masses, but I was also please to find a greats election of fresh fruit, beans, tortillas and a tortilla bar and oatmeal with all kind of toppings available. And this is all for breakfast! On top of all the great food choices, the service was excellent, with waiters and waitresses coming by periodically to check up on coffee and drink levels.

955141,2013-12-25,1,3h5jLa-kbHg0cL7v9En0Lg,"""Bah! Humbug!"" Sorry to be Mr.Scrooge on a Christmas day. I have to write this review so other future potential customers on a budget or fix income won't make the same mistake like I did by eatin here. You probably get your money's worth eatin somewhere else than at this dump! I had the most unpleasant experience on Christmas Eve by venturing into this joint in hope of having a great meal before Christmas. This was the biggest mistake of my entire adult life! I arrived there around 5:30 pm when they start to serve dinner. I thought maybe if I got here early when they start to serve the food fresh out of the oven. Maybe everything will taste warm and fresh. Oh man the joke sure was on me! My first bite of a piece of one of it's  rotisserie 
chicken breast was so dry it almost yank my whole upper denture right off. Everything just taste so bland and synthetic. The only thing noteworthy was the ice cream. It's the only thing that taste natural out of everything I tried! Which is not much of a selection from other regular buffets if I forget to mention earlier by the way. Besides the food beyond redemption, even one of its employee by the name of Valerie was so rude and unprofessional! I thought I was either in a nightmare or was in a part of a twilight zone Christmas special! She's just one of those rotten apple that makes the whole crop stinks. She just either seems too tired from her shift or wasn't too excited to do her job that evening.I worked in the customer service industry for more than twenty years and I never make my customer feel at fault or out of place! I think she sure deserve the golden globe for that one. The reason I think I make her tick was I thought she or someone else had cleared my table after I have arrived there no more than five minutes. So I demand to speak to the manager immediately. She was so hesitant to call for management. When the lady mgr arrived and start figuring I have mistakenly sat on the wrong sitting that was originally assign to me. The lady mgr was very courteous and apologetic. She took me back to my original sitting and tells me that sometimes customer do lost their way eating here for the first time. I thought to myself that she is absolutely right about the place being huge but definitely not the food selections and quality! Anyway, I feel a little embarass  about the whole early Alzheimer ordeal that I immediately apologize for my dumb found fame for being the village town idiot. I thought that was the end of it. So I went back to eatin the awful supper in hope maybe my evening won't be in vein. Was I wrong again! When I went to grab my dessert I start to notice Valerie giving me the Sauron stare and when I turn around she start to whisper something to her male co-worker that was next to her. That was the final straw which broke the camel's back! This is the worst establishment or food and customer service experience I ever had! In my own opinion, the only redemption or dignity Sam's town Casino has left is its loose slot machine and its stunning laser light show! I would rather paid full admission price to watch the show than to eat at Firelight or maybe Fireless buffet ever again! And to think that TV cookin sensation, celebrity Rachael Ray would recommend this place to her fans and audiences. She must have inhale too much smoke in the kitchen before eatin here.

Just because it's inexpensive, doesn't mean tat you can't serve interesting and tasty food in a very appetizing way. And so many of the desserts completely lacked flavour. Sorry, but the coconut cream pie had no coconut flavour and the blueberry pie had good texture but lacked punch. Oh and the sirloin on Sunday... didn't exist.",cqagyVkvbBB32agnJsIhVA,2,0,2,vixkoAwOXKydsKXADGLRnQ

Service was rather lackluster, had to flag our waitress down to get a refill on our drinks.

The corned beef sliced today was pretty solid. The Asian stir fry vegetables were decent. Other than that, all the food was purchased from Sysco I am assuming. Not very inspiring. IMO, most of the food was not even seasoned... not that I like salt, but it tasted as though the cooking was for people directly here from England - BLAND.

VERY disappointed there was ZERO fresh fruit selection. The only fruits out was a ""fruit cocktail"" of course it was hard work busting open the #10 cans of fruit cocktail in heavy high fructose syrup - or you can have straight from the can PRUNES. 

The gelato section was small - but tasty. I did sample all 3 of the gelato flavors today - mint chocolate chip, banana, & white chocolate. Was the best tasting item out there. Also for dessert, I sampled some green marshmallow cake type of dessert. Not sure what it was. It was edible, but nothing exciting. 

Our server was a very pleasant and friendly middle aged Korean lady. For a buffet, she provided everything I would want out of our server. The right amount of attention was given. If the food quality was better, I would go more often & ask to sit in her section.

The server alone bumped this up to 2 stars. I was tempted to add a 3rd star. I would split the 2 & give this 2 1/2 stars. 

For a brunch buffet, this was a very uninspiring display. My daughter asked if we could go to Checkers for burgers & milkshakes about 30 minutes after the buffet. Sadly, I was tempted to as well.

Then it was kind of like lost in space. The ladies working didn't speak very good English and when we asked where do we start we really couldn't understand her and had to wander around looking for the place that had food since we were seated by the dessert bar. Grrrr. 

When we finally found food everything was picked over and not really appealing. The meat station was crowded so there was no go there so we just grabbed what ever we could get our hands on. Then trying to find our table again!! Holy hell!!

I lucked out and found some amazing macaroni and cheese, made with rigatoni noodles and real cheese that was in a cheese sauce that reminded me of my moms Mac n cheese when I was a kid. Wow at a Vegas buffet. And I grabbed some enchiladas that were awful, ack!! Couldn't get that plate away fast enough. 

So I was full enough on the Mac n cheese so I headed out to the dessert bar. Well that was maybe only our saving grace we had about 5 desserts each a cup of coffee and out we went. 

Then we took a stab the next day for lunch and it was only $18 and the food was somewhat better and my husband found menudo and loved it. Who'd thought on a buffet in Vegas they'd have menudo? And good menudo?? Oh well he got his $18 worth since I eat like a bird. So there are some good thing to eat on the buffet you just have to hunt around for it.

The buffet is nice because there is just about something everyone. 
They are really strict with their meal times so do pay attention to when breakfast, lunch, or dinner will be served. It really is not an issue but if you show up late you may miss it. 
One evening we waited in line for a little while, annoying because people were cutting and going through the section labeled for wheelchairs etc. while the ladies at the counter watched and allowed then to do so, then as we were finally approaching the counter (thank goodness we had not!) a woman came out and stated to everyone that we could go in but they are starting to pick up the food for the night but we are welcome to stay if we wish just know that we will be asked to leave at closing in about 20minutes. Are you kidding me?! Why would we pay full price not to have a full selection and then also be asked to leave?
Very annoying because they should have stopped everyone from lining up and waiting in line in the first place! I would have been much more upset had we paid for 5 people then not have the full buffet to choose from. 
Other than that lunch was nice with plenty of options. 
The food was all pretty bland and not very flavorful as far as any spices go but you could add your own salt and pepper and that helps a little. 
Overall, it was not terrible other than the dinner service that one night. 
It was not over priced and there were many options to choose from.

The food found at the buffet is phenominal. It has freshness and made on site quality you can actually taste. Not a single thing I found appeared or tasted like store boxed bulk food. Considering the price Monday - Thursday is only $10 that's value for your buck without compromising flavor.

The stations are Asian, Italian, American, Mexican, Salad Bar and Desert Bar.

Strangely enough, I have this strange problem with Las Vegas as well.  I've never been much of a gambler, and the idea of immediately and constantly overstimulating my other senses seems just too damn overwhelming. 

So, combine the two and I'm pretty much destined to be disgusted.  The Firelight Buffet surprised me though. For a few bucks I was given the opportunity to slowly peruse ""cuisine"" from around the world.  While  most fare was standard and lacking real challenging flavor (c'mon its buffet food), I was impressed with both the freshness and variety that was presented. A ""far east"" counter featured quite tasty vegetable spring rolls while another, on the polar opposite side of a gigantic room of food, had farily decent tamales. Each plate I consumed was like a small trip around the world, and though I had no space in my stomach available, I could've continued my varied ""culinary trip"" for at least another couple of countries. I'll admit it: I was impressed with the total tonnage of food availability.  The atmosphere was quiet and serene, the service was fine, and I was even given alcohol as part of the deal.  

I left full and I left happy.  Sick, but pleasantly so.  Maybe I'll start playing bacarrat or something and rethink this whole Vegas thing.

Never heard of the place, and wouldn't you know, we're eating inside! Our host (sister) didn't have their player's card and mentioned to the cashier at Firelight Buffet that they're a member, but, misplaced the darn thing. *Everyone chuckles* Living by the rule book and never skipping a beat - the cashier informed us we'd need a card. We asked if we could just use card from the lady behind us because she graciously offered it during the little issue we faced. ""No"", was the response from Rule Book Rhonda. She was nice enough to mention we can get in the 'Express' line when we came back with a player's card... 

ANYWAYS, we came back with a player's card and I swear to God, we watched a customer...  front of the line dead center, ask the person behind them to use their player's card to get inside the buffet cause' they didn't have theirs on them. Wouldn't you know it, it didn't phase Rule Book Brenda transformed into Bending The Rules Rhonda, accepted the card with open arms and let them in. 

I have a glare. A glare that forgoes your ability to comprehend what's currently happening with a direct line to your soul. It hits you firmly. You feel as though you have a concussion. My glare crossed paths w/ Rule Book Rhonda. Her skin tone altered from a milky white to an almost translucent fixture. I saw her leave her body, then come back. She immediately informed the 'Express' cashier we were approaching and accordingly let us in and sat us within a minute. 

Oh.. the food. Yeah, there was some food here. It's a buffet. 

Firelight Buffet has a decent selection for what it is. Considering we showed up during breakfast / brunch, however, the layout made you feel like you were here for lunch / early dinner. The breakfast area was minimal in both food quantity and size. Let's put it like this; if I cloned and had both myself and I standing straight up with my arms out, as if I was in the shape of the letter T.. that's roughly the length the breakfast buffet area was. 

Bacon, Breakfast Sausage & Ham. French Toast, Pancakes, Chicken Fried Steak w/ Country Gravy, Croissants, Scrambled Eggs and a thing or two that I probably didn't see. I mean, I can't fuss about this because this is what I want in breakfast.. but I guess when you're spoiled, chubby and cranky in the morning you want to see more food (breakfast). 

And that's where they kind of did the buffet deal well - they had a variety of tamales that were fresh and wrapped in that good ol' corn husk - Reminiscent of those had back home. Taquitos were pretty decent, too. Typical buffet going on with under-the-lamp pizza, deep pan of fried chicken, egg rolls, hand-cut turkey and so on. A good mixture for those that want a little of everything. 

A decent experience aside from the intro, they filled my tummy and had a mediocre selection that I can't complain about. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but if for some reason we do, I wouldn't hesitate.. especially 'cause I now have a players card",jbOJV077QCGzduE6zFYO_A,17,13,3,kix0j3YZ2Uc5BBeYg7FSYg
2757775,2017-08-19,1,3h5jLa-kbHg0cL7v9En0Lg,"I've eaten at the Firelight off and on for over 10 years.  For a while, I even worked at Sam's Town and enjoyed eating there with my family.  Lately, it's really gone downhill, I'm sad to say.  I'd like to give 1 1/2 stars, but that's not an option.  I'll round up.  But trust me, this is a 1 1/2 star buffet.

While I appreciate that Sam's Town has tried to cater to the local neighborhood through reasonable pricing weekday specials, the quality has suffered.

Tonight, we went to Sam's Town for dinner.  We hadn't eaten there in a while and we like to go to our local businesses.  We tried to go to one of the dinner specials at a full service restaurant, but we were a bit late, so we decided to go to the buffet.  TERRIBLE IDEA.  

Typically, the buffet is decent quality given the price.  However, tonight it was horrible.  The line was full of screaming toddlers and infants with no one taking responsibility for them.  We should have left then.  But, at that point, we'd already invested 20 minutes in the line and were almost to the front.  We paid our $25 per person (Friday night prices) and were quickly seated.  I was hoping things would improve now that we were separated from all the screaming children.  Nope.  They did not.

I went to the buffet and picked out a couple of dishes - some fried shrimp (tasty), some calamari rings (eh, ok), some mac and cheese (also tasty)... and then there were the crab legs.  Friday night is supposed to be crab leg night.  So terrible.  So So terrible.  The hot crab legs were grimy and dirty.  When I broke them open, they were no better.  They were dry and brown.  I threw a few away because I thought they might actually be spoiled.  My husband ate some prime rib, chicken, and potatoes.  He said they were all fine, but not worth $25.  

What we both noticed was a distinct lack of vegetables.  There were not ANY fresh vegetables outside of the lettuce and tomatoes on the salad bar.  As far as hot vegetables, there was a weird canned corn/peas/beans/carrots mix, and you could get stir fried veggies to order.  I went  out of my way to look for more.  There were not any.

The dessert was fine.  The ice cream was tasty.  The pies and cakes are made somewhere off site and tasted a little stale.

If you're looking for dinner, go elsewhere.

**I will note that typically their breakfast buffet is tasty; however, I cannot endorse it because I haven't been there in quite some time.**",utS9ZAswZZx3QkegS_25SA,2,0,2,Ls56dPx_h2Nkz5BJjAaUVQ

The crab is partially ""cut"" so you can easily crack them and they come both hot and cold with different types to choose from. Yes, tons of butter, cocktail sauce, and lemons are present and constantly being restocked with the seafood. 

If you're not into the seafood that night, don't worry...all of the other stations are also open for your Italian, American, Mexican, carving stations hearts delight! Don't forget the ice cream and desserts as well!

The buffet was kind of small & had repeats of the same dishes in different spots instead of all different dishes. That was a little disappointing. They only had cantaloupe, honeydew, & pineapple for fruit. 

Their salad section didn't have any spinach or mixed greens. Just plain romaine & iceberg. But the toppings were plentiful & I was able to make a yummy one. They had 3 different options for soup, the kind I chose was way too heavily salted but the turkey was tender & flavorful & I liked the taste just couldn't have too many bites. 

They had super yummy NY strip loin steak & also lamb. They had sliced white & dark meat turkey & a strawberry glazed ham. I didn't like the turkey at all but the ham was good. The NY was awesome. The lamb was way too over cooked & had no flavor. I didn't try any of the chicken because every kind of it looked soggy. The mashed potatoes tasted fake. There wasn't much I was impressed with but the NY makes it worth it, after all it was only $15.99 per person. 

The dessert section had a lot of stuff to try. The PB cookies were my fave. They have a chocolate fountain but a lady does it for you instead of self serve. She was nice but the lady who brought our drinks had a bit of an attitude. They also have like 4 gelato flavors but they were all melting so maybe they need a colder freezer. 

So for $15.99 it was fine but I would have gave up an extra $5 for more variety at the Orleans buffet for $20.99 where we went for Thanksgiving.",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,1,0,3,Li6khFnVtvrpztgUJ-BJ-Q

I asked for a prime rib slice, and I was told it was a NY steak. I noticed on another review that this place seems to confuse prime rib and NY steak. What they served as NY steak is DEFINITELY prime rib. What's even funnier is they offer to grill the ""steak"". So you can get a med-rare or med prime rib slice, OR have it grilled. I find this funny and amusing, because I will bet you that on the ""prime rib"" night, they will served you the same slab of prime rib of beef, no bones, and call that prime rib. Hey, they are trying to be efficient. No sense arguing, it's just funny. Just ask for a thick slice, get some au jus, and enjoy!

The spaghetti was OK too, though I know it tasted like Ragu marinara, but there were some Italian sausage and peppers. Lots of other choices, like Asian and Mexican food.

We arrived and were told that many sections were closed off, where we could not sit down to eat. We began surveying what we would start off with breakfast. For starters here is what was wrong with the food:
1) All the food was lukewarm and not hot and I mean very lukewarm.
2) Bacon was not crisp, very rubbery :(
3) Pancakes and French Toast was hard
4) No condiments on the table 
5) Sausages very greasy 
6) No assortment or variety of fresh fruit
7) Omelets very bland tasting
8) Really NO Variety

The plain yogurt was fresh and the hash browns were crispy and good. Will not be returning for breakfast ever again. Very disappointed.",3flFy8siUqia1ZeYymxebw,1,0,2,POkYVlDFyBSVQ-290Zf-aw

Fatty, gristly meats, greasy chicken, canned vegetables, and wilted salad were among the better offerings, and strawberry jello was the best dessert. We felt like we had wandered into a pot luck supper in a white-trash trailer park. Each night has a different theme, but it seems unlikely they could pull off anything as exotic as spaghetti and meatballs or enchiladas.

The buffet didn't have any hot food stations which was a bummer. They also didn't have a huge selection of food.

Lol, because my grandparents and auntie had a game to catch. They have your typical food stations with Asian, Mexican, Italian, Salad Bar/Soups and Meat sections to choose from. I personally thought everything was ok with a few items that was good. 

My steak from the meat section was tender and seasoned well considering this is a buffet but the mashed potatoes was very good. The consistency and flavor of the mashed potatoes was well balanced and was the favorite among our group. The desserts were good but nothing stood out but we did enjoy the apple crumb bars! Overall the buffet is a good value and the servers were all attentive and friendly.

Resorting to listing sauces/gravy/rice as food items to take up space should be a sign. The main ethnic food here is Mexican followed by Chinese. I just stuck with the Chinese food, which isn't great at all. The deep-fried pork pot stickers are the closest thing to authentic. Beware, prime rib is an additional cost! The hot meats available were baked ham and roast beef. The roast beef wasn't too shabby and the ham was sort of acceptable. Desserts are the generic cakes. Lots of sugar-free options. i decided to try the rainbow sherbet ice cream. The lady scooped me 3 scoops of it and by the time I was back at the table, a layer of liquid has already emerged at the bottom of the bowl. Melted ice cream is gross, but tasted ok. 

Service was slow. I had to get beverage refills constantly myself. Good thing the machine was steps away from the table. Restrooms are located outside of the buffet behind where the cocktails are served inside the buffet (hope that makes some sense).",9r6NbOdC_qolyjAbhoHlsg,1,2,2,7b4iROuRwTnDV3zPUm-i1w

This is just a nice standard buffet, nothing super fancy. It's fun.. there's an Asian section with fried rice, chow mein, surprisingly tasty vegetable spring rolls, and other assorted ""Asian"" foods.. including a big bowl of fortune cookies. Then you move on to more ""American"" choices such as corn bread, mashed potatoes, cheesy potatoes, chicken, beef, ham slices, hamburgers (with all the trimmin's), french fries (surprisingly good!), and then there's the ""Mexican"" corner with a taco station, tamales, refried beans, tostada shells in oddly neon shades of red and blue (seriously folks, the blue was electric). To end the actual buffet is the salad bar, which was boring. You'd think they'd have a nice salad section, but no, it's just a bowl of mixed greens and some basic choices like cherry tomatoes and cucumbers. Stay away from the mushrooms, they were all icky brown. 

The dessert area was cool. There are the usual pies and cakes and cookies. Sugar free choices as well. I had some carrot cake and I didn't realize I had grabbed the sugar free one by accident. It was actually quite good anyway. The BEST part of the buffet was the ice cream counter! There were about 10 flavors to choose from, including mint chip, rainbow sherbet, rocky road, butter pecan, and BLUE BUBBLEGUM! The kid in me had to get a scoop of that. They have someone behind the counter serve you, and they give BIG scoops.

The price of dinner also includes one beer or glass of wine. 

So if you're looking for a decent but not fancy buffet, try Sam's Town. And make sure you check out the ""Sunset Stampede"" in the evening.. it's a laser/water/animatronic animal show. It's so cheesy that it's entertaining to the max. I don't know about you, but after I've had a fun buffet dinner, nothing is more fun than watching animatronic bears and coyotes do stuff.",jXXY61CrSzXQmDeUG7aA6Q,1,1,3,o74c9DaS_iGlSpdoaHAGvA

Well, it is just a normal buffet.  Nothing special at all.  Like all the buffets now in Vegas, we had 11 ppl so they jammed us with an 18% Tip (Service Charge).  Our service waitress started off real bad, was bitchy and in a very bad mood.  She tried to salvage as our stay continued, but really, good thing they hit us for the 18% up front or she would have been jammed with very little.

Food is very standard, a little bit of everything.  Mexican was just so so, Chinese same deal.  they did have what looked like a cool stir fry station, but the beef that came out of it was extremely tough.  If you have dentures or dental work, aaaah, might wanna stay away from that.

Best item as usual was at the carving station.  Prime Rib pretty solid as is the turkey & ham.

Best part was the $11.99 price tag on Saturday.  That's why it was recommended by Mrs Ray.  Anyway, if you have lost your shorts at the tables and are in the area, it is fine.  The decor was pretty good so not that bad at all.

If your parents in law can't pronounce it, chances are the chefs at the Firelight, talented as they may be, have not been classically trained to prepare it.  This is one of those times to be inspired by quantity rather than quality. 

Fried chicken, roast turkey, macaroni and cheese, and salads of iceberg lettuce will all fill your belly and power you through until your next free buffet.

I might be confusing this with another buffet but I think the iced tea here is from a fountain.  Rather than fussing to your powerless server, why not finesse the problem by simply ordering hot tea and a glass of ice.  If you don't like that, order something else.  It's included.

This place is fine but probably not worth waiting in a long line for.

Service:  not impressed with the hostess. My Grandfather is 96, I get very upset when people talk down to him or are impatient with him. She was very short even with me.

It is slightly better quality than what you would expect based on the price. Don't expect high-end fancy strip buffet food; It's good but also remember how much you paid.
It is far from the strip and if we didn't ALWAYS drive to Vegas I wouldn't come, it wouldn't be worth the cab fare. It is worth the drive though because it's nice to get away from the strip, the food is good & cheap and the casino is much more inexpensive to gamble in than strip casinos.",16zHT7zp6K9IEQZ1oW6xXg,1,0,4,p1HCmjy4VAC0Nd8kFkcunw

There were many items in the buffet line from prime rib to Mexican and even some seafood.  Most of all, the potatoes, dressing and gravy were delicious and my favorites.  Salad was fresh and tasty.  We both were rather disappointed with the desserts though.  Bread pudding was pretty tasteless.  Lemon pie topping was delicious but I have to say the pie crust was about the worst I had ever had.

After we gambled a bit we decided to eat at the Firelight Buffet, which we have ate at before as kids, and LOVED! Sadly, things are just not the same anymore.

 The buffet hosted an average size variety of foods from Asian, to Italian, to American, etc. I had some pot stickers, egg rolls, fried rice, cheese ravioli with garlic aioli, pizza, scrambled eggs and bacon, cornbread, garlic mussels, and baked chicken. Yes, I was apparently very hungry, because my choice of food was a mish mash of everything lol. The fried rice, scrambled eggs, and garlic mussels was the best thing on my plate coming in with a 3 out of 5 star rating from me! The rest fell below due to a number of reasons, which included rock hard cornbread, hard, most likely reheated twice over breakfast sausages, chewy and somehow overcooked pot stickers, and almost tasteless baked chicken (although it was very tender). I finished most of my plate, but did not make it to a second plate, nor dessert like I usually do at buffets.

 It was around 12:30pm when my family and I came by for lunch, and the staff today was very friendly and deserving of 5 stars for customer service. Btw, if you have a player's card with Boyd hotels and show it to the cashier lunch is just $7.99 (versus $9.99), but always double check beforehand!

I'm not a great candidate for buffets simply because I rarely make it past one plate - but me and all my guests always leave full and happy from the Firelight.

What we like best about this particular one - besides that it is off-strip and has great parking and easy access - is the service. Yes, real, live, actual customer service. These people work hard and will bend over backwards to make you happy. Your drinks will never get low, your coffee will never get cold, and your plates will never hang around long enough for your hollandaise to congeal. They are on the ball!

When I wanted some hot mustard for my bbq pork (which was AMAZING, btw) - and they didn't have it, the chef whipped some up for me. Now, that was awesome.

We've come back several times simply because the service is incredible.

The dessert bar is not too much to speak of, not that I've made it to dessert very often, but they do have a GREAT selection of sugar-free desserts. Not just the cursory jello like most places, but things like pumpkin or apple pie.

Terrible food and even worse service! The food was tepid. The choices were sparse. The sweet roll selection was almost nonexistent.  Canned fruit. I asked the waitress (?) for ketchup and she pointed to the buffet line and said ""to the right"", how courteous. I final found a ketchup dispenser, however, the bowels to put it in were on the opposite side of the buffet line. When I finally got back to my table, the already tepid eggs were cold!  There was ham on the carving table but, apparently the omelet chef was also the server on the cutting board and the line for omelets was so long that getting ham wasn't going to happen. That was my first and only mistake of the day and I paid for it all day with an upset stomach.

5687099,2016-12-04,1,3h5jLa-kbHg0cL7v9En0Lg,Extremely rude manager and server to my friends and family when taking care of a table of eight. Family member got a clam and it was completely dirty as if no one checks them before being out on the line. We told the server which told us they were taking the plate to the chief in which he lied and just throw it away. I asked to speak to their manager she came and was trying to give us an excuse on why it was like that as well as having a really bad attitude. I later ask to speak to the chief who was more then willing to help us out with a very respected presence. The server then started to ignore our table. I asked him why he lied about throwing away the plate and he told me the chief would have cared but that's not what the chief had said. He yelled at the server and the only the manager did and refund his plate. Over all it made everyone every uncomfortable and his cousin was so grossed out he didn't continue to eat.

We had our friends and their son with us and wanted a variety at a decent price plus they have prime rib dinner Saturday thru Thursday so it caught my eye. 

I'm not sure if we really enjoyed our food, we all got a couple plates but we just ate a couple bites on each one. I think we were just hungry. My friend had the coffee ice cream and said it was disgusting but we had mint chip and it was good. The friend and his son got prime rib and it look well done and dry but than his wife came back and hers had some pink so I went up to get some. Mine was M plus with a nice char, I got some au jus and horseradish and we both liked our cuts. 

Over all not terrible but not great... my stomach didn't hurt after so that's always a plus. :-)",dTW_kKKAKyX2fgaYhNtTQA,1,0,3,eHibubrO3BLs2iF8am8EFA

Most the food just outta the can or box, standard fare, heated then served.
Nothing unique here.

The special seafood days are stinky. It reeks.
Standard rule of thumb with fish and seafood: If you can smell it, don't eat it.

Seems Vegas Buffets don't start getting interesting with any inspiration until ya hit the high $20's for admission.

The GF saw someone with a strawberry zinger and wasnt able to find one so I asked the pastry chef if they had such a thing and she said they may have some in the back and promptly went to get us some.

The cheapest buffet I'm aware of in the area (if anyone knows a cheaper one LMK lol), and better than the Monte Carlo which is $25.
