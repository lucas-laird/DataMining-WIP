141629,2014-01-03,1,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"How to write this review is very tough for me.  I want to give it 5 stars because the bone soup is really good and the broth is so simple and good.  I have to agree with all the other reviews when they say it has the best Kimchi and Radish in Las Vegas...its really good.  I have been here several times but my last visit has made me skeptical of the Kimchi and Radish...which is why i can't give it 5 stars..are you ready?.......

We usually finish the kimchi and radish, but this last time we had leftovers and didn't want it to go to waste, so i ask for a to go box.  the waitress informed me that you can't take the kimchi and radish home....(okay since i already removed it from the bowl it comes in why would they care if i take it home unless.....they reuse the kim chi and radish from other customers...this is gross!!!!!).

I questioned why i couldn't take it and another waitress came over and said I could take it this time but not ever again owner policy....I asked why?  Do you reuse it?  she said...oh no! we keep it for the employees....yeah....sure.  

Though i dont know  for sure thats what they do with the kimchi and radish i can only assume that would be the reason and that has me questioning whether to back now.  Why make it so obvious over such a small amount of kimchi and radish too.  i wasnt taking the bowl full of it.",_O34OQgnyeJ-9w3VnjDR1Q,5,1,3,B7yaI0NYZtIxwXBZzgNGiQ

366080,2015-04-19,0,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"This restaurant is not on Spring Mountain in midst of Korean bbq restaurants that serves menu broadness that challenges range of cheese cake factory. 

This restaurant specializes in soup that has bone broth as base. I personally love to see restaurant that specializes in certain cuisine and take pride in it. So that was a plus for me. 

Nothing fancy, but food they serve is what I would expect to get from country side of Korea. Soup has deep taste that comes from hours of preparation. Not too many side dishes just two kinds of kimchi which is the norm for Korean restaurants that serves sullungtang. I wasn't a fan of their bulgogi, as I found their meet a little too tough. 

However their soup is something I would definitely go back for. Anytime you see older Korean men eating in a restaurant, you know what they're selling is going to be good. ;) 

I wouldn't say this place is spotless clean but based on food they serve solely, I give four stars. This is not a place you want to take for people who want modern, clean, westernized Asian food.",mhc1aW9wfIBIRQL7zeUoAA,0,0,4,xkiuspOcdSHv4a9YZF2GHA

Soup - We had two different kind of soups.  Excellent, very traditional and ""unencumbered"".  Almost tasteless but there is a flavor inside that only flourish after you are 1/3 way through.

Kimchi - Best kimchi, period.  Their kimchi is home-made so it even beats the one I had when I was at South Korea.

Green pepper - If you don't eat this often or if you are unfamiliar with it, make sure you clean up the seeds thoroughly before you eat it.  It's not spicy at all but those seeds might cause you some problem later on.",RnE5lH9KhxRdx5DPKTvvTg,1,0,4,k0SHHd9Kd70Fl80QiS5slg

This place has a homemade taste in all dishes even down to the handtorn beef and the insisting on cutting the kimchi for us first. Such good kimchi.  Splitting a soup is fine, be sure to ask for a bowl on the side and add salt, kim chi juices, and plenty of green onions while it's bubbly. 

Parking lot out back is so quiet, try to park closest to the street.   Also the service is so attentive and kind.

Next time,  definitely going for haejangguk, since that looked popular here too :)

1377261,2012-08-04,1,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"I've come to realize that good, I mean.. DECENTLY palatable Korean food is hard to find in Las Vegas. Of all the places I've tried thus far, this small ""hole in the wall"" restaurant is one that has its specialty down.

Green pepper and pepper&bean paste are not usually served as a ""side dish"" at gom tang restaurants but somehow it fits all too well. Also, I love how the restaurant doesn't serve tap ice water, but iced tea.

The gom tang, bibimmyun (spicy cold noodles), galbi (although overpriced), and spicy pork are all good. The prices of all the menu items are slightly overpriced; however, like others have commented, it is Vegas.

I highly recommend giving the restaurant a try. Even in the 100+ weather, I find myself back quite often.",ckDvozHDR5hWgrDRTMYZkQ,3,2,5,IMF0bZSF-0CkBa2fV13VVw
1404213,2015-02-21,11,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"A lot of people ask me what my favorite non-bbq Korean restaurant here is in town. But, if I wanted a certain dish, then it would change for every restaurant. For example, in Korea, a local restaurant might have only a handful of dishes on their menu... but they are able master those dishes over time, and they become specialized in those dishes. So that is the reason why when I go to one restaurant, they might make only a few things that I really like, but at a different restaurant, which has many of the same menu items, I might choose other dishes. It's hard to find a Korean restaurant that does everything, very well.

Which brings me to E-Jo. This is ONE of my favorite Korean restaurants in town, because what they do very well is their seolleongtang. What is this you ask? Basically, you can call it a beef noodle soup. But their are certain things one must consider before generalizing this dish. The broth for example. Normally when one makes a beef broth, you must brown the bones in the oven in order to get that brown color to shine. This soup is unique because you take raw ox leg bones, and boil the hell out of them. This makes for a very milky colored broth. But the flavor is definetely beef.

Traditionally, this soup is only served with either oxtail bones, or with some brisket. At E-Jo, they have expanded themselves by offering a myriad of beef parts, including tongue, tendons, and tripe. I like this because I like offal, and it's definetely something different that I am not used to in this soup, but appreciate eitherway. Another great aspect of this dish are the clear sweet-potato noodles that are located near the bottom of the bowl, they give the soup a great texture. Also, there is salt and chili pepper located on the tables if you feel as if the soup is lacking a bit of seasoning. I tend to like this soup kinda bland, but thats just me.

On another visit, I was able to try their hangover soup, or haejangguk. I thought that the korean hangover soup was well made as well. It is a bean paste soup  that is loaded with bean sprouts, cabbage, and beef brisket. I thought that the seasoning was on point, and it definetely cured my hangover, as was its intention. But, I thought that one thing was missing that really could have taken it over the top. It is usually served with pieces of coagulated ox blood. The one at E-Jo does not have any. I think that if they had added that in, it would have completed the dish.

Ban chan (or side dishes) are usually kept to a minimum at a seolleongtang restaurant. This is the case because they want to preserve the simplicity of flavor that is in that bowl of soup. So, you will typically get kimchi, and some raw chili peppers, which are not that spicy. But let me go on record by saying... E-Jo makes the best kimchi in town. And I just don't mean really good, or awesome... I'm talking the BEST! I know you're going ""Yea, right Mike, sure, uh huh, I believe you, get outta town, pssshhh, hold the phone"" and other stuff. Trust me on this one. Just do it. Or else. Or else nothing.

The prices are OK, not out of this world great, but just OK. The service is also pretty good as well. This place is usually never crazy busy.. even though it should be.. so more than likely the service will be pretty good. I enjoy getting my kimchi fix here, and this place will cure any hangover, no matter how large or small. And even if you aren't hungover, the food here will make you a believer. Just like how much I believe in you.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,28,18,5,q1wLgiJnXZH9eRmm_LETFQ

1409417,2017-04-08,0,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"A very ""traditional"" Korean restaurant located on the east-ish side of down, located a little south of SLS on Sahara. 

This isn't the first time I've been to this restaurant but I guess I never wrote a review. This restaurant specializes in soups where some may refer to as ""home cooking"". 

Parking is located in the back or to the side of the restaurant on the street. The restaurant has quite the number of tables and seats with pictures of the various soups on the wall and a TV with a Korean channel on. 

Every time I have been here, I have gotten the same dish, the beef brisket soup (Seolleongtang ()) or ox bone soup, made with various beef bones and meat. It may seem like a very simple soup but the time taken to make the soup such a nice milky white is unimaginable. 

Unlike some other ""more popular"" Korean restaurants, you do not get like 10 ""banchan"" side-dishes. Instead, this is more traditional like restaurants I've experienced in Seoul where you get their homemade kimchi and homemade pickled daikon. Unlike Seoul, they bring you these two, whereas in Seoul, they are at virtually every table. A sharing plate for you to pick out the kimchi and daikon and scissors to cut to smaller sizes. 

When the soup arrives, you are given a bowl of rice to eat with the soup with a side bowl of chopped green onions and chili paste. The soup is unseasoned but each table has a small thing of salt where you can season your soup to your liking. 

Very clean, simple soup. Very good but light after a heavy meal'ed night or those who just got through a sickness and shouldn't be eating so heavy yet. Should be a nice hangover soup too *cough cough* hahaha ! Aside from the bowl of rice, in the soup, they place slices of super tender brisket and some rice noodles. 

This is probably the best place for Seolleongtang in vegas, not because there aren't many places that offer it in the first place. 

Side note - Theres also a really good one located near korea town in LA too called Han Bat Sul Lung Tang. If you like this, you will definitely like that. That is one of the two things they serve in the restaurant.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,1,4,cQxKjkwz-W_i80hEG9cLgA

1580883,2015-10-24,0,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"Summary:
All the soups are delicious and are a great treat when the temperature is cold outside. Often go up to 3 times a week dependent on the fact of if I have a hangover from drinking or not, or if I want something not as salty and heart warming. It is more or less like chicken noodle soup for Asians.

Decor:
Very cute and Korean inside, I love the Korean TV playing in the background. The chopsticks, pots, bowls, and even how kimchi is presented is very cute.

Service: 
Great service and since the server found out that our party was not Korean so she explained in how to eat the soup properly (adding salt and onion, meat dipping sauce, cold dish peppers, etc). 

Price:
Ox tail soup comes at a pleasant not too expensive 15.99 while the best bang for the buck my favorite would be #2 which include all sorts of meat and intestine (12.99). The basic Brisket Beef Soup is 11.99. All the soups are very well priced, not too high but no steal for sure.

Final Thoughts:
Delicious and good for cold days. Or if you have been drinking or is sick, the soup is to die for.",4ARwcluRdI346WJhMB5eBw,0,0,5,8DlmF_GQd38lTAVrD3BwZw

They bring out two small clay pots - one with cabbage kimchi and the other with raddish kimchi. On the day of our visit, the cabbage kimchi was bleh, but the raddish kimchi was definitely a winner.

I originally gave this place 3 stars, but it really does deserve 4 or higher, I can't punish the establishment simply because Korean is a little outside my comfort zone.

The atmosphere is simple and homey. The restaurant is a few miles from the strip in what looks to be a questionable part of town, though I have no idea what the area is REALLY like. 

The employees are very sweet and very kind. Like I said, this place is extremely authentic so expect communication to be a little difficult. However, you can tell they are used to having English speaking customers and are happy to assist you. 

The food is, like I said, a little outside my comfort zone. The buckwheat noodles were delicious, but very difficult to get out of the bowl and even more difficult to bite through. All the beef we tasted was tender and delicious, absolutely no complaints.

In hindsight, I should've just driven but I was too lazy to get my car out of the parking structure. It cost $11 cab fare to get there. Then I paid $5 tip. I know. Dumb. It was actually worse on the way back. The owner of the restaurant called us a Korean cab to get back to the hotel. He charged us $20!!! What a ripoff!! Anyway, I digress. So, the moral of the story is if you decide to check out this place, and you have a car, just drive there. 

So, I got the oxtail soup, my mom got the Kalgooksoo, and my Aunt got the soup with the greens in it. I thought my oxtail soup was  good! Broth was flavorful. My meat was a little tough...I mean I was fighting with it to get off the bone. But still pretty good. The cabbage Kimchee and the radish Kimchee both were really good! They also gave us peppers with daenjang. The peppers with fresh and crunchy! Really good! 

My mom and aunt said their food was just ok. They said it was bland. Lol. But they live in LA, so they always compare Korean food to the restaurants in Ktown.

2286487,2015-10-27,0,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,I don't get the high ratings here. Came because we needed to replenish our souls so we ordered the oxtail soup and handmade noodles soup. The oxtail soup had only four really small pieces and the flavor couldn't be more bland that you had to seasoned it yourself. No trace of any beef bones used to make the broth. The noodles had a nice texture but nothing more to it. $25 is rather pricey for two soups when realistically was barely enough for one person.,26WdIC3_NDe96xtR2tqeVA,1,0,2,79ix56momVD-VuNtajqypw

We came here because my gf's, and myself included were pretty hungover. Especially the birthday girl (mission completed)! hahaha.. She mentioned she came here last time and that it was pretty good. I wanted Earl of Sandwich instead but b-day girl gets what she wanted and she really needed it. 

There is a parking lot in the back. The inside is pretty big, spacious and clean. The menu is pretty simple but good selections of different dishes to choose from. They have soups/Broths, noodles, pan grilled meat dishes and a few other dishes. 

_Boiled Beef ($24.99 medium) This is an appetizer but also can be eaten as extra meat when you order your Brisket Beef soup as the meat is similar. The boiled beef comes in very thin slices. Pretty lean and oil free, which is why I liked this. A bit bland is taste so they give a sweet sauce on the side to dip it. I recommend getting this to share when waiting for your food.
_Brisket Beef Soup ($10.99) This is a staple dish here and seems to be pretty popular.. Seolleongtang is a Korean broth made from ox bones, briskets and other cuts. The seasoning is usually made at the table as it comes very bland. You add your own amount of salt and pepper and chopped spring onions. As everyone as their own level of saltiness and spice. It can be made very clean and clear or milky and a slight thick white cloud color. I've had many great ones in Koreatown in LA. so can't say this is the best or close to it but for Vegas it is pretty good. The beef was good, wish they added a bit more, and I liked the noodles. The broth was clean, not too salty or heavy. Always comes with a bowl of rice, some like to add it all in the soup, I like to eat it on the side so I can control how much rice I eat. 

The sides they serve are Kimchi and Kkakdugi (a variety of kimchi in Korean cuisine. Usually, it has all the ingredients of kimchi, but the baechu (Napa cabbage) used for kimchi is replaced with Korean daikon). When a restaurant is known for mainly soups you don't get much side dishes because all you really need is kimchi. They also serve gochu (Korean green chili pepper) and a side of red chili paste. The gochu is not spicy so do not worry. It was a bit mild yet crisp and refreshing. 

The food was good, the only reason I did not give 4 stars and gave it 3 (but round up to 3 1/2 stars) was the service. Our waitress was not polite and was pretty stand off ish. You can tell she did not want to be there and I get it, I been there done that, but you are still working and in the field of customer service. It's not like we were being rude or difficult. The inside was pretty empty and it took us about 30 min to get our food! She did not come by to give us a heads up or even give our appetizer which we asked for, and she said it was coming soon but it never did. Even the customers who came after us got their meals 12 min in or so. I don't know if it's because we were real hungry but when I checked yelp on my check in time, yup it was 30 minutes.

? Maya Angelou 

I've only been here a few times, but my most recent visit has left an indelible mark on my taste buds. I first came here years ago when I first started eating Korean food, but I didn't really understand how to flavor the Beef Brisket Soup I ordered. There is of course salt and pepper on the table and I remember being surprised at how much I needed to add to the soup to make it enjoyable...still that first time it was good, just not as amazing as my most recent experience. I wasn't Friends with Michael K. or David S. on Yelp or IRL at the time of my first visit and would have benefited from reading their reviews at the time.

The 2nd time I came to E-Jo Korean Restaurant was when I was searching out Bibimnaengmyun all over town. I love this dish...especially on a warm day. E-Jo's Bibimnaengmyun is a 3.75 - 4 Star dish for me. Certainly enjoyable, but not my favorite in town. Theirs does have a nice balance of sweet and sour that I appreciate a great deal.

E-Jo Korean Restaurant is truly known for their hot soups. Their most popular dish is their Beef Brisket Soup--a simple looking soup with beef brisket, scallion, and noodles in a milky-looking white broth. This broth is anything but simple however...in fact, the entire back side of the menu describes the many ingredients and long cooking process (days, not hours) that go in to creating this wonderfully special broth...more on this soup later. This dish is followed in popularity by variations that use the same broth with different meat toppings...such as a combination of Brisket, Tendon, Tripas, and Honey Comb Tripe...or Ox Tail. After these variation is their Hangover Soup (Haejangguk). Rounding out the top choices is a Dumpling Soup with Rice Cake and a Hand-made Noodle Soup.

And now, back to our previously scheduled discussion about the Beef Brisket Soup. This isn't specifically a seolleongtang, but it is similar.... The broth that is served seemingly bland is literally brimming with incredible potential...it is a treasure trove of abeyant opportunity. The Koreans reading this will know to add salt, pepper, scallions, and of course dadaegi (chili paste). The rest of us should take note. Unbelievable flavor is achieved from an otherwise plain soup that is bursting with hours of love and lurking possibilities. The extended cooking process provides a textural, light-but-rich-and still-mouth-coatingness to the broth, but it also contributes a lush canvas for flavor extraction. It is known that salt does more than simply flavoring a dish, but rarely does salt bring out as much flavor as it does in this broth...complex and subtle at the same time. Korean Chili Paste (dadaegi) is one of my favorite types of spiciness because it has great depth to it as well. The addition of condiment offers heat and substance...I think this was missing from my first visit. Even if you only want your soup mild, you would benefit from adding a little Dadaegi...If you like some heat though, add some more. You don't need to love really spicy food to enjoy this soup, but I wouldn't recommend it be eaten less than at a mild standard, and without some added salt. 

I also need to share some love for E-Jo's Dumpling Soup with Rice Cake. A pleasant surprise for me, I enjoyed this a great deal. A little textural crunch provided by the fresh carrots and vegetables plays off the doughy bites of the rice cake. The dumplings are made fresh and center this dish nicely.

I started this review with 4 stars in mind, but I love their soup!...I wouldn't argue with a 4 star review of E-Jo Korean Restaurant...The 3 star setting is drab, with 4-top tables occupying the square-box space. E-Jo is also my favorite spot for Kimchi. I love that they offer cabbage and radish kimchi. It is soup-specific banchan: the previously mentioned kimchis as well as peppers and ssamjang (miso chili paste),  work very well with the soups or as an appetizer before hand. Service was highly enjoyable, a perfect 5 stars for this type of establishment. So...In the end I'm deciding to go with 5 stars...I would on the basis of their soups alone, but throw in the kimchi and service and all of the sudden 4 starts doesn't seem to do justice.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,38,40,5,viSm0GMDOoD2MrbQy_mFiA

With that said, I have never been here. The Korean restaurants im used to are the cook it yourself all you can eat table top grill kinds. So I was curious as to how this place works.

From looking at the menu it looks simple enough. Everything has a number and is in Korean and English. Since I didn't really want to be that adventurous, I chose the #1 Beef Brisket Soup. It's your basic soup with Beef Brisket and Noodles. 

Now this is where I learned something new. You season the soup yourself meaning they don't put any spices whatsoever in it. On every table there are containers of salt with a mini spoon. For those that are looking for a low to no sodium meal, this is your soup to get! What I ended up doing was grabbing the meat from my soup and eating it with the steamed rice they give you. I would also mix in a little bit of the hot sauce and curry sauce that was provided as well as mild green peppers. 

What actually stole the show was the Kimchi. I have had it before but when I had some of theirs, it tasted really fresh. What I find out was that they make it themselves from scratch. That explains why it was so good. Definitely not from a jar you would be able to buy at Seafood City or Ranch Market.

Service was good. We had a sweet old lady that looked like she would not be able to understand us or speak English well. I was pleasantly surprised when she spoke perfectly good English to us. She was very helpful in answering any questions we threw at her.

As for the place and overall location, I gotta admit, I drive by this place all the time and never really noticed it. Shame on me. But then again, it is in a weird part of the east side of Sahara when most of the food places are on the west side. When you go inside, there are plenty of tables and chairs I would say for about 20 people.

Korean barbeque and tofu stew joints are aplenty in Spring Mountain, but E-Jo is one of those niche restaurants that specializes in slow cooked beef soups which  one rarely comes across unless you're in a city with a full-fledged Koreatown.
  
Don't be fooled by their limited menu offerings and the simplicity of their banchan since the old saying goes that it is far better to do a few things well than to do many things poorly.  They offer a variety of beef-based broths containing a variety of cuts ranging from brisket, oxtail, and tongue to a variety of other tender bits such as tripe, tendon, and intestine.  The broth has a milky white complexion that can only be achieved from boiling down beef bones for several hours under a low simmer achieving a rich and nourishing soup perfect for a cold winter day or when one is under the weather or post-hangover.   
Sea salt and pepper are provided at the table to adjust the broth to optimum taste and along with the choice of meat, some silky threads of somyeon (wheat flour) noodles and fresh green onion complete the dish.  

Accompaniments include a refreshing glass of barley tea, a few raw green peppers (not spicy, although they look like banana peppers, presumably as a palate cleanser?), and two artisan jars containing perhaps the best made-in-house kimchi in town in the form of radish and napa cabbage cut down table side to bite-size portions by one of the staff.  For the final fine-tuning of flavors, some ground red chili paste and additional green onion are provided for the broth and a spicy soybean paste and horseradish/wasabi based soy sauce for dipping the meats.  Other options include a few choices of grilled meats, nyangmyeon, and a soup with homemade dumplings/rice cakes which have also been well-received in other reviews.

Two days later and I still can't get over just how good it was...I love tendon and compared to pho, which has sparse amounts of meat with a lot of noodles, sul lung tang is the exact opposite (at LEAST 15 pieces). Dip that in their sauce that has a hint of horseradish (soooo good) and I was in heaven. The only thing I didn't really care for was the small amount of noodles in my sul lung tang - they were way too soft.

My friend's Korean boyfriend highly recommended this place for their sul lung tang as the best thing for hangovers, saying it was better than the places in LA which has an actual K-town. I've never had sul lung tang before, but I'm taking his word for it. The milky bone broth comes plain and you add salt, pepper, red pepper paste, and green onions to your liking. Not oily at all like how pho broth can be - definitely a healthy comfort food.

The ban chan here consists simply of two large clay pots of homemade radish and cabbage kimchi that you cut yourself, and a plate of fresh shishito peppers that you can dip in ssamjang. At first I was disappointed with the small variety, but oh my god that radish kimchi was BOMB. Pretty much finished that pot single-handedly, and radish kimchi is usually my least favorite type of kimchi. Their kimchi has a stronger anchovy taste which I personally really liked.

This mom and pop shop has won a special place in my heart.

Showed up around 10:30 AM on Dec. 18th, right after we picked up our rental car & picked up a few items at the CVS Store a few blocks down The Strip.

We ordered our usuals, the mixed seul long tang soup, and I decided to head over to the bathroom with my baby's bottle, which I'd just bought from CVS since I forgot her bottle back home.  Yup!  Being a new mom all over again after 14 years does some weird stuff to your brain!

When one of the waitresses saw me walking over towards the back, she asked me if I needed help and I told her I needed to find the bathroom to wash the baby's bottle and she told me she could take it to wash in the kitchen.  That was so sweet of her!

3065591,2015-02-20,1,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"So I am. Big fan of authenticity:: the soup has really no flavor til you add things to it:: such as salt, kimchi, and a ton of green onions.. 
Also, the portion for what you pay: ex. Ox Tail Soup is $15.99 :: was expensive in my opinion.. And is super small:: not very filling so I recommend getting a extra side order of something so the cost is around$30.00 per person:: for that price I can get a all you can eat some where.. I recommend coming here for a Korean experience... But worth it..  ??.. Depends on the person:: I would open a spot up with the same soup:: offer bigger portions with less price and home made kimchi and probably would put this place out of business...

3373452,2017-08-31,0,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"It has been sometime since I've come here. Not because this place isn't great but it's because its super far from me! I rarely am on this side of town.

In 2014, this place was first introduced to me by my friend. She has since moved back to her country but E-Jo will give me fond memories of her.

I came after class. It was a little busier than I remember it. But this is like a mom and pop store. They don't typically sell the tofu soup or the typical Korean BBQ dishes. So if you're looking for BBQ or Tofu soup, this place probably isn't it. 

I've tried the oxtail soup, the hangover soup, and the beef tongue soup. ALL WERE AMAZING! When you're feeling cold or need something to warm up the belly, this is the spot.

The oxtail soup was clear and full of flavor. Now, please keep in mind it's not seasoned. They give you sea salt on the side and some red sauce you can put in it or other things you can use to season it. I'd suggest 2.5 spoons of salt and some of that red pepper paste, not the dipping one! 

The hangover soup is probably my favorite dish. This one needs the least amount of seasoning because the soup itself has a lot of flavor. If you love a load of veggies, that is THE soup to go for. However, if you're not a brave soul and can't eat that pigs blood, don't do it. But I LOVE pigs blood.

The beef tongue was really great! I was hesitant in ordering this because through my experience, the beef tongue is usually very chewy if its cooked in soup. Well, I'm glad I picked this soup! Once again, adding 2.5 spoons of salt (lightly, not loaded spoon) and that red pepper paste it was full of flavor and delicious. The beef tongue was the softest beef tongue I've ever eaten! It was great! It also had a dipping sauce that my SO hogged so I didn't get much of it, but whatever I  had to dip it with was great!

I forgot about that bonchon, its pretty simple, but I LOVE their kimchi! Kimchi, raddish kimchi, and korean chili peppers. This place is the only one that does the korean chili peppers but i find myself craving these every so often and dipping it into that seasoned red pepper paste.

I asked her about the white chunky kimchi, because I've had the cabbage kind before. It is radish kimchi; they both were very tasty. 
When our soups came out, they tasted bland, so I put alot of salt, green onions, and chili into it, and it was delicious. I loved the oxtail as well as the broth- it was very substantial. All of the meat in the soup was good, and dipping it into the sauce provided helped the flavor of the more blander cuts.

4039905,2018-01-10,2,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"E-Jo is a Korean restaurant just a few minutes off the strip that specialize in soup and boiled meat. That sounds pretty boring, but trust me it's not! I literally wanted to walk out after seeing the menu but I'm glad I stayed. Soup? That's literally half of their menu. The other half consists of five typical Korean BBQ dishes.

They have a basic beef broth soup and a hangover soup that's spicy. You choose which meats you want in the soup and this gets served with a couple sides and rice. You add your own salt and spice. I read this while waiting to order and rolled my eyes, but I ended up loving this.

They also have a meat platter you can order in small or large that has the boiled meats on them.

Lastly they have a handful of KBBQ dishes like short ribs, chicken, or bulgogi.

This place has two sides: cabbage kimchi and radish kimchi. These two items are amazing. Best kimchi in Vegas. Super flavorful-basically perfect. They also serve these mild chili's with samjeon(sp).

I never thought I'd have Korean food at 8:30am, but E-Jo changed that for me. I came to E-Jo based on their yelp reviews alone. I didn't expect a restaurant to be filled with business men at 8:30am but they actually had a waiting list on the door! At 8:30am

I do give a shout out to the staff: two servers who were just on top of things. They did everything before I could think of it. Extra napkins, always full cups, always more rice, always checking. They cut up the kimchi for us and also explained how to eat the dishes we ordered. 

E-Jo is a simple place that does a handful of things very well. Their short ribs were $24.99 and served with rice and ban Chan. Sounds steep compared to an AYCE joint but this was definitely worth the price for it's quality. The food is served very quickly and service is very prompt. The place has very limited parking and is what I would consider a whole in the wall-no frills.

I was completely curious about the location in Chinatown across from ChinaMama because I don't read Korean...so when I saw the yelp listing - finally - with a picture of the building, I was thrilled to know what was inside!  Last week when my husband and I were headed downtown to the arepa cart, I noticed this E-Jo location for the first time...I've probably driven past it 100 times and never seen it... 

Yesterday, as the city baked in 110+ degree heat, I knew I wanted something cold for lunch - when I saw David S.'s review of this location and his mention of the cold buckwheat noodles in chilled soup, I had to go.  

There was one other table who'd just been seated when I arrived.  The server looked at me initially with great suspicion, which concerned me.  Once she saw me dig into the kimchis, she relaxed.  Actually, a gentleman from the other table came over and asked ""So? Do you like it?""  He explained he wasn't used to seeing 'folks like me' order the buckwheat noodles - he commended me for ordering such a healthy dish, too.   I thought it was brilliant.  I wasn't expecting the ice cubes to still be in the broth - but they were - this was unlike anything I'd ever had before - and I loved it.  Buckwheat noodles are chewy, so chewy they sort of bite back - in fact, I couldn't bite through them...those scissors for the kimchi came in extra handy.  Bottom line, this isn't a dish you can eat quickly...which is also why I loved it so.

Being it was a Tuesday evening there were only a couple of other patrons. I was greeted by the friendly Korean woman who immediately brought me ice tea which was refreshing. Being that E Jo is popular for their soups, I went with their combo soup which had 6 varieties of meat in a yummy broth and noodles. The soup included fresh tasty ban chan and rice.

Don't ask me the authentic names, I don't know them, but the pancake, beef with veggies, and the assorted beef soup were all incredible. I tried beef tongue and tendon for the first time, and thoroughly enjoyed both. The tendon is a bit gelatinous, and the tongue tastes just like any other cut of beef. We got two cold buckwheat noodle dishes, and I definitely prefered the broth preparation to the chili paste preparation. I WILL warn you however, that these noodles were EXTREMELY difficult to bite through. I took a big bite thinking that I could just bite them off, but I couldn't, and kind of wound up choking a little. The super kind server came rushing over to see if I was okay, or if the food was too spicy. And I was embarrassed. White chicks eating Korean food wrong. Boo.

I've heard about E-Jo through friends and fellow yelpers and decided to go last night with a coworker. We both got sizzling hot soups (Gomtang - brisket for me, oxtail for my coworker) and we split spicy buckwheat noodles (Bibimnaengmyun - cold noodles topped with spicy sauce, veggies, and boiled egg)

When I first got the soup, it looked fantastic and I had to dig in. I tasted it and my reaction showed how bland it was. My coworker pointed out the small bowl of salt crystals right in front of us (silly me for missing) that is supposed to be used to add salt to taste. That made a lot more sense to me and I added a small spoonful along with a sprinkle of pepper... My soup was DELISH!

The Kimchi and Kkakdugi (radish) were both very tasty and servers were quick to replenish. A large portion came in small ceramic bowls and you serve and cut them yourself - just like how they do it in soup restaurants in South Korea. We also had spicy Korean peppers to dip in Doenjang (miso paste) which is one of my favorite simple Korean sides.

The Bibimnaengmyun wasn't my favorite. The sauce tasted sweet to me which is extremely strange as this cold noodle dish is supposed to be spicy, not sweet (?) My coworker added more spicy paste to it and finished it off as I only cared for one bite.

1. The food is extremely expensive. Gomtang at LA usually goes for about 7$ and here it's $10. 
2. Customer service is horrible. We ordered a korean pancake and they said they ran out when we came here for breakfast. And they didn't provide anything to make up for it. 
3. We have a little baby in the family and asked if we could just have a small bowl of soup for her because she wasn't hungry to eat a lot. They said they can't give it for free and it costs half price of the adult bowl. At LA they always give a little to babies just for service. And when they gave it, it came with no meat. Just soup for like 5 bucks. 
4. The gontang soup tastes just okay. The soup is a little clear and it's because they use a lot of water and I can taste the msg in it. I'm gonna be super thirsty later. 
5. The one star only goes for the kkak doo gee (Korean kimchi radish) and the kimchee but I would not come again. 
Even after the horrible service, they still charged us for the little soup. 

This just shows that they want money and don't care about their customers because they have no competition. They're the only Korean restaurant around.

It's true. I've had the fortune of trying various spots in Korea that specialize and excel at a single dish. One such example is when my girlfriend's Dad took us to his favorite Seolleongtang restaurant. It's tough for any place in the US to top that experience, but E-Jo is more than good enough.

Keep in mind that Seolleongtang is meant to be seasoned at the table. You might even describe the broth as downright bland. If you prefer a stronger flavor, I recommend the Haejangguk, which my girlfriend ordered. In fact, the first time I tried Seolleongtang at a place in Garden Grove CA, I ultimately switched my bowl with her Haejangguk. This visit to E-Jo was a bit of déjà vu in that regard, except I stuck with my Seolleongtang this time around.

I should also mention that their kimchi (cabbage and radish) is excellent. I'm more of a ""new"" kimchi kind of person and I fully enjoyed E-Jo's. I'm already plotting a return as I type this.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,4,4,WSa0IMup8HfN8Y4ETLd6iA

Then after we ordered two of their soups she asked us if we wanted kimchi. What do you mean, would we like some? It's a Korean restaurant, of course we want kimchi. It's always a provided staple.

After reading his review several times decided to try this place. Love it. 

First is the green onions and chili paste for your soup. Peppers and dipping sauce that thankfully is not too hot and then bowls of kimchee the cabbage and radish. Love how you also have a plate to put the kimchee on and scissors to cut them. You can keep adding more kimchee as you eat them from the bowl.   The Kim Chee was absolutely awesome. 

We had the oxtail and the combo. They both come out very hot and you can add as much chili paste and green onions to your liking.

The oxtail was tasty and tender. I love to gnaw on the bones. The only thing I would say is a bit of veggies and bigger chunks of oxtail would make this an ideal meal for me. This was the first time I had oxtail soup instead if stew at a restaurant. I enjoyed this or at least the bits I could steal from the wife. 

The combo had brisket, tendon, tripe, and was tasty yet a bit sparse in terms of meat. I did not get any bones so next time I am trying the beef knee bone soup. Again I really enjoy more veggies in a soup as I make my own with pork bones , mushroom and cabbage. It adds to the overall consistency. Here I would say tasty yet anemic. Tasty though. 

I would like to give the 4.5 and will be back. I will try the 24.99 assorted boiled beef with some folks as I am sure you share this. 

Right now I would say that Soyo restaurant may have an edge on soups and plenty of banchan. I will be coming back to E-Jo to figure out what is what.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,2,3,5,H6ckpLj8GjV_qbr2RBVFmQ

Just so you all know where I'm coming from, I am born and bred Korean and having grown up near LA Koreatown, my standards for Korean food in the US is high. Since I was little, my family would take annual Vegas trips and it was a must for my parents to eat Korean food at least once during their trip. At the time, there was only one big restaurant (Shilla) and it was just OK. Now there are quite a few in Vegas but nothing had satisfied my Korean palette until E-Jo.

First of all, this is authentic Korean food - no fusion here. You come here really for one thing and one thing only - gomtang (), or boiled beef soup. The broth is warm, hearty, and flavorful. You can tell that this is broth that they slow cook for hours. Beef is very tender. The kimchi there is one of the best kimchi that I've eaten in a restaurant anywhere. 

Service is pretty good for the most part. On holidays or busy weekends, it can get a little crazy so you have to insist a little sometimes but certainly not bothersome. The other great thing is that it's located off the strip so it's not too much of a hassle to get there and the parking is reasonable to find.

E-Jo is all about authentic Korean beef bone soup.  Heavily extracted, boiled for hours until gelatinous and milky.  Incredible beef flavor with garlicky undertones.

Simply select from a flavorful list of brisket (well braised, stringy), tongue (braised and tender), knee (clean, gelatinous tendons), oxtail (fall off the bone with melting cartilage), tripe (well cleaned, no off smell, tender), or all of the above then adjust the seasoning with the provided salt, fermented chili paste, chili powder and scallions.  Done.

Only three banchan.  In-house made, incredible Napa cabbage and radish kim chee.  Deep flavor, good heat and just the right tingle of fermentation on the tongue.  A plate of fresh shishito peppers adds a vibrant, mild spice, green pepper foil made even better when dipped in a light but flavor enhancing soy garlic sauce.

There are a few other non soup items (spicy pork, chicken, etc).  Have not tried them.  

Prices for the soups are very reasonable ranging between $10 - $15.

A short list of shoju and Korean beer rounds out the meal.

Ok. I was in Vegas and it was raining. I was in the mood for some hot korean ""sul lung tang."" I thought I give the place a try again to my amazement, the soup tasted really good. Rich, tasty with beef/bone flavor. Hopefully it stays that way. Because I will be back during the superbowl weekend.  The service and the radish kimchee was excellent. Keep up the good work.  

Update : 9/19/2015
I was in town for a convention and decided to stop by and give them another try. 
I'm  sorry to say the soup is consistant with first my review below. 


I've been coming to this place for about good two years now. Whenever I'm in LV, I make an effort to stop and get my korean fix. Last time was during the superbowl weekend with my brothers.  We liked it so much we must have stopped by everyday.
Well, I'm sorry to say the quality has gone down.  We had lunch today with the family to everybodys disappointment. 

The traditional korean beef soup was watered down with no flavor.  My guess is the owner feels he can stretch the soup now that he is busier with better customer base sonce opening. Very bad mistake. He doesn't know that restaurant business can go down faster than it can be built up. 
The service is still friendly and good. The radish kimchee is still good. But the soup was very water down requiring more salt to taste. Very disappointed.  My advise is to go back to makimg the soup like you did before. Do not water down the soup. 
Also, not only the owner is cutting corners on the soup, but also on the beef. Its not a brisket. Its a combination of sliced cha dol, which is a cheapest of beef cut and a ribeye.  Not to mention they were skimpy on the portions. 

I will try again one more time and update my review.",kkulubGijzjBEipyQJ-YdQ,2,0,5,RhdBWszHy9QH-8CKEDlbXA

5349102,2013-11-26,1,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"I was actually between a 4 star and a 5 star but decided to go with the 5 star just because they had what I was looking for :)

I've been wanting some seolleongtang (broth made from bones) for a while now that the weather has been getting chillier. So when I yelped for this specific soup, E-Jo came up! And I know, I know, soondubu is just as good during the winter -- maybe even better cause it's spicy! But come on! Everywhere that's Korean in Vegas serves soondubu. Can we get some variety?!?!! 

Now that's what sets E-Jo apart from a lot of other Korean places. Because if you're looking for your typical Korean BBQ Restaurant joint that you're used to, this is definitely not it. E-Jo gives me the feeling of a mom and pop joint. What's better is that a majority of the items on their menu are new to me! 

When my friend and I arrived at E-Jo, the area around the restaurant was a little shady and quite dark. So being the paranoid me, I would say always go with someone. But right when we walked into the restaurant, we immediately got greeted in Korean. Not only that but she asked us how many in Korean too. I don't know about you but I was confused but still loved it. Nothing beats authenticity. 

The menu wasn't anything spectacular. It didn't have a trillion options for you to choose from and it was easy to follow. The waitress came by to take our orders and I just had to ask her, ""Do you have seolleongtang?"" Why would I ask that since some of the yelp reviews have confirmed it to be seolleongtang? Well, the menu didn't have it.

She pretty much told me, ""Yes and no."" Then she explained that their #1 on the menu, beef brisket soup, is very closed to seolleongtang however it's a little different. I couldn't really remember exactly what she said but she mentioned about the ingredients being a bit more expensive in their version but it's very close. With that, both my friend and I ordered their beef brisket soup for dinner. 

She gave us extra green onions, hot pepper paste, peppers, meat sauce, and bean paste (I think). As for banchan, there was only two: kimchi and spicy radish. I thought it was quite interesting because I've never been given actual peppers before and I have also never been given meat sauce or hot pepper paste when I ordered seolleongtang before. I'm not a big kimchi fan but even so, I find their kimchi to be very good. It looked and tasted fresh. I liked the radishes as well but I typically like radishes with more vinegar haha. 

Then our soup came -- relatively quick I might say. I do have a warning though. Those who are used to flavors, msg, and thick broths ... this isn't going to be like that. The beef brisket soup is, for the lack of a better word, bland. Or to us Chinese, we call it ""ching"" which is clean. But it's okay! For all you sodium lovers or those who just want a bit more flavor, there is salt on every table! You can adjust the salt to your liking, which is what I love most about this soup. And oh, she was right, their beef brisket soup is VERY close to seolleongtang. One of the differences I've noticed is that E-Jo's noodles are white versus the clear glass noodles I'm used to. Also, E-Jo's broth base seems a bit thinner compared to what I've had before. In the end, everything is dandy. I got to have what I've been craving for :D

Over all, awesome service tonight. Attentive workers. Yummy food. Win for me. I'm definitely coming back next time to try their oxtail soup while my friend wants to try the oxknee soup :)

The dimly lit restaurant made my sister initially curse, because she thought it was closed. 

Once we sat down, the waitress brought two cups of the iced barley tea. No chilled metal cups, but the tall plastic ones will do. 

The food is similar price to other Korean restaurants in Vegas, but that is the only similarity they share. The thing about E-Jo is that they do not serve the most common Korean soups, so you will not find kimchijjigae (kimchi soup) or soondubujjigae (spicy soft tofu soup). Instead they had a beef brisket (9.99), tripe, tongue, and an all of the above soup (13.99). My sister and I split the beef brisket and the cold buckwheat noodles in a chilled soup (9.99). The former was steaming hot with generous amounts of meat and noodles. It comes with a bowl of rice, a huge pot of cabbage and radish kimchi, and lots of green onions to sprinkle in. The best way to eat it is to throw your rice into the broth and add gochujang (the red chili paste). A dash of salt goes a long way too. Like seullongtang, you need to season it to your liking, otherwise it might be too bland. Another way I learned to eat it, in Korea, was to add a little bit of the juice from the radish kimchi. It might sound odd, but the taste is amazing. 

The naengmyeon is a true summer dish. The tangy vinegar beef broth is chilled with the addition of ice cubes. It comes with half a hard boiled egg, two pieces of brisket, pickled radish, cucumbers, and a horseradish mustard on the side. My sister has been complaining about how unbearable this heat was and she was relieved to devour this dish. The banchan are minimal, but what they do give is top notch. I almost inhaled both pots of kimchi and they do not skimp on the portion. There were also some cucumber peppers that are served with ssamjang (a mixture of garlic, red pepper and soybean paste).

5599551,2014-07-06,0,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"What up Yelp fam?!?  I know it's been a minute and figure it's time to break down a spot picked by none other than,  you (Yelpers, according to reviews)!  I bookmarked E-Jizzle based on the positive accolades of stand out Elitists, and the place didn't disappoint.  Not your typical Kornz joint you may be used to, but still worth a try.  

Now I'm no expert, by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems as though a lot of people think Korean restaurants all include DIY BBQ, Which is not the case at all. Although a misnomer, many people also refer to Korean BBQ as Yakiniku, which is Japanese Hibachi grilling (Oh Jah, Tanaka of Tokyo, Benihana, etc.).  Sorry, E-Jo does not fall into that category. 

E-Jo is a great place if you want some legit Korean food, minus the complication... No smelling or feeling like a fry cook and little fuss with the set menu.  Although limited, the menu gets down to the nitty gritty with their signature dishes.  They have a more expanded list of soup including knee bone, oxtail and I hear the assorted soup gives you a variety.  Otherwise, the entrees include your typical rib eye steak (bulgogi), spicy chicken (dakgalbi), and marinated beef short ribs (soegalbi our galbijim).  You may see a lot of places with ""Kalbi"" and I learned that ""k's"" are pronounced like a ""g,"" but could be wrong and invite insight from my Korean Yelpers. 

So The dishes were good and was kicked off by the fresh kim chee and daikon.  I suppose the only DIY was not the BBQ, but instead the ""cut your own Kim chee.""  The rest of the dishes (bulgogi, galbijim & dak galbi) were good and flavorful.  The bulgogi was on point and the spicy chicken and pork were delish too.  I recommend just sticKing to one or the other though since they are both made with gochujang.  The pleasant surprise was the extremely clean broth in the oxtail soup.  For the uninitiated, it is not salty and boasts natural beef bone flavor. 

The only disappointment was the absence of the vast array of appetizers (Banchan).  Instead if BBQ, banchan Signifies a legit Korean eatery in my opinion. Due to this, I had to drop my rating from a 3.75 to a 3.5, still rounding up to an overall score of 4 stars, according to Yelp.  I can't wait till Yelp incorporates half star ratings by reviewers instead of just overall ratings.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,0,2,4,z2GXignnknmjzmiEXvtuFQ

5659607,2015-06-10,2,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"There's something magical about their beef brisket soup. It's so plain and simple, basically just meat and noodles in broth, but always hits the spot once you add in the flake salt and chili paste! I also include a generous heap of green onion with mine. You get this little dish of vinegar sauce to dip your meat in, which adds to the taste as well. And with most Korean food, it comes with a bowl of rice.

The banchan includes only three items: green peppers with bean paste, radish kimchi, and cabbage kimchi. Just forget everything but the cabbage kimchi because it is literally the best kimchi I have ever had in Las Vegas. The flavor is so on point! It's never over-fermented either, which I hate. 

The price is a little steep (~$15) considering it's a very simple soup and you have to do some work yourself, so I don't come here too often. But when the craving hits, it hits hard! E-Jo will always have a special place in my heart...Err, stomach.

5752746,2014-08-11,0,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"So unfortunately the best Korean restaurant in town is on the east side, far far away from my house...  This place across the street from Commercial Center is, in my opinion, the best traditional Korean restaurant in Vegas, by a mile.  Most Korean restaurants are bbq places, and even those are just mediocre.  The only other specialty Korean seems to be tofu joints, except for this place which specializes in gomtang, a soup that is similar to sullungtang and cooked in bone marrow.  

They have parking in the back, but you have to walk around to the front to enter.  It is your typical Korean restaurant decor, which is to say it's not much to speak of.  Service is friendly and speedy.  The menu consists of a various type of gomtang (different main ingredient) and several other popular Korean dishes.  Although oxtail gomtang is one of my favorite dish, we opt for a combination gomtang and a naengmyun.  I'm guessing the gomtang is already made, but perhaps because of naengmyun preparation both dishes take about 10 minutes to come out.

The naengmyun is quite good, with nicely flavored and cold soup.  Wish there was a tad more brisket slices in it though, but otherwise very satisfying.  The gomtang soup tasted great also, and the accompanying kimchi and radish kimchi (kkakdugi) were outstanding.  The kimchi is quite sweet, but I actually liked it.  I am definitely getting the oxtail gomtang next time.

I've probably tried 90% of Korean restaurants in Vegas, and it's not an impressive lot overall except Soyo which is very good, K-bop which is satisfying, and couple in Commercial Center that have a handful of good dishes.  So this one is a keeper, with great service and food on par with typically good places in L.A.  It's a solid 4 stars.

5825230,2016-06-21,8,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"Wow I was very impressed with E-Jo. Initially I thought they had sulungtang, but they actually don't, what they do have is Gom Tang (Korean oxtail soup), labeled as ""Brisket Beef Soup"" or #1 on the menu. The brisket was very tender, and the soup was flavorful & creamy (don't forget to add green onions and salt which is provided on the side). For sides, they give you regular kimchi, radish kimchi, and Korean green bell peppers (not spicy) which are all very tasty!

My friend ordered the cold noodles with soup: yummy! Broth is vinegary and tangy, delicious. Perfect for the insanely hot weather in Vegas... Although the noodles were just OK (not super Q/chewy), it passed for my lower expectations since we're in Vegas, not Ktown Los Angeles.

5918709,2013-10-24,10,KNTjauGqmib3sG1HWJyKEQ,"I don't live or work in this part of town, so when I do travel this way it is usually to go to one of the restaurants in the nearby Commercial Center or simply passing through.  So over the years I have driven past this unassuming restaurant that practically blends in with the other random businesses on this stretch of E Sahara, and never really given it a second thought.  So I am glad that we the typical question about where to get dinner ultimately lead us to E-Jo Korean Restaurant.

Their menu is pleasantly simple. Just 2 pages worth, and almost all of it is dedicated to the various traditional Korean soups not found at other Korean restaurants. These soups are the final product of hours of slow simmering to extract the flavors from the beef bones used in its preparation.  You can order the soup according to the meats and other ingredients that you want served in it.  If you are a beginner, then go with item #1 (Brisket Beef Soup for $9.99). If you are adventurous, then order item #8 (Their Combination Beef Soup with all the ingredients listed in items 1-7).

The soups themselves are what many would considered bland, but that is completely intentional. And sea salt is available on the table for diners to adjust their soup to their individual taste (very good for individuals with high blood pressure or are on a low sodium diet, since it is easy to add salt but impossible to get it out).  Besides that, there are Korean spicy chili paste and another soybean paste and garlic mixture for flavoring the soup or as a dip for the cucumber chili (most were not spicy, but there were a few that did packed some heat, so be careful if you don't like it too spicy).

In the end I opted for item #3 (Beef Knee Bone Soup with Tendon, $13.99).  If you like soft tendons, there are a lot of it in here, but no other pieces of beef.  Overall, this alone was just okay for me even with all of the tinkering that went into fine tuning my soup.

The surprised highlight of the meal for me and probably everyone I ate with (Michael K and Roger T) is the restaurant's house made kimchi (2 varieties: radish and cabbage).  As far as banchans are concerned relative to other Korean restaurants, the selection is minimal.  However, what the E-Jo lack in kimchi selections is more than make up by the quality and flavors that they packed.  I will be happy with a few servings of rice and their kimchi, and maybe just a small bowl of soup or side order of Stir Fried Ribeye or Spicy Pork.  The kimchis are that mind blowningly good!  Forget the other K-Restaurant's commercially sourced industrial kimchis.  I want E-Jo's artisanal kimchi goodness!

Service was friendly and efficient. The food came out with nominal wait time.  You can help yourself to as much kimchi as you want.  However, be polite and considerate and get the kimchi out of the jar with the provided tongs and put it on the serving plate first (no ones wants your cootie crossed contaminated double dipped leftover kimchi, not even your GF or BF).

In the mood to drink responsibly?  They offer, you guessed it, Soju!  Plus Korean beers and rice wines and soda for me.

For entertainment, besides staring at your iPhone or Android devices and neglecting your dining companions (okay if you are Yelping, but only because I am Yelping too), catch up on Korean programming of the variety show category on their TV (at least that was what was on at the time of my visit).  

Afraid of ordering wrong because you are not Korean, can't speak Korean, but you still want to madly impressed your Korean GF or just being  culinaryly (I am making up words because of their kimchi) adventurous minus the requisite language skill, have no fear! pictures of menu items are on the wall for easy visual reference.  Or just ask the restaurant staff taking your order, silly.

(Getting the frantic hand signals to wrap it up)

E-Jo, a good Korean soup restaurant to visit, especially as the thermometer starts dipping towards your feet.  Lastly, awesome kimchi!

4 stars! **** out of *****

Trivial observation: Their soups all look the same to me here.  But I can assure you I am not a soup racist. I have had soups from many culinary traditions in the past. Just the other day I thoroughly enjoyed a miso soup, and before that an Italian Wedding Soup, and a very invigorating cold Borscht from Russia (or was it or Ukrainian origin) just over the summer. My point is I am not a soup racist.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,10,9,4,pPGCeZd6tYrzCEtQiXa93Q

I just don't like the texture of those inside my mouth. We also ordered sooyook which is basically thinly sliced braised beef or pork, in this case it was beef and they also served with cartilage and dipping sauce.

For the beef brisket soup, I actually felt bad for it not reaching my expectations after all the hype in all the other reviews about it. Everything else was tasty and the staff were friendly, so I just felt bad for thinking it tasted bland. I was probably doing something extremely wrong though, because I read a few more reviews and apparently we should be adding things to the soup.... my bad. I guess I just need to figure out the combination of additional things to add. With all our food items, we had green chili peppers, a sauce that tasted like soy sauce mixed with wasabi, soy bean paste, and chili paste. There's also pepper and flaky looking salt (presumably MSG, at least that's what it tasted like).

Although very friendly like I said, the staff wasn't too quick about giving us our check until we asked, which was okay for us, but may annoy some people.

The server was super friendly and tried to accommodate our large group. She even held an empty table for us because we said more of our group was coming. Although the service was great, the food was disappointing. I had Mul Naengmyun, one of my favorite Korean dishes and something you would think is perfect for the Las Vegas heat. The noodles were not cold enough and they just didn't seem to be the best quality. The broth left something to be desired.

I also took a few bites of his spicy BBQ chicken. I'd recommend you pass on that dish as well.
