1717612,2012-08-12,1,ckc3l8cSuggloG4NlquEFQ,"Unbelievable find at the Las Vegas-NORTH food court. I always get my Subway, but decided to go a different route that day. To my surprise, this Las Vegas Great Steak & Potato was pretty good and super bang for the buck. I never really seen a Great Steak & Potato serve such a big sandwich. So, a LARGE great steak sandwich is $10, but it is like more than a foot long. So if you are resting your foot from a marathon day of shopping at the Las Vegas-NORTH outlet, you can re-energize with a LARGE great steak sandwich and order of fries. If you need more flavoring, you can sprinkle their extra seasoning.",B856VSGCvHAB-mil7JVprA,0,0,3,lkNdJhBa08S88Wrg-biKFA
