26119,2017-02-03,0,E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw,"Excellent meal! Great little bistro with a very French vibe. Made reservations for 7:00 on a week night. We were seated right away. The owner, Richard, was great. Discussed our time in France with him and he made recommendations for our meal. 

Started with the cheese, honey and pistachio tartine and a meat and cheese platter. Baguette was perfect! Cheeses were fresh and tasty. Sausage was very flavorful. 

Next we had the salad lyonnaise. Easily my favorite French salad with onions and bacon. Dressing and egg were done perfectly. 

For entrees, my wife had the special which was similar to a potato au gratin dish. Very rich, very cheesy. It was served with small salad to break up the heaviness. I had the lamb which was seasoned perfectly but just a tad over cooked. I ordered it medium rare but it was probably medium. The carrots and potatoes served with it were excellent. We also had the fried zucchini which had a very fresh taste but was just a touch under seasoned. 

Dessert was the chocolate mousse with a touch of orange. Super smooth and silky with just a hint of orange. 

Overall a very good experience. Richard was fun to talk to and food was great! They probably need one more person to help with service but this place is fantastic. Can't wait to go back!",a88IGZ0P0YRXePKi0UKARw,0,1,4,3Z-XPvCP3OQTT0zeiB3h4Q

We had a couple cheese appetizers.  The food was amazing.  Pistachio goat cheese & the baked Brie made for a great combination to start.  One had a roasted garlic side.  So yummy.  Had a burger for my entree, also with Brie, bacon, and onions.  Great flavors, & along with the gratin potato side made for a perfectly balanced meal.

Our waiter, Nino helped us select a bottle of red wine...excellent choice, which went very well with everything we ordered.  The brie and garlic tartine, dates, and French onion soup were delicious appetizers, and we were almost full after that, but we just had to share an entrée.  The owner, Richard, recommended the mussels, which were tender, sweet, with just enough broth to dip your bread in.  By that time we were savoring all the flavors dancing around in our mouth, but of course, we had to order dessert too.  We ordered the Tiramisu to go.  The restaurant is small and quaint.

There are people-mostly couples- with smiles on their face, like they just got engaged near the Eiffel tower shines its bright and romantic beams. You enter the restaurant and the dark, private atmosphere surrounds you. Trying to pronounce the french menu just makes you cringe a little. As an American, skipping the small talk and going straight to entrees is a norm and proud of it very much. Bavette à L'echalotte's medium steak with the scent of red wine enlightens your tongue like a french revolution. There's no extraordinary experience as this you can find in Summerlin.

1513654,2017-09-16,0,E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw,"Finally someone (owner Richard) that understands that French food doesn't always have to mean complicated, ""shi-shi"" and expensive.
The food is simple, authentic classic French. It lacks in pretention (which is great) and delivers precisely what it promises. (I bet you won't find a Sous Vide machine in that kitchen! thank god.)
It's moderately priced for French food and while you are not going to get a Guy Savoie meal there, it's also not trying to sell itself as one just because it's ""French"".
The décor and atmosphere are great. 
They also offer a nice wine selection and staff seems well trained and knowledgeable enough.
The owner Richard is as friendly as can be. He pays personal attention to every single table in the dining room and much like the food he serves, his personality is without unnecessary pretention. 
For instance, the Steak Au Poivre is always great and has that wonderful ""crust"" without compromising the perfect inside temperature and doneness. Better than what you get in some fancy expensive steakhouses in this town.

Having said all that - I did take one star off and here's why:
It's wonderful that the concept is simple and authentic. However, even simple food should be prepared with attention to details and the best ingredients. I find that there is still room for improvement on those levels.
Example: The cheese platter. The simplest thing to ""prepare"", as no cooking is involved. It's success relies entirely on the quality of products you put on the platter. Not all of the cheeses offered there deserve to be on that plate. Same thing goes for their charcuterie platter.
Overall, some dishes suffered form being under salted and some were over salted. (and some were perfect - but they should all always be perfectly seasoned).
Perhaps with just a little more training and attention to details and quality control of ingredients, they could rise higher and I'll gladly give them that 5th star.",x_eztqDB2mvZ5uTP5v3NUA,0,0,4,cCteNCLFpz8ObKNUkYFFMA
1543842,2017-02-16,0,E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw,"Hubby and I popped in here the other night without reservations and with light appetites, and ended up happy, full, and pleasantly surprised.

Hubby had already eaten dinner, his way of waiting while I got my nails done, so I was at a loss for what to choose for dinner. I have a light appetite and it's not easy to find good adult food in children's meal portions. I decided that I wanted deviled eggs and did a Yelp search, and found this previously unknown spot that has deviled eggs. Once I read the appetizer menu to Hubby, wheels were turning and we were on our way.

We were seated promptly, without reservations, a mistake that I'll try to avoid in the future. While they managed to fit in a lot of seating in a small space, I'm going to assume that reservations will keep us from sitting next to the front door and getting chilled every time someone exited/entered. This place got packed quickly, which meant a lot of shivers and food shielding in last night's chilly breeze.

Hubby wanted to try a few items, and the prices are positively cheap (except the Coke, but I'll get back to that), so we ordered 3 appetizers. 

First, the deviled eggs... very creamy and quite excellent, needed only a light touch of salt.
Second, escargot. Mistakenly served without toast, server blip (also for later), but tasty once we had that. A bit on the chewy side, but still good. Without that deficiency, would have been great. Probably won't order again.
Thirdly, beef tartare. Served with too little toast (blip time again, also corrected) but very good. Different from others we have had in that it was strong with the taste of pickles and the beef taste was overpowered. It was yummy, but would be more accurately named pickle & beef spread. We still ate every bit of it.

Lastly, our split entree of Pasta Carbonara.. excellent! Incredibly creamy and well-balanced, a refreshing change from the usual canned alfredo+egg sauce that others claim to be carbonara. (You'd never guess my depth of hatred for the standard Alfredo sauce and its imitators. A proliferation of bad taste doesn't equal good taste). Anyway, back to this dish... we were both stuffed by this point, and yet we were ready to lick our plates. Yummy!

Now, about the Coke price. Yes, I realize this is a wine restaurant. Probably an excellent wine restaurant, based on the quantities of wine we saw the other customers downing. However, punishing non drinkers with a $3 charge for a can of Coke is ridiculous. Charging that for a fountain drink would have been even worse, thank you for not adding that indignity. Yes, I know that these high fees for a cheap product has become the industry standard, but that's not going to make me like it. Pet peeve, sorry.

As for the ""blip"", our waitress apparently had an asthma attack and was laying down in the back while she waited for her boyfriend to rush her forgotten inhaler to her. We understand and forgive, and we're very impressed with how much everyone else scrambled to cover an entirely packed restaurant. 

Speaking of the staff, absolutely everyone was gracious and charming. Everyone I could see was happy and smiling, they charmed a packed restaurant into satisfied patience. I even saw a cranky toddler charmed into smiling.

Based on that night's dinner, we will be returning and it will be soon. Next time, though, I'll make reservations and an extra sweater, just in case.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,3,2,4,IKZ2dpS8gEGAVDOnWOCJnw

1781319,2016-10-31,16,E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw,"It isn't hard to find a ""French bistro"" style restaurant in this town, but it's not as common to find one frequented by actual French customers. My guy and I came in for dinner and were some of the only folks here who weren't fluently conversing with the owners. We tried several menu items and they were fairly good but unfortunately nothing left us clamoring for more. Perhaps I'm just used to Americanized takes on French dishes though.

The highlight is definitely the homemade bread, which was frequently and cheerfully replenished. The French onion soup is made with a vegetable broth for a more subtle flavor- perhaps serving this in a deeper bowl with thinner crostini would yield more of actual onions, which were meltingly delicious. The escargots and mussels seemed thrown together; the onions and garlic used in both dishes was barely cooked and the sauces did not have a developed flavor. The beef tartare and baked brie were okay, but the execution lacked finesse, like individual ingredients put on a plate together rather than cohesive dishes. My guy said he really liked the contrast of the creme caramel dessert paired with his espresso, and the pricing is very reasonable. We stuck to dishes we're familiar with and were surprised that we weren't more impressed, but will likely be making trips back for lunch tartines or dinner entrees.

The attentive service and beautiful location make this a good date-night spot. They appear to have a happy hour for drink specials, and most other diners were enjoying a glass or bottle of wine. Per management, they will be introducing a brunch menu within the next month!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,28,15,3,2rmxN53UdN5x41Ms_e2j3A

Started with the cold zucchini soup with herb and garlic goat cheese and dash of pistachios, which was on special that day. Hard dish to pull off, but the pistachios pulled it together, offering a salty roasted crunch in a light cold soup.

Beet salad followed, topped with mandarin oranges, goat cheese, and drizzled with vinaigrette. Nice light salad perfect for a hot day.

Chose the Moules Marinieres for the entree. Healthy portion, not over cooked, and great taste.

Finished with an espresso and Tiramisu. Nothing to write home about, but it was done well and satisfied the sweet tooth.

2420459,2017-08-03,3,E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw,"Ohlala is a very tasteful restaurant both menu and interior atmospherically-wise.

I got the escargot and flat steak redwine with shoe string fries. The steak was a little bit chewy but cooked perfectly medium rare, and the redwine sauce was not bad. The shoe string fries that accompanies the dish is really good has a good crisp to it.

The escargot is probably the best part, and for 9 bucks is a really good deal. The snail is cooked nicely in butter garlic and parsley and comes with 9 pieces and bruschetta bites and soft butter. The problem with most escargot though is that over cooked can make it chewy and some might taste a little gamey. Fortunately though the escargot here was awesome, and had no gamey flavor that I noticed.

We also got the flan as a free dessert option which had a really good flavor but was a little bit too firm than I usually preferred, still you can't argue with free dessert. 

Oh and did I mention the bathrooms? When you walk in you are surrounded by mirrors on all walls giving you a very sky high Yayoi Kusama installation feel. I swear it was like I was peeing in the aftermath of obliteration of eternity haha. Definitely a cool bathroom.

2468734,2016-11-08,7,E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw,"""When you learn to accept instead of expect, you'll have fewer disappointments."" 

I was excited to check out Ohlala French Bistro. I'm a fan of Big Horn Olive Oil Company, where on a recent visit I saw and heard good things from another patron about Ohlala. Ohlala French Bistro is a local neighborhood kind-of-spot...one where the owner and servers care about the guests that come in and desire to connect to the clientele. We enjoyed our interaction with the owner very much and the food was a perfect 3 out of 5 stars, precisely A-OK.

We took the opportunity to try their Warm Crusted Pistachio Goat Cheese, Moules Mariniere, Large Beef Tartare, and Carmel Flan. 

The standout item for us was the Warm Crusted Pistachio Goat Cheese. This baked cheese dish is warming to the body and taste buds. The honey and onion confit jam caramelize nicely and add a sweetness with balanced savory aspects that work well with the goat cheese. The Moules Mariniere was the healthiest 1 lb. portion I have seen in a long while. The broth was not as robust as others I am accustomed to. In fact it required that you used the salted French Fries that come with the dish to maintain an adequate level of flavor. This could have been the Chef's intention, but adding salt at the end in this way limits the potential and flexibility of the dish. The large portion of the Beef Tartare was in fact large. It is done in what I understand to be a French style where the meat is ground as opposed to the chopped filet versions we more commonly see in the US. This style will probably through some patrons for a loop, while others will be fine with it. The flavors were good with capers, mustard, shallot, and pickles coming through nicely. Finally, we shared a Carmel Flan...free with a Yelp Check-in and the purchase of an entrée.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,18,16,3,8zm3JomlED6BZeoyoWVzsQ

It is right next to a Starbucks in a small mall. I was confused for a second, because the Starbucks drive through wraps around the whole building and was thinking, ""They have a drive through?"" :)

Walking through the door, OFB did a great job using a small space. It has a nice little bar, a few tables well spaced out, and well decorated. It was a full house, so I grabbed a seat at the bar.

The bartender (who I think is the owner) was very nice and took my order of the Bavette a L'echalotte. While I was waiting, they brought out a baguette and butter. It was okay, but nothing to write home about.

The Bavette a L'echalotte was okay. I had asked for medium, but it was served well done. The steak was also quite small. It was seasoned well, but just overcooked and not much of it. The shallot sauce it came with was great, and the frites were good too.

Located on a small plaza near Starbucks this place is composed of around 40 seats and a nice bar. The decor is simple and cosy with a nice view on a windowed cave with all their wine selection. Mostly French but not only.

Richard, the French owner, greets you when you come in and take you to your table. He always make you feel very welcome and at home.

The menu is everything you can expect from a French bistro :
- platers with selections of cheese and/or charcuterie
- escargots cooked in a perseillade butter
- French onion soup topped with Gruyère cheese
- Beef bavette with shallots 
- Slow cooked lamb
- Pasta alla carbonara
- Beef tartare...

The 4 of us ordered a mix and match plater to start with and a nice bottle of french Rosé. It was composed with Gruyère cheese slices and Brie for the cheesy side and Rosette de Lyon and Saucisson sec for the deli side that are all French specialty.
Than we shared the goat cheese malted with caramelized onions, pistachio and honey that is my really favorite of all the dishes they offer. So much flavor and nice combination. 

Had the endive salad with candied walnuts with a nice dressing. My friends had the hachis parmentier (beef with mashed potatoes au gratin), the moules marinières (cooked in white wine and shallots) with skinny crispy French fries, the special of the day that was Boudin noir (black bloody sausage with mashed potatoes and roasted apple). Everybody loved their food.

We tried all the deserts : Tiramisu, crème caramel and zesty orange mousse au chocolat. Fab !

The egg sandwich had some delectable bread and tasty anchovies which complimented the bread to no end.  They even served complimentary baguette to begin a meal, very rare at lunch.  Service was heavy but not intrusive at all.  I will surely be back for their Happy Hour which offers wine and charcuterie, or even for dinner to try some authentic French food at an affordable price. Ohlala is a must in this area.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,0,5,CxO-cH99vjtJmSjmu2aFTA

Service was impeccable and friendly. Pellegrino with lime was served upon being seated. Olive oil & herb bread came shortly thereafter. My hubby ordered French onion soup which tasted homemade. My salad with encrusted goat cheese was the perfect combo of tangy, fresh & savory. Hubby had the steak with frites, which came with an onion jam to die for. I had the French version of shepherds pie, very filling and seasoned nicely. Richard, the owner, sent out a crock of warmed goat cheese with caramelized onions & honey. I will be dreaming about coming back for that dish, as well as for the tiramisu, seriously the best tiramisu I've ever had.

We ordered a glass of red and a white wine. The white wine is Cleebourg Riesling Vin d' alsace, it was enticing and paired well with my food. Bread and butter were brought to the table. For starters, we had one of their specials which was Blood Sausage with mashed potatoes and it was well-prepared. For entree, we had the Lamb Brochette which is marinated lamb in garlic and rosemary with roasted potatoes.

The decor is nice and the atmosphere pleasant, wasn't too loud. The place is small. It's an adult restaurant, so please do not come up with a kids menu. Please!!!
Recommend a reservation: thank you for getting into the OpenTable system!
I recommend the reservation because the place is new and appears understaffed.
Got the sense that each table order is managed as it comes in by the kitchen.
So a party of 4 could destabilize the flow. The place was packed at 6h30, so the first wave must have walked in at the 5pm opening.
Menu is varied and all items were good and fresh. Waiter knew each item.
We shared the charcuterie board and the escargots. The French baguette basket was...French!!
My moules poulette were perfectly cooked and the bavette a l'echalotte of 2 guests was cooked perfectly, as was the lamb.

Our Entrees were the Lamb Brochette and the Carbonara Pasta.
My husband had the Lamb, and he said it was nicely cooked and presented, and the potatoes were seasoned well.
I had read a Yelp review that did not paint a very flattering picture of the Carbonara Pasta, and I was a bit hesitant to try it....... Mine was fabulous!

At first we were not entirely sure but they had their menu posted by the door and we thought why not.  The menu items looked promising and we went inside. 
It's a small space but they managed to make it work great with only a few tables and a bar. The ambiance was casual with dark lighting and fun decorations that made it seem like an ideal spot to bring your SO for a romantic dinner date or a relaxing spot to hang out and catch up with old friends. 
    For our appetizer we ended up ordering the Escargot ($9). Having never tried but always wanted to eat escargot I was super excited. They came out and were delicious. We couldn't get enough of their garlic parsley butter and after we were finished with the escargot we soaked up the butter with their delicious fresh bread that accompanies the table, which they refill quickly. 
    For dinner I ordered the Prawns Brochette ($15) and my friend ordered the  Moules Poulette ($19). The prawn salad was delicious, although the anise liquor they used to flambe was a tad over powering it was still a delicious meal and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. The mussels were to die for and I kept grabbing a couple here and there from my friends plate! They were so tender they melted in your mouth, so delicious! And the white wine broth was also great so we used more of their bread to soak up the broth. I loved how it was loaded with shallots and garlic. 
    For dessert, we used the free dessert coupon from Yelp from checking in and we were not disappointed. We ended up getting the chocolate mousse and it was very tasty.

We arrived around 7:20 PM and the restaurant had 2 big parties. We were told to wait about 30 minutes, but it took more like an hour. However, we were drinking wine so we were not very concerned about the time. 

Once we finally got a table we ordered some appetizers. We got some escargot, beef tartare and sausage/cheese platter. The escargot was well seasoned with garlic and butter, I would recommend this dish. The beef tartare was a large portion and great for sharing. This dish was good, but it's not a dish for everyone. And last we had the cheese and sausage platter which was very standard. I didn't care much about the sausage but the cheese was fresh. So far we were happy with our wine and appetizers. 

Once we got our main entrees, thats when the disappointment kicked in. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara which had tons of large slices of onions. The sauce was under seasoned and all I could taste were the onions. Definitely not a fan of huge onions on my dish. My friend ordered the lamb pasta dish. It was pretty much 3 small chucks of lamb and under seasoned pasta. We also had the prawns dish which came with 6 shrimps under a bed of frense salad. This looked more like an appetizer than a main entree.

4722067,2018-02-15,0,E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw,"We had such a good time here.  This was my first visit to a French bistro (unless you count marche bacchus a bistro).  It's a great little place with about 8 tables in a slightly hidden location, which makes it even better when you find it.  The décor is dark, the vibe is cozy and it's noisy.  We had 7pm reservations as a party of 4 with 2 of that party running late.  So the wife and I decided to get the wine and appetizers going.  The wine list is very reasonable and accessible, focused on a few French and California wines.  I let our server know that I don't prefer dry French reds and she picked out a bottle.  The Saint Emilion Grand Cru 2012.  Basically a cab-merlot mix.  It was a great choice.  The waitress brought the wine, some bread and water, and 15 minutes later the rest of our party still wasn't there.  I asked our server if she would hold the apps until our party was all there.  I shouldn't have done that, because just as soon as she went in to the kitchen to do as I had asked, our friends finally show up.  Our server noticed right away and got things going again.  I felt bad b/c I thought I may have thrown off her flow, but she recovered and I don't think it was too huge a faux pas.  We ordered some more wine and had:

Smoked salmon tartine - just as you would think.  Salmon, cream cheese, toast

La France board - not the largest size on the menu, but was enough for 4 people to sample everything.  Highlights were the duck slices and the pate.  Everyone enjoyed the mustard served in the little ramekin.

Beef tartare - so good. the capers and shallots and egg and garlic were all present and made for a great bite.

Salad Lyonnaise - skillfully dressed so that the soft egg didn't get the greens too mushy, although frise will stand up to a lot.  This was a very good salad.

Sole Meuniere - cooked correctly, but to me the capers lost their brininess after being fried.  I was looking for some lemon or acid to balance all that butter.

Mussels marinieres - I didn't have any of these, but they all got eaten.

Crème brulee - very creamy with the cackling top.  As expected.

this was a really great dining experience.  The prices are not just reasonable, they're a value.  So we were happy to go deeper into the menu instead of thinking of the bill and shying away.  The food was fresh and enjoyable and I left full, but not stuffed - which is the French way, no?",rBGStJwT8F31ZKfxR-3LDg,0,0,5,Jd0q-gm78lANnkiVoTSiVg

The owner, Richard, is friendly and welcoming, and his wait staff is consistent in their attentiveness without being overbearing or intrusive. Their wine list is quite good and offers a nice selection of wines by the glass to suit any palate and entree. We've enjoyed their Bavette steak (similar to steak frites) many times, and their onion soup is not to be missed. Their heirloom tomato salad when on the specials list is excellent as well. Just a consistently great restaurant, hidden away in the Starbucks shopping center on the southeast corner of Rampart and Lake Mead.

4820478,2017-12-03,0,E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw,"Cute little gem tucked away in Summerlin. Romantic, chic atmosphere, great for date nights or family outing. So many great selections from the menu that I wish I had 3 stomachs to try all of it. 

French onion soup: Love that the bread was on top instead of soaking on the bottom, but only downside is that there wasn't much cheese. The cheese was all absorbed by the bread.

Escargots: I've had better but maybe that's because I'm use to the pesto kind of sauce that goes with it. The escargot from here was cooked with onions.

Mussels in white wine: GET EM!! Mussels were perfectly cooked. Still plump and juicy. 

Carbonara: such a cute concept with the raw egg placed in a half egg shell to be poured on to the hot pasta and mixed in. The bacon bits were not that fatty either and had a thickness to them. Definitely worth the $15. 

Lamb shank: the seasoning/glaze was too sweet for my liking, but I did like how soft the meat was. It tasted like it was slow cooked for hours. If you don't mind a sweet glaze, try this one.",cLFOKo3WRtsK4oB6yAPw8A,2,0,5,oi5XNADQwWS4X4qBXqOvqQ

The escargot, french onion soup, charcuterie plank, brie and goat cheese were outstanding, the deviled eggs were only fair.  They made one mistake and forgot to put in my wife's order of salmon, but made up for it by rushing one out and comping the item.  The order of mussels was huge.

5279398,2018-06-18,4,E9HkUYYO_-5vKjvBwLuDIw,"Described as a modern French Bistro near Desert Shores in Summerlin Ohlala has done a remarkable job of accruing good word of mouth for nearly two years despite a lack of advertising, its shopping plaza location not really standing out save for Nittaya's Secret Kitchen though that may actually be part of the reason as such a space allows for both modest prices and expectations.

Not exactly a ""destination"" part of Sin City, the proliferation of chains in an HOA-heavy 'burb well-suited to moneyed clientele that likely feels the epitome of dining in Paris is a smoky Café along the Seine, Ohlala French Bistro is operated by Richard Terzaghi who last owned an Osteria in San Francisco, the owner's ""half French-half Italian"" background announced unprompted when explaining why the Restaurant features Mozzarella on its Cheese Plate and Tiramisu on the Dessert Menu.

Filling a prior Restaurant space next to Starbucks, the décor a mish-mash of Pier One ideas, chandeliers and seating ranging from steel bar stools to plush leather banquets, it was shortly after 7/8 of the group was seated that Beverages were poured and Specials described, Richard himself a charming front-of-house sort that genuinely seems to care about customer experience. 

Offering a smallish Wine List divided between France and California with fair markups and Food that focuses on France with occasional diversions it was after the final diner arrived that two sharable plates were served alongside outsourced Baguette, the ""Royal Charcuterie"" a great value allowing all to get a taste of eight different Meats for just $27 while ""Le Tout Cheese"" brought only one highlight in the ""stinky French"" Reblochon that apparently warranted three mentions, the rest nothing better than one might find at Walmart and not done any favors by the lone condiment of Pickles.

Most impressed by the smoked Duck amongst the Meats, a plate of Escargot ordered by someone who feigned knowledge of ""real"" French Food but only ate one Snail smothered in Butter and Herbs also showing well, suffice it to say that although edible the French Onion Soup is in desperate need of some Salt or Beef to match-up against the likes of Bardot or Andre's while ""L'Endive"" Salad is far more bitter than it reads thanks too questionable ""candying"" of the Nuts and Mustard in its Dressing.

Sharing Appetizers but ordering Mains separate, the lack of Duck on Summer's menu a disappointment to many, it was after considering $32 Lamb which others seemed to enjoy that the decision was made to instead select Sole Meunière, the Escargot-ordering aficionado declaring it ""too buttery"" while three others including this writer found it nicely prepared and well-balanced by Capers and Citrus, though the limp Asparagus would have benefitted from a little less cooking time.

Allowed to taste another diner's Fettuccine Carbonara before moving onto Dessert, the heavy use of Cream and thus unnecessary Egg Yolk creating something far richer than delicious and utterly confusing as relates to ""authenticity,"" it was with a Double Espresso from Illy washing the palate that a Sundae of outsourced Ice Cream and housemade toppings was served in a Jar, nothing about it remarkable or worth $9 but still a fine Sundae.

THREE STARS:  Positioned in an area lacking for quality Restaurants Ohlala capitalizes by serving French Classics at a fair price, the results generally good and service exemplary though most dishes fall short in one way or another while décor and ambiance leave a lot to be desired compared to Andre's or Marche Bacchus , let alone Bouchon and Bardot.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,6,3,t-gegWBwEddePAwuY4OUWA
