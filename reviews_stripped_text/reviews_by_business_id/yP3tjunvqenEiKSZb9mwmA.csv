on the table i noticed that the napkins were placed in napkin rings...impressive.  the bread here was fabulous.  its called monkey bread.  the muffin looking like bread was slightly firm on the outside with a cross cut on top.  the bread breaks perfectly into 4 pieces revealing a warm,chewy,soft, and creamy flavor inside.  the goat cheese salad was only good b/c of the goat cheese.  the bitter spring salad  took away from the pungent cheese.  i had to eat the cheese seperately and feel it crumble and meld together in your mouth...yummy.  i followed this with a thick piece of filet mignon and crisp fingerling potatoes.  then, it was finished by a glazed baked pear.  this was so good, it took me back when my grand uncle used to bake apples with brown sugar.  yeah, simple recipe but damn good dessert.   i would like to come back again to hit up the rest of the menu...",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,3,2,4,UwQUy58YhQaS0zwa7hy3mA

I spent money all over the place during the week and will pay  for those lunches later. Slightly different food than Zodiac back in Chicago/Oak Brook, but talk about the views! Warm weather+ shopping+ awesome soup, salad and mini sandwich+ warm popover with straberry butter= Bliss.",rC2PCfLaztmkZSx_VeVkxQ,1,0,5,Lfgn8IzfiuAdyMXMNyu-7A
