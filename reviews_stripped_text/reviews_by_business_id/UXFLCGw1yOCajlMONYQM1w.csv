I thought they tasted old. The only things I enjoyed was the corned beef on which I poured gravy for better taste and the orange juice. Not a lot of selection. Service was good, staff was nice and friendly. Place is clean. Would not come back though.",iOXqBVY8xbQfMWOmotz30A,0,0,2,DBMIVBTnE84ko5NgW1Ymaw
61657,2016-06-21,0,UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w,Well I wasn't expecting anything crazy good. I'd say everything I tried was all decent from Mongolia grill to a very flavorful  prime rib. Desserts carrot cake 7 coconut pie 7 out of 10. Price great $15 Today's buffets in Vegas  are all over priced and half of there food is below average. I'd rather spend $100 at Vic and Anthonys For a great meal then Any Buffet in town.,VdyTesw5gfEOlMPs7pcH0g,0,0,4,O0Qn--tCm_4m8y_IBveRUg
61731,2016-01-19,0,UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w,"Husband and I were at Gold Coast buffet last night (Sunday-01/18/16) for dinner (5:30 pm).  I need say that I do not particularly like this buffet to start with, but things can always change.  I now shall start at the beginning.

1.  Price is OUTRAGEOUS for what is served.

2.  More service people than people to service. Ordered our drinks & proceeded to check the line.

3.  Checked out what was being served from the salad to the Italian dishes. Same old stuff last night or 6 months ago.

4.  Female server brings our drinks, and two steak knives, 1 was dirty, husband asks for more napkins, she never returns. Someone else comes to the table takes her name tag and replaces with his, and walks away.  (She went on break but never told us.)

5.  Proceeded to get our food.  I had chicken breast w/spinach, olives, mushrooms and cheese; green beans; and, stuffed manicotti.  Sat down to take a look...tried the chicken breast but could not cut it. The topping was so hard it would not cut - removed spinach stuff and ate the chicken (mostly).  Green beans were fine!  Moved onto the manicotti, which was COLD in the middle!  Not such a big deal ate one bite and gave it up.  Awful tasting.

6.  Go to the soup bar-cream of potato soup!  GREAT - a favorite of ours. Filled two bowls and went to get soup spoons. I must have gone through 12-15 spoons all of which had sticky handles or food stuck to them.  Went to other side and pick spoons. Proceeded to eat the soup - it was barely warm soup, potatoes were cold.   

7.  While seated and talking with my husband, our server comes toward us and it certainly looked like it had his finger up his nose and then proceeds to wipe his nose down his arm. I thought I was going to lose the little bit of food that I just ate. 

8.  Husband drinks some coffee and goes back to buffet - I stayed at the table and notice something red on the side of his coffee cup.  My first thoughts were OMG - lipstick - than said nah.  My first thoughts were correct.  LIPSTICK AND LIP IMPRESSION ON OUTSIDE AND INSIDE OF CUP.  Husband back at the table now and I tell him what I found while he was gone.  Must note: he is left handed so the lipstick was on the opposite side of the cup, but still disgusting no matter what, and I don't wear lipstick.

9. I asked the hostess to please call the manager.  She proceeded to ask why I wanted to speak to him. So she says she will call him.  I waited, and waited, and waited....She comes back after 10+ minutes and tells us that he has to come from the other side of the building so it will take him a little time to get to us.  All total - probably waited 15 minutes.

10.  He finally gets to the table, never introduced himself, could have been anyone.  He asked what the problem was, my husband and I told him and all that he was concerned about was refunding our money so the problem would go away.  Well, I told him it wasn't about the money and it was not the point.  He implied that we were lying and said everything is on tap and he will look at it.  He also said he will talk to the chef and walks away...so we wait again - at least another 10 minutes and he reappears. He says he checked temps of the food, silverware was clean, spoke to the chef, and all was well. I said to him that his checking NOW was an hour+ later was a rather mute point since numerous people have eaten (1 hour later).  Again, offering to refund our money, my response was still the same. He then says he will be right back again, to never returned.  

My opinion and my opinion only, I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone going there.  When the Gold Coast was owned by the Gaughan family, it was a fine place to go, but now, forget it! Save your money.",eKkBU_ksKmGmHaNG8PGTiQ,0,0,1,QMzuDjWXbpEjHOLUsHeuig

It is not packed like other buffet's in the strip would be, and they serve decent food that wont make you sick. They have the regular pancakes, toast, waffles, and ""made to order"" omelettes, and on the side they have the dessert table which serves a variety of different cakes and pies, best (banana cream pie, sprinkled chocolate cake) yum. The waiters-waitresses are very polite and tend to you quickly. I have never eaten here for lunch or dinner so I wouldn't recommend going during lunch and dinner but I will recommend breakfast. The only reason they don't get five stars is because Gold Coast to me seems more like a senior citizen hotel, I mean all I saw in the buffet were senior citizens, it's more of like a relaxing-quiet place not like hotels in the strip.",7cGUoD61xIMCaJGTvLkXyA,0,0,4,s06DanFkfSAJAsS2Br-iMw

I reiterate that I want mine in a cone (after she gives my friend a small scoop in a bowl that was so super small it might fill up a 3 year old. Maybe). She glances to the side, I look at her like ""what?"" she glances to the side, gestures, mumbles something, I have no idea what she is saying. I look over and see the soft serve. I say I want a cone, she motions over, I go walking over, and there is a cone dispenser. Why didn't she just politely ask me to go get a cone?!?!?! Ridiculous! Does she speak English?

That said, this property does run a lot of promotions to get discounted food, especially for seniors. But I'm not a senior, and I get only $1.00 off for having a B-Connected card.  

One thing going for this place is that the buffet is not at all crowded.   Another is that for the price (even regular price), they have a pretty good selection. Where the ratings drop is the overall quality of the food.  I went on prime rib night.  The prime rib was okay - it was bland and a little tough - about a 4 on a scale of 1 - 10.

The mussels were okay also, give those about a 5.  The chow mein, I liked - it was a little sweeter and chewier, and the noodles were a bit thinner than what you would expect - it was nicely different - about a 6.5.  There was some spicy vegetable dish that rated about a 5 also.  I should have quit while I was ahead.  Or I could have tried an enchilada, had some fried fish, made myself a taco, had a slice of pizza, but instead, I had the imitation crab salad and Wor Won Ton Soup. 

The soups disappointed me.  I opened the top, looked inside, and decided to pass.  But in the Chinese food section, there was Wor Won Ton Soup.  Although it just won ton dumplings and broth, I had to try some.  It was less than mediocre - the broth tasted like chicken cubes melted in hot water, and the won ton dumplings were so bland that it didn't even absorb any of the broth's saltiness. 

What ended my meal was the imitation crab salad. I don't know how it is on other nights, but on this night, this was a one star, and after a couple of bites, I was done eating. This entree just zapped the appetite right out of me.",BmlwF7AX5gTpSXtyNdqpfg,0,0,2,n3UjB3OOdF7cAjVt1lrB6g

Is it on par with it's high-priced competitor just to its east (where I've also eaten)? No, but with such a reasonable price there's no way they could.

Our family went to this buffet twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast. The food was quite good for both visits, and the desserts are definitely something to leave room for.

You get variety, freshness (unless you wait until just before they close for the meal), and decent quality. My picky kids (8 to 17) had no complaints and plenty of options to choose from. The fruit was fresh and plentiful.

Service was terrific for dinner and lousy for breakfast. Like most places, I guess it depends on who you get.

Some decent surprises on the main line involved chicken.  The mazaltan chicken had a zesty sauce and cheese, orange chicken was a whole breast in orange sauce, chicken kiev was white meat encased in crust and another chinese chicken dish was good.  The italian side needed work, on this night, but some other good finds were carved turkey, the taco section and fresh rolled tortillas, fried banana, rice pilaf and finally the chocolate mouse pie was a happy ending, but skip the tiramisu. Plates were cleared and drinks refilled. Overall food was good for my $3 total after discount.
     Back for lunch and my final credit and the dishes got even more impressive and only for $7.99 with card or free with my promotion. The highlights were the Fried ravioli with tasty marinara dipping sauce, the freshly prepared chicken and your choice of veggies dish from the Mongolian Grill in a semi-spicy sauce, the chicken fajitas with huge strips of peppers and white meat chicken, the hushpuppes and even the chicken soup was decent.

that there are plenty of fine buffets

Unfortunately,
this is not one of them.

The food lacks any kind
finesse, flavor, and love.

For example, you got your
choice of overly well prime rib,
super dry fish,
or pasta that was never close to being al dente.
And don't forget the blah selection
of wilted greens and stuff 
from the salad bar.

The desserts looked good, but I was too full to have any of it.  The only dessert I had was the ice cream cone, which isn't self-serve.

FOOD
The food variety was good. But, a big but, most of the food was WACK! The seafood section had some fish that was dry and flakey. At least go get some fresh fish yeah? 
The Mongolian section had few appealing choices and the meat was very dry. The sweet and sour pork was probably the best choice for the Chinese section. Otherwise everything else was wack. I found a piece of plastic in the sour tasting kimchi. -1 star. The bbq America section was the worst. The corn beef tasted like rubber and left a salty aftertaste in my mouth that couldn't be washed out except with a nice sip of raspberry tea. The Italian section looked faked af so we steered clear of that section. The quesadilla in the Mexican section was uncooked and gooey.

DESSERT
As we walked by the dessert bar, we were interested in their many pies they had to offer. BUT after choosing our picks, the cakes tastes artificial and the lemon meringue pie had FAKE FOAM on top. The ice cream scoops were the size of golf balls so you should ask for three scoops. They are incorrectly labeled as well.

The only BBQ I saw was ribs, they also had burgers, turkey burgers, fries and baked beans. This Saturday buffet was $15.99 (before players card discounts).

I will say that the service is good and reasonably priced when compared to other Vegas buffets. And rarely crowded, so you're not waiting in line for 2 hours like in more popular buffets. As such, you will see that the clientele that resides here tend to be elderly, young families, and perhaps people who have lost too much cash at other casinos.

The best deal (and perhaps the only time I'd recommend eating here) may be during their seafood nights, which is Friday evening. Just stock up on cold crab legs and cocktail shrimp.

I've been here about 100 times before starting to yelp so clearly I like it. Lol. I live super close and didn't have a car when I first moved to LV but still enjoy the buffet. 4 star is fair for the overall value and service. 

They still bring you drinks. Fast to get seated with big tables. You get seated close to the food usually. Clean and maintained. 

Food is very hit and miss and nothing is spectacular. I have always get my money's worth. I usually start with a big salad and lots of fruit. Things I like most are the biscuits and gravy, you get 3 options on gravy. Omelette bar, ask for fresh cracked egg. Waffles are okay if you get them fresh, you can ask them to make a little batch. 

Lunch and dinner I like the fish and meats. Clam strips when a fresh batch comes. I just keep it basic and don't come real hungry and do okay.

Holiday special meals here are very good value though. I don't gamble but people that do get comps easy. I often come with people that got free entry or buy 1 get 1 which makes it way good value. 

I haven't been here in 6 months at least but most of the staff remembered me well and were very nice. Few actually very happy to see me which was nice of them. Great service makes it hard not to round to 4 star.

We ate at the buffet twice. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. The stomach pains started that night and lasted almost two days. It was the sickest I've been and still been walking around.

I consistently wasn't sure if I would get to a bathroom in time for 30 hours straight.

For that I'll rate it as A-OK for the price.

I did notice the Fried Rice was especially great, had more flavor than usual,  still a bit bland though.  I loved the Soft tacos I made, wish they had sliced black olives. I tried using whole black olives but they tasted awful.  No big deal I left it off the taco.

I have to say the price you can't complain but the green beans were really old. as seen in the picture I snapped.  I left disappointed thinking they might of gotten better.  This experience just didn't cut it for A-OK this time.. I've experienced Better.

Come to find out when I went to the buffet cashier, depending on what level you're at (Emerald, Sapphire, Ruby in descending order), they have different discounts.
Coming directly from the club card desk, I assume I'm a Ruby but they gave me 2 for 1 discount coming to under $10 for just me.

The buffet line had your standby non-gourment items (fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, prime rib, etc), but what I ended up doing is getting 3 mound-full dishes of snow crab, shrimp cocktail, manila clams, and oysters rockerfeller.

But I was actually surprised in a good way, maybe my expectations were super low but I genuinely had a good meal here. Typical American breakfast food..eggs, waffles, sausages, hams, breakfast burritos, etc Nothing stood out about it, but it was solid. Decent amount of selection..food was HOT.

Restaurant is brightly lit. Tables are spaced out and there's a lot of room to sit without being cramped up. Service was good, honestly I had no complaints.

For cheap eats, if you're staying at the Rio/Palms.

The only reason we actually came here is because it was in the hotel where we were staying and didn't feel like going out as we had been traveling all day. The other reason is due to the special price they were running for the month of July. $13.99 for prime rib dinner buffet!! That is ridiculous. The salad bar was adequate. To be honest though, nothing else on the entire buffet looked good to me. Sushi, Italian, Mexican, etc. They also have a sort of Mongolian grill type setup where you can pick your veggies/ingredients and they will fix it for you fresh. I had the prime rib which was really good and the Mac and cheese which was fine. I didn't really check out the dessert bar so I can't comment there. Everyone we encountered here though from the hostess, to the server, and even the cooks were so friendly and helpful. They really made the buffet experience tolerable.

Yuk.  Other items that were not very good were the entire Chinese and Italian stations (including their artichoke hearts and olive section).  I did not try dessert.  Now for the good stuff.  I did enjoy the Mexican station (surprisingly as I am from California and am a bit picky) because they had ""build your own"" sopes (i.e. Shell, pork pozole, beans, Mexican cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, cilantro, lemon and salsa verde.  I ate two of those.  The guacamole was sour though.  I also liked their gumbo which I poured over white rice (had a couple servings of that as well).  Their sword fish was not too bad either.  The BBQ pork ribs were seasoned nicely with the dry rub and didn't really need sauce.

Let's cut to the chase: The food is average. Nothing too exceedingly fancy, but better than mystery meat swimming in gravy. Breakfast offerings usually include waffles, french toast, made-to-order omelettes, and various styles of breakfast meats and potatoes. Lunch and dinner are pretty much the same, with basic fried seafood, pizza, chinese food (which is pretty tasty), with some nights offering crab legs and steaks for a slightly higher price.

The wait staff is generally nice and attentive.

The price really can't be beat. As long as you have a player's card, breakfast lunch and dinner are 6-9-12 dollars, respectively. Compared to other buffet offerings, I'm not sure where else you can get a decent breakfast or lunch for under $10.

They make them to order, which means that you wait in line to ask for rare to get a medium-well, because that's they only way they know how to cook them. Not sure what cut these were, but I'm assuming maybe the ear or pancreas because I've had more tender shoe leather. Seriously, I literally BENT THE STEAK KNIFE trying to cut off a piece. After the second bite, my jaw was so sore I gave up.

The best part of the entire meal was the succulent honeydew melons. The ice cream wasn't even that good.

The service was swift and courteous. The Filipino man that took our plates away and brought us napkins and drinks was a sweetie with a big smile. He even conspired with me to sneak the inedible leftover steak out for my dog.

In no way,shape, or form am I intentionally giving this Buffet a bad review for any reason other than I'm giving my personal opinion regarding the experience that I had today dining there, and tasting the food that was being served.

I had been to Port of Call Buffet at the Gold Coast before and I do remember that the food was not the best I've had but it wasn't the worst either, and that is why I decided to go and eat there today. 

The entry at the buffet with your players card will cost you roughly $9, and to be honest the quality of the food fits that price just right. Once I went into the buffet and took a look at the variety of food that was available, I was very disappointed as they didn't have a good  variety, and the quality of food which was presented did not look that appealing as some of the food looked rather dry, and not too appetizing.

Nevertheless I went for a couple of items went back to my table sat down and gave it a chance. Yikes, the first item I tasted where the mashed potatoes, I  have to say they were very disappointing they did not have good flavor. Another item on my plate we're enchiladas to be honest I had trouble finishing them.

I could go on and on and talk about every single item that I tasted there that was disappointing but if I did this review would be extremely long. One of  the items that disappointed me the most was the pasta. It was dry, and tasted like it was sitting there for a very long time.


None of the food that I had at the buffet was good. Even the desert was bad if you can believe that. I had some bread pudding and the taste was just not what you expect.

The only thing that was good at that Buffet was the service. The gal that was picking up plates and bringing me refreshments was very respectful, very nice and kept my cup full. This is the only reason they're getting two stars because of the service,because if that was bad they might have just gotten one star.

Sadly, they do have select days that they will have crab legs on the menu unlike other buffets, they'd have crab legs every night. 

I have a players card and I usually go here to redeem coupons and points. Their lines could get pretty long because people usually already wait 15 to 30 minutes prior before the buffet opening. You pay in advance and seated where your server will come to take your drink order. From there you are free to get your food. There is one line filled with food, a middle section filled with another set of food, and to the side the dessert section. It's pretty small and it does not have as much selection but I believe they always have at least one dish that is the utmost delicious. They have the basic American food and as you go down the line there is a mix of ethnic selections.

The price was good also (just make sure you have a B Connected card) I will visit again this place was clean and friendly!",KCD6daAp293FoOUoTjT_YA,2,0,3,aa0-EcPM1tH96TIV52hssw

I recommend anyone to eat at Ports O'Call Buffet. It is cheap, clean and good. I just have two tips to increase your chances of having an awesome experience. 

1. Don't expect gourmet.
2. Save room for dessert because they have a vast selection.",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,1,4,BmlN0VwsEGuGILs0p4Bhqg

The food was so flavorless and bland, even though they appeared to put the same seasoning on everything from the ribs to the chicken legs. Service was okay, at least they kept our glasses filled. Dessert was definitely edible, but also just bland. I heard another person complaining to the staff about quality and their answer was ""You can't please everyone""...so they're very well aware their shit stinks. Save your money and go literally anywhere else.",AEwBTGstJC-Qa2AwtmcKUg,0,0,1,Kc3rg0n2jPC5AKAI4NDikQ

It's always clean and the lines aren't too long. Not too expensive, remember to use your players card to get the discounted price. As a local I come here often, especially for their prime rib, crawfish and crab legs.. Deliciousness! For breakfast you can create your own omelette, as well for dinner your own stir fry!

Do NOT skip their dessert bar! 
So many pies to choose from, but you MUST try their bread pudding (with a scoop of ice cream) You won't regret it! and let's not forget about their gelato bar.. mmm

If you can, ask to be seated in Juanita's section! She is amazing, great service and will take care of you. 

Perfect place to eat like royalty on a budget :p",3ajSADFnm71e_Zcip_igWQ,20,15,4,3F30bs-f4dwys8CaKe22bA
5848941,2015-12-17,6,UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w,"The full price is not worth the quality and selection of food that they serve. We only go if we have a buy one get one free coupon that you can easily get on the receipt print outs at the Smith's on Decatur/flamingo, otherwise it would not be a good decision. We like the swai fish they usually have as they prepare it in a couple of different ways depending on the day. My favorite is the sweet and sour swai, mmmmm yum. Their bread pudding kicks ass in flavor!

They really need to revamp this buffet as the selection is limited and dull in flavor and execution. It could be so much better if they would make some changes with the food selection and preparation. The food I noticed was not even warm or hot, a lot of items were room temperature. The staff is friendly and is good at keeping the drink refills up at least. This is not a buffet that will keep me coming back, I am pretty much three and done, is not worth going for two likeable items in my opinion.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,8,6,2,Or0FYgDYVlOMeE0BHTKwtQ

Anyway, it was a horrible, horrible experience that I hope to soon forget, but still have nightmares about.  Such disgusting, inebidle ""food"", I wouldn't even feed my dog here.

The only thing I dislike is how far from the strip it is if you don't rent a car. Probably not worth the cab fair. But non the less, if you can get here do it. We ate breakfast here easily 3 of the 5 mornings we were visiting.",JLqluPKgdffNJ3Ndj8S2Uw,0,0,5,_wnnj1iRfUt_VkXl9kxxCw
