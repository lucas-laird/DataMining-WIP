Although we were literally the only customers here (right before closing), it was a pretty impressive little spot nicely located near Torrey Pines and Charleston. I had bulgogi noodles that were very flavorful and also shared mixed tempura plate and additional plate of shrimp tempura.  The veggies were perfectly soft and the tempura batter was absolutely perfect!! I have never had such a flavorful dipping sauce that tasted like soy sauce perfectly infused with the right amount of ginger!!!

83086,2016-12-23,1,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"I've never left a Yelp review, so we'll see how this goes.

Food:

I ordered chashu ramen with soft boiled egg (+$1.00). The ramen broth was fine, it was definitely tasty but I would say it was a far stretch from exceptional.

The noodles were sub-par. I felt at times as if I was eating top ramen noodles with a more quality broth -- at this price, no matter how relatively cheap it is compared to other Vegas ramen bars, this is unacceptable.

Toppings are very important to ramen, and I feel this is where Moko falls short the most. The only topping I recieved was 3 slices of pork belly and the additional egg I ordered. Granted, I could have ordered more toppings, but that would have quickly increased the price. I understand that the $8.50 bowl of ramen is cheaper than most other ramen bars, but if I have to add several dollars worth of toppings, the low starting price doesn't help. 
As for the taste of the toppings, the meat was truly delicious. There was a subtle char to it that really set it over the edge. The egg was a different story. It didn't taste bad, but the creamy center of the egg was noticeably cold. It was clear that it was in no way fresh.

Overall the food was not excellent but was palatable.

The nail in Moko's coffin was the service.

I had to wait at least 45 minutes for my bowl of ramen, and they had forgot to even start my to go order, so I ended up just canceling it. Water refills were rare, and the taste or overall freshness of the food in no way justified the slow service especially considering there were only two other people eating at the time I was there.

Overall, the food was alright and the slow service was unjustifiable. I don't plan on returning.",gpL6tCUwk72mpHDV4n9YBw,2,0,2,5mgjr4_maqRtC-ztyOlULw

125627,2017-06-23,0,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"Between going out for pho and going out for ramen, pho is usually my go to when it comes to noodle soups. However, Moko Ramen changed my attitude in a hurry. I've now frequented this restaurant several times and it's one of my (and my friends') favorite places to go. 

The restaurant itself is a smallish place with a bar and around a handful of tables, so it can get somewhat busy during dinner time, however I've never had to wait for a table. It's simply decorated, but very clean and stylish looking. Servers are friendly and attentive. Music is always good too! 

The food is the real magic of this place though. I've had the curry ramen more times than I can count and my friends swear by the chashu ramen. If you're not into any of the ""pre-planned"" ramens, you can also make your own from a list of ingredients - just check off what you want on a paper menu they provide. I will say that making your own can get pricey quickly, so I suggest just picking a pre-planned one and adding any ingredients you want to that instead. 

Regardless of what you order, there's always a lot of it and all high quality. Moko is probably my favorite restaurant in Vegas, thus far, and you can be sure that I'll be back very soon!",VHfQN8MRUYMNA25NfkphvA,0,0,5,-R4swi93iheR0ceV46cIrg

The food and service was excellent with special attention from the owner Ryan. Our server Serah was a cute as can be. We started off with the seaweed salad and the beef gyoza. The gyoza had a light crispy wrapper and a very tasty hoisin based dipping sauce that had some kick to it, this was the best gyoza I ever had. Next came the beef tacos which was good but not something I would order the next time here. We followed that with the fiery noodles which lived up to it's name and was definitely worth coming back for. We finished the meal with the Chilean sea bass which was good with the spicy vegetable sauce. For our beverage we ordered the Soju which is like a cold sake that went well with our entrees. The restaurant is small and located in a strip mall across from CSN and isn't very visible when you drive by, and is sandwiched between a McDonalds and a Chipotle, which can account for the fact that both times we came here there were only a couple of other patrons.

We have our favorite place back in Utah and found a close second out here, but it is across the valley from our house. We decided to try this place out since it is closer to where we lived. We were not impressed with the ramen at all. The pork did not seem like it was slow cooked like it typically is...it did not melt in the mouth like it does in the other Ravens I have tried. The broth did not have the typical big flavor and they only had chili powder to put on (no oil or even soy sauce). This place just did not have the typical ramen umami flavor I am used to.

Their menu simply consists of small plates, rice, and ramen. When it comes to ramen, there are 2 options to choose; pick one of 8 kinds of signature ramen or make your own ramen. 
We had a chance shortly to talk the owner, Ryan, and could hear that Moko Ramen was originally begun as Korean fusion tapas bar. We noticed that there were Korean rice bowl dishes and a line up of ramen toppings using Korean ingredients like dolsot bibimbap, kimchi, bulgogi, and so forth. 
We ordered a dolsot (stone bowl) bibimbap and a Chashu ramen with kimchi and pork bulgogi as toppings. Bibimbap was served with 6 kinds of well seasoned veggies, chopped chashu, egg, miso soup, and gochujang which is Korean chili paste as a sauce. The stone bowl was heated up and was still sizzling when it came to our table. It was absolutely tasty. Plus we found crispy rice on the bottom of the dish when we almost finished the bowl and it was worth extra credit! 
Chashu ramen consists of Tonkotsu broth, thin straight noodle, green onion, shredded chili string, and black garlic oil. The broth was more than enough to our tong happy and Chashu was the best I have ever had.

Typically when someone says Korean fusion I think of tacos then get depressed because that has been done over and over.  To be fair they also have tacos, which I didn't like (too hard to eat and bulgogi was too sweet), but Ill forgive them because everything else was amazing!  

We started with the eggplant salad which was refreshing and a great way to start the meal, then moved into the heavy guns.  Chicken Pottage and Mackerel Pasta were my favorites, the porridge had great flavor and the poached egg added a lot of creaminess.  We also really enjoyed the Monkfish and Chicken Thigh, very delicately prepared.  I wasn't as blown away with the black bean noodle as other reviewers have noted.  Looking forward to trying the pork belly next time.

We tried the cucumber salad, the beef gyoza, the fried onion rings, and the eggplant. The starters were half off for happy hour, which runs until 7. And ladies $2 wines HH mon- Thursday and not just house wines. 

The Stars were the eggplant with its delicate crispy shallots, served cold with micro-greens and the light cucumber salad. 

For our shared plates we really could not decide between the 10hr braised pork belly vs the 30 he sous vide pork belly. Sooo we got them both along with the short ribs and beef tacos. The guys loved the two pork dishes. The debate was do you prefer that roasted caramelized flavor or the pure creamy buttery sous vide?

The ladies preferred the well prepared short ribs with sweet Asian pears. Rich, sweet and roasted. Tender and topped with tiny Garlic chips. All the dishes had these adorable skinned cherry or grape tomatoes stuffed with their skin to look like a tiny purse. Great presentation. W

We still had room so we ventured to the all day lunch menu and tried the classic crispy bibimbap and their black bean sauce noodles. Both were creamy and well balanced. We did try the beef tacos and they were fine... It was the three sauces that made these so special. 

We then tried their classic crispy bibimbap and black bean sauce noodles. Both well balanced and executed on point. 

Service was fantastic. 

Believe it or not, there was dessert ( these were small plates after all shared four ways). The date Creme brûlée was outstanding. I could crave that. The red bean mochi is a classic and also delicious but the CB stole the show. 

Thanks to Ryan and his chef. This place is a hidden gem. Get out there and tell your friends that this new place is worth the trip. We will return for sure.",FmDvKzHe8WBnkVkkXbRUpw,2,1,5,v9_NKF2JljNlJdqWbmSG2g

The location is very small, and it seems like they have an odd reservation system that I wasn't aware of. We were sat at a small table even though booths were available and were told that those were already taken. Over halfway through our experience people came and left quickly in the larger groups, while we waited for everything from service, to our bill. The servers didn't seem to know where things were going, attempting to bring us someone else's order, and subsequently giving  the only other table at the time our order. The thing that bothers me most is the server actually ""dropped"" the food off on the table, meaning he served it completely and then turned around and gave it to us when the table said it was incorrect. Coming from a food service background, this is a no-no. Once food HITS a table, that is considered that table's, you can't take a basket of bread that you left at a table and give it to a new table (even if it was untouched). So it irked be a bit, but at this point we had waited so long that I let it go. They also forgot one of our items but charged us for it anyway. 

Aside from the service, the food was actually very good. They have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options, which is always very nice. We ordered and shared the BYO spinach ramen with miso broth, veggie dumplings, shrimp tempura, and kimchi (which we never got).

We told the waiter we wanted a bento box and even said he put the order in. By this time, my hungry 1 year old brother is starving! He had nothing to eat.

I think this is the ramen joint that nickels and dimes you the most. Their pre established bowls start at 8.95 and come with only a few choices of toppings. Extra toppings are available, however they range in the price of 0.50 to 3.95.

I had the shoyu broth, thin noodles, boiled egg, nori, chashu, and garlic chili paste. Total cost for my bowl: 11.50

8.00-10.00 is about the normal price i pay for a bowl of ramen I get, however the ramen i usually get also includes a lot more ingredients. (Mushrooms, green onions, free chili paste, free fresh garlic, bamboo, etc.)

Girlfriend had tonkatsu broth, thick noodles, boiled egg, chashu, garlic chili paste, and nori. Total cost: 11.50

The boiled egg was hard boiled, not the usual soft boil you get at most ramen places. I feel like it was boiled in soy sauce, because all I tasted from the egg was salt. 

We asked for anything spicy to add to our soup, and the server pointed to the garlic chili paste on the menu for $1.00 (very stingy amount given, whereas it is free at other ramen places)
The couple next to us asked for some, and the server offered the paste and chili powder, and did not mention the surcharge. I wonder if we should have just asked for the paste after the fact because it seemed like the other couple werent going to be charged.

Chashu is normally tender and melt in your mouth consistency, however it was tough and overcooked. I dont think the 3.00 charge for the chashu was worth it for that quality.

Items sampled:

- Smoked Mackerel Pasta
- House Smoken Yellowtail
- Beef Tacos
- Soy Chicken Wing
- Black Bean Sauce Noodle
- Omiza Creme Brulee

I'm almost allergic to Italian pasta overpowered by tomato and/or cream sauce, and it's always a relief when pasta is served simply with subtleties like salt, olive oil and not much else. As such, Smoked Mackerel Pasta was a joy.

Beef Tacos came out with tenderloin bulgogi in a thin crispy shell, with three aioli sauce including mustard and lime.

Per the onwer's recommendation, we also ordered Soy Chicken Wing - something we usually don't eat but glad we did - it was lightly breaded and lightly sauced yet it maintained crispy texture. Mmmm!

And Black Bean Sauce Noodle with egg white noodle, black bean sauce, pork, onion, carrot, zucchini, green onion and a poached egg. It was our first time ever to try black bean sauce noodle and now we're a big fan! So intricate yet mild flavors.

Finally, Omija Creme Brulee sealed the deal - it was a perfect closing for the 6 course journey.

We're impressed!",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,4,4,5,Q2HvrssOGFCYaCPKQxHdRQ

So.. Moko Asian Bistro ended up being one of my foodie wins of 2014.. and we're at the end of the year.  I'm not even sure where to start.. I appreciate the variety you can get in tapas / small plates, I heart Asian fusion, Korean IS my comfort food, and Moko hit all the above.   Instead of going through the lunch/dinner menu I ran through the small plates one and got the salmon with black bean sauce.. this is the jjajang sauce I've been missing in my life.  Jjajangmyeon is also available on the menu but this was a nice execution of jjajang and salmon.  It does not exist in traditional places, it's flippin genius. 

Other people on here mentioned the 30hours braised berkshire pork belly so I ran with it.  It has ""kimchi crepe"" under it but those who are familiar with Korean food will recognize it as kimchi-jun or kimchi pancake, with this black raspberry marinated salt.. I couldn't tell it was a flavored salt but it worked with the pork belly and that happy fluffy comforting kimchi-jun-ness.  I also went for the eggplant salad, it has micro greens, was crisp, light house dressing.. I can't really feel like.. I can review a salad and taking it seriously, but it's worth mentioning the presentation was really pretty and everything was the way it should be. 

The presentation on everything that came out was impressive, the last time I saw something plated like the pork belly was at a French restaurant I used to frequent in Scottsdale, AZ. There is a happy hour starting at 5, and I decided to skip the alcohol but honestly it was a little difficult.  They do $2 glasses of wine for the ladies Mon - Thur.. it's something to keep in mind.  This place is smaller than I thought it would be, but it wasn't overly crowded and the owner was very attentive, checking on me and constantly refilling my tea, AND encouraging my usage of Korean despite butchering what little of the language I remember. I'm coming back, and will be attempting a girls thing here.

Random note at the end: I'm really disappointed in the pics I took but I did a half ass job in a hurry because I wanted to eat them so check out the pics on Moko's site - mokolasvegas.com .. they're way better.",hDzgJUST9jdBrtnUK5085w,2,3,5,19l1nOxacZ6AldJLP6MAyg

It was so good that we took my boyfriend's parents there last night. When we had gone on Saturday, we got jja jang myun - excellent!

You get to pick one grilled item, one fried item, and a dessert. It comes with a salad and a side of rice. What's cool was that the lunch special ran all day, we ordered these ""lunch"" specials at like 9:00 pm. Since we were new to the place, we ordered other things here and there - beef tataki, some tomato soup, and a california roll. Oh! and a side of shrimp tempura. Holy shiznits, they were all good haha When we had gone again last night with the boofran's parents, we ordered some of the same things. We also ordered some new things - the tomato cream pasta i believe it's called, udon noodles, and sesame chicken. All good of course. The guy that was our waiter was very kind and attentive to our needs. When we ordered a side of rice, he gave us nice miramoto? spoons and he offered to take our plates and give us new ones - not necessary since we didn't care - we were too busy stuffing our face to care about the sauces mixing on our plates lol The decor inside is really cute too.

My husband and I ordered the Signature Chashu Ramen and added Egg and Hot Chili. The broth was DIVINE - so rich, flavorful and slightly creamy. I have had bad experiences with Ramen broth being bland but they do it perfectly here! It also came with generous portions of Pork Belly and we each got a WHOLE EGG. Back home in DC, our ramen places only serve 1/2 a boiled egg and still charge $15+.

The prices here are a STEAL! The base for our ramen was only $8.95, and just $1.50 to add the egg and hot chili. 

My aunt ordered the Signature Curry Ramen and added Chicken Bulgogi - she really liked it! It was a nice spin on Ramen and definitely had the rich flavors of japanese curry.

The only con was that service was a bit slow and forgetful, but it seemed like there was only 1 server for the whole place and they were pretty busy. He was very friendly but I would not recommend eating here if you are in a rush.

Came in to a warm welcome when cold winter weather brought me in for a bowl. Menu offers a trio of specialty bowls and the option to DIY, along with some apps, bento boxes, desserts and beer/wine.

CHASHU RAMEN: a wonderful tonkotsu broth with meltingly soft chashu slices and thin noodles! Really enjoyed the broth, had some peppery spices mixed in for a more forward flavor. 
CURRY RAMEN: a dish that is new to me, the curry broth was similar to a gravy version of the Japanese curry I've had elsewhere. Comforting flavor without too much spice, this comes with thick, chewy noodles, bean sprouts, and spinach. I added nori and egg, but they were unnecessary additions that would have paired better with the previous bowl. 

Enjoying the first bowl far more than the latter, the convenient location and great service will see me coming back to make my own bowl with the best aspects of what we tried: tonkotsu broth, thick noodle, perfect egg, and strips of nori. Our chicken karagge app was solid and helped to balance out the meatless curry dish.

Lunch was a simpler easier menu that seemed based off of quick and easily to share food.  Duh. Tapas style u know? :-D it had a good range of Korean and Japanese.  The kimchi fried rice,  bi bim bap and yakisoba (made with udon noodles) were YUMMILICIOUS.  :-) I had other dishes but those three were my favorites but everything I had was good.  :-)

Dinner was more ""fine dining"" style. I had the 30 hour Berkshire pork... melt in your mouth fatty deliciousness. Yum! The crust on the chicken wing was so light and yet so delicious.  They cook the chicken sous vide in curry for an added depth of flavor before tossing in whichever sauce u choose.  OMG. Delicious and so crispy.  :-)  Black bean noodle (jja-jjang-myun) with egg white noodle... totally was not expecting the noodle but the mouth chew was fantastic.  Love love loved it!  

And if u like SPICY food, ask the server about their soon to be added to the menu spicy ramen noodle.  I love heat and it brought it!  So spicy and yet I could not stop eating it! :-) just thinking about it is making me drool. :-P

Taste: When I got the bibimbap (korean version of fried rice) I was very surprised to see a miso soup with it. Anyways back to the korean food I was very disappointed in the taste. It was really flavorless and bland. It was by far the worst bibimbap I have ever tasted.

Moko is a small shop like many of the other ramen places around town. Diners tonight included a party of eight people that had arrived shortly before us, and a party of three that already had their food. A family of four also arrived right after us. ""Cool,"" I thought, ""not super busy for a Friday night."" Wrong. 

We placed our orders for veggie mandoo and two bowls of ramen (both custom ramens but only with egg and bamboo added, plus crispy tofu for mine, so nothing crazily time-consuming), and then proceeded to wait nearly 45 minutes for our dinner to come out. The party of four received their menus and food before us, even though they had arrived after. They appeared to be regulars because they were familiar with our server, but I wasn't thrilled about being overlooked (not sure if they were intentionally served first or not). 

The ramen was okay but the mandoo and my tofu were unpleasantly oily. The egg was good but oddly was not cut in half, which made eating it a bit awkward. My miso broth was very salty. However, my boyfriend was satisfied with his tonkotsu broth. Honestly nothing exceptional, as their mission statement promises. 

The food was decent, but what bothered me was the lack of customer service. Drinks were never refilled, and there was neither an update on the status of our food nor an apology for the long wait upon its arrival. I understand that a party of eight might have been unexpected, but the customer service should still have been there. If it takes too long or is too difficult for the kitchen to deal with a heavily customizable menu, perhaps management should consider narrowing down the menu to a more efficient selection. Our server also gave off the vibe of wanting to be somewhere else, which was off-putting.

I've been there three times and have tried new things every time. Everything from the Yakisoba, to the Bibimpap to the 30-hour sous vide pork belly has been sublime. 

Ryan, the owner, is so friendly and gracious as a host. I brought my two very small children in to the restaurant and he took time out to play with them and make sure they were happy, as well as the parents.

They have a spicy kick (4.5/10) to them...certainly not for the average patron...but fans of spicy noodles should give them a shot.

When we dined here, we had the entire restaurant to ourselves! We were warmly welcomed and received world class service by the owner, Woosuk (Ryan). He treated us like we were old friends and he was extremely attentive and gracious. He's definitely a charming and funny character! We joked around and talked most of the night. I have never in my life have such an amazing host at a restaurant before, thank you so much Ryan! 

This style of dining caters to the food fanatic. This is not a place where you just eat, just to eat - this is the type of place where you'll want to savor with your eyes closed and let all of the ingredients dance on your tongue in perfect harmony. There is such a high level of artistry that went into each and every dish that Chef Hong put out. Seriously incredible.

We tried dishes from every section (salad, meat, soup, seafood, noodle) sadly, except for poultry and dessert. Oh how I wish my stomach was bigger! We'll just have to make an event out of those two categories the next time we come then! 

It was a privilege to taste each of these plates:

Bulgogi Beef Tacos $9 - 3 tenderloin bulgogi tacos, pear, date sauce, soy sauce, mustard aioli, lime aioli all in a thin crispy shell - The bulgogi was so freaking tender and buttery! Each little morsel melted on my tongue. I loved the super thin, delicate and crispy shell they were in. I'm a sauce junkie so the 3 dots of sauce were not enough for me! I'll have to make sure to request more of their delicious sauces the next time I come. 

10 hour Braised Berkshire Pork Belly $12 - soy sauce marinated pork belly, crisp sweet potato, silky skinned and sweet cherub tomato, Kimchi crepe, black raspberry marinated sea salt - This pork was exceptionally prepared and all of the components of the dish shined. The pork was extra tender and delicate. It was seasoned expertly! Make sure to take a bite of the pork with a bite of the juicy, smooth skinned cherub tomato - that's the perfect bite! 

Beef Short Rib $14 - braised marinated prime short rib, crispy garlic, luscious gratin, demi-glace - Is this heaven? Explosive flavor! The short rib was so incredibly meaty, rich, buttery, and melt in your mouth good. The crispy garlic chips added incredible pops of texture and surprising flavor. I loved it. The creamy potato gratin was super luscious and addicting - it was the best choice to pair with the short rib. This was one of my top dishes of the night! 

Bean Sauce Noodle $7 - egg white noodle, black bean sauce, pork, onion, carrot, zucchini, green onion
poached egg - Oooh you fancy, jjajangmyun! The noodles were cooked perfect and al dente, the sauce was loaded up on flavor, oh man and the poached egg, you know it, silky luscious egg porn! This is the best gourmet black bean noodles I have ever had. 

Hot Spicy Beef Soup $7 - beef brisket, mung bean sprouts, carrot, onion, green onion, spicy wholesome beef broth - Warmth for the soul. The brisket was crazy tender. The broth was very wholesome and comforting. It reminded me of eating in my best friends grandmother's Korean kitchen.

Eggplant Salad $7 - grilled eggplant, cherub tomato, grilled Shishito pepper, micro green, Moko dressing - This cold dish was very light, delicate, and refreshing! The grilled eggplant was grilled perfectly and tender, but very smooth and buttery when you bit into it. I also loved the delicate micro greens, they added pops of beautiful peppery notes. 

Shrimp Risotto $13 - sake-steamed shrimp, shiitake mushroom, mushroom risotto - Wow!!! What an epic finale to our meal! Chef Hong brought out all of his tricks on this dish. He used every single part of the shrimp and coaxed so much flavor out of the sweet juicy shrimp head. He even surprised us with delicious shrimp eggs on our plate! What a treat! You could really taste the deep flavor of the sweet ocean in the risotto. Also, the risotto was extremely creamy and seasoned with precision. The best part was the shrimp was steamed to perfection! I'm in love.

Incredible food, great conversation, and wonderful company! Moko has our vote! My boyfriend and I enjoyed our evening thoroughly and we couldn't stop talking about them after dinner and the next day (and the next day). We are looking forward to return very soon.

I ordered the curry ramen and my friend ordered the tofu. The food was very tasty and a pretty decent sized portion, my only real complaint is that they put way more bean sprouts than actual ramen in the dish which I wasn't the biggest fan of.

This hole in the wall was one of the best restaurants i have ever eaten at. The atmosphere and setting are minimalistic and very complimenting, no cluttered or gaudy decorations. Its leaves a very clean and relaxing setting which one can focus on and enjoy their food, plus they play kpop if that is your thing. Now onto the food i had the 30 hour pork belly (which literally melted in my mouth) rests on top of fried pork skin that is a savory nirvana unlike any other. The black bean noodles was simply delicious! I do not really like black bean noodles but the flavor profile of the noodles and sauce was really something you can't stop eating. Their gazoya was crunchy and light with a very tasty sauce with some heat. The bulgogi...now that was something else! The complex flavors and textures all on top of a bed of rice that further soaked up the juices and sauce is truly something one can eat and die with no regrets. It was one of the best bulgogi dishes i have ever eaten. The food is beyond belief and the intimate setting and sevice was a most memorable experience which i shall come back for almost every week. The owner (I believe his name is Ryan did serve us and the only few others there) helped me pick out good sake and good food to eat.

I was told it's a modern decor but it felt a little more industrial to me. Maybe it's the long dark faux wood tiles on the walls and exposed ventilation system. 

Now on to the food. This is tapas bar but also has bento boxes. On tap they have Fat Tire and Stone IPA. They have bottled beers (everything from coors light to Stella to Angry Orchard). There are also cans of soda and a house red and white wines. 

I sampled spicy chicken was really good. It's crunchy and covered in a chili sauce with broccoli. Then I sampled what seemed to be a tempura shrimp roll with cream cheese, it was really good. I think the star of the show was the spicy prawns. Soooooo good!!! Spicy but not set your mouth on fire. In my opinion that was the best shrimp I've ever had. The shrimp was butterflied and lightly breaded in what I believe was a tempura batter then tossed with this delicious sauce. We ordered just the shrimp and white rice. 

The owner Ryan said that his food is a Korean Japanese fusion. Everything I had was very tasty. I would suggest getting the spicy prawns so flavorful and just yummy!!!! If you love heat get the fiery noodle. That is too hot for my pallet.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,2,2,5,jaho6X5FTSwONIE3mP70zg

I love love tapas style foods. So this place has been calling my name for ages but I just haven't gotten around to checking it out until recently. 

Very small, cute restaurant. Doesn't have much sitting. We came during Happy Hour which is Mon-thurs 5-7pm. They have $2 house wines for the ladies, Buy 2 Get 1 free soju, half off starters, and I think BOGO on the beers. I got the house wine which was chardonnay and just 1 order of the yogurt soju. 

For foods we ordered: chicken pottage, seared salmon salad, and fiery noodle. Every thing was extremely delicious. The fiery noodles was ON FIRE! I'm telling you, if you can not handle spicy foods stay away. This is a spicy level 10 x 10! Aside from the fact that I had to keep drinking water after every bite, it was sooooooo good though! the seared salmon salad had good flavors. The salmon seemed really fresh. The chicken pottage was last to come and it was a great end to a meal. It had amazing flavors and it looked really pretty when they brought it out. 

The wait for our food was pretty long but it was really worth it. And you can tell Everything was made to order. We came in with just maybe 2 tables occupied and the wait for our food was still pretty long.

2880450,2016-05-09,8,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"I ate here awhile back and was very underwhelmed - service was extremely spotty, chasu was tough, and nothing about the experience/ambiance of the restaurant made me want to go back. I decided not to write a review until I gave it a second chance because a lot of trusted Yelpers were saying a lot of good things about this place. So I did, and it was unfortunately the same result for me, except this time the chasu wasn't as tough, but still not my favorite. 

On our 2nd visit, the cafe next door was having some hip hop open mic night. (Bad) music was blasting through the walls into Moko Ramen Bar and we asked to get moved from the table to the bar area in hopes of dwindling the sound. I guess this was a sign of things to come for our visit. I ordered the pork belly bun and it was tasty, but pricey and was a small portion for just one single piece (almost $5 I think). My husband had the curry ramen and added spam, which had a pretty pricey $3 surcharge for 2 pieces cut in half, but advertised as 4 pieces. I had the chasu ramen again and I never, ever finish ramen portions at any restaurant because they are usually so generous and huge, but that's not really the case here. Broth was rich, noodles were okay, but there's something not fulfilling and not completely composed about this bowl of ramen that I can't quite explain.  I also typically don't look at the surcharge for extras, but I guess the fact that the meal wasn't satisfying makes those extra charges sting more. Their eggs are advertised as a ""boiled"" egg, not specifying soft or hard. We got them fairly hard boiled on the first time we were here, but I would say the 2nd time was definitely overcooked. The family next to us ordered dessert first. They were out of the free check-in green tea ice cream. I thought the waitress would have offered a different ice cream instead, but she just stated they were our and listed off other desserts. The family ordered something else, then a few minutes later, she came back to state they were out of that too. Another table near us had some confusion with the bottle of wine they ordered and getting their bill. The server was very friendly, but it just seemed like the business was very green. Compared to other established ramen restaurants, Moko seems very amateur. I took my taste buds over to Ramen Tatstu and Ramen Sora since and was just happier with the overall experience. 

My final thoughts as we wrapped up our meal: I'm glad we went back since now I know this place isn't for me.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,7,5,2,vy1uGTBiBadMCSkUhgRysA

We were greeted and got to seat ourselves. It's quite spacious, not super small inside with a decent amount of seating. It's dim and romantic. I liked the atmosphere. It was clean and nicely decorated.

They gave us a menu and two pencils because they have BYO ramen!! How cool!! They do have a few choices that they have already built but we both chose to build our own. We both ended up building the same bowl, lol - the tonkotsu broth (with out the soy sauce), thick noodles, egg, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, corn, and chashu. We also ordered the Karaage and beef Gyoza to share.

The ramen was sooooo good, I haven't stopped dreaming about it ever since I ate it. The broth wasn't too thick, wasn't too salty. It was P E R F E C T! I loved it. All the toppings that were supposed to be crispy were, the egg was oozy, the chashu was tender, the Noodles soft and chewy, broth was nice and hot and ohhhh so wonderful. 

The Gyoza was so fantastically crispy! Loved that they had beef Gyoza instead of Pork and that the whole Gyoza was crispy! These were yummy!!

The chicken Karaage is why I could not give this place a 5 star rating :( sadly, they weren't meaty at all and they were hard to chew. The skin wasn't crispy, it was too thin and not as tasty as a lot of the Karaage I've tried at other places. But I did really like that they have a sauce to dip the chicken in, made it much easier to eat! It was a delicious sauce. 

The waiters were friendly, attentive and the kitchen was fast. There was no wait on a Saturday! And I have to say, the tonkotsu Ramen is my favorite bowl of ramen in Las Vegas that I've tried so far! I will definitely, definitely be returning!",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,3,1,4,AyMsmqEtzY4SjsiFjdLXtg

It's the only reason to be in that area since I'd rather not dine in area that's heavily trafficed by college kids.  The food is a little above them but they do have a cool lunch menu that seems to cater to them.   I started with an order of jjajangmyun, beef tacos and braised short ribs.  The jjajangmyun is very familiar flavor but with a really rich sauce but not salty.  They'll give you extra rice because why let that sauce go to waste?  The tacos are delicious with sauce but made better by the delicious sauces.   The rib was the best part.  Rich beef flavor, not over seasoned and potatoes are awesome.our second round was spicy chicken and 30 hour pork and some tempura (not my choice).  Chicken was awesome.  Lightly spicy witha cooked kimchee flavor and pork was delicious with a light pork flavor.  For those with a dislike for kimchee both dishes is very mild with kimchee flavor.  The tempura was well cooked a light crispy batter. We followed with some light desserts of mango mocho and the omiza creme brule.  I thought the brulee was the better of the two with a slight bacony flavor.  Service was very good and attentive and we were there for about 2.5 hours and did not feel rushed.  Great place.

I had the char su ramen with thick noodles and my fiancée had char su ramen with thin noodles. They did not refill our drinks and we had to ask numerous times only to be forgotten again. The menu selection is not extensive and if you cannot tell the difference between thick noodles and thin noodles then you probably should not be working there as my waiter had no idea !

I had shoyu with thin noodles, corn, butter, and an egg. 
Adam has tonkatsu with thick noodles, an egg, and extra pork belly. 
Both were packed with flavor and delicious. 
Mine was, of course, not spicy enough. The owner graciously offered me some of his special chili oil and after adding if I devoured the remaining ramen like noodle genocide. However, has I known they had a special of fiery ramen I would have ordered that. That is definitely on my mind for next visit. 

Oh, we also orders the garlic edamame and it's a perfect appetizer. Nice and hot with just enough garlic but not overbearing.

2956064,2014-05-26,10,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"Located across the Charleston campus, Moko is a contemporary tapas restaurant with a few unique Korean-inspired selections. I thought the concept was intriguing but to be frank, I didn't know what to expect. Kimchee tacos maybe? The cross-culture tapas menu is definitely trending these days so needless to say, I was excited to try it out. As soon as you walk in, there's a bar at the corner, which is nice because I don't recall any bars in the area. If you attend CSN or happen to be around the area and need a quick fixer, this seems like a good location. I mean they have Fat Tire on tap, which is awesome and my favorite :) Because it was a soft opening, I had a chance to chat with the chef, who used to work at a restaurant at the Wynn. Like most tapas menu, it is inspired to feature 'socialize food' that is best suited with wine or a beer. With that being said, let's get to the food!

For the most part, you can find what you would expect from a regular tapas restaurant, with chicken wings or veggie choices, so it's really not that unusual. However, there are a few unique ones such as the Beef Tataki that comes with a homemade Moko sauce, which is seriously addictive. Highly recommend! My favorite, and probably the best example for the Korean-inspired dish, is the Black Bean Noodles, which is called Jjajangmyun. It's pretty simple, just egg, noodles and black bean sauce but it was one of the best I've had. I liked the menu because it had selections that's unique such as the Beef Tataki and others that's more filling like the Black Bean Noodles.

As for price, I thought it was fair considering the quality of the dish. However, if you're really hungry, the bill can stack up, but that's pretty much a given in any tapas restaurant! They are aiming to create a more experiential and enjoyable atmosphere, which I can totally get, just give me a glass of wine! :) It's a great place to swing by after work or to have a drink with someone that is slightly more intimate than usual, especially in its proximity. All in all, I was very impressed by the overall presentation and selections.

The restaurant was busy with patrons slurping noodles or ordering some of their own to slurp. I thought they would be full of college students since it is across from CSN but there was quite a mixed group of generations when we stopped in for dinner. 

We sat at the bar and was greeted by the owner and his big smile, ready to welcome you.  He showed us few new additions on the menu, specials boards, and ordering sheets. You can go with a pre-planned bowl of ramen, or use the ""make your own"" section on the ordering sheets...like BYOR...put anything you want and chef's not going to say NO to you. 

We ordered 
-Fried Oysters
-Curry Ramen with fried egg & kurobuta sausage added on
-Dolsot BiBimbop
-Sake Flight

The oysters were very pleasant with crispy outside and juicy inside. They came with a dipping sauce, but the sauce was not necessary since the oysters are flavorful by themselves. Bibimbop was average, but we asked for some chili sauce to crank up the heat...their housemade chili-garlic sauce was very, very good. My favorite was of course the Curry Ramen...rich in curry and very well textured with thick noodle...I added fried egg and Kurobuta sausage, yummy.

The service was pleasant and prompt...I will come back with my little hungry Loves!

No menu fatigue here (Thank You!): a handful of options in each category plus five or six specials on the board all showcasing a build your own ramen sheet. Welcoming and simple.

Our only disappointment was with the appetizer course. We ordered the chicken karaage and panko breaded oysters. The karaage was lightly breaded and well seasoned but most pieces were over-cooked. They were nearing a deep-fried jerky state on several of the pieces. The more tender ones were very tasty and we'd give this one another try next time. The oysters were another story. While cooked properly, the quality of the mollusks themselves was very poor. They were mealy and tasteless. Neither of the ones we tasted warranted a second bite nor invited trying the third one. A small setback before an exceptional main course.

We each built our own ramen bowl; one with tonkotsu / chashu and one with shoyu / katsu as the base. Both broths were rich, deep, and flavorful and were the perfect canvas for the chosen meats. The braised greens (mustard and spinach, one in each) were well seasoned and added great flavor. The real star, however, was the ramen-style egg. The whites were firm with a little bite but the yolks were juuuuuust starting to gel. Still creamy and luxurious but with enough body not to dissipate quickly into the broth. A rare and decadent surprise! Both soups were outstanding and the bottom of the bowl came way too quickly.

Their pre-selected ramen dishes begin at $8.95 but are very limited, so you end up spending an extra $3-4 to make it a true ramen dish.

I went with the pre-selected breaded chicken with thick noodles and added corn, bean sprouts, egg, and spicy paste.  The broth was excellent, and the noddles were above par.  The breaded chicken didn't really fit well with ramen in my opinion.  The best part was the paste - small in quantity, but packed huge, delicious heat.  

The service was some of the slowest I have ever seen.  They're not attentive at all, though friendly when you do catch their glance.

There was a good crowd, but plenty of seating.  Very clean, and there's huge TVs along the wall and behind the bar.  

I ordered the signature chaschu.  The size of the bowl was the perfect portion!  Comes with 3 pieces of chaschu, thin noodles, and a very flavorful milky broth.  

Interesting enough, they offer curry ramen.  Basically, just what you'd expect in japanese curry sprinkled with a load of ramen noodles.  

I thought the chaschu pieces were thin and didn't have the ""melt in your mouth"" tenderness like Monta does.  Nonetheless, it's still good.  

The noodles were thinner than what I'm used to.  Either that, or there was less than I'm used to.

The broth was very rich and had great hints of garlic, which is awesome because I love garlic!  

Also got the moko bun.  Moko bun comes as one, but they will cut it in half for you if you feel like sharing.  Has beef and kimchi in a sweet steamed bun.  

If you check in yelp, you get a free scoop of delicious green tea ice cream!  And yes, it was super delicious!  I would say green tea ice cream tastes like powdered white chocolate.

Coming from Chicago, I've had plenty of Korean fusion food before, but Moko really stands out in terms of how unique their take on the concept is, and how well they pull it off. The flavor profiles of the dishes are quite varied and work really well - stand outs for me included the sea bass paired with a slaw of mung beans and carrots in spicy sauce, and the braised Korean short ribs paired with potatoes gratin. Really, though, every dish was good - you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

Ryan, the owner, was our server, and provided exceptional service - very friendly and attentive while helping us navigate our food allergies, giving recommendations, and even throwing in a complimentary dessert at the end. The food is very fairly priced for the quality - with several rounds of drinks included, the bill came to about $40/person. The atmosphere is elegant but unfussy - perfect for all sorts of occasions.

3591763,2014-05-29,7,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"Review is a little more towards 4.5 stars for me~

Items sampled were 30 Hour Sous Vide Berkshire Pork Belly, Black Bean Sauce Noodle, Beef Tataki, Chicken Pottage, and Spicy Chicken Thigh, in that order.

Moko is the newest take on Modern Asian Fusion, though in this case it is a twist on Korean food. I haven't sampled much fusion Korean, but this first foray had some excellent flavors and the execution of each dish was spot on.

My personal favorite was the Pork Belly - it was tender, but the fat from the pork belly was not too powerful like in some variations. While the portion is quite small for a 13 dollar price point, the tastes are top notch. In my How Korean Is It scale (HKII), I'd say it was a 5/10. Bonus points for the little roasted veggies and the underlying mung bean crepe. This could be served at any high-end restaurant, as far as I'm concerned.

The Black Bean Noodle was another excellent tasting dish, though this one was more in line with its roots. I'd say it's like an HKII 8/10. I was slurping up all the sauce afterwards too. This one is a little heartier than some of the meat-only dishes.

Next followed the Beef Tataki which had some very tender and moist slices of high quality meat. This one wasn't particularly memorable to me for some reason, but everything about it tasted great and the presentation was good too. HKII 6/10.

The Chicken Thigh was probably where I had the most to be picky about - Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent piece of chicken thigh, cooked to be moist and tender and the sauce is quite tasty. It just lacked some substance - maybe a breading or if it was served with a tiny bit of starch or veggies even. The sauce puts this at HKII 4/10.

I enjoyed the Chicken Pottage quite a bit - it was the heartiest and most filling dish of the evening and had some very good flavor to it. Even for a porridge, it looked impressive to me visually. I don't remember the last time I had Samgyetang so I can't really judge on How Korean It Is... But my guess would have been like a 6/10. 

I would definitely tell a person going here not to expect traditional Korean food but a modern take on fusion. I'm looking forward to trying out some more of the flavors here as a lot of them were nuanced and complex, compared to your typical Korean dishes.

While I felt my meal was very satisfying to my taste buds, I did feel like I wanted more - now given I was sharing with two other people we could have certainly tried some more but we decided to save it for the next trip. If there was one thing I could suggest for the menu, I'd like some more heartier options (almost like a filler!) Moko is a Tapas bar, and Tapas often means you always have the option of paella and such, so having like a shared bowl of ""modern"" bibimbap or something might be a fun twist on that idea.

Price adds up here, but not so much more than a typical tapas place with a very high quality. I felt the effort put into each dish, and the plating pictures on the Yelp are not dolled up at all. Big props to the chef for that and I hope the quality remains!",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,12,7,5,FaAvyhof6gQs4Y9BXUP9Bw

The broth came in a styrofoam container, the noodles and the chashu in a plastic bowl.  Maybe the delivery service took too long but the broth was no longer very hot.  The noodles were clumped and had a rubbery consistency, even after they were added and soaked in the broth for a while.  The chashu was a little tough, even after I gave them a long bath in the broth.  But I think my main complaint was that the broth seemed kind of bland.  It just really had no flavor to it.  I was hoping maybe the flavoring had drifted to a deeper undersurface layer but no matter how I stirred, it was the same bland broth.

The menu was limited but what there was on the menu was great. I'd say they'd been open about a month when I first went there, this is my third visit, I was last here about 8-9 months ago.

I ordered shrimp fried rice, the shrimp were so small that it looked as if bugs were imbedded in the rice. I actually have never seen shrimp that small. I ordered a coke, which the server brought to me and poured for me. That was the last time I was to see her for awhile, she never checked back on me.

The place is pretty small so I guess they feel they only need one server for lunch but that's wrong, since I think lunch is probably their busy time. The server would go to other tables, drop things off, and then look down at the floor when she left the table. There was never any time to just catch her eye in passing. I finally stared at the kitchen waiting for her to come out and flagged her down that way.

When I finally was able to get the check, I asked for a box and a cup for my (full) coke. When she came back she brought my boxed food and I reiterated that I needed a cup, that's when she told me they didn't have to go cups.

I can compare this to the high end restaurants on the strip! Yes it's that's good! I usually don't like tapas but this is exceptional. The decor is very nicely done except there are no cushions on the seats or benches that's the only complaint that I have. The service was great as well. Very nice for a date night.

I recommended Moko and she agreed to try it. We each ordered Ramen and about halfway through our meal, I noticed a fly in my broth. I was shocked and I stopped eating. My friend noticed there was an issue and told me I needed to inform the server of the issue (my friend is in the service industry). I sat quietly as she informed the server of the fly and showed him. The server said ""oh sorry, are you done?""  I told him I was done. He asked if we were ready for the check. He dropped off a check without a discount or an apology. He didn't offer to make the food over. He hardly even acknowledged that he served me food with a fly cooked in it. I'm so sad to say I won't be returning. Due to the fact there was no apology or offer to make things right, I felt that this may be something that is acceptable or happens often.",MzzyGOTAJQK4t-3BGQUR_w,0,0,1,Y17V-P9apG_WlM4ccwZChQ

On to the food...
Sampled quite a few dishes
Chicken pottage
10 hour pork belly
30 hour sous vide Berkshire pork
Braised short rib
Smoked mackerel pasta
Huge prawn risotto 
Cold cucumber soup 
Black bean noodoohs ""jajangmyun""
Hamachi/salmon sashimi 
And creme brûlée to top it all off.

All plates were visually appealing and tantalizing to the tastebuds.  Not your typical ""Korean"" BBQ place.
The cuisine is not a feeble attempt at another Asian fusion joint.  Chef Hong is executing a twist on Korean with a sophisticated palate and playful combinations of flavors.  They are fine tuning the menu as the venue is breaking in but I can see the direction the food is going and it should be a bright and tasty future!

The owner was super friendly and welcomed me by name as I walked in (I had a reservation through Yelp). The service was impeccable. 

The menu is simple and the perfect size. Small portion asian fusion tapas - sample different small plates until satisfied. We started off with the 10 hour braised pork belly. The pork belly was flavorful and tender. The black raspberry marinated salt was quite creative, but I loved the piece of crispy sweet potato that topped it off. Other reviews raved about the beef tataki, but the seared sirloin was the only miss for me. I thought the micro greens went quite well with the beef, but the sirloin was too chewy and not at all moist. 

For the noodle dishes, the favorite seems to be the black bean noodle with poached egg. Yeah, get that damn sexy perfectly poached egg yolk. My personal favorite dish of the evening? Get the spicy honey chicken wings. You will not be disappointed. If you've ever had the famous San Tung chicken wings from San Francisco, you will appreciate this version. Perfectly fried with cubes of pickled daikon to cleanse your palette. Our dinner ended with complimentary red bean mochi. 

I think the only factor holding Moko back from filling its tables is the location. If this bistro was located on Spring Mountain, it would be full nightly.  Spread the word and check it out!",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,15,13,4,oebMwtxfpGGfDGlOiJL5Hw

I went for lunch/dinner today after seeing a Facebook post from Moko stating they had curry ramen. I am not a ramen aficionado but I like having soup when it's as cold as it's been the last few days.  

I walked in and the owner, WooSuk, greeted me because I've been there a couple of times.  I sat myself at the bar and the server brought me the menu and the sheet where you check the ramen you want and check off any add ons you wish.  She sensed I was a tenderfoot, so she talked me through the procedure and did the checking off for me.

My order was for curry ramen with an extra of homemade chasu.  While waiting for the ramen, I watched Navy pull away in their football bowl game--Anchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh!

In a short time, WooSuk brought me my bowl of ramen.  The noodles were very hot and the curry had a good spiciness.  Mixed in the soup were some bean spouts, spinach, and scallions.  With the soup, I had a diet Coke.  The soup was very filling and quite tasty!  I need to go back and get the pako with my ramen but the curry is excellent!

Good food, quick service, ambiance and friendly at Moko. 

Food
Good portions, tasty, cleaned and nice presentation. I like their bento box here since I got to try so many things. Fried oysters was delicious, crunchy outside and juicy inside but not too watery. 

Quick Service
The way to ordering their foods here. Checking off the paper menu it was fun and no mistakes. You are pretty much in control of what you wanted. Our server also kept checking on us in case we might needed help. 

Ambiance 
Nice seating on the counter area. For me it's perfect for a single person dining. Cute little place make you feel comfortable. 

Friendly
I am a server of course I always looking for good, seamless and awesome service. Food can be good but if service sucks I probably won't be back. 

I truly enjoyed watching our server (he was alone and the time 1:30pm) he took care of at least 15 people during that time and had an ability to flipped tables pretty quickly while still checked up on people, refilled their drinks, said hi to new customers, closed out tables and said goodbye. 
it wasn't easy! All that mentioned with only one busser who cleaned their tables. On top of that the place was packed and people still kept coming in! Two thumbs up on that. 

I really want this place to do well. Come dine at Moko and you will see everyone here truly bring their passion to work. Let's support our local business.",gJFC6DaM5guitce6FSFYxw,1,2,5,xZKSd3w0TVKHQEWG0CJO_w

Excellent service from two ladies. They were courteous and attentive. I thought the atmosphere was unique for a ramen shop. It's trendy and has this urban feel to it. There are two flat screen TVs above the bar, one was playing football and other one was playing CSI? I am not too sure, haha. 

Their ordering system is also unique. Instead of telling your order to the servers, you mark the ramen you want along with any additional toppings you want to add on a paper. This paper looked somewhat confusing but a friendly server was kind enough to guide me through. At the end, I chose their chashu ramen which is a bowl of thin ramen noodles in tonkotsu broth with generous amount of chashu. 

Took a sip...oh dayum. Their tonkotsu broth is one of a kind. Rich, but not heavy. Noodles were cooked perfectly, or at least was cooked to my liking. Chashu? Holy moly. It just melted, ridiculously tender. Some may find that their chashu has a lot of fat...but who cares about fat when you are eating a bowl of heaven?

It's a smaller location, so our group of 11 took up a large portion of the restaurant. Our waiter brought us our menus pretty quickly after arriving, and took our drink orders and appetizers. I asked for an order of their Edamame. Which were okay, nothing amazing (I wish I had went with the garlic flavored instead) Another person in our group ordered the beef Gyoza which were pretty good. How their menu works, is you can either choose one of their signature ramen or build your own. I went with the Shoyu ramen added corn, bean sprouts and chicken. The broth was super delicious. To me, this is the most vital part of a good bowl of ramen. The noodles were cooked just right, and servings were generous. As for service, it took over 30 minutes to receive our food, which didn't really bother me, however a few people in our group began to grow impatient. Our waiter refilled our waters every so often, but he wouldn't put ice, so we basically drank warm water for the remainder of our meal. A friend ordered their shrimp tempura, which say come in an order of 5, but he received only 4. He brought it up to the waiter, and was told he would receive the other shortly, however our waiter never brought it out to him. He ended up giving him 50% off when it came time to pay our bills. There were a few times when he would forget to bring things out, or took very long to take care of a request, but his service was pretty good other than that.

Since I am trying to get over a bad cold, I caved in to my daughter's request for a ""ramen place"" in hopes for some ""comfort soup"".

I thought I'd try the curry ramen and jack it up with the beef bulgogi, spinach, and boiled egg.  We also got the Miso and Fiery Ramen, which we had accompanied with our appetizer selection of the Karaage Chicken, fried oysters, and a Moko bun.  

Wasn't too crazy about my curry ramen...I expected a more brothy kind of soup, but it was more of a thick curry soup.  My daughters spicy-spicy Fiery Ramen was no joke...It left a burning/tingling sensation in my throat for 10 min...and my husband was content with his miso.  I was disappointed in the Karaage Chicken, I expected a bursting with flavor experience from the photos, but it was ""good"" (c'mon!  I wasn't feelin it) not great...fried oysters, good...Moko bun, delicious!  I also ordered Oolong tea, and expected it to be a ""hot"" tea.

Moko Ramen Bar is located on Charleston across from the main campus of College of Southern Navada. You'll find it right next to a Tropical Smoothie Cafe (with one of the more awkward drive-thru setups that I've laid eyes on), and there was plenty of one-hour limit parking in the later afternoon.

They used to serve Asian tapas, but I never visited them back then, so all I had to go on was a couple of promising reports from friends. I went more traditional today with the Chashu Ramen ($8.95). It took perhaps 20+ minutes for my ramen to arrive (with apologies from the server), but I have to admit that the wait was worth it.

Firstly, the tonkotsu broth was rich. Although it's not the most complex or satisfying broth at I've had, I enjoyed it overall. There's perhaps a hint of ginger that's usually not present. Next taste was the thin noodles, which were just chewy enough. The real stand-out is the copious amount of tender chashu, about four pieces in an otherwise modestly sized bowl. They wasn't extremely flavorful, but they were meaty and can be enjoyed in every bite. This should satisfy those who normally would pay a premium for additional chashu.

What some people might miss is the like traditional standard accompaniments as bamboo, kikurage (both of these seemingly aren't even available as add-ons), egg, and nori. I wouldn't say that I particularly missed any of those at the time. Personally, I was satisfied with the green onions and the very thin red chili slivers that were included. For those do who want extras or are customizing their own bowl, there are a range of extra add-ons for $1-$3.95 (proteins at the higher end of costs) in addition to the choice of four broths (tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, tonkotsu-shoyu) and noodles (thick or thin).

I'm wholly unfamiliar with their old incarnation, but what I had at the new Moko Ramen Bar was among the better ramen experiences in town. It's usually a bit far from home for me, but I'll most likely return to try the curry ramen or to customize my own ramen with a miso broth.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,39,34,4,QmloH325Ddcc2yNrGyAYLA

So Moko Ramen it was- As we wallked into this small restaurant  (as most Ramen Bars are) we could tell the waitress was a little overwhelmed as 3 empty tables still had the leftover mess from the previous customers. But we were seated rather quickly & our table was wiped down so moving on.....  We didnt like that all the pics of the Ramen were located high on the back wall that is actually behind most of the customers seating. So I had to get out of my seat just to see the pics. I think most customers are more visual & a pic to the description of the food is rather helpful if located on the menu. Anyways, I decided to build my own Ramen- Miso Broth, Thin Noodles, Bulgogi, Veggie Croquette, Garlic Chips, Pickles, Seaweed, fish cakes, & green onions. He got the Spicy Ramen which the waitress mentioned that he would love because he likes spicy. We ordered Chicken Karaage & Veggie Eggrolls for our Appetizers. Our appetizers came out rather quickly & we liked the Karaage but unfortunately the egg rolls were tiny & not filled much at all. Now, the filling that was in there was tasty but these egg rolls needed more fullness. Wanted to try their Moko Dumplings but there were sold out already - they make only 100 pieces a day and when they're gone, they're gone! Next time. Our soups finally arrive! My Ramen looked delish & after a few pics I couldn't wait to dig in. My hubs Soup on the other hand was to our surprise not a soup at all. There was no broth, just a bowl of thick curvy noodles with alot of  spicy stuff & some cheese. I could tell immediately by his face that he was not happy at all So of course we called our waitress & we asked all our questions & told her he would like to switch his dish out for a Ramen Soup bowl. She said thats fine but suggested that we should add broth to the spicy noodles & see first if he would like it better that way so we agreed. Seeing that we were disappointed with this dish & I was half way done eating already & he was just sitting there I think his broth should've came right out but it took a while. Not cool So finally here's the broth, he added it to the noodles & didn't like it. So we moved onto an actual soup with well ya know SOUP in it. Lol He got a Tonkotsu Broth, thin noodles, Bulgogi, Pickles,Red Pepper Paste, Garlic, Green Onions, Fish Cakes, & Bean Sprouts. Thank goodness he was satisfied with that. While his soup was still being made I decided to order a Moko Bun, I asked the waitress about the time frame it would take & she assured me that his soup & my bun would come out at the same time afterall there was only a few minutes left of his soup to be done & to make the bun. Well his soup comes, he's half way done eating & I'm wondering where my Moko Bun is? I ask the waitress & she says shes sorry but she never ordered it & never added it to my bill. Well thats not the point, if she realized that she didnt put in my order- ask me if I still would like what I ordered rather than just assume that I don't want it anymore, don't add it to my bill & just hope that I don't remember. Again, not cool. But I still wanted it, so it came & it was yummy but not hot or warm. I paid for it separately as I already paid for our entire bill but I think as a courtesy at this point it should've been on the house but whatever. A few times the Hubs had to get up to get us napkins & ask for a menu. When his final soup came he wanted clean utensils, he asked another waitress & she dropped him 2 straws & left. So he had to get up again to ask for utensils. For a small place they may need extra help. All in all I liked my food, the Hubs wasn't impressed & service was a bit lacking & an important tidbit would be to specify that the Spicy Ramen has no broth.",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,0,1,3,lo0OluiFHjFmS6yeb68DxQ

I started out with the house salad. It was almost a meal in itself. Great collection of mixed greens, with a dressing that should be bottled. Great starter. 

I then ordered the Spicy Bean Salmon. Unreal!!!! Could have stopped there, but why, when we were on a roll. 

My wife ordered the Spicy Black Bean Noodle. We shared it. She said she'll be trying to make this one at home. I throughly enjoyed it. 

To top it off, my wife enjoyed the more than generous portion of Chicken Wings, pictured in one of the reviews below. It was right on par with one of the best Chicken places in Los Angeles, that makes the trip to LA worth the drive!

After wondering in a wasteland of mediocre and second rate eateries, oh to find this Oasis!!!

Here's the amazing part; the tab was actually under $30 for two. 

Ok, you guys trying to impress girls with Gourmet food, on a College Budget; this is your place. The ambiance is very good, and even though it's tapas, they dress it up with linen napkins and good flatware.

I had the curry ramen yesterday and it was extremely tasty. I also like that this place is accommodating to vegetarians who can't have animal broth - not many other ramen places in the city offer that.,W1lnPWjmqxPJhJdl6iWSNg,1,0,5,g-0v55HM8f7sSLpKSOQNJA
4270822,2018-04-18,0,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"Moko Ramen Offers both Japanese and Korean dishes. There was only one chef at the restaurant so they only offered a selected amount of dishes, mostly from the Ramen menu. The other chef probably cooks the Korean cuisine.

You receive a paper to fill out on what you would like to order. You can also create your own ramen. I ordered the thick wavy noodle, Tonkotsu broth, with Nori (Seaweed). The Ramen comes with Beansprout, Naruto (Fish cake type), and Green Onion. The Tonkotsu broth was nice and light; I really enjoyed it.

We ordered Kurobuta Sausage and Takoyaki to share. The Kurobuta Sausage was juicy and tender. The Takoyaki was delicious too; I recommend at least trying Takoyaki once to see if you enjoy it or not.

If you are Vegetarian or Vegan, they have optional chooses for your Ramen or meal.

As soon as it is set in front of you, the aroma will mesmerize your nose. As soon as you take your first slurp of the noodles, you will feel warmth and a savory mixture of ramen and curry broth. As soon as you finish your ramen, you will want to ask for seconds.  

The only reason I've given this review 4 stars is because I would have liked to have had zucchini and sliced bell pepper slices in the Ramen to give it a more well rounded Curry- Ramen taste. Regardless of my petty demands, this Ramen was amazing! I can't remember when I first came to Moko Ramen but it will surely not be the last. 
Marquis was an attentive and polite server. This Ramen place has a casual but intimate atmosphere.

It was really confusing as to if we were supposed to seat ourselves or order at the bar since we weren't greeted until about two minutes after walking in. 

After we were seated we once again had to help ourselves with ordering and turn in our slip at the bar since no one was coming around. We weren't presented with waters until about a minute before our food came out and none of the staff was very friendly at all. 

As for the food I enjoyed that they had vegetarian friendly options. I went with the Curry Ramen. I liked the flavor, but the broth was super thick. My bf has the tonkatsu Ramen and he wasn't a super fan. He said the taste was almost store bought.

Let me start off by saying that this review is based on a lunch visit because it seems that this place is a hit for dinnertime.  The service provided by Ryan is definitely very refreshing because you don't get one on one service like that in too many places anymore. The restaurant is nicely decorated and is rather artsy, ""me like"". 

Now on to the food.  

The two dishes we tried was Green Tea Ramen and Spicy Popcorn Bento.  My hubs wanted the bulgogi ramen, but there was a miscommunication and that ramen was not ordered.  We also caught them on the tail end where they were closing up for dinner. 

The presentation of the spicy popcorn was great.  Everything that surrounded it complimented the chicken, but the spicy popcorn didn't impress.  I probably did it to myself because popcorn chicken never impresses me because that means tiny chicken with lots of breading....which is what I got.  If it really was served kaarage style as in large pieces of dark chicken, it might just be good. 

Green Tea Ramen...sorry it tasted like packaged ramen.  Me, I'd call it saimin.  I'm not writing this place off because I def want to give it another try.  But on this visit, I say ""meh""",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,2,2,3,D09izO3aihnUTWz5j_TAzg

The food definitely deserves 5 stars. Our group ordered a Tofu Salad (the dressing was amazing), seaweed salad, beef gyoza (perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside with a great tasting dipping sauce), and kimchi to share. All great choices for appetizers. For my main meal I ordered the curry ramen and added a boiled egg ($1.00 extra) and corn (.50). This was amazing! I loved that it had spinach and pickled radishes. Such a unique tasting ramen! I fell in love!

Service was a bit heartbreaking. We had to wait over 45 minutes for our appetizers to come out and almost an hour for our food. And when our food came out, we weren't even given spoons to enjoy the amazing broth. When we asked for spoons the waitress kindly said she was ""polishing"" the spoons. About 7 minutes later comes back with the spoons but by then we were already almost done with our broth. The waitress was very polite and seemed stressed out so we tried to be understanding although we had a movie to make and were a bit pressed on time.

Although it is a small restaurant, there was only one waitress so do not go here if you only have a short time frame. I really do agree with a lot of the reviews and think that this is the best ramen place around town!",CeQh69cx7UEcAcqM-zFMuw,10,8,3,IaBGPXyu1Idvlbg83P7pCg

My boyfriend and I were looking for late night tapas close to Red Rock and found this yelp gem. Definitely see why the reviews are so high. 

I wasn't sure if they were open as we drove by because the restaurant was empty. It could be so easy to overlook. Although, having the restaurant to ourselves was nice. The inside is very clean and modern with a romantic/chill variety of music that I appreciated. 

We ordered three dishes: beef tataki, black bean noodles, and the 10 hour pork belly. The dishes were brought out in this order and only when we had completed the one before. This really allowed us to enjoy each one separately.

Without going into too much detail, I have to say that I would not change a thing about each of the three dishes we ordered. The flavors were perfectly paired and really unique. I found myself gushing over the plating as well. The dishes looked as delicious as they tasted. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu when I return with a bigger appetite!

The restaurant encourages sharing, so we all tried a little of three different dishes: the crispy sesame chicken, the bulgogi noodle, and the original grilled teriyaki chicken. 
1. The teriyaki chicken met expectation - sweet, smoky, and served with white rice. 
2. The bulgogi noodle was full of umami - little bits of beef, onion, and substantial yummy noodles covered in the bulgogi sauce. 
3. The sesame chicken was my favorite - the crunchy panko coating is infused with sesame goodness and the chicken is tender and juicy.

4968016,2015-01-08,5,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"For Christmas dinner, making a reservation for 14 different people is difficult. We were able to come here and get some set menus. There were 3 different versions mostly with the same dishes and some with different ones. There was 1 one with 5 dishes and the other 2 had 7 dishes. To be honest, the size of the 7 dishes was too much. 

The 7 dishes were the following and in this order:
Eggplant salad - since I don't like eggplant, I only had a small part of it. Everyone else enjoyed it a lot. 
Chilean sea bass - small piece of sea bass with some spicy veggies underneath. The sea bass was very nicely cooked. Flaky and delicious. The hot sauce mixed with the carrots, onion and sprouts were delicious together. Probably one of my favorite dishes.
Chicken thigh - Chicken thigh wrapped around kimchi, zucchini,  and other veggies. The thigh was so moist and sauce was great too!
Pork belly - the 5 courses had the 10 hour braised pork belly. This was definitely more flavorful and had a nice texture. Definitely chewier. The 7 courses had the 30 hour sous vided belly that was more chewy. The accompaniments were forgettable but both had the same sweet potato. 
Short rib - probably my favorite dish. The short rib was nicely cooked and the potatoes that came with it were so delicious.  Gratin yum. 
 
The other dishes that came with the 7 courses are: 
Seared salmon - salad with basically lightly seared salmon. Very rare salmon, almost sashimi style. 
Chicken porridge - it's not as good as my mom makes it. But it's as good as any of the restaurant ones I've had. 
Beef takaki - a little rare for my tastes. Seared very lightly. The sauce (bean paste aioli) was all over it. A bit too much for my tastes. 

The lady who was vegetarian has jiajiangmen and she said it was delicious.  Smelled good too. 

Dessert was a berry creme brulee. It tasted a bit funny. Personally I've had quite a few creme brulee in my time and my friend makes a better one.  

Overall,  food was good. Service was great. So accommodating for the Chinese parents we have. 

As a suggestion, I would say that for big groups have everyone order the same menu so it makes it easier for the chef and waitresses to remember who got what. Some people in our group got the wrong items. Also because the people who got 7 courses got their items out of order. The seared salmon and beef takaki were last before dessert and it was an awkward to eat my meal like that.",4RUXeyp_Af2C5t9JFyJlBQ,4,4,4,sown7f6IaHiJAtRCGxb7Yw
4974786,2017-06-30,5,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"I was led to Moko because of their super high Yelp ratings, but now I realize it was based on their menu from years past. They currently specialize in ramen and it's a far cry from their expansive menu from before.

On that note, my ramen experience there was a 2-3 star experience. The broth was just awful, and I don't know what happened. The husband ordered the same broth but for some reason his tasted so much better.  We could only guess that the corn and bean sprouts significantly watered down the soup in mine, whereas the juice from his meat added so much more flavor to his soup.

Service took forever from start to finish.  We don't know if everyone just happened to all come in at the same time and the lone waiter was just overwhelmed and couldn't handle it all.  We were sitting there with two starving kids and waiting for menus.  Beverages took a long time too and the wait for food was just insane.  The chicken karaage arrived, but we had no utensils.  I had to request extra bowls more than once.  After they did finally drop off our ramen, the waiter came by to check if it was the correct order. So they obviously had issues going on back there in the kitchen.   

I ate the ramen because I was starving and couldn't be bothered to send it back.  I just know I won't bother returning.

Edited to add: This experience did happen in October 2016, so this review is a bit overdue. The owner did reach out to me to find out more details, which I do appreciate.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,3,2,zy-3gg8Uc2PIuotkdp82qQ

And for once...

Impressive.

A cross between Korean and other Asian cuisines using  western ingredients.  Each dish is very well constructed.  Each with a nod towards Korean flavors.  Each using those flavors to elevate other ingredients.

True standouts after sampling almost the entire menu include:

10 hour braised and the 30 hour sous vide Berkshire pork belly.  The braised belly, with it's perfectly seared finish, tender and juicy, the sous vide belly, meltingly tender, well rendered.  Both pre-marinated in soy for an earthy sweetness.  Both served in natural jus with kimchi crepe.  Crispy shoestring sweet potato adds the perfect textural foil.

The cold smoked yellowtail and salmon, both over apricot wood that imparts a gentle sweetness is impressive.  The first garnished with apple, the second with orange.  A dusting of ground laver and a dressing of a apricot sauce mixed with Korean chili powder for subtle heat that enhances the natural sweetness of the cold smoked fish..

Not to be missed, a perfectly pan roasted monk fish with over a bed of root veg dressed with Korean chili powder,.  A shrimp risotto (sake steamed shrimp, shitake mushroom risotto topped with a crispy deep fried shrimp head.  The black Bean sauce noodles, so seemingly simple but once you mix the egg yolk through the dish, explodes with velvety, fermented goodness.  Finally a smoked mackerel pasta; think mentaiko with  morsels of slightly bitter fish atop pasta mixed with just the right amount of kimchee.  

Excellent service.  Sit at the bar for the best experience.  The only weakness is the wine, sake, soju list.

Strip worthy at off Strip prices.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,25,25,4,HtCeR3MBu0GOFT749JkXbA

The seaweed salad was a typical seaweed salad, nothing new. The karaage was hot and crispy and came with a spicy dipping sauce. The bulgogi bowl came with chunks of bulgogi beef, rice, and tons of green onions. It was a pretty good serving for the price. The meat was a touch on the salty side but decent overall. The best part of dinner was the ramen. The tonkatsu shoyu broth was so rich and flavorful! I was tempted to ask for a bowl of just the broth to go but I controlled myself. The ramen was just right, nice and chewy, and the pieces of chashu were huge. Huge serving size for the price.

The first time I got one of their special ramens but can't remember what. For some reason it lacked flavor. It tasted like it needed something...I'm just not sure what. There was an odd flavor I couldn't figure out & it drove me crazy. The 2nd time I got tonkotsu ramen. I didn't know that the tonkotsu ramen only came with broth & a couple of toppings but no actual pork (chashu). I guess you need to order that specific chashu ramen to get that. That confused me but I guess I wasn't looking at the menu correctly. Just make sure to ask what comes in what. Like other ramen places, you can add toppings as well. I feel like the ramen broths are just missing something. Both times they were bland. I'm still giving it 3 stars since customer service is pretty good & it's not terrible.

I had three thoughts running through my head as my wife and I were walking out.

1. Outfuckingstanding!!
2. I am having this, this and this next time.
3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  

Eating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    

Just discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's ""A Thousand Years"" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  

It's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their ""Black Bean Noodle"" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   

They offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. 

The grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  

I entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,81,54,5,op5SwXDVKTdpdsn1FOAk1g

It came with Thai seasoned chicken, white rice, broccoli, small side salad, and a small cucumber salad as well. At first glance to me if seemed like a lot of food. I didn't like that the salad and veggies were doused in some house dressing. Pretty much made the healthy stuff unhealthy without you even trying. Why didn't they put it on the side?? No idea.

First, I wanna say that My parents were Korean/Chinese restaurant owners for over 20+ years & have won year over year local & nationally recognized awards from the local newspaper to Zagat.

Homemade Korean food has always been my mom's greatest attribute to my upbringing, she was born old school on a farm in S. Korea - she knows how to cook the real good old fashion Korean stuff.

First time at this cute inviting restaurant - across from CSN college.  I tried the Bibimbap & was surprised how tasty it was & closely resembled my mother's cooking back home.

This will be my first go to Korean restaurant in 7 yrs, at least for the Bibimbap (don't know about other dishes, but I'll try latter on)

5599572,2014-07-21,2,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"Well well well...what do we have hear?  ...a new and fresh tapas joint near the office??  This place was shared to me by my undercover freelance foodie co-worker and I quickly jumped on it with my patnah about two weeks ago.  Unfortunately for us, the place was closed for staff training.  Yet, that all changed today, as I slid through for a quick lunch session.
Moko is fairly tight and seats less than 35 total, which can be intimate and what you are looking for.  I am always looking to eat in peace and quiet and want to hear myself chewing (sorry STK).  Upon entry, you will immediately notice the new and pristine decor, wall back splash tiling, laminate flooring and calming lounge music.  Luckily the position of entryway faces south so may be okay during the later summer hours without getting toasted alive by the radiant sun rays.

I was promptly greeted by the lone staff member who was polite and personable to an extent, then again I was the only person in when I popped up.  An acquaintance of him showed a few minutes later for a meal, thank goodness.  I really didn't want to feel like I was browsing in a liquor store with a bottle of Old E and someone creeps up on with their dusting/espionage role uttering, ""hurry up and buy!!!""  Okay, okay, don't lynch me for my poor scenario choice referencing ""Boyz n the Hood,"" I ain't O-Dogg but oh boy was cool in my book.  (J/K to my Kornz brethren)  

It was a hot day and I was hoping for some ice barley water, but I was sadly mistaken, or perhaps generalizing again.  However, after obviously and overtly Yelping, I think I got the attention of the waiter/server/owner to get me some unsweetened ice tea on the house.  Word to the wise, totally play out your Yelping efforts, it definitely gets the staff to come correct.  

I was provided the lunch menu that was extremely limited.  I'm talking 6 items tops and all starches.  I did peep the dinner menu which was still pretty limited but offered more signature dishes that everybody seems to be raving about.  10 & 30 hour pork belly?  Bulgogi meatball, sea bass and more??  Although I was hoping to find a cold noodle dish to combat the Las Vegas heat, no such dish was offered so resorted to the Jajangmyun instead.   When served, it was hot and the noodle texture was just right, but may be overpriced at $7 bones for glorified comfort food.  You can barely taste the ingredients that is sort of drowned by the black bean sauce and the pork tasted precooked/frozen (wish that was aged a few years), pretty greasy when getting to the end, but yummy nonetheless (might be salty for most).  

I guess I am just used to making instant $1 zha jiang mian.  Speaking of which, you will find a grip of variations on this dish, which I am pretty sure is Chinese in origin and literally means fried sauce noodles or something.  I tried a Chinese, Japanese and Korean version of this dish and have a nostalgic value from childhood times.  Some Side dishes would be a good Compliment during lunch since the menu is limited, but there I go again, generalizing Korean cuisine as if banchan is a requirement.  Okay, I'm gonna stop.

Luckily, it appear that the menu is still being tweaked and soon the menu will be expanded to include a larger variety.  Hopefully the location caters to the rush from CSN across the street and I only hope for the best for the owners.  In total honesty, I would have rated my experience with 3 stars since the food was not mind blowing by any means, yet interesting.  I did appreciate the free iced tea that helped wash down the Jajangmyun rather nicely, so that has to be at least a 0.5 star bump, rounding up the rating to 4 stars total.  I believe that the place is very capable of earning a solid 4-5 rating if they keep up the good work and expand the menu.  Only Stone IPA and Fat tire was found on tap and would like to see the selection develop here as well.  Not a big fan of Korean beers.  Too light and bland fire my palette.   So bust out the soju!!!

Went on Saturday 6-11-16 at 6PM.  $55.00 got us two ramens, two drinks, a dessert, a salad, and some edamame.  This restaurant is located on Charleston between Jones & Rainbow.  

Our waiter was american and very new and said he had never eaten ramen before he started working there.  WHAT?  Where have you been, mister, under a rock??? When I eat ramen I want some asian lady slingin' noodles at me...it just feels more authentic.  Is that racist? Whatever- the heart wants what it wants.  

I chose to create my own ramen.  They gave me a sheet with all the toppings and a pencil and I just ticked the box next to what I want.  I chose thick noodles, extra noodles, chasu, egg, spinach, and corn.  My creation wound up being $15 which I thought was a little steep.  I really liked the addition of the spinach and overall the broth was pretty tasty although the chasu was small and tough.  

Husband got curry ramen which I thought was brilliant.  I snagged a bite of it and thought it was delicious.  He added chicken katsu to the top which made it perfect.  

I checked in on yelp and scored a free green tea ice cream but they barely gave me half a scoop.  Thanks a lot, ya cheapskates.  I ordered a mont blanc which came out frozen and was pretty gross....I can't recommend it.

As usual my timing sucks as I came in 10 minutes after the end of Happy Hour, where all the good starters and tapas are I believe 50% off between 5-7pm. The board with the specials was a bit out of my eyesight range.

Just one guy, the manager I believe, was working the dining area. There were about 4 tables in use out of maybe 10, and a counter space with more seating. So it was kind of quiet. He did a great job hustling taking orders, serving drinks...doing it all with a smile and great attitude and service. 

I had the beef tacos tapa, which is tenderloin bulgogi meat served with a mustard aioli, a lime aioli, and a pear date sauce. This was delicious, with a light shell that didn't cover up the flavors but enhanced them. 5/5

I also had the 30 hour berkshire pork belly. I really enjoyed the flavor of the sweet potato shavings playing off the pork belly and black raspberry sauce. 5/5

The service is so good at Moko that I lead off with props to the owner, Ryan, who greeted me by my name, engaged with us several times throughout our evening, and provided excellent service. He really understands that the front of the house is as important as the meal. He's one of those owners you want to see succeed in a tough business - he's just a really nice guy.!

Moko is cute as hell. Simple, clean - love the artwork. I'll definitely go back for dinner with friends or even to sit at the little bar alone and soak in the ambience.

My Dinner Downtown group enjoyed the 7 Course Tasting Menu. This group is more discriminating than your average group of diners - we seek out the best food and overall experience. 2 chefs and a restaurant owner were in our group; all 10 of us were pleased.

Several dishes really stood out for all of us. The shortrib was incredibly good, and the potato under it was one of my favorites. The pork belly was sinful - a fairly large serving that came alive when dipped in just a smidge of the raspberry salt. The creme brulee was one of the best I've ever tasted, and this is my favorite dessert; the caramel was like glass. Personally, I enjoyed the cold eggplant salad which melted in my mouth.

I read someone's comment that this would be packed every night if it were in a better location. This is true. But it's worth the 25-minute drive from my Henderson office, and I'm looking forward to my next visit. Everyone raves about the shrimp, so that's next up for me.",eJZZWZ1eMXyjXkz4X2stPw,2,3,5,J3cUNe8M4DZS8IP3LM-Tew

If you don't like mackerel I wouldn't suggest the kimchi pasta. For me it was good but not my favorite.",S6DHDPTlOh88-MtL3SEy1w,3,1,5,K5o-6xNE0541-sGlCY_Mcg
5876030,2015-08-19,1,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,"Catching up on my reviews and I had forgotten to go back to my roots. This Korean tapas-like restaurant is a bit off the best of path from my home route however worth the travel. Ryan the owner is always there which is a huge sign of dedication to the success of this restaurant. My favorite dish is the classic spin on jajangmyun (black bean sauce noodles). But it's hard to pick one favorite when they have dishes such as 30hr sous vide pork belly, and the braised short ribs served on top of a scallop potato stack. The surf and turf roll is a sea bass and bulgogi sushi roll that will bring land and sea harmoniously in each bite and will make your tastebuds go wild. As most people only think of bbq when they think of Korean this place will be sure to give a modern and tasteful spin on Korean flavors and new attributes to the culture.",h9Qu4M-uM2BbGRxUbxBX_A,3,2,5,frO02GKwtaJcJ-8eI_BYpw

This place is a joke spent 20 min sitting waiting for someone to bring me water and a menu. Then when one of the two people walk over and we have a question about the bento box he asks if we have a problem to which I say no but we have been waiting almost half an hour without any service. To this he just say oh, at this point my patience has ran out we left and went to jinya ramen which was amazing as always 

Do not visit this joke of a ramen bar",4xn7-8h0pEc9TsHDMGCjww,0,0,1,C2_V4z4zQcABe1EFnpRRvw

I arrived at 10:40 am, still closed, no problem. It's now 11:25. Still closed. No signage indicating why it's closed. Website not updated. No answer on the phone. So, why did I wait 45 minutes when I could have driven to Jinya? Regrets, but we all make mistakes in life. I will forever rue this day.",dvqgxx4hFcfraHvhddzOXA,3,2,1,qwTIUBIw7Lbzm5ToWhI1pw

We always order the tonkotsu ramen with takoyaki. Their chashu is sometimes too much for me so occasionally I'll do a build your own tonkotsu. Their takoyaki is the best that I've ever had. It is crispy on the outside with soft inside and a big chunk of octopus. Service is usually a little slow but I'm okay with it if I know I will be getting pretty good food for the wait.",iGtInQDTZ89mKnkhFWdlfA,1,1,4,edL0_3rYtdhZdQEsH1bGFQ

5939749,2016-08-27,0,D6K3VT6S8FwFm4u5uN8T8g,AMAZING!!! First time here and my girlfriend and I had the Cashu and Fire Ramen w/ added beef bulgogi. Very different dishes but equally delicious. The fire Ramen was a dry Ramen dish with just the right amount of spice. The added beef really made it pop. The Cashu was more traditional and served in a delicious broth. The service was great and Damien impressed with his knowledge and friendliness. We will certainly be going back for seconds!,BsIT70k-t_j_aHq6w45jfw,0,0,5,6XzQHu_ZfsSBwsNs_LsZ3Q

I could eat it every day for the rest of my life and be happy...LOL My wife and son had the ""make your own"" ramen (ramen noodles, chicken base, and chicken katsu), and it was equally delicious. The server was very knowledgeable and answered any questions we had (as well as made some helpful suggestions). We've been there twice and we'll definitely be going back often.

Very professional, always smiling and took care of us. He is so different from the other servers. My wife and I ordered Ramen and Moku bun! You can customize how you want your ramen, you can add toppings on your ramen for additional cost. Moku bun taste like siopao but in a different level! We would come back here again!",yJCNVrn161Cx9g6WdwOnew,0,0,5,kRfYxZ26FGisnWm3T10_UQ
