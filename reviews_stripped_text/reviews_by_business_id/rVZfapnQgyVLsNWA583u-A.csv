1871262,2016-01-15,6,rVZfapnQgyVLsNWA583u-A,"So I have been driving by this place for a while now and I decided to give them a try....

Well let's just say that I walked in and after 5 minutes I walked back out.

The place was totally empty.... And yes it was a little before 9pm... So maybe that's why it was so empty??

From other ppl's review it seems that they got pretty decent food and service here.... 

Maybe i should've come with them.  My service or lack there of is why the one star.... 

I walked in and I was greeted right away.... But when I walked up to place an order the girl behind counter walked up to me and blocked me from walking up to the counter.  I was like ok.... So I stopped about 5 feet from the counter and asked her one question...

Would it be possible to get a large soup with half egg drop and half hot and sour soup? 

She proceeded to make faces at me like I was crazy that I was making that request.... Then proceeded to tell me what a bad idea that was and told me that they would just add extra egg into the hot and sour soup.  What she didn't understand was that I like the sweetness from the egg drop soup and the spiciness and the sour from the hot and sour soup all mixed together. To me that is the best soup.  I have never had an issue getting this at any other Chinese restaurant.  But apparently at this restaurant it is a HUGE ISSUE.

Then she proceeded to tell me that it was going to be a long long wait since there was a large order ahead of me.  I guess the family order is a huge order when u only have 1 person working in the kitchen.  So since i was only ordering for one person.... I guess my order didn't count???

And she made it very very clear that she did not want my business. So I walked out. Why bother spending my hard earned money at a restaurant that doesn't want it?

So if u go and have good service.... Congrats.... Apparently I wasn't in the lucky bunch.

If you have great food... Congrats... Cuz I didn't get to taste anything at all...

So for me I will not be coming here again.... Even though they are the closest Chinese restaurant to me...

I went to Pho Annie instead... They gave me good service and good food... :) 

So good luck everyone.... And may the odds be ever in your favor.... Lol",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,8,1,1,HIuKHZMJzl2dK5vt29U7_A

Another customer, Oliver,  requested no salt and said this was one of the few kitchens that prepare foods and sauces fresh and are willing to do that. He designed his own version of Singapore noodle and shared it with us. 

I asked for a NY favorite, garlic wontons, a steamed wonton in a rich garlic sauce with sesame.  The chef made us an order and I'm thrilled to say he will add this to the private menu!  

Try Oliver's Singapore Noodle or Sandi's Garlic wontons.  Both are special customer requests which the chef was eager to make and has added to his menu.  What a novel idea!

4374012,2016-05-12,0,rVZfapnQgyVLsNWA583u-A,"LONG STORY SHORT: Go somewhere else. Grand Sign is not currently up to par with the competition nearby, seek your Chinese fix with Baidu Bistro across the street.

I really wanted to enjoy Grand Sign, however it just doesn't compete with local Chinese eateries near by. Mom was craving a hamburger, and of course, being the half-Asian I am, was craving some Chinese food. 

This location is right by the Cheeburger Cheeburger, near the Autozone off of Rainbow and Warm Springs. Pretty neat looking interior, you would definitely feel comfortable dining in if that were your choice.

I ordered Chicken with Broccoli and the Wor Wonton Soup. Gentleman cashier politely told me about 15-20 minutes, which seemed a little much given that there was only one couple in the restaurant with me. 15 minutes later, mom comes in discreetly hiding her outside food (lol), and sits with me to wait, to which the cashier yells ""5 more minutes"" out. Eventually, about another 10 minutes later my food finally comes up right after the couples order, which wasn't much either. Cashier thanked me for my patience and we went home. 

Went home and dug in. The Chicken with Broccoli was very average. It certainly looked fresh, tender chicken, crunchy vegetables, however it lacked any garlicy flavor and lacked the garlic sauce you expect with this dish. The Wor Wonton Soup was average as well, dumplings were soggy, chicken bland, shrimp decent. Not worth the $18 price tag.

I'm pretty sure there was only one cook working at that time because there is no excuse for a 25-30 minute ticket time for one dish and a soup. Food quality not up to par to compete with others nearby. Definitely a skip.",SJskhjbY1VPfL8ej0fYPdA,1,0,2,qdUURNMGRepF5BjwsDw5jA

Food: Very good value. With lunch prices between $5.95 - $7.95 you can't expect the best cut of meat or the brand name products. But the veggies are fresh and the main chef knows how to handle the wok well and the flavor is pretty good.

Environment: It is very clean but don't expect anything fancy. It's designed for you to get in, enjoy your meal and be on your way.

Service: The service is friendly and enthusiastic so I can't knock off points. But I seriously think the server didn't have a lot of prior experience serving tables.",Ei22-dnNo0xPXx472sQJGA,2,0,4,m-CQsH7digbUZPOKtAwQoA

They are always wonderfully nice 100% of the times I have come in, they are crazy quick service but the quality is way way better than you'd expect for that speed.

As if that isn't enough, their food is actually super inexpensive. They got lunch specials that feel like high way robbery! Comes with an abundance of entree options to choose from, egg rolls, and a soup for under $10. I DARE you to beat those prices! Haha. Just not happening.

4643827,2017-06-23,0,rVZfapnQgyVLsNWA583u-A,"Not bad, definitely a little better than the other nearby fast food take out Chinese options.  I got Mapo Tofu and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce, both of which are supposed to be spicy.  They are indeed mildly spicy, maybe a 3/10 on the legit spicy scale, which is great for me but if you want it really spicy you'll have to ask.  These are both lighter, healthier dishes, not breaded, not too oily, sweet, or heavy.  The flavor on both dishes was very good and I did not need to add soy sauce.  The Mapo Tofu is a bit lacking in veggies (there's just a tiny sprinkling of the from-frozen pea & carrots you get in fried rice normally, which I personally hate - but I think traditionally there are no veggies for this dish).

Portion for price is fair but not generous.  They do include a tiny bowl of rice, but if you like a lot of rice maybe fire up the rice cooker at home.",0DGh3LaLFDDES3OtOqGq1w,1,0,4,bfwhyJXj0h84oQt4uAvJ_Q

When my two young kids from ages 3-6  and I went there to pick up our foods and the owner saw us too. Once we got home and ate the foods. I felt some pain in my mouth and tasted blood. I spit out the food and I saw a piece of broken glass in the food. I stopped my kids from eating the food immediately, but they already ate a lot already. I called the owner and he admitted he broke a jar of sauce while cooking our foods and thought it didn't drop in our foods. Unbelievable, he saw my little kids were with me while picking up the foods, and he still take the chance and risk my kids' lives with that broken glass. Kids, they usually just eat whatever we give to them and won't question it. He didn't want to throw away those foods that might have broken glass on it and willingly to risk his customer's  life. I will never go back there again. Obviously, the owner doesn't care what his customer is eating, he just want money. I hope my kids and I didn't swallow any broken glasses unknownly. Very scary. 

And the owner was mad and rude to me like he was yelling at me when I asked him why would he still let me and my kids eat the food when you know there's some chances that the broken glass maybe on our foods because when glass broke, it fly everywhere, not just one place especially the jar of sauce was for my foods, so it was broken very closely to our foods.
