Aside from the fact that they come from my home State of Minnesota, the food was great and the service was excellent! If you want to experience Minnesota Nice, stop in a Breakfast Latte in the morning or a Sandwich for Lunch or Dinner.... By the way, they also serve Beer, Wine and/or Mamosa's for adults of course.

A couple of other observations: I noticed a small stage with a guitar and mic for live entertainment.... They also have shelves of books, crayons and coloring paper so I'm going to take a long shot and say that Kids are Welcome.

1976676,2016-10-25,11,emwtizy_UAmUjcNP88I0Tw,"Part venue, part breakfast spot, part community gathering place- Kaffe Live kind of has a lot going on. Their live music and open mic nights definitely make them stand out, but they still seem to be finding their footing in the kitchen.

I've come in for breakfast and the coffee is just okay- good pricing and a variety of flavored syrups for your latte, but some difficulty executing orders correctly. The Kaffe Bowl is a great breakfast option, adding mushrooms, avocado, and ham made it really filling, but it would have been better if they'd remembered the gravy and queso sauces I'd asked for on the side. 

Returned for a takeout order with a Groupon, placed a large order that was mostly correct. It appears their sliders have been removed from the menu so your lunch choices are various sandwiches. The tuna on ciabatta was tasty, with carrots and sunflower seeds, but the buffalo chicken wrap was unexpectedly heated- not so great when it includes lettuce, which turned slimy. The salmon bagel was tasty though, and something I'd get again. 

Service was really friendly on my first visit when I worked with the owner, who was happy to tell us all about his new business. Location needs to consider kicking up the food quality or expanding the menu, as they are very close to another stellar breakfast and lunch option.

4084199,2016-07-23,0,emwtizy_UAmUjcNP88I0Tw,"We found this place thru a Yelp deal. The place looked like it had just opened because it was c-l-e-a-n. The owner was super friendly and enthusiastic, and our order came out quickly. 

We had a bowl, a wrap, and a sandwich plus 3 of the healthy bottle drinks (which were really, really good). Some positives and negatives about the food though. 

The smoked salmon bowl was different but in a good way. I'd recommend this. The smoked salmon wrap was ok, but not as good as the bowl. The roast beef sandwich though was very underwhelming.

It was a very basic sandwich like something you'd make at home if you didn't have a lot of time. For home that's fine, but at a restaurant it's disappointing. Maybe because my parents owned a deli for over ten years and I used to work in the kitchen during the summers, I expect a lot from a sandwich. Their sandwich for me was a 1-star.

There were however a couple of budding pop stars there taking up the mic on the little stage. The day we went was kids stage day and they're was a family with a couple little kids who were belting out tune after tune which provided for some smiles and cheers. That was nice. I believe local amateurs also perform there on certain days and times. 

Overall, there was a vagueness to the theme and menu of this place and the food we ordered reflected that. I don't think the owner is a real, hardcore foodie or a I-sleep-with-my-chefs-knife kind of cook. The place seems like it was started out of an idea to combine live music with some simple food. 

I hope it gets grounded, comes up with some really good food, a solid focus and succeeds. I'd watch a bunch a Diners, Drive Ins & Dives episodes, pick out a selection of the best, most doable, test them out and try to create a short menu of homeruns. Nobody cares where you got the recipe and you don't have to tell anyone. It just needs to be good and cheap.

We stopped in for breakfast on our way to Red Rock Canyon, based on Yelp reviews for ""Breakfast"".  We ordered a couple of breakfast bowls.  We were the only ones in the place at about 11:30am on a Tuesday.  The guy working the counter (I think the owner) was very nice but preoccupied with whatever was going on in the kitchen.  The breakfast bowls took a really long time to come out (maybe he was training a new cook ??) and they were just ok, nothing special at all or much different than you can get at a fast food restaurant.
The atmosphere is wide open and not cozy at all, feels like tables inside of an industrial or strip mall space, not a restaurant.  It could be a whole different story as a live music venue.
Another thing I thought odd were their hours - not early enough to really be a ""breakfast"" place and not late enough to be an ""entertainment"" place.
With a few changes the place could turn into something more special, they just need to decide what that is going to be.",VAOIFFySx4iz3Z4_ZmgLug,1,0,3,mQQe3ZO8dgBstpoECuOeVg
