First off don't bother getting the Groupon, you can't use it in conjunction with any other special of any type despite the fact they don't have anything in writing stating that. 
Mainly though the food was terrible. Fish and chips with extra grease, chicken club sandwich with hardly any chicken, a $5 side of fries was a whopping 17 fries. Yes, there so few I counted them quite easily. 
The service wasn't any good either. It was us and one other table and it probably took 10-15 minutes to first take our order. She never even came back to ask how things were after serving our pathetic dishes. She tried to be nice after we told her it was really bad but didn't offer to do anything about it.

21432,2013-08-07,1,km5aBHRss5ir_B0jvEErzQ,"I went on a Friday night with a large group of coworkers after a long week. It was one of the most horrendous nightlife experiences in the two years I've lived in Vegas. The atmosphere isn't too bad but it isn't too great either. The only major difference I saw from the former Cadillac Ranch / Ranch House is that the mechanical bull was replaced by a small dance floor. 

As mentioned in previous reviews, the staff is obliterated early on in the evening which makes it challenging to get a drink in under 15 minutes (after you place your order). Prepare to repeat your order several times. The DJ stopped the music periodically to insist all bars be filled with girls (both bartenders and patrons) who would then dance on the bar while the bartenders poured free ""shots"" directly into patrons' mouths. The shots were in an unmarked bottle and were an odd purple color. Avoid the mystery bottle that just grazed the mouths of 30 other people.

Overall, I understand the idea of a party bar but this one missed the mark. The bartenders had more of a party than any of the patrons. Long story short, spend your money anywhere else nearby for better service from staff sober enough to remember your order.",Vr5pWeyOf3dQ-FgNU9o63Q,0,0,1,AtRDb_VzGxNZL3q_Lp6Mqw

72413,2013-08-22,0,km5aBHRss5ir_B0jvEErzQ,"Despite some not so glowing reviews of this place the happy hour special tempted me to try it out. On first glance the glace the place looks nice. The outside signage is very catchy and they inside is beautiful and open.

Hostess:

We were greeted by a couple of dazed looking hostesses that stared at their computer for an awkward 15 seconds before acknowledging us then kind of gave us a blank stare and eventually mumbled ""uh... two?"" Then took us to a table as though she were lost. 

Venue:

What I first took to be a pretty open restaurant/pub quickly seemed like a big empty place as she seated us far off from other patrons. The venue is very large. There are 2 bars inside - both of which were open which made little sense as it was not very busy. If we had been seated in a more populated area it would have made it easier for our waitress to keep an eye on us. 

The place is filled with TVs similar to a sports bar but despite being an Irish pub the TVs all showed baseball and American football instead of rugby or soccer. 

Wait Staff: 

The waitress was very friendly and cheery. She seemed inexperienced but everyone starts somewhere and I am fine with that. The waitresses always seemed to be buzzing around but never seemed to be taking anything to tables. The place was pretty empty and service was slow so I have no idea what the waitresses were doing with all their wandering about. 

The waitress uniforms would have been more at home at a Hooters. I am not opposed to attractive or sexy uniforms, the little plaid skirt was adorable but paired with a cropped/midriff top it was just too much. Some of the waitresses wore fishnets and tall boots with the skirt - it was tacky and over the top. I also was not a fan of our waitresses habit of leaning on our table, it was either a ploy to show some cleavage for a better tip or just another sign of an unprofessional waitress. 

There was also a guy in casual clothes lurking around with a clip board the whole time. I have no idea what he was up to but it was distracting.

Food:

So up to this point, the service is slow but not awful - the waitress was very friendly if unprofessional - the place has a big empty, not Irish pub but the kicker for me is the food. I would take all those things in stride if the food had been good. We ordered a couple beers, Irish nachos and teriyaki wings. 

The Irish nachos were okay. The portion size was huge. The whole thing was a bit bland and soggy though. If I were to order it again (which I probably won't) I would ask for the cheese on the side.  The teriyaki wings were kind of soft and soggy and the teriyaki sauce was bland and tasted more like soy sauce than anything.

TL;DR - 
The food was bland, the servers were friendly but slow, the hostess seemed brain dead. The whole place seems to be having an identity crisis; it looks like an Irish pub but feels like a sports bar with Hooters waitresses. For $28 we got 4 beers, chicken wings and Irish nachos. I really went in here wanting to like this place but we won't be going back.",Ewndw7ouqvqV10VBQo0MXw,2,1,1,VS8scH71SKviybT2O33z4Q

It wasn't too busy but we found a table and were told we had to be seated by a host while everyone else were seating themselves so we thought why not? We sat down and watch others around us seating themselves and getting service while we were getting the run around about a server will come and since we sat ourselves they had to wait for someone to free up to take our orders. It really didn't make sense to us as we sat around waiting while we saw other groups swarming tables to sit get served. Hate to play the race card but we saw tables that had white customer get help while my group of mix people didn't even get any help from any servers. Mcfaddens must not want money or thought we wouldn't tip cause we are minorities. If I could give a 0 I would.,-dxDfwn30JSChQmO1Bmpeg,1,0,1,wWRIyqfEAKqxPstoaWbOPg

125691,2013-09-07,4,km5aBHRss5ir_B0jvEErzQ,"Terrible terrible terrible TERRIBLE. We were SO excited to come here so decided to check out happy hour. First thing we walk in the door and there's two hostesses, one of which was wearing the half shirt and had a huge gut spilling out. Since I saw a bunch of girls in full length tanks I know that was not a REQUIRED uniform. I won't hold that against them and not part of my 1 star rating, but still not a good first impression. So they proceed to sit there and both stare at me while ONE is on the phone taking a reservation for five people. My one year old starts getting antsy and trying to jump out of my arms and they still don't seat us... Uhh hello anyone home? So then we get seated. We told them three adults, one child. They give us two adult menus. So the server comes. Extremely ditsy but nice. I tell her what happened with the menus, she says she will bring another. She comes back 4 more times to ask us if we're ready which were not because we're all huddled over and switching menus back and forth. So we start with the Irish nachos. Tater tots with bacon, sour cream and cheese. Uh yeah right.  A pile of tater tots, with a sprinkle of cheese sauce, a half a slice of bacon crumbled on top, and a tiny drizzle of sour cream. If it wasn't happy hour we would've sent them back. So we each order a beer. Myself a Guinness, the other two a bass and a blue moon. As soon as the bass is sat down he takes a sip and says try this is tastes almost like a miller light. I tasted. It tasted like half bass, half miller light. Weird. I tasted my Guinness. I couldn't take more than two sips, and we all concurred, tasted like Guinness water. The blue moon wasn't as watery, but also had a weird miller light taste to it. Again, happy hour, so we just dealt with it. 
The server kept coming to our table throughout and would blankly stare at us and say things like ""ohhhh myyy goooooooddddddd my necklace broke!!!"" It was so awkward. Almost like she was on drugs. No one in that place seemed to know like they knew what was going on at all. 
I will say my burger was pretty good, though my hubby's was RAW in the middle. He ordered medium well. You could touch te middle and feel that it wasn't cooked. We had such high hopes for this place but I can promise we will NEVER be back. Gross. This place won't last long in Town Square. No quality or customer service.

Came in during happy hour and prompty seated in the bar area.  From what I could see there was plenty of staff, from bartenders to servers.  The problem?  They were no where to be found.  Our server, and service, was beyond lacking.  Our drinks were never refilled, nor were we ever asked, by our server or ANY server/manager that walked passed our table for that matter. 

Our appetizers and food arrived together, and worst of all, it arrived 1) cold and 2) not cooked as requested.  We ordered the Irish Nachos and a hamburger.  There was wayyy to much cheese and because it was cold, it was very much unappealing.  I ordered my burger cooked medium well.  It arrived med rare. When I pointed this out to our server, and after she stated she would remove it from our bill, she proceeded to argue with me that what I received was medium well, when it clearly was not.  We walked in around 6, and left at 7:40, 5 minutes before our movie started.  We should not have been there for this long.  But again, our server was no where to be found.

Boy was I wrong... Place was empty (that should have been a sign to turn and run). But I sat at the bar and hoped it was just a off day. 

The service sucked , sucked , sucked .  The drinks and food was over priced for happy hour. Sure they are packed on ladies night but if a ""Irish"" bar has to resort to giving away the house to survive then it's not a Irish bar.  Hell the barmaid mixed up my drink twice and then told me she didn't normally work happy hour so she had no clue what was on offer and then seemed pissed off that she wasn't working a good shift. 

Trust me I know about Irish bars. I was born and raised in Ireland . I've lived in vegas since 97 so I've seen all the bars come and go, and unless the owners (not the management ) does something this pub is not going to last.  

I won't be back and neither will any of my friends.  

If you are going to town square , hit yard house or the English bar on the same level as this bar. 

Or if you want a decent Irish pub hit up RiRa at Mandalay bay and ask for junior or fitzy.  Locals get 40% off food on Fridays.

My bad experience started the minute I walked in. I was naturally attracted to the large bar in the center of the main room. I sat down and took in the place. Quickly it became apparent that the only thing that made this place Irish was the name on the building. The happy hour menu was filled with US or Sysco food items that had nothing to do with Ireland but who cares if it's good right! So after taking in the place for about 15 solid minutes I was approached by someone I could only assume worked there because he was behind the bar. This large, but not necessarily over weight man was sporting a ball cap, a ripped blue shirt, a pair of khaki shorts and black sneakers with no socks. I had to use this in depth description because he, like the other people behind the bar were not wearing name tags.
Anyway the large man quickly advised me that I was in the wrong seat because he was saving them for a few ""hot chicks"" that were coming in later. I looked around at the 8 other empty bar seats and paused to see if he was joking. But after hearing no laughter from him I tucked my tail under my legs and found a new seat. As I looked for another place to sit  I over heard the large man telling some regulars that  he had been up for three days. And that he was tired and needed a shot to wake up. But the odd thing was that even after a shot or 2 he was still tired. Weird! Once at my new seat I waited again to put in my drink order. 
A few minutes later my friend arrived and we decided to order from the happy hour menu. Which by the way is not bad! There are a ton of non Irish things to choose from and the price is right!  However, you have to hail down a bar tender if you want to order because they get distracted with one another and often get into deep conversations about God knows what. And once in these compelling discussions it takes a freight train with strobe lights to get their attention.
After ordering we discovered that the food was good and the beer was cold. We found it refreshing that the kitchen was on top of it and made this reviewer's score move from a 1 star to a solid 2 star. 
The night went at the same pace and after visiting the dirty bathrooms we made our way home. 
I hope the owners are looking at these reviews and acting on them. If that is the case below are a few things that might help your business succeed:

1. Hire a manager that can keep the staff focused on the guests. 
2. Provide uniforms and make sure they are consistently worn. 
3. Insist that every one who comes in contact with guests are wearing name tags. 
4. Find Irish food items to place on the menu. 
5. Give your staff a day off so they are not tired. 
6. Never let your staff drink on the job!

My friends and I went here for St. Patrick's Day because we didn't feel like dealing with the chaos of the crowd downtown, plus it's near our houses. My friends and I got a table ordered drinks and shots and I stepped outside to make a phone call with my friend because the music was really loud inside. When I opened the door to go back inside this big security guard pushed past a bunch of people swinging his arms around and yelling and cursing at me and my friend at the top of his lungs. Mind you my friend and I are petite women and this security guard tripled us in size. I seriously thought he was going to hit me as he accosted me and screamed incoherently. I was in shock and dumbfounded what was going on as he grabbed us and pushed us back outside. I asked him what he was doing and he said I had to leave and I replied why? I paid to come inside and I have a stamp and a table. He said he doesn't care and for me to get the fuck out. So I go to the front and asked the door guy why I wasn't allowed to go back in and he explained that once you leave you have to wait back in line. Mind you the line was backed all the way down the stairs and wrapped past Yard House. It would have taken like 45 minutes to get back in. I told him I just ordered a beer and it would be warm if I waited in line. He said sorry but there's nothing he can do. So I then saw another security guard letting 2 men cut in line and he opened the rope for them to get in. So I explained my situation and asked him if I could get in since I paid and I wasn't aware that I couldn't step outside the door for a minute. He said no. So I was outside calling my friends saying we needed to leave because they won't let us in. This guy I presume overheard us and said he would let us in but before he did he got right in our faces and scolded us like we were children saying we are not to leave this establishment again and if we do we will have to wait in line. This put a damper on the rest of my night. My heart was racing and felt uneasy. I have never been treated in such a manner at any establishment I've been to like this. The manager really needs to train his security guards to not be so aggressive. These guys acted like they were suffering from roid rage and wanted to punch anyone including women.

When we told her we were a party of 8, she had informed us that the restaurant is currently full and wait is about 30 minutes. I recall her saying there are areas closed due to the manager not wanting to turn on the air conditioning. 

Later a booth for 4 opened up. The same hostess had took another party to the table without asking us if we were willing to split up. No notification or anything. When she came back, we asked why another party got taken to the table. She said a table for 4 opened. One of my friends was PISSED. He was asking her why she didn't ask our party. She REPEATEDLY said ""you didn't tell me"". That almost made him go over and renovate the place himself. 

After waiting 30 - 45 minutes, 2 booths opened up and had the tables given to us. The guy waiter (manager maybe?) used a dirty smelly rag to wipe the table down and a drier rag to wipe it dry, leaving the table smelling horrible. 

Took about another 15 minutes for our waitress to come take our order. Food came out probably another 30-45 minutes later. Chicken tenders were small and dry. Onion rings looked horrible. The cheesy nachos had barely any toppings on top. Irish nachos was probably the most ""decent"" of the things we ordered, with crispy tater tots, topped with some white sauce and cheese. 

Later 2 friends had joined us, one ordering grilled cheese ciabatta wedges with tomato soup. The wedges looked like a microwaved ciabatta cheese sandwich cut in half. And the soup was microwaved (words of my friend who ate this dish). Wedges were not grilled whatsoever. 

As mentioned, when 2 friends joined us, we had asked for more water, one specifically without ice. Waitress brought a water bottle and 2 cups full of ice. When asked about the one without ice, she went to get a cup and set it at our table with what seemingly ""some anger"" and went off. 

To be honest, its not the waitresses fault. We can see they are severely understaffed on an announced event day which we couldn't understand why they would be... if staffed correctly.

Apparently bumping into a chair is enough for security to flash lights at you and get you escorted out. I was six drinks in over 4 hours. Assuming a normal metabolism, that would leave me at around maybe 3 drinks in my system at most. 

Security approached us, with his first words being ""Okay f****ers"". He was a taller African American guy. I personally felt a little insulted by being approached like that, especially considering I had a buzz at the most, if that. Security is very unprofessional at this establishment. So I got escorted out. I left him with some words as to what I thought about him and he seemed like he wanted to fight. Very unprofessional.

My friend ordered the chopped salad which said it came with ranch, yet when it arrived it had balsamic on it. She mentioned it to the waitress who replied ""no it doesn't come with ranch, it doesn't really come with a specific type of dressing."" Then my friend says ""well on the menu it says it comes with ranch."" The waitress grabs a menu to disprove this, only to realize that the menu does in fact say ranch. I know they've only been open 2 weeks, but the servers should know what the dishes come with...and if they're not sure, they definitely should NOT argue with the customer who just read the menu a few minutes ago. 

They also removed the pool tables, air hockey, and dart board that ranch house used to have. On the plus side they still have beer pong tables, new ones in fact...which is an upgrade. 

Overall pretty terrible food, mediocre service, reasonably priced drinks during happy hour. If this is your idea of a good time, then check this place out! Otherwise, go eat at Tommy Bahama cafe and order the steak salad/carnitas sandwich/bourbon ribs and coconut pineapple cake/key lime pie/barbados brownie instead and grab some drinks at yard house after.",jGKMAlMNbgonyeZBdqMpEg,1,0,1,Lg6MMu59Bj9GeDNs1wLmIA

I get there and there is no food you can order, just servers walking around with samples.  Why have food on your website if you can't actually order it yet!?!?  Mismanaged!  Seems that this place is just another typical Vegas party bar with music so loud you can't even hear yourself think.  The sound system was cranked up so high the speakers were distorting or the amps were.  If I want this kind of experience I'll go to Blue Martini where the music actually sounds decent.  Get the food out, and fix the system, or turn it down because it sounds like crap!

And they probably threw our food away anyways.

1578395,2014-08-08,0,km5aBHRss5ir_B0jvEErzQ,"On a recent trip to Las Vegas we were going to attend a special midnight showing at the AMC Town Square Theater.  After a long day at a local convention, we decided to head to the theater early and chose a place to eat that was near the venue.  Once we arrived the decision was made to eat at McFadden's Irish Pub, since several members of our group of 8 loved it when it was located at the Rio.  Since there is no better endorsement than from close friends, we decided to give it a try.
We arrived around 9:00 and sat at a high-top table near the bar and dance floor.  The eight of us crowded around the table, took our seats, and were greeted shortly by Tanya, our server.  She took our drink orders and brought them back shortly and took our food orders.  By 9:15 she had taken our dinner orders.  It is worth noting that this group of eight hadn't eaten since lunch.
20 minutes later we started wondering about our food.  No one ordered anything special or difficult.  It's a pub, so the food isn't terribly complicated.  There were a few burgers, nachos, and chicken wings.  Nothing fancy.
30 minutes later we continued to wonder about our food when we noticed that other tables around us who had food orders hadn't received their orders, either.  By this time it's 9:45 and not only are we very hungry, but we're starting to get unpleasant (this group of eight hasn't eaten since lunch).  Tanya came around and offered a round of drinks on the house (thank you!), but the fact that food still wasn't on the table is the actual issue at hand.  By this time several of us were getting low blood sugar and getting what my wife refers to as ""food headaches"".  Irritability starts to set in.
At 10:00 two things happened to make this dining experience worse.  1)  The lights were dimmed to the point that you could barely see what was in front of you and 2) the music was turned up.  WAY up.  Like, to 11.  At this point talking to the person next to you was an exercise in futility.
At about 10:10 food started coming out...for other tables.  While there seemed to be a moratorium on food for the better part of an hour, there were signs of sustenance ahead.  Meals were delivered, two or three plates at a time, to the table next to us and to a table that was seated after us, and one or two to our table, seemingly as a side note.  By the time the last meal was delivered to our table it was 10:25, meaning that the meals that were delivered previously had cooled down, but nothing was said because A) We didn't want to wait another hour for any problems to get fixed and B) We had a deadline we had to meet.
There were no problems with any of the meals (aside from the cooling down of those delivered 15 minutes before the last one was), and everything tasted fine, despite not being able to see what we were eating.  We ate hurriedly, being unable to really enjoy our meals because of the completely unacceptable service time.  No sooner did my wife eat her last bite when she had to walk out of the establishment due to the volume of the music.
We don't know what happened.  Did the cook just come in to work?  Did the kitchen staff take an abnormally long break?  Were they waiting on their supplier to deliver the food?   We were never given an explanation as to why the food was so delayed.
Would I recommend this eatery to anyone?  Based on this visit, ABSOLUTELY NOT.  While Tanya was pleasant and did what she could, the real problem was out of her hands and lies squarely with the kitchen and the (lack of) management.  
There are reasonable expectations that food delivery is going to be timely.  This Was Not The Case.
There are reasonable expectations that the atmosphere will be conducive to enjoying your meal.  Exceedingly loud music and very low light made that rather impossible.
As much as I'd like to give this establishment a great review, I simply can't.  Accurate orders and an attentive server don't make up for lousy service times and an atmosphere that's seemingly designed to keep diners away...or to drive them away to make room for the bar patrons.",RtHawrRQJlWpo47ZCEdztA,0,0,1,OjuPqAn7wgjgI2vD4LljmQ

Everything was room temperature. I am not sure how that happens, so just bleh. The first sign was when I ordered a black & tan, a drink that is suppose to be two toned, and have bass ale on the bottom, and the black Guinness on top. I saw the bar tender set down the traditional spoon, but the beer was as dark, and indistinguishable from my son's straight Guinness. Really?  It never even started to separate.

Anyways, here is a play by play of what occurred: showed my ID and got in line and was asked by the bouncer (who was wearing a beanie) to take my beanie off. I assumed it was just to check that there was nothing underneath it. I put it back on while in line and paid the $10 cover on a Friday night. I walked inside with my friends and soon after (about 10 minutes) I was approached by another bouncer who asked me to do the same, so I removed my beanie...I attempted to talk to the guy and ask why I couldn't wear it, since other people had hats on, but he walked away. I looked around me and after seeing multiple people wearing hats (my friend had a cap on) and a girl literally walked in front of me wearing a beanie, I decided to put it back on because it was a winter night and obviously there were other people wearing hats and beanies. Immediately after putting it back on, the ""beanie police"" approached me and I was asked to leave, with my friends joining me and no refund being given even though we were in the place for no less than 15 minutes. The only explanation they could give was that I didn't ""follow the rules"". I respect a business for having rules and I have no problem if an establishment is going to enforce a dress code, but if they're going to pick and choose who they apply it to then I would consider that discrimination. I don't see why an establishment with hardly any lighting inside would feel the need to enforce a ""no beanie"" dress code anyways...This place is lame, and I don't see any reason for going there while Yardhouse and Miller's are in the same area.",ch5MRX7dzKFmQyP_OvDJLw,0,0,1,Ner_g7_jVbSYRG97Qcea_g

2041555,2016-03-20,0,km5aBHRss5ir_B0jvEErzQ,"Short version: wish we had just stayed home. 

Long version: the second we walked in the hostess screamed (because the music was mind numbingly loud) ""It's ladies night, here"" and shoved a plastic cup with warm champagne in it. Should have listened to my gut but we stayed. 

We ordered quickly, hoping that if we got out of there quickly we'd avoid permanent damage to our ears. It's one thing to have loud music...I routinely crank my car stereo all the way up and scream along to Otep or Slipknot (I'm not a fuddy-duddy) but this is a bar and restaurant not a night club. The man and I barely spoke a word to each other the entire meal cause we couldn't scream loud enough to hear one another. 

The pickle fries were nothing special, the breading fell off almost every pickle so we were basically left with cooked pickles, but the dipping sauce was pretty good. He ordered the mac and cheese burger which is what bumped the score up to 2 stars from 1. 

When visiting an Irish pub there are two dishes that should always be standouts; shepherd's pie and fish and chips. I ordered the fish and chips which were supposed to be served with shoestring potatoes instead of chips, which is the reason I chose to order the fish. I got soggy undercooked frozen fries instead. The fish was not good. The batter was so greasy it turned soggy after a couple of minutes. The fish smelled fishy, which it shouldn't, but I peeled off the batter and sopped up the grease a bit and got through a few bites just for the pure fact that I was starving. 

The service was atrocious. It doesn't take much to keep me a happy girl when it comes to service but when you ignore our table and when we ask someone to let you know we need something and you come to the table with a pissed off look on your face you definitely make me cranky too. It's not really that hard to fake a smile. 

If you read most of my other reviews I'm more likely to write a glowing review than a bad one but sometimes experiences are so bad you can't ignore them. THE only reason this is a 2 star review is because my guy liked his burger.",BDoSVFfwpGqluwxpIkFtRQ,1,0,2,4fbjvjhZP8LBKRzipnsJKg

On another occasion I was there to watch a football game in the middle of the day and had to wait over an hour before someone even offered me a menu or glass of water let alone taking my order. The only reason I got a menu was that I almost had to physically restrain a duty manager to get her attention. As aside the ""manager"" did not really present a professional image for the establishment as she looked liked she had just rolled out of bed. I found out that one of the alumni groups who had chosen McFaddens as their home base during football season have abandoned the place after only 3 weeks because their members have been treated so poorly and complained so much. I was originally looking at this place to host a client event but there is no way that I would take that risk now.

First concern was the lack of business, maybe that's because it is more of a Saloon and less of a restaurant, and maybe it picks up later. 

The Menu has a lot of nice options that look promising. We shared the Fish and Chips, a plate of the Irish Nachos (Tots with cheese, bacon and sour cream) and our daughter had the kids mac and cheese. 

Overall we enjoyed the food. The Fish was fried well and had a nice breeding, the tots were good but everything was under seasoned, and we had to ask a couple times to get some salt as it isn't on the tables. 

Which brings us to the Service. It was dismal! Our waitress was present at the beginning but apparently was given a second table(?) and couldn't keep up as she was not present for the rest of the time there. We are still waiting for our Ranch. Not really but we gave up on it after the third request for it. Drinks were not kept full which brings us to another complaint: they charge you for each soda. What restaurant does that? I know that happens at the high end places but not any decent bar and grill in this town. 

I would give the food three stars but the service was barely worth one star. The idea of a Groupon is to get new clientele, but if you don't pay attention to your potential new clients you aren't going to get return business.

They did seem low on staff but each time, the restaurant was not slammed when I come here so I guess the other reviews were when it's busy here. Nachos could probably use more meat as they definitely do not stiff you on the chips. The quesadillas were  big and taste great, as well as the cheese sticks and buffalo wings. It does suck too how when I was here last time they ran out of flat bread for my friend who wanted to order that. Knowing Yardhouse was downstairs, I was hoping they had a great beer selection as they are a trendy looking sports bar but they did not have many beers so they did not seem to put up half a competition against to sway others from going to Yardhouse.

Beer is warm and flat out of a tap.  The bartender had to dump out a bucket full of bubbles because she was too busy being incredibly rude and disrespectful to even give a half assed attempt at pouring a beer.

Speaking of the bartender... I had to get her name off of the receipt because she could barely be bothered to see if we wanted a drink.  When she did check on us she was rude and acted as if we were inconveniencing her.  Pardon me for hoping that you will do your job.  I had to look at the receipt to get her name.

I ordered a Sam Adams and my boyfriend ordered a PBR.  They both were flat, warm, and disappointing.

I heard about the poutine.  Or at least I thought I had.  The gravy was scorching hot but flavorless.  It was almost a grey paste.  The fries would have been better without the gravy.  The melted cheese was flavorless too.  I had to put so much salt onto the poutine that I am surprised I didn't walk out with ankles like Wilford Brimley.  I had to put half a grinder of pepper on it as well.  My boyfriend thinks the gravy was from a jar.

We paid for our stuff and left for the Yard House.  I'd rather pay more for quality and good people.

Well we ended up sitting at our table for a good half hour before any of us got to order drinks (now that's just the time for the drink order).  Only two of our party got menus so most of us had to share and read off of each others.  Finally after waiting forever for our drink orders to be taken I just went to the bar to order a drink rather than sit there for another god knows how long. At the bar the bartender was in a crappy mood and even looked as though she had tears coming down her face and just did not look thrilled to take my order at all. Finally after getting my drink at the bar I returned to my seat and waited for my order to be taken. After a good half hour our food orders were finally taken by an absolute jerk of a waiter. He walked up to our table and when he found out we were all paying separately he very animatedly pounded his hand on the table, mumbled a curse word under his breath, and then began to write our orders down vigorously making it known that he was displeased with our wanting to pay with separate checks.   

The only reason this place does not get 1 star is because the food was actually quite prompt in arriving. After ordering we all received our meals within 10-15 minutes and the food was quite good and very well prepared. Out of everything that night the food was actually quite tasty and worth the wait however the service is what prevents me from ever coming back.  The service at this restaurant was horrible and it was just an unpleasant serving experience.  We did come during an event day so the noise level was through the roof. In fact there were multiple people screaming at absolutely nothing and it was just not peaceful at all. It sounded more like a club at times than a restaurant.  After we finished our food and asked for our checks, every single person was overcharged for their meal except one in our party. I was charged for a Guinness that I did not order and so was everybody else in my party. Everyone was charged for some sort of drink or item.  When we complained it took them forever to rectify our checks and bring the correct balance to us.  While the food was good, again the service was terrible.

The exact line my waitress said to me when I asked what was on tap. 

My friend and I had gone to McFadden's as Yard House was swamped, and we were looking for something similar.  The inside is a dive. There's no authentic Irish pub feel here.  

We were unfortunately seated in the bar area which was insanely loud. There was Guinness on tap, but the rest was domestic. If it's an ""Irish pub,"" I would expect to see a few more things on tap from Ireland...just saying. I ended up ordering a Sam Adams seasonal.

We ordered two orders of the poutine on the happy hour menu. About 20 minutes, the food arrived. It wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't the worse. I would describe it as a cross between McDonalds fries with some cheese on top of them. Branding as an Irish pub should generally come with good pub-style food. 

Overall, I would never go back to McFadden's. I would keep walking and go get a sub at Caprottis.",e1WA0YE3JpTg2Zb_lrHKQA,4,1,1,3U6S1_xInZsvFrclyDJY4Q

We were there on a Friday at 6pm, the place was maybe 1/4 full and there was plenty of wait-staff visible just standing around. There was no one near the door and we waited for a few minutes while staff stared at us from the bar area before a hostess made her appearance. It was hot outside (109°+), so we asked for water as soon as we were seated. 10 minutes passed and a waitress finally showed up to our booth and said she would be right back because she forgot everything for the table (menus, silverware, etc.), so we reiterated the request for water before she left. Ten more minutes go by and she finally showed back up with menus, but no silverware or water. I order a Guinness, the water for a third time, and my entrée all in one go. 15 minutes later my Guinness comes, and it was practically HALF FOAM (touted as an ""Irish"" bar and you can't get a decent pour at $8 a pint, pure sacrilege)! Ooh, and still no water! 

Another 15 minutes before our food comes without the water that we've now requested three times. We request water again for the 4th time.

We finished our meals and waited over 5 minutes before finding someone to bring us our check so we could get the hell out of there as quickly as possible.

McFadden's definitely caught me at my weakest point. After a long day of meetings, running around Vegas to finish some errands, and a quick ticket drop. I was stuck at Town Square and wanted to eat and maybe catch some of the World Series. 

I stopped in to McFadden's because I wanted to try something new, and didn't want to spend a ton of money at Yardhouse, which is located directly below McFadden's. Walking up the stairs to the restaurant and seeing the place completely empty with a bustling and loud Town Square below should have been the one and only red flag I needed to leave this joint, but being the optimist I usually try to be in these situations, I passed the only twow patrons to this place and sat down. 

First thing to hit me was the smell. It was like the bar had thrown up, slammed a beer, and puked again. Great way to kick my hunger into high gear. Here's the kicker, it only came in waves. Slow moving waves of funk. Red flag number two. 

I ordered a drink and some food and took-in the place as I pretended to watch the baseball game. I noticed that this place is huge; three different bar areas, a very large empty dining room area, and a back & front patio for outside dining or smoking, I'm not 100% sure, but there may be been a drunk patron sleeping it off on the front balcony. When I asked if this place gets busy on the weekend, the bartender said its packed Thursday through Sunday, I find that hard to believe. 

My food finally arrived and I was both shocked and disappointed that for $9 I was only getting three chicken tenders, I had to order fries separately for around $6. The fries were good , but it takes a true talent to mess up fries. The chicken tenders were kinda of burnt and one of them was still raw inside! Yikes, thank goodness I decided to look before I chomped into it.

I showed it to the bartender and he quickly took it away and brought me another single chicken finger. Yes. He brought me a single chicken finger. I thought this that was pretty weird and as I cut into this foul finger I could tell it had been totally ablitorated in the fryer and I left it on the plate. 

The bartender here wa s nice, but seemed clueless at times. I would definitely avoid this place even if the line at the Yard House is ridiculously long. Unfortunately, my phone recently died and I lost all of my photos. Therefore, no raw chicken pics, but maybe that's a good thing?",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,17,10,2,qnmtOwPpjZyovMJvAVaovQ

My Guinness was served in a stange (a slender cylinder for the non-beer drinking crowd). The glass was labelled ""Fosters"". I have never in my life seen Guinness served in a stange, and it was a bad look for an Irish bar.

1st round of drinks takes about 15 mintues and some of the drinks were not make correctly but we keep them because it took so long.  We ordered a bunch of the happy hour appetizers, then decided we wanted some burgers but could not figure out who our actual waitress was and nobody was willing to take our order.  

Apps come and they're typical bar fried food, but then we realize we have no plates or silverware.  We flag down a bus boy who then brings us 4 sets for 5 people.  ???  Get another set, then finally figure out who is waiting on us and order burgers.  

2nd round of drinks takes over 25 minutes to be delivered.  Burgers actually come out in about 10-15 minutes.  Bus boys continue to deliver food to our table that we didn't order.  At one point on the 3rd extra delivery he just looks at us and says.. just keep it.  I can see the table next to us giving our server an earfull.

3rd round of drinks came out faster.  Burgers were actually pretty good.  Good luck getting refills on your waters or iced tea.  Before our waitress has a meltdown we ask for the check.  We were pretty nice, not d1cks like the table behind us.  When our waitress came back she said she gave us a 50% discount because everything was so messed up.

Good conversation and great service. Tonight I came in with a friend that has never been here before and I always talk it up because there is a wide selection of bars and I choose to come here. We came in and sat down and khara was behind the bar. Right away we could tell she either has had a bad day or hates her job. She didn't say hi just what we were and drinking and to see our ID's. pulled them out I asked her how her day was because we all have those kind of days I  bartend on the side at neche here at town square so I know how it is...
She immediately had an attitude and when I told her that we worked in town square so she knows to give us a disc..and she gave me the dirtiest look like we were cheap or something and asked for proof that we work here. My friend showed her hers.. and she said ok not even thank you. I showed her an email from my bar and she told me it wasn't enough because it didn't say the name.

I said that's ok I come in all the time but I've never met you and she walked away saying I've never seen you here and I am the manager here. And I told her she had an attitude because by this time Her response was so rude and she was obviously angry flipping her hair around about to start snapping her fingers lol
 I couldn't help but actually ask her why she was so angry and had an attitude. She then said what?! It's because I won't give you your discount...everyone looks at me. So embarrassing...
lol I didn't need it I just didn't get how the bar could turn into such a good vibe to I will NEVER be back. I want to note that it wasn't about the disc it was about how she handled it and how she talks to paying customers. Her response to me asking her why she had an attitude, verbatim;
Ok really?! That's awesome! Really it is! Cool! And turns around 
She doesn't care about her restaurant I guess and it was left a bad taste in my mouth.

Nothing seems to be able to stay open at this spot above Yard House in Town Square. McFadden's itself is pretty huge but instead of marketing itself as a restaurant/bar it feels like they try to be a club instead. On most weekend nights you can see a long line of people forming outside the entrance. I think most of them couldn't get into at Blue Martini or didn't wanna pay cover at Stoney's and figured Mcfaddens was the next best thing.

Inside you can try and get food off their menu if you find someone to serve you. The drinks are overpriced for the venue and for what you get. Beers come in around $8 and cocktails are a few bucks more. You can get a wider selection of brews downstairs at Yardhouse and better drinks at Blue Martini.

During my last visit I was thinking about ordering a drink from the bar but was too afraid of having it kicked into my face by the random women that are allowed to dance on the counter. Apparently the people playing beer pong don't mind scooping a filthy ping pong ball off the dance floor. Im sure the water cup sanitizes it just fine.

We got in line, and the security guard tells my boyfriend that since he was wearing joggers, he couldn't go in. Online it says ""no sweat pants, or gym attire."" Last time we checked, olive green canvas material joggers were neither of those things. My boyfriend might I add is a type 1 diabetic, who wears an insulin pump on one side of his butt, and a sensor on the other side to monitor his sugar. This makes it very hard for him to wear skinny jeans or pants, since it is taped onto his skin to stay in, and is about 2 inches thick. He explained this to the guard that he couldn't wear anything fitted because he has a medical reason. His words were, ""I don't care if you've come in before on the weekend dressed the same way, you're not going in."" So he argued that he did not care at all if he had a medical reason, and that it was just too bad. My boyfriend asked for the man's name, and the other security guard charged at him yelling in his face that they don't care what kind of medical reason he has, that he needed to go else where. He then asked for my boyfriend to show him PAPER WORK of having diabetes, even though he was holding his insulin pump in his hand. After him being screamed at by the fat, bald guard we had to leave. It's also humorous that they have a dress code, yet other people were wearing sandals, and plain white tee shirts that are clearly NOT permitted according to their online dress code, but green joggers that weren't even sweat pant material are not allowed. None of our friends will ever return, and we for sure will not either! The guards are complete jerks, and should be ashamed of themselves. But hey, I'm sure they feel super cool being guards at some crappy bar in Town Square.

LIKES 
- Huge place with a lot of places to sit
- Pitcher of beer is reasonably priced
- Free shots randomly through the night (Friday and Saturday I assume)
- Lights on the dance floor aren't terrible at all
- Lively crowd 
-They have beer pong...

DISLIKES
- Dj was playing top 20 type songs, if you like that then its another like for you but I wasn't into it at all
- Place seemed dirty with random chicken wings or chicken bones on the ground
- OVERPRICED, my biggest thing from this place was that the food was overpriced. It made me not wanna come back at all. I ordered Cajun Fries and what I got was a very depressed load of barely sprinkled on Cajun with some fries on the side. It wasn't worth the $5.00 I paid for it. Their $10 nachos sounded great but I kept on comparing it to mcmullens and it doesn't compare AT ALL. This place fails in comparison.
- Service wasn't good at all. Kept no eye contact and kept the answers short with no substance

Safe to save I will probably won't go back solely because I don't want to pay for the ridiculous food prices. If they were reasonable, there might be a chance of me returning but with the not so polite service and not my type of music, you wont be seeing me anytime soon.

Excellent happy hour from 4pm to 7pm (lots to choose from)
Highly recommend the nachos (easily could feed 3-5 people) There was two of us and we could barely put a dent in them. The chips are smothered in this really good creamy white cheese. I really enjoyed it. *See my photo

There are three bars to choose from (2 inside and 1 on the patio), a small dance floor and ample seating throughout the restaurant. They have a lot of Pinnacle vodkas to choose from, it's not really my thing, but they seemed to be a hit with other people 

Bar staff seems hit or miss, lucky for us, the girls serving us were awesome.  But I could see some of the other girls behind the bar had a bit of attitude. 

They show the UFC fights, so we wanted to see how they handle it. At first the sound wasn't great (slightly off and distorted) for the prelims, but luckily they fixed it by the main card.

Aside from your average, run-of-the-mill adult libation offered, this place has pretty decent ambiance as well. What really stuns is the patio. It's amazing!! The night we were there, a cool, night breeze was blowing, and it felt super good while we lounged on the comfortable outdoor couch. 

This spacious bar offers beer pong, pool tables and a dance floor, complete with a DJ no less. Don't know if the DJ is only on certain nights, but the mix of music was fairly decent. Kat and I did a couple dance moves while on our bar stools, so I would say it was alright LOL

The bartenders are pleasent and have average attentiveness levels. What really sold me was the Ladies Night they have every Wednesday. Apparently, this is a new thing they are trying. FREE well drinks and bottled domestics after 9pm. I will say it agian.... FRRREEEEEEE. Holy. Moly. That is either really, really great or really, really scary and dangerous for all you girls out there who like to get white girl wasted on weekdays. Be careful!!

Not exactly a busy time of day. There were approximately 4 tables sat in the entire bar. We were the fifth and they sat us behind a pole in the back of the restaurant. Apparently, it was 100 miles too far for the waitress because she took FOREVER to give us service. My husband ordered a Corona Light and I water. It took about 15-20 minutes for his beer to arrive and it was warm!  Then we ordered nachos with guacamole and beans, chicken wings and mozzarella sticks. Guess how long it took to get our food.....40 minutes!!! We were informed that no one realized there wasn't a cook in the kitchen. That's awesome management. Well, once they got that figured out, I think they put half a cook in the kitchen because our nachos had no beans or guacamole and the mozzarella sticks had leaked the cheese out the bottom. So, all we had was hollowed out bread crumb casings with a giant ball of cheese on the bottom. The food wasn't even good. It was a waste of calories. My husband dared to order another beer which took another 20 minutes. It came after the food was gone and it was also warm. It was happy hour but, who cares when you only get 2 drinks every seven days. The service was SO slow! She was nice but, slower than molasses! There were like10 employees roaming around and only 5 tables and it took us 1 1/2 hours to wait for food, drinks and service. At that pace, we could have enjoyed a nice fine dining meal. We can easily spend 1 1/2 hours in a bar but, that's when beverages aren't strapped to a turtle's back.

The food is your typical bar food so there's nothing amazing about it, but it's still decent eats. However, the Fried Mozarella Sticks with their spicy marinara sauce is delicious.

3590964,2017-03-05,0,km5aBHRss5ir_B0jvEErzQ,"My friends & I were all excited to check this place out & I'm sad to say it was disappointing. 
My friend & I reserved a table for 9 because we were having a joint birthday party. When three of us arrived exactly on schedule & told them we had made a reservation the hostess seemed clueless about it. When we said the name we booked it under she had a light bulb moment. She seemed super surprised that we had shown up at all. We waited a few minutes for our table to be ready because well.. it wasn't ready for us. 

The place is pretty big & it wasn't busy at all considering it was a Saturday night (last night). We finally got our table in the corner next to the DJ who was playing a weird mix of 90's hip hop & some other stuff not remotely Irish pub like. I heard 2 Flogging Molly songs the entire night & then songs like Jenny from the Block by JLo afterwards... so bizarre!

Our table in the corner had zero lighting. Considering we had made a reservation it was really crappy of this place to give us the reject table for a birthday party. We all had to take out our phones as a flashlight to read the menu which was annoying. 

Our waiter was a hot mess. We told him we were going to need some time since we were still waiting on our friends & he kept showing up every other minute. When our friends showed up they needed a minute to look at the menu. While chatting we realized it had been about 20 minutes since our friends had arrived & no one had come over to take a drink or food order for them. We had to go over to the bar to ask the bartender to send us someone since we couldn't flag a single waiter down to help us.

 Next we asked him to take a group photo of us. He told us to wait because his boss was watching him since we complained about him & he had to clean up our table & another table he was waiting on. I've never heard of a boss who gets mad at waiters for taking a photo for a customer but what really bothered me about that is that it is also unprofessional to make a comment like that when you haven't been doing your job & haven't even apologized to us for being MIA. While cleaning the table he held out his hands for us to pass the finished cups & plates to him. Then he left to ""clean up"" the other table & never came back to take our photo. We had to keep asking & asking before we finally got him to take our dang photo. 

When we were ready to head to our next location we asked for our checks & he put them all on one. When we asked for separate checks he messed them all up & my friends had to give each other cash because we were trying to get to Blue Martini by 10 & didn't have time for him to sort it out so we all sorted it out on our own. 

Drinks & food were fine. Irish pub with limited Irish brews though. They had Guinness on tap & one other Irish beer by bottle. Pizza was good, cheap because of Happy Hour but with the awful service I'm not making my way back any time soon. Honestly if the service had been better & if we had been put somewhere with lighting we probably would have had another girls night here. 

We were all in good company & celebrating a birthday party so we had a good time but McFadden's really did little to contribute to that.",rx6TW2QmrfImGX0dvLyPQg,1,0,2,a6BjaCajb9XlGgdhPATAcA

We made a reservation for a friend's birthday dinner (so it wasn't like they weren't expecting us to show up). We waited at least ten minutes to be acknowledged after seating ourselves because no one was at the door to greet us.  When the waiter who had passed us multiple times without acknowledging our party of 14 finally came over, we were told we had to order food soon or the kitchen would close and that if we wanted drinks we would have to go to the bar. He gave us one menu per table of 7 and when we asked for more menus he brought ONE more. Not one for each of us, but one total. There was a distinct vibe of us being an inconvenience to the server. We were split into two tables and both tables ordered food. We went to the bar for drinks and waited a fair amount of time for the bartender to finish taking to his friends at the other end while flashing us looks periodically from behind a liquor shelf. We ordered beer to keep it simple and when I got my bill and credit card back he basically just flung it on the bar and moved on to the next customer. This is when the ridiculously loud DJ music started playing for our party and the 4 other people in the place. We couldn't even hear each other speak or hear what the waiter was telling us. When the food came out, it was only for one of the two tables and the waiter explained that the other table's order never got put in, so they were basically just SOL. When the bills came he kept trying to give one to my GF who hadn't ordered anything and kept coming by every few minutes to ask if they were ready to be settled. The only other people in the place seemed to be employees or friends of the employees who were only getting slightly better service than us. It seemed like the place was being run by a bunch of kids with no experience that thought ""hey it'd be fun to work at a bar and just chill and have a super loud DJ playing for one party and 6 bar guests."" The group consensus is that none of us are going to bother with the place again. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague.",EfvFZPchWogxg_5R8NfNdw,0,0,1,l7Eh4_FQDVRHgq8VM9N2Ww

* Happy Hour is til 7pm

* Happy Hour menu is pretty tasty & ample amount of selection. My friend & I ordered:
Pickle Fries $4
Roasted Garlic Artichoke & Spinach Cream Cheese Dip $6
Spicy BBQ Wings $6
McFadden's Famous Irish Nachos $9

* Outside seating is pretty chill & nice

* Prices are reasonable


[ Cons ] 

* Happy Hour portions are smaller than regular serving

* Our server checked up on us every 5mins (I'm not exaggerating), and she'd even comment apologizing for checking up on us so frequently. Although this may be better than if your server never came back to check-in, sometimes too frequently can be a con

* They charge for extra sauce & I wasn't told that til I saw the bill. It doesn't cost much, but it would be nice to get a heads up on charges that aren't mentioned on the menu.

* The table outside that we sat at was quite dingy & not properly cleaned

This was my first time at the new location. It's very spacious and the three times bigger than the old one, which is awesome.  They have a bigger bar and more tables.  The tables though were only for those who reserved one though, which kinda sucked.  With as many as they had (and empty too) it would have been nice if they had allowed us to use one. There was about 5 of us and we tried, but they said we had to wait until a certain time to see if anyone showed up for them, so we just stuck to the bar. They didn't have enough bartenders and it was hard getting a drink, but once we it was good. We also tried some of their food, which was cooked well and tasted great. 

By the time we got ready for our second round of drinks we noticed there was an increase in prices for the exact same drinks we previously ordered. When we asked the bartender why she couldn't really tell us. After a few minutes of one of my friends going back and forth over this the bartender gave her a discount. By that time I decided I didn't want another drink. I was a little put off by it and their attitudes weren't very friendly either. The bartenders at the old location were friendly and down to earth. The ones from last night seemed a bit stuck up and unapologetic. We never had an issue like this before, at any bar. 

I can't say that I won't be back, but I really hope that our next visit is a lot better. The McFadden's atmosphere is usually epic. Last night was good, minus that one hiccup, and the music/dj was great as well.",49K6GNShDqaodhkYR8E0gQ,2,0,3,YGXW23QetvGvJO8mQVC4tg

Walk in the door and seated ourselves (as the sign suggested).  Sat in the booth and waited about 4-5 minutes without being greeted.  Then another guy and his son sat in the booth behind us.  Another few minutes goes by and the guy in the booth behind us gets drinks and orders before we have anyone come over.

While we were waiting we noticed a good coating of dust along the booth wall railings, so my wife wrote her name in it.. ugh..

We were about to leave, when the waitress finally arrived.  You could tell she doesn't like her job.  Ordered fish and chips for myself and the wife had a Ruben.  The place was pretty much empty except for the bar, so the food came out reasonably fast.

My fish and chips, which cost $15 were three smaller pieces of cod in a basket.  When I pulled one out, it flopped over like a limp noodle.  The outside was coated in grease and the breading was slimy instead of crispy.  They looked burned (either that or the oil is really dirty).  I couldn't believe any self respecting chef or food cook would send that out of the kitchen to be eaten.

I sent it back (the first time this year I've had to send food back).  I felt terrible about wasting good fish, but it wasn't edible.  I ate half of the wife's' Ruben (which was way more kraut/sauce/bread than beef).

He was just chatting up this woman who appeared to be having a rough day. From what I could overhear (not like it was that hard), she had been divorced multiple times and has kids.

We came back after the show, the man with the blue jacket still not doing anything until nearly midnight. At that time, he forced everyone out saying they were closing. He wasn't courteous about it. He didn't announce last call. He just kind of forced everyone to up and leave.

So the fries, well, let's see. They were fine. Nothing to write home about, but what made us laugh is they were presented with a plastic cup of watered down ranch dressing. So they get a jug of ranch dressing and in order to stretch their food dollar to the limit, they half it and add water. The stuff literally dripped off the fry. I couldn't coat a dry cat with this stuff. Fifty dollars later, we were pissed we had not looked at the reviews on yelp. Had we taken the 5 minutes we most  assuredly would never has wasted a meal here. Run.. don't go in! oh and By The Way..THIS IS NOT AN IRISH PUB.",ZUZTuX4mghdPZdxmZEw0Zw,1,0,1,MX8cWTlR7pql-YDmPGU0sQ

Very ""Irish"" decor, Guinness on tap & the waitress was wearing a kilt...

Walking in we noticed the music was techno / hiphop-ish. ????

We sat at the bar, ordered a Guinness.
The waitress was great, and she poured a great pint, the right way.

Looking at the menu... Nothing food wise that was Irish, maybe the stew, but the waitress wouldn't even recommend it.

I had the Blue Burger...  $13 no fries.
The fries were another $4.

It was good, not $13 great though.
The $4 came on a saucer...about a small size at McD's.

Decided to check it out on a Friday night because my friend won open bar for herself & half off drinks for her friends. The drinks... Blechhh. The bartenders must have heavy hands, the drinks were way too strong to consume. I asked for a Vodka Lemonade and had to toss it in the trash midway. 

There's plenty of space- a patio in the back, loads of booths and tables, dance floor, an area for BP, and 3 bars scattered around. Despite all the space, this place was still packed! It's hard to get around.  And ladies, don't think you can rush to the bathroom when you had too much to drank. There's always a line of ~5 girls, so plan your bathroom trips accordingly. 

One thing I did love was the music selection! They played everything, old and new. Weird that they place that Blue da ba di da ba die song, but it was pretty cool when they played The Outfield's ""Your Love"" and everyone busted out singing, ""and I don't wanna lose your love toniiiiight.""

I went there for a company happy hour.  There about 25 people in our party, arriving in waves.  the first 6 or so people got their drinks, the rest of us it took about 40 minutes to get a drink.  When we complained, they said there was only one bartender.  Guess it takes 40 minutes to pour 2 pitchers of beer and 3 mix drinks.  

the place was not that busy, so there really was no excuse.

Since the service was so bad, I decided to try the food TO GO, since the menu looked promising.  

We ordered 2 of the $5 burgers with various toppings.  the waitress asked me 3 times about what kind of mayo we wanted and confirmed twice on the plain mayo.  the burgers came with NO MAYO.  they had 2 patties which I wasn't expecting, don't know if thats normal, but its too much.  the worst part.....my medium temp patty was RAW,  not just rare,  raw and cold in the middle.  When I got home I had to remove it from the bun and cook it in the microwave.   Once it was cooked it tasted good, but I shouldn't have to cook my burger at home.

I ordered a chopped salad and got a chicken cobb salad at home.

on the side of the burger was a fried pickle.  First bite was good,  second bite was like biting into a teaspoon of SALT.  I had to spit it out. 

I ordered side of mac n' cheese.  for $6 bucks I was expecting something that did not look like kraft mac n' cheese.  but the kicker was it NOT COOKED.  It was like the chewy pasta that sticks in your teeth.   Again, I added a little water to it and put in the microwave to finish cooking.   At first I thought it was edible now.  then I realized it tasted like they had half cooked the pasta then soaked it in a box of salt then poured some cheese sauce on it.  NOT EDIBLE again. 

the good news is with the happy hour prices, 2 burgers, fries, mac n cheese and a salad was only $17.  If the food had been edible I could see us eating here every other week.

FIRE the COOK who has stock in mortons salt company and is drowning fresh food in pounds of salt and failing to cook things properly.   Seriously,  get the right cook and decent service and we might be back.  Otherwise never again.  
It almost felt like the cook was trying to purposely ambush the restaurant.

The menu had a vast variety of options but after reading some other reviews I decided to go with the Irish potatoes aka tater tots and chicken tenders with sweet chili Hawaiian sauce. The Irish potatoes were meh to me. I really didn't think they were anything special but the chicken tenders were surprising good. You definitely can't beat the prices either, super cheap for HH.

Stood in at the front for 10 minutes cause of the ""dinner rush"". The restaurant barely had 7 full tables. Waitress walked pass us three times until finally saying ""I'll be right with you"".  5 minutes later a highly intoxicated lady introduced herself ""Sam"" and ask for our drink order. Drinks came out with no time issues, just the cups had wrappers still in 3 out of 4 in them. She apologized quickly, but took her time to replace them (about another 5 minutes). During that time she walked pass again with drink orders of another table. 
Alright, now it's time to order all our food as we had PLENTY of time to look over the menu multiple times. She doesn't write anything down and amazingly forgets our appetizers and blames another waitress for taking them. During our barely mediocre meal, the table behind us is getting cleaned by a pair of highly trained McFadden staff, and they so how manage to throw water in the air spilling over onto my family. These ladies found it hilarious by their laughter until I told them to apologize for spilling on my mother-in-law. They made a half-assed apology and went about their day. So our meals over and now Sam tells us that she apologizes for forgetting our appetizers. Wait, didn't another waitress take them?!? So the bill finally made it over and she apologized again for such a ""busy night"".  That place wasn't even close to busy by any stretch of the word.

I was invited here by friends for Halloween and although I'd seen the place many times while shopping at Town Square, I really had no expectations upon entering...

Boy, was I blown away. 3 full bars, ample seating, and a deck area that wrapped around 3/4 of the building, it was awesome! Since it was a Halloween party, everyone was dressed in their 'costumes' and I use that loosely because most of the girls were half naked and most of the guys were either ninja turtles or cavemen. There was a guy dressed as a penguin and dancing with him was the highlight of my night, but I digress...

Upon entering I was given a ticket for my first drink free. Now, if you've been in Vegas for a while, most clubs say 'your first vodka drink is free', this place was not specific so I ordered an Alabama Slammer and the bartender knew exactly how to make it. Also ordered 3 Heineken's ($21), 2 patron shots ($20),  got free shots because I danced on the bar, and played beer pong (no idea how much it costs, I was beyond hammered).

Also ordered some hot wings which smelled amazing and tasted even better.

The one thing I didn't really like was how small the dance floor was. There had to be at least 300 people in the building and the dance floor was like 4X4 lol. But its a pub, not a nightclub, so I'll let that tiny thang slide.

The new location at Town Square is certainly set up to entertain, with three bars (one outdoors), a beer pong area, DJ booth, dance floor, photo booth, and karaoke.  The mechanical bull that was here previously was replaced by the DJ booth, and not a mechanical leprechaun as I was expecting.  (Don't look at me like that.  Rattlecan had a mechanical pickle that you could ride.)

I came here for happy hour, which goes from 4:00pm - 7:00pm daily and gets you 1/2 price appetizers and draft beers.  There are also daily specials for each day of the week, and are offered open to close: http://www.mcfaddensvegas.com/specials.php.  The happy hour drink specials are decent, you'll end up paying $3.00 - $4.00 for a pint; nothing spectacular.  

The big surprise came from the 1/2 price appetizers; these dishes are huge!  At most you'll be paying $5.50 for an appetizer, and that will be plenty for you to share with others.  Between three of us, we had left overs after ordering four appetizers: chicken fingers, Irish nachos, crispy shrimp, and king crab and artichoke dip.  Everything was good bar food.

Service was really spotty at times.  I ordered a Bumblebee, which is a Boddington's with Guiness layered on top.  When the bartender made it, he poured the Boddington's from a can, even though the menu showed that it was one of their draft beers.  And when it came time to pay, it was almost a 30-minute ordeal.

I tried the cherry limeade and the blueberry lemonade and both were refreshing drink choices. The McFadden's famous Irish nachos were probably the best item here. Interestingly, they are tater tots, which technically Irish nachos are normally fresh fried chips. With that said, they were very tasty with the cheese sauce and loaded with toppings. I always try to get something authentic to the cuisine, so I tried the chicken pot pie.  Unfortunately, the crust was burnt on the ends. The serving size was large, but the gravy had an odd flavor.

The atmosphere said night club, but the building itself said pub. There were too many tables, chairs, and people to move. On top of that there were spilled drinks all over the floor which made it dangerous to walk. They let people up on the bar and poured shot directly into the mouths of patrons then used that same bottle to make my drink. I would bet if the health district and fire marshall came by they would shut it down do to the lack of cleanliness and over crowding. I like going out to clubs but not when they are poorly run.

We saw the bouncer take him out of the line to talk to him. Remind you my husband just finished a 6 month deployment in Iraq and we just wanted to welcome home back with a good time. The bouncer was trying to take advantage of him and asking him to pay him $20 just to get in because of what he  was wearing. Like really?! Who does this l?!

The two different ones I've seen were both nice.  There are hostesses as you walk in, and most of the previous reviews nailed it when they described the hostesses as spacey and just not all there.  Now when I go, I just bypass them and go in and find a seat at the bar.  

The first night I was in here, they had JUSt opened and it was beyond crazy.  Luckily our bartender, Khara, was superb and fast and we never really had to wait long for drinks.  The second night I came with a big group and hung out in the patio area, which was awesome!  The bar was consistently slammed but as we waited people eventually left, opening up seats at the bar.  I think for such a busy place, they could probably do without seats at the bar, but it worked for us!  The bartender was awesome and got us our first round.  It was kind of slow to get drinks, but not moreso than anywhere else that is extremely packed. 

Overall, I think McFadden's is a great place to come when you want to go out drinking with your friends and don't feel like venturing out to the Strip.  It's always good to meet people.  It's fun and crazy and casual. I like it!",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,5,4,4,oQVE9Md2ccjVMK0VA4QXwg

Service: though our server Kelsey was nice, she was late with coming to the table on a dead afternoon. Our orders were wrong and she forgot to put in a order for my parmesan garlic fries and she forgot to give me my sauce when she came back (15mins later) she brought out the fries but she brought me the wrong sauce.... After we wanted to pay we had to wait for another 15mins to get our cards and checks back. And they were wrong...

Food: so the food took forever (1hr) and when it arrived it was made wrong and it was cold not all our food was out either they came out 1 at a time. The burgers were cooked wrong and I repeat they were cold...

Management: you think management would come and apologized for the inconvenience...no...one of our friends had to go alittle bit earlier so they need to get their check, but when we asked MATT the Manager worst management ever... Seriously should be fired... Like no joke.... He had the worst attitude was completely rude to all of us and he even was walking around swearing when their was kids present..horrible....

On a recent trip, my boyfriend and I chose to sit at the bar. It happened to be happy hour. We ordered a Gremlin fishbowl which tasted nothing like the one we ordered in the past. It was a different color as well... more of a yellow than a green. That was a waste of $25.

I ordered the wings which were delicious and my boyfriend's turkey burger was delicious as well but they fell short of the following:

When the server was taking our order he would walk away as I was speaking to him to assist other people or give his badge to the manager. That was VERY RUDE. He never asked my boyfriend how he would like his burger to be cooked, the manager had to come by us later. He also didn't ask him if he wanted fries and whether or not they came separately which is a no-brainer for anyone who is in this industry with barely any customers at the restaurant at that time and maybe 2 more people sitting at the bar.

Not only that, even though my boyfriend went to the effort of ordering those separately before we ordered our main course just to make sure we had time to eat,  no sooner were we tucking in,  they were bringing out our main courses.  There's nothing more annoying than when a restaurant brings out your second course while you're on the first because then you're in this rush to try to eat quickly so your next meal doesn't go cold.  When the runner came out with our meals, we sent him packing quickly. And then the server came out a few minutes later also trying to force the main courses on us. No!!! We are not done with the first course give us a break!!! Finally the second I got my last bite of potato skin in my mouth, the  runner appeared again without meals and this time I was like fine just give them to us. Needless to say I enjoyed warm fish and cold french fries. 

Here's where it gets worse. I am from Australia and I'm very familiar with meat pies and such. I am here to tell you that the pie my boyfriend ordered literally tasted like dirt. I took a bite and I was like, oh my god what the hell is that. So I took another bite to make sure and I am not exaggerating when I tell you that if I put my face in the dirt and opened my mouth, it would've tasted exactly the same. It was truly horrific and that bad. No lie. If you're going to go there, stick with drinks because the food is God awful and they don't give you time to enjoy each course anyway.

Staff was Very Friendly, especially our Waitress. food was Really Good, we tried the Hummus, the Spicy Ahi Crackers & Celtic Wings with Guinness BBQ sauce, everything was Good but the Wings were the Winner of the three. Both of my co-workers had the Fish & Chips, which they really liked. I ordered the 'Kiss Me, I'm Irish' Burger, which I first assumed was a Sandwich but turned out was a Burger, but not with just 1 but 2 patties, & it was Delicious. It was Messy, Juicy & the combination of Flavors worked very well with each other! But the Best Part of the evening was the Live Band Karaoke, which was a first for me & Loved it! The Karaoke Host had a Great Voice & she was very pretty, the band performed really well. Also a Great Plus for me, No Smoking! I realized I was in a Bar that was not smoky then remembered this is still a Restaurant first & foremost but with a Bar-like feel. They had 3 bars from where I could see and so many people enjoying themselves, And a Lot of them girls too, And on a Tuesday night!  But then again this is Vegas! I can't wait to come back, Especially on a Tuesday evening!",pqeKwn-cEaBMT3aN4lMQaw,1,1,5,o3oieRHfpwxJYh94btBjUA

We had just left Blue Martini next door, which had quite the crowd going. Going from Blue Martini to McFadden's was a definite downgrade and to put it bluntly, killed our vibe and put us into sleep mode. Even as we left around 10:30PM, McFadden's was still really slow.

My group decided to sit outside to escape the depressive state inside. The waitress promptly brought out menus and took our orders. She was actually the saving grace of this establishment. She was on top of everything during our short stay and checked on us often. I upped my review to three stars instead of two just because of her. 

The Mister ordered bottled Heinekens ($6-7) and mozzarella sticks ($10). The mozzarella sticks were disappointingly lackluster and served room temperature. The side of marinara tasted off as well. For $10, it was kind of a rip off. :(

I remember years ago, McFadden was always crowded and seemed like the place to be. Now I know to avoid this place if I'm looking for a good time at Town Square. If you want to be where the action's at, stick with Blue Martini or Stoney's instead.

We got there and were greeted by our friendly bartender who quickly informed us of their happy hour specials. In fact he even made it a point to inform me when I ordered something that wasn't on the happy hour menu to give me a heads up and see if that's still what I wanted. Most bartenders won't do that and just gladly charge you full price. We ended up going outside since my friend is a smoker and found a table out there. They have a really nice and spacious patio with ample seating. We chose a spot on one of those long shared tables. After awhile we realized that the waitress was just going to one side of the table and not ours. It took us over 15 minutes for anyone to come by and that was only when we had to stop them. And nothing changed from the original encounter. We had to stop someone every single time we wanted to order. We took a look at the menu and my eye was immediately drawn to the pint of bacon. How could I refuse? So we ordered two for our group and it was delicious! It was a little on the sweet side so I'm guessing they baked it in brown sugar. Delicious nonetheless! The artichoke dip was solid but the chips they served it with were paper thin and not really strong enough for dipping. Even less impressive was the pouting as the gravy had the consistency of jello and the completely bland and flavorless Parmesan wings. On the weekends they have a DJ. Disappointing to not have an Irish band if you're advertising to be an Irish pub. So all in all I'm not in a hurry to go back. Better off going to Blue Martini if you are in the area.

No sign of this being an Irish pub. Why can't Vegas stick to a theme? Why do we have to make everything trashy? 

I've been here on an early Friday and late Saturday. If you come here before 10PM, you can actually hear people and have a conversation. It's not too bad, but still doesn't feel like what a cozy Irish pub should feel like. After 10, the shit show begins. Obnoxious mainstream pop/hip hop music start to blare, ass grinding begins, beer pong happens and fights occur. 

If you want to have a conversation with your friends, forget about it. This place was meant to feel your friends, not hear them. I ended up shouting all night. I was trying to get a little buzz going to like the place more, but their drinks are watered down.

When I handed it to her, she snatched it out of my hand. 

Later, there was a misunderstanding regarding the promo discount wristband that I was given at the entrance. She took it as an opportunity to argue with me about what I was entitled to order with it. When I confronted her to ask what her disrespectful attitude was for, she stuck out her hand and said, ""BYE THEN!"" Well...bye.

Unsurprisingly, management was already on notice about Khara's rudeness. Before I even finished explaining the situation to the manager at the front door, she rolled her eyes and asked me if it was the Asian female bartender. Bingo. The manager apologized and explained that Khara has a history of complaints from patrons. So why is she still working behind the bar? 

What I forgot to mention to management was Khara's unsanitary habit of repeatedly wiping her hands off above her shirt, like she was trying to reach an itch below her top.

All in all, I will definitely be back here.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,7,3,4,LstOySfT_vTBTSbzXLaNjg

The hostess also had a very ""lackluster"" demeanor and seemed like she didn't want to be there. 
We made the best of our evening, but I doubt I will be returning anytime soon.

The waiters/waitresses were all very nice. Three of us got the Fish N Chip and geez, they dont jip you out of any sizes the fish was about the size of the platter plate I got, one person go the corn beef and cabbage and they enjoyed it, they do give you good size portions of food while there.

Three ladies at the hostess stand and no greeting. Disappointing. 

Then we were seated but without the opportunity to ask booth or bar or patio. .

The menu looks very good and inexpensive and once I decided to write this review, I see so many seem to agree that McFadden's is LACKING big in the customer service department. It's very disappointing cause for me if it doesn't go smooth immediately, I know my dining experience and food I will not enjoy. 


in addition, when were seated we called for the hostess twice as she walked away but were ignored. So WE WALKED OUT! Then we were on our way to a more accommodating better serving bar next door.",1pZhDrKyN9ni4oc_xrO_oQ,2,0,1,uQSoA4zVoN-NYrFMGVKoVQ

I've been to this bar multiple times these past few years and can I just say that the music during the weekend never changes.

Came here for a friends celebration since they give out  wristbands and the bartenders are still rude after coming back here. Honestly, I just don't understand why nothing has changed after looking into the reviews of this place. Thought they would change some things by now. 

Some of the bartenders do not know their prices when it comes to drinks. Ordered a drink called the green tea and I went to a few bartenders and they both said different prices.. which made me confused on the correct pricing. Tried giving this place a benefit of the doubt, but I'll probably stray away from this place for good until they change their music and their rude bartenders.",YN_wyoau6tTyLeF_ZHIB2Q,7,1,1,ZaHvXdCwCFxAjjca1Pxt5w
5802989,2013-08-06,2,km5aBHRss5ir_B0jvEErzQ,I am not impressed. I went on a Friday ladies night where there is supposed to be free champagne but they ran out way early.  Lame. The music was all the same crap they played at Cadillac Ranch and I'm sure the same stuff they'll play when this place goes bankrupt and becomes something else next year. The deal breaker for me was when I ordered a Smithwicks and they didn't have it on draft. The whole place just seemed trashy and I wasn't willing to stay long enough to get trashed in hopes of enjoying it. I won't be back unless a friend who's never been insists. Really not an Irish bar.

We wanted to sit on their patio Bc we had our dog with us, this flustered the hostess who had to run around for 5 mins to tell us that no one could serve us outside, but we could order at the bar and take it outside, so we said this was fine. So there I stood at the bar for 10 minutes as the bartender walked passed me 5 different times without so much as an acknowledgment or a glance.  Until he then disappeared into the back for about 5 mins, while I still stood there.  At this time I heard another customer walking out saying how the food took over an hour, luckily upon hearing this I walked out and saved myself anymore wasted time at this place.

We sat at the bar, the bartender asked for our order. I asked if they had any amber beers and was told no and was handed a beer menu.  For being an Irish pub, I was very disappointed with the selection of beers, with most of them being domestic.  I choose a Stella and it was not very cold. It looked as though they were having issues with their beer cooler, foam everywhere being dumped into buckets. 

Not sure what happened after we ordered but trying to get a bartenders attention after this point was nearly impossible. They asked everyone around us if they were good or needed something else. I actually had to wave my hand in the bartenders face to get his attention and he was standing right in front of us making a drink. 

At this point I do not plan on returning here.  There are plenty of other places I can get a cold beer and much better service.",9z3W4AzWHFv_Ba5qE26WQw,11,7,2,CCl9Wyuv_4ErOYY3tfji9w

Sometimes it can be packed but it's just awful because the bartending staff especially the Asian girl is very popular for being rude to every customer that comes in there it turns out that when I started to talk to some people sitting next to me they said there is no use in making a complaint because this Asian girl bartender is dating the manager or the owner or something when I asked her for a refill of my Moscow mule she told me I am going to have to wait and she actually never even returned sometimes they open it up and make it a nightclub which is kind of fun and it could have made one of the best hotspots to hang out in
But the service staff I believe should be replaced we also had a waitress that took for ever during lunch that we got up and we left so I am actually leaving this review after giving it multiple tries I have been there two maybe three times and I wish I can think of something positive other than that they can be really fun but the staff makes it incredibly hard to get drinks from you will have to go to the back by the nightclub where are the men are working if you deal with that Chinese girl and that is your first impression I guarantee you will either walk out or just never return

Got the 3 Cheese to Go with included cup of tomato soup,  both menus are extensive for 2 people so we ordered what we wouldn't find else where. 
Ryan greeted us at our table and took our order. Shock Top on draft and bottled water was refreshing. We got the McFadden Irish Nachos, if u like tots, cheese and bacon, these were Awesome.  Chicken Wings were Excellent, nice crispy charred flavor using sauce for additional flavor.  Wife got the Fish and Chips, sub Mac n Cheese for Fries for buck more, nice portion of Mac n Cheese. Fish was wild caught Alaskan Cod, filet had delicious oily flavor, cod is also known as Butterfish, batter was flavorful and melded with Cod flavor. I got Reuben Burger, Winners, Corned Beef strips were well seasoned, could've been a sandwich by itself. Burger must've been 1/3 of a Pound at 3/4"" thick, got Burger medium done, nice Charred flavor and burger tasted like a good ground steak.  
All in All food ordered was Great and Tasty.   Customer Service by Ryan and Crew were top notch, very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about what the menus offered and how to order the food items.
