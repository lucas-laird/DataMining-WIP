IHOP no, no this is not an IHOP it's a place where scumbags and druggies hang.

I love ihop, but this is a location that you would think would keep clean, have friendly staff BUT let me stress the clean part because this place was far from it.

There was some very suspect people in the booth at the other corner of the place that well, can anyone say drug deal????

many people who visit Vegas tent to stick to the ""pretty"" places, but i like to venture out and see what a place is really like...

Vegas is a city on the grow, and thats why this kinda crap needs to be cut short..wanna deal go home deal from ya house.

As for the location this is just south of the strat and on the same side, its right near a tattoo parlor which if you want to get a bit of ink and wanna sit in the window on show while they do it, thats the place to go.

Nothing was too exciting about this branch north of Las Vegas strip. It opened 24-hours a day. We went there at 1AM on a Sunday. That's life in sin city... hehehe... I will say no more!

It's very cold that night. It even rained with strong wind at 2 AM before we left. So I ordered hot chocolate (HC). Oh my Buddha!!!! It's $2.59 per cup (ordinary coffee cup), no refill. What a big rip off. I usually pay $0.10 per package. It's 26 times mark up. And my friends had the expected refill of coffee and soft drinks of the same price.

I felt the world has come to a stop when the price of refillable drinks going from $0.99 to $2.99 lately. And worse, people embrace it head over heel and most don't even ask for refill. Let's see if HC will catch on... $2.99 a cup (regular cup) with no refill.

The foods were OK at 1:30 AM. Edible. I gave our waiter a big tip for giving me a free cup of HC after I complained. But I will pay close attention to price jacking from now on... I do have a limit how much I will tolerate for this average chain. Sky is not the limit on my value land.

--busser drops tray full of glass tumblers, sending shards of glass flying, and onto my table and booth. nice!
--10 servers, 2 hosts, 2 cashiers, countless bussers and managers all chat lazily over their patrons. great vibe.

--pan handlers fight over us (fresh bait) as we walk the sidewalk. Mine! Mine! MINE!

Don't miss the $100-move-in/$300-per-week rooms for rent next door. the view of the sky through the caving roof is framed well through the gaping holes which used to be glass window panes. maybe there was a bomb test conducted there?

My family and I were placed in the first available seat, which was a booth.  However, I'm a bigger guy and booths aren't my first choice when dining.

How awesome, that Erika observed and went out of her way when her responsibility with me had already been completed.  Thanks Erika!

Our server Aurora, was outstanding and immediately we had our order almost as fast as the click of your fingers.  She was Jenny-on-the-spot, with our drinks and our special requests.  Thanks Aurora!

The overall experience I feel is because of a caring and well organized staff.  Thanks to Scott, the cooking staff and all the above for making my family's experience so wonderful!

Hope all is well! I ate there today with my wife and had the worst experience!
 I believe the managers name is Mike. While we were waiting with others on the bench.I saw this guy insulting and harassing his own staff. I saw him yell and berate a waitress by the name of Nancy! I am in the same buisness and never in a million years I talk to my staff in the tone or unprofessional  manner  he does.   Reprimanding should be in private not on public display for the customer to hear and see! I heard him tell her"" if you can't wait on people just go home ! And pointed at the door. She tried to explain her self . Mind you this is all happening at the front podium were you check in with the hostess. She tried to explain and he gave her the T with his hands referring to her to stop talking.Then starts talking about Nancy with Hostess an older lady with violet short hair and wear glasses who yells people's names out like she works at a truck dinner off the I-90 !!! Honestly I've thought seen it all! Our waitress Gabby was great and very kind hearted. But I feel IHOP is doing a disservice by keeping Mike and the gossip mill Hostess  around and should really evaluate about getting a more professinal assistant manager! By the way. I'm calling Shawn the store manager on Friday when he gets back from vacation . I can't beleive people like this represent such a fine company!
   Sorry for the long story !!! To the staff at the IHOP!!! Stop suffering in silence. Work should be fun not degrading. This happened on a Thursday I can only imagine Mike on a Sunday he must be Epic. Mike not to be mean but being an assisant manager of a resturant is not your calling! Im just saying .Corprate should give this guy a climate survey!!!!!!!
 "" There's micro management and then on the other spectrum there's  harassment""
I'm sure he's gonna be singing a different tune after this YELP!

There was also a strange woman in there and I'm almost pretty sure she was doing drugs but I didn't hang around long enough to find out.
