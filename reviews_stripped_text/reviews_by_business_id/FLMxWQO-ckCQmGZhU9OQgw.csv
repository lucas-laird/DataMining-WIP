He is happy  always no matter what a mad house the buffet area becomes. He has great memory for the regular repeat customers and he has an amazing staff. I would go to the buffet just to see Sal. You will agree once yoy have experienced his style of customer service. The food is great, service is superb and there is great customer service.",-zhTh4mkrSI8reoluiEa2Q,1,1,4,CaB7M8gLBWjVNYj38mjIIA

The pho noodles weren't completely cooked & was flavorless.

Hubby said roast beef dry.  Although the mongolian fresh food was decent along with the beets salad.

Coconut & tiramisu gelato was good as with the tres leches.  

Why only 2 stars? The food wasnt fresh enough in a large enough quantity to make it appealing to me.

5 stars for the wait staff service, but that alone nor the desserts will get me back in that place...",JoKlIXsU-W-zwBIPi6nNGA,1,0,1,_9MftU42DLIjJla2wsYDiw

First impressions, massive! Like massive massive! There was soo much choice! 
Often with buffets, some of the food can be sitting there for a while and end up being dry, but not this place!

When we arrive the lady was replacing the chinese roast duck with a freshy. It was amazing good! On par with duck you get from hongkong!

The ribeye, cooked to perfection!

They also had a make your own noodle bar. Pho, udon, ramen, etc. The wife asked the chef to make her a bowl of plain Pho witb some greens. Half way through she found a friend in her soup... A lady beetle! Not happy...

Called the manager over and they happily refunded her meal which was the least that they could do!
When you are such a reknowned buffet in Vegas, you would think that some more care would be put into preparing the food. 

But other than that, it was a good experience. And lots of choice.",7fuDB6C0Eyxom9rjOMiscA,2,1,3,YfSL2H9LrrxyFCVPKYJDHQ

Buffet is spread out, you will burn calories just walking from your table to the buffet and vice versa. Our booth was in the corner, try to be seated somewhere in the center. The place has a feel of a huge diner, did not like that.
Food choices were ordinary, nothing wowed me, not even deserts. I suppose I was expecting more of different, unique, fun food choices considering the price.

Everything you find in a cheap buffet you will find in this one. This place does not compare to Wicked spoon or buffet at the Wynn, not even close.",RjeVrZtWBs7hmwNzlU_BVg,1,0,2,iQplkC6wcycJAxCTIRoiFg

I got their chicken, ribs, kielbasa sausage and prime rib. It was OK at best. After that first plate, I went to the fried stuff, hush puppies, onion rings and other fried foods that I can't even remember. After scarfing my second food of plate, I decided to take a break and assess how much more food I can take. After a few minutes, I decided to take a stroll to the lines of food one last time. I wanted to try some pastas and Italian foods but it looked so messy that I resisted the urge. Their Asian food section had the traditional westernized Asian food so I stayed away from them as well, I decided to take some cocktail shrimps which were surprisingly good, but not great. Finally, I went to get my main meal of the day:desserts. I got the tiramisu and cookies and cream gelato, and some other sweet treats which, again, was OK.

79878,2015-01-13,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"The Rio's Carnival World Buffet feels like a school cafeteria. Its food can't hope to compete with the fresher and more modern fare you can find at Bellagio and Cosmopolitan, and the ambiance lacks by comparison to its competitors. However, I'm giving it two stars because the food is edible and you won't go away hungry.

My girlfriend and I visited these three buffets (Bellagio, Rio, Cosmopolitan) during the weekend of January 9-11, 2015. By far the Rio was the poorest option. The lone standout moment was the inexpensive bottle of wine they offered us, $10.80 for a bottle of Barefoot pinot grigio. Otherwise, it suffered in many particulars:

1) Less variety: The website asks you to ""picture the length of a football field"" when imagining the buffet. The physical dimensions of the layout may well be that long, but length doesn't translate into tangible variety. My vegetarian girlfriend especially found that the buffet had only a few dishes for her. We also saw no gluten-free options.

2) Poorer quality: The food here looks like it just emerged from the back end of a Sysco truck. The enchiladas were stale, the sushi had more rice than fish, and the guacamole didn't seem fresh. Fried food dominated the savory selection. The desserts were in the cookies-and-apple-pie genre: nothing wrong with them, but lacking the finesse of the macarons-and-petits-fours of other buffets. The gelato was among the poorest of its kind that we've had in some time.

3) Downscale atmosphere: Even if you prefer the food at the Rio, it would be hard to ignore the environment. You are given a paper napkin instead of cloth, cheap flatware and small plates instead of relatively luxurious implements, and one fork instead of two. You sit at old melamine-topped tables instead of wood. The feel is that of a cafeteria.

In its favor, the buffet was about $10 cheaper per person than the other two we tried. However, this cost difference does not make it a good value -- that $10 difference was sorely felt. If you really are scrimping, you might save for a few days by eating at Chipotle, and then ""splurge"" at better Strip hotels.

I live for the buffets out there.  I love to eat and I love having a nice selection of food to choose from.  And it's always nice to not have to cook once in awhile.  During my last trip, I only managed to sample a handful of buffets, Carnival being one of them. 

First of all, Carnival is not on the strip.  So, it wasn't as convenient to access.  But I found a shuttle bus from Bally's, so I ventured onward.  One of my friends visits Vegas regularly and recommended this buffet.  I wasn't disappointed.

From the buffets that I've tried (Bellagio, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Monte Carlo, Tropicana), this one had the largest selection by far.  The buffet is huge!  It didn't have the best food.  But, the food was good and the selection was great.  There was a taste of many cuisines, ranging from Japanese to Chinese to Italian to American traditional to Indian to Mexican and then some.  The desserts were pretty good, especially the gelato.

It's true that the meat was not exceptional but good enough, and they have everything good enough, I found nothing disappointing, that's why I like this. Well, they do have some stuff that aren't for my taste buds, not because those items were bad, it's just because I don't usually eat those items even outside a buffet, so not their fault. Meanwhile they also have alot of selections at the same time to compensate. So I found enough varieties of food that suites my taste so I like this buffet and would go there again. 
I like their seafood, which include clams, mussels, etc. I like their prime rib, and some other selections of meat entree, and they got peach cobbler, great gelato and cannoli! Great buffet for my taste.
And I also like that customers can pay by credit card with a kiosk to avoid long lines. You would have to line up if you want to charge the buffet to your room though.
The server was polite and had good attitude, and the chef who cut the prime rib was polite. These are pluses for me as I look at these areas as well when rating a buffet. I recommend this buffet to people who loves buffet.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,4,7ZNnEzohawCThJLyfQRtSQ

CONS:
It was more expensive than most buffets ($23 pp for dinner) and it's away from the strip.  
HOWEVER there is a FREE shuttle that runs from Paris, Harrah's, and Caesars!   

PROS:
The Entrance looks like a line up to a carnival ride; numerous lanes that all have atm looking-like machines that you can use cash or CC to auto pay; even has the option to add your own gratuity! So there the lineup goes fast.

Servers are at the front to seat you and you have your own waiter designated to your area; lots of places to sit so no complaints there.

It is Vegas so there is a full bar on site as well. Prices are a lot lower than most places.  They even have hourly drink speicals.

Now the food; HUGE plethora of things to choose from and it's all sorted out for you
Desert, fresh sea food, pasta/Italian, fried foods, ""hearty home cooked foods"", Mexican, Asian infused, salads, soups, and American.  There is so much to chose from so leave A LOT of time and make sure you walk around first or you end up getting a plate of the most random things to eat.  They even have their own noodle/pho bar!  Seafood selection is endless and the King Crab legs are HUGE!!  I have to also mention my 2 favs:  BBQ Pork (perfection, tender and juicy as if it was right out of a store front window in Chinatown!) and their red velvet cake (moist, not too sweet, cream cheese frosting, INCREDIBLE!)

I've been here numerous times throughout the years, but it has been quite awhile since I last visited. Inexplicably, the line at 7pm was very long. We persevered but were disappointed to find out that they reduced the locals discount from 50% to 25%. The regular price for Sunday dinner with the Total Rewards card discount is currently $29.99. Since we were with company, we decided to pay the higher than expected price and hope the food was still decent. That was a poor assumption, unfortunately. While the buffet probably has the largest selection in town, the quality has deteriorated even further than it's mediocre heyday. For example, the grilled mahi mahi and breaded haddock were fishy and singularly unappetizing. Perhaps, the best items are the Chinese duck (if you can actually get a decent piece before it is cherry-picked by other diners) and the dessert station. However, compared to other upscale buffets, calling their gelato and other desserts lackluster is being generous. In the past, it would merit 3 stars, but in its current state and price point, it is a 2-star experience at best.

This buffet was completely and utterly disgusting.

First of all, the Rio is skanky.  The people walking through are the dregs of humanity, and they're all chain-smoking.  The Rio obviously hasn't invested in a ventilation system, and the smell of cigarette smoke pervades the whole place.  This includes the buffet.

There's two lines for this place: the line for coupons and comps, which is massive and takes forever, and the line for the idiots paying full price.  I was in the latter line, which wasn't all the way out the door, but I should have taken the hint that if they have to give the food away, you don't want to actually eat there.  Since the staff here are completely incompetent, getting seated takes way longer than it should.  

The good thing about this buffet is that it's got an immense array of dishes.  The bad thing about this buffet is that they don't have a single good cook on staff.  The vast majority of the food that I tried was either bland or cold, and much of it was both.  The meats were cheap and chewy.  If you could get past the morons piling up their plates with the crab legs and the shrimp and get one for yourself, you'd realise that they aren't worth the effort to peel off the shell, because they're slimy and disgusting.  The only thing that was even close to edible was the tortilla chips and the bright yellow cheese-like substance to go on them.

Our waitress was super duper nice. Like, almost too nice-- she and I got stuck in a ""thank you"" ""no thank you!"" ""oh, thank you"" circle, because I'm also in the service industry and it becomes habit to just say it after a while. I think her name was Opelia. She was super on it with the refills; our glasses were constantly being topped off and if we happened to finish, never sat empty for more than a minute. Needless to say, the bottomless mimosas were a big reason we chose the Rio as our brunch destination and I really feel they delivered well.

The food was good but none of it was like, mind-blowing. My boyfriend enjoyed the cold crab legs, which were pre-sliced. They were super salty, but good! My favorite thing was the custom pancake station-- my banana-and-M&M bear pancake was delicious and adorable. There was a huge variety and no wait for anything, unless someone else was at one of the custom stations ahead of you.

I remember my first visit. May 99'. Saw star wars with other people in my AP Biology class because we had just crushed our test and then came here for some grub.  It was sooooo good.  The buffet was set up a little different back then but I remember thinking, how is it possible to have all this good food for such a modest price. I was only 17 and the Orleans was like the only buffet I had ever been to I think.  

So I continued going to eat once in a while and it was good and good and good, and then it sort of got not as good, then not as good, and now its kind of like OK i guess.   Um they changed a bit of the food around and the quality isn't quite the same as it was especially on the desserts. I used to look forward to having something amazing for dessert but lately I'd rather pick up a slice of cake from the grocery store or something. Although the gelato, vanilla especially, is still worth going for. 

On a positive note, the amount and selection of food is unmatched I think,  and many of the items are still real good eats.  Also they have a special for locals that get you 1/2 off except on saturdays. Which puts this buffet into basically the local buffet price range and an exceptional deal.  They also have a bar in the buffet where you can get draft beers or drinks for a decent price. 

The service has always been great for me. I can't ever remember a visit where I could complain about service, I just wish they'd keep the food quality a bit higher in some places, but to each their own.  Definitely stop by and try it, especially if you're local, or got a local friend.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,0,0,3,B-f__0gdK_JlGzP-K5Uoyg

Right now I'm laying in my bed upstairs in the Rio, writhing around in pain due to the almost certain food poisoning ill be receiving from my $35 dog slop courtesy of the carnival world buffet. After writing this review ill probably try to go throw up to get these disease-ridden, rancid animal carcasses out of my body that they try to pass off as edible food. 

I found a duck tooth in the serving tray, mentioned it to my friend, and an employee hurriedly ran over and tried to hide the fact that one of these foul, rotten pond creatures had lost a molar in my dinner to be. 

Our waiter came over and was touching the food on my plate with his bare hands in an attempt to give me some unwarranted advice on opening the soggy, atrophied crap they were calling crab legs.

Our server sat me one foot away from a pile of trash and crab detris the size of a dinner plate on the bench seat next to where I was supposed to be able to eat, which of course was impossible due to the rancid fumes coming off this bullshit.

What topped off my terrible experience was looking across the dining hall and seeing a server with his hand deep down the back of his pants, scratching his ass crack, after which he got right back into handling food and drinks. 

Ohh yea, forgot to mention that they let some snobby old woman bring her little dog into the restaurant, just to have it shit all over the place and not get cleaned up for 20 minutes. 

I'm very surprised the rio is still allowed to be open and hasn't killed anyone yet. Ohh wait, that will probably be me in 30 mins. My last words on this earth will be to prevent any would be patrons from dining here.

As part of the Buffet of Buffets program, my family and I came here to dine first. We'd come back a few more times before leaving Las Vegas. 

First off, the place has TONS of food from all kinds of different ethnic cuisines. All of it is yummy. From the dim sum to the chicken wings to the pretzel bread to the pseudo-churrasco area of meats, everything was just so tasty!

The standards were great. This is actually the first place I've ever had chilled crab legs, but they tasted fantastic! A little on the smaller side, but hey, it's a buffet. The prime rib was excellent! It was well seasoned, perfectly cooked and unbelievably tender. I still prefer the prime rib at Le Village, though. 

The desserts were amazing as well. The little various torts they had were good, as was the flan and cheesecake. What really shines is the gelato. It was awesome!",PVvE3Zsp35dNIdEGpSjfyw,0,0,4,OAMjcoi0zfHiCEbOGC6hww
270543,2007-11-20,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"I was at this buffet with a couple of friends on my last Vegas trip (11/9-11/11). In my opinion the food selection was pretty good, the food itself ranged from good to okay, the service was lousy, the ambience was average, at least for a Vegas buffet, and a long line that went faster than it seemed.

What the buffet lacked in some aspects of food quality, the more than made up for it with variety. There is something for all tastes and cravings, and maybe a little bit more. Although we were disappointed with the crab legs, everything else was average to good. Yes they have more variety of faux sushi than I've ever seen, however the real sushi, and sushi eaters should be able to tell the difference, tasted nice and fresh. The prime rib was bland, I would much rather have the one at Bills (old Barbary Coast), but the baked breaded chicken was a stand out in my opinion.

There was one thing that stood out in the eyes of my friend, who is a seasoned international traveler. She said that the duck that was being served in the Chinese section of the buffet was better than any duck she's tasted in any North American Chinatown she's been to (NYC, Chicago, SF, LA, Toronto, and Vancouver), and it ranked up there with a few dishes she tasted in China. I was too full to try it, but that was enough to get my other friend out of his chair. I guess we came on a good night.

Pros: Wide variety of food choice, fast dinner line, decent price (I found out later that coupons for the Rio buffet are very easy to find and can save you $5-$10 if you take the time to thumb through those Vegas coupon books).

Cons: Food average to so-so, a few hidden gems, but you must try the selections to get the best choice, off the strip...any savings with coupons will be eaten by the cab fare over there.

To sum it up: With the food winners and loosers being served here, it's literally a crap shoot.",xP1jrr_fW6KZ-MDkrOPtaQ,0,0,3,2fz84xnXm9j68fZw9oSJLA

We went to this buffet after my wedding as my ""reception"" since I wanted everybody to like the type of food and I heard it was nice. I didn't expect to go in and be shown enough food to feed a small country for a week! We got there earlyish (4:30) so we got a seat very quickly. I started on one end and walked to the other. That took about 15 mins. Then I saw the crab legs.... My husband- LOVES crablegs. The set up was so much we took pictures next to it to send to my father-in-law who then called us to scream at us for eating there without him. :) Next time...",IsyFVyx2K3Ime-c1JeuQRA,1,1,5,a-aDJPUGSFsdWwG7o8RuPg
350953,2013-08-12,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"PROS:
- I have tried many buffets on the strip, but I must say this one had the widest and best selection of different dishes! There is a gelato bar with about 10 flavors of delicious ice cream! There are certain dishes that I don't see at other buffets, such as duck and other Asian dishes. The buffets at Mandalay, Imperial, Caesar's, Paris are small compared to this place. 
- The price is the average price for comparable buffets on the strip, about $25 for lunch/dinner
- There is no long line because the place is so big and can accommodate more people.

CONS:
- It is located inside the Rio Hotel, which is a couple blocks off the main strip where all the other large hotels are. It is not within walking distance. You have to drive there.",DNivTWKKnahb6fFUkQm1iQ,1,1,4,dRAYTp9wfxn9XXN56XOKpw

The only thing that wasn't too good, to me, was the seafood. Do not expect the highest quality seafood from this buffet. While it wasn't bad, it just wasn't cooked great either. Crab legs were soggy, but not sure if this can be avoided at a buffet style restaurant.

Anyhow, my family and I went for dinner and really enjoyed their Japanese stir fry, you get to pick shrimp or beef and put all the veggies you want.  Mushrooms, bean sprouts, garlic, and shrimp, SO good.  

Their gelato was pretty, but a little disappointing.  But I liked their red velvet cake.  Very good.  Usually buffet cakes are dry and not so great, but this one was good.  Moist and the icing wasn't too sweet, like most of those cardboard cakes that try to hide the cardboard-ness with too sweet icing.  

I thought it was great.  Will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.  Plus the ceiling parade is good old Vegas fun.",PvZJfci7_liNsn57U5EfWA,1,1,4,z_eNAz6hi8uAoo10P5PFDA

Funny story...This was actually a first date dinner :P I mean seriously, who goes to a buffet on a first date?! I do, that's who! Any woman who is willing to eat at a buffet on a first date, is my kind of woman! I love a woman who is not afraid to eat in front of me. 

First off, they serve Pepsi products...BOO!!! The pizza was pretty tasty. The pasta & meat sauce wasn't too bad, better than most buffets I have been to. The peel & eat scrimps were very good. I don't think I would ever get the snow crab legs here again though. Too much work, for not much of a reward. The Asian section was OK. The soups were pretty good, for buffet. Egg & Udon noodle combo, Yum! 

Finally, the dessert...Tiramisu & coconut gelato, red velvet cake, carrot cake, chocolate cake & a chocolate eclair. The gelato was very good. The cakes were actually moist, not like the dry ones you find at other buffets around town. The eclair was OK. The filling wasn't anything special &kind of thick. 

Overall, the buffet was fairly decent. I would definitely come back & would recommend it as well. Especially to take advantage of the Locals discount ;)

Not that many choices.
 SUSHI, Worst sushi I ever had. My boyfriend always says I can eat anything in the world except for poop, and say it's really good.Just think about how bad the sushi was. the rice was too sweet and sour.only 4 kinds of sushi. one was vege. I am meatlover, so I didn't try. Spicy tuna roll, you know what you should never eat spicy tuna roll when they are using ground tuna to make it because they always put old tuna in it or they buy ground tuna from their supplier which means worse.There maybe another kind, IDon't even remeber.
Crab legs, salty as hell.salty!!!!!!!!!!!!
WINE, can u believe any good restaurant make barefoot as their house wine?!!!!
Okay, I have to admit their Mexican and Italian were not that bad, 300+food, you probably can only eat 10 kinds which includes dessert.

Lack of Choice.

Seriously, they dropped 15-20% of the dishes.  Beef?  Only at the slicing station, forget about the 5 other tasty choices they had.

Shrimp?  Only when they feel like putting out a serving plate-size of it, and by-they-way, it's crammed in a corner by the salsa (Salsa!) so you can't find it even when they deign to put it out.

Mexican?  Not any more.

Asian dishes?  Kung Pao something, and no longer the variety they once had.

Dessert is the WORST.  Seriously.  Pie and ice cream.  Not even refilled any more.  You just can't screw up a dessert section, and they have.  

It's like one of those restaurants in a strip mall that gave up on service and quality, relying only on their laurels to make it, and it won't be for long.

Prime rib :)
Amazing. Absolute best prime rib I've ever tasted. Friends who live in Vegas told us it's hit-or-miss though, so apparently we went on a good day. Thin slices unless you ask the chef for a larger slice :) but so tender and full of flavor that day...better than Ruth's Chris or any other steak house!

Service :)
Our waiter was outstanding, unlike typical buffet servers who usually seem stressed or preoccupied. Our server, Brian, was attentive and friendly, and even mixed special drinks for our kids. He was friendly and accommodating and he actually seemed to enjoy his job. Our only regret is that our tip was included when we paid the cashier, so we're not sure if it went to him or to some general fund.

Other foods
Crab legs were good but not great. But when it's all-you-can-eat with plenty of drawn butter, you can't be picky.

Chinese dumplings (siu mai and ha gow) were tasty.

Desserts
Plenty of variety. Cakes, pies, so many different flavors of gelato, ice cream...

This is one of the included options in the 24-hour buffet-pass that can be purchased on Caesars entertainment properties.

They do have a bar in the middle of it,  and regardless you went with the open bar package or not, you can get your drinks in a steady phase without any major interruptions.

Anyways, there is a great assortment from Chinese to stir fry to pasta to American to seafood. It is a huge buffet.

The front entrance of the buffet reminds me of a corral where cattle are herded into. There's electronic pay machines one one side, and a small booth for the human counterparts. The problem here is when you want to get a discount, which you can get $1 off with their member card, you have to line up in the human one, and that one is LONG at times.

Service is pretty lazy, and the layout of the buffet seating is pretty odd in places. Booths can feel broken at times, and chairs are uncomfortable. Drinks are drinks, but the alcohol service is pay by drink (others like Studio B are complimentary). 

This buffet is large, but most of it is made up of ""make your own"" stations that suck. Make your own tacos (with prepackages/easy to cut up stuff), and whatnot litter this place. 

The food is basically O.K. Not amazing, but not disgusting by any means. Salad and soups are standard fare, asian sections sit around for a while (cheap sushi sits out, and certain steamed items get hard and gooy after a while). Crab legs (though I hate them) were rather thin, but people still flock to them. What I find surprising is that the previously frozen fried food was great--fried perfectly, and the deserts were pretty good (aside from the random one that looks great, but tastes horrid and is hard to eat).

The heavyweights may even just get sick of looking at the food and the long lines but they benefit from buffets the most. The food is redundant and at times plain, depending on the cook or load you get. People rave about the crab legs and prime rib but i've had better going to specific locations for this type of food.

Yes, it's true there is variety but for the price your paying, I don't see it being all that worth it. Desserts and food was not memorable to come again for. Honestly thought the buffet at the Excalibur tasted better and less expensive. 

The quality of the food you eat at specific places is more satisfying than the quantity you get to see/taste at the Rio.",9EdoVpu_aAGd6bBg_G2scg,0,0,3,e0hl2d5hQYem9HFuoG8pqw

And about 6 party's that were behind us were able to get seated before us in the line we were previously in. Art pissed off a lot of people that night because all the parties behind us were saying the same thing. Good thing our server was a good guy. The food was good.

Long version: Came here using Buffet of Buffet pass on Christmas Day. Was a madhouse, but since there were two in our party we didn't have to wait as long as the large tourist groups did.

The food was delicious. Now, it's a buffet, so don't expect everything to be like a made-to-order restaurant. But they did have m-t-o items! Each buffet station is a different region. You could go here every day for every meal and not try everything on offer for a week--there is THAT much food.

There's a Mongolian-style grill in the Asian cuisine area. There's sushi, Italian, American... but the desserts are the best. Ten different kinds of gelato, cakes, pies, cupcakes... yeah. You could spend half your day trying to eat everything here.

We went around 8:30 and waited in line for about an hour. We watched as table sat empty and un-bussed as the staff would stand there and chit chat. When we asked if we could sit at the empty table sitting right i front of us we were told that we couldn't because there were no servers for that table. Perhaps they were too busy talking to serve another table. When we were finally taken to our table we counted the empty tables along the way and counted 9 just on the way to our table.

Paid local (ID required) price for 50% off. $15.99 plus tax and tip for 2.Must pay with cashier. Machine will not do discount. Don't wait in wrong line. My expectations was for a $16 dollar meal. Not cheap for breakfast. Service was really good(nobody there). No wait today. Great right. No, food had been sitting. Old.  We got there at 10:30am. Breakfast was awful. No made to order waffles or pancakes. They did have omelet station. I had a egg white omelet with all veggies no cheese made to order. No wait. It was good but not great. Did not try the hour old packages or waffles. Had fruit instead. For the price I would give breakfast a zero. Cold, old food just sitting.  

Lunch started at 11:00am. Shrimp(cold and fried) was good. Sushi was all rice and  left over from yesterday. Pizza was good from a wood fire oven. BBQ chicken was fresh right a 11:00am. Salads were good also. Lunch saved the day. Good but not great. Burgers, fries, onion rings under heat lamps. YUCK. This is why I gave a 2 star. But I would not have paid full lunch price. Pay before 11am to get the breakfast price. 

For $4.99 I would head over to Red Rock or Green Valley for Buffet. Just as good or a little better. Carnival World Buffet is definitively not what I remember from 8 years ago.",lInhdPu-QAu0xqoOfK3-mw,0,0,2,uFiFty7vIgL6It1g58lUEQ

In 2003, they left me with an unforgettable experience and the food was really yummy. I went back to the buffet in 2008 and it was by far still really good food. Then doing the recession they offered Locals 50 percent off and it used to be a really great value. I would go once a week since it was only 12.99 for dinner. However, I noticed in 2012, they started cutting back on the desserts, the food quality starting becoming tasteless and cold, and the price went up. Recently, this year its no longer 50 percent for a local if you have a gold total rewards card. It's only a 25 percent discount and its now 35 dollars for 2 adult locals for lunch. It's way overpriced for cold, low endless food. The pastries are barely there and mainly just a few fruit pies and gelato. This used to be my favorite buffet but now I will never go back after the experience I have had this year with the food tasting bad. i noticed different managers were working there now than the managers in 2012. If they bring back the carnival world buffet like it were in 2008, then I would go once a week and pay the extra fee, but to me its not worth it.

If you plan on walking there from the strip you might as well join all the dead animals out in the desert. 

This place is huge. The food I thought was great and the service was good too. They had everything that most buffets don't have, they cook food, make soups and noodles and much more. There's obviously Asian foods, because we all know a buffet is nothing without Asian food, steaks, and salad bars. 

There's a whole section for deserts, and gelato. You can mix all your gelato into one big pile of mess and some how it still tastes like cookies and cream with a hint of mango and strawberries.

Think you'll consume too much calories? That's not problem! you can get your salad than walk a mile down the buffet to get your steaks, walk back half a mile to get Asian foods and than walk a quarter mile to your seat. Forgot that stir fry? That's ok, it's only a mile up from your table. You'll burn more calories than you consume just walking around.

Here's a hint...go to Bally's casino and wait for the Rio shuttle bus to take you to Rio. It's only a 5 minute drive and doesn't cost you anything, maybe tip. Cheaper than a taxi and faster than walking.",9m2_9wTiATczzA77xNM7-A,6,1,4,ezueO_Cig8iyplZ9onH69A
671542,2015-01-26,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"Ate at the Carnival World Buffet yesterday, Saturday, for champagne brunch.  Overall good, and a fair price ($29.99 w/ Player's Card), but nothing to rave about

In fairness, I would have given it 3.5 stars, but I can't find a way to give a half star.

My friend and I arrived early, at 8 a.m.  That was nice b/c the food just came out and no one but two or three others were there.

They do have a great variety, so there is something for everyone.

I started with the cold snow crab and ""prime rib.""  The crab was OK, but the legs could have been larger.    The hot crab legs looked even smaller, so I passed on those.  The cocktail sauce was good with the crab.  Oh, don't forget to ask your server for the little plastic crab tool to break shells and extract the meat.  It did help.

The beef was not prime rib.  Probably a round roast.  Because I was the first to have any, the server cut me a nice MR piece from the center.  It was fine, but nothing compared to a tender prime rib.

I also tried the peel and eat shrimp.  I took about 20 of them, but after struggling w/ the first to remove its exoskeleton, I decided to skip the other 19 crustaceans.  They really should serve either peeled and deveined shrimp or larger ones.

I also tried a Korean or Chinese Beef Korabi, or something like that. It was tasty, although very oily.  The shrimp pad Thai was good, although the shrimp very pretty small.  The fried rice was good.  The Seafood Kung Pao was prettty good, although the only seafood was calamari.

Best item I had was the roast duck.  If you like duck, then get there early and head for the crispy canard in the far right corner.  This was very good, nearly equalling a duck confit at a good French restaurant.  The leg and thigh were both juicy and had crispy skin.  Kudos to the chef on this one.

I had other dishes that were all fine, but I don't remember all of them.  The grilled chicken skewers were good and bad.  That is, the breast meat was dry but the thigh meat was good.  They also had some tomato Asian seafood soup. I thought that was awful, and luke warm at best.  The chicken flautas and samosas were good.

Having left room for desert I partook in the chocolate chip cookies (good), the chocolate mousse cake (very good), and the mango, coconut and vanilla gelatos, all of which were very good.  I really liked the Cuban gentleman who served the gelato.  He offered me a taste of each and had a nice personality and was friendly.  Sorry, but I dont' recall his name.

Oh, the Champagne.  They served William Wycliffe.  Well, it's better than Andre, but worse then Korbel.  It was too sweet for me.  I suppose if you mix it with OJ it is tolerable.  But, I'm a wine snob, so the least acceptable bubbly for me is Schramsburg or Chandon.  I prefer Imperial and especially Veuve Cliquot.  But, no one serves those on a buffet lest the price would be $100.

Finally, a comment about our waitress, whose name I also forgot. She was witty and friendly.  She was about 60 and had lived in Corona Del Mar, CA.  We left her a nice tip.

To summarize, overall good.  Nothing was bad, and the value fair.  

Final comment, upon our arrival on Thursday afternoon we checked out the seafood buffet.  My observation left me unimpressed.  There was no king crab or good lobster or big peeled shrimp. I recommend passing on this one, given the price is north of $40!",IElJMTtqL-Ytsun19LIf2g,2,0,3,UvyxthsRdB321_DWU1CVBQ

The last time I ate here was HORRIBLE. I went here on Dec. '09 and they had this special where locals get half off the price. Like for locals per person would only be $7 but for tourist would be $14. So we waited for 1hour and 30 minutes in line. when we were almost there the line split to two. they had one line for locals and one line for tourist. So we couldn't see that little sign that was being blocked by the crowd so we just went to any line.

I'm pretty sure they were LAZY and IT WAS SO BUSY that they didn't even CARE to try to do anything about it. So we had no choice but to make it worth it.

We had dinner one night and was pretty happy with it considering it's a buffet.  One of the better buffet's I've eaten at.  Prime rib was good. Not as good as house of prime rib in SF of course, but better than any other buffet I've been to.  Mashed potatoes were real chunky mashed red skin potatoes if that gives you an idea of what to expect.  If you want a $50 dinner at a nice restaurant, then go there. If you want a buffet meal with great food - come here.There is so much to choose from, you can't even consider trying it all.  something for everyone, which is always great with a group.

We had a late breakfast on our last day in Vegas, here and it was delicious.  Lots to choose from and the hostess pointed out to us that they'd be switching to lunch in 30 minutes and that we could stay as long as we wanted and have both breakfast and lunch choices.  Probably the only thing I wasn't thrilled with were the waffles. They looked great but were just kind of blah.  Everything else was great though.

We would come back for sure.  If you like buffets, you'll love this place.

Either the taste was wrong or the texture is weird, maybe from sitting too long and not being fresh as most of it is frozen. The chicken was chewy and the lack of spices makes you wonder if the food was expired. The food was not great at all, had no flavor and was ridiculously expensive. They really need to work on the quality of the food as opposed to the quantity. The only thing that was halfway decent was a dessert. 
I've NEVER left a bad review, I've never left a restaurant so quickly mostly I've never had the experience of such horrific dining, from walking in to the food. Not to mention the two of us ended up not feeling too well afterwards. It was our last night in Vegas, last night staying at The Rio, which was spent up in the room trying to settle our stomachs (and no, there was no alcohol involved) and will most likely be our last time visiting the establishment.",Ud2kEKH7WxVqZrGdtI_-Yg,0,0,1,-hC9KcbEzdNy1tmQFxoivg

This buffet is advertised as the largest buffet in Vegas, but it's probably by a two or three foot margin.   

We went there for lunch and snuck past the line because we were actually paying cash, instead of using a casino comp ($16.99 is cheaper than an hour at the tables)  There was a machine for fast pays that came in very handy for this.

We were sat promptly and took off for the experience.  I didn't really give our waitress a chance to greet us but I noticed that there was no silverware on the table so I inquired with a roaming chef who was very nice.  When the waitress came by, she said that she was going to bring silverware too.

Anyway,  the variety here was not that impressive at lunch.  They did have a fairly decent array of dishes though and the food was all properly prepared.   I was bummed that they didn't have whipped cream to put onto my Cookies and Cream gelato, but  I guess i would just have to do with some M&M's and a sub 1000 calorie dessert.

Service was friendly and prompt.  Overall it was pretty good.  I am eager to try the Seafood Buffet here.  I heard that it's worth every penny of the 40 bucks you pay.",UQm8Cib9mvQpxHE07sAhFA,1,1,4,dhzlr2ndTArE9-ACqne4JA

You do get a whole lot of varieties here to choose from depending on your taste buds. Most people come here for their crab legs.. it's always a hit or miss for me on that one depending on the season. Sometimes you feel like your getting your money worth because their big and meaty but sometimes your get scrawny ones that takes a lot of work to get the meat out. The Chinese section is always good, they have the most variety and quality compared to alot of other buffets in town. The sushi station was just okay some of the pieces seems a bit dried up due to the pre-prep and sitting in the fridge. There's always a good selection at the dessert station. I can do without the automated paying station... that just slows down the line. It's just too complicated for some people!

Every station overcooks the food by 15 mins. The chicken parmigiana could easily have passed for a ninja star if my knife could penetrate the meat to carve pointed sides to it. 

Everything here has no favor. Yes, they do have quite a selection... but when everything tastes like cardboard... does that even matter?

Desserts are subpar to other buffets in the city... mostly cakes and pie. 

Super long slow line. (Self help machines are never a good idea)

$25 dollar buffet with no prime rib is kind of ridiculous.

The dim sum was dried out. The Crab Legs fishy smelling and almost impossible to get any meat out of. The Tepanyaki Chicken tastes like cheap processed fake chicken breasts made from cheap chicken parts.

My out-of-town guest wanted to try the Rio's famous, World Buffet, so we went, waited in a long line, which was only about 20 minutes.  Then the elderly, ""white"", foreign-accented, hostess lead us to the right, and quite a distance away through a group of tables, then past a very loud, dirty dishwashing area only wide enough for one person to go through at a time. I made a joke that ""I thought she was going to put us in the kitchen"".  We finally reached a booth which seemed OK at first, until the line outside started to grow again, and we happened to be separated by only a half wall and a glass partition. Some inconsiderate parents placed (sat) their noisy children up on the ledge next to the glass and they were peeking over the glass. At this point I was not concerned about their safety (since the parent was holding them), but the sanitation of the brats spitting or drooling over the glass. The waiter who was very nice, and efficient took our beverage orders and we went up to the buffet lines. My friend and I went separate ways and we both got lost on our return back to our table.  I followed the dirt and noise towards the dishwashing area.  My friend had to have someone help her find her way back. The employee asked who her waitress was, and she replied that she did not know his name, but he was African-American. The guide knew exactly where she was seated. My friend mentioned how dirty the floor was getting in the dishwashing area when I noticed that she was the only ""white"" person in our area.  She said that she didn't mind the company around us, but we were both getting annoyed with the noise on the other side of the glass, as well the increasing noise and dirt coming from the dishwashing area. I mentioned to the waiter that I would like to speak to a ""white manager"" who eventually came out and I mentioned that I felt like the Rio put all ""people-of-color"" at the back of the bus, and he just said, ""you wanna move""? I mentioned that the dishwashing area was noisy and dirty, the line directly next to the tables was annoying, and the carpet was starting to look slippery with spilt and splattered food. I also mentioned that maybe they shouldn't route people this way, but he just looked at me and started to walk away. I mentioned that since he didn't seem to care I would write about this incident on the internet and he just shrugged. I feel the Rio should close the area due to the unsanitary conditions of putting people next to a ""dumpster"" and, ""shame-on-the Rio"" for placing such insensitive people in positions of making decisions. I am very proud of living here in Southern Nevada, but this was an embarrassing incident, especially with having an out-of-town visitor.  Was this my imagination, or is the Rio trying to bring segregation back?

selection is great here. if you like asian food (there are a lot of asian foreigners here in vegas) then you'll love it here. they make fresh pho and noodle soup for you. the dim sum is great, and they have fresh bbq pork and roasted duck.

Overall, good deal. Fri night  34.95. 3.5stars
 Prime rib was excellent, mad flavor, super tender, good quality fat. A little  peppery on the outer rub. Mashed potatoes were delicious. 
  Chile Verde pork was fantastic!  Could be a Lil more tender, but it definitely not tough. Frijoles were very tasty. Spanish  Rice was ok. After meal I made some Bomb nachos with the beans, green Chile pork & cheese sauce. 
  Sushi was buffet grade.
 Beef ribs were very tender, a bit too sweet with tons of sauce,  but wipe em off & they're pretty good. 
  Crab legs were just ok. 
Chinese food was generically aight, best bit of that was the dim sum, Ha gao.  Shrimp was tender & tasty. 
  try the Phø next time, looked pretty good.
Dessert-  bread pudding was amazing, best we've had. 
  Super creamy but firm, not drippy or tough. Very sweet vanilla & cinnamon  flavor with soft apples too take any edge off. Didn't care for the raisins though,  just set them aside. 
  Lemon curd tart was also excellent.  Tart but not sour, very smooth & sweet.

The desserts section was great. There was gelato, eclairs, various pies, cakes, cheesecakes, and my favorite was the bananas cooked in this rum sauce.

We came at for champagne brunch so cheers for unlimited mimosas all around! The wait staff was very prompt and friendly.

The dinner was simply amazing! They literally have everything you could think of plus more. The steak and prime rib was perfect medium and juicy. You could still taste the chunks of potatoes in the mashes potatoes. You could make your own taco/nachos in anyway you desire! The best part was probably the seafood! Countless amount of crab legs and shrimp dipped in juicy butter and pepper! AMAZING! 

Our server was on point with taking our plates and refilling our drinks. He also gave us our own bottle of hand sanitizer.

Not sure why this Vegas buffet has 3 and 1/2 stars. It is on par with hometown buffet if not worse. 
Upon entering the buffet, the decor is very simple. Nothing to say about that. My boyfriend, a few friends, and I didn't wait too long. It was probably about 15 minutes before we were able to pay and be seated. I was quite excited; reading the yelp reviews had gotten me hyped for a miso soup machine and a ready to make noodle soup section. 
After being seated, my party and I went right away to get food. We arrived back at the table, a friend said he inquired about the miso soup machine. They didn't have it, and said that they had recently remodeled the place and removed machine. Okay, a bit of a downer,  but I still kept my optimism up. I began cutting into the first thing on my plate - prime rib. Tough to cut into, and putting it into my mouth, rather dry. Next were some ribs, dry as a bone, once again. The mashed potatoes, I was glad to notice, were okay.  Next were some garlic shrimp, which were bland. Generally, my party and I kept mentioning how the food was either absolutely disgusting or okay, the disgusting outweighing the okay. 
The only good parts of this entire experience was probably the waitress. She was nice, and refilled my drink when necessary. Oh, and the pork belly. Try it if you have nowhere to eat but this shitty buffet. Not coming again.",2co46icsStfW5x-XKkOz3Q,0,0,1,GNPpKxJbLydJMaEaWjpZxw

They observe how the food is moving out and frequently will tidy or beautify a steam table to keep things attractive.
The duck is the best I have had since my late night Peking duck runs to Chinatown while at college thirty-odd years ago.
The crab was very good, not as ""saline"" and watery as many buffets provide. The hot butter was clarified, and yes, it WAS butter, not margarine or some other edible oil gloop....
Great mashed squash, like Great Aunt Edna would make at Thanksgiving dinners.
The turkey was excellent with a subtle spicing in the rub and the gravy. 
The fried clams were meaty and not at all greasy or heavily battered.
The spicy shrimp were alittle bland for me, but buffets are not for the spice lover in any case.
The braised pork chops had quite a few fans at our table as well as the prime rib. I quite loved the Lo Mein and the Black Pepper Chicken.
Nice stir fry station.
The gelato selection is nice and very tasty...no freezer burned ice cream here!
I had the most delicious cherries jubilee with big plump black cherries and caramelly bananas foster and a heavenly Mexican flan (creme caramel, same difference). The rice pudding with coconut and dried fruit was interesting and flavourful but put a couple of people off who were looking for diner-style rice pudding...boring.
The non alcoholic drink service is quick and refills come without asking. The alcohol service is odd...you have to go to the bar and pay first before they will deliver it to your table. I guess they have had too many people ""drink and dash"" in the past.
There are some foods that you should stay away from at a buffet: pizza, burgers, steak, as they foods are not great to have just sitting under the heat lamp/steamer table...ick...
The Rio has a distinct odor of strong, nasty cigarette smoke EVERYWHERE that was not there three years ago...they really need a new air-filtration system and an overall cleaning/repainting to get rid of the stench. While it is less oppressive in the Buffet area, it is still apparent, as people are allowed to smoke in the seating sections so you can't really get away from it. Vegas should seriously think of having no smoking restrictions in restaurants and designated areas for non smoking gamblers to enjoy while throwing away more money. I left right after dinner because of the smell and the heat. Pity, I went elsewhere to enjoy after dinner drinks and a quick little gamble.

This week, that meant the Rio Carnival World as it was suggested alongside Caesars and Bellagio.  The good thing is we paid two dollars at a half off tickets place and paid just that, half off.  The buffet selection is altogether longer than a football field.  This means you will have some great things and some items that needs improvement, but all the food was mostly great.  I sampled nearly everything.  The prime rib and mashed potatoes were the best, and the orange chicken was the worst of the main dishes.  The best advice I can give is to save room for dessert!

The dessert here is large and delicious.  The cannolis are the best I have ever had.  The red velvet cake was ridiculously moist and delicious.  The best part was probably the Gelato.  It looked beautiful and was themed appropriately for the season.  I went back several times for the cookies and cream version.  

Besides the food, the venue was great as well.  I do wish that the dish washing station was in the back and not near the patrons, as the scent was overbearing when walking by, but our waitress really made up for it.  She was very nice about keeping our table clean, kept our cups full at all times, and we decided to leave a $20 tip for her efforts.

You have to go through the security dept to do that and fill out forms.  We just wanted our money back, but have to wait at least a week.

Unfortunately, at least 2 in our party ended up with food poisoning last night.  The forms you must fill out exonerates the buffet from any responsibility.  They hold those forms over your head - no signed forms, no money back.

There was a section with tacos where the meat looked awful and dried out as well, so I didn't even bother. The soup selections in the Asian section were ok and probably the only thing I thought worth eating much. The gelato in the dessert area was good, but all the other desserts were lacking. I didn't find this buffet any better than your average Golden Corral. 

On top of the mediocre food, the service was pretty awful. The hostess sat us at a table that was in an awkward area and the bench had food stuck to it. The waitress wasn't polite or friendly, she mainly seemed irritated she had to be at work.

If you go you have to try the noodle station, that was my favorite. Incredibly tasty sauteed noodles. 
They have gelato for deserts and their signature item was: 

Banana Foster. WOW This Banana Foster is what will make you want to go back the next day. DO NOT SKIP IT. It's that good, buttery with a creamy rum sauce. It was heavenly

We got there before the dinner rush and I think the food doesn't turn fast enough.  Some things dried out and others sort of withered.  The more popular stations seemed to be in good shape, but in disarray.  It almost appeared as if they were replacing some of the food items and didn't put them back in the right order.  Sometimes there was no rhyme or reason.  

The prime rib was RARE and my kids could not eat it, even after looking forward to a big slab of meat (they are carnivores).  Overall they were happy and left with a full belly.

1149410,2011-07-15,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"2nd time: I've always thought of Carnival World Buffet as the big brother of the buffets at Rio, upstaged by the Seafood Buffet.

Carnival World Buffet tries to be what it sounds like, a buffet with foods from all over the world.  The selection is huge, and the spans from one end of the restaurant to the other.

As with any buffet, there's a carving station.  Prime rib isn't bad but the other proteins were... meh.  Seafood selection is the typical as well.  Crab legs, cocktail shrimp, fried seafood etc.  I do think I'm a little spoiled by the buffets at the higher end hotels though, since the crab legs were already but in half for you :P  But of course, the selection for seafood can't be compared to the other buffet at Rio.  

Mexican food is... alright.  Looked like what my high school would serve.  The churro was a surprise though.  I was lucky enough to get some right when it came out so it was crispy and you really can't beat a fresh churro.

For some reason, I actually sorta liked the Asian food section... maybe cause that whole weekend I was eating Western food.  So it was nice to have a little change.

The best part about the desserts is definitely the rotating gelato display.  You go up, tell the server what you want, and he'll press a button so the machine will spin towards the right flavor.  Pretty cool.  I think I stood there for like 5 minutes watching him do that.  Probably thought I was a weirdo haha.

Carnival is perfect if you want a lot of choices and variety.  The selection is truly the best part about this buffet and I definitely wouldn't mind coming back.  The price is reasonable and the service here is great.  But if you are used to buffets at the Wynn or Bellagio, then this place might seem a little too average!",LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,2,1,3,n8W0vSPIxjr6BGjNu6_N0Q

It's huge with food from different parts of the world including: Asian (with a Mongolian barbecue station), the U.S., with heavy focus on down-home Southern goodness. Don't miss the mashed red potatoes - I had three helpings!  Italian, Mexican as well as breads, salads, pizza, seafood (snow crab, cold shrimp, fried shrimp, fried fish and baked fish) with drawn butter and cocktail sauce, and a carving station with pork roast, roast beef, prime rib, turkey and ham. I camped out on the prime rib - it is deliciously seasoned and they have little cups for au jus. 

Enough about the food. Let's get to the real point: dessert. These people know their way around sweets! They have at least 10 varieties of gelato in every flavor imaginable, apple and raisin bread pudding with vanilla sauce (I'm a bread pudding lover, and as anyone who eats it knows, it's not always made well - the Rio has it on point), little cakes, tiny pies, eclairs, cheesecake in a chocolate shell, custards and cookies... even sugar-free items. 

If you heed nothing else I write, you must believe me on this: get a cup of their (very good) coffee, a plate of bread pudding and some of their bananas foster (fresh bananas in a warm bath of butter, sugar, spices and rum) and forget everything else you ate. Take a forkful of the bread pudding with a piece of banana and make sure you put as much of the rum sauce as will stay on the bite, close your eyes, thank your maker for taste buds and enjoy.

I have always enjoyed the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio Hotel. I remember when they used to offer a $5 off coupon for their lunch or dinner in one of those many Las Vegas magazines you would find in your hotel or along the strip. But alas, haven't seen those darn coupons in the last 10 or so years (sad face). Anyways, I have always really enjoyed their dessert station/ area the most of this buffet. The creamy gelato choices they offer here are deliciously perfectly sweetened and taste just as the flavor they are named after. They are incredibly refreshing and worth just coming here just for that. 

My husband always loves to come to this buffet for the crab legs (they only serve them during dinner time). Not every buffet on the strip serves crab legs, which makes him disappointed (sad face again). But anyways, the last time we came by here (last Tuesday), my husband was quite disappointed with their 1st batch of crab legs. As soon as he put his plate on our table, I noticed the off putting smell. Crab legs fresh and not overcooked should never have a strong smell. My husband lost his appetite and felt a bit sick even before really eating them. Later on he tried another batch and they were fine (no smell) but he was grossed out by the 1st batch that he just didn't enjoy the 2nd batch like he normally would (thus lowering my overall rating). 

Of course this is a buffet, so they do offer other food options as well, including pho, sushi, Chinese food (including Peking duck and char siu), Mexican food, etc. But that is pretty much just standard to me (again, I am a bit fan of sweets!). 

Service can be really great here but sometimes it can be pretty much lack of as well, depending on who is your server. 

Food overall is good (just with the exception with our most recent visit.. just couldn't bring myself to lower the rating because of the many previous of times we have dined here and really enjoyed ourselves) and is a pretty affordable buffet. By the way, lunch is about $25 per person. I believe dinner is ~$30-$35 per person.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,2,0,3,9rMtWhOkd__1ZkvA4nOgRg

I's amazing how much gluttony takes place when presented with an endless supply of fried, creamed, and broiled, options for $23.
I have to admit, over the years, the Rio buffet has gone down in quality, but overall I still think this is the best buffet on the Vegas strip.  It's the variety that I like.  
The sushi is terrible, but they do a pretty good job with American cuisine and their Asian noodle bar is awesome.  

Best part (worst part for my thighs) the dessert area!
I love the cannolis!  I used to love the gelato too, but even this has gone down in quality.  I had some icy chunks in my gelato, and I tried like 5 different flavors.  They need to make an insulin flavored one for people like me.

Still top on my list, I just hope they get their act together on the gelato. =p",qIECCqeEZQXre0mYvZU_pA,10,12,4,LRQK1ILrfTnnkF6NVdsbZA

One of the best buffets in Vegas. 
They're nice enough to locals to give you half off if you show your Nevada ID.
LOTS of variety.
Not as tacky as it once was.

Cons:
Very long wait in line, and sometimes it's a longer wait to be seated than it is to pay for your meal.
Used to be better(but it's still very good so that's not saying a whole lot).
Service can be iffy.

They have everything from calamari to clam strips, pizza to samosas, gumbo to sushi. It's a shame your stomach can only hold so much. I swear my stomach is getting smaller because last time I went I was pretty much full after 2 plates, and I mostly ate small finger foods/appetizers. A good idea would be to sneak some containers into your bag so you can take some stuff to go.........but you didn't hear that from me. XD.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,1,1,4,XZVrhGPq99FA91KGCmWgjw
1238853,2012-09-02,2,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"Tons of options, but the quality is suspect.  When it comes to food, quality over quantity is my mantra, but at buffets, it's hard to stick to your guns.  There are hundreds of food options during dinner, and it'll take several rounds before you're able to get through everything that's offered.

The crab legs were snow crab, not king crab, so that means less meat.  The shrimp cocktail and popcorn shrimp were good though.  The dessert bar was a joke, not even the gelato could change that.

The asian food was pretty good though.  I found myself going to that section more often than any other section.  You can't go wrong with deep fried pork belly, chicken curry, and stir-fried vegetables.

I always skip on potatoes, bread, and rice at buffets.  They are needless fillers and take away from future opportunities to try things like medium rare roast beef or that extra plate of crab legs.

The buffet at M Resort is still my favorite...",4u8zZaT5m7nO1WazdKA2sw,2,2,3,wXYKGK_ViU-VlGbkEtlG_Q

   The weekend brunch is $25 per person and you get 'champagne' (sparkling wine) if you ask. We did and we asked for a side of oj to make our own mimosas (you can get get mimosas but we wanted to DIY). We both liked the fact that you could pay an automated machine to get into the buffet which is some times easier than dealing with bored staff. We got in, sat down, ordered our drinks and checked out the offerings. 
   Boy, did they have a lot! The basics for breakfast were there and then  more! Smoked salmon for bagels, pastries beyond compare! Mexican bar with raspberry filled or caramel filled churros! A seafood bar with crab legs, shrimp and different pastas with seafood! Pork loin roast! Prime rib! Ham! Corn dogs for the little guys! J said that the sushi was also fresh and good.
   It was a clean environment and we didn't feel like we were being rushed. At one point, they had a 20 minute drink special where you could get any mixed drink for $4.

This place has one of the largest range of foods that I have ever seen.

Each section has been divided and themed as an ethnic cuisine group. e.g. Chinese, Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian and the list goes on.

I like to get freshly stir fried meats here, which the chef cooks for you on the spot. You can get chicken, shrimp etc and it is similar to Mongolian bbq where they cook it up on a large hot plate.

Too many with coupons, comp meals, etc. holding up the line as the cashiers can only let 15-20 of these people through before the line stops. So no one else can pay, enter, etc and just stand there. Once you pay (different line per pay method), you pull up to a circus of 5 lines and the host/ess pull people from each line as they see fit. While we waited to be seated, the line was so long that many paid $5 for express, immediate seating. That line went out the door. They do not seat as efficiently either as they normally sit 6-8 tables in a general area at the same time.

Ok, now to the food:

Prime rib - AWESOME! Cooked medium rare/rare like it should be cooked. If you want it cooked more, special request it. Beef ribs were good too. Very tender beef that the meat almost fell off the bone.

Taco bar was a good Mexican change that we had not seen at other buffets up to this point.

Pork tamale was ok at best. Just eat the pork as the flour/contents tasted like it had been overcooked and starting to go bad.

Crab legs were cold but were good quality and enjoyable.

DESSERT - Peach cobbler was a little too bread on top but otherwise it is very good. The gelato ice cream was just icing on the cake with the peach cobbler.

I was such a chunky monkey that day. I tried at least 9 different desserts. Wait let me rephrase that. I did a taste test on all 9. My favs were red velvet cake, creme brulee, flan, carrot cake & coconut gelato. My least favorite was cream puffs, white cake, cookies and brownies.. 

The service was decent. Our first server was an older lady in her 60's who kept forgetting to bring us our drinks, but we let it pass. I don't know what happened to her but we got a new server. He was pretty nice and attentive to our needs. It got pretty busy so Instead of waiting for our server to come I asked another person who worked there for a fork. She was wearing the same outfit and had her name badge. She gives me a retarded look and said Fork? Ummm.. yes a fork. She was Filipino like myself so I thought do I speak to this retard in my language? Anyways, I repeated myself in English and said Yes a fork. She says I don't know and I'll be back.

The meat selection is kept inside and you get to choose from beef, chicken, and shrimp. The beef is not the thin, brisket slices, you would normally see in Mongolian BBQ places. It is think like beef and broccoli thick. They cuts were really good and I didn't have any unpleasant fatty or chewy instances during my meal. 
Now the best part for me was the desert. Limited, but they have a gelato section where an attendant scoops up little cups of yummy ice cream. I tried the tiramisu and liked it. They also have these little cups of cheesecake which were really good. The best thing from the entire desert section and I sampled a lot of it. When we went back for dinner I just had one of those. Okay buffet overall, I would definitely recommend the locals to go. 50% off is a great deal. 

Oh before I forget. During lunch they have a wristband you can purchase for $7.77 for unlimited drinks. This includes beer, margaritas, and I believe well drinks. Just the margaritas were worth and the bartender also hooked me up with a pina colada on my 4th round. WIN!",h-yMohvv5EUcp-VvOQdeEg,0,0,3,CnmcHBMT8QtG94XYXHkTUw

I've been to Vegas buffets before, but this was definitely the biggest I have ever been too.  We came for Sunday brunch, and it wasn't very full, but it took a long time to get in.  Why?  Because they have these stupid machines you have to get through that are very picky about the bills they accept, and the guy in front of us didn't seem to have a credit card.  Also, it being Sunday, for some reason their price was $24.00 all day, which is way too much. 

I think I did a good job trying out all of their fare.  I got sushi, some fried stuff, some prime rib, some tacos, some crab, some stir fry, and... well whatever else they had.  The food was ok... some pretty good quality and some (like the sushi) definitely of a lower quality, but by far my favorite was the dessert.  They had some delicious gelato flavors, with some great little mini-cakes and pies.

I wish it had tasted as good as it looked. We weren't expecting anything amazing and knew that the food itself would be average buffet quality and not top grade, but this seemed to be way below that.

RIO CARNIVAL BREAKFAST 
[THE GOOD]
- Cheese quesadillas (topped with guacomole & pico de gallo)
- Caramel-filled churros
- Corn beef hash

[THE BAD]
- Turkey sausage (tasted like chemicals)
- Eclair (smelled like feet)
- Bacon (I understand that bacon is fatty and greasy, but these were soaking in grease)
- Scrambled eggs (dry and browning from being overcooked)
- Apple juice (served to me WARM, gross)
- Orange juice (served to my other half WARM)
- Ribs (super dry, meat tasted old and had that strong boar tainted taste. Again, very poor quality)

[THE UGLY]
We had a stomach ache for the rest of the day. It felt like a huge rock was in our bellies. We went to the Wynn buffet later that week and ate just as much, if not more, and felt perfectly fine after. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE QUALITY PEOPLE!

This is the way to my heart! The crab. Oh the endless crab!!  My best friend and I ate crab, cake and margaritas for 4 hrs! 

The waitstaff was annoyed for sure, but we didn't care. We paid so we ate.  I will walk miles to sit and eat there. Which we did. We walked the backroads at least 3 miles. The desserts are amazing! So many to choose from. They are petite so you can eat a bunch of different ones. 

Then after being able to stuff your face, there is no better way to end the night at Chippendales.

1470292,2009-12-28,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"Pass! Pass! Pass! If you don't read the entire review (aka my rant), just take this piece of advice and never come here.

The first red flag is that this buffet is in the Rio which is off the strip. In my case, I had to get in my car and take a special trip to eat here since I was not staying at the Rio. Against my better judgment of not selecting one of the many great restaurants or buffets on the strip, I did end up driving here.

The second red flag is the Rio is getting to be a pretty sad looking hotel now. It was an f'in ghost town in the casino at like 6pm. The only time anyone is gambling in this hotel is when they have a special event like the WSOP. It's just dying...

The third red flag is there are more people at the buffet and all other parts of the casino combined. The buffet was freaking packed. Just sad to see the Rio reduced to this. I should have bailed on this place... sigh.

I so wanted this place to be good. Reading all these yelp reviews and the whole concept of the buffet of having different types of foods, it really did sound appealing. Thats about it for the high points. It all goes downhill from here.

So I am waiting in line to pay for my entrance fee. Its a sad view of people attempting to figure out the automated kiosk to pay. It can be a huge drag to watch people just failing at trying to figure the crap out. Its like watching the clueless people trying to figure out the self serve check out at the grocery store. You know what I am talking about. I want to slit my throat waiting for these feeble-minded people to figure it out.

So we get in and get seated after about 30-45 minutes. I grab a plate to try all the different foods they have to offer. Grabbed a little bit of Chinese food in the way of chicken chow fun, BBQ pork, egg rolls, and dumplings. The chow fun was way over cooked to the point where the noodles were too soft and falling apart, the BBQ pork was decent but the ones at Panda Express are better which is sad, the egg rolls were too greasy and dry, and dumplings had very little flavor.

On that failed attempt, I grabbed some Mexican food because its tough to screw up beans, chicken, rice and a tortilla.... until I came here. Beans tasted like they came out of a can and rice was like some kind of instant rice. I grabbed a beef tamale as well. That was an epic fail if I have ever seen one. I know why they provided the corn husk now. So you can grab both ends to ring the freaking oil collecting inside the tamale. Once I opened that sh*t up, the beef is dry as hell.

Finally grabbed some crab legs and a cut of prime rib. Crab legs were mediocre at best and the prime rib pretty much getting a steak at Chilis.

I had planned on trying as much as I could and paced myself in the beginning by getting a little of each. I could have eaten a lot more, but to be honest, the food was just food to fill you up and it didn't have any flavor behind it. I was freaking hungry for dinner and I could and would have eaten more food just as long as it wasn't this food. Should have gone anywhere else.",cTf5rrUd253mkJtUW0DYKQ,8,2,1,naKKsfPPCUzZcQr_t3FKIw

One thing I am surprised though, is that amount of meat they give you.  I had steak & shrimp and it's WAY more than I would have expected (or needed) in a buffet.  The crab legs were quite good, the sushi was not horrible and the taco bar was great.  I tried a little bit of almost everything, and there wasn't really anything I didn't like.

1494167,2012-07-28,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"We were not impressed with the dinner buffet at the Rio.  The buffet offered tons of choices, I don't think we tried even a fourth of what was available, but  none were dishes worth going for a second helping.  The only exception to that was the steak with mushroom sauce.  It was thin, but tender and had a great beef flavor.  

My daughters were not impressed with any of the child friendly items and ended up eating a lot of shrimp.  Hey, they have protein, but not worth the price of admission.  The crab legs, which they've enjoyed in the past, were very small and not worth the trouble of eating.

I can't quite remember what I tried (which tells you something).  I know the prime rib was OK while the chicken parmigiana tasted like chicken nuggets (yuck!).  The pork ribs were tough, the beef ribs were better and had a nice BBQ sauce.    I can't remember anything else.

The desserts we tried, OTOH, were uniformly good.  The kids loved the gelato, and I enjoyed the cheesecake and flan (though dig in for the caramel as otherwise it's not sweet enough).  The one disappointment were the eclairs, as tends to be the case in most buffets.

In all, I wouldn't go back to this buffet.  In particular given the wait - 45 minutes on a Tuesday night in July.   People who are paying full price (not using coupons or the Buffet of Buffets deal) do get in much faster as they have an express line for them.",tUShFCNl4Mb2-kJ5J__w0Q,0,0,3,o6d6sYGg_KM1MZz92MQblQ

Pizza is from scratch & tastes like pizza (which many places have a hard time doing). The whole line looks clean & well taken care of.

The service was great. Wait staff was attentive but not overbearing.

With the food selection, I would hope to have a higher quality of taste. There really wasn't too much that stood out as ""Man, I have to have more of this!"" The clam strips & fried haddock were solid choices. 
 
The meatloaf & salisbury steak had a freezer-burnish kind of taste to me.

Pasta section also did not have anything too enticing on there. 

I would like to see a bit more of a fruit selection. Watermelon & cantaloupe get kinda boring. Even fresh pineapple would have been a step up.

Desserts... gelato bar selection had some intriguing choice with Orange Dreamsicle & tiramisu. Did not see any toppings to add on. Also, there were some pies to select from, and some cannolis. I was hoping for some carrot or cheesecake. Neither were there.

Seemed to be around $26-$28 per head for dinner - my boss paid. 

Impressions:

The place is MASSIVE, clean and well lit.

The Automated cashier (computer screen) takes a fair amount of time to traverse.

The King Crab legs were good. Plenty of them as well.  Literally a wall one foot high and about 3 foot wide. 

Excellent fried clams (and I am a native New Englander).

The ""sushi"" was pretty good too. They had spicy tuna rolls and California rolls and both were very credible.

Chinese dumplings were great. They had boneless pork sparerib pieces (good) - but the Chinese (Peking style?) duck that others raved about was not very good... Kind of rubbery with a funky *way* over salted/metallic taste. (They looked gorgeous coming out of the roaster though).

I really liked their Mexican entrees (some kind of pulled pork nachos) and they had a giant bowl of pretty good guacamole. 

Desserts looked good. I had a small chocolate ""cup"" with a creamy white filling and fresh berries on top. Good fruit, not overly great chocolate.

Recommendation: They were cooking steaks (looked like a small strip or rib-eye?) to order at dinner time. They looked decent. Have an appetizer, then have a steak, they troll the rest of the food lines.",1BQJ5UaK9cf1V3__JwSO_Q,0,0,3,Wgg4Rmuhbxzp7lQXdtQp8A

The selection is broad, and I like how there's an antipasto area at the farthest left station, which was pretty unpopular -- more for me! Also unpopular was the sushi station, but I think that was because it was a NASCAR weekend, and it was a little too exotic for the guys who's radicalism is just about limited to letting Danika Patrick behind the wheel. Most of these guys would just walk by puzzled, but I digress. Dessert was only so-so, and the setup harbored a permanent line for the gelato.

Anyhow, minus two stars for the hold up at the self-payment kiosks. There are no credit card stickers, and absolutely no indication they do not accept American Express. I almost got jumped by some big broad from Texas with a Kate Gosselin butch haircut for holding up the line.

The good thing about this place is that they have a WIDE variety of food and plenty of it. They have some Mexican, Chinese, American, Italian, and so much more! I was impressed that they served gelato instead of the usual soft serve that you normally get at a buffet. 

Now here comes the bummer part...the quality! Yes, you can eat up a storm and have so many choices to choose from. But the quality of the food itself isn't the greatest. Some of the foods were dry, flavorless, and just eh. 

So you can come here for the variety and the pure enjoyment of eating as much as you can. But if you want quality food, you should head somewhere else where you can pay the same amount but the food will taste 10 times better.",ShE-cXiI7VwJ8GMixw6JOw,2,2,2,obnBgeUkyzSKJXSQ3E4iDw

I took only a small sampling of just about everything that was meat or fish and one trip to the buffet was all I could handle. 

I did get a slab of Prime Rib, which I could cut with my fork, and a couple of crab legs. Both were very good although the crab legs were bit overcooked, but that is so common to happen I won't knock the rating for it. The breaded scallops were awesome and the beef ribs were pretty good too. They were the type of BBQ ribs that are typically drier than the ""fall off the bone ribs"" I really like, but they were still good. The only two items I didn't care for were the chicken wings and fried fish. 

The deserts were okay, but by the time you have sampled all the foods and gone back for the stuff you liked, you won't be eating much desert any ways, so don't worry about it.

The one thing I didn't get, but looked amazing, was the 1/2 gallon maragrita.  Okay, I don't know the exact size, but I did see one lady have to use two hands to carry it.

He was gone so long that we filled the adjacent table and the top of the pony wall with plates.  It wasn't that we were piggish, there were 9 of us.  When he came back his attitude was a little nasty and he ended up spilling the remaining contents of a plate on the seat where my nieces husband had been sitting.

Pros:
-This buffet has a huge variety of food. It is comparable to the size of the Bacchanal Buffet, which is my favorite buffet in Vegas. 
-The asian food is excellent! If that is what you like, then I highly recommend this place. My husband and father-in-law have also commented that this buffet has the best duck they have ever tasted. They both work in the food industry, so that speaks volumes to me and I know I have to try it if we ever make it back here.
-The gelato is also very delicious. There's lots of flavors to choose from and they're all good. 
-Service was awesome. Our server was quick to refill our water. She also offered us extra napkins and even gave my hubby empty plates for his crab shells. That was unexpected, but very kind.
-It was relatively empty upon our arrival. We came at opening time for dinner (3pm) and there was no line whatsoever. We actually thought they were closed. Haha. 
-We got a discount for being local. Sweet.

Cons:
-The price was still a lot, but I guess it's to be expected because they serve seafood everyday.
-The main reason I knocked a whole 2 stars off of my rating was the quality of some of the food. For example, the mac and cheese had no flavor and it was slimy and just plain out gross. Also, they have the weirdest cheesecake I've ever tried. The base is made out of sponge cake which gives it a weird texture and the cheesecake is also flavorless. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. Just a lot of the food was lacking flavor. :/

According to my BF this buffet is better than a Hometown....but when we left he said the quality went down. Way down....

There are several areas which serve Asian, Mexican, etc. food.

The pho was pretty lame. The meat was not even close to what it is supposed to be like and the guy served me flat noodles! Yes flat noodles for pho!?!?!?!?! The broth was ridiculously mediocre. The dim sum was dry around the edges. The Chinese Broccoli was too salty....

The fried rice was OK. The BBQ pork was OK. I did like the seaweed salad which I added some tofu to.

The Mexican style rice was good but not authentic. The cilantro sauce tilapia was the only - I repeat - ONLY good thing I ate there that day!

The steak my boyfriend ate was not too bad either.

The BBQ pork ribs were cooked well but the BBQ sauce was just a sweet flavorless sauce.

The dessert section was the best thing. However, the pies are placed on small individual plates. It would be better if you could use a spatula and serve as many slices as you want onto a large plate - especially since they are tiny! The cherry pie is good but the crust was poor. The ice cream was mediocre.

I will never go to another buffet in my life if I can avoid it. If Vegas buffets are supposed to be so great it frightens me to think of any other buffet out there.

Flash forward some 20 years later, and we're visiting a friend from Vegas who can't wait to take my girlfriend and I to this place. SURE! I sez.

What I found was that the Rio buffet was like every other buffet I've ever been at in my life. There's a lot of food, but there's a lot of mediocre food. There's an Asian section that tastes like every take-out place you've ever had, with greasy duck, glaze-saturated pork, dry satay chicken skewers, and sushi with tough seaweed. There's a meat section with cut sirloin steak with absolutely inedible gristle adding annoyance, not flavor. There's a seafood station, which beyond the unlimited crab legs, is filled with fried foods, not fresh foods.

A few positives: great pie, good ham, half-decent Chinese siu mai.

We got in for about half the usual price ($16 as opposed to somewhere in the neighborhood of $32). Even at fire-sale prices, it still wasn't enough to get me to go back. Maybe this was a three-star place, but after hearing so many people in my life talk up the magic and wizardry of Vegas buffets, I was left especially disappointed.

So, here's my advice: is a buffet a personal challenge to you to stuff your face with four plates of food, or do you want to just have a decent dinner? I'm the second kind of person, so next time I'd recommend to do as I do, and put that $30 towards one of the many, many, many exceptional restaurants on the strip that are competing on the basis of quality, not quantity.

Pretty much, whatever food you would get at a typical buffet, they have it here.  Food was above average overall but not the best I've had.

I lowered another star mainly because of their efficiency.  We waited 45 minutes to get in but the first thing I noticed was that this place was only about 60% full with a lot of empty tables.  Granted though, I never had to wait at any station to get food when I wanted something but they could have easily accommodated everyone waiting.  Probably a huge short of staff that night.",2oZEuBYhqekiyTk9P7Ikyg,0,0,3,D29I2uhyxx_1wnA2dJB9MQ

It looks new and is designed well. There is a friendly staff to make your dining experience its best. The options in this buffet were immense. They have 11 separate buffet areas. I wish I had room to make my own stir fry, but I was too full from the 3 buffets I had within the 24 hours prior to this one to finish off my Buffet of Buffets. 
I started with a salad because I had been eating too heavy lately. They had a multitude of green options (iceberg, romaine, spring mix and spinach), and a decent array of toppings and dressings. Everything looked fresh. I also had a cup of the chicken noodle soup, which was flavorful and hearty.
I had a plate of snow crab legs, and the server noticed quickly and brought me a tool to get into the legs with. They were cooked right and had a good flavor to them. Their lasagna was wonderful. It was the right amount of gooey cheese, a perfect amount of  sauce and a balanced amount of meat. Utterly delicious. 
One of the only downsides to this restaurant is that nothing was labelled. You had to guess what everything was. Even if things are changing and rotating, there should still be a label.
The dessert bar had a large number of options for gelato/sorbets, and pies. I was too full for a pie (although, the cherry pie was calling my name), but I got the orange cream sherbert (I'm half guessing on the type of ice cream). It reminded me of the flavor of a Push-Up ice cream. Creamy and light, it was the perfect end to my meal.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone else. It was worth it to be a part of the Buffet of Buffets pass. I saw that this is $33 per person to enter without the pass. I would recommend the Bellagio over this one, if I were paying outright, but it's good for the deal.",fVFaQ2sNYhbYyGS2bXGX3g,0,1,4,Ieiams0a-B3x7QWS_STLog

1739461,2010-11-27,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"OMG!!!!  This was the WORST buffet I have been to for a long time.  I'm sorry to say, but my friend, her daughter and another friend and I just took our Thanksgivng vacation at Las Vegas this past week.  We decided to go big on a buffet, and THIS buffet WAS a mistake!!!!  

First of all, PRICING was way off, and they should HAVE announced that on the website.  We were all expecting to pay only $16.99 as that was a lunch buffet we were going for.  I checked the webpage b4 deciding to go, and my friend called the buffet number to check the pricing.....same thing, $16.99.  But noooooooo, when we arrived, it became holiday brunch which was more expensive by another $8.  Geeeeesh!!!  I'm not exaggerating.....what was WORSE was that we are experts in Chinese food....some chef did NOT know how to cook orange chicken properly.  It was incomparable to Panda Expresses' orange chicken....we brought two teeangers with us----they know their Asian food, and the chef didn't cook fried rice that well either.  They warned me NOT to try either, so I didn't even bother getting them.

The only good things going on were the prime ribs and coffee~Their coffee was not bad, but service was just ok.....and I have another really bad experience....after my friend had a bad experience with the orange chicken, that sort of ruined her appetite some more.  She decided to give dessert a try....somebody didn't know how to bake brownies right.  LOL, she was chopping the brownie apart and telling me to feel how hard the texture was on the brownie~

I'm not making any of these up because we were just there today on our last day of vacataion....RIO buffet was the worst plan of all our plans.....I'm writing to see if we can get some $$ back because it was such a rip-off......geeeesh~

Fortunately, I took some of the better selection of food, but still----the Asian portion was off, and watch this:

When I went for dessert, whoever was arranging the dessert name tags misplaced ""Cheesecake"" for ""pumpkin pie cake"".....when I tasted it, it was pumpkin pie and not cheesecake, so I was thinking the tag for that dessert name was misplaced.  It didn't taste THAT bad but still------a misplaced dessert name tag.....

I was told I missed bringing up one point (from a friend's family member)----one of the teenagers we brought with us loved ice cream.  When she asked for Vanilla ice cream, she got Cookies and Cream instead.....What was this with servers who did NOT know how to listen to a customer's order right??

Before we got seated, one of the hosts heard my response wrong about the number of people in our group even!!!!  Sheeeesh.....None of us left ANY tip when we left the buffet.  Seriously, when the host asked me how many people were in my group, I answered ""Four"" while holding up EXACTLY 4 fingers from my right hand.....and he was holding back on seating us because there was not a table for four available but for five!!!!  What a retard!!!!  Geeeesh~Siiiiigh....they have lost 4 customers from this visit we made~Had they not lied about pricing, we wouldn't have been this mad or upset!!!!!!

I'm not nearly done venting....can anyone feel my frustration?",JpuXPE2X058wyxaGFsd0Ug,0,0,1,1yI9L2Z7QAiKk3xsXe6JnQ

My mom's been raving about this buffet for years, so even though we're not so into buffet gluttony, we decided to check it out for ourselves for Sunday Brunch.

Aside from its large selection - with food stations from every major type of ethnic food choice - didn't think it warranted the $38 price tag. And, who do they think they're kidding asking if you'll put a 15% or 20% tip on your credit card before you even eaten your meal and before you've seen what kind of service you'll be getting???  

Since when do you tip so generously when you see a waitress only once to bring you coffee, tea, water or a soft drink at the start of your meal - and you bring the meal to the table yourself ? (fyi - you need to purchase your own alcohol - it's another station near the center of the buffet).  We'd have been better off giving a $5 directly to our bus boy who visited the table more frequently to clean away empty plates.

The ambience and service leaves much to be desire - and so - quite frankly - did the taste of the food. Guess I shouldn't have gone in with such high expectations - it is just a buffet, for god's sake. I'd probably given it another star if it had a $19.95 price tag, that would have been more fitting for what we got. But even with that, we can check this one off the list; don't think we'll be going back.",NwAnNtza5hZyAaAhO9CvnQ,1,0,2,k8lg1nBMICV52V-JhfBa0w

The buffet is huge - but nothing really stood out.  They have all the usual expected buffet fair - which is good.  There's just so much stuff that I was honestly overwhelmed.  Even if you just took one small sample of everything - it's too much (for me).  Top it off at the meat section where you can select a mouthwatering steak and they cook it to your liking right there.

I try and spend at least 4 or 5 days there each time, otherwise it goes by too fast.  When you spend that long there, you get to eat a lot.  I've tried almost every buffet there is, and Rio is a good one.

During our trip, we went to Spice Market Buffet (at Planet Hollywood), The M Buffet (at the M Resort), and the Carnival World Buffet (this one at Rio).

This one was easily the best, which surprised me because everyone raved about the Spice Market (which we hated).  The Rio buffet is massive.  It has everything you can think of, and it tastes good.  The pizza was way better than at the other buffets (it had considerably more grease, but grease = taste!), and I especially loved the red velevet cake bites for dessert, as well as the gelato bar.

They also have a meat carving station. I love when a man presents roast mounds of animal carcass to me and shaves it off onto my plate.  I mean? I think it must be that subliminal caveman sense we all still have in us.

They have a bar there but you have to pay. Needless to say it was empty because after paying 40 dollars to eat you don't want to drop dollars on a cocktail.

They have a gelato bar!!!!!!!!! This alone was almost worth my 40 dollars. And there were 12 flavors of gelato. Coffee is the best...

Tix4Tonight offered the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio for $12.95, which is over 50% off the regular price for the dinner service.  We went ahead and made plans for the dinner buffet and headed to the Rio.

The buffet wasn't too difficult to find within the Rio Resort and a steady line greeted us.  I neglected to remember that most buffets have long lines of customers waiting to get in, but luckily we only waited about 30-45 minutes on this particular Saturday night.  Once reaching the register, we paid the price as promised by Tix4Tonight.  The price seemed like a bargain, especially for a Las Vegas buffet.

A hostess walked us over to our table and let us loose on their food offerings.  I eye fucked their selection and browsed before going wild on their food.  The buffet name does its justice as the selection has everything you might imagine including:  Asian, Mexican, American, Italian, and Seafood.  I made the mistake of mixing all kinds of food, which didn't agree with my stomach.  Nevertheless, the food selection was impressive and looked great.

I went ahead and tried their Italian selection first and the pasta was good, but not great.  The pasta seemed overcooked and the sauce was lacking flavor.  Next up, I tried the Mexican and had some fajitas, rice and beans, tamales, and tortillas.  The Mexican was average, yet much better than the Italian.  The fajitas had a great flavor and were nicely tendered and were nicely paired with the grilled onions and tortillas.  I wanted to try a few more things before giving up.  I went ahead and tried their BBQ ribs and was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful and tasteful they were.

Although my dress shirt buttons were on the verge of popping, I went ahead and had my way with their desserts. The desert selection was just as impressive as their food with lots to choose from. I was set on trying their gelato and eclairs.  The gelato was as delicious as it looked and is a must-try for gelato fans.  The eclairs were just as equally delicious and were a great way to end the food binge.

The selection and quality of food at Carnival World Buffet was average at best.  The selection is impressively large, but the food wasn't what I hoped for.

Either the taste is wrong or the texture is weird from sitting there too long or from being terribly not fresh because it's all frozen. Chewy chicken and spices that make you wonder if what you're eating is expired...  Yikes!!

The Carnival World Buffet is HUGE! There were an abundance of stations and we weren't able to try it all because there was just too much!

There was a sandwich station but we decided that if we opted for that, we'd be too full to enjoy dessert!

The desserts were phenomenal.  We tried 4 types of gelato between the two of us and none of them disappointed.  The bread pudding was delicious, as was the cheesecake.  The cherry pie was ok, but nothing to write home about.

So like they all say it is one of the largest buffets in Vegas, they food is great and they're open late (closing at 11p). The meats are all good, though their fish can stand to be rotated once or twice, but out of everything that was the only thing that I didn't like, everything else: The soups, the sushi (though limited), the stir fry, the Roasted Meats, The Desserts (GET THE GELATO!), and the liquor..... even though you had to pay extra (but happy hour from 6 - 10p). Their fried goods were some of the best too! Haddock, shrimps, scallops and calamari!

In the end I also got a great deal being a Gold Rewards member because I got a BOGO coup in the mail before I went and also had accumulated $10 of credit, making my grand total for 2 buffets (drummmmmm rollllllllll * Crash*) $15!

We came in during lunch time and got seated fairly quickly.  Like most international buffets, the food was separated by country, there was American, Italian, Mexican, Japanese, and Chinese.  As soon as we were shown our table we were off to the races.  We tried a little bit of everything and just as we expected everything was just average. The desserts were just average as well.  Nothing to go telling your friends or family about.  

With the Groupon came a free wine bottle which we had to go pickup at the bar.  When we first went to the bar the bartender wasn't there....10 minutes later bartender still not there....another 10 minutes bartender still not there....another 10 minutes still not there By this time, we were getting pretty frustrated (and we're pretty patient people). We had to ask one of the chefs and he couldn't find the bartender.  There was another lady waiting at the bar trying to get her free bottle, as well.  I thought that was very unprofessional.  To not only leave your station but not even telling anyone about it.  It wasn't until we were done with our meals that the bartender showed up.  No apologies, no excuses; he acted like there was nothing wrong. He just had a look on his face showing that he did not want to be there.  We just took our bottle and jetted out of there.  

The service from the other staff members were great! Just the bartender kind of ruined our experience because we were looking forward to drinking our free wine while eating our lunch.

Overall this place is a good buffet to go to if your on a budget.  It's not bad but it's not great either. If it weren't for that Groupon, I most likely would never step in here.",ireQlNltOIdagLTNs_Q_Pg,1,0,2,N8y_dprNUB4LHpzPamEgzg

Like all buffets in Vegas, the Carnival World Buffet is like a huge shotgun blast with 00 buck load. There's no specialization in any one thing but they're enough of a variety to make up for it.

As much as i want to dissect the entire dining experience and present what's good and what's bad i'm finding it difficult to do so because the balance between quantity over quality is nicely balanced.

At first i thought the plates were WAY too small for a buffet but after my 4th plate i began to realize the plates are small so you get less food (unless you pile on high) and make more trips, smaller portions of one thing encouraged sampling which resulted in a taste of as close to everything they have to offer as possible. 

The soup station is a nice addition to a buffet but the soups were lacking in body and some were a tad bland. The Tom Yum broth is a perfect example. At first taste it's Tom Yum but the flavors are so diluted and watered down that if compared to a Tom Yum powdered instant noodle broth the instant noodle would win hands down.

The prime rib is either hit or miss depending on a lot of factors such as which slice did you get out of the whole, how close to the ends, how long it's been under the lamp ect ect. The slice i got was VERY nice and tender. The slice my buddy got 10 minutes after i got mine looked like it'd been boiled and was tougher.

The Mongolian BBQ / Your Own Fried Noodles station needed a bit of improvement. For one they go a bit heavy on the sauce so ask for very light. If you get garlic take some time to mash it up and integrate it into your bowl because the fryer man wont do it for you. I had an entire lump of garlic waiting for me at the end of a bite.

Dessert was fairly light, at least for us it was. The Red Velvet cake had a very good cake to frosting ratio despite its pathetic finger sized portion. Nice coco flavor way better then the Red Velvet @ CPK. The Carrot Cake had large visible slivers of grated carrots and a very rich spiced aroma and was my favorite of the desserts. The Tiramisu galeto pretty much tasted like over sweetened coffee.

Again this place only rates about three stars but one additional star is added because they do something not a lot of places in Vegas do: Take care of their locals with a phat ass discount.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,1,4,656CCDr9c9pG6HtncChb1g

I found a coupon online (on the Caesar's Entertainment website, if you're a local) for 50% off.  Not too shabby.  We show up & for some reason or another, the lady at the cash register told us we could only get 25% off.  Alright, fine.. better than nothing.  However,  they charged the full price ($33.99) for our friends' 4 year old kid - seriously?  You can sleep at night after charging a toddler for a full buffet?  Unfortunately, they weren't locals so they couldn't even get a 25% discount.

The buffet itself is huge - lots of different types of cuisines to choose from.  I started with some roasted chicken, which wasn't too bad.  Everything after that, just wasn't great.  Not what I expected for $25 per person (with discount).  I am really surprised this place has such high reviews.  The food at the Garden Court Buffet in Main Street is just as good & it's only $7.99.

2130703,2012-10-23,3,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"Next to the M Studio B, I would rank the Rio's Carnival World buffet as the 2nd best buffets in Vegas under $30. I've been coming here for several decades and the food has always been excellent. They were first in Vegas to utilize the concept of food ""stations,"" individual themed areas that diners could pick and choose from as opposed to one long buffet line starting with salads and ending with the desserts.  Their buffets has one of the best and diverse selections of food from around the world. The different stations include seafood, Mexican, Brazilian, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and American food.

If you plan on doing any of the buffets in Vegas, especially Rio's Carnival World buffet, then I suggest doing 24 hour Buffet of Buffets pass for $45 and begin your tour here for dinner. Try to start it after 7pm or 8pm so you can have dinner twice (Best Tip!!). Definitely a good deal and worth it. For guest staying at the Rio, they have a 24-hr meal ticket for around $40 with discount. 

Each time I come here I feel like I'm attending an event. The place is so huge and long. They have the largest selection and variety of food choices (more than 300 dishes prepared fresh daily). One can get lost in this Bermuda Triangle of food heaven. All my favorite food indulgence in one place like sushi, shrimp, oysters, baked salmon, snow crab with drawn butter and cocktail sauce. The carving station with pork roast, roast beef, prime rib, turkey and ham is awesome. The prime rib is succulent, juicy and deliciously seasoned. Get me a cup of au jus and I'm camping here for a while. The Asian stations are pretty amazing as well. The roast duck, crispy pork belly, steam BBQ pork bun and Korean BBQ short rib are excellent. They even have a Vietnamese Pho noodle stations which is pretty cool. Great option from traditional soups.

When it comes to desserts, the Rio's Carnival World does a pretty awesome job satisyfing it's customer sweet tooth and their guilty dessert pleasures. They have a large spread of homemade pies, cakes, fruit tart and pastries, and 10 gelato flavors of ice cream, all made from scratch. After devouring endless food course, I'm feeling pretty glutton by now. But one thing that I can't resist is their tiramisu and mango gelato. The smooth, creamy sweet texture and decadent taste is so satisfyingly good. It's a definite must try dessert and a great way to end your food indulgence adventure.

Service is pretty decent. Our server was able to get all our drink orders and remove our finished plates promptly.

Cons - Make sure to get here before 30-45 minutes before the lunch and dinner rush to avoid the long lines. Diamond Total Rewards members and VIP players - no waiting in line. Ultimate fast pass!!

Overall - 4 star. Number one choice for Buffet of Buffets and I will definitely be back. I just need to lose 10lbs extra weight before I come back.

I know this is the biggest buffet, but it might be the biggest buffet in the world, but don't quote me on that one.  It's over 300 ft. of everything you could ever want!  The best part of it all is the quality of the food.  A big problem for me of mass producing the food is compromising the quality of the food.  I have been to this buffet several times and each time I went I have never had anything to complain about.  In fact I have had some food here that is actually better than some restaurants that I have been to.  After the regular food, don't forget about the dessert island they have.

Honestly if I had to pay for a meal here I'd be very disappointed. It's overpriced and the service is so so unless you're in the VIP Section. The crab legs are served either steamed cold or pre sliced. The jumbo shrimps are no longer jumbo and the stations looked sub par compared to the rest of the strip hotels. Since Caesars offered the all day dining option for one price all their buffets have gone south... Sad to say. 

The lines were a bit long and weren't justified. I'm glad I didn't have to wait as I'm a diamond member and enjoyed the separate entrance and dining area. Our server was friendly and always topping off my party's champagne flutes (included with meal) for Platinum and Above members only. 

The prime rib wasn't prime rib! The top sirloin steaks were dry and had probably been sitting for a bit. 

The Asian station had good selection with a few dim sum options and the dessert section had delicious gelato. All in all, I have to rate this buffet a 3 star out of respect for the property and knowing how good it used to be. I'd be back again for sure if the meal is comped.

Good, cos you should be starving to experience this example of American decadence and over-consumption. But thats ok, because you are in vegas and you might as well take a culinary journey through the globe, starting with dim sum and ending right where any meal should - fried ravioli. The reason that this place is called the CARNIVAL buffet is because you stand in line and then split into other lines which allow you to enter the attraction in a safe and convenient manner - or maybe because its in the Brazillian debauchery themed resort, Rio. But whatevs. So you pay ahead of time and then the gluttony may begin without further delay - except while you are waiting to be seated by the waitresses waving people in with batons and talking to each other on walkie talkies. The food is not amazing but plentiful and the variety is unparalleled. I think. I will have to return to vegas and eat at all the other buffets to make sure. they have a huge desert stations with adorable little pastries and slices of pie. The Asian area was the best, with amazing dumplings and buns and an assortment of soups, from egg drop to pho. Sushi was just eel and california but seafood was good especially the peel and eat shrimp. Tacos, american comfort food, pasta, crab legs, hush puppies, you get the idea. Gambling, skank-watching and drinking tropical concoctions the size of a puppy really works up an appetite - for globe-trotting adventure!

Which caused the line to back up. So what was their solution? To alleviate the problem they started to set up a separate line for non staying hotel guests who had no coupons, and were paying full price...but what's wrong with that you wonder? They got to go straight to the buffet, while the majority of the guests in line (us included) had coupons and discounts given to them, and were stuck standing in line waiting and waiting and waiting. Obviously this did not stick well with the crowd. The staff there only had one person working the line of people which was ridiculous considering its the dinner rush. So what happens? Right after we finally get to the front and pay, they open the other register and have another staff member to help out.

Place is huge, non-alcoholic drinks and refills are included in the price, and the food offerings are organized by ethnic cuisine: American (chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes, fries, etc.), Asian (noodle station, teppenyaki station, westernized Chinese food...), Italian (pasta and cheese....), etc.  Food quality is pretty good for a buffet and the number of choices plentiful.  (I can't comment on anything with dairy as I can't eat that, boo).  I was disappointed with the dessert section, first for the number of treats I could not have due to the disturbing (to me!) dairy -- those particular sweets included mini custard tarts with whipped cream, a gelato bar, and cheesecakes.  I did sample a slice of cherry pie (good but not extremely fresh tasting), the (soupy) peach cobbler, and a little square of bland chocolate cake that could have used more cocoa.

I'm going to start off and say that the 2 stars are for the food and for the waitress we had bringing us our drinks! The food was good (not as good as the buffet at the Paris though) and the waitress was super sweet and friendly. 

I really struggled with what to give this place in star ratings, because as we entered the experience was off to an awful start thanks to the hostess/manager. What a shrew! So here goes, We go in and pay up front for our just about $30 each buffet experience. We were there for a softball tournament and 4 other members of our group were already inside eating. They had arranged with the waitress in their section to hold a table for us to sit near them (not with them, near them). When it's our turn in line, we tell the hostess/manager of the arrangement. She then tells us, that we will all have to pay an additional approximately $6 per person for gratuity! WHAT?  We're not sitting with them, we're sitting near them.  Doesn't matter, if we are in the same section..even if we are on opposite sides of the section, we have to pay the gratuity up front! What is up with that!! Needless to say, we sat in a different section.  We were actually afraid to talk to our friends at the buffet line, for fear the controller of the buffet universe would slap us with the up front gratuity!! LOL!  Needless to say, we wouldn't have minded paying the gratuity...we actually gave our waitress a lot more than what we would have been charged up front..because she was that good, but it's the whole point of the thing. I could totally see it , if we were at the same table and they were serving us our meal, but this is a buffet! All the waitress was serving us was drinks...we had to get our own food!  Our visit here left a bad taste in our mouths because of the first experience and the poor customer service upon entry.

It dispenses the soup nice and hot and then you add as much tofu, kelp, and green onions as you want.  It was pretty tasty and that is a compliment given that this was my 5th buffet of the day.

I haven't been back here in years and the renovations that they did are really nice.  They have a booth in the VIP section that has a fountain running through it.  It's hard to explain - you just have to see it.  But it's pretty cool.

The staff will make Asian dishes fresh for you.  It's called a teppanyaki station but it's more like a Mongolian grill setup to me.  You fill a bowl up with vegetables, noodles, ginger, garlic, and other things.  Hand it to them and let them know if you want shrimp, chicken or beef.  They grill it up for you.  It was ok.  I would do this vegetarian next time.  The shrimp tasted nasty - like dirt.  But the veggies were good.

One of my pet peeves with buffets is that they sometimes make you hunt for condiments.  This buffet has this issue.  The butter was not by the bread.  I had to hunt around and I think I found it somewhere in the salad bar.  

The line was pretty long when we got there at 3pm but we had line passes so we skipped that.  If you get seated in the VIP section, you can get champagne until about 4pm.

I fill my plate with bits and pieces of every type of food there is to try and I have tried all of their dishes here except for the desserts. 

Once I was finished with the food, I couldn't even look at dessert. Although I would have to say that some of the food is kind of bland...for the most part if you add a few spices here and there...you have a great meal...but what can you expect from a buffet? There is not one dish that they specialize in.

This place is expensive.. and really... for good reason.  Luckily for me this time, it was subsidized.

So we got seated... I perused around a little bit and got a plate of food.  Being that I have a little one and between my wife and I, we alternate shifts while the other watches or entertains or preps food for the little girl, getting and consuming the food happens pretty quickly.

The pesto and shrimp pizza was pretty good...

I was a little disappointed that the only salad was mixings for ceasar, but as this was the 4th buffet of our trip...  needed to make sure I was getting the intake of the greens....

...and some breaded shrimp and scallops. I don't typically like to go the breaded route on buffets as I know it's just filler... but it looked, and really did taste good.

I went back for a second round after a bit for a sampling of the sushi, and I threw in some long bean mix in there too(trying to get the greens still).

So then I settled in.. got a little bit of mint choc chip gelato and figured I was just about done for the night.

the little girl was doing good and we were all enjoying dinner...  so after a little while I decided I was going to get up and walk off a bit of what I had packed in...... biiiig mistake...


I found out that the desert end isn't really an end so much as it's the half-way point...  of which I hadn't explored earlier....  Chinese food(not that I was gonna go for any of this), Mexican, some other interesting stuff including Cauliflour au Gratin(didn't try this), mac and cheese(wish I had room to try this), stuff like corn dogs and ......

a whole friggin salad bar down there... dangit...

So we were there on a Monday night.... and things were pretty bare.. which was really nice.... and at the end of our trip(like I said.. .this was the 4th buffet that we had done)... I wish we had hit this up at the front end of the trip.

But anyway... I've been to a couple buffets.. other than Terribles, they have all been overpriced to some extent(sorry.. I can eat, but shouldn't,.  and certainly not $20-30 worth).. I'm an asian guy, and somehow I just don't get the same value for my money as what some people who look like they are regulars do.

For breakfast, who could say no to unlimited bacon and mimosas? My favorite breakfast items are the eggs Benedict, sausage eggs muffins.

For linner (lunch + dinner),  I couldn't pass up on the prime rib, kielbasa, fried chicken, mac & cheese, quesadilla, and taquitos . The assorted sushi were fresh and enjoyable. As for the desserts, the gelatos where my most memorable dessert. Tiramisu gelato for me please!

2357051,2011-03-25,4,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"YEAH! The third and last buffet in our 24 hour Buffet of Buffets madness, and definitely the best!  We went to Le Village at Paris, then Spice Market at Planet Hollywood, and finally the Carnival World at Rio.

Since it had only been a few hours since we filled up at the Spice Market we were a little concerned that our stomach's hadn't had enough time to process everything.  Fortunately (depending on how you look at it), the additional hour long wait in line gave us more time to work up the appetite!

They had crab legs sticking up out of a pile of ice like a bed of nails or a really unique garden planter.  The crab was not split in half like other places such as Bellagio or Wynn, but if you don't mind the extra work of cracking the shells, it is not a big deal.  Plus, the additional work makes you slow down a little so you don't end up filling up in 20 minutes after waiting in line for an hour.  Our buffet trips are a legendary 4-5 hours of eating in one sitting, so a little time spent shell cracking is no problem.

The noodle bar is great, not as good as the one at Paradise Garden in Flamingo, but definitely second best so far.  You can pick your noodles, broth, and a few ingredients such as fish balls, chicken, veggies, etc.  Not a large selection, but the noodle broth was amazing.  I got the spicy one of course (also helps you slow down the pace of eating when you have spicy food!).

This is the first buffet I have been too where they do a nice teppanyaki grill.  Similar to the noodle bar, you just load a bowl with the non-meat ingredients, and they add the meat for you before the stir-fry process.  Now, they don't flip any cooking utensils in the air, so the flair was a little lacking, but the food was still tasty!

Note to Rio: Get rid of that ridiculous Miso soup automatic dispenser.  You have all the fresh ingredients there (tofu, green onions, seaweed, etc.) and then you have what looks like a re-purposed cappuccino dispenser from the break room at the local Toyota dealership.  It is a bit too tacky for your buffet!

I thought the wood fired pizza oven was a very nice touch.  I recommend you take the extra step to craft some unique pizzas though.  I rarely get pizza at a buffet because the carbs make you feel full to quickly, and lets face it, if it looks like Dominos then I don't need to wait in line an hour for it.  When I walked by the pizza section I just saw your standards there, pepperoni, cheese, mushroom etc.  Why don't you spring for some nice toppings such as prosciutto, artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, etc.  Or even throw in some mini calzones since you have the wood oven there.

Ok, enough suggestions.  The full bar in the middle was a nice touch since Vegas and drinking are connected for some strange reason.  The desert section was again amazing, and the gellato was really smooth and fresh.

Out of the three buffets that we tried in those 24 hours, this was definitely the best, so thanks for helping us to wrap up the day on a good note.

Food for thought:  If you can go to a winery (which is essentially a buffet of wines) and sample wines by spitting out the wine so you don't get drunk, can't we do the same thing at a food buffet?  Would it be socially unacceptable to bring a little bucket along so you can just taste the food without getting full?  Just sayin'.",uipvcv5xX02ypLsjce72xw,4,4,4,KHcqvfwkGv6k6KtLDcpogQ

I'd like to compare the Carnival World buffet to the Studio B buffet at the M Casino. For the variety and quality of food. Big selection of good tasting food with some ok or even poorly made food (sushi and bbq ribs were terrible). They have everything soup, salads, corn dogs, meat loaf, fried chicken, dim sum, mexican, asian, american, italian, beers and other alcohol drink, desserts. 

Really really loved the asian style roast duck, enough that I had almost as much duck as crab legs a full plate, juicy and tasty. They also have a real tasty asian style pork chop. If you want PHO or TEPPANYAKI they have that too, specially made for you, you pick the ingredients they'll do the rest. Soy beans. 

Carving stations!? some tender pieces of prime rib, they'll even cut it thick for you just let um know. Roast beef, glazed ham, i think is saw turkey maybe. pork and beef ribs. 

No made to order pasta but some good pasta dishes the ones you'd bake in a casserole. There was also a lot of good quality make pizza. 

Came here for the crab legs and oysters but was disappointed to find out that there was no oysters and only served cold crabs legs. didn't ask but maybe next time I'll ask the teppanyaki guys and see if they do something with the crab legs. 

Desserts not a lot to choose from but my plate of mango, coconut, and orange cream ice cream scoops, topped with warm just make banana foster, yeah you know you'd like some right now, was the best way to end my feast. 

Service wasn't that good, they were bad at clearing our table and getting our drinks even worst when we wanted refills. Didn't get our drinks until two plates in. Our table was filled with plates and cups that were stacking. 

But overall definitely worth the 12 bucks, 50% off locals, on a Friday night might even be a steal.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,3,2,4,unLuS7IKsIHN2u0_y-x8jQ

Firstly, if you park in the self parking garage, you will have to literally walk through the entire casino floor to get to the front entrance. Not a problem, just a small gripe I had. 

I arrived, as a newbie, to the buffet on a Sunday morning to the shock of a smaller than normal line. My friend is an avid Carnival eater and told me that the line becomes more over than an hour the later in the day, especially on the weekends. I'm happy she was there to guide me and my friends.

As a pollotarian (look it up), I always hope for a wide variety of vegetarian, chicken and other poultry-related items to be in the menu of the buffet I attend. Luckily the Carnival World Buffet did not disappoint. With over 300 types of dishes available on average, my taste  buds were kept busy continuously. From the delicious breakfast buffet bar(ooh, alliteration) to the Chinese section to the fresh soups, noodles & teppanyaki area, I was filled to the brim within an hour. I stocked up on the gelato bar, mini desserts & the wide variety of fresh fruit. 

My friend is a 5'4"" persian girl, but my oh my did she do the seafood section justice. From crab legs to shrimp to what have you, you get your fill of the cast from the Little Mermaid when you stop by there.

Did I forget to mention on Sundays the $25 price tag(mind you there are coupons all over the place) gets you a BOTTOMLESS mimosa buffet? I was all smiles from ear to ear when I discovered this.

You will hear from people about how there are ""better"" buffets (at a ""worse"" price) and ""cheaper"" buffets (at a ""worse"" experience, think the bathroom 4 hours later), but I would have to agree with my expert friend and say that the Rio's Carnival Buffet gave me a little bit of everything I needed...booze included.

- Service.  Our server was super nice and very prompt about picking up our used dishes.  He also sent us refills on the drinks without us asking.

I used to be forced to come here with my friend's family in jr. high because they swore it was the best.  Even then my palette knew the difference.  At that point, they were the only place with the different 'stations' for different types of food.  Everyone does that now, and a lot of them with much better results.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,1,0,2,5DR8flFo8QKEVHw0YD7uig

It's at Rio, which isn't on The Strip.  It's a little too far to walk, so if you're staying on The Strip, cab it over or hitch a ride with local family or friends.

Atmosphere
It's a buffet.  Food stations along the back way.  Seating in the front.  It's a large dining room, so you may ge lost walking back to your table after fixing your plate.

Service
The wait staff refills your glasses and takes your finished plates away.  They do so pretty quickly, so no complaints there.

Food/Drink
If you want it, it's to be found here.  Being from Maryland, we always start with the seafood (crab legs and shrimp)!  But, there's more: sushi, fried chicken, prime rib, salads, etc.  I mean, who wouldn't love an all-you-can-eat buffet with food inspired from all over the world!  Yes, it can be a tad pricey (approx $32.00 for dinner), but you'll definitely spend more money, and get less food, at a celebrity's restaurant.

Seating: Sucks for large parties like any other buffet in Vegas. DOes not accomodate large parties.

-Lines are long. We paid the extra $10 for the express line. (Not really worth it; $10 a person.)

-Does not accomodate large parties of over 6 without adding 18% gratuity. (Meaning they will not sit you together.)

They don't do this anymore, only 25% so not only is the quality subpar but it is overpriced. Got there shortly before 4pm so there was no line but caution: if you arrive prime time the lines get longer! Atmosphere & layout is good but rate it 2 stars because if you were paying full price $29.99 per person with players card it is not a good value compared to other Vegas buffets. Negatives: if you like crab (we do!)  Carnival's are the snow crab which is obviously the cheapest & smallest they can procure, a bit salty, & lacks meat & sweet taste. My spouse commented the salmon he had was dry and tough. Salad bar is OK but no Caesar blend & nothing special. Selections are varied but nothing really stands out. Some other buffets in Vegas similarly or much lower priced offer much bigger better crab & unlimited beer or wine but at Carnival you have to pay significantly extra for wine, etc.  Positives are: pleasant staff, good Prime Rib &  shrimp dim sum, gellato is good.

2679610,2009-12-23,1,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"I've stayed at the Rio many, many times when in LV with the parents.  Since they are completely against any restaurant they can't wear jeans to or that has a per person cost of more than $50 bucks or so, we have eaten at the Rio buffet many, MANY times.  Overall, I like it, and I am totally NOT a fan of buffets.  I hate the way the food is only kept warm enough so that you can't make it back to your table before its inedibly cold.  I hate the way people breathe on and pick over the food - it's a buffet, not open heart surgery just PICK something already and move on....  

Anyway, though the Rio does have these problems too to a degree, I've pretty much always been satisfied when I've eaten here - namely because of the crab legs and the shrimp.  I could sit here all day and eat just that.  I will say they have a TON of other selections that I kind of dabble in, I'll usually get some kind of pasta dish, a salad, maybe some teppanyaki or whatever they're calling their cooking station, a little sushi roll, a little dessert.  My parents seem to like the chicken wings a lot, and anything meat for my dad.  My mom, who doesn't eat seafood (actually neither of them do) always seems to have a full plate of options and to my knowledge has complained very little about this particular buffet (and she complains about a lot of food places :)  So all in all, it's definitely worth a go if you're in the Rio and want to eat somewhere where you can sample a little bit of a lot of different stuff. 

However, the line can get VERY long and price-wise its a bit steep for a buffet, 30+ per person, but that's not unlike most other LV casino buffets, so whatev.  Quality and content-wise, I would put the Rio buffet up there with the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, especially since you kind of get a better deal at the Rio.  It also helps that when I have gone here with the parents, who are Diamond+ and have rewards credits out the butt, we've always been able skip the line and they just cash in credits instead of having to come out the pocket with cash.  So no major complaints from me.  I like how they have the self-help touch screen setup so you can pay for your meal, helps the line go much faster.  And again, having dined here as a regular and sat in the back 40 (i.e. tables near the bathroom, approximately 1.2 miles from the food) it also helps to be Diamond or Platinum so you can sit in the VIP area - smack dab in the middle of the ginormous eatery that is the Carnival World Buffet.",-LUmRqjZdJGLB45pDaqdWA,2,1,4,Z1Gp0Gv8kZnU5lHTfgVtGQ

Let's see, Rio buffet how do I hate you, let me count the ways.

Yes, there is a huge selection and is a great place for those with larger groups and different tastes.  But, it really ends there.  

I think the line system really sucks.  We had a coupon and had to stand in line to the right, while people who were way behind us went up to the credit card side, paid and got seated way before we did.  If I had to guess, we had to wait an extra 20 minutes to be seated from those people who were at the back of the line.  I don't know how they think this is fair but I guess this is their attempt to keep the line moving.  

When we were standing in line, we could see a bunch of empty tables that weren't being cleaned.  The line wasn't that long for a Saturday night but the wait was over 45 minutes.  Even when we got inside, there were empty tables and still a ton of people in line.

Our server was just ok, he did bring drinks relatively quickly but when it came to taking our dirty plates away, he was very slow.

We really enjoy sushi and the selection here was pathetic and tasted gross.  The rice was kind of crunchy, and not really fresh.  The chicken I had was very dry and there were a few other things that I tried but didn't finish because they were just not good at all.

One thing that was very good was the gelato, and the meat station had a decent and pretty tasty selection.  I did have what sort of looked like creme brulee but it was not c.b.  I don't know what it was, but the bottom of it was all liquidy and raw! Yuck!

Overall, I think you can do much better somewhere else.  I know some people really enjoy this buffet but my husband and I did not.  Yes, there is alot of quantity, but I think the quality for the most part was really lacking.",NS3B17yHv2lBJfGuwSmVNw,1,1,2,UAf8kVFBjRbltrief1KM3g

Sal the manager was also very pleasant and friendly. The lack of 5 stars is for the food.

When I was waiting in line, I saw the flames that decorate one of the stations and got so excited to try the food. When I finally made it inside, I scanned the whole place to make sure I didnt waste precious stomach space on normal food like, i dunno, salad. So many things looked good so I heaped as much as I could on my plate as possible. Screw neat plating. Real foodies dgaf if sauces overlap! When I finally attacked my food, I was relatively disappointed. Everything was, for lack of a better word, aight. The french toast was cold so after 2 bites, I abandoned it. The sushi was bland so I just ate the inside and left the rice. 
The plus about this place is that there is undeniably a large variety of food to choose from. The bad part is that there wasnt anything memorable, at least for me.

I went there one night and paid the normal club card price, and the next night, the cashier asked if I was a resident because residents get an even lower price. If you're a resident and want to eat here or any of the Caesar's Total Rewards buffets, then I highly suggest you go to the rewards center and get a ""resident sticker"" to place on your card. Otherwise, have something on you that shows a local address (i.e. drivers license). I'm in the military and stationed in Las Vegas so I don't have a Nevada drivers license...in case you were wondering why I didn't show them my drivers license.

Our server was extremely cheerful, so much so that it bordered on the fake side.  She was helpful and constant smiles, that we couldn't figure out if it was just her personality (as scary as it seems, some people are actually like that), or if she was feigning for a big tip.

Unfortunately, I have bad news, most if not everything was sub-par, don't have anything to write home about. The only things I like from all these items were the bread pudding, a dessert and galeto that was about it.

Don't get me wrong, the desserts look astonishing but they were too sweet for me and didn't really taste as good as it looks.

The food tasted like from a fast food restaurant rather than from a high quality restaurant.

Maybe is just me, but in my honest opinion, it just didn't wow me at all, it was just not my type of taste and quality.

We went to Vegas for 4 nights so we bought the one day pass buffet. It did save us a lot of money vs. paying each meal individually.

2825566,2011-11-27,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"My husband came here in October, and couldn't stop raving about the food. He said it was almost as good as Bellagio. One month later, we found ourselves at the Rio for a few days, and I wound up eating here three times. It wasn't because it was the Best Thing Ever; it was because it was the best place to eat at the Rio. Anyway, the first time was dinner, then lunch, and finally breakfast into lunch over three days. I probably should've gotten the BOB, but oh well.

I was pretty underwhelmed with dinner. Sure, the selection was huge. I was intrigued by the teppanyaki station, but I didn't try it. The salad station is tucked waaaay at the end, but nobody I know eats salad at a Vegas buffet. I sure don't. Anyhoo, I liked half of what I had, and really didn't like the other half. The fried fish, crab, and dessert was good. The mac and cheese became edible with some sriracha. Much of the stuff I didn't like was dry (chicken, corn dog, fried rice). I guess my husband- and the $29.99 price ($3 off with a Total Rewards card)- set my expectations a little too high. 

Despite my experience, I was encouraged to try it again, this time for lunch. What I had was better. Breakfast was the best meal there; I really liked the breakfast foods that I tried, especially the corn beef hash. 

Drink service was a little slow at times, but the staff was nice enough. 

While it was ""a-ok"" as the Yelp rating indicates, I wouldn't make a trip out if I was back in Vegas and staying on the Strip. Bellagio is still my favorite. If you do go here, try to get here before five. After that, the line gets ridiculous.",xEzDkpwXTU6Nh2HnE_HFRw,0,0,3,OlExmZQr6wuasBXFIB4XSg

2829758,2011-07-17,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"I agree with Robin C's review. Completely dead on. The wait was long but seemed to be moving till the point they put us in the multiple pay lines. My friend and I had a coupon so we were put in the last line which is apparently where all the couponers and Rio guest were sent as well. Lets just call this the ""no body cares line"" so you will basically be standing there not moving forever while all the other lines continuously flow. You will see people that were a half hour wait behind you be seated before you while you stand there hungry and upset without any Rio hostesses even looking in your direction. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore so I asked the Cashier what was up and he basically told me there was nothing he could do. I asked for his manager and he acted like he was going to talk to him. He came back, continued to ignore everyone including me without giving me an answer about where his manager was. It was absolutely ridiculous. Finally, I asked again and when the manager came, I let him have it. At that point, he spoke with the hostesses who then began seating people in our line. My friend and I were next in line when we noticed that other lines were then being sat first again! I called the hostess over, she asked how many (2) and then asked everyone else in back of us. She then proceeded to seat all the larger groups in back of us! I asked her what the F was going on and she told me that she had 4 top tables and we were a 2 top. So after another minute or so of waiting I called her back over, pointed out multiple two tops that were open and she yelled at me stating that we were supposed to go with the other larger groups because 4 top tables can seat 2 people. I told her that I am not a fricken idiot, I know what was said! At that point, it wasn't worth it. I just went to our table and took full advantage of that damn buffet. 
You name it, I tried it, didn't care how much food I wasted. The food wasn't even that great. I had been to the Rio multiple times before and the food was much better and I remember genuenly thinking that it was the best buffet I had been to. However this time, I realized that no buffet is good. Buffets are just full of crap that is not fresh and they charge an arm and a leg for it. If I want good fresh Chinese food, I can pay 7.00 and get full, not 40.00 for crap! Anyways, the other times I had been to the Rio carnival buffet, the seating didn't seem nearly as disorganized. Perhaps it was because we paid full price those other times. Seems like they give those people priority when they should be just going off the time on the receipt and seating the people that have been there the longest first. Gee what a concept?!? 
So to conclude, although this buffet has the reputation of being ""The best Buffet"" in Vegas, I would never return. Go here at your own risk if you like as much as you can eat crap food and like to wait in line for over an hour and a half. Just make sure to eat before coming or come with a stocked purse of snacks for when you are waiting. Also, make sure you have no set in stone plans for after your dinner. The family in back of us had booked a show for a few hours after they decided to come to this buffet. Needless to say, once they finally got in, the mom had to rush to the box office and see if she could change their show times. Apparently, that was not possible because that family was only able to spend about 30 minutes there to eat and had to run. They couldn't even get their moneys worth and try everything that the buffet had to offer. I thought it was pretty sad. Did I also mention that they were guest of the hotel? You would think that being guest, the box office would have been willing to work with them since their Buffet is full of incompetent jerk employees. 
The one upside is that our waiter was very nice and very attentive, something I didn't expect after the service we had received while in line.",F10QJk-i3IrUxKcJI9CF-g,0,0,1,SC56ZjS_SYOg2OT0fwAvrQ

They have 3 dishes here that have clams ( seafood kung pao, a weird cream sauce mussel & clams, and a seafood pasta dish), the seafood kung pao is the only dish I would recommend getting.  The mussel & clams dish was all lumped together, and wasn't very appetizing.  

The crab legs aren't cracked, for you, and are so tiny that I didn't even bother eating any of them, until I tried one of my friends.  The hot butter that they have for you is nice. 

The prime rib here is ok, not as good as the one at Spice Market Buffet.
The fried chicken isn't that bad with the spicy hot sauce. 

They also have the noodle mongolian bbq  here ( like Chef Khan's) where you choose all the stuff that they want to fry for you , and they will stir fry it.  For the Asian Section, they also have a made to order noodle soup, I tried my friends' pho, and it was pretty good.  The egg drop soup was too yellow and looked really unnatural, the 
spicy and sour soup was pretty good, but a little too salty for me. 

They had alot of fried foods, Corn Dogs, fried calamari, fried clam strips, french fries, etc.

I think that Carnival World Buffet meets that happy medium where everybody can be well, happy with.  For instance, a buffet on average is around 30-40 dollars anyway so people who complain about the price- go to the other 10.00 buffets and have yourself a grand ole time, eating their food and  try not to get their crab legs!  Their food- although not the BEST tip top quality- i think was pretty darn good.  Their crab legs were good although they were small, they had all different sections- italian, salads, asian (they even had a pho/noodle bar) desserts, carving board, seafood, etc.  There's a LOT of food.  The set up is really strange though and I had to navigate through tables like moses through the desert to get to the desserts (get what I did there, didja? didja?)  Anyways, we were seated far but it gave us an excuse to add in a little bit of walking time in between plates.  Luckily I wasn't hung over like my last stint at Cravings so I was able do me a good 3 plates with dessert and crab (I KNOW, I can eat a lot) as well as their unlimited mimosas.  What's funny is we (a group of 3 girls) came at least 30 minutes before a group of 3 guys and stayed there 30 minutes longer than them... yes we eat and drink a lot..

Either way, I think you'll be happy eating here.  Out of all the buffets that are around 30 bucks, this is one of the best.  But I must say that the Wynn Buffet in my opinion beats this place out of the water.

For me, one of the main reasons to try a buffet is to sample various deserts that you may not find anywhere else.  The desert options here were a bit lacking and uninspired.  I suspect most of the deserts are pre-packaged.",edjcp0dqcvQ6Cx0vQj8wCg,0,1,3,OdFhqwwj0bjZ49hFp8BXow

Excellent buffet.  It really does have everything a girl could want.  When waiting in a long line and never having been there before, the price of $25 seemed really steep to me - but I was assured by my companion that it was well worth the money.

Oh boy was it.  They have a section for the major varieties of cuisine - Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, seafood, American, and Desserts (maybe more).  I was able to fill my plate - which is sometimes difficult being a picky eater that doesn't trust a dish if it looks like it has just 1 ingredient I may not like.

The wait staff is awesome as well.  I don't think I've ever had such good service (beverages, plate clearing) at any buffet before.  The guy was even offering to take pictures for the parties nearby, pulled out chairs for the ladies, etc.  Superbly nice fellow, well worth the tip!

The dessert was to die for - normally when I think buffet I think dried out cakes and puddings, but this had quality pastries and the special when I was there was a bananas foster - OMG!  Delicious!

The Carnival buffet is known for its massive variety of dishes and yes, if that is truly what you are looking for then this buffet is right for you.

However, if you are expecting more than just variety and more of quality of the food itself, I am sorry to say that the Carnival fails to meet this specific criteria. The food definitely falls short of anything spectacular and even memorable; I cannot recall a single dish worth remembering today! 

Despite my negative opinions, the price is good ($25 for dinner) and the variety does live up to its solid reputation. The Carnival World Buffet is definitely a good place to go with a group of friends or your family, however, the Rio is off the strip so unless you're actually a guest at the Rio, you're going to have to pay for cab fare.

3) Oysters were ""flat"" and not plumb and juicy. Guess that's what happens when they thaw out vs. fresh. LOL
4) Snow crab legs were overly salty! How can that be?

6) Lobster tails were small (3"") and overcooked
7) Sashimi had that frozen and stale taste
8) Sushi rice was dry

The only good thing about this place is the wait staff. They are quick and efficient.

I've been to many buffets (Todai, Hotel Del Coronado, etc...) and I was extremely disappointed compared to the others. I guess they figure there's so many transients that they don't care about quality and opt to satisfy patrons with quantity.

Unluckily for us we hit it during this random Sunday Champagne lunch special, where they tack on 6$ to the price whether or not you plan to have their ""complimentary"" one glass of champagne. It was good, and, granted, cheaper than getting a separate drink at the bar, but since not all in our party took advantage of it, namely, those under 21 and the driver, it seemed wasteful. 

Anyways, international is the name of the game? Hardly. If they have good chefs here, they certainly aren't American, Chinese, Japanese, or Italian. Stay away from the teppanyaki, dim sum was hardly that, and even immutable pasta left something to be desired. The one thing I liked about this that Caesar's or others I've recently been to didn't offer were the king crab legs, in which I indulged myself wholeheartedly. The gelato bar was also outstanding and a memorable dessert. But on the whole I felt that, like at many buffets, I was simply eating to fill my stomach and not enjoying the food.

I don't usually leave a large tip on top of something like this, where the waiter traditionally only brings drinks and clears dishes, but the waitress clearly went out of her way to be friendly and helpful. I like that. All in all, the great waitress wasn't enough to salvage the buffet's impression from the below-average food.

For around $27 I was highly impressed with the quality of the food - not to mention I couldn't of asked for a lovelier waiter.

The coffee is good (for American coffee), fresh orange juice, a huge salad bar, Chinese/Mexican section, seafood area, carving station and a huge dessert bar but the standout by far was the cooked-to-order tepinyaki station - wow! You can choose everything you want and it's made right in front of you.

Other notable mentions were the fried chicken (not greasy, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection), the prime rib at the carving station was tender and melted like butter in the mouth, the house-made gelato was also great and I loved all the novelty flavours.

Downsides to this buffet: It's at the Rio which is off the strip.  There is a shuttle that runs pretty regularly though so look that up and save the cab fare.

Now if this had been the buffet everyone was talking about, it would have definitely been overhyped because this buffet was as crappy as any other asian buffet you would find in the Bay Area. The selection was crappy and I would not even classify the food as good asian food.

I had no clue though that it would be one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. The Carnival World Buffet is the probably the greatest buffet in the world. How many places can you go and have pizza, freshly rolled sushi, gigantic crab legs, tacos, and burgers all in one meal? They have everything and it is all for an excellent price compared to other Vegas buffets. I definitely recommend trying to find coupons to stretch your dollar even more. For example, the last time I went, I found a coupon in one of those tourist magazines for a free steak cooked to order with your buffet. I thought that since I had a coupon it would be a little piece of meat, but I was pleasantly surprised when I got an excellent cut that had been cooked perfectly. Also if you go, make room for dessert! The fresh fruit chocolate cups and gelatto are almost worth the price of admission by themselves.",s76J8AsfaaRrker3s22ulw,0,0,5,aC-ARC7fD9kXUC_b6z1kqQ

All the food was nasty to so so. The prime rib, which has always been my favorite, was flavorless and really fatty. The crab legs seemed smaller and were really salty. I have always recommended this buffet to anyone I talked to going to Vegas. I won't do that anymore. I would take the $34 and eat elsewhere.

The best feature of this buffet is the huge selection. There are about 7 different types of cuisine plus a desert section. So you could have fried rice and roast duck with a side of hot dogs and hot wings if you like. I know that's a odd combo, but there should be a large enough variety to satisfy in the pickiest eaters.

Highly recommend. Don't take my word for it. Just give the Carnival World Buffet a try. My only con is I don't have big enough stomach to try the entire buffet.

We got the buffet around 2pm, and stayed for about 3 hours (including the 1 hour wait to be seated) wandering the smörgsbord of international cuisine at the Rio.

- Noodle soup bar, (the udon was pretty good)
- Gelato station
- Assortment of desserts (mini eclairs! moussecake! red velvet cake!)
- King crab legs station
- Cocktail shrimp station (next to the crab)

And the rest was decent, but forgettable. Our server/busser was very attentive and even showed us how to use the plastic crab crackers (different than the ones I'm used to). He was friendly and filled our glasses up quickly.

My dad, husband and I knocked out 30+ crab legs ourselves ... and my sweet husband was kind enough to shell every single one for me. Clean hands! :D That's love, people ... that's love.

They have about eight different eithic foods to satisfy all your tastes buds. I love the Asian soup stand. Tell the chef what type of soup you want and they cook the noodles instantly for you. Come on.. everyone knows that a little pho/udon is great after a day of drinking. However, I would save some room for the crabs... Soooo gooodddd... I think each of us ate at least ten of those bad boys that day. 

Note: any group of 10 or higher that wants to sit together have to pay a $3.60 per person tip upfront (which is reasonable). We came in a group of 20 and they put us all in our own private room. YAY!

They have a good mix of all kinds of food, from fried clam strips to steamed mussels to gelato to mongolian beef. On top of that, it was one of the cheaper buffet dinners on a Friday evening for only $23.99. Not to mention the registers to pay are self serve. Yes, self serve. Feel free to enjoy the animations of silhouettes dancing in the background as you type in how many people are part of your party or how you will be paying for your meal.

I said before that they have way too much food to choose from here, but then again they tend to have the same dish on 2 different sides. There's a bar in the middle of the buffet, but unfortunately drinks aren't free. The bartender does announce on occasion what the specials are for the next 15 minutes. 

The fried rice had the restaurant quality to it, and the steamed mussels were cooked to perfection. The sushi rolls were decent quality, but don't expect it to be awesome. I do appreciate the fried goodness section, which is basically a french fry medley, fried cod, fried clam strips, fried shrimp, and fried scallops. Fried scallops! I love scallops, and that's just amazing! Oh, yeah there's also clam chowder and lemon baked chicken. Hungry now?

She started screaming at me saying that she's not putting it on too tight and it's policy that she puts it on for me herself. I told her that it's too tight and it's 113 degrees outside, I don't want my wrist getting sweaty because of this wristband and I don't it to rip off because it's going to get wet if I sweat.

I put my pinky in between the wrist band and my arm so that when she puts it on it'll be a little loose and not super tight and she tried to slap my hand. SERIOUSLY! She's like, this wrist band is waterproof so you can stop it with that! I said, I'm just asking you to please not put it on so tight, it makes me uncomfortable. And she goes I WON'T!. 

Such a b! Ugh... The people behind me (which was a lot of people) saw what happened and made a scene with her about how rude she was. I just walked off to get my food because it was so much drama.

I ate there this morning for brunch. I used my locals discount and normally they only give 50% off for dinner on Sundays, but because I signed up for a Total Rewards card, they gave me the discount for Sunday brunch anyway. If you're a local, it's worth it to get a Total Rewards card because you get 50% off any time Monday through Friday. Anyway, it was $58.35 for brunch for the four of us. For brunch, they serve champagne and servers carry around trays with champagne and mimosas.

First off, I just want to say that their foods are hit or miss. Normally, I like to write out all of the foods and describe them, but since this is a buffet, you're either going to try this place or not, so I'll just categorize the food into great, pretty good, decent, and so-so.

Great: King crab legs with butter on the side; the waitress, Carolyn, also had a desheller for me to use when she saw that I was eating crab. Cool beans...
Gelato: they had many different flavors - strawberry, mango, orange, cookies and cream, tiramisu, chocolate, and more...
Meatball: Make sure to choose the ones that are down below still in the juice, so that you get plump juicy meatballs instead of the ones that are on top which were dry

Pretty Good: Blintz with cheese inside, mashed yams, and criss-cut fries

Decent: Roast beef - very flavorful but kind of rubbery when I had it but worth trying, cheesecake with white chocolate pirouette and whipped cream on top, fruit bar and salad bar, udon noodle soup

So-So: Pork chop, fried squid pieces, popcorn shrimp

There were many things I didn't try. They had sushi, a whole Chinese section with duck, pasta, rice, soups, and much more. Also, for drinks, I noticed that they do have a full alcoholic bar, but they charge you $3 or $4 per drink.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is for the price. It's creeped up from reasonable to just a tad over the top over the last few years. We usually go for lunch and are able to find a coupon online so the price ends up being about $15, which is more than reasonable, but I don't think the dinner prices are justified. Maybe that's just me speaking as a vegetarian because all of the meat and seafood options are not a draw for me, so with everything included I'm sure it is worth the heftier price tag.

Honestly, when I go to Vegas it has nothing to do with gambling. I stick a quarter or two in a machine and that's it.

I mean you cant verify that every guest has washed their hands or not so Id rather not take any chances. I do enjoy pre-plated options like Wicked Spoon though this buffet does not do this. 

So slapping on the old feedbag I was pretty blown away but the sheer quantity and variety of the stations. Chinese, Mexican, American, Seafood, etc.. was crazy how much food there was. While I could go through all the items I tried like the tough and chewy prime rib and the off tasting salsas Id rather just say that this buffet is right on par with say a cruise ship buffet. The quality is only alright but for the price point of $30 I expected higher since the Wicked Spoon is high quality and only charges a few bucks more. 

If you're expecting to be wowed just lower your expectations and Im sure you'll be fine. My expectation of anyone visiting a buffet, please wash your hands first.",p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,1,1,2,AmFrxLlrRMphbDImAtUD3Q

It was about $50 bucks for two of us. OK.

We both finished a plate before we had some one come ask us for our drink order. And then it was like pulling teeth trying to flag our server down for more mimosa's. Even though we had waited an hour to get in, there were empty tables everywhere! So it wasn't really that busy. And our dirty plates sat on our small  table far too long before they were cleared. 

We shared a napkin for a while because we couldn't find one anywhere and our server was missing. 

The ""sushi"" looked worse than grocery store grade sushi and that is being generous. 

No bagels and cream cheese. What the????

In the Rio Buffet, starring yours truly, my eyes lit up, my mouth dropped open, and I started digging in to everything I could fit on my plate!

Close your eyes...make a wish....and you will probably find it at the Carnival World Buffet!  This has to be one of the largest buffets with the biggest variety of food I have ever seen.  What is your favorite type of food?  It's probably here!  I was thoroughly impressed with their Asian station, including various soups (the hot and sour is my favorite!) and pho, freshly prepared while you wait!  The Italian station had pasta and pizza that was surprisingly good!  There was a sushi station, seafood station, salad station, American station, and it just kept going on and on!  Oh yeah and did I forget to mention - BBQ Ribs that were so good!!

If the words ""heaven"" or ""hell"" could be used in retail terms, then Carnival World Buffet would be the closest to heaven I have ever been.  (WalMart being the closest thing to HELL!)

For your sweet tooth, they had gelatos, mini ""pie bites"", mini ""cheesecake bites"" and more!

The staff was friendly and very outgoing!  We went there on a Saturday evening, and there was no wait, we simply walked in.  During the weekend daytime hours, they have a champagne brunch with all you can drink champagne.  A great addition to any good buffet is champagne.   (Ask for it mixed with OJ for mimosas!)

As an experienced ""buffet-er"" I can tell you that this is one of the best, and not to be missed!

SUGGESTIONS:  Stick to what makes this buffet unique!!  Avoid the prime rib, and all the buffet ""standards"".  (Not that any of their food looked suspect, but really, you can get a good prime rib just about anywhere in Las Vegas).  Hit the asian station, BBQ station (for ribs), seafood station and/or sushi station, and build your plates around that.

In the past, we have gone to many other buffets in Las Vegas and they always allow the handicapped to skip the line and be seated right away so it really surprised us when we were told that we were going to have to wait in line for about 30 minutes before we would be seated. As we turned around to get into the other line another employee came over and told my friend that he would be allowed a table right away. He was going to pay for one of our friends and then the other three of us were going to pay for ourselves. Well, he was told then that only he and the one friend would be seated and the other three of us would have to still wait in the other line, thus splitting up our party. If the rest of us had waited in the other line we wouldn't have been seated until the first two of us were done eating. When she heard us complaining to each other about this the hostess told us that if the three of us wanted to pay an extra $5 fee we could skip the line. Because we didn't want to split up our group we decided to do this making the total fee for each of our meals over $42! So for $42 it should be an awesome buffet, right? WRONG! The food is basically the same that you'll find at all the buffets in town, except for four times the money!

Crab legs: more displayed than the ocean itself, but excitement quickly evaporated just like the legs-no meat in them! They are not pre-split, very difficult to get any meat out and shell is fuzed with skin and meat, tough task and takes more time than it should. Very ""un-meaty.""
Mexican: Taco meat looks gross, tastes so-so. You can make tacos, soft or hard, with usual condiments. Nacho chips available for making nachos, but cheese sauce is watery and disgusting to the max. Use shredded cheese instead top with mystery meat to melt, then add toppings.
Pizzas: oven baked, most are good just catch the hot ones.
Deserts, gelatto: Very good selection, ok taste, nothing awesome, but many items to try, all portioned tiny (good for sampling)
Salads/soups: standard fare, found clam chowder it was all right. Other soups looked gross. Salad bar is ok but not extensive, very basic.
Sushi: Good tuna and salmon rolls with heavy rice. I got a bunch, ate out the middle left the rice, I don't give a ____.
Teppan station: To the right of sushi, easily the best, and only great part of meal. Pick your items, give to chef, ask for shrimp with your bowl he fries it up benihana style, its really tasty. Wish i found out first day and not second, you can eat only 3-4 bowls of this and be full and happy as hell.
Morning omelettes made to order decent, usual crappy thin and dried out bacon (very bad) hash browns suck ass/cold. And for brunch next day, all leftovers from dinner are on the trays again.
They do not have fried chicken but grilled. They have fried chicken wings near salad which are good n greasy. Crisp coating.
Fruit station-a joke.
Chinese- standard orange chicks, broccoli beef smothered in heavy garlic dark sauce. Little chicken and some pad thai will do thanks.
In all, just work your way around, take little by little, because you will not like half and eat half, but in the end the bargain that counts, i guess. Get the $37  24-hr pass eat 4 meals (buy at 2pm, eat at 2pm, 8pm, 7am, then 1pm!)

The food deserves only 2 stars, but our waitress was phenomenal; drinks were constantly refilled, dirty plates taken away, napkins replaced. Even the busser had a great sense of humor. 

This buffet could easily be the size of a city block with dizzying choices for food. We went for lunch since it was more affordable and goes on til 3pm. (Lunch: $16.99, Dinner $23.99)

You can get anything that your little heart desires.  Pizza baked in a wood-fire oven, usual pasta dishes (with aflredo or marinara sauce), Chinese food which even includes some dimsum items like siu mai (thick wrapper) and char siu bao (lots of filling!).  They also have stations for made to order sandwiches and asian style soups.  For the health conscious, a long salad bar with fresh greens and even off season fruits like Watermelon tasted sweet. 

The busiest station seemed to be the carving station which had prime rib, roasted lamb and beef, rotisserie chicken and smoked kielbasa.  Most of the items I tried were either dry or tough, which doesn't make me a happy camper. 

Dessert items saved the day. We sampled every flavor at the gelato station (coconut was the winner) and true classics like bananas foster and bread pudding are must try. Like the true Pinoys that we are, we packed some chocolate biscottis in a napkin for snacking later.

On the night i was there, they had a 10 minute happy hour special of martinis and beer for only 4 dollars!   

Before you go there, make sure you talk to those advertisement people who are standing around the hotels.  They will give you coupon books which will save you 5$ at the buffet.

3404180,2010-07-08,1,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"So the last time I went to Vegas... we ate at the Rio Seafood buffet... AGAIN. And then afterwards I got the shits... AGAIN (probably from excessively eating crab legs and oysters more so than the quality of the food). But halfway through that meal which was about 2 hours later, I realized I was so damn sick of Rio Seafood buffet. 

Well this time, we decided to change it up... rolled out of bed around 4 pm, got  ready, and... everyone wanted seafood buffett. NO!!! Went to Seafood buffet and once I saw the line, I refused to join in on that debacle. Went to Carnival... and it was an even longer line. Damnit... dont make me eat cafe. I was tempted to go throw $500 down on craps just to get comped and get in the comp line, but out of the corner of my eyes, I saw a sign that read ""Express Lane $10.00"". Asked around and found the express line  ""somewhere"" (If I put it on here, it probably wont be express anymore so you're gonna have to find it on your own yelpers). We were seated in less than 10 minutes. 

That evening I toured the (culinary) world. Crag legs from the Bering Sea; Sushi, Kim Bap, Mongolian BBQ, beef broccoli and egg rolls from the far east; ribs, fried chicken and country fried steak from the south; prime rib from hell; corn dog from the fair; chicken parmigiana from italy, Pho from Vietnam, tacos from Mexico (try the hot salsa....  so good, I gave the latino chef behind the counter a chin up); red velvet, carrot cake, eclair, fruit, gelato, and sorbet. 

The food was standard buffet food, not the best but hey it's not easy to cook 150 dishes for 500 people every night, so I take that into consideration. The crab legs were actually very good, not too salty, clean shells, and restocked fairly often. Servers cleared the plates pretty quickly, although my friends complained their drinks werent refilled enough... but then again who gets refills at a buffet? go drink some pho bitch.

so many choices and enough that you will find something you like. I usually get the crab legs...i figure if I eat a lot of this scrumptious crab, then it will make up for the cost of the meal which is around $25 per person. I also always get the ribs...so tender and delicious. I also get a little taste of everything but my main meal is the crabs. Squeeze the lemon juice on it and dip it in butter...aaahhh heaven.

I just recently tried their sugar free coconut pie and I also added the cherry jubilee sauce on the side...this is now my favorite dessert. so good and not too sweet.

The service is also stellar- never ending supply of napkins, wipes and drinks. Our server was quick with taking our empty plates and re-filling our drinks.

Appetizers:
Nothing here was very fresh.  The crab was slimy and overcooked demonstrating lack of freshness.  Even the shrimp for the shrimp cocktail was slimy.  They may have the variety of items but lacks significantly on quality.

Salads:
Reminds me of a salad bar at a Sizzlers, and I hate Sizzlers.

Main Entree:
As with a smorgasbord I tried a little of everything.  All the meats were of the lowest quality I have ever tried.  They were so chewy that I was unable to eat it and spit most of them into my napkin.  

Desserts:
Large selection but of the items I tasted, they were all very bland.  Yes this place seems to focus more on quantity and variety.

The Rio may have the largest buffet and variety in Vegas, but they have the worst quality of food I have tasted so far.  To experience the difference, try the buffet at the Wynn for comparison and you'll see what I mean.

If you've been to one off-Strip buffet, you've been to them all, except this one is massive.

The Chinese pork and duck were tasty, except there was hardly any meat on the duck. I did like the Chinese broccoli, though. It was nice seeing pops of greenery among the buffet options.

If you have the extra $40-50 for cab fare I'd recommend going that route.  

The staff were ok on our trip.  It took a long time to be seated because of a chef changeout at all the stations.  Shouldn't have much impact on the food already out or cooking but I guess it did.

The food here is great too. Of course there are some things that one would not like (hey it's a buffet). But most of the dishes that I had were great. I especially like the pasta and seafood dishes. And the desserts here are great here too. Get the gelato!

There isn't much service going on here considering it is a buffet. But nonetheless, our waitress was quick to clear our plates and offered refills on drinks often.

3489541,2008-12-05,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"When I first walked into this buffet, I was like WOW. It's pretty huge, and carries a huge variety of food. I was starving and I couldn't wait to fill up my plate(s). Another big thing I noticed once I walked in was the huge dessert bar in the middle. My boyfriend & I went on a Thursday night so it wasn't crowded at all. You have to pay through a touchscreen which I found out was really annoying when we went again on a Sunday with our friends. The line was soooooo long. I think we were waiting for an hour & we were lined up pretty close. But yeah, those touchscreens can cause some real traffic with those crazy lines.

Anyways, back to the food. I'm a picky eater so I chose the most I could possibly eat. I got two plates at once. It took me a while to walk around & finally settle down at our table. There's a lot to choose from. The food looks amazing, but it wasn't as great as I expected. I honestly can say I've had better at Hometown Buffet (and that's sad). Some of the foods I tasted were way too salty, way too plain, or way too different (in a bad way). And the dessert..I love the apple pie & gelato ice cream EXCEPT the mint one..gosh, that mint flavor left the nastiest after taste. The waiter we had on Thursday night was extremely friendly, but the waiter we had on Sunday afternoon was very slow & cared little about our table. Overall I gave this place 3 stars because although I didn't enjoy it AS much, I know my boyfriend and other friends did (and they eat more of a variety than I do).

After doing research on a bunch of different ones, we opted to go to the Carnival World Buffet. I have never been to this one before, but it had a champagne brunch offer, so I was completely in.  We cruised down to the Rio and waited in line for about 20-30 minutes, which wasn't terrible considering how long the line appeared when we arrived.  Upon sitting, David brought us champagne immediately and we started manhandling some crab legs, which is what we did for the next 3 hours.  Everything they had to offer was quite tasty and the different genres they offer gives a little bit of everything for everyone.  

What was also cool was that if you bought drinks at the bar inside the buffet, they were only about $3-$4 each and every 30-45 minutes they do a $2 special of certain types of drinks for about 20 minutes, first come, first serve.  

Overall, I would highly recommend this buffet to others and would definitely return here again in the future.

This knocked my 4 star rating down to 3 stars. 

I actually had a great experience at this place and loved the food selections and variety. My husband and I purchased bracelets as part of the ""Buffet of Buffets"" tour. Of all the buffets on the tour, this one was the best. Really I should say it was the best of the worst. LOL. 

One thing I don't understand is the cold crab legs. I am from the East Coast (Maine) and we only serve crab legs steaming hot. Every place I went in Vegas was serving them cold. This must be an East coast/West coast thing. I suppose at a buffet type of place might run the risk of overcooking the legs and making them tough. 

Personally I prefer my crab legs warm as the crab flavors are much more enhanced when heated. Honestry I was a little hesitant to try crab at any of the buffets we went to in Vegas because many of the crab stations did not appear to be heated or cooled properly.

3617963,2015-08-03,1,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"WARNING: MANAGEMENT IS RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL and trains their staff to be that way as well!  If I could give this location zero stars, I would. 

Quick food review: I was there tonight (8/02/15), and the food was no better than other buffets in the area.  For a birthday dinner, it was fairly disappointing, especially for the price.  I should have gone elsewhere (Lotus of Siam) and eaten something of much better quality, as well as reliably and undeniably delicious, for less!
 
The reason I am so angry, however, is how my friend and I, and another couple seated nearby, were treated by staff.  This couple had originally been seated at the booth next to ours, and had been there for a while.  They got up together to refill their plates ... at which point the seating hostess placed new people at the table!  Not only had the original couple obviously not been finished, their table hadn't even been cleared yet!  When they returned to their table, they were obviously confused.  The newly-seated people were rude and dismissed them, at which point the seating hostess swooped in and said ""oh, my fault, let's sit you guys over here.""  So you're expecting people who'd paid $30 each to eat as much as they want and leave when they were finished to just be ok with being unceremoniously moved mid-meal?!?  RUDE.  
 
By this time, my friend and I were nearly ready to go, whereas the couple who'd been moved a couple of rows over were still mid-meal.  I went over to them, apologized for imposing, told them that my friend and I had seen what had transpired, and asked if they would like me to find a manager for them to speak to.  I asked if they were visitors (they were), and said that as a local, I did not want this experience to be the one they ended up telling as ""the big thing that happened while they were in Vegas.""  I suggested that they should be comped for their meal, and they thought it was a good idea and that they would ask for it when the manager came to talk to them.  So off I went to find the manager.

As I was bringing the manager to their table, the seating hostess tried to pull him aside, saying ""I need to talk to you for a minute"" and ""You don't need to talk to them, they're fine.""  She was already trying to get out of trouble.  The manager started talking to the couple and told me he'd come talk to me afterward, but I could already tell that he wasn't planning on doing anything.  Sure enough, when he got over to our table, he said that he'd tried to comp them but ""they wouldn't take it"" -- of course not.  Not when your staff is encouraged to either intimidate customers into not complaining (or guilt them into not getting a staff member into trouble).  I wasn't too happy with this because obviously someONE got them to change their minds, whether it was the seating hostess or the manager himself.  

At that point, he started attacking me, asking me why I even cared, since it didn't happen TO me. (Because I have a right to be offended, and a right to speak up, when other people are rude to those around me, that's why!)   He made a show of ""listening to me"" but interrupted me frequently and rolled his eyes while I was talking, which I called him on.  He asked if there was anything he could do to make our visit better, and I said that since he either wasn't listening/paying attention to WHY we were upset for the couple who had been reseated (and at that point, for the rude way he was speaking to me), there wasn't anything he could do for us and that we were going to leave dissatisfied -- and never come back.",88bX84kj-1Rk77wfrZ62JQ,3,1,1,02hd6Vfvi3NWYv9WaXE-Ew

Anything from pizza, to the CRAB, seafood, sushi, prime rib, to nachos, tacos, Chinese food made for you on the spot, salad, soups, and the DESSERT!

That buffet is never-ending. It stretches for a mile, or it seems to be that long. The wait staff was attentive and nice. 

The crab was great, fresh, i just wish they had better things to crack and pick them with, I guess bring your own if you have them. The desserts were eye opening! They had GELATO! Tiramisu flavor, so good. The cheesecake was.... my mouth is watering, creamy goodness. red velvet cake! woo hoo!

3629764,2011-08-24,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"Short explanation: Bacon and omelettes

I can't recall the last time I've had bacon so perfectly cooked and flavorful. I ate too much bacon there.

Omelette: After spending years trying to make a good omelette at home the short order/chef woman taught me how just by my observing. I can now make something almost as good as hers at home. I wish I could go back again and learn all over to make sure I didn't miss anything (is an omelette really that complicated? yes!)

I got a 24 hour pass and came 3 times a few weeks ago. Did this place used to be open 24 hours? I was disappointed to see that it closed at 10. 

Everything was great and I can't give it 5 stars because buffet reviews are basically about comparing them to others especially in Vegas so there's always a possibility that there's something better. I'm convinced though that most of the hotels get their food from the same suppliers so we're all just imagining one is superior to the other :)

Selection was OK but I wish it just had a few more things..like more types from the same cuisine. I was surprised to see pho at dinner but considering it's popularity in the last few years it makes sense. Don't expect a good sushi/sashimi bar--definitely not there.

Just don't make the same mistake I did and go after your pass expires. I lost track of time from being inside the hotel for 2 days and waited in line for 20 minutes only to go up with my pass and have the cashier look at me funny. 

Will we ever see the buffets list their basic ingredients? I hope so because there were things I tried to avoid because I didn't know what it was made from (allergies).

Carnival World Buffet, for ~$35 a person for dinner, located inside Rio Hotel, is huge. Huge I tell you. It doesn't look fancy schmancy like some of the other buffets, but they still serve food. And again. Food. Buffet. YUM.

You go in, pay, then wait for someone to sit you. They ask you what you want to drink (soda or water or juice) and then you get a fork. You yourself go out, grab a plate and EAT. EAT UNTIL YOUR EYES MATCH YOUR STOMACH. Because there is a LOT of food.

First part was meh. Pizza, some other small stuff.
Then you get to go to the Mexican part. Tamales, rice, beans, guacamole, salsa, beans, steamed fish. That part was decent enough. Taquitos as well, if you enjoy that too. Then you go to the salsa part itself (mild, medium, hot, tacos, ground beef, etc). I got a lot of cheese and sour cream and guac here because it reminded me of chipotle. I put that on top of rice because I wanted to have fun.

Then you enjoy. The crab legs. Unfortunately, I liked it, but after a while it got tiring. After plate # 8 or 9. There's butter so you can even put hot butter afterwards. It got salty... I don't know why, the crab legs got saltier and saltier with each passing one. The clam chowder was good. Hot and had a lot of potatoes and clams. 

Keep going and a chef has a knife and he wants to attack you. KIDDING. Prime rib! It's good :DDDDD Prime rib with raw meat is amazinggg. It is really tender and flavorful. Make sure you have the red part. If not, then ..no. Don't get it. They have ham and other meats as well, but they didn't taste as well for me :P

Sushi- Nah. Gonna leave. Good bye. No sashimi at all. Just cheap spicy tuna and CA Rolls and stuff like that. Adios.

Live Asian Soup to Order. Wonton soup, not a fan either.

Chinese section- orange chicken, clams, rice. I skipped. 
BBQ Pork/Pig/Duck- SKip. Skip again. I had it and it tasted hard or the pug skin was not crunchy. No. Go away. Skiparino.


Dessert- this would make the Dessert Queen blush. The ice cream was DELISH. Cookies and Cream- YUM. Chocolate- Mhm. Decadent. They have oreo cheesecake, pumpkin, apple pie, cookies. I spent a lot of time here with the ice cream/gelato. It looks beautiful and tastes great!

Go around and enjoy your crab legs. Even though this place was around $35, I would say it's decent rather than amazing. I ate slowly too, and at the end I was already tired of the food and didn't have anything that I would go back here to try again.

Service:
It wasn't busy, maybe still early since we got there at 5:00, not quite the dinner time yet. And so, we were seated almost immediately. Our server was very nice, came around frequently to clear our empty plates and replenish our beverages.

Food Options:
The stations got switched out. There used to be a station of different soups, but it's gone now. Only ones left is, Miso soup near the Asian food station, noodle soups, and chowder near the fried finger foods area. Pasta station is smaller and sort of combined with the Mexican food now. Where the Mexican food station was is now a ""Skewer Station"" (see my picture). Seems like the food choices have shrunk down a bit.

Food Quality:
I'm not a huge eater, I'm actually not a good partner to bring to a buffet, since I probably don't eat enough to cover my cost =)
I had a small slice of prime rib, Med-Rare. It was tasty, ate the entire piece, without using any additional sauce. The Yakisoba was great too, tasty and noodles were soft. I also liked the crab, they had both hot crab and crab legs cut in half laid on ice. The half was great, my children got a chance to peel their own crab legs.
Fried shrimp was a bit dry, Clam Chowder was clumpy, like it sat there dehydrating for a while. Sushi was SOUR, either they used too much vinegar when preparing the sushi rice, or the person making the sushi kept dipping into vinegar to prevent the rice from sticking to his/her hands. BBQ Ribs used to be very tender, falls off the bone, but tonight's ones were really tough, couldn't cut through it with the knife.

The roast beef and other sliced meats were SO YUMMY.

They had PHO too but I didn't eat that.

I do wish I tried other buffets though. My friends commented and said that the buffet they paid more for was better in quality then the carnival buffet but if you're staying in Vegas for a few days. I say try them all!",q_m6qpGrwH_JUZjVJmEsBw,0,0,3,9WlYc-MYT-sB8XMFYqv4QA

Pricing: my mom and I paid 31.99 for the mimosa brunch on a Sunday. My dad was stuck with the 33.99 dinner price because he joined us after 3pm. I actually don't think I've had a mimosa in my life before this (probably sad, I know), but those suckers were addictive and surprisingly strong~

Not sure how this works re lunches that overlap into dinner, but they definitely stopped filling the mimosas after about 3:45/4pm, even though we stayed something like 3pm-5pm.

Food Choices: there were some highlights and some misses as to be expected. 
1. Get: french fries, surprisingly- it was hot and crisp and a good starch to go with crab legs, anything in the cold Italian mixed dishes section, crab legs(!!!), marinated grilled pork chop (tender and juicy), grilled pork belly, grilled asparagus, anything off the fresh soup menu in the asian section (my mom got wonton and I got tom yum, both were refreshing), gelato/HOT cookies (dark chocolate with white chocolate chips, dipped into or smeared with vanilla gelato...mmmm)

2. Skip Definitely: char siu in the chinese section (flavorless, quite tough), coconut pork, or basically pork besides the marinated chop (also flavorless and tough), the cupcakes in the dessert case (because the gelato and the hot cookies RULE- I probably had 3 cookies dipped into gelato)

Service: we had a...polarizing experience.
Our first busser, whose name I think was Vince/Vincent? (sadly, total guess) was THE BEST buffet busser I've ever met, bar none. He acted more like a waiter re clearing out plates and keeping the mimosas filled. 

And he was adorable, lol. 

When I first sat down he asked what I'd like to drink and I went with just water since I wasn't sure the mimosa did come with at that point. I was in the buffet line when the drinks came but my mom reports that he brought the waters back and super-emphasized that /I/ was the one who wanted only water, kinda seeming to imply that he'd bring mimosas asap when I had a change of heart, haha. After I wised up and put in a mimosas request he stopped by one more time and asked how I liked it. I think I mouthed ""it's good"" around a mouthful of food, and he looked fake affronted at it, going ""good is not good enough, you need to enjoy MORE! :D"" 

However, busser 1 went off shift before we finished eating and the second one was...absentminded/clueless. o_o He spent what seemed like 20 min talking to a table of locals instead of clearing plates in the area, and often walked by our plates that were dirty without taking them. He was never rude, just...bad. 

As I hardly go to Las Vegas and the other buffets sound equally good, I probably won't be back.",xjpw1-E7hedO_2Ua73k9oA,0,0,3,6iXAAtQjC9JPT8V03QqNkQ

After 4 buffets in the past 5 hours, there was a part of me that wanted to quit at this point and just drive home.  Realizing how stupid that would be, I decided to press on and head over to the Rio for Stop #5 on the Buffet of Buffets Marathon.

Once again, when our group was seated we took a few minutes to pause and gain the strength to go after another round of food.

This buffet is one of the largest out of the 7 on the list and there was plenty to choose from.  Since I'm not eating Meat right now, I narrowed down my choice to a Cheese Enchilada, Chimichanga, Slice of Pizza, Quesadilla, and a Churro.  All were very, very good.

There are other selections but honestly didn't pay as much attention bc of my whole food/price ratio. I had this delicious sausage (that's what she said) and ome greens... But it was mainly the crab legs. It has no taste but you go to another kind of dish you liked (if the sauce I like) - pour the sauce on the crab. Yum. (yes, I can be ghetto like that).

My first time at Rio with my family was amazing. Yeah this was like 10 years ago but I just remembered that the food was great and we couldn't even sample everything given the enormous amount that they offered. A year ago I ate here with my friends on a summer Vegas trip, I left unsatisfied. 

The quality has somewhat diminished over the years. The pasta's didn't taste anywhere near the same as I remembered, the Asian dishes were all a waste of stomach space. The crab and shrimp was ok, not as good as Mirage, Wynn, and Bellagio quality but it kinda saved the meal from total disappointment. 

The meats were just average for what Vegas buffet standards are. Their prime rib was bland and not as juicy as other buffet's, I wouldn't want to use the word ""dry"" and ""prime rib"" in the same sentence but its bout there. You can find a better meat selection at the Bellagio for just a few dollars more. 

The dessert wasn't bad at all actually. I again make a comparison to Bellagio because I felt that the price difference wasn't much and you get better quality there. But i wont take much away from their dessert selection. The gelato was delicious, it was the hero of the night. The one item I kept coming back for. The other dessert items were somewhat forgettable but they satisfied my sweet tooth for the night.

I once thought Rio had a great combination of quality to quantity of selections but now its not longer on my Vegas buffet radar. For what you pay for one dinner you can find better quality elsewhere. The $34.99 deal that includes 7 different buffet's including Rio's might raise its value a small notch but I have yet to try that deal so I can't say.

Ups: more selection than most buffets, gelato 

Downs: price compared to other buffet's isn't worth its quality, long dinner lines",EL-em1F8ifdrl0e2xs6A3w,0,0,2,hYBzcRXECmYBcsAnWCbemw

I will be the first one to admit that buffets are not my favorite. However, my friends love them and I find that each time I go I find something that I like. This is because there is so much variety and there is generally something for everybody...even picky eater's like me. 

I have been to the Buffet at the Wynn and I was not impressed. I have also been to the Buffet at the Bellagio - It was okay, but the buffet is way overrated in my opinion. However, I truly enjoyed Carnival World Buffet. This is probably because I love fried shrimp, calamari, waffle fries, pizza, sushi, etc and Carnival World put all these things on the map! Now, if you love somewhat undercooked (or red) flavorless lamb chops, grilled lamb, ribeye steaks, duck, prime rib, vous de vous (sp) baked pastas and cold crab legs, California rolls, salmon and tuna sashimi, then Bellagio Buffet is the way to go. The food at Bellagio looks really good and will impress anyone at first site. However, the food did not warrant a 1 hour wait.

1) My family aren't foodies, it's all about variety & quantity over quality for them
2) I didn't want them to spend too much money taking 6 of us out to Wynn or Paris (I knew they'd be happy wherever they ate)...Carnival World was $26/person vs Wynn at ~$37/person.
3) There ain't no buffet in the world better than the free gourmet ones I eat at every single day :) I don't need no overpriced Wynn to prove that!
4) I found a coupon for free cooked-to-order steak (which you normally need to pay extra for) in the latest What's On free tourist magazine. You can find these mags anywhere.

Anyways, our group arrived at Carnival World at 6:30pm and there were NO lines. It was great because 30 mins later, there were lines out the door!

And my god, this place is a football field of food. You know how some buffets look big but they just duplicate the food on 2 sides of the restaurant so they can disperse the lines? Well not here! All the stations are unique and it's a bit of a trek from your table to see everything. This was a HUGE plus. My family is composed of the most finicky eaters ever, and they were allll happy! Imagine my shock :)

The coupon I found in What's On provided our group of 6 a total of two free steaks. You redeem this coupon at the cashier while paying for your meal and she gives you an extra promo receipt that you take to the steak station to put in your order. We did this at the beginning of the meal and 15 mins later, we had 2 juicy rib-eye steaks. While I'm very picky about my steaks, I had a bite of my dad's. I was expecting chewy rubber but it was surprisingly delicious! Props to the cook! I swear, my mom and dad couldn't stop talking about how good the steaks were the rest of our vacation (so cute).

All in all, while food was average, I had a great experience. We were a bit wary of the service since so many reviews complained about it but WOW, our server was super awesome. She came by every 10 mins it seemed. Our water, sodas, coffees were never empty. Discarded plates were taken away quickly.

I like a huge variety of foods from around the world, I love diversity, and never have one particular craving. Therefore, if I can recommend any buffet in Vegas, it is this one.



This buffet continually gets voted Vegas' best, though you will also find many complaining that the food is second rate, the lines too long, and the wait not worth it. 

Well, let me give you the rundown. The buffet is open from 7am-10pm, seven days a week. Of course the breakfast array is more limited than dinner, but when you arrive first thing in the morning - you can avoid lines and know that everything is fresh. However, also note that because the selection here is so varied and vast, there are many stations at which you can have your food prepared fresh. (i.e.: sushi, mongolian bbq, teppan yaki)

There is something for everyone here. Homemade pies, burgers and fries, pasta, mexican, japanese, chinese, great salad bar, and much much more. The key thing is temperance here. Get a spoonful of everything that delights your senses, then you can try everything!

Breakfast is $13.99, Dinner $23.99. A lot of reviewers claim that these prices are too high. Perhaps they don't realize that they are paying for more than 300 dishes, all of which they could eat if they had room...",P2sQVHyHmy4WA0I7NI5hWg,5,4,4,vfYB7VWeGSpa1bwnctXwdg

Yea, you read that right, $37 per person on the weekend, but I think it was definitely worth it. They have soooooo much food you will not be able to taste it all, no matter how hard you try, trust me. They have little sections to separate the kind of food, so they have the Italian-like section with pastas, lasagna, pizza, and then the Mexican part with tamales, menudo, enchiladas... then the Asian with pho, fish balls, pancit.

Here's the kicker, though.........we got up to the front of the line and discovered that if we had walked over to one of the partitioned areas, WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN IN RIGHT AWAY.  However, NOBODY TOLD US WE COULD, and it was partitioned off as if we should stay away.  Instead of the manager or another buffet employee staying outside and making occasional announcements (as most places would do) that there were the automated machines for cash or credit card, which would have moved the lines along MUCH, MUCH faster, they instead remained silent and let all us dummies stand there for all that time, not ever knowing it was available.  I was already tired from getting up at 5am, traveling 1/2 the day, and now add in my feet were killing me from standing so long...... I seriously didn't need any added reminders telling me my body is getting old.  At this point, I'm just pissed.

That's not all, though.........for all 11 of us, there was a delightful table for 12.......we had our eye on it, seemed like the perfect place for us to park our stuff, but yet........it was not to be ours.  New rule..........for a group of more than 10, a mandatory gratuity of 18% was being added to the already higher buffet rate (than we remembered), and this was not the case 5 years ago.  Nor were we in ANY mood to have more annoyances thrown our way.  Yet, if we took a table for 5 plus another table right next to it for 6, we'd have our seats but without the mandatory 18% gratuity.  I think what irked us the most was when we spoke to the manager about the long lines, plus the lines that were open but no one knew about.......and his reaction was one of ""soooooooooo???????""  Not an attitude you want to see when you're already pissed.

Then we get to the food part.  I went here for two things, and two things only.....crab legs and peel n' eat shrinp.  That's it.  Part of the reason is because I can never get that kind of quantity anywhere in L.A. for that kind of price, and yes, I definitely ate my money's worth of crab legs and shrimp......but let me tell you......I had to work for every last bit of it.  The shrimp was definitely in need of being peeled, but why did I have to?  Why couldn't they have done it?  The crab legs that needed my cracking them, well, that was a real job.  My husband wanted no part of working at it, but I didn't mind........I wanted those crab legs, so I worked and worked and worked at it.  They brought me some plastic device to use because they were not easy to break apart, nor had the restaurant gotten the crab legs started for me.  I had to crack them entirely, and it was not easy.  Plus, there wasn't that much meat in a lot of what I got, and by the time I realized the larger crab legs were the meatier ones, I had pretty much finished.  I took my time, stuck with it, and got what I wanted.  I can't speak about any of the other foods (from everywhere around the world) only because I didn't try them.  I left room for dessert, tried a few things, and pretty much didn't like any of them.  Uninspired.  Boring.

All of us decided, young and old alike, that our tradition of going to the Carnival World Buffet has come to a close.  We were so pissed off by how we were treated, how they really don't give a shit about moving their lines through more quickly, and how the quality of food has gone down while the prices went up....we figured that we don't need to go there anymore.  There are many other buffets around town that would be quite happy to have our business.......with far better food.",p4UcEYTLJyh96o1R8wrJaQ,4,3,1,J5OaAVhaevurl8e6n1hVIg

Tonight, I enjoyed the Chinese duck, beef tamale, some Chinese pork, and some wonderful white bean and tomato salad.  These were the highlights before I went to the dessert table.

I would have given this 4 stars, but service was awful.  Our server didn't clear dishes, he didn't bring drink refills, nor did he come around to see if we needed anything.  Drop the place settings, extra napkins, and off he was.  Awful!  This is the first time I didn't tip at all.  He needed to know he was awful.

I'd have to give this buffet a ""quantity over quality"" type of place. ""Quantity"" as in, they have a wide selection of foods. 

Being Chinese myself, I was actually surprised that their Chinese food was pretty decent to eat. Definitely better than the Panda Express fake sh!t. 

Their Mexican food was better than Taco Hell (Bell) and (Del) Hell Taco. 

Sushi was probably a step above your pre-packaged sushi from your local Safeway Supermarket at best. 

Although, you can't go wrong with their hoffbrau section since it's ""all-you-can-eat"" prime rib. Nor can you go wrong w/ their Italian section. It's pretty good w/ their pizza selections, spagetti, lasagne, and other pasta dishes.

For their seafood section, I didn't bother to try because of the fact that I'm in the middle of a f*cking desert and the nearest ocean is at least a 4-5 hr drive away... So yeah, I don't really trust eating seafood if I'm far from the coast. Just how ""fresh"" can the seafood be in a buffet??",PJtohAOs_a6_ixjtTKe2ZQ,0,0,3,Pw8WQz3JFSiU3w5Zd7K3Ug

As a local, I really appreciate their hefty 50% discount on the weekday buffets.  It's the not the best I've had in Vegas but it is the best I've had for the price.

They have really good selections at their breakfast buffet.  An Egg made to order bar, and all the meats you can think of (ham, prime rib, sausages, links, bacon,  etc), fresh fruits, oatmeal, if you can think of it...they probably have it.  They also have non-traditional foods available such as tacos, burritos, rice, pot stickers and so on.

Lunch and dinner are also quite enjoyable.  Once again, almost anything you can think of they'll probably have.  The hubby and I really enjoy the PHO they have at the Asian soup line.  Carnival World Buffet is the only buffet I know of that serves PHO and Tom Kha Gai.  They're both good but I add some extra stuff to my PHO to liven it up.  I add a good splash of soy sauce and stir fried veggies (fresh cilantro, jelapenos, bok choy, carrots, broccoli).  These items can be found just around the corner of the soup line.  Everything is good there.  We haven't had a bad experience yet.  I haven't experienced any bad service.  As a matter of fact they've gone out of their way to get me a drink they don't regularly have.  I was craving some iced green tea.  The waitress brought out some tea bags, hot water, and a cup of ice.  

We love coming here for the food, the price, the service, our picky little kids and family get togethers.

4014455,2011-09-26,2,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"I keep on putting this review for the Rio buffet off, and I've been eating here since I was a freshman at UNLV in 1996!  About time I give this place some props!  For those in the know, the Rio buffet was the one that started it all in Las Vegas when it came to fancy all-you-can-eat!  Gone was the $4 buffet of gloopy leftovers (I'm talking about you Sahara),and in came the glitz and glamour!  The Carnival World Buffet was THE buffet to visit when you came to Sin City back in the 90's.  It was the best.  It was the biggest.  And damn, it was good!

Rio's buffet was voted best buffet in Las Vegas for years.  Of course, times change a bit and now you've got other big players in the 'Buffet Battle' as I like to call it - Wynn, Bellagio, M, Wicked Spoon and more all competing for the coveted award.  Yep, the Rio may not be the biggest and brightest as of right now, but it still holds a special place in my heart.  Back in the fall of '96...fellow college buddies and I pulled off an all-dayer, we stayed at the Carnival World Buffet from the beginning of lunch to the beginning of dinner!  It was a glorious 5 hours of gluttony, belt-notch loosening, and packs of TUMS!  Of course, it didn't help that the bathroom is so conveniently placed right inside the buffet to make those trips to the chow line much easier on you.  And yes, as annoyed as our server was that we took up a table for so long...we did tip her very well.

The food quality back then was good, and in my opinion I think it is still very good to this day.  Come on now, this is a buffet, pulling off Michelin star cuisine while keeping the price under $30 is near impossible!  For what it's worth the quality of the food is still excellent.  It must be because this buffet still packs in the folks on a daily basis.  They are after all, the 1st buffet in Las Vegas to start the automated teller line used to pay for your food!

I enjoy literally a little bit of everything from this buffet.  My fav is still the Asian section where you can get Chinese dishes made fresh, several choices of dumplings, char siu pork, and for dinner the ever popular roast duck (I have been know on occasion to snipe half the tray at first sight of it being put out).  There is also the great noodle bar, where you can get a decent bowl of ramen, pho, udon, or even some tom yum goong.  Me a like a de spicy!

No, the sushi section is not Morimoto fresh but wow do those guys make a great teppanyaki.  I like the fresh veggies mixed with shrimp and beef topped with their great sauce.  I get a plate to share with the table every time.  Their gourmet pizza ain't too bad either, I always grab a fresh slice of two.  For those of you who are old school like me, you remember the pizza station replaced the burger, fries, and shake station that used to be there when the Carnival World Buffet was still in it's infancy.  True story!

One reason I really like this buffet?  They make Reubens!  I like a decent Reuben sandwich.  I get one without fail.  Here's a tip though, ask the chef nicely to make you a fresh one on the grill because sometimes the ones sitting out under the warming trays can get a little dry.  Tipping is your friend!

I could go on and on about everything I've tried here over the years.  There's American, there's seafood, there's Italian, there's BBQ, and oh the desserts!  Honestly, I love the fact the have fresh Bananas Foster always at the ready.  I top mine off with some vanilla gelato and I'm a happy camper.  

Service here is quick, polite, and efficient because they move a ton of plates everyday!  Pricing is very reasonable for buffet standards in Las Vegas:

Breakfast - $15.99
Lunch - $17.99
Dinner - $24.99
Weekend Champagen Brunch - $24.99

But wait, there's more!  Las Vegas locals are some lucky people because we get 50% off breakfast, lunch, and dinner, M-F and dinner on Sunday!  Cheapness is the bestest!  All you need is your Nevada ID and an empty stomach.  Don't forget, the Rio Carnival World Buffet is also on your list of the gut-busting Buffet of Buffets!

4018967,2014-02-04,17,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"You gotta luv a buffet that goes from 3pm to 10pm for dinner, eat early eat later. Heck I remember eating dinner here as our breakfast because we were out so late and woke up around 3pm. Eating here for lunch or dinner price isnt bad for what you get. You sit here and try all the different foods and don't realize 2 hours has past and your so full you need a vacation from your dinner. 

The variety here is the biggest plus and the food is solid but also keep in mind that its a buffet don't expect gourmet meals. If you want to binge on crab legs and shrimp tell the staff in advance that they may need to pump you stomach afterwards. This is the first buffet Id recommend in Vegas but you should also try others after eating here.

Pros
Snow crab up the wazzoo.
Prime rib.
Desert cakes.
Shrimp.

Cons 
Soups.
Noodles.
Pizza.

TIP, Do not eat here and then hit a club after. You may need some time to ""settle"" and shower up.

Unlike other buffets, which usually offer only 2-3 kind of icecream, this place offered like 12-15 flavors..

4024665,2010-11-17,19,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"Let me apologize for not writing during these past few days...  sori!
Here is the reason...  I knew I was going to Vegas, I understand that my next one is my 100th review, therefore, I had to review one of the much better places to make my 100th review shine!  There's no other place better than City of Sin to scout out all the awesome eateries so that is why I've delayed my review for the entire weekend.. again, sori!  I do hope you all understand...

So... 100th one... what should I have...  Buffet of course!  Didn't get the chance to check out Wynn again (it's been a long time), but at least I end up at Rio's famous Carnival World Buffet...  So here it goes...

First of all, the name of the buffet has the word ""World"" in it... I bet you wouldn't expect it but literally, the selection is as big as this world!  Last time I've been there I remember the food lineup were as long as Walmart on Black Friday!!!  But now... it seems like the line is actually as long as Best Buy on Black Friday!!! (For those who has done the BF thing will understand my reference, good luck by the way if you are going this year!)

Focus Henry Focus!!!  Ok... so... damn!!!  The selection seem to be longer than before... so let me tell you how this great wall of buffet is set up!  

Starting from the left, you got like 8 different styles of pizzas, some condiments for burgers, bunch of seafood delicacies, crab legs & crab claws, deep fried seafood, mash potatoes along with the carving station, roast chicken, Mexican food sections such as taquitos, flautas, quesadilla, mole, carne asada, more mexican condiments, etc., The Bar (for some real fun drinks not ice tea or coke), Fresh Noodle station with pho, egg noodles, soups ranging from egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, etc. fish balls, pork balls, beef balls, more chinese condiments, chinese food such as chow mein, stir fried veggies, some meat dishes, dim sum, sweet bbq pork, roast duck, Italian/seafood, lasagna, meat balls, blackened catfish, broiled salmon, salisbury steak, country fried steak, , corn, pork chops,4 types of hot soups, salad station, fruits, cold salad related sides, wall........  Whew.... I'm terribly sorry for the EXTREMELY LONG RUN ON SENTENCE, but that is the best way to describe this unworldly buffet line!!! It is literally that long!!!  And let me tell you, despite all the descriptions, I probably missed like 30% of the food on that great wall of buffet!!!  It's absolutely ridiculous that they expect anyone to try all of their food here!!!

Ah ha!  That's when I come in!  Agent H on the job!

So I had to get very small portions and was actually able to get one of each samples from the plates on display... OMG was I full!!!  I swear I will never do that again!!!  Rio I hate you for doing this to me!!!  You leave all this deliciousness out there just so you can see me suffer!!! WHY???  (But I thank you for the yummy food!)

So enough with the descriptions.. I know if I continue on this post 5001 character is not enough!  So here's my assessment and evaluation of this monstrosity that they called a buffet line.  

Everything was actually decently made!!!  I pretty much enjoyed every single thing there with the exception to the following...  (you definitely should read this and skip them because I suffered to get you this piece of important info!)

Things to skip:
**Sushi -- hard cold rice, not fresh at all
**Veggies -- waste of stomach space
**Noodle soup -- This is an iffy... I loved the soup but was way too salty, maybe Mr. chef there can add some hot water or something? It's quite salty
**Salmon -- Not sure how but they overcooked it... pretty dry and hard
**Corn Chowder -- nothing special, again takes up space in tummy
**Dim sum -- maybe it wasn't fresh when we got there but looked stale and old... very uninteresting.......
**Fried fish filet -- Dude, these patties are from the supermarket!  (Van De Kamps)  Not tasty at all

Do try everything else!

Now... they still have dessert!!!  AHHHHH!! I can't take this anymore!  All this food and now a dessert island station right by the exit!!! 

Sure I'll take some yummy treats please!

Gelatos! Gelatos! Gelatos!  Tried all of them and here are my favorite and least liked choices...

Dislike:  Coconut---way too sweet
Right in the middle:  Vanilla Yogurt---pretty tasty without that much sugar
Favorite:  Sugarless Chocolate---WOWzers!  Taste like chocolate without the sugar!  Rich, Creamy, and absolutely amazing for being sugarless!  Where you've been all this time???

Other desserts were on my notable list too such as bread pudding (I heart bread puddings with Whiskey sauce), cheesecake cup, and the best dessert would have to be the super eggy flan!  Extremely enjoyable!

So now... can someone wheel me out of this place?  Get me out of here before I say... Yes... I would like to see what else they got... maybe another ice cream?  maybe another cake?  Maybe this is one of Sin City's absolute best?  Just maybe...",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,22,18,4,cobDZmc4cslRROOeyypIHw

They have a big variety. They have your typical sections. Italian, carving station, Asian (Chinese and Japanese), Mexican, a salad bar, and American. Uniquely they have a custom noodle soup bar, a choose your own stir fry station, and they have some crab legs and shrimp to peel.

There are a lot of good dishes like the mozzarella and cherry tomato salad, Chinese pork belly, and the soup bar. 

This is a popular buffet so their food is usually being turned out pretty fresh.

Honestly it's about as good as GVR, Red Rock, or Sunset Station. Just a couple of notches better. But a station buffet is $10?

Their carving station is lacking specifically the bland prime rib. Their dessert section is lacking and the crab legs that probably directly impact the cost aren't that good. 

If I were a visitor I would spend the $10 more and go to Bachannal or wicked spoon. 

I've realized I'm not a buffet person. I'd rather spend $30 on a nice meal then $30 on an endless amount of hit or miss dishes.

Would I pay $30 plus a 20% gratuity? (There bus men and servers are quite attentive to cleaning plates off your table and refilling your drinks) No I would not.

That's right.  For an awesome $23.99 charge, one can walk in and literally absorb the food via osmosis.  Cellulite?  Three orders coming right up.

The only reason why I pushed this place was because I read somewhere that this was one of the largest buffets in the nation and that the lines spanned the length of a football field.  That's right.  You are reading a review by someone who does take quantity over quality at times.  

Initial review?  Eh, not too impressive.  Sure, the buffet tables were long, but the food was mediocre in that I was strictly looking for meat dishes and ignoring the carbs.  That meant my several slices of prime rib went down nicely with the glass of water (no soda, the bubbles make you puff up) and I was equally charmed by the BBQ beef ribs (went back for 6 ribs) because they were juicy and blubbery.  Some of the chicken (Piccata style) was slightly dry but the somewhat watery crab legs and shrimp covered up the lag.  I decided to give in to a little carb nagging, so a 1/4 of rice pilaf padded my stomach nicely.

My male friend and I were keeping up with the meat orders.  I bypassed the Italian pasta bar, the Chinese food chow mein, and buffet style sushi in order to ensure I was obtaining my $23.99 worth of meat.  When it came to dessert, however, I betrayed my instincts.  The bread pudding had just been put out and the bread called to me, like the Sirens at TI.  I scooped up several mounds of the fluffy bread pudding and poured on the caramel sauce from the Bananas Foster dish.  Hubba hubba.  Wait, was that Banana Cream Pie?  Muhahahaha.  I picked up two slices of that.

After a good hour and a half of stuffing ourselves, we had to roll on out to the driveway to hail a cab.  No way I was going to be photographed rolling around the strip via blueberry style.

For the Vegas family outing, this buffet is enough to serve a child's dream come true.  For adults with no discerning palate, a decent and inexpensive place to stratify your stomach prior to blowing the education fund out on the tables and slots.",m5cBT7OYfn0HM0d-RCsdZQ,6,3,3,misQtv3fnR_NiCS_W7N9Rw

Fast forward now - even for their price, which is consider on the more affordable hotel buffets, just leaves me with a stomach that hurts. I like that they have so many options - seriously, you'll burn some of the calories just walking back and forth, searching for your table because you were too hungry to remember as you dashed to the seafood station. The taco station is a nice visit if you're interested in making your own tacos, hard shell and all.

The dessert station, which I used to be quite fond of, is now mediocre. It's like everything is just tossed together - no flavor. Just loaded with sugar and HFCS. The gelato is good, but I would say that about many other buffets serving gelato.

Yes, the lines are long. I never had a problem in the past because for the most part, I went through the Diamond line.

My sister brought her house guest to this buffet 2 wks ago and she eagerly told me about this buffet and how I would enjoy the Pho station and the pork/shrimp shumai. Most importantly that locals get a 50% discount- Really? Cool!!!! 
So, off we went a few days later and yes it was true locals get half off (that means only a little over $8.00 for lunch) but now you do need not only a local ID but a Rio players club card. So pay the players club a visit first if you don't have one already. Oh, and along with your brand spankin new Rio players club card you'll also get $5.00 in slot play and a coupon book.

Alright, back to the buffet- most of the time be prepared to wait in a line especially in the locals/discount line.
It did take way to long to be seated but once we were seated our drink orders were taken and off we went to eat.....
I really enjoyed the Pho station- the chicken ginger infused broth was soothing good. It wasn't salty or bland, I thought it was just right. That broth comes with fresh egg noodles but realistically you can have whatever noodles you want in it. If you want pork wontons steamed with your noodles just let them know.  I got the egg noodles and I thought they tasted really fresh- like from a good ramen. There are also different condiments that you could add to your Pho like beansprouts, fish cakes, and a chicken mushroom ball. Of course there is soy sauce, Sriracha sauce and other flavorings to add to your liking.

I would come to this buffet just for the Pho station....For the price (about $8.40) at a restaruant you'll get one bowl of Pho but at this buffet you could have as many bowls as you want and with different broths and noodles. Yup, so worth it!!!!

The shrimp/pork shumai is really yummy.....
The spicy shrimp salad located on the far right of the buffet is yummers and the shrimp mango salad on the far left of the buffet is yummers also.
The cranberry rolls eaten with butter is good.....
I thought the rice texture in the sushi was alot better than in other buffets.
I thought the dessert part was lacking....
I look forward to dessert and the variety just wasn't there. The red velvet sqaures were weird because it's topped with a real tangy raspberry jelly thing-Not good!!!! The cookies - blah..... There was a dark choclate ganache thing in a mini pie shell - it was OK.
The gelato was the savior dessert with options like Mango and Orange Cream.

Some things I liked and some things I didn't - sounds like a typical buffet to me but because of the price at lunch added with the Pho station, I would come back.....",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,3,1,4,_hfiYUCcIh9kH74-JyIzmw

Overall you have endless choices of food. The quality of the food is pretty low though. Nothing amazed me. Theres nothing really here to go out of your way for. Everything is mediocre.

I didn't hate this buffet but I had tried the Bellagio and Palms buffets and they were far superior to this one. Of course less selection but everything tasted really great. Also the Palms has way cheaper prices and tasted way better in my opinion

At the end of the day the variety hurts this buffet at Rio because they never truly get to master a dish. Everything lacks quality.

Carnival World Buffet satisfies all three with added extras like a great dim sum and fried food section.  Loved the fried food: fried clam strips, fried shrimp, fried scallops and onion rings!! Crab legs were juicy and tasty and the fried chicken wings were great.

And I couldn't help but come back to get more sweet treats like their mint chocolate chip gelato with warm chocolate bread pudding and their bananas foster.

We set off to Bally's but the lovely concierge rep in front of the casino told us to head to the Rio for one of the best buffets in town.  We hopped a shuttle and went from Bally's to a carnivale.

I think for the price the buffet is good. (I believe it was around 16 dollars) I haven't seen one that big ever, that's for sure.  All the food was represented with a full table- Chinese, Japanese, American, Mexican and a fabulous dessert center area as well.  The buffet went from one side of the room to the other and it's so overwhelming its hard to know where to start.  As for the food itself I wasn't entirely impressed - the billboards all over town show crab legs and there wasn't a crustacean to be found (well, there were shrimps, but no crabs). My lunch companion is a vegetarian and surprisingly it was a bit difficult to find lots of vegetables and other edibles for him too. He didn't say anything contrary but I noticed -- and felt it could've been better.  

There was even a bar buffet. Now before you get too excited what  I mean is there was an area in between all the buffet sections where you could order a drink -- the announcer let us know for the next 20 minutes we could get several different cocktails for only $4.00. If I didn't have to work later that night I may have just for the price alone.     

I did give an extra star for our server, she was this fabulous older lady who would curtsey everytime she left our table.  The dessert area itself gets a star too -- so many sweets, so little time.

Rio is your standard for Vegas buffets.  They're not trying to be high-end like the Wynn, but they still try to give you a little more quality than Hometown Buffet.  Overall, I think they succeed.  And plus points for not gouging dinner prices.

It's a great place for families because they have all types of food.  Of course, I spend the majority of my time eating crab legs but the rest of the food is decent and filling.

I'd been there 3 times before and each of those times I was absolutely thrilled with both the rich quality and the abounding quantity of food at the buffet. 
However, this time I was rather disappointed.  The best thing there was probably the prime rib this time.  I mostly had some Asian soups.  The sushi (especially the spicy tuna roll) tasted old, and so did the guacamole.  It all tasted old and bland.  They also did not have the korean bbq beef that I had enjoyed so much last time.  The dessert was mediocre at best and it was largely a disappointment compared to my last experiences at the Rio.  They just might have had an off day or maybe I had really big expectations due to my past experiences, but I just did not enjoy the food here as much.  Though it was still tasty and there was still a lot of variety, I have to dock this place down to 4 stars for now.  That may change in the future.",kKTcYPz47sCDH1_ylnE4ZQ,0,0,4,dS84yYSHmv1IbkEFI3HHpg
4194938,2011-08-09,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"Carnival World Buffet is about par for course on a low-end casino buffet, but very large and with lots of food, and insanely overpriced. Wait in line for an exceptionally slow and poorly designed kiosk to charge you $20 per person for a buffet, plus tip. The kiosk prompts you for 15 or 20% tip, which is more than what you traditionally pay at a self-service buffet, and there is no option to tip a more conventional 10%.

For your $25 total, you can browse stations ranging from mediocre pizza to burgers to Chinese food. Some of the items are good, particularly the burgers, but for the most part, everything here is only a step or two above fast food, if that. The Mexican food, for example, had quesadillas that I think had American cheese in them with guacamole that consisted almost entirely of sour cream. And breakfast food, curiously, is dispersed across the buffet: waffles might be with the burgers, but eggs are probably next to the Chinese food.

You might be wondering why I checked in twice here. Did I mention you're a captive audience at the Rio? It's off-strip, so unless you want to take a cab somewhere, you're hosed. And I was with a group.

The bottom line is, you're paying $25 for $4 worth of crappy food with an outrageous gratuity for someone who only brings you silverware and a soft drink (alcohol is at a station only).",3KYpsCjlw9Nnxnn2lSbQHg,2,1,1,dGoG-Pcb7JCfN86KyGcgOA

There was an outbreak of the norovirus at the Rio this past weekend, and I assume people were worried that it came from the buffet, because it was dinner time and the place was way less than half full. 

They have a velvet rope where they make you wait before being seated. There were three employees standing there staring at us behind the rope. One of them acknowledged us, asked us how we were doing, and then just stood there and stared. Not even ten feet away was a section with about ten tables for two, and only one of them was occupied. As visible as these tables were to us, they were even more visible to the three employees staring at us. Also visible were the buffet lines, with maybe five people total getting food.

We waited about ten minutes and finally it just grew absurd. We decided to ask for a refund. For $67, at a second-rate off-strip casino, it's ridiculous to make anyone wait. Especially not when the place is basically deserted.

The refund process was a hassle. The employees all took nasty tones with us, and the manager who gave us the refund didn't even apologize for the whole ordeal.

I heard so many great things about The Carnival World buffet from other reviews, sites and even word of mouth.  So for our last trip to Vegas we decided to give it a go, and was extremely disappointed. We did go during peak hours expecting the freshest food but that wasn't the case.

The Good - The service was great! Our server was polite, quick and attentive during a busy evening.  The pork belly was very good!! However once it was gone, it was gone and they didn't refill the tray.  

The NOT So Good - For the $34 price, the value and quality did NOT meet the price. The prime rib was very rubbery tough to cut tough to chew. Asian cuisine was either bland or extremely salty. The sushi wasn't fresh (the rice was stale). Salad bar, even though I had no intent to have salad, had few options with the exception of many dressings to chose from. Most other dishes were bland and most all tasted the same.  The BIGGEST disappointment was dessert!! The selection was minimal, mostly an assortment of cookies and a few cobblers, pies and cakes but nothing that looked amazing. I ended up having a chocolate chip Cookie and a coffee gelato (which was very very good).

I felt so bad as my wife hardly ate and tried different dishes but found each bland or stale. This buffet was NO better than a Golden Corral eww.

Honestly, I am not sure how it won awards in 2014 for best buffets.  Truly a disappointing experience. Save your money on a nice restaurant and if you want a buffet you will truly enjoy,  Go to Aria, the Wynn or Bacchanal at (Best I've been to yet, the desserts OMG) Caesars Palace, pay the $5-$10 extra its night and day!!",AZscY01RgWEdRXYHStW1ng,1,0,2,R1I7pmfmh0H7aXr0-Hn-gw

I've eaten at many of the casino buffets (because my ex loved them) so I can honestly say that this one for years, is still a favorite of mine. Locals who show their Nevada ID get a deal Monday- Thursday only- lunch is $8.50, dinner is $12.50. There is an automated system to pay if you're not a local or if you're not using coupons. Parking is easy if you choose the right one- just outside of the buffet. There are two parking garages on either side of the casino, too. 

Italian, Chinese, Seafood, live action cooking (a line), fresh carved meats like ham and turkey, and finally the extensive desserts station featuring yummy gelato. I have a few favorites like the peel and eat shrimp (lemon and cocktail sauce), the baked chicken, the sio mai (Chinese dim sum), and the gelato. I limit myself to two plates, so as to not overdo it. I try not to load up on starches. My husband likes the fried clams and the crab legs, and thinks the pizza isn't bad. Remember (1) to pace yourself and (2) not everything that is served is good or is to your liking. If I am not sure about a dish, I only get a small amount. There are so many choices here, so it's easy to please many palates. 

The stations are clean and maintained very well (refilled), for the most part. The new plates are plentiful. The people preparing the food wear chef coats and hats to match. The service is pretty good- drinks are refilled frequently and dirty plates are taken away. There is a bar in the middle. The bathrooms are off to the side of the buffet- this is an improvement, used to be out in the casino floor, you had to leave.

Usually, casino buffets are disappointing with lackluster quality. But this one has been a customer favorite for years and for good reason- the food. I'm sure that we will be back soon to take advantage of the Locals Discount.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,4,rsRWxuL9SdBmm5gYuqwVpg

4282968,2012-10-02,3,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"Sooo, all B.S aside....besides working out and trading stocks hitting buffets are probably my third favorite thing to do (yes maybe even more so than skydiving and having sex) so when i say I am the Ron Jeremy of buffets having been around the block and then some, that's no exaggeration. 

After looking at the list of the best buffets in Vegas and seeing the RIO as #7 with one of the more affordable buffets on the list that's what I chose (can't image WTF could possibly be worth justifying an $89 buffet which was the price of #1 on that list). Being the 7th best one could expect some serious quality and selection especially on a Sunday afternoon when the food should be at the pinnacle of perfection. Not the case at all here!!

Let me start by saying the layout of the RIO is pretty ingeniously done by the designers of the buffet to maximize the time and distance the customers have to walk while dining so as to either fill up faster or eat less due to being lazy and having to walk clear to the other side of the dining hall to get more of their favorite dish. Now I am no lazy SOB, I routinely run and bike 100 miles a week but I'll be damned if we didn't get seated on the farthest end of the seafood area which are my favorite foods and had about a 500 ft walk to and from that section just for another plate or 2 of crab. Thing is the crab legs were so weak and small I only had one plate and didn't even bother heading back for another. 
So how's the sushi selection you ask? Well, as one of the other yelper's commented it is typically  less than what you get at most run of the mill mom and pop Chinese buffets for $8-10. Considering the RIO was more than 3 times that price it was downright pathetic!! I am literally talking about maybe 6-7 different types of rolls and that was it! No sashimi, no fancy handmade sushi's....NOTHING! I almost couldn't believe it as usually the sushi section is the one area most buffets go crazy on. So that's strike one for the RIO.

The second thing that immediately pissed me off about this place is the total lack of healthy options featured here. I'd say a solid 70-75% of the items were fried and breaded or literally dripping with fat and buttery sauces. Lets be honest people...anything deep fried is usually pretty low quality and very cheap (think fish sticks, fries, tater tots....etc..) so the more fried items a buffet has typically the more low grade the restaurant is and RIO sure was the case in that respect. The prime rib which I usually hit almost exclusively was 3/4 fat and grizzle (not an exaggeration). Not only that but the man carving the meat gave me a slice that wouldn't have fed a hamster and of course when I laughed and asked for about 3 times that amount he mumbled something, tossed another chunk on my plate and then turned and literally walked away....I mean WTF! I am a 240 lb dude...obviously I am going to eat what I take and you can tell I can EAT by the looks of me. The whole place was so freakin stingy I swear it's as if the managers told the employees that any food wasted or thrown out is coming out of their paychecks. 

Moving on...strike 3 and what solidified a 'never again' at the RIO was the dessert bar. It could be described in one single word....WEAK!!!! Now I am not a big dessert eater and typically only stick to fat free and sugar free desserts and ice creams but I swear, after doing a lap around the ""dessert island"" I am pretty sure Hometown buffet has double the selection and here's the real kicker.....most of the items are behind glass and you have to ask the attendant for everything you want! Once again I understand people take too much and end up wasting food especially kids and dessert I assume is notorious for being taken and tossed but come the fuc* on man. 
I hope your sitting before reading this next one and no.....this is not a joke. They actually served the ice cream in little plastic cups like the ones you fill condiments and sauces with at fast food restaurants. For $32 per person I got handed a fuc*ing 1 oz plastic cup with 1.....yes 1 mouthful of sugar free ice cream. At that point my confusion actually turned into rage at thinking of the $$ my friends and I just dropped and what better options we had access to for much cheaper. 

Most of the negative reviews here are spot on....this place downright SUCKS!!! The food is highly sub par (and my standards are below average at best) so me complaining about service and food means that a restaurant should most likely be condemned and demolished. I would honestly not even go again and waste the gas money even if I were to get a free voucher it was THAT pitiful. Maybe it's gone downhill recently and the 4 and 5 star reviews were from a while ago or perhaps the people that wrote those just won $10k at the slots and were so elated that a box of dog poo would have been given 5 stars....I don't know but I do know that I will never go back to the Carnival buffet at the RIO again.

It was me and my girlfriends first time to Rio and heard so much about the buffet so we check it out, we waited in line for 30 minutes just to pay which was sort of expected since it was new years day but to have only one person working cashier is unreasonable, we finally got seated after an hour of waiting and so we grab our plates and dive in. We grab alot of seafood and sit down to start eating. We waited for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink and he/she was a no show. So we start to eat when suddenly a cockroach crawls out of my lobster mac'n'cheese, disgusted we call over the supervisor. He comes and ask what the problem is and  I proceed to tell him the situation and how I have the pictures to prove it. I show it to him and he apologizes, he grabs the plate with the roach still on it and says he will refund us. He takes our card and then he comes back and says he refunded us the money....... Nope he doesnt so we called today to ask why it hasnt shown up on billing statement and they say they have no records of a refund going back to us and how they can't do anything about it...... Worst Hotel/Casino/Restaurant management ever. I will be having a chat with Health department and showing them the pictures and reciept to prove everything.

All it did was make our entire group angry and everyone vow to never come there again.  Whomever came up with the idea of multiple pay stations and lines all waiting simultaneously to be seated must have been touched and the manager/owner that accepted the plan should be fired or shot.  All I can say is CHAOS!!  

We could clearly see lots of empty tables that were vacant for 10 or more minutes, yet at points the line was not moving at all for long periods of time.  The heat and the noise were incredible.

Once you finally get to the pay station, you are forced to stand in another line waiting for a hostess to seat you.  We watched while they took groups out of other lines multiple times and never even looked at our line.  The whole system is idiotic and not conducive to a nice dining experience.  You could tell that the staff itself was overwhelmed by the way things worked and just didn't care about the customers wait.  No sense of urgency or eye contact.

The last time i was here was about 5 years ago and i heard from some friends that they did a little make over and added alot more food as well. Woah, wait how can they possiby fit anymore food stations in here, they have almost every kind of food knowen to man errr women to be matter of fact! But i guess not!  We decided to start our buffet challange here. And let me tell you when you come to the Carnival make sure you have alot of patience because it takes a little while to actually get seated. When we arrived after paying for our dealio, we stood in line for a good 20-25minutes waiting to be seated along with the other's who were also waiting in line. It seemed like it was slow inside the buffet and there were tables and booths that were open. Maybe they were understaffed that day. There was one hostess who was working the three lines of people. One at a time she would ask how many in the party then let you go, wait another 5 mintues then go to the next line and repeat! Come on lady we have 4 very hungry Yelper waiting to get their hungry hungry hippo on!!!  At last we were finally seated.
Out waiter was nice, took our orders for drinks (non alcoholic). It took him a little while but we finally got our order. If you want alcoholic drinks the bar is located in the middle of the buffet and is pretty reasonable priced. They have drink special just about every half hour as well.

Instead of telling you what i ate: Here are some of the highlights that they have here:

Carving station that serves Prime rib and Ham. I had a slice of both, the prime rib was so overcooked that it was a challange to cut it so i gave up! The ham was cooked prefect and tasted yummy!

Mashed potatoes, ribs, and assorted vegetables

Sushi ( I wouldnt recommend it)

Hush puppies, onion rings, and shrimp,fried fish fillets,taquitos and wings

Anorexic crab legs, peel-and-eat shrimp and Scallops

A full salad bar

Pancakes, Eggs, Waffles, Bagels, Muffins, Lox, Cream Cheese, Omelettes, Hash Browns, Bacon Bacon Bacon!!

Plenty of pasta with various sauces in case you want to make your own

Pizza of all kinds

Egg rolls and various dim sum and even BBQ pork! 

Made-to-order stations were popular and served: 
Pho 
Stir-fry

Tacos that you can build yourself and quesadillas

Desserts:
A gelato bar serves eight different flavors
Various mini cheesecakes
Slices of pie and cakes
Fresh Fruit
Raspberry filled churros
Cookies
Cream Puffs
Bananas foster

They also have alot of sugar free desserts as well!!

The food that I did end up eating were the crab legs (which were tasty), prime rib (a bit dry for my taste), and a few other things (dessert, drink, etc). The food is decent enough for the price since there's a lot of selections to choose from.

I do want to commend our server, his name is Bryan or Bryant, I believe, for a great service. I asked for fruit punch and he informed me that they didn't have that but he would be more than happy to make something similar to it. I tried it and it was pretty good!

Call me a cheapskate, but for $40.00 that is easily a week's worth of groceries that I could buy for my apartment.

Carnival World, much like Limbo, is not bad, but there are many other better buffets in the area. For the price, the selection was dissapointing. ~$20 for lunch and no crab. No crab! NO CRAB! NOOOO CRAB!!!!

Stay away from the sushi. Proper, moist, cooked to perfection sushi rice should not make loud crunching noises when chewed, nor should it require more than five minues to achieve adequate chewing.

The roast beef was however adequately juicy, rare and fatty, but it was one of two saving graces of the buffet. The other being the gelatto. I nearly achieved inebriation attempting to get my money's worth from the tiramisu. Liqueur alert!

My friend said she didn't want to spend more than $20 on a buffet.  This one was something like $17 for lunch. Perfect! Off we went to the Rio on the last day.

Since, we were getting on the plane that afternoon, all my hard working out for Vegas could now be put to rest.  There were no more swimsuits to be worn and I was ready to full-on pig out!

I had:

-Mac and cheese salad
-Shrimp salad
-Cauliflower
-Cod
-Mussels and clams with a creamy sauce
-Orzo salad
-Phad thai
-Shrimp cocktail
-Spanish rice
-A variety of sushi rolls
-Fish ball udon
-Spaghetti with marinara sauce
-Chips and guac
-Yakisoba-to-order bar
-Coconut ice cream, chocolate ice cream


The food wasn't quite as good as the Wynn, but the Wynn buffet was also $40.  For $17, I was quite satisfied.   The sushi rolls were a little dinky but I was  happy they had fish ball udon! The ice cream was also pretty good.

If you're looking for a nicely-decorated buffet restaurant, this isn't it.  The plates are kind of an ugly design and this isn't a super fancy hotel, but whatever.

Been coming to this buffet in Rio since before I was of legal gambling age. On my recent visit, it's safe to say that this place hasn't really changed... and I'm ok with that.

They have a large variety of food. Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, southern, and good ol' fashioned American food. Their variety is so large, in fact, that you kind of have to portion yourself on each ""country"" you visit in this buffet, especially if you want to hit each ""country.""

Granted, food quality isn't as high as Wicked Spoon, but it's enough to satisfy.

On my recent visit, they had a noodle station. Highly recommend their udon. It's not the best udon in the world, but it's pretty good.

Their desserts are meh. Pies and cakes have that defrosted quality to them. But they have gelato! And they serve big scoops as well.

Staff on my last visit was very friendly and kept our tables clean of used plates.

All-in-all, this place will definitely do the trick, especially if you're staying in the hotel.

My brother-in-law and family was also meeting us so the only way to sit together was to pay up front for all six meals before they arrived.  When the host was seating us she told me that I had not paid for their child even though our ticket said 5 plus 1.  We asked to sit near the crab legs before she sat us because of my mother-in-laws recent knee surgery and it turned out to be all the way across the buffet.  The bottom of the chair on the bench seat kept falling off so we asked to be moved and that took about 20 minutes of complaining and finally having to stop a manager to get moved.  The same host came back to relocate us but set up a table for only 5 and when I asked she said it was because we had only paid for 5 and not the child.  Again we had to get a manager and go to the register to prove we had paid for 6 people. After all this the manager then comped us the child due to all the trouble we were having.

One of the best varieties anywhere but most of the food is still mediocre, but some stuff is better than others.

Had a brunch here on saturday before leaving vegas. $24 for brunch - not bad. The quality has improved. The selections are just as wide. From one end to the other end, there were no repeats of items. 

Although the desserts were a lot to choose from, but it was just okay. I say, stick to the gelato only. 
the orange juice was those concentrated ones.. not fresh. That or it was just watered down.. unlike at buffet places like The Wynn or Bellagio their orange juices taste VERY orangy.. i can even taste the pulps at The Wynn buffet.

Anyway.. you can't compare Rio's Carnival World Buffet to The Wynn's or the Bellagio. But you do get what you pay for and i say it's worth it. I'd come back here again... just take the shuttle from Paris or Harrah's to get here if you don't want to pay taxi fee or don't have a car.",Vp5DzIiP_MmaMZMZVFFltA,12,12,4,qWUz6YGMZGK-S7xi9JUuPA

If you're looking for a generic buffet, this one will definitely do the trick. I will say the dessert island was pretty tasty.

For some reason there is a magnet at the Rio that always has me coming back.  As far as my memory can take me, I think this is the only buffet I've ever been to in Vegas.  But then again, memories don't really exist in Vegas due to the consumption of mass quantities of alcohol.

Hadn't been here in YEARS, like I'm talking back when I was here in high school was the last time I had been here, soooo 5 years, give or take some years (it leaves my age ambiguous).

Walking in to get to your table is like finding your way through a maze.  Seriously, it took us almost five minutes.  And then, the worst part of it is when you're drooling out of the corner of your mouth with a completely stacked plate of food in hand, you can't find where you were sitting!  I wanted to just plop down in the middle of the floor and start eating with my hands. 

I think between my boyfriend and I we had about 9 plates of food plus more than enough servings of dessert.

Because we went at a time that was slow, some of the food went quite some times sitting in the same tray. Makes the food look very unappetizing. 

Other than that, the buffet was great. I do think Bacchanal Buffet is better but this one is a close 2nd in terms of best buffets I've gone to. 

I will be back in the future simply because I really enjoyed the Pho and the great service.",dxjehLpGgh08vby2BksV6g,2,0,4,oBPK4W95LVIPENrgj80oWw

For the price, this is an above average buffet.  They serve Pepsi and not coke.  Had to get that out of the way.

They have made to order omlets, fresh pancakes, bacon, muffins and a host of other foods for breakfast. 

For lunch, it's the fried chicken (tastes like Venetian Room service), tacos, pizza, noodle station (won-ton, pho, undon, bird drop).  They even have a station where you can pick your own veggies and their will stir fry it on the spot with your choice of beef, chicken, or shimp.  There is baked fish, battered fish, battered shrimp, and fried clams strips.  They have an Asian area.  Don't forget the french fries, cris cut fries, onion rings, and burgers.  There is a bar for mix drinks.  And two styles of ribs.  There is a carving station with ham, turkey, etc.

The dessert bar is yummy.  Fresh pies, great tasting velvet cake, cookies, and home made gelato.

I would say this is a good buffet for people who like regular tasting foods.  I usually go to the Bellagio buffet but I don't usually eat the high end items like shrimp, foi gras, etc.

Just make sure your server is not named Wally.  He is the worst.  I would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for him.  Also make sure the host doesn't try to seat you near the entrance (by the dessert bar).  They seem to always steer people in that direction and there is a lot of traffic in that area.  JUST SAY NO!

Right now, they are running a promo where local residents of Las Vegas get meals for half price.  That is better than any coupon they had you on the strip.

If they say your server is named Wally (hispanic guy), JUST SAY NO!  He is slow, disappears, doesn't refill your drinks, forgets your instructions.  Got him in November and make sure that my future trips weren't ruined by him.  Also tracked his service levels on my future visits to make sure I wasn't singling him out.  CONFIRMED, he is the worst!  Thought he was partying at night but crap service is in his DNA.

My whirlwind journey through Las Vegas ended at what I had hoped to be the ""world's best buffet"" (at least that's what the billboard said). Instead I ended up with a raunchy, gut-busting round of queasiness. Both before and after the meal.

If the nightmare of the congested self-pay line wasn't enough to send you running, the depressing atmosphere and the equally depressing-looking food will have you demanding a refund. The dining area attempts to set a mood with deeply colored furniture and requisite ambient lighting, but fails miserably as it actually feels like a dark and dank dungeon--reminder that you are in for an inescapable, nonrefundable world of hurt. Sampling a little bit from every corner, I found the dim sum (particularly the sui mai and har gow) to be bland, barely lukewarm, and... rubbery? The quesadillas were cold and, the pancakes were soggy (even before I put syrup on them), the crab legs were forgettable... in fact most of the food was forgettable as I can honestly not remember what else I ate. I filled up 5 plates with sad looking food that, for the most part, made me pretty sad to eat.

I know what you all are thinking: it's the Carnival ""World"" Buffet and it deserves props for combining American, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, etc. cuisine. But couldn't it, and in fact shouldn't it, be executed *better*?",Q8HEI1l4PMDZ-VV-Z-PFjQ,2,1,1,wyrEIBY9nF70xnV3GG_LZg

Unlike other buffets, the service here was so friendly. I was unfamiliar with using one of the tools to eat crabs and I asked our waiter and he kindly showed it to us. He didn't just describe the process, but he literally got his hands dirty and showed us how to use it. To me, that's great service. He didn't have to do it, but he did.

The food overall was good, and you can't really say it's the best, since there are reigning champions like the Wynn and the Belagio. But for the price, this price is pretty good. And if you get the Buffet of Buffets deal ($49.99 for your choice of 6 buffets, within 24 hours, but you can get a discount for $5 per person if you join the total rewards member. This brings your price down to $49.99), this place is incredibly cheap and it is worth going. Out of the 6 buffet choices, I would say this is easily one of the better ones. Don't even attempt going to Imperial Palace one...That one is a little iffy (even though that was our main hotel, heh). 

Would I come again? YES. But not for the given price however. I will most likely do the Buffet of Buffets deal again. Much better deal and I can pig out and eat all day if I want to.",6vh6Y2IweWQahC75wZjWBg,1,0,4,Eug_Lqo_yOvgcQstrE_mxQ

I will say this, it is my favorite buffet in Vegas and with locals only paying $12.99 for dinner... its one of the best values in town! I love that there is a wide selection of items to choose from so you never get bored with eating the same thing. Some days its their made to order teppanyaki bar (amazing) and other days its the Prime Rib (best in town) and heck, why not throw in a corndog (its only a corndog) for good measure? The place has what seems like an unlimited array of items to choose from so even the pickiest eater should be able to find something. 

What impresses me the most is that the service is usually very good. Drinks are always full, plates are cleared in a timely manner and the people serving are generally in a good mood. Its not like at another buffet where the meat nazi was cutting off tiny portions of flank steak and was irritated when you asked for more... I'm 6ft, 200lbs I can eat more then that... hello, I think I burned more calories standing in line than what Im gonna get out of that little slab of so called meat... but I digress. We even have one waiter that gives my GF a little bit of a hard time because she gets the same thing every time we are there... I like a place that can have fun and serve good food.

Q: Buffets are disgusting. Why would you go?
A: Because of the plates and plates and plates of food you can get at the cost of a single 8 oz. New York steak at a upscale steak place. If there's something disgusting about boatloads of food at low prices, then I guess I'm disgusting.

Q: I hear this place is MASSIVE how do I approach it?
A: With a well-organized plan. Without a game plan you're going to be running around like a chicken with its head cut off and then it'll be a hassle and then you'll run to your computer and log-in to Yelp and write about how much you hate it.

Stroll around the place first. Get the lay of the land. Then start at each sector and get a plate of food. Work on it. Then go back to the next sector. Carry on.

Q: What is your record?
A: I'm pretty sure it's 6 full plates of food. Plus some dessert. Tip: Drink water; soda will just fill you up.

FYI ... There are shuttles from various casinos that go to the Rio. Huh? Which casinos have the shuttle? How the hell should I know. I'm not a concierge.",jjHcf6XWMU7LmOEeUc9dqA,2,3,4,QAlXcSbq9i74WP2FWlkoLQ

They had a wide selection of asian food but a lot of the flavors were a hit or miss. I had a whole bunch of different stuff..and looking back I don't even know how I held all that food down. Nothing really wowed me in flavor wise because it was like mmmm there's something better than that. Dessert was probably the best part. The mango sorbet was bomb and the pies were delicious.

It's overwhelming enough to see how far from one end to another all that food is laid out and served. What makes it stand out is their crab legs. (Except, for some reason there weren't any when my friend and I went there on January 12, 2012 - it was a thursday) People pile them up in a cute little mountain on their plates! If they are a bit hard, there's always a cracker around, just ask one of the servers. 

Other than the legs, I couldn't get enough of the scallops in the deep fried section (they're my favourite), roast beef (which was cooked just right), fettucine, you name it. However, I'm quite the sweet-tooth so I prefer not to binge on entrees to save up on tummy space for dessert. If you're into dessert as well, you will not be disappointed. They have a whole area for it, even a gelato stand! My favourite was the tiramisu and chocolate where I'd sprinkle it with m&ms and granola afterwards. Sadly, I was sick the last time I went there so I distanced myself from the cold choices and stuck with their mini-hazlenut pies which were to die for, bread pudding wasn't bad either. 

Despite the price, (it would cost about $20-ish each on average but locals get half off - I think) you could count on quality and unlimited portions. 'Stuff yourself till you drop'!

We wait in line, go to pay and the idiot (they hire a lot of them) says no locals discount on Sat, WHAT? I let her know I called ahead I was told there was a discount, let me speak to your manager.
 She then pretended to call on the phone and a radio she never actually spoke to anyone ""sorry manager is not available for the next 20 mins"" are you kidding me???? Talk about NO customer service, 

The Rio USED to be all about locals, guess what? Not anymore way to go we live here and would frequent more often. The Buffet was good but not $30 a person good. So for now this local says see ya!

When we were there, there was no line to speak of. 

Really loved:
country fried steak- so soft, and not overly salty!
fried fish and fried shrimp- rich and fresh
shrimp- easy to eat, delicious
crab legs- may be skinny and small, but the meat is sweet and the meat is not that hard to get to.
cheesecake- I wish I grabbed another one.
bread pudding- I accidentally put a slice of country fried steak on top of this, and it was surprisingly very good together. 

Avoid (this list is short, no worries):
red velvet cake- yuck. Not special in any way. Save the space for something else. But seriously, this was not very good. That's ok, because most of the other desserts were pretty good, but I felt like I needed to say something about this.
Salisbury steak- too tough. I couldn't eat it at all. 

Some things, like the salmon sushi, were just okay. They have a very small selection of sushi. In fact, their selection of Asian food was pretty laughable. 

I've also eaten here in the past, and I noticed that as you get your mimosa refills, they tend to get stronger and stronger. I only had one this time around (because I had a long car ride back to the Bay Area right after).

4669623,2010-07-20,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"I remember coming to this buffet as a child. Ignorance is truly bliss when you're a child. You can't distinguish between bad food and good tasting food. Being able to just enjoy McDonalds, without being drunk.

@ Snow Crab - Its just crab, nothing spectacular about them. Doesn't have the fresh or sweetness taste to them. Unlike the Wynn or Bellagio, the Rio doesn't split the legs in half for you. One of the waiter gave me a tool to assist in splitting the crab legs, but the tool was worthless.

@ Prime Rib - The staple meat at buffet that actually delivers. It came out nice and red, as it should be. Now this isn't as good as Lawrys, but it was acceptable for a buffet. If it wasn't for this, I would have felt jipped here.

@ Sushi (California, Shrimp, Salmon, Tuna) - Disgusting. You can find better sushi at a gas station in Baker when you're heading to Vegas.

@ Pho - You get more flavor eating rice crackers seasoned with salt and pepper. The noodle was a mushy mess and the broth was probably made using beef powder to get the beef broth. The beef was sitting in the pool of water, letting it sit there to get well done, aka burn to a crisp beef.

@ Mashed Potatoes - It wasn't the worst I had, but it was pretty bad. Need a little more seasoning or butter.

@ Salmon - This was a salmon steak that the ""chefs"" just brought out. it was so hard that I was considering giving it to one of our neighbor juveniles instead of using rocks. It'll still break windows when you throw the salmon at it, but at least its biodegradable!

@ Lasagna - Just last week I had the lasgna you get from Costco. That stuff tasted a lot better than the stuff here. It just lacks the meat or cheeses for it to truly be a good. Garfield disapproves of this dish. 

@ Mussels - This was in some black bean sauce. It had a funky spicy kick. The sauce just overpowered the taste of the mussels.

@ Velvet Cake - This was almost redder than my prime rib. It was good however. 

@ Brownie - I think the NHL accidentally delivered hockey pucks to the Rio. It did taste fine once you're able to break it up and get it into your mouth.

@ Carrot Cake - One of the better deserts here. You can just taste a hint of the carrot and the cake was just moist and delicious. 

@ Chocolate Cake - This was some weird tasting chocolate cake. Pass. 

@ Coconut Gelato - I love coconut and this was my favorite gleato out of the bunch. 

@ Tirmasu Gelato - This is coffee, not tirmasu. I don't like coffee, so I didn't like this gelato at all. 

@ Oreo Gelato - They went a little overboard on the cookies, you can't even taste the gelato.

@ Coconut Cream Pie - It was just okay. Not great or bad.

@ Cream Puff - Yum. Similar to the ones you find in Asian bakeries on Spring Mountain.

@ Lemonade / Ice Tea - The drinks that comes with the dinner just tasted weird. It just didn't taste right. I tried 3 different glasses of drink and it all tasted the same. Can't even execute something as simple as flavored sugar water.

I did use my locals discount which was suppose to be good for a 2 for 1 or 50% off your buffet. Instead, our party of 3 got 50% for everyone, so our total came out to $36 or $12 per person. For $12 this buffet is worth it, otherwise I wouldn't spend $25 at this buffet. I rather go to a regular restaurant for $25 and get better food.

Our server was truly nice, but even he can't do much if the quality of food just sucks. I noticed the plates weren't really that clean, with a noticeable dark sheen on it, gross! The floors wasn't swept when food fell down. The buffet area wasn't wiped clean. I stepped on some kind of desert. Gross.

For half off, its not a bad deal eating here. At full price, just avoid Vegas buffets and go to like Cheesecake Factory instead. If you want to do buffet, do Studio B or the Wynn buffet.

It's a solid choice. I'd say for the price it's a great value and in terms of quality it's only slightly less than the Buffet at the Wynn and a whole lot better than the buffet at the Mirage. 
The food is pretty good and the selection is varied here, especially at a dinner price of $23.99.

When we went at about 8:30pm there was a huge line but it moved pretty smoothly partially due to the fact that we played Tap Tap Revenge on the iPhone. However, once we used the automated pay stations (mandatory if you aren't planning on paying with your Rio room key) we were stalled at the front of the line with only a flimsy velvet rope between us and an intense session of stuffing our faces. What was lame was that they hold you up for apparently no reason as most of the seats were empty and you have to stand there staring at a fully stocked dessert bar. 
It made me yearn for the time I went to this buffet and was able to walk right in thanks to a friend's uncle being of Platinum status at the Rio casino. This time I was one of the poor saps waiting instead.

There's three things I really like about this buffet:
1) Crab legs. 
2) Great service. The waiters pretty much hover around and make sure you're completely satisfied. One of them even cleaned our table while we went back for food but left my unfinished crab legs on one plate then added another so that I could put the shells on it. Nice.
3) The gelato bar. 
I keep coming back to this buffet is for the Gelato Bar. Though all the flavors are nice, you must try vanilla creme for it is insanely good.

Two things I don't like:
1) The Rio is off the strip.
2) Waiting.

this buffet does have a lot more variety than most of the other ones i've had. however quality is really lacking.

although the things i did try were decent. the crab legs aren't half bad. most crab legs i've had in various buffets were too salty and lacked flavour. but the crab legs here were rather tasty. the shrimp cocktails were alright. a little small, but it didn't taste rancid at least. i got 2 plates worth of them!

the prime rid was pretty decent too. well seasoned. roast beef was a lil too well cooked for my taste but it was ok. i also tried the short ribs that was swimming in oils....i should've gotten a second serving of prime rib.

the chinese food didn't look good,  so i didn't give it a try. the mussels and garlic buttered clams were aite. 

the clam chowder looked so gross...the ny steak was way too hard.

however the dessert menu was kind of, unappetising. i tried the no sugar added chocolate mousse thing with banana? that was pretty decent. the pumpkin cheesecake was stale. the gelato was pretty good. the churros were nasty. 

tip: get a coupon. we got a 25% off from staying at flamingo (purchased the coupon-savings room) it's pretty worth it with the coupon

this buffet has everything, you could walk off some room in your stomach just by walking the span of the food counters. some of my favs..  their crab legs are yummy... fresh and not too salty. there's also a stir fry like station where you choose your own ingredients and an asian soup station with the same choose your own ingredients. i had the tom yum soup and put my own fish balls, chicken, etc. yum!. for dessert, they have gelato. there's also a bar where you can purchase cheap alcohol/cocktail drinks, but it wasn't very strong.",hM3eIi3WXzQLCrl8ykcyjg,0,0,5,gKbyJ_GMGeSrkr92DT_qdA

I chose the RIO for the buffet because it is located off the strip and I was able to get a deal at the Tix4Tonight booth downtown.  For $2 per person, we were able to get a voucher to bring the price down from $33 per person to $19.99 per person.
They have a large selection, Asian food, Mexican food, carving station, and crab legs.  The cold crab was CRAZY salty and the hot crab smelled a little ""off"".
They have a nice dessert station.

2nd of 5 - the carnival buffet at the Rio.

It's difficult to go to a buffet for dinner when you just had buffet for lunch, but I wasn't about to back down from the Rio buffet; even if there was an hour and a half wait time...

Meat here was good. I liked getting prime rib here. The first slice however, was sub-par. I think I got the tail end of an old piece.  But after that, it was a solid 6/10 for flavor; 8/10 for tenderness and texture.

Crab legs - I didn't eat any. They were ones you had to crack open with tools. I got lazy and stuck to the prime rib. But they have crab legs if you want to work for it.

Desserts: their desserts were good, but no crem brule... If you like gelato, they've got that, but I wasn't too impressed. 5/10 here for desserts.

Drinks - good standard array of sodas, hot drinks and teas. Nothing special.

Service - excellent, but it might depend on your server. I had a really nice fellow by the name of Kevin. He's been working at the Rio for 20 years an he does a good job. I gave him an extra tip for his service. 10/10.

With that said, the lines were even LONGER than usual, but it's Vegas, the lines for the buffets, except for breakfast are always long.  For some people, people don't like to get up for early morning buffets; probably still recovering from the previous night of partying/gambling/dabauchery :)  

Vegas is Vegas; so parking - enough said; and Service - well, it's Vegas, just like with gambling, the house has the edge and it's hit and miss for us patrons :)

So now onto my FOOD reviews....

The Carnival World buffet, once you get past the line(again for breakfast; at roughly 8:30AM there was NO line at all, but less of a selection as well, so it's better to go for the latter of the two meals) is probably one of the most comprehensive ones as far as food coverage.  They sample such a variety of things that it's tough to remember them all, but from east to west, it's mostly there.  Pasta, to steak and prime rib, to asian food, to salad to dessert.   Usually, the food is pretty good, but with any buffet, especially one that's literally catering to about 1000 people per day, it won't be the best quality.   Esp when it comes to items such as seafood or meat on the rare-side...everything tends to be on the more-cooked side; I'm assuming simply to avoid lawsuits for food poisoning on things of that matter...  Anyway, probably one of the bigger buffets available.  My advice, a little of everything goes a long long way :)

The place is pretty huge, so there's more than enough room to seat a large party; you'll just have to wait a little bit.  I would recommend to just break your party up into a couple of smaller groups and see if you can get seated near each other, usually works wonders.",mteJOlja359dj7XYQnKzCg,0,0,4,Hjy3ksz8VyaxzgWiSuxLwA

With the buffet of buffet pass ($64.99) you can eat at 6-7 buffets within a 24 hours period. No limits ... go as much as you want. Some buffets like the Village Seafood ($15 - Rio) and Bacchanal ($25 - Caesar's) have a surcharge but this Rio Carnival. So if you're looking to extend your dollar at bit, buy the BoB pass to save money on this buffet and also get to eat at other places for free within a 24 hour period. 

So what do I think about this buffet? 

I'll put it bluntly. There's no way in hell I'd pay even $20 for this buffet. 

This is only a fill up your stomach kind of place. It looked and tasted on par with a Golden Coral style. The sushi was simple but you could tell it had been sitting for a while. The shrimp were small and limp. There was prime rib but it seemed dry. The mexican food here was the only thing above average. From what I hear, this place used to be inviting and delicious but it not special anymore and I'd rather pay for the Bellagio buffet or highly recommend you try someplace else on the BoB pass.

The possibilities are literally endless with the pre-made selection of foods or the several build your own stations.  My favorite was the Japanese noodle area where I had stir fry customized just for me.  My husband's favorite was the gelato station where he had 10 generous scoops of ice cream in one sitting (yes, he was part of the unnecessary gorging I was talking about earlier) and that was after he ate TONS of food.

But seriously, buffet food is buffet food.  While there is nothing super special about this buffet, I did like the HUGE selection, the gelato (which was served in the small size little cups which were perfect as sometimes just a few bites is all you need to save room for other deserts), and the service!  The place was dead as it was time to close in an hour, but still, we were impressed with the delivery of the drinks and removal of plates.

The food was 100% comfort food.  Nothing super special, but a solid selection and tasty.  Sometimes I think buffets try to get to fancy up-scale with their food, and that's not always something I'm looking for.

When you do go to the front of the line you have to pay through an atm looking machine that you give money to instead of the other way around.  I found it kind of annoying.  I think that's why the line moved so slow.  It's everyone trying to figure out how to use the dang machine. 
As soon as you pay though.  You get seated pretty quick and the feast begins.  At the time, they served mimosas for brunch.  Our server made sure the mimosas kept flowing.  He also made sure we had plenty of water with ice.  I made sure that we tipped him good before we left.
As far as the buffet goes.  It was awesome.  My wife is not a big buffet person and she even loved it.  They pretty much have anything you could want at a buffet for brunch.
I had the asian pork ribs, prime rib and shrimp cocktail.  So good.  After two plates I was full.  I was kind of bummed because I couldn't eat anymore.

The renovation is nice, modern- I remember when it was all pink and had like hot air balloons and ""rio/samba"" kind of decor. I like this a lot better.

So most people go for the crabs and today they were fresh and just as good as the Rio Seafood Buffet (duh! same casino, same supplier). I like that ""peel n eat"" cocktail shrimps here have a slit on the top where you can peel the shrimp in one easy motion. A lot of people go for the carved meats- had the prime rib and it was good. They also had ham, turkey and a beef roast as well but wasn't feeling like trying. The little sake maki (salmon sushi) was fresh today. 

Odd standouts- a shrimp and crab salad that had firm mango chunks and a spicy mayo....I put this on a bread roll and was actually a good of a seafood sandwich. 

Oh, and I did coconut gelato with bananas foster on top and that was bomb. Took bites out of other things that looked good- but they didn't taste so great. 

Like every buffet there were hits, okay, and misses. That's the usual, but here there's a decent ratio of good over the bad. Now is it $23.99 worth of good items? I don't think so. It's good, but far from the best buffet in Vegas.

 I think with the 2 for 1 special or the Locals 50% off Mon-Thurs deal, it's a good value and worth it. If I had to pay full price- I would upgrade myself a few more dollars to eat at Wynn or Bellagio. There I feel I can get more bang for my buck. 

Food I guess is about a 3, but I'll bump it to a 4 star because I think it's a nice thing they do a good deal for locals....what other place does any kind of promotion like that? To my knowledge, this is the only. I much rather eat here at the 50% off price point than any of the buffets in that lower price range like the Station Casinos.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,3,4,Jyf1RgNsbkHwJiocB498Yg

Ambiance: 3 - This buffet is always very clean at its stations and very organized. At the tables, not so much. Tables are rather scattered, disorganized and a bit dirty when you sit down. 

Service: 4 - Our server was very good and extremely funny. He really always took care of us, constantly refilling our drinks and even getting us extra plates when one of us ate some crabs or crawfish! 

Food: 2 - The only things really worth eating at this buffet was crab and dessert. But this time, even the crab legs were just sub-par, only having a little bit of meat inside. The rest of the food was just average--there's really nothing that I can say because, well, nothing really stood out!

Carnival used to be a better, cheaper buffet with bigger crab legs and with slightly better food! But now, going to Village Seafood Buffet is just a way, way better idea than spending that money at Carnival.",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,7,5,3,J9gaAfNmqGuWNoYGfDq3pA

5067306,2010-09-03,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"What's the first things you think of when you talk about Vegas? For most it's gambling, drinking all night, Elvis, and all you can eat buffets. Now there used to be a day when you could come to Vegas, pay $30 for a hotel room, and $6 for the buffet. In which you gorged yourself to the point that you wouldn't want to eat for the rest of the day. The concept of this was so that you could spend less money on the food and lodging and more on the gambling.

But those days are gone....

The buffet will cost about $25 a person but I'm told that if you look around there are ways to get two-fers and discounts. The value is pretty decent, though and when you walk inside you'll see it. The buffet itself is as long as a football field. Seriously, it's that massive from end-to-end. And the menu ranges from your typical buffet affair (prime rib, salad, etc) to even a sushi bar and wood-fired pizza. What also makes this buffet a bit different is that there is an alcohol bar that, if you pay attention will offer $1 drinks every half hour or so.

The quality of the food is good but I'd avoid getting there at the end of one meal session and the turnover of another if you want the freshest stuff. Some things are constant, but the menu items do change between meals so they usually stop refilling about 30 minutes before the change.

The service was really good. Our drink server, despite being very busy, was attentive. My beverage was never empty and when I shifted from a soft drink to coffee (as I do for dessert), she didn't grumble one bit. The best part, though, was at one visit I had arrived late. At other buffets, they'll warn you that you only have a few minutes and then kick you out (or charge you the higher meal price). My server let me know of the change but despite me paying for breakfast, I was allowed to stay through to lunch. 

The Carnival World Buffet is an amazing buffet and one of the best on the strip. A must when you visit and come with a hearty appetite. But make sure you can dedicate a couple hours to eating or you won't be able to experience fully. 

Four Stars based on:
Awesome selection
Great service
Decent quality

If the regular price had been less, this would have been Five Stars.",F4_zHEXU1p5E12A2o-5_ZQ,0,0,4,y3ddEtyO3ON8WX423Nivrw
5073259,2010-10-31,6,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"I just got back from this place with my bread queen merely 4 hours ago, and I'm still full. This was the original reason why I went to Vegas this weekend, not to celebrate the end of finals, not to take the opportunity of having a free hotel room in Mirage, but to show my beloved bread queen what an international buffet looked like. It didn't disappoint at all. 

Still full from a big ass brunch from the unflavorful Flavors buffet at Harrah's, we decided to commit one of the seven deadly sins, gluttony, here. When I usually eat out at a buffet, I get only the things I like the most, but after being converted from picky to foodie, I journeyed to try and to finish everything that the buffet had to offer. Mission over-accomplished. 

Ranging from italian, american, comfort, chinese, japanese, and bread cuisine, this place has it all. The only thing wrong today was a temperature issue. Quality of all the food we had was great, even the bountiful desserts. Our server was also way friendlier and livelier than our morning server. I ate about 7 plates of food, probably consumed over 5000 calories here alone, but it was all worth it. To top it all off, we had the booth nearest to the buffet line of the Diamond area so no interruptions was present.

Must tries:
Prime Rib - my girl was tripping out on how it melts in your mouth, literally
BBQ and Regular Ribs - not fall of the bone tender, but flavorful enough to satisfy the masses
Korean BBQ Ribs - can't go wrong wherever this is given
Honey Baked Ham - it's sweet meets savory 
Shrimp - butterflied and flavorful without marinara
Shrimp Pizza - as a shrimp lover... must I say more?
Any fried food - these guys know how to fry no joke

Stay away from:
Corn Dog - it didn't even taste fried, and the casing of the hot dog was rubbery and strong
Sushi - not quality sushi, plus there's other things better to eat here
Comfort Food Area - you won't weigh the same after visiting this part of the buffet...
Dessert Bar - everything is addicting, especially the apple crisp and bread pudding (top it off with granola...)

After eating, I was snapping my fingers and clapping my heels together wishing I was in bed. Full off my mind, I wasn't able to finish my last plate full of sweets, I honestly didn't know what I was eating by the 6th plate. My girl was also full off of her mind, and getting up was already a mission to do. For 25 bux a head, this is way worth it, plus the quality of food, unmatched by other buffets.",REtj8oh7W3D5Icdo8WRKWw,2,2,4,iBycXZrDwiqTuWAy7N0EFA

However the food itself was slightly under whelming for lunch. There was nothing really there, there was roast beef there was some ham and that's about it for a buffet in Vegas.

note to self: do not show up during lunch time. the line is loooooooong. 1.5 hrs loooooooong.

anyhow, there are LOTS to choose from - and it really sucks not being seated in the middle as it's quite a distance to grab your food and get back to your seat. as with any buffet-style restaurant, all you can do is sample, and boy did i sample.

eggs/hash/sausage bacon - eh. not a lot of flavor [except for the bacon because it's bacon!]
fried stuff [shrimp/onion rings/fish] - nothing special. tastes like old fast food. pass on it.
mexican - i had a taco. eh.
prime rib and roast beef - bloody. not a meat restaurant so i couldn't be picky.
shrimp/flavored shrimp/crab legs - i love seafood. unless this shit went bad, it probably tastes the same as any other place. enjoyed it a lot.
asian soup - they had pho so i had to get it. tastes like ramen. i imagine all the other soups would taste the same.
sushi - or more like fake rolls. pass.
asian food - very picky in this department- didn't need to even try it. pass.
dim sum - eh. shui mai - i'm not a good judge of 'dim sum'. tasted good enough for me
greens - please, it's vegas and i'm on vacation.

now the dessert section, on the other hand, is a different story. i think the guys that prepared the dessert actually spent time making them look presentable. they tasted as sweet as they look, if not sweeter. i sampled a lot. i probably enjoyed the gellato the most. it soothes a full stomach.

Not only is it a disappointment for all the paying guests who come to dine wanting some prime rib, but it's a waste of food.

I should post a video of the amount of people who walk up to the station and then take a look at the meat and walk away. 

You guys seriously need to take a look at what you are doing to your prime rib. The guy had 3 full prime ribs up there and each one looked like it had been stuck in a dehydrator for 3 days.

Last time our waitress brought us one glass each and the place was packed. Maybe the service is more distant on weekdays? I'll give it to our guy though, he had a lot of tables to attend to since they have less help on weekdays.

The food was mediocre at best. The prime rib was really tough and incredibly difficult to cut without having to cut so hard the plate would move. I liked the station where I was able to make tacos myself the best. Also, the freshly fried chicken wings were good too. Just make sure the batch you get just came out or else the meats really tough. I plated myself some spinach salad and the stems of the spinach were really tough as well. The ranch tasted watered down also. Like it's not hard enough being healthy?!

 If you don't get lucky the line can be very ,very long. We got lucky this time but once the line was around the world and we felt like crying from sore feet by the time they seated is, consider yourself warned.
 The selections are mixed quality wise. Lots of ""fillers"" as in fried foods and breads, there are better dishes you have to look in between.
  The line of food options is HUGE, it wraps along the back wall in a gigantic semi circle with a dessert station in the middle. Since it is so big you feel as if you are working or hunting for your food. And the choices vary a lot so pace yourself or just get a small item to hold you over while you look before you actually eat. 
 If you love all American fried food, you'll love the onion rings and that type of stuff. There was a small salad bar waaay at the other end from where we were, and some soups , barbecue stuff, some potatoes, Mexican, Chinese, Meat cutting station ( the meat was heavily marinated in something that scared me enough not to eat it since msg and some tenderizers bother me), Italian (mediocre lasagne, some pasta...) , Seafood ( fake scallops and thin crab legs ), and I don't even remember what else. Since it is a ""world"" buffet I would have preferred Japanese, Filipino.. Cuban, or Indian or Greek as a choice too, something different . Buffets always have Mexican and Chinese...very unoriginal... sheesh. 
 It's loud and may possibly have kids all over the place so I would not recommend for date night.

They gave us one! Wow!!! We have KRISTINA from Poland as our server and I approached her to ask if Carnival does birthday plate(desserts with happy bday on it) just like in Studio B at M Resort and she said no :( ... I said that's ok, thank you. So we started eating and a few minutes later she came back with a plate full of dessert with a pie on the middle with a little candle (how sweet!) and we even sing happy bday :) ... That was a very nice extra effort and a very good customer service! Thank you so much Kristina from Poland!

5199233,2013-02-22,25,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"A four star rating from me for a buffet is like the spotting of a Crested Ibis - rare and special. I generally avoid buffets, as I haven't met many I like, but I know my husband has been on a quest for snow crab legs. And, it occurred to me that IF Carnival World had snow crab that with the locals discount (Nevada ID and Total Rewards card required) of 50% off (meaning $15/person) it could be the crab gold mine he has dreamed of.

So, I mentioned the possibility to him. He called and spoke with the very helpful manager Art Pepper who confirmed they did indeed have snow crab legs, and we were on our way.

The line appeared long, but it went quickly, and our locals discount was processed without a hitch. Again, if you're a local, this is $15/person currently!

The buffet options spread out so far that you actually decide half way down the line you need to go sit down and come back later for the other half. They offer everything from corn dogs to a Build Your Own Asian soup station, so I honestly believe you can make everyone happy here.

My husband ate about 4lbs of crab legs, so they must have been aok.

My personal highlight was the tartar sauce. I wanted to just eat a tub of that, but had to find something to dip it in, so I opted for some fried shrimp and an onion ring. I am only kind of joking. The carved meats were all juicy, and if you enjoy prime rib, that's included. Everything appeared fresh, and I did not have one item that I spit out. 

My biggest disappointment was the sesame ball. It was dry and the red bean paste was uninspiring to say the least, so I had to wash it down with some delicious strawberry sorbet. Our tea glasses stayed full, and we got to meet Art Pepper in person. He looks just like his name sounds, and we just wanted to come up with something to say to him, so I told him I loved the tartar sauce. I am pretty sure he thought we were crazy, but oh well.

No complaints about the variety.

But certainly about the quality of food -- yes, it's a buffet, and the rigors of long and heated mass-quantity portions means you aren't going to get Mario Batali quality, but more often than not the food came up cold by the time you got back to your seat,  or in the case of most of the Asian noodles,  overdrenched with oil and inedible.

 After visiting Vegas over a dozen times, it was time for me to try Rio Buffet, since a lot of people keep saying that this buffet is one of the largest in all of Vegas perhaps the world. 

All I have to say is that this indeed is one of the biggest buffets I have ever seen in my life. It was very hard for me to choose what to eat since there were so many to choose from. Even my mom said she got tired from walking and carrying the heavy plate at the end of the buffet station to the table. This goes to show how long the buffet station is.

We got in lines for the buffet at 3pm and ended up paying the lunch price instead of the dinner price. Dinner starts at 3:30. I think we got a great deal since we got to enjoy dinner food at 3:30 instead of paying at a dinner price.

The food here is so-so. Not that great, but great for your stomach.  Since there were a lot of food to choose from, the quality of the food is just okay, not the best.

The snow crab legs here are somewhat small and cold. I wish it can be steamed like some buffets on the Vegas Strip.

Now I can officially say I've dined at Rio Buffet. 

Will I come back? Probably not, unless I get the 24 hrs buffets pass.

So here's a full steady tour of the largest buffet in Vegas:

Having said that, this buffet is pretty damn good and has A LOT of selections. Crab Legs for days, surprisingly good Asian food (they even have Pho!), and all your other essential Vegas buffet selections (Italian, Mexican, American).

This place is also huge; that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how lazy you are. It stretches pretty far so you may have a long walk back to your table, but at least you're burning some calories at a buffet amirite? Hehe

Also I wish they had more fruit selection as they only had melons and pineapples when I went. Not a deal breaker, but it's always a good idea to fruit it up after all the meat and carbs you're going to be stuffing down.

Overall though this place is good for the price. Obviously if you want the full vegas buffet experience, you might want to check out the pricier places on the strip :)

5309689,2010-12-27,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"This place is GREAT; best thing to do is to get in for breakfast while eating as little as possible (they switch from breakfast foods to lunch foods at around 11, so enter at 10:30-10:45, and I believe the lunch and dinner foods are the exact same). Sometimes if you're lucky you can catch discounted specials instead of the usual prices, which can be as high as $24.99/person for dinner.

Items to try is anything from the Chinese selection (particularly the egg flower soup and any of their Chinese BBQ items), the prime rib drenched in au jus, the mashed potatoes, and the fried fish w/ onion rings. The king crab legs are forgettable. The dessert is a hit and miss; a 'safe' item on the dessert menu is definitely the gelato.

Service is usually somewhat attentive, in terms of drink refills, clearing plates, and bottles of ketchups. Be aware of little kids vomiting on the floor.",s7XUDb3zT-7u1_5lySqvKg,0,0,4,DMed6S2GQWTC08iB3_3V8w
5311158,2015-01-04,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"I've always wanna try this ""famous"" seafood buffet, and so we went there on Friday around 8:50 pm. There's no one waiting in line. I used to eat buffet at Caesars and there's always lines. Well, so we got seated and I was checking out the foods. There's great selections of seafoods, and foods are looking great.


So I got this mini lobster tail and the first bite, I have to spit out coz it has this stinky smell. I was thinking if it's the flavor or its just me, so I added some lemon, dip in the sauce, well, a little better but the smell is still there. I guess it's just not fresh.

Then I had the clam, first bite, lol, bunch of sands. Spit out the second time.

Hubby got the oysters, it was ok, but I lost confidence in how they handle their seafood on the back. So I only ate one piece.

Cajun shrimp, the shrimp is very soft just like biting on marshmallows. Meh... Can't find anything else to eat.

Prime ribs maybe? The rib itself is ok, but the Au jus was just way too salty.

Only thing I'm satisfied with was the salmon at the sushi bar and the Chinese sesame balls. Btw, their cakes are good though :)

This buffet is yet the worse vegas buffet I've ever been to, and it's $51 after tax per person.

I came here using my Buffet of Buffet pass, and if you don't have it, definitely check it out if you can plan it out.  You can easily fit in at least 3 buffets in a 24 hour period, maybe even 4 or 5 if you plan it well!  If this is the last stop for you, please make sure to factor in about a 20-30 minute wait, but even longer if you come on a weekend.  If you're not sure which of the 7 buffets you want to make sure to hit up, make sure the Rio is one of them.  

A few of the highlights: Mongolian BBQ (drop off your food and then come back for it, because if you wait, it'll take 10 minutes or so), Prime Rib, decent chinese food for a buffet (with dim sum type of dishes), and shrimp/crab legs.  I wish that the shrimp was pre-peeled, but it's not.  The crab legs could be better, but I'm not one to complain!  You know what's great to top off your meal?  GELATO!!!!!  Fantastic.

Unfortunately, the Mexican section does not offer anything salvageable. The corn tortillas always have too much moisture and they end up getting really hard and sticky, yuck!

the buffet is big...alot of selections....but then u get something else for alot of selections...alot of untasty foods.  there was alot of food to choose from but all i remember is the bread & pizzas being dried & cold, the skinny crab legs having a weird smell to them- like cleaning fluid & just a bunch of other foods that just weren't that good.  i think the only one thing i cared for were some hebachi/skewer/yakitori chicken which was just ok.  i do have to say the deserts were pretty nice....looked nice & tasted good too.  i've been to this buffet twice & the first time i went the server (a tall big african american guy) was very helpful....probably the best i've ever had....he got us extra plate for crab leg scraps, got us drinks/refills, utensils & napkins on time- very good server.  the second time i came here the server was ok- didn't really give us much attention, had to ask for drinks & more napkins.  

overall the buffet is ok, pricey probably cause of all the selection- but again i can't say all/most of the food was good.  and i only like one thing & desert.

       - Locals with Total Rewards card get 50% off. Up to 7 guests. I believe this is everyday except Saturday.
**Notes (Dinner Buffet Experience)**
       - 4 Stars - The only reason I give this place a 4 star is what you get for the price (if you're a local). It's a huge variety of food for a great price.
       - Not The ""Village Seafood Buffet"" - Don't get this buffet confused with the other Rio buffet on the other side of the casino (http://www.yelp.com/biz/village-seafood-buffet-las-vegas).
       - Crab Legs - Their crab legs are a little smaller than other places. With that said, they're still good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=Dujfh1Qhx3BzbEL9vEQM7g).
       - Asian Selection - They have duck, a couple popular dim sum items. Outside of an actual Chinese restaurant, it's really good.
       - Prime Rib - I've had varying experiences. On average, it's a bit overcooked (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw?select=OPiuOSP5l7l3x7k5SNqzrA).
       - Fried Goodness - They have fries, curly fries, hush puppies, clam strips, fried cod. My only complaint is the cod is usually a little dry.
       - Desserts - They have your standard pies/cakes you see at most local casinos.
       - Selection - This buffet has one of the largest selections to choose from. From one end to the other, of the non-repeating buffet aisle is quite a hike.
       - Quality - On almost everything on the menu, I'd say the taste and quality is just average.
       - Line - The dinner line starts piling up around 5:30 on the weekdays. The long can get pretty long so come early.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd only recommend this place to locals. $13.50 for a so-so dinner buffet isn't bad. However, I'd never pay $27 for this place.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,9,0,4,A9FoVxpI0ZQOoqkCoGVz7w

What I go there for is the crab and shrimp. People bring heaps of them to their table with abundant amounts of melted butter and cocktail sauce. The crab legs are semi-cracked so they're easy to eat.  Rio buffet is always in my Las Vegas itinerary because it satisfies all my cravings!!

I'm straight...next was the Southern foods, fried chicken, gumbo, collared greens, sweet potatoes, etc.. I dunno if it was me, but did anyone else notice the chefs were standing at their respective ethnicity/region? The black guy was in the Southern section, the Latino guy was in the Mexican food section, a Chinese guy at the Asian section? I guess it demonstrates their credibility? That, oh yeah, an Asian guy made this food, it must be good! However, it wasn't always so. I basically tried everything there, we stood around and walked in and out and had cigarettes for about 3-4 hours. There was a large variety, but the taste of everything didn't send me over the edge, that's why I docked em a couple stars.

The shrimp were decent, but the crab legs tasted a little old, dry, and had a consistency of rubber. After that was the Chinese station. The bbq pork was decent, the flavor was spot on, but a little fatty. The duck was delicious although lacked the crispy skin one would like with a roasted duck.

We got here around 6 PM on a Friday and the line was not too long. About a half hour or less wait. We were seated quickly and ordered drinks. The buffet is separated into different types of cuisines - salads, Asian, Mexican, carving station, American, Italian, etc. There was a lot of variety, but the food itself did not look too appetizing. About Home Town Buffet style. 

The best things here were the gelato and the prime rib. The prime rib was pretty succulent and juicy. It melted in my mouth - was super soft ... that made the whole meal. The mashed potatoes, salad, sushi (they had salmon rolls too!) were pretty good. The crab legs - people waited so long for them - were all right. Because they weren't cut, you have to ask the waitress/waiter for a prying device to pry out the meat. Not very convenient, but if you like to work for your food, this is definitely for you. I watched as a man pretty much fished for crab legs. He stood there taking out all the big ones and by the end had two whole plates of the legs ... The popcorn shrimp was tasty! I loaded up on some Asian veggies, too. After that, I hit the dessert station. Not too much that's absolutely 100% delicious ... I do recommend the gelato (especially the strawberry sorbet and the orange! The coffee tasted like alcohol, according to my friends). I wasn't able to try the banana cream pie, but I heard it was delicious. There are random cookies, cakes, pies, but I was so stuffed that I couldn't really work up an appetite to eat anything besides the gelato and a fruit tart. :) 

Overall, not bad. I have heard that this buffet is the top three out of the six Buffet of Buffet's. (And if this is just A-Ok, the others aren't that much greater, huh?)

The food and selection have been going downhill for the last year.  It seems they cater to an Asian market now, which is fine, and it has increased the Asian food variety.  The carving station is standard LV buffet fair, but the pre-prepared hot trays around it are on the low side of buffet standard.  The Mexican food is bland and never changes; same with the Italian (if you want to call it that).  The dessert area is still worth coming for with some great gelatos, fresh baked cookies, and a wide selection of tarts, cupcakes, and pies.

Was disappointed to see a lot of the staff standing around, from hostesses to the cooks to the wait staff.  But I guess that's what happens when the customers decline.  The place was mostly empty for lunch, maybe a quarter full when this time last year there would have been a line to get in.

I've been to a buffet before, but I was completely amazed to see how enormous this was!! It looked like about 100 feet long with various items to choose from. I was told this was an average medium size buffet, not a fancy huge one lol. 

The food selection was amazing with various offerings: Italian, Asian, American, and other culture foods. You can make your own soup with won tons, get seafood, prime rib, pork belly, and other food types. The desert selection was amazing too! They offered gelato, fruit cups, cakes, pies, and cookies.

The server was very nice, place was very spread out, didn't full busy, lots of room inside, and the staff members were friendly. The restaurant does offer a 25% discount for Las Vegas residents.  

My downfalls: Some food like the prime rib and pork belly was not the best I had. Some trays of food looked dried out like the teriyaki sticks. I wouldn't try them. It took a long time to get in the place for some reason. I watched the cashiers; they were moving so slow. Also, the seating took a long time. There were so many open tables in the place. I believe they were trying to find out who was available for the seats to serve them I guess.

Mediocre at best. 
To state the obvious it is a buffet.. not a 5 star restaurant. Either way, I was disappointed. 

Ive been to a whole ton of buffets in Vegas, we come at least once a year. The Rio is supposed to have one of the top buffets in vegas. Ask around. The Rio is the place to hit.. or the Bellagio. I digress. 

The food was okay. One star up from Hometown i suppose. I dont remember the last time i went to one, but... theres a reason for it. They suck. 

I suppose a buffet is a place to stuff your face with everything u can think of.. at once,get full and pass out. Definitely not a place for quality. Starch, meat, some more starch, and a salad bar. Goodie!

Ohh! and the vegeterian options? Minimal at best. Lettuce and macaroni and cheese? What a meal!

1 star for having bananas foster... and okay gelato.",O7VxQJUG8H7SglSoPwQU0Q,0,0,2,z9DhGlXtCo5BPW3t0VYGyQ

The line was over an hour long and the service was VERY mediocre.  They had machines there for people to check in and pay.  Not even a human being there to take our money.  

Our waiter was also indifferent too.  I asked him to give my 2 year old a small cup of milk and he came back with a huge 20 oz of it.  The only time he even gave us a smile was when we left tip.

There was a lot of variety of food here.  But none of the food stood out as something excellent.  I had to peel my own shrimp cocktail.  The crablegs were ok.  My husband spent half his time cracking it open.

My daughter only ate their ketchup at this buffet.  She wasn't even interested in their noodles or pizza.  

The Rio attracts some really interesting people.  The buffet was really close to the parking lot street entrance so anyone can just wonder on into this buffet and start asking people for money and other things.  It was all really creepy.  Where was security?  Security was near the freakin slot machines!  I took my daughter deeper into the casino just to be away from the main entrance and there was security, saying that my daughter is too close.  All my daughter wanted was a CHAIR to sit on so she can play her iPOD Touch games.  But they only offered chairs to slot machine players.  

I had to keep my daughter entertained for 60+ minutes while my husband waited in line so I got to encounter some of those ""interesting people"".  Let's just say I will NEVER be coming back to this casino again.  So a warning goes out to parents with small children, keep your kids in line with you or go deeper into the casino to avoid having to deal with the weirdos that wonder in.  But not too close to the slot machines or else security will jump on you!",7MYkD7RcQSLesGtDitEr9g,0,0,2,f1Am7HGIKnyx03mgzfMjfA

My friends and I came here on our last night in Vegas. We were so happy to find out that there was a free shuttle from Bally's to Rio. When we arrived, there was such a long line! As my friends Shar and Michelle waited in line, Jenn and I had to find the Total Rewards counter to get our Buy One Get One Free Coupons for the buffet. When we returned, they had barely moved in the line. It was getting late and we were all hungry. There was an extra $10 fee if we wanted to skip out on the line and get to the front. We decided to all just pay $10 so we could start our feast! 

We were seated within 10 minutes and practically ran to see what kind of food they had. Jenn, Shar, and I basically piled up our plates with crab legs. We weren't really dressed to get messy, but we did it anyways. As we finished our crab, we were starting to get full. We grabbed clean plates and ventured off into the many different sections of the buffet. Jenn and I saw the gelato and we immediately were surprised! I have never seen gelato at a buffet before. There were so many different flavors and we wanted all of them!  As we finished our second plates, we were getting full and had to take a break before getting dessert. When we were ready to get dessert, there was a line for gelato. Jenn and I decided to look at the other desserts that were offered and come back to see if the line had died down. It didn't. We saw a display of Red Velvet Cake, but they ran out. We were sad that they didn't have that but we were looking forward to our gelato. I chose the Mango and Strawberry flavors. The Strawberry was more of a sorbet and I decided to skip it. I thought the Mango gelato was good, but Michelle and Shar said it tasted like shampoo. We were devouring our desserts but some of them tasted horrible! The only thing that I can recall is the Flan! It was disgusting and really watered down! 

Other than that, everything else was great and the deal we received was well worth the price we paid to enjoy high quality food!",Ow1qZX39WQW4vjomLlHRZw,0,0,4,qqbCzhzzIcAdFZYCvEP08Q

They did have a wide selection of overall foods, but really think the quality sucked a$$ for the price they charge per head ($25pp for breakfast). Don't get me wrong, I still managed to eat a lot & left really full, but was very disappointed :-b.

I got a plate from each section, & the only 2 things I thought tasted really good were the mini-cakes: red velvet w/cream cheese frosting, carrot cake w/cream cheese frosting. (I know what you're thinking: Cake for breakfast? What is you crazy? But hey, in my world, it's never too early for cake!!)

The eggs were ""mehhh"", bacon was WAY undercooked & gross, they had random onion rings (or calamari? I couldn't tell because they were so dry & chewy) next to the eggs & bacon section. A lot of the food looked like they had been sitting there awhile because they were all dry & sometimes bland.

Service was good, though, I had a very nice waiter who was very attentive. Appropriately, I left him a nice tip as a thank you.

I'm assuming their lunch & dinner buffets are better because every time I walked past it to go to the Strip shuttle, the lines were insane! Of course, there was no line for breakfast & the place was very empty then, haha.",VoO-eDoNC87qolK8Fz9yPA,1,0,2,vyr5Ye-e7Tk67GGCTtoTew

The quality of the food is not worth the wait (lines are loooong) and the money. They have a lot of variety but the food didn't look tasty at all, not even the desserts. I would rather go to a buffet that offers better quality than a huge variety of food.

Crab legs..peel n eat shrimp...gelato and the pick your own stuff Asian food. 

I can eat crab legs like a pro, and five or six plates in a sitting. No thats not a typo. I do NOT mess around when it comes to crab. I am pretty sure I have taken out a few generations of the delicious beasts at this buffet. I can sit all day and just peel and munch.  My sister loves to take me because she says it is like a magic show. :D 

Peel and eat shrimp, ditto.

Now, this is a casino buffet that runs 25 bucks for two locals on special. I am totally not expecting legs nor shrimp like at the delicious Kings Fish House. (If they had all you can eat, me and them would be bankrupt.) I dont care if the legs are ginormous, or the shrimp are ginormous. Who cares? I can have as much as I want and I gots the time!! They are definitely comparable in size to Red Lobster at a fraction of the cost. 

I digress. 

I LOVE STIR FRY. It is one of the few things I have not perfected in my own kitchen, and so drool and salivate over it when I am at a buffet they have the make your own. All I want is a giant plate of baby corn, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and broccoli.( Avoid the sushi next door. Trust me. It is so americanized it might as well have a Mcdonalds sign. However the Udon station is pretty awesome. )

So when I go, I get a plateful of each of these things and get comfortable. Then I go for another round. Nom!  Gelato or two on the way out the door and I am ready to nap the day away.

After the slow lines, the buffet was pretty good. They never ran out of the key crab legs, shrimp and prime rib cuts. 

They sat us wayyy by the waiting line so it was a trek to walk to every food station.

5583212,2012-04-22,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"I used to think this was the best buffet in Vegas.  I have since amended that judgment and prefer Planet Hollywood.  However, this buffet is still near and dear to my heart.  Carnival World Buffet set a model that many other casino's have copied with the international station.  First some background for this review.  I don't love buffets, just good ones so very few buffets will get 4 or 5 stars.  Why am I a buffet snob? Well, I like well prepared food and no matter how good the food at a buffet is, sloppy eaters and heat lamps inevitably detract from the taste of the food.  Further, unlike some who take piles of snow crab legs, I prefer food I don't have to fight with for a sliver of minor pleasure.  I also dislike the price-value.  The cheap buffets are usually poor quality and the good ones overpriced.  Not to mention that I have never spent less than 30 minutes in line for this buffet and that is on a good day.

That said, why do I like this one?  First, if you are local, the price for dinner is 1/2 price, only $13.50 or so.  And you can bring in at least a party of 4 for that price.  Next, From the Sushi to the Sandwiches, this buffet matches quality and quantity with any buffet.  Plenty of chef stations keep the fresh food coming.  Even kids will load up their plates here.  The roast beef and Turkey were properly cooked with both med rare and medium pieces available.  The sushi was firm and tasty, not lukewarm or slightly fishy tasting like some lesser buffets.   

There were some cleanliness issues the last time we were there but it seemed an abberation.

Overall one of the best buffets in Vegas.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,1,4,eJewlHjp4aWIup4bR9lU8Q

We were squished into tables super close to each other, while there were many, many vacant tables close by. The guy who sat across from us (it was like we were eating together!) was the noisiest, ill-mannered eater I have ever seen-- slurping his soup, chomping on food with his mouth wide open, all while listening to his iPod that was so loud I could hear it. It was nauseating, and the waiters HAD to have noticed it. Never once did a waiter come by and acknowledge us, or we would have asked to be moved--it was that obnoxious. I wrote two letters to the Rio complaining about their seating policy (seating everyone in one area, I assume for the convenience of the waiters) but received no response. They don't care, apparently. Now, as far as the food: pretty mediocre. What was once a wonderful adventure in dining is now pretty generic. The quality of the food was so-so-- nothing to brag about, and really nothing to go for. The food was generally cold and dried out. We last went at the start of dinner time (so there was no excuse for that). It's not a cheap buffet-- I would expect a great deal more for this price. Average food, servers and management who don't seem to care, sitting crammed next to other diners: why bother when there are so many other buffets that rise above this one?

The local discount is no longer 50% off. It's now 25%, and that includes your Total Rewards Card. Not only is it pricier for locals, but their food is a bit of a disappointment. They still have delicious crab legs that you can get warm or cold (I prefer cold if you ask me), and the delicious cocktail shrimp which they now have in Cajun. The cajun shrimp honestly tastes like they just sprinkled it the powder it on it and served it as is. When it came to dessert time, they didn't even have much of a selection compared to the last other times we were here. HUGE disappointment if you ask me :(

Their service is the only reason why I gave them two stars. There were ten people in our table, yet our server was on top of his game! He took away our food and refilled our drinks, and the best part was that we didn't even have to ask him twice or we didn't even have to flag him down to ask for refills.

For locals, the prices can't be beat - half off of the regular price (unless it's a holiday, then you're stuck paying the regular price.) It's basically the same price as eating say, Palace Station, but with substantally more food choices.

The food isn't bad, but it's not great. The sushi is pretty fishy tasting. The shrimp and crab salad was really good, and I went back for a second helping of that - and I hate seafood! Nothing was phenomenal, and the chicken parmesan was not good at all. The desserts were decent and I liked the calamari. It's good for a buffet but if you ordered any of the food as an entree at a restaurant, you wouldn't be happy.

I particularly like the asian soup options - they have 5 or 6 preset options (egg noodle, rice noodle tom yum, won ton, etc) but they are willing to build whatever you ask for.  Also in the dessert section they have a warmer plate for warm chco chip cookies (they are the best).

Judge me if you must, but the last time I went to Vegas, I purchased the 24-hour buffet pass (which is really only $39.99 when you sign up for the total rewards program).  It's just a good deal.  Do you remember how much food costs in Vegas? I certainly didn't.  And I was shocked, nay, appalled by the fact that a $6 hot dog was my cheapest meal rescue. 

Anyway, back to the story, erm, review... I rationalized with my partner in crime that Vegas buffets costs from $20 to $40 each anyway, so if we went to just two, we would come out on top.  And, well, if we managed to wake up early, dine late, and pretty much just jog from one buffet to the other, we would actually be making money. You see?  Food can be an addiction too... Ahem.

After a seemingly endless, nauseating, and threat-to-never-eat-again-pledge-ridden buffet marathon, my associate and I decided to go out with a bang: the Rio buffet.  After a long walk, a shuttle ride, and a pretty beefy-looking line later, we entered pure heaven.  Wow, just the thought of if makes my stomach growl.  Following such severe disappointments as the much-lauded Paris champagne brunch, this place was just an overeater's (me) storybook fairytale.  So here's a list of the menu, off the top of my head. 

- American diner style section: tater tots, onion rings and fries, well fried to perfection, you get my drift...
- Mexican food bar: pretty good guacamole, steaming hot tortillas, freshly-made churros (even some with strawberry jam inside), red rice, flavorful refried beans, shredded chicken, and slightly-watery salsa
- Made-to-Order Noodles/Soup section: pick from bars full of fresh veggies, meats, and sauces, choose an overall flavor from the menu, and voila: your fresh-made meal in less than a minute- like having a supercool, futuristic microwave (fifth element shoutout!)
- Comfort Foods: mashed potatoes, yams, endless varieties of rolls, green beans, fried chicken, and mac 'n cheese
- Asian Fare: orange chicken, spicy beef and broccoli, chow mein, fried rice, and so on.
- Desserts: Where do I start?  The sugar-free section is ridiculous! And by ridiculous, you know I mean awesome.  Loads of apple, berry, and cream pies, chocolate and sugar cookies, blueberry bread, etc.  Non-sugar free offered the same items as SF and more: chocolate cake, tiramisu, carrot cake, and an entire gelato bar, etc. It was all very delightful. 

Of all of the buffets I magically managed to cram into the 24-hour marathon, I would say that Rio's is the best.  The buffet offered an amazing and fresh variety, the service was friendly, efficient, and non-judgmental (I, myself, would have offered a bib), and the overall decor was clean and soothing (think warm lighting to hide the grease-and-sauce-strewn faces).

I've heard so much about how great this buffet is, but was a little disappointed. My tummy was craving some prime rib and crab legs. There was no prime rib (they only had dry roast beef) and the crab legs were kind of difficult to eat due to the lack of meat in them. 

The selection is pretty big, more than your typical Vegas buffet, but the taste was pretty mediocre. I'd much rather have a smaller selection with high quality food. 

Quick tips: 

1. Come right before the brunch rush (around 11ish on a Sunday). There wasn't a long wait. As we left, however, the line was out the door. 

2. The price is good. I think we paid $17.99 for Sunday brunch. Champagne included. Not bad at all for what you get. 

3. If you want high quality food and a nice venue, go to the Wynn. You'll definitely be ""Wynning"" there. LOL

Sal had a line out the door but he still took the time to answer our questions about the buffet and even got us a private room that opened up!

5755875,2013-02-16,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"This is just your standard, run of the mill buffet. My friends and I got a discount from the Tix4Tonight booth, so we got to go at around $22 on 2/10/13. There are plenty of options for food, however, food options do not equal food quality. The atmosphere is pretty drab, and nothing too big stands out in a positive way other than a cool fire place over the carving station area. I will say the dessert area is pretty good, but almost all the other food is just dry or flavorless. This was the first and only buffet me and my friends went to on our Vegas trip. I would say here, you get what you pay for, so it might have been worth it to pay a little more for a nicer buffet somewhere on the strip at a nicer hotel. Overall, I was not impressed at all by anything at the Carnival World Buffet, but rather disappointed.

PROS
*Food Options - They pretty much have every type of cuisine here, from carving stations, to Seafood, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Salads, Desserts, etc. Now the quality of the food is a whole different story.

*Price - If you get your meal through the Tix4Tonight booth, you can get the buffet for dinner down to $22, which for Las Vegas or anywhere in general is not a bad price for dinner.

CONS
*Food Quality - While I've certainly had worse food at a buffet, I've had much better too. The food here

*Location - The only reason we went here is because we were going to see Penn & Teller that night at the Rio, so we said, why not eat here. So if you have to go to the Rio and eat there, I'd try another place seeing it is off the strip in the isolated Rio. 

*Atmosphere - It seems to be a pretty dated and worn out place for me. The drop down ceilings make the place look cheap and drab, and the lighting doesn't look romantic or intimate, but makes me feel like they just can't afford good lights.",Xstf9n7v8rSOryJAuY2S7Q,2,0,2,BQkS9wnIGNmGbQqhcfV39A

Oh, who cares. I get to skip the lines anyway.

Waltzing past all those poor unfortunate souls who have to wait in that abominable line during peak lunch hours, I head straight for the Diamond line with my friends and am promptly seated. No, I did not pay.  But that's because I take care of the payments directly with the casino, you know, at those automatic money deposit centers lined in soft felt? Yeah, the card tables. They take all my money and give me food as a consolation prize. Yeap.

To be honest, I wouldn't eat here unless it was for free.  I'm not really sure how much it costs, but I'm pretty sure it isn't cheap.  Judging by the consistent lines, I'm pretty sure that it's pretty popular, too.

I just don't know why.  It's a glorified Hometown Buffet.  Granted, there is a greater selection and there are cool food stations, but for the most part, the food isn't all that special.

Since birth, I've been afflicted by a crippling condition called Food Envy.  Yeah, I'm one of those, the ones who painstakingly chooses the best thing on the menu only to promptly regret it after seeing everyone's else's dish. There is no cure, but the most effective treatment that I've found for this condition is to order several things off the menu and give myself a variety.

So a buffet is the perfect playground, wouldn't you say?

Unfortunately, I've never had anything at the buffet and said WOW.  It was always just MEHHHHHHHHHHH for me.  The decor boasts nothing special (I swear, it's just a bigger Hometown Buffet!), the service is so-so (then again, the wait staff don't have to do much besides refill my drinks and clear the tables), and the food is just normal buffet food.

So I was going to give it two stars.  BUT, I realized that perhaps I'm just picky.  My friends all love going to the Carnival World Buffet.  They grub and grub and leave entirely satisfied. So maybe the problem lies within me and only me.  =)

Usually, I'll stick to the tried and true carving stations, avoiding the noodle bar altogether.  I don't know.  I've probably dined here at least 50 times, and I can't think of even ONE particular dish that I can write about. It's just not that memorable!

Since it's free, I won't complain.

The selection of desserts has also been reduced. 

Our service was barely satisfactory. Had to call the waiter for a drink refill. Do not remember having to aggressively ask for refills in the past.

i paid about 26ish bucks for dinner and i felt like it was reasonable for vegas buffets...

they have everything covering from italian food to chinese dishes to mexican to seafood and everything else in between. 

the quality of the food is mostly a hit, but sometimes you get something that isn't cooked well or just doesn't taste right...

i believe the crab legs only show up during dinner time so definitely go during dinner. (you still have to crack open the legs, Rio isn't as nice as wynn where they open the crab for you....)

the station underneath the fire in the center of the buffet usually has the best food: ham, prime rib, sirloin, and german sausage.  

the staff is usually attentive and will be there to clean up your dishes and give you drinks. 

the line to get in is ridiculous.  it took us almost 1 hour at 3:00pm on a monday.

the dessert island is pretty simple.  cakes, pastries, cookies.  Their strawberry sorbet is super bomb!!!

I give it three stars because of the outstanding variety of food that's here (American, Mexican, Asian, seafood, desserts galore, you name it!) Otherwise, the food is two stars at best. 

Going on a very slow afternoon for a Tuesday, we instantly were sat with a party of six no problem. Our servers were quick with our drinks, and speaking of drinks... $3 special on long islands and margaritas? This special only went on until 3PM, and either they made my long island too sugary or judging by the crowd that comes in there (usually elderly people and middle aged people, no offense!), I personally don't think there was enough alcohol to even it out (and no I'm not an alcoholic, LOL). 

The shrimp and the seafood is fresh and plentiful, as well as the fruit stocked by the salad bar. While I try to stick with light vegetarian things, some of my friends noted the hamburgers were dry, as well as the chicken. The tofu was pretty good sans the tofu salad mixed in with cucumbers (they used too much vinegar or something in it, I couldn't exactly tell what the marinade was). The gelato is obviously the happy ending of it all, but I wish Carnival was as good with quality as it is great with the quantity.

This place literally had EVERYTHING. Mexican, Chinese, Vietnamese, Italian, Soul Food, American, Mongolian...they even had DIM SUM! OMG the selections were almost endless.
I tried so much but here are some of the things that stood out
Chicken: BLEH a little dry, but it had a some flavor.
Mashed Potatoes: I have no idea how you made it but it was so good I didn't even need gravy with it.
Pho: mediocre, the meatballs were kinda funny tasting..
Egg Noodle: The broth was good, I just had some of the broth to help everything else down.
Fettucine: I have no idea what is in your Alfredo sauce, but I'd love to figure out the recipe because it was soo good, and we added a bit of butter sauce and it was DELISH!
Crab Legs: DUDE they were packed to the top and I'm pretty sure this line was by far the longest one I had to wait in. They were pretty good and didn't even need to be dipped with anything for taste
Tamale: The shredded beef was so flavorful and had a hint of spice to it, yummm
Gelato: it's the best. I'm pretty sure I had 3 ice cream runs in between meals LOL. Strawberry and Mango sorbet were my fave, although the Tiramisu and Cookies n' Cream seemed to by the most popular.

Service: AMAZING, I think we may have gotten lucky with our server but he was sooooo NICE and was on top of his game. We tipped him well, he even refused to take the tip because it was so much even though we swore it was the minimum he should be tipped. He gave us a free gigantic Rio margarita cup and kept thanking us. He was a sweetheart.",-ZEKvTTWmSCdRJam9YfB1Q,2,0,3,gEcBlTRRtj43KIETCnAO-w

I'm a little late on writing this review, seeing as how I was in LV on vacation with my parents towards the end of December.  But I still remember that it was a HUGE buffet.  The price is relatively reasonable for all the buffets in LV (probably because it is so far off the strip).  We usually go for lunch, and the lines aren't ridiculous like some places.  They have a row of kiosks for self-service.  I sort of like that idea because there's 5 kiosks as opposed to two cashiers.  It makes the lines go way faster. 

Once you go in, the decor is pleasant and cheery.  And they are not kidding when they say ""World Buffet"" because there are foods from all over the world, with large signs on top of the sections that correspond to the food that is being served.  They have the usual, Italian, Chinese, American, Japanese, etc., but the reason why I like the food here is because it is so fresh.  And the place is so clean.  And the waitstaff are very friendly and always keeps our drinks filled.

On Christmas' Eve, they had a champagne brunch.  And it was unlimited refills.  Cheap champagne + good food = fun, even if I was only with my parents.",wMk62l3ILf7TKenpbw9PeQ,1,0,5,63ugcKMheaRy9CRk7lhOGA

Gelato sold individually is already expensive, so I think you get your money's worth. Also, the buffet palete seems to veer towards the Asian tastes. 

They have a noodle bar where you can make pho, udon, etc. It is pretty neat. Also, there's a pseudo mongolian style area where you pick your veggies and they give you a choice of beef, chicken, or shrimp. Just remind the chef when he mixes it together not to put too much soy sauce. (Too much soy sauce is actually really bad for you)

There was some sushi on display. I don't like it when the buffets don't peel the cocktail shrimp. This was one of those. There's also the typical American fare that was also pretty good.

I mostly ate warm delicious crab legs. Not just ate I PIGGED OUT!!!!! 
The prime rib and roast beef were really juicy and that guy serving it was the most friendly employee there. The description said they had sushi, the DIDN'T!!!

I payed online before hand but when i arrived I ended up having to pay some other fees and taxes which i thought was bullshit.But since I already payed for two people online and It was my last day in Vegas I just payed it.

It was also supposed to come with unlimited drinks.  NOPE just soft drinks and beer. and the bartender was never at the counter it was so annoying.

the waiters were hovering our table like rushing us the whole time which was just so annoying and I hate people watching me eat like literally just staring for minutes on end.

The cookies and cream gelato was the best dessert over there!!! the coconut was disgusting tasted like parfume.

Basically it was okay because of the meat and crab legs. but for two people at about $100 total you could just buy some and make it a home?",pn3Gf1yva_dgWq5xrMol6g,1,0,2,QnKpbBuz3_hIKjAgcEdnkA

Bacchanal (Caesars) and the Cravings Buffet (Mirage) have it beat, but Carnival defeats Paradise at the Flamingo and anything on Fremont Street without much effort. Lunch buffet ran about $25 per person. After using Total Rewards points towards our bill, we ended up shaving it down to $19 total for two people (NICE!).  Seated pretty smoothly, and waited on quick, but the waitress seemed to disappear thereafter. Carnival had a wide variety of styles (BBQ, Mexican, Asian, Italian, American) but in Las Vegas buffet terms, it was hardly spectacular. Most of the choices seemed a bit aged, and the lack of a crowd didn't necessitate constant attention to the buffet line. Didn't really try anything noteworthy...just your run-of-the-mill buffet. Staying at the Rio and a bit off of the strip may prompt hotel guests to stay close and stop in for a bite, but I'd hardly be catching a cab from Caesar's to eat at the Carnival.

I really enjoyed the Asian noodle soup station. You get your choice of noodle and soup base. Then top it off with beef, brisket, fish balls, onions, peppers etc.  They offered  pho, udon, wonton soup, egg noodle etc. I had the pho. To my surprise it tasted really good granted it was a buffet.
Good selection of desserts as well. For under $30 bucks w/bottomless mimosas I'd say this is a pretty sweet deal!",Qv_sHg9kBNE3PB-HFBrgTw,1,0,4,BWVwQlg-CglEWwzWoYRIgQ
5916585,2011-06-23,5,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"The Carnival World Buffet @ Rio has always been a favorite. When they first opened up, it was the best of the best. No other buffet could compete. But over the last few years, their quality has dwindled as up and coming buffets opened up nearby. They have picked up their game recently to compete with the big boys. Selection was never an issue with them as it's one of the best.

This will be a picture review of my plates:

Imitation crab salad was good, cucumber salad was average, bacon was salty, sausage patty was salty, cream cheese blintz was excellent!

They had a noodle station with various noodles and broths. I opted for a bowl of pho. The pho was pretty good for buffet style. Broth lacked, but beef choices were good.

The Mongolian BBQ station. I choose shrimp as my protein. Typical fare here, I've never had Mongolian BBQ that wowed me. Not too shabby.

I was full after that and got gelato and flan for dessert. Nothing to complain about there.

I was stuffed and happy, that's all there is to it.",tPJ1g7cErzV4Rlfpaef4Zw,5,5,4,cbmkliEAvdfA1FcVP6tALw
5919182,2014-01-11,8,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"While $29.99, $32.42 with tax, proved to be too much for this feast.  While there was a lot offered at good quality, it wasn't worth the price as compared to some of the finer hotels.

I was there at 10:15am on a Saturday.  Mimosas are served, and I had two (delicious).  They had a good amount of breakfast and lunch items,  and I had a little of each.  Yes, lunch is already served.  Brunch.

Nothing was outstanding, but all was good.  It isn't an enormously large buffet, but ample nonetheless.

I think I would go back if 1) I was drunk, 2) I had a hankering for AYCE, 3) I was stuck without my car, 4) held hostage, 5) I was drunk.  Oh I said that.  Well, if the price was less...I would go.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,5,9,3,zcvolDrV0GmTzS_q-V29Dg

Lions, and Tigers, and Bears...Oh, MY!
Italian, and Chinese, and American Cuisine (and more)...Oh, My!  :)

They have so much food and you will TRY to eat all but never get to it all so browse everything before making a commitment.  LOL  Even the dessert area will make you feel like this too.

Food: Definitely lots of seafood, but I got sick of seafood after like 2 plates.
 I liked the small cooked lobsters, sashimi, clams, mussels, lobster bisque soup, new england clam chowder, Manhattan clam chowder, crabs. 
There were some fish dishes, Chinese, fried seafood like clams/shrimps, french fries, chicken, octopus, macaroni, and many more. There was some fruits like melons, honeydew, and watermelon, but none were sweet. There was a dessert section, but I only like the gelato section.

I would come back here. I wished i would eat more seafood, but i just couldn't stomach more since I had pool parties to go to.",Kx4RtLVvwFuH2F4hWKB0ig,1,1,4,bU2cTZV2YIVl3TDrrpvW_Q

They truly have something for everyone! There is also now a 24 hr pass though anytime I went here I only ate once.

They have so many different food stations which each represent a different ethnic dishes.  All the food for these stations are above average.  My favorite part of the Carnival World buffet is their dessert area.  Wow, it is sweet tooth heaven!  One time we sat at a table right beside the desserts, and I must have tried over a dozen delicacies!  They were all delicious too.

Definitely, give this buffet a chance.  It is pricey, but not as expensive as other places like Bellagio or Wynn which do not taste as good as here.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,0,0,4,o-dIhBSzJz-3wJIERWVu7g

We actually went for the Champagne Brunch and let's just say, we loved everything that we tried.  With exception of some chewy mongolian beef, everything else was to die for.  The Crab legs were wonderful, the oriental pairing were great and even the salads were great.  My husband fell in love with the Pizza, but also enjoyed all of the seafood selections and of course the Mimosa's, which our waitress was so wonderful at keeping our glasses full.  Our second time around to the Carnival World was for dinner and again, no complaints, and this time we did try the desserts.  Absolutely adorable and the little cheesecakes were to die for, we had actually considered taking a couple back to the hotel.  Yummy and very worth the cost.  Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to try out the Seafood Buffet at the Rio, but Carnival World did not dissapoint.",2mQ8pdbb_1Eh6LR1dAmkyg,0,0,4,JPEECnnW-TA0u3HIf0ug3g

As I have become a vegetarian there is a great deal of food to pick from. If your a meat or fish eater they had shrimp, crab legs, prime rib, etc...

5974823,2009-11-17,0,FLMxWQO-ckCQmGZhU9OQgw,"This is probably one of my favorite buffets here in Las Vegas. Well worth the normal hour long wait and a steal for $25 with all you're getting. We came for the champagne brunch and everything is superb minus the prime rib. That I was a little disappointed at because I look forward to eating it at buffets and theirs was too tough to eat. I like mine juicy and tender with a little bit of fat at the edge. They have a huge variety of food and many different stations. Lots of fresh seafood too, the snow crab was a bit salty, but I think they always are anyways. The dessert bar is my favorite and they have Gelato! The Hawaiian Coconut is yum-o! I think the reason why the line is so long is because they use automated machines for you to pay instead of a real cashier. A real cashier can really speed things up compared to every individual having to process their own transaction. A lot of the times people get up there and have no clue what they're doing so it really slows down the line. And there's only two of these machines. But other then that, well worth the trip off the strip for some good eat!",-bj4evSejxRDuvYnmcGNrg,0,0,4,5PqnH2d-Smzn0m4_dulMdg

First of all it's huge, and that's not a good thing, you have to walk sooooo far to get your food, and by the time you get back to your table the food is cold. 

Secondly it was like 40 bucks a person, way over priced. There's no way you could possibly eat even half the value of that here. No seafood, no prime rib or fancy carving station. It was all fillers, potatoes, rice, eggs, yuck. 

I'll save you the trouble of wandering around this ginormous buffet and tell you that Chinese was the best cuisine they had, and that's not saying much. Fried rice and won-ton soup. Probably could have ate at Panda Express for less than 10 bucks.

A champagne brunch will cost you $25 dollars a person, but our hungry, hungover group of 6 packed away WAY more than that per person. I'm amazed at the amount of food that they had, and even more surprised that it tasted pretty good.  I think the problem with buffets is that they often use poor quality ingredients to make food en mass, but this stuff was quite decent.  They had all sorts of food, dim sum, Mexican, a carving station, breakfast station, salad station, dessert station, sushi and more!  I didn't have any, but I heard the crab legs and smoked salmon were delectable.  The highlight for me was the dim sum, great shrimp dumplings and egg rolls. We all had mimosas, but they're made with cheap champagne.  The service was also kind of slow.  We got there around 12:30 and didn't have to wait long to be seated, but as we were leaving the lines had grown VERY long.  Bring your appetite and you won't be disappointed.

Was not happy with the service from the host. She was very rude and would not sit a party of 15 down together. We had all payed for our dinners in families already and when the  host asked us our party number she said that we had to pay extra gratuity. That would of been completely ok but the part that irritated all of us was that they still would not sit us all together. Oh and by the way it was dinner for my best friends 21st birthday and that big group of 15 people that wanted to sit with her to celebrate her birthday was her family. On top of that there was a whole area that was not being used with a huge table that would fit us all.

It was not until we got settled down that Fransisco came to the recuse and brought us all together to enjoy our meal together.
