Pizza is so thin, barely any cheese. 3 dollar del charge plus charge for card. Only 1 dressing for an 8 dollar salad! The sweaty angry old owner behind the phone hangs up on his customers! Beware!",YPD4JbuvOy3uvr3GuzZT4g,0,0,1,80Lj7brxv_o3ip8KQQ1eCg

The prices here are better than the foodtrucks at the event, and they accommodate vegans.",kKRbHSkT2dlGEWQFioXfjw,0,0,5,FgENveMvNxuGoGEGBvSbJw

Almost two hours later, after a couple of calls to check about when we could expect it, they finally show up.  It was delivered at 1:45 am.  By this time, we had fallen asleep and the pizza was cold as heck.  And, for the icing on the cake, they had forgotten our 2-liter drink and had to go all the way back to get it and bring it back.  Well, of course you don't want to eat your pizza without the drink.  We were staying at a hotel on the 6th floor and had to leave our room, not once but twice, to meet the delivery person because of their failure to make sure that they had everything that we ordered with them the first time!  What horrible service!  Not one time did they offer to refund our money or even apologize for the late delivery and mistake.  I strongly recommend that you DO NOT ORDER FROM MILANO'S.  On a side note:  if the pizza had been delivered on time while it was still hot, it might have been quite tasty.",dS4Zs5WSlK0awq8VMs4qzw,0,0,1,rhm39iDSu4stfSqQY0Qlyw
