971551,2017-05-12,0,1g47zyA_utx8mpgmtLc6tg,The food here is good but my order was messed up. I got home and called to let you know one of our bowls was messed up. It was supposed to be the white chicken breast but we got the normal chicken. I don't live close enough to come back immediately to get a replacement so they said I could get 20% off on a different day. What the hell is that?? I should get it free because our food was messed up. If that's your policy I wouldn't come here again. That's really messed up. Really crappy customer service and definitely not a way to build a reputation and clientele. Manager or owner should get it together,VIpikict51DzPMGt0VDwTA,1,0,3,u26na0LZwA6VRImTBkym1w
1118496,2017-06-06,0,1g47zyA_utx8mpgmtLc6tg,"I tried this place out after hearing about it from the tip jar stories. It ordered egg roll, shrimp tempura and tofu with brown rice and veggies. The apps were OK but nothing great. The tofu was acceptable. The rice was a little dry. The veggies were almost entirely cabbage. The pictures show large pieces of broccoli and other items. What I got was just soggy cabbage with some carrot shavings in it so I had tofu with dry rice and it wasn't very good. It probably would have been good if there was a decent variety of veggies in it.",kFuqgoQCKs19a8-o2JvbYg,0,0,3,DIYfCDoDxv_WGa13HvK90Q

The actual restaurant area was new and clean. Lighting is oddly bright like a spotlight over your head. Probably won't eat here again. Plus it was very expensive.

My boyfriend gets the regular chicken teriyaki plate and I get the breast plate for about almost $10 each. The chicken is nice and tender normally I am picky about it but at this place it's just right and not too rubbery. You get to choose between what kind of rice or if you want the veggies/mac salad with your plate, if you want the veggies but no cabbage then just ask for zucchini an broccoli. The employees help out because they make you feel welcomed and they always surprise me because a few actually remember my order. Overall I love everything about this place and will continue coming back.",UAVb6aDhLvu0PRN18k4TpQ,0,0,5,xbSooyeylpT-9uwqHb_-dQ

2179091,2017-07-19,0,1g47zyA_utx8mpgmtLc6tg,"I read other reviews and not sure what they're complaining about.  If you want gourmet Asian food go to an actual Asian restaurant.  Very few legit Japanese Teriyaki places in Vegas so either change your expectation or go elsewhere.  If you're looking to spend around $10 on a meal including drink this will satiate. I rate businesses on a reasonable expectation of value, cleanliness and friendliness of staff.  First off, compare TM with $10 meal joints serving relatively fast food and don't judge it as Japanese.  It's a quick lunch/dinner joint with middle ground ethnic food like Chipotle and the convenience of subway.  That said, the facility is kept very clean with condiments and soda fountain kept very orderly.  An employee makes rounds to wipe down tables and put things away every so often.  I didn't wait in line long and was greeted warmly and was taken care of proficiently.  I come here frequently when I'm indecisive and always get a no-sauce chicken bowl with white rice and veggies.  Veggies and rice are consistently well cooked and fresh and not greasy.  The amount of chicken can vary slightly but overall has been consistently moderately to very moist.  I have never had dry chicken with TM.  I will post a picture of my meal today and it's pretty representative of what I usually receive.  This is one of those joints you crave or go to if you need a relatively healthy reasonably priced meal.  I gave them five stars because I couldn't think of anything to nit pick over during my visit.",hoa6TOMC7ibseJWkNLGMZg,1,0,5,5-sQrM2BTmYuqlHpE5Np9w

2457081,2017-01-09,0,1g47zyA_utx8mpgmtLc6tg,I was excited to try this place but instantly disappointed. First of all customer service needs a big improvement. We had the beef and chicken plate. The beef was good but the chicken seemed rubbery. It wasn't until my boyfriend found hair buried in his rice. We bought this to the attention of the cashier who didn't seem to concerned about it. Instead she just scooped his meat into another plate and gave it back to him. An apology would have been sufficient or perhaps fresh rice. Didn't even get that. All in all we will not be back here. The one star is for the edamame we had as an appetizer.,F6oqsitMDpPWVzCV_iKpsA,4,1,1,kSAdpPFEUizrzaQfZ9jj2A

The noodles texture looked and tasted microwaved. A side of chicken cost $7.99. Like what and how ? This location needs work on the service too. The other location greeted me and had a friendly conversation with us since I walked in. The cashier was super friendly and described the dishes and what they came with well. This cashier looked more confused than me. Won't be returning to this specific location but the location on Blue Diamond and Decatur is where I recommend you guys take your service too.

Umm Excuse me I had to choke on their DRY CHICKEN real quick.  I ordered the Chicken Breast and Even if it has zero sauce on it  I should not have to rethink if I am eating chicken or Jerky. 

Tough, Dry , Rubbery and disgusting.  Their food is horrid, the noodles.. I mean I honestly do not understand the hype at all. 

The first thing my kid said when she took a bite, omg isn't this that place mom? I said Samurai Sam's ... No honey this is different.  And she replies and disgusting.

5824574,2017-10-18,0,1g47zyA_utx8mpgmtLc6tg,"welp, here's my Yelp, first off I wouldn't have even bothered cept when I asked for 1/2 white and 1/2 brown with my combo protein to go order the woman said I couldn't have that? and couldn't or wouldn't explain..

maybe 8 patrons inside about a 6 minute wait time if that?

and honestly I can let that go but when she said she didn't know why the alarm went off, I let it go in the store but that's why we have yelp right? I felt that it was cuz I'm white? dunno really she wouldn't tell me?

anyways now that I am here and I got that off my chest my review is its expensive for teri, $12 for a combo.. a small shot of limp beef and a small shot of chicken, if you are thinking you will get a big meal for the extra charge not so, welp, maybe if you're not white?  dunno don't care won't be back..

not the type to just take my blanket and leave crying over the spilt milk, so here goes..

the chicken is good and tender, cooked how teri chick should be cooked, slightly burnt on 2 sides then slivered up, small portion, the beef appears to be boiled? it is tender and palatable even so.. no crispness or flame at all? small portion..

brown rice is soft and fluffy, large portion..

the best part of the meal IMHO is the so called salad, its more like a garnish, lol.. again tiny portion.. I got like 3 bites in a separate to go container, however it is cold crispy and fresh, perfect really..  

the salad dressing, its the real deal, the kind that makes you go for teriyaki in the first place, you know the kind if you are a teriyaki connoisseur like myself.. its that creamy sweet sour style that you can eat a huge bowl of salad with, they gave me about 3/4 of an ounce in a separate to go container in the salad box which was plenty for the amount of salad... I like to put a little on my meat too its that good..

I gave it a 3 cuz they don't allow us to rate certain facets separately, so for the cost and not having pork and not allowing me to have half n half rice with ZERO explanation as to why, don't get me wrong I can handle a good dose of racism, your right, hate away, however you're going to have to have it all 100% if yer gonna to hate on me while charging me double...  :-)",d3JdB3vtZ_rssge5c9XoPA,0,0,3,eMVWrDIP8pOrIHLsZTG_Lg

If you sign up for the Madness club you will get a FREE bowl voucher emailed to you for your Birthday along with other incentives!

Side Note-
This location was not willing to do half rice/half noodles even if I paid extra. I didn't think that was cool considering the location on Decatur does allow.
