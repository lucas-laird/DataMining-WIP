5800340,2015-05-21,1,l1UfMEHHQni1ewUY5xe_QA,I have been searching high and low for a legitimate spot for Cemitas.. If you're unaware Cemitas is a type of torta that comes from Puebla Mexico which just happens to be where my folks are from needles to say there was no one in town making Cemitas with true Oaxaca cheese and papalo which are some of the key ingredients to a cemita well finally there is a place in Vegas that you can visit 7 days a week from 9 to 9 to receive the most authentic tasting cemita!! If you haven't tried it I defiantly recommend stoping by and giving it a taste they are conventionally sharing a spot with a dulceria which is a sort of ice cream shop that sells fresh waters and fresh fruit bowls with Mexican toppings,-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,0,1,5,dByA8JGg6Nn8wntfBbZE_g
