46534,2016-10-23,0,R073RHVTWuUc_JabjD0bsA,I loved the pizza! The ranch sauce had an awesome homemade taste and Huge servings.  beer on tap was nice and cold. I was a little worried that this place might be like chain food so I played it safe and ordered there version of a supreme pizza. First the ingredients were awesome the cheese was nice and thick and the topping were fresh the pizza was exactly what I was looking for a stray from your normal pizza joint but not so crazy it was over whelming. I was excited they had beer I always order a beer on tap to start I expected it to be flat or warm but in came in a nice chilled class and had that full beer taste. The service was awesome Our sever was super attentive and had an awesome attitude. When you walk in the vibe feels a bit week because the floor plan is set up weird I never like staring at the kitchen when I walk in. I think if they added some music it might spice it up a bit. but I think that's just the way the place was built. All and all good experience and good pizza the supreme had. there spin on it and set it apart from your normal pizza. Prices were on point I got a huge pizza couple beers and soda for like 30 bucks and had plenty to take home and eat for the next couple of days.,_P6Law-9HnhQ06BMne28ag,0,0,5,zq_XaVRe-Qnb1lKAbWjWEQ

The pizza is quite wonderful, as it is thin, crispy and tasty. The cheese melts in your mouth and the chicken wings and chicken fingers are beyond delicious.

My favorite part is the homemade ranch that they are not stingy in providing to customers. It is delicious and worth traveling to get and enjoy.

342189,2017-07-23,0,R073RHVTWuUc_JabjD0bsA,"The food here is awesome. My kids and I loved to frequent the dine in restaurant. Tonight however we ordered delivery. My sister paid with her card, everything was good until the food actually got here and we didn't have the card here. The driver took the food back because without the imprint they can't deliver food. Even though the card had been charged, even though they would throw it away, they didn't have an imprint. 

I called the restaurant because the website does not say you have to provide the card, and when I called the card in they didn't tell me the policy. The manager at the time listened and apologized however it was a new policy and the owner would not be back until Friday. Today is Saturday. I offered to send him a photo of the card, I asked them to call the card owner and none of that would suffice. He did offer to send out new food as soon as the physical card would be presented, my sister could come there or just be at my house. Considering my sister was across town and it would be at least another hour for the food to be prepared and sent out, I didn't see the point. I have kids who's were ready to eat at that time and making them wait longer wasn't fair when we had other events planned for our Saturday sleepover. 

Having the food you paid for,  taken away in front of kids is not my idea of a good time. I can respect a policy but only if it's stated and told upfront. Had I known that I would have kept the card. Or at least would have paid with mine since we split the party supplies up. The whole thing just sucked. $30 bucks of food wasted. I hope someone enjoys what I bought because we won't.",r_ZvSwesh0rBiXsmO-xB4Q,0,0,1,LIs0fHJ06rUJqGjmjqgc4Q

2 orders ago the pizza seemed not up to par but not terrible. We figured it was a fluke. 

Last night we ordered around 9pm, a little late. One pizza came fresh and hot but not tasty. The other pizza was clearly an old pizza. It was barely warm and the cheese and sausage was hard. There was no possible way that that pizza had been made fresh. 

This is very disappointing. We order on a weekly to
Bi-weekly basis, tip well and were very friendly. I don't know what's going on with them. I am very sad to lose them. I am a very loyal villa lover. Someone please notify me when it's better",ipwJV4eTY_juKFk8AVyrxg,1,0,3,5yOZbP83mRVt24CdiI71nQ

There are a few locations around Las Vegas, and every one I've been to is great. This location is just the closest to my house, so I'm there most often. Everyone that works here is so friendly, and I've never had a problem with my order EVER in years. 

Again, this is somewhere that I've been going to since I was a little kid. I'm praying they are still around by the time I have kids (in like 8 years)because this will be the only pizza place they will ever know. They can visit other places on their own and be traders, but if I ever find out they are disowned. Jk.

So I'm a simple kind of gal which makes my order a plain cheese pizza! The crush is perfect, not too crunch. The cheese and sauce are a perfect balance and one doesn't overwhelm the other. I AM A RANCH FEEN AND THEIR RANCH HERE IS LIKE LOVE IN A CUP. 

Also, the chicken wings... so good! They're teriyaki sauce is great, and is the only place I will eat teriyaki wings from. The mild sauce on the wings is good too. 

Price wise, it's a little bit more expensive than your avg Pizza Hut... but if course it is, it's made with love and tastes 10x better.",3BjkwAISuKTymGrNBDUO8Q,1,1,5,IEEMOnoCZQcEjI1nU3mq4w

Thankfully, they sell by the slice (even during dinner hours!), so I didn't inhale a whole pie- but I could have. Added pepperoni and mushroom to my slice, sprinkled on a dusting of garlic powder and parm, and got down to business. It was so freaking good I had to make myself leave before I ordered another.

First and foremost, the food's just consistently GOOD. I love the pizza, the wings, the fries, the pasta dishes, the garlic knots, the meatball sliders... the list just goes on. Point being - I've tried a lot of what they have on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed to any degree. What really sets it over the edge, though, are the prices. Lordy, any time I'm able to feed myself and two friends for less than $30, I'm just thrilled. They've also got specials galore for dine-in orders - highly recommend you check them out!

Finally, I have to give a shout out to the wonderful staff. They're always friendly, helpful, and just great at what they do overall. Service with a smile, and they're more than accommodating for whatever request we ever have. I also just appreciate everything they do as a team to give back to the community, including their kids' movie nights (Wednesdays at 6 PM) and their support for the #VEGASSTRONG movement.

We also ordered a meatball sub online, listed under hot subs pretty clear cut...the employee verified we ordered a meatball parmigiano,  exactly what we ordered under subs, but what arrives is meatballs in a dish with red sauce and cheese. Don't worry folks she is new so that eliminates her from having any responsibility, or at least that is according to the manager who we spoke to over the phone. Manager clarified that if we are unhappy even though we just had them deliver the food we could personlly bring back our uneaten food to show her that it was wrong and THEN she can do something about it...an extremely generous offer but we already waited the typical 45+ minute wait for delivery on a Friday night so surprisingly our children were ready to eat whatever food arrived despite it being incorrect. Confused about why we should need to prove what we ordered was wrong? Thanks for being so disrespectful and uncaring to your ""valued"" customers Villa.

Meatball Sandwich: I would say about a 9"" sub with 4 decent sized meatballs, some red sauce, parm and some herbs sprinkled on top. The bread was soft, meatballs tasty and their sauce was great. One of the better meatball subs I've had in a while.. 

Slice of Cheese Pizza: One of the lightest and flavorless pizzas I've ever had. The dough was airy, had a thin crust, slightly crisped on the bottom, barely any sauce and cheese was quite bland. It wasn't horrible but it felt like it was missing something?.... Maybe more sauce, something in the dough.. They had oregano, parm, red pepper flakes and garlic powder as condiments..

And you can not forget or miss out on their homemade ranch dressing--it's so good--on everything! We once ordered onions on the pizza but they were caramelized and it's not what I was expecting. Villa is a Vegas staple; I know people who were eating there in the 70's! Not cheap, so if you're looking for a cheapo pizza, look elsewhere, Overall it's good and the place itself is a bit run down with some dramatic murals painted on the wall--vintage italiano!

2268152,2012-02-27,1,R073RHVTWuUc_JabjD0bsA,"Ive had Villa Pizza on numerous occasions and always found it lacking flavor and spices in its pizza.

These review though is not for their pizza, its for their wings.

Ordered their 20 piece wings (with ranch), a side of fries and the chicken fingers (which came with fries). I thought it was a little pricey. Came to 29.83 I would expect it to be a couple dollars cheaper but i figured what the hell. It was a late sunday night and I had no other choices. Everywhere else was closed.

The gentlemen was nice on the phone, explained all the different options and prices with each. Took only a couple minutes and told me my food would be delivered in 40 minutes.

Low and behold it was here in 35 minutes. Thats good. I like them to be on time or early. The fries were very good, not greasy or soggy. Only thing I would say is next time I wish they would lightly salt them. I had to brush off some of the salt after a while.

The wings were the best wings Ive had in a while and I usually have wings about once or twice a month. They were cooked perfectly. Had a slight crunch yet were very tender. They had lots of wing sauce and it was delicious. 

I had mild and my husband had the hot.

2640815,2011-07-18,0,R073RHVTWuUc_JabjD0bsA,"I am so bummed to be writing a mediocre review for this Villa Pizza. Whenever I used to get pizza, this would be the place to go, but how the mighty have fallen. I recall about 6 months ago, we came in late one night and we ordered an XL pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. Typically, the larger the pizza, the greater the chance that the pizza will be soggy in the middle, but this XL (I think it was 18"") was super crispy everywhere! 

Fast forward to about 3 months ago and we had another Villa craving. We called in ordering a large supreme. When we got home, it was such a sloppy mess. EVERYTHING slid off before we could take any bites 
because the slice was a 90 degree angle pointing down.  

Now last week, there was a Groupon for Villa and I jumped right on that train because I had assumed that the poor experience previously was merely because we had ordered too many toppings. We came at 6PM on Tuesday for our pizza feast. I have been coming to this Villa Pizza for 6 years now and I have never seen this place so packed. The Groupon definitely did its job, but they were unprepared and understaffed; the waitress even told us so. There was one girl doing all 10 tables and we had to ask for everything about 2 or 3 times (water, ranch, napkins, more water). 

We ordered their sampler which had fries, wings, chicken tenders, and mozzarella sticks. This was pretty good and the kids really enjoyed it (what kid doesn't love fried stuff?). However, when our pizza came out with our measly two toppings, the pizza was soggy in the center, AGAIN. I cannot get over the soggy center of a pizza since there are so many places that can make it better, so unfortunately, I will probably give them one more try, but if they fail again, I will have to seek new refuge for my NY style pizza cravings.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,3,0,3,Xzogir-S1P4KZROkQkXnYA

Not once, not twice but three times on three DIFFERENT occasions she has been completely out of line.  First was after dining in with my family I asked for a cup to put my son's drink in to go and she told me, with an attitude, that she wasn't allowed to give me a cup.  
Second was when I went to dine in with a friend who just moved here from New York.  We're both from New York and I wanted to let her know that I found a decent pizzeria out here.  After we ordered a bunch of food, we realized that we ordered with our eyes.  I was already full and more food was still coming out from the kitchen!  No big deal, right?  You can just ask for boxes to box up your ALREADY PAID FOR FOOD!!!  Nope!!!! It's not like I'm trying to be greedy and ask for a box at an all-you-can-eat buffet after piling my plate with a ton of food!  I paid for every last thing I wanted to box up and take home!  When I asked for a box... she told me that she is not able to give me one because that's how they keep their prices so low!!!  Which aren't that low, by the way!!  
Thirdly and lastly... I was there today with my husband and son, again, dining in.  Since my son had just finished up his soccer game and it was dinner time for the 3 of us, I wanted to order quickly and ordered without looking at the menu knowing that we wanted to keep it simple to pizza and mozzarella sticks. When the mozzarella sticks came, it came with ranch dressing instead of marinara sauce.  When I asked NICELY to please have marinara sauce, she replied ""mmm hmm!""  When she came back with the marinara sauce, she said, ""next time you order mozzarella sticks and want marinara sauce instead, can you please let us know so we don't waste our ranch dressing!""  I let it go by saying, ""no problem!""  But it was a problem... I was livid!!  I didn't want to have a confrontation with her, let alone in front of my son, but I am very mad for allowing her to get away with speaking to me like that, not once but 3 times!  
I lost my appetite and wanted to leave immediately!  My husband even joked, ""oh no, now you're going to have to ask her for boxes.""  And I said, if she gives me a problem with that, then I'm absolutely opening my mouth!  Luckily for her, there was another very nice brunette female behind the counter who answered instead of her and said no problem and went and got me a box for my entire order of unfinished food.  
I also wanted to let her know that this pizzeria that she works in claims to sell New York style pizza.... even having Times Square painted all over the walls.  Now, I'm from New York... Brooklyn, New York... only having moved out here from Brooklyn 8 months ago!  Never have I EVER went into a pizzeria in Brooklyn, The Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island or Queens that served ranch dressing with their mozzarella sticks!  I shouldn't have to ask for marinara sauce.  It should be automatic!  Never eating there again because of the service from that one female!",RhJEGx4Je5J8g7_X8OdzNg,0,0,2,xYt3v5cXm0Vke0OJ3iCmCg

This was so great! We got there in the nick of time and got a table. It was packed moments later. They projected a movie on a big screen which was excellent for the kids. They brought them out par-baked crust and let them build their own pizzas.  They had a blast. 
Adults ordered Caesar salad, wings and the white eggplant pizza. Salad was yummy. The wings were soggy. Needed to be crispier. Pizza had zero flavor whatsoever. It was described as white pizza with eggplant and roasted tomato. This was dry and the slices of almost raw tomatoes on top were not the roasted tomatoes o envisioned. So disappointing. It needed garlic, oil, herbs...something!! Even the standard kids pizza was like cardboard. Crust was not good. 
Beers were cheap, and the service was super friendly. Love the movie, array of board games, chill atmosphere and idea of kids night but the food needs work! Honestly, I would return for kids night because it was a fun thing to do. I hope it was a fluke and the pizza will be better.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,0,0,2,x2GiTQLjy0EWw9-XgZudIA

4236838,2014-09-07,0,R073RHVTWuUc_JabjD0bsA,"This is a really good place. 

The owner is there hand making each pizza. The dough is fresh, and then rolled out, not frozen. He is very generous with the cheese and the toppings. The Pizza is baked in an old fashioned pizza oven.

The staff is very courteous and friendly.

I took out a three topping pizza, and the toppings smothered the cheese. 

The large fed five hungry men, and none were looking beyond that second piece of pizza.

The only reason I can't do five stars is because it was pricey, $20 for a large 3 topping, and it had that ""greasy"" taste on the crust.

Overall, this is much better than Grimaldi's and Settebello's, and a much better value, even though I think it is pricey (compared with Costco). It is a family place, and I don't reccomend it to impress on a date.

Food: I ordered a caesar salad and a slice of pepperoni pizza while my boyfriend got the steamed mussels in a tomato sauce with bread. He loved the mussels and claims they are the best ones he's eaten in a long time. My salad was good--hard to get salad wrong--but I thought the pizza was lacking in flavor, which I think may have come from the cheese. It's a shame but I suppose there has to be some flaw. 4/5.

Service: Overall, nothing to complain about. We were greeted immediately and our waitress was attentive. Our food arrived quickly and we were never left hanging. 5/5.

Ambience: This had a typical pizza bar atmosphere with casual seating and TVs tuned to sports channels. The restaurant and bathrooms showed signs of wear but were certainly clean. 5/5.",d44eoG6xgcs6X6jaU-hiQQ,0,0,5,rppnr80mTGZve0_sIuRD2w

Now that that's out of the way, the food! You know it has to be good when there are folks sitting outside in their cars eating a slice (which is exactly what I did when I got mines). I ordered a margherita pizza - large 17.99- and a 6 pack of Sierra mist. Pizza was, in a word, amazing. What do they put in the crust?! Like little breaded angels with wings made of pizza sauce that make the most satisfying crunch when you bite into them. Okay, that got a little weird. But, I digress, the pizza was probably the best I have ever eaten and I've been looking for some good pizza for the full 4 years I have lived here and this little gem was right around the corner? Shame on me! Took them about 15 mins to get my order ready and I opted for pick up instead of delivery.

5213727,2016-05-24,8,R073RHVTWuUc_JabjD0bsA,"OK so I hate being a downer but I am pissed.  We order takeout from Villa 3-4 times a month if not more.  Today the hubs and I called for delivery at around 11:30.  We were told that delivery wouldn't be until after 1:00pm.  So rather that wait I said we'd get off our lazy butts and come pick it up ourselves.  

Our order was simple.  One large cheese pie and 2 chicken ceasar salads.  I asked for the chicken on the side as we were eating those salads for dinner.  Ashley kindly told me that's how it's always prepared (on the side)!  Fast forward to 12:15 when my loving husband goes in to pick up our food.  Guess what?  Hot chicken is on the salad, not the side.  As he was unwilling to wait for them to redo their mess up he took the order and we came home.  Since I don't want wilted lettuce for dinner I decided to take the chicken off myself.  To my dismay they didn't even put a whole f'n chicken breast on the salads!  It was a few pieces.  Now I'm really pissed!  These salads here are not cheap at $10 for lettuce, chicken and dressing.

If this was the first time or maybe the second or third time I've had an issue I would look the other way.  The food here is awesome but their staff continually makes mistakes.  The last issue we had was where they delivered our order to the wrong address.  We discussed the proper address 2 times and they still got it wrong.  So our food arrived on the cool side.  It's sad because me as a customer gets no satisfaction at their continued mistakes.  I could go on and tell you about the time we didn't get our salad dressings or the time they put our side of meatballs in with my moms order of chicken parm plate, yeah all together as one meal.  WTH? Its crap there is no consistency! And what's worse is we are expected to tip.  I'm no a-hole but it's disgusting to tip and not get what is expected.  Sadly Villa is one of a handful of decent pizza places in our area.  As I said, the food is good just don't have high expectations on getting what you want. 

This all may sound like it's not a big deal but when you are paying good money you expect proper service and accuracy.  Their job is to fulfill my order.  Nothing more, nothing less. Food gets a 5 but service gets a 2 if not less.",9KCoXFS7alSJsGfFsZANFQ,16,7,2,75qneiR24v7FKZoyvtxmdg

We also like going to the actual restaurant - we've done plenty of take out from here, but now with a LO, we like finding kid friendly places, and they are really kid friendly!  

Our latest visit was the other night - after we visited the Opportunity Village Halloween town.  Great choice!  We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and the fries with cheese - both were a big hit with our LO.  

In the past, we've gotten pizzas with ham, sausage, olives, mushrooms - all are really good toppings.  The crust is really great, and they usually don't burn it - it's a rarity when that happens.  We've also gotten the garlic knots in the past - which are awesome!  Service is always pretty good - if you're doing pickup though after normal work hours (5-6pmish), you might be waiting a bit cause they get super busy with people calling in orders, picking up orders, etc.
