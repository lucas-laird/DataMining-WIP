I love sashimi and this place offers it on their AYCE menu, and theyre not shy giving in a proportional amount. I dig the screem inor gazim, raw oysters and most specially their soft shell crab. The chefs are attentive and accommodating, staffs always smile and checking if everything's ok. The only thing i can point out that i hope they'll include to the AYCE is to have a dessert (even one mochi will do!), but for the reasonable price, im alright with the free Oranges..! :)",L59L8SPh1Qfp8pe0IX8rmw,0,0,5,ksTwZ2kCopbmFsA66w_URg

They have an all-you-can-eat deal for around ~$25.  Most all you can eat sushi places either have a very limited menu or their fish is shitty.  The fish here is as good as any normal sushi spot but it's ALL YOU CAN EAT!  I've never had so much sashimi in one sitting..  I've been to quite a few all you can eat sushi places with my friends.  After an hour or so we start getting dirty looks from the chefs or the portions become smaller and smaller.  The chefs here are always nice and never skimp on portions.  It's never too crowded (at least when I've been there) and the crowd is mostly locals from what I can tell.  It's only 10 mins off the strip.  If you're a sushi lover and have an immense appetite, this is the place to park your big fat ass!

now about the food....the sushi was good.  not the best, but it was good.  i really like that staff there. super friendly.  when you do AYCE, they let you order whatever you want, made however you want.  if you feel like extra masago, you can get extra masago.  if you want spicy mayo on sashimi with a lemon wedge, you can do that too.  you get the drift.  

you know how some AYCE places pack on the rice on their rolls and sushi, this place doesnt.  

also, i like the wide selection of appetizers.  

another useful tip, you can order 1/2 orders of the various rolls so you can have the freedom to sample ALL the rolls, like i do! =)

156367,2013-08-22,2,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"In one word - EW.  I do not write reviews normally, but the customer service is so terrible I must warn fellow yelpers.  I will try be fair in my comments here and give credit where it's due (almost no where). Came here because a coworker loves it.

Before we get into the owner/manager's attitude problem, let's talk about the food first. We did the AYCE menu for dinner. the fact that they offer sashimi is a plus. I will say that the basics like salmon and hamachi were ok. Soft shell crab was ok too.  But what is up with the Kama that took only three minutes to come out and has the texture of fish jerky? Also, the cajun albacore was not seared... more like half cooked to a hard texture. The uni was questionable in color for sure - almost brown. I wish I had read warnings about that, and the big ball of rice in previous reviews prior to going. We did over-order unfortunately, and my friend wanted to get all our orders of uni in one go - there were four of us. I interrupted and said let's get half for now, which would be 8 pieces.  Well, guess the server heard what my friend said but ignored what I said.  Because 16 pieces came out.  We wanted to send it back but then decided to just suck it up... what could go wrong? A LOT. 

Not all of us ate it because of the weird color.  My friend was struggling to eat it all, so he left some rice.  The server took our plates away with the rice, and warned us that because this is AYCE if we continue to leave rice, they will have to charge us. OK, point taken.  So we were good about the rest of the rice we had. But no matter.  They charged us $12 extra for the rice anyway.  And tack on 18% gratuity for our party of four. It would have been nice to be given the chance to rectify our mistake instead of just taking the plates and adding the charge. But whatever.  We did not dispute it.  We did, however, we feel compelled to let the server know that she made a mistake of bringing out 16 pieces. So we told her upon paying. All she needed to say was sorry, we misundestood each other. But instead, she decided to get defensive and said we ordered a lot of sashimi anyway (so?), she had to charge us extra for the unfinished rice from the sushi... which, btw,  we did not even bring up. Then she grabs whom I shall call crazy old bat (and I assume is the owner). 

Well, COB began to throw her arms and get all defensive about how 8 means 8 orders of two, and then got all defensive again about the extra charge. Again, we were not disputing it. Just pointing out your error. COB also turned her back to us, pointed at our credit cards in the server's hand, and told the server in this matter-of-fact tone to ""just charge them!"" then walked away without letting us finish what we had to say. What a psycho. Perhaps there was miscommunication on both our parts, but to be talked down to like that is a whole other issue I am NOT ok with. I am in the service industry and I can't imagine anyone in our company talking to a customer like that and keeping their job.  Bill came to almost $40 per person.  

I'm giving this one star because yelp makes you give a minimum of one. Whatever point they scored was quickly taken to a zero with that crap show they gave at the end. EW! Take a hike, hikari.",gv7STvfMSzJ3T8i6nlQIPQ,9,2,1,NkMGq_QQTaQTgJXnDnPVXw

The service sucked! I guess I caught them during shift change, but that's no excuse for the crappy service! Seemed like the 2 sushi chef's were pissed off about something and was venting to a server and guests'. When I did place my order, they pretty much forgot what I just told them and just gave me 1 of the 3 different types of sushi I ordered. This happened during the whole 45 mins I was there! 
Keep in mind it was not that busy! Only about 10 people total in the whole restaurant/sushi bar. 

On to the food...other than the sweet shrimp sushi, the food was just OK. I tried to order and sample all the offerings that place had, some were, when I got it, OK...some when I got it, were misses! I ordered some uni, it looked like the color was a little off. A friend of mine ordered the deep fried oysters, after waiting for about 10 minutes it finally came out. How painful it is to watch it being served to guest! It looked like they left the oysters in the deep fryer, forgot about it, and then tried to serve it! It looked like a very very deep brown, almost black stones on a plate! What a shame! 

I think if I had ordered some sake and got drunk...then maybe I would have forgotten about all the negatives. Oh well!

For me personally, $27 is worth it. I guess I'm willing to sacrifice some quality for the quantity. AYCE hamachi, maguro, salmon, shrimp tempura, natto rolls, tofu, super white... it's enough for me. My friends like the hamachi kama, oysters, and seaweed salad.

Which brings me to a very interesting dilemma: what do you do when you absolutely detest a place for the way they behave themselves, yet have really good five star food?

The result: the three stars. Don't, even for a moment, doubt their food. I cannot praise them enough for how good their food is, especially considering it's in the middle of nowhere. Come on, I'm from San Diego, we get good fish. I've been to Hawaii, Hong Kong, places where they can actually get fresh fish. I'm not going to say that all their fish is amazing, but you can quickly focus in on the good stuff.

However, I have no problem treating a restaurant as well as they treat me. In this case, you can clearly see that I am unhappy (to say the least).

One star lost: we were 5 minutes late for our reservation. If they want to play that way, fine, nobody deserves grace, why should they? We lost our reservation at the sushi bar simply because they wouldn't wait for us. We wanted to tip them for being accommodating, but we couldn't find the occasion.

Two other stars lost: for parties of 4 OR MORE, 18% GRATUITY FORCED UPON. So their $$ rating is deceitful, just like their service and general ways about things! Ironic, huh! So you don't really get to say your mind about how well they're doing because they know the general number of people in a typical party. My advice: go in pairs. If you believe they deserve 18%, by all means you should give it to them. But for an experience that I had tonight, they would have been lucky to receive 10%.

So five minus one minus ought be only two stars, right? Well, last time we didn't have these issues. Granted, the gratuity thing was just as true last year as this, but last year we had a lot of fun talking with the chefs. This year, we had to deal with a waitress that was very much subpar, general distaste at their practices, and other buffets that did much better than them, not to mention coming on Black Friday, when people are still supposed to be grateful.",uU4UF37vJi0E4stGgHLk3w,1,1,3,JYVx7XfwH-Xxm4Zo_RM5NA

1. The service was VERY VERY VERY SLOW. We had our order sitting on the counter waiting for the server to serve us, she finally came after the food has been sitting for more than 15 minutes, to be exact 17 minutes sitting under room temperature. 
2. Then when we do get the food, we had the yellow tail, OMG the fish does look yellow alright because it is not fresh. I spit it out very quick!
3. My sister ordered a hot tea, it came hot alright. Then after over 1 hour nobody bothered to check on her tea if she wants to top it off with hot water. I have to drink my mom's water because my water is already gone and after waiting for over an hour with no refill I finally drank my mom's. We did tell the server mind you.
4. Party of 4 or more automatic 18% gratuity! Really?! Unless you live in Timbuktu where party of 4 or more is rare. Party of 4 essentially mom, dad and 2 kids. I don't mind giving the gratuity if they deserve it. They did an awful job.

Before I finished removing the last stray splinter from my chopsticks...the 2 dozen oysters, assorted sashimi, soft shell crab, tuna poki, various rolls, MAGICALLY APPEARED.  Hikari must definitely hold some record for fastest delivery of sushi because I don't even get my fast food that fast.

Went on a Friday night (June 15 2013) arriving just before opening as we had tickets for a show ..
Chose table seating, which was positioned outside of the 'sushi-bar' itself - at their u-shape ""Benihana' cooking area where we were joined by a Japanese group of 12 whose 'leader' made pleasant conversation w/us (husb and self) remarking on goodness of various items as they were served.
We enjoyed Yellowtail, Tuna and Salmon sashimi.  Presentation not for sushi snobs!! Fresh and tasty and generous portions.
We enjoyed spider roll, spicy tuna roll (too spicy for wimpy me) Califoria roll and uni too!
Service was really really good considering how busy they were . orders were promptly filled.
Next time will try their oysters and tempura.
the only thing I would comment that was not so terrific is their sake .. tasted old but considering how much of it they served, I doubt it was .. Next time we will have cold beer!

769677,2011-12-23,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"This is my first review in Yelp. I have to tell everyone my experience.

Food quality:
To be honest, the oysters was acceptable( but the size was super small). 
The raw fish sucked. The quality was like the bargain sale item in supermarket. Not fresh. I doubt the fish is not for sashimi. 
The uni: I witnessed  the chef ask the helper inside the kitchen to exchange the display window uni when we ordered uni sashimi. errr...
We also order grill yellowtail head. My piece of head had over 60% ""dark"" area. (I noticed that the same item he serve to the other ""Japanese"" looks nice.)
Soft shell crab: frozen, oilly and covered with super much powder. 
Unagi: small, dry. 
The most important part of a nigiri: rice. Don't order nigiri! The chef doesn't want to make it since he DOES NOT KNOW how to make. The ratio of the fish and rice is doesn't make any sense. Super much rice with thin fish. I know the fish was not that fresh. What about the rice? I agree that the rice itself is good, but not for sushi. You cannot hold the rice with chopsticks! Once you touch the rice, it fall down. 

My story:
I went there around 10:00pm since I yelped that there is discount for girl after 10:00pm. The restaurant is small and old (They have no table. You have to sit on the bar that face to face with the chef). There was only two other parties in the restaurant. My gf and I got a seat quickly and started order. The food on their menu (a piece of paper) are very limited. We filled in the order sheet. I passed it to one of the waitress. She asked me to order with the chef directly. Okay, I gave the order sheet to the chef (a ""true"" Japanese man, I'll tell you why). He first refused to get that sheet because he want us to order verbally. But We don't want to read every order out one by one like an idiot. I explained to  him that it is too much to read.(I don't think he could memorize everything tought.) He finally got the sheet. He asked me if I want the sashimi or nigiri. I said nigiri. I asked him if they have Toro. He asked me to go to somewhere cross the street. That Japanese chef said we are difficult to serve in Japanese. And he was making fun of us with the other customers(they all speak Japanese.) My gf and I spoke English all the time, I think that chef must thought that we don't understand Japanese. I acted like I don't understand Japanese. He kept speaking Japanese to us and joking around with the others who speak Japanese. He was complaining us in front of us! Okay, I keep silence because we were so hungry, we don't want to go to another place. We waited for like 15 mins. During that time, the others kept ordering food in Japanese. Yes, they ordered late, their food came first! We had nothing to eat, not even a piece of sushi! Then I ordered some sashimi and oysters because I think that kind of raw food might come faster. I was right. The Japanese chef didn't want to make nigiri. If you order sashimi, he will serve it very fast. We quickly finished some ""can-eat"" item. We left. Two hour after that, we were both in the restroom of the hotel. Which part did I spend most time in the hotel? Restroom!

Next up I was excited for the Uni since you can have up to 4 orders. For people that didn't realize, Uni is supposed to be bright orange and not brown like this place...Failed #2. 

I decided to give the cooked foods a try and ordered the calamari and gyoza. The calamari was super chewy and the gyoza was obviously prepackaged but they somehow managed to butcher that....Failed #3

Finally dessert isn't included and this dump came out to $35 a person. My wife and I didn't like a single thing at this place. If you want all you can eat GOOD sashimi go to Kaze for $20.

852863,2010-11-01,2,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"$26.95.. AYCE...... SASHIMI included ?!?! 

Two thumbs up! 

I have no idea how they did it but the food came out extremely fast with the quantity that our party of 12 ordered. 

I wouldn't recommend coming as a huge group as they would either miss a couple of orders or your order may be combined with someone else's on the other end of the teppanyaki table. (Teppan not included.. they just sat us there). 

Loved: 
- Fish was not fishy 
- Fish was cold (just the right temperature) 
- Sashimi! 
- Do not skimp on portions so you don't have to order the same thing 10 times 
- AYCE uni and ama ebi sashimi??? unheard of! 
- Fried and raw oysters 
- The win roll --- must try 
- Salmon was wonderful 

Not so much: 
- The way we ordered, we had to tell her what we wanted. It would have been more accurate if we could mark what we wanted on paper. 
- The fish in the end tasted kinda bland, there was no distinct taste to most of the fish, but, it's way better than gross fishiness 


Verdict: 
- Will come again next time I'm in Vegas 
- Come in a manageable group so people won't have to scream out their orders hoping the waitress got it 

Note: 
- They let you order anything on their nigiri portion of the menu as sashimi!!!!!!

Afterthought:
- I wish they had the fresh oysters plain without the siracha and green onions.",mnhSpJ8ZJZ-H2Ra6FrQxaw,2,2,4,wgg29VfyVha_WM7zoLXYKQ

924588,2009-01-19,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Wow, what can I say?  Hikari was absolutely amazing.

Here is the true story of two roommates' quest to find a great Sashimi dinner:  After weeks of my roommates telling me how amazing and wonderful this place is I finally gave in and decided to go with them to try the place out.  Being an absolute sushi/sashimi-aholic, I really couldn't believe that an AYCE sushi place would have fish of the quality that they were speaking of and allow you to get it sashimi style as well.

After days of hype we left at 2:00 PM in the afternoon and drove the 3.5 hours from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to have dinner at Hikari; let me just say that it really blew me away.  Sure, it doesn't look like much from the outside, it's far off the strip and doesn't look nearly as nice or have the same flare as some of the restaurants on or close to the strip but the modest environment is a stark contrast to the quality of the fish being served.

Even as the food was being served, I was still a bit skeptical that Hikari would ever live up to the hype; the first plate of sashimi to arrive was poorly cut and torn in places, it wasn't beautifully arranged nor was ostentatious in any way but WOW, looks can really be deceiving.  The quality of their fish is outstanding.  I must have had every kind of sashimi that they had to offer there this included:

Salmon
Yellowfin
""Superwhite"" tuna
Akami
Albacore
Unagi
Baked Mussels
Raw Oysters
Soft Shelled Crab
Seared Ahi
a grilled fish tail (wasn't sure of the exact fish but I think Ahi)

These are just the things that I can think of off the top of my head but let me just say that the freshness of the fish was as good as any of best sushi restaurants that I've had in L.A. and San Fransisco at places that aren't AYCE.  The fish melts in your mouth like it should, I didn't have a single piece of tough meat and while it had all the right flavors, I felt that it had none of the ""fishy"" smell or taste.  Absolutely nothing was chewy and the second round of the sashimi platter that came around actually had much better knife work.

Furthermore, the waitstaff was very attentive they came by just often enough to make sure that everything was fine while not so much that if felt like they were intrusive.  I do agree with one of the previous posters about how my tea wasn't refilled often enough, nor was it hot enough for my tastes but, frankly, if the only thing that you can bitch and moan about (can you say b!tch?) is the temperature and the frequency of refills on your tea, you really don't have a case to make.

I do wish there was a 4.5 star option because I feel that the presentation really wasn't that impressive and the decor really isn't all that appealing but I decided that truly, the quality of the fish that I had tonight really pushed it over the top.  Also, I don't know how any of the rolls are as I didn't try any of them but but if you're hungry and a fish aficionado, Hikari really is a place that you must try. 

As a note on some of the other reviews that I've read here about the freshness and quality of the fish, I understand that fish, like any other (good) food product is often a victim of availability.  It may just be that I came in on a night where the chefs had some very fresh, very good fish come in, future visits will determine whether the fantastic fish that I had tonight was a fluke or if Hikari really is everything that my first visit has shown it to be.

All in all Hikari isn't fancy, it isn't the lights and attractions of the Strip.  What it is is good, honest sashimi, an attentive and dare I say, cute waitstaff, and most importantly, it's fresh fish.",HUJnIQqhRpybQpysyGJczg,1,1,5,nz4o-TppXmbnDh-ndAEvYQ

We started to order and got our food quickly, as we were eating and gave my 2  yr. old son a shrimp for him to nibble on.  The manager comes over and says that my son can not share our food if we are going to do the AYCE (ALL YOU CAN EAT) and I must order a separate dish for him or get charge $26.99 for his portion of AYCE SUSHI.  I told her that he's only 2 and won't eat much, she said its policy, I asked her why it's not on the menu or anywhere in the restaurant for patrons to see, so I told her she's being ridiculous and she walked away.  5 min later she's standing against a wall watching us to see if we are still sharing our food with him and came over again and told us again, I told here that this was the same shrimp from the first time and my wife got pissed and told her off and made a scene, so other people in the restaurant would know the bullshit this manager was making us do, so we ordered a side of tempura shrimp for him for $6.99 to shut the DUMB BITCH UP and it came with 4 shrimps, my son only ate 1/2 of 1 of the 4 shrimps.  The experience for the first time there will make us never go back there again and the quality is not up to the $26.99 charge and no desert included too and the menu options are not as extensive as other AYCE SUSHI restaurants we've been too, like SUSHI KAYA on Spring Mtn, that we go to at least 3 times a month.

My favorite was the Agedashi Tofu, the Tempura Shrimp and the Salmon Skin Salad..but then again, I did not eat alot of Sushi as I am currently nursing.

My hubbie however had lot's of Sushi. The negative was the quality of the seafood. The Uni color was awkward, the Oysters looked strange too and the Sashimi was not appealing. To make it short, shortly after eating my hubbie got a stomache ache..

It's always the same items. However, Leonard W knew of an AYCE Japanese spot about 5 miles away from the strip so before we left Vegas, decided to check out Hikari for some $27 AYCE!

The place is quite small and most of the people are local but we were able to get a seat at the sushi bar, which really is the place to sit.  You can order whenever you want and the chefs work super fast to bring your order out.

Decided to order the following items:

+ Salmon skin salad - the dressing was sorta like... a sweet teriyaki dressing. LOTS of salmon skin.
+ Sashimi sampler - came with tuna, salmon and hamachi sashimi.  Good combo!
+ Fried soft shell crab - whole pieces of fried crab. Yum :]
+ Japanese style oysters - oysters with a little of tabasco and some vinegar.  Some people ordered by the plates. Ridiculous.
+ Negi hama - very simple roll with hamachi and green onion. The only roll we ordered, since we wanted to focus on the items that were worth more!
+ Hama kama - yellowtail fish collar. As many as you want!
+ Unagi nigiri - soliddddd! I think I ate 2 orders just by myself haha.
+ Shrimp tempura - ONLY shrimp. Hikari is awesome.
+ Shrimp fried rice - nicely done, with the rice fluffly.
+ Uni sushi - still learning to love it but... for the uni lovers, NO LIMIT on how many you can have!
+ Frallops - nice crunch and could probably do without the aioli and eat it with katsu sauce instead, but man, fried scallop may just be my new seafood obsession.

Also, rather than order sushi, nigiri, or the sashimi sampler you can order sashimi only!  We got salmon, tuna, fatty white tuna, seared albacore, and hamachi.  Yes, it was probably frozen but still, it's quite fresh for an AYCE spot and they are not shy with the portion!  

Ladies, go after 10p and you can get the ""hot girl"" discount!

Hikari is definitely a great find and I'm still amazed how you can just order whatever you want and they won't even raise a fuss. The service was great too, and the people working at the restaurant are actually Japanese, so that's always a plus. Can't wait to go back!",LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,5,5,4,HvegPZLvmYFDMHhFXcua0Q

Prior arrival, me and friends noticed their rating has gone down but we didn't care much, and now we know why. We had all you can eat sushi. One of my friends said their oysters are really good so he ordered 2 dozens at one time. He regretted after the first bite. He said its not as fresh and sauce is bad. 
I don't wanna list all the stuff we ordered. All I can say is there's more cons than pros. 
 
Pros 
1. There's an option to get sashimi instead of sushi(with rice)
2. Server is friendly 
3. Salmon is fresh 
4. takes reservation

Cons
1. a lot of orders were not fresh that day 
2. server got confused and gave us the wrong amount of orders 
3. the seats are too close to other people. Feels like we are all eating at the same table
4. Less items on the menu then similar restaurants

1242285,2011-12-29,1,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"I don't know why I even bother with AYCE sushi. As picky as I am, even top notch buffets are hardly satisfying. It was curiosity I supposed? 

Hikari isn't too bad if you factor in the price but is sub-par comparing to regular sushi joints. The AYCE rules are simple and there are almost no restrictions. Basically everything on the menu is all you can eat. They would offer (or encourage) sashimi instead of nigiri. Sounds good right? 

The Pros:
- Fresh uni, ame ebi and ikura that are of acceptable quality. No limit and you can have them sashimi style.
- Fresh oysters. Small but sweet.
- Made to order nigiri directly from sushi chef.
- Ran by Japanese chefs and waitstaff.
- No wait time at all.
- Very affordable price.

The Cons:
- Fish choice is rather limited. No higher end items and only very basic selection.
- Some of the sashimi was too cold just barely defrosted.
- Fish quality are very mediocre. Don't expect the better cuts. 
- Sushi preparation seemed rushed. Understandable since the chefs were super busy but not completely excusable. Some sashimi slices weren't even totally cut through.
- Some sushi was drenched in sauce. Ask chef to hold the sauce if you have more delicate tastebuds. 
- One of the chef has a bit of personalities so the friendliness of the service you received might vary depending on how much he likes you. 
- Dessert not included in the AYCE price and they only have grocery quality mochi and ice cream.

If you are on a tight budget but craving sushi, Hikari might be your answer. It is still better than places like Todai or the sushi counters at Wynn or Bellagio. Skip it if you are a real sushi lover.",41HLwXnR0Lm3NUp01cIOQg,3,1,2,_ZXI3r50WiiyR8y_SopsHA

Everything was fine until he didn't agree with what we wants to order quantity wise, so he became a little bit aggressive. As a family, we noticed his aggressive behavior and immediately became uncomfortable. We told him that his tone of voice was not how a regular customer should be spoken to, so we asked to speak to the manager. No manager was there at that very moment and this sushi chef became more aggressive saying ""We don't need customers like you, just get out! Stupid. Stupid."" So then we waited for the manager to arrive and we told him the entire situation yet the manager didn't want the rude sushi chef to apologize for his behavior. 
With his being said, with our experience no customer should be talked to in that manner and have to deal with a rude sushi chef. Come at own risk.",93H8v_0BNck9TVyjmcSnbA,0,0,1,O8HGAtmC1mKNgxeiDs1YmQ

1270410,2013-01-05,4,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"**** ABSOLUTELY THE WORST AYCE SUSHI RESTAURANT IN VEGAS******

I do not know how can this restaurant has 4 stars rating.  I have been to a lot of AYCE sushi restaurants, and this one is absolutely the worst one.  I like they have the Sushi and Sashimi option.  But guys, please try to avoid the sushi option if you do not want a ridiculous amount of rice and get charge extra after.  

First, they are out of few fishes that day( sea urchin, one of the reason i went there, but not available) , which was disappointed. Service was ridiculous. Manager fought with me because I complained the food was not fresh, i could not eat it.  The salmon was pure orange with zero fat in there, the scallop was extremely unfresh, i just do not think they have anything fresh there.  

We had a group of 13 that night, so we ordered about 5 order of sushi for most order, which is 10 pieces.  And when the sushi came, we were surprised how fishy and unfresh the sushi were.  We tried to eat whatever was fresh and the leftover were not fresh, and i told the manager afterward that we cannot eat the unfresh sushi and she gave me attitude right away and told me i should not order so many food at the beginning and told me I should just order one order of the sushi to try it out before placing more order.  HEY BxTCH, i understand  you do not want us to waste food but seriously, do you expect a group of 13 to order one order per sushi ? 

The customer service was ridiculous , it's unacceptable these day, i am in the customer service industry, i always put my customer in the first priority.  I will never ever go back there again and HIGHLY  RECOMMEND EVERYONE NOT TO GO THERE.  

There's a lot of AYCE sushi in Vegas and this place is definately not worth the money and most importantly the customer service.

1352464,2014-08-08,1,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Still the ONLY AYCE in town that serves sashimi (not including sea urchin and sweet shrimp anymore). 

Priced at $26.95 per person (auto gratuity for parties larger than 4). 

A lot of the workers are new. I only recognize one of the 3 chefs at the bar from my last visit (end of last year). Not even sure if its owned by the same person anymore. Used to be owned by a chef that used to work at the sushi bar. Then later spotted just walking around. Now, who knows. Lol

Fish quality is pretty fresh. Sashimi combo (included in ayce) is a combination plate consisting of salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and white fish (i might be missing one ...). few slices of each thing. Don't expect a good presentation because it won't be. The sweet shrimp are VERY small (small enough that they require two shrimps per nigiri). Sea urchin quality was ok. Look wise, it looked horrible. Taste, was decent. Slightly sweet. Quality ranges at this restaurant for the sea urchin. If you had it good once, it may not be good the next time (poor QC on sea urchin). 

As mentioned, sashimi is not included for sea urchin and sweet shrimp, as well as unagi, so they had to be ordered nigiri style. Their rice portion is HUGE. Like its almost difficult to put entire nigiri piece into your mouth. I'm not particular saying im in favor for those who have a huge piece of fish and a small amount of rice (like a lot of AYCE sushi places in So Cal) but proportions is important. They completely had it opposite. HUGE rice, small fish. Not a fan of their rice recipe either. Really sticky and falls apart easily (due to size too). 

Appetizers range from the usual tempura and hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) to the more rarely seen soft-shelled crabs. 

Their roll selection is not that big (in comparison to other AYCE places like sushi mon, goyemon, or even twister) but eh... not much of a roll eater anyway. 

Service is pretty good. Very attentive on drinks (water and tea) as well as empty plates being removed fairly fast. 

This place is still my parents, and some family's favorite restaurant to go to because they are not much of a rice eater (in terms of nigiri)

I still wont try the raw oysters though. Despite how ""fresh"" they may say it is. Many times (not myself) i have seen/heard others complaining about stomach aches/food poisoning after eating the raw oysters. I'm not a raw oyster fan to begin with so I avoid it naturally. I've ate with a group who all but myself had tried the oysters and they all had stomach problems. And i didnt. Which gave us the conclusion its the oysters. Try at your own risk.

If you have a party of 4 and over tipping is included- 4 and over?!  If the quality was good and the owner didn't have such a bad attitude I'd be willing to recommend this to my buddies and understand the amount of people required to automatically tip 18%.

Overall, this is an establishment that I wouldn't want to support, and that is why I'm writing this review.  Besides the unreasonable owner, bad sushi (the salmon tasted like rubber with uniformed cut up bite sizes, wtf?!  I didnt like it), rude experience, we should have heeded the warning when two customers left without eating.  Probably because the wait was so long to get their food.

I was a little disappointed, not so much with the food. But with the selection. There really isn't much to choose from, which I can understand. They had a couple selections of rolls to choose from too. After a while, my palette got bored of the sashimi I kept ordering. The fish was good. Service was good...

1475986,2015-12-15,9,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"I came here despite the declining reviews, based on my BF's memories of this spot: he recalls endless oysters included in AYCE ($28/pp), specifically. As other reviews have stated, the oysters (and uni) now come limited to 4 orders (of 2) per person (making a total of 8/person). Luckily, I'm not huge into oysters, so I tried a couple (fresh!) and let him have the rest. 

Another huge perk offered here is the inclusion of a sashimi plate (1/person) in the AYCE- menu says this has three slices of four fishes, but the plate we ordered had a few more slices than indicated and they were generously cut.

Slightly smaller menu of nigiri offered here, and very limited roll selection- mostly focused on simple maki rolls and basic Americanized rolls (most are variations of California roll). I'd stick to the nigiri, sashimi, and oysters for best experience.

Restaurant layout and service were odd. Large space is mostly utilized as separate grill tables for hibachi diners, leaving just one back corner for the sushi bar, where seating fills up fast.  Sushi chef seemed reluctant to take large orders and would walk away in the middle of our order after requesting 3 orders of nigiri. Conversation and smiles were nonexistent until the end of our meal, when the older chef assisted us with a final order that didn't involve cutting us off or walking away.

As a vegetarian, there are ridiculously limited options when eating out at Japanese restaurants, so I go in expecting that the items I do get are fresh, delicious, and up to par. Hikari did not do any of these things. 

Miso soup - really hard to mess this one up, and they did not. It's miso soup, not much to report. 

Vegetable tempura - YUCK. Whoever cooked these does not know the first thing about cooking vegetables. Not only were they mushy on the inside, but they did not taste fresh at all. No crunch, all mush. Disgusting. 

Trying to compose myself and order something that cannot possibly get messed up, I ordered some mochi ice cream. Make that freezer-burned mochi ice cream. Are you serious?! You can't even keep MOCHI fresh, god knows how old the vegetable dishes I ate were. 

If you are a vegetarian, stay FAR FAR AWAY from this place. Don't order anything except maybe the soup because everything else is not worth it.

Selection of fish varies but there was enough variety to keep me happy.  Also unlimited soft shell crab which I really like.
I really was debating on if I should be writing a report or keeping it to myself as the sushi bar gets crowded.

A few months ago I would have given this place 5-Stars BUT I feel like the quality has gone down a little since. That being said, I still love this place. 

One of the few true AYCE sushi bars in Las Vegas. I mean no limits on sashimi orders. The boyfriend and I will order Yellowtail (Hamachi) Sashimi to no end and they keep delivering. They have a number of fish available as Nigiri or Sashimi. (Don't be be a chump, and fill up on rice... with nigiri. Just saying.)

They also have fresh oysters available, they do put a limit on those though. The last I checked it was a dozen per person so if you have a big enough party you'll have plenty to go around. 

Another thing I'm not thrilled with is the limited amount of rolls they offer. There's not a lot of variation to choose from but with the amount of sashimi I'm eating I typically don't care.

In short, this place is awesome. They have teppanyaki available but I've never tried it. They have a sushi bar usually with two sushi chiefs. Never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes either.",q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw,3,3,4,-5-yUo4_nkDkNLnnELeGsg

The Uni here is good and oysters are on steroids haha they're huge! Love the sauce that comes with the oysters. Sashimi is unlimited order which explains the price but well worth it!

Only things I didn't like to my preference were that the desserts: mochi, ice creams/sorbets & tempura ice cream weren't part of AYCE. You get half an orange with Palm Wine, which wasn't bad but broke my heart when I found out dessert wasn't apart of AYCE... and lastly for people that know me, I drink a lot of water, I mean A LOT and their straw was tiny haha... as in width.

Somehow, this place seems very popular with the crowd from Hawaii.  Almost every person I saw in the restaurant looked like they were from Hawaii, and the people who RAVED about the place and convinced me to go were yes, friends and coworkers in Hawaii.

You may be thinking that because it's AYCE, quality is compromised.  Well yes, you're not going to be getting the super duper fresh sushi like in Japan, but for the price, it's very good stuff (and my BF is very picky on the freshness of his sushi)!

The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was lovely. However, the only part that made me lose my appetite was that my party was of 4 but we decided to try to save a little money by avoiding gratuity and went in 2's. 15 minutes after successful orders, the orders stopped coming. We waited patiently. After waiting 25 minutes, we reminded them of our order and got a ""we're busy"". We were fine with that, but then he told us the real reason. He ""caught us"" and said ""you're not paying the tip (gratuity)? You trying to cheat me? I'm not serving you.""
Of course if they just told us in the beginning instead of making us wait and yelling at us, we would've obliged. 
The worst thing a restaurant can do is make their customers lose their appetites. 
I hope Hikari reads this as a lesson. Please don't punish your customers. If you have an issue, bring it up to them right away. We're paying anyways. If anything, put it in our bill anyways and we probably wouldn't even notice. I understand it was our fault for trying to avoid the gratuity (which is 18% for 4 or more. That's right 4 people. A freaking family with 2 parents and 2 children would have to pay so much extra). But I honestly believe it was because we were young looking. I extremely hate that stereotype. Just because we are young adults DOES NOT MEAN WE DON'T HAVE MONEY. If anything, our tip would've been more than your 18% considering the excellent service we had at the beginning of our dining experience. You just lost 4 customers and probably future customers as well.",t4of8QtZUBVC1SkGIJ0z_A,4,0,1,9GWl9lr0CdRxYesMqZSMcg

The sushi chefs are entertaining and attentive.  There's also a TV mounted on the wall, which makes someone like me (who pretty much gets bored / impatient just eating during meals) a happy clam.

I tried everything I wanted to try on the menu, and I liked everything.  The portions were a good size, the waiting time for orders was few and far between, and the seating arrangement wasn't stuffy/cramped.

When I showed my waitress here reaction was like, so what.  She inspected it first before bring in me another serving of wasabi as if I was crazy. Gross. Sashimi was cut very poorly, Some pieces were in shreds, more blood line than meat. Bone in my sashimi? My wife spit out her scallop and almost burst into tears cause she chose the spot. Everything is covered in siracha. Sushi rice was very plain and excessive. The rolls were loose. Fish quality was barely edible. The menu is small for all you can eat sushi. Which left me searching for something that was palatable. We ordered a tempura dish the waitress dropped a piece of shrimp and did'nt even bring me another piece. I was so turned off I had to bite my tongue though out the whole meal cause I was so embarrassed that I had brought my guess here. Now when you have to apologize to your company for bringing them to a poor establishment it's pretty bad. I was desperately searching for something good to say about this place but im at a loss for words. The green tea was good.

1862922,2014-04-23,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"We arrived around 7:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night, and there was no wait.  We were seated at the sushi table, but there were plenty of other tables inside.  Be aware that you are sitting at a table with other people though.  Imagine either being at a sushi table or at a teppanyaki restaurant.  Your conversations will be overheard.

We sat down and stated that we were doing AYCE ($26.99/each). Beverages and desserts are not included.  AYCE means AYCE except for fresh oysters and uni.  Everyone gets 12 fresh oysters and 4 orders of uni (2 per order).  The two of us had a TOTAL of 2 oysters and 4 orders of uni :D  I know people complain about the limit, but I think that's still a lot!  The young lady next to me ordered her uni with a raw quail egg on it, but I was too scared to try it; I was already trying uni for the first time!  And yes, I liked it.

Here's what the two of us ate:

6 orders of sashimi salmon (5 slices each order, but we got more than that after the first time) - this was yummy except for our last plate of salmon sashimi didn't taste as fatty as all the other pieces - I don't think it was because of freshness but more of which part the salmon it was
4 orders of uni (2 pieces each order)-  as mentioned earlier, this was my first time, and I enjoyed it except for the last piece that tasted slightly bitter; I wished it came without seaweed and rice though 
1 order of oysters (2 each order) - came with a spicy sauce
1 salmon skin salad - the lettuce and cucumber were very fresh; the skin was a little mushy, not crispy as I imagined
1 spicy poke - not very spicy; came with several different fish and lots of seaweed salad
1 combo sashimi (tai, tuna, Hamachi, and salmon) - this was good, but the salmon was still the best
1 dynamite (came flaming - a mix of seafood and veggies topped w/cheesy sauce that was slightly sweet while I was expecting savory) - this was addictingly yummy although the burnt broccoli was a little bitter and possible carcinogenic :D
3 orders of unagi (2 pieces an order)- unagi on rice; yummy
1 order salmon roe (2 pieces each order) - average salmon roe, can't say anything more
1 order soft shell crab
1 order tempura combo (2 each of shrimp, carrot, broccoli and 1 onion and 1 mushroom)
1 order tempura seafood  (2 each of shrimp, fish, squid)
1 order tempura shrimp (4)
1 order gyoza (3 and came with sauce) - disappointed that it was fried in oil, not pan fried/steam
1 shumai (3 and came w/creamy sauce) - this was pretty good

Ordered individually, this would have cost $200.95.  Even if the retail cost was exaggerated, if I cut that down to 50% off, it would still be at $100, so I'm going to say that I got my money's worth!  :)

We were not greeted right away by a hostess when we arrived as they were all doing something, but a bus boy managed to get someone's attention, and we were led to our table.  The sushi chef greeted us and took our order the entire night. In the beginning, it was a little difficult to get his attention when he was looking down to make food for others, but later on, he'd look up at us periodically, and we'd give our orders to him.  He even has a sense of humor.  Our water was refilled by the ladies who were serving the other tables and our food plates taken away periodically, but we never had to look for them.  When we finally admitted defeat, we asked the server for our check, which promptly came.  

This was a great deal for the price.  The service was pretty good - I don't know about everyone else in the restaurant, but the sushi chefs were Japanese.  I would return as this seems to be the only restaurant that is AYCE sashimi!",fadVhD9Y51V9pztdm4nKGg,0,1,4,CXpBx7kM5pdljLkVbaglLA

However! I still enjoyed myself and most of the dishes were alright. Fresh oysters were pretty good, a little spicy but still satisfying. Sampled a few different sushi I don't remember what kinds... but it was ok! It's what you would expect from AYCE but a tad better... it's no premium sushi, but for what you get it's not bad at all.

One thing that is special about Hikari is that you're allowed to order sashimi in AYCE, which is something I haven't seen. Typically, they feed you rice to fill you up. There was no wait when we came in for dinner, but the seating is pretty awkward. You're seated in a line with your group, but you're facing other people and you can hear their conversations.

Orders are scribbled down on a notepad instead of checking off on a sheet of paper, which I'd prefer. Some mistakes were made due to hearing. Sushi does take a while to prepare, so I understood when plates were brought out over ten minutes after ordering. Sashimi pieces are also a little bit small, so you should order more in one round of AYCE. 

Baked Mussels: Really flavorful. Highly recommend!
Takoyaki (Octopus Dumpling): Wasn't a fan of the mushy texture.
Kama: We had the yellow tail. Was really big, but honestly just cooked fish, so nothing too special.
Cajun Albacore Sushi: Passable. The spices didn't go well with raw fish.
Sweet Shrimp Sushi: The first time I had raw shrimp! These were pretty good, but really freakin' small. 
Ika Sushi: Definitely my favorite. The texture is just so chewy and there is no bad taste.
Scallop Sushi: 

I also love how rolls can come in half sizes for AYCE. I had a full order of the caterpillar roll (8 pieces). I noticed that the rice for this roll was mushy (kind of like Trader Joe's Sushi). The rice for the other nigiri and rolls were completely fine. I also had a half spider roll and definitely enjoyed the flavors and the crunchiness. 

I'm usually not a fan of $27 AYCE sushi, but I totally understand if you're allowed to order unlimited sashimi! There are some restrictions on how many items you can order for specialty items, like uni. Also, they were out of the mochi ice cream when I went",57a4rVQ2Po6csI7VxBEjGA,1,0,4,i4whUdAjrSwqkwN3lqY3Wg

But for some reason I always leave satisfied. The setup in the beginning is you could choose Sushi or Teppanyaki food. If Sushi you get to choose between AYCE or just ordering off the menu. 

The first time coming here I came with parents and they just devoured oysters, uni, shrimp tempura, and salmon sashimi. All i remember from that meal is that this place was a great deal. Now a year removed I visited on Sunday and decided to do my best to try most of the menu.

I go in and am greeted by the same hostess from last time (I remember because she was cute) and we were brought to the sushi bar for the AYCE session. Sit down with Duke C. (brought him along since i've been raving about this place to him over a year now) We order a few items off the menu and in about 10 seconds its in our face. I was in disbelief how fast the food came out (literally not 10 seconds but like 1 minute fast)

The food was great. Sashimi looks fresh and tasted great (was a little cold.. guessing was frozen but couldnt really tell because freshness was there) I dont know how to explain the fact that it is good food at a great price. Where else can you get sashimi at an AYCE place? The sushi chef was helpful/friendly and was always checking up on us. We always had food at our table, in the end i threw in the towel way early because I knew I still had to drive home that night. Will not hesistate to go again (which most likely will be this weekend :) )

Just check the pictures for those in doubt. I give this place a 4.5 stars because I can see where people would not want to give it a 5, but this place is making a very very strong run for 5 stars. Good service and Great food, with awesome atmosphere. (Girls dont forget their Hot Girl Special after 10pm lol)",XLdDJ2LlpR6Ak_gYdkeIXg,2,0,4,xCtg-5UZAiAPN3pwJ6BH4A

When you think of all you can eat sushi places, you don't really think to highly of them because how are they going to make money serving high quality fish for cheap prices. Well for $28, you can eat all the sushi you want. And it's not only the spicy tuna, sashimi, and other cheap things you see at other fast food sushi places. 

You can order different rolls as well. Well we went around dinner time on a weekday and it wasn't too packed. We didn't have to wait as all. It's a pretty good size restaurant. There's plenty of parking everything and you shouldn't have a hard time to find parking. They're hours are from 5p to 2a seven days a week. 

I mean for the money the fish was ok. It wasn't really anything to die for but we did have to wait a bit to get what we ordered and she forgot to bring something we ordered as well. It was her first time and as a trainee I would have hoped that someone could have been watching over her. By all means, she wasn't horrible but I wouldn't say she was great either.

We opted to wait 20 minutes for the tables. The service was incredibly fast and the sashimi was okay. We tried the takoyaki and the tempura and they were obviously pre-made before frying. You can tell that they specialized in more of the cooked aspect versus the sushi/sashimi.

Okay the food.  It was okay.  Appetizers should come before the rest of the meal.  I ordered scallops appetizer with the filet and shrimp.  My granddaughter ordered the ny steak and chicken.  The soup you have a choice of miso or onion. We tried both.  The onion was fair.  My granddaughter asked the waitress which was better and on recommendation tried miso.  They never asked if it was okay.  In fact we were never asked during the meal. Poor.  The salad was very hard to eat.  Many lettuce rib very little dressing.  The fried rice was decent but the vegetables were over cook.  He placed the rice on the plate upside down.  I did not like that at all. My scallops were coated in some (never had that before).  It made them brown quicker I guess but the texture was off and the crust did not stay on.  The shrimp appetizer (included) came with my shrimp.  Not a very nice progression.

2149322,2013-01-09,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"I really wanted to LOVE this place and did find it be ok, but it definitely didn't come off as a 4 or 5 star experience. I live in Henderson, so this place is a bit of a drive, but I thought I would try it out since it had the AYCE sashimi option. Yes, there are several things that you can get as sashimi, but they are mostly pretty pedestrian. The tobiko and uni are definitely not offered. Sad! 

So when I wanted in it took several minutes for them to finally seat me. I suppose I could have just sat myself, but that's rude so I waited. I got to order  my drink but the server never came back to answer any questions or see if I needed anything. I agree with people who say the service is pretty lacking. Grant it they expect people to order from the sushi chef, but I was drinking and had to flag people down to get more saki. Not good. 

Everything on the menu is on the all-you-can-eat except desert, which is a definite plus. It's only $26.95, which really, I could easily eat in sashimi and did. The selection is pretty lacking, but again, I what can one expect? The rolls were basically just California roll or some variation. I've grown tired of thinking fake crab meat combinations are ""sushi."" They're kinda crap. Then you get all these sauces, which just adds up to more fattening crap. There wasn't anything THAT exciting or much variety. Oh well, I was kinda in the mood for eel but I did have an eel roll and the rice was good. 

Luckily they had not only Hamachi Kama but Salmon Kama so that was a nice little surprise. I was also able to get a pretty yummy poki version that I would totally eat again. All in all I walked away full and enjoyed what I had. I didn't feel like the service was that great but really the place is just an assembly line. If you want to get cheap all you can eat sushi with some sashimi thrown in then this place isn't that bad.

Key word being most- they forgot several of our orders for well over a half hour and brought out the wrong beer for one person- we got a comped beer but still not a promising start. The tuna was a bit too grey. The yellowtail nigiri was described as ""crispy"" by one of our companions, who also claimed to have gotten a bone in his bite. The rolls were stuffed to the gills with imitation crab and a few of the fish pieces were picked off due to their unpalateable look. We've eaten at a lot of sushi places, and I was stoked when I heard people actually speaking Japanese! Plus the scallop sashimi, unlimited uni and oysters was a huge selling point for me, which was the main reason I harassed my party of four into going. While it's nice that these items are offered, the overall impact left a lot to be desired. We tried the salmon- which was OK, the highlight of the sashimi. I got scallops- a bit dull and chewy, oysters- which were fresh-ish but not fabulous, shared the ""Skreem inor gazim"" which was one of the better moments, a bit of soft shell crab [soooo much better at Bluefin!], a few mediocre pieces of yellowtail and tuna... one of our companions opted out of eating anything, the other barely picked at their food. I had high expectations and really wanted to like this place- I mean, AYCE sashimi?! OMG, that'd be AWESOME if the fish were more appetizing. I'll stick with Bluefin, the fish tastes a whole lot fresher and I like their in-house specials [cajun albacore, special rolls, appetizers, etc] a lot more, plus the lower price.

heres the catch, they are very high volume and appear to be made to order and keep up pretty well with the demand i thought.  But from my seat i could see all the behind the scenes action.. Oysters are all shucked and arranged in plates by the dozen.  most of the sushi is made to order.  The rice for the Uni is pre formed, stacked up and kept under plastic, when you order they just wrap the nori around and put the uni on top..  the Unagi is already cooked they just put it on top the rice and give it to you.  There is also a high volume of fried items ordered such as the softshell crab, so many times they cook a little extra to keep ahead of demand..  Hamachi Kama is pre broiled and just popped in the microwave when you order it..

with this being said i think they do a pretty good job keeping up with the very high volume and turning out good food.. it's not going to be the freshest of the fresh but for the price you are paying its a steal really and the oysters are really good and they are used to people ordering them by the dozen.  they are friendly and they don't make you feel like ""you big boy, you eat to much, you been here 4 hours! you go home now!"" like many all you can eat places. 

I'm always skeptical about eating oysters, esp and AYCE places so, first off i say ""1 oyster each (2 pieces)"" he says ""1 dozen?"" i say, ""no just 1 each"" we both laugh, he says, ""customers usually order them by the dozen"" after my first taste, i said 1 dozen please!

Pros: GREAT VALUE!! Highly recommend the oysters, almost ate a dozen by myself (i think most people do and then some) and what's best is they don't mind.  friendly staff, fast service.  This might be one of my must visit stops in Vegas.

Cons: some items can sometimes be cooked or made ahead of time, but a small price to pay for speedy service in such a high volume place.  

Advice: Get there within 45 minutes of opening.. it was almost empty when i got there on a Saturday, by the time we left, it was packed!",0DnQxBz82tU--KsevUFCTw,4,3,4,yQYF_KaRmlnOp-OaMDEeTQ

I said BS no such thing we just go Sushi Koma, one of our usual sushi spots when celebrating something. Well we eventually made it to Hikari after stopping at Sushi Koma and yea we all forgot our names LOL.

WTF! I'm sorry but why have I not heard of Hikari before? I love sushi but why am I wasting my valuable stomach space on rice when I can just eat AYCE SASHIMI instead!? You heard that right ALL YOU CAN EAT SASHIMI. You don't have to order nigiri, eat the fish, and hid the rice under the table or in your napkin.

Here's the scoop. It's AYCE sushi that's open only for dinner and late nights (5 PM -2 AM) for $26.95 and if your a ""good looking lady"" you can save a couple dollars after 11 PM. Desserts aren't included in AYCE, that's fine with me I don't care for dessert after doing AYCE sushi unless their dessert is better than their sushi. AYCE sushi includes AYCE sashimi on most of their nigiri items. AYCE has a limit of 1 dozen oysters and 4 orders of uni per person, have those that don't like oysters and uni order them and you eat them. There's a 18% gratuity on parties of 4 or more, gladly pay for it service and food was worth more.

From the average 3.5 star ratings I would have thought that Hikari would be just decent sushi but nope. Everything was excellent the quality, the quantity, and the taste.

I have to eat Salmon Skin Handrolls at all sushi spots, I blame Blue Fin LOL

I/we also ordered plates and plates of sashimi.  Here's a few plates of some Garlic Tuna, Hamachi, and Salmon Sashimi. Tell me you don't just wanna eat some of that. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw Here's an up close on the Hamachi. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#XcRySQzXB1MppLpBwTRe0Q and from the back http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#qA5cCBvGJzqrH8ibjEqqtg The quality was there, my mouth is watering. 

We ordered the oyster too http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#rRHD1ConhBDM6q0xC2ShCw They came in ""Japanese Style"" spicy sauce with green onions. So delicious to bad you can only order a dozen. They were clean and without all that sand and junk that I always see when I get oysters and they were not too small and not too large in size.

I also did some nigiri.  Here's some Smoked Salmon and Garlic Tuna Nigiri http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#tMwX9pumx2nIY6RcMNDE1w and some Uni and Tamago Nigiri http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hikari-las-vegas?select=_P6m1rAyd8oh4l3-_MPVZw#pp6kMNdjGZjMaivt2GqMEw All perfect and I didn't even have to use a high quality camera or photoshop. We had more like Kama (Grilled Yellow Tail Collar), multiple orders of Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab, ""poki"" spicy sashimi salad, shrimp tempura, Agedashi Tofu (Fried Tofu), soups, rolls, edamame, potstickers, dumplings, mussels, etc. We basically had their whole menu but I don't wanna look at anymore pictures because I'm getting hungry.

Not needing to eat rice with our seafood made a huge difference, I don't think I even felt that full and I don't think there was even a time limit. We were there for hours and we kept asking each other ""they not kicking us out yet. order more!!"" LOL. There's a lot of days to celebrate during the next few months, more stops at Hikari are coming in my near future. This is as of now, November 10, 2013 at 5:10 PM my new favorite sushi spot.

As for the food, the food was good, sushi was good for ayce, fresh and hearty, until I started to order more, fish was cut thinner and one less ebi. But for ayce I guess that's how you gotta stay in business. They only had one order of uni left, maybe cause we came late. There cooked steak was good, unfortunately it wasn't cooked in front of my daughter.
Reason for only 4 stars is because customer service was slow, had to flag other people other than our waitress to order, had to ask for drink refills, maybe we just had a bad waitress, but then again someone could've stepped up.",h_54MH1gx1dXqc6A30e50A,0,0,4,GKQ6kfmEOumvT31R0Vei3Q

I was skeptical at first about the place (since I've had pretty good sushi throughout LA and SD.)  We sat down for the all-you-can-eat sushi bar and the head sushi chef handed us our first plate: a dozen raw oysters flavored wth ponzu sauce, sarachi, and green onions.  It was THE most delicious and freshest raw oyster I have ever had.  We then ordered the white tuna, salmon, hamachi, the hikari special (Cali roll topped with white tuna, sarachi, and tempura flakes.). Once again I was amazed on how tender and soft fishes were. This has got to be the freshest fish I've had...ever!  If you are in Vegas and crave for a sushi bar off the strip, I totally recommend this place to you. The service is outstanding and the sushi chefs are fast! We made 3 orders at a time and when we began to browse the menu for other items, they were already finished with our previous order!!!

2358412,2010-06-11,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"I was very excited to try the only Sushi restaurant that has all you can eat Sashimi and went into Hikari SOLO!

It is Japanese owned. Sushi bar is small and staff if friendly. The AYCE menu is small, but it had most of my favorites so I was pleased to be there.

My first order was:
Hamachi & White Tuna Sashimi - The serve you with a lot of it and sliced very thick. The White Tuna was served with a hint of garlic sauce and jalapenos. Although I wasn't too fond of the thickness, it was still tasty.

Salmon Skin Hand Roll - This was good and it wasn't too much rice.

2nd Order: 
Tai - Red Snapper Sashimi - I requested for it to be sliced thin this time and it was good. I also ordered another round of Hamachi & White Tuna thin sliced and sushi chef was more than happy to accommodate my request. 

Agadeshi Tofu - It was good, but it had too much sauce.

Surf Clam Sashimi - It wasn't bad, but I had better that was more tasty.

3rd Order: 
Nigiri Uni, Sea Urchin - It was definitely a lot of rice and Uni was okay, it lacked flavor or maybe freshness? 

Seafood Tempura - There was so much of it! 3 pieces each of Shrimp, Squid & White Fish.  It was good and I have no complaints. This was the one that left me full and I was hesitant to keep ordering more items.

Ikura Nigiri - Again, too much rice. 

Amaebi, Sweet Shrimp -  shrimp was so small and definitely had a lot of rice which overpowered the fresh taste of the shrimp.

Fresh Oysters - This was good.

Last order: 
Edamame - Very poor. It has been sitting there and it was served cold which was also stale. I prefer my edamame served hot with salt.

Hikari charges AYCE for $26.95 and my total bill was $34 including tip.

I gave a good tip for the service because the chef was really nice to me and enjoyed our conversation about my travels to Japan. 

Even though my excitement slowly diminished as my time spent in Hikari kept on passing me by, I am open to come back for AYCE Sashimi as long as they keep serving me with the thin sliced fish. Perhaps next time I can bring some company with me, so we can share the the large portion of Sashimi!",Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q,2,2,3,evCZxnjPsP3NeDp0Abmh3g

Both of which had lots of flavor.  Outside parking area is good, establishment was clean and so was the restroom.  The only thing that maybe could be improved is that the dessert (which was mochi ice cream) should be included in the dinner price and not sold separately.

The discount for ""sexy ladies"" after 10 is only for $4 off but I guess it's better than nothing. One guy in our group even considered donning a dress for the discount. =p I don't like stuffing myself so late at night, but when in Rome... ugh barfatorium j/k.  Sin City Hikari knows how to satisfy the sushi gluttons.

This place gets 4 stars only because of the slow speed that dishes were coming out. The server was very nice and tried her best to help us out by loading our orders up. Maybe it would have helped if we sat at the bar? Our party had seven people not sure if we could have relocated halfway through. 

When we got there around 12 am there were three other groups present. By the time we left we were the last ones and they were doing last call for our group, I think everyone was tired chef included at the rate our orders were coming out. =(

The extensive menu had a lot of items included in the AYCE that I did not see elsewhere. The uni was worth it, I think our group had about 20 orders of that alone! O_O At all the other sushi places I have visited uni is separate form the AYCE menu. I stayed away from the soft shell crab due to allergies, but our group seemed to love that. The mussels were also a hit, great savory flavor and wasn't totally slathered in mayo. 

The sushi was average quality and okay freshness, I also noticed that the second round of uni ordered was not as fresh as the first. =( The texture of some of the cuts of fish was odd, they way it was thawed or frozen messed with it. It wasn't like this for all the fish, but enough to make a mention of it here. 

I don't know if its the sauce or seasoning on the rolls. I felt really thirsty and was guzzling down water. I didn't use much soy sauce and even used the low sodium one, but it's one thing that could be changed. My group and I couldn't finish the miso and onion soup due to saltiness. I tried watering it down to an acceptable level with the water I was provided and found that I had to put practically an equal portion of water to make it palatable. Our group suspects that it's just been reducing to it's salty level, but perhaps a more cynical explanation. Get customers to fill up on water and save on $$$?  o_0

Our group got it's money's worth in sushi from this place. Be prepared to not just test the limit of your belly but patience too.",wLh4YepDaBzQ1JMrj5fDzQ,0,0,4,1EA8odUQR571YK-nquUNiQ

The uni (sea urchin) is now limited to 4 orders (8 pcs) and there is a limit to how many oysters you can order as well.  Either way,  the ""limits"" on these items are definitely within reason.

Hikari's fish quality had a slight fishy aftertaste that coated my taste buds and wouldn't let go. Also, I just couldn't get past the irregular, sloppy, square cuts, with browning sides, on the sashimi. It all lacked the sweetness and moistness that I came to love in fresh quality fish.

I have come to the realization that I am a hard core snob when it comes to the freshness of my seafood. It needs to meet these criteria in order for me to be happy: fresh, sweet, buttery, and tender. After I sampled the disappointing sushi rolls, nigiri loaded with dense rice, fishy oysters, fishy sashimi, far from fresh uni, and weird tiny ama ebi that wasn't sweet at all, I stuck to the (cooked) dishes that were safe on my stomach and didn't offend my taste buds.

My favorites of the night:
- Miso soup - I had 5 consecutive bowls! The miso was piping hot and perfect. (Might also be because I was hungry and the fish was questionable).
- Fried soft shell crab - squirt some lemon on it and dip it in ponzu! I loved the light batter and the crispiness of these. 
- Baked mussels - they weren't plump or juicy as other places would make them, but they did the job. 
- Dynamite - Great flavor but made 99% of vegetables and about 4 tiny pieces of scallop. Flavor was there though! 
- Some of the poke salad - half of it tasted refreshing and well seasoned with the seaweed and cucumbers, but there were also some bad cuts of fish thrown in the mix :/

For $27 AYCE, I really felt that I was extremely limited on what I could order. All you can eat sashimi was a lie. It's way too dry and fishy to be considered sashimi (in my books). Also, they seriously packed the dense rice bricks underneath each nigiri and no dessert!? :(

I ate like a little birdy here (highly unlike me). I suppose it's kind of ideal to eat at a not so stellar place from time to time - It forces me eat a normal portion of food and not try to stuff myself to the brim. (Trust me, I would of kept the food coming if it was delicious!) So in the end, I suppose my belly wins.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,14,10,2,m3JfUYAk7GOYbIOCgTOK2g
2615162,2010-11-18,5,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"A Family outing... a rare occasion I would say, but my brother pulled another ""rather spend time with some hoochie than Family."" Don't want to get into details, but we were fed up from waiting for him to go eat and told him to just forget it. Sometimes I wish he would care more about his Family than some random girl that he barely even knows. Makes me really sad that he treats us like this.. sorry guys.. I know this is a review.

So I took my parents to Hikari for AYCE. They LOVE Sashimi... I love fried food.. I know it's bad, but I like it so.. Here's what I ordered:

Seaweed Salad (2x) - the first one was light, tasty, and fresh.. second time around it was way too salty and overly sauced.

Cucumber Salad - half moon size cuts, crisp juicy crunch... it was... ok.

Salmon Skin Salad - Drowned in real tangy, vinegar dressing... made my tongue numb! There were bits of salmon meat Not skin that were hard as a rock, almost like bones... be careful in eating this... you can chip off your tooth if you're not watching your bite. However, there were pieces of Salmon Skin that were a light bite like potato chips... that was only a few.

Fresh Oysters - My Mother loved this and ate about 8 of them!!! And even had one more for dessert! Yikes! I had one but that sucker was huge and I had to really break it down to swallow it. I prefer those thin slimy kinds you just slide in your mouth and swallow... this was like WTHeck thick. My Parents loved it... me on the other hand passed on ordering more.

Tempura Combo - I had the whole thing.... the shrimp was ok... carrot, zucchini, onion, mushroom.. were nothing spectacular. The crunchy coating didn't have any flavor to it... disappointed.

Baked Green Mussel - they cut the mussel in half, so you don't eat the whole piece... it was watery, mayonnaise was so sour, and it just tasted off.

Dynamite - Again mayonnaise was too tangy and too much. I couldn't taste anything, but the sourness. The bites of seafood were hard to chew like leather... not edible and had to take it out of my mouth a few times. Don't order it.

Kama - My Father ate the whole thing... said it was tender and flavorful.

Fried Rice (Shrimp) - I finished the whole dish. It was very delicious and almost ordered a second round, but wanted to try other dishes. Good choice if you like fried rice.

Hamachi (Yellow Tail) - My Mother enjoyed this very much and ordered it again.

Hotate (Scallop) - Very fresh and a beautiful white coloring... gleaming with perfection. It was satisfying and good!!! Probably the only thing I liked besides the fried rice at this place.

Ama Ebi ( Shrimp) - we all ate a few... it was cute and yummy.

Tuna Roll - Had no flavor, looked bad.. almost like a grayish color. My Mother only had one and said it was terrible. Shoot, it looked terrible. Had to hide the other five under another dish. Don't order it... you'll thank me.

Caterpillar Roll - Nice presentation, but didn't really ""taste"" the roll. Didn't work for me.

Miso Soup - it was soothing and steamy hot. Good start to this meal.

Ended with Green Tea and Red Bean Mochi for dessert ($2), which isn't included in the AYCE deal ($27) The dessert was good... I liked the green tea more since it tasted fresh versus the red bean that tasted and looked kinda old.

The iced green tea was refreshing and the servers were very attentive in clearing our plates when we were done. The Sushi Chefs were all busy with requests and orders, but asked us from time to time if we were okay or wanted anything else. One chef with glasses seem to have a real cocky attitude, but maybe coz my face was all scabbed up and he didn't want to be nice to me... whatever. Other than that, I would say it's a ""decent"" place for AYCE but it will be one of those this dish was good and that dish was bad. It's not really consistent in having all their food being delicious and well cooked. Would I go here again?!?! Only if I have to.",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,8,7,3,eK370RqZyiaOCpeSqeO_OQ

They took forever with our miso soup which should probably be one of the easiest appetizers to bring out. It was the last thing to come out.

The way they take our order is disorganized and frustrating.  Other ayce places use a paper where the customers can write down the quantity and turn it in.  It helps keep track of what did not come out yet.  They write orders down on scrap pieces of paper.

2634661,2014-04-24,1,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Having lived in Vegas for over a decade now, I have gotten used to an AYCE sushi spot on every corner. Some have time limits, most require you to consume all rice, and none that I'm aware of besides Hikari allows you to order SASHIMI on the AYCE menu with few to no restrictions. In my 10 years in Las Vegas, I have probably visited in excess of 30 sushi bars, and though we probably drive by at least 15-20 sushi places on the way to Hikari, we make the 16 mile trek across town about once a month because the quality, variety, options, and atmosphere simply cannot be beat. 

The vast majority of the time, the wife and I dine at the sushi bar. They also offer a teppenyaki side for the full Benihana experience, but the sushi bar is truly where it's at. The sushi chefs are quick and can handle a full bar with ease. Don't be shy, just start ordering as soon as you take your seat. 

They are open exclusively for dinner, from
5pm until 2 or 3am I believe. After 11pm, ""Good looking ladies"" get a couple of bucks off the AYCE price ($26.95 last I checked). 

The only restrictions are when it comes to multiple orders of raw oysters in the half she'll and Uni (sea urchin). Sea urchin is limited to 2 orders (4 pieces) per person and I believe it's 1 dozen oysters per person. No restrictions on time or eating the rice (which is really a moot point since you can order most fish sashimi style, including salmon, tuna, albacore, etc. Though desserts are not included on the AYCE menu, appetizers are included and enable you to order things like shrimp tempura, fried tofu, ahi poke, and salmon skin salad to your hearts content. The speciality roll menu is a little small compared to other AYCE places, but like I said, the fresh quality of the fish and the ability to get sashimi more than makes up for it. Plus, you can order custom designed rolls if you choose (just perhaps be mindful of the extra effort required and consider leaving an extra cash tip to the sushi bar chefs).

Overall, Hikari is a phenomenal value and what we consider to be the be all end all of AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. It's worth a cab ride if you're a tourist and if you're a local, get down there ASAP. You won't be disappointed.

Waited about another hour and still didn't get anything. I finally walked up to the sushi bar and asked them how long is everything going to take because we've been waiting for over two hours and they just said they'll process it now.... so what the hell were they doing the last two hours ? wouldn't you make the orders right when you get it ? 
Our server ended up working on the other side of the restaurant and didn't check on us for an hour. 
The manager or whatever did come to check on us twice to take our orders, so we put it a third round, 
and still didn't get it for another 20 minutes.
Then he comes back and asks again if we want to order anything else......
Like what about what we just ordered ???
we still didn't get anything.
We put in uni orders twice and only got it after the second time we asked. 

Just wanted to be in and out of the restaurant get our AYCE and be done. Instead we ended up spending 3 hours here waiting for our first half of the round, second round, third round, and fourth rounds

That's the good part, the bad part, it's in friggin' Las Vegas!! 

Prior to my visit here, Midori (through out the Valley) was my choice for all-you-can-eat sushi. I can't even look at Midori the same anymore. It's not that I ""cheated"" per say, it's just that, Hikari is a better, um, lover? :x

Now, my review is solely for the Sushi Bar, I didn't try the ""Steakhouse"" portion, and no offense, I don't think I ever will. Once you're whisked into the area of the Sushi bar, you better be prepared, not only with stuffing your face silly, but with how LIGHTNING FAST the order gets to you. It's no joke, almost as soon as you order, within minutes (sometimes it's right there), your order is fulfilled. They even almost ""egg"" you on by asking you what else you would like (not rudely, mind you). 

We ordered so many things, I can't even remember what specifically we got. I do remembering ordering the raw oysters (yes, all you can eat) and they were good for what they were. Were they the highest grade? No, but they didn't suck either. We ended up ordering at least 3 dozen. I also loved their soft shelled crab. I ordered this like 3 times, with a little lemon, the crunch and the tartness made it seem like there was a party in my mouth. I also loved the super white tuna sashimi and the seared white fish. The thing that separates this from a lot of AYCE places, the raw oysters and sashimi that is available on the menu (compared to a lot of places where you can't even think about having sashimi).

The staff (waiters/waitress'/sushi chefs) were A LOT of fun and had a really upbeat atmosphere. I also loved the sign for ""Good Looking Ladies"" getting a discount from 11PM-2AM. 

I can honestly say, it's some of the freshest fish I've ever had and can't wait to go back.

I mean, he literally had to be rude enough to say ""This is your last order, ok?""  I mean, I didn't know, all right?  It was the smallest print on the very bottom of the menu.  If you want customers to know, advertise it large enough so that before I placed AYCE order, I know my limitations, and I can leave without being baited by your trick.  Ok, then, I noticed the oysters also have the limit that per person, they allow you to have 12 oysters each.  We have party of two, so we should be allowed 24 oysters.  The first order -4 pieces.  The second order 6 pieces.  Then, third order, 6 pieces.  So, do the math, we still have 8 pieces to go.  Then, come the time we were ordering the last 8 pieces, the chef who has been neglecting us the whole time (he was so busy watching the baseball games on TV and attended to some Caucasian customers), shouted, ""I think you only have 6 pieces left.""  Then, he went ahead and gave the 6 pieces to us.  WTF.  If you don't want people to order things from your menu, don't offer them.  Disclose this and lock your food up in the closet.  Then, I can easily walk away to get something else that's far better than what you have.   Two chef, throughout the time NEVER EVER asked us what we would like.  We had to call them a few times to catch their attention.  The guy who looked Filipino was especially rude and lacking the chef skill.  Apparently, he is a new chef and perhaps that's why he couldn't even give us any sashimi dishes that weren't messed up.  The just wasn't cut right and all the pieces were still connected when he served sashimi to us.  One plate, he was about to give to me, he pulled it back from my hand and yelled, ""I forgot the sauce.""  Who cares if there is no sauce?  Just give to me the sauce.  You don't give the customers the plates and then pulled them back from customers' hands, ok?  On top of countless rude behavior they had, after I left, I had food poison from the sushi the whole night and couldn't help thinking, ""Thank goodness that they limit the amount you can order of oyster and uni"", or, the poison would be even more serious....What a nightmare.

First off, the sushi rice kept falling apart, good sushi is not suppose to fall apart. The eel sauce was too watery, it should be thicker, thus the crumbling sushi pieces. The food was was not all that great, the yakisoba was too watery, the agedashi tofu had no flavor at all. There were not that many rolls to choose from and the majority of them were just the same but an extra different topping. The fish quality..didnt seem so great. And the worst part of it all, the baked green mussels! It was fairly dry and not as awesome as the ones I have tasted before. All in all....just disappointed.

As far as service goes, It was quite horrible. They were very unorganized, we sat at the bar and as we ordered, we kept having to remind them, if not, the order would not come. I had to order a few items more than once because they would just keep forgetting. Total disappointment

2971933,2009-02-16,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"I'm pretty divided on this place. First the good: the nigiri rolls are unbelievable. This is easily the freshest, best quality fish I've ever tasted on top of a little slab of rice. The super white tuna and seared albacore are unbelievable - flavorful and tender. The individual prices per roll are pretty high but if you get the all you can eat sushi deal for $26, you can easily stuff your face with 80 bucks worth of fish and rice. About 15-18 rolls later I couldn't move anymoe but my immobility was a happy one. We even ventured into the no-man uni territory and it was quite doable.

The not super awesome thing about this restaurant: the non nigiri rolls. They're not all that excellent or even distinct enough to make you want to come specifically to Hikari, which is a bit out of the way from the strip. With a pretty short menu you're left ordering the same boring ""house special"" rolls you can get anywhere else and they're not worth the effort imo.  The deep fried rolls are in fact my least favorite ones, mostly b/c they're very very heavily fried. My sister's family really likes them but I found them to be toooo fried. 

All that aside, the nigiri is worth the drive from anywhere and if you'e got time to kill then take the drive from CA and stop by. The chefs are cool and the general feel is very authentic. If the menu had nothing but nigiri I would gladly rate this a 5 star...a longer menu would be nice too but thats just getting picky.",HwmTzORmEfa9HgSfmA0RQw,1,1,4,w--riMY95r6ciZ-UZ6ijNQ

Almost all the sushi AYCE places do not serve sashimi items along. If you would like to taste the raw fish, you have to order nigiri and finish the rice too. I thought it's pretty standard for AYCE stores, until I came here.

They let you order sashimi combos, for any fish you would like to taste, any numbers of orders you can finish! And their sashimi is not just salmon and tuna, they also have hamachi! I seriously love their sashimi, it tastes so fresh and great. Also for Amaebi (sweet shrimp), if you'd like it, they will give you a generous portion with lots of shrimps, and just shrimps. Oh did I mention that they don't limit the number of uni you ordered either?

I did not eat too many rolls but I remember their tiger roll was also very amazing. Spicy tuna on the top with crunchy tempura shrimp in the middle makes the texture so wonderful. 

One thing that does impress me is the ""dynamite"" from its appetizer menu. When it's served it has a flame over your food and makes people ""wow"" for a second. It is more like a baked roll with imitation crab and some yum yum sauce, but I would think it may be a little bit salty for some people. 

It's a pity that I can't find the grill fish collar from its AYCE menu. Besides sweets like mochi and ice cream was not included in AYCE menu either. Other than that I would say Hikari is one of the best sushi AYCE I have ever been.",CGMCxt6EnKcuvxql4uSTMg,2,1,4,_41LotgqmeYzUUGHt9Gz3A

Many reviewers pointed out that this AYCE joint offers sashimi in addition to just nigiri or rolls. Well if you want the junk parts of the fish butchered by a 5-year old then by all means, go for it. I'm not exaggerating...the mixed sashimi plate consisted of various fish ends with holes in them. I could not believe that someone would expect me to eat that. And unfortunately everything else was just as gross. Even the rolls were off-putting. Mushy sushi rice and Sriracha sauce everywhere. The only edible item was the agedashi tofu from the kitchen, which is mostly what we ended up eating to cleanse our palates.

It's simply amazing. For $27, it's an AYCE experience that will not blow your mind, but your ego after gorging down 14 soft shell crabs in one go. I wouldn't suggest the steakhouse, but simply you get so much more with the AYCE. And besides, the dishes are too good to pass up.

Always get the Agedashi Tofu, even when you don't want it. Just get it. You're gonna eat it regardless. I just know it. It's that good. Soft Shell Crab is the king over there. As a side dish, I pretty much ate it like a main entree. Even the chef was a bit amazed at the amount we ate. Sushi rolls are pretty much to your ideals, since you can always customize it the way you want it. Get as much uni as you want. And throw in that unlimited handrolls with salmon skin. YES. 

And the cool part? The chefs just scream your orders when you order it in front of them. ""Oh, you want Hamachi? Okay, HAMACHI PLEASEEE NOWWWW."" Never had I felt so in command of my orders at a place .

Service....food came exceptionally fast and prompt even though a couple of our orders were forgotten and we had to  reorder with the waitress again. But I like that our food came FAST and I was able to eat within  5 minutes of ordering the first appetizer.

Added Bonus.for the late diners ...It says on the menu..11pm after $22.00 for sexy and pretty ladies...

MINUS

No table seating..they sat us around the Teppanyaki table
Kids are charged the SAME price as adults..no matter what age..wtf??
For a party of 4 adults and a sleeping kid they automatically added the gratuity....so for a hundred something dollar bill, they got a pretty good tip.
How awful I felt afterwards for eating SOOOO much. I tried to ""walk it off"" but it was useless. I felt pregnant with a food baby.
(this place is located about 5 miles off the strip on Flamingo and Buffalo Dr...this wasn't a minus cause the drive wasn't really that far)

OVERALL... I 'll be back because it was probably the best all you can eat sushi I've eaten.  I will just do my damndest not to get prego with that food baby again...ugh",Fnui7MKy1Xz7op5fvnOPLQ,1,1,4,P1L9X7vMiffSfHwf4tmgWg

Saturday night in Vegas we were trying to decide whether to go to a buffet or have all-you-can-eat sushi.  I'm sure the buffet would have been good too, but I'm glad we decided on the sushi.  Hikari is actually a Japanese steak house and sushi bar, so you can either sit at a table and have steak, seafood, etc or sit at the sushi bar for some great AYCE sushi, sashimi, rolls and appetizers.  

I'm a big fan of Midori in LA, but I have to say Hikari was better.  What I like more about Hikari is that they have some key things on their AYCE menu that Midori doesn't, namely sashimi.  You have your choice of nigiri or sashimi with the different types of sushi they offer.  I'm not a big fan of raw oysters on the half-shell, but they also offer that as part of the AYCE, which I know isn't normally cheap.  I don't remember everything I had here, but what I can remember includes shrimp tempura, miso soup, edamame, fried scallops (they call the ""Frallops""), soft shell crab, a plate of mixed sashimi, tuna, yellowtail, super white tuna, salmon and shrimp nigiri.  I know there was more, but the dishes were coming so fast and furious I couldn't keep up.  My favorites were the crab, scallops and the super white tuna sashimi.  They put some spicy garlic jalapeno sauce on it which added a nice kick.  We also ended up getting some red bean, green tea, mango and strawberry mochi ice cream for dessert (which wasn't part of the AYCE so we had to pay extra for it).  

Overall everything was very good quality and very tasty.  I see some complaints about the service in other reviews, but I thought it was excellent.  We sat at the sushi bar so the chefs were right there, but they were super quick and attentive not only with the sushi that they made right there at the bar, but the cooks in the back that were making the appetizers and cooked dishes were putting them out in record time as well.  I don't think we waited more than 2 or 3 minutes for anything we ordered.  The sushi chefs had great attitudes and were very friendly.  

Note, they are open until 2am and from 11pm-2am they have the ""good looking ladies"" special where good looking ladies can eat AYCE for $22.50 instead of the normal price of $26.95.  Not sure who judges whether the ladies are good looking or not, but my guess is as long as you are a lady you'll get the special.  Drag queens of Vegas, sorry but you're probably out of luck.",ZBDh6XD98hTp9_w0mLgCVw,6,5,5,ToohjJq88kKknJWtW8t-Tg

The older sushi chef must not appreciate the restaurant being busy because sat down at our usual section and I simply asked if he had any hamachi belly and immediately snapped at me saying NO in a really loud voice. I then asked if he cud check at the other chef's section and he started throwing things and making loud noises as if to scare me. We got the sashimi he prepared for my wife and I but we had no condiments(wasabi & ginger) so my wife asked for the condiments and he yells at my wife in a loud tone; ""Don't yell at me"". By this time I wanted to give him a piece of my mind then leave but my wife decided that we just move away from him and into the teppanyaki section so we wouldn't have to see him. We did, but I did not care to eat more than I wanted to and just wanted to get the hell out of there.

We actually found the service to be really good.  However, the layout of the restaurant is weird.  Apparently it used to be a teppan steakhouse so all the seats are set around teppan griddles in a U shape, which doesn't lend itself to conversation in a small group.  For most of our meal, we're looking at the folks eating at the U shaped table directly across from us.  Kinda awkward.

Note that they include 18% grat on parties of 4 or more.  I've seen a lot of 6 or 8...but auto grat on a party of 4?

I should've known we were in trouble from the beginning.  Our server recommended starting with a dozen fresh oysters.  Wow...fresh oysters at an AYCE joint?  We asked which type of oysters as Kumamotos are our favorites & this being a Japanese restaurant we thought perhaps this is what they served.  He had a blank look on his face & answered ""uhh..just order it and you'll see.""  They came quickly and were huge.  Really huge and flavorless.  Two-bite oysters are obscene & gross...especially when they have no flavor. 

I prefer Japanese owned sushi joints bcuz the rice is real sushi rice...the nigiri & sashimi are cut with the precision that has been taught for 1000's of years.  Their sashimi came in odd shapes...cubed, rectangular, trapezoidal.  The sushi at times was inedible.  Some cut with the grain...some against the grain.  Uni was a shade of dark brown.  Shrimp temp was gummy...probably frozen tempura.  The tofu salad was made with Chinese tofu...not the soft Japanese tofu.

I can see why people go here; however yelpers rating this restaurant 5 stars are rating with their wallets.  Even my mom said she'd never come back.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,0,0,2,m_7tZbYOjuzwvlC-Vvsk5Q

3294722,2013-08-23,2,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"I was really excited to try this place when my friend told me we were going somewhere that the AYCE included sashimi.... I was skeptical that it seemed too good to be true and I should have trusted my gut, but the prospect of endless sashimi won over and off we went.

First thing, there were only 4 of us, and they asked if we wanted to sit at the sushi bar or a table, and we opted for a table so it would be easier for us to share the AYCE family style. They walked us over to a teppanyaki table and sat us down directly next to a couple who were already squeezed into the corner. I must have drawn the short straw, because I ended up basically rubbing elbows with the woman. 

They sensed the discomfort, too, and ended up telling the server they were leaving (they hadn't ordered anything yet) and left $1 on the table for the tea. This was the second time I should've taken the hint, but we persisted.

Then we ordered. There are some items that can't be ordered as sashimi, but we got pretty much everything else sashimi style. There is a limit on the number of oysters and orders of Uni that can be ordered per person, so we initially said bring us the maximum # of uni. I had never tried it before and I suspect this wasn't the best opportunity to try it. After re-thinking how much that would be, we decided to just as for half as much to start- 8 pieces. Well, there must have been a mis-communication because they ended up bringing 16 pieces. 

At first, we didn't complain because we figured we'd eat it all anyway. Then we realized that the Nori:rice:uni ratio was way off. there was a TON of nori and rice, with a little bit of uni ontop. I tried one and couldn't stomach it. I can't say for sure whether it was a matter of taste, but something about it just tasted OFF to me. (red flag #3). I dismissed it, thinking maybe I just don't like uni, and trudged on. My friends ate all of the pieces, but left a good amount of rice. When they took away the plates, we got a scolding about how we have to eat the rice or we will get charged. It seemed like a warning, so we were diligent the rest of the time, eating all the rice. As it turns out, it was not a warning, and we got charged an additional $3 per person for leaving rice, so we shouldn't have worried about trying to follow the rule after that. The $3 per person seems like a lot, it seems like it should have been related to the price of the roll that the rice came from, but I dunno.

The other pieces of fish were just OK. Nothing was really awesome, but nothing was horrible either. The salmon and the soft shelled crab were probably the best items. The takoyaki was also pretty good. 

The cajun albacore was gross, it was hard and the seasoning tasted off. The oysters were poorly opened, so there were little pieces of shell in most of them. The super white tuna had a bad texture and was really tough. 

For me, the worst part was at the end, when we were trying to finish what we had ordered (probably a little too much, but what is AYCE without overeating??) we were each muscling down the last few pieces of the worst items... I had the last couple of pieces from the spicy poki and that's when it happened... Maybe it is because the lower quality pieces of fish were used to chop up into the poki, maybe its because it was sitting there for 30 minutes as one of the things we had ordered earlier in the night. Either way, I put a piece of tuna in my mouth and almost threw up- it tasted rotten and I had to spit it out.

When that wasn't bad enough, we got the bill... $27/person for AYCE, $3/person for leaving rice, plus tax, plus mandatory 18% gratuity for a party of FOUR or more... ended up being $152 and change (ie. $38 per person). We put in our credit cards willingly, but then told the waitress that for future reference, to be more clear on the orders, because we felt we had not ordered as much Uni as they had brought, and for us, that was the reason that we left the rice. Instead of apologizing, or offering to take of any or all of the rice charge, or even saying 'thanks for letting us know' she got defensive. and rude. and called over the manager, who continued to scold us like bad children, telling us ""we had to follow the rules"" and that THEY hadn't made a mistake, that WE needed to understand that 8 orders = 16 pieces. (we feel we ordered 8 PIECES, not 8 ORDERS, but who ever said that the customer is always right, anyway??) We even stated ""we are not disputing the charge, we just wanted you to know that there was a misunderstanding and that in the future that it could be avoided by double checking the order.""

Sorry for the long rant, I probably should've stuck with ""if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.""",1HdcgUJ75OyKLno4FJu0zA,3,1,1,qP-RKqxdFKW9c5ENbADyxA

3332505,2018-03-28,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Hikari was a perfectly fine option for teppanyaki in the city.  Not in your typical China Town location, which gives it an edge for local sushi steakhouse destination.  The teppanyaki ranges from $12 for one option to about $35 if combination.  The meal comes with onion or miso soup, salad, rice or noodle, a couple shrimp, and the entree.  Portion wise, you will guaranteed be full.  Quality-wise, the shrimp and steak was very good, but the chicken and tofu were a little bland and underwhelming.  The noodles were yakisoba which is great as it offers a healthier alternative to a full on fried noodle.  The veggies seemed a little raw coming out, but once the chef did his magic, they turned out very good although very oily.  Hikari does have a couple of really good chili and teriyaki sauces which are a must add.

Another option is AYCE sushi at a little less than $30.  But, considering they offer some solid quality sashimi, oysters, sweet shrimp, scallops, and roe on the menu, you can easily get your money's worth.  Beer is limited to Japanese brands and there are about half a dozen affordable sakes as well as house for $6.50.  

Hikari is definitely a good option for a steakhouse experience on this side of town.  The chefs might not have the same showmanship as other restaurants, but the food will be good and cooked to your liking and you'll walk out full and content.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,YXCihSHAudm6tUXrp0EC5Q

My cousin had never been here either but she said the address seemed familiar.  It wasn't difficult for us to locate.

We walked in last night almost 11ish and right away we were greeted ""irashimasen""... always a good start=)

I think it was a slow night since they said only the sushi bar was open and the open grill table.  So we sat down at the sushi bar.

We ordered the AYCE.  Basically, you can order anything you want from this list: appetizers which included soup, side dishes as well, nigiri, and rolls.

Once again, my expectations were not high since it was an AYCE and sushi?.  As to my surprise, it WAS good.  Granted they can't serve you the highest grade of quality of fish since its an AYCE but its very decent.  Service was quick even though the sushi bar was half filled.

We ordered salmon, saba, amaebi, ikura, and unagi nigiri.  My cousin ordered a few rolls-crunchy roll & one with spicy tuna.  We ordered a few more rounds of our nigiri pick but my cousin didnt get her maguro.  Perhaps the sushi chef didnt hear her the 3rd time she asked.  He kept making us salmon.  Which was ok.

For me, and everyone is different, but I felt their AYCE menu was very limited. Dessert wasn't even part of their AYCE which honestly I think should be a part of it.  

Now, the only plus side to this place is that there was AYCE sashimi which works wonders for those who can't eat rice.  Tonight this place worked out for one of the people in my party so I guess this place worked out in his favor. 

Of the few rolls I've tried, the Hikari Express was a good one. So with that being said. If you are all for sashimi, this would be the place to hit up.

On our most recent trip to Vegas, my cousin suggested that we try this restaurant which was recommended to him by his friend.  Despite the warning about the long wait, we got seated right away (on a Friday night!).  We ordered the all you can eat sushi/sashimi.  Good thing about this place is the variety of sushi they provided.  They even had Uni (sea urchin egg) and oyster on a half shell that you can eat until your heart's content.  My favorite was the ""super white tuna"" with spicy jalapeno.  The other good thing about this restaurant was the fact that you can order sashimi without the rice.  They give you pretty generous portions.  Two negatives...1)  although the fish served are fresh, they are not the best quality that you find at finer sushi restaurants.  2)  they put out the dishes so quickly that you get full very rapidly...perhaps that's the idea.

The sashimi was pretty decent. so we asked for two orders of oysters, thinking they were gonna come like nigiri(2 per order) because it takes time to shuck raw oysters....one of the chefs yells to the back""two dozen"" oysters! My wife and I looked at each other thinking ""we didn't say DOZEN!?"" We really thought that they were being funny, but no more than 5-10 seconds later, two dozen are handed to us....BIG RED FLAG...There is nothing more simple than a perfectly shucked oyster, plump, full with all is juice, and most importantly, free from the second muscle that holds the oyster in place. These oysters were none of that with the sunken in ""pre-shucked"" look you would see in a buffet totally disguised by the green onions, ponzu, and hot sauce  Some were even stabbed in half by the oyster knife and still clung to the shell because of that muscle on the bottom. Being in a open kitchen atmosphere is great for the sushi chefs to be able to interact with the guest, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice the quality and integrity of your ingredients. so as the night progressed, we tried their uni, amaebi, super white tuna etc. all okay...I see Hamachi Kama on the menu and I prepare to order that after I finish their less than impressive Frallops, rubbery calamari, and Hikari express roll with tons of crab ""filler"", and their ghetto version of Dynamite. This Kid sitting next to me orders the collar and so I sit back to see what it looks like. Again, when I order Hamachi Kama, I expect to wait at least 10 minutes...NOT MORE THAN 1 MINUTE later, the kids order arrives!? again with the ""Pre done, warmed up look. ANOTHER RED FLAG! I guess the sushi chefs rather save time for their comedic antics out front, and it shows. The kid had this grossed out, unappetizing look and his mom hands it back to the waitress saying ""He didn't like it""...we finished the evening with some green tea ice cream and mango sorbet, which wasn't included with AYCE.

A friend brought me here and i couldn't believe my eyes. I can eat as much salmon sashimi as I want!??!? I don't feel like I really need to go into much detail on how this restaurant works since it's been repeated with almost every review.  But here are some of my tips..

If you're a roll fan, you might want to look elsewhere before you decide to fork up $26 for the night. The roll menu isn't very big, well the menu just isn't very big altogether. But if you're like me, and have no interest other than for some good raw pieces of fish, then you'll enjoy your dinner just fine (more than fine really...). The pieces aren't the freshest you'll get in town but I don't usually set my expectations too high for AYCE sashimi option. On the bright side, they have AYCE OYSTERS too! They add this Japanese chili sauce to the shells which makes it even more delish! And if you're a risk taker, try the oyster shot. No questions, just do it. It's definitely an experience ;] Don't forget that if you order a handroll, you have the option of having no rice added .. save some room in your belly!

One thing I'm just not too keen of is the fact that dessert is an additional charge, $2 per mochi ice cream order..BOO! Usually skipping dessert wouldn't be such an issue for me, however, they have the option of red bean mochi, which makes it much more difficult to skip out on since I haven't been able to find it elsewhere. 

Hope all you sashimi lovers enjoy this little AYCE haven as much as I did. Happy eating!",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,8,3,4,HyAO4qH1RtW8oq9dDEQvpQ

We sat at the bar where all the AYCE patrons were all seated. Politely marking down our orders on the provided sheet, the sushi chef asked us what we wanted, we said we are marking it and he just told us to forget about the sheet and just shoot. 

We shot orders at him left and right as we finished up and he remembered everything!! Plus he was very funny and entertaining us during our whole dinner too.

Fish was fresh and we got to try almost everything on the menu except for most of the rolls (we did not want to stuff ourselves). We mainly went after their nigiri, sashimi, raw oysters and himachi kama.

A lot of their appetizers were fried which was disappointing.  No on their fried scallops (ended up just digging the insides out to eat), fried oysters and tempura. Too much batter and not much flavor. Their fried calamari was surprisingly good tho.

Adashi tofu -- too bland. Not enough flavor. 

Love their poke salad. Fish was fresh and pairs with the cucumber and seaweed salad nicely. 

Himachi Kama -- we had tons of this. Full of meat and delicious. 

Nigiri -- had tons as well. Fresh fish, large cuts with little rice. Disappointed in their sweet shrimp. Small and not as fresh as I had hoped. 

Raw Oysters -- no cocktail sauce so I did not enjoy it as much. Fairly fresh with no salt water taste. Not open to order so it could be better. I had myself a dozen or two of these.

We mostly had sashimi, all things we had were really fresh and tasty. The only thing I feel not that great is their tacoyaki. But don't get me wrong, it was still pretty good, just not as mind blowing as their sashimi. It might also because I personally don't like the slight sour sauce it came with.

Prices has gradually gone up through the years I been coming here, but trust me, it's still worth it.  Come with groups or few friends,  there'll be a little wait on weekends, but if you come early enough,  walk in and be seated isn't a problem. Service is fast and workers are friendly n does never gone for more then 5-10mins w/o coming back to ask for additional orders if you selected AYCE. 

I recommend to come in a good 'mode' to be stuffed, and you won't be disappointed or leave unhappy... Now, I will say that the only thing that holds me off for giving Hikari a FIVE star is due to freshness of the sushi and/ or sashimi. Is nothing that will ever cause any stomach pain, (unless you are THAT sensitive) but still... sometimes it's very good, other times, not so fresh. But all in all, that's would be the main concern.

I ate 20 oysters on the half-shell! Sadly, they had no effect on me what-so-ever! :( Quality of the Hamachi was superb, and instead of thin slices of sashimi, you get big chucks like eating raw fish fillet Mignon.

3791747,2009-06-08,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"It's going to be a hit or a miss here.  I've already been here a few times.  First couple of times, it was a bit above average.  The sashimi wasn't the greatest I've had at a AYCE (All You Can Eat), but it's awesome that they even had all you can eat sashimi.  One time I went, the fish was just amazing.  The service was pretty good also.  Having them do half rice rolls are great, and they'll try to accommodate by making you a roll that you want.  However, the last time I went, most of the fish looked a bit off, pale, or not exactly the right color, but my girlfriend and I ate it anyways.  Our stomachs were in great amounts of pain afterwards.  It must have been an off day there since almost everything (even the fried foods were overcooked) looked a bit off except the super white tuna and salmon.  It's forgivable this time since this hasn't happened before and the manager was nice enough to give me a refund.

You can either sit at the sushi bar or the regular dining areas.  There's a small television around the sushi bar, but sometimes the chefs seem to get distracted by it.  It's ok, they're friendly and make corny jokes.  The service is a bit funny since the waitresses forget about a few dishes since people order so much.  It's okay since the chefs hands out the orders pretty quickly.  

The place isn't too shabby, but I wouldn't consider it the a very nice sushi atmosphere.  I'm not trying to knock it, it's just the truth.  The waitresses and chefs are friendly.  So hopefully you're here on a good day when you pass by.",a0PH_2zKVQExMP5w-OJQKw,0,0,3,Dg4-N46OTriNKHydV3i3qw

I recommended this to my boyfriend in our early stages of our relationship and it has remained a favorite for us. He was never a fan of raw fish or any type of sushi till he met me and now he's even a ""pro"" at chopsticks lol. 
But anyways, we always sit at the sushi bar where we can see the chefs. They're always pretty attentive to the customers on orders and I've never once seen them mad or arguing. They're always really nice and smiling. This seems to be a family-owned business but I'm not quite sure. 

The portions of food is also very good. Not too small or too large on any of the appetizers, the rice to fish ratio on nigiri is perfect as well. You're also able to order half, full or as a hand roll on their specialty rolls for AYCE, that way you'll be able to try more rolls. They're miso soup is great and also their assorted tempura and baked green mussels. My boyfriend loves their soft shell crab but especially loves their Hamachi Kama (grilled yellowtail).

3861003,2012-11-22,3,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Shame Shame Shame on you Hikari. I have used yelp for many years just for searching restaurant reviews but have not ever joined this site until now.  I have never ever been this upset at a business until i stepped into this one.  I would never ever set foot into this business again.  My family and i total of 7 paying adults came in for the ALL YOU CAN EAT.  My youngest daughter is only 2 years old which is the 8th person and only likes to eat a couple of California rolls which i did not think it was a problem to just give her some off of ours from the all you can eat order we are getting.  When ordering the server  taking our order said it was not OK to do that but if she ordered something from the kids meal then she can and so we did what she had told us.  We ordered something off the kids meal which was chicken and rice for over $8 which my daughter did not like at all and started eating a little of our California rolls which i mean just a couple of pieces of our food which we where told it was OK by our server.  Our server comes back to us looking like she made the biggest mistake ever goes and tells us that her lady manager said to her we cant do that and for her to tell us that our 2 year old daughter can not eat off of our plates.  The manager wanted to charge us the full kids buffet price of roughly over $16 dollars and don't forget she is just 2 years old.  We did not make this mistake that employee made this mistake by telling us something that is not true and as a professional manager of a restaurant they should have honored what the employee said and not put us into this kind of situation.  My whole family had never ever been so upset that a business would do such a thing to a 2 year old.  the manager wanted to charge us for a full order of California rolls for my 2 year old but we had told her that this is just for my daughter and not us and she cant finish the whole order of California rolls and don't forget we had already paid for a chicken and rice dish that my daughter did not like at all so she can eat a little off our plates because that was what our server said would be OK.  The lady manager had reduced it to half the order of California rolls for half the price but after putting up a fight and telling her that this was wrong and not our fault.  We purchased the half order of California roll because our daughter looked sad that she could not eat ours.

Now to tell you about everything else well you already know how we feel about the service.  We came in first and of course asked for a high chair and asked again and asked again then it finally came after asking 3X so you can see requesting service is just not there but bringing the food we ordered to our table is not a problem but requesting something simple obviously is. My water stayed empty for so long.  If you like quantity over quality then this is the place to go. The sashimi was not cut right from what i know it supposed to be cut in very small pieces not huge pieces.  I felt like i was stepping all over crumbs off the floor walking in. The place is old looking and a little on the depressing side to me.  Knowing we are this upset they still included the tip in the bill and this place doesn't even include any desert in the all you can eat menu so don't expect that.  I have been to one other AYCE up in Vegas when visiting and will be returning back to that one and never ever setting foot back in this one.  I would say that this place with my experience is not kid friendly at all.  Shame Shame Shame on you.",araX3ieMH4zKcTzPjrebmQ,0,0,1,_BVYGaY-Ief5_lXelunZVg

3881897,2012-09-18,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"The BEST AYCE sushi place in all of Vegas land!  For these main reasons:

1) consistently extra fresh fish
2) AYCE sashimi - YES, you read right, sashimi!
3) AYCE fresh oysters
4) lightning fast & friendly service

The open at 5pm daily for dinner time only and stay open late.  After 10pm they have a pretty lady discount to $22 for ayce instead of the normal $26.  While their actual rolls aren't the most creative, the ayce sashimi & oysters is where it's at!  Oysters are only ayce if they're in season.  On our past 2 visits there has been shortage, so they've been limiting them to 4 oysters/customer.  On their cooked food menu the soft shell crab is great!  My favorite roll here is probably the Bonsai.  

Hikari has some of the most friendly customers.  We frequently enjoy the company and conversation of nearby diners at the sushi bar.  They also offer hibachi grilled food with seating around the grill, however we always opt for and sit around the sushi bar.  

At prime dining hours the sushi bar can get quite packed, but even so the service is still lightning fast.  Slow service is one of my pet peeves about eating sushi; it's so disappointing to wait 45+ minutes for each roll or order.  On one occasion I think it might have taken all of 5 minutes to get our order, and to our surprise and amusement the sushi chef apologized profusely.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,6,1,5,3BZWvjNW_yZQGr96BGXOhQ
3888963,2012-12-26,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"I had such high hopes for this place. I was in Vegas with my husband and in-laws to have a sin city Christmas. We decided to try Hikari for the AYCE sushi as our Christmas Eve dinner. While our waitress was super sweet and friendly, it didn't make up for the poor service we received over the entire evening. First, we sat down and were asked what we would like to drink (4 hot teas and 4 glasses of water, please) and we excitedly gave the waitress our marked up sushi order so we can get our food ASAP.

10+ minutes pass by and... nothing. The waitress frantically returns and tells us that they must' have lost our sushi order. WHAT. So she asked us to repeat our order by memory, which was really confusing for a second, until I asked her for another menu to look at so we can try to remember. Jeez.

10 minutes later, a big tray of sushi is dropped off by another waitress and is left at the empty side of the counter. We sit and stare at the tray of our sushi for another 10 minutes before our original waitress comes back and brings it to us. I would've served us ourselves, but we weren't sure it was even our food. It was just left there.

As for the food, it was decent. The fried rice and soup were standard but yummy. The rolls were pretty good (I liked the Win Roll... fried with jalapenos) and the sushi and sashimi were just ok. They were cut all weird like they had just been hacked up. I've never seen such poorly cut sushi & sashimi before. And it didn't really taste all that fresh. I know it's not like I expected the freshest and bestest sushi & sashimi ever. But c'mon.

Sad to say I arrived with high hopes and left really frustrated and unsatisfied. I will not be a return customer.

Side note: the chefs put raw meat & seafood on the trays when they do the teppan style dinner. No plates or anything. Just raw chicken, shrimp, and steaks on plastic lunch trays. The same trays they bring out your other food on. I hope they wash those with really hot water. Ew.",pULRA0ALAnDSN3W8Alb4_g,1,1,2,UYw0VSApTRLy8GQilpBrtA

We're celebrating my friend's birthday and was slow for a Saturday.  There was 2 cooks, suddenly 1 just left and this cook got mad when we came with a big order. He's head can only take 1 order at a time because if we seat at the bar only 1 or 2 things at a time. OK, understandable. Me, being nice wrote down what I want it and he didn't want to take the order because only 1 or 2 at a time. Look I wrote it down so when you can just do it.

So we wait and wait while he and this other cook (""new owner"") where just blah blah blah! This guy seriously didn't want to help him even that the guy is frustrated, that his alone, and we where hungry. At the end we end up getting up all frustrated and try to leave. We had a discussion with the ""new owner"" and pay even the whole 3 AYCE.  This is complete bullshit when someone treats you bad and still pay for bad service.

""unfortunately, after leaving this review last night, without opting for their free saki or ice cream for leaving this review, i have to make this addition. i was hoping last night's visit would be different. i have been to this restaurant before and this is not the first time the results are the following:
 i must warn the yelpers that the grade of fish this restaurant uses is questionable!!. i am saying that i was up all night with montauma's revenge! this has happened before but i gave it one more try yesterday and the result was consistent! i eat sushi all over vegas and where ever i happen to be traveling and i never have the same gi problems so it's not me guys! it's nice to have ayce sashimi, but the warning is ""stay close to a bathroom, afterwards!' you can keep the 5 stars i gave yelp last night cause i can't take them back but, i must, in good faith, warn everyone about what will happen unless you have an iron stomach! i will n e v e r go back to hikari, even if i live only 3 blocks away and it is the most convenient to me. alyce sashimi seems like a great price, but i promise you, you will, will, will pay for it later (in the bathroom). i would love to get my $30 back but, after this review, i doubt if that will happen!
btw! this is the first negative review i have ever left in my life! it's not my style...but i just feel the need to warn the public to stay away or get sick! they really need to stop serving cheap fish to manage this nonsense alyce sashimi  ""b.s.!"" service deserves a 10! quality of fish ""0""!!! if they gave you quality fish, for that price, they would have been out of business years ago. you make the choice! you take the chance! ugh!",TpY45NJHexIdwdBbatYmpQ,0,0,5,KpXMjjli7EOpHuwVawKVMA

The first time I went here I was skeptical about how good it would be for $27.95 however the quality of food is really good. The sashimi is fresh and they also offer uni and hamachi Kama. Besides sashimi and nigiri sushi they offer soft shell crab and fresh oysters and much more. They open at night from 6pm and close at 2am. If you come after 11pm it's a few dollars cheaper. If you don't want to do all you can eat you can order off the menu or do teppanyaki. Service is usually pretty fast and there is a lot of parking in front. You can also call and make reservations ahead of time. They are usually busy earlier in the evening.,BTnK7RpNqyoisPfuXXL3gQ,0,0,5,IB9C3Yt5K6wDE4IBXoiCTg

The first time we went there, I discovered a roach so my friend killed it. They gave us free dessert, lol. I was hoping for, hey half off your meal or something. 

Anyways, the sashimi is pretty yummy (second time I came it was alright, some seemed a bit tough and not as melt in my mouth type). So I guess it's a hit and miss sometimes. I like their sui mai a lot esp dipped in that spicy mayo, yum yum! I haven't really tried their rolls because I was busy eating other items and I like more raw fish rolls. I wasn't too crazy about their ahi poke because its a mixture of other fish and it's more like a sashimi salad but not really. I've definitely had better though. 

The dessert selection sucks and it's not part of the all you can eat. they are quite pricey too. A scoop of ice cream I think is like $3. I'm better off going to the store buying a big box for that much, lol. 

The funniest thing I thought about this place was that after 11pm they have a ""beautiful lady"" discount. And I joked with my friend saying, what if the girl is ugly? lol. 

Their customer service isn't all that great. Not attentive but I guess as long as they come back to fill my water cup I'm okay.

I advised two and she asked seating questions and told me to have a seat and wait for my party to arrive. Their rule of ""not seat partial parties"" was great, they seat when everyone is there.

Once ready, we were immediately walked to our seats at the sushi bar. There was two sushi chef on and they handled everyone's AYCE orders at the sushi bar immediately as well as those in the dining room. Amazing! They forgot orders here and there but simple reminder returned with several apologies.

Food was amazing as well as service. You can have sashimi, rolls, or customized. For example, you can get the baked mussels with masago on it, simple ask the chef politely and he will make it happen. First class customer service at the sushi bar by the two chefs.

Fresh fish doesn't taste old or out dated.

Rolls for AYCE can come in 4 pcs or full 8 pcs, allows you to try everything. You can also have fresh oysters, though there is a limit.

Only downside and I give it one star less is the sushi bar feels crowded, almost elbow to elbow but not enough to make it uncomfortable. If you like your space, eat in the dining room. If you sit at the sushi bar, order slowly and less plates at a time or you won't have room.

4193773,2010-02-16,4,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Sashimi lover's rejoice! An all you can eat sashimi restaurant for a decent price.  

Hikari (as everyone else has pointed out) is a 3-section restaurant.  

1) Steak house
2) Tepenyaki
3) Sushi!!!! (guess which one we went to!)

For valentine's Day, My lady wanted to go here so we did.  We were seated JUST as they opened and were greeted very warmly by everyone there.  The sushi chefs first asked, ""Are you doing all you can eat?"" And of course we said yes.  That's when the floodgates opened.  The sushi chefs and wait staff are VERY attentive and very generous and you can't forget, very fun(ny).  

We started off with the normal sashimi; ahi, yellowtail, salmon, etc.  The lady also asked for some oysters (I'm not a big fan of them) and they just yelled out, ""One Dozen Oysters!""  Every person there that ordered oysters was given a dozen.  Usually at an AYCE place,  You'd think they'd be kinda cheap with it and only give you 1 at a time, but this place was hugely generous.  It was even better when she told them I don't eat oysters so they took 10 of them back without complaining.  

So aside from the massive amounts of raw fish and rolls what sets this place apart?  Well, as an AYCE place, they have a REALLY good selection.  I already mentioned the oysters, but they also have scallop sashimi, uni and baby sweet shrimp on the menu.  First place I've seen that has these high price items on it.  

The scallops were where my lady friend went nuts.  She probably ate 15 total and the chef realized this.  The third time she asked for scallops, he said, ""Let me see your plate!"" and plopped down 6 scallops on the plate.  Then asking ""Is that enough?"".  You could see her eyes light up as we all had a good chuckle on the playfulness with the chef.  

About 80% of the way through the meal, we asked on a whim, ""Do you have salmon belly?"" And they did!!! Oh man I was in heaven.  

There is one drawback on the food aspect. It's all you can eat for about $28.  How fresh do you REALLY think the fish is?  It's fresh enough to be yummy but not fresh enough to be YUMM-O.   With the Uni, scallops, oysters, salmon belly, I'd definitely say it's worth it but it's not a place for me to go back every time I'm in vegas.

So why the 5th star?  What made it for me was the service.  That's where the extra star comes in.  The sushi chefs are generous and attentive as is the wait staff.  My tea never was empty and we always had fish in front of us.  One of the perks of being a smaller venue with 2 chefs.  They can give you more attention.  Also they're fun!  The sushi chef said, ""All you can eat anything on the menu... including me!"" In which my lady friend said, ""Okay I'll take you!""  His reply?  ""Okay I'll meet you after work"".  My only advice was that he show up with scallops.  

My word of advice is to make a reservation.  We didn't have to worry about it since we were there so early but it is small.  I can see this place filling up.  I'd say it can hold about 20 people total.",yWyGiP9ut49-l7zxAumHTg,7,5,5,wLdHhCKVTWKZKGiM8LXuBA

The poki we were served looked like it was made a few days ago and was salvaged from the trash pile, displaying a grayish color along with a rancid smell--I didn't even bother risking tasting it. The final turn off was just how bad the sashimi was. I love salmon sashimi and any place who can make me not eat it has to be doing it really bad. It's unfortunate that we can no longer bring friends and families to this place which once served up good sushi.

4253568,2009-12-28,6,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Here's the thing:

I understand why there are so many five star reviews for Hikari.  I've been to 30+ all you can eat sushi restaurants in the past few years and I've never seen anyone match Hikari's selection.  Fresh oysters, sweet shrimp, soft shell crab, sea urchin roe, even sashimi (!) which are always charged extra at normal AYCE restaurants are included in Hikari's $26.95 all you can eat price.  The fish also was fresh and all the food tasted very good.  If star ratings were based on food and price alone, Hikari would have my unabashed 5 thumbs up.

However, the service at this place was extremely lacking.  I've worked in restaurants as a server and a chef so I always try to give workers the benefit of the doubt when things are not up to par...  but after a while, even I had to stop making excuses for them.

I would say about 30% of our orders were not delivered to our table.  On three separate occasions, my party asked ""Where are our oysters?"" and the servers claimed that we hadn't ordered them, that they were coming (they weren't) and finally, unapologetically, she informed us that they had been delivered to another table (WHAT?!).  This happened also with several other items that we had ordered, although we did get servers trying to give us food that we hadn't ordered.  Maybe it was the whole ""we gave it to another table"" that was now coming around to us.

I should say in the spirit of holiday fairness that it was the busy night after Christmas.  I should also state that this unbelievably reasonable price appeals to a specific group of people with greedy streaks a kilometer wide and a penchant for trying to eat the most expensive items at the cheapest price (read: Asians).  And in full disclosure, my tablemates along with 80% of the clientele appeared to be members of a particularly avaricious brand of Asians.  

Still, if you're advertising such a great deal, and the food is so good, it's such a shame that the service is so slipshod.  (I've been working on incorporating alliteration into my prose.)  The ordering and delivery method of the servers- much like America's current health care system - is horribly broken and inefficient.  The owners/managers should train their staff to limit the number of orders taken at once to avoid wasted food as well as all of these pesky missed orders.  The only bright side to their gross inefficiency was that they did not charge our party for two large Asahi beers.  These, I drank in part to dull the ache of witnessing such terrible restaurant management.

But the way I see it, people always love a great deal and in the case of my people - Asians - low price for high quality will always trump poor service.  Just go to any Pho restaurant on planet Earth if you're not convinced of that fact.  That's not to say that our party and others within spitting distance did not complain loudly and often: we did.  It's just that the complaints were muffled by endless streams of oysters, soft shell crab and uni being shoveled into the gaping maws of Hikari's customers...  and in the end, if that's not customer satisfaction, I guess I don't know what is.",3iocNPlPThAG2ZaNtUo4TQ,4,5,3,O9fkA5y9LF01rj9NpUvd_A

Most of the group ordered the AYCE for $26.95. The waitress taking the orders was on it, however when the food came out from the sushi bar and kitchen, it was a little chaotic. Anything that was ordered by more than (1) person was made and plated together. I'm pretty sure we missed our first round of Maguro, Garlic Ahi, Tamago & Hamachi because it was also ordered or plated with someone elses sushi (they didn't ask the rest of the group if someone else ordered it, they just ate it). But we didn't speak up and just reordered it on the next go round!

-Frallops
-Seafood Dynamite
-Tako Yaki
-Shrimp Tempura
-Shrimp Fried Rice

(One side of the restaurant serves sushi and the other is a steakhouse, where patrons are seated teppanyaki style, around a grill. Teppan meaning ""steel grill"" or ""griddle"" and yaki meaning ""grilled"" or ""broiled"").

The restaurant is inviting, the servers are attentive and Nick, our chef, was excellent. This was my first time here, but those in my party had been here before and requested him. After you order what meats/fish you would like, you are served a savory broth soup with mushrooms, a salad of green leaf lettuce pre-dressed with a tasty dressing and then Nick (or your chef) chops up and saut√©s an assortment of vegetables, along with freshly prepared egg-fried rice. (He cracks the egg right there, who wouldn't get a kick out of that?) All of the items (vegetables, rice and the cooked meats or shrimp) are plated by your chef, steaming hot, right onto your plate. Lets not forget the onion tower he lights on fire and chops up - altogether its a fun experience for all ages and delicious too.

Unless your whole group would want to do Teppanyaki grill, that's a different story, but if they do, I prefer Benihana  anyways because of the ambiance.  I understand that this is a ""mom and pop"" kind of place but the decor is in screaming need of a make-over. That peeling paint, 30 year old carpet, flickering fluorescent lights, the drabby setting reminds me of eating in the basement of my college dorm room, alone. And alone is how I felt when I sat at the grill with my whole party spread out in a giant semi-circle. 

With the mood set, I can say that this AYCE place is comparable to the rest of the joint here Las Vegas. I ordered the steak plate which is quite soft and succulent but at Oyshi, you can order all you eat rib-eye plates that is almost of equal quality.

I've never had anything other than all you can eat but why would you need it when you can eat almost everything off the menu for only $27 and change? Yes everything. And hikari offers sashimi. 

That's right - sashimi! It's like the only place that I'm aware of here that offers AYCE sashimi. 

Additionally their options are pretty great. Appetizers range from seaweed salad to poki to fried rice. They also have Kama and it is definitely delicious! Unfortunately when we came they had no more salmon but the yellowtail was satisfying despite the fact that I'm not a huge fan of yellowtail. 

Sashimi and nigiri options are great. Some ""nice"" items like uni are available to be ordered 4x per person which is nice since most places allow only one order per person.

The strawberry nigori was really good! Honestly it tastes like alcoholic naked juice!

The sashimi isn't the freshest, but the quality is still not bad considering we're so far from the ocean. Some of the pieces did taste a bit bland, but the staples of salmon and tuna were good.

Even though the sashimi was just slightly above average, the hand rolls were actually pretty exceptional. While the salmon didn't taste that great in a nigiri or as a stand-alone, the salmon hand rolls were pretty superb and easily the best thing I ate in this restaurant.

While everything was just average, they do offer a dozen oysters per person for the AYCE and I think it was 6 pcs of uni per person. While the uni didn't exactly have that fresh out of the water flavor, it still tasted pretty good and you're also getting a good amount for $26 (I've been to other $20 AYCE sushi places that limit customers to like 1-2 pcs of uni per person).

Definitely not a bad place to go if you're looking for sushi in Vegas, although it's a bit pricey. Personally, I'm gonna be on the lookout for a better go-to place.",SMuYJ9REz5IIgNYt7qwDXQ,2,0,3,_FFEqz9fSHZ-hcxlNAHGkA

how often do you get to order AYCE of sashimi (AND no time limit)? that alone gets 5 stars! 

here at Hikari, you can order the following sashimi.. that's right - NO RICE!

scallops, yellow tail, salmon, tuna, white tuna, salmon belly, oyster, uni, sweet shrimp, soft shell crabs, albacore, and a whole list of sushi rolls and other appetizers. 
Yes you can also order nigiri.. but if you can order sashmi.. why would you fill your stomach w/ rice? 

i stuffed my stomach w/ 15 WHOLE scallop sashimi.. yes i have shocked my sushi chef.  and plates after plates of tuna, salmon, and a bunch of other sashimi.

For $27, this is a great deal for an AYCE sashimi place. Though the fish wasn't THE freshest of the fresh..it was still good. they're not  stingy w/ the portion either. And the service was fast. I asked for an order and w/in seconds my plate of sashimi appeared in front of me!

The uni wasn't that fresh. The sweet shrimp were rather small compared to what i'm used to having. The soft shell crab was just okay. 

My $27 was well worth it.. i didnt order any rolls.. i dont think i ate a single grain of rice.. it was just FISH FISH FISH!  Oh and the sushi chef - he was AWESOME! These two people who ate like a few dishes and then left.. he said to them ""tonight you lose""

The nigiri and the oysters are awesome.  Not a huge or creative selection of sushi rolls but the quality and cuts of the fish are great.  I don't think this place will win any design awards because it's pretty divey, but when I sat at the sushi bar the chef washed his hands between every single order.  Plus I have never gotten sick so I guess they must have a better level of cleanliness than you would think at first glance.

If you like raw fish this is the place to go. They have special all you can eat price for good looking ladies after 11pm. It's $24.50 and you will get the same food. They have good Teppanyaki menu as well. Good for birthday and some party with your family & friends :),miAyz26NJqJ72VpEa5enag,0,0,5,DJnAZ_Ebd-3TFDtduX0z4g
4669595,2010-03-20,1,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"The true all you can eat sushi place in Vegas, but you sacrifice a lot of quality.

Food:
You can load up on anything uni, toro, sashimi, oysters, anything. But just know that you will take a key hit in quality. This is a notch down from Sushi-Mon. The menu is also a lot more limited from Sushi Mon, so be prepared for that. While still good, just don't expect the best. 

Service:
The chefs here are really awesome and try to stuff your face full when you're done with your sushi. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar if you can. The wait staff was friendly at the beginning, but I think they got a little annoyed that we were ordering too much food, which we all ate by the way. It seemed like they ignored us for a while at one point in the night. 

Price: 
Dinner price is $30, which is $2 more than Sushi-Mon and doesn't include desert and 18% forced gratuity on a party of 4. They include sashimi, but can't give you desert added to the all you can eat menu? Its not like someone would come to this place and load up on mochi ice cream.

This is a true all you can eat restaurant minus desert. If you want to load up a limited selection of sushi, come here. If you want a bigger selection of sushi with better quality, go to Sushi-Mon.

The new owners made major upgrades to the restaurant and more interactive to the customers. He's very involved and it's a nice change. I'm happy to see that he kept the menu though.

The funny thing is that I asked for a crown apple with ice. I was expecting a tall glass with a few ice chips inside. Nope. The server gave me a shot glass with ice. Maybe it's just me. Lol.

They could improve their menu presentation and have the contents be consistent. In one menu it said (something along the lines), All you can eat can order up to 4 servings and the others said order up to 2 servings. So to avoid confusion on my part, I had my bf order and it was fine.

The menu selection is small, but everything we tried was fresh tasting. They buy good quality items that haven't been colored to look all pretty in the case.  Yest tuna is supposed to look dark blood red and not pink red. The place is old and definitely needs an update, but the place is authentic. The only limits to the AYCE is for Uni (4 or 5 orders I can't remember) and oysters (a dozen). Those are per person. Everything can be ordered from your sushi chef who will either tell the kitchen or the waitress. We sat at the sushi bar and the service was fast and friendly. I'm not sure I would like it at the tables, which are the unused hibachi tables. People complained the food tasted bland, but if they knew real Japanese sushi instead of the Vegas Korean owned places, they would know that it's about the fish and not drowning everything in vinegar and eel sauce. I thought it was hilarious someone complained about the oysters not being stuck to the shells...they are not supposed to be if they are shucked properly. No, this is not the best place ever, but it's good authentic Japanese sushi for a decent AYCE price. The highlights for us were, the uni, oysters, screaming O, poki, spicy tuna, salmon skin hand roll, soft shell crab, and mixed sashimi.",8rYnOC6IU_A_f-o73aDt9g,2,2,4,TvKMuXA9OQYPC5nR9EhDTg

That was unfortunate for me because salmon is my favorite!  Throughout the night I also had the agedashi tofu, which was pretty bland with not much flavor, even while soaked in sauce.  I also tried a few rolls, but I can't recall what they were as they were ordered by others.  (I'm looking at you Elnino...)

The first time the service was horrendous but the fish was soooo fresh and delicious. This time, the service was great and the fish was good, but not as much as last time.

Sashimi we ordered; 

Salmon; it still had some of the skin not cut off. I hate that haha. It was fresh but not buttery. 
So then, we ordered salmon belly in hope it would be better and it was. It was sooo buttery and melted in my mouth. 

Garlic tuna; pretty good. Wish it was more garlicky.

Ama ebi; great like always! 

Scallops; they were okay. Scallops are my favorite so I can tell the difference. Slightly fishy.

Yellowtail; I've had better. But still good.

Other things we ordered; 
Unagi; mmmm yummy! A lot of rice in that nigiri though. 
Screem inor gazim; seated tuna in spicy creamy sauce. so good! A must get.
Dynamite; very different than what I'm used to. It came with scallops like usual, but here they make it with zucchini. I could've used without that. Wish there was more crab.

My friend had come here on his previous trip to Las Vegas and he wanted to take my family here as a place to try since he knew how much my family loved sushi. 

Earlier that day, I made a reservation, hoping they could accommodate and I'm so glad they could! They lady I spoke with was so kind and understanding after I told her I may need to change the time of our reservation, it was originally at 5 but then I changed it to 8 since everyone pigged out someplace else earlier that day. 

We got there and only had to wait a few minutes while they cleared the table. While we were waiting, we all looked over the menu to see what we wanted to order. What I find amazing is that you can order pretty much anything on the menu as part of the AYCE special (~$27 plus tip). I'll post the picture of the menu after I finish this review. 

Despite the fact that I had a party of 18, the server did her best to make sure we got what we ordered.. However, my cousin didn't have too good of an experience.. He ordered a few rolls but didn't get them.. Probably because other people were taking his rolls, thinking that it was theirs..right when we were all finished, BOOM all of these rolls came out for him.. most likely because he kept reminding her and she had to re-enter the order. That's the only down side to our experience.

On arrival immediately noticed that smelly stained disgusting grey carpet was gone - replaced by a dark wood Pergo-type floor.  We had hopes.  Seated by a woman who said ""I'm new"".  

To the sushi bar:   Noticed the display case still had the overly-obvious build-up of glue sealant used all around the client side of the display case.  hmmmm.   Two chefs.  One looked vaguely familiar - but more like a relative of the fellow we always saw at the side facing you when you first approach the bar area.  There were other guests including a family with young children who spoke a combination of English and what sounded like Russian

My first, and only order of sashimi -yellowtail, salmon, tuna::  The salmon was fine - there was a huge thick bone in my yellowtail - the tuna was dark red, and the taste told why - blood red - they don't properly prepare (as in bleed) the fish, or they are purchasing from purveyors who don't know what they are doing.  Rather than make a big deal about it, I simply covered the plate with another.  The woman who seated us was also the person serving beverages, picking up plates, and ultimately bringing the check.  Upon retrieving the empty dish, she loudly asked us what was wrong with the tuna - my husband responded ""we didn't care for the taste"".  She then proceeded to present it to the chef, again rather loudly gesturing towards us.  We ate a few more items - shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, uni (definitely not fresh) and then left.

I hadn't eaten in 17 days because I was on the Master Cleanse Detox so I was beyond excited to finally eat some delicious food..!
I've been to Hikari many many times and service has always been pretty bad but yesterday was just horrible. They do not know how to handle even the slightest rush. The servers were too busy catering to the needs of the hibachi patrons that they were nonexistent on the sushi bar side. 

There were 2 sushi chefs.. 1 older guy who only lets you order 1 item at a time and a younger guy who doesn't even pay attention to you.
You literally have to shout at them to get their attention and then shout your order over everyone else. Even when they are not doing anything and you clearly want to order something they avoid eye contact with you and don't bother to ask you what you would like to order. 
The place is old, dirty and run down. There are no actual tables so you have to sit shoulder to shoulder with strangers at the bar.. The fish is not fresh and when you order ""sashimi"" it is presented in the most unappetizing manner.
They also pack on their mushy rice for nigiri so watch out.
Their only saving grace is their AYCE uni but sometimes the color/quality is questionable. 
I also like their kama but everything in their appetizer section is premade and comes out room temperature so that is pretty weird. 
No dessert included in AYCE.
If the service from the sushi chefs wasn't so horrible then this place could be 3 star worthy but nope... 1 LONELY STAR FOR YOU HIKARI~!!!!

Food - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Cleanliness - 5/5

Overall - 5/5

I use to come here once every few weeks. It's the only place in town to my knowledge that still serves AYCE Sashimi. The service over at the sushi bar is always friendly by the chefs and waitresses. The food however is hit or miss certain times. There are days where the sashimi taste extremely fresh and there are times when you don't feel as good after it. 

*Hint* The fish is better quality when you order it as sushi rather than sashimi. I normally still like to order the fish as sashimi but I would try to get an order of my favorite fish as sushi to taste it after sashimi is not as filling. 

--------------------------------------------Food - 5/5-----------------------------------------------¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠----
Last time I was here the quality of the food wasn't bad. I really enjoy my recent experience here. The uni and fish quality was surprisingly fresh. As I said, from coming here roughly 50+ times since opening, my recently experience was one of the better ones.  (I kept all my receipts and realized how much money I spend on sushi :( 

Some recommended items on the menu (my favorites)

-Screaming Orgasm - Ahi Tuna with Screaming sauce. I like this for many reason, its comfort food for me now.

-Uni - One of the places in town that limits you to 4 orders per person. The quality can be hit or miss, but every time I'm here I have to get my Uni fix.

-Sweet Shrimp - One of the few places in town that has a higher limit. It also allows sashimi orders of it.

-Dynamite - Fully cooked item, with broccoli, scallop covered with special sauce.

-Oyster - They used to be a lot bigger but they have reduced the size of the oysters, but still pretty fresh. 

-Sashimi Combo - A mix of Salmon, tuna, yellow tail, white fish. Makes it easy to get a taste of all the sashimi without ordering them individually.

Very clean atmosphere. There was a situation before where we had a not so clean experience but recently in the last year or so, everything seems to be in good condition

Great food for the price. As I mention before, not many place offer AYCE sashimi in Las Vegas with no limit. The price is a little bit more expensive compared to other locations by a few dollars for dinner time, but with less restriction on orders limits it makes sense for the price. *Dessert is not included*",sCb9265DeUJLDIcvs03Owg,1,0,5,G1MML206i3iCN2vh-PaDag

We were given the choice of a table or the sushi bar.  I prefer the relative privacy of a booth or private table, so opted for that.  Instead, we were seated at a teppanyaki table (without the teppanyaki cooking to entertain us) along with two other incredibly loud families.  While I understand the restaurant can't be held accountable for the volume of their patrons, I felt slightly duped by being told we'd get a table.  They really should have said ""Sushi bar or non-sushi bar but bar-like seating?""

Service was slow and typically curt.  Selection was limited, especially the rolls.   They were all variations on the same roll.  No diversity whatsoever.  The nigiri was only okay, but there are fresher and better places around.  

My memory of this place is a little hazy, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I seem to remember dessert not being included as part of AYCE.  

There are about a dozen AYCE places within five minutes of Hikari that are significantly better.  I don't know why anyone would bother with this place.",zfPw8FJxEI79j0H-OHeHZA,1,0,2,EIkRwew5E3IIvg6OKFdCFg

Gosh, I just love eating all that uni, ikura and raw oysters!  It's so good!  The catepillar roll (sans rice), and then you add a little uni and ikura on top - yum yum!  

The Husband and brother-in-law created their own hand roll of uni, ikura, sprouts, and gobo root.  Or salmon skin hand roll with some tako as well.

Their scoop of green tea ice cream ($2.50) is pretty good, and the coconut sorbet that comes in a coconut shell reminds me of my honeymoon.  Very coconutty!

Apparently they don't take reservations for the sushi bar after 5 pm.  They don't have any regular tables, but they let you sit at the teppanyaki tables instead and order sushi from the waitstaff.  And we're beginning to think it's actually faster and more efficient getting our food while sitting at the tables instead of at the bar.

If you're in the mood to eat all the fishies in the Pacific Ocean (I'm assuming because it's the closest ocean to Nevada), get your tummies ready! This is not a bad option to go to fulfill all of your sushi needs if you live in Vegas or if you're a frequent visitor but if you're staying on the strip and have other options (aka buffets galore on the strip at Cosmo or Caesar's) I would personally choose those options versus this all you can eat restaurant. 

The best thing about this place that sets it apart from all other AYCE sushi establishments it they serve SASHIMI. Honestly, this is something I wish all AYCE sushi places had the option for because I half the time I really only want the fish. From salmon to tuna, they have it as a sashimi option. More fish to love! Can I get a woot woot! 

Eating out here is going to cost you ~$30 or less when you consider tax and tip. 

The fish quality here didn't feel the best to me and it wasn't anything too impressive but for being in Nevada and quite a ways away from the ocean's cost it's not too shabby and there's many different roll and appetizer options! You can also even get miso soup! 

The service here is pretty good too! However, sometimes I think the servers got confused and mixed up our orders with other tables. They kept bringing out dishes that weren't ours or multiple orders of the same thing. We didn't mind at first and thought it was our bad at first, until we realized...it wasn't our food (it was AYCE so no biggie, but I mean still). It was just a little frustrating because it didn't look like Hikari was that busy yet for them to mistaken multiple orders between different parties (seated in completely different areas of the restaurant).",BE2JZ9cll61q8SqqJFD3rA,4,1,3,kDaSc7kt5ftWsHDOG7_yhA

This is the first restaurant I ever tried something off the strip since most of the time, I just stay at the strip with the exception of eating at RIO, Palms, South Coast, or M ...I don't think I ever ate in Downtown...

The sushi at the buffets usually suck, they're usually not fresh and not made by sushi chefs. I try to avoid all types of sushi or shashimi when I'm at those places. For AYCE, I come here. The last time I went it was $25 per person. I'm just sad that this place only opens at night. That means need to go on the day before leaving Vegas :(

The place is usually packed. However, you can either do the sushi side or the tempanyaki side (I think that's what it's called) I never actually do that...I only go to the sushi side. I usually get full with the rice so they accomodate and can give you the shashimi only. I don't think they limit the amount of uni or oysters you can get because I've done six and a dozen (respectively) each time but you kind of get sick after a lot of it. Sick it a good way lol. or they don't really pay attention since you just start calling out to the sushi chefs if you want something and don't write anything down.

drafting this review prior to eating.. thats how bored out of mind i am. will update if service is faster..

1 star off for 1 hour wait time while half the restaurant was empty.
1 star off for ordering miso soup 3 times, adegashi tofu twice, and not getting any of it.  In fact,  we got octopus sashimi, somehow instead.
1 star off for mixed sashimi quality.  First round looked REALLY fresh, while the second round was cut weird, and looked very old, and tasted fishy!!  Was this a sign that I should not be ordering sashimi more than a single round?

I think I'll try this place one more time, to see if my experience improves, but not sure if it will.  Do the very young done up japanese waitress/hostesses make up for anything?

You don't want to be rude where you are about to dine :) As we waited we seen how this place was very filthy. There registered was piled with receipts, paper & trash and where we sat and waited (looked like bar section) was piled with dirty cups from one end to the other...I have no idea how they received  an (A) on their health inspection! 

When we were seated we seemed to have a ""nice"" waitress but very neglectful! No refills, no napkins, no kids chopsticks & our dishes piled....customer service kind of sucked.

5070163,2011-06-17,4,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"THE BEST AYCE sushi in Vegas! For 26.95 you CANNOT go wrong. 
I was taken here by my friend who goes here every time he is in Vegas; and now I see why. I was a little confused when I first got seated because there was no conveyer belt or large sushi counter in sight; how could this be an AYCE sushi place without a central sushi counter I wondered? The restaurant is setup like a Benihana with seats around a grill and a small sushi bar. We were seated at the tables, and I believe the tables hold about 6-8 people on each side. The waitresses were extremely patient with our party especially since they had to come back and forth at least 10 times! The menu looked like a traditional restaurant sushi menu with the different rolls and sushi with the prices, so it was easy to keep track of the financial damage you were avoiding.  

I personally went to town on the Sashimi Combo plate and the Hamachi sushi because I could eat sashimi by itself and be happy. The Sashimi Combo plate had about 12 total pieces of Tuna, Yellow Tail, Salmon, and Red Snapper. Each piece of fish was extremely fresh and melted in my mouth; this was where the real quality sashimi was. The Hamachi sushi was served in pairs and like the Sashimi Combo was extremely fresh. I did not get into any of their house rolls, but they had the common house rolls Spicy Tuna, Philadelphia, Crunchy, etc. 

The poke was also included in the AYCE menu and had enormous amounts of flavor! There was a nice kick to this dish, and I found myself ordering this more than once. 
For dessert was NOT included in the AYCE menu, but it was a great cap to this epic meal, they had green tea, mango, and lychee sorbets for $2.50 (but don't quote me on the price). The lychee sorbet was one of the BEST sorbets I have ever had! 

Hikari has the best quality fish I have ever had in Vegas, and for the price, Hikari trumps everything else I've ever had in Vegas. I highly recommend that you try Hikari the next time you are in Vegas; the high quality fish and fresh fish for a great price is well worth your time.

5070891,2011-03-13,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Ok honestly tell me a sushi bar somewhere that offers ANY type of fish on their menu as sashimi.  This place encourages it.  I've been here many times and although their menu is a bit smaller then most places, they will still make you anything you want and even their uni and sweet shrimp is unlimited.  Hikari is only open for dinner and they stay open late til 2 a.m. and they always have a crowd.  Service is definitely friendly and food is always fast.  I know what you're thinking though, with some places fast means their food is pre made. That's definitely not the case here.  I think the only thing that MIGHT be prepped ahead of time is their oysters on the half shell.  

I'm definitely not worried about anything not being fresh because this place always get a good crowd and fish is definitely not just sitting around in the fridge.  What's even more incredible is their sashimi and nigiri.  I ordered some super white and seared tuna and a nice thin slice is always expected but not this time.  I think it measured 2 full inches in length and the thickness was incredible.  The fish on 2 pieces of nigiri was equal to almost 4 or 5 pieces based on the thickness and yet the rice was still just the normal small ball that you'd expect.  They definitely don't cheat you on any fish and when you order any of their rolls, they are normal size rolls and not overstuffed with fish or rice. It's very well balanced.  If I want a large piece of fish, I'd rather have it as nigiri or sashimi.  

Their onion soup is also very good and has a slight peppery taste to it.  

Their to go menu is also very good and I've ordered several times.

Unfortunately they don't offer a stamp card or half rolls but who the hell cares, unlimited sashimi definitely makes up for it. 

If you've ever been here, the most interesting thing is the owner.

Feels like Japaense AYCE is hard to come by these days since they are usually over priced! But for $27.95 a person.. that's not bad. Basically if you order three rolls+ you got your money's worth. But ladies! If it's after 11PM, you are only $24.95. 

Anyways for the AYCE, you'll have to sit at the sushi bar... which we all know sushi bars are pretty cramped and you're basically elbowing your next door neighbor. That's one down side. And if you're going to order a lot, there is no space. Space is limited! So order one at a time. But that's how they get you because if you do that you fill up quicker (;

Let's talk about the food first... let's be real here. Where the heck can you get fresh seafood in Vegas when you are surrounded by dessert. So this is definitely not the freshest sushi/sashimi/nigiri you will get. So you should really check what you're eating. I mean double check or triple check before you eat. I didn't find anything wrong with the raw fish. So the sashimi, nigiri, and sushi rolls were pretty flavorful. I tried each of their nigiri rolls and ah it is definitely worth it. They do layer on the sauce on their rolls. So if you're not a huge fan of sauce, I definitely recommend the nigiri rolls. So worth it if you have the AYCE. Or you can always order half rolls. Appetizers are the standard. Calamari, oysters, mussels, edamame, etc. They are okay. Very typical. 

Service: It's okay. I think we had to flag down our waiter/waitress a couple times to get refills of our water/hot tea. That was pretty annoying. The food came out relatively fast, but you can definitely tell that the sushi chefs were in a daze. Sometimes they didn't hear what we ordered and sometimes they did. It was a hit or miss. But it was okay. I survived it. Yes the rolls sometimes fell apart due to sloppiness, but it was still decent.

I still give this place 3-stars because food was decent.. but then again... I should probably reconsider as I did see a baby cockroach roaming around the sushi bar. But so far, I haven't gotten sick and it's been a couple of days..",6ImN7CLRvsDnrAx6DF4nIw,2,1,3,hdGeu_ybhhNrXXhtph2qnw

5198956,2010-02-01,6,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"I might need to hide under some tuna belly in case the sashimi lovers backlash, but let me say that if you love sashimi and raw oysters, then Hikari is probably a four or five star experience for you. However, if those are not your favorite, then there are definitely better AYCE values in Las Vegas. 

AYCE at Hikari is $26, and if you are looking to stuff your face with sashimi and oysters, I think you will get your dollars worth, but given that most AYCE is closer to $22, if you are looking for creative rolls, you should definitely go elsewhere. The actual rolls at Hikari are a bit substandard with the showpiece being 5 different variations on a shrimp tempura roll. Imitation crab is abundant. Roll-eaters are definitely subsidizing the sashimi-feasters.

The staff is definitely friendly. The sushi chefs are all smiles and the banter back and forth between the chefs and the kitchen is entertaining. However, I personally do not enjoy the high pressure sushi bar set-up. If you go for sushi, you will more than likely end up sitting at the sushi bar because the tables are for steakhouse customers, and you have to deliver your order verbally to the sushi chefs, who then announce the order. I know this is the sushi bar vibe, but I just feel judged when I order my fifth cucumber salad. (People, I like cucumbers.) 

To make matters less than pleasant, there are also fluorescent lights to deal with. I just could not get comfortable jammed at the sushi bar meekly ordering cucumber salads and feeling guilty that I was not really putting my dollar to use because I was not gulping down raw tuna. I do appreciate the ""raw"" appeal, but I think I appreciate a more well-rounded AYCE experience more.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,3,3,j1VXmFJFhsTkmRN__4079Q
5201764,2014-01-11,1,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Not sure why people gave this place 4-5 stars because this place is awful! $27 for AYCE and yes you get sashimi, oysters, etc but they tasted/looked like they've been sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. Sashimi combo had tuna that was like blood red (good tuna is a bright red), some of the sashimi pieces tasted rubbery and felt like it had a layer of slime on it as well. Salmon sashimi was ok, the white tuna sashimi was terrible. There are also some other sashimi choices but they were terrible as well. I believe they reuse the oyster shells because none of the oysters i got were attached to the actual shell. If anyone has ever tasted the oysters from the jars at like vons or albertsons, they taste exactly like that (when you ask for no sauce).  DO NOT EVER GET ALBACORE sashimi, they just throw lumps of white fish that taste old,rubbery, and slimy with some garlic sauce. Drinks and dessert were also EXTRA charge.  Choices for rolls and nigiri were pretty limited. They basically have the same rolls but add  like 1 extra thing  like california roll and the dragon only differed by the 1 piece of eel added. 

Want good sushi? go 2 sushi kaya or sushimon, they're cheaper, have more choices and probably have fresher items. They just don't offer sashimi.  Didn't have any messed up orders, food just plainly sucked with very limited choices, tasted old and looked bad. 

The manager was rude. She said that it was my tastes and expectations of what the albacore dish was suppose to be. So i guess its the customers fault that they don't want to eat supposely ""white tuna"" that had some brown coloring that was drenched in garlic sauce that tasted old and rubbery. She also stated that they ""get it fresh every day"" which means they probably defrost it from the freezer daily... 

Had a really pleasant and nice waitress tho so that was probably the only positive of this place.

Long rant, but had to write an essay because i choose this place due to some bad yelpers giving this place 4-5 stars.... (you guys should stick to pizza hut or sushi from vons)",DITvDPTlKj8im6T8AOwrig,0,0,1,M2RJmYFqt8pMP79gP9bFyA

5217661,2017-03-10,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"For obvious reasons, I rarely write a #RestaurantReview when ordering out, but when I arrived at Hikari 20 minutes after I was supposed to, my food wasn't ready (I don't think they were even aware of the online order). This meant that I would get freshly prepared #sushi and an opportunity to gain at least some sense of the joint's ambiance, which is where I begin this review.

Located in a strip mall at the southwest corner of Flamingo and Buffalo, Hikari is a simple establishment not unlike some of the eateries I have visited in Tokyo, though Hikari was notably more spacious than its Japanese counterparts. The terms ""understated"" and ""working class"" both come to mind. Diners can eat at a table or at the sushi bar. Also lending to its apparent authenticity were the staff I encountered, all of whom appeared to be Japanese. I note this only because the majority of sushi operations in Las Vegas are owned and operated by people of another singular Asian nationality.

Despite Hikari Japanese Steakhouse's name, its main draw seems to be the all-you-can-eat sushi, which is what most, if not all, of the spattering of guests was partaking in as I arrived on a Saturday night well past the usual supper time. I ordered a shrimp yum yum roll and a smoked salmon Philadelphia roll, the latter of which I had never eaten anywhere. The yum yum roll was exceptionally scrummy, due in no small part to the yum yum sauce, which tasted like a sweetened rice wine vinegar-based mayonnaise with only the slightest bit of tomato paste and melted butter. Its sweetness delightfully complimented the roll filled with shrimp, crab meat and avocado. My only criticism of the sauce is that it had no kick to it, but since carry out orders are packaged with the sauce on the side, I can add my own cayenne pepper next time. The Philadelphia roll was also tasty, though at an all-you-can-eat experience, I'd only place a half order so as to avoid becoming overwhelmed with cream cheese.

I rarely crave sushi, but when the urge does come, Hikari is my recommendation to plop down and mange on it until you can't fit any more. For its food and understated authenticity, Hikari Japanese Steakhouse is definitely worth the trip.",O0JPkrL9cBxx2u1Ka9iAXA,0,0,4,LPdKWIlpQxCECGBDMdkhkg

I can say service was exceptional. There is no time limit and waitresses really keep the plates coming ! Major props to the staff for that. 

Things that were damn good:
*Philadelphia roll. Surprisingly well made and tasty given the circumstances.
*Super White tuna - great texture, not fishy at all. MMM
*Fried rice. I know I'm lame for ordering this, but it was what I was craving. Yummy ! 

Just Ok:
*Soft shell crab appetizer
*Edamame - cold and not salty enough for me
*Yellowtail - not fishy, but not fabulous
*Oysters - ok to be fair I didn't eat any. However I thought it was sketchy that some of them were soooo tiny. Like the size of a dime tiny. Just didn't seem like ""normal"" oysters to me. 

EW:
*Screaming Orgasm - yes I was idiotic to order a sauce covered fish at an AYCE place. Everything was going alright so I figured, how bad can it be? Disgusting my friends. The fish was those hack job chewy end pieces that you can't really eat without gagging. Sauce was watery mayo. Stay far far away from this!

Overall can't say I was wowed, but I got what I expected for AYCE . Service was great and food was just ok.  I did have a fun time with the Yelp crew and look forward to the next sushi UYE !",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,3,3,3,MqB-A5GRXumE60jP0X2ATQ

-Yellowtail sashimi
-Super white tuna (traditional and spicy)
-Sweet shrimp sashimi (whoa...)
-Uni sushi (figured I would need the rice this time)
-Kama (the grilled fish jaw - yes, on the AYCE menu)
-Fresh oysters
-Soft shell crab
-Baked mussels
-Miso soup
-Saporro and Large Hot Sake (6 shots worth) : not AYCD...

I am extremely glad that business friend brought me here for late dinner one night--exceptional experience. First of all, this is a very ethnic restaurant--you will have as true of a Japanese experience as possible. Everything from the dishes served to the friendly Japanese servers are authentic. This is not an Americanized sushi place--you will find many ""weird"" foods by American standards. The cooks will make everything by your suggestions, but I would definitely advice to just tell them ""make it the best way you know how."" There are a lot of raw foods here--raw fish, sashimi (out of this world, by the way), raw oysters with super yummy spicy sauce etc. This place is not for the unadventurous, although there are several dishes that are very common, such as the hot menu. However, this plase is only amazing if you are able to enjoy it all--with its traditional atmosphere and its traditional raw seafood dishes. If you have a gentle stomach, this may not be the best place to dine.

Service is quiet, quck and with an occasional Japanese joke humor. Traditional wide variety of alcoholic drinks. This restaurant is open after 5PM only up until 2AM. Good looking ladies (pretty much 99.9% of women) get discounts on all you can eat meal after 11PM.

5341833,2010-10-14,7,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"This review is my REAL experience at Hikari.  No exaggerations or BS and none needed.

Hikari is an embarassment to Japanese businesses on the whole if they continue to practice customer discrimination.  

I ordered from the kids menu for my 3 yo and the sushi AYCE for myself.  
I specifically marked nigiri sushi on the order slip, but the Japanese waitress assumed I didn't know what I was ordering.  After scrutinizing the order like an IRS auditor, she apathetically repeated quite a few times ""nigili -with lice...sashimi -no lice"".  She went as far as almost warning ""... you no eat the lice, we charge for waste"".  

Then she coldly muttered ""no shaling"" and walked away.  Again, assuming we didn't know the rules of AYCE.  

After finishing my modest order of nigiris, I ordered a couple of salmon skin hand-rolls.  This time the waitress said ""Hand loll, loll BIGGGGG, you not finish...""  OMG, she was assuming and discriminating again just 'coz I don't look like someone with a sumo wrestler's appetite.

I would be lying if I said we enjoyed our meals.  The whole time we were eating, the waitress watched us like a cctv.  My 3 yo innocently reached over for one of the nigiris and she was over at our table quicker than a New York minute, sternly repeating the 'Golden Rule' of AYCE - ""no shaling"" and walked away.   I understand she was looking out for the business, but she was taking it a little too far without being discrete about it.  What do you want me to do, chastise my 3 yo over sushi ?

I had ordered a total of 12 items from the AYCE menu over 3 separate times, but only received 9 items.  Is the establishment assuming that I cannot possibly finish my food ?

Here's the kicker, when I asked for the check, the waitress handed me the bill stapled to AYCE order slips which weren't even mine, but the $$$ amount was correct.

Btw, have I mentioned the quality of the food ?  

It was definitely not worth the 5-mile trek west of The Strip.  At best, Hikari is just a neighborhood ma & pa place for locals, not a 'must try' destination for out-of-towners.  There are better sushi joints on The Strip.  

The raw ostiones looked like they were on a diet.  Pathetic, shrunkened and undernourished morsels sitting in oversized half shells.  The raw fish on the nigiris tasted like they were pre-cut and not freshly sliced.  The salmon skins inside of the hand-roll were not crispy.  In fact, the roll looked like a  sheet of seaweed rolled into a cone which was exactly what it was 'coz the fillings certainly didn't leave any lasting impression.
  
The food from the kid's menu was salty & greasy.  Do they want the kids to die young OR are they assuming that kids don't know any better.

I don't know how Hikari reviews get all the stars.  Just don't discriminate or play games with your customers and treat them with respect.",obRw-jXq6J3b3XS-ABEw2w,7,3,1,VgrJZ-Xvkw3WVKZDw4nEnA

Even the fried/cooked stuff (which most is pre-cooked since that shit comes out less than 2 minutes since you throw out your order) was definitely deelish! Agadashi tofu was crisp and hot! Prepped pacific oysters were just as yummy.  Tempura was nice and crisp and so was the soft shell crab (crab by itself!) Even the fried rice (I know I know) was full of flavor. I didn't care for the Poke salad, it was just a bit too much funk for me and cut waaay too big for me to enjoy.    

I loved everything except for the cooked Yellowtail collar was a bit on the bitter and dry side. 

Service was excellent!  They have a sign that says after 11PM - AYCE is ~$23.95 for ""hot ladies"", I asked the main chef, ""so what happens if they ugly?"" He goes ""well then you better be nice to us or you pay full price!""  Damn, it's like that now? Glad we came in our pool party wear then! =P

They were very busy, but we had excellent service.  We sat at a table that was usually used for steak service, most of the table was booked with a large group, celebrating an engagement.  At first thought, we'd would get lot in the crowd, but the wait staff came around regularly and made us feel as if we were important.  

We looked over the menu and made our first few choices.  When they arrived, they were fresh in appearance, the smells were great, and the flavors were spot on.  

There is plenty of sashimi with both red and white snapper, salmon, hamachi, magruo and tempura.  Overall, great food, but with limits in selection, gets old ordering just sashimi and oysters, we'll be looking to try someplace with more selection.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,4,1,4,gIwY4IuKQkr5RsIK6UnVPA

Sushi was great. There's a lot of basic rolls, nothing fancy. Their house roll, Hikari, was the best one! I had two full orders of that. There's even a foot note that you can modify it and add other things like cream cheese, green onion, quail egg etc. 

Sashimi was good too. I tried a few different ones and liked all of them! So this place erased my bad experiences with sashimi from my memory.

The sushi chefs were fantastically fast. We never had to wait more than a few minutes for our orders. Waitresses were fine with my friends, but kept forgetting to refill my drink. 

Only problem? For parties of four or more, there's an 18% gratuity charge. Which would be okay except that it was unclear whether it was added to our total or not. We paid, assuming we were charged for the tip, only to be frantically told we forgot to tip. We thought we saw it added to the bill, but the waitress insisted we tip.

A lot of sushi shops leave uni, sweet shrimp, and super white tuna off the menu, but not Hikari.  Everything is clearly printed on the menus.
Their sashimi is awesome. They get shipments almost every day, so their fish is very fresh for Vegas.  I love the rolls here too.

I mean, let's be honest...AYCE restaurants are incomparable to their pay-for-what-you-order counterparts, not because the quality is lacking or anything like that (even though most of the time it is), but because they satiate different needs.  We need to compare apples to apples, people.  Typically, when food is of a higher quality, it is going to cost more.  That is a simple fact of life and it makes sense, which means that there is no way an AYCE restaurant, especially not sushi, could possibly be on the same level as normal sushi restaurant.  Now, with that being said, Hikari is the best AYCE sushi restaurant I've ever been to thus far.  I rest my case.",CXi7I5J-ItLGJNyKPkI5gA,2,0,4,mIEfmFKvuAHxf6EOsh7XlQ

5602580,2011-08-16,0,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"Omg what a steal! If you have a car while in Vegas, love AYCE Japanese, love a value meal, then this is the place to go! Yes, those Vegas buffets are fantastic. I mean I love my share of prime rib, roasted bone marrow, king crab legs, and the whole lot, but really Hikari was fantastic. I've never been to an AYCE Japanese sushi bar that has this type of selection and quality. The only bad thing about this review is that it might actually convince more people to try it which means longer wait times for me. But I can't contain my excitement! 

They have an entire menu a la carte, but you can order anything off that menu (not just the sushi and nigiri) for the price of $26.95pp! Considering the variety of items - not just the standard Japanese fare you see in other AYCE restaurants - that is a great, great deal. We ordered:

- Sashimi combo (had hamachi, tuna, salmon sashimi. The tuna looked like it had quite a few tendons but the rest looked rather fresh and fatty)
- Fresh oysters with Japanese mignette (the oysters, though small and perhaps a little shriveled, was surprisingly delicious and fresh! The sauce made it better and gave it a kick, a great accompaniment to the richness of the oyster meat)
- Hamachi Kama (you can also choose to have the salmon kama or collar, but the hamachi kama was really great. It was freshly roasted, the meat was succulent and juicy, great flavor - don't forget to ask for a lemon! It really helps bring out the best flavors)
- Rainbow roll (I know, what was I thinking with the rice? Yes, it had rice so I wouldn't recommend getting the rolls but the flavor was rather good for AYCE!)
- White Tuna sashimi (Tasted a bit frozen but still had that fatty flavor)
- Hamachi sashimi (Fresh and delicious)
- Sweet shrimp sashimi (This seems to be a rare find and is great! Just as good as the ones I ate in Japan. One plate of this sashimi was served with about 10-15 shrimp, has texture and yet somehow melts in your mouth fantastic)
- Baked green mussels (Surprisingly unique in texture and freshness)
- Dynamite (This was probably the more disappointing of all the dishes. Has mayo, some imitation seafood, and veggies baked in and it took a while to make)
- Uni sushi (Each order comes in 2 and this cannot be served as sashimi, but this was the BEST dish of the night by far considering it's AYCE. It was fresh, rich, luxurious, just perfect. The only thing that could have been improved upon would be the seaweed paper, it was chewy)
- Shrimp & Veggie Tempura (freshly fried to perfection)
- Fried Tofu (well fried, good sauce, though if you're not that big a fan, it's something you can skip unless you just want something hot)
- Seaweed Salad (pretty norm)
- Fried soft shell crab (Really well made - perfectly fried with all the great fried crunchy pieces and the soft melty innards and crab meat on the inside)

That's all I can remember before I jump into my car and start driving out to Vegas again for a second round.

Notes:

You can order off most items off the nigiri menu and ask for it to be served as sashimi - they'll add more to your order and take out the rice!

Take it slow. We made the mistake of being overly hungry and ordering a crapload of stuff up front, definitely enjoy the experience and take it slow. The chefs are fantastic and friendly and it's definitely worth the extra few moments you spend at the sushi bar.

Dessert is not included but isn't overpriced - a couple scoops of ice cream was $2.50.",91Mo2-qrDaZsFC2zM8Yuqw,1,0,5,VDhd-KPeaBi0O-1soDqPWA

even though I don't eat sashimi, I still come here quite often since my gf loves sushi and uni. I even have their Hikari cap from my birthday.

And yet, I still decided to give them a one-star? There must be good reasons.
So I went last night (3/13) for my girlfriend's birthday dinner.
We arrived around 7pm, store was quite empty, we sat at the sushi bar.

Service:
The waitress was ok. But the chief never really greeted us but was watching TV most of the time. I understand it wasn't busy but had get his attention to order something every time was annoyed. When he finished making the food, he just stick his arm out the bar for you to catch it. And without saying ""excuse me"" or ""your (roll) is ready"", I had food almost in my mouth, I had to shove all the food in my mouth, hurry down my chopsticks to grab the plate in front of my face. 

Food:
This is the main reason that upset me. The food wasn't as good as our previous visits. The oysters were so tiny, the fried scallops were smaller with thicker and harder crust. My girlfriend's uni look dark and not fresh.
HERE COMES THE BEST PART, later that night I stayed up in the restroom for most of the night until the next morning having crazy diarrhea. (at least 6 times)
You may question this may be caused by other food I had other than Hikari, but no, I did not eat anything else yesterday since I woke up late and was expecting for a great AYCE time...
Comparing with what my girlfriend had (she was fine), I had Eel sushi and Yummy rolls that she didn't eat, so I am pretty sure it's either one of them.

Anyway, the service was not pleasant, the food quality dropped, and the food poison was a nightmare (I barely can work at the convention today). It's a shame to say goodbye to one of my favorite place and not coming back again.",8xZLVGMzgIgAMIQeJZNuog,4,1,1,BanuZ93bqUMJ7LDbLqhrJw

Sitting at the sushi bar is a must since service to the tables are not as good. The sushi chefs are attentive to those that sit closest. Always gotta start with raw oysters, hamachi Kama, soft shell crab, sashimi, Ikura with quail egg and the salmon skin salad. Try one combo of the sashimi early on to see what's the freshest so you can order more. As with most all you can eats there's gonna be some type of sashimi fish that tastes better on any given day, this last time the hamachi and salmon were delicious! The salmon skin salad tastes fresh and refreshing but the portion is huge so try to share. Or order at the end so you don't fill your stomach up with salad.

""Remember to eat the rice"" is the main thing we hear, and usually a lot of this places focus on that : Packing the rolls with rice and a little piece of fish. I always hated that about sushi places.always imagined a perfect world with a sashimi AYCE place..and it happened!!

Hikari is the only AYCE sashimi place that ive EVER heard of . The fish quality is great..unlimited UNI? GET OUT OF HERE!!!! yes..I killed so much sea urchin that when Im at the beach they run away from me. Unlimited oyster?? BRING IT ON!!

How they achieve profitability while doing this, I dont know, and i dont care. As long as I keep getting those big pieces of raw delicious fish non stop, I could care less!

Their rolls menu is very limited though. They have just a total of like 6 or 8 , but honestly, why would you get a roll at a sashimi place??

Price is not bad at all, pretty much around the same price as others. Chefs are funny as hell and if you order something it wont take more than 3 minutes LITERALLY to get it. 

I give it 5 stars for uniqueness (only AYCE sashimi) and service.

Although their roles are pretty tasty, I'm more of an appetizer, soup and salad person. The miso and onion soup are both very good. I really like the house dressing they have on the green salad. You can definitely taste the fresh grated ginger in it. My ultimate favorite is their shrimp fried rice. I don't know what ingredients make this Japanese fried rice different than Chinese but it is one of the best fried rice dishes I've ever had. Ialso enjoy their fried scallops (frallops) and fried softshell crab. I love the fact that they have raw oysters as well. We have dozens and dozens of them! Out of the 20 times I've been here I've gotten sick once from these oysters or else it would be a 5 star rating for me.

 Although the rolls have really good quality ingredients and portion are plentiful, it's not as creative as I would like them to be. Just your standard yummy, tiger, spicy tuna, etc. Their Wynn roll is really good though if you're hankering for something different. I would like to see their menu change up a bit. It has been the same for at least 7 years now. There's just so many other AYCE sushi joints nowadays I think it would benefit them greatly.",Tw3_-eahwaTZJjEsos1gpg,0,0,4,sEfH8ktLNLAMDs4QOze2ZQ

Eizer, who is the owner and manager, goes out of his way to greet customers and to go by tables and make sure everything is going well while you're eating. 

They have a full bar with seating @ the bar and couches in the waiting area where you can enjoy a drink if there is a wait. They did away with some of their teppan tables as well and the sushi bar is smaller but table space increased.

The only thing I would change is that very cumbersome menu that is way too complicated and flimsy and it shouldn't be.

I also enjoyed the hamachi kama.  If I went again, I would not order any of the rolls since they seemed to contain a lot of rice.

5918505,2010-09-08,1,E62l6LwZJ7lKaExcUbrtYw,"I was the first patron in the restaurant when I arrived at 6pm Tues., but the place quickly filled up and the sushi bar was soon at 80+% capacity. Patrons are mostly locals w/ some out of towners from listening to random conversations here and there. The sushi bar is just a small part of the overall square footage of the restaurant, as they also have Teppanyaki. By the time I left the restaurant there were quite a few people having teppanyaki dinner, which may actually be the main incentive to visit this restaurant.

Review based on my experience for their AYCE sushi ($26.95 or $29.13 w/ tax). For party of 4 or more, there is an automatic 18% gratuity added to your bill. This is NOT inclusive of any desserts (i.e., green tea or mocha ice cream) which are the norm of the typical AYCE sushi joints in Las Vegas. But Hikari is not your typical AYCE sushi place, since they feature AYCE sashimi (yellowtail, salmon, tuna and snapper).

The sushi chefs are all Japanese or speak Japanese fluently; this also applies to at least some of the waitresses. If your entire party is not doing the AYCE, the sushi chef will communicate what the non-AYCE person is ordering to the waitress in Japanese, for tab keeping purposes. And of course I think if you go to a AYCE place, you SHOULD do the AYCE, since your bill will quickly add up to make it not worth doing the meal √† la carte. And if you think the restaurant is being unreasonable for not allowing you to share food with your non-AYCE buddy/girlfriend, there is a high statistical probability that you are a cheap unreasonable bastard.

Anyway, back to the review.

Service - the waitresses were very good. They are friendly and attentive. When I was done with my plate, it rarely has time to sit idle on the table for long before it is picked up to be washed. Tea refilled regularly. 5 stars.

Sushi Chef - the one that was attending to my orders was good. He asked regularly to make sure I get my orders in while I am still hungry to try more items on their menu. If you are a regular patron, they will remember you by name (based on personal observations).  4-5 stars.

Food - 2.5 stars at best. Overall it wasn't too impressive compared to some of my favorite sushi-ya (√† la carte or AYCE). Sushi rice, Hamachi, salmon, and tuna are good benchmark for comparing the quality of the sushi served at sushi bars. They are the most popular items ordered, should be fresh, and your palette should be able to distinguish if it is good or not. I felt the sushi rice can be prepared and seasoned better. My hamachi nigiri was good, but the tuna served on the sashimi combo was definitely NOT. Salmon was alright. But people seated around me were ordering sashimi combos like it was going out of style, so maybe I had the crappy cut and they were served tuna from a better piece of fish.

Amaebi - I ordered it nigiri-style and the 2 baby amaebi on top of each relatively giant clump of sushi rice were miniscule. Highly recommend ordering it sashimi style, because without wasting rice (AYCE no no) you really can't taste the amaebi.

Super White Tuna - regular or spicy. The fish itself was okay, not the best by any means, but the spicy version supposedly served with spicy garlic jalape√±o was actually made spicy by Sriracha. It wasn't good enough to order my usual seconds.

Ikura and Uni- Acceptable but portions are small. But Uni wasn't AYCE for me.

Caterpillar Roll - I liked it. Not drowned in Eel Sauce like in many other sushi places. If I go back, I would order it again.

Appetizer menu - overall just A-OK. Some items are better than others, and some should just be avoided.

Seafood Tempura - Batter on the thick side, and I really don't think they dusted in tempura flour before dipping it in the tempura batter before frying, because it didn't stick to some of the seafood. Otherwise, it is good enough to recommend.

Agedashi Tofu - Lacking in flavor.

Shumai - Ok, is served steaming hot. But you can tell these were IQF (Individual Quick Frozen) variety sold to food service operations.

Tempura Fried Soft Shell Crab - Served too quickly that I too think it was previously fried and refried again for faster service, sacrificing quality for speed.

Dynamite - Comes out flaming (literally). Good presentation but otherwise not noteworthy for the palette.

Fried Rice (chicken, vegetable or shrimp) - Tried the shrimp version (1/2 order). Overcooked shrimp, the fried rice itself was good, except maybe a touch heavy handed on the soy sauce.

With so many other AYCE sushi places that I enjoy better, I will likely not return, since the big draw for me is the AYCE Uni, which may no longer be AYCE (at least it wasn't for me).

Location - In the SW corner of W. Flamingo and Buffalo inside Flamingo Village Plaza

Parking - Plenty.

Worth the cab fare from the Strip and back? No

Yelp review - 3 stars and it is mostly due to the excellent service and NOT the food.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,3,xBPG4v9K8PmgRMGFDZP54A

Anyway, the sashimi was okay, not high quality, but hey, we didn't get sick and it was AYCE. Can't complain too much. Sushi rolls were sub par as well, and my friend didn't like his dragon roll (said it was dry). The soft shell crab did not have the correct ponzu sauce to go with it, and so my bf didn't like it, though I felt it was fine by itself.

THIS is the place that has made me finally ditch the fears and embrace raw fish!! :)

 (Can't believe my AP Bio teacher Mr. Hendrickson had that long of an effect on me with all his talk of worms and parasites......*shudder*).

Due to this former long-standing fear of consuming sashimi and raw fish in rolls, I now realize that I've missed out for a long time and had only previously ventured to 1 other AYCE establishment.   That one made you have to eat rice with each order of the raw...

 AYCE **sashimi** that tastes YUM and doesn't get you ill?? Does that even exist in LA? I tried many different kinds of raw delights here and enjoyed them all.  Only heard one complaint and that was about the Uni which to me looked really slimy and scary. So, don't order that folks.  Also, the cucumber salad sucked, but all else I ordered or shared from others' plates was quite delicious. 

This place was a little overwhelmed by our larger party and as others previously mentioned, the service was hit and miss.  Orders were lost (and at first, half the table's orders weren't even taken!) and had to be asked about on more than one occasion.  

However, the 4 stars should tell you that it was worth it nonetheless. The waitress tried hard to manage the orders of 9 foodies who DID inundate her with dozens of orders... and the sushi chef who yells out a lot, adorable!  He even came by our table to personally apologize for a lack of smoked salmon and to take a pic with one of our party.
