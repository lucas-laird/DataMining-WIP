818511,2017-12-06,0,MmW1-h6o79XhhO_qutIZ_Q,One of the most apathetic and lethargic Starbucks I have ever visited. I don't know how a purveyor of caffeine beverages can have such glacial service. I have been here for two conferences back to back and it is always this way. A line of less than 15 people took thirty minutes to get through.,NJIfa8eT52qMdei1-wR_FQ,0,0,2,5JmIyxZw8ZG01jn-ygOtLg

Ordered and paid for sugar-free syrup in my coffee drink but when I tasted it (scalding hot btw) it didn't taste how I normally get it any other Starbucks. Asked if they maybe they missed the SF syrup, the employee proceed to tell they are out of the SF product so they just put one pump in of the regular (with sugar) product. Astonished that they thought I wouldn't notice and that was an okay swap?! Had to ask for plain coffee without getting refunded on my up charge for syrup too.
Poor service, poor communication, and poor judgement.",2iUBoXLvmk6prhKWHFJ_jg,0,0,1,6RS4DIhzjBWpPOfiWSoKNA

They have their good and bad days. Sometimes my drink tastes horrible and other days it's exactly right.. they need to be more on it about things! Prices are a little ridiculous, as a hotel employee, I still end up paying $7 for a regular $4 coffee :/",bMUllZks5Vo6ut6NdLRpWw,0,0,3,96rK4yXVTd-zyn5DEuXoCQ
2161518,2017-11-26,0,MmW1-h6o79XhhO_qutIZ_Q,I didn't particularly find the staff all that friendly. There was a big line and only one person manning the register while three other employees where talking in the background not helping.  Also like all other Starbucks they wouldn't do a 50 Cent refill on their coffee like all the other Starbucks. I skip this one but more than likely if you're staying at the Venetian you'll go there anyways.,TLFAUEnBDtZJ8p61L_6IbQ,0,0,1,BSH1JUbNKuQ3_-0y95j62Q
2422091,2018-02-13,0,MmW1-h6o79XhhO_qutIZ_Q,This new Starbucks location at the Venetian/ Palazzo (right by the Sands Convention and Venetian ticket office) is a comforting sight. The space is huge and nicely decorated. The staff is friendly. Nice!,4IZxXA8XxeUXEjNf6yZamw,0,3,4,RWZahGjnv4akDTwp3oC--g

The prices are higher than I'm used to, and I was disappointed to find out they don't accept reward drinks at this location. Otherwise it meets all of the high standards set for the Starbucks brand.",q0UaXV9NnYPkoVOlvCj6cQ,0,1,4,7XfZQZM1j3atG1U_IFHtZw
4660294,2017-12-19,0,MmW1-h6o79XhhO_qutIZ_Q,"Decided to give this place a try even though the rating was 1.5 stars.

The place was nearly empty since it was the Tuesday before Christmas and the hotel is slow.  

A strange thing happened as I walked in.  One of the girls working had some kind of medical issue as she was waiting on a couple of people.  She suddenly went to the back and fainted.  The whole staff understandably went to the back to check on her and call for help. But the manager was able to split the crew to the wait on the customers and  take care of their down teammate.

So down to the review...

The place is pretty big.  Lots of places to sit and relax with a latte and a gingerbread cookie. WiFi is thru the Venetian Palazzo network.  

Couldn't get a good reading on the staff because of the emergency that I talked about earlier. But the staff seems large and if working well together, should be able to deliver orders quickly and keep the place orderly.

So three out of five stars...",BkWkf3QXlBdPEhJOmYflkw,0,0,3,5gmo6evC5dt5ytevUs1q1g

5778735,2017-11-28,2,MmW1-h6o79XhhO_qutIZ_Q,"It's been almost 3 months since they opened, and this location consistently shows that they still don't know how to make Starbucks drinks and that they're totally ok half-assing it. I'm only slightly ashamed to say that I almost always tend to go for the more instagrammable fraps and lattes. If I'm paying $7 for a coffee, I only ask that it's made how it's supposed to be.

We ordered the zombie frap over Halloween, and got a pale green frap with almost white whip vs the magenta it's supposed to be. When I handed it back to them, I couldn't believe the worker told his manager - see she noticed it was the wrong color. Why would you serve something you knew was totally wrong, then act completely put out when I ask you to remake it the right way. 

I heard they kept on a lot of the employees when Cafe Press closed, and maybe that's the biggest problem. Whatever the reason is, don't waste your money here. If you're at Venetian/Palazzo, try one of the other coffee spots - Bouchon Bakery, Illy, Coffee Bean (although they've raised prices to match Starbucks).",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,6,4,2,syuC3l80hCZUwDIe2H3H_g
