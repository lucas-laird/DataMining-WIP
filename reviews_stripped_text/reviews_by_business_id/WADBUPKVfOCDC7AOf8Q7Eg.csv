For lunch I've tried the Tuscan Chicken Panini ($13) and the Tuna Melt ($11). The Tuscan Chicken Panini was good, but I prefer the Tuna Melt over it. The food is perfect if you're on the go.

736154,2015-01-03,1,WADBUPKVfOCDC7AOf8Q7Eg,"Fugg this place! I Was here 12/24/14. Our room wasn't ready yet so we went in to kill time.

I got a latte and slice of banana nut brand. The total came to $9.19. I used my debit card. I added on a $2.00 tip to the bill. So the transaction should have cleared as $11.19. 

A few minutes later I casually checked my account via my phone. I see that they charged me $9.19 AND $11.19. So my card was ran for the original amount AND the amount with the added on tip. Argh

OK so I immediately went back to the counter. The girl said one was a ""ghost"" charge and would for sure drop off. So I was fine with that explanation and let it go. 

On 12/26 both charges cleared my account. Neither charge dropped off. Both were charged to me and cleared. However now the original amount of $9.19 has cleared as $9.26. Nonetheless, I paid $20.45 for one latte and a slice of banana nut bread. Wow. That is some expensive shit. 

I dreaded dealing with this. I hate having to point out monetary mistakes to others like this. But I had my receipt still, so I was hoping the people would be cool and smart enough to quickly and easily remedy the situation. It was just $9.26 too much...but it just didn't sit right with me to just sit back and allow them to double charge me. 

So on the day we were checking out, 12/27, I went down there. The place was packed. But I found someone standing off to the side that I thought I could talk to. Her name was Rosalia. She was very nice. She listened to what happened. She took my receipt and told me she was going to the back to call the manager who wasn't in that day. Fine. She was back there for about 10 minutes. She comes back and tells me that the manager, Jennifer Fur, said it WILL drop off within 48 hours. I kept repeating that this charge was NOT still pending. It had already cleared the day before on the 26th. So there was no way it would just drop off my account. It was past that step. They would need to credit it back to my account. But Rosalia was adamant that it would drop because her manager Jennifer said it would. 

Well, I was checking out. I knew that nothing would be done right then. They were either very sure that I didn't know what I was talking about when I said both transactions had already cleared my account and they really believed the transaction would truly drop off my account OR they were just saying whatever to get my ass out of there. Lol Either way, I left and decided to play along.

Rosalia gave me hers and Jennifer's names and the direct # to Delights and told me if the transaction didn't drop by the following Tuesday, call back and either of them would take care of it.

I got busy this week. I didn't call Tuesday. I just called today, Friday. At first I asked for the manager, Jennifer. Whoever answered said she wasn't in today. So then I asked for Rosalia. She was gone for the day. Great. So I kind of relayed why I was calling. The girl put me on hold for another manager. I waited for 10 minutes on hold...nobody ever came on. So I hung up and called back.

So then the girl tells me she will give me the direct number to the manager's office and puts me on hold again. She comes back...puts me on hold again...comes back again...then puts me on hold AGAIN. Then out of the blue...Jennifer, the manager, picks up. 

Her tone was very much like, ""What do you want bitch?!?!?"" Lol I could tell she didn't give a damn about my situation and just wanted me to go away. 

So she asks me for the check number and a call back number. I give it to her. She calls me back about 15 minutes later with the conclusion that I have already been refunded the original amount and there was nothing for her to do. It was already done.

Hmmmm...interesting....because it's not showing up on my account at all. I have a really good feeling that this is all bullshit and a refund will never show up. But she says I should give it around 3 business days. So I agreed to this. 

At this point, I'm so frustrated because the manager was so damn dismissive. As I said, I highly doubt anything has already been refunded. But if I get shamed and it DOES show up within 3 days, I will change my review. 

But in the meantime, the manager offered no apology. And let's face it, they messed up the transaction somehow. I shouldn't have to pay double for a latte and piece of bread. So apologize to me. Act like you care about customer service!! Is that so hard? I guess so. Because she had an 'I don't give a damn' tone. I shouldn't be made to feel like I'm being petty or a nuisance because I want my refund on some shit YOUR establishment fugged up!!!! WTH??

I'm probably not getting a refund and I'm not calling back. Too much bullshit. But I learned a lesson. Don't use your debit card at Delights. Don't add on a tip if you do use your debit card. And just skip this place and next time, take my ass onto Starbucks down the hall. I could have gotten a better latte for cheaper in a bigger cup.

1435693,2018-03-27,0,WADBUPKVfOCDC7AOf8Q7Eg,"I have been to this place a few times. Really only b/c its convenient when I want a quick bite and don't feel like venturing out for food. I mainly get the beet salad and the kale salad.. You can get 3 salads for $16. They are side salads so not that big. But good if you get 2-3. They are $6 each.

I hadn't been in a while so once again after my workout I needed a quick healthy-fish bite to eat. I must say I am a little disappointed with the salads. They have changed a bit. Now I will say the display are now more accurate with the portions, (I would like to think that's due to my review...lol), however the salads do not taste as good as they did before. 

Let's start with the beer salad.. The beets are cut larger which is cool but not as tender as they were before. Even after I cut up the beets they were still hard.  And all and all just not tastey like it was before. Then there is a lot of big chunks of onions which I feel are not necessary. 

Now for the kale salad. It is suppose to already have the dressing on it, however it was very little I had the dump the salad out and mix it around so that it at least got on most of the kale. And I am not a person who likes a salad drowning in dressing, however,  I do like it coated just enough to taste on every bite  also the kale was not tender at all. I think if it would have had more dressing on it for little long it would have soften it up. The kale wasn't really cut up that much so if you don't like eating g huge leaves then you have to take time to cut it up. Which isn't a problem if you have the time to do so. It's just a less than average salad, it also has a baby carrot in it but only one whole one which I don't understand the purpose of it. And the dressing they have on the kale is very bland.

 So for to have someone of a decent lunch, I mixed the 2 salads together to make one which helped. Other than that it was just ok. I will say I don't know if I will get these salads again and that's sad b/c they were my go to salads.. 
So all in all this place stays a solid 3*s it's not bad place to grab a bite, but it isn't the greatest spot if you have time to venture out and get something to eat.",tLDk3L--YWNMo6XqsSrNSA,0,0,3,WueHcCVqI_qQdGCGnB3HMw

1471574,2008-07-30,0,WADBUPKVfOCDC7AOf8Q7Eg,"Located right outside the elevator of Tower 2 in The Signature (at MGM), the main draw of this place is fast, quality food. The sign right outside of the door drew us in--a truffle cheeseburger sounded delicious. At $17, we thought it would be well worth it.

Here, you order your food Corner Bakery style. Then they give you a number and you wait for them to bring your food. Well, we started off with the cheese tortellini salad. It tasted decent, but was expecting more flavor from it. At the same time, we ordered the truffle cheeseburger, a ham and brie panini and the soup of the day which happened to be mushroom soup.

A long stretch of time passes by, about 30-35 minutes. Luckily, we had the salad to hold us over. To our surprise, our lunches came out first. We weren't particularly impressed with the sandwich as there was too much ham, and slightly a little brie. It tasted ordinary if you ask me. I then got the burger. The fries looked great--I think they were sprinkled with a little parmesan. Anyhow, after I took my first bite, the table noticed that my medium burger was anything but that. It was generally all pink inside and very unsuitable to eat. In retrospect, looking at the photo I took (see photos), you can see part of the bun is bloody!

We asked a server to come by to take a look and she seemed unfamiliar with how it should appear. We also took this time to ask our soup that never arrived. The waitress comes back and takes our semi eaten burger back to the restaurant. At this point, I am thinking, something MUST be comped.

As we are sitting there, a burger was served to another fellow who arrived way after we had. At last my burger comes, and its only decent. There is only a hint of truffle flavor in the burger (it was all in the mayo) but aside from this uniqueness, the rest of the burger was just your standard fare, nothing special about it. After these were all eaten up, our soup came out and we didn't get to truly appreciate it.

The bottomline... the hotel itself is very nice, too bad that it didn't expand into the doors of the hotel's deli. If you are going to serve me raw meat, I am going to expect something more than just a hello.",bW6VMyB5r05Yze44Ora0pA,0,0,1,dcQ6672yo3mZX_9tdgeEKw

1741290,2012-01-28,6,WADBUPKVfOCDC7AOf8Q7Eg,"***Delights' breakfast BLT was nothing exceptional and it was also not gourmet despite the gourmet price, but it was a satisfying enough quick breakfast at The Signature in the MGM Grand***

Delights Gourmet Delicatessen is a little quick order sandwich spot in The Signature area of the MGM Grand.  Because of its location in The Signature, Delights feels a little tucked away and not your typical Vegas spot--not overwhelmingly busy, very far from the smoke and spacious.  They feature breakfast and sandwiches as well as a few lighter options like parfaits and fresh fruit.

I had the breakfast BLT, which consisted of a fried egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on sourdough toast.  Their breakfast BLT did not compare with breakfast BLT or BLT-esque sandwiches at Nickel Diner (great sauce, great bread, leafy arugula) or Huckleberry (very good runny egg, thick and meaty bacon), but Delights' breakfast BLT was still satisfying.

All of the ingredients were good.  The sandwich had a good flavor.  The bacon was not the best quality, but it was crispy and flavorful.  The lettuce was crisp and the mayo provided a creaminess to the sandwich.  The sourdough toast was a little thin, but it was still decent.  Overall, it was a pleasant though not exceptional breakfast sandwich.

The sandwich came with a side of fruit, which was just okay.

Service was quick.  Prices were high.  The sandwich was $12.  I would expect to pay that much (and maybe even a little less) for a gourmet sandwich and Delights' version was definitely not up to the standards of what they serve at Huckleberry (which is actually less than $10).  Still, it is Vegas and food tends to be overpriced; for Vegas, the price was not too unreasonable considering the portion size.

Delights is an okay spot.  While overpriced, it is still nice to have a decent enough breakfast in Las Vegas for under $15.  While Delights is probably not a place where I would make a return visit, I would consider coming here again if I was in a hurry, in the area and in need of a quick bite.

signature scramble- really attractive plating for this dish. The food was okay but I still enjoyed it. The scrambled eggs were slightly overcooked, but the dryness was saved by the salsa added underneath.

Located inside the Signature MGM hotel, there's a small cafe that serves delicious sandwiches and other delights. Service was average.

I usually visit this place during convention so it gets pretty busy. Their items are on the pricey side but again, this is Vegas.

My favorite item so far is the blackened chicken sandwich. It comes warmed up with a side dish and a pickle. I tried the coleslaw which was drenched in the sauce so I decided to get a bag of chips the second time around. My co-workers would order the pizza and they say it's delicious. They also have a variety sandwiches with eggs, a small alcoholic selection of drinks, and snacks to purchase located along the wall.

This place earns the name 'gourmet deli'. While the menu is tight, the sandwich combos are well thought out. The prices? Not great. Am I against $10 egg sammies? Sure. But when it's the Melrose Avenue (scrambled egg whites, sliced avocado, fire-roasted diced tomatoes, mushrooms & turkey bacon in a whole wheat wrap), you can look past the inflated price tag. Also, an $8 chili better be the best chili ever...and it kinda was. Not your average heavy, oiled up sloppy joe in a bowl, this was more of a Manhattan clam, meets minestrone, meets vegetarian chili and it was damn good. The Chinese chicken salad was decent, but probably a skip the next time around. 

My suggestion? Come here (if you're in the area) for HH, where the pizzas are half price and the brews are $2.50. Staying at the Signature? Don't hesitate to have a few meals here when you're in a rush. Nothing on the menu is over $12.",NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw,2,2,4,IC2lSEd8L9d92XnGgEyvAQ

This morning we came down and ordered breakfast and were served tater tot's. I eat gluten-free. I cannot eat tater tot's. 

My Huevos rancheros was served with ice cold cheese, and ice cold pepper, something that resembled refried beans, I'm not sure what it was because I didn't eat it, a big pile of tater tot's and an overcooked egg. 

My husband ordered a $14.00 Denver omelette, it is not on the menu but they say they can make omelettes. I was told they don't have peppers for the omlette...whaaaat? What about the cold pepper served with my Huevos Rancheros? Go figure that one. 

I returned my breakfast informing them that I cannot eat tater tot's because I have to eat Gluten Free foods. They remade my breakfast and omitted the corn tortilla. Newsflash chef! Corn tortillas are gluten-free. My second breakfast also arrived with ice cold cheese, and ice cold pepper, and over cooked egg, something that resembled refried beans and no tortilla.

By the time I received my second breakfast my husband was almost finished eating his tasteless rubbery scrambled eggs which I assume were poured out of a container. The eggs sucked so badly that my dogs would not even eat them.

After frequenting the MGM Food Court more times than I would like, my sister suggested we go by the MGM Signature.  Yes, because this is place is located at the Signature, the cafe is a bit of a walk from most things in the MGM.  However, if you are looking for something healthy and fresh, Delights is the way to go.

One of the drawbacks was that their menu is not super extensive.  They carry your typical sandwiches, skillets, pasta, and juices.  Here are a few things that I tried:

Soup of the Day (Minestrone): Coming out piping hot and seasoned well, the minestrone for me was the perfect complement to my egg sandwich.  The minestrone had a slightly sweet flavor from the stewing of the vegetables.  I enjoyed the hearty sized pieces of the beans that makes a minestrone classic.  Plus, I appreciated the fact that the noodles came out al dente telling me that they weren't serving soup with pasta that had been sitting there for hours.

Melrose Avenue:  Not super flavorful but a good solid healthy choice.  Compared to most of the other options, the Melrose has perhaps the least interesting combinations but still I enjoyed the warm scrambled egg whites paired with the creamy sliced avocado and the diced tomatoes and cooked mushrooms.  In terms of flavor, it mainly came from the salty turkey bacon which also added a nice crisp for some crunch. 

In terms of service, the staff was friendly but a little on the slow side.  I guess they are cooking the items to order so it does require some more time than your typical fast food fare.  Access to the Signature is limited from the MGM side so be careful about the hours.

Overall, I would recommend Delights especially if you are looking for a MUCH better alternative to the food court options at MGM.",CdKvRVLHbX3pokKhj96X0w,5,3,4,GIBCSafY55M55g6FCpsUUg

It's an ok spot for a quick bite. Inside or for take out. They have a broad selection of breakfast and lunch. I know they also sell alcholic beverages and things like pizza. Don't know if they offer diner. But then again: who wants that in Vegas? The ambiance isn't that nice.

Last time we we're tired of the Starbucks and didn't fancy the pool menu. Tried it a day earlier and were very dissapointed. So Delights was the only options on walking distance. Ordered an orange juice, scrambled eggs and an espresso for take out. Not very special, but more than ok. Service is pretty quick, everything is nicely packed and all condiments are in the bag.

4156545,2018-05-29,0,WADBUPKVfOCDC7AOf8Q7Eg,"While vacationing in Vegas this past Memorial day weekend ended up doing a lot of drinking and bad eating so decided to eat something decent  for a change. This cozy/intimate spot is located in the MGM Signature tower 2 just behind the lobby area.

The inside is cozy but you also have the option to sit outside and eat just beware of the bird's. They are very ruthless and will descend on your food without regards. The place is deli style with the menu hanging from above the counter with breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner options. The prices are a bit steep but hey it's Vegas right? You gotta pay to play and food is no different. 

I ordered the breakfast sampler which comes with eggs, choice of meat, choice of toasted bread and home fries. I received a number and you wait as your food is brought out to you. The wait wasn't long maybe a good five to ten minutes. I was able to food snoop at other people's plates to see what they had and every plate looked and smelled fantastic! I couldn't wait for my food.

I received my plate of poached eggs (over easy), wheat toast, chicken sausage and home fries. The portions looked good but could have been more for the price. In a bowl there where at least three poached eggs, two chicken sausages, 2 slices of toast and probably a scoop of potatoes. The meal was actually excellent and besides my eyes being bigger than my stomach I was quite satisfied not really full but content. I guess that's ok to not gain the dreaded ""vacation weight"". Only complaint I truly had was my eggs had two things going on. I asked for over easy poached eggs which they were cooked hard and at the base of the bowl was this liquid. It wasn't till from the eggs because they were hard it looked like unused yolk from another batch of eggs. So I fished out and drained the eggs off and put em on my plate. The potatoes were hands down the best! Special salute for having tabasco sauce available because on those eggs and potatoes they went up 10 notches. Also I didn't have hot sauce in my bag swagg lol.

This is a cool spot if your looking for a quick decent bite to eat while staying at the signature and don't feel like traveling. Good for family, date, relaxing, friends. The price is expensive so look to pay at least $15 for a meal. The food is worth it!

If you order without toast, they'll give you two servings of fruit. 

They also have things you can pick up and go, like bottles of wine and snacks. Be warned: the prices are pretty outrageous. I think a small bottle of San Pelligrino was 4 or 5 bucks. The SMALL one!

For the 3 salads, I got corn and bean, roasted beets, and the 3 bean quinoa. I loved them all. My only only only complaint about the salads is that they add oil. Maybe there's a reason for it but I could do without it. I think oil tames a lot of the natural flavors. My ultimate favorite is the beets because they added celery which makes it taste and feel like a potato salad but without potatoes. I loved the flavors. Again, minus the oil.
