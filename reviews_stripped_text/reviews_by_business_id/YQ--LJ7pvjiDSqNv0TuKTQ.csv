29444,2015-01-14,0,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"The plan for the day was to sashay the Strip. So all of my friends that hadn't been here before suggested to walk from one end to the other. Thank goodness we did because we decided to eat at this pizza spot first.

We arrived around 11 am and a line had already formed to eat this famous pizza, but the line moved pretty quickly and our party of nine didn't have to wait longer than 20 minutes. The cool thing is that this restaurant is located in the Fashion Show Mall, so I can window shop.

The pizzas were a good size, we ordered three large pies. 1) The classic Margherita 2) White pizza (no tomato sauce) with garlic and mushrooms 3) Tomato sauce based pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, and olives

All pizzas were good, with a thin crust and not too soggy. My personal favorite was the white pizza. So simple yet very flavorful! I wouldn't say this is the best pizza I have ever had but it's definitely something you should try.

Expect your experience to be quick, we ordered the pizzas and were in and out in less than an hour. You'd have to expect a quick dining experience especially if a line is waiting outside.",XHSG6sp-QnW5TSLgeYHm9Q,0,0,4,qaT-FJBz2ZxxIOFsJguRtQ

Pizza is hardly what one thinks of when out to Vegas what with the plethora of buffets, and star-studded chef restos. But Grimaldi's is the little pizzeria that could. Why don't you come out West young Man, I know you would be a starh Baby!

Serious, Grimaldi's got chops and since they are now in the Palazzo it's a lot easier to get a pie fix. I opted for the calzone this time and of course I wasn't disappointed the only gripe (and it's minor) is that the cost of the extras on a calzone IMHO is a tad over-priced.

Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a welcome addition to the strip, with its affordable prices and authentic pizza pies you can't go wrong!  They have a simple menu and a great ambiance, it looks like a little slice of NY (but cleaner) right here in Vegas.  The menu is basically the toppings that you can choose from as well as the sauce (try not to go over 3 items on the pizza cause then the crust gets a little soggy), then they have a couple salads and of course cannolis and dessert to round out the menu for good measure.  Now the desserts/cannolis are really good, the salads, leave a bit to be desired.  The service that I have personally received has been pretty good, and of course the pizza itself is great!

This is the ideal spot if you are looking to fuel up before the club or just to get a casual bite with your significant other.  The pizza is New York style, meaning its thin and crispy.  The sizes are hearty so a personal can feed two people and a large can feed 3-4 guys.  Their pizzas all taste really fresh and are made to order... you can even watch the chef throw the pizza dough in the air.  Their salads are also really good and their small salads are definitely shareable.  The decor is a cross between an old school italian joint and a BJs restaurant.

420693,2015-08-30,4,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"I was spending a lovely weekend in Vegas with some friends. After a night of moderate drinking we woke up to a feeling of utter agony. Our drunken state had turned into a hangover of the melancholy variety. Not even the freshest melons of Las Vegas could tame this horrid feeling. But wait, perhaps a small glimmer of hope. In the early 15th century, The Italians, with their delightful ingenuity, discovered a cure for this absolute evil of feelings brought on by the mishaps of the previous evening. Pizza. Let me say that word again as the words tend to drop from my lips like a melted cheese slowly slides off the beautiful dough disc from whence it started. PIZZA. 

We all decided to give Grimaldis pizza a chance to wow us. It is located inside the palazzo hotel and casino. If you find yourself having trouble finding the place, you could always ask any one of the friendly people sauntering around the casino pretending to look busy. Be warned, however, as the directions given will not put you at your destination due to the fact that these fine folks here at the palazzo haven't a clue as to where anything is, or even their current surroundings in general. 

After traversing the second level, making our way through the parodies and disparaging mockery of the Italian culture, we finally made our way to the darkest corner where the pizza parlor resides. We approach the portly white gentleman behind the podium, and after a long awkward stare he asks how many of us there are. The four of us look at each other for a moment and respond with a stern ""four."" After we established the amount of people that were standing in front of the dull young fellow, he then proceeded to inform us of news that we still to this day have never quite recovered from. Apparently, 4:00 pm pacific time is when this pizzeria begins their cleaning regimen. We were told that their ovens, of which the pizzas are prepared in, were being cleaned and would not be available for over an hour. This was the initial downfall of this establishment and, in my heated state of emotion, I was prepared to give a one star review for this folly. However, I remained diplomatic and decided to wait until I got the full experience. 

We returned approximately 47 minutes later and much to my surprise, there was a new host. He sat us and told us he didn't know who our server would be, but someone would serve us. At this point an overwhelming wave of concern came over me. If the first two employees were showing this kind of incompetence, what could we expect with our server. Here is where things started to finally turn around...

Our affable waiter approached the table with an absolute jovial disposition. His friendly mannerisms were out shined only by his knowledge of the handful of items listed on the barren menu. The appetizers consisted of a variety of unsatisfying salads. We decided not to waste our time with such trivial cuisine and went straight to ordering our grease pies. Three of the four party members order 12"" personal pizzas. The fourth decided to go with a calzone. Each topping cost hundreds of pennies, however due to the fact we were currently residing in Vegas, we decided to splurge. I requested a pizza consisting or pepperoni and standard breakfast bacon. Food was exceptional. Taste buds were tickled to a heavenly state. After receiving our food, we did not see our waiter again. 

As for some things I may have left out, I'd like to rate separately as follows:

Service: Mediocre at best, not much to see here in terms of quality. One friendly face and kooky demeanor out of a staff of twenty sub par employees was not a saving grace. 

Decor & Ambiance: A tad blasé for my tastes. Atmosphere left a lot to be desired. 

Food quality & Taste: May have been the saving grace, at the very least preventing me from giving a less than reputable one star rating. 

Overall experience: I'd prefer to rate a 2 1/2 stars for my overall experience, however it's an impossibility so I landed on a 3 star rating. Would only recommend if an absolute last resort or if a deranged captor is holding you at gunpoint and demands you feed him a lackluster slice of pizza.",6lkvWbexKiLP6skyVT6Llg,2,2,3,inXO2CKY3FlxWAHglY-3Nw

It's thin crust pizza from a chain restaurant. 

Claim to fame is the coal burning oven.

This particular location is in the mall. 

If you've ever lived in NYC, you'll wonder what the fuss is about. 

If you've ever lived in Chicago, you'll complain that the pizza is paper thin. 

They have pizza and beer, how can you go wrong - so long as the pizza is hot and the beer is cold, it's just fine.

They have TVs inside, they email coupons for your birthday if you sign up on the website, they aim to please.

I expect a renowned and highly regarded place such as Grimaldi's to be superb in all respects, especially being located in a place such as The Palazzo.

Our large thin New York style meatball, mushroom and fresh garlic pizza took around 40-45 mins to come out after we had to ask the waitress when we could expect it.  By the time it got to us it wasn't hot.  Barely lukewarm.  When I started on my second slice it was all cold (4-5 mins later).  A Chicago style deep dish pizza doesn't even take this long to make.  

We asked for a side of marinara and it's been almost 10 mins and still nothing.  So we gave up and just asked for the check.

As a side note they were NOT busy.  Barely a handful of costumers.

587662,2014-12-05,0,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"Short: Overpriced, nothing special pizza. You'll find better at Sam's Club or Costco.

Long:

For the most part, the pizza here is no better than what you'll find at Pizza Hut or Dominoes. Tasteless crust, cheap sauce, cheap and skimpy toppings with a tiny bit of cheese. There's only better quality control (how little quality there is) and better service. There's also no specialty pizzas here; just the same toppings you can get anywhere else, you just have to list out what you want. I was really hoping for a margarita pizza, but you won't find one here.

I'm a big pizza fan and I often make my own pizza. So when a friend of mine got a birthday deal to have one free pizza from this place, we visited. We arrived and was ushered over to a table. The waitress and waiters were nice, but a bit too courteous as every-other-minute they were checking on us. You don't need three waiters to refill water people. 

We ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. It took a while to come out, but not too long. When it arrived, we noticed the top was just swamped with juice and oil--this became a problem as the pizza became soggy after a few minutes (so I don't recommend ordering out).

The pizza... was acceptable. That's it. Me and my friend found ourselves piling on parmesan cheese and oregano to get some flavor out of the pizza because it didn't have much. Let me break it down:

Good pizza starts at the dough. The bread/crust on this pizza was dull and tasteless. After a while, half of it got soggy. The only good part was the end crust where the over charred it a bit. HOWEVER, this place is suppose to be coal-fired, right? Well, the bottom of the crust was no crispier or better cooked than elsewhere. It wasn't even thin enough to create a cracker-thin crust. I've had proper coal-fire pizza and this place is a joke compared to the real thing. 

The sauce is a water-down, flavor-less tomato sauce. 

The cheese they put on it, while are slices of mozzarella, are so thin that it doesn't melt nor does it spread out. It's just wavers of cheese that don't give the pizza any flavor.

The toppings are the next joke. The mushrooms were of good size (not the thin sliced version), but the sausage is the frozen/ball sausage every-other pizza joint uses. Nothing special, nothing unique. The same frozen sausage balls.


In the end, I don't recommend this place. I am dead honest about the Sam's Club and Costco thing; they make better pizza and sell it at half the price! HALF THE PRICE! This place is almost a joke after I list everything out, but it's certainly isn't bad. I didn't get sick, I didn't walk out unhappy, but surely I would be pissed if I had paid $20 for that pizza. The birthday deal is worth trying this place, though.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,0,0,2,-ECO15mgXJ9D34RLj4Wnpw

The chicken, however, was definitely packaged / not fresh. It didn't match with the delicious fresh ingredients that made up the rest of the pizza.

Desert was also outstanding. We had the desert trio (you get to pick which 3, which I loved!) and got the caramel apple cheesecake, oreo cheesecake, and tiramisu.

Im going to admit that I am stupid. I keep falling for the hype and I'm constantly getting punished with bad food.

I've given up on trying to find good pizza in CA. Many of my friends said that Grimaldi's the shiz but it's in vegas. You know that saying about whatever happens in vegas? This pizza should never leave vegas. Grimaldi's, stay put because your pizza is fraudulent. You do not serve ""NYC style pizza"", you serve a sub par version of the same thing I can get at a pieology franchise and it's waaaaaaay less expensive. Pieology also labels their pizza properly. Grimaldi's, you serve neopolitan style and you do it poorly.

Once the pizza arrived at our table, just looking at it, I was already disappointed. It was burnt, not browned. The sauce looked like it just came straight out of a BPA lined can. 

When i took my first bite, I noticed that it was under seasoned and that blaring red sauce was way too acidic. Have these cooks ever heard of using sugar to cut down on the acid? WTF, this is amateur sh*t people! This is pizza sauce 101. I made a better pizza with a boboli crust when I was a kid and I didn't even know what the f*ck I was doing back then.

Also, I have never had a pizza turn my hands black. Yes, my hands were black. (See napkin picture)

This place is a bust. Over priced. Over hyped. The odds will be against you. The ""pizza"" only lives up to the first part of its namesake, ""Grim"".",7nJwOtNHfgZotBBq7n1ecg,1,0,1,749CmI90FeK8O3MkgC4QQQ

This is my 3rd time at Grimaldi over the past year (i sadly went twice in the mall and once in the palazzo location). Even the soda each time was 99% ice and a sip of coke, it was like drinking flavored water. Please don't make my same mistake and tell them NO ICE if you want to have a taste of soda.

The tomato sauce it is flavorless, so you will see people adding salt like crazy to try to revive a cardboard tasting pizza. The cheese taste like rubber, flavorless as well. The dough is bad but not as bad as the tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. 

Do not believe brick oven and this gimmick terminology they use. Brick oven means the oven is made with brick, it doesn't mean wood burning oven. So basically brick oven doesn't mean anything.

One last issue is that for some reason the pizza has been each time barely warm and after you eat the second slice the rest of the pizza will be cold. Just be prepared.

Grimaldi's seemed to be a decent place so we decided to check it out. We were sorely disappointed. so many things were not quite right at Grimaldi's. Number one for me was that they put tomato sauce on their Marguerita pizza. I would have had that pizza but for that. Anyone who knows pizza knows that that is a no-no on a Marguerita. Second, coal-fired ovens? It might be cheaper to run coal-fired ovens but a wood-fired oven imparts a far better flavour into the pizza. Onto the food itself. I ordered a white 12"" pizza with anchovies and black olives, my wife, one of their 12"" garden pizzas. To top them off we ordered a bowl of salad to share. The salad came out first and it was nice and fresh, had a nice vinaigrette dressing and a few additions. Could have done with a bit more of the additions, they were a bit sparse. The pizzas arrived and they were crispy on the edges and a bit doughy in the middle. Probably could have done with another 30 seconds or so in the oven. My pizza was okay but nothing to write home about, I could find probably get as good a pizza in my local Dominos (if not better on a good night!). My wife's pizza was not good at all. She had to sprinkle both parmesan (which she said was an inferior type of) and salt on the pizza to get any flavour out of it and said that the toppings were extremely bland and lacked any flavour at all.

 First of the Caeser salad was freaking AMAZING! the large was big enough to be shared by four people and have enough to get seconds for everyone. The Caprese was alright, what threw me off is the basil they were using. Either its gone bad and that's why its such a dark green or I've never tasted real basil before. Anyways, the large pizza was more than enough for four people. My mother & father in law were saying that the sausage had a little kick to it so my 5 year old sister in law couldn't/wouldn't eat it. Other than that, I thought it was alright. Never really tasted an ""authentic"" pizza so I don't have much to go off on. Now the dessert ... EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!

We ordered a small pizza to share for two people. I think the water they used really makes a difference in the dough, because it wasn't as good as what I had in NYC. The first slice was good, but after the pizza has been sitting there, it starts to get soggy and kinda gross at the bottom. 

It's in a nice location (it's inside the Palazzo hotel right by the entrance of the hotel where the connecting overpass for the Wynn and Palazzo is), and if you get seated in the back of the restaurant, you'd have a pretty nice view of the Wynn and Encore hotels outside.They also incorporated some of the NY touches with the brick walls and subway signs inside, but pizza is still not the same as the real deal.",WitFlyNa-15i96s_qFnl0w,2,0,3,kA1Mjx7G4MyfSlHFoj1lDg

This was second.  Half Don and half kalamata olive pie add basil all over.  

Pie was cooked right, thin crust New York style pie.  Crispy bottom crust, good ratios of fresh mozz and just the right amount of sauce.  Came out hot, just the way I like it. 

First, the Don.  Basically a meat lovers with pepperoni, sausage and meatballs.  Proteins were generous but didn't have as much flavor as I would've liked.  

Now the kalamata olive and basil half. 

MOTHER OF GOD.  

Perfection on a pie.  I know it doesn't sound that great, but seriously, just try it.  I had huge reservations about a pie with no proteins as well when a Long Islander recommended it to me, but it is soo money and you don't even know it.",xFuV3LEXljGwfHRm1DhU_g,0,0,5,fU2Sn3bJZ4amIOo-73M_WA

1. Quality of food - The pizza was good. I would say it is 3.5 stars. The edge was quite burn, but that happens sometimes. The crust was really good. The cheese was a little strange how it cooked, maybe it was the type of cheese that was on it...not sure. 

2. Service - We were seated in the patio area. The bartender was the server for the entire patio area. He seemed stretched a little thin managing both and he seemed to be outside his comfort zone waiting tables. 

3. Alcohol/Bar - We did not order alcohol, but the two tables next to us did & this is based on overhearing them. Both tables ordered cocktails & both were unhappy with the quality. They both mentioned it to the server (not aware he was the one who made them) & he awkwardly apologized, but didn't offer to mend the problem in any way. One of the tables ordered a beer that was on tap to supplement the poor tasting cocktail & when the drink arrived, the glass was a little over half full. Based on my ease dropping ;) I would not come here for the alcohol.

The ovens are even hotter than wood fire and that results in an even better dough. They make pizza the correct way, without too much cheese and a balanced sauce (not too sweet).

I love Grimaldis in NY, in LA, and now in Vegas. 

The pizza is always consistent! 
The crust is perfect (currently slightly drooling thinking about such amazing carbs), not to mention the melted mozzarella, and the ever so slightly tangy, yet somehow spicy but well-seasoned marinara. 

Hungry yet? 

I know I am. 

I prefer the large pizza because its your best bang for the buck. 
This pizza is killer the next day! 
My personal favorites are the chicken sausage, jalapenos (ask them to go easy because they're HOT), and mushrooms. 

Done, and done. 

I could go on forever and paint the perfect picture of this pizza but seriously you'd waste too much time reading my review when you should just be eating there already!

Also, the spinach salad is a must as well, just make sure to tell them no bacon. It'll mess with your palate otherwise. 

Either way I think I'll have pizza now!

Grimaldi's is known for their spongy sweet crust from their coal ovens.  They also have some great tomato sauce.  They have 5 locations in Las Vegas.  Of the 3 locations I've been to, this yielded the best pizza.

The other reason to come here is that it's high quality food for a cheap price.  I got a nice glass of Peroni beer for $5 and my personal Pizza for $10.

I haven't been to their original Brooklyn location, so i'm not sure how true they stay to their original recipe. However, I do know good pizza when I taste it and Grimaldi's in Las Vegas is excellent. 

The pizza at Grimaldi's is prototypical NY style pizza with a thinner crust. The crust is thin and airy, but still maintains its structural integrity without being bogged down by toppings. In addition to the traditional red sauce, you have the option of getting white garlic or pesto pizza. Our group of 4 shared 2 large (18  inch) pizzas, one traditional and one white garlic. My favorite pizza was the red sauce meatball pizza. It was addictive. I wasn't as big of a fan of the white garlic pizza. 

Surprisingly, I don't believe there is any price inflation at this Las Vegas location and the prices are similar to other Grimaldi's. It is actually pretty affordable in comparison to other sit-down restaurants on the strip. A large pizza is $16 and consists of 8 slices. Toppings are extra and run you $2-4 each.

We also ordered a large salad to share and a few beers. We ended up paying around $25  each, which was a steal since we were all stuffed afterwards. Grimaldi's is a definitely a good option if you're looking for a casual, low-key sit-down restaurant on the strip that does not break the bank.",8Ni1MmORWyvW0lJHJiqiQg,0,0,4,ggBeW7xJ_sBmJBG3Sld4Kw

I read that they bake their pizza using brick ovens, but with a special kind of coal called ""anthracite"" which is a more premium coal because it has a high carbon content and few impurities. 

& since they originated in NYC and wanted to bring the same flavor to other cities, they do not use our water system here in the LV valley- instead they use the NYC water pumping system installed in every location to bring that flavor here. 

First I will say, that the service at this location was a little below what I'm used to, normally get my pizza lightly cooked on the crust, because they normally bring it out a a little charred. I requested it but still got the charred crust. :(  If you like a little buttery crust, I recommend asking for it lightly cooked. 

We order our pizza with basil (you can get it baked on top or after baking, so it's still ""raw,"" with pepperoni, and with italian sausage. Extra toppings of course cost a little more. 

I haven't tried their desserts yet, since this location is in the palazzo, Bouchon bakery is soo close. So I ran right over there. :P

After striking out at a few other places on Friday night, we remembered that smell and followed our noses.  It turned out to be a pretty good idea.  

Pizzas are cooked to order in a wood-fired pizza oven.  It has standard Italian pizzeria decor and they can accommodate fairly large groups, as there are some bigger tables there.  Plus most of the seats have a pretty good view of the bridge entrance of the Palazzo. 

The basic large pizza is what you get for a flat fee, and then each topping is a couple extra dollars.  If you keep it simple, it is very affordable.  Like a proper pizza, everything is thin crust. They only have traditional toppings, like pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, et cetera - you won't find any pineapples here!

The cheese is real pieces of fresh mozzarella, not shredded generic cheese.  So you won't have complete cheese coverage, but it will be great.  The salads you can order are also family style and fairly large.  They are worth it.

Suddenly on trips to various cities, I was surprised to see the brick and mortar locations popping up everywhere. I dont know why I am surprised to see it in Vegas- where all well known restaurants tend to franchise and take hold. While Grimaldi's was not on the official eating agenda, we were in Vegas on Easter and it was one of the only places on our side of the strip that was open.

I wish I was not hungover and having a very rough morning- I know this is delicious pizza and would have liked to enjoy it more. Instead, I chewed on the bland complimentary bread and took nibbles at my crust and some of the marinara sauce. It was proclaimed as amazing pizza by my friends, who fared the morning better than I. I remembered it as such, and since I think they did a great job in replicating the NYC original- here's 4 stars to those more sober memories of Grimaldi's!",EMMKdK1cGrLSo08wgSYHJQ,2,2,4,UYycDfCp0W6SJ3rRDu8dPw

My group ordered a large 18in. pizza with the following: Tomato sauce, parmesan cheese, kalamata olives, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and roasted red peppers.

The hearty topping provided great flavors to the pizza; while the thin crust provided a great crunchy texture.

The way they baked the thin crust was well balanced. Portions of the crust were crunchy, while other portions were slightly softened by the moist topping.

Overall, a great casual pizzeria that is more than able to fulfill one's pizza cravings.",AQvdQADQzM7NLLdg88feUQ,1,1,4,kgWokvnyOr8go4NfYHL-jQ

Sat down and they took away my wine glass. I guess they thought I was under 21. I guess I'll take it as a compliment? :)

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Choose a pizza size and type. 
We got a large 18in. pizza with white garlic sauce: $18
2. Add desired toppings (about $2 each)
We added pepperoni, sausage, and ham: $6

TOTAL COST: 
$24 for a HUGE pizza which made for 8 slices and 4 happy people. 

I'm not much of a pizza person, I'll eat the toppings/cheese, the crust and then throw the rest away (I know... such a waste) but I think the dough to toppings ratio is way too much for most pizzas. I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this satisfied my pizza cravings without leaving anything behind. One of the best thin crust pizzas I've ever had.

If you're dying to try the one in New York, I would say go to this one and check it out. Pretty comparable even though the one in NY is slightly better, probably because of the long line you have to wait in haha",BxViEOHLUmwNZkn_J4A3RQ,0,0,5,8nAoioqlZzEdK3PSUGUuRQ

Grimaldi's is located in the Palazzo it can be a little tricky to get here it is at the end of the hotel and if anybody has been to the Venetian or the Palazzo they know that you need a map to navigate the entire property it's huge. 

Me and my three friends we came here for dinner before we went out to hit the club. We called ahead of time to make reservations the girl at the reservation counter said that we didn't need reservations but I'm a Steffler want to comes to that stuff and I insisted that we had reservations. When we arrived I told the host that we had reservations for four and my last name and she seem to have no idea what I was talking about. But she said us promptly. 

Our waiter was absolutely incredible he knew the entire menu by memory he had great recommendations and selections for us he also came back to fill our drinks up and water consistently I wish I could remember his name but he was fantastic. 

Being from New York I am really really picky when it comes to Pizza. The atmosphere reminded me of home there was all these old New York signs on the wall and photos really cool. They did a good job replicating the store is close to the one in New Jersey. There's a huge fire oven in the middle of the location. The smell inside here is incredible. 
So with Grimaldi's what we're talking about is a really thin crust pizza super crispy a sweeter tomato sauce and you get that wood coal-fired flavor with a little burn on the edge of a crossed in my opinion that makes the pizza that's the flavor is that Burnt crust

My buddy is from New Jersey and he wanted to get the white garlic pie. We started with the white garlic pie and then we also ordered a meat lovers pizza which had sausage pepperoni ham and bacon. The pizza was absolutely incredible. After eating both of the pizzas we decided to order a small calzone which a small calzone is probably the size of a large add any kind of pizzeria it's enough to feed four people. We just got a Ricota and ham
. The calzone was excellent. 

The nice thing about them all these is that the prices are insane. You can have a good taste for a meal that simple and does not break the bank for four people and that's what I think is special. 

If anyone is from the East Coast and you're looking for a good solid pizza place from all these is definitely a top choice is it the same as the location in New Jersey no but they do their best interpretation to replicate it and you know what being 2000 miles away they do a pretty good job at it.

It had weird blobs of something unattractive (not sure if it was the sauce or the garlic we got on the pizza) that made it difficult to want to eat the whole pizza.

I know, I'm pretty picky about how my pizza is sauced, haha, but really, this was the best combo.. I don't think I would have liked it as much with only one sauce.

Oreo Cheesecake (3.5 stars): Oreo is always amazing, but I liked the strawberry better. 

Strawberry Cheesecake (4 stars): You could really taste fresh strawberry flavor.

Tiramisu (3 stars): I'd stick to the cheesecakes.

1876997,2013-02-03,5,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"TL:DR - Food Poisoning

So on a recent business trip to Las Vegas I visited this restaurant twice. First time was on a Thursday night and the restaurant was extremely slow.  Only 3 tables in use in the restaurant.  It took over an hour to get one pizza and we never had a chance to order more drinks because nobody ever came to check on us.  When I asked about our order the manager apologized and the pizza was out in 10 minutes.... About the time it takes to make and bake a pizza. Still didn't see out waiter until he dropped the check at the end without so much as an apology. The pizza was amazing. The best pizza and worst service I have ever had. 

I went back about a week later on my last night in vegas with a coworker. I explained my previous experience with the service and this time was much better.  The next morning I woke up to head to the airport for my flight and the tell tale signs of food poisoning reared their ugly head. Flying with food poisoning is one of the worst experiences I have ever had.  I am 100% sure of the source of the food poisoning as I only ate one thing on that day... Grimaldis pizza with a caprese salad. The salad is likely to be the culprit but to have two horrible experiences in a 2 week time period is inexcusable. I suggest avoiding this spot at all costs.",YHTe3A9WujMG9EAPSfpxEQ,1,0,1,RWpN1cd3LCqSV1T-inZYjA

This comes a very close second to The Brooklyn branch-I'd say possibly the atmosphere and the area where the restaurant is located in Vegas isn't as good as New York and so this affects the meal itself-however the pizza was gorgeous and we had to order more pizza as we went along, we had 3 18inch pizzas between 6 of us in the end lol 

The prices were reasonable and the wine was lovely! The service was a bit slow but the food was worth it in the end.

Giolani or whatever his name is was the older server who looked he hated his life. When I asked him if he could reheat my pizza because it was cold, he just looked at me, kept walking, and shook his head yes. Waited another 5 minutes for him to come back and never saw him again. 

So the FOOD...

we ordered the mediterranean salad which was delish! We ordered a large between two people and ate it all just fine with no struggle. I loved the sauce they used because it was your normal vinaigrette but it had a nice tangy sour kick to it! 

Finally after 20 minutes we received the pizza because they had to clean the ovens in the middle of the day. It was only warm. I don't about you but I love my pizza burning the roof of my mouth when I take my first bite. By the time i went for my second slice it was cold.",w15NByGsVedQLmpydJ7gPg,1,0,3,1MdTqfnQhYKdazIGJz9U0A

Had to wait a little while to be seated however; we were in a decent sized group of 8 people so it was expected that we may have to wait. Once we were seated our waiter came to take our drink orders immediately. Unfortunately I can not remember what his name was however he gave us great service and had an energetic personality (really funny). 

We ended up ordering 4 bottles of a Chianti and 6 calzones' and 1 large pizza all with different toppings and or fillings. It was really nice how they have it were you can choose your ingredients off a list and add as much of what ingredient as you want. We are carnivores so we packed ours with meat.

It did take a little while for our order to reach our table, about 25 minutes however; we had multiple bottles of wine... we didn't mind a little wait! 

When the food did reach our table it looked and smelled amazing. Upon biting in it tasted even better then it looked. You can tell it was fresh made straight from the oven. the crust had a nice crunch on the outside yet soft more fully inside texture. Overall taste of the food was great.

Are waiter would stop by the table every so often and check in on how the food was and would engage in small talk each time which we enjoyed.

After we were finished eating we still had a lot of late night plans yet were feeling a little sleepy after devouring all the delicious food. Our waiter overheard us talking about it and brought us all free coffee to help keep us up - and it sure did..

There are no witty hipster names or fancy concoctions here.  In fact, I was surprised to find that the menu didn't even provide any suggestions for topping combinations.  Just a choice of regular, white, or pesto base, and a list of run-of-the-mill ingredients such as pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, etc.

But don't let the simplicity of the menu fool you.  The crust was thin and impossibly crispy, with no hint of getting limp as we bore through the 12"" pizza.  The sauce packed a pleasant tangy punch.  The pepperoni was thick, chock full of flavor, all around excellent.  The italian sausage was pleasant, and our mushrooms remained fat and tender despite the coal oven.

We just wanted to get a small bite, got the small (their version of medium) traditional pizza.  The sauce and cheese were good, but it's the thin crust dough that's sooooo good!  Suggestion; 
Don't use the Parmesan cheese that's on the table but ask for the fresh shaved Parmesan.

The place is nicely decorated and has a cool vibe.  The reason I gave it 4 stars; our waitress forgot our waters, forgot to bring croutons that we asked on the side, and we had to ask twice for our check.

Grimaldi pizza was slightly better than Lombardi but it's not the best that I had. It was thin but wasn't crispy either. The sauce was nothing special.

Was a bit disappointed with the caprese salad because it was pretty plain. Usually they drizzle olive oil, salt, pepper, etc on it already bit it seemed the tomatoes were also a bit too unripe 

Pizza is great though! If you like thin crust with great selection of toppings, go here. Note that adding too many toppings can get a bit pricey",-7cPERHtAupd1Xq53nmhXg,0,0,3,x-Z50rVZGWy6ysX1TesBTg

I guess I should elaborate beyond my one word statement. We went to Grimaldi's for lunch on our second day in Vegas. This was our first time and won't be our last. 

Our waitress was Selina and she awesome. She made sure to explain to us how the menu works and what they were known for. She also warned us that their portions are huge and are meant to be shared, family style. I really appreciated her advising us because when on vacation I hardly eat left overs and I hate wasting food. 

My husband and I shared the small Mediterranean salad and small traditional pizza (toppings: ricotta cheese, pepperoni, sausage and jalepanos). Since it was early for us we decided not to drink any alcohol but I did check out their wine list and it is extensive and very reasonably priced. 

I know Vegas is not cheap but this place is probably a great way to stretch your money and have high quality food.

*Whew!* I finally got THAT off my chest! Feels great! Oh yeah!! 

So..to start this off, the ""service"" was not great! Coming from a 5-star hotel, you would expect better service. Am I right? Or am I right? Yes, I am right. 

The waitress - I forgot what her name was because her ""service"" sucked balls - was not helpful at all and was very rude.

When we first arrived, she never greeted us and was trying to rush us into ordering. Dude! We're not at Pho Kim Long, were at The Palazzo! 

Anyways, to start our dinner off, I wanted to order a glass of Sangria and asked our waitress what her recommendation was since I had a choice of a white or red Sangria. She answered me with, ""Well, that depends on what you like. If you like a sweet or sour."" Ummmm, Chinese food sweet and sour?! Say what? Who? How? Where? When? That...was...helpful?! I guess! I blankly stared at her for a second and kept quiet. It was such an awkward moment, I HAD to just brush it off. You would think that she would at least make up some BS just to show that she was trying to help me but no, she did not. I ended up getting the white Sangria - just because the menu says that it has Moscato in it. Thanks to the menu, it was more helpful than our waitress! High 5! 

As far as the pizza goes, who in their right minds would think that this place serves ""AMAZING"" pizza? Man, it was far from amazing I'll tell you that! Sometimes, I wonder if the waitress was the one who made the pizza because that pizza was just as bad as her service. 

Reasons why I did not like the pizza:

Strike 1: The pizza came out warm...almost cold.
Strike 2: The inner part of the pizza was soggy and VERY watery.
Strike 3: The pizza sauce was acidic! It was worse that Ragu. Lmao! 

Oh and to top off the horrible dinner experience, my 12-year-old nephew ordered a personal pizza and it came out last - after everyone had already eaten! WHY? Because apparently, when his pizza went into the brick oven, it flopped over. Lol!",lolgC0pJ-imOmQXV_cAwcA,2,0,1,pQr6Hc50si9B8kfmq04qwQ

The sausage tasted like sausage from pizza hut. Good pizza should not fall apart when i'm eating it. Overall, the pizza was just bland with nothing exciting about it. At the end, the server charged me 5 dollars more than our total bill, and when I asked her about it, she said she didn't remember and just handed me 5 dollars from someone else's check.

The Don pizza came out just the way we like it, crispy from the edge to the center, none of that floppy, soggy middle section.  Like our other favorite server Chris, Katey was attentive, personable and really genuine.  I'd gladly give this visit another 5 Stars for excellent pizza and fantastic service.

We came back the following night after the show for another Grimaldi's fix and this time the identical pizza was soggy in the middle and our server Arthur was very forgettable.  When you provide average service at best, don't top it off by leaving the bill and my credit card at the farthest possible spot on the table away from me Art.

You can choose from several pizza options on the menu, or you can customize your own. We went with a meaty combination of sausage, pepperoni, tomatoes, and olives, and it was fairly decent. The toppings were reasonably generous while the crust was somewhat spongy, which from my experience living in NYC is typical of pizza there.

I know there are a couple of other good spots but I love the service here. I always sit at the bar whether I'm alone or with a friend. 

Shawmbi was the bartender this night and he was awesome. I made a new friend at the bar too. I gave her a couple of slices of my pizza and she said it was ""yummy"". We then went on to play some craps after we finished our meal. ;) This is like the third time I made a friend at the bar and we went on to play some craps. 

So if you love pizza you should def give this place a try. It's thin and always comes out in good time and hot. The kitchen is open late and you can also get your pizza to go if you don't want to dine in. 

The salads are huge here just so u know. I could not finish mine. They have lots of toppings for pizzas. I haven't tried anything else on the menu though. It's all about the pizza for me. 

Order a small pizza if you're alone. Sometimes it can even be enough for two depending on your appetite.

My husband and I split a small (16""), with half kalamata and half pepperoni. They gave way more generous toppings than expected, to where there were multiple olives in each bite.

Also the sizes here run large so a small easily feeds two very generously. This won't be last visit!   Ps)a little Tabasco sauce on it never hurts!,jFJbz_bim87UUzipL1ZE6A,0,0,5,b6hbHmOlgbD891cb9BYC3A

Admittedly, the dough isn't as good as it is in Nyc or Brooklyn due to the water probably but the overall flavor is the same.

Their desserts are also amazing if you still have stomach for it afterwards. I highly recommend their New York Cheesecake. That would make your day for sure.",9TT_mBR1xKn5I62vg1yu7w,2,1,5,0A9lZnr5ztYY9GxGsQ0GjA

I have no idea what the pizzeria looks like and really don't care because on taste alone, it can be cooked on a cookie sheet and a lighter as long as it tasted that good.  I couldn't place what kind of cheese was used but I think it was manchego cheese along with the pepperoni and oh the spice, the spices just made for the best slice of pizza I've ever had.

3017467,2013-05-30,1,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"So this review is going to stand out- ahem.... okay carrying on. 

We went to Grimaldi's our first night in Vegas this last weekend mostly because it was the only thing open by the time we got into Vegas.

I'll be the first to admit that a pizza joint is no place for someone with a gluten allergy. That being said, I am surprised at how many places provide gluten free pizza...but I don't expect it. I try to avoid being a pain in the you know what to servers so I generally call ahead or just avoid these places, but this night we had no choice so I expected to graze from the salad bar. 

Now the skinny- We get there and I inform the server I'm gluten intolerant and ask if the salad dressings are gluten free. He simply responded- we don't have a gluten free menu. I acknowledge this and asked again if he could just have the kitchen check the back of their salad dressings to ensure they don't have gluten I'd be happy with their salad choices. He just repeated himself that they didn't have a gluten free menu and asked to take the orders of the other people at the table. I was so offended but at the same time I feel bad about my allergy so I just decided I wouldn't eat anything that night. 

Had it not been for my friend who went up to the hostess and asked her to please make sure their balsamic was gluten free I'd have not eaten. I was able to have this so I ordered the Mediterranean salad with no dressing and my boyfriend and I shared this with oil and balsamic. My only compliment about this salad was that it was a good portion, but we both agreed it was pretty bad otherwise. Ingredients didn't seem fresh and it was just a run of the mill salad for 15 bucks. My boyfriend had some of the pizza our friends ordered and wasn't enticed by it.

Our friends did seem to enjoy their pizza and I do have to say the beers were pretty cheap as my boyfriend enjoyed a few of them to help get through the salad ;) 

So, seems like everyone loves this place but unfortunately my experience with both service and food was very very Meh.",_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw,3,1,2,xjtOgEi9ajcfbpQdMUbZZw
3018070,2013-07-02,2,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"Highly rated location, so my friends and I decided to give this place a try. First off, horrible service. Very inattentive, very slow, and very lazy. We went around 3 P.M., so it wasn't busy at all, which makes me wonder why we weren't receiving any service. In fact, it was pretty overstaffed (it was about one server per table), yet we received no service. No worries, I thought, the food will definitely be worth it since there was so much positive feedback! NOT! Disappointed again. First off, its a thin crust pizza, which means it really shouldn't take very long. Took over 40 minutes. It made me wonder how they would be able to handle it if the place was packed. Maybe it is just never packed..... Pizza was sub par. Cheese got rubbery after five minutes. The crust was burnt on many areas. I enjoy a little burn since it is stone oven, but this was excessive. The sausage was good though, but what is the point of a good tasting ingredient if the pizza as a whole tasted like garbage.

3023780,2016-02-20,2,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"5/5 price
5/5 quality and freshness of ingredients
5/5 amazing service 

I have been to 3 Grimaldi locations and feel that this one is the best of the 3. Located inside the palazzo (NOT GRAND CANAL SHOPPES), it can be easily missed. A lot smaller than the other locations but service here is a lot better.

We had a party of 4 and were celebrating a birthday. My friend had a FREE large pizza for her birthday. We added meatballs, pepperoni and ricotta cheese. The meatballs are so soft and perfectly seasoned, not dry either. The pepperoni isn't like other pizza places that I've been to, it's a lot smaller and I don't really think it's that good. They don't skimp on the ricotta cheese either. Their pizzas aren't oily... Like at all. Each topping was about an additional $4. I feel that their toppings are limited but very fresh. They don't have any pineapple in case you're wondering. crust here is super thin but a large can definitely feed 3-4 people if you order sides!! I think a large pizza is $19.

We also ordered a large antipasto ($9) which came with bell peppers, mozzarella cheese, salami and olives. We were given slices of bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to enjoy with the antipasto. We also ordered the large house salad ($9) which came with romaine lettuce, mushrooms, olives, red onions and I'm not sure if I remember seeing tomatoes or not. It has a light and refreshing dressing. 

The 4 of us were too full to eat dessert so I would say be careful when you order a large pizza because it IS very large. Also, you can do half pizza with toppings and the other half with different toppings but you still have to pay the entire price for the toppings if that makes sense.

Our server was so sweet, she explained the menu and their current specials and continually checked in on us. Our waters were always refilled. Food came out in a good amount of time. 

Lovely decor, dim lighting, if you sit by the window you get a good view. Perfect for date nights.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,2,2,5,NjJmwomFSS7ClSeclZdtow

3042986,2012-12-14,1,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"Hearing that this is a New York transplant in Vegas, my friend had urged that I try out Grimaldi's. Upon arriving in Vegas, this was the first place we hit up, less than an hour after they opened. 

The hostess was quick to meet us and sat us outside in the main shopping area. I was hesitant at first because I didn't want the feel of being a zoo animal in an exhibit. 

My friend ordered the classic Margherita pizza while I ordered the plain pesto pizza.

Knowing that they freshly make their pizzas, we waited patiently and were more than thrilled with the pizzas arrived. Shortly after we got our food, there was a holiday special performance with Santa and his dancing elves. This attracted a lot of attention throughout the mall, and hence, made me feel like the zoo animal I feared I'd become.

People would walk by, pointing at what we were eating. And to add brownie points? Close to the end of the holiday performance, 'fake snow' started falling from the ceiling of the shopping center, so we got the complimentary topping of soap suds on our pizza.

This was the reason this review is 3 stars, not 4 or 5. I felt my experience was really ruined as a result of the special performance and eating outside in the shopping area.

TIPS:
1. Don't eat here on the weekends in December.
2. Eat inside if you can, don't sit out in the shopping area.
3. Order the pesto - it's yummy.

Overall, the pizza was tasty. I love NY style pizza [I actually love all forms of pizza - i don't discriminate]. Grimaldi's knows how to impress with their pies - too bad the locale was not as impressive.

Staff is friendly - moderately attentive with the water. Just when I thought our server forgot us, he would show up. Not sure I'd come back since Vegas is full of great places to feast at, but definitely won't pass it up if Grimaldi's came up in culinary consideration conversation.",yYEIePWZlDWuHWxUlir_oQ,1,0,3,ZavKfsw5WQq3zO0ZBiVZIQ

Total bait and swtich!  Crust tastes like grainy cardboard! Order was NOT made correctly!  There is no sauce on BOTH pizzas! I was even charged for missing toppings!  

Worst of all .... there is only a minor difference from this gluten free crust vs. dominos. I think they are the same crusts. Factory made and frozen. Does not taste like coal oven pizza AT ALL. Thd coan oven is most likley a marketing gimmick. Probably gas lighted oven through fake coals .. like a fake fireplace ... 

Either way the gluten free pizza is so awful and dry. I don't even want to finsih this garbage. So dry and tasteless. I will likely throw it out.

This location is in the Shoppes at the Palazzo/Venetian. Came here because of the great Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.

How good is the pizza? I ordered a Caprese salad to start, and it was probably one of the worst Caprese salads I have ever had. Dry and chewy mozzarella, flavorless tomato, limp basil, weak olive oil. I order Caprese salads almost everywhere they are offered and this is in the bottom 2 or 3 I have ever eaten. But the pizza here is SO good that I am giving 5 stars anyway. That's how good it is.

It's a coal-fired brick oven, thin crust pizza. With dough made from water they truck across the country from New York just to make it authentic. We had a pizza with spicy sausage, pepperoni and sliced tomatoes, and it was epic. It was ""I want to go throw up in the bathroom like the Ancient Romans to make room for more of this pizza"" epic. It was ""if someone runs in and grabs the last piece of pizza off my plate, I am chasing him down and beating him to death with a chair"" epic.

We ordered a small half pesto/white pizza with chicken and artichokes and a small sausage and mushroom. I liked the pesto the best. The others were aiite...

First off, the atmosphere is really cute, with subway signs and light fixtures shaped like bottles. The food is almost exclusively salad/pizza/calzone, but it's all pretty reasonably priced. Even a 12"" pizza is a decent lunch for 2 people and is $20. We got the Brooklyn Bridge, which has roasted red peppers, ricotta cheese, and sausage. It was a winning combination! The crust had a nice crispiness to it and loaded with flavor.

The service was good too. The waiter said ""the Don"" which looks like a pizza any meat lover would devour, was the most popular, and it was tempting. He also gave me a to-go cup of water which was nice compared to buying water in the casino. He even served us up the first two slices, which was not as good for my picture taking, but nice for service.

3162639,2014-04-08,0,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,I don't really have a thorough review of this place because I came here on a Sunday. It's Sunday lunch time in Vegas - a few hours before flight departure. You should know how most people feel about Sundays in Vegas. My friend ordered the Margherita pizza and I thought it was okay. The sauce seemed really bland. I am not really a fan of pizza with bland pizza sauce. The pizza's dough didn't really grab at me either. The crust was thin and you can actually watch some of the staff toss pizza. I think the place is good about accommodating large groups and the staff are pretty chill. I also learned they do not have ginger ale but they can attempt to make ghetto ginger ale. The keyword is 'attempt' Ghetto ginger ale consists of Sierra Mist with a splash of pepsi. My friend who ordered this concluded does not taste like Ginger ale. Not really sure why they bother. They should flat out say no and not offer this option. I gave it three stars cause the staff was chill but really food wise I would give it two. I am not really all that intrigued to come back.,FxSFEI9vfVcN6nOgfTQvng,0,1,3,kQyw-THooRlw6ayHqjlJew

Prices are reasonable as they offer the traditional pizza with their special sauce (regular red sauce), white with garlic, and pesto. They have a variety of toppings to select from ($2-4/each). The dough was nice and chewy but the pizza itself was bland. We ordered a large half red half white with pepperoni, chicken, artichoke, and olives.

Las pizzas que ofrecen son enormes. La individual es para dos personas, la grande, para seis. La modalidad, bastante normal en el país, es de pagar la pizza, y luego adicional por cada 'topping'. Pedimos dos, una bastante tradicional (jamon, muzzarella, cebolla), y otra un poco más mescolanza (pollo, pepperoni, jamon, muzzarella). Para mi sorpresa, la mescolanza fue una cosa magnífica.

La atención buena, en un momento una moza rompió un vaso al lado de nuestra mesa y en segundos estaba el encargado disculpándose y asegurandose que estaba todo bien.

If I could give them 3.5 stars, I would, without question, but I just can't quite go to 4 stars.  

The pizza is always good and made when you order.  The made to order part is outstanding, but, it always seems to take way longer than it should to prepare a pizza. The service, while friendly, has also always been a bit too casual and not entirely focused on the service part.  Now, we have only ever ordered from them late in the evening (Go figure, late night pizza in Vegas! Shocking!), so they're probably thinking about closing duties, but still.  The bar area where you order and wait maybe seats 7 people' it shouldn't be that hard to get some more water or order another beer.

The other thing that really prevents me from going up another star is the pricing.  It just seems absurd to pay anywhere from $2-$4 for toppings, on top of a small pizza already being $14.  Some of the pricing also just seems weird; sausage is $2 but jalapenos are $4? A jalapeno that is, at most, $1.00 in the store (if it's organic!)? 

Jim G. and I aren't even supposed to be eating these carbs, so this shouldn't even be an issue.  I hope, for my own sake, that I don't get sucked in to eating this too many more times.  However, when I do, at least I know that the pizza will be fresh and it will be good.

Unlike other pizza places like Sammy's Woodfire Pizza, they only serve pizza and salads, there are no other entrees, so be forewarned. I'm always a big fan of the normal pizzas, but they do have a white pizza that I heard was delicious as well. You order whatever additional toppings you want on your pizza for a certain price per topping on the whole or half of the pizza, adding each topping is the same price for both. In my opinion, the toppings could be a little cheaper since you are paying upwards of $18 for a large pizza and you can easily throw on three toppings and pay $25 for a pizza. The pizza itself is quite delicious though, so it's a nice treat once in a while. The pizzas are thin and can easily fall once you pick it up, so if you need to, use two hands or cut up the beginning portion with a fork until you get about halfway, where it is safe to pick up without falling.

We showed up right at opening time and were seated immediately. 

The server was friendly throughout the experience and was attentive to all of the items we needed. The restaurant itself has some seats on the ""patio"" which allows people to watch those walking around the casino and spots on the inside of the restaurant. The menu is broken into pizza (custom or specials), starters, desserts, and salads. Simple and classic dishes all around and for this trip decided to go with the Caprese salad and the Don which is their meat lovers pizza. The service as mentioned was quick and within minutes we had the Caprese salad. The portion is ginormous and obviously a simple dish with fresh basil mozzarella and balsamic vinaigrette. It was perfectly refreshing and took off the guilt of knowing I was about to break my diet and ingest a ton of carbs. The don was not too far off and this thing is loaded with sausage, meatballs, and pepperoni. The crust is nice and flaky and this is the solid thin crust pizza style. There was a good amount of char from the coal oven and the ingredients were plentiful and of good quality. 

All in all, a solid stop and you know the consistency to expect from a Grimaldis. This is certainly a welcome joint on the strip and one of my spots where i know I can carb up.",3Av38uh8aHDvZMV_1eojQA,5,1,4,Dx_BXRotnMB3IVBDSd9FCA

If I had to compare it to the location in NY city, I'd say this place isn't as good (just a little bit less crisp), however, it is still one of THE best thin crust pizza places in the Westside of the United States.  There, I stamped it.  

The crust here is crunchy, the cheese is packed with flavor, and the pepperoni + sausage is meat glory.  I suggest you don't order any veggies with it because it will just secrete water and ruin the pizza.  Keep it to these two toppings and you're in for a glorious treat.

What to get:  for a family of 4 with two toddlers, start with a large Cesar salad and get a large size pizza with meatballs and extra sauce.

hahahahahah. I don't know why I thought that was so funny... maybe leftover alcohol in my body...who knows.

I did enjoy the pizza! We got a regular one with mushrooms, sweet red peppers, and sausage. It was pretty good! I think this was the first time I had thin-crust NY-style - such a difference from Chicago-style deep dish. I like thin-crust because you don't feel so heavy afterwards, but you also don't really get full.

We also ordered the white pizza, which is just cheese and garlic. I thought this was such a waste of a pizza...but it was actually REALLY good. For all of  you garlic-lovers, definitely try it! I wouldn't suggest any toppings since it takes away from the cheese and garlic flavor. 

Our server was great.

Also had a bite of the regular pepperoni with mushroom and sausage, which was delicious too. The bacon topping was a bit too salty for my taste, but a lot of my friends seemed to enjoy that too. If you like thin crust, NY style pizza, this place delivers.

However, minus two stars for the service. The server didn't do much in terms of taking our order. We were left alone for a while, so one of my girlfriends took initiative and just started writing down our orders with pen and paper. We literally just handed the server our pre-written orders. Lame. Second, when it was time for clean up, the server was trying to dump half eaten pizza crusts on a bigger plate. Large pieces of crusts started falling off his precariously balanced plates right in front of me, but he didn't stop or say sorry. He simply picked up the dropped crusts and started dumping more on top of his growing pile. Eventually, large pieces of half-eaten crusts were falling ON MY LAP. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?! It wasn't until I said, ""Can you please stop that now?"" that he did. No apologies. Just left.

As someone who grew up working in a restaurant, this was 1) disgusting and 2) rude.  Yes, sometimes you drop things when clearing the tables. Yes, sometimes accidents happen. But you always give a courtesy ""sorry"" to the customer if you're dropping shit everywhere, and you STOP if your hands are getting too full. Come back a second time so you don't drop food ON TOP OF THE CUSTOMER. 

I'd even cut them some slack it was super busy and the servers were running around, but there were no more than 5-6 tables at the time being served. Awful. I wish I could have given this place 5 stars because we really did enjoy the pizza. The service though? 1 star.",K5UHLEadijlcXeT1NQ0V4g,0,0,3,v9gzp4M1wVCYJF4BArtnGQ

Pizza here is a bit more pricey, but it is yummy. A personal 12 inch pizza is $9 and toppings are $2 each... and it doesn't matter what size you get! So for a small pizza, you don't get as much value with toppings. I had a personal with pepperoni and mushrooms which is $13 and $14 with tax. Not bad and it satisfied me. 

Pizza is thin crust and oven baked. Very light and tasty. Since the pizza is thin, a personal will fill up a hungry person, if you are not too hungry, then it might be good for 2 people. I had left overs and ate it the next morning in my room and it still tasted good!!

The only thing I didn't like was that you can't charge to your room!! I was staying at the Venetian and I wanted my points!! Also, this is located on the Palazzo side of the shopping upstairs, like the end on the Palazzo side, so if you are staying at the Venetian, or like me in the Venezia tower, it can be a bit of a walk!",4AYfs8d7M2H4TBEiHhHTdQ,0,0,4,YDaCuUL5aui6fdcUaEOI2A

Julia S made our eating experience quite wonderful! She was very pleasant and so patient with us. Grimaldi's is so lucky to have someone like her working for them. I give her 5 stars!!

We ordered the Bruschetta w/ Chicken Pizza, We ordered a size small and it was perfect for my fiance and I. We are actually big eaters and suprisingly we were satisfied. It comes with oil and vinigar and we get to sprinkle how much we wanted on our pizza. It was so good.

My fiance wanted to take a picture of the chefs throw the pizza dough in the air and watch them spin it and everyone there were such great sports. 

I recommend coming here. This is my must go to spot when I visit Vegas. And hopefully Julia will be working because I know I'll be asking for her.

By my waiter's recommendation, I ordered my personal sized pizza with Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushrooms.  And here's my work of art:

It's gonna sound very cliche but here it goes:  This was one damn good pizza!  Probably one of the best I've ever eaten!  From the moment my waiter brought it to my table, I seriously got giddy.  The aroma coming from the fresh cut meats and cheese was very amazing!  The crust, while crispy, still had a nice soft chew to it and had a nice rustic flavor to it.  But we all know in the end it's all about the toppings.  You can tell by the pic that everything was cut fresh and handmade.  And when I took that first bite, I was in pizza bliss =)  Very delicious!!  It was really handcrafted with a lot of love.

I'm glad that I decided to deviate from my itinerary and stop over to Grimaldi's.  Now I understand what all the hype was all about!  One of the best pizzas ever!

Review:
I am so glad that my boyfriend and I tried this place. It was recommended to me by my coworkers and I thought it was just another build-your-own Blaze pizza type of place. The pizza was fresh, thin, and delicious. I like my pizza crispy, which was what made me like this place a little more than secret pizza.

There was no wait.
Great food and atmosphere.

As for the PIZZA, it's NY style thin crust pizza but wow, what a crust. Not too soggy, not too crispy but just right. The ingredients tasted fresh and it's not too greasy either. On top of everything, THE PRICE is awesome. My friend and I ordered an 18incher (we ate the whole thing)for less than 20 dollars.

Maybe it was the New York water or being cooked in that original over 100-year-old brick oven, but it was just better. 

Grimaldi's has since then franchised out and I'm not sure if they even own that location in Brooklyn anymore. The pizza recipe and flavor is probably diluted a bit, but I love that familiar chewy crust.

It was average- like he was going through the motions but didn't really care for our answers. I can feel the insincerity. We had to ask for slices of lemons three times before somebody other than our server, brought them out. We had a baby with us and asked for additional napkins. We asked three times before he finally brought them out. He seemed annoyed by our requests. They weren't difficult ones just standard ones. I didn't like it at all. He did check on us and ask how everything is but didn't seem to stay long enough to really hear our answers. Like I said, no sincerity.

The pizza isn't bad; okay,  it's edible...but just barely. 
The real problem is that it's boring. 

All the elements just don't harmonize. 

The crust is overcooked. It's too hard, too crispy with no chewiness. I suggest that the Grimaldi clan go to Settebello in Green Valley and tast real Neapolitan pizza. 
Crust should be chewy, not hard dammit!
Take a trip to Napoli, the birthplace of pizza, if you don't believe me.

The toppings are not in synch with any of the other toppings. It's as if they were chosen on their own with no awareness of how they would ultimately work together.

And please! 
This coal-fired nonsense, and New York water nonsense doesn''t mean anything, except as a marketing ploy to get gullible tourists to think they're eating something special. 

If you want great pizza, go down the street to Sicili's Pizza on Twain. It's in a ghetto area, so I don't advise eating in, but as take-out or delivery, it's amazingly good. And at half the price!!!

But if you're a lazy tourist who doesn't want to leave the casino, then you're stuck with this mediocre pizza.

3973565,2013-12-05,1,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"A NYC establishment in Vegas? Sounds familiar. There have been lots of different well known restaurants from all over setting up shop in Vegas. It's like the trendy thing to do now. But anyways having eaten at the OG Grimaldis in New York, I didn't have high expectations that it would nearly as good. It was semi busy for dinner so we just got a large pie to go. They don't offer any of the normal combos like pepperoni or meat lovers or veggie. It's all customizable pizzas or al la carte with you choosing the size and whatever toppings you want. There were 4 of us and we got a large as it's only 2 bucks more than a medium. There were about 10 huge slices so I think it's perfect for a group of 5. We had regular pizza with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese (included) with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni (extra). They said about 15-20 minutes but I believe we waited more like half an hour. Lame, could've walked around more versus waiting in front. But the pizza was hot and delicious. The cheese tasted fresh and was super gooey and each slice had lots of each of the toppings. Again, not as good as what I remember from NY but it hit the spot and it wasn't super pricey - pretty much on spot with what I paid on the east coast.",shVyD312LNnLUvQEPdzo7g,0,0,3,F2BFZWsACvIXie26DMiwFw
3995319,2013-03-05,1,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"As far as pizza and deals go, this is some of the best i've ever seen.  it was so good that my friends and I went two days in a row.  They serve New York style pizzas, I think a large, which should fill up 2 people very comfortably if not 3, cost $16.  Most veggie toppings are $2 extra, some are $4.  

We got a large pizza with mushrooms and onions, I had 2 and a half slices.  I was pretty full, but I would've eaten more just because it tasted so good.  The sauce was amazing, tangy and slightly sweet, crust was crunchy, and I could taste the toppings.  I've been to Vegas several 6 times in the past year and a half, and this is one of the best food deals I've come across.  You won't be disappointed.",pE78FURl-5_QYQYNY3S_fQ,1,0,5,mPQTo3oBgchtfi4G64e21Q
3996670,2015-06-17,1,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"I've wanted to try Grimaldi's every time I've been in NYC, but never made the trek down to Brooklyn. I'm not sure how this compares to the original, but it's certainly one of the best pizza places now in Las Vegas. It's not the best or the cheapest pizzas I've ever eaten but it's probably one of the better pizzas I've eaten in Vegas (even sober, because yes, even cardboard, oily pizza tastes great at 4 am when you're drunk). It's on the expensive side and probably 50-70% more expensive than you should really be paying for pizza, but that's usually how it goes in Vegas.

I was sad that The Pizza Spot @ The Wynn closed, but this is way better and less greasy with a better selection of toppings. I've also eaten at the Secret Pizza spot (at the Cosmo), which is also good, especially if you only want a single slice, but it's definitely greasier and has limited toppings.

This is tucked away upstairs in the Palazzo and wasn't crowded at all when I came on a Sunday evening at 6 pm. I had a hard time deciding what to order as there were too many combinations of toppings to pick from (around 20: pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, extra basil) and 3 different sauces - the traditional tomato sauce, white garlic sauce, or pesto. I asked the server what was popular or good, and he was not very helpful (telling me he disliked garlic and that I had to decide on my own).

The way they price the pizza and toppings is odd. The personal pizza, 12 inches, is $9 for the base (just dough, tomato and cheese), and the small pizza is 16 inches and $14, and the large is 18 inches and $16. I don't know why they don't have a medium size, or why they didn't just make a small, medium and large - probably so the people dining solo didn't feel awkward for ordering an entire ""small"" pizza for just themselves. If you want the white with garlic, add on $1 or $2 depending on the size of the pizza. The price of the toppings is odd, either $2 (mushrooms, garlic, olives, spinach, ham, extra cheese, extra basil, italian sausage, meatballs) or $4 (sausage, sun dried tomatoes). I don't know why extra basil is the same price as italian sausage, why garlic or jalapeños are $2 each, and why sun-dried tomatoes are $4. Just close your eyes, order and know that your bill (like everything else in Vegas) will be expensive.

I got the italian sausage and mushroom personal pizza. I could have done with just half the pizza, but ended up eating it all (I figured I already had done a number on my body in Vegas, so why not just continue the bad decisions). The crust was delicious and thin, and not burnt. The tomato sauce was the right amount and it was not overly cheesy (the cheese also seemed fresh and high-quality), nor did they skimp on the toppings. All in all, once I started eating, I couldn't stop - it was delicious.

It wasn't the fastest pizza - from the time I ordered to when I got the pizza, it was probably 30 min or so. It was on the expensive side ($17 for a small pizza), but not outrageously priced for Vegas, and it was one of the better pizzas I've had in Vegas. I'll definitely be back here next time I stay at Wynn or Encore and need some carbs to soak up the alcohol or a fairly-inexpensive casual meal. Come with at least 2 people so you don't have to eat an entire pizza by yourself.

You can also order pizza and pick it up, which is a nice option if you are too hungover to leave your room and have a nice friend who will come pick it up for you.",cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,3,3,4,rBnFBO3Oyk6zuTcp2FKjLg

4137478,2013-07-16,1,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"On a fairly recent trip to New York, I opted to try out Lombardi's instead of Grimaldi's. And while I can't comment on whether the Las Vegas location is exactly the same as the one in New York, from what I can tell, I think Grimaldi's is much better than Lombardi's.

Now I'm a deep dish pizza kind of girl. Not that I hate thin crust, but I do not prefer it. Grimaldi's was still excellent in my eyes, and I would definitely come back given the option on a future Vegas trip. I really enjoyed the sausage as a topping, but I would stay away from the bacon, as it's a bit too salty. 

Keep in mind when you come here that this is New York style pizza. It's thin crust, it's simple. I'm thinking that maybe some of the negative reviews here are grounded on unmatched expectations due to unfair or unrealistic standards. 

Four girls split a large pizza and a large salad. Just the right amount of food.

Oh, keep in mind, if you want to do half-half on your pizza and have a certain topping on only half of your pizza, they will still charge you as if you had that topping on your ENTIRE pizza. In other words, if mushrooms cost ""X"" amount of dollars as a topping for your whole pizza, they will still charge you ""X"" amount of dollars to get mushrooms on only half your pizza. Kinda lame.

Inside decor was nice as well, with New York subway pictures and signs.

4367454,2015-08-20,1,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"Pizza is my favorite food and Grimaldi's definitely hits the mark. My boyfriend and I just happened across this place as we were walking through the Venetian, and made it a point to come here based on the reputation of the New York location. Going in, I was a little confused about what to expect because the restaurant is set up to look like a casual, fast pizza place, but mixed with fine dining. For example, they had checkerboard/picnic blanket table cloths, but each table had a couple of wine glasses. I wasn't sure where on the scale of Little Caesars to artisan pizza this was going to fall. 

Thankfully, there was no wait here, unlike what I've heard about the New York location. We were seated right away and the hostess was very accommodating when I asked to be seated at a table other than the one she initially pointed out. I really liked the table that we did sit at, because we could look out of the restaurant and see the crystal decorations of the Venetian. 

Our server was with us right away as well and quickly brought out water with ice upon our request. He let us take our time to figure out what we wanted to eat, and even suggested a small salad while we decided. 

We chose the Caesar Salad, and as our server suggested, it was more than enough for the two of us. It was also really tasty; I almost forgot to take a picture of it before it was all gone. The lettuce was fresh and the dressing was evenly tossed. The croutons were also really great, large pieces and very crunchy. The salad was topped off with fresh shaved parmesan and our server also helped us with some cracked pepper. Very good start to the meal.

The pizza menu does not have many preset combinations eg. veggie/meat lovers. Instead, they have a basic crust with sauce and cheese (prized on size)  and you can add on toppings for $2-$4 based on what they are. I believe the cost of the topping is regardless of size of the pizza you choose. The are based on ""premium"" vs ""regular"" topping eg. artichoke vs extra cheese. They also have an option of red or white sauce and a pesto option.

For our pizza, we knew we wanted Italian Sausage on there right away, but for the rest of the toppings, we were a bit more selective based on each others' preferences and the quickly increasing price. I consented to Pepperoni while my boyfriend allowed for the Fresh Sliced Roma Tomatoes. We also got the Fresh Baby Spinach, Fresh Garlic, and Extra Mozzarella Cheese. We ordered it all on a small size (16 inch) pizza, which was enough for the two of us.

It did take a while for the pizza to come out, but we enjoyed our time watching from the window. When the pizza arrived, I was so excited because it was bigger than I expected, and it also smelled and looked amazing. I consider myself to be a pizza genius now, because the combination of toppings we had picked out worked so awesome together. I know, it's just a basic meat pie, but I thought it was almost mind-blowing. The sausage was very traditional and tasty and complemented their famous sauce very well. I also loved the spinach on the pizza and wish there had been more. The garlic really made the dish for me, I really looked forward to the bites where I could see little clusters of garlic. Really, each bite was packed with flavor and I could not stop eating. 

Even though I was completely stuffed after the pizza, I wanted to order the Tiramisu because my boyfriend had never had it before. While it was not the best tiramisu I have ever had, it was quality dessert and a very good first try for my boyfriend. We both enjoyed how creamy the mascarpone was and how moist the ladyfingers were.

The highlight of this experience was definitely the pizza (as it should be) and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. With the personalization of the pizzas, everyone can get something they love.",IM5f9bNoY_UrrQli1O9Riw,0,0,5,CajRF49jrA7oVaD0pNHBUA

The waitress said that everything is the exact same as the one in Brooklyn, even down to the water they use for the dough.

So you customize your own pizza and can make it a personal size or share with others. For 2 ppl, the large (18"" for $16 + $2-4 per topping) is a pretty good size that gives you 6-8 slices. All I can say is GET THE RICOTTA CHEESE. Seriously.

The waitress also highly recommended the new amaretto cheesecake as well... good luck trying to save stomach room for that!

Thus my review of the original Brooklyn location holds the same for this location (except for the 45 min wait since this location is much bigger):

""The best New York pizza I've ever had! Being a California girl, I've still managed to make my way to Grimaldi's twice this year and even waited in the 45 minute long line to get into the door. The wait was definitely worth the fresh, doughy, thin crusted pizza with an array of toppings to delight your taste buds. I think the first time I went, we ordered mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and ricotta on our pizza. The second time we ordered basil, sun dried tomatoes, and sausage. Both times the pizza wasn't too oily or too cheesy, and the chewy sun dried tomatoes gave the texture an extra kick. And despite my friends and I eating the entire large pizza, we still walked out without the bloated, heavy feeling. Excellent.""",KxVf5jFIA_1Yk0nnLMq6mA,4,3,5,UqOApbD1FPjJQg4EqD3wyA

There was no one else there because we were there so late and the bartender kept cleaning his glasses instead of refilling ours.

4413811,2017-03-06,0,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"My first slice of pizza in NYC was at the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. I was never really a pizza person before (don't judge too hard please - having grown up in LA, all the pizza was kinda subpar), but one bite of Grimaldi's had me spiraling down a pizza rabbit-hole of obsession. I was HOOKED and I had Grimaldi's to thank. Since my first pie at Grimaldi's many many years ago, I've taken all my friends who visited NY to Grimaldi's for that quintessential NYC pizza heaven. 

And I was super stoked to find the Grimaldi's in Las Vegas. The hype and expectation were so real and so high - and I'm so happy to report that Grimaldi's in LV did not disappoint. 

Crust = perfect achievement of thin and substantive. And supposedly the Grimaldi's kitchen takes its dough so seriously that it hires chemists to replicate the water pH and chemical balance of NYC so that the same water is used in their dough everywhere!

Sauce = ugh. so goooooooooood. Sweet and savory, without being overly empowering of either. 

CHEESE = fresh. SO FRESH and that mozzarella was so melt-in-your-mouth that I'm still singing about it!

Between the two of us, the personal pizza (12'') was plenty! Plus we got a little greedy and ordered the Caprese Salad as an appetizer. 

**DO NOT GET THE CAPRESE SALAD - the tomatoes tasted old and bland. The cheese was good, but the tomatoes were such a letdown, and I'm just relieved that the tomatoes in the pizza were bursting with flavor.

I have had the caprese salad both time with fresh, bright red tomatos and delicious mozzarella cheese. The spinach salad was also good when I tried it my recent visit. 

I have not had to wait for a table as of yet. Their desserts I have heard many good things about but have not tried. The pizza and salad makes me full enough.

4655061,2016-04-02,4,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"Last night, on my last review I shared my experience at a pizzeria that was ordinary at best. For this review I will leave Paris for Italy to share a pizzeria that makes me say, ""wow!"" Being this is the Las Vegas Strip, the distance from Paris to Italy is less than a mile. 

    Grimaldi's is a pizzeria chain that started in New York City. There original location is off Fulton Street under the Brooklyn Bridge (this place fits would fit in at NY-NY). Grimaldi's became so popular that it spread to different parts of the country. There are a few locations in Las Vegas. The neat thing about Grimaldi's is that their two locations on the Las Vegas Strip (the other one is in Fashion Show) are identical to the off-strip locations. Disparate from certain restaurants, Grimaldi's has stayed off the price - gouging bandwagon. Another neat thing is that I personally visited the original location. Well kind of. On the way to Atlantic City, my friend pulled up to Grimaldi's and took out a pie that was delicious road food on the drive. A few other times, he'd take out Grimaldi's. The fact that he lived in the middle of Long Island, a landscape where the pizzeria is the equivalent of the poker lounge in Vegas, and stopped at Grimaldi's when he was in the City is evidence that Grimaldi's is first-rate pizzeria. From these experiences, I attest to the fact that Grimaldi's is legitimate New York pizza instead of a pizzeria pretending to be. 

   Practically across the continent and a long ride across Interstate 15 and 80 to the George Washington Bridge this Grimaldi's sits in the shadow of canals, gondola boats, and St. Mark's Square. Just like the Brooklyn Bridge, this makes for an exciting spot to enjoy New York pizza that melts in your mouth and not in your hands. 

   The restaurant itself is impressive. It is a large space on the upper floor of the Palazzo Shops a coin throw from the pedestrian bridge leading to the Wynn. The upscale environment is a relaxing location to bite into New York pizza while listening to a soundtrack including Frank Sinatra. The impressive dining space extends from a patio overlooking the Palazzo Shops to Las Vegas Boulevard. There are several tables with red and white table cloths plus a bar underneath the dimly lit pizzeria. Many of the tables offer a unique Vista of the colossal chandelier hanging from the Palazzo Shops ceiling forming a wall at the restaurant elevation. Talk about elegance. Now I will talk about the pizza. 

    I respect Grimaldi's for having the decency to pass over taking advantage of being on the Las Vegas Strip. The prices are commendable. A small New York pizza pie featuring the coal oven cooked thin crust, melting mozzarella cheese, and out of this world Grimaldi's sauce is $9 before toppings. The menu offers a sundry of toppings including meatballs, pepperoni, bacon, and other choices. I cherish my pizza pie with mushrooms. The mushrooms, in similar style to numerous toppings adds $2 to the experience. And what an experience! Prior to the pizza pie, bread and butter is a tasty oman to meal ahead. With the pizza pie, I order a soda. After tip and tax, it comes out to less than $20 well spent. 

   At Grimaldi's, the staff is just like the pizza: pleasant. The servers have always been attentive and friendly. One of the servers I had for a few visits was extraordinary friendly. I remember asking him if they are opening anymore Grimaldi's. He enthusiastically said that they want to build one in northwest Las Vegas. That was a couple of years ago and has yet to happen. What does happen is that you feel appreciated here. 

   This review is a word picture that tells a true story that there is usually a Happy Ending dining at the Palazzo Grimaldi's. This positive word picture is one of the positive Grimaldi's accolades. The Food Network rated it as one of the five best pizzerias in the United States. Ziglats rated it as the best pizzeria in New York City. I will finish painting this word picture by saying that I recommend Grimaldi's.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,10,4,OGLhOyDFgyL7tM7qbWOeBw

We've been to the one under the Brooklyn bridge where we waited 2 hours to get a seat, in the hot July heat at the concrete jungle that is New York. Coming here, the place wasn't packed. It took awhile to walk around and try to find it in the Palazzo when the Palazzo isn't typically a place we would stop in for. 

We got seated on the deck area facing the hallways. We watched a guy passed out and security trying to get him to move. He was clearly intoxicated and on a few other stuff. It was amusing to watch while we wait for our pizza. 

We shared an extra large pizza with basil, their buffalo mozzarella and some pepperonis. It was delicious but I guess the fact that it wasn't in NY had something to do with it to deflate my excitement a bit.

Grimaldi's has been kicking the pepperoni out of all the strip fancy shmancy pizza places since they opened in Vegas a few years ago.  From it's original location under the Brooklyn Bridge (which I've been to), this New Yorker ain't gonna take no guff from some high end mega resort.  They are running the show and this isn't a diluted Grimaldi's Pizza, it's the real deal.  

Located in the Shoppes at the Palazzo, now you don't have to venture off the strip for a Grimaldi's pizza (if you don't want to).  Prices actually seemed to be pretty close to other Grimaldi's locations.  Not to say this is a cheap pie, you get what you pay for and adding toppings gets expensive quick.  Problem is they are all so good, it's hard to not add them.  Went with Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, Mushroom, Onion, Roasted Sweet Red Peppers, and fresh Basil.  My biggest complaint with Grimaldi's has always been the basil.  It just gets charred up in the coal fired oven and you lose the flavor of it as it's replaced with a burnt taste.  Lombardi's Pizza in New York adds the basil after the pie is cooked, so this time I had Grimaldi's do that and I liked it a lot better.  Perhaps there was too much basil on the pie and it would have been better shredded a little finer, but it still was a nice topping, and I recommend you order it that way.  Also don't dismiss the meatballs as a topping, they are really good and have lots of flavor.  The pepperoni and sausage provided some spice.  The cheese is fresh mozzarella and very rich.  I can assure you this will be one of the best pies you've had.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=XqdLYxc2ln60eNNNZ4NOmw#XqdLYxc2ln60eNNNZ4NOmw

We also were very happy with our Caesar Salad.  Nothing super special, but tasty.  It's easy to go meal after meal in Vegas realizing you haven't eaten anything green in a while.  We ordered the large and it was plenty enough for 4 adults to share.  Considering how good their dough is, I'm very interested in trying a calzone on another trip.  Saw a few people eating them and they looked to be a good size.

If you are staying at the Palazzo, Grimaldi's will be hard to avoid since you will keep getting wafts of pizza in the hallways and elevators as people get it to go and head up to their rooms.",Bt6gmjnWHPERhiOTQOhuEA,13,13,5,qS3dSRAc46uOggsHPgWtPg

This is located in the Venetian hotel, but is on the second floor (I think), and we took a while to find it. Better to ask for directions rather than roam around trying to find it yourself. 

It is decorated a little differently from the NYC locations, but it has the traditional feel of an italian pizzeria. They also have sort of an outside seating as well, which gives a pseudo-patio feeling. They have some ny based props like subway signs hanging around, and is brightly lit. The place is reasonably large, but generally is pretty crowded. We saw a lot of families dining there.

It took us 20 minutes to be seated after getting there at 7 on a Saturday night, pretty reasonably for a weekend dinner. Once seated, service was prompt and attentive. Our server was very jolly and friendly. He made good conversation and suggestions. 

We got a bottle of wine to share, and all the different bruschetta to start off. I really liked the mushroom one, but all of them were great. We got three different pizzas to share, one pepperoni, one chicken, and one vegetarian. All of them were really good, but again, not as good as its original locations.

The pizzas are huge. The smallest personal one can easily be shared by two, unless you've not eaten the entire day. The large pizzas are more suited for 5 people. We had to box much of our pizzas, which were useful the next morning. 
The prices are very reasonable, and of excellent value here. Since portions are large, it's great to share.

Definitely recommend this to everyone for some great pizza and good atmosphere for dinner, if you want to avoid the fancy restaurants and bars, or are with family. It's not an intimate or classy place, but again, it's just an informal pizzeria.",oNG7plVQxJsllPv4yQF0dg,0,0,4,MtF7hdH_CRI1G3v_KxPEdQ

And then we are talking to the young lady that seated us and she tells me that they change the coal in the oven twice a day.   How much more authentic and how much more can you care about your customers than that?

Absolutely outstanding place.  Loved their location (Palazzo Shoppes, LV Blvd. entrance), decor (light fixtures made from wine bottles), ambience, service and, most of all, their pizza. You walk in, are pleasantly welcomed and taken down a long hallway, passing smaller tables of patrons, to the main dining area. Ordered a small pizza with ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes.  SOOO good!!  In fact, I love this place so much more than the Brooklyn location, though there is something to be said for standing on the sidewalk waiting to get in at the original.  And I thought the pizza was just better. Mabel was just a very pleasant, smiling and attentive waitress and was very patient with my wife's undecisiveness.

You can actually stand there and watch them make the pizza and shove it into the brick oven with their long pizza paddles, all burned and crusted.  Quite cool.

We also ordered a small dinner salad (that wasn't so small) with a dressing that was excellent.

We topped it all off with a superb Tiramisu.  Dang, that thing was good!

The only other pizza that I believe we like just as much or more is from Bottega Louie in downtown Los Angeles.  Either way, you can't go wrong.

If there was only one thing I didn't care for, was the price of the toppings. Four bucks each to add the artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes.

BTW, they didn't take reservations for only two, so they told us to just walk right up and check in.  We got there around 6:30pm, perfect timing.

But Grimaldi's Pizza left such an impact on my taste buds. It was a combination of the fresh sauce, fresh ricotta, tomato and basil. The sauce especially... It wasn't heavy and pasty, it was fresh, tomato-ie and light. The coal fired pie was thin but cooked to perfection. But the sauce! It totally made the pizza. The only drawback was my wife and I ordered a small to share... And I wanted more

Which ended up being over forty.

When we finally were seated, the waitress, came over and wanted to start a conversation about where we variously were from, and our reasons for visiting Vegas.
We  just wanted to eat.

The waitress appeared offended that we weren't enchanted by her (Southern?) hospitality; and her response to our request for expedience, was to bray information regarding our food options, at high speed and volume 

Braying at an almost painful level seemed to be her preferred manner of communication.
I think that speaking at the same speed as the pe xqople who read the legal copy at the end of commercials was her special gift to us only.

The food was mediocre and not particularly memorable.

I found a foreign object (different ingredient) in my food, and when I pointed it out, the waitress told me that all the topping ingredients are in the kitchen, so sometimes they get mixed in accidentally.

Incorrect response.
""Oh, sorry"" would have been so much better.

I don't enjoy being patronised, and it becomes more annoying when the person taking the high ground has an inability to sense how to behave in varying situations.

We were both in agreement that this pizza was did not live up to the hype. All the toppings were bland.  I don't know how you can rob bacon of its flavor but they managed to achieve this task here.  A large pepperoni, mushroom, bacon and half Italian sausage pizza was ordered and was just largely disappointing.

The artisan crust on a New York style pizza just doesn't work for me.  

Now any red blooded American knows that ranch is mandatory with pizza.  Not hidden valley bottled ranch but a creamy delicious fresh made ranch more than complements a slice... It completes it.  So as we dined on America's birthday we requested ranch and were denied!  They do not have ranch because the executive chef does not approve of low brow ranch.  After this statement was made the server proceeded to bring out a shaker of, fresh out of the powdered bottle, of Parmesan cheese.  Ranch isn't acceptable but this is?

OK so it's from a small chain pizzeria.  But hey, this is Vegas, this is the Strip.  They are going to copy the NY original like no other place else can.  Classic 1200 degree coal burning ovens, formulated water with identical pH and mineral content of NYC water (not sure if this is a good thing).  All leads to what is undoubtedly one of the best NYC style pizza crust.  It's blistered,  well seasoned, just the right thinness with the perfect chew, with the perfect hint of smoky bitterness.  

Dirt cheap for the Strip.  $9 for a personal 12"" red sauce pie $10 for a garlic white sauce or pesto.  Add $2 per topping including some great spiced meatballs, sweet Italian Sausage (American style), tender oven roasted peppers and milky mozzarella.  Mild intensity to any of the sauces to let the toppings show through.

Calzones are excellent.  Same great dough as the pies, same great filling in a hand held pouch.

True NYC pizzeria feel with the manager, hostess, and bartenders loudly shooting the breeze right at the door (when it's not too busy).  

A well chosen  selection of wines focusing on Italy, most offered by the glass or half carafe (500ml or 2/3 of a whole bottle).  Reasonable prices.  Half off all wines on Tuesdays.

My husband and I just arrived and were tired and hungry so this seemed easy.

I was relieved that there was no wait for two people. The restaurant on a Sunday evening around 8 was bustling but not too crowded. We were seated promptly on their little ""patio."" 

To start, we ordered a 1/2 carafe of one of the Sangiovese wines and a Mediterranean salad. We asked for the large, but the waitress helpfully told us that a small salad was enough for two people so we got that, then placed an order for a personal size Margherita pizza. 

Wine- it was okay. I'm not a connoisseur by any means but I've had wines that I prefer to this one. Still, it did the trick after a long day of driving! $18 for the half carafe, which was about two and half glasses. Since one glass was $7, I'm not entirely sure how good a deal that was.

Mediterranean salad- ~$6. romaine lettuce, kalamata olives, feta cheese, tomato, cucumber, and red onion with some type of vinaigrette on top. The small was sufficient although we probably could have finished a large. This was average; the dressing was kind of bland, the lettuce not great and the pieces of feta were pretty small. 

Margherita pizza- $12. I enjoyed the pizza overall; both the sauce and crust were well seasoned. The thin crust was nice except that it unevenly cooked. One side was burned while the other side was almost underdone. So...points off for that.

The Brooklyn Bridge ($24/ large) pizza is a must get.  It's a traditional pizza with red peppers, sausage and most importantly... ricotta cheese!

I have been to the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and love it, and was pleasantly surprised when I went to this location at The Palazzo. I was worried it would be food court garbage like (I assume) Di Fara's (at Caesars Palace) is. Pretty much the opposite of food court garbage, this place is sit down and actually has a nicer ambiance than the original, though I still missed the original Grimaldi's collection of signed photos of dubious ""celebrities"" over the years.

Also, just like our trip to the Brooklyn mothership, my daughter was a big cranky pants and wanted to go to the bathroom just as the pizza arrived. 

Skip the trio of bruschettas. They were really in need of olive oil, a spread, or some kind of sauce because they were so dry the ingredients just fell off. The mushrooms with garlic had way too much raw garlic. The artichokes were okay as were the tomatoes with parmesan. All I could think of was the bruschetta I make is better.

The pizza was the star of the show. It was Uh. Maze. Ing. They use fresh mozz, and the tomato sauce is nicely sweet.

5236132,2017-03-11,2,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"Welcome to Las Vegas, the land that time forgot or would like to. You're gonna need a breather from the progressive Hold'em tables, or flingin' quarters at the pole dancers, and you'll need to break bread somewhere. Why not break pizza dough? 

As you know pizza opinions are highly subjective. Ask 20 people, ""Where's the best pie?"" and you will get 22 different answers. In Vegas maybe 35 answers. 

This gilded pazzo palace of pizza in the Palazzo may be your answer. It's a perfect place to unstrap your 3 belly packs, both fanny packs, your selfie stick, bandolero of iPhones and garage door openers, your Blue Teeth, your own teeth and enjoy a house made pizza as big as a roulette wheel. 

The Vibe: Its red checkered table cloths and a coal fired oven in a meager attempt to add some charm to a town that's charm lite. Who goes there? Anyone who's rapidly disposed of their disposable income at the Black Jack Tables before cocktail time. 

The Staff: I want what our server took before his shift to make him so energetic and bubbly as Champagne. He was a cross between a UNLV Cheerleader and a long haul trucker takin' West Coast Turnarounds. You know the guy that makes coffee nervous? Our guy made that guy nervous. However, he was as good natured as a Lab Puppy and twice as friendly. 

The Bar Program: Traditional B & W. A few drafts and a few wines and a full  bar if that's required. The house pushes the house Meritage. Mille Gradi (Sangiovese, Syrah, and Merlot. (Ask for the S and M at your own risk). Grimaldi's makes this stuff in Italy at least until there is a Trump tariff on it. Some said it was one click from salad dressing, some said it was was blended with sour dough starter, but for me it went down and stayed there. It is a very reasonable $35 per bottle and actually fine for your pizza. 

The Chow: The Bruschetta Trio was a MEH-rinated Mushroom and Roasted Red Pepper version, next, a Jarred Artichoke with Olive Medley (courtesy of Kirkland), and finally, a classic sleepy Tomato and Basil (both out of season). 

The Grimaldi's House Salad was everything that didn't get tossed onto a Garden Pizza the night before with a simple vinaigrette. Order this so you can look your internist in the eye and say you had something green with your Death Row meal. 

The Caesar Salad on the other hand was manageable. The Romaine was fresh and not refreshed. The dressing was decent, but the croutons were only suitable as a bar nibble in a sleazoid Strip Club pandering to Army recruits. 

The Pizza is what you came for, right? Order a few 23 inchers. What you order in Vegas may go home with you. 

The Don (a meat lovers) was the pick of the litter. A crisp outer crust that drops off sharply as you close in on the center. It came with the troika of Meatballs, Pepperoni, and Sausage, house made Tomato Sauce, Mozzarell, and Parm from the green can. (God forgive them). Seeing as you have to call Uber to take you from your room to the reception desk in this hotel complex, it is convenient. Is it Mozza? No suh! Pizza Bianca? Nein, danke. But this pizza was the best of the bunch offered here.    

Then there was the MEH-garita Pizza. This was Restaurant Supply Cheese on a cracker. Even though it was as big as an XL Whoopie Cushion, there weren't a whole lota whoopie with this one. Grab the waiter when he flies by and ask for three orders of Bacon and try it again. 

The Pesto Special Order was scrambled. They pushed everything off the counter onto the next crust on the assembly line, fired it and delivered it. It was not what was requested, but we flexed and accepted it as is. The Pesto was more paste, oh, how can you muck that up? It's mindlessly easy to make. The Chewing Gum Chicken on top of it will give you something to do for hours. The rest of the mess was recycled Bruschetta. Forgettable. 

In the end, Grimaldi's was a split decision between Grim and Aldi.",mDQhgesXXOKaDQW2o00sMg,4,3,3,XcO3SIoehFyzQbR5TasahQ

Large Pizza - Half Traditional / Half White with Garlic and Artichoke Hearts
Dessert Trio - Sampler of Cannoli, Tiramisu, Bailey's Irish Cream Cheesecake

Vowing to use every free offering and comp sent to me for my Birthday it was finally on Saturday that I decided to venture into Grimaldi's Coal Oven Pizzeria at The Palazzo, and sporting a coupon that affords one free Large Pizza with one topping (up to $18) it was only after a bizarre incident at the front desk that I found seating in the restaurant's main room, a request specifically made in order to watch the pizza makers at work without being exposed to the two-tops dotting the shopping mall's faux-patio.

Having more than once been steered away from the Brooklyn Bridge original by New Yorkers whose palates I trust, it was just after 3:00 that I arrived at Grimaldi's front stand and first refusing a seat at the bar, then basically having to demand to not be seated out front despite the restaurant only being 1/8 full, it was at a small table of my choosing that I finally relaxed, a young woman named Angie who preferred to call me ""buddy"" throughout the stay providing obligatory service, though often letting me see the bottom of my water glass.

Undoubtedly pegging me a tourist, and likely also put-off by the coupon which must be presented prior to placing an order, suffice it to say that my small table was low-priority compared to those drinking wine and ordering appetizers around me, but amused enough bby action in the kitchen and Martin, Sinatra, etc soundtrack above it really wasn't too much a bother, the fifteen minute prep-time for my pie whizzing past and the resultant cracker-crisp disk landing before me with cheese still bubbling and crust lightly charred.

Obviously not the artisan pies offered by Neapolitan spots in town, but at the same time using quality ingredients including whole milk Mozzarella and their own signature sauces brought in direct from New York it should come as no surprise that the coal-oven crust is where Grimaldi's makes its mark, and with good blister, great chew, and just enough thickness to hold up to toppings without being sloppy the flavor profile of both halves was good, if not great - the red sauce trending a bit too sweet for my palate while the white was nicely tinged with garlic, the artichoke hearts a bit overpriced at $4 however, and in desperate need of salt or some marinade.

Boxing up two red slices, as well as two slices of white, and later donating them to a trio of guys with a sign indicating ""anything helps"" en route to Caesars', it seemed only fair to give desserts a try considering the complimentary pie, and with the fresh-piped cannoli far out-showing the soggy slop served at celebrated Carlo's Bakery just a few steps away it is unfortunate that neither the cocoa-heavy tiramisu or overly-sweetened cheesecake could ascend to such heights, the $10 trio a good enough deal for scaled down portions, though if left to do it again I'd simply invest the $4.50 in the plate of two-cannolis, and save the rest for somewhere else.

Better than many local purveyors of the ""New York Slice,"" and served up in splashy environs that clearly cost the restaurant high rent, there are simply far better places for pizza in Sin City than Grimaldi's - several even under the same roof.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,2,VLWRO1UJiH6xxgAA9rr1_A

So they have personal, medium, and large; we opted for the large at ($18).  You select your toppings starting at ($2) each; we chose the fresh garlic and Italian sausage.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#STZXp7K9wnVPNTo4mWOYFw This is probably one of the few times I've had NY style crust, and WHOA it tastes so delicious, especially when it's hot and the handmade (!) mozzarella is so melty, creamy, and cheesy.  There were nice, soft tomato chunks in the pizza sauce.

I don't know how they make salads so good, because the lettuce was cut into SMALL bite-sized pieces, dewy but not too wet, and the caesar dressing was perfectly spicy and peppery.  Topped with fresh parmesan cheese... YEAH A VERY GOOD SALAD.

I love thin crust New York style pizza but the sauce was skimpy and overall, the pizza just didn't have enough flavor.  My husband is not very picky when it comes to pizza so I was surprised that he didn't like it either.  My mom got her own pizza and doesn't like a lot of sauce but commented that it appeared as though her pizza had no sauce.

On my last visit, three of us girls ordered a large pizza - it was too much food and we ended up with some leftovers.

There are a ton of good options, but we were looking for something quick and relatively cheap. We almost settled for the food court inside the Grand Canal Shoppes ($10 ish dollars per person), but luckily we opted for something better. 

Grimaldi's is located near the Wynn pedestrian bridge entrance to the Palazzo. It's on the upper level with Palazzo's shopping area. We were quickly seated in the main dining room, which had an open look into the pizza kitchen where you can see the cooks baking your coal fired pizzas. We ordered a large pizza (18"" - 8 slices) with Italian sausage and mushrooms. The pizza was very tasty - I particularly liked the flavorful sausage and the red sauce. 

The large size is $16, with each additional topping ranging from $2-$4.

5514996,2013-09-11,8,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"Man, after seeing all of these four and five star reviews, I feel like I must have really missed something.  I had heard of Grimaldi's and planned on trying them when I make it out to NY, but I was more than happy to check out their Palazzo location when our group of seven dropped in for lunch.  Legit NY pizza in Vegas?  Sure, why not?

Unlike a lot of pizza restaurants, Grimaldi's menu doesn't include any preset combinations or house specials (though they also offer salads and calzones).  Instead, you first choose the size and sauce base you want (regular, white with garlic, and pesto), then add on whatever toppings you like.  With two dozen to choose from (ranging from $2-$5 each), the possibilities are nearly endless!

After taking our server's recommendation for a small (it's perfect for two), my friend and I decided to share a Small White Pizza with Garlic ($16) and topped it with Italian Sausage (+$2), Mushrooms (+$2), and Green Peppers (+$2).  As far as taste goes, the pizza wasn't bad.  The toppings were decent and plentiful, and the white garlic sauce was solid.  Unfortunately though, I thought the crust/dough was disappointing.  While I liked how it was on the thin side, I wasn't a fan of the taste (somewhat bland) or the texture - neither doughy nor crispy and almost wafer like (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=qXMjD_wj8bWP8TVUdoUpcQ#KxHxBodbVP3RZ6GHtw2fAw).

In addition to our own, I also got to try a slice of my other friend's Personal Regular ($9) with Anchovies (+$2), Green Peppers (+$2), and Jalapeno (+$2).  The crust on his was slightly better, but the tomato sauce didn't do it for me (I generally prefer white sauce pizzas).  And while his mix of toppings may seem odd, they actually worked okay despite the anchovies being pretty salty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=qXMjD_wj8bWP8TVUdoUpcQ#79Jq5QbDxfeb3U5zJ8Gk9Q).

Even though the pizza didn't do it for me, I can sort of see why Grimaldi's is so highly received.  Given their reputation, the Yelp reviews, and the apparent superiority of their original locations, I'll give Grimaldi's another chance when I'm in NY.  With lower expectations, perhaps their Brooklyn bridge location will do the trick.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,11,9,3,T_QeMpTK9HQUjN0XH_BUzw

We decided on the large 18in pizza with chicken sausage and mushrooms. Then, ordered a carafe of their house red wine for $15. The wine was not very good on its own, but will likely pair nicely with the pizza.

When it arrived, the pizza looked really tasty and couldn't wait to take a bite. I was in pizza heaven with the first taste. The crust was thin and some what chewy. Then, the sweet and somewhat spicy sauce was added to the crust in mindful clusters, no haphazard slopping on of sauce here. The yummy mozzarella was applied in a similar manner. Lastly, the chicken sausage added a delicious meaty and spicy fennel note.

I was right, the marginal carafe wine really paired nicely with the pie by bringing out the spicy fennel and cutting through the cheesy mozzarella.

Grimaldi's, I must confess, your pizza, in my humble opinion, is easily the best in Las Vegas, possibly my favorite of all time. Can't wait for my next visit to pizza nirvana.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,0,1,5,Y58_j0A5n4KXiCWsb8KPyA

5601676,2015-10-12,7,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"Over the course of my Vegas trips with the No1DP I've seen people carrying pizza boxes from Grimaldi's. The No1DP, being a huge fan of NY-style pizza, never fails to get a slice every time he's in the area. It not only serves up a good slice but its location just outside the entrance to the Venetian|Palazzo complex is a short walk from the hotel the No1DP is staying (usually the Palazzo or Encore). I finally got a chance to eat here as an alternative to another nearby restaurant as I though this place would serve a no-frills yet delicious meal shortly before my flight.

CONCEPT: Grimaldi's Pizza is known for its signature coal-burning oven, specifically anthracite coal. It burns more cleanly than gas or wood and the oven reaches to 1200F. Supposedly the water system is specifically designed to emulate NY-style water that is used in making authentic NY-style pizza dough (thin and crispy).

VENUE: Grimaldi's is close to the entrance of the Venetian|Palazzo when coming from the bridge that connects the hotel complex with the Wynn/Encore. There was plenty of indoor seating on a Sunday night. They are not truly affiliated with the Palazzo so they cannot use resort credit/comps to pay for the bill. 

SERVICE: Our service for the most part was attentive except at the end where she didn't catch that we wanted tiramisu to go.

We opted for the house salad with mozzarella addition (romaine lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms, green olives, vinaigrette dressing, $6/small).  The bowl was generous with its non-lettuce toppings and certain veggies such as cherry tomatoes, red onion and olives tasted fresh. I think I got full quite quickly due to the veggies.

The No1DP is a traditionalist - he wants his pizza with tomato sauce (I gently suggested to try pesto or white pie with garlic to no avail) so we got the small pizza (16 inches - 6 slices, serves 2-3 people, $14). For toppings we got pepperoni ($3), sausage ($3), mushrooms ($2), green bell peppers ($2) and onions ($2). The crust was thin and crispy and the cheese oozed out of the slice. Pepperonis were small and crunchy, mushrooms were juicy and there was a good amount of onions. The big perk about these pies is that they are easily customizable to diner's preferences though there are certain pre-made pies available.

One big perk was that the No1DP and I technically paid with resort winnings. Were able to pay for this meal with our modest $58 we won from betting the outside track on roulette then converted it to cash. Thanks Palazzo.

This is our preferred pizza place on the Venetian|Palazzo side of the Strip (Secret Pizza at the Cosmo is our preferred pizza place on the other side as I see more than a handful of people carrying Secret Pizza boxes)",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,11,11,4,iwk4cYvGsTI4kzl1_y45VQ

My first ever encounter with Grimaldi's was on the second level of the Palazzo / Venetian Resort & Casino on the strip. My mother, sister and I stumbled upon it when we were shopping. The 3 of us split a small ceasar salad and a pepperoni pie! It was fantastic. So when I received an email for a free pizza on my birthday from Grimaldi's I was quick to jump on the chance to give them another try.

This time we visited their store in Henderson. It's located in a quiet shopping center just off the 215. We opted to sit outside at their bar. Although it was July and pretty warm, we stayed cool under their misting system. 

They had a nice selection of beer, with the classics and a few micro brews. I went with a Sam Adam's Summer Ale, one of my favorites. We ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza and while we were waiting we were entertained by the bartender. She was hysterical and provided us with exceptional service.

Just like my first trip to Grimaldi's at the Venetian/Palazzo, their pizza was exceptional! They are consistently good pizza that takes me back to the east coast. 

If you want to score a free pizza, like I did this trip, be sure to sign up for their mailing list. As I mentioned in my Las Vegas Birthday Freebies post, they will email you a coupon for a free pizza for your Birthday!",5_rrJ1471iMsnjSrZ2gtfw,1,0,5,Y-mTPARtNDdeC3rcRYoFLA

5656141,2013-06-26,1,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"I had this pizza in Brooklyn and thought it was the BEST pizza I've ever tasted. So we had to try this spot when we were in town in Vegas. This is located at Palazzo on the second floor. There was NO wait when we went around 2pm for lunch on a Sunday. Lots of space with a bar. I couldn't bring my fat tuesday in but they were kind enough to store it in the fridge for me. 

So we ordered a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. Very tasty and good upon the first bite! We asked for the garlic powder and added to our pizza which made it taste a little better, but the garlic powder wasn't as strong as what we had in NY. I have to agree that the pizza was delicious, but it wasn't as good as what we had in Brooklyn's for some reason. It took about 20minutes for the pizza to come out. We also ordered a personal size pizza with white sauce. I didn't taste it but my friends did and agreed it wasn't as good as the regular pizza. 

The service was okay, the server could put a smile on his face at least. I heard the less toppings you put, the better. Don't overload your pizza! I recommend regular pizza with tomato sauce with basil. A side story: my bf left his credit card here but they were kind enough to keep it until we picked it up. Thanks! 4 stars for excellent pizza and no wait! I highly recommend this spot if you're craving NY style pizzas.",Qk3jMHizziXjj7jfwVO1Sw,2,3,4,AXDBI3tDaMrt14766j6Ufg

First, the place is hard to find! It's all the way in the back corner of the Shops of the Palazzio. It's not a place you can stumble upon.. you have to go actively looking for it. We came for lunch on a Sunday and the place was empty. The atmosphere is great, space is ample and relatively clean-- great place for larger parties. The service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and very thorough when taking our order. 

The pizza was ok, not as amazing as I expected it to be. The tomato sauce was watered down and the pizza crust was really soggy, making it really hard to eat. The calzones on the other hand were delicious-- stuffed with toppings w/ a side of marinara for dipping. 

Not sure if I'll be back, as it's not in the most convent location and the pizza is eh ok. I'm a huge pizza nut though, so if I don't find a better pizza joint on the strip, I'll be more than willing to give Grimaldi's a second try.",tLSYvW5kR4zKds6ez-Yn1A,0,0,3,-frzTOxWDIQj6nOrAV-6lQ

If you like thin crust pizza. This will be your heaven. The toppings and sauces and the way they cook it is like no other. It's just so delicious.

Tips:
-Open till 2AM.
- You can order special sauce w/ your pizza but I wouldn't recommend it.  The sauce is a bit too sweet; it actually drowns out the flavor of your toppings and makes everything taste the same.",pzwPuIDTpsd_ykGJ0CtuCg,4,1,5,C8bnzWNtqamv-FkRSKWhTA

That's crazy - it's a ton of food, fed 7 with some left over, and during the opening weekend of the NCAA tournament, it was a great way to lounge in the room and get fat while screaming at the television. Just too bad it's a bit of a walk from the Venetian and Venezia towers.

We had a pepperoni and mushroom, an Italian sausage and roasted red pepper, and a white pizza with pesto. All were good, with chewy crust and plentiful toppings. I liked their red sauce, and the white pizza was good, although heavy on the garlic. They did list garlic specifically, so I'm not blaming them, but it's not my thing, as you may or may not know.

Our group of 6 came on a Saturday afternoon, and were seated right away. Damon was very friendly and suggested right off the bat that we get a small salad to share and The Don (the restaurant's must-have pizza). Damon says Grimaldi's LV is known for their salad and pizza, which they meticulously make to perfection. We ended up ordering a small spinach gorgonzola salad and large The Don and a large pizza with pesto, artichoke, and mushrooms on it. The salad was delicious and the small size was a perfect sample size for our group of 6. The pizzas came out in about 15-20 min. The Don impressed everyone, as the crust was baked to perfection and the toppings were amazing. I was so taken aback by the explosion of flavor in the italian sausage. I would put those bad boys in any Italian dish, whether it be pizza, pasta, or a sub, and call it a day. Our custom built pesto pizza was solid as well, but definitely not as memorable as The Don.

Overall, Grimaldi's LV on its own is a solid 4 star establishment. Of course, it doesn't compare to Brooklyn's flagship.

When we asked our server, he said that was extra cheese. She asked to speak to a manager and he said the same thing. Sorry, I'm not picky or anything but I wouldn't have accepted that as being extra cheese. 

I'm an easy person to please so for someone to piss me off at a restaurant is pretty rare. I wish I would have gotten the girls name because her people skills need some work.

Definitely recommend Grimaldi's!",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,1,0,4,F_bVVRL4UjwJ0hnnAb70kA
5911541,2014-02-03,0,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"This review is for Grimaldi's in general. Having been to the original Brooklyn location, having Grimaldi's within a two hour drive always calls for a visit every time we're in the Las Vegas area. 
      Since we discovered that Grimaldi's is here in Vegas, we've been to three of the four locations and have not been disappointed with the food or the service. 
     The pizza is as close as to what I remembered in New York. Like any pizza place, choose your favorites but definitely try the white with garlic pizza n your choice of toppings. Ricotta cheese is also a must. 
    If you're a thin crust lover, you'll love Grimaldi's.",TX9sluY-YVY4iZrJmg26fQ,4,0,5,Cp9uGcAhIkR2ivZ9RSSxdw

Very good service. Very good pizza. (Huge pizza). Nice thin crust with great flavor from the brick oven. 

We got traditional with onions, bacon and kalamata olives and split the spinach salad. Soooo good. Would eat here a lot if I were local.",jN3OxPVS0kNKpIhamUCTTg,1,0,5,9mQscNBfGncjTbKjEC_MMA
5946659,2013-04-13,0,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"Amazing hand-tossed pizza! Went here after a long night (like every night is in Vegas) and needed a hangover cure. Their pizza sizes are not like regular sized. A small sized pizza has 6 decently sized slices that are topped well! We got a small sausage and pepperoni pizza, and it was SO good! Their cheese and pizza sauce were delicious, and the oven baked thin crust was great too! It's reasonably priced too, at least compared to vegas prices. For the small pizzal with 2 toppings it was about $20. Very friendly staff, and the service was ok. Definitely suggest trying this place out! 

TLDR: Good large portion pizza's at a reasonable price!",fU1uqrYsOwy54m_GhJKpWQ,0,0,4,VMaoQ_6myXTZXRVNSQwlWw

The service is always great, all of the staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. It can get busy during convention time, but rarely do I have to wait for a table. 
The spinach salad with bacon is delicious. I always order a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. I've tried the calzones and those are great as well. Their crust is amazing. So you can never go wrong. 
I noticed they do have some gluten free options available, so that's great for those with gluten intolerance.

But it is not only the quality of the pizza. Grimaldi's is very nicely decorated, offers a good selection of wines and beers (some craft beers) and service was impeccable.

The menu is varied and the pizza was delicious. I ate more than I thought I could eat.",llY1G684FXzXCFqbDuqCXg,0,0,5,UxP7mZU9MAiKhSIi4j_8Yg

If i wanted to read a novel, i'd read my harry potter books. So this place is simple and delicious. Our bartender was very patient and tentative to our every need...well to my friends every need and was he needy! We got a small pizza which was bigger than i expected! Its good for 2-3 people. We ordered the house salad which was soo good. They really made a simple salad taste scrumcious! It was one of the best house salads i've ever had. The ingredients on the pizza were fresh.

Margherita Pizza

The PERFECT pizza. Real cheese not that oily manufactured goo. CRUNCH, crunch, crunch goes the crust. No sag. Not soggy. Just a tang of sauce.  

BBBOOOO:
Why is good pizza so hard to find. New York has ruined pizza for this LA girl. Now my husband has to cook pizza for me in the BBQ or we go to Vegas cause that's still closer than the the good ol big apple.

You've gotta try it & if you are coming back to LA send me a message & please bring me some to go.",Ky6a4-HiBRcqXi2TpsORvQ,0,1,5,keMUKlMGTSVZr1f1yqrjSQ

5978143,2012-12-27,0,YQ--LJ7pvjiDSqNv0TuKTQ,"More of a 3.5, but after some consideration I couldn't put it at the 4 star level.

Food: Pizzas duh! There's a solid amount of choices you can make when it comes to ordering your pizza. White Sauce, Red Sauce, Garlic, etc... Plenty of different toppings that are authentic and taste amazing. I personally enjoyed the Large Red with Pepperoni and Mushrooms.

Service: Pretty standard. Waitresses were quick and friendly, didn't really have a problem with them.

Atmosphere: Legitly decorated. Feels like a nice pizza place due to it's old-school photographs and table setting. Loved it.

Price: Between the 8 guys that went there, we paid around $10-12 each for a total of 3 Large pizzas. For Vegas that's pretty good especially when you're eating specialty food!

Overall Opinion: I thought this place was pretty up to par, but honestly nothing stood out enough for me to fall in love with this place. The food is great, the service was good, the atmosphere was nice, but nothing was there that screamed out ""I GOTTA COME BACK FOR THIS"".",yt0dQFgi9HCuDySmBj6feA,0,0,3,FmqCXKxjzrXg4VqyL2FczA

We were disappointed at first, but that disappointment disappeared as I discovered Grimaldi's was at the Grand Canal Shops on our way back to the hotel. 

I wasn't able to try the Grimaldi's when I was in NYC yet, so we rallied on over for one of my best NY style pizza experiences in my life for the following reasons
1) Ingredients were delicious
2) Marinara sauce was incredible
3) Bread was light, thin, and slightly crispy around the edges.

In a way, I'm glad Tacos El Gordo wasn't available or I wouldn't have had the time to check this place out.",0f_0XfO2qcgNwSJAHwfR9g,4,1,5,QQPDhRcm1xsHVc2-Sw4gDQ
