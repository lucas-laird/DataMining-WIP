I'm on bed rest so I have more than enough time to pick a place for delivery and read all the reviews. I placed my order at 12:41pm through eat24 and my food arrived at 1:05pm hot and fresh. I can't comment on the customer service since I had limited contact with anyone besides the driver. It was a quick exchange which I enjoyed. 

I had a salad and the Cajun shrimp linguine and it was amazing!!!! The pasta sauce was tasty and full of shrimp. If I had to complain my garlic bread was a little dark but it did not taste burnt so I can't say it was a bad thing. I also didn't like the additional charge for the dressing but that is becoming very common with smaller restaurants.

Besides all of that, I can't wait to try the other dishes they offer. Good place.",WdWVY55-cdXiJf_xVreQwQ,0,0,5,pRr1x-kGJ87-uRFhd0p9PQ

I went here to bring home great food to my family for dinner and what a wasted experience/evening because of a NEXTDOOR POSTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They moved recently and the GPS brought me to their old location (I'm new here). 

They gave me a incomplete order. 

They argued with me on the phone and was rude. 

I went back and got a partial refund not including my gratuity. What an inconvenience. They offered for a future replacement dish like I want to give more money to them!?! 

The cashier was nice in person before and after but not on the phone. She apologized. 

I asked to speak to the manager and they refused. They were stuffing their faces. No consideration of my future business. 

I then decided to yell out to the back in front of all the dining guests...

""CONGRATULATIONS, YOU LOST MY BUSINESS""

I pardon my self to the guests as they were in shock to consider what they might have to go through in the near future. 

I will keep sharing my story and protest outside when possible to prevent other people from experiencing what I did and make Lino's treat their customers better! 

$53 ... what a drag!

There are PLENTY of the places to eat. Last time I listened to a neighbor for a suggestion.",UZAaCkpb8FdMDmx-bkMxCQ,0,0,1,XCqsCJug7Jt4OdZJ2pVXrg

My friend wanted the share what she described as ""the best pastrami sandwich ever"".  I was skeptical (as I've some pretty amazing food)  but she was right.  Hands down the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had.  I would drive from anywhere in Las Vegas to eat this again.

The place is in a little strip mall and it kinda screams ""hole in the wall"".  Inside though, it was full of charm and soft lighting.  I'd be happy to take a girl here on a weeknight dinner date.

Even paying extra didn't get me much meat, so I was paying for mostly the bun it was on. The service was very slow and nobody else was in there at the time. It was the height of the lunch hour too. Then yesterday(Nov. 2, 2011)  my daughter and her step sister went there for lunch. When it came time to pay they had a gift certificate and the owner wouldn't honor it. He was actually yelling in my daughter's face and told her that he wouldn't accept that form of payment and that he'd call the cops if she didn't pay the bill, because he was not going to honor the gift card that she had purchased at that restaurant! Finally after rudely and unprofessionally acting that way, the girls were going to call the cops themselves and then the owner relented and let them pay with the gift card.

That's all they have going.( a little on the ""doughy"" side though) Our first visit we ate at the restaurant, I had a salad so not much to screw up. My boyfriend had the tortellini, No complaints. So we decided to order in a couple weeks later. We ordered a pizza, it wasn't the best but It was decent. I had asked for 3 sides of ranch that we never got. Lets say I wasn't thrilled but decided to order again from them 2 days ago, big mistake. We ordered a calzone, anitpasto salad and garlic knots. Again, asking for ranch. I ordered through an app called Eat24, so after i submitted the order I called just to verify I would be receiving the ranch this time. The girl who answered was very rude, and told me to call back in 5 minutes because she was too busy. I guess that should have been my first clue.. So I called back 10 minutes later as not to disturb anyone at their job again, and the man rudely informed me "" the ranch cost extra you know"" I said yes, I am aware, I'd still like them please. I also asked for extra dressing which seemed to annoy him. When the food finally came (50 mins later, and we live across the street) the delivery driver handed it to me in a box and said oh, I need that back.. When we sat down I saw I had gotten my ranch and was happy... Until I opened it. I dont know about you but I have never been to an italian restaurant with bad ranch.. This goes beyond the word bad. It was like a gelatin almost. It tasted worst than anything I have ever had, Maybe like they bought the generic grocery store bottle and poured it into cups, whatever the case it was awful and I wanted to cry at this point. Our calzone did not come with Marinara sauce, again something I have never experienced. The salad dressing was called Italian, but I am not sure what it was. Mainly olive oil. Worst salad Ive ever had. The calzone was small and had little meat in it. ( we normally order from Angelinas and ALWAYS are happy, they stuff their calzones full of meats). However we ate, because we were hungry. I was up all night sick afterwords.. Such a terrible experience from a place I had such high hopes for.",LM3UNGBmufJxjxdVbAr6DQ,3,0,2,iTH7dlq-36AHIrh7elpYJw

Showed up on a Wednesday night around 7:30 and was instantly turned off by the elevator music being played and I'm not talking quality classical music.... Anyways, the restaurant was pretty empty, and we were seated right away. Let's get right into it:

Chicken tenders...actually came out with sauce all over them...if we wanted that wouldn't we have ordered buffalo wings (which is on the menu)?? I'm not sure, but when she asked what flavor we wanted I guess it was my fault for assuming it would be a dip on the side.

Garden salad.... was literally cut up lettuce with tomatoes croutons..nothing else (as expected). 

Chicken Alfredo... HORRIBLE. My god, this is one of my favorite pastas...and this place managed to butcher it. Chicken was tough and I've had better alfredo sauce out of a $2 jar. Also, the portion was pretty small for the $14 price tag.

Cheese Pizza....Not enough Cheese, and again..no flavor.

Everyone was very friendly and there were several customers eating dinner when I was there that seemed to be regulars.

The food was delicious! I am not normally a fan of pasta salad, because most restaurants drown it in mayonnaise, but it was very good. 

The pastrami sandwich is set up like a traditional sub as opposed to just the meat, pickles, and mustard. It was also very good and I would definately order it again.

The dining room was pretty empty with only a few other tables, so we were seated immediately. I asked for a high chair only to find out they only have one and it was being used. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant that only had one highchair. I was annoyed because have you ever tried to eat a meal with a squirmy toddler on your lap who wants to touch everything? Yeah, not fun. Luckily the other party who was using the chair was almost finished, so we stuck it out. Owner if you are reading, please invest in a few more high chairs, because one just isn't enough! 

It took a while for our server to come around but when she did she was very nice. Once we ordered, it took a while for the food to come out which was expected. A few people ordered salads so they came out first. My grandma ordered the antipasto salad which is supposed to be for one person, but it was a decent size so we were all able to have a few bites. The salad was very good. It had salami, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and warm mushrooms which I thought was odd. Here are all these cold ingredients and then some hot shrooms, but whatever it still tasted good. The dressing they use on the salad is tasty as well. They also brought out hot garlic bread which was killer!! I love a good garlic bread and this one did not disappoint. 

When our meals finally came out, we all dug right in. The portions are huge and definitely enough for leftovers. I ordered the shrimp alfredo and it was delicious. There was a good amount of shrimp in the dish, and a lot of creamy alfredo sauce which I appreciated because alfredo dishes tend to be dry if there isn't enough sauce. My boyfriend got the chicken parmigiana which was very good as well. I also got to try the meatballs, and the Spaghetti ala olio which is yummy. It's spaghetti with olive oil, garlic, broccoli and sun dried tomatoes. It has a ton of flavor and really good. I think all of the food here is good but the service is tad slow and considering how slow they were, that is something that could be improved on.

We ordered garlic knots, mozzarella sticks and pepperoni/sausage pizza. Everything was amazing. The garlic knots were perfect. The mozzarella sticks had so much flavor and the pizza was great. We are moving to that side of town next week and we will be back a lot.

I had the Eggplant Parmigiano which I did feel had complex flavors. I was also surprised with the generosity of the side of spaghetti which was well cooked. I really enjoyed it!

My companion had the Mostaccioli Ala Lino. He chose to have the meat sauce. The problem with this dish was three fold: there wasn't much meat in the dish even though he ordered meat sauce; there wasn't enough sauce which left the pasta dry and it was ordinary in that I could have made it at home.

The meat balls had a bit too much filler and not enough flavor. 

The bread that comes to the table was out of this world. The whip cream that came with cheese cake was incredible. 

The service was the best I have experienced in quite a while.

But the pizza itself is nice, thick, and could quite possibly double for a pizza pie made from the hands of Jesus (If you believe in that kind of thing).

Before you visit Lino's, MAKE SURE THEY ARE OPEN. the first few times I went to Lino's before 4 pm on a weekday I was turned around pizza-less. Luckily for them the prices were good enough for me to try back (although they recently raised their prices around 10 percent on most items). What is the world coming to? Gas prices now LINO??!!

We've tried almost everything on their menu and, of course, we have our favorites. Their pizza is amazing, the pasta is perfect, and their subs are a cut above! 

Must try's: 
Pizza (of course)
The MEATBALLS!!
Linguine with Clam Sauce
Cheesesteak sub 
Calamari 
Really good chicken wings, too!!
Don't forget dessert: TIRAMISU 

Anyhow, I think you get what I'm saying... Lino's is our #1 go to when we want authentic Italian, don't feel like cooking, or just in the mood for pizza &/or wings.

5218208,2017-06-02,0,OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA,"I have enjoyed dining at Lino's, along with my large extended family, since they opened over 30-yrs. ago in my hometown of Huntington Beach, Calif. When they relocated to their current location on N. Tenaya Way fourteen or so years ago, i simply NEEDED to stop in when i next visited Las Vegas. Despite smaller restaurant space & absent beer & wine service, the food quality & portions remained the same - at the same, very reasonable price. THIS review was written June 1, 2017, & effective in 1-2 months, Lino's will relocate again - this time to a larger, 70-seat capacity unit (adjacent to 'Capriotti's Sandwich Shop' on W. Azure Dr.), and will INCLUDE beer & wine sales! This should only help punctuate an already great culinary experience. If you wish to get away from the Las Vegas rat race, with no gaming, & simply enjoy an intimate, quiet dinner with family &/or friends, i HIGHLY recommend Lino's! The staff is very friendly, and while the menu is not super-extensive, there are plenty of wonderful selections. Try their ricotta-STUFFED manicotti, with either their signature homemade marinara or meat sauce, unique garlic bread, & house dressing (warm italiano with warm mushrooms!) on your salad. The homemade(!) cheese ravioli is served in the traditional manner with premium-quality ricotta cheese. And, their pizza does not disappoint. Tired of tasteless crust + low-grade & small cheese portions on your pizza? Say good-bye to that! Indeed, ALL food ingredients are premium quality. Lino's simply does not skimp on quality. Those that have not dined at Lino's are missing out on great Italian food, at reasonable prices, in a cozy & safe environment. Now, who doesn't want to experience something like that!?",p4XwE8JC7JGDtx9wWUK71A,1,0,5,ffymQBlcADGV3qefweKKUg

5300165,2010-09-07,0,OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA,"I had a really hard time deciding on four or five stars for Lino's. I've only had lunch there twice and each time have enjoyed their pizza special (I THINK it's $4.40 for two slices of cheese and a drink, .40 cents extra per topping per slice), my last lunch was pepperoni and mushroom with a pibb. My drink was never empty, and the extra toppings were well worth the cost, they even put a little extra cheese on there.

   I'm not exactly sure what style you would call it, definitely not thin enough to be NY yet had a perfectly toasted crust. I wouldn't think Chicago would be apt as it wasn't as thick as I would imagine. Whatever you want to call it I believe you have to call it delicious. 

The dining area is quite small and well decorated with a nicely kept fish tank and dark paint/carpet giving it a cozy feel, the string outdoor lights around the dining are a nice touch to this small area. 

As wonderful as my lunches there have been I don't feel comfortable giving it a full five stars before I try their dinners and a few other items off the menu. Based on what I've experienced so far this seems like a forgone conclusion but it gives me a good excuse to return :-)",FbDqt_QhPnWv4FsU9hkkvg,0,0,4,G3WXxHFhYsd3rV_5Tub0kw

The inside was cute and cozy with framed black and white pics of old Hollywood celebrities adorning the walls. We ordered the fettuccine carbonara, eggplant parm, fettuccine alfredo, garden salad, and garlic knots. The portions were plentiful and the food was hot! By the time I got it home the eggplant parm was a bit soggy. I really missed the crispness of the breading but the taste was spot on. The carbonara was absolutely the star dish...with the Canadian bacon adding just the right amount of saltiness to the garlic and cream laden sauce. The pasta came with garlic bread too, which was exactly what good garlic bread should be. It was buttery with garlic and herbs and toasted. The fettuccine alfredo was ok, not a lot of flavor but my kid loved it. I saw on the app they deliver but I didn't want to wait for the 45 minutes it would take to get to my house.

I arrived at the restaurant at 8 and there was nobody in the place, except a couple guys - I think they were getting food to go. The person I came here with and I were seated next to the fish tank. They had the same kind of crazy fish (lionfish) in the tank that was in one of my favorite movies, Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo. Ha!
 
My dining partner ordered the calzone with sausage and pepperoni ($7.75.) I tried some and it was delicious. I had the Philly cheesesteak ($6.50), mainly because I always order that if it's on the menu. Had the regular size with peppers, onions and mushrooms (which costs extra.) The regular size was way more than enough for me. I'm pretty sure my sandwich was less than $7 which wasn't bad at all.

The waitress was attentive and kept our glasses full. My one problem was that while we were finishing, they were turning off the lights in the place - we were out at 8:54 so, yeah, that's annoying because I felt rushed, as if everyone was waiting for me to cram my food down so they could get home.

After looking up reviews on yelp, I vowed to sample its classic Italian offerings: both pasta and pizza.  In two outings spread a month apart, I accomplished this, and will surely be back for more.  

On the first encounter, Fried Mozzarella Sticks were gooey with cheese, complimentary Garlic Bread was soft, buttery, and addictive.  Fettuccine Carbonara with Canadian Bacon, garlic, olive oil, cream, and egg with Parmigiano Cheese was creamy, hot, and satisfying.  And Diane's 16-inch Canadian Bacon Pizza with extra cheese was decidedly cheesy and yummy: a top grade New York style specimen.

On the second visit I enjoyed a small but nevertheless large Antipasti Salad with desirable curls of tasty Mozzarella Cheese, and plenty of Italian cold cuts, tomato wedges, and greens for more than one diner.  A bowl of homemade Pasta Fagioli was very good.  And, although I am very picky about my pizza--since I only eat it once every two months (a longtime habit to keep my cholesterol low and at bay), and thus don't want to waste the experience on an inferior pie, my 16-inch New York style Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Sausage, and Sliced Tomatoes Pizza definitely made the cut as a top-grade variety.

5975064,2017-11-09,0,OYaL_-uxBCgrE94uNQ4VCA,"The pizza is amazing (quite possibly the best in Las Vegas), but my last experience with them was not good.

We decided to try the new location for ""dine in"" service, since we hadn't eaten there in years (we normally just pick up pizza).

Anyway, we walked in and found ourselves in  the large waiting area. There were a couple of employees near the register who appeared to be just carrying on a conversation. There was no ""Please Wait To Be Seated"" sign, so we weren't sure where to stand. 

After a few minutes, the gal by the register acknowledges us and asks us if we are waiting to be seated. So, we told her that we were (the dining room was pretty crowded) and she sees a table and motions us to follow her.

But, instead of actually seating us at one if the two empty tables, she starts taking another table's order. So, we were left standing in the middle of the dining room, wondering if we should sit at the empty table. Then, she notices a ""Reserved"" sign on the empty table and tells us that she didn't realize that the table was reserved and asks us to wait in the waiting area.

So, we went back into the waiting area and sat down in the chairs there. While we are again waiting for a table, another family walks in and a different waitress asks them if they are dining in (without asking us if we are waiting for a table). She then tells them that the ""Reserved"" table is actually not reserved and motions over to them to seat them at that table.

Well, at this point my wife decides to intervene and let the second server know that we were there before them. It was kind of embarrassing to have to intervene, but we were there first, and pretty hungry at this point.

So, the second server seats us at the formerly-""reserved"" table without menus. So, we were sitting there for like 5 minutes and no one comes back to acknowledge us, give us menus, or even take a drink order.

So, we just decided to leave (I was pretty pissed off, at this point). It's unfortunate that we decided to leave, because I really do like their food. But, I'd rather give my business to a place where the left hand knows what the right hand is doing. It was a really frustrating experience and it made me lose my appetite.
