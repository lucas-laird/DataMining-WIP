I suppose being sober in the cosmopolitan at that time next to the exit of one of the strips most popular clubs doesnt help.

It was so good. the new york thin crust and the mounds of ricotta...just a taste explosion in your mouf. 

Only thing was it cost quite a bit...30 bucks to be more specific. But it was worth it...it was vegas...and what ever..splurge. 

Next day went back and got a slice of classic peperoni. Still...super great and was really good. 

Soda and beer are served in red cups (same ones u buy at local costco or wherever) and its free refills (soda). i dont know what would happen if you brought your own from pre gaming in your hotel...

But, on the day I was leaving Las Vegas I wanted something quick and filling to hold me over until I got back to Phoenix and I hunted this place down.

I guess when The Cosmopolitan first opened it was fun finding this ""hidden"" place. But, the word it out and other yelpers have even posted photos of the hallway to look for.  However, if you aren't paying attention and maybe you're a bit hung over it would be possible to walk right past it.

For us, it was part of our Las Vegas bucket list. So this place is not so secret, it's a matter of fact pretty easy to find, tucked away in a corner, third floor at the Cosmopolitan. Both my husband and I ordered the pepperoni pizza. The pizza was just ok and that's not saying much since we were sort of hungry. After leaving there we went to In and Out to complete our late night dining experience.

Best way to describe the pizza, just think Sbarro's when you were 13 years old and your mom dropped you off at the mall. You and your friends having a Sbarro's pepperoni pizza was a fun experience and tasted pretty good. However, here are some differences, Secret Pizza is a bit more greasy, more expensive, your old friends aren't there, and less sitting space than at the mall.

They really do try their best to offer the ""cool"" factor, and what could be cooler than a pinball machine and old record covers on the wall as you walk in. For this place, once you have done it, the odds are you won't be back. But a fun thing to do anyhow if you happen to be at the Cosmopolitan. It will set you back about $10.00 for two slices of pepperoni pizza, and they have a water cooler, so no need to buy a soda. Also it is an interesting place to people watch.

My friends and I waited in line, and they managed to order their pizzas. I was behind them, and the guy taking orders/making pizza looked me over and went on to the next person. I figured I'd have my order taken at the cashier, but no dice. When I got to the cashier, she asked me what I'd ordered, and when I told her nothing yet, she looked to the pizza guy. Dude had the gall to say I'd cut in line? Maybe he missed the fact that a friend of mine ahead of me handed me a water bottle as they were paying for their order. Not sure what his deal was, but my business is better spent elsewhere. Took them about an hour to make the pizzas, too- way too long for anyone impatiently waiting to get their grub on. I'm sure they'll make their money off of other customers coming back from clubs drunk.

Its is really not that tough to find if you ask around. They were out of the white pizza which I really wanted to try. Would not be ready for 20 minutes and I am not a patient person when it comes to food.

Wife and I ordered 2 slices each which came out to $5 a slice. We had the plain peperroni and chesse, and the mushroom with sausage pizza. Haaaaaaleluya....Haaaaaaaleluya! Yeah that is what I heard in the background as I took my first bites. Seriously excellent tasting. I even finished the crust which Is something I never do.

Pricey? Yes. Worth it. YES! A large pie will run you about $20.

The only reason I deducted a star is because there is no seating available, which would be cool if they did. I personally don't like to eat standing up.

Lol, I almost wish nobody knew about this place. This is definitely a secret worth keeping. It deserves every one of the 5 stars I have given it! I mean the pies are pretty damn good, but it just goes beyond that with everything else. 

From the moment you walk in & are greeted by my Paisan, Nico until you leave, you just can't help but feel giddy. When you step up to the counter, Nico just lays it all out, as only he can, starting you off with the pricing & some playful banter & all the different magic you can make with your slice or pie. The magic is definitely limited to your own imagination ;) 

However, I went with the basics, a slice of cheese & a slice of pepperoni & washed it down with a Barq's. My date du jour had a slice of cheese & some water. At which time, we took our place on some stools along the counter & did the good old pizza fold & chowed down! 

We strolled in about 2 am-ish, after catching a movie at Rave. I was totally craving a slice! It wasn't too busy at all, fortunately ;) It looked like there had just been a crowd in there, as it was a little messy. But that only adds to the charm of such a place. 

The most magical part of this late night pizza craving was, that it was all ""on them""! Unfortunately for us, or them, depending on how you look at it, they couldn't take cards at that particular time, which was all I had on me. So yeah, SCORE! Cuz, I do likes me some FREE eats ;) However, we did leave a nice tip for them in the tip jar. 

Overall, an awesome place to grab a slice or a whole pie. Definitely a cool vibe & not something you would expect to be in a stunning place, such as the Cosmo. You gotta really look for this place when you get up to the 3rd floor. Which is all I'm saying :P You will have to read the other reviews on here to find your way.

It's kind of the worst kept secret in town. 

Prices aren't exactly cheap, but it is in the Cosmopolitan and rent can't be cheap.

It's one of those places where they charge what they charge because they can. Like when you go to Disneyland and a bottle of water is $6 bucks. If you're desperate enough, you'll pay the $6 and be happy about it. 

Consider it a convenience tax.

They have nice pepperoni and they have a bianca with ricotta, which is kind of a dying breed these days.

It's good to have this spot in your back pocket if you're on the strip and dying for hot food and you've only got a hamilton in your pocket and lost all your credit cards.

Man, I wish I had saved my $25. 

The guy behind the counter prepping the pizzas was nice enough - explained how things worked without a condescending tone.  The girl helping out new to the operation, so there was a bit of a learning curve on keeping things going.  No problem; I've been in the same situation.    However, once the pizza went into the oven for re-heating and the money was in the register, that about ended an otherwise okay experience.

I swear it took like 20 minutes to get our 3 slices.  3 SLICES.  Another guy took over the pizza-making duties and made it his priority to only check up on the full pizza orders.  So when our slices finally came out, they were burnt at the crusts and essentially crackers at the base.  I told my fiance that I was not eating my ONE slice, he had to bring it back and ask for another slice (I told him to take his back too, but he was too nice to do so).  Another slice of margherita pizza that had been sitting there for quite some time that they could just throw into the oven for reheating.  I was really disappointed that they even gave us the pizza burnt - who serves burned pizza?!  That's already been cooked once?

We should've just gone down to Fashion Show Mall and had a few slices at Sbarro for a fraction of the price.  I guess if you want average pizza in a pretentious setting masquerading as hole-in-the-wall (literally) joint, this could be heaven.

If you think that, you obviously have either never been to NY, or were unfortunate enough to eat at one of the bad pizza spots. The positive reviews for this place must come from people who were completely obliterated when they ate here; that is the only way I can imagine anyone believing this to be good pizza. I came here with my husband after having a few drinks recently because Holstein's, our first choice, was closed. After waiting in line for 30 mins, we finally got our two slices. He ordered pepperoni and I had a regular slice; both were the most bland, dry, unappetizing pizza I have ever tried. There was next to no sauce on the pizza, and it tasted as if it had been under a heating lamp all day. Being that the place was extremely busy, the pizza coming out should not taste this way. Coming from NYC, I admit I have high expectations for pizza, but I've tasted better frozen pizza from Walmart. Not only did we have to stand in line for so long to get this disgusting food, but we had to eat our food standing against a wall because the place is so tiny.

The pizza itself? I thought it was great, I mean I blinked and it was gone. Maybe it was the fact that I was starving and had a few drinks, but I remember it having a distinct taste, nice and soft, not too soft or floppy, freshly baked dough and crusts and a good helping of toppings on each slice. I got two slices; one white pizza with cheese and ricotta cheese and a second slice with mushroom and pepperoni and they sure did the job.

So we ordered a cheese pizza added with mushrooms and sausage, white pizza, and one they had on display, which was a cheese with meatball and ricotta. Out of the three, the white was our favorite, and the meatball and ricotta was delicious too. However, the mushrooms on the cheese pizza with sausage was way too undercooked. It was a disappointment. Maybe it was because we asked to add them as a custom order. 

Service was slightly rude. The guy taking our orders seemed grumpy. The tables were also very messy and we had to clean up the cheese and napkins scattered over the tables ourselves.

On the other hand, if I was totally wasted and starving at 3am in the morning after a night of partying... then this place certainly makes sense.  Guys don't bring your girl here on a date!  And girls if your bf brings you here on a date, take my advice and ditch him.  Your guy is just cheap and you deserve better.",MGRNCiPHnzBhcDULy8OSuQ,1,0,2,AoEE6HmCB8wcckMB0ct5uw

I love the concept of it being a secret and the fun is finding it. But once we found it, I was expecting to be rewarded with some great pizza. Pizza was salty and a little brunt. The ingredients felt short in quality and quantity. I hate to say this but I would have been more satisfied and happy having Costco pizza.

The staff was very friendly and welcoming. We ordered 4 slices of pizza and a salad with salami, which was actually pretty good. They warm up pizza by the slice for you or they can make you one. It's a little pricey at 5+ a slice but nothing in the cosmo is going to be cheap. 

Pizza was nice and thin but not too thin. The crust was crunchy and not too thick. The salad was fresh and salami was good with spice. Get the salad to make it feel like you're not too fat.

The place was harder to find because of reading the reviews. Just go up the escalators to the third floor and it's a small hallway with records on the wall, located to the right of the pool tables.

Okay, Secret Pizza isn't secret, but they make some surprisingly legit NY-style pizza.  They serve three kinds of New York style pizza here: red, white, and Sicilian.  I'm still Jonesing for the Sicilian (they were out the two times I visited trying to get a slice); of the other two types, I think they're both exceptional examples of NY's finest.  My favorite of the two so far was the red, with Sausage, Pepperoni and garlic.  Both red and white slices are made with premium, super-sized, toppings and the crust is great tasting, chewy, soggy at all, and shaped exactly the way NY pizza should be shaped.

There are no signs announcing either the presence or location of Secret Pizza.  Legend has it it started out as a room-service pizza source built for guests, but it was decided before it opened to allow walk-ins from outside the hotel as well.

I would have never known about this place if it hadn't been for the nice concierge on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan while my mom and I were wandering around. He walked us over to this huge door and swung it open to reveal a hallway with a pinball game and loud rock music. 

The set-up is similar to a NY pizzeria in that there are no tables, just bars where you can stand and eat or grab an empty stool. I ordered a cheese slice for $3.50 which is unheard of in Vegas. The slice was really good! We went back there a couple of times during our visit when we didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for a meal.",8QWPi3IJwj9UoapUysJpOA,1,1,4,5TyJwjulyuyGYSVmwnVaSA

I came here with my boyfriend, and I had the impression that the pizzas would be more unique.  The pizzas are pre-made and each slice is popped in the oven for a few minutes as you order.  We asked the cashier what makes this pizza so great, and she replied, ""It's just good pizza.""

For $5, we shared one slice of the white pizza, which is topped with ricotta and mozzarella cheese.  I never had an orgasm in my mouth from pizza before, and needless to say, my boyfriend and I should have gotten our own slice.  After devouring that slice of pizza, we pulled out another $5 and ordered a slice of sausage pizza.  That was also very delicious, but I prefer the white pizza.

If you come with a large party, it's best to purchase an entire pizza to share since it's cheaper that way.

I suggested Secret Pizza to her and we started our trek.  We made a short jaunt to The Cosmopolitan and started our pizza pilgrimage.

The Yelpers before me did an excellent job at describing where the place was located and that helped a great deal because it would have taken me a while.

When you see the hallway, just walk toward the end and follow the incredible smell.

Maybe it's their secret way of keeping the place hidden and away from all the tourists.   Just find the public billiard table in the open floor, and then look for a long dark hallway which seems like it's a private entrance for staff.  Once you walk the long dark hallway, you will walk into a small pizza shop, and the smell of fresh pizza will immediately engulf you!

My friends split a cheese pizza, white pizza, and a pepperoni, olive, and mushroom pizza.  The line can get long, so be prepared to wait!  Once you order, the server will take your slice of pizza and bake it in the oven for a few minutes to get it nice and melty.  I believe a pizza slice comes out to be around $4 per slice.  I thought the price was slightly high since it was a super thin crust, and the slices didn't seem all that big.   The pizza was pretty good, but definitely not as good as the stuff served in NY.  I did not care for the white pizza, but the cheese and pepperoni pizza was pretty good.   Also, the crust was slightly chewy, which I did not like, but I really liked the cheese and spices they topped on the pizza.  One slice of pizza is like an appetizer, so I would suggest you order 2-3 slices a person, if you want to actually get filled up or eat it as a dinner.    I'd come back for a late night snack or an afternoon appetizer if I'm in the area, but it's not something I would walk from Wynn to Cosmo to eat.

I can't tell you how good this pizza is. It's a great combination of salty and cheesy goodness. I always get either a slice of their mushroom pizza or white pizza. Their mushroom pizza is delicious + a little bit of added chili flakes makes the saltiness of the pizza all come together for a flavorful bite. Their white pizza is probably one of their more famous pies and with good reason, it's delicious! It's a mozzarella (and parmesan?) based slice topped with ricotta cheese. At first, I thought it would be too much cheese for my liking but it all somehow comes together as cheesy goodness.  Now, the crust...it's all about the crust!! The pizza itself is thin with a slight crunchy bite to it. The crust is crispy but with a doughy inside that I love. The slices run pretty big so it's worth the price! ($5/6) Usually all it takes is one slice for me to be done, two if I'm super hungry. I've never had to wait in a long line to place my order (my wait is usually like 5 mins) but I've been told it can get pretty crazy late night when the clubs close. 
My only complaint about the pizza is that it can be a little too oily. Seeing small puddles of greasiness is kind of gross, but nothing a pat down with a napkin won't fix. Just wish I didn't have to perform this messy task before eating it. 

Seating is available inside (best for parties of 2, not so much for bigger parties) & all around the lounge type area but it can be difficult to find an open space during a busy night.

Pizzeria is a playful take on a typical NY pizza shop.  Records line the hallway leading to the small store.  There are a few seats, but really this is a ""stand up and enjoy your friggin' pizza"" type experience.

The pizza is good not great, and a bit expensive for a NY slice, but about what you'd expect from a nice hotel on the strip.  If you're looking to soak up some of the liquor in your system late night, get ready for a line.

Once as a quick mid afternoon bite. As we walked up they were pulling a fresh meatball and pepperoni pie out of the oven. It was excellent. 

The second time was just after Marquee on a late Friday night. When we were in earlier in the week my GF thought to ask about a menu, the woman at the register gave her one. After a quick read through ( it's only two very short pages) we noticed it did not have a phone number. We asked, can we call ahead and order before we left the club ? The answer was yes for full pies, In fact, if your staying at the Cosmo, you can have it delivered to your room. Salvation !!! no more waiting in line with lots of other drunks. 
So at 2:30 am before the haze of Grey Goose took over I called and ordered a full pie to the room.  An hour later, just after we got got back, there was a knock at the door and there it was, hot out of the oven. The delivery guy also brought several packs of fresh grated cheese and hot pepper seeds. It was perfect after a night of clubbing. 
So put the number in your cell phones now.....you will thank me later

As expected, sorta empty and just two guys working in the back.  I went with the White Pie while my coworker went with the sausage.  

After it was heated up, my White Pie looked as bomb as I remembered it.  In fact, it tastes even better than I remembered!  Creamy, garlicky, and cheesey.  I don't remember it being as garlicky as it tasted but it was great.  You can even add some garlic powder, which I did since I'm a huge fan of garlic.  Added some parmesan and sprinkled on red pepper to give it a bit of kick.  I tried a bit of the sausage but the tomato sauce and the cheese didn't stick to the pizza so it ended up being this gooey mess, but so good.  I did notice that my slice of White was smaller than all the other pizzas there... meh.

Had it not been for my fellow yelpers I would have never found this place. Like everyone else has said-it's down a long hallway of album covers with a pinball machine at the end thinly sandwiched between 2 other restaurants on the 3rd floor, behind the game area. If you really need anymore help, just go to the Cosmo's website and look at the building floor plans. It can be pretty hard to find. 

At the end of the skinny, slightly creepy hallway, it's as if you've set foot in the type of pizza shop you see pretty much everywhere except Las Vegas. 
It's $3.00 a slice, which may seem steep but by the standards of The Strip that might as well be free (The Strip is the place where bottles of water can be as high as $4.00 and the dollar menu doesn't even exist at McDonald's people).

They offer parmesan, oregano, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and pepper on the tables, which is perfect but at the same time rather unnecessary - this pizza is good enough without flavor enhancement. The crust is so good, it's burnt enough to be really crispy, but not burnt enough to just taste.....burnt. The cheese was bubbly and piping hot. My only gripe is that it was a little bit too greasy, but I'm willing to overlook that. 

Two slices of pepperoni pizza and drink (with as many free refills as you want) came out to be: $10.81. Not bad at all for The Strip.

Let's hope this stays a ~*secret*~ for as long as possible, and let's hope that when it eventually stops being a secret that the owners won't see that as reason to jack up the prices. *sarcastic grin*",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,3,2,4,al2fwHdHgsv0Hf9csxKHhg

Instead, it channels those ""street slice"" pizzerias you first stop at because you're hungry when you walk by, and then later because you know it's there.  You might not even know the name; it's just ""That pizza place on Bleecker Street.""  The unmarked entrance on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan echoes the phenomenon perfectly.  For many twenty-somethings, stopping for a slice after hitting the bars has also become a way of life, and this place brings that experience to Las Vegas.

Of course, it does so at Vegas prices, which means you're paying an outrageous $5 for a slice of pizza.  More problematic is a potential wait in excess of 15 minutes thanks to the raging popularity of this place.

The pizza is actually decent for what it's trying to ape.  It looked like a greasy mess when it was handed to me, but the crust is vaguely crispy without being crumbly, and the cheese actually adds some quality flavor instead of just adding weight and texture.  I've had far worse pizza-by-the-slice in New York itself.

Las Vegas has so many good eats that I can't really recommend making this a destination you go out of your way to check out.  However, if you're passing through the Cosmopolitan or you're stumbling around and get the urge to show off your hipness, you can grab a slice and then write a 5-star review on Yelp calling this place ""Las Vegas's Best Kept Secret"" too.",lKovm2pvX_fsBSTMXX5G_A,0,0,3,ZVR-ukhS3vyWIXnj6GInIQ

Many already made pies were waiting for us to choose from, but the staff seemed happy to accommodate other ""custom"" requests as well.  I chose a simple pepperoni slice (my go-to standard) along with a mixed veggie slice.  The crust was dead-on perfect...crispy on the bottom and chewy within, all on the thinner side.

What better way to attract all the drunkards but with a ""secret"" hidden pizza joint. Too bad it's really not a secret anymore. :(

Anyways, secret pizza probably has saved me more than I realized. Especially on a drinking night, you gotta get that pizza fuel to get you through the night. What better way to end your night of drinking, dancing, clubbing but with some hot fresh pizza?!

It's a better deal to just get a whole pizza. A 5 topping whole pizza come out to be around $35. For Cosmo standards, I think that's freaking worth it. Even if it's just for two people, just order a whole pizza, eat your couple of slices, then take the rest up to your room. And voila, you have breakfast the next day. The greatest thing about the Cosmo rooms is that they have microwaves inside the kitchen area so you can nuke your pizza the next morning for some hot breakfast or be like me and eat it cold. 

Also, if you get lazy and you're staying in the Cosmo rooms, they also deliver. How awesome is that?

My favorite is the white pizza, vegetarian friendly, however you really can't go wrong with any of the options.

A whole pie w. 3 toppings clocked in at $26. $4/bottle of FIJI water. It took about 20-25 mins to make, so if there aren't a lot of you I'd recommend just buying separate slices.

 My problem was that I was here around lunch time, no alcohol in my system but maybe some caffeine and I wasn't starving. I just wanted to try the pizza everyone else was raving about. 
 The place is very nice and clean, it wasn't busy at the time so I can't tell how log the pizza was sitting out there. I ordered a slice of the white pizza and the guy took the slice and put it in the oven to warm it up. The pizza came out good, the bread was a little too toasted almost like a cracker and the topping wasn't bad but a little bit too garlicky for my taste, it kept coming back, everything I ate after that had a garlic taste all through the day and conversations were kept short.
Although the pizza was good, that ""special pizza"" everyone talks about was not delivered, I can assure you that there are a lot of better pizza places in town. So here's ""the secret""......the five star pizza that they serve here is actually a three star pizza.

This place is very deserving of the name. It's so well-hidden that it's easy to miss if you don't know it's there. You go down a dark, narrow hallway to find this hole-in-the-wall type place. Décor is nice, like the rest of the casino. It has a cute subway vibe and is very clean. 

I had a pepperoni and mushroom (red sauce) slice, and my hubby had a spinach and feta (white sauce) slice. The crust was thin and chewy. The pizza tasted good, but was a little on the greasy side. 

Yes, it's tastier than your typical Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns, Costco, or any chain pizza joints. However, $5 for a thin slice is too much. $30 for a whole pie is out of the question. There are so many better deals in Vegas. 

I've tried it now (and it is good), but I'm not willing to shell out that much money for a slice of pizza. We left hungry after eating a slice each, but we didn't want to spend another $10 there.

As long as you know where the 3rd floor pool tables are or where Blue Ribbon Sushi is, you can find it. You're going to experience a style and aura here that you just don't see often. The wall of record covers and the Galaga machine are my favorite touches. Well, they are really the only two touches. I've tried to make it to the top of the Galaga score board but for some reason none of the scores stick.

Now for the pizza: It's New York style and it's ricotta and it's foldable and it's soft on the inside with a perfect crunch on the bottom and it's cheap and it's marvelous drinking food. Every slice is unique and has character. Just like New Yorkers! My favorite is the white pizza. I can deal with deli meats any other day of the week, but when a white sauce and cheese can stand alone that well, then I dedicate myself to it. Just don't make the mistake I did one tipsy night and pound the garlic shaker over your white pizza thinking it's parmesan. You and anyone you kiss will reek of garlic for 2 days.

I give it 4 stars because: 1) The service isn't outstanding. For a $4 slice of pizza and PBR on tap you really can't expect Ritz service, but sometimes these guys look like they're going to go either comatose or Angry Birds on you. 2) When it's busy, you won't find a seat. There's more counter space than stools. (Do you think that was a coincidence? I think not.)

There is a line that doesn't look too bad, but it is deceiving! A tip is to call in before and pick up your pizza to save time. In Vegas, time is money, so save your money!

The pizza is good! They offer a red or white (cost a bit more) sauce and it's all thin crust. You can buy by the slice (which also saves time) or you can get a full pizza which is the better deal if you have a lot of hungry people. They are literally 3-5 stools in the restaurant only because there's just enough room for people to stand around to wait for their order.

Went for dinner w/ a friend, Angelica, and had some bomb diggity pizza. 

This type of pizza may institute the fork and knife method but stay away from it! Food always tastes better when eating with your hands. 

Be careful though of the ""The Cheese is so Hot and will burn the Roof of your Mouth"" monster when biting into that first slice of freshly baked pizza. Then also watch out for the avalanche of cheese that may ensue afterwards. 

If you don't listen to me and hear a ""I told you so"" in the back of your mind after that hot gooey cheese that burned you, that PBR should help cool it down.

We got a white pizza and a pep and sausage pizza when we first came here and with every trip since then, this is the first thing we pick up after finding our hotel room. 

I would suggest ordering a whole pizza and eating on the spot if you aren't staying at Cosmo. You'll be able to enjoy each bite the way it was intended right out of the even. Just hope that there is a spot to sit down and eat as it does get pretty packed depending on what time you go. Unfortunately, it was packed one time and we took a taxi ride back to our hotel after picking up the pizza one time. By the time we got back it wasn't as fresh, hot, and tasty.

The down side is that the pizza is REALLY greasy  so if you're a health nut you might want to stay away. If you are going to order a whole pizza, it does take a while for it to come out. Also, if you order by the slice, beware its not going to be as good as when its right out of the oven. My girlfriend and I bought two slices that were sitting out and man were we disappointed. They even reheated it for us in the oven. The price is also pretty high...$20 for a whole pizza if I remember correctly.

In the end, the positives outweigh the negatives. Imagining the tastes of each bite at this moment gets my mouth watering. Secret Pizza is a place I would recommend to anyone who loves pizza and is in Vegas. And if you don't, maybe this establishment will change your mind.

You even get just a touch of attitude from the pizza makers, New York style! That only makes it all the more authentic to me. Just enough attitude to make it interesting but not enough to annoy you. That's why I keep coming back. 

So a slice will (as of this writing) run you about $5, which ain't cheap for pizza. But it's very well made, slowly baked and they'll reheat it for you without even being asked. So I knocked off one star for pricing but in fairness, they DO give you a free cup of water if y ou want it. Also keep in mind it's standing room only and no place to sit but plenty of counter space to stand and eat along the walls.

1. It's probably the best pizza in the area, and certainly convenient if you're at the Cosmopolitan.

2. They have oregano, red pepper, and the other condiments usually only found in pizza places with true NY roots. 

If you're from NY, this pizza will be substandard.   Decent, yes.  Cheap?  For Vegas, sure.   But that being said, it's very good for what it is.  A tad oily, as others have mentioned, but not a show stopper.  

The line was long when I went there; fortunately, there were cool people in line with me to chat with.    Took around 15 minutes to order, and a whole pie would have taken an additional 30 minutes - and this was at 3pm.   I opted for a few slices instead, which were ready after a quick warm-up.

I been to chicago, miami, new york...  and a bunch of other places.  I got a decent basis for judging pizza. So everytime i go any where i order a pepperoni and then whatever special...

now...  The pizza was average.  The cheeses were not high grade and you can tell because a high quality cheese will melt evenly and you won't see too much of a cut between the oil and the cheese.  This pizza had pockets of oil... so instantly i knew it was a midgrade cheese.

In new york, (which doesn't have the best pizza by the way but are top contenders) they throw chunks of mozarella...  they look like little mcnuggest and boom...  you get this sexy cheese spread.  And no pockets of oil...  

The sauce wasn't knock your socks off good...  but it was decent.  Not too sweet. a little on the thin side for me...

But it was a decent slice.  What killed it is the price.  I paid for two slices and a can of orange crush 15 bucks.  I was like... for serious?

Add it to room 1159...   it didn't work no registered guess in that name.  oh well.

You know the routine everyone is in Vegas Mode standing in line for the exclusive clubs like Club Marquee trying to bribe the doorman to let you and your friends in. If you give your brain a second to clear itself out you will notice people walking around with cheap paper plates and a huge slice of pizza. At first I didn't even notice but I kept seeing this. It was odd seeing people holding $20 drinks in one hand a slice of pizza on a cheap paper plate in the other hand. Finally, I asked the huge security guard bouncer dude what is that and he points towards a hallway that looks like a bathroom hallway in the mall. No sign and not even a clue whats down the hall I walk down this hallway and at the end a Secret Pizza place with a bunch of what looks like hand made pizzas being put in the giant oven!

By this I mean it's literally hidden, and that's the most exciting thing about it. Unless you find this place on Yelp, you will only hear about it through people who frequent the strip and have spent many drunken nights waiting in the long line with tens of other people at 3 a.m., after a night of clubbing. 
My boyfriend, one of my best friends, and her boyfriend, waited for about an hour around lunch time on a Friday. I can't imagine how long the line is at the early hour of two in the morning, with a bunch of drunk people who all know this is one of the few places open late.
The pizza itself is a very average New York style pizza. When you finally get up to the window, you can either order a whole pizza with up to six toppings, or you can choose a slice from four already-made pizzas, alternating the toppings with each new pizza.
The prices are decent here for the strip, and that's really the only other pro of this establishment. There's really no where to sit down inside, especially when it's busy, and the crust is a little dry.
I would probably only return if I was really drunk and really hungry, and it would have to be so late that nothing else was open. Cool place to come across if you hadn't heard about it, though.",m3VudXLzVbgMw1BWy7q4Ug,1,1,3,GeUTzqgIEVpb6L4WkL1htw

Often imitated but never duplicated... A thin, doughy crust, with a little crispness, easy on the cheese, and a sweet basil tomato sauce. 

A real NY pizza expert will start with a slice of cheese. This one made the grade. I was also a fan of the sausage and banana pepper.

Yelp, you make a perfect wingman, and I love you for it!

This tiny lil pizza spot, is a hidden gem, within the FABULOUS walls of the Cosmopolitan, serving up slice after slice, of mouth-watering thin crust pizza genius!

They don't call it ""Secret Pizza"" for nothing, you've gotta sort of hunt this place down. Even the staff of the Cosmo, is in on it. They'll give you some vague hints, as to the whereabouts of their exact location, but, the rest is up to you, to find the joint! Also, I'm not here to tell you where it's located, I'm here to tell you, you've GOT to go!

Small and tiny, but with nice decor (the walled corridor leading to the actual pizzeria, is lined with album {mostly Italian} art). The actual pizzeria is TINY, with MINIMAL SEATING SPACE! Think, stand and eat, not sit down. NOT a good place, for large groups!

The pizza, is DAMN good! I'm still upset that I didn't get a whole pie, instead of a slice! It's crispy thin crust, NY style! My style! 

You basically pick a slice from their selection of ready made pizzas, and they'll heat it up for you, or, you can order a whole pie. Just be on your toes, because, when you're slice is done reheating, they just assume you'll come to the front, to take it. They don't call out numbers or names or anything. So, if you're not there, someone else may snag it!

I came in at around 2PM, not AM, but PM, and even then, it was terrific people watching! Drunks EVERYWHERE!

The price is pretty damn good too, considering, you're in a 5-star resort.

If you're in Vegas, and you're in the mood for pizza, DON'T forget about this place!

There is no label. 
There is not even an inkling that Secret Pizza exists unless you look for it. 

It's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, next to the elevators and this really red open restaurant.

Order pizza by the slice for ~$4.50. YES. IT IS  $5/ slice (added toppings at 0.50 more each). MEH.  Despite the ridiculously steep by the slice price,  it does serve up some delicious thin crust Manhattan, NY styled pizza -- really crispy through and through crust with very ooey, gooey cheesiness. 

There is a NOTICEABLE difference between freshly made and those sitting cold on the counter (they reheat when you order). The crust is fuller and softer. Try to wait for the fresh ones to come out (though, the reheated one was not bad). The reheated one kind of...cut the top of my mouth. mmmhmmmm

Pizzas are greasy, oily and unforgiving, but for those who crave the real deal, you sop up the grease because it's unfortunately.. delicious. It is much saltier than most pizzas I've had though, which probably is due to the need to heighten taste since all your other senses are already bombarded.

The quality is good, the variety is great, the lines........depending on when you arrive, may be a little while until you get your hands on a slice.  Question is, WHY is this pizza good?  What's the hype?  As put to me by a friend, it's either the sauce or the crust that defines the pizza.  Truth is, it is very difficult to have one without the other.  In this case, Secret Pizza succeeds in having a light but crispy crust paired with a winning white sauce (if you get the white sauce) and the balance of cheese that doesn't impair the stomach from already having an awesome time in Vegas!

This place was packed with people when I came here due to the fact that nobody picked up the phone(fail). At least i get to see why this place was oh so secret haha since there are no signs or even a name to let you know it's here but I guess seeing a bunch of people lining up for no apparent reason is your sign of knowing where secret pizza is. 

Fairly decent price for how big the pizza is when you order the whole thing. I actually really like the pizza...my favorite toppings to go along with it right now is probably pepperoni, onions/mushrooms, and garlic. Man the garlic makes the pizza absolutely delicious!!! I really like the thin layer crust even though it doesn't exactly get me full :p but as long as it taste delicious then there isn't much to complain about. I guess my real only complain to secret pizza is probably the amount of oil you see on it which i should of use my napkin to soak it up because i remember i had a stomachache the next day...you know the rest. #tmi 
BUT YEA make sure you use the napkin to lessen the oil and you'll be fine as it is a delicious pizza to enjoy.

Good thing that friend did some research, otherwise we may not have found it!  She knew it was near another restaurant and that it was a long hallway.  At the end of the long hallway was a pinball machine, making it look like an arcade or something.

We went down the hallway and it wasn't quite what I was expecting:  it was basically a counter with a menu board, and mostly seating facing the wall on bar stools.  For some reason I expected a sit down place, or at least something with more tables.  Fortunately we were there when it wasn't that crowded.

I found the menu a bit confusing - it sounded like you could order slices with customized toppings, so my friend and I were trying to figure out what we wanted since we didn't want to order a whole pizza.  Then we noticed that they already had pizzas ready to serve by the slice - we looked at them and decided on 3 slices:  pepperoni, sausage & mushroom, and cheese w/ white sauce.  We each also ordered a soda.  The total came out to just under $20.

We cut each slice in half, and that was a good amount of food for us for lunch.  And the pizzas were all quite tasty!  It was definitely worth it, food wise.  The service was just okay - nothing bad, but nothing good either.  I wish the menu board was easier to figure out, maybe describing the ordering process or something.  The seating area isn't that great either, and it was pretty filthy.  When we first got there, it was slow - it seems like one of the workers could have quickly wiped down the counters before it got busy again.

But, nonetheless, it was good pizza, and I'd definitely go back again (but maybe do like what some other people did and take it out into the lobby area to eat).",KbMFXAH3te7Ff1U-C78aTA,0,0,4,1f-lBxUuuk1TjfSXKBENqA

IMHO this place is overhyped. I ordered a regular cheese slice, and my two friends shared a white sicilian. 

The supposedly ""new york style"" cheese slice: Decent slice? Yes. New York style? Not so much. The cheese was good. It had a complex flavor, a little sharp, and cooked crispy. The crust left a lot to be desired. It was a little hard, chewy, and maybe a little stale (to be fair, it was midnight, but still... c'mon it's Vegas). The sauce was fine, but not enough. Hmm... size-wise, a small slice, not worth the $4.50 Overall: Meh...slightly above average. Hence, the 3 1/2 stars.

The White sicilian: A much more subtle and delicate slice, slightly sweet also. Different white cheeses blended gave a nice flavor. Little islands of good cheese were sweet and refreshing. The crust was soft, spongy, and very thick. It reminded me more of a loaf of focaccia bread. Not exactly a new york style Sicilian, but good. I would give this one 3 stars, only average.

The condiments bar: A new york style condiment counter with oregano and garlic powder, in addition to the typical crushed red pepper and parmesan. I appreciated this, it's nice to have.

The atmosphere: First of all, it's really really hard to find this place. We had to ask four staff members through what seemed like an endless maze and multiple floors. The pizza place itself is a little hole in the wall pizzeria down a long tunnel hallway, which instantaneously transports you from the Cosmo glitz to a no frills NYC pizzeria (ok a fake, touristy, manufactured NYC pizzeria). There's only one counter bar to eat on inside. So, we chose to port our pizza to the retro glam seating area right outside (back into the Cosmo Glam world).

Price: $4.50 for a slice is ok at the Cosmo, but no New Yorker in their right mind would pay that much, especially for such a small slice. (Ok, Ok I know this is Vegas...but YOU try this small slice, and then tell me if it's worth the price). 

Bottom Line: The pizza is ok, not worth the schlepp though (or the price for that matter). I would come back if I'm drunk and hungry after midnight. I have a feeling it's good drunk food. *wink*",BKF4-e-lZn2iXdCMLQSFUw,0,0,3,PDiOXekHiZE2N0BdZL1M-w

The mushroom pizza was just a regular pizza. It was packed with garlic flavor and super thin. That slice came out to be about $5.

There are countless reviews and tips on Yelp, so I won't go into the boring details. You can easily find this spot at the Cosmo on the 3rd floor. It's unmarked, but the pictures in the Yelp listing can help direct you.

Be prepared for a line if you are going during nightclub hours. Drunk people love their food.

The pizza itself is fairly basic. You have a few options and a slice will run you about $5-6. It's simply delicious pizza. Greasy, but not too oily. Just the right amount. It's perfect.

My favorite has always been the sausage/pepperoni pizza with the italian peppers. 

Take your slice and sit outside in front of STK on the chairs, especially at night. You'll have a front row seat to the Hot Mess Express from Marquee & other parts of the hotel.

Slight Cons:

Well. Finding the place took a bit. So much so. I ended up going to another place for lunch. That night at 4am we were coming back from the club. Decided secret pizza was the spot. Took awhile but we found it. The line. Was crazy long!!!  It was a good 25-30 min wait in line for pizza. No joke. Everyone was drunk in the line. It was this narrow hallway. One way in one way out. People were saying excuse me trying to get through. It sucked. Finally. We got up to the counter. 

One of the guys asked what we wanted. So I told him in from NY. I don't eat any pizza out of state. I heard you guys were legit. Please don't disappoint me. The guy laughed.  He said he was from the island. His brother moved out here and started the business. He talked with me for a few mins. Then said hold on one min man. He turned around. Reached under a counter and pulled a pizza out. Then warmed it up in the oven. He came back and said I'll take care of you man. Apparently. If I'm understanding what he did. The pizza on display and what people were ordering were NY style pizza. The special under the counter local NY pizza he pulled out was there original pizza.  It was pretty cool. 

The pizza was really good. I only eat pizza in NY sometimes jersey. But this was the closest thing to NY pizza I have had on the west coast. Really good thin crust pizza just like home.

First lets talk about the pizza. I had heard of this place from yelp and it was on my list of spots I had to try. Well there where 10 of us in our party and we decided pizza and beer would do for dinner. We made a trip down and found the pizza place. Everyone is right, it is down an unmarked hall to a little counter with an oven and pies sitting out if you buy a slice. Small menu board, but they do have PBR on tap ($5 for a red cup) We ordered 3 pizzas with a variety of toppings. OMG this was damn good pizza. The slices where massive, but with a very thin crust and a very thin but crunchy outside crust. All very good and we only ended up with 4 left over slices.

Price, I do not agree with the other reviews about value. Each pie for us was $23-24. While these are large pies they still seemed expensive. I know this is vegas and I know it is going to be more expensive, but this just seemed over the top for me.

There is virtually no room to sit and eat, a couple of chairs, a little bar, and another little bar to stand and eat. If you have more then a couple of people be prepared to stand and eat.

Now on to the service. This gets a 2 star. We walked in and reviewed the very simple menu. We wanted to ask a couple questions about toppings because nothing was listed on the board. The girl helping us was not helpful at all. She just kinda spewed out some ""answers"". Not sure if she was having a bad day, or if she does not really give a shit.... i lean towards not giving a shit. The manager offered to bring them up to the room for us as soon as they where done, we where told 30-40 min.

After over an hour and still no pizza we made a call. After getting handed off to 2 people we still had no answer and no pizza. At almost the same time the manager showed up at our room, brought the pizzas in and gave us a hand getting the pizzas out. He even brought up a stack of napkins and plates. What kinda annoyed me was he then asked for a tip for bringing them up. He never said sorry for being late or anything else. If he had of called to say hey we got busy it will be a bit longer then I would of gladly handed him a tip.

Overall I would 100% go get a slice and a PBR, but really don't expect much as far as service.",uHMhpNnlYJrQ-_i54z3n8g,1,0,4,EcrVebgHdvrFcsHtUnI3hg

No. Not an algebra problem but you know how it goes with secrets - once too many people know it sure ain't a secret. Once you mention a place like this on a TV show that's just as good as advertising on billboards on every highway leading to Vegas. So one night when I was free to roam on my own for dinner I made a beeline for this place. I didn't see the TV show but a friend did and he's a pizza connoisseur and recommended this place. Third floor of the Cosmopolitan - there's no sign but I think most people would be curious to see where this hallway leads to anyway so I wouldn't call it ""hidden"". 3000 plus reviews also suggests you'd have to amass a rather high body count before this place ever becomes a ""secret"" again. When I got to the end of the hallway there was a line and all available spots to hang out and eat your pizza were occupied. I got a Goose IPA and one slice with ricotta and meatball and one sausage pizza slice. Priced just as any other place in Vegas but I've had pizza at food courts in various hotels in Vegas and the pizza was better than any of those. Worth the trip however long the walk on the strip to get here is. Not sure what the place is really called - my bill just had the generic ""pizzeria"" name on it. As always, your mileage may vary.

Approaching my Vegas trip, a friend told me to check out this place in the Cosmopolitan hotel.  I don't know how he found out about it, but apparently this place had really good pizza and was hidden somewhere in the Cosmo.  Oh it was hidden all right.  When I jumped on the Cosmopolitan hotel website to find a list of their restaurants....no listing for this place.  Luckily I stumbled on it here on Yelp, listed as ""Secret Pizza"".

I followed other reviewers' directions and hints for finding the place: it's down a sorta-hidden hallway next to the pool tables on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.  We could smell pizzas in the oven once we got to the 3rd floor, so we knew we were in the right place.  Even in the hotel there was no mention of this pizza place and no signs pointing towards it.  Even the restaurant is unnamed!

But my friend was right, the pizza was delicious (although I think its novelty partially adds to the taste, haha)!  Crispy crust, fresh-tasting dough, and a delicious blend of cheese/sauce as topping!  I got the white pizza (feta and mozzerella cheeses instead of tomato sauce) with mushrooms on it.  I guess because mushrooms aren't a super popular topping, the chef just put raw mushrooms on a slice of white pizza before sending it through the oven to heat it up.  It's okay; still super good!!

We lucked out coming in at 2pm, which I guess isn't part of the lunch crowd, so there wasn't a line.  However, I've heard there can be a pretty long line for this place, especially in the wee hours of the morning when the nightclubbers come out of Marquee.

Was it because it Saturday night at 12 pm wasn't prime time for pizza?

Conclusion:  I am definitely going to be the minority opinion here *bracing to have tomatoes thrown at me*....The Pizzeria at the Cosmopolitan didn't quite hit the mark, but if left with middle of the night munchies, I still welcome it as an option for late night pizza.

Overall: I definitely think this is a great place to grab a bite if you want something quick whether its a late night meal or you just need some drunk food.",l5cxtEb38HqqSqXJdG1_lw,0,0,3,DwBUJIeH6iXoGJnTXZh67g

Ordered a custom pie for our group; it was ready in about 20 minutes. 

As remarked on by others, limited seating (& ambiance) in the venue itself, but we were able to go back out by the entrance where there are pool tables, dominoes, and other games, and put some of the small tables and chairs together for a nice meal. 

Pizza was hot and tasty; obviously not going to be better than the best pizza parlors of New York, but definitely solid). It was a great way to get a good meal and a nice price while still in one of the Strip's hottest hotels.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,0,0,4,0GkH9AZYfUM43n9MCOQ85g

There is a standing spot for the pizza as well as some seats. People usually just eat their pizza and leave, they may play the arcade games but if not there is some space to eat your pizza. 

Service:
Their staff is friendly, they have one person taking orders, one person who works at the register and a few making the pizza. Because It is in such a small space, the demand on pizza seems high. 

Price:
It costs $5 for a slice of cheese pizza and each additional topping is $.50. I personally think It is pretty expensive but for a hotel, It is the average price of what you'd expect to pay. 

Food: 
I got 2 slices of pepperoni pizza and 1 slice of sausage pizza. I personally think that It was really greasy and I felt really sick after eating the pizza. It may be because I don't typically eat food this greasy but It was delicious while I ate It.

But I'm gonna try my best in this review. 

Secret Pizza is a small joint, located down a long, secret hallway lined with music record covers on the third floor of the ___________hotel. Since SP is not listed on the hotels website or in their directory, nor do they have any signs indicating they are even a buisness, they can be hard to locate. 

Since SP is open till the wee hours of the morning, most people usually stumble in here in the early AM to cure their drunken munchies. Not me though. I stumbled in here right when they opened at 11am to cure my I just woke up and I'm hungry as hell munchies. All they serve here is pizza and beer. Simple. Delicious. You can buy your pie whole or by the slice. These are the slices my wife and I bought;

1 white pizza slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=24ppCiDbltVR9nt4spAUFQ
1 sausage & pepperoni slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=UGqPkyYuVIsLsjIN-UaEkg
1 sausage & Pepperchini slice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=AwEEKS68Y2WnPRDIJYzHNg

Since we got there right after they opened, each slice was just coming out of the oven. After waiting a few minutes to let the huge slices cool, I remember my girl Michelle T's warning about burning my mouth, my wife and I dug in. All three slices were great. They had lots of cheese and toppings, flavorful sauce and a nice, crispy crust. At $5 a slice, this is a great spot for a quick, tasty meal. 

If you can find SP, you definitely need to check it out. Just look for this hallway http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=JHsPAfv3yu3RrFNFO9qzFg",YWFbTcVnun8i03XnEU7kVg,15,14,4,wMmqI-wvQAEu2AFqteTlNg

FOOD
The pizza is NY Style thin crust. It was OKAY, not spectular enough to be worth $5 a slice! I've had wayyy better pizza for half the price. IMO costco pizza even tastes better.

White pizza - Just okay. Really heavy-handed on the ricotta. There was just thick globs of it scattered everywhere.

Cheese pizza - Average. Kinda greasy

Mushroom - Average

Sausage & pepperoni - Probably the better one of them all. It actually had some flavor to it. 

SERVICE
SUCKED! Pretty much you walk up to the counter and the person takes your order. The lady who helped us was rude. Honestly seemed like she HATED her job. Just gave us her frowning face & asked us what we wanted. The pizzas were just laid on the counter in front of her and it didn't even really look all appealing. But since we made it all the way here, we might as well order. She only warmed up two out of our 4 slices. So our food was half warm, half cold. 

AMBIANCE
This place is on the 3rd floor of cosmopolitan near the Blue Ribbon Sushi place. But there are no signs mentioning the pizza place. At first, we couldn't find it and had to ask someone where it was. The lady just said to walk down the long halfway & it'll be there. The place is pretty much just a counter with some side counters and chairs to eat but that's pretty much it. Nothing memorable.

""Oh, what's it called?""
""I don't know. It's just the secret pizza place?""

Yes. Apparently it really is just called ""Secret Pizza.""

I had always heard of Secret Pizza, but had never figured out exactly where it was. If you're searching for it, you will find it, but if you're just casually passing by, you probably won't even notice it's there. 

How to find it: Go to the Cosmopolitan. Find the entrance to Marquee and take the escalators one floor up. You should be smelling the deliciousness of freshly baked pizza by now. Straight across from the escalators there's a narrow corridor. Follow your nose. This is where the smell is coming from. This is where the secret pizza is hidden away.

You'll probably spend a while stuck in the hallway, being taunted by the smell of ahmazing pizza wafting over you. When you turn the corner of the hallway, you'll be greeted by what looks like an ordinary pizza counter. But do not be fooled. 

You can get a slice of pizza for about $5, which is actually fairly decent since each slice is huge. And delicious (trust me, try the white sauce! Zomg. So gooooooood.) If you're trying to order an entire pie, beware, the wait is most likely going to be terrible. 

There's two TVs, which makes the wait somewhat more bearable. There's also barely any seating, so most people end up just dumping on the cheese and peppers and taking their slices to go. This seems to be the way to go because we grabbed a seat outside on the couches/stairs in front of Secret Pizza and someone had already snuck a cheese and pepper shaker outside.

Also, for those who enjoy a little late night snacking post-Marquee adventures, Secret Pizza is the place to be. But again, the line, the line! Beware.

tl;dr: If you're in Vegas and searching for a truly delicious piece of pie, Secret Pizza is the place to go. But beware the line! (Because for a secret pizza place, it sure is poppin')",aSUmRlQxraEBVRnhpx9l9w,3,2,4,8dje6BtDBXSAoKHRtVQgig

As countless others have noted, don't bother looking for signs or directions. Just head to the third floor and the path will be obvious. I'm not even sure who named the place Secret Pizza. The receipt just says Pizzeria. Now that's hip. 

I got a slice of the White Pizza for 550 pennies and was very happy.  Piping hot, thin-sliced, crispy, and real cheesy with ricotta and mozzarella. I tasted a little bit of garlic too.

I dig anything sourdough so I was excited to try their sourdough crust. I knew we would be staying at the Cosmopolitan soon so it was inevitable that we would be up late, drunk and hungry.

Sure enough, we were drunk and starving after a couple hours of video poker at the bar and a small dinner at Jaleo. My husband usually doesn't eat dairy or gluten, but after five Manhattans, that went out the window. We decided to get a whole pie with olives and mushrooms.

Even drunk, we knew it was just an ok pizza. It wasn't bad, but it didn't meet my expectations. It was pretty pricey too, but I know that's a silly thing to complain about on the Strip.

1.  You eat it after clubbing and everything tastes better after you've been clubbing
2.  It has the cool factor, since the restaurant is not listed, no signage, and heck it's called SECRET pizza

We went early afternoon, and there was no wait.  We tried pepperoni pizza and the white pizza.  I preferred the white pizza, but both were too oily for my taste.  I loved the crust though, thin, crispy, and baked perfectly.

It might have been better if I got a fresh baked slice, but I think mine was sitting out for a little while.  I probably won't go back, but if you're a pizza aficionado, definitely worth checking out.

I took to my faithful Yelp app and we were down with its near perfect five stars and late hours (until 5am!).

First and foremost, The Cosmopolitan might be the new Wynn.  It's beautiful with hot girls everywhere. The bars are plenty, the resort is bustling with nightlife and good times everywhere you look. We look for a hotel guide and interestingly enough, the pizza place isn't listed.  Odd.  We ask a staff member and up we go on a glass elevator that Tony Montana would have in his mansion.  

The pizzeria is nowhere to be found, but the hint of party-goers with paper plates and slices gives you all the info you need.  We head down a dark hallway and make it to our final destination.  The parlor is busy and cracking with hungry customers at all hours. The pizza place is still relatively new and it shows.  There was a small line and we waited a good 10 minutes in line.  As I approached the glass, they had a few pies, which included a combo, veggie, cheese, peperoni, and some other odds and ends.  

I went with their veggie offering and a cheese and ricotta slice. The cute cashier (Christie) rang me up and the damage was about $12 for two slices and a Pabst beer.  A set of stools offer a seating area for a few patrons, but expect them to be used at all times.  Fortunately, there's plenty of seating areas nearby. I took my first bite and the pizza was delish! The cheese was gooey and hot.  The veggies were fresh and had that contrast I looked for with the cheese and crust.  Overall, the pizza is great and the ""secret"" location adds a nice cool factor.

About 6 years ago (early January 2011), I remember entering the brand new Cosmopolitan in search of the secret hallway (which was located in between the glass elevator and sushi place). Stumbling upon the vinyl album covered hallway for the first time was an ""only in LAS Vegas"" experience on its own. 
Looking past the line up of pinball machines against the left wall..you see your prize. 

WHITE PIZZA. The perfect combination of ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and olive oil.
Pick up a slice (or two) if you're alone or live it up and buy the full pie to share.
Honorable mention: Slice of meatball & ricotta.
For the Sweet tooth: Try the cannoli!

Since that fateful day in January, my visits to Secret Pizza have been quite frequent. Whether its white pizza for lunch, dinner, or late night snack (somehow, despite whatever club I may have gone to..Secret pizza is always a ""close enough"" walk.)

As this place continues to grow in popularity, the line (especially for the night time crowd) gets longer and longer..but like many who stand in line with me, I will continue to wait in line as I know it'll be worth the wait.",iiMGd03G_RXzXFfRsyPAMg,1,0,5,FDQwZZZl-qn_kSMjoFREdg

I usually find myself wandering the streets of LV with co workers on a nightly basis (usually during the months of April - June) and usually not the same ones every night either, so every night is a new night. And one night someone suggested ""The Hidden Pizza Place at the Cosmo"" so intrigued (and hungry) I said ""MEOW"" which in our terms means...well a number of things, but in this instance it meant ok.

So being that only one person had been here and more than likely was intoxicated while going, only knew how to get us to the Cosmo, after that it was like Beer Feast where I thought to pour a liter of Goldschlager down his throat to make him remember so I didn't have to stand between a rave bar and a place that smelled delicious. But forward we went with our caravan of folk in tact. 

Upward and onward, through the chandelier bar, past Marquee, and around the corner from burgers we had found it. . . like the bright tunnel of light you see after you die.... 

I love it for a few reasons and here they are:

1) No signage to show were it is, makes it kinda mysterious

2) The pizza is actually pretty good, I mean not like ""NY, NY"" but still pretty close, I know that my NYer friends liked it.

3) There's a cool little lounging area with a pool table to chill next to whilst you eat your pizza.

I decided to start here because Secret Pizza is my all time favorite. It's just good, trust me. Its the kinda good you don't have to be drunk for, the kind that makes you want a few slices or a whole pie.

Ok, so one thing that's totally awesome about Secret Pizza is the fact that you can add ingredients to the slices. I almost always add ricotta cheese to mine, unless they have a slice with it already. I see people adding onions and peppers etc etc. Still just as fast, but freedom to customize... Huge plus. 

They also offer a white slice which is excellent, but a tad garlicky... Just a tip for those trying to pick up a date afterward ;)  they usually have a wide variety of slices to choose from, and like I said you can add on ingredients. 

The price point is typical of the strip.. I usually pay around $6 for my slice with 3+ ingredients. It's a large slice and it fills me up, though I do see many people with 2 slices. 

I think the value is good... And the line is almost always long. This is my pizza of choice on the strip..by a long shot.",lcr5Nx2Y-sUr3rqdj_1_7g,2,0,5,G1-ooe0K074lZkYaeoromA

We went on a Sunday for lunch and it was probably very different than 3am on a weekend.  We ordered Veggie, Meatball/Pepperoni, and White slices.

I can't even comment on the other two as we were just dying over the White Pizza. We ordered it because we felt like we ""should"" since it was supposed to be the most popular. It was amazing...a bit oily, but full of garlic and cheese. Loved it.   Probably would be even better after a late night of drinking, but a meal right before driving home was pretty good too.

Its a casual place. Sodas served in red solo cups (for $4...). The unmarked, unadvertised part of it is so fun. And if you've been to the Cosmopolitan before you'll be shocked to see where it is.

Pizzeria is a tiny little pizza joint on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan.  I don't recall even seeing signs for it.  Someone told us about it so that is how we happened to find it.  

We first attempted to order on a Saturday night...well...Sunday morning after Marquee Night Club and were standing in line when I was plowed over by a very intoxicated Australian man.  After gaining my composure, he plowed me again.  Before I killed someone, I made the decision to come back later.  So my point here is...if you go late night, your experience may not be so pleasant as this place attracts the overly intoxicated/drugged.

My second attempt, which was late on a Sunday night/Monday morning, was much more pleasant.  The pizza guys aren't very friendly and I am pretty sure not one of them cracked a smile.  The girl who was taking orders, etc. ,though, was quite pleasant and tolerant of the late night clientele.

The pizza is delicious.  It is the thin crust, not overly greasy, cooked to perfection, perfect cut slice kind of pizza that is so rare to find!!!  Some of our crowd went back for seconds and to try different flavors.  I had the supreme and could not have been happier.

Avoid the rush of the drunk, 2am crowd and I am sure the pizza will be worth your adventure.

What's so good about their pepperoni pizza?  It tastes like a REALLY good microwave pizza -- and I mean that in a good way.  It's greasy, crispy, salty, and hot -- so wrong, yet so right.  It's comfort food. And, you can add toppings of your choice (for some extra $).  They have the basics premade -- cheese, pepperoni, white pizza, and some other choice pie of the day.  When you get your slice, they'll heat it up for you, so that it's hot hot hot.

Pizza is sold by the slice or the entire pie. 
It's not cheap pizza -- but think of it this way: In Vegas, the house always wins -- might as well get some pizza out of the transaction.",MspXtBLBkKJwEyfJ79YYJw,3,2,4,Ol4mHJRS--9LaJqyepPhEQ

It's inside of the Cosmopolitan hotel, on the second story, through an unmarked hallway. If you ask a worker they'll point you to it. Nearby is a place that sells gelato... :) we did not go wrong with that combo!

Order a box for approx $24, or a slice for approx $6. A box has 10 slices. They have red or white base. I think it comes with 2 or so toppings. Ea. addt'l topping is $2.50. 

They can split your whole pizza into 2 flavors. We did that. 

Loved the white pizza with super soft, melt in your mouth ricotta, and garlic which is a store creation. The taste was sooo good, I said I think this might be the best pizza i've ever eaten! Next time i'll try to ask for more fresh garlic on top to make it even more like new york pizza.

For the red pizza, we had sun-dried tomatoes, thin slices of thick round sausage, mushroom, and pepperoncini. pretty good, but the flavor of the white had more depth to me..but i'm a white pizza kinda person.

the slices are huge..i should've been done at 2, but i stuffed a 3rd down. The first pizza's hot grease was super delish. The 3rd's was gettin' heavy & guilty feeling. My hubs ate 4 pieces, and said he could still have another. But I wonder if he was just saying that to prove that we did right in ordering the whole pizza instead of individual slices (which I was tempted to do in order to try different flavors). :D Either way, in the end he was right, because you do the math. $24 vs. $60 for all the pizza we got.  We only took home 3 leftover slices...i'm glad we got a whole pizza!

Oh, and the service is super friendly and patient. We stood there FOREVER trying to decide on what to order! You get to see them toss your dough and stretch it out in the air. 

The only thing negative was not enough seating. There were only around 2 parties of a few people each, and we had to take our pizza out to eat somewhere else around the hotel which was a little awkward as everyone stared at us and our pizza.",9eS8PXeTLja0e6c665WmqQ,1,0,5,MwEumMM-irovYjL5638BxQ

Secret Pizza wasn't too hard to find. Just look for people eating pizza slices in the Cosmopolitan. =)
True, there is no sign and really no storefront. It's on the third level of the Cosmopolitan, near the big chandelier. The doorway is near a pool table and some really cool/funky seating lounges.  Look for a door that leads down a long narrow hallway filled with pictures and you are there! The inside is sparse, a few stools for bar seating and some pinball machines. 

There was 5 of us so we decided to order a whole pizza instead of individual slices because it seemed cheaper. A single slice is about $4.50 without toppings. We ordered a whole white pizza with 3 toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms and olives) for about $26. Plus it was freshly made! 

Verdict? It tasted ok but greasy. I had to dab my napkins multiple times before I started eating it. I know the oil is a combination of the pepperoni and cheese but there was nothing unique about the overall taste of the pizza.  I appreciated the crispy thin crust but didn't find it to interesting. Although, I was thankful that the pizza didn't taste too salty and that it was freshly made. Nice and hot. The guy working behind the counter said that the white pizza is more popular than just regular cheese, and the white did have generous portions of ricotta cheese. It felt a bit heavy eating it as brunch. But I could see how this could be yummy drunk food over you come out of the club inebriated. =P

The selection is small but don't let that deter you. The pizza is tasty, slices are  big and reasonably priced for Vegas. You get to choose if you want an inside or outside (crust) slice. I had the sicilian pepperoni while my husband had the one with 2 kinds of sausage, goat cheese and peppers. The pepperoni was classic. It was cheesy and had large slices of pepperoni. Be careful when adding stuff to your pizza, I accidentally poured a little too much garlic powder on my slice but it still tasted really good and luckily wasn't overpowering or salty.

I didn't get the same slice as my husband because it had goat cheese but I tried it and actually liked his a little more than mine. The sausage was good and I liked the peppers. Next time I'm going for that kind.

I think the ""secret"" is more the location versus the actual pizza itself.  You'll find this small pizza parlor/station at the end of a very nondescript hallway in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  After walking past pictures and portraits of various people, you will soon reach the secret pizza.

Order by the slice or the whole pizza.  Go big or go small, it's your choice.  For me personally, I chose a slice of pepperoni and that was it.  Was it the best pizza I've had?  Was it worth the all the wait to finally eat this slice of pizza from the mysterious and difficult-to-find pizza palor?  Well, let's just say when you're hungry any slice of pizza will satisfy your appetite.  

NOTE:  Slice of pepperoni was $5.25.  Absence of seating.  Stand and eat at the available counter space or go find some tables and eclectic chairs within the Cosmo.

Dubbed the ""the secret pizza place"" it is located on the 3rd floor, situated next to the elevator, in a brown hallway. 

We waited 30 minutes for a slice of pizza.  Why the long wait?  People were walking up and ordering whole pies and they couldn't keep up with the demand.  Hence the -1 star.  They should be constantly making pizzas for the customers wanting just a slice.  When we finally got up to the front, they only had a pepperoni & mushroom pizza.  There are two things in life that my husband hates: mustard and mushrooms.  But since they said it would be at least another 10 minutes before a cheese or pepperoni pizza came out, we each grabbed a $4 slice and walked out the door.

We found a seat near the pool table and each took a bite.  DELISH!  Crust has a good chew, good flavor in the sauce and the cheese is fresh.  Pepperoni and mushrooms were tasty too. My husband even ate the whole thing! The slice was definitely a good size and I was full after just one.

While it may be as good as a booty call, (not that I live that kinda lifestyle) let me break it down to you.

Location 3rd floor next to the Sushi joint. All you really need to know is that it's on the third floor above Marquee and the shops. Chances are you will see a line crawling out of the unmarked hallway and people entering pizza nirvana on the surrounding chairs and couches. 

Skip the lines and call it in ahead. Plan for a 20-30 min until the pizzas are ready. Order a pizza pie or 2 or 3. Walk to the front and feel like a VIP as you pass the hangry people in line to pay. No need to explain yourself as there are those people who think you're cutting in line. If you got the pies, just find an open table or couch and start chowing down. If you feel like eyes are gazing at you out of jealousy because you have pizza & they don't, offer them a slice especially if it's an attractive member(s) of the opposite sex. Besides, who doesn't like pizza?

I like the pizza here because it resembles a NY style: thin crust. Awesome in the sense that there won't be the carb overload for the fitness-minded. The pepperoni & sausage is a killer one-two combo. It has just the right amount of grease that plays in a good way when you've been pounding drinks all night. The slices may be a flimsy so you better have a game plan with how you eat a slice (the fold, the roll, etc)

It may not be the best pizza I've had but when with a buzz & late night munchies, this is the go to spot in the wee hours of the morning. This cracks my top 5 Late Night Foodie Call spots.",611MiIXJkXM82I1y3Hg9eA,3,2,4,Q6SmxycQFjKB9o_CC2s88A

You could just smell it walking towards it, mmmm. Sure, there's a wait and you notice you can't really sit down there. There are a few stools and arcade games if you are waiting for you pizza to be ready. After only 20 minutes, our pizza was done.

GOOD:
+ Food: NY style pizza, thin, perfectly crispy crust, delicious! Absolutely one of the best pizzas I've had. And I've had lots of pizzas. (I might even like pizza more than the Ninja Turtles.)
     + Drinks: free refills! (and they have a water cooler on the side by the register)
     + You can buy by the slice (~$4) or the entire pizza pie (large, ~$23?). I do recommend NOT buying by the slice though, because it's pre-made and lamp-heated.  If you buy the whole pizza, it's freshly made and baked on the spot--you'll get it in 12-25 minutes and taste how good this pie really is. It really differs in comparison.
+ Tables: there are tables outside of this place to eat. You get to enjoy their pies in the mall atmosphere, with a beautiful ceiling and two areas of lush cushioned seating space.


BAD:
- Location: How the heck does anybody find this place?! Seriously. I didn't even really see a name outside or anything. It's just by the elevator, down a long dark hallway... over the hill and around the bush and into the woods we go.
- Food: The white pizza was a little tooooo greasy for me (because of baking all that cheese, the oils secreted and oozed and dripped out everywhere giving everyone a nice coat of oily lip gloss), but still was oh-so-delicious. Just shouldn't have too much of it.....
     - Also, I really like pineapple. My guess is maybe this is not a traditional NY pizza topping? But still...sadness.
     - Drinks: comes in a red party cup, no lid, no straw... and our coke was kind of flat.  For ~$4 for a party cup of flat coke, I was pretty disappointed. (However, the refills were a little more fizzy than our initial drink, so I guess it's ok. Still, I'd like to have a lid and straw...)
- Atmosphere: This place is really a nook in the wall. It's so tiny. There's no place to really sit and eat, but there are small counter-tops that line the wall if you want to stand around and eat. Otherwise, you should really get your pizza and GTFO. :) So others can order and try some.
     - There are classic arcade games and pinball machines inside, but they don't work? It's really more for looks and atmosphere than anything. It adds charm to the place, but the space could have been used for, oh, I don't know... seats?  They probably did this for two reasons though:
          1. For a classic/casual pizza atmosphere, to have some of that Vegas pizazz in that tiny little room in the back of some random obscure hallway.
          2. To encourage people to not sit around and stay and just GTFO so they can serve more customers. Geniuses, they are.

(And chances are, you may have already lost an arm and a leg at one of the tables).

In probably the worst kept secret about the hotel, Secret Pizza (honestly, I think the place has no official name and ""Secret Pizza"" just sorta became the de facto name over time) offers people from all walks of life a slice of New York styled pizza at reasonable prices in one of the swankier hotels on the Strip.

Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan and tucked away in the restaurant area (read, baller food court), you'll see a hallway that could pass as a restroom access area. If you smell pizza and you see some old vinyls decorating the walls, you're on the right track. Just keep going and you'll soon be in line for pizza, made available essentially all day. You can also tell you're in the area once you start seeing more people walking or sitting around with pizza on paper plates.

Secret Pizza has a couple pinball machines to keep people preoccupied a bit, as they scarf down that 'za. The quality (particularly of the pepperoni) is pretty damn comparable to New York styled pizza (for all I know, they could have brought some of the water to Las Vegas).

A big slice and a drink can run you just shy of $10 bucks, which isn't bad, considering where you're at. They also serve beer, served in red plastic cups, naturally. After all, you need to keep that party mentality going back at the suite, right?

My only suggestion is that the place consider a wider beer selection and offer glasses to drink out of. There's a considerable difference in drinking beer out of a plastic cup versus drinking out of a glass. Outside of that, I realized that it's the place's secretive location in a nice resort and design that has made it one of the best known places for a late night slice.",CtT0To4GaUdTJ7MhojlW4g,12,8,4,pp9kwXAI3PpcGwD-jfSnIg

I was really hungry so I ordered a white pizza slice and a mushroom slice. The mushroom was pretty solid, but underwhelmed me.

There were puddles of grease on top of my slice.

My boyfriend had the white slice and the Sicilian. He thought the Sicilian was too meaty (in a bad way), and also too salty.

We left feeling pretty fat, lol. All the regrets when we went to XS that same night -___- Definitely should've only ordered one slice each, or skipped out on Secret Pizza altogether.

The crust was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Definitely one of the better pizzas I've had, but it's way overhyped. I'd probably come back for some drunchies, but otherwise, I'd skip out.

I tried the white pizza first and it was pretty freakin' delicious.  Great thin crust that wasn't soggy but actually crunchy.  The mozzarella and ricotta combination went very well together.  All in all, a very good pizza!

The pepperoni was next and it was pretty standard.  Nothing too life changing but the crust was still nice and crunchy.  The pepperoni was a bit too greasy though, which I normally don't mind too much but after a couple of slices, I had to dab some of the grease with a napkin.

Some old Chinese fool tried to jack that shit from me and use it as his own.

I'm going to lay it down on how to get to this place.   Do not deviate from these directions.

-Walk by all the squealing Asian girls coming out of the club that think they're cuter than they actually are.  Actually...thinking they're cute at all is wrong.
-Five steps past the white girls riding the escalator barefoot.  
-Make a right when you see the Latinas showing off their newly acquired neck art ... hickies.
-And when you see an angry black chick....run the other way.  Fcuk the pizza.

Was the pizza really that good?  I don't remember.  My buddy liked it. I guess I did too.  Not as much as the Reyka tonics I was guzzling down at a frantic pace earlier. Evidently I waxed two slices, made it back to the room, and gracefully blacked out.   I woke up in the middle of the night with a shivering case of mud butt.  That means two things:  

1. It was greasy
2. It was good

Third floor of the cosmopolitan.

Given the pizza joint at The Cosmopolitan is not listed in any of the hotel's customer collateral nor is it advertised on property and one has to both know it is there and how to get to it, my hubby and I figured this would be more the myth of ""secret place"" hype than good pizza. Happily, we were wrong.

Finding ourselves at the Cosmopolitan about 1:30 in the afternoon one day last week and hungry for just a little something, we went to the Pizzeria. What we discovered is this teeny place makes really good pizza. In fact, my Brooklyn born and reared hubby thought it a good rendition of New York style pizza and coming from him that is high praise. It was the chewy, foldable crust, he said, and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. 

A generous slice was about $3.50 so a good value for Las Vegas eats. Pies are sold whole too. 

The VERY little pizza shop has standing at counter space for maybe eight - and another two spaces that are low enough to be used by both people in wheelchairs and shorter people...love universal access like that. 

But you could not get my claustrophobic self to stay in that little space to eat, so we walked to the lobby outside the Pizzeria and enjoyed our slice in that ""game room"" setting with a pool table, board games, low tables, chairs and sofas scattered about and multicolored glass lit ceiling above. 

And here goes a nod to the very nice Security guy who walked over to talk to us. ""Oh oh"" I thought, ""we're probably not supposed to be eating pizza here."" But as it turns out, he wanted to simply ask how we liked the pizza and being from New York himself, he agreed with my hubby that it was very good indeed. He introduced himself as Chris (Cosmopolitan staff do not wear name tags - a tactic that is part of a service strategy to get the employees to introduce themselves to guests) and asked if he could answer any questions about The Cosmopolitan for us. That kind of friendly approach from customer facing employees was consistent with every one of our experiences at the hotel, by with way, with the exception of the staff at the Chandelier Bar on the second floor.  ( But that's another review.)  We made sure to leave the lobby table as clean as we found it. 

Pizzeria opens at 11a.m. and stays open until sometime in the wee hours of the morning. 

Here's how to get there (see photos included to illustrate): 

a) Take the elevator near the Chandelier Bar to the third floor. When the doors open you'll see the lounge with the pool table in front of you. 

b) Make a hard right hairpin turn as you exit the elevator and you'll be in the short hallway that leads to the tiny Pizzeria.  You'll see a pinball machine at the end of the hallway. ( If you make only a right turn as you exit the elevator, you'll end up at the hallway that dead-ends in a concourse of meeting rooms. Ask me how I know that. :-)  A hairpin right is the thing. )

c) The pinball machine you'll see in front of you as you make the hairpin turn is actually at the entry to the pizza place.

I've been here a few times now and each time have really enjoyed my experience. It's nice after a show or having met friends on the Strip to just run in and grab a slice. Most of the time that's all I'm really needing anyhow.

Once you get down the hallway you walk into what looks like any slice pizzeria I've ever been in. You wait in line, order up a big slice of whatever they have made in the last 10 minutes, and find a little counter space to enjoy pizza and wine/beer. 

Every time I've been here they I've gotten through the line quickly, the staff  has been friendly, and the pizza has been good. It is a bit pricey for a slice but you're on the Strip so that's what can be expected. If you weren't being overcharged then it wouldn't be a Las Vegas restaurant.

2155270,2018-03-23,0,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"Oh what to say about this place?  I have been wanting to come here for years and years, essentially since the Cosmo opened and never did because the lines were always so long which only drove me to want to go there more because of how good it must be.  Luckily I had a concert here the other day and had enough time beforehand to go and grab some of their 'za with a friend of mine.  I guess the easiest way to go from here is a pros and cons list.  

Pros:
Quality ingredients
In the Cosmo which in and of itself is a pro
Nice staff
The pizza actually tasted pretty good, not amazing as others have stated, but pretty good

Cons:
Super pricey, especially if you are hungry.  At least $5.25 per slice?  That's extreme.  Whole pizza for $35?  Not the worst I've seen but still outrageous.  Now, the stupid thing is if you want to make a whole pizza out of 8 random slices, they charge you by the slice which I honestly get but was still in shock a bit.  
Drinks are pricey, just like everywhere else in the Cosmo.  $4.25 for water and $10 for a tall beer.  
Really long line and wait, easily 40 minutes, even if you want just a slice.  
They heated our pizza up back in the oven but not long enough so the majority it was lukewarm.

For all of the hype that I have heard about this being the best pizza in the state and the best pizza people have ever had, I was really disappointed.  I will not be going back and I suggest that people try other places and expand their palates.  I get that everybody has their own opinions but there is better pizza out there and for a way cheaper price.",alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,2,0,3,rShn2-yq6yiBLvUIo5Wyww

If you found the secret because the line is a mile long, sorry it's going to feel like a century to get in. I would avoid it between 12-2am, but they close at 5, so get your timing right! You can always call for a whole pie. The prices are pretty cheap for Vegas.

We waited and waited, and finally we got our pie box. It was piping hot. Everything looked amazing. We dove in. And it was unorgasmic. There was nothing unique about the pizza and again the crust was dry and not chewy. I threw on hot peppers, garlic, and herbs to make it more tasty but to no avail.

saturday night / sunday morning at 3 am, after stealing some money away from south point (a rarity!), we decide we're hungry and see that secret pizza is open til 5am-ish.
to our surprise and dismay, everyone else in the world was also hungry at that exact moment.
we arrive at the cosmo and walk up to the ""secret"" hallway only to find the longest line in human history!!!
well, it certainly seems to be when you're hungry at 3am!
and when you're hungry, a bunch of drunk ass college students on their first trip to vegas yelling in your ear is beyond annoying.

30-45 minutes later, after resisting my desire to stab directly in her pie hole the annoyingly loud and obnoxious girl standing behind me yelling ""pepperoni!!!"" every 2 seconds, we start to approach the counter to place our order and, wouldn't you know it, someone cut in front of us!
lucky for us, captain awesome behind the counter promptly and sternly advised the cutter that he couldn't cut the line and that he had to wait in line just like everyone else and no matter how much protesting he attempted, would not be served!!!
with tail tucked between his scrawny legs, the douche bag turned and left.
we were then greeted by captain awesome with an apology and a huge smile, got our slices, paid and left.
$26 for 5 slices is steep and, next time, we'll just get a whole pie instead.
i felt slightly ripped off until i bit into my white slice and then all was well in the world again.

if not for captain awesome and the delicious white slice, i'd probably be giving secret pizza 1 or 2 stars on pure irritation alone.

We ordered half white pizza and half sausage, pepperoni, and sun dried tomato. It was just as delicious as that sounds. I still prefer the white pizza though--can't go wrong with ricotta cheese and garlicky white sauce. The other half was a little salty for me, and the entire pizza was dripping in grease, which I suppose can be either a plus or minus. Don't get me wrong, this pizza is DELICIOUS, the crust is perfect, the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. It's a little pricey, about $30, and soda is $4 each, although you do get unlimited refills. But hey, it's Vegas, and it's in the Cosmopolitan. Definitely worth a try at least once, although I'm willing to bet you'll be back for more. Also, if you know you're coming in advance and you want to get a whole pizza, call in advance because it can take 20-40 min to bake depending on how busy they are.

I would definitely try to come here with someone who has been before because it's pretty hard to find. I would try to give directions in my review except I still don't know where it is, haha.

There is a door with no sign or anything, but behind the door there is a long walkway covered in Italian record cover art, and as you pass it, boom! Its a small pizzeria!

The pizzeria is again small, with a few stools to sit on and also a few pinball machines. It was fun talking to some of the people there who were also enjoying their pizza.

The place was easy to find since there was a long line and I think the hidden door was open.  The place was fairly small with not much dining area.  We divided into three groups to order three different pizza.  We received our first two pizzas in around 30 minutes, which was fine.  The pizza was  mediocre.  They were fairly large and soggy in the middle area of the pizza.  I was content.

Our issue with this restaurant was our third pizza.  The first two we received in a timely manner, but not so much with our third.  I sensed a problem when people after us were receiving their orders before we did.  I checked with the cashier and he said, it's coming.  About 12 mins later, I checked the status and another employee said, it's the next one out.  About an hours, 8 people in our group finished their pizzas and 4 remaining were still patiently waiting and were starving.  I was worried about them and ascertain the status.  I talked to the same person who said it was the next one out and she said it's coming out.  I was having a bit of an argument with her because she lied and was making excuses of it being busy.  I found out later that they broke the pizza as it was completed, so they had to make a new pizza and we had to wait double for it to finish.  All they had to do is tell me that they were sorry and it will take longer because it broke.  I was not notified and they tried to sweep it under the rug.  I detest liars.  This was unacceptable and very unprofessional.  I asked for a refund and it took a long time for the manager to come out.  We paid cash and just needed cash back, I don't think we had to wait that long for a refund.  Such a waste of time and this place is so overrated.

Slices range around the price of 5 bucks each depending on what kind you get. Cheese slices are under $5, while ones with tons of toppings will push the price closer to $6.

We recently had a chance to visit Vegas together and omg, he hit the nail on the head!

The White Pizza is basically cheese pizza with roasted garlic...super simple. However, the cheese will make you swoon. The mozzarella was perfectly melted and the mounds of light ricotta will make your eyes roll to the back of your head. I believe there was a bit of fresh basil on the slice as well. I'm usually not a fan of most pizza crusts but this was perfectly thin & crunchy. SO GOOD! I have to note that I was NOT drunk at the time, so take my word ;) 

*Couple of notes:
-Open VERY VERY late! Great place to hit up after Marquee.
-$5 per slice, but you can order a whole pie if you'd like. 
-It's secret for a reason. Try not to read the Yelp reviews for the location and find it for yourself. The search for it is part of its charm :)",3LOdmYe6jpwuMCkzJT6YpA,0,0,5,PGoTcjeqlECblJdyHOI_2g

2247718,2016-10-09,2,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"When a friend told me about a secret pizza place we should check out in Cosmopolitan, my first inclination was to Yelp it.  Not so secret with 3200 Yelp Reviews, I thought.  Whether its for pure marketing strategy or for a nobler cause of filtering the unworthy from pure pizza aficionados, we didn't really care.  We just wanted a good pizza.

So off we went to the overly modern, sparkling Cosmopolitan Hotel on a Friday night with the street roaming masses in search of their famed New York style pizza.  Despite having looked it up, it still took two asks on two floors to find the spot.  Both staff members seemed well prepared for the question and soon we were walking down a narrow hallway decorated with records I'm pretty sure even my parents were too hip to listen to.  

The first thing I saw entering was the video game Galaga from the 80s and a couple of pinball machines in a very small square room with no tables and chairs and a busy counter to order from.  Gratification was quick as we moved with the line.  They had four different pizzas ready to serve: cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and peppers. And basically if you want more topping, they just grab one of these and add whatever topping you want to add.  So it makes it quick.  

The pizza.  Oh the pizza was quite good.  So good that despite my low carb obsession of late, rules had to be broken and I asked for more.  More. More.  Ingredients were quality despite the low price.  As the noise, decor, and the visual overload of a very diverse group of customers nearly tested my sanity- the gooey, greasy, meaty goodness of this pizza blocked it all out for me.

NNPK 'SECRET' PIZZA

This Pizza joint has got to be the coolest thing ever on the Strip, there's no sign, none of your normal indicators that this venue actually sells food; just a open hallway line with albums and pictures-at the end all you see is a pinball machine and a throng of people.  The waft of crusty bread and pizza sauces permeates the halls and the lobby, marketing it's own original advertisement!

It's your typical Pizza Joint, Pies laid out in front with giant stacked ovens in the back; lines of people ordering and paying at the register.  The interior is remarkably chic; Carrera marble counter tops and other beautiful finishes make this the best dive to grab a cheap eat!

I was unfortunately, unable to help myself; a slice of Cheese and Pepperoni + Sausage somehow got onto my plate.  The Pizzas were just right; perfect crust-almost buttery it had both the texture and flavor that makes it an undeniably New York Pizza.  The Pepperoni Sausage was super yummy, and I can just imagine this would be the perfect place for after hours dining.

I had to take a pic of my favorite Pizza condiments: Parmesan, Chili Flakes and Oregano,  missing is Garlic, my frenemy (love the taste, hate the after effects of lingering garlic in my mouth and breath)",NVA5YEBmV_OdgCuI5RGp3A,0,0,5,bCUcWZY_QqJl6tjqkHV08g

2281250,2014-07-17,3,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"The best part of this place is the scavenger hunt to find it. The location is ridiculously obscure. The hotel doesn't even have it listed on their website. The casino is 3 floors away, and unless you're LEAVING Marquee, you wouldn't have a reason to discover this pizza place.

We found a random hallway with albums all along the wall, and I knew from reading yelp that this was the place. There was a bouncer right at the mouth of the hall, and I was half expecting them to say something, but they just nodded and said, ""Enjoy the pizza.""

Then things started going downhill. The pizza was over-priced ($5 a slice for cheese) and mediocre at best. I had even been drinking, and it was just a let-down to be honest. The pizza was not a lot of food, and the crust was flimsy and a bit over-worked to have a nice chew/mouth-feel.

The toppings were typical of any hole-in-the-wall pizza place, and the slices waiting to be served harkened a less than stellar Sbarro feeling. The place looked out of place in the otherwise impeccable Cosmopolitan, and the drinks were served in red plastic solo cups. I'm not in college anymore, and I'm not at Circus Circus... please just give it to me in the bottle, or better yet an actual glass.

The line wasn't too bad when we arrived. (Around 9:00pm) But apparently it gets ape-shit when the clubs start to close down. If that was the case, I'd definitely not wait in line for this. But the 10 minute line wasn't that bad.... too bad the food wasn't even worth it.

In conclusion, I'd say you're better off spending your Vegas money elsewhere. It's a unique idea, with a bad product. I'd highly recommend 800 Degrees Pizza in front of the Monte Carlo for a truly amazing pizza.",79FpbBtu6Dl3KGgb-qiVhg,1,1,2,u73F0FiblZpDo6QFALgcMg

Of course there was a line. We waited about 15 min to order at 2pm on a Sat. The pizza is NY style pizza where the pizza are precooked, and they reheat the slices as we ordered. I shared slices of combination, pepperoni, and sausage with my friend. The pizza was ok. Nothing good and nothing bad. However, it was so greasy. We had to dab the oil off with a napkin before we ate it.

I went here twice after going out and each time they only had 2 choices of pizza =/

The girlfriend and I ventured off for some dinner time enjoyment, I've had Secret Pizza once before, but she hasn't so it was definitely a treat for the both of us.

There's not much to this place except that pizza will be pizza and regardless of how crappy it is, I think I will always eat it. For real though, I will eat it. Here's what the girlfriend and I had that evening:

-sausage & cheese
-pepperoni & cheese
-white pie

The pizza wasn't bad, it just didn't live up to the hype.  There were some good points.  The pepperoni was nice, big and thick.  It had a really great flavor.  It was cooked nicely and the cheese didn't slide off.

But, nothing wowed me.  In fact, I felt like it was a little under seasoned.  It just came off as a typical normal New York slice.  When I added some pepper and shake cheese the flavor was greatly enhanced, but still no wow.

The place is kind of cool.  They have 1 or 2 old school arcade machines, but once again it felt like a gimmick.  The place was also pretty dirty and most of the staff was standing around doing nothing (no one was in line and it was around 1 in the afternoon.)

2322019,2015-08-26,1,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"Let me start by saying the pizza is really good.  I cannot take that away from them.  Their service however, will leave you VERY FRUSTRATED.

My family and I have taken the drive down there twice now, both times they screwed up the order.  The first time they left off one of the toppings we paid for.  We had already left when I realized they left one of the toppings off the pie and didn't want to return to get it fixed.

The second time, they did the same thing with 2 toppings.  Normally I'd say $hit happens but after seeing others complain about the same thing, they either have really bad quality control issues or they intentionally do it to rack up extra revenue for ingredients they do not plan on giving to the customer that paid for it.

The second time really took the cake and made me question whether or not I will return.  They left two toppings off the pie.  So I brought it to their attention and they offered to replace the pie.  Sounds good, right?  They even offered to give us a few slices to tide us over until they made another pie. They handed me the first wrong pie and a few slices and said it would be another 20 minutes.   They are always super busy, so that would take another 20+ minutes.  This is after we already stood in line for 30 minutes and another 20+ minutes to make the first pie.  So now at this point, we have waited for 50+ minutes for the wrong order and would have to wait another 20+ minutes.  Since they offered to replace the pie and gave us a few slices to tide us over, I felt compelled to wait and get what I paid for.

So we waited in the pool table area outside of the hallway you walk down to get to the pizza counter.  And waited, and waited and waited some more.  After getting frustrated it was taking so long, I went back inside to see what the holdup was.  I had to wait until the girl behind the counter had a lull in traffic to get access to her.  When I asked when the pie would be ready, she says ""Oh, I gave you the slices and the other pie.  That was it.""  So why would you tell me it is going to be another 20 minutes to wait, if you weren't making me another pie?  VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!

At this point we had been waiting for about 105 minutes for our correct order and I didn't have enough patience to sit around and argue with them.  So we left.  Should we go back?  We do dig their pizza but the service is so crappy that I don't think the trip down there, parking on the strip, schlepping our way through the casino just to get good pizza and BAD service is worth the headache.  There are plenty of good pizza joints in town.  It's a shame they treat their patrons like that.  Oh well",bQGOlS3u3nKkVLPir7MqPg,1,0,2,RUfVqMu5tLC6B-1lgNlWqA

The pizza has three cheeses giving it the right consistency and cheesy flavor. The cheeses are probably mozzarella, Parmesan and a softer cheese I could not figure out.They also drizzle a garlicky buttery dressing. The pepperoni does not taste average, you can taste the spices. The best part is the Italian sausage its sliced and the edges come out of the oven crispy on the edges. The crust is baked perfect crispy on the bottom not burnt raw or chewy.  It's not over hyped or over priced. Good quality ingredients attention to the small details is what counts.

I went to Las Vegas to celebrate my 21st birthday and my boyfriend strongly recommended that we go to Secret Pizza. So in a slightly buzzed stupor, we made our way to the Cosmopolitan on the Las Vegas Strip. There's no point in asking the hotel or Casino staff because the location is low key and they even act like they've never heard of a pizzeria in the building. Did you think that the title Secret Pizza was a joke?  

So we went up 3 flights of escalators from the casino floor. Next to a quiet lounge area and Marquee nightclub's exit, there is a dark hallway with decorated art tiles. From Friday-Sunday night, this place is super popular and some might confuse this line for being a bathroom. However, once you see the literal light at the end of the tunnel, it is a small pizzeria with white walls. The whole pizza box orders shuffle out in blank white boxes to maintain secrecy. Even the receipts have no brand or address printed on them.

Prices are higher than most pizza places on the strip but the quality is top tier. I ordered a white slice with sausage and mushroom and my boyfriend ordered a white slice with pepperoni. The slices were topped and reheated to order. The surrounding bar stools and eating area has powdered parmesan cheese, oregano, and chili flakes to sprinkle on your pizza.

Despite being a Friday night at 1:00am, the place was poppin with customers. We went out to a closed restautant's lounge area and ate there. The pizza was crisp and the ingredients were really fresh. This is better drunk food than you can possibly imagine. This might've been one of the best pizza slices that I've ever eaten.

Anyway, I've been here before when it first opened and I didn't even know it was a ""secret"" I wasn't into yelp so I didn't take down any notes to review the place. I decided to come back so I could yelp it real quick!

Pizza was alright. I tried the pepperoni with peperoncinis and the homemade meatball slices. The pizza was thin crust, I think? Kinda whatever. There was too much bread going on and not enough toppings!! I like my pizza loaded with toppings!! At first glance, I couldn't decide which slice to get..one had  more pepperoni and the other had more peperoncinis...why can't I just have the best of both worlds?! Well, I lucked out and the pizza guy knew I was torn so he gave me BOTH for the price of one. Score!! Also got the meatball one and it was good, could be better though.

Overall, pizza is nothing special, and you can skip it if anything. But if you want to go for the adventure of finding it, then be my guest!!",1-2Oed3A3J2lzLnRp12FWw,1,1,3,971Zy9GtdWNI8Cg9GEajAg
2354262,2015-07-29,0,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"This place is amazing. It truly is a secret. There isn't a single sign posted anywhere that tells you where it is or how to get there - which makes it even more fun.

I am definitely a crust girl when it comes to pizza. Crust can make or break a pizza for me and this crust was killer! My brother-in-law doesn't like crust and I ended up eating all of his (oops!). The crust is nice and doughy - super thick - so if you're not a fan of thick crust this is probably not your type of pizza place.

We went in the middle of the afternoon for lunch and waited about 20 minutes for two large pizzas - I consider this a typical wait time for a pizza and it was well worth it. Plus there are pool tables right outside of the place so we shot pool while waiting. 

It was a little crowded inside but this is definitely not a place that you are going to sit down and eat your pizza. You will definitely be taking it to go. There are plenty of places to sit right outside of the place but only a couple stools inside. 

Only one bummer - they don't have pineapple for pizza. My favorite pizza is easily pineapple with pepperoni and it was a slight disappointment that they didn't have it.",y_LdP8n1VcwEzoNLndbYxA,2,1,5,GheXaOgYDjrBFDfsrcTL0g

I ordered the white cheese pizza slice, and my  wife ordered the mushroom slice.  Delicious cheese with feta and garlic that melted in my mouth on every bite.  The mushrooms on my wife's slice were very fresh; she added red pepper and parmesan cheese to complete her pizza bliss.  Pizza is thin and pretty decent size; with the cost of 5 dollars a slice or 25 for a whole pie(16 slices), this eatery is a broke drunkards dream.  We will definitely  be back for a whole pie to take on the road home, or have for dinner if we lost our butt at the tables.

It is GOOD pizza.
The staff is super friendly.
We arrived on Sunday at 12:30, so the line was short and wait for pizza was just about 25 minutes. One pizza is far too much for just two people, but.
I'm not about out to drive onto the strip and deal with that madness for a slice of warmed up Pizza. So... Now I have snacks for the rest of our road trip. 

Bonus: they allow half and half.
As a pescatarian wife of a meat devouring Husband, we usually have to order way too much food to accommodate both our tastes. 
We did half white and half sausage/pep and the White was SO GOOD!! The garlic is divine.

First off this was kind of hard to locate. Why? Because heck I wasn't so sure where the location was to this place aside being in the Cosmopolitan hotel. I almost gave up on finding it. Then clever idea hit, read the reviews dork. 

I was still skeptical too after I read it since there was no sign for this place. Luckily, I found it. Great yummy pizza. Good thin crust pizza and delicious bread with a hint of a garlic taste to it. Not bad, but a bit pricey for a slice $4.50 plus additional 50cents for an extra topping that is kinda cutting it right there. 

Anyway will return one day again when I have more money to spend or maybe just get a whole pizza.

2363915,2011-10-08,0,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"The pizza is pretty good, but the price is rather inflated (I guess it just goes hand-in-hand with the Vegas lifestyle).  The types of pizza are unique, and the crust is of the thin floppy variety.  They also offer garlic bread (balls..blobs..?) that are decent.  There is limited counter space to stand at, and even more limited stools on which to sit.  They also have some arcade games, and the walls of the mini alley are lined with countless photos which was pretty neat.

My biggest woe is that it took forever to find!  The Cosmopolitan doesn't have any signs up for it, and it's hidden in this alley way to the right of an Asian restaurant, near a non-functional glass elevator, 3rd floor.  Don't bother with Google Maps walking directions either, it takes you outside where you can smell the darned pizza baking but you can't see it!

2365566,2018-02-06,0,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"Okay. So I'd like to start this off by saying I was a little drunk when we came here so it's possible my extremely positive review is dictated by that. But still. 

I had one of those classic Vegas nights out with a group of friends, clubbing and dancing, took one too many shots, and by the end of the night, we ended up here. One of my friends is a frequent Vegas-goer and knew this was THE late night pizza joint to go to, even if it required a separate Lyft drive over. 

The line was long and it was pretty late at night, maybe 3am. You can order a slice or a whole pie. I got a slice immediately (no patience and I had to see what all the hype was about) and then we ordered two large pizzas - one cheese, one pepperoni. We waited about 20 minutes until the pizzas were ready, sitting out in an area of the hotel. 

My first bite. Pure pizza perfection. I think my friends told me I almost cried tears of joy while eating it. I seriously think I did most of the damage to that large pizza and I have no shame. Based on my memories, best pizza I've ever had. I will definitely revisit this place in the future when I'm in Vegas and need some late night pizza goodness.

What's great about this place is you can get a large inexpensive slice of pizza in before or after clubbing right in a central location.

What's not great about this place is that it can get packed during late hours when EVERYBODY piles in line to get drunchies.  Minus one for that, but other than wait time, quality pizza right hurr.

Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly! 

Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat)

It's been a good two years since my last trip to Sin City and I'm proud to say that it's still the real deal! I took a girlfriend here with me on our first night and at 3am it was still open and still in the same spot on the 4th floor of the Cosmo. She marveled at how there's no signage, no listing, and I replied ""That's why it's a SECRET! Lol"" Even at 3am there's a long line but thankfully everything moves pretty quickly. True to Vegas party scene everyone in line with us was pretty much wasted and the folks behind us were obnoxiously drunk. 

We finally got to the front and the pizza guy chit chatted with us about what slices they were offering at that time. I honestly marvel at how nice everyone is at Secret Pizza because if I had to deal with all the tomfoolery I don't think I'd be nearly as patient. We each got two slices and a Coke to go. The prices have gone up from $3.50 to $4.75 per slice with an additional $.50 per topping. Still not so bad when you consider that you're in a very touristy area and it is 3am. 

Overall still a really great experience and literally a ""hidden"" gem on the Las Vegas Strip.

Just remember its on the THIRD floor, I got lost the first time walking around on the second floor, but thankfully, people were kind enough to guide me there. 

The pizza crew here are friendly and seem pretty laid back. They greet you and help you quickly to get things moving. The atmosphere is pretty awesome. I enjoy the album covers lining the walls of the entrance way. There is seating inside the little pizza shop but its very limited. The pizza it self is okay, Its a big slice but thin...even with all the cheese and toppings. I highly suggest getting a whole pizza if you have enough people to share with or you can definitely try to eat it all yourself, you can do anything if you put your mind to it.

I got myself a pepperoni slice thinking that since it's the most basic pizza, it would taste alright either way. It did taste alright mostly because it was 3 am and I was drunk and starving.

2481203,2012-02-16,2,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"You can keep your secret to yourself.  Overrated.  Overpriced.  Open late.

  So Secret Pizza hides on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan serving NY style pizza for $4.50 for a slice of cheese pizza, and everyone seems to rave about it.  I guess I'm the exception.  Not that it tastes bad, its decent.  But if I didn't work downstairs I'd probably never go.  Its convenient to anyone in the Cosmo that doesn't want to spend serious cash on an elegant dinner at the other restaurants.  But for two slices of pizza and a cup of soda you will spend over $15.  Which is cheap in comparison to the restaurants, but expensive considering you can buy a large pizza and a 2-liter for the same price at most pizza joints.  Yes, yes, I know its inside a strip casino - it doesn't make me feel any better about being robbed.

  OK its NY style, but it tastes nothing like pizza from the north east.  The slices are thin (which is NY style) and sloppy (often falling apart as you pick it up) and sloooow to come out.  The choice is often limited to one or two types because they never have enough pizza ready. The line tends to get long, and even when its short the service is way slower than it has to be.  Be prepared to stand around in this closet sized restaurant (if you can call it that).  There are a few stools at a counter with no leg room if you want to sit, otherwise bring it out into the Cosmo and find a seat somewhere in a lounge.

  Maybe I'm spoiled because i grew up in NJ.  I've had great pizza in Jersey, Philly, and New York.  And honestly in Las Vegas I have had nothing but horrible horrible pizza.  So I guess I could say at least Secret Pizza is some of the best of the worst pizza.  But I always leave feeling like I've been had.

  The one good thing it has going is the place often stays open until about 4:30am.  You will likely have to ask someone where its at, its down a hallway with no signs.  

  Bottom line, I've been to this place over a dozen times because of my job, so this review is no fluke, its consistant.  This is average pizza (above average for Vegas), but unless you've lived in the South your whole life (or Nevada), I doubt you'll find it especially delicious or special.",n-U4c31vGjJ4SE91Qa93Vw,3,1,3,sSOjr_xDfmsf_Tpt0Zp8XQ

Four Stars

Located on the top floor of the Cosmo restaurant/shop area, this little pizza place delivers a great snack.  We enjoyed a $5 slice of Mushroom and $5 slice Green Pepper and Onion.  The crust had a crisp outside and soft inside.  The toppings were nicely cooked.  They even serve beer in red plastic cups.

If you a person who is price sensitive, then here is a tip about Vegas:
1. Look at the Vegas Price
2. Divide it in Half
3. Think: would I buy this for this reduced price at any other place
4. If yes, then Buy

Example: $5 slice of pizza in Vegas is really a $2.50 slice of pizza anywhere else, which is a great deal.

It's hidden, if you were just walking by, you'd never know it was a pizza joint down that long hallway.  Once you reach the end of the hallway you go into this little area with a Galactica (is that how you spell it?) arcade game and a pinball machine.  The minute we walked in we were greeted by the pizza maker, Nico.  He was very personable and explained what would make a good slice.  We start off with a basic cheese slice, a pepperoni slice or a white slice and make ""magic"" at the end.  We told him to surprise us so he made us a white pizza w/ roasted tomatoes and basil + garlic.  Second slice was meatball w/ green peppers.  This is the BEST pizza I have ever had.  I used to love Rocco's pizza in Summerlin, but now that I've tasted this, it is ultimately the best pizza.  The price is very reasonable.  It's $3.00 and $0.50 per topping.   This is a great go to place after clubbing.  It's hard to explain how good this pizza is.  I'm not a big pizza eater, but this place makes me want to eat a whole pie.

Then inside there are a couple pinball machines and a Galaga arcade game. There are no tables--only counter space--which is unique unless you want to sit down. This place has a really authentic '80s vibe to it--music and everything.

Also, if you sign a dollar bill, they put it on the wall with the others.

The main reason why it wouldn't get a full 5 stars is because it's somewhat overpriced. The 18"" pepperoni pie was $28.50. We could have added more toppings, but it would have significantly increased the price. But if you take into account that it's at least that amount for two people in Las Vegas no matter where you go, then I guess it's not too bad. 

The toppings list was also quite limited, with maybe 10 options--all very common ones too.

It's not the best pepperoni pizza I've ever had--that one would be up for discussion--but it's probably top 5. If anything, the meat could have been slightly less salty and the cheese could have done better to balance the flavor out, but overall it was very satisfying.

I would go back here, but only while in Vegas. If Secret Pizza was in the real world I would have a hard time dropping $30 for a pepperoni pizza--let alone $5 per slice!

you can get by the slice (cheese $4, sicilian $8, white $4.5, additional toppings $.50)
got a slice of cheese with roasted tomatoes and mushrooms and it was delicious and satisfying.  chewy crispy thin dough with gooey cheese and warm toppings.  also had some cheesecake, which was delicious and fluffy, and a cannoli, which was only alright.  i liked the pizza so much, i couldnt keep it a secret and told other friends to try it.

Pizza is all right. Honestly, I don't know what the hype is all about. A slice is definitely on the larger side, but I just don't think the quality of the crust is great. Worst of all, they don't always have all the types of pizzas out. When one type is gone, you have to wait like 25 minutes for the next one to come out... pmo. This happened to me over the weekend when I wanted to order the supreme pizza but the person right in front of me got the last slice! UGH. I ended up getting a slice of their sausage, which had barely any pieces of sausage. What really disappointed me was their crust. It was hollow and hard. It wasn't as doughy as I would like it to be.

The pizza is hands down the best pizza I've had in my life. Crust is perfect, not too thick thin or anything just perfect.

You can argue the merits of all the different types of pizza out there all you want...the bottom line is that it's about balance, without going overboard.
In my opinion this pizza is far and away better than anything I've had west of the Mississippi. The crust is fresh made, but has just the right amount of toasted crunch from the oven.
The cheese is not so overbearing that it's all you taste.
The sauce on both the white and the red are amazing. 
I like the white, but I really like the full flavor of the red sauce. It tastes more like a quality marinara than it does just pizza sauce.
The toppings are all premium ingredients Quartered roma tomatoes, really good and greasy pepperoni, real cheese.

Guess what? Those cost more. It's a complicated business concept I know.
Really though...I'm the most price sensitive person I know, but if you think $5 a slice is not an accurate price point, then I would say stick with the 2 slice combo at Costco.
Have any of you considered where the hell this place is? It's in the Cosmo...on the strip... Does anybody know how much 2 slices & a drink will run you at Sbarro?

& just in case you think i'm just taken in by the ""secret"" theme of the place. I actually went inside & stumbled across it the first week Cosmo was open. I didn't know it was a ""secret"" until I started hearing people talking about it.
Then the only reason I finally tried it was because Angela H. dragged me over there and force fed it to me. Usually im pretty ""meh"" when it comes to pizza. I don't tend to seek it out. If it's there I'll eat it. But this place really does it for me.
If you have only been once I say this...
Give it another try. Everybody who does the volume they probably do for such a small shop is prone to have an off night.

The restaurant is very small. There are not a whole lot of seats. The decor is a throwback to the 1980s and 90s. Including the music, an arcade video game machine, and two pinball machines. It was not busy when we went, around 2 PM on a weekday.
You can order pizza by the slice, which costs around 5 to 6 dollars, or a whole pie. The friendly workers will pop your slice of pizza in the oven to crisp it up. This is a very nice touch. The pizza is New York style, with a super thin crust, and high-quality toppings. The sauce was flavorful, the cheese was delicious, and the toppings extremely tasty. The crust was chewy, but super crisp on the bottom. It really hit the spot! Tastes exactly what NY pizza should taste like, in my mind.
We tried three flavors: the combination pizza, the sliced meat ball and ricotta cheese, and pepperoni and mushroom. The combo pizza had the most flavor, but the other two were also outstanding. They also have a vegetarian combo pizza and cheese pizza for vegetarians out there.

WHAT: Standing in the line, I was looking for some sort of menu, but there actually wasn't one! I was somewhat confused because I am so used to there being a menu explaining it all!

When you get up to the counter, there are toppings you can choose from to make your slice of pizza to your liking, or there are also pre-made slices you can get! I just chose one of the pre-made slices that looked pretty interesting!

On my pizza, along with the mozzarella cheese, there was another type of cheese that I didn't get to remember, but it was REALLY GOOD! I also had mushrooms and green peppers.  I did get to try the White Pizza from my friend!! That was actually one of the most unique slices of pizza I have ever tried!!

Just be on the lookout for people walking out with pizzas in hand.  The place itself is usually too small for people to eat at the location itself.  

On my most recent visit there I phoned in a order for the white pizza add sausage.  I placed the order about 20 minutes before my expected pick up time.  Upon arrival the line was already out the door (Friday night at 11:30), I was a bit confused as I thought people would still be out partying but I guess its vegas and maybe people were just jet lagged.  Either way I cut to the front and check on my order and it turns out they had not even started it.  I was upset but the guy started the order right a way and offered me a slice as compensation.

Otherwise the pizza is really average, borderline underwhelming. The crust is nothing special at all, and really the pizza amounts to something warm and cheesy to munch on.

Perhaps Slightly Hidden Pizza, or No Signage Pizza - that last one begs to be said while touching your thumb and forefinger together and shaking them as you say the name in your best Italian accent.

Other names come to mind: 

1) Tasty Pizza. Full of garlic and cheese, this name is far more apt than ""Secret"".

2) Food and Drinks for Two for $19.50 Pizza. A big mouthful for sure, but so are their slices.

3) Opens at 11am Pizza. It's pretty popular with the late night crowd, but at 11am we had the whole joint to ourselves. I'm guessing all the 3am pizza eaters are still sleeping at this hour.

4) Near a Pool Table Pizza. There is a pool table out front. Nobody kicked us out, or charged us a penny for shooting a game of pool while we waited for Secret Pizza to open, so we shot a game of pool on the most entertaining landmark you will see on your way to the best pizza on the strip.

5) 4.5 Star Pizza. I'm really stingy with my 5th star. If it wasn't for a Pizza I had in New York this would be a 5, but once you've had the best, all other pizzas just try to mimic them.

For my 20th review, I'm going to share with you a golden gem secret...The best place to eat in The Cosmopolitan won't cost you all of your night's winnings, and you won't be ready to go buffet again right away! But it's whereabouts are incognito, so I will yelp you out & share the secret! After a long night of committing sins in Sin City, you must find & dine at the clandestine ""Secret Pizza."" 

Secret Pizza is a hidden gem located in The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. It's a tiny, gemazing pizza joint located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmo next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill. You will see an unmarked hallway that's lined with cool, vintage record album covers that is across from the pool table located in the middle of the room, go down it & enter secret pizza paradise! 

Secret Pizza sells a variety of bomb, thin/foldable, NY-style pizzas sold by the slice that are pre-made & they warm up for you in the oven. The price for 1 slice is around $5-6, more if you get a specialty slice or add extra toppings. (Secret Pizza also has a ""deep-dish looking"" pizza slice option, but I didn't try it. This isn't Chicago, stick with the original, thin slices!) You can also order & carry-out a whole pie or customize a cheese slice like I did. My fave was cheese with mushrooms, green peppers & banana peppers, 5 gems!!

When I stayed at The Cosmo, I ended every night/began each morning at Secret Pizza or ate there after an expensive app at Milos! The pizzas are cut into big, triangular slices & have the perfect ratio of thinness while still having some girth; softness for folding with a nice, crispy crust; and contains the perfect amount of grease to equalize the night's BAC! Definitely not the kind of 'Za I typically consume but what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas! 

FYI: Secret Pizza also has a free, self-serve/purified water tank, sells beer & has limited seating, only countertops & some barstools, no tables. However, you can sit & eat at the couches by the pool table I mentioned above.


So if you're stayin' or playin' in The Cosmo, win, lose or draw, you will definitely wanna make Secret Pizza your last call! Cuz one thing is for sure, you can bet your ass, ya will friggin' eat it all!",tOTplIk838ZR1w1huTdX_Q,50,48,5,aF5JDjX5PGX4EYE7cfr56A

($6.50 a slice and $4.50 for the water) The pizza slice was flat and very crisp. The portion of cheese and sauce was balanced so that it did not weigh down the crust or make it greasy.

The sauce is excellent--that's what makes/breaks most pizza IMO. Cheaper pizzas are either too sweet and bland or have this odd metallic taste.

I also loved that the parmesan was very salty (as it should be) but the pizza itself wasn't. That's also an indicator of bad pizza--cheese that's way too salty like American Cheese. 

Just make sure you don't get one that looks like it's been sitting out all day. It'll be dry. It'll still taste good but just dry.

White Pizza - Fantastic and straight to the point.

Huge globs of ricotta, total score.  I prefer my white pizzas a little on the creamier side, but this was good enough.  Can't complaint about a $5 slice if you're in Vegas.  Great for late night eats especially if you're staying at the hotel.

We finally found the place when we saw a long line of people waiting in an unmarked hallway. The restaurant is pretty small and crowded so I suggest taking your pizza to-go and eating in your hotel room because there are barely any seating areas. 

We ordered a box of pepperoni and sausage as well as the white pizza because this group in front of us was telling us how delicious it was. Tbh, it tasted like any other pizza to me. Pretty overhyped. It was also annoying to eat because the cheese and toppings would slide off my pizza and I had to pick it all up and put it back on my pizza only to have it fall off again. I ended up eating it with a fork.

I found out about this place from a bellhop at a competing hotel - that's how I knew this place was gonna be good and not unreasonably priced! He told me that this place is so popular that the Aria made its own pizza place to compete, but it just can't compare. The place is cleverly hidden (almost like a speakeasy) and much more low key than the other the Vegas venues. I ordered the ricotta with sundried tomatoes and my boyfriend got the sausage and peppercini. The toppings are robust and the dough is amazing - full and crispy! It was just delicious from the tip to the crust. Moreover, the guy behind the counter is super friendly, and served our slices within minutes. He also didn't let me pay when I was trying to pay for our meal - that's how you could tell he's a real gentleman! He also told us that this place is only known through word of mouth, and it really does live up to its reputation!

There are also a couple of pinball machines, which make a nice touch to being just a pizzeria. Simple, inexpensive, friendly, fast, and delicious - they've ticked all my boxes!

Had a slice of cheese, plus a slice of sausage and pepper.  I used to live in Long Island, NY, so I know some good pie when I taste it.  As close to NY-style pizza as I've had in years, and definitely the best in Vegas.

Nice, small joint, with a flat screen on the wall, two pinball machines, and an arcade video game.  All of the five or six stools were taken, but I was fine standing at the counter getting my pizza on.  I came on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all.

Marquee had just closed, and a bunch of drunken kiddoes singing EDM songs filled the long hallway that lead to the pizza.

We ended up in the Cosmopolitan more than once because...well, it's beautiful, majestic, and mostly pink!  Secret Pizza is a genius hole-in-the-wall covert pizza joint on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. I give it five stars for the sole fact that it is more hidden than most ""speakeasies"" I've encountered in recent history. OH and the pizza is delicious.

You can't really miss the hallway entryway, located directly to the right of the hostess-stand of a restaurant that has a name which I cannot recall. Anywho, a somewhat discreet hallway adorned with historic record covers leads you directly to Secret Pizza. There you will find several ready-made pies, ready for reheat and consumption. 

If the reheat aspect doesn't sound appetizing, just try it - I am a weirdo about leftovers but I am also a realist and do not expect them to bake an entire cheese pie just so that I can enjoy one slice of it.

Seating inside Secret Pizza is somewhat limited, but there are plenty of seating areas just outside of the hallway, where you can relax and devour your pizza with no shame (seriously - everyone is eating their pizza out there).",5R3m-2idPFpYq0oRwCK0TQ,5,5,5,_wG2BFI5q2rku3zaV6NAgQ

However, I had them again a year later (which was week ago), and it really tasted and looked like they went a couple notches down in the ranks. 

The line is annoyingly long as usual after the club and around 1:30-3am, and the customers in line were mostly obnoxious, naked wasted, tired, with a sprinkle of jerks trying to hustle you a $20 slice of pizza. 

Prices: 
Cheese pizza $4.75
$0.50 a topping 

We ordered: 
1 slice Pepperoni pizza $5.25
1 slice Sausage and pepperoncini pizza $5.75
1 Coke - Served in a standard red solo cup and no refills $4

Total damage: $15 (for 2 slices and a drink)

As much as I love thin crust pizza, theirs was all sorts of soggy and mushy this time around. Last year, it was actually crisp and held the pizza topping well. Also, they really salt bombed the crap out of it. It was soggy doughy, and salty. Not what I would like to expect from my beloved secret pizzeria.

Plus, there is never any Parmesan in those shakers on the countertops and the countertops are always greasy and filthy from previous drunk people. I never see any employees out on the floor refreshing and keeping the store front tidy.

You guys are awesome. :] So once again, this place is on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan. Once you get off the escalator, you go slightly to your left and definitely look for  a darkish looking hallway. I have a picture of what it looks like from the beginning. Once you find that...you're in lol. The place is small and feels like there's way too much in there, besides the people. You wait in a line, but more people come in so it feels like the room is closing in on you. Plus there's also two game machines in the entrance area. There needs to be more sitting area. 

Getting to how you order. We were lost lol. We looked @ the menu, but we didn't know the flavors of the pizza. When the girl asked me what I wanted, I came right out and said ""I have no idea how this works, I'm sorry"" She laughed and then explained it. She was cool about it. So I ended up just getting cheese. It looked amazing. So they take your slice and warm it up for you in the oven. For three slices I paid $16.50. The other two slices were with toppings.

The workers here are nice and friendly. They don't get mad when you ask questions or are slow in ordering. They're really cool.

Getting to my pizza, it was one of the best pizzas I've tasted!!! It tasted fresh, not old. It put a smile on face. I wanted to eat it super fast, but then @ the sametime I wanted to eat it super slow to savor every bite lol. I wanted to get another slice, but I was actually full after my first one. My friend got the pepperoni one and she loved it. My BF got the one with sausage and pepperoncini. He said he could have had three more slices of it lol.

Overall, I'm so happy this place isn't such a secret anymore lol. I'm coming back the next time I'm in Vegas! This place rocks my socks! This place is also good to go to since it's cheap and still good. It's a good place for your wallet ;] Also it's open super super late. So if you get hungry @ 3 in the morning (providing you're staying @ the Cosmopolitan) you can get good food and feel happy about it. It's like winning in the casino.

I will start this review with the following disclosure: The following Pizzeria does not exist. It has no menu, it has no website, it has no signs advertising a family meal deal. It is also not down a long hallway lined with old music album covers on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. It is not one of the best deals on the strip. It is also not the Best Pizza on the Strip. I HAVE KEPT THE SECRET.  Now onto the food review... for the best pizza and best pizza deals in Vegas you need to find the secret Pizzeria at Cosmo. The cost is almost two dollars less per slice then any other pizza joint on the strip ( including my other favorite at the Wynn) and the super thin crust , fresh taste and general New York ambiance just can't be beat. Although thin , the crust is still sturdy enough to bend without breaking and strong enough to hold any toppings. Speaking of toppings... unless you order ahead of time ( is there an actual number to the place?) then you will be having your pizza topped with whatever the chefs whim is. There is no formal menu.  On this day Simone and I had our choice of 5 different pizza pies. We both choose for our first slice portabello mushroom pizza with red sauce. With meaty fresh thin sliced mushroms, sweet fresh tasting marinara creamy mozzarella cheese and a crispy blistered crust this one was a winner. Savory till the last bite it leaves you wanting more... so I obliged. This time when I went back to the counter looking me in the face was a white pizza with fresh roasted garlic, Ricotta Cheese and Olive Oil. This one may have been better then the mushroom. The crust was sauce less and had even more crunch. The garlic was sweet, the Ricotta Creamy and slightly melted and the Olive Oil was the icing on my pizza experience.  
The Pizzeria does not seem to offer any sides and I didn't ask because none were needed. They do have fountain drinks and beer. Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes can be found at the stand up bar that you can eat on. Without any other choices, The pizza definitely stands alone (although three days later we went back and tried a cannolli for dessert and that was delicious as well).
New York thin crust pizza is what its all about here at The Cosmopolitan, and these guys are the best at it.",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,2,1,5,Xi8fJNjP5_EJxY6Q_ZiUtw

I tried the white pizza and hubby had the meat lovers---they were both very good and surprising not super greasy.  We both finished our slices---completely.  The white pizza has 3 or 4 different cheeses including ricotta, mozzarella, and some other cheeses that elude me right now--but drizzled on top if some sort of garlic oil.  Yum!

Open almost 24/7, late night grubbers should trek up on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel to find this gem. A dark hallway of record covers adorning the walls can be found near the pool table that will lead you to this tiny and very casual joint. 

Serving NY-style pizza, the crust is crisp-thin (eaten folded) and is piping hot from the oven with a good sizzle from the cheese. A slice will cost you about $5 and some change. I say it's a bit steep but for each bite I took, nostalgia overtook me only proving that these were the closest I've had (from the west side) to eating a good ol' NYC pizza. I got their PEPPERONI, a classic that I couldn't resist, and WHITE PIZZA which I think was mighty fantastic. If you only have room for one, I highly recommend the latter. Trust.

I hear ordering a whole pizza can make you skip the line but lucky for us, there wasn't a crowd that one weekday afternoon we went.

Ok, so I went here after a local recommended it. AMAZING! I did stop by the gift shop and grab a Dogfish Ale on the way in- may have got me in a better mood.
Asked for the famed Sicilian and a meat lover, and a cannoli. The Sicilian was HUGE! There was so much cheese it made a huge tasty blob on my plate.
I meant to only eat a bit of everything-especially because I'm lactose intolerant-didn't care, I was in heaven! Many beautiful women admiring my selection- couldn't ask for a better meal in Vegas. The cannoli? I had just been in NYC, made it a point to visit Little Italy and find the 'Best Voted Cannoli'. This one blew it away.

Fast forward to a couple days later (not 3am) I brought my Mom by to show her the amazing pizza that made every pizza I had previous to that day a disappointment. They threw a couple slices back in the oven to warm them up....
...not the same. It was good, but not as good as fresh. I asked if they had anything fresh- they did. It was 'almost' fresh but much better than the over crispy crust of the reheated pizza.

Pro-tip: Get the Sicilian, FRESH! Get the cannoli, even if you say you will eat half- you'll eat the whole thing, and try the house made pickled peppers. Just do it ;)",3A7qTai823AkGHqmQ844ug,2,0,5,EM-RYnQZS48079jaba_xEA

However to me, it's just your average pizza, and nothing special stood out to me. Not too greasy, thin crust, and a good amount of cheese...maybe I like more hearty pizzas myself...

In trying to understand the hype, it must be rated so high b/c most people that get food here are likely drunk or really hungry from clubbing...to me, the best thing wasn't the pizza, but rather the secrecy aspect - with no signs indicating where it is, I like that a parlor like this can be inside the Cosmo.

We FOUND the hidden pizza grotto but it was CLOSED. The cashier was closing up shop and the LAST 9 VIP pizzas were being made for some celeb staying at the hotel. The pizza maker was NOT a happy camper.

All we could hustle was a piece of cheese cake from the freezer...until somehow by the grace of God and our (more my sisters) charm we managed to pull it off. The pizza maker wanted us out so he gave in. haha!

He let us have the first pizza that was ready and we got cheesecake, too! HEAVENLY!! Gooey Cheese pizza hot off the oven and right into my BELLY! 

The cashier and the pizza maker were total darlings and I commend them for being such good sports. They have to deal with drunk chicks, drunk guys, late night celeb requests and so much more in Vegas.

The place isn't so hidden anymore and can easily be spotted by the lines and crowds of people. It's located by STK and Scarpetta. The wait can be long especially late night after clubbing. However, it gets pretty empty during lunch hour.

There are a few stools along the walls of the restaurant, but don't expect to sit. It's not what you call a dine-in restaurant. Moreso a grab and go type of establishment.

The pizza is thin, crispy, and pretty good. At times the toppings slides right off which is a little irritating, but I always end up folding it in half anyhow.

Suggestion: supreme. And for some reason ordering a whole pie tastes a whole lot better than ordering just a slice. We ordered a whole pizza and a drink which ended up costing 50-something.

HINT ONE, it's in COSMO.

The above is super vague, if you can find it with just knowing it's in COSMO, then hooray for you.

HINT TWO, it's on the 3RD FLOOR

Knowing it's in the 3rd floor should shorten your hunt.

HINT THREE, it's in the 3RD FLOOR OF THE EAST TOWER.

There really is no name for this place. It literally is a hole in the wall.

The paper menu you can grab, simply says ""PIZZA"" in the front. 

The price is a bit high for pizza IMO. You will be paying $5-6 a slice. $30+ for a whole pie. Some have said this is reasonably priced in Vegas? I disagree. There are many affordable places. 

With the pricing out of the way, the pizza is legit though. Thin crust, good sauce, cheese, and ingredients. It definitely tastes of a quality pizza. A pretty authentic New York style as some others have said. OH, I WASN'T DRUNK OR IN ANOTHER STATE OF MIND, so nothing was altering my taste. I bet this place has such a high review from people who came right after drinking and partying. Don't remember the price, and anything you eat is automatically great. lol

is awesomeeeeee. We got our pizza half white, half margarita. We devoured two slices before leaving the Cosmo. The white cheese is a ricotta I think...and it's scrumptious, especially when you're drunk. 

PEPPERONI
just as yummy....but I like the white a little better. TIP: get half and half. 

PRICES
are steep, of course. At $18 a pizza, it better be effing awesome, all the time. And it is.

It was good but not really anything special about it I got the white pizza and it wasn't fresh but still alright. Some people say the line is super long but not when I went.

Their cheese slice is excellent!  We also ordered their sliced meatball and ricotta slice, which was just okay (a little bland). When you place your order, they put the slices through a warmer so everything comes out crispy and melty! There is mostly just standing at their counters to eat, but I believe there were a few barstools. There are shakers of parm cheese, red pepper flakes, and oregano on the counter that is easy enough to share with patrons. They also had some arcade games like Galaga! The game was on the tv, so many faces were turned in that direction.

I also asked for a sprite fountain drink and got a free refill. I don't know if I got the refill free because that's how it always is, or if it's because they momentarily forgot my cheese slice and I waited an extra minute for it to get warmed up. Either way, I really appreciated the extra fizz since I had been enjoying myself a bit much the past two days in Vegas.  heh. 

I debated coming back here the next day for lunch and/or taking a couple slices home with me, but I was packed to the gills, no room in luggage/carry-on or in my belly. Thanks!",Kw6qblhrjvnZWfxMbUZokQ,4,1,4,ko-UON9uv7IrSYR8895AfA

After a night of clubbing in painful 5 inch heels, walking around Cosmopolitan to find a slice of pizza was never a priority of mine. During my recent trip to Vegas, my friends dragged me here and I couldn't be happier. 

Located on the third floor of Cosmopolitan between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Jose Andre's Jaleo. If you enter from the strip, see a giant red shoe sculpture and take the escalators up -- you're going in the right direction! There are NO signs, no banners, nothing to indicate where you are, so just look for the hallway with a line of people. Leave it to that long, long line in the hallway to make you antsy and even more hungry as you see other people leaving with their slices of pizza.

We decided to order an entire sausage and pepperoni pizza, which took about 40 minutes to make. To kill time, we went down into the Cosmo casino and gambled for a bit. Once the pizza was done, we took it back to our room to be devoured. It was not the best slice of pizza that I have ever had but hey, it was 3 am, tasty and hit the spot. Thin crust pizza, somewhat greasy, and fair amount of cheese and toppings.

So I took some pizza with me back to Cali for lunch on the next day.  Also made sure to call up SP to find out the temperature to reheat my slices (450 degrees F).  Even reheated in the toaster oven, the slices were still really great.  Just taking a wild guess that maybe they put olive oil in the dough?  

The only down note I'd have to give this place is the price for a slice ($5 is on the pricey side).

Luckily, trusty yelp and friends gave me the tips to find it (next to Blue Ribbon sushi, in a hallway with album art). We just got there around opening time and there was a line already. They had 4 types of pizza ready to go, so I got their white pizza and a pepperoni with spicy sausage. Both were solid and hit the spot. Yummy! And I ate it like a Californian, as my New York-born friend pointed out.",_f9NyNygDasxm4x_8K0FMg,0,0,4,5ZWqQqT5Lf5snn_aU1D-Lw

I've been hearing a lot about this place, good and bad. I love pizza, so when a group of friends couldn't decide on what to eat, this place was the perfect spot.

There's no signs, just an open door leading into a picture framed hallway. You look up at the simple menu. Immediately we noticed NO RANCH. Dang!! It's ok though. The pizza was still good without it. It's about $5 a slice for a plain cheese pizza, but with 5 of us, a couple dollars more per person got us a fresh whole pie. We opted for the white, which comes with mozzarella cheese and ricotta. It was quite tasty!!! A little but on the greasy side, but that's what happens when you order a pizza that's ALL cheese. 

It was a solid pizza spot, but for the pricing and the fact that there's hardly anywhere to sit, I'd still rather have Grimaldi's.

P.S. This would be an awesome spot if I was drunk!",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,2,2,4,OCP8xtFo8jYhf3egfQnyXQ
2785191,2018-06-08,2,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"This place is as cute as a little retro pizza place at the end of a dark hallway. Oh wait, that's exactly what it is. This place is definitely hyped up because of the secret factor. Yeah, it's pretty cool, I guess. It's not hidden behind a secret bookcase cool, or only open with a secret password cool, but not bad.

Being completely sober at noon and purposely seeking it out, the cool factor was a bit lost. However, I have no doubt 2AM drunk me would've been mindblown if I stumbled into it by accident. On the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, beside restaurants with much brighter lights, is a smaller, darker hallway. And it's here, at the end of this hallway, that you will find not a bathroom or a back exit, but pizza! 

The pizza is decent thin-crust pizza. You've got pepperoni, mushrooms, veggies, then more fancy ingredients like sausage, pepperoncini, etc. The only pizza they have ""named"" on their menu is White Pizza, which is a cheesy pizza with garlic only, I believe. Pies are baked in front of you, drinks are served in plastic cups, seating is limited. It's just your typical tiny pizza joint, except it's sort of discreet. 

Now, I know this is Vegas, and cheap eats is not what it's known for, but I still find this pizza pretty expensive for what it is. My sausage slice wasn't piping hot out of the oven, so that might be its downfall. It's not bad, just not as amazing as it was built up to be. I thought it'd be cheaper than $5 a slice. I'm not a big eater, but I imagine someone would order way more than just a slice, and that adds up. 

Overall, not a bad place for a quick bite. Just don't come during 4AM munchies hour because it definitely won't be worth the wait. Actually no, I can't say that. Tipsy me is a whole other beast that inhales cheese and carbs. Maybe tipsy you is like that too.

The pizza here is okay. It looks similiar to a NY thin slice pizza.. Only it doesn't taste as good. If your drunk then this thing is amazing. I had the white pizza.

It's got just the right amount of sauce, toppings, and cheese. It all just goes well together and I'm speaking about all the different toppings.

Anyways, back to the pizza, I'd say the pizza is only good once it is fresh out of the oven and you eat it right away. If you leave it out for little bit (like it did for one of the slices), it becomes just a really poorly made pizza you can buy for like a $1 somewhere. For the price of one pizza, I would probably not come back unless I was with a group of friends and ordering a whole pizza to split.

Saw this place on the TV show, Man Finds Food. He endorsed the white pizza which in my opinion is the best pizza they have! There was quite a line when we got there hence, my reason for stating that it's not much of a secret.

I ordered the supreme combo while the hubby ordered a slice of white pizza and their sausage pepperoni. 

Their supreme combo is comparable to Costco's combo pizza and to be honest ( as I should be on yelp), I prefer the Costco combo pizza. 
As for their famous white pizza, it definitely deserves its fame! This pizza has one topping and that topping is cheese!!! Why is it so delicious?! I think its the garlic and whatever combination ingredients they used to make the white sauce. Also, this pizza is made out of sour dough which adds to its delicious flavor. Their sausage pepperoni had some good flavor to it as well.

The place is small. Only a few bar seating on the perimeter. The line typically stretches out to the small hallway and ends at the counter where you can order and pay. 

They have a small variety of fountain drinks and alcohol. There's also a water dispenser. 

Staff are friendly and work very fast. 

We ended up sitting on one of the Cosmo hotel loungy areas which wasn't bad at all...

Overall, don't even bother with the other pizza's. Just go for the white one and have your friends save a seat either inside or outside.",6vmfgZN3IC3toXRQdmKtBg,1,0,4,h1y_KtZZpNGBckPcgTybSQ

And since he sampled a bite of my slice it was only fair he gave me a bit of his pepperoni, which I enjoyed just as much as my own.

There are like 4 seats inside here so you're probably taking your pie somewhere else to eat it. But, you can play old school video games while you wait like Galaga so that's pretty sweet.

They also sell a few beers and wines next to the sodas, but we went with Orange Fanta all the way when we stopped in for sustenance.

I'll give this place this much, the sauce and topping was very good, but my crust was very questionable at best for a East coast style Pizza.    The dough toward the middle of the pizza is too thin, and because of this..it was way too soggy from the grease of the cheese, and sausage..    It sagged when they put it back in the oven to reheat for minute, and still sagged when I tried to bite it..

I think the New York style pizza is top notch! This pizza is especially amazing because its open really late. The cheese melts perfectly, the pepperoni are deliciously spiced, the crust is crispy but soft on the inside... Too many yum factors go into this pizza to describe!

Customer service: 5/5
For the place being filled with a ton of overly drunk people, the staff is surprisingly patient and likes to describe the pizza if you ask. Also a shout out to the hotel staff for them helping my group and I find this place (it is really hidden with no sign). You have to be on the third floor near where marquee would be (by the center chandelier bar).

Ambiance: 5/5
The place is hidden and down a long hallway but it opens up to a tiny 5 seater bar with a pizza bar where you watch them make the pizza and cut it up and serve it to you. Amazing!

What was Ordered:

Pizza with 4 toppings ($26.00) - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My sister and fiancé chose a 3 topping pizza.  One side was pepperoni and green peppers pizza.  The other side was sausage and roasted garlic.  All pizza here is thin crust and the large pizza has 8 large slices.  Here is the breakdown by slice:

*The Crust - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - You are looking at approximately a 14"" diameter of thin crust with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  One word comes to mind, ""greasy.""  

*Sausage and Roasted Garlic - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - The sausage was good, but I think the Roasted Garlic was forgotten--maybe that's why they charged us the 3 topping price.  Plus, I do not think they gave us enough of the sausage per slice to make it more fulfilling.

*Pepperoni and Green Peppers - A-Okay (3 Stars) - Probably the best combination of toppings that made the pizza tasty.  The pepperoni tasted like it was suppose to.  What brought this slice up a notch was the flavor of the roasted green peppers.  

The Secret Pizza is really in a nondescript location--with no signage at all.  If you are near a random billiards table, you are in the right place.  The place is A-Ok, but I've experienced better.  Maybe if I was crazy drunk and just got out of the club, this place would have been rated higher.  Unfortunately, I'm sober.",QdaqeUbJ7VYWv9_VRrfHyg,24,20,3,HHBKHgxAxVx2SwZnwo_nnQ

Came here back in June after reading about it on Yelp.  My one problem was that I really wasn't that good at finding anything that's ""hidden"".  

Well, lucky for me my boyfriend was around and it really wasn't that hidden.  Just follow the smell of pizza and the trail of people with paper plates. 

So it's pizza by the slice any way you want it and it is by no means cheap but it's Vegas and it's in the Cosmopolitan, are you really surprised?  The pizza is really good, not top notch but pretty damn good.  It's got that nice crispy crust with the ooey gooey cheese and whatever the heck you want on top.  The toppings are fresh and delicious!

Seating isn't great and depending on how busy it is it could be a hot mess.  They've got counter seating and it's extremely limited.

Is it the best slice of pizza I've ever had? No. But it was pretty darn good and very close to home. I enjoyed the pizza we had. We had ordered a pie to go and brought it back to our room at the MGM.

They cooked mine a little longer than my friend's (who got the same thing) and mine tasted significantly better because of the extra crunch to the bread and pepperoni. I suggest asking them to keep it in a little longer if they can do that. 

Definitely worth the search. The slice is pretty big, so one per person is pretty decent. It isn't too expensive either. If you get one whole box, it is a little cheaper per slice. I suggest getting this if you have a bigger group who doesn't mind getting the same thing. I thought I heard that this place also had a ""sweet"" pizza, but when I got there, there was nothing like that on the menu.

The inside is nice and bright. All the walls were white with some photos hung. There were also two pinball machines inside. Not sure if they were just for decoration or not, but maybe you can check it out when you're there! :] 

 Overall, the pizza was delicious, inexpensive and totally worth the scavenging. If you really want, you can ask around. There will probably be at least one person or group also trying to find it, or have already found it. If you're really not down for searching, just look at other yelp reviews to help guide the way.

We had heard this was the best pizza in LV, so our expectations were rather high. And it did not disappoint! Sure, it's a no-frills place, where you stand in line and order and pick up your pizza. There's barely any place to sit down inside there, but right outside the hallway there's a big open space with lounge chairs and end tables (along with a pool table with two tip-less cues. Cosmo people, can you get new cue sticks for this table? Please?). We ordered individual slices: hubby had a meat-based slice (pepperoni and other meats), kids had white cheese-based slices with some veggies on them. They said they were the best pizzas they ever had, and if we lived nearby, they'd be here every single day for pizza. Knowing them, they would, too!

We didn't encounter a long line, like the other reviewers mentioned. We probably came at an off-time (although if it wasn't noon on the dot, it must've been within the hour, as we all get ravenous by then. Maybe we were just lucky. There was no line to speak of).

While walking around the Chandelier Bar on the upper floors, I stumbled across a long hallway lined with album covers, with a questionable ending.  What could be at the end? Narnia? Or the Springfield Mystery Spot, complete with Ozzie Smith? Of course, being the quizzical individual that I am, I walked down the hallway.  Couldn't believe what I saw...a walk-up pizza joint!

Anyway, with over 500 reviews, I don't know how this is a secret anymore.  No sign, no advertising, but excellent NY-style pizza.  At $4.50/slice, with the Strip-markup, it's a pretty good value for wasteepants late-night munchies.  And if you're not ready to end the rager, they have beer and I think, boxed wine.

This is obviously a place to go after a night throwin elbows at the club.

Pizza is OG NYC. I don't know the story behind this place, but my vision is like this. A New Yorker had his fingers on the concession plans for The Cosmo Hotel and was like, screw this crappy Pizza My Heart, food court pizza insanity! We are gonna do it NYC style over here! 

I haven't been to NYC in years, but I felt like I was there when I tasted the crust at this bad boy. 

First of all, Sicilian square slices are legit. Thick square and delicious! The selection we had was topped with sliced meatball, roasted tomato and ricotta cheese. Bomb!!
Now, the thin slice was salami and peperoncini and boy were those little suckers spicy! When I got to the end and took a bite of the crust, I was transported back to the good ole NYC. Delicious crust is tough to come by but this place has it all.

A couple of tidbits:

Tiny inside BUT you can eat at the pool table area outside
A bit pricey
If you have more than a few folks and you order soda, get the 2 liter for $6.25 ask for some red cups and split it cause a single red cup of cola is $4",ENtSjbekFHjltp2TFkstHg,3,4,4,ADE7YqsFtvz-1usZxdU2xw

It's even better if you are conveniently staying at the Cosmo or find yourself starving there after a night of clubbing at Marquee.  I agree with Jessica Y., Earl of Sandwich has some competition for best late-night, cheap eats hot spot.  Be warned though, the line is out the door (narrow unmarked hallway to be precise) come 2am.

I highly recommend the classic pepperoni.  Perfect ratio of sauce to cheese to meat.  Their crust is thin and crunchy.  White pizza is also really good, but you might want to consider adding some meat to it because sometimes cheese doesn't cut it.  You can order by the slice or order a whole pie, but it will take at least 30 minutes for them to make a whole one for you.",eCvAJt65wLit2S_MTnMNoQ,2,2,4,4HC0NBzB8RH_gtnenCRKrg

We went here right after the club. I get it... it's going to busy. But OMG, their service SUCKED. So my husband orders for me and ask to get a SLICE of the white pizza and they said they are all out. So he orders a whole white pizza instead for my friends and I (40 minute wait btw). Next my 2 friends order and ask for a slice of white pizza. BAMM, THEY GET THEIR ORDER?! So I go to front and ask for a refund because they basically lied to my husband about NOT HAVING WHITE PIZZA! The worker claims that when I ordered and asked for white pizza, it was not ready yet and they just came out when my friends order after. BUT, my husband said their was a slice right in front of him when he did ask (btw, he didn't know what it was at the time). WOWWWWW. They straight up lied! SO i ask for a refund, cancel my order of the whole pizza and ask for the white pizza slice that is sitting right in front of me. The worker calls for a manager, and the manager is more than happy to get my refund. But because my husband DID NOT ASK FOR A RECEIPT, he has to manually print out the last transactions and manually look for my card. THIS MANAGER LITERALLY PRINTS OUT A LONG LIST OF TRANSACTION FROM LAST 30 DAYS or something!? He is going one by one.... OBVIOUSLY he is trying to buy time... after 5 mins of useless looking... I ask my friend (the one that order right after me) for her receipt and give it to the manager. He's like OMMMG THANK YOU!! THIS WILL HELP! (in my head, i'm like you just need to look for the last 4 digits of my card, BUT WHATEVER). He then tells me that he will refund my money and give me the slice of white pizza for FREE.

After long waited frustration, I take a bit of this ""OMG SO GOOD?!"" white pizza, and was disappointed. THE HYPE WAS TOO REAL. I'm sorry that pizza was not that great. ..but maybe because of the the dilemma.

Was going to give it no stars for the BS they put me through and lying... but 1 star for manager who came through with my refund and free pizza.

My absolutely favorite pizza there is the white pizza and the mushroom pizza. We (my boyfriend and I) typically get half white pizza half mushroom pizza. You can call ahead if you're going to order a whole pizza and just go pick it up to avoid the wait. They also have a la carte slices but I'm a fat ass and I need the whole pizza.

A hole in the wall pizza counter in a chic, upscale hotel with no advertising or signage anywhere on the property, that provides a relatively quick and affordable (by Vegas standards) lunch or snack. You could easily walk right by without knowing it's there....secret! They typically have 4 or 5 pizzas to choose your slice from ($6/slice) or you can order a whole pizza.

There are only a few counter seats, so most people take it out in the seating area on the 3rd floor or back to your room.

I tried a variety of the slices during my stay, but the simple white pizza slice was the best, which was topped with a healthy amount of garlic, olive oil and cheese. The meatball slices on the meatball pizza are full of flavor.

Only minor challenge with this spot would be if you showed up when they were really busy. They aren't the most efficient at the counter, so I could imagine there are some long waits to order and get your food when busy.

It's definitely worth a try if you are in the area and need a snack/lunch and don't want to spend $30+ per person.",n88aZ3B8-8VsPeECSd92gQ,2,0,4,NyFjgUX8S9RDutXmziAKSw

We each had two slices - me the mushroom slice and white pizza, my bff a pepperoni and white pizza. We both ordered a bottle of water to go with our food and sat down after paying the $30 total for everything. That's nothing to scoff at when the other options for sit-down meals would have easily been double that. Anyway, we sat for a minute, chowed down, and then made our way back to the hotel room to setup for the weekend.

Nestled in a secret hallway on the third floor, this pizza joint features a vintage arcade cabinet and pinball machine, flatscreen tv usually playing Sportscenter and oh yeah, delicious freakin' pizza!

I have only frequented this place as a late night, drunken jaunt when I'm stricken by hunger pains and the buzz has started to wear off. However, this place can serve as a great lunch/dinner option as well.

3167507,2014-05-22,2,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"The not so secret, Secret Pizza, has been in my bookmarks for a long time. Since I'm pretty sure everyone knows exactly where this place is by now, I won't go to far into it's whereabouts. But, if you do happen to have a hard time finding it, here's a little tip. There's a strange little glass elevator on the 3rd floor...look just to the left of that and you'll see the dark, but wondrous, hallway to pizza heaven. You're welcome.

Inside you'll find an arcade game, a few counters to stand at while you eat, and the pizza counter itself. Yup, that's it. After you place your order, you make your way down the line and pay for it at the register. Now, I'm not sure if anyone's really paid much attention but there's well over a grand hanging up on the wall as a decoration near the register too. Maybe a slightly over the top take on the ole' first dollar made thing? I don't know, but it was fun to look at it.

The pizza selection itself is decent. They have single slices in several varieties, including their infamous white pizza, as well as full pies and somewhat of a build your own option. I also saw a few deep dish slices sitting out but they were huge, and at $8 a slice, I didn't think I'd be able to finish it all. So, I opted for just a single slice of the white. 

With all the hype, I was actually surprised at how good this pizza was. And sure, it's $5 a slice, but they are so big it was easily justified in my eyes...and stomach. Plus the flavors are great and the crust is on point. I really dug the large clumps of ricotta with the hint of garlic, and it's not overly greasy either. Perfectly foldable, and delicious. No complaints and I'm dying to go back to try a slice with some meat added to it. One of the workers said sausage really adds to the white pie.

One thing I suggest is trying to hit this place up in an off time, if possible. We missed a big rush of people just before 6pm, but as we were leaving, the line was starting to hit the hallway. With standing counter space for only about a dozen people, you might end up juggling your greasy pizza plate and your beer filled red solo cup while tourist play running back to the counter. That wouldn't be good.

If you've yet to try Secret Pizza, what are you waiting for? Surely not a tip on how to find it. Just get down here already!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,4,1,4,TzFrG3q7GmnaTXnnQpSJ8A

You have chunks of Ricotta with that hit of garlic.  So money!  You also cannot go wrong with their meat pizza which is pepperoni, sausage, and meatball.  One of my personal favorites besides the white pie is a slice of Meatball with massive chunks of Ricotta.

I don't mind dropping a few hundred bucks on an amazing experience in Vegas, but what fell short for me was the customer service here. 

When you first walk in 9 times out of 10 you'll be stopped in your tracks due to the line that is down the walk way and could possibly be out the entrance all together. Line moves fairly quick and if you're ordering slices you get the right away but if you're ordering a whole pizza it could take 45 minutes or so. They have many diff options to choose from like toppings or even red or white sauce. 

We ordered a pizza and it took about 30-40 minutes.  
Pizza was decent size and came out piping hot and had a decent amount of cheese and topping but honestly for the price of $32 for a whole pizza I figured it would be waaaay better.

So reason I will never come back here?  And I wouldn't recommend anyone I know to come back here? Well employees and staff are beyond rude. I understand that they probably deal with a lot of customers who are drunk and or rude but come on, you chose to work in customer service and worse you chose to work in Vegas where you're going to come up against people like that all the time. Nonetheless doesn't give employees a right to be rude to everyone because they know that people are going to come and eat here regardless.

My girlfriends had never been in here before so I took them to the secret location and they were already in a trance by all the vintage album covers lining the wall. Once inside we discover we are the only girls so that always helps. 

The guys working behind the counter were down to earth and super sweet. I ordered the slice of white pizza and they put a cold tomato on it once it comes out of the oven. The pizza guy was real cool so I think the slice was around $3 and I tipped him $7. As I am approaching cougar age I find I tip younger guys more.....First sign of a cougar, maybe? Shhh. Let's not talk about it. 

Back to the pie. Hot damn that was good. I could have pounded down four more slices easily. The garlic, the cheese and the contrast of the cold tomato worked wonders in my mouth. I also tried a bite of the cheese slice with red sauce. Also dynamite.

TIP: Get your order a lot faster by ordering slice by slice. If you want to order a whole pie, have fun waiting an additional 30+ mins. :X

The slices were HUGE. I swear, one slice could cover my entire face. I ordered the white slice and the pepperoncini + sausage slice.

Mmmmmm... So flavorful it'll awaken your taste buds and keep your breath nice and garlicky for the next 12 hours. At first glance, the slice looked so plain and uninviting with its layer of grease so shiny you could see your reflection. But, it was love at first bite. I just have one suggestion: an acidic component to cut through the grease! 
*Pepperoncini + sausage 
OMG! There were little slivers of pepperoncini and sausage scattered over a tomato based sauce on top of the yummy carb-y goodness. This was BY FAR my favorite. The layers of flavor ranged from savory, tangy, spicy, and smoky - L. O. V. E.

If you're stuck at the Cosmo and don't feel like venturing out too far or just ended your ratchet night of clubbing at Marquee and you're dying for some pizza/post club grub, then yes, by all means go here. It's located on the third floor down a hallway of record labels (next to Jaleo). They have a few bar style counters and a couple of stools, and the rest of the people usually end up standing and eating or taking it to go. The pizza itself is good, especially the pepperoni. I like how the dough remains crispy and crunchy and doesn't get soggy at all. They have this garlic seasoning that you can sprinkle on your pizza, and it really enhances the flavor. I also tried a slice of their veggie pizza and sausage with pepperoncini, but the pepperoni was my favorite. 

A slice of pizza goes for about $5 a pop, more with additional toppings, and a whole pizza starts at about $30. Soda is $4. I wouldn't say the pizza prices are outrageous, because the pizza is decently sized (about the size of a Costco pizza). You could say it's all about the experience here, but especially for Vegas locals, I think convenience plays a big factor.

I am actually not a big fan of pizza, more for weight watch reason. So I want it good when I have to spend my calories on it. And this worth every bite as much as every single calories on it. My favourite is their sausage jalapenos pizza. It's just simple, thin crust and so so so flavorful. I don't even understand what they put in there. I like that the crust are crispy and thin, yet the pizza is still very moist. With the pamasen and chilli flakes, I can eat half a pizza if I have burn it out in marquee dance floor before hand. 

Being said, it is in the comospolitan hotel, on the 3rd floor, above marquee. If you look for the escalator by all saints, you pretty much just walk straight once you are on the 3rd floor and look for an entrance that has lots of vinyl covers on the wall.

You can order the whole pie or by the slice with whatever they have that day.  I had the meat lovers while K had the pepperoni and mushroom.  The pizza is thin, can get a little greasy but oh so good.  Crunchy, salty, with the perfect blend between sauce, cheese and toppings.  This is what New York style thin pizza should be like.

The prices are ok, about $5-6 per slice, something you expect in Vegas but since it's open practically all day, great place for a snack.  If i wanted something to fill up with in Vegas without the extreme Vegas prices, this is my go-to",aR7CwQR6c3QFnLcdWPq71g,2,0,4,czUbyYahtPA-z61ctOibRg

Appearance:  Sadly (or maybe fortunately?), I was unable to experience the long line and see the place myself. My group went to the Marquee club before and we promised each other that we had to eat here afterwards. Two of my friends actually left the club early. By the time I left the club 40 minutes later to my hotel, I actually ran into her on the strip! It was such a weird experience since I left so much later than her! She told me she was waiting in line for the pizza the entire time, and the line was LONG. I guess the lesson learn is that this place gets hella crowded so expect a long wait. And maybe get a friend to get the pizza for you?? Just kidding. I really wish I was able to see the place. 

Food: SO EFFING GOOD. I tried the sausage and pepperoni pizza. At first, I was thinking that the pizza didn't look anything special. It just had sausage....and pepperoni...what's so great about it? But when I took a bite...idk if it was because I was slightly tipsy, tired, and hungry,  but whatever the case, this pizza hit the spot! The pizza had loads of sausage and pepperoni in every bite, and you are able to taste the cheese and the sauce. You know it's a good pizza if you can taste e very component! Even the crust was good! 

Overall, it was bomb. This was my first time in Vegas, and I was very lucky to try one of the famous foods of Vegas. I recommend going here if you love  pizza!!",wK-3LFU_Z2gFiOLQdm0gkQ,3,1,4,dHEz9UcQFRtZKw51ujEglQ

As you wait in the hallway, you can be enthralled with all the album covers surrounding you. You may even giggle here and there with some of the selections you may see. Once surpassing the hallway, you enter this white room which can probably fill up to 20 people max. It is pretty much cafeteria style where you choose what slices are laid out in front of you, will warm it up, and then serve it to you. I recommend their white pizza. OMNOMNOMz. I could just gobble the whole pie. What I don't recommend? The supreme pizza. It pretty much tastes like a Costco combo pizza, which I'm not hating. However I'd rather spend $1.99 on a slice of that in Costco than at Secret Pizza.
Lastly, you MUST order a slice of cheesecake. MUST. Their cheesecake is mind-blowingly amazing. I'm not a fan of cheesecake as it is very dense, but they brought it to another level.

After hearing so much hype about this ultra secret pizza place on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan... this place turned out to be regular pizza - gooey, cheesy, delicious. But not anything out of the ordinary. We came here for a quick lunch before starting the day (around 1pm - Good Morning, Las Vegas), so there wasn't too much of a line. Took 20 mins to get a mushroom pizza. It was a normal pizza - nothing to complain about. I think the appeal of the place is mostly its secrecy and the fact that it's conveniently located/open to service the drunchie-driven crowd pouring out of Marquee during the wee hours of the morning.

If you get a single slice at $3, it's a pretty expensive piece of pizza. However, the large pizza was split among 6 girls and came out to about about $2.50 each. They had told us the pizza was 12 slices so we expected 2/person, but there ended up being 9 huge slices. Maybe someone cut it wrong?

So what made this pizza so awesome? Well, first off, the crust was just right-- not too crunchy and not too soft... the pizza sauce was perfect and seasoned just right... and the cheese and toppings were fresh and tasty.

This is it. 

I managed to end up here for dinner not once but TWICE on my recent Vegas vacation, and we were only there for four evenings total.

The night we arrived our flight had been delayed a couple of ours. It was 3 AM our time and we were tired, groggy, and didn't feel like making an adventure to anywhere for dinner. Secret pizza seemed like a good solution. It was actually pretty easy to find- the hallway with album covers leads you to the pizza. I had a slice of sicilian and my boyfriend had a slice of the meatball & pepperoni. Total cost for the two of us was $14 - considering most dinners in Vegas start at around $20 a person, this is a good deal! There was no line when we went. The pizza itself was nothing special. I would say it probably tops Sbarro but wouldn't go far beyond that.  The guys serving the pizza were really nice too- so thumbs up for that.

Then another night, we were all very drunk by around 9pm because we had been KILLING it at a craps table and hey...they kept bringing us drinks. We were definitely in no condition to survive a meal at a regular restaurant without knocking over a few glasses or napping at the table. So secret pizza it was. We stumbled there from the casino- luckily it was just a short escalator ride. My very drunk friend was VERY excited about the fact that they had mushroom pizza on deck. I think I got a slice of cheese but can't remember exactly....I remember just looking at all the options and pointing at the one that looked most delicious. I have no clue what my boyfriend got that night but I think he got just one slice. I paid...drunkenly, because I found the receipt the next morning. It was just over $20 for our three slices. I actually don't remember eating the pizza that night.  So I think what we can say from this experience is that the pizza wasn't spit-it-out terrible nor was it moaning-worthy good. It satisfied my need for non-liquid calories and  that's about it. 

This place gets 4 stars because it serves a need that was not previously met on other visits to Vegas. I'm pretty sure the servers at Jaleo are counting their lucky stars this place exists right next door and they don't have to serve all those drunken people. It's nice to have a place to grab a quick bite and a decent price (compared to other Vegas places).

Secret Pizza is the best tucked away place to grab a slice (or a full pie, or two, or three) of pizza on the strip. With no real sign, you walk into a hallway and find a simple kitchen and a few pinball machines, and the cure to your hangover the next morning. NOT for the health conscious.

I typically get the regular marinara pizza with hella meat: pepperoni and sausage. Best way to have it esp at 2 or 2 in the morning. For the veggies in the house, the white pie is best (ricotta cheese, not sauce), with just bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. 

It is pricy considering how a slice of pizza the same size in NYC is $1. But it's Vegas, you're most likely intoxicated, and you just want something in your stomach.

The parmesan, oregano, chili flakes and garlic powder was scattered all over their counter tops as if they were having a party.

I don't feel like airing out the location completely, but try following the line of club goers on any evening to the restaurant floor of the Cosmo, where eventually they'll queue up in the hallway of records. It's not hard to find and as for the pizza, it's totally worth it.

This might serve as drunk pizza for some (or most), but the quality is definitely above the subpar slices on the Strip. This pizza is airy, thin sliced, and features the kind of ingredients that make it semi-reminiscent (#1) of stuff I'd find back in New York. I was impressed with their white pizza and regular cheese pie, though I was less fond of the pepperoni and the premium ""deluxe"" option. The latter is their signature pizza, which while tasty, isn't going to win over any diehard NY pizza lovers. Sobriety will really determine a lot of the emotional responses to these slices.

While it's clearly busy on the weekend nights, it's nearly dead in here during any week day afternoon. The staff and even the pizza is at its best around these times, and the secret spot is a good place to kill time over retro arcade games and the occasional drink. The lines aren't always a bad thing, but here's a pro tip: call in ahead time and just pick up the pizza later. Bonus points if you decide to let room service handle it all.

It's pricey for pizza at $5+ a slice (depending on topping) and ranges from $30-37 a pie. This is the Cosmo, where even a standard breakfast plate / potent cocktail is $16-20. The hype is more real here than most other eateries and certainly worth its weight in tastiness when the cravings get real.

I couldn't find the name anywhere but I did see a Yelp sticker on their glass pane so I knew the name was floating somewhere!  

I literally thought we were going to grab a slice of pizza from the restaurant next door that was visible but don't be mistaken!  If you're looking for this place, it's in the same lounge area as the STK steakhouse near the pool table next to the restaurant with the wooden decor.  I just realized how ridiculous that sounded.

Anyhow, try the white pizza.  White sauce and balls of ricotta make it rich and heavy but perfect for a late night snack.  This slice was $3 and well worth it.  It's NY style but if you're not going to eat it that way, it could be floppy so fold it.  The crust is nicely crisp with a slight chewiness.  I hope that I and the 643 other reviewers weren't too incoherent to give it an accurate review but I think I know good pizza when I taste it!",NeXRy1C7PxS7bvIcQ3SymA,1,1,4,kGMTN0k94cjxfD0Lm3wiOw

Yummy NY style pizza!  Very easy menu with pizza (whole or slice), salad and drinks.  That's all folks. 

I had the white slice with the fresh mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese and garlic.  I added mushrooms to it.  They have the pizzas premade and they put your topping on the slice and bake it again.  $5.50 for a slice of heaven!

I think most of the 'buzz' (if there still is any) has to do with the location. As the name suggests, this place isn't really promoted or advertised anywhere in the Cosmo, or in Las Vegas in general. There is not menu, or even a sign in the hotel that says that it exists. 

It's actually called the pizzeria according to the cosmo, but its found pretty much on the 3rd flood right by the elevator. Look for a corridor decorated with golden album all over the walls. When you come in there is no menu printed anywhere, instead you just look at the pizzas they have and pick one.

The costs is usually around $5-6 a slice depending on what you get, which I think is pretty price for quick slice of pizza. The food itself is decent, the white pizza is excellent as I am a fan of ricotta, but there are quite a few average pies as well (pepperoni is no different than most other places). 

I think the real attraction is the fact that it is pretty much the only place in the Cosmo where you can get food for less than $10 a person. And it does seem kind of 'cool' to go to place that is a secret... But I think that secret is getting out especially when you see a long line drunk kids from Marquee stretching out of the hall way.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,2,2,3,SdJ3kenwE85urX4iHASVgQ

It also helps that the people at the hotel will tell you as well.

When you do finally find it, you might notice that the prices are a little absurd for a slice of pizza.  And toppings make it even more.  If you're with a group, and none of you are particularly addicted to meat or veggies, I'd suggest just getting a full cheese pie.  Your wallet will thank you.

Apart from the high prices, the pizza itself is really something special.  I'm originally from the Philadelphia area where, next to cheese steaks and soft pretzels, it's the pizza that we pride ourselves on.  Even in Los Angeles where I live now, I have yet to find a truly comparable pizza place.  But Secret Pizza absolutely delivers on that expectation.  Maybe that's the secret afterall.  In any case, totally worth the price of the pie.  The individual slices are a little small, so I can't say with confidence that if you bought by-the-slice, you'd be satisfied.  But it's definitely a tasty, east-coast-style pizza.

My only other reservation is in regards to the seating area.  There isn't a lot of it.  And if you're not staying in the Cosmo and planning to take the pizza to your room or something, you might be hard-pressed to find a place to rest your bum.",401G2FY2PxEm_-bL6WbjpA,0,0,4,NFY8B8a4kgB3cdEqBqtU2A

It was inside the cosmopolitan and it was sure hard to find. It was also my first time stepping in Cosmo and it was really pretty chandelier looking hotel. Definitely a plus for the location for the pizza place. As we were walking we almost passed it because it was inside a hallway, would've passed it if it weren't for some guy coming out with a box of pizza. (Mmm pizza...)

We went at 3AM(they close at 5!) my boyfriend and I both got a slice of pizza. I believe it was $5-$6 which is decent and the size wasn't bad either. Only problem was it was a bit overly oily, like you can see the blotch of oil on top of the pizza. So I had to put a napkin over it to soak it up.

I got a slice of the combination pizza and as I took my first bite, I regretted only ordering one slice. The pizza was extremely crispy from beginning to end and the meat was quality!

Pros about this place is the pizza is very good. I don't even usually eat crust but I do here. It is thin, and delicious. Nice Variety of toppings offered. 

Cons are way, way, way over priced. A slice of cheese is $4, I usually get a 2 topping slice and it is $5.50, good pizza, but not that damn good. I have eaten here 3 times cause late nite when at cosmo and you are hungry, it's good eats and I make myself forget I am getting ripped off for a slice of pizza. A 2 litter bottle of soda here is $6.50. I never buy the 2 litter soda, but had to note the price to show how absurd the pricing is. A whole pizza with 3 toppings is $30.

Even the hubby, who grew up in PA, said it was pretty darn close to an east coast slice. The pepperoni is a sliced a little thick, but other than that, it's spot on. The crust is soooooo good. Buyer beware! East coast pie is super greasy. That's how they roll. So, if that's an issue, this is not the place for you. I liked this place so much, that we will being stay at the Cosmo next year (annual trip to Vegas) because I learned I could have a pie delivered to my room if i stayed in the Cosmo.

Yes, Secret Pizza is better than going to Sbarro on the Strip or hitting up whatever other pizza chains are in the area, but that's about it.

I had a pepperoni slice and a mushroom slice, which came out to $10.  It would have been another $3.50 had I gotten a soda, or $5 for a cup of PBR or $6 for a cup of IPA.  The pizza is totally acceptable, but doesn't compare to a place like Hot Lips in Portland, or [insert random place in your neighborhood here].  To be clear, it is better than average, and I have no issues with the overall taste.  It just didn't blow me away.

If you're at the Cosmopolitan or in the area (especially late at night if you're hungry) I would say to stop by if you're in the mood for pizza, but I wouldn't go out of my way walking down the Strip to get here, or get lost inside the Cosmo looking for it.

Both Sicilian style or thin crust.  Warning, the pizza is super greasy.  But delicious!  And for about 4 bucks a slice, it's the cheapest meal you'll get on the strip.

To be honest I don't care where I get it from, just be close to either a. where i am (club, bar, etc), or b. where i am going to be (my hotel). 

Secret pizza fulfills all that, and it has a certain enchanté about it.

Anybody that personally knows me, knows that I'm one indecisive girl when it comes to food cause I wanna eat/sample everything. We were staying at Aria and they have Five/50 pizza bar there which I wanted to try, but I also wanted Secret pizza. Luckily, my bf was sweet enough to run to both places to buy slices and bring it back to the room at Aria for us :)

Normally the line is crazy packed out the door, but luckily my bf didn't have to wait long. We ended up getting the white pizza w/ sausage and mushrooms. I was surprised the pizza was still nice and warm when he got back to the room. I was a bit scared at first because all the reviews kept saying it's super oily, but this definitely was NOT the case for us! Compared to Five/50 pizza in Aria, Secret Pizza was way better!!

I've had really good pizza in NY and the pizza here was a NY style big slice (big, foldable, and not too much sauce). It held up the toppings and everything nicely. The crust had the perfect crunch and texture. They were also generous w/ the toppings here especially the sausage. I mean you can see the whole sausage link on my pizza. I really liked the cheese on here too, it didn't have the stinky cheese smell. The roasted garlic spread smothered on the white pizza was sooo robust and good!! The white pizza consisted of various cheeses as well, the ricotta stood out and tasted fresh.

FYI: We came here once after clubbing and got lost trying to find it. No wonder it's called secret pizza lol.

-It's located at the very top floor of cosmo (3rd) where all the fancy restaurants are. Look for a hallway w/ vinyl CD records and you'll find the hidden gem!

And don't expect a speakeasy level of service, either. This is, after all, Vegas. Cosmopolitan or not, you're really just expected to be drunk and high, I suppose.

We walked in, stood in line, and then asked for a combo and white cheese slice. The guy took some pieces, threw it in the oven, then pointed at the cashier. 

The cashier asked what we ordered, and we explained that though we think we ordered the white, we're pretty sure he threw in the cheese. We also explained that that was fine. She seemed extremely annoyed by the explanation, asked us to figure it out. After repeating that we weren't certain, she asked the guy who threw the pizzas in, who responded 'yes'. Finally, she tried billing us for three slices, and we told her it was two.

Oh, and guess what? Want to pay with credit card? The machine will ask you for a tip with the cashier watching. AWKWARD. Seriously. A tip for what, picking up a slice and throwing it on the cheapest plate they could find? Giving me a terrible attitude? I hate places like this.

Finally, they didn't have tap water. I didn't even know that was legal in the United States - they only had bottled for $4.50 each. We decided not to, only because they didn't seem worth giving any more money to. I honestly regret leaving any tip at all considering the RUDENESS and attitude and lack of service.

Oh, and the pizza? It's minimum $5/slice, which would be okay if it were, you know, decent. But no, it's really the same as Costco pizza. That's not a complete knock - I like Costco pizza, like, really. But Costco pizza is also like $1.25 a slice and...yeah, forget this place.

Location: In the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it's on the 3rd floor right above Marquee. Take the escalators/elevator, make a slight left and the location is on the right hand side. If you see a big sitting area, you are at the right place. You just gotta go down that mini hallway and you are there. 

As for the wait, I think I got lucky both times (Saturday night 6PM-ish before XS & Saturday 11AM-ish before Marquee Dayclub), I barely had to wait 10 minutes for my food. The only waiting I had to do was when they had to heat up my pizza. 

As for the food it self, it's pretty good. It's big enough to satisfied my hunger before the club. They have a lot of different topping pizzas, and they make the pizza fresh every half an hour or when they run out of pizza. Although the last time I went, my pizza had so much oil I had to use some napkins to soak it up. 

As for the price, it's cheap! Under 10 bucks for a slice! The only thing that sucks was the price went up a dollar within a couple of months (January 2015  $5, April 2015 $6), but hey! It's still under $10 :)",b4icxY2z4TrtFJnROBM05Q,1,0,4,GE1ndi1BPOIGPQ_DfaFxhQ

The next day we went clubbing again and since we were staying in the hotel we attempted once more to try out the pizza.  FAIL again.  Gosh, this place is so popular.  I called from my room to see if I could do a phone order and pick it up and they gave me an approximate wait time of 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Ahhh NOPE.  

A couple of weeks went by and I went to Vegas again.  This time I went during the weekday and at 11:30pm before everyone gets out of the club.  YAY, I finally got to try the pizza.  :)

It's about $5 per slice, but the slices are pretty decent. I like the white sauce pizza, but they do have the regular red sauce. They have a wide range of toppings, but I usually get sausage or pepperoni but sometimes a combo too. 

Once you order they throw the slices in the oven to warm it up a bit so you do have to wait a little bit. So it does come out hot and you'll have to wait a little bit for it to cool down.

Makes this place seem over priced. Both places were excellent for the taste buds but Grimaldi is by far the winner in terms of $ and interior niceness =). Also there was actually service/servers at Grimaldi's too!",d3t_8Zbfx9YysPNqqufn7Q,0,0,3,14MFV-OJXuXmV9Jkkwm4lg

We were wandering around Cosmo looking for a place to snack.  The ladies asked someone at the Concierge's desk, and then we were directed to what looked like a restroom hallway.  lol  When we got to the end, it was (from what i've been told) a typical NY style joint in that the pizza place didn't really focus too much on having much available seating.  

We weren't sure how to order at first since they were cooking a bunch of what appeared to be simple pizzas.  I don't recall seeing any kind of signs or food descriptions, or prices for that matter.  We witnessed someone customizing their pizza and decided to do the same.  We started with a naked veggie pizza, and then added on to it.  My wife added tomato slices and meatball slices.  I did the same, but also added some green peppers.  They added the items and threw the pizzas back into the oven to heat/cook the newly added ingredients.  

Pricing was okay.  I probably would have enjoyed it more though had the price been $4 instead of $4.75 per slice.  Or I guess a bigger slice would have also made the $4.75 price feel better.  But hey, it was a nice snack to hold us over.  ;)",aSh4vh9eqQKVXUW26XbwHQ,0,0,3,HLCFD6Pg02HPKcaqjdwtyw

We decided on a couple of slices and sodas instead. The cheese slice was decent but the crust was wayyyy overdone. Pepperoni was extremely greasy with an obscure amount of garlic!

3449199,2014-04-07,1,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"At the end of a walkway hall with records is some hidden pizza. This place has no signage and is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan. It's hidden... yet tons of people seem to be able to find this place and devour their pizza. Proof that if you offer something good, people will find you. 

I came here with my friend after watching Rose. Rabbit. Lie. I had one drink there... but it was sooo strong that it made me feel sick and I was in some dire need of some quick comfort food to ease my tummy.

We looked for this place on the signs... none of which says Secret Pizza anywhere... so I looked on my trusted Yelp for clues. Like I said initially,  it's located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel. It's in a corner... but if you spot the pool tables (which are easily visible) the wall of records leading to Secret Pizza is right in front of it. 

The hallway is not too long... but it feels very exclusive/secret at you have to walk this hallway to get to it. Lol. The pizza place itself is very small with very few seats. My friend and I beat the crowd because we were able to get seats and have no line, well, only 2 people in front of me. After I got my pizza and came back to my friend who was saving seats... the place was packed! Even just standing it was packed!

Anyways, as far as it being just one slice of pizza... the price was okay. I'm used to Costco's $2 slices haha. Here, they have pizza with the red sause (tomatoe) or white sauce. A cheese slice is $4.50, white is $5, or red with toppings is $5.50. I had a red slice with pepperoni,  sausages,  and mushrooms. The pizza was good!! Very tasty and the crust was cripsy. I loved it! A nice warm cheesy, crunchy, savory,  and tasty bite each time. The slices are pretty big... so for $5.50 it wasn't too bad! Of course I ate the whole slice and my stomach was satisfied. So glad we came here and got some pizza to counter the alcohol I was carrying in my stomach. It was the perfect counter to drinking in Vegas. Just beware that the slices are pretty greasy... so if you're worried about that, use napkins to soak up some before you eat!

Service here was nothing special. Not good, not bad. Seating is bar style on 2 walls... but there's only like 5 chairs I saw? Definitely not enough for everyone to sit... the rest of your party will have to stand... ot take it out to the pool table area where there are a few couches around. Chili and permeasean cheese are out at the bar area along with napkins. They also have a pinball machine here! I'm not sure if it works as I didnt notice anyone playing it.

This place is open all nigh, and late night too. So it's perfect after a night out in Vegas of drinking, dancing, partying. Its hidden.... but if all the stumbling drunk people can find it, then you can too!! 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan hotel near the pool tables... just follow the wall of records!",4AYfs8d7M2H4TBEiHhHTdQ,1,1,4,lBj22rhPRSscyCpUrlMcYA

Finding this place was an adventure, partially because it's hidden/not listed anywhere and also because I was already three sheets to the wind and would probably have a hard time finding it even if I didn't have anything to drink.  Alas, do not discount the determination of two twenty something males with a craving for some late night pizza.

The actual pizzeria wasn't terribly big and thankfully wasn't crowded when we went so ordering and paying for our slices was relatively fast.

It's literally a hole in the wall with cool old school decor. There's a small area with bar seating for maybe less than 10 people, so it's really a grab-n-go kind of place. I saw people ordering whole pizzas to take back to their hotel room.  

The pizza is about $5-6 a slice. I thought it was a little step at first, but the slices are HUGE, probably about double your normal pizza slice. I got a regular cheese pizza slice, and my friends got white pizza. It was SO FREAKIN GOOD... probably the BEST pizza I've ever had at 1AM, tired, and coming out of a night club. Only pitfall was that it was a little oily, but I mean, what pizza isn't? That's what makes it so bomb. I would have gotten more slices if I didn't care about fitting into my dress the next night.

Their sausage is of great quality, but that's about all I can say. Slices aren't large like Brooklyn ones, and this isn't a secret anymore. Is it decent West Coast za? Definitely.

Thankfully, I came in the afternoon so there was no line to wait in. As it was my first time, I decided to ask the workers for recommendations. We ended up getting a white pizza with mushroom and sausage, and a traditional red pizza with sausage. Both were delicious and satisfying - sometimes you just need a good slice of pizza as a break from all the rich, fine-dining type of food in Vegas. At first, I thought just one slice wouldn't be enough. But wash it down with an ice cold beer and you have yourself a meal.

Stumbled into the long, unmarked hallway at three o'clock something in the morning after a night at Marquee. Probably waited 30 minutes with the other drunkards. One of our party fell facefirst into a couch in the Cosmopolitan lobby waiting for us to get his re-up.

Pizzas are $5 per slice. Not cheap, but worth it. The server provides some clever banter while the cashier is all business. I'm a straight cheese, homey kind of guy. Need that red sauce, though. Friend swore by the white pizza, but the cheese was money. Also got that pepperoni, sausage, veggie, and other mix and match optionality. Or build your own pizza and sell it in the hallway.

Why? Because as we left, the line doubled in size. You walk out with your slice, loaded up with parmesan and red pepper flakes, and everyone ooh's and ahh's at the deliciousness. Jealousy abounds.

Sit down on one of the couches or seats in the third floor lobby. Fold that slice long ways: for the paper airplane inclined, that's hot dog style, not hamburger style. Get that sucker in your mouth. Prepare to be amazeballed.

Got our friend his re-up. Not a moment too soon. Another guy was completely passed out and the cops asked if he knew who and where he was. Not our problem; we got our guy. The pizza rejuvenated him...to lose more money gambling. You're welcome, Vegas.

Went back two days later sober to make sure the pizza was legit. No line. Still was.

For 26 bucks, you can get a 3 topping pizza (they only have one size by-the-way) that blows away every other za in town. I highly recommend the sausage and the meatball as two of those toppings. Not that hungry? Then just grab a slice or two.

Add 5 bucks for valet parking, take the great glass elevator to the top (just don't press that special button Charlie) and you can be enjoying one of the best slices of pie you've had since they threw you out of NYC.

This review is only based on yesterday's service/experience. 

I have been to Secret Pizza numerous times, basically it's a must every time I go to Vegas. It's a combination of going after the club, mid-day snack, and even going the morning before heading back to LA. Yeah, it's great pizza, we all know that. However, last night around 11pm, I was so upset with Secret Pizza, I couldn't enjoy pizza because of the attitude and up charge! I went there ahead of my boyfriend as he told me to go first while he cashed out downstairs at the casino. Since it was only 11pm in Vegas, there was no line. Yes! The beauty of not getting Secret Pizza post-club. By the time I was about to order, 5-7 people started forming a line before me. My boyfriend got to me as soon as I was about to order and told me he wanted any sausage slice. The guy behind the counter rudely in a harsh voice told my boyfriend, ""You, go to the back of the line"". I mean, come on, I was going to order for my boyfriend either way. He's not cutting. He came to me to let me know what he wanted. We were not in any way behaving improperly or drunk or even doing anything wrong to be spoken to in that manner. Then when I went to pay for my two slices of pizza, the woman at the cashier said ""what did you order?"", I stated ""one sausage with toppings..."", she entered $6 on the register- understandable. I gave her my credit card and I then told her, ""second slice is just sausage""...and again, she entered $6 on the register- not understandable. I asked why the $6 charge on the plain sausage and she didn't bother to explain and  charged my card and gave it back to me and moved on to the next customer. I didn't even get the chance to get an answer or reasoning behind her over charge. Thanks.

3614295,2017-06-16,17,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"Secret Pizza may be the worst kept secret in the Western World; even worse than the ""secret menu"" at In-N-Out Burger.  

The myth of secrecy now completely debunked, let's start with directions to Secret Pizza: Take the elevator near the Cosmopolitan's Chandelier Bar to the 3rd floor. You'll see a lounge with a pool table in front of you when the elevator doors open. Make a hairpin turn (hard right) as you exit the elevator and you'll see a short hallway completely plastered with vintage record album covers; this is the hallway that leads to Secret Pizza.

They serve three kinds of New York style pizza here: white, red, and Sicilian.  On my most recent trip to Sin City, I visited Secret Pizza twice - once on Friday night and once on Saturday afternoon.  On Friday night the line was all the way down the hall; we waited for over an hour to get to the counter.  On Saturday the wait was really short, but they were out of Sicilian :-(

The main idea behind my Saturday visit that trip had been to try the Sicilian, but they were all out when we got there!  However, both the red and the white pizza were surprising good, so my pizza Jones and I made due.  I ended up trying the red and white slices both times.  The toppings I chose were Sausage and Pepperoni on the red slice, and sun-dried tomatoes on the white.  On my Saturday visit I added garlic to the red and the white; both are MUCH better with garlic!  

Let's talk about the pizza in detail.  The classic NY pizza is a simple slice of cheese pizza that's shaped and sized a certain way, with the crust discernibly thicker on the edges.  It's also got to have what I like to call ""independent suspension"".  This means that even with a decent load of toppings, the crust most be firm enough to eat with your hands either as-is, or folded in half.  The crust at Secret Pizza is totally legit; it's shaped exactly like NY pizza is supposed to be shaped and it's got wonderful independent suspension.  The toppings are premium; super-sized, and very tasty, and the crust is chewy, not soggy, and tastes great.

Strangely enough, the pizza was better on the Friday night when the line was colossal; the slices didn't get cooked enough on Saturday, even though the lines were short.  The slices were still pretty darn good though.

Despite how exceptionally busy the staff is, they're efficient, good humored, and informal.  How informal?  I brought my own bottle of wine and asked about a corkage fee; the dude behind the counter just handed me a corkscrew and said, ""go for it!""",Rm-lTmUSoOt2Y13i27vCZg,20,21,4,E54kIPszDaur8YBe-vhgsQ

I have to agree with others that the idea of the ""secret"" pizza is pretty cute. My husband and I were quite excited at the challenge of finding this sneaky spot. It's true that there's no sign to be found and it's down a random hallway in a random spot of the Cosmopolitan. However, it's clearly not much of a secret anymore and with the hints other Yelpers gave before me, my husband and I found its ""secret"" location in about two seconds. That was a little bit of a let down. Maybe to keep things spicy, Secret Pizza should move its location around. I realize this may not be the most practical idea, but it certainly would keep customers on their toes! ;)

I'll keep this simple since the gazillions of reviews have already said what needs to be said. The pizza is good. It's not gourmet and it's not incredible, but it's good. I'm sure it's especially good if you're drunk and ready to feed the craving. Unfortunately, like every other Vegas place, the prices here are a bit steep. $24 for four slices of pizza! Oh well, I've come to assumption that good food is hard to find on the strip and this is a quick stop for some tasty pies. I'm sure I'll be back the next time I'm in town.

I've waited over an hour for a slice but it's totally worth it when all you really want is a greasy, tasty, cheesy slice. It helps they are open 24 hours.

The service to start with was pretty shitty and probably discriminatory.

So grab one after the club. It's literally the closest thing to Marquee after hours. Ill admit it's a cool kid hangout before or after the club since there's a pool table to play on and it's free. It's near the bathroom so that's always nice. Pizza here runs about 5 bucks a slice, you won't be breaking the bank and the slices are huge. 

However the reason why I'm not in love with this place and jumping for joy is because the wait here just sucks. Since Marquee is also a day club, getting pizza here during the day takes some time as well. The pizza here is good, not great nor amazing. So I can't validate waiting in line for 30-45 for a slice of pizza. It's a long hallway and people stand in line for each other, and hungry and long waits just don't go together. They also don't serve ranch here either but it's not the end of the world.

What makes it more fun is that it's known as ""secret pizza"" and it's like $4 a slice. Dude, $4 isn't even gonna get you water in Marquee!

The guys in there are hilarious always chatting up the folks, drunk or sober.
One of 'em even told me the story of why they call the white pizza, ""the sunset.."" Let it be known that the cheese are the clouds and the tomatoes in the middle are the sunset...So romantic *blushing*

Even though mushrooms are my favorite pizza, I really love their white pizza. And all it is is cheese, sauce, and tomatoes. It's sooooo simple and yet, oooohhh so good.

In fact, I was debating on writing this review because I don't wanna tooo many people to crowd my fave food spot in Cosmo. But, this was too good not to share!",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,2,2,5,ThVbz2nXI8qiZZHI2rXE1w

There is a free water station (in vegas you don't see too many of those) and a variety of pre-made pizza that is reheated to your delight.  I came around 1:30 p.m. on a Saturday, and it wasn't too busy but I can certainly see how it can become packed as the space is pretty small.

If you can't find that, just go to the 2nd floor and if you hear a bunch of loud, drunk kids, or see long lines, you've found the spot.  

You could buy pizza by the slice, or buy a whole pizza.  Whole pies will take around 15 to 20 mins while slices take a few mins as sometimes they warm em for you.  They have cheese, pepperoni, and a garlic white cheese which was my favorite.  Price wise, for the strip you can't go wrong as everything is so expensive on the strip.  Taste wise, its thin sliced and was above average to me.  I'm sure there are better pizza options, but for its location and price its pretty darn good.

My bf and I got the mushroom pizza and were still pretty hungry afterwards so we went and got the meat pizza as well. The pizza is pretty thin which I like and it's pretty good. The price is at $5 per slice which is pretty pricey but that's to be expected everywhere in Vegas so that's not such a big deal. Overall, I would definitely come back here if I was craving pizza, especially late night pizza because they're open pretty late (or should I say early).

I got a slice of the white pizza. My friend got the veggie. The pieces are large, so one is good if you are only moderately hungry. We wanted a post-concert bite (since we'd only had a snack before) and this hit the spot.

It took a little while to find this place since there are no signs, but since I was a little tipsy and impatient of just walking around, I kindly asked one of the security bouncers where it was and he pointed me right to it. 

I feel like people would want to go to this pizzeria only because it's sort of a novelty - there's no sign, it's hidden in a long hallway with old school arcade video games, and you feel special when you know where it is since not many people do. 

The style of pizza served is NY pizza - it's got that nice thin crust and large cut slices. The pricing per slice is very reasonable and they're open late for the after clubbing crowd to get their late night munchies.

Although part of the cool factor is the undisclosed nature of its location, it is not too hard to find when you see the crowd of people on the third floor with slices of pizza in their hand...  ;)

When you walk down the corridor, you are invited by the smell of pizza wafting in the air.  It is a surprisingly lively joint that is reminiscent of an old school pizza joint lined with pinball machines and a huge oven to heat/reheat pizzas.  Whenever I come there is usually a line of some sort so be prepared to wait a little. 

There are several ways to order here.  You can either get a whole pizza or get it by the slice.  From there, you can order one of their set pizza slices or create your own.  One slice was pretty filling but if you have a big party then it may be worth buying a whole pie.  It takes about a 10-15 minutes for them to heat up a slice if it has already been made but that wait is well worth it when you get that nice hot slice of pizza.

As implied earlier, the service is decent and fast.  There isn't really much seating inside but there are seats outside in the Cosmo area.

I mean, I'm sure those pizza makers are GENUINELY grumpy, they have to serve up a steady stream of pies all day long, deal with stupid questions, drunk hotel guests, people bringing in giant crowds AND people who whine about them not having their kind of pizza ready.

But the brick walls, the white t-shirt and apron outfits, the old pictures, and the pinball machine (which is obviously just there to help develop the ambiance because there is NOT enough room for it to be there) are just a bit forced. I mean, everyone knows LV is a place of many tastes and cultures, but I'm a little off-put by fabricating a NY pizzeria in the middle of your hotel/casino. I think my problem is, that while LV has a ton of recreations of things and places, they are all loaded up with kitsch, and secret pizza keeps the kitsch minimal- like they are going to trick us into not noticing what they're going for.

Okay, if you've read this far, you're probably like ""Why is this girl giving them 4 stars if she's just gonna complain about stuff?"" And to you I say, ""SORRY- had to get it out of my system.""

Complete with pinball machines and an old school Galaga arcade game, it gave me a feeling of stepping back in time.

You can order a variety of slices, which are quite large, or just a whole pie. The crust is thin, the toppings are plentiful, and the cheese is melted just right. You can even have your slice made with ""white"" sauce instead of ""red"" sauce. In hindsight, it may be smart to ask for marinara sauce to dip your pizza crusts into once you have finished your slice.

I am led to believe that most reviews here were written by those who did not have a 100% sober experience of the pizza (since it seems that this place is frequented by post-clubbers of Marquee). I would probably agree if I were in their shoes as well.

We swung by for a quick bite early Saturday afternoon before hitting up the casino. The place is not easy to find! We had to consult yelp photos to get an idea of where it's hidden. The place is really small, with very few seats. We noticed that most people take their pizza to-go and sit out in the open areas of Cosmo to eat.

Slices are expensive ~$5! The toppings are really limited (usually 1-2) by which types of pizzas they have out at the moment. The line moves relatively quickly, but the pizza is fairly cold by the time you get it since it has just been sitting out. They are pretty hefty in size -- just 1 slice can be filling. I was pleased that the crust and dough throughout were not soggy at all, even if it was thin.

Walk down the alleyway and it will lead you to the best kept secret in Las Vegas!

Once you get inside you will notice it is a very small place. There's no waiter service. There's very little room for you to sit and eat. You might think to yourself ""WTF? This is just like any other hole in the wall pizza joint"". But don't let that fool you! 

This was my first time here. I only came here upon my friend's recommendation. I decided to skip the fancy buffet to try something new. When I first walked in I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting a large fancy pizza place. I thought to myself ""why is this place so popular?"". There were no signs that said ""we're famous for blah blah blah"". So I asked the employee what they were famous for. The guy told me this place is famous for it's ""White Slice"".

I recommend getting the white slice with pepperoni. The original white slice itself will not come with any meat or toppings. The flavor and taste of the white slice is quite unique. It is something other pizza places do not offer. It is a taste unlike any I've ever tasted before. If I had to describe it in words I would say cheesy, garlicky, and damn good!

Think I prefer more of a rustic style pizza that is a litte more burnt around the edges and slightly more chewy.

They don't have it marked on any of their directories, and the front desk staff will remind you where it is with a hand drawn circle in an empty space on the property map.

We arrived around midnight and it wasn't too crowded. I was more in awe of all the old records on display down the main hallway you walk down to get to the small pizza parlor. If that wasn't cool enough, they had some retro pinball games waiting for you, too. I had total ADD and couldn't focus on the pizza and I was too busy scoping out the room. It's not like I really had to pay attention to what I was ordering - I knew i was going to get pizza, and I was okay with making a last minute decision and pointing at the one that looked the most appetizing.

With that being said, I went with pepperoni and sausage and they warm the slices up to you while you're waiting to pay. Once you've finished your transaction, you're given a hearty slice of pie served piping hot. We took ours back up to our room as seating is pretty non-existent, and if you do find a spot, it's probably going to be standing room only.

We must've made it right in time, because minutes after arriving, there was a huge line down the corridor we had just entered, and it was wrapping through communal restaurant spaces pretty quickly. Again... not so secret, especially since it was a Wednesday night!

We enjoyed our late night snack. Slices range from $5-$7 depending on what you want on it. Just note, if you're buying multiple of the same slice, it's way cheaper to just buy a whole pizza! Someone was doing the math while in line, but it also takes a while longer, so you gotta weigh out those pros and cons.

Food was great. B or B+ rating, four slices and two drinks for just over $30.00. Service was quick and polite, which is always a plus. 

Cleanliness, not so great, counters and fixtures on the wall could have been wiped down and / or dusted. There is a Galaga video game and two pinball machines, only one of the three arcade games worked.

Going into this place, We (my wife and I) walked down a hallwall, surrounded by record albums. HUNDREDS OF THEM! Too cool. Then it just stops. 
A) I am suddenly in a subway station.
B) I am in a bathroom with tile walls.
C) I entered a place known as ""Secret Pizza""

There are NO signs outside the entrance, or from what I saw, in the casino itself. Luckily, my wife and I parked in valet. The attendant asked where in The Cosmopolitan we were headed. When I asked about ""Secret Pizza"" he smiled and gave us perfect directions. When we returned to pick up our vehicle, the lady who brought the car back, asked how our pizza was.

We ordered the 3-topping pie ($26 for a large size). Pepperoni, mushrooms, and ricotta. Made to order thin crust. It was delicious. Definitely flavorful, without too much sauce, and not overwhelming.

The Pizza: Delicious Giant Slices of Wonderment. However, don't be fooled into thinking you don't have options. They have pizza available that's already out and on display, but things are coming out of the oven all the time and they will add extra toppings to their slices for you. Also everything tastes better with Dogfish Head IPAs. (Which is a beer if you're curious).

Not hard to find if you're looking for it, but you're not going to know it's an establishment if you don't. Tiny little place, no room for seating unless you count the top of the pristine Galaga Machine or go when one of the five seats aren't taken. This place is probably to be avoided if you hate lines or crowds and you go during peak.

I got out of there for $15 bucks: Two Giant Slices and a Dogfish Head. This is a great deal on the strip. Also as a bonus: the girl at the cash register was crazy hot. According to my friends, I of course am not in the habit of oogling random females; they are the childish barbarians.

I usually pay a visit in the middle of the night (usually after Marquee Night Club) to sober up a bit before making my way back home.  Line is usually long after 1:30AM, and you will usually spot it with people piling along a corridor with others walking out with 1 slice, 2 slice, or even a whole pizza box full of the gooey goodness.  

You can't just order any toppings on one slice, it's whatever they have already made, however if you choose to order a whole pizza, you may very well choose any topping to your desire!  They usually have their most popular ones like the white pizza or the sausage and peppers and they always have pepperoni, cheese, or sausage or a meat lovers available.  If you don't see what you want or crave, you can also kindly ask what else they have, because sometimes theres others ones on the bottom that they don't put out until they have sold out of the ones already on display. 

There's no sign outside of the pizza place, simply make your way to the third floor, look for the tube elevator and a corridor with lots of record labels and you are in the right area.

GET: the White Pizza(Ricotta & Cheese) this one usually sells out, based on how much Ricotta Cheese they have available. 

PRICE:  is comparable to your mall pizza slices(around $5 a slice), I would order a whole pie since the price is $24 which gives you 10 slices. Slices are pretty decently big. But, your going to be eating more than one slice.

As an east coaster I've eaten tons of NY pizza and its imitations... And this slice was up there with the best. If only the bottom of the crust were slightly more blackened and cracker-like would it be the real deal.

Once you step off the escalator, look for a nondescript hallway, no signs, no nothing but  quite possibly a looong line of people. Congratulations, you've unlocked their ""secret"" venue, now prepare yourself for a good 30 minute wait. I won't lie. It's pretty much torture, especially if you've found yourself here after club hours like myself. You can try your best to entertain yourself with the semi-neato-skeeto album covers but who are we kidding, anytime you get a whiff of that delicious pizza or someone exits the venue and walks past you in that narrow hallway, you're reminded how you're STILL in line and STILL not stuffing your piehole with, well, pie.

After you've managed to snake yourself to the end of the hallway, you can start eyeballing which pie is destined to be yours, individual slices or a whole pie? I opted for the latter and had to wait longer but it was worth it. I got half mushroom & pepperoni and the other half was ricotta and garlic. I enjoyed both types immensely but favored the white pizza and would gladly bathe in slices of this pizza - so good! Uber good!!

Pizza had a nice chewiness and the cheese was cheesy goodness. Definitely hit the spot! I ordered a large pizza and ducked out to one of the open tables just to the left upon exiting the hallway and inhaled my little slice of heaven.

Oh, by the way. You might see some unusual happenings while in line. For instance, one girl got to the cashier, turned around, lifted her dress and shook what her mama gave her. My friend and I turned to look at each other and mentally said, ""Did you just see that?"" while one other patron yelled out ""Does that get you free toppings?"" Hahah, we all laughed.

Anyway, duty called (boyfriend back in hotel room patiently waiting) so I paraded out of The Cosmopolitan and made my way over to MGM. Unfortunately BF was passed out, sad story for him, but happy ending for me: I plopped down in our living room and helped myself to another slice :)

So my verdict?

Worth the wait? Unfortunately yes.

Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor across the billiard tables and chandelier. 

There's an element of mystery when trying to find this place because the hallway leading up to the actual pizzeria has no signage or pizza advertisements. You can easily find it, though, when you see people walking out of the hallway carrying their food out... I felt like Alice going to Wonderland except there's pizza on the other side, and not talking flowers and such. It's kinda cool knowing that this place is literally a hole in the wall, especially since the NY style slices offered here are really good.

The interior is pretty small and it can get packed so fast. There's very limited seating (I only saw like two or three chairs) and then the rest is standing area. There's a few arcade games in there as well. 

Overall, the pizza was slightly doughy and had a bit of crunch to the bottom of the slice. I had two slices of pizza: a white pizza slice and a mushroom one.

The white pizza with ricotta was so good. I think the ricotta elevated the flavor of the slice because when I bit into it, my mouth was hit with the rich, cheesy goodness. The mushroom pizza didn't really have that strong of a mushroom taste, probably because the mushrooms were more like small bits scattered all over the pizza slice. It had a very subtle mushroom flavor going on. I ended up spending $11 on the two slices of pizza. 

I think the pizza is a little pricey (what isn't on the strip?), but so worth it. In my opinion, I'd say I believe in the hype this place has got.

There are no signs that point to their location that I knew of. The establishment itself didn't even have a sign upon entering. I found out that they were 

LOCATED on the 3rd floor of the cosmo. There is an entrance hallway next to the pool table and escalators. I should have looked on the yelp reviews but I didn't so I just asked a hotel worker. 

The ENVIRONMENT was exactly what I expected, SMALL with no tables to sit. They have a counter and that's about it. They do have an arcade machine which kept my son entertained while we waited. This place gets really busy so you will have to take your food to go (Don't know where though) or eat standing up. 

The SERVICE was not a good experience.  We were the only ones there at the time we walked in and we had no greeting whatsoever. Then, it took about a couple minutes for someone to even take our order. Next came the over promising. Since I ordered an entire pie, I was told that there was a pie in the oven and it would be about 10 minutes. That pie that was in the oven...you know the one the guy said was for us...well, it did not go to us. Nor did the second pie. On the third pie, we had to go back to the counter and remind them we were still waiting.  Only then did finally we get it. No apology. That is my pet peeve.   

The QUALITY of the PIZZA was such a disappointment.  Since there were 5 of us, we just ordered the entire pie because it was a better value. Each slice is about 5 dollars and the entire pie is about 27 dollars depending on which one you get.  Our choice was pepperoni.  I understand that sometimes people can order the wrong item but, in this case, I doubt it would have made any difference.  First, their pizza is thin crust which is fine. I like thin crust pizza but the crust is very soft and limp which made it hard to eat. Kinda like a new yorker but worse..almost uncooked.  It just kept flapping all over the place and going limp just prior to getting in my mouth. Second, it was very very oily. I'm talking about Pizza Hut type sprayed on oil dipped in more oil. I had pizza juice running all over my hands and mouth.  Some of you might like that, which is totally cool but not for me. 

I am going to give it two stars though because I don't think I can ever give any pizza joint 1 star. Plus, the employees did speak in a friendly manner. Even though they did not serve us well.

Ever since discovering the magical corridor, I make Secret Pizza a Vegas trip must! 

I don't know what the addicting part of this place is, but I love it! Is it the pizza? Is it the 'secret'? It's probably both.. heh

Anywho, me and my friends usually split the same thing every single time: A white pie with sausage. Why change something you know and love? We've also tried other pizzas but this one has remained true and steady to our hearts.

A pie can cost you around $25-30 depending on what you get and if you add anything. Your choice, your money. Of course, they also sell by the slice premade but we also order a fresh one and just wait, sometimes 20-30 minutes for our pie.

There's a water cooler for drinks as well as beverages for purchase. The interior is a vintage arcade meets pizza parlor and there are several pinball and video game machines for those waiting. 

Seating can be a bit meh, but we always just eat outside near the pool tables or on the long tables along the side by the restrooms.

It's not on the directory of the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. 
There's no sign at the entrance.
Good luck finding It!

We walked around and around... We ended up asking an employee, then found It!  We were starving, so the pizza tasted so good!

The crust was crunchy, thin, and tasty!  I had a slice of meatball (sliced) with ricotta cheese ($6.25), and a slice of Combo pizza ($6.50). Yum!  It was filling!  The combo had more flavor than the meatball/ricotta cheese pizza and the crust didn't sag.  I'd get the combo again and maybe a slice of mushroom pizza...that was my next choice.

Just be aware that the Cosmopolitan Hotel charges for parking. After pizza, we walked around the Strip and ended up paying $7 total for a couple of hours.  Secret Pizza doesn't validate.

The concept of Secret Pizza is cute. You have to ""find"" your way to it, since there isn't a sign and it's not on Cosmopolitan's hotel directory map. It took us less than 5 minutes to find, though, so it's not some big secret. Simply go up to the third floor, find Blue Ribbon, and walk down the hallway located to the left of the restaurant. The hallway is covered in album covers. 

The eatery itself is tiny. Most patrons don't bother to throw away their own plates, so the two short counters are cluttered with condiment remnants and crumbs. You order at the register and wait for your food to come out. Since it's usually made to order, it can take a while. If there's an already-made pie available, you can just purchase slices. 

Prices are considerably high, especially considering the quality. Pizza slices are saturated in so much grease, you'd have to be crazy not to blot your plate with multiple napkins. Each slice literally comes with a pool of grease on the pizza and on the paper plate. We got two slices of cheese mushroom pizza for $11 -- so overpriced. A whole pie is about $30. 

But Secret Pizza does its job -- feeding hungry bar- and club-goers who want a quick bite after downing too much alcohol. All that grease suddenly comes in handy when you need something to fill your belly besides alcohol. 

Would I eat here on a regular night as an actual meal? No chance. But would I eat here at 2am when I just need something quick and easy? I did, and it was quite tasty.",Gx6jqH80H9-WpYjUdyj0RA,4,2,4,h1MQv32xLkw7ryraoxmWdw

My last time here was Spring Break 2012. We found this place by accident. It's not clearly marked. As a matter of fact, it's just a nondescript hallway with a pinball machine at the other end. We noticed a few people walk in and out. Sometimes with a slice of pizza or without but smile on their face. 
We were like, ""What the hell?"" Curiosity got the better of us and we ventured down that dim hallway which is covered with vinyl album covers.
Lo and behold, it's a pizza place!! White tiled walls. Marble counters to stand or sit on the very few stools. 
Order by the slice ($5 and up) or a whole pie ($30+). Pabst Blue Ribbon beer is $5 a red Solo cup. IPA is $7. Only buy the soda if you are super thirsty: $4 a Solo cup. That's as bad as Disneyland, if not worse. Maybe that's a standard Strip price. 

This time, I got a White Pizza slice and hubby and I split a Cheese pie. 
OMG the white pizza is sooooooooooo gooooooood! Yummy mozzarella and ricotta cheese on sauceless crust.

The fanciest pizza I've ever tasted was anything of the ordinary from the countless pizza parlours of Italy. To me, margherita pizzas were a real treat, gently wrapped in parchment paper at 2 a slice, and an additional 1,50 for sea salted chips. 

However, there is something different about Secret Pizza. You can find this little gem on the third floor between the corners at the Cosmopolitan. Purchased by the slice or by whole, the open face kitchen allows you to choose your slice of heaven from white pizzas to red pizzas. When I first tasted Secret Pizza my friends purchased whole pies of everything pizza and a pepperoni pizza, and even at 2am, they were outstanding & melty, just the way I like my cheesy pies. On my last trip here I tried the white ricotta + sausage pizza which is now my only preference. Full of flavour with just the right strength of spice & herbs, this pizza was a winner on my taste buds. 

Keep in mind that the line to Secret Pizza is absurd; I think the best option is to telephone in your whole pie only. Although I am not a pizza aficionado like I used to be when I was under 10 years old, I love Secret Pizza so much that I would purchase a whole pie for myself, even if my companion didn't like Pizza Secret! x",o6vl8qOKbNBJZ_rL1G8n5g,9,9,5,RK_eQgag7-M9zKfi-AbLWQ

Keeping in mind, I've been to New York City quite a few times and have had authentic slices; so my expectations were quite high for this place. Although it's supposedly ""Secret"", felt like everyone knew about ""secret pizza"". It was quite a good 20-30min wait around 10pm for just couple slices. Once at the front counter, you'll see pizza already pre-made for you to choose from and then the pizza makers will throw it back in the oven to reheat. However, 10secs isn't long enough to reheat pizza. My slices  (meat lovers slice & mushroom slice)came out ""luke-warm"" and crust was hard as cardboard. My fiancee' was lucky and was able to try a slice of the white pizza that had just come out of the oven(which was quite delicious. One of the best white style pizzas i've tried). 
3 slices came out just under $20. 

Cons:
-long line
-long wait
-drunk people in line
-expensive slices
-no place inside to dine-in

Pros:
-only worth trying if it's fresh out of the oven

Overall:
First experience was meh. You are better off getting a slice somewhere else. And if you are eager to try this place make sure you order a whole pie because it is not worth having reheated [($5per slice) save it for the craps table] for mediocre quality(unless you're drunk).",6FeNk0cAlU9ZmupT7wQ4Jw,4,2,2,F7KBcOKrpOp8kQcNDbiY-Q

True New York style pizza-dare I say maybe even better than the slices I had recently in the Big City.

It was the perfect combination of everything that makes pizza great.

They typically have the cheese, pepperoni and white pizza (with different types of white cheese). I'd recommend the white pizza and have them sprinkle some of that mushroom on there! Freaking delicious and worth every penny. Walking in here took me back to NY. You order at the counter and wait for them to reheat it and then enjoy. Make no mistake, the pizza is reheated in their massive pizza oven. Not just some sad microwave. 

There are no tables in this joint. If you intend to eat there then you'll be eating at the counter that's outlined the entire place. They have a couple vintage arcade games in there to keep you entertained. You can watch whatever sports they have on TV.

Bf and I circled the 2nd floor a few times before I went back on Yelp to figure it out where it was.

The line was pretty long, but good company always makes it bearable.

White pizza is definitely where it's at. Getting a whole pizza with a larger group is definitely better. 

There isn't much room inside to sit and eat comfortably, but the seating area right outside the hall isn't too bad.

This place is tucked away on the third floor across from Marquee - look for a long hallway with vintage record covers.

I got a piece of the white pizza ($5) - obviously, no tomato sauce, and lots of cheese (almost too much cheese). There was a ton of mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and a garlic oil. There was a bit of a pool of garlicky oil on the top of my pizza, and I had to pick around some of the mozzarella cheese. I loved the NY crust - it was not soggy and was both crisp and chewy. If you're at the club and have found ""someone special"", you may want to avoid this white pizza since you'll have garlic breath for the rest of the night.

Not too shabby, Abby!  Ended up going here after the Yelp event at Chino Poblano a few weeks ago.  Even though Jose Andres and his crew did fill me up with the great goodies and libations, the lady and I were curious about how good this 'hidden' pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan was.  After gambling off the buzz we had (boy does losing money sober you up quick), we were off to the 3rd floor.  Folks were right on the money, you'll see the hidden hallway going to the pizzeria right near the pool table.  One massive line later (damn was it busy with people dressed in sequins for some reason) we were finally at the front.  

I had no clue what to order since most of the slices looked pretty good.  I went with what a lot of yelpers said was tasty, the cheese slice with ricotta.  Must be pretty good because when I went to order it, the cook took out a hidden pie from below from what was already out on the counter!  Kinda like a secret menu item, eh?  Back it went into the oven for a quick reheat.  I'm not big on the reheating of a pie but I guess there ain't much choice here because the line seems constantly busy.  The price?  $11 for 2 slices, kinda ehhhh for me on that front (I guess I'm a cheapie.  Sue me.)  because at a place like Broadway Pizzeria you can get an entire large pie for nearly the same price.  And yes, the pizza at Broadway is a good NY style thin crust!

The 2 slices of cheese and ricotta we had at The Cosmopolitan?  Luckily, they were pretty good!  Good flavor and a crunchy crust pleased me pretty well.  I liked my slice even better with red pepper, oregano, and garlic on top.  However the slices seemed a bit smaller than what I've recently seen on the reviews here.  Economic crunch perhaps?  Price and portion made me had to knock off a few points here.  It really left me wanting a bigger slice.  Although considering this is the Strip it's not too expensive for a meal.  The pizza pie is good, but I think it's cheaper if you and a few folks go in and just order an entire pie around the $20 range with toppings.  Save some dough, and then eat it!

Service was fast and friendly, but pay attention to the prices!  Good thing for Yelp, I avoided the overpriced drink in a small red cup!  Seriously, almost $4 for a soda in a regular red party cup with no lid?  I'd rather buy an extra slice of pizza and live with the minor halitosis from the extra shake of garlic I'd be putting on!  Ha Ha, does the pizzeria know folks get a Heineken from the casino downstairs for just $1 tip?  Ooooh, good idea!  I think I'll do that next time!

Food Quality: 5 Stars
-  Great pizza! Get the Meatball, Pepperoni, or their most popular slice, ""The White"".  

Meatball - Large slices of Meatball and globs of ricotta cheese.

Pepperoni - Large slices of real pepperoni, makes pizza chains seem like they are using intimidation pepperoni?   

""The White"" - its all cheese, fresh ricotta, and garlic sauce. There is no pizza sauce on that one but trust me, its good! My wife loves Chicago Deep Dish Pizza and dislikes NY style, but this was the best pizza she ever had. 

Pricing: 5 Stars
- $5 a slice, if you're hungry, get 2 slices as they are large, but thin (NY style). It costs more than other pizza joints but factor in that it's located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. 

Service: 3 Stars
- Nothing incredible but it is just a pizza counter and they are just mashing out pizzas. The workers were friendly and helped me choose some good slices. There is a little bit of a wait but its worth it!

Atmosphere: 5 Stars
- Has a real NY pizza place feel. A couple pinball machines and some TV's playing sports. Hallway is decorated with vintage vinyl records and adds some class but once its opens up to the pizza counter, its straight NY style! 

Place is really a secret, I had to ask 3 different hotel employees to find it. Its a hallway that is missed in a blink. Its to the left of glass elevator and across from the ""game lounge"" (pool table, scrabble coffee tables, wooden dice seats). 

Comfort: 3 Stars
- It's a narrow hallway any little counter space to eat, but you will be there just to buy and run so no worries there. 

Location: 3 Stars trying to find it but as far as theme goes (being a secret, 5 Stars)

- The Fat: 

My in-laws were in town and of course we needed to take them out to the Vegas Strip. There was 25 of us so no need for a sit down dinner, especially with many small children. I found ""Secret Pizza"" on Yelp and opt'ed to go there as we made our way to the Bellagio fountain show. 

It was tricky to find, had to use my GPS and ask 3 hotel employees to get there but it really is a hidden treat. You will have to wait a little bit, I was there on a Sat night around 11pm and we waited about 20-30 mins?

The pizza is delicious! hot, fresh, and kills any other pizza I had, only rivaled by Grimaldi's Pizza in NY under the Brooklyn bridge. I would go out of my way to go here again.

Anyways, it wasn't very hard to find since my group and I knew where to look and what to look out for. Thanks, Yelp.

When we got there, there were only 4-5 people waiting for their pizza to be made. My sister and I ordered the 18in white pizza. It only took like 10-15 for them to make it. And I'm gonna assume that my experience ordering a whole pizza fresh was better than choosing a slice out of the pies that were already made in the window. 
 
We took the pie back to our hotel and oh my goodness! I could taste it now just thinking back to it. I have never had a white pizza before, and I am never going back. It was hot, fresh, and HUGE for like $20. It was so soft (but not fall apart soft) and so cheesy. The ricota was a nice touch.

They serve pizza by the slice or whole pizzas.  My friends and I decided to get a whole pizza with 5 toppings.  We got pepperoni, meat ball, sausage, ricotta cheese, and banana peppers on the side.  Cost was $29.  We took it outside and devoured it shortly.  Sitting next to the pool table on the couch.  We added crushed red peppers, parmesan cheese, and garlic salt.  It was so tasty and good.  Yes it's thin crust, and after pulling the slice apart, the cheese stretches and the toppings at the tip falls off.  Greasy but tasty, if grease is a problem you can use a napkin to dab at it.

I rounded up some troopers to on embark on a journey with me to pop my Cosmopolitan cherry one late night, but really i just wanted to get my pizza on since i was having mad fat man-i-tis cravings.  After searching throughout the casino we finally made it to the our destination and the people here are very inviting. *Hint* Look for a pinball machine at the of a hallway.  

The register lady claimed that their White Pizza is their 'bread and butter': Ricotta, mozzarella cheese, parmesan, garlic, basil, oregano, and NO sauce.  You have the option to top it off with slice tomatoes an alternative for a sauce which is highly recommended by Nico, our pizza guy.  The tomatoes helps brings out the flavor of the White Pizza more and are place on after the pizza is removed from the oven.  This is a little different from the norm, so I didn't want to fully commit. 

Nico overheard our dilemma and normally he wouldn't do this for anyone, but for us he was more than happy to modify our pizza. . Half White, half Pepperoni and Sausage.  Score! 

My first slice i was in loved, but after my second i thought it was too much of the same dry cheese ricotta taste.  It was good, but i wouldn't be too quick to go back for 3rds.

The sausage and pepperoni pizza were freakin' good.   The slice sausage and pepperoni has a greater caliber than your typical pizza joint.  The oil from the cheese and pepperoni goes so well with that lightly burnt crust, and the sausage had a nice bite to it.  I saved one of these for my last slice ;P

You can ordered by the slice which they will reheat one of the premade one or you can be fatties like us an order a whole pie.  Takes about 15min.  Fun little inexpensive adventure if you're looking for something to do late night.  Not much seating inside, but outside the hallways there are plenty.

4107437,2011-09-05,1,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"To me this place is the best hidden pizza joint on the strip. What do I mean about that?

First off, my friend and I walked all of the first floor and second floors and back in the first floor but no sign of this place. We even saw some dude that ran inside the casino with a box of pizza, we wanted to ask but the guy was to fast through the exit doors, we just missed em'  I had to ask a Cosmo casino security directions to this place. This is what to remember take the elevator to the third floor, make a right from the elevator, there you will see a small hall way full of photos, finally the hidden gem. 

You have choices of a full pie or slices: $5 slices? Expensive but your in the Cosmo but hey they back it up with some bomb-ass pizzas. What I saw is that they have some pizzas ready in the kitchen, the choices: white, plain cheese, pepperoni, meat lovers, and supreme you choose a slice then they reheat it for you or you can order by request and customize it made fresh, which there is a pizza guy who makes pies in front of you, and to top it off they offer free re-fills on soda purchases.

The first visit my choice was the meat lovers, not as dry, but the flavor still holds up. Same thing goes on my second visit still flavorful and all I had was a white cheesed pizza. Their pizza dough ain't old, and stale that leaves it bland like other joints but it's so opposite of that. It's NY style pizzas here that makes you wanting more.

This is the first place that I've used garlic powder for pizzas which is provided on the counter along with crushed peppers and Parmesan. 
I've learned that the garlic powder adds taste and seasoning to an already awesome pie, it compliments it and thanks to this place Ive learned something new.

This joint is small, only two chairs inside , you might want to hangout where there is a pool table outside  if its not crowded theres a few sofas to get comfy. I found that if your coming from the second floor just take the escalator to the third floor go straight left were you see a small hallway of portraits. Very hidden I must say, no signs here, but worth finding.

If your just coming out of a club and your wanting to wash away the drunkeness, I recommend this place this pizzeria will be that anti-hangover.",FaPrtK-SB9sygQuxndPm3Q,1,1,4,z9YqnIGA8Q-uUP31J8CYeg

They close at 5am so it's perfect for those hungry night owls, or owls in a drunken stupor.
It's a bit hard to find in the afternoon when there isn't a line of drunk clubbers leading you to the hole in the wall. It's also cleaner in the afternoon when there aren't any drunk clubbers throwing napkins everywhere like a bunch of animals.
The lines during the night however is savage. It makes people angrily stomp away, drunkenly slurring ""I'm not waiting 2 hours for f***ing pizza!""  Then you breathe a sigh of relief as the wait time weeds out the weak and the long line gets shorter. But it does get hard with people walking past you with the delicious smell of pizza pies being waved in your face. Then your stomach starts to eat itself from the lack of pizza in it.

The employees are quick and the ovens can only work so fast, it's the people who order that are slow and absolutely inconsiderate (did they forget the rest of the people behind them??).

The pizza is usually thin crust, which is good, nice and crunchy. They also have a deep dish one too. The sausages are pretty salty, especially the sausage with peppercinis, which is good for the drunken animals that roam Las Vegas when the clubs are closing. But my favorite is the regular cheese pizza or the white cheese pizza. Soooo frickin good. Get yourself a slice! They're pretty big slices too.

Having a drunkard unattractive man in a suit telling me and my friends while waiting in line that the pizza isn't good and he found a hair in his pizza and to eat the pizza at our own risk was pretty lame especially since him and his buisness partners left hellah trash everyhwere with not even a single crumb of the so called nasty pizza anywhere.

I burned my mouth on that first bite.  Bummer.  Then came my slice of white pizza.  White sauce and a mixture of cheeses make this a very rich slice of pie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it while eating it but it did leave an off putting after taste in my mouth.  I can't quite place it.  It was almost floral.  Maybe it was the basil or something in the ricotta cheese.  I don't really know.  At least it was good while I ate it.  I also ordered a cup of Coke.  The grand total for this cheese feast was $14.  Seriously!?  For two slices of pizza and a Coke?  It seems high to me. That being said, given its location in one of the most high end places on the Las Vegas Strip, I should expect nothing less.  The pizza is good.  Not $5 per slice good but they have you right where they want you and you are at their mercy.  Or lack there of.  And for that I give them props for a sucessful business plan.

It's over priced and overrated. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't taste bad, but it wasn't out of this world fantastic like people make it seem.

Way too late and way too lazy for nightclubs so this seemed like the best decision. Couple friends from Norcal haven't had the chance to try it and assured them we were definitely gettin' it in!!! 

Was late into the wee hours of the night but man the line was damn knarly! First time I went it was in the afternoon and there was definitely nothing like it was at that moment. Line was wayyyy out the hallway (which where the name Secret Pizza name empasizes) into the hotel walkway. Even with such a long line, wait didn't seem so terribly long... That always seems to be the case though when you're surrounded by good company and drunk people! 

There were six of us and at $5.25 per slice, we opted for buying a whole pie instead ($28). It was and extra 20-30 minute wait but price wise would say it's definitely worth it. We went with the White pie and you can't go wrong with a crowd favorite! Came out piping hot! But I'm sure it always does since it's always does since it's always so busy... Something about an entire pie dedicated to you that makes it taste THAT much better.

That white sauce instead of a traditional red sauce was amazinggg. That light and airy ricotta cheese crumbling all in my maofz... So good. Slices were very large and we were still left with 2 extra slices which I had very little hesitation taking since the girls didn't want to eat much since day club the next day!

We ended up coming back the next day and was just as good even though we were no where near as sober! Highlight goes too the awesome soundtrack going on that night! Singing Phil Collins rendition of "" You Can't Hurry Love"" with a hallway of strangers was the best feeling everrrrrrr!

I love NYC pizza with a deep, lustful passion.  It plagues my dreams, calls out to me through windows with its seductive aroma, and makes me yearn for the next cheesy slice.  Secret Pizza is a place in Las Vegas that serves it.  My friend Grace C. went last year when Cella R. told her about it.  Ever since then, I've been plotting my return to Vegas and partaking in this secretive pizza joint.  

My fellow elite Yelpers and I made our way over to the Cosmopolitan after a YEE at the Cathouse and ordered 2 pizzas ($50 total): one white pizza and one half pepporoni/ half sausage & mushroom.  It came out to about $5 per person.  Secret Pizza is located up on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan food court next to the sushi restaurant down an unmarked hallway.  There are white tiles and picture frames welcoming you into this unremarkable looking pizza place.  We ordered our pizzas around midnight and got them about 30 minutes after.  It seemed like forever to a slightly inebriated and starving person such as myself.  I was hungry and watching others get their slices before I did, was excruciatingly painful.  Drew M. started to play Donkey Kong while waiting.  Watching his arcade game progression only made me hungrier.  

Where was this pizza anyway?!  Why didn't I just order a damn slice?!  Oh wait, there it is.  We brought it outside to the sofas & coffee table.  We dug in.  Silence.  Everyone is chewing and gulping their pizza in a very methodical fashion.  Delicious garlicky white pizza with greasy pepperoni pizza.  I was in heaven.  Was it the best pizza I've ever had?  No, nothing compares to real NYC pizza in NYC, but it comes close.  Too bad the crust wasn't as crispy as I would have liked but the flavor of the white pizza still makes me drool as I write this.  Pizza is the perfect food in the wee hours of the morning when all you want is carbs.

I loved the white pizza with the ricotta cheese.....yum! Flavorful, but it was a bit cold. The meatlovers pizza was hot and pretty dang tasty too! No pictures were taken as I was starved to the bone. Crust was made the way I like it and everything about it was delicious.

The dreadful experience seemed at one point like a practical joke, not only on myself, but on countless inebriated individuals in line here. How silly is it to have to wait in line 30 min or an hour to get a pizza while intoxicated? This test or as I'd call it, a vegas human experiment, focuses on dedication, foolishness and trust of social media.

Perhaps, waiting in line of completely wasted people at 4 in the morning has a certain charm for some people, like people watching or making a last minute effort to hook up after fruitless efforts to do so at a night club. Those dedicated souls who choose to do the latter here are probably going to get the most satisfaction out of this restaurant experience as they'll either exhaust their last resort to go to bed satisfied or, actually get satisfied in bed. In either case, good for them. 

Now, what if one was foolish enough to come here for the food despite endless nighttime food options in Vegas. That's where this experience can turn sour quite quickly. I got the white pizza and a pepperoni pizza with Greek peppers. If it was not for the huge wait, i'd give this pizza its fair 3 stars that it deserves. Was not a fan of the crust, but the pizza was decent. It was nothing really bad, but nothing great either, I've had frozen pizzas of similar caliber before. The pizza style is classic American thin crust. However, after waiting in line this long, expectations were a bit high and I can't say I'd ever put myself through such an experience ever again for a very average pizza.

Enjoying it on the couches outside the joint also has some fun to it, you get to converse with fellow clubbers and subjects of this silly experiment. Nobody seemed to like the pizza and frustration with Yelp reviews of this place was rampant. ""How?"" Kept coming up as an inquiry, followed by ""Why?"" People were just lost.

Let me tell you hipsters something: it's not a SECRET anymore if you have to wait in line for 30 minutes behind every fake-glasses-wearing jackass in Vegas and his whorey, vodka-drenched, barefoot sister to get in. It's pretty f*ckin' mainstream by that point!
 
Still, there is a true GEM to be found here. But it's not the pizza -- it's the WINE! They'll pour you a huge plastic cup of some improbably genteel boxed wine for $6. It's enough to last you all night!

The pizza is actually pretty good, too (and I detest pizza): big slices for around $5 each, with lots of nommy toppings. But whatever! No one wants to sit around eating pizza all night.

My advice is to get a big old plastic cup o'boxed red and then head down to one of the other, more pretentious ""mixology"" bars in the Cosmo...where you can get soused in style, smug with the secret knowledge that you're getting totally f*cked up for less than the cost of one of those lame blocks of ""art"" they sell in the ripoff trending machines -- I mean VENDING machines.

Let the mixologists whip up complicated overpriced ""libations"" for the bebe-clad idiot masses...boxed wine is good enough for anyone who's REALLY cool.

So, $30 for a pizza sounds high, right?  But when that pizza is bigger than the wheel of a monster truck and you're on the notoriously expensive and overpriced Las Vegas Strip, this is a screaming deal.  One pizza kept two of us fed (off and on) for easily three days and probably saved us from at least two or three $50+ meals.  

The key to making it worthwhile is to time the line so there isn't much of a wait.  We skipped this place a few times when the lunch lines were massive, and although we tried once to call ahead and place an order, they never picked up the phone.  But on a weekday at 2pm - no problemo!  We ordered, took a quick wander, came back 20 minutes later and they practically greeted us at the door with our pizza and a big smile.  This place beats the pants off the late night pizza joint in NYNY, and if you've got a fridge or a big group, a full pizza pie is a great option.

You can grab a slice or a whole pizza. They have some ready to go ranging from pepperoni, cheese, combo, and white slice.

My go-to slice is simple: white slice with roasted tomatoes. The ricotta and white sauce combined with the tangy tomatoes is out of this world.

30 bucks for a dinner for 4? I dare you to find that anywhere else on the strip. 

What's more is we enjoyed playing ms. Pacman and their pinball machines while we waited! The lack of seating is a bummer, but we got the only 4 chairs in the place so we were fine.

I'm not kidding; these guys could throw down with any pizza joint in NYC, so dropping them in Las Vegas is like winning a gold in the Special Olympics & not being handicapped - there's no contest. 
(Why is this in The Cosmopolitan & not New York, New York? Seems like a missed branding opportunity but I digress.) 

This place is the best pizza in Las Vegas, period. 
It's a tiny hole, with an old school Galaga game, a wall mounted tv, and just a few stools & counters, so you're standing up or you're taking it to go. 

Buy it by the slice (around $8 each) or plan on waiting if you need a whole pie ordered because they make it from scratch when you do. 
(Yes, if you're wondering, it is absolutely worth the wait.) 
Sicilian style or traditional thin crust, they usually have four pies out on display at a time but they turn over new pies in minutes (they're steady busy so slices sell quickly) - there's always fresh pie in the oven about to come out if you don't like your initial available choices. 

A ""must stop"" for me every time I'm in Vegas. Relatively inexpensive (not cheap; they have to run a profitable business 18 hours a day, 7 days a week so it's about $8 a slice) but certainly reasonable compared to most of the purchases you make on The Strip ($5.99 for a bottle of water, anyone?)",ZyDboD_a5Bd8koNr_5ruWw,1,0,5,IHHqav8Q50LSwMAIwpGVLQ

1. If you are looking for something cheap, easy to eat, and convenient at odd/normal hours, this is the place for you. After a night of gambling and walking the strip all I wanted was some comfort food and I knew exactly which alley way to turn into. 

2. They limit your selection -- meaning it isn't a vegas buffet in which you way 30+ bucks and have billions of things to choose from. It's more like you have 10 bucks and you should just choose 2 huge new york slices that will satisfy your tummy for a while...unless you can handle more but that's all you!

3. They have a unique white sauce pizza that has a dollops of ricotta cheese and tastes like high caloric heaven, but is worth every bite. 

4. The beauty is in the simplicity. A simple menu, simple products, simple food, simple happiness. There isn't an easier key to great food. Yes there might be a long line of drunkies at 2am, but that's why you plan ahead ;) Seating is an issue because the place is literally a narrow alley, but the great thing about pizza is that it's a walk and eat kind of item. 

5. If you think that the slice is missing something you can add individual toppings for a cost and they will do it begrudgingly, for a SINGLE slice! Something I think that other pizza places can definitely learn from.

I decided to opt for a slice of their white pie. So cheesy and garlicky! It had a ton of cheese including ricotta. And each bite had a nice hint of garlic. Their pizza is definitely on the same level as something you'd find in New York.

Prices are a bit on the higher side, but honestly, it's worth it. They also offer to bake off a whole pie for you if you're willing to wait 10-15 minutes.

I think you get more options for toppings if you order a whole pizza.  The pizza here is a little on the pricier side at around $5 a slice.  They serve New York style pizza here, very thin, super airy, crispy crust, with just the perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings.

4396396,2018-05-16,1,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"It's a hidden gem inside The Cosmo! 

No one is quite sure if the Cosmopolitan's Secret Pizza joint was planned, or one of the mega-resort's designers had a coke-binge one weekend & added a secret corridor with no signs for one of the best pizzas in Las Vegas. Located between a glass elevator and the sushi joint, you can see guys who probably were just shipped in from Brooklyn, throw pizza in the air like a pro. The pizza just isn't fun to watch being made, but it is amazingly tasty, crispy and perfect to hold slightly bent and folded like a boy from Brooklyn.  

Secret Pizza is a New York-style pizza place with a casual feel. There's no signage in the front and it's not easy to spot if you were walking by. Hidden on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, you won't know this little eatery is there unless you follow the record-lined hallway. After passing album covers from Frank Sinatra, Elvis and other music notables on the wall, you're spilled into a tiny, standing room only place. 

At the walk-up counter, fresh pizza like pepperoni, cheese and veggie is offered by the slice. If you want a whole pizza to take to your room, it usually takes about 15 minutes. But don't worry, the brightly-colored pinball machine is always a fun way to pass the time if you're waiting.
There is a high-top counter to stand at while eating a slice and a few mismatched stools. In addition to soft drinks, a few select beers are available. For seasonings, Secret Pizza keeps it simple: Parmesan cheese, cherry pepper and oregano in old-fashioned spice shakers.

Even though I've always heard about this New York-style pizza joint that specializes in a ""secret slice"" of mouth-watering, delectable, and often satisfying pies of cheesy & sauce-y goodness - I finally got a chance to visit & try their so-called ""secret pizza"". Glad I did! It was aiight, but I definitely had better - although, during that situation, it was a heavenly slice! Haha. On the other hand, this unnamed, discreet establishment - hidden down an unmarked corridor, just seems to fly under the radar of the Cosmos's many award-winning restaurants & dining options.
The cheap & delicious slices are gaining a strong following, most especially during the wee hours of the night into early dawn! They're pretty much open throughout the day - opening at 11 a.m., until to about 4 - 5 a.m. in the morning!

Pro-tip: If the line gets too long in the standing-room-only space, you can always pass the time by trying to beat the high score on the old-school Galaga machine tucked in a cramped corner.

Who you will meet: Drunk tourists who thought hallway led to bathroom and hot clubbers pigging on pizza.

Highly recommended! This pizza is even amazing if you get out of the club YOU KNOW WHAT! (i.e. tipsy, drunk, the feeling that you just threw up & need some recovery food, LOL) - don't say I didn't tell you!",NB7rfbs2A_GwSQZKeE96Iw,3,3,5,JUtlE7PhIjIpQ4L3wuMNGw

The pizza is not cheap.  It probably averages $4.50 a slice and the average person will probably eat 2 slices.  Its made fresh to order and its delicious.  I've never had this sober but I'd guess I'd probably go elsewhere to avoid the line and the premium mark up for pizza.

I got 2 pizzas, with 3 toppings each and the total came to $64.  $32 a pizza would definitely be considered a premium.  It was a good amount for my group of 7 as we barely finished everything.  Its more along the new york style, think crust pizza.

Literally, located in a hole in the middle of nowhere (well, next to the pool tables in the Cosmo), there is no sign, no nothing, but a long long hallway that seems to be perhaps a janitor closet or something. Walk in, it's officially a hidden pizza shoppe, like BAM!!!!!!! Simple, straight forward, and loaded with oils/fats. This is definitely THEE perfect place to go to after drinking and partying your ass off at a club to sober up.

However, for my friends and I, this place was a tad too greasy (sorry, had to minus a star for that! XP) for our sober middle of the day breakfast/lunch/brunch. Yet I can see the appeal of such greasy goodness in the middle of the night, when you stumble drunk like no other out a club, and crave some hot, fresh out the oven pizza.

Really great New York style pizza for Las Vegas strip prices, so don't be surprised at the cost of each slice! The slices start at $5 for a plain pizza and go up from there. You get a fairly decent sized slice, though usually 2 does the job for me.

This place is the best to quickly grab a bite before a concert/show or maybe if you want to just fill your stomach up before/after a wild night of drinking. Just expect quick, efficient, and friendly service! If you need to be in and out, Secret Pizza is the place. The pizzas are all really fresh and they have a variety - some with veggies, some with pineapple and ham, some with nothing but cheese.

If that slice of pepperoni pizza could actually fuck, then I'd pay $5 for it.  Not even all the concessions stands at carnivals would charge that much for a slice of pizza, and even then those slices were very good and worth it.

My buddy told me he paid around $3 or less for his slices when he went there, and I was sure that was the price 8 months ago.  Either way I asked for a pepperoni slice and the server looked pretty out of it/didn't give a shit.  I know they just give you a slice and there isn't much customer service involved, but throw a fricken smile and be glad that i am paying you 10X the amount of what that pizza slice cost.  I'd be jumping for joy if I had that gig.

The pizza itself; Very good.  Digged the crust and the sauce, great texture, no complaints about the quality.  However, it's not $5/slice good, but very good nonetheless.  But it wasn't very filling either.  

I dunno, I felt like the charm it once had that made me want to try it out for the longest time is gone.  This is not a ""little gem"", ""neat place"" or ""hidden secret"", or not anymore.  It's just ""hidden"".

Really, there is no secret cause it's pretty obvious where all the after party goers straight out of Marquee go when they are done clubbing.  And for those that don't know or are a bit reluctant at getting in line, just trust yourself and follow the smell of oven... baked... pizza.

Yeah, I didn't think you'd resist, and neither could I.

I LOVED Secret Pizza... if only for an after clubbing meal cause my ass surely was already dehydrated, and the idea of tomato pasta sauce to ""quench my thirst"" was more than enough.

The pizza was delicious, even though I'm sure the alcohol made it taste better.  The crust was doughy and delicious, and a very generous sized slice for your stomach.  The Pepperoni Sausage was a personal favorite!  Gotta go for the meats to curb the appetite.

The only thing I was sad about was that if you wanted to order a whole pizza for yourself, it could only be one kind (as in you can't have half of it be veggies, and the other half be pepperoni salami meat lovers delight).  But fair enough- it helps keep the crowd moving.

By all means, spread this little secret.  It'll make your Vegas clubbing night just that much better.  (Following this you should be going back to your hotel and partying some more)",mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,0,0,4,NOFyNyh-dQ3DkhlJIlKpvw

Ever since my first experience, I cannot call it a night out in Vegas until I've had my Secret Pizza Fix.  I can hit up a club on the other freaking side of the strip and still take a taxi to the Cosmo to get a slice. It is safe to say I am HOOKED and hands-down my favorite pizza place in Vegas, or even LA for that matter. (suggestions for great neapolitan pizzas in the greater LA area are welcome!!!!)

FYI.. the other pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, etc.) are fine.. its just you will wish you had like.. 3 slices of the white pizza IMHO. 
The Salad is pretty good too so.. if there are any vegetarians/someone on a diet in the group.. well there you go.
and OMFG WTF I cannot believe I forgot about the peppers. They have the best pickled peppers so you must ask them for some.. a little bit sweet, a little bit spicy, omy~ YUMMMMMMM

However, if you're like me and also one of these club go-ers, then it's just a hot spot for a late night snack before heading back to the room. :)

Pizza can be sold by the slice or as a whole. By slice is about $4 and is comparable to the size of Costco's pizza. They have a higher end quality in toppings than Pizza Hut and Domino's. The lines may be long but usually it moves fast, unless of course you got someone in front of you whose so drunk she can't tell she's at a pizza place.

Located on the 3rd level.  There isn't a sign, so look past the pool table.  This pizza joint is located down a long hallway lined with album covers.  You might be able to spot the ""Vegas"" pinball machine from outside.

It's a very small place.  Once inside, you will notice:
-A few stools and a small counter to sit at.  
-Pinball machine, and an arcade game.  
-Couple of pizza ovens.
-Pizza counter with pre-made pizzas, and a handful of toppings to choose from.
-Pizza artist and a cashier.
-Great pizza!

It's not a full dining establishment.  Pretty much order and go. You wouldn't expect much more from a place with $3 pizza slices in a multi-billion dollar resort. 

You can have extra toppings added for a small charge.  If you order a slice, it is tossed into the oven for a couple minutes and you are good to go.  Full pizza's start at $17.  Guest's of the hotel can place an order through room service. 

Feeling thirsty?  They have PBR  and Dogfish Ale on tap.  

The people who work here are great.  Real pizza artist's with personality.

Secret?? With a dash of fighting words?? Do count me in!

If your faculty to read has left you (and that does happen sometimes in Las Vegas) just look for the folks who are walking around in the hotel with white, plain pizza boxes and ask them where they got it.

What's really likeable about this joint is that:
a.) it really keeps to its mysterious charm.
There's no sign, just a dark hallway that you would pass and wouldn't even know it was there if you weren't looking for it on purpose.

b.) Its so unexpected.
You'd never think you'd find a place that serves pizza for $4.50 a slice in the trendy and posh Cosmopolitan hotel.  There is nothing fancy about this place - they serve your pizza on paper plates and soda in a red dixie cup!  They also have beer.

c.) The pizza is SO DANG good!
Good in a ""Man I'm so drunk and I hella want a pizza right now"" way as well as when you're sober.  The thin crust is perfectly crispy and you know that its really good pizza when it stays that way even if its been sitting out on the warmers and reheated for you.  The WHITE pizza is has no red sauce but olive oil instead, and has a great combo of parmesan, mozzarella and dollops of ricotta.  Super flavorful and super cheesy.  The Pepperoni and Combo slices we got were just as delicious and with just the right amount of sauce and toppings to hold well with the glorious thin crust.

My friend and I waited in line for about 20 minutes on our visit.  When we reached the front, I was a little surprised at the size of the operation....or rather lack there of.  It's basically all kitchen and just a few seats along a counter and a pinball machine.  No bathrooms.  No nothing.  Just walk up, order, pay, get pizza and that's it.    

In other words, don't expect to come here for a leisurely sit-down meal.  Rather it's more take-away style where as the song goes ""you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here"".  

I removed one star in my rating, as I really like having the option to sit down and relax for a while.  Rather than just getting the boot after ordering and then having to solve a new problem of being hungry with delicious food in hand, but no where to go.  

Luckily, my friend is a rockstar and he found two spots at the counter for us...right next to the pinball game.  Pro Tip: if you unplug the pinball machine, it will no longer play loud annoying music while you're trying to enjoy gourmet pizza.           

Like other reviews have mentioned, the quality of Secret Pizza is fantastic.  I'd love to go back to try more of their creations.

The pizza that's laid out also isn't labeled so for a first timer you'd have to ask what pizza is offered. They also don't offer cups of water, only bottled so bring your own drink.

Combo Pizza - came with pepperoni, sausage, onion. The pizza was a bit too salty for me but I'm sure it would pair well with a drink. The crust was delicious though! Very thin and crispy, though it can get tiring to chew after a bit. Throw some of that garlic powder (or chili flakes/parmesan) that's left on the counters and you're set.

Secret Pizza delivers the quintessential New York style slice: a sparing amount of zesty sauce and cheese without an abundance of toppings. The crust is thin and crispy while the base holds up well for folded consumption rapidly.  You should probably order at least two slices.  I've gone so far as ordering 4 slices at once and even a whole pie.  The variety of slices differs by the day.  If you want something that isn't featured on the display, you'll need to go ahead and order a pie.  Always order it with a beer.

My addiction is out of hand.  I once left Hakkasan early just so I could beat the lines and get my hands on these slices (wait times around 2-3 am are approximately 30-45 minutes). On most trips, I'll go at least once.  Other times, I'll venture here two or three times.  When I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for my birthday, I had it three times in one day.

Like I said, i thought the pizza was decent. Of course I was drunk on night 1 when I devoured a slice of cheese & on night 2 when I had some sort of Greek style pizza (it had gyro meat & feta). They seem to churn out pizzas pretty quickly & there are several varieties to choose from at any given time.

On the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel there is no sign for Secret Pizza, just a hallway lined with Italian-American singer's LP's that lead you to the pizza promise land.

It is the best pizza in Las Vegas and there is no debate about that. Dollar for dollar this is the best meal in town.

The space is small and there are only a few stools to sit at but this pizza was made for standing. They are constantly pulling out fresh pies to serve by the slice, or you can order your favorite toppings and they'll whip it up for you.

I got the sausage and pepperoncini, which was right out of the oven and then had them throw some meatball on an existing pepperoni slice to reheat.

They were both outstanding but the sausage won out because of its freshness and spiciness. I will be getting that combo again.

When you come do what you will, just know that if you want to taste the true genius of this place get whatever is freshest out of the oven.

My girl got the white Sicilian square, and because she loves me so much she allowed me to sample. Pretty fantastic.

It should be obvious by now that Secret Pizza is probably the worst-kept secret in Las Vegas.  Since everyone knows where it is already, I'll just go ahead and spill the beans -- Cosmopolitan hotel, third floor, tucked between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon Sushi, down the short corridor lined with vintage album covers.

Okay, now that I said it, don't kill me, please?  This isn't Fight Club, right?

I wasn't joking when I said everyone knows about Secret Pizza already.  The lines to eat here are obscene.  It's most popular in the middle of the night, when the post-Marquee crowd drops by to feed their drunken munchies.  However, when a group of us dropped by at 2pm in the afternoon, we still had to wait over 30 minutes just to reach the cashier.  

Not that I minded waiting.  I could spend hours looking at the collection of vintage albums.  There's also pinball.  The pizzeria itself is decked out in gleaming white subway tile, in fitting with the New York theme.

We shared a variety of red slices, some plastic cups of PBR, and a slice of cheesecake.  While the pizza was fresh and delicious, it was doused in enough grease to make the paper plate translucent in no time.  (Remember that episode of the Simpsons when Bart rubs his pizza on the wall and then the wall turns clear?  Yeah, like that.)  There is barely any seating inside the pizzeria, so we carried all of the grub to the lounge area outside.

At $5 a slice, it's expensive, but not unreasonably so.  A better deal is ordering a whole pie.  I recommend that if everyone in your group can agree on a single topping.

All in all, Secret Pizza is a solid place to go -- if for no other reason than being able to help all the other confused tourists who are curious to find out where you got your pizza and beer from.  :-)",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,18,14,4,hrcQCf3v12FqMBJENOGQ-w

Nah.  Just read this.  I'll give you precisely what you need to know.

(Not So) Secret Pizza.

After a couple of years, it ain't much of a secret anymore.  And it's cashing in.  What once was only three Georges a slice, is now at least an Abe per.  Still, probably the least expensive, hot-- or at least warmed-- meal in this mega-hotel.

Pizzas are already baked, sliced and, oddly, re-distributed and... arranged miscellaneously back into pizza rounds??  Yup.  Presumably so you can see all the varieties in one glance at one pie.  Just peruse the mish-mash of slice variety and choose what you want.  They then throw it in an oven for a minute-- and only a minute, in my case.

Move to the left, pay the cashier.  Dispense some agua from the cooler, gulp it down, then step back and wait for your order.

Sausage slice was quite good.  The everything with green peppers was nothing special.  There are *maybe* three seats next to the counter where you line up.  Usually taken though.

Or just take your Secret Pizza back out to the pool table area.  You might have a smidge better luck snagging a seat there.  But if not, just stand there and chomp your slices, it's kool.  Guaranteed, someone around that lounge area will hit you up.  Conversation at the very least.

Ah yes.  Nothing like a kid getting his first legal taste of alcohol in a public environment.  Classic.  Just standing around, dazed, taking swigs from a giant malt liquor bottle.

""Hi where you guys from... I live here, yeah in Vegas... never had a f*k*g drink before...

The perfect late night munchies after going to Marquee or just out in Vegas. It's a narrow hallway with a bunch of pictures on the side. No sign or anything but if you see a long line and people coming out with slices, you're in the right area.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 4/5. The only reason I'm putting this is that if it is busy, be prepared to wait a good 45 minutes to an hour for a slice. Especially for boxes. Went on a Monday night at 4AM and only waited about 15 minutes. 

WHY I DOCKED IT: The only thing to ruin the experience was we ordered a box of white pizza and they said it'd be 10-15 minutes. So we walked around and came back in about 10 and waited for our pizza. Our pizza was already DONE and the two cashiers who helped us didn't even bother to tell us they were done. A guy that was cooking the pizzas had to ask why we were just standing there. How are you that lazy to tell us our pizza is done? Unless your memory is that bad, what's your excuse? Worst service so shout out to the two ladies that were there chillin' at the register and not bother to tell us our pizza was done for another 15 minutes.

PRICE:
$5.50 per slice
$28 for a box

WHITE PIZZA: 5/5. White sauce is the best sauce. On anything. Alfredo sauce with a bunch of cheese is what this baby is made of. Love the globs of ricotta and it's thin pizza too! The crust isn't the greatest but still amazing.

OVERALL: 4/5. Go for the food, not the service.

Then go straight down the unmarked hallway right in front of you which is lined with old record sleeves. it opens up into a mostly standing room affair with a few stools along the walls, some pinball machines, and 2 TVs with sports.

Drinks are sold from 2 liter bottles and poured into solo cups at something like $4 per cup. This is crazy expensive. Luckily they have a little water filtration machine that you can get free water from in the corner next to the cash register. This is the way to go.

You can order a custom pizza which takes a while, or they can just heat a slice from the already made pizzas. $4.50 for a cheese slice is the base price. You then add 50 cents for each additional topping. I had the pepperoni and sausage for $5.50, and felt like the price was a little up there for a single slice that wasn't even over-sized. 

Sausage and peperoni was only ok. Sausage was there physically, but lacked any flavor. I'd skip that topping. Pepperoni was tasty and a little salty. Still not a huge winner, but a good standard slice.

The crust was good. Thin and crunchy, resisting sogginess for a while, and is a great starting point for these pizzas. 

The white pizza was by far the best. Ricotta and garlic make this more resistant to sogginess, and the taste combo is delicious. Very subtle ricotta and not so subtle garlic really take this to the next level with the great crust. The white pizza is the one to get.

Yet when you dig deeper and get to know its personality you find something so much more. I am a firm believer that every establishment has room for improvement. However, when I think about it long and hard Secret Pizza really epitomizes all I would want or come to expect of a pizza establishment. I almost dare say that it was the best pizza I have ever had. 

Nestled in the Cosmopolitan, you would think it would be flashy and glitzy. Rather, it defies that convention and it sits in a nondescript hallway that you would easily bypass. Not that I am saying you should go down every service hallway at the Cosmopolitan, I'm just saying taking the Star Trek like elevator to the third floor above the Chandelier Bar and walk down the nondescript hallway till you find Secret Pizza. Note, the hallway has photos on it to give you some direction.

Once there, you will be greeted by the beautiful smell of pizza. While slices are available in the showcase, full pizza's are available as well. I'd probably call ahead if that is the case just to avoid having to wait. Since we didn't know any better, we settled on a simple pepperoni pizza. However as we waited to order, the guy working the counter clearly could tell we wanted a white pizza as well and mentioned that we could have a half pepperoni/half white pizza and it came out to be one of the best decisions we made in Vegas. The pepperoni was really good, but the white pizza was much better. Both offered really great flavors that melded in a perfect harmony that would make angels sing. The pepperoni has just the right amount of salt and spice to counteract the fat and sweetness of the mozzarella. While at the same time the white pizza was an amazingly good blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Both on a thin crust that was easy to work with, yet not being very greasy at all. 

Service was good with the staff clearly not only knowing their menu but also clearly having skill when it comes to making their pies. They keep the line moving at a carefully timed rate as if it were a well-made machine.

Definitely a great place to grab a bite, while they may not have seating grab a glass of wine or beer with the pie and head on out to the main areas. It is definitely one bite you do not want to miss.",Gg3K7jsyWEl6TlGmhodODg,8,6,5,rn_HanjBaXpBX7cBshPO2A

The pizza is delicious. They make things simple for you, giving you the choice of standard or white cheese pizza and a few toppings. I'd recommend the white cheese pizza with just one or two toppings. You will rejoice, especially if you are a thin-crust fan. It's great. It's not the best pizza ever, and it could benefit from being less greasy - I think people would be much less forgiving of the copious amounts of grease if this were a standard joint, for example - but it's great pizza, and it'll at least be one of the most memorable slices you'll have. 

They also serve a few desserts; I've only had the New York Cheesecake, which is pretty good, but is definitely overshadowed by the pizza. It's a convenient, in-theme dessert, more or less. 

The staff is a bit split; some of the staff are engaging and receptive, eager to help the lucky wandered-in tourists, while others are surprisingly impatient and blatantly unhappy. In the end they all make awesome pies fresh through-out the day, and it's an over-the-counter place, so it's not too much of an issue.

White pizza - thin crust with little mounds of ricotto cheese dispersed all over.  Add whatever toppings your feeling.  I went with mushroom, olives, and peppercinis and it was real good.

Beer - PBR or Stone IPA served in the red party cups, sweet!

I also saw some people getting single slices and adding a ton of toppings like sausage and meatball slices, looked like a meat lovers paradise.

They have several toppings ready. You tell them which one you want and they heat it up. The pizza is thin crust and heated to perfection.

Now this is not just a place to go when you're drunk. Went around 12pm just a little after they opened and was still super good! They also have ample amounts of seasonings to sprinkle on your pizza - cheese, red chili flakes, oregano, and GARLIC!

First-timers in Vegas will ask you where you got that huge pizza slice. Its a nondescript shop with no signage so for anyone wanting to find this place you pretty much just take the Cosmopolitan escalator all the way to the top floor, spot the narrow entranceway where people are walking out with boxes of pizza.

If you go before people are let out the clubs, its a brisk stroll up to the front of the line and the pizza comes out as soon as you put in your order. The combo deluxe slice is my favorite ($6.00) but I had the Veggie too and it was not bad. Seems like all their pie slices hit the spot. Plus, its always comforting to see the same dude in the New Era baseball cap working here every time I come. 

Not really a secret anymore but still churning out great pizza. This place is awesome.

I mean, where else will you find a pizza joint with no markings or signs of any nature. No Name Pizza Kitchen? Check. This place isn't even in the resort directory -- not on the Cosmopolitan website, nothing! How I came across this place, I have no clue, but I sure am glad I stumbled upon this place. After a journey around the Cosmopolitan, up and down elevators, back tracking and such, the mission was complete. At first, I couldn't find it and thought, ""maybe it doesn't exist"". Walking through the hallways, I smelled the scent of freshly baked pizza dough. Thinking it was an oasis of some sort, I convinced myself I wasn't going crazy. Literally following the scent of that yeasty goodness, I was finally at the small little hallway entrance that led to Secret Pizza AKA NNPK (No Name Pizza Kitchen).

The Inside was interesting. The hall way was filled with framed pictured, side by side. A relatively small place, the inside had a few pinball machines, flat screens, white walls, and hungry diners. Not a hint of Cosmopolitan's design cues bleed into the restaurant -- You are no longer at the Cosmopolitan, not even Vegas for that matter. You are totally transformed into this small hole in the wall pizza joint in New York City.

With each slice near 5 bucks, we opted for a whole pizza. We ordered it half white and half meatball with pepperoni. The white pizza was my favorite which had mozzarella, ricotta, and garlic. The garlic was fragrant and savory and the mozzarella and ricotta gave it a smooth texture. It didn' have any meat, but I preferred the white pizza over the meatball and pepperoni. The meatball and pepperoni was tasty, but it tasted to normal for me. It was a bit salty, but still very delicious. The crust on both pizzas were very impressive. Though not cooked in a wood burning oven, it was as close to a Neopolitan style pizza as can be. The slices were large and thin, and could hold its own compared to any pizza from New York City.

If there were to be a secret pizza joint with no names, no marque of any kind, Cosmopolitan would be the place to have it. But then again, with word of mouth, and the scent across the hallways, people won't have a hard time finding it. I think looking for the place is half the fun of it all. The excitement of trying the pizza, getting your pizza in unmarked white pizza boxes, its all part of the dining experience. I was amazed by their pie, probably some of the best I ever had. All you have to do is go find it. You may be wondering, exactly where is this place exactly? There isn't a sign, but you will find a ""Marquee"".

They do charge you just as much for a red solo cup for pop which is a little ridiculous, but I guess anywhere for drinks is pretty pricey for the most part.

4744332,2011-03-06,4,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"I am in no way a pizza connoisseur.  You can probably compare my palate for pizza to pure vanilla; I'll eat any toppings, eat any style crust, order delivery or sit in a restaurant...in the end, most of it is just pizza to me.  So in my book, you've created something special when you stand out above the rest.

Now just because I'll eat anything on a pizza doesn't mean I don't have some preference.  I'm always happy with sausage and mushroom on my pie.  During my first visit my buddy and I ordered a sausage, mushroom and ricotta pizza.  This...was...divine (to quote a fellow yelper).  It is a New York styled pizza, a bit light on the sauce, thin and droopy if not folded in half, and has this magical crust that remains soft on the inside and has a bit of crunch on the outside.  Note that I said New York styled; I've never been to New York or had their pizza, so I can't say if it's real or not!  What I do know is that my taste buds screamed for more pizza after that scalding first bite (guys never learn, do they?).  

On my second visit I placed two orders, a sausage, ricotta and garlic pizza; and a slice of mushroom and cheese to hold me over until our personalized pie was done.  I will say this: if you order one of the premade slices that is already sitting out, you're in for a lot more crunch than if you order a whole new fresh pie.  So bring a friend or two and go for fresh, if want that easy foldable pizza.

Another thing to note is that on my first visit, the chefs were cutting up actual sausage links for our pizza (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=ZT3AiU5KP2xY-mJsXmNZnQ).  Not so on the second visit  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=NBkD80-Yb6ykjKGuQctSoA).

About half a second later, the wonderful smell of fresh pizza hit my nose and, like a beacon, drew me in.

Compared to the other places on the strip, this place is a dive. It's about as simple as you can get; pizza by the slice or pie, limited drinks (some beer) and red solo cups next to a water cooler. That's about it folks. The prices, though, aren't typical Vegas and certainly about the cheapest you'll find on the strip. I think I paid $6 for a ""slice"" of pizza. I say ""slice"" because this could easily have fed two of us (but it didn't, and I ate the entire thing!)

I'll definitely be coming back to this place the next time I'm in Vegas. Just keep it quiet.. there's just standing room only at the counter to eat, and I don't want to have to wait for a spot! :)

This place is authentic NY style in that there are 1,000 joints like this on the East Coast for a quick and greasy pair of slices to pre-empt the hangover or begin/end a quick date that blossomed late night at one of the nearby drink and or dance establishments. 

And they are open late, which is awesome.

This is one of my favorite post-clubbing places to eat on the Strip and the best pizza, hands down. The NY style manages to pull off the combo of a crispy crust and loads of wonderfully cheesy toppings with quality ingredients. I like the White Pizza because I love cheese, and with the piles of ricotta, it doesn't disappoint. 

As delicious and hangover-preventing as it may be, the lines can be frustrating, especially if there is a wait and you're hungry. They do have video games, or you can take a nap on the chairs outside (and people do), but the best time to go is not midnight-3AM when the club-goers are released, if you can help it.

I believe that good pizza is very hard to find. It's one of those foods that is often made to be a quick cheap fix, and I find myself calling the majority of the pizza I eat average. I'm rarely ever wowed by a slice of pizza and I've grown accustomed to that. When I heard about all the praise this pizzeria was getting I was a bit skeptical, but I will let you know that all that praise is very, very well deserved.

You need to go on a bit of a hunt to find the pizzeria at the Cosmo. They don't advertise it, you wont find any signs pointing you in its direction, and they don't even mention it on their website. It's located down a random hallway on the third floor nestled next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar. It's a very small pizzeria with only a few stools for sitting and eating. They don't even have a menu. It's all about the pizza here.

The sauce is delicious, the toppings are delicious, and the crust is delicious. This pizza is delicious! It's made New York style with the floppy pizza that needs to be eaten taco style. The sauce has the perfect amount of flavor to accompany the toppings without being overwhelming or becoming overwhelmed. You can tell that the sauce is fresh along with the toppings. They don't have the largest selection of toppings but the ones that they do have are fresh and beyond tasty. The crust is just the right consistency and is one of those crusts that you wont mind eating the ends of the pizza. It all comes together to make the best pizza in town that I have tried so far. It is a bit pricey when compared to other pizza places but you pay for the quality. 

I can't stress enough about how good this pizza is. It is one of the very few pizzas that has been able to wow me. If you want to taste how a real pizza is supposed to taste like go to the Pizzeria at the Cosmo.",eSo5hmAF_UW1N5XFsx0q7Q,4,2,5,IyhFEmfchWWwSrgYGhk2jg

They have New York style pizza here and you can either by them by the slice or as a whole pie.

Flavor: 

The Pepperoni used was SALTY and gave me this bitter after taste. It's weird.. It has a great flavor but the salty was too much. Or was it the cheese?  

Can't taste the sauce. It's almost only there to keep the pizza from getting dry. I'm a big sauce person so this was a downer. Maybe next time we'll try to get extra sauce.

Thankfully, there was no line and five pies to choose from. Hubby and I chose the White Pizza and a Combo slice. I must say, the White Pizza is the way to go.

YES, check out Secret Pizza
No, don't wait until 2 or 3am
YES, go at lunchtime - there was little or no line
No, don't go looking for signage - there is none
YES, you know you've found it when you see pinball machines
No, don't plan on sharing
YES, #alwayshydrate (free filtered water FTW!)",WzFSlyPO-kARif92D_u_dQ,5,5,5,rqIRj5YolcSXadtOeKJYkA

You will find a long corridor that you need to go down in order to find it. Dont plan on looking for signs or on the Cosmo website because it wont be found anywhere.

I have read that lines can be very long here however we must have gotten lucky when we came because there was only about four people in the entire restaurant. They have very interesting decor inside and on the walls. 

When you approach the counter you can see their menu board. However they can also custom make certain pizzas for you. The pizza slices are all moderately priced and the selection is very big. When you choose what kind you want they warm it up in the oven for you. Now I dont know if this oven is magical or the ingredients are super fresh, but the pizza was one of the most delicious tasting slices I have EVER eaten.

The white pizza was my absolute fav, in fact I am craving some now.

Yes, it is $5 a slice.  Yes, it is ""just"" above average pizza (it's Vegas!).  Yes, it is not a secret anymore and there are often lines, and yes, it still is hard to find even after coming here several times (maybe it's just me).  

With all that said, I keep coming back and there is something to be said for that.  What? I don't know.  I kind of expect to pay higher than average when in Vegas so I'm ok with it.  I also kind of expect to wait in line from time to time.  Maybe my coping skills are better than some other reviewers.  But, back to the food.  It's just above or slightly above average pizza.  But after a few drinks or a big win at the tables, and it is a slice from the gods.  After a loss at the tables, its the only thing to eat because there isn't much around cheaper or more convenient.  I would say they have a great business model!

Pros: convenient (if you are in Cosmo), relatively inexpensive, not bad quality, can feed you on your last $5 after taking a beating at the tables. 

Cons: kind of overpriced for what it is. I hate trying to find this place. 

Overall.  It doesn't matter what I say, or whether I like it or not.  If I'm staying at the Cosmo again, I'll be back.  If not, maybe not.  Love their concept though, and the guys working there have always been cool as heck.",_d6ghMpGvKOlY7jNcV22_w,3,1,4,7r3h60nwc1-OwOgJI9DO4g

They have some pinball and a small counter to order along with some additional counter space hugging the walls to eat. 

All of the pizza options are delicious. There are also some alcohol options, which taste as expected, but the pizza--the pizza is delicious. My favorite was the white pizza, which I didn't originally order but I overheard a private tour guide talking to a small family about how the specialty is the white pizza, so obviously I had to grab a slice.

Such good things never last where all traces have disappeared and have gone without merit.  Secrets are kept and reasons retained under lock and key.  Whatever it may be, I dedicate this one to thee.

After seeing so many reviews of this worst kept Vegas secret, I finally ventured up two flights of escalators in the City of Sin, where whispers stay and never leave closed lips.  The Cosmopolitan hide-out comes to light as one ventures down a dingy hallway of framed magazine covers dimly lit by spotlight halogen lights (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#4bjZhYMwuBLPOZoW6DI9MA).  It's but a small 60'x60' room filled with a few pinball wizards and people patiently waiting for a slice of heavenly pie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw#o7wcJPIoRt13Dx7coGNEtw).  

Behind the counter, workers pound and toss their gooey dough (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#lW79LoJSUg1RwIPrp_kAKw), making sliced triangles ranging from $4.50 on up based on 50 cents a topping.  For those with a more voracious appetite a pie be available with prices ranging from $25 to a deluxe of $35.00.  Pie additions cost $2.50 each.  Quite expensive, but not on my ""Lost Wages"" radar, as I wanted it by the slice and by the slice I did receive.  The toppings looked plain and just nominally adequate as they sit in their aluminum bins just waiting to be tossed sporadically on round pie pans laid with golden flour.  The prices of drinks are on par with private Taoish bars:  Sodas 4 bucks, IPAs 7 bucks.  Good Ol' PBR sewer agua a ghastly 5 bucks.

We asked the chef what be best in his opinion.  Although we weren't really impressed with what was presented, we opted to go with his picks of white, deluxe, and veggie-tar-e-yan (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#VpTrXV0-B3IXvr2iCQiTtQ) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#ns2AT1cd63Rihd8BiVwDqw) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#Kh_DKlGnEKPQcgDBnzmw2g) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/secret-pizza-las-vegas?select=acCBLsK2VB2JbX_v1-aylA#yYP2x9gRAHoDEx9R5E_1dw).

The slices returned to the broiler and there they sat, until our names were called and then it begat!

No idea if I be drunk or needed to be buzzin' to enjoy these hot tempting pie slices, but whatever it was, it really worked for me.  It was but a warm slice of heaven that was on par with some of the best I've put in my mouth without worrying about spitting up some hairball.  The crust was just crisp enough with the flexibility of NY-stylin' that wrapped around my hand.  Just enough grease and just enough cheese, the deluxe was nothing but 5-star tasting'.  We ate at the small alcove bar to take in and enjoy the happening surroundings.  I actually think the re-heating is probably the key to getting the crust texture just right.

It was such a pleasure to finally unravel your secret, and while the surroundings are a bit crewed, as long as you're with friends or loved ones this place can satisfy any of your late night whims.

They offer a variety of pizzas, and I always go with some sort of meat combo. It's served NY style and is a perfect thin crust. Slices come out to be around $5 or more depending on the toppings your pizza has. Affordable for Vegas, but $5 for a slice of pizza is pretty ridiculous elsewhere. Their slices are also pretty greasy which is a downside and definitely doesn't sit too well especially when you're drunk off your butt; delicious for the time being but regretful afterwards.

We have tried many different flavors including pepperoni, cheese, combo, pepperoni mushroom. They are all amazing. Combo is my favorite but i will take whatever they have ready.

It's located in the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor, but unless you ask someone that works there, you may have difficulty finding it, since there are no signs indicating what it is, or where it is. The entrance is just a long hallway that looks like it may lead to a restroom, but surprise - at the end of the hallway is a small pizza kitchen. Seating can be sparse, so be prepared to eat while standing.  I don't know if it's my timing or what, but many times, when I visit an establishment, there are only a handful of people around. 10 minutes later, the place gets seemingly packed. That was the case here too. 

Got a slice of both the White Pizza, and the Sausage Pepperoni. I can't write too much about the White Pizza, because it's irresistable and now I feel compelled to drive all the way to the strip from Summerlin, just for a slice. It's that good! It's funny observing some of the people in line - the closer they get to the cash register, the more they seem like they are drooling, Lol!

-really accommodating staff (changed my order to go)
-packed to go slices well
-no wait on them making pizza. very efficient in having all the slices prepared
-HUGE slices (i ordered two)
-cool space

CONS:
-over priced (about $5.50 for a basic slice... get whole pizza for about $30 if you're sharing)
-VERY oily... i usually don't care about oil/grease but this pizza had too much
-nothing special about the taste (at least for pepperoni)

I grabbed a slice of the White Pizza, and it was delicious.  Oily, but still great.  Luckily there was a small line, so the wait wasn't as long as I thought it was going to be on a week night.

The full pies are expensive, but definitely more economical than paying per slice. Also, when you are craving that chewy, gooey goodness at 3AM and all the pizza delivery boys have been asleep since 2AM, paying close to $30 for a pie is definitely worth every penny.

It may be a bit of a wait (20-30 minutes) if you are custom ordering a pizza, but when you are stumbling back to your hotel room with that piping-hot fresh-out-of-the-oven pizza in your hands and everyone else is staring at you in jealousy, you won't even be mad.

But, given that it's a business and businesses need to make money, it would be my guess that being ""Known Pizza"" is preferable to the owners.  So, I'd think they're okay with the additional foot traffic.

If you are having trouble locating the hallway down which Secret Pizza is located, the smell and music help.  Additionally, you'll likely see people eating pizza near a pool table, which lets you know you're in the right vicinity.

When we arrived (Saturday around 12:15), there were already around a half dozen people either eating, ordering, or waiting.  So, given the size of the place, this made it kind of crowded.  There is a bar which circles the edge of the room, but only 6 bar stools that I counted.  This is why people leave and eat on the couches near the pool table.  I had a slice of Sicilian with sausage and a NY slice with meatball and ricotta.  These slices are not cheap when compared to other pizza joints.  A regular slice of cheese thin crust is $5.50.  Fountain drinks, served to you in a red solo cup, are $4.  But, you at least get refills, so there's that.

Both slices were good, but I preferred the thinner crust.  The crust was crunchy yet a little chewy, and the meatballs were FANTASTIC.  I want this recipe.  They went really well with the only thing I would call a bargain at Secret Pizza:  the dollar order of pickled hot peppers.  They aren't too hot, so if you don't like heat, don't be turned off on ordering them.  Nice addition to your slice.  The sausage on the Sicilian was also very good quality, and the pizza had a nice crunch on the crust.  It needed more cheese and sauce, the ratio was off.  This became more noticeable given the thickness of the slice.

I'd absolutely return, and recommend you do so as well.  It may not be so secret anymore, but a good slice of pizza is always welcome.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,1,4,xiibSGHkUVWJj2ddHjdBkA
4960319,2012-05-09,0,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"Went to Vegas this past weekend and one of the highlights of the trip was hitting up this unnamed (yet not much of a secret) pizza joint in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Luckily, I've got a friend out there that my wife went to school with so we learned about it almost instantaneously. 

The walk up into this place is pretty impressive. The Cosmopolitan is actually one of the nicer hotels in Vegas, and you don't actually get forced in the casino the second you walk in. It definitely seems to cater to a 20 somethings crowd, which I think is very appealing for people that my age bracket, but I can imagine might be tedious for people that are a little bit older.

So, on to the pizza itself. The place is small and down a fairly long hallway. They've got some pinball machines and a counter where you order and pay. No seats, but there's a little lounge back out in the hotel, so it's really not  a big deal. Their pizza is greasy and has a good crust. 

It's fucking expensive. Seriously, I don't usually complain much about price with food, but $4 for a slice is absurd. David Chang isn't making my fucking pizza back there, and even if he was I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have the balls to overcharge on a slice. 

Bottom line, it's definitely good, and I'm sure it's absolutely fantastic if you're shit faced. It's worth probably once, but unless you're right in the area you shouldn't go out of your way.",SnWiJRTOBGLdY2vrq89G_Q,0,0,4,4iMjxdBMJe4lggyEN0zYcQ

Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo next to the pool table, Secret Pizza is not only making some serious dough (in both senses of the term), but is also quite a bit of a wait at any time during the day. Three of us opted instead to get a whole pizza (some sort of supreme concoction) and a slice of the square cheese pizza (CHZ). The cheese square was basically cheese bread; delicious, but when was the combination of cheese and bread ever a bad idea. We got our pizza a few moments later and decided to eat it right outside in front of the pool table. We ended up only being able to eat one slice/ea because they were so massive (except for the guy in our group who ate 2) and took the other half back with us to feed the rest of the  crowd we were with. The pizza was super salty (from the sausage topping, I think), super oily (BARELY saved my clothes from a stain of a lifetime!), and the crust was pretty dry.

They said our wait time was going to be 25min. It took about 15 min so we were very pleased with that. 

We took it back to our hotel room to eat it. Pizza was still hot. Getting the sliced sausage was definitely worth it. It added some zest to a basic pepperoni pizza.

On to the pizza - awesome.  Nice crust that is crisp on the outside.  Has a slightly tangy taste like sourdough.  Just means they let the dough rise slowly and didn't rush it like so many places do.
Cheese was nice as was the sauce.  But the main attraction for me was the pepperoni.  Nice and spicy.  And the guy put a lot on there.  Really hits the spot and a much better value than a taco for $4 or a chinese bao for the same.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,0,0,5,wkgpOE_8UHdIVZkW0pbBSQ

That makes me think that unless a ton of folks are ordering whole pies, even a line out the door is under an hour.

I applaud them for not offering ranch - that's some weird midwest or west coast topping that folks put on pizza to mask how awful it is. Unnecessary for NY Pizza!

$5 a slice seems pretty shocking at first, but it is in a hot casino in the heart of Las Vegas Blvd, so I won't hold it against them. $4 for a Coke in a Solo cup is lame, so we bought the 2L bottle for $6.50. What a markup!",KyCJW_tKT7jpAyc7vjZ_Dw,0,0,5,vg-OG233V5VC_tPtJQa84g

For 5 dollars a slice.. And these are relatively small slices, I thought it wasn't worth my money. Don't get me wrong it was good though. The crust is very thin and crispy and I loved it, but I feel like the location uped the price so much. My slice only had three pepperonis on it. Cheese was decent and kind of stringy.

It reminded me a bit of Pepe's in New Haven even though they use a modern gas fired pizza oven to cook their pies.

The service was great for a pizza joint.  Any cashier that volunteers free refills on the soft drinks is getting my business.  The only thing holding this place back is the lack of tables and stools.  We made due with the limited counter space.

The top row is lines with $100 bills.  Bawlllerrrrr!  LOL.

When it's your turn, choose the pizza they have and they'll reheat the already cooked slice.  Usually runs about 6-8 dollars depending on the type of pizza.  I was with a group of 4 peeps.  We all the Chicago style pizza square with sun-dried tomatoes on top with 4 PBR drafts.  Total came to about $50 which was a little steep, but soooo worth it!

We grabbed up a pepperoni deep dish which was pretty decent, but not close to my favorite. The plus is that its nicely crispy and not doughy, lots of pepperoni  and sauce and cheese in it. Its much more filling than the thin slice so I suppose you get more bang for your buck with that.  

We got a slice of white pizza as well. This is one of my favorites here and the BF liked it a lot too. Its also good with their sliced sausage on it. I think if you wan't something besides a basic pepperoni, I think this is the best one they have to offer. Slices start at $4.50 for a already made slice or you can order in a whole pizza as well (I believe the last time I ordered one it was about $20ish for a 1 topping). Of course, having it fresh made is slightly better than getting a slice that's been sitting. They serve a few beers on tap or soda, and there is a water dispenser out with water cups. Other than that, they serve nothing else - just 'za! 

I think the ""secret pizza"" is not so secret, but if you aren't sure where it is, it's on the same floor as most of their restaurants. It's right next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, you'll just see a random corridor of albums and you'll see a arcade machine visible at the end. Theres some stools or standing bar.

No name, no sign, just a hallway loaded with framed photos and first thing you see at the end of the hall are 2 pinball machines and a flat screen tv hanging from the wall. At first I thought this was one of those casino arcades but my sister assured me theres a pizza place inside. Going all the way in, sure enough it's there. Pretty small area, no frills, one of those menu boards where you can snap plastic letters onto it. Board did mention they have house made pickled peppers but didn't try those. One downside there was no open view of the toppings or posted anywhere unless I totally missed it. They sell by the slice or 16"" whole pies so they had a few pies you could see over the counter. The sausage and pepperocinis on white sauce looked intriguing. We ordered half of that and other half had sun-dried tomatoes. Ricotta comes on top of all white pizzas too.
The pizza is NY style and it didn't disappoint in that aspect. It was very flavorful. Slices were big n floppy. Nice and thin, crust was nice and chewy. Edge crust still had a nice slight crispness on the outside. Pretty good if you're looking for a decent NY style pizza fix on or near the strip. A bit pricey($34.50 whole pie 1.5 topping)but theres not alot that isnt on the strip. White garlic sauce was good with the ricotta but I'd probably still prefer the Gilroy pizza during happy hour at Sierra Gold tavern.

They sell the pizza by the slice or you can buy a whole, there is a couple of beers on tap as well. Slices are decently sized and thin and very good. I was going to get a regular pepperoni pizza, however I was quite intrigued when I saw the ricotta cheese pizza. I wasn't sure if I would like the taste, so one of the employees was kind enough to let me try some of the ricotta to make sure that I would enjoy my slice of pizza. After trying the cheese and discovering how delicious it was I decided to give it a shot. I ordered a Pabst Blue Ribbon and a slice of the ricotta pizza, pizza and beer is always a good combo and the pizza did not disappoint.

Walk down the 30 foot hall and you're transported from the glitz of the Cosmo into what looks like a small-town pizza joint.  There are no tables (just a couple counter spots) and the decor consists mainly of 2 pin ball machines.

I just had a cheese slice. (Slices are $4.75, + 50 cents for each topping. Standard Vegas prices, but I could've easily turned those 5 bucks into $5,000 on slots).  The pizza is very good, similar to a slice you'd get in New York.  The one problem we had is that our slices were not heated up enough, and were on the cool side of lukewarm.

5065701,2016-01-11,7,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"""Every once in a lifetime, dreams can come true.""

That is how I felt when I took my first bite of Secret Pizza. This is one of the main reasons I came to Vegas.  Cheese drag, fat juicy chunks of sausages, and pepperoni that was to die for.

Secret Pizza really had it all. The mystique of not being formally mentioned anywhere inside of the hotel, a cool hallway of music records to give it a chic and classic kind of feel, sports playing on a TV in the corner, and the delicious pizza to go with it.

On the real, though, I don't think there's any way I would've been able to find this place on my own if The Empress hadn't been there before and led me there herself. But, that's Secret Pizza's whole thing, isn't it? I think it's pretty cool! It makes the place feel almost a little exclusive. 

Onto the food! The pizza was phenomenal. I mean, I'm by no means any pizza expert or anything, but I do know that that was the best pizza I've ever had; hands down (and I've been to Chicago, folks). The pizza that I had wasn't even a freshly baked one. It was from a hot plate and then put back into the oven for a few minutes. That's how good it was! The cheese, as mentioned above was oh so stringy. Legitimately the most stringy cheese that I have ever had on a pizza, and I loved it. The sausage on the pizza was also just amazing. They were the largest chunks of Italian sausage that I've had on a pizza before, and they were just as flavorful as they were large. Even the crust was nice and perfectly crisp, but soft at the same time. The pizza was spectacular.

To say that Secret Pizza lived up to my expectations would be an understatement. The only thing that bums me out about any of it is that I'm lactose intolerant and could only bring myself to go get pizza there once in the few days that we were in Vegas.

If you can manage to find Secret Pizza, then I absolutely suggest that you make a point of stopping by to get the same experience I did. You won't regret it!",F1-6wo7j7tpf6sZq4t3HZQ,11,12,5,0sfDDtfcMDz8vxpMGtyW4w

Is it the best pie in the US?  NO.  Not even the best in Vegas.  

Inexpensive for the Strip (less than $5 a slice).  You get to play the cool, adventurer as you seek out it's goodness (exactly what the Cosmo is all about).

A few days ago, my fiancé and I got into a random conversation about what we would want to eat for a last meal if we found ourselves on Death Row.  Both of us were kind of stumped.  Now we know.  SECRET PIZZA.  In fact, if Secret Pizza was ONLY served on Death Row, I would commit atrocities against society to get my slice.  I would.

Finding the place was kind of fun.  I had an idea of where it might be based on other Yelp reviews, but I found myself tugging on door handles that do not open and trying to push on panes of glass that looked loose.  I guess I expected it to be so secret that I would have to prove my worth in death-defying feats of strength or manifest the entrance with the power of my mind.  Oh I figured it out alright, but not before I made a total ass of my dorky self in front of lots of scantily-clad club-goers.

My fiancé started freaking out first.  For him, it was love at first ooey-gooey sight.  I heard nearby diners launching expletive-laced raves about how it was the best ""mo-effin' pizza ever.""  Yet, until I took that first bite, I didn't believe.  Now I have seen the light... I have come to Pizza Jesus.

During the entire consumption of my portion of our pie (pepperoni, sausage, and pepperoncini), I giggled like I did on my first date with my fiancé.  It was so good that I found it almost hilarious, especially since I just now found this place and I'M MOVING AWAY IN JUNE.  Oh, the cruel, cruel irony.  It's a cold world indeed.

We had plenty of leftovers.  On the way to the car with our ginormous pizza box, my fiancé and I argued over how I was apparently ""mothering him"" by making him hold our precious treasure with two hands.  Maybe he has a point - maybe I need to have a baby to detract from my abnormal attachment to inanimate objects (like pizza).  But I digress.

Oh, and we had to remove a shelf in our fridge to make the box fit.  I'm not even sure it was meant to be removed.  I actually think it's broken now.  Oh well.  It's worth sacrificing the security deposit on our apartment to preserve the pristine state of our perfect pizza.

EDIT:  FYI, the REAL secret of Secret Pizza is that you really need to order the whole pizza so it is fresh and hot.  It isn't nearly as good if you just buy whatever slice is hanging around.  Take my word for it.  Buying the whole pie and having it piping hot takes this pizza from around 3 stars to 5.",3rsZCoTmr8EM7DwtGm_RsQ,6,2,5,5Pb-AhXxH-vlDPiL0MW3-g

Which I did not think was necessary. He was so rude and he as well did not  give us the hours. So Finally the restaurant manager comes out and TELL us nothing...

Don't even bother using those electronic maps around the casino for help, because you won't find it listed under restaurants or dining/food. It's called Secret Pizza for a reason. 

If you want to come here to eat and not just to quell your drunchies, then come out lunch. The post-clubbing crowd always makes the line go out the door. Avoid that crowd and come during lunch. I like the white slice the best. Add some sausage and sundried tomatoes, and perfection! They have a new one called the sicilian slice which is similar to the white slice but a deep dish version loaded with what looks like 5lbs of cheese. Kind of pricey for a slice of pizza ($5.50 for white slice, $5 for red, $8 for sicilian), but they make up for it by giving you a good sizable slice.

TLDR: Clubbing at Marquee and got the drunchies? Go here! The line can get ridiculous, but come during lunch if you want to avoid it or suck it up and wait in that line to sober up and get your pizza. On the pricier side, but large slices!",7DNCMwpfwwwim34SWV9q1g,1,0,4,31PsyOUnoiWMnEshyzppCQ

They're opened to 4-5 a.m.  The drunk and partially drunk slur their way in to get that ""sober me up munchies"" on.  Wouldn't you want a sign up to attract more customers?  How passively cruel is that to the wobbly and incoherent?   Wandering like zombies seeking to feed, one could only chuckle at the priceless visual as they search for Secret Pizza.  

Contrarians (sober people) would say signs would defeat the purpose of their marketing goal...it wouldn't be called SECRET PIZZA...logic is never logic if drunk.

Through the corridor on the right of the Japanese restaurant within the Cosmopolitan, you'll find Secret Pizza.  There I said it.  If that's not enough, you're probably too drunk to even eat.  Within this hallway is a massive collection of interesting prints of musicians.  I think they were musicians.  The pizza aroma pulled my attention away from the pictures.    

My monstrous hunger, which developed from searching the menu, told me to get two slices.  Give up looking for a poster board list menu or what have you.  Just ask, because there are none.  Peering down through the glass, I eventually chose the meat lovers and the cheese with white sauce.  

Pizzas are the thin crust.  My crusts were a tad burnt on the edges after the oven warm up; each crispy bite was filled with a healthy (so to speak) dose of cheese and ingredients.  Both slices were delicious.  Both had surprisingly good taste considering since they were just thrown into an oven and reheated for a minute.

First, the dough doe. The crust was perfectly crunchy and slightly soft just the way I like it. The bread overall was not to thick or too thin. There was just enough for the tastebuds. 
The cheese is what you would expect from any pizza house, but the white sauce and cheese was off the hizzle. When I looked at my slice I saw that there was some garlic paste mixed in it, which is what gives the extra kick. Everyone before and after me got regular slices (presumably because of the cost?), but you are missing out if you don't get the white slice.

Tasted okay, toppings pulled off immediately telling me it's old or not cooked enough. Crust atv the top is over an inch so the slice isn't as big as it appears. 2 plain slices = $12.

I have heard about it from numerous people so I was like ""awwwwweee yeeeee I must check this place out"". I came here on a Sunday around 7 p.m. and there was no line, thank goodness. I wasn't too hungry so I shared a slice with my significant other. We got the mushroom because they were out of the white, and we didn't really care to wait for it to be made. A slice was about $4.50 and was a decent size. To be honest, this pizza was just alright and nothing too special. By no means am I a pizza connoisseur, but I have tasted better. Maybe the fact is that I just came from New York and had the best pizza of my life! But this place is just mediocre. I can see how it's a hit because it's located outside of the club, but most definitely just OK. Its kind of cute and touristy to find it though so I say what the heck, if you are in Vegas give it a try.

Pizza is already made...but they toss it back into the oven when you order a slice.  I go with the white sauce, and add pepperoni or other mix into the equation.  I've tried the red sauce, but since white is so much better to me, I usually go with what I know lol.

No where really to sit when it is busy, and the line can get pretty crazy at times, but if you don't mind waiting a little while and standing while you eat, this is a decent slice of pizza.

Now DO NOT go here after the clubbing hours. Its madness, the pies get picked up almost immediately and it takes forever to get a couple slices because people just want something in there tummies to take the buzz off or kill the hangover that is going to come the next night.

The pizza was pleasant, nothing bad about it.

Within 15-20 minutes we were at the counter to order. Crap. They ran outta White Pizza. Another 20 minutes wait. Shoot me. So, my hubs orders the pepperoni and I get the Sicilian. Big mistake on the Sicilian. Thick, bready pizza crust with just a bit of the ""white"" pizza part - which is mozzarella and ricotta I think. However, the pepperoni was super crunchy and chewy and it totally did not say in the middle (hate that). We liked the thin crust pizza we went back for another slice of cheese.

Nothing special or different about their pizza than any other I've tried. 

I got a slice of the pepperoni and a slice of sausage. I was quite upset with the amount of toppings on the pizza. Only a few pieces of sausage and pepperoni per slice was not what I expected. 

As for the taste, the crust was the highlight of the pizza. It was flaky and crispy all in one. Quite delicious. The cheese was also very tasty and these two factors are the only reason it got 3 stars instead of 2.

Okay, so maybe I am a little excitable, but even if they were serving DiGiorno down this album-decked hallway, you'd have to give the brilliant masterminds credit for hiding a New York style pizza joint on a floor of fine dining in a world class hotel. People love surprises. People love pizza. People love being in on the secret. I love the secret pizza joint!

The set-up is brilliant. Down a long mysterious hall lined with amusing album covers (example Saturday Nite Fiedler), you arrive in a New York City pizza joint. You feel as if you are really in New York standing in front of a pizza counter, peering over the edge to decide which slice was made for you! I felt as if I had just been out clubbing all night on Manhattan and needed to grab a slice before tunneling my way back to Jersey City! 

And, the best part, the pizza is goooood. (Yes, that is good with extra o's to demonstrate that it is in fact better than good.) At least one of the pizza makers here is straight from Italy, and he used to work at an off the Strip pizza place where he earned the nickname Picasso for his beautiful, delicious pies. As soon as we heard he was here, we knew we had to go and partake in one of his masterpieces. 

I am no pizza expert, but this thin, crispy NY style crust even had the slight burn to it that I have heard pizza connossieurs adore. The crust had a nice, simple flavor, and I thought the sauce was tasty especially with a heavy dusting of crushed red pepper. As for the toppings, this may be the one place where they disappoint. I had a plain cheese. A glance of their buckets of toppings did not inspire me to load up on anything. However, the construction of the pizzas is darn near perfect- not too much sauce, not too much cheese. Each bite is the ideal balance of sauce, crust, cheese, and I think that is a key element for successful pie. Then again, I am not pizza expert, but I am a value expert. $3-ish a slice is a steal when you're on the Strip. 

I can see the future, and the future holds long lines for a taste of the secret pizza, so get there now before the secret ain't so secret anymore.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,41,26,5,Y06qJDKImuaoB1IgWT8Iuw

There's no name posted outside and you have to go through a long hallway.  The line can get pretty long, so the wait of course is long, and you have to wait even longer (30-40 min) until your pizza is ready.  Whole pizzas are nearly 30 bucks.  What a rip.  Since it was pricey, I was expecting good pizza or like the best.  During our wait, my friend and I got water from the water dispenser.  That thing is so slow.  Someone needs to adjust the nozzle.  Just to fill a cup, you have to wait about a minute...how ridiculous is that!

Finally, when our pizza was done, we ate it and wasn't amazed.  It was at least fulfilling to our appetite.  We ate it at the couches and was approached by a promoter who had just moved to Vegas from London.  Nice fellow...  He's never been to this pizza place before so we gave him a slice to try.

Okay okay, maybe the moniker is because the place is unmarked, tucked away down a hallway next to a sushi joint, and you really will miss it unless you're looking for it. But it's still the worst-kept secret in the Cosmopolitan.

It's thin-crust (but NOT crispy) pizza and for slices, you're limited to handful of choices - cheese, pepperoni, and white pizza. You have more flexibility for toppings if you order a whole pie, but beware the wait. It took us upwards of 35-40 minutes for two pizzas, and save for a half-and-half topping on one of them, we didn't really order anything complicated. I was, however, extremely grateful for the FREE WATER!

The white pizza is the standout here. So much garlic and olive oil that it will leave your paper plate soaked. It was a little on the soggy side because of all of the oil, but at 2am, it's exactly what the doctor ordered. If you're wearing insane heels and you've just finished a night of going big at one of the clubs, you will want to sit on the couches outside of the place to relax and eat.

There is also a Donkey Kong arcade game inside the place. It's a great way to pass the time, but beware the Kong. It will suck you in, beat you down, frustrate you, tease you, and leave you with a hole in your heart. Have fun.",hVXJ8ag9djpzQqvd6jvNTw,5,5,4,Ewhb_u4hB3fx5r_eSLtrlA

A friend who'd been here before introduced the rest of us to it and we loved it! After getting some expensive munchies at China Poblano we were ready to fill the rest of our stomachs for a lot less, and Secret Pizza delivered. You go down an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor and it leads to a teeny little hole-in-wall pizza joint like ones you find on virtually every street corner in NY. The guys keep the huge pies coming, which you get by the slice. A slice will run you about $5, depending on toppings and with a draft of PBR it's almost $10 but that's really a bargain in these parts. 'Sides, the pizza is legitimately good. Big and floppy but with a crunch to the crust, it really made me feel nostalgic for the NY slices I used to get. There was a bit of a rush when we got there but the turnover's pretty fast so you should be able to squeeze into some counter space, unless you get there late night, when the real rush is on, with everyone wanting to get some grub on after clubbing or whatever. I did end up coming here again after such a late-night venture and it tasted even better, naturally.

I think that a lot of the reviews hype this place up a bit too much, either that or a lot of these people have never really had NY style pizza IN New York.

That said, it's good, especially for NY style pizza, outside of NY. However, it's far from great, and it's on par for other Vegas pizza joints.  

The crust was far too crunchy, rather that that perfect crust for the fold it in half true NY pizza experience, I think if I had folded it in half it probably would've just snapped. The cheese and grease level were perfect however.  The slices are HUGE, which they should be for $4.50 for plain cheese.

Definitely a great find, and good pizza, but if you're from NY, like me, don't go in expecting the best pizza you've ever had and you'll certainly have a much better experience.",yMNgkWt2Z2-GhyU9_I5j1w,1,0,4,pmA9Pj7YnwQWE7gD6D_LyQ

Sure, the cheap stuff, but you cant go wrong with delicious pizza and cheap beer. The joint is small, AND I MEAN SMALL, a couple counter tops and a few arcade games and pinball machines.

A small place with a TV and a couple of pinball machines plus the slice counter down a long hall of records the restaurant was perhaps half full when I arrived and with three pizzas ready to serve my choice was simplified dramatically when a fresh Roma and Ricotta emerged from the oven as I was waiting in line.  Friendly in service and low in price for a hefty slice with excellent ingredient quality I've heard many compare Secret to New York slice shops and while the foldable structure and gas oven production is similar I'll simply say that anyone making such claims is a fool - most New York Slice shops are serving low quality ingredients on a subpar crust for ninety-nine cents while Secret is serving top quality sauce without unnecessary sweetness under smooth mozzarella on a crust with a good crunch, great chew, and an excellent crumb.

I've had this place bookmarked for years & finally had the chance to try it as we're staying at the same hotel of its location.

If I could remember, LOL! It was good, but way overpriced for a slice! Gotta pay by the slice.

$5.00 for cheese pizza
$5.50 for 1 topping pizza

For 5 slices, I don't know how we ended up paying for 2 slices of cheese pizza because we got 2 pepperonis, 2 pepperoni & mushrooms, & 1 cheese garlic ricotta slice.

That said, this pizza was pretty darn good for thin crust and fair priced at $3 a slice for cheese and an extra 50 cents for each additional topping. I tried a cheese slice and a slice of pepperoni. Both were good but I must admit that I did use a napkin to soak up some excess grease from the pepperoni slice. 

The option to just stop in for a slice of pizza is great as long as you can locate it. I heard the beer price is reasonable but I forgot to look into it. I would recommend just running into an ABC store on your way over for a huge beverage selection.

Service was good. Cashier was friendly and all employees looked like they were keeping up with the busy crowd. FYI, they don't give water cups out, you'll have to pay around $5 for bottled water.

The lines can be out the door and through the lobby lounge area. And it takes FOREVER. It can sometimes be close to an hour wait. The slices are expensive but definitely tastes delicious. 

But here's why their service is not good... A stranger walked up to us and offered to buy us our pizza when we were near ordering towards the front of the line. We didn't think anything of it at the time until the cashier lady scolded us for letting him buy us pizza. He cut the line, bought us our pizza and some slices for himself and then left. I'm just wondering why WE were the ones who got in trouble instead of the man that cut the line. If they really did not condone people cutting in line, then they shouldn't have served the guy. She should have told him to get to the back of the line or tell him to leave. But no. She sells him his pizza and doesn't say a freakin* word to him. Then turns to US and tells us that she'll kick us out next time if we let someone cut the line...

I get it, we shouldn't have let him buy us our pizza, but it was our first time there. I'm sure she sees that kind of stuff all the time so why didn't the employees of Secret Pizza protect their customers? Why did they allow someone to cut the line and take advantage of another customers gullibility? Yea, I fell for it and I've learned my lesson, but seriously, why scold us for the other guys actions.

Walk through a hall filled with pictures of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc. and you'll find one of the best slices of pizza you'd ever have in Vegas.

I usually like to keep my pizza real simple: either margherita or pepperoni. My friend wasn't hungry but we both got 2 slices of pepperoni pizza anyway. We got our food pretty quickly. My friend thought the shaker he grabbed had parmesan cheese in it but it was actually garlic powder that he just dusted all over his pizza. I did the same thing but only because I like the taste of garlic. It was soooo gooood. The crust was perfectly crisp and not soggy. They're pretty generous with the toppings. It's about $5/slice but it's worth it.

Secret pizza is located on the third floor of the Cosmo. If you see a hallway with old, kitschy records (vinyl y'all) and what appears to be a pin ball machine, winner, winner chicken dinner! Follow your nose and prepare to drool. 

It's like the hole in the wall pizza by the slice places in NYC. There are no thrills. A pizza counter and guys making fresh dough and heating slices. A single slice is HUGE and is $4.50/$5.00 a slice. Trust me, you'll only need one.  They also sell whole pies, beer, soda, and 2 liters.

My favorite is the White Pie is my favorite. Garlicky, creamy, gooey dough heaven. My second favorite is the plain cheese. How you know the pizza is good? My mama is a New Yorker. She taught me that when you pick a slice up, the bottom half is droopy and the slice can be folded in half (taco shape). Secret Pizza does alllllll of this.

I was dreading the wait because I've heard from friends the line here can be pretty long and crazy but good thing I went around 8-9 pm because that's when everyone is getting ready for the club or going to the club haha now I know that's probably the perfect time to go cause I didn't have to wait no longer than 10 minutes in line and the service was quick I was in and out before I knew it. The pizza slices here are ginormous ! I was having a hard time finishing one slice by myself lol. It's actually a good price for a slice too no more than $5.

Any who, right before you meet the counter you will finally see the menu on the top right. Pretty simple - 1 topping is $5 and then more toppings equals higher and higher prices. Well I got the sausage and pepperoncinis and my mom got the mushroom and cheese. Total was about $13. We wanted a drink but didn't feel like paying $4 for a Solo cup-sized soda. Also didn't feel like buying a mini water bottle for $1.50. So finally we ate our pizzas. It was good...But that's about it. Nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary.

I'm just going to keep this real short.

Secret Pizza isn't much of a secret. You'll notice where it is as soon as you see people eating pizza while in the sitting areas. It's an awesome place for food when you're drunk or right after you get out of the club. Or any time, really. I usually go at night.

Their cheese pizza is best. Stringy, gooey cheese. 

Their pepperoni is really salty and covers the taste of their cheese. Good if you like pepperoni. Not good if you want to just taste the cheesey goodness. 

If you're with friends, get a whole pie. Split it. Much more cost efficient and you get more pizza that way.

One slice is around $5-6. One pie is about $28-30. That is assuming you're just getting a cheese pie or pepperoni. The more toppings you get, the more expensive. Price is average to be honest, especially compared to places like Grimaldis.

The place was actually pretty easy to find, with a name like 'secret pizza' I was expecting something more mysterious.. like a store that had a back door into the pizza place or something lol idk!! It was pretty crowded in there which sucked cus it's such a small place, probably like a good 15-20 people. 

We waited about 5 minutes to order and I wasn't too sure of how to order exactly so I just pointed at the one I wanted. I got a slice with pepperoni, sausage and jalepenos. It came out to $6.50 for a slice of pizza, plus they ask if you want to tip at the register so it just makes you feel obligated to. The price was preeeetty steep in my opinion. It was good though, I liked how good quality the sausage was. They also have red pepper flakes, parmesean and garlic powder in shakers on the little counter available.

Overall, I wasn't too impressed. The pizza was good but idk if it was $6.50 + tip good lol. The place is super tiny too, like I mentioned, so there's barely any seating area. I think it's a cool place to say that you've been to, but not really worth going to a second time.

The Service ---
The service was fine.  You order at the counter and they call your name and you pick it up.  It's a tiny little place.

The Food ---
We got 2 pizzas, one cheese and one with mushrooms, bell peppers and pepperoni.  It took about 30 minutes or so for the pizzas to be done but it was worth the wait.  The crust was nice and thin, although I do prefer it to be a little more crunchy on the bottom.  The cheese was delicious.  Overall, great pizza and good at room temperature as well!

The Prices ---
It was a little pricey.  I think the cheese was $24 and the other one was $29 or something.  But the pizzas were huge.  We had 8 people and had about 5 slices or so left.  And it is in Vegas, everything is more expensive in Vegas.

Some positives, it's open really late and the pizza is decent, the crust is really good, just my opinion the red sauce could be better.

It was Monday morning at 11:00AM and the girls wanted to grab some slices before heading home.  Wandering around the hotel, I asked one of the nice Cosmo' staff where the pizza joint is.

Staff: ""Hmmm.. I don't know if I can trust you. This is some top secret pizza.""
Me: ""Really? Because it got a gang of reviews on Yelp. How top secret can it be?""
Staff: ""Hmm good point. You're standing right in front of it.""

So the pizza place opens at 11:30 and there was a wooden door/wall in between 2 restaurants, so we waited. 11:25 came and there were already people lining up. 

Once the place opened the wooden wall was flipped and we walked down the long corridor and finally saw the pinball machine people were talking about.  We were greeted by some young cheery staff members. They had 4 pies ready which included: white, meat with mushrooms, plain cheese and a pepperoni.

As we placed our order, the pizza maker told us it'd be cheaper for us to get a pie.  We decided to do a half white and half sausage/pepperoni/mushroom. It came out to about $24 for a pie.

White pizza. Good if you like ricotta cheese. Very soft texture but very flavorful. The meat/mushroom pizza was just okay to make. The dough was nice and soft with crisp golden edges but the ingredients lacked the umph.  It could be in the marinara sauce. Who knows.

Overall a good pizza for something on the Vegas strip at a swanky place like the Cosmo. I wouldn't say it's to die for (unless you're broke and needing to save all the $ you can for gas so you can make it back to LA). LOL.

On all three occasions I was hungry and pretty inebriated and not once did I think it was best pizza I've ever tasted in my life. Cause everything taste pretty good when your drunk right? Not really... I just ate it and thought to myself ""Okay, I'm hungry, and this will do"".

Okay, I would only maim someone over this pizza... not actually kill.

To tell the truth, I wasn't expecting much when I laid eyes on boxes and boxes of this pizza floating down to the first floor of the Cosmopolitan, feeding hungry oafs watching the Super Bore game. Yes, I was one of the oafs trying to stay awake and hoping the game would pick up - shit, I was hoping that Elway (sitting in attendance) would jump in and take over for Manning.

Anyway, the pizza looked a little ""blah"" and the pepperoni/sausage looked a little grey. Although, I now think it was just the lighting in the Chandelier Bar, where we were posted up. 
After the friend and I shared a burrito from the mall across the street, and some very pricey ""street tacos"" from China Poblano (on the 2nd floor) - 3 dinky tacos for $16, I volunteered to go in search of this secret pizza place... why not? All the other oafs seemed to really enjoy this pizza. 

I will give you exact coordinates to find this pizza joint: 36.1100° N, 115.1753° W.... or just take the escalator, near the Chandelier Bar, up to the 3rd floor, make an immediate left off the escalator, stroll a few paces past the other restaurant, and veer to the right down the non-descript hallway which appears to be designated for employees only, or passage to purgatory. Tucked away is a little door to some pretty damn tasty and reasonably priced pizza. It's a tiny little spot, smaller than a Kardashian closet - no sitting area, just a couple of small bar tops where you can stand and scarf down.

They sell pizza by the slice, whole pizza, and some kind of obscenely delicious looking fat/chicago-style pizza (but, you have to get your timing right to get your hands on one of these slices - may even be a special order thing). You can also add more toppings to whatever slice you choose. I nabbed a couple of pepperoni/sausage with bell peppers for myself and friend. Damn, I wished we knew about this spot earlier in the day - would have ordered a whole pizza. It was very, very tasty. Can't believe I wasted good $ on sub-par Chinese/Mexican tacos.

There was no wait when we went, but it was early on a weeknight. Might as well go for the novelty of it.

Sober or otherwise, I always stop by here for a great slice of pizza and honestly it is SO worth it. Depending on what time you go, the line can either be super short or out the door. Either way, you won't regret coming here.

As the name suggests, the location of it is a little secret. That is, you really have to know where you're going or you'll easily walk by it. To be honest, the easiest way to get there is to go to Marquee nightclub and then take the glass elevator up to the third floor. When the elevator doors open, Secret Pizza will be to your immediate right. (If someone knows of a quicker way to get here please let me know!)

My personal favorite here is the white pizza which has alfredo sauce and a variety of cheeses for toppings, but if you're lucky I definitely recommend the deep dish Sicilian pizza--is it TO DIE FOR!!

The cost of a slice can vary from $5 and upwards and you can expect to wait a couple minutes if you order a whole pizza as well (but can you blame them? Its fresh)!

One note: they do offer complimentary water but after a certain hour into the evening they stop doing so.

If you go at night, take the elevator instead of the escalators so you don't have to wade through the ridiculous crowds waiting to get into Marquee!

Go down the dark, narrow hallway that's completely lined with picture frames...if you get off the elevator, the hallway is immediately on your right, probably less than 10 feet away.  If you pass a restaurant with a row of sushi chefs wearing little white hats, you've missed it!  Turn around!!

Looking at the menu pix that other reviewers have taken, prices have gone up a bit.  They start at $3.25 for a simple cheese slice and up to $4.75 for a combo slice ($0.50 for each additional topping).  Full pies range from $18.50 to $28.00 ($2.25 for each additional topping).

The pizza was delicious - large, flavorful, NY-style thin-crust slices.  If you're picky about grease...just blot it off with a napkin.  They have glass shakers of oregano, red pepper flakes, parmesan cheese and garlic salt on the counters that line the walls.  

My fave was the white pizza w/ fluffy, soft ricotta & mozzarella cheese, second fave was the pepperoni & meatball.  Sausage & pepperoni was delicious as well...the only one that was kind of meh was one with pepperoni and green peppers (possibly because I'm anti-green peppers?

Took us a good 360 spin around when we got to the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan, but we found it! It's literally down the hallway in between 2 restaurants and it was a lot smaller than I expected. Luckily, there was no wait when we got there and was able order right away.

My friend and I ended up getting a slice of their White, Margherita, and a Sausage w/ ricotta cheese. My personal favorite was the white pizza, but the sausage one definitely had more flavor to it. They fire it up in the oven for a minute or two so it comes out nice and crispy which is pretty awesome. When I asked for some banana peppers, they guy said they didn't carry that and ended up giving me some peperoncino instead (similar, but a little sweeter imo).

Each slice is $5.50 and with a drink our total came out to a little over $20. The slices are a pretty decent size - although they're more on the thinner side.

For its prices, it's decent pizza. They have a handful of slices to choose from, so I went with my typical white pizza - how I wish they put spinach or another type of green on top! My friend's husband got one with meatball topping and my boyfriend got traditional pepperoni. Our slices were warmed up quickly (my boyfriend lucked out with a fresh slice) and we grabbed our drinks and sat outside the pizza place near the pool table.

My wife wanted a little midnight snack, so I walked down here to get her a couple of slices.  When I arrived, there were maybe 15 people in front of me.  The line was moving along though, so it didn't take too long to get up front.  I arrived at the counter and went with 2 slices of veggie (these were the only 2 slices of veggie sitting out, and they did look a little bit old....this will come into play later).  $13.00 later, I had my slices and was on my way back to the room.  About that....if you ask them to take it ""to go"" they will put another plate on top of your slices, wrap it up, and put it in a bag for you to carry while keeping the pizza still warm. 

I got back to the room and my wife started to eat the slices.  I was pretty full from earlier in the day (once again, this will come into play later), so about halfway done with her first slice, I ate the other half, and she started in on the 2nd slice.  The crust was great!  It had a nice crisp crunch, and a good chew to it.  The cheese and toppings felt kind of ""greasy"" though (once again, this will come into play later).  I ate my slice, but didn't feel too great afterwards. 

Around 20 minutes later, we went to bed.  I was laying there in bed and could not fall asleep.  I was hot, my stomach was growling and I didn't feel good at all.  About an hour after I had laid down, I had to rush up and head to the bathroom.  Barfed up all of that pizza.  It tasted really sour coming up, too.  As soon as I was done puking, I felt 100 times better and went back to bed.

About the ""incident""..................

1.  I was pretty full to begin with already, and probably shouldn't have ate that piece of pizza.  Did it put me over the top?  
2.  I had smoked a pretty strong Cuban cigar about 30 minutes before I went down to get the pizza.  Was it too much nicotine that made me feel woozy?
3.  I said earlier that the slices looked like they had been sitting out for a bit, and they were the only veggie slices in the case.  When I was eating them, they felt ""greasy"".  Could these slices have been sitting out for hours? Did I choose the wrong slice?  

So bringing into account those 3 things, it could have been a perfect storm of the combo of factors coming into play, or it could have just been bad pizza.  My stomach is pretty strong, but if something doesn't sit right with me, I know almost immediately (within 30 minutes or so).  The fact that it tasted horribly sour when it was coming back up, leads me to believe that the pizza was the overwhelming factor of my stomach issues.

Would I try them again?  Um...maybe?  A little too pricey for a few average size slices (I mean, it IS Vegas, but still......), and factor in the bad memory of throwing up within an hour after eating here, that puts me at a crossroad.  Try it again, get a ""good"" slice and have some of the best pizza around?  Or steer clear, save some money and avoid any possible chance of barfing?  Tough call...........",6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA,8,6,2,tkk0tTIzaR-rACiNIWS-Hg
5506081,2016-11-22,1,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"New York style pizza. Hand tossed with a thin crust. It's located between Blue Ribbon Sushi and Jaleo on the 3rd floor in the Cosmopolitan. There's no sign, thus the secret ;)

You walk down the small corridor and you'll find the pizza along with some pinball and old arcade machines. There's not much seating in the place, so you'll usually find a handful of people chowing down on pizza in the lounge area in front of STK.

Honestly, the pizza is OK. But as a disclaimer, I may have become more of a gourmet pizza snob over the years not having lived in places like Chicago or NY where they have more of those classic pizza joints. 

Love the crust though, nice and chewy. Their toppings are also limited to more classics. A bit pricey for a slice, but hey, it's Vegas. We'll usually end up ordering a pie with a pitcher of soda for about $35.",Lp3YKesc6hahMLgXcv3L2w,2,1,3,9-wdXXrkmRBG5d4SL0cqQA

If the first rule of Secret Pizza is to not talk about Secret Pizza (right Yvette??  Haha), someone definitely wasn't paying attention!  Not that I have a problem that they did...because now I can write my review without having to feel guilty about it.

Tucked away on the third floor and with no signage to point it out, finding the entrance is to literally look for a hole in the wall.  Once you do though, it's just a short trip down a hallway until you find yourself in a small room and in front of their pizza counter inside.  They offer a variety of pizzas by the slice at any given time, as well as whole pies that you can customize.  Since there was about ten of us there, we opted for two large pizzas - one with pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom, while the second had mushrooms, sausage, and green peppers (I think...didn't try that one).

All in all, the pizzas were pretty solid.  There was a generous amount of tasty toppings and I liked how there wasn't a ton of sauce.  I certainly wouldn't say it's the best pizza out there, but it was good and a lot better than I had expected.  The best part of all though was their prices - at about $4-5 a slice and $22 for a three topping pizza, they're comparable to what regular pizzerias would charge and definitely budget friendly for the Strip.  As far as late night/post-partying food options go, Secret Pizza is a solid bet.  

BTW, a word of advice from my friend - in your potentially inebriated state, try to remember to wait before taking that first bite.  You might not feel all that hot oil burning your mouth when you're drunk, but you'll definitely feel it when you wake up the next day (""Dude, my tongue REALLY HURTS"").",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,10,9,4,DIqmYwkcPFcYnEpWvzXeOQ

I admit it. While celebrating my 25th extravaganza in Vegas last week, I am guilty of being a repeat offender of Secret Pizza. For a bunch of girls (and boys) who revolves our schedules around eating and trying new places, I would say that is quite a compliment!

Here's how it all started. Before we decided to go bar crawling in the Cosmopolitan, a local friend of mine told me that I should get the white pizza at Secret Pizza. Intrigued by this mysterious pizza joint and white pizza, the gang and I headed over in our tight dresses to devour some deliciousness. Being greedy as ever, I decided to go for their famed white slice and a combo. Halfway through, I realized my stomach is much smaller than I thought and had a difficult time finishing. The unique taste of the white pizza (composed of 3 different types of cheeses) had my taste buds jumping for joy but the familiar taste of the combo had me equally impressed.

Secret Pizza makes me feel like I'm so ""in the know"". From the outside, no one would know what the hallway leads to. For those who rarely ventures off into random hallways, well that's their loss! I plan on coming back next time I'm in Vegas, so yelper's-- please keep the long lines as short as possible by keeping this place a secret!",Nza9TrumxVALFOc3zpPxDg,8,6,4,Rmjdy-6LzjRy0B8RJwio0Q

After dinner with a good friend, a few shows, some gambling, daiquiris from Fat Tuesday and a Bellagio water show behind me, I finally made my way to Secret Pizza around 1am. This was probably a bad idea because it's the time everyone starts getting out of clubs and lining up for pizza as well!

Secret Pizza is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, on the 3rd floor behind the free pool table, and I'm not gonna lie, I got a little lost finding it. If not for Yelp and TripAdvisor, I probably would've never found it. 

Right away, I noticed a fat line of drunken people in the hallway and thought ""great..."" The line was actually moving reallllly slow and the hallway was as loud as a market. A lot of people also came from Marquee nightclub in the same hotel, making the line twice as long by 2am.

After about 40 minutes, I was starting to wonder if I really wanted pizza that badly but by now, the line was starting to move and I was almost to the front.  

Once I actually got to order, I got about 4 slices to bring back for people at the hotel, two pepperoni and two white sauce (which Yelp said was the best flavor). The pepperoni was really good but the white sauce was extremely tasty!

A little heavy for thin pizza (there was a lot of grease) but it's late night food, so what do you expect? Next time though, I think I'll line up a little earlier and beat the crowd. Maybe buy a whole pie to share. 

For 4 slices, it came out to about $20, kind of pricey but cheap for Vegas. 

If you do get pizza after midnight though, make sure to bring something to do or go with lots of people to keep you company since it is a long, long wait.",U6PGMWYyV1GpNfgS_4OiVA,3,0,4,5bNIDfG_OUbbvlyuMoRrvA

I decided to go with a slice of cheese and pepperoni while my girlfriend went with the white pizza with mushrooms.  Upon the first couple bites, the pizza was absolutely delicious.  The thing that really put me over was the crust.  The crust was perfectly crunchy and tasty.  I will have to say that this place takes my favorite small pizza spot back in Houston simply because of the crust.  Although it is a couple dollars more than the slices back home, I will consider this pretty cheap knowing that i would spend over $80 for my girlfriend and I had we ate in one of the restaurants next door.

Get that for sure. The regular slices we had with pepperoni. Big NY style slices.

Even on a non-crazy busy night here, we still had to wait for the white pizza do be done baking. Otherwise you are left to choose from what they have at the ready. Good stuff. I liked it. Service was indifferent.

It should be Pizza Counter With No Name and not Secret Pizza... not important though.  

It was fun tracking through the Cosmo with my swerve on trying to find this place.  It took about 45 minutes.

We ordered the white pizza.  The crust is thin and holds up well when folded.   The crust was crispy on the bottom and had a slight chew to it.  The crust was perfect.  I would like a comforter made for my bed from this crust.

The pizza was topped off with a perfect melody of garlic and ricotta.  

If someone stole my car and left me 2 of these pizzas in the parking spot, I think I would be happy.  

Later that night I dreamed I was in bed with Selma Hyeck.  She was wearing a white tank top with no bra and my boxer shorts. We were watching Married With Children laughing having a good time.  I was eating a whole white pizza from this Pizza Place With No Name.  She reached inside the pizza box and tried to grab a piece.  I quickly moved the box from her reach and said ""My Pizza.""  Then I kicked Selma out of bed, and said ""go sleep on the couch CRAZY!""  She apologized and slept at the foot of the bed.

In reality, this place gets a lot of attention because most pizza joints in this town suck!  With that being said, The Best Pizza in Las Vegas.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,2,1,5,4un7DFKfFU2NGB3aY__sgA

Many a Yelper have just accidentally stumbled onto this pizza place in the Cosmopolitian en route to something else. Unlike them, I cheated, using Yelp and the Internet to do the dirty work for me. It also helps that I saw other people just randomly going into the 3rd floor with whole pizza boxes. Once you hit the 3rd floor, look between Jaleo (the Spanish place) and Blue Ribbon (sushi) for a small hallway filled with records.

The pizza place is supposed to be small and simple; No1DP notes that it's reminiscent of the pizza joints he used to frequent back in NY/NJ. There's seating and counter space only for ~5 people and there's only 2 pinball games. The concept's really simple: pick pizza for slice or customize a whole pie. 

No1DP was craving pizza as Japan really doesn't know how to do a good pizza. I was there for another reason: to try the concoction known as ""white pie"".
Crust: Thin and crunchy, which the No1DP says is the way to do a New York-style pizza. The pizza gets cold quickly so eat it while you can. No1DP says that this is why you see people eat this pizza fast - there's not much crust to absorb the heat.
-Veggie Supreme: Came to ~$8.00/slice as he had lots of toppings. He says that this is the best pizza he's had in a while and can easily put this in the top 10 pizza joints he's visited.
-White Pie ($5.50): The No1DP said to me that each pizza joint does their white pie differently, but in essence this is a cheese pizza with NO tomato sauce. When fresh off the oven the cheese is stringy but it held together well. I really liked the garlic and they are generous with the ricotta - this soft cheese literally just melts in your mouth!

Both were good--I'm a little biased though since I'm a fan of most people. The dough was chewy but had that nice crunch to it and the crust wasn't hard like a cracker.

Secret Pizza is on the third level of the Cosmopolitan inside a small alley sandwiched between two other places whose names I don't remember. Secret Pizza is more like a take away stand with a handful of barstool type seats along the wall to eat your pizza. The menu is simple, basically New York style thin crust pizza that is sold by the slice (~$6). There are basically two types of pies that you can get the regular peperoni pizza which has the regular red sauce or the white pizza which basically uses ricotta & mozzarella cheese as the base. We decided to get a whole three topping white pizza (~$40) and went with meatballs, half peperoni and half mushrooms. After this it was a 15 minute wait in which time the pie was freshly baked and come out piping hot.

Upon receiving the pie the first thing I noticed is that it was pretty big but the toppings were sparse covering only 65% of the pizza leaving a large outer crust bare. As soon as I picked up the first slice it was clear that it was extremely oily. I've eaten pizza's in NY so I was expecting a little grease but this was way too oily and not in a good way. The pizza itself was great. I don't like super crispy crusts that result from overcooking thin crust pizza's so I was happy that this crust had the right amount of flexibility that allowed you to eat the slice by gently folding it. The ricotta & mozzarella cheese base was excellent and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Unfortunately a tiny amount is put on very much like the other toppings. Pricewise I felt that it was relatively more expensive when compared to other joints on the strip even after giving it the Vegas Strip plus large Casino handicap especially looking at the miniscule amount of toppings.

One last comment would be that this place is super popular and is a testament to word of mouth that spreads by social media. In the 25 minutes that we spent eating the pie on the 3rd floor lobby we were approached by no less than 6 parties asking us for the precise location of secret pizza.

I mean, the reviews tell it all. I didn't complete believe that this would be THIS good but it really is. I ordered (3) slices. (Feta Pizza, Cheese Pizza, and Veggie Pizza) They were all great but Feta has to be my favorite.
I regretted not ordering more Feta pizza slices. That feta pizza was seriously the BOMB. I still regret that I didn't get more slices. Their pizza isn't super oily as well which I really liked. It was pretty thin and big!\

But after visiting twice within 12 hours, I noticed some things. In the day, when it is considerably slower, they have to reheat the slices. Sometimes the crust was thicker on the edge and moist, other slices not so much. I liked it better fresh, late at night. 

Even though I find the pizza tasty, it certainly is not the best pizza I've ever had. I also despised waiting in a long, sketchy line without a sign, but, hey, what can you do when you drive all the way from Henderson to grab some slices.

This place ain't so secret anymore. 
For you newbies, I'm going to keep you guessing, but I would imagine that just scrolling through a few of these reviews would pinpoint this place for you. Hint: Look for the hall...

Plain and simple, Secret Pizza REALLY needs to be renamed. How about Scrumptious Secret Pizza? But really, this place is so damn good. I've been about half a dozen times now and I've had a consistently tasty product. They have various pre-made pizzas, and then they stick the slice(s) in the oven once ordered. Sounds cheap and ""not good,"" but let me tell you, IT'S GOOD. I love their flattened meatballs and their large pepperoni slices. Hell, it's all good. The crust is really what helps make this pizza way above average..crunchy yet a bit chewy and dusted with flour on the ends. Again..yum. Plain pieces of cheese pie run $4.50, and each topping is $0.50. My meat-lover's slice I had in December ran $6 but it was so worth it. 


TIP: This place's peak hours tend to be when all the drunkies leave Marquee post 1 or 2 AM (uh...guilty). Be prepared to wait maybe even 30 minutes for that late night snack to soak up all of the alcohol you may have just imbibed in Marquee. 
Beware: You want a soda? That'll cost you $4, and it's served in a red solo cup. wait...what? 

Unfortunately, I have to take the ambiance into account...and SP is not exactly what I consider pleasing. Yes, I understand that it went for the New York parlor pizza type of replication, but there are some sketchy people in here pretty often (last time there was a pimp...you just know when you see one).

However, the staff I've encountered have been pretty laid back and cool. They'll slice your piece in half if you ask!",qT4Tnxde6kNokU5G4Fhv4A,1,0,4,795IGRsUeUcNKg7_Z3R1xw

Rumor the water is brought from New York. 

The water is Vegas tap.

Rumor the owners are from New York and transported an entire New York pizzeria from NYC.

Nope, the equipment was bought new for the Cosmo when it opened.

Rumor The dough is from NYC.

The dough is a sour dough the Corp chef's spent months perfecting.

Here is the back story.

When Cosmo opened it wanted a pizza place. Because space was at a premium, they planned this  to go pizza place. Hidden in an used area of the flor. There was a lobby pool table. Now removed, in the lobby area.

The hallway pictures were added to make it feel like you Are traveling to a NYC pizzeria, as was the pin ball and white attire of the cooks.

They had on the menu house made pickled peppers and desserts  sadly missed. But the popular pizza stile the show.

Late nights people but each other slices on line. They will make whole pizzas if you ask.

I have to be quiet honest though that this place is a tad pricey compared to the normal pizza by the slice spots that I go to in the bay.

Me and the wifey simply came here on a very very small appetite, but the fact that we were in Vegas and looking for something to do, I suggested we searched for this so called ""Hidden Pizza"" spot I can always go for a nice slice of New York style pizza. Anyways we only ordered one slice of pizza to share amongst us two, as I mentioned before that we came here not hungry at all. Well, we ordered a meatball pizza, which was something we have never had before and thought it would be interesting to try something new along with this new place. The taste of the pizza was a bit odd, probably because the whole time I was eating this pizza I was thinking that meatballs can't belong on a pizza. But all in all the pizza was good, and I can't wait to come back here for another slice when I'm in the area.

Starting off on one of those nights, my three friends Jerry J., Matt B. and Gracie C. and I hit this place up last night (6/29/11) after we all got off of work. The plan - get dinner and bring it back to Gracie's place at the Veer Towers to play pool. 

After a short little walk from Caesar's, Gracie and I walked right on over  - it's right by the pool table on the third story. Jerry offered to buy dinner - buying a whole pizza is definitely the way to go at this joint - $18 for a huge cheese pizza and an extra ridiculous $2.25 per topping. We opted for 1/2 cheese, 1/2 pepperoni which came with 12 slices for $20 plus some change. It's so much cheaper than buying by the slice, but you'd never know because there's no menu. 

We sat around for a bit until one of our coworkers showed up with some people while giving them a tour of the place. There definitely isn't enough seating here whatsoever. After about a 15-20 minute wait, we had our pizza. The four of us then made the trek to CVS to pick up some pop and water.

After our trek to CVS and battling the wind, we headed up to the 37th floor of the Veer Tower chow down on the pizza. It had been at least a good half hour since we got our pizza and it was still relatively hot when we opened the box

I've definitely had better pizza. Metro, for one, is super delicious and this doesn't hold a candle to Round Table. Yes, going to a ""secret"" pizza place might be ""cool"" but their pizza is not even remotely close to the ""I'm a fan"" 4 stars or ""As good as it gets"" 5 stars that so many people are giving this place. Novel concept but again, the pizza is meh. The crust is hard. Not chewy, not crispy, but break your teeth hard. That automatically disqualifies it from getting higher than a 3 star. The cheese was okay, but again, not the best any of us had ever had. We all agreed there was definitely better pizza in Vegas.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,0,3,0ARkD2OtmTSHv6_vUIj7Ng

I like the old school aesthetic with the pinball machine and arcade games and the staff is extremely friendly. Pizza is handmade and they reheat it in their furnace when you order. You can request your pizza to be extra crispy too.

For being in the Cosmo, if you want something quick and good, yeah I could see its high rating, but I wasn't five star amazed. Upon first bite the pizza was chewy, the sauce was the right amount of tang, and I do have to admit that it is one of the best pizzas by the slice in Las Vegas ...but that was upon first bite. After those first couple of bites, the bread and crust was burnt and charred.

 I tried three slices: regular cheese, ricotta cheese, and cheese with beef slices (not sausage, some other type of beef). The regular cheese was greasy enough for me to use up the entire napkin dispenser and the crust was crispy black at the ottom so 1 out of 10. The ricotta cheese was a 10/10, if all the slices were this good I would definitely give this place a better rating. The beef slice was good, kind of what you would expect so 6 out of 10. The employees were nice, it was cheap, and like a lot of other people I'm a fan of its location, album decked hallway and close proximity to the pool table and dominoes board but the pizza really was just a little off.

So my friends and I were standing there debating which flavor toppings to get... then suddenly, we heard a loud pop. We soon found out that someone in the kitchen knocked down a bottle of Coke and caused it to explode everywhere (with the bottle hitting the ceiling and cap flying our way). If we only stepped one feet closer to the register, at least one of us could've been hit with the bottle cap (and maybe in the eye too!) Fortunately, our indecisive personalities saved us from harm.

1) Hard to find! I know I know it's in the name... But when you are hungry and tired at 12am you just want to find the damn place for some food... Eventually figured out where it was after asking hotel staffs and asking random people where they got their piece of pizza. 
2) Long line! We waited 1.5hrs in line to get 1-2 slices of pizza. Um... the pizza was not worth that wait... esp at 12am when you're hungry. By the time we got our food and started eating it was 1:30am!!! 
3) Price! It's around $5/slice of pizza... Just decent pizza... Not worth it! We can get a whole pan of pizza at Costco for ~$10...

We came here with Stephen's mom and each got a slice of something different. We wanted 3 diet cokes, and the guy suggested getting a 2-liter of diet coke for $6.50 versus 3 separate cup of cokes for $4 each.  Wow, what a nice guy!  He could have easily had a $12 sale on drinks, but saved us $5.50.

You can get pizza by the slice or wait for an entire pie. They continually crank out the pizzas here. The meatball and pepperoni is one of my favorites. Their sauce is delicious and the crust is thin. This is the type of pizza that you definitely have to fold in half to eat. There will be grease, but true New York pizza is also greasy. The meatball is so flavorful and fantastic. I do find the pepperoni to be a bit too spicy for my taste, but I like that it is not the generic circular pepperoni.

I was worried about even finding this place since it's supposed to be a ""secret"" but all the restaurants mainly being on the 3rd floor give it away a bit.  You'll find the secret pizza shop down a long hallway lined with album covers.  It's a very cool concept really!  Hide the cheapest option in Vegas so you feel like you've ""hit the jackpot"" when you score a New York style slice for $3.50!

I was a bit confused by the menu.  Well, it's not even a menu, it's a sign that says slice of pizza $3.50 and whole pizza XX amount (sorry, can't remember the whole pizza amount).  Since a lot of the business I suspected was by the slice, my idea was you can add on toppings and they'll ""bake"" (reheat) it on the spot.  Not the case...

There's around 4 or 5 pizza's sitting out that you choose from.  Better hope you like what's sitting out, because that's your only option by the slice.  I love mushrooms, so I wanted a cheese and mushroom pizza.  No luck for Rachel.  

I instead ordered the white pizza with tomato and spinach and I thought they'd pop it into the stove for a couple seconds to heat it up.  No such luck.  It's served to you right then and there.  I think that's why it came out a little dry and underwhelming for me.  It wasn't ""right out of the oven"" but out of the oven a couple minutes/a while later...And that really made me not a fan.  But I really think I would have thought differently about it had it been right out of the oven.  So order the whole pie and do it the right way!",4wp4XI9AxKNqJima-xahlg,4,1,2,kakUIxEf0ieNF4y2ZCHXkA

5752984,2011-11-15,3,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"For a group of 4 people (or 2 really hungry people), ordering a whole pie was the way to go. For 2 toppings of pepperoni and mushroom, the total came out to $24 for 8 slices. It's a relative bargain compared to ordering by the slice, which can be up to $5 depending on how many toppings you want. 

Everything was just as good as before, except for the soggy middle. Since a whole pizza was made fresh to order, all the cheese and grease gravitated towards the center. Plus all the cheese and toppings just slid right off the mushy crust. It probably could've used a few more minutes in the oven to develop a better crust in the middle. But it was still damn GOOD, and burned the top roof of my mouth way too many times.

If you order per slice, they'll throw it back in the oven to reheat, so you won't have the soggy-crust-in-the-middle problem. So it all depends on your preference. Personally, I like thin and crispy crust versus the soggy version. I've been here well over 6+ times, and it seems like the prices just keep creeping up.

I love getting a slice and sitting in the lounge area in front of the restaurant. The cool Mad Men furniture, the pool table, as well as the great people watching make this a great space to eat amazing pizza.  Secret pizza is sorrounded by several shi shi restaurants, as well as a cool art gallery, so there's plenty to check out.

John, the 20-something estranged culinary chef protege-dropout, came into the final meeting for the architect's last proposal on the hotel to borrow some cash from his father, Jeff.  Jeff was following the pitch quite well from the design firm, but was starting to drift off.

The architect continued, ""We can probably put a bathroom in here, but it won't be very big.  I propose that we just scrap--""

An idea hit the little hipster like a flash of lightning.

""Dad,"" John interrupted.  ""I want a pizza kitchen in there.""

Jeff: ""Sorry.  But you've never owned a restaurant.  You'll fail.  There's hardly any room.  We can't afford any more signage to get people in there.""

""Dad,"" John repeated with a confidence his father had never heard before, ""I want a pizza kitchen in there.  I'll run it.  It will succeed.  It needs nothing but my skill.""

""Oooookay, John.  If you say so.""

And Secret Pizza was born.

So we're sitting at a party and it's been a while since I was in the Vegas area and a friend of mine says, ""Have you had Secret Pizza?""

And I was instantly intrigued.  ""Huh?""  An hour later, we came up an escalator and found (though no sign, rhyme, or reason pointed to it) a dimly lit hallway.

To my surprise, sure enough, I am greeted with a ""Welcome!"" Welcome to what?  Where am I?  How did the pinball machine get here? How come the arcade machine is broken?  Are we seriously watching the Clippers?  How come I'm asking myself so many questions?

And so we order a pie from the New York accented worker and 20+ minutes later I'm chewing down on the best pizza I've ever had.  I've been to New York.  I've been to Italy.  It could have been the surreal nature of the place's existence, the hype that goes with it, the excitement of finding a hidden treasure - but it was.  the best.  pizza.

I know it's Vegas, but you can get a slice twice the size for $3-4 in New York City a.k.a. The mecca of pizza. They also didn't have much variety this time.  I had a sliced sausage and pepperoni pizza which skimped on the sauce and the crust was too chewy.    

We waited about 30 minutes in the line which we didn't mind so much, but it's kind of a letdown when you're overcharged and don't feel completely satisfied at the end. It's still decent drunk food, but I would never consider going there in any other circumstance. 

Being from Texas, I didn't really understand the whole ""No Ranch"" thing.  It's just ranch dressing.  Its not that expensive, you could probably charge a small amount for it and still profit and make tons more customers happy (This is for all of us in TX and the Midwest who require ranch dressing).

That seems to be a little steep even for vegas standards.  I would only eat at this place again if I was staying at the cosmo and woke up in the middle of the night starving.

5837411,2012-06-05,8,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"For months I have wanted to sample the pizza inside the not so secret back room at The Cosmopolitan, but just never got around to it before now.  But once Tropfest ended, the planets finally aligned, and Diane and I quickly left the Boulevard Pool via escalator and easily found our way to this highly touted haven of late-night pizza at last.  The line to order was fairly long even after 1:00 a.m. on a Monday.    And, I quickly learned that if pizza slices rather than a full pie are sought, what you are able to get totally depends on what comes out of the pizza ovens just before one's order is placed.  

But luck was with us on this visit, for we were able to buy fresh hot slices of pepperoni, sausage, and cheese pizza, plus commandeer two adjoining seats at the counter to be able to eat while sitting down.  Although I might have preferred slices of pepperoni & mushroom pizza, no such combination was available when I reached the head of the line.  But getting to try three out of four flavors is pretty good!

I was really pleased with this pizza.  My expectations were high going in, but they were exceeded.  The crust was nice and buttery, with no char on the bottom.  While the wide slices were relatively thin, they were not noticeably so, and the nicely finished crust was chewy, resilient, and foldable.  All slices were just saucy enough, and really cheesy and tasty.  Pepperoni was lightly spicy, and sausage was very mild, just as pizza maker Luigi had indicated when I asked him on my way through the line.  A small amount of grease was present, but to me that was a good thing for this New York style pizza.  Even though they had come out of the oven just a few minutes before I reached the cash register, each slice was given a little more fire before they were handed to me.  So they were hot and gooey, and a true treat to consume whether drunk or sober.  For, I loved this pizza, and unlike many other guests, had only water to drink all night.  In fact, the Secret Pizza establishment graciously offers free cold water out of a dispenser, with plastic cups and utensils provided as well.  

Besides probably being the cheapest meal available inside a Strip hotel, IMHO the Secret Pizza likely serves the best pizza on The Strip, and is neck and neck with Biaggio's and Metro Pizza, and just a shade behind Dom DeMarco's, for the best pizza served in the entire Las Vegas valley.

They call it Secret Pizza because it's intended to be hidden with no signage.

I found out about this place through my friend when we were looking for a pre-clubbing-at-Marquee meal. It's pretty simple - there are meat and vegetarian options. No, it's not the best pizza in the world, but where else can you get a slice of pizza for ~$5 between the hours of 2 to 5 AM after a night out? Like I said - it comes in clutch at any time. Drunk or sober, Secret Pizza is awesome. The line can get pretty bad, but it moves pretty quickly. It's not really a sit-down place, so you order, pay, and wait for your pizza to warm up in the oven. 

Go to the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan and head towards the back. Once you see a walkway into the wall to the left of the elevator and in front of the pool tables, you have made it to Secret Pizza.

So the next visit to the Cosmopolitan, I had to find the pizza. I asked an employee and he looked around, replied in a whisper to tell us how to get there.

It really was a secret. How would anyone know to go down an unmarked hallway? The hallway is pretty sweet-it's lined with pictures of old album covers. The actual pizza joint is pretty small with only a few barstools and counter space but it works because really, how long does it take to eat a slice or two before you're off to gamble again? 

The customer service was great, prices are reasonable and they even have Galaga to play. If you don't know what Galaga is, you probably weren't born during the time it was popular. Anyway, the pizza itself was good but nothing to write home about.

You can order pizza by the box (your choice for toppings) or by slice (depends on what they have made). There are two kinds of pizza--thin slice or thick slice. I ordered 3 slices (don't judge...): a thin slice of peperoni, a thick slice of peperoni, and a thick slice of veggie w/ ricotta. To be honest I could barely finish one slice...the generous size of the slice and amount of cheese and toppings makes the pizza extremely filling, I only ordered this many slices because I was starving after dayclubbing for hours at marquee XD I prefer the thin slices, actually, because I feel like the thick slices are waaaaayyy too much and even though it's delicious, it made me feel a little gross afterwards.

And this unassuming and ""hidden"" pizzeria, which is not even what their name is (according to the man I spoke to behind the counter) is located in the newest luxury casino to opened in Las Vegas.  It is on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, across from the escalator and located next to Blue Ribbon Sushi.  There are no signs indicating that there is anything down the short hallway adorned with album covers, besides of course the pinball machine and flat screen televisions mounted on the wall clearly visible to anyone who bothered to look in.  But instead of finding a hidden alcove of arcade games, you will find a counter where you can order your pizza by the slice or by the whole pie, and work space where they prepare the NY-style pizzas from scratch.

Prices are reasonable.  Slices starts at $3 per slice (plain cheese), $3.50 (one-topping), $4 (two toppings combo), and for $6 (you get a slice of plain cheese pizza and domestic draft beer).

18"" Pizza by the pie: $17 (Cheese), $18 (White Pizza - Ricotta & Mozzarella Cheese), $22 (three-toppings), or $25 (five-toppings).

Available Toppings (in alphabetical): Black Olives, Extra Cheese, Fresh Garlic, Green Peppers, Meatballs, Mushrooms, Onions, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Roasted Tomatoes, Sliced Sausage, Spinach, White Anchovies.

Beverages: Coca-Cola Brand fountain drinks, beer and wine (domestic and premium draft), Illy Coffee.  The cup of soda is pretty small, but you can ask for refills. :D

Desserts: New York Cheesecake Slice and Cannoli.

Also if you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and too busy/lazy/important/lost :p to make your way to the ""Pizzeria"", you can ring up the hotel to have someone deliver your pizza order.

BTW, the concept of selling pizzas by the slice has been around for a long time, just ask any UCB students, but to implement this concept inside a mega luxury casino is as Misti (LV Yelp CM) stated, ""genius""!

Secret pizza located in the Cosmopolitan hotel in vegas is truly one of those awesome places you wish existed everywhere else in the world. Simple and good food, quick, friendly service, and open from 10am - 5am (for those midnight pizza cravings!). The pizzas are hot and cheesy and crispy! Pretty much exactly how I like them. 

Prices are reasonable, about $5 or so a slice. You walk up and see what they have to offer, choose your slices, and they pop it in the oven to heat it and crisp it up for you. The meatball ricotta pizza they had was ridiculously yummy - dollops of ricotta mixture, yummy meatball. Mmm. It's a thin NY style pizza I'd say, but they sometimes also have these fluffy deep dish offerings that pretty much taste like huge crispy cheesy garlic breads. Very yummy! 

They also make a pretty mean cannoli and the guys there are super welcoming and friendly. Ooh, and free filtered water!! Gotta love that. Love it here! It's a must eat in vegas for sure :)",8JMoHnP6YR8iM8Ik2xODbw,4,2,5,kVtu9fL60NOCqMVZjef2rQ

Sauce is BOSS- just enough tomato flavor to let you know it's there. And toppings (we had the 3 meat- pepperoni, sausage and meatball) were real sliced meat, not those crappy crumbles you get at some pizza places. After eating one slice, I was asking for a friend to handle the rest. So don't think you will need several slices to get your fill.

Ok, the taste and quality of ingredients would earn this place a 5 star rating with me, but I could only give them 4 stars because there is absolutely no space remotely close to enjoy eating the pizza. I wanted so badly to get that first bite in, and it took forever to find a spot ( down the escalator twice and a random seat in the casino at Cosmopolitan) to eat my pizza. I was so uncomfortable trying to hold my plate and napkins in one hand while folding one slice to eat with the other hand. So my suggestion is to scope out a spot to eat your pizza before you get in line. A pizza this good should be enjoyed immediately and in a comfortable environment. Lastly, I feel their menu is a little overpriced. A whopping $6.25 for a slice with 3 toppings, $4 for a single soda, and $8.00 for a 2 liter of soda, but the good thing is that tax was included.",PI0AJGt93MprMH6Myq7RNA,0,0,4,-6_07rxWSIieAK5xWHhAog

We ordered a white pizza and a 1/2mushroom&sausage and 1/2 pepperoni pizza. I gotta say, I prefer the white pizza better. For some reason, the white pizza had a lot more flavors than the sausage. Maybe the meat was too over powering for the thin crust. The ricotta on the white pizza was so smooth and ""FATTY"". When we held the pizza vertically, the fat was literally dripping!

The dough was too chewy for my taste. It was a little bite rubbery, which I don't think it's suppose to be like that for a true NY style pizza. The wait for the pizza was also way too long. We wait around 30 minutes for the pizza..... which is way too long to wait for any food.

We selected a cheese slice topped with ricotta and sliced sausage and a cheese slice with meatballs and onions. I thought it was a little pricey for two slices with two toppings each.

The crispy crust was slightly charred, adding a touch of bitterness to the sweetness of the crust and savoriness of the topping. Loved. Every. Bite. The toppings were really good.

This place definitely lives up to its cool, speakeasy, ""only know if you know"" vibe.

When we found it, a casual counter-style restaurant awaited. Fair warning, this place is very small so if it's late night and crowded, be prepared to take your pizza to go and eat out in the Cosmo's lobby area. I ordered the special of the night--- a sausage and ricotta slice-- which totaled to $5 (STEAL ON THE STRIP).

We got lucky as far as timing goes because the line quickly picked up after we got there. I ordered a cheese slice and it was delicious hot and fresh.
The only complaint I had was the wait time. It was pretty long considering that almost everyone was ordering pizza I would have expected to move swiftly. Hey, I got my slice and that's what counts.",LWdALOgcuFvEVR23b-Snhg,0,0,4,ggo5Gm76rPvWFx_9QVpQQQ

I ordered the sausage, pepperoni, and bell pepper pizza. The sausages were amazing; they weren't the typical types that you encounter at many pizza joints. I liked the sauce and the crust.

Friendly folks behind the counter, too.

Fast (if you're just buying by the slice, not if you're ordering a whole pie), decently priced (for Vegas standards) and pretty tasty.

Go with the white slice.  I thought it was white sauce (cream) but it was actually no red sauce, cheese, ricotta. Pretty good. I liked being able to add stuff to it (additional 50 cents per topping) but I wish they had some bacon. Better than the traditional pepperoni w/ red sauce that's for sure. And yea, it's thin crust and ultra greasy. If you're going to complain about grease, don't bother eating pizza. Do the world a favor and eat a damn salad with no dressing okay? 

I don't get why people order an entire pie and then whine and moan that it takes up to an hour. IT'S A FREAKING ENTIRE PIZZA IT'S NOT GOING TO BE READY IN 5 MINUTES PEOPLE. USE YOUR BRAIN.",D2epirooWNjvwTI6MFhNGw,9,7,4,0QfUUXuV_5GeazF2OVA06w

So ... we tried it anyway. Got the white slice for $5.50 each. It's pretty good. But the slices are small.

And it gets worse. They won't serve cups of water. Despite a sink right there. And cups stacked up. And they were rude about it. Bumps this down from 2 stars to 1. Who doesn't serve water? McDonald's does. 5 star steakhouses do. But not ""secret pizza."" Beyond lame.",HXVFz5t6C3VA9IIRi-jn2g,0,0,1,SFoQhXcWehsVSL-Ul2TgZA
5990439,2011-08-05,8,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"My friends and I will forever thank Yelp for helping us discover this small pizza shop hidden in the upscale hotel of The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas! New York style pizzza in Vegas, what more could you ask for?

The pizza is executed and prepared so well at Pizzeria. The ingredients are simple but individually are bold in flavors. I got to try most, if not all the ready-made pizzas and toppings they had to offer.

The first pizzas I tried were the pepperoni pizza and the plain cheese pizza. The large slices of pepperoni were perfectly salty and balanced well with the tomato sauce, cheese, and crust. The cheese pizza was rich and flavorful, but I thought it could have used a little more cheese.

The second time I came, which was the next day, I ordered the Ricotta cheese pizza and the  Pepperoncini (banana pepper) and Sausage pizza. Absolutely delicious, they nailed it when it comes to flavor combinations. The mild sourness from the pepper helped breakdown the saltiness from the cheese and just complimented the sausage real well. As for the ricotta cheese, it was creamy and rich which added flavor to every bite. Here's how I rate the pizzas:

Pepperoni & Cheese - 4/5
Cheese Pizza - 3.5/5
Pepperoncini & Sausage - 5/5
Ricotta Cheese Pizza - 4.5/5 

After trying the pizza, I told a few of my friends and they went to try it for themselves and fell in love the same way I did. A lot of pizza joints can't do that nowadays! My only critique would have to be that the pizza was a little bit on the greasy side, but in my opinion, some pizza are just made to be greasy -- it helps add flavor!   

If I could give one advice to the owner, it would to change the name to  Luigi's Pizzeria in order to reflect its more Italian roots! Also, they should have more signs because I had to ask twice from different employees at the hotel where to find the 'hidden' pizza place.",vOVR7p0L41MpXblkb34nuQ,11,12,5,uUf2-YizMEpXH1b0s7B-5w
5990507,2014-03-22,0,iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,"Inside The Cosmopolitan at a 'secret' location, there are no visible signs pointing you to Secret Pizza. However, just look for a line of people that'll lead you up to a counter filled with meaty pizza pies to take away.

They bake pizzas with various toppings - sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, bell peppers, etc. or just plain cheese. You can take slices or request a whole pie with your choice of toppings. You can also add toppings to an existing pre-made pizza, and they'll pop the slice back into the oven for a couple of minutes. 

My friends and I opted for the mushroom and pepperoni pizza, with sausage added on and warmed up in the oven. The pizza was tasty, but i think it would have tasted much better had the sausage been an original topping and cooked from the beginning. it didn't have any smokey flavor that I had hoped for.

I mean, this is a decent place to grab a 'quick' bite, if you'll call it that. We waited around 15 minutes to order and then another 5 minutes to get the warmed-up slices. I've honestly had better. Or perhaps my expectations were just too high.",8rR5Bb5KOAfOqYiO9m5zyQ,0,0,3,jn7x0wCK8IErUZIvj_WNXA
