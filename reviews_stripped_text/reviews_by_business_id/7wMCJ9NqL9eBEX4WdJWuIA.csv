34885,2011-06-03,0,7wMCJ9NqL9eBEX4WdJWuIA,"My husband and I were starving and keen for a decent steak. We assumed we'd get one here. We ordered the outback special (sirloin) and the prime rib steaks. I asked for mine to be medium, and the waiter immediately asked whether I was sure, because it would be ""a bit red"" in the middle. (Would he have done the same thing if my husband had ordered first?)

I wanted my steak pink (i.e. ""medium""!), not red, so I changed it to medium-well instead. It came out really dry and overcooked (100% brown)... it was even overcooked for well done. I've had this exact thing happen before at another Outback in a different city, and that time I sent it back (the waiter agreed that it was way overcooked) but this time we were so hungry and we wanted to get out of there and do other things rather than wait for another steak so we didn't complain. But seriously, shouldn't a steak house at least be able to cook steak properly?

Another strange thing was that the two soups on offer weren't Australian at all - not a big deal but I'm not sure why an Australian-themed restaurant couldn't have at least one soup on offer that is actually consumed in Australia.

Overall, it wasn't completely terrible... husband's prime rib was a perfect medium, as he requested, the service was acceptable, and they allowed us to move to another table overlooking the strip when it became available... but I'm sure you could get a much better steakhouse experience elsewhere in Vegas.",C0QGlz45SwXrbQk0_b9_ZA,0,0,2,RUiCOlePjafCGgY0lGchig

302020,2013-06-12,0,7wMCJ9NqL9eBEX4WdJWuIA,"While there are plenty of very expensive ""real"" steak houses available on the Las Vegas Strip, I find that Outback generally provides a good value and a comfortable expectation.  This location is the one with the entrance at the top of the ""Coke bottle"" elevator shaft down near the MGM Grand where we stayed.  Be warned, the prices are a lot higher than you are used to if you eat at Outbacks at home.  However, it is still a lot cheaper than other steak option on the strip, so capitalism runs it's course.
Overall, it was decent.  the food was good and well prepared, though the service was only so-so.  Now, that can certainly vary depending on your server, so you may have better luck.
For my trip, it was a short walk north from the MGM Grand, so it was quite attractive compared to other steak options.
If you are on the south end of the Strip and craving a decent steak dinner, this Outback is worth paying a visit.  
Now, I can't close without mentioning that there is another one on the strip, further north inside the Casino Royale, across the street from the Mirage.  Overall, our experience there was better and we ate their earlier in our trip before a show closer to that location.  If you are located closer to the center of the strip, I would definitely recommend that one first.  If you are on the south end as we were, I don't know if it would be worth the extra walk unless you had other reasons to go that far.",CJTBh-5_Hu9qGGAmrX13tQ,0,1,3,QJiRQFarLoDZWMvSRXJmHA

I had the Melbourne and i got the 32 oz version. I guess the 32 oz steak is only in Vegas cause it's 20 oz where i live. The steak was juicy and not dry at all.

1059152,2012-09-11,0,7wMCJ9NqL9eBEX4WdJWuIA,"Food: Of all the restaurants I have gone to that served bread while we waited for our entrees, Outback's bread is the best (slightly above Cheesecake Factory)! For my entree, I had the grilled shrimp Caesar salad. The dressing was lightly tossed into the salad, which made me happy because a lot of restaurants douse their salad with dressing. The salad was enjoyable and was the right portion, but not something I'd return to order again. I loved the croutons in it though. My husband had the Porterhouse steak. I'm not a fan of steak, but this one was very nicely seasoned and prepared well. It even made me think perhaps I should have ordered a steak! We also had the blackberry sangria which was nicely sweetened and refreshing, but the husband thought it was too sweet.

Atmosphere: Same as all the other Outback Steakhouses. It is pretty popular. When we left at 9, I still saw people coming in.

Service: We ate here on a Monday night. We got there around 730 and were seated at 8. Our server at the bar was extremely helpful and attentive. Even though I was waiting for our table, she offered to get me a glass of water. Our table server was quick, and she also let me have more bread after I finished it. Two issues I had about the server though was: (1) I asked for my salad to have dressing on the side. It arrived already tossed into the salad. (2) We had dinner with a colleague and asked to split the check. She did, but she put the colleague's drink on my and my husband's check. (I thought it would be common sense to put the drink on there too and I won't have to specifically tell her what should be on each check.) Overall, I had a good dinner and she was helpful when I asked for a takeout bag, so I let it go, but I'm still a little annoyed about those two points. :) 

Other: My napkin smelled moldy. Thank goodness it was black. If it was white, I think it would have looked horrendous.

Bottom Line: The experience at this Las Vegas location is no different from eating at any other Outback Steakhouse. What stood out to me that evening were the double servings of bread, the sangria, the steak, and the croutons in my salad.",iMhVuRE1QSGBFtOtE1L-jQ,0,0,4,kKcJmhmcl-NyvDIlIgO07g

It was my mom, my boyfriend, and I dining tonight, and both my boyfriend and I work at a different Outback in California. Right away we noticed the place was very clean and decorated much nicer than ours, however the menu was much more condensed and more expensive. That's all part of Vegas though so we looked past it. Unfortunately though, my mom's steak was over cooked. The waiter was decent on checking with us but not amazing. They did take the steak back and it came out in an ok time frame. However, the manager, Josh, brought it out and did not introduce himself or apologize. The new steak was fine, and the rest of our food was all good as well. As we work at another location, we get an employee discount which they honored though had some trouble so Josh came to our table again, and we did let him know we were disappointed with his lack of hospitality. We were not looking to have anything comped off of our bill but typically a manager will offer that or a dessert so we let him know it seemed unprofessional. He then offered a cheesecake (though we declined..simply hope he can improve for future patrons.)

If you want a really good steak without all the pomp and circumstance, this particular outback is the place. 

Not sure why but they have a chopped walnut blue cheese salad that other outbacks don't have on the menu and their filet is especially good, much better than your common outback. I wonder if they get their meat from the same place that the casino's get theirs... 

I usually stop in at least once for an 11 oz rare filet, chopped walnut blue cheese salad and a side of fresh green beans when I am in town and not interested in paying the outrageous prices at the casinos. ;-)",NuS-xgXvI_pvkhdLV93o9Q,1,0,4,U1fhv81EJSwrlglqVDw2Pw

I learned on this trip that while he's adventurous in deciding just a day before to take a trip to Vegas, he's not the same when it comes to dining out. He could eat at Denny's every time you ask him where he wants to go. I wasn't surprised that he picked an Outback Steakhouse for lunch (chain places being his ""thing""). We hadn't meant to end up here, but we did. 

We were seated quickly and a tall young man with blond hair was our server. At first, we thought he was friendly and really good at customer service. He struck up a conversation with us and asked us lots of questions we thought were just him making small talk (""Where are you guys from?"" ""What made you come to Vegas?"" ""What do you plan to do today?"" ""Where are you staying?"" etc). There wound up being a problem with my meal. On their menu, I didn't notice that the pasta I ordered came with green onions (I haaate onions--probably the grossest thing I can think of eating, honestly). 

Being that I'm a vegetarian, there wasn't much else I could choose from (aside from the calorie murder I could act out by eating their cheese fries, without  bacon). I know there's ""Steakhouse"" in the name, so why'd I come here? I'm still wondering about that. 

The manager took the $16 pasta away and replaced it with an onion free one. Then, when the bill came, we noticed we were only charged $2.95 for the dish. That was really good customer service on her part.

Now, here's where they lose two more stars (one for the food situation).. we went to the Bodies Exhibit at the Luxor hours later. We'd told the waiter about this earlier at lunch. Well, I noticed someone following us through the exhibit until we got to a part where they'd sectioned off brains. As I was leaning in to get a closer look I noticed the guy staring at me. My boyfriend pointed out it was the waiter from earlier that day. It was just  very strange and gave me the creeps. We'd given him the name of our hotel, told him where we were from, etc. And there he was. Just creepy.",VlKNRnmHXQ3rtQb3HPlVag,0,0,2,PTX3ps_kEII6VnHPXz2qAg

Then waiting on drinks at least half hour to hour to get the refills. Then we realize the steaks were minus the garlic butter sauce, and then my salmon had a tiny piece of bacon on it.. ughh. Then to top it off we get the adjusted bill it was still 91 dollars for what 2 hour wait and bad food. You call that adjusted um seriously. So I would strongly suggest think twice if your hungry. That makes both times we have been here for the terrible food and pay that.. so don't worry I don't plan on ever coming back. So thanks we see what they now.

I mean just next door their is Smith & Wollensky's and across the street is Mastro's Ocean Club not to mention Craftsteak and Striphouse all within a 5 iron shot of the place.  But what if you don't want to break the bank?  All of the aforementioned joints require most people to take a second mortgage out to afford.  Therein lies the beauty of Outback.  You can go in and get a delicious steak at a reasonable price (around 20 bucks) with decent sides and a casual atmosphere.

That's exactly how I found myself at this particular Outback the other night.  My cousin was in town and staying on the strip.  We wanted to get in touch with our carnivore roots but didn't want to have to sleep in our car as result.  Looking out from her room at the Monte Carlo, we spied Outback next to the giant Coke bottle and over-sized M & M (only in Las Vegas!).  We ambled across the strip and found the Outback to be tucked away adjacent to the Coke World shop and requiring an elevator ride to reach the host stand.  Once upstairs your removed from the hustle and bustle of the strip and can settle into a nice meal.  We were immediately seated even though the place was jumping and drink orders were taken promptly.  After perusing the menu I wasnt sure if this Outback was a little more expensive than others because of its location or if all of them how have raised their prices recently because I did notice the prices inching up higher than I last recalled.  They were still reasonable however and I ordered the Outback special which is a 12oz Sirloin and my cousin got the Prime Rib.  Both cuts were cooked right to order and the accompanying salad and potato were more than sufficient.  I loved that our waitress recognized my insatiable thirst of diet Coke and kept a steady stream of pops heading my way,  

There was a nice view overlooking the strip from the restaurant and while the space was loud we could have a conversation without any problems.  This Outback is the perfect choice for people visiting Vegas and wanting a good substantial meal without all the production of a fancy ""casino"" restaurant.  Plus it'll save you some bucks so you can eventually loose it on a slot machine later in the night....or on the Indianapolis Colts as was the case with me....",9qjLfaAqMxgfqdtTlPwRUQ,1,0,4,l-ZuTWY7dYCGBiPc5zk6kQ

When you arrive you have to follow the signs to the elevator (yes, inside the coke bottle), to ride up to the restaurant level.  You enter and greeted right away, we were told it would be a 30 minute wait, which for a place like this is not too bad, we decide to wait as we did not want to go any place else (knowing us we would walk for an 1 hour trying to decided where to eat).  We were waiting for a table for 2, which we figured it would be within the time frame allotted.

When we sat down the waiter was there almost at the same time to take our order for drinks, and since we had been outside all day, this was very welcoming to us.  We ordered our drinks (ice tea and root beer), the drinks where at our table within a few minutes which was great especially since we were thirsty.  The waiter asked us if we were ready to order our food, and we were as we do know the menu.  We order two steaks and bacon cheese fries (yummy).  We had plenty of time to take with each other and enjoy our evening out, including the waiting returning to our table to refill our drinks, we has small conversation with our waiter which made this experience very nice.  

When the food did come out of the kitchen, it was served well, the food was hot and the order was correct (cooked and delivered).  We of course did enjoy our meal as we had been waiting for dinner to save for our big meal, and as we just sat there relaxing the waiter did check up on us often, yes your staff does make the difference to a meal.  

As far as the location it was fun to look outside at the Las Vegas strip and people watch, plus the place was very clean (yes it was busy), the restrooms were clean and the wait staff was very friendly, without being over friendly.  Overall this location is great and if you are looking for a good meal, this would be a place for you to come to as the location sets this place apart.  We are not giving 5 stars as the hostesses were not friendly and the waiting room for a table was very small and you will have to move each time people arrive to get a table.  This would be a 4.5 star location.",PsQE8GI6ZybxZDUxOmrLSA,9,8,4,RciLrJ1TRDV6Kmyesnqcyw

We were seated quickly, granted it was a Sunday evening, however for a restaurant on the Strip I was impressed.  Of course we shared a fresh, hot blooming onion.  Call me crazy, but try it with Ketchup instead of the special sauce...my wife and friends are sold!  I ordered the New York Strip and it was amazing.  Perfectly seasoned and perfectly grilled.  My only negative critique is they rushed the appetizer/salad portion of the meal.  I felt like Kobiyashi trying to inhale my salad when my steak came out merely minutes after my salad, but that's ok.  My wife and her girlfriend shared the full rack of pork ribs, and I must admit they were delicious as well.

I had a filet mignon medium an it was perfect. The flavor was so good  no steak sauce needed. The salad an baked potato were also very good. Everyone else's food was cooked perfectly an very good as well. The customer service was spot on.

Joshua seemed to have write us off immediately. We hadn't even ordered drinks and he already seemed to hate us. He was completely rude and unattentive throughout our meal. We all work in a restaraunt and were willing to understand that everyone has rough nights but then another one of his tables were seated right next to us and were quickly greeted with a smile and friendly conversation. To put it simply, we were confused. In the end, he didn't get the best tip and we concluded that he had discriminated against us because of our age range. He was too quick to assume that we were just young kids drunk in Vegas. We knew we were right when we saw the surprise and regret on his face when we informed him that we all work at Outback.

I know the Vegas Strip boasts some of the finest, swankiest, trendiest restaurants in the city. In my honest opinion, they fail in comparison to the meal, service, and camaraderie we had here. 
The restaurant is located on the MGM block nestled just above the strip in the CocaCola world building. There is elevator access up and back down. We were seated near the window, allowing for a perfect view of Las Vegas Blvd. the view was as entertaining as the meal was delicious.  
I had the Alice Springs chicken that was cooked to a buttery melt in your mouth level of perfection. It was tender and juicy, full of flavor and topped with cheese and mushroom. I opted for the baked potato as my side, it was not as good as the chicken but still delicious. My dinner companions each had the 14oz ribeye. I'm told, well I know, I snuck a piece, the steaks where cooked in butter searing in added flavor. They were thick, juicy, and seasoned to perfection. They were tender and packed with flavor. They opted for the lump CrabCake add on, this too, was magnificent. The crabcake was flaky and moist allowing full flavor. 
Our server, Dave, was one of the kindest souls I've ever encountered. Our cups were never empty, we were checked on in a manner that allowed for privacy but still making sure our needs were met.

Tonight, we had the best experience at a restaurant ever. From the server, Robert, to the manager Brian/Bryan, they absolutely knocked it out of the park. 

To start, Robert was very kind upon greeting us - he had a great upbeat attitude. After going over beer options with us (Robert, great job on describing the beers), we had our salads within minutes. Shortly after, he checked in to ensure everything was okay. To follow-up that, he let us know an approximate ETA of those sweet, delicious steaks. 

Food was killer! Great job to the cooks in the back. My girlfriend and I are in food coma's. Steak were juicy, bloody, and just the way we wanted. 

Shortly after our meal, Bryan/Brian the manager, came to check in on us to ensure everything was satisfactory. We informed him how great our experience with Robert was, and he seemed incredibly appreciative of the kind feedback. He chatted with us, asking where we were from and showed a genuine interest in us. After, he wished us a happy holidays and to take care. 

I'm sure I've been rambling on for a while, but the crew here deserves high praises. It felt extremely home-ey, we felt welcomed, and we felt valued as a customer.

We were better off going to a fast food with the service provided.",G9kgWg4gIw_77PioVQWpKw,1,1,2,6FCnidaN5n-lJwKAmpo6YA

The only reason I came here is because I had been eating at luxurious restaurants all thru my stay in LV, so decided to try something less expensive. It was somewhat busy but didn't have to wait! The waiter was awesome,  joked around with us and was attentive. Don't quite remember his name, but if you read this you will remember us, ""with a side of Roy Rodgers"" hahaha... Everything was good, but the 3 stars is due to the quality of food. It was not tasteful.  I had to keep putting salt and a lot of A1 sauce because it was just not that good, yet, I had been having top of the line steak all weekend at Vegas' higher end restaurants, so I can't expect Outback to be magical.  Either way, I have eaten at other Outbacks and have been way better experiences with regards to food. Gotta raise that bar up!",eLp_Vr7F5PB2nTgmCyzcuA,0,1,3,Kr0NTqZqOaqgnW6zele7RQ

My steak was over cooked. But my potato soup was amazing. Chad also made me 2 excellent drinks.",zWF45ea71bbJUCSfr7gotQ,0,0,2,ZqUPJiosljKDYBLpEQuJIg

As soon as we walked in the hostess greeted us with a smile and was very nice. Our waitress for the evening was Lorena. She was great! She knew a lot about the menu and recommended great cocktails and appetizers. Very friendly and helpful. I did however order a ribeye that was a little under cooked for my liking but Lorena was great and got a new one out for me as fast as possible. She made sure everyone was happy and treated us like a couple of regulars. If the waitstaff is like her im sure business is booming! Definitely coming back before we head home!!!!",MTVW7yxNYmh1yrru9_5NyQ,0,0,5,g2w03FCvPlB4Q-RMZTbYyA

Our server Helena was good though, over worked & very busy, but she friendly & efficient.",WBaMDqyxGoKtqeVyh4SmHQ,2,0,2,EwY1L-hzEgU78PPRjfsWiA
5929180,2017-11-06,0,7wMCJ9NqL9eBEX4WdJWuIA,My family and I were in Las Vegas over the weekend. We decided to eat at Outback Steakhouse for the first time. The food was good and the waiter was attentive. The only problem was the host was very rude to my children. As we were about to leave my boyfriend needed to go to the restroom. My kids ended up playing with a tablet that was in one of the tables . The host came in the meanest way and told them they shouldn't be playing with the tablet and took it away from them and she said that we needed to pay since they charge for games. I went to talk to the manager that I was willing to pay for whatever game they were playing but the manager said she took care of it already.,EoVw599aOpY_Zwk7GKkXlA,0,0,3,pN1UAVbA0KLr0yQ1wL2O2A

She was very attentive and suggested great menu items. The food was delicious as we had a little bit of everything. The bread & raspberry butter is to die for!!!  I'll definitely be back!",fPjOYRRJPzsCO9t3NEPrKQ,0,0,5,PUU5yvOYE0EdLmxb5w1wjg
