28530,2017-05-26,0,ypYuEglLHDHR1cyG305TwQ,Service was fast and straight forward. I've used Harper Valley on a few occasions and they have always provided reliable service. I would highly recommend them if you need your HVAC repaired or replaced at a reasonable price and done right.,DeAsG3iuhtJ61k1zPcP1Dw,2,0,5,iwuhS-W8KjSQ4tdwwXanhw
2495843,2016-07-05,1,ypYuEglLHDHR1cyG305TwQ,Thoroughly disappointed by the lack of professionalism provided by this company. I was given this company as a provider from my home warranty company. I called to schedule an appointment and was RUDELY given a time frame of 12:00pm to 5:00pm to come check out the unit. I later called to see if I could get a more definitive time frame since it is extremely hot and did not want to have to sit for 5 hours in the heat. The same individual was short with me and stated that there were several jobs ahead of me and he would get there when he could. About an hour and a half later I get an email fom the warranty company assigning me a new provider because Harper Valley was not able to complete the job. I find it impossible to complete a job when you make no attempt at completing the service call in the first place.   You should not accept jobs if you realistically cannot make it to them. If you have any experience in doing whatever your profession may be then you should be able to tell what kind of a work load your business can handle. I am shocked that a warranty company would select such a provider to come and service their clients. Never will I use this highly rude and unprofessional business!,E3zxbDGmK0H3D-oOQ4_m4A,1,0,1,4jOUiaVtRxeu3wNktDUrlQ

He was honest in his assessment and told me exactly what was wrong with my unit. I usually don't review much on yelp, but I was so impressed. I will recommend Harper Valley Air to all my friends and family.",LUWdxkvXKCKDPYLhZ1_6PA,1,0,5,q-w3GQDQ24QOryxCjW67uw

Craig called. 
Told me I was ""fucking crazy"" and should smoke a bowl. 

11 days later.
OHRP recalled them.
Haven't heard a word from them and I cant get them to answer me.",q6oMJ7Z7hfN6iVRdqrhDXA,1,0,1,3wVEzeh1ARPUkRkiQ69Q6Q
5433621,2017-01-10,0,ypYuEglLHDHR1cyG305TwQ,Guy quoted me 900 dollars to repair and maintenance my 2 a/c s. It's been over a month and has been out 4 times.  Still one is not working.  Called him again to see if he would come fix it but now wants more money.   I think he should fix it for the price he quoted.   Tried to give the small business owner a chance. Not sure he actually know what's wrong.  He offered to come out and remove parts and give me the money back to me. Then hung up on me. .
