The restaurant wasn't busy when we walked in, in fact there was only 1 table occupied. This probably should've been a clue. I wasn't impressed with the food nor the service. It took awhile for anyone to realize we were waiting to be seated. There were no servers nor was anyone standing in the front. A server walked out of the kitchen area toward us, didn't greet us, probably did a mental head count and told us to follow her. She plucked the menus on the table and walked off. 

I wasn't impressed with my chicken Cobb salad. It tasted bitter. Don't know why and couldn't figure it out. The chicken was dry and not seasoned. On the plus side it had lots of avocado and I love avocado. I ended up picking through my salad and eating only the avocado. My friend had the prime rib and it looked pretty sorry and very unappetizing. He said it had mostly gristle, and had no flavor even after dumping the sauce on it. Maybe we came here on an off day. We ended up not finishing our meal.

Our waitress didn't check on us or ask us how our meal was. Overall the meal was meh and the service was blah. I guess they'd rather have you in the casino gambling than eating. While we were walking out, my friends had finally pried themselves away from gambling to join us. Sorry you guys missed the boat but that's probably a good thing.

However my gripe is that when I asked for this cake I was given it along with a price tag $2 more than normal. But get this...for 1/2 the cake. When I call to explain and question, Newbie Thomas gives me the old ""frat guy"" way of ""aww sorry about that awww yeeeaaahhhh oh yeahhhh""! What the heck is that? I just paid for 2 cakes at nearly $5 a piece and for 1/2 of what is normally there and I get a ""ohhhh oops""?

2359600,2018-05-20,0,viHcW-LLmOxBMHFm0jxPvQ,"After a night of gambling, the BF and I decided to grab a bite to eat. Decided to come to the Grand Cafe as it was about 1ish in the morning and the oyster bar line was still out the door and not many food places open.

As you walk up to the entrance, you're immediately drawn to the desert case (okay? Maybe I'm immediately drawn to it, lol;p) filled with donuts, cup cakes, pies and more. We waited a few minutes and immediately seated at the bar. 

The hostess handed us the menu, 3 different ones to choose from; a late night menu, simple breakfast and burger options which were really inexpensive, a Chinese menu and their regular menu. The gentleman took our drink orders shortly after we sat down as we looked through the menu. 

The restaurant wasn't too busy but 10 minutes in, it started filling up and it looked like their were only 3-4 waiters trying to get everyone settled in. 

A few minutes later, our waitress comes over to see if we had questions and to take our order. I ordered the Rueben Sandwich, Garlic Parmesan Fries and a bow of chicken noodle soup. My BF orders the fish and chips. 

My soup comes out first, and it was actually pretty good. I loved the chunky noodles and veggies but What I loved most about this soup was that they actually had lots of shredded Chicken. I mean come on, I had lots of chicken noodle soup but no chicken, lol!! 

Our entrees come out and they looked both very delicious. My Reuben wasn't too bad. What I liked was that they weren't stingy with the meat, lots of meat, and the sauce was good but I wish I had more. The bread was toasted on the top side and when I picked it up, the bottom side was soggy. Bummer! Which then made it a little harder for me eat because every thing was falling apart. Garlic fries weren't bad, but have I had better ones...sure I have. 

My BF's basket came with 4 pieces of fish and about 6 pieces of fries shrimp. I tried a piece and the fish seemed a little mushy for me. He also wasn't too happy about it either and ended up having more of my sandwich. 

As we were eating our meals, a delivery guy comes in with two stacks of boxes as tall as him. My BF and I sat there wondering, hmmm, what are those boxes? So we start naming off a bunch of things we think it is...so when we went to pay at the counter they had them on the counter and my boyfriend looks. He turns and says, Carl's Donuts?? I'm like what? Huh? No? So I look, and low and behold Carl's Donuts from downtown, score! We ended up getting 2 donut twist, chocolate Popper and a cheese danish. 

Twist, good! Chocolate Popper, good! Cheese Danish didn't even give it a chance. By the time we got to try it, it was hard. I don't think the we got were the fresh ones. 

Overall, staff was friendly but they seemed a little short handed that night. As for the food, I think that there are certain things that I will not be ordering, however, I have been here before and I know they do have better tasting menu items, so I'll stick to the ones I like.",QzPiZuxz0ALsUxjs2vNSpw,0,0,2,75s096P8q_GCorRBg4UzQA

They also have a tasty bananas foster french toast for $7.99 and some pretty good st. louis style BBQ ribs for $13.99 full rack and $8.99 half rack.

A real nice and well decorative place. You can dine at the bar area and watch tv or dine at the stylish sit down table area with giant chandelier lights over your heads.  Prices and quality are ok.

I had the $9.99 kings cut of prime rib, it was a nice size one, and came with a side of veggies which wasn't cooked long enough, and mash potatoes and gravy which was ok, you have the choice of rice or bake or mash potato. 

Also like that they have kona coffee instead of regular coffee. Always get friendly and excellent service. Plus they're open 24/7.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,0,0,4,0lBBD12UD8jueC_fkqmFFg

It's inside the Casino and they have a individual seating bar that I remember like yesterday. They also have a keno girl that walks around to collect your bets (for ages 21 & older obviously) I used to watch my grandpa play all the time! I honestly wasn't expecting much. 

After eating here I must say I enjoyed the quality of my food better than some of the trendy breakfast spots around town.

Food 4 Stars - (I'll have to go again so I can give them another star)

I ordered the ham skillet. The quality of the Ham was the Real Deal Holyfield. It comes with 3 eggs any style. 
I ordered them over medium and they were on point like a Lazar. It also came with Sour Dough toast which was thick and fluffy and the Hash-browns were cooked just right.

2655794,2014-11-21,6,viHcW-LLmOxBMHFm0jxPvQ,"My sis had comps for the AYCE Grand Cafe (buffet) over at Palace Station.

We arrived a little after breakfast and just before lunch. I guess this is what those clever folks call..brunch. I'm not a frequent buffet person, but felt like this was the best time to show up; It seemed as if they had just transitioned from breakfast and had started lunch with plenty of fresh food being placed in the buffet area.

There were high's, and of course there were lows. The low's.. which I'll bang out right away were the pizza, hot dogs and chicken. All looked like food that has been sitting underneath a heat lamp for a full day. Cardboard like pizza, hot dogs are in water and the chicken was mixed.. good and bad pieces all in one tray. 

Aside from that, they had a nice selection of foods ranging from fresh salads, fresh fruits, burgers, egg rolls, dumplings, orange chicken, honey baked ham, turkey, sausage and so on. 

The highlights after digging through quite a bit of food had to be the honey baked ham (sweet, moist n' tender), sausage (juicy, salty and a little fatty), mashed potatoes (buttered, salted and smooth texture) stuffing (it was stuffing so..) and buttered corn. They have a chef right behind this counter ready to slice and dice you up some meat. 

The dessert area isn't necessarily my thing.. but they had bun cakes, bread pudding, chocolate brownies, cookies and more. I grabbed a simple soft serve vanilla cone which was a nice topper.

Although nothing was truly out of this world, for a buffet, this free meal filled me up and most of what I ate was fresh and had flavor.  Grand Cafe came through.",jbOJV077QCGzduE6zFYO_A,7,6,3,XjTvlRTI1EBLTreW5lRkzA
2714551,2017-03-30,0,viHcW-LLmOxBMHFm0jxPvQ,"I've been coming here for years, and have seen this place go through a lot of changes. So far, I think this is the best change I have seen. 

Let's first start when I walked in. On this particular visit, I noticed they were a bit short handed, based on the wait time I had for the hostess/cashier to formally greet us, as she had a line of customers that were paying for their meals. When she did finally had a minor break, she apologized for the wait and gave us a booth. 

The service level from the server was awesome. Lovely sense of humor, and quick on the draw. I ordered the hard hat sirloin steak special, which is an ongoing ""promotion"" for the current renovations Palace Station is undergoing. The potatoes were soft and flavorful, not too buttery. Steak was just right; juicy and flavorful, not too salty. 

What brought my review to five stars was the fact that the manager on duty stepped in and helped out the server, as well as the hostess because they were short handed. You don't see many MOD's do that nowadays and I thought that was pretty awesome of him to be out and about instead of locked up in his office. A good leader makes for an awesome crew. 

I definitely recommend this place if you are not looking for something fancy, but something to ""hold you over"" that is not fast food. Also, if you have a boarding pass (players card), you can earn points from your meal. FYI.",_GJlnd71wMgWA-n9lN4d8Q,0,0,5,Q8VfY_xEXWFUEm-PjVhJzA

They are doing some serious remodeling at Palace Station and everything feels more than a little crowded.  In appreciation of customers putting up with the inconvenience, the Grand Cafe has a number of Hard Hat Specials.  

I wasn't even planning on eating here, but the sign with the ""Hard Hat"" Specials caught my eye.  The ""Hard Hat"" Breakfast (2 eggs, 2pieces of Bacon, 2 Link Sausages, 2 Pancakes, and Hash Browns) was only $4.99 and it came with a Free Cup of Coffee.  Dang, I gots to get me some of that!

The hostess granted my request for a booth. A drink server appeared instantly and I ordered up a cup of joe.  I hate those little containers of ultra pasteurized cream so I put in a request for a little milk.  My coffee and a little pitcher of milk appeared moments later.  I was surprised how much I liked the coffee.  I really doubted I would.

I settled back in the booth and grabbed a Keno ticket and a crayon. But before I could mark it up, my waiter, Fernando, shows up with a big smile to take my order.  I ordered up the Hard Hat breakfast and a side of Toast.  

It didn't seem like the place was that busy, but my order took a long time.  I wasn't in any hurry to be anywhere, so it really didn't bother me.   I finished my coffee.  The drink server came by and filled me up.  Then again.  I was half was through the second refill when the food showed up.

I was really shocked.  It's served on an oversized metal platter that looks more like a garbage can lid than a plate you eat food from.  Looking at the picture just now I noticed it's actually some sort of faux ""skillet.""  At the time I didn't notice the comical little handle. 

Anyway, appearance wise, it was easily one of the least appealing restaurant breakfasts I've ever seen.  The poached eggs were in a rediculously oversized coffee cup.  The eggs were poorly drained and sitting in about a tablespoon of poaching liquid.  And one of the yolks was already broken.   The platter was so big all the other components of the meal seemed disconnected.  It was just an abominable presentation.

Taste wise, most everything was OK.  The big exception being the pancakes.  They looked beautiful but they were terrible.  They were so tough they were inedible.  Disappointing, but it didn't really matter, I had plenty of food in front of me. 

Although the food was just OK, the service was pretty good.  I spotted the manager walking towards me as I was waiting to pay and mentioned to him I enjoyed my visit.  His reaction to my compliment was similar to what you would expect from an embezzling bank teller being introduced to an auditor.   

I said, ""I just wanted to compliment your team on the wonderful customer service.""  His eyes darted left and right, only briefly meeting mine as he muttered a weak ""Thanks.""  It appeared as he couldn't get away fast enough.   It struck me as odd that he would be so unlike the personable people that work for him.   Weird, but who knows, the cat might be a great manager.

The food came out at the right time , we didn't over wait . 

Got our check , went to the front , the front lady RENE , had NO greeting towards us , especially when we first walked in No ""Hi welcome!"" No welcome greeting. What so ever ! She needs to be thought about what CUSTOMER SERVICE is .

4856723,2011-10-27,1,viHcW-LLmOxBMHFm0jxPvQ,"While I like a good bargain, I can be a bit of a food snob and am instantly skeptical when I am served a huge plate for under $8. That was my initial thinking when I sat down for breakfast at the Grand Cafe in Palace Station earlier this month, but I was glad to be proven wrong.

The food here goes beyond expectations given some might dismiss Palace Station as an off-strip ""budget resort"", and immediately deride its restaurants. But the breakfasts at the Grand Cafe are not only delicious, but will keep you stuffed until late afternoon.

I was instantly tempted by their ""stacks"" selection of five buttermilk pancakes that come in an assortment of flavors such as Maple Pecan, Banana Caramel, and Macadamia, Coconut and Banana for only $7.99. I eventually settled on their S'mores pancakes and was not disappointed. My dining partner tried their house specialty, Bananas Foster French Toast, which was equally priced at $7.99 and equally pleasing and gluttonous.

The cafe is open 24 hours a day and serves inexpensive meals that go a bit beyond what one might expect from standard cafe fare: a soup of the day served in a sourdough bread bowl, a Turkey Cobb Roll, BBQ Beef, and a selection of tantalizing desserts from their pastry case. Not wow wow wow amazing, but at least they're trying.

They also offer a number of deals such as a two-egg breakfast for $3.99, and daily lunch and dinner specials for under $8 including a Pot Roast Monday and Chicken Parmesan Thursday. Given the quality of their offerings and their value, I will definitely not shy away from these tasty bargains in the future.",DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,1,1,4,qTCruiUjEKSeKQwmv42wlw
4873223,2013-05-22,0,viHcW-LLmOxBMHFm0jxPvQ,"After reading reviews on Trip Advisor and Yelp, I almost passed on this restaurant (mostly because of numerous poor reviews on Yelp.  I'm very happy we decided to eat dinner here and don't know why those poor reviews exist.  The service was truly excellent and the food was certainly very good.  My wife had the open face hot turkey sandwich.  She said it was very good; the gravy was excellent.  I had the liver and onions.  Most places don't offer that, and I love it if done well, so I tried it.  The liver (all 3/4 lb of it) was cooked perfectly - done but not dry. There was a prodigious amount of sauteed onions atop the liver, again cooked perfectly with still some body to them.  The steamed vegetables were done correctly - slightly al dente.  The mashed potatoes were good, as was the mushroom gravy.  The only thing that would have made the liver better was if it were fried in bacon drippings instead of oil.  But, the two full slices of bacon on top were certainly sufficient.  During our two years of travel throughout the United States, we have discovered numerous restaurants that use far too much salt.  It was refreshing to find that I actually had to add just a little bit of salt to my dishes.  In all, this was quite the enjoyable dinner - and the prices are excellent.  Forget about the made-up poor reviews and try this place.  It's worth it.  Don't get me wrong; in Las Vegas, a true foodie city, there is nothing at Palace Station that one would consider a destination restaurant.  But, if you are nearby, or staying there, the Grand Cafe is a worthy spot to eat.",zSPqrCZksOPvU3zY1je5Jg,2,0,4,858fJQ_4fE2EMejmue0_Gw

The cheesecake pecan bar would have been the best one as the crust was good, the bar was sweet, salty and creamy but it must have been older than the other bars as there was a slight taste of the refrigerator on it. Oreo bar was more like a brownie like cake and cream cheese with some oreo on top, not very heavy on the oreo taste. 7layer was pretty good.

Chosen for lunch when I delivered a colleague visiting for a conference back to the hotel, a visit to Grand Café at Palace Station served as my second experience at one of Station Casino's 24-hour eateries, and although the pasty case was not quite as well apportioned as that at Red Rock, it was to the same menu of diner eats and American classics that we were treated, the service a bit less attentive than at the Summerlin iteration but the cuisine no less competent or well priced.

Located just inside the Self-Park garage, mere steps away from the gaming floor outside, Grand Café at Palace Station features a rounded central bar set on both sides by tiered dining and opting to be sat opposite several large parties our arrival was greeted with menus and water, the humorous 'My Generation"" placemats cleared from tables as a sizable selection of pastries and entrees were made.

Largely self-selected, my dining partner already sated from a lunch at the conference from which she came, it was with a shared cinnamon roll and banana nut muffin - both rewarmed and piping hot to touch - that the dining began and while the tightly wound roll lightly topped with icing was as good as the sticky bun from previous experience the muffin was unfortunately marred by what can only be assumed as artificial banana extract, the flavor too sweet and far underspiced despite a crumb that was quite moist.

Moving next to 'entrees,' the Log Cabin eschewed for pure maple syrup that has become a staple of my weekend laptop bag, a four-stack of pancakes punctuated with fresh blueberries proved every bit as good as the chocolate chip version enjoyed at Red Rock and again challenging DuPar's for best the best Buttermilk batter in the valley a similar tangy topnote imbued both members of a duo of biscuits, the fluffy rounds just-short of golden but otherwise excellent beneath a topcoat of butter and honey served alongside a selection of jams.

At this point quite full, but still with ten bucks to spend on the hotel's $30 voucher, it was with three cookies and an abysmally dry cupcake that the meal would end, and although the cutesy ""Black and White"" was far less interesting than it would have been had the kitchen actually used cocoa or lemon instead of just sugary vanilla, both the chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies were homey and classic, the lightly crisp rim and soft center dense with flavor yet relatively low in sweetness, the results far better than one would expect from a simple café in a smoky off-strip Casino...or even one along Las Vegas Boulevard charging a dollar or two more.

Generally disinterested in the soups, sandwiches, salads, or entrees offered at places of this ilk, Grand Café once again proves to a good spot for a cheap breakfast for locals and tourists alike.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,1,3,CANK-qgQGLX2SUaUk9GAjA

Plus lacked any cheese at all to call an omelette, my English muffin was SOAKED in oil, it was like a wet sponge when squeezed slightly, but they corrected and gave me new to add butter as I pleased (thumbs up to the waitress!) . The second time I had the 'All American French Toast' with three eggs, I've never in my life had over easy eggs that the whites were still raw. The French toast was ok, my boyfriend had 'Huevos Rancheros' which were nothing near authentic to anything we've ever had in New Mexico, Arizona or Colorado.  It had fried corn tortillas with hardly any beans, some sliced black olives which is in no way a authentic Mexican additive, the only dish so far worth having is the ""lighter fair""- value breakfast.
