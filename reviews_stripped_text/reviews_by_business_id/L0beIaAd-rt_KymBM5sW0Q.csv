I've seen them at the Rugby 7's and Pure Aloha and never miss a chance to get my samoan food fix. Me and my family will continue to support our only Samoan eatery for many years to come!!!!",CznYreY7chaRt8hNYk3eHg,0,0,5,ESs6DneRh1YIgX8AAu8QHg
1837040,2016-05-26,10,L0beIaAd-rt_KymBM5sW0Q,"Yet another review about how impossible it is to come here because they don't keep their own hours. I understand  ""island time"" but not even being open on your designated days is pretty sad.  I've come by on weekday afternoons, weekend lunch time, and shortly before close- no one is ever here. 

Neighboring businesses have received my patronage instead and have said they're not sure this place is even open. Their social media pages make  more  mention of their pop-up booths at events and plate sales rather than their actual store. What a joke.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,8,1,fZR-yeSpLjAvZyhDHH6apg
3416166,2016-04-25,0,L0beIaAd-rt_KymBM5sW0Q,"I've never been in here but my review is about the fact that I went there and the doors were locked when the hours shown on their door should have been open.  I tried calling this business to see what was going on and no answer.  

I've asked other people in the surrounding business to see if they new what was up with this place and they've also said they've encountered the place being locked when they should have been open.  

Anyone know the deal with this place?  I really wanted to see what this place had to offer.",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,1,2,1,cab29wO7_FsHqMqD7kK6tQ

3894046,2015-06-06,1,L0beIaAd-rt_KymBM5sW0Q,Talofa! We appreciate the fact that this place sells items that we can all appreciate. However the advertised open hours were not honored. I hope to see a business that can stick to their advertised open hours---it will certainly help with your credibility. Thanks.,NdNvFpwLzqqbhUPRwOXKnw,5,2,1,7xOQPH1w_HUGeWTpMYJY9g

The owner was very kind and gracious. :-) Check it out!",YZ1feafp1MD2NwljtuOJiQ,4,1,5,21nRa0yt1lBG_g8xU2-uGw

5590389,2015-05-24,1,L0beIaAd-rt_KymBM5sW0Q,It's a good place if they kept to their opening times. We've been there since 10-1033 n still not open. People are in there but no one answers the phone...smh,f7Cg7ru3D3K98W-AItodmQ,5,2,1,cywSZPUPxgF2zbv7dGN7XQ
5599583,2013-05-28,5,L0beIaAd-rt_KymBM5sW0Q,"I recall this place being some sort of Tongan and Samoan market a few years back.  Uncle that was serving me claims that the owners have switched several times until it became the Hungry Islander.  

Inside you will find that the mom and pop Polynesian store specializes in anything from crafts, memorabilia, collectibles, canned islands foods, frozen turkey tails, lamp chop necks, as well as other island favorites (Manapua, Zippy's chili, Portugese Sausage, S&S Saimin, Shumai, etc.).

As usual, Polynesian hospitality was in full effect and although ran on a skeleton crew of two when I was there, there was no shortage of courtesy what so ever.  Also, remember that because I am from the islands, I ain't scared to tell it how it is, so no bias perspectives here, uh thank you.

You will trip out wondering where the food is at first, but you will find that there is a buffet bar towards the rear of the establishment, serving up daily made hot and fresh Sapasui, Palm corned beef and cabbage, Faiaai Pilikaki and Samoan Sausage.  The dishes are served with rice or taro and comes in 1,2 and 3 entree plate lunches.  The only thing is that the cheapest starts at $10.99 and the grinds are take out only.

Its hard to go wrong with corned beef and cabbage, the sausage could use a little more seasoning or at least a dipping sauce, but was very tender to say the least.  The Faiaai Pilikaki (Mackerel and Mayo Mix) was ohhh so good, but probably not the best in terms of calories.  I had my dish with taro and didn't complain about the serving portions.  After all, Samoa's number 1 export ain't coconuts or green bananas...it's NFL athletes.

I will most likely be back to by some goods for the house.  The pricey plate lunches may reserve my cravings to maybe once every month or so.  Still, Polynesian food is a not as easy to come by unlike its Hawaiian cousins.  I already know all the true sole's must know about this place, now that they have been here for over a year this April. 

If you like Samoan food, and because it is somewhat of a specialty due to its scacity, I would have rated this place a 3.5-3.75, rounding it to a nice 4 star experience.  Not bad at all.  Cheeee Hooooooo!",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,18,4,4,acFTtpProcw6yirM6GEy0Q
