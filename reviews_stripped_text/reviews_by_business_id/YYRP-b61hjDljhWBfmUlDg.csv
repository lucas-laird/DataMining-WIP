So, after seeing the commercial about their spicy chicken sandwich,  we couldn't wait to give it a try.  The drive thru is super slow, but that is always the case. The sandwich, where do I start?? Lame, Dry, not spicy AT ALL, DRY. The bun was dry, the lettuce wilted salad, that looked like it was the last of a bag of lettuce. And, that was it. No mayo, or sauce to compliment the chicken. Nothing. I not sure if it is supposed to be like that or our sandwiches were incomplete. I do know that it was a waste of money, and I immediately felt as of we should have gone some where else. I don't really see KFC getting anymore of my hard earned money.",HM5XXRYDiJV0Kq_IyFdulw,0,0,2,zVsDcaMlhsEJxft9bYIg_Q

I see that someone had taken a bite out of it. I threw it away of course, but that is just rude and disgusting!.",hYq47tz0K9l12hy1TDeVRg,1,0,1,p9oyhOQoHO3GykGOnR5w6w
863992,2016-08-10,0,YYRP-b61hjDljhWBfmUlDg,After a really long day at work I stopped by this KFC for a quick dinner. I ordered the dinner chicken tenders and potato wedges and coleslaw. When I got home I found that the chicken tenders or so drive out that I couldn't eat them even the dogs will eat them. The potato wedges were also dry it out like they've been under the warmer for hours. The only thing that wasn't messed up with the coleslaw and that's because it came from a jar they couldn't mess it up. I called and talk to the manager there and she apologized profusely. I told her that that didn't help me with my dinner because I hadn't eaten yet. She said I could come back and she would replace the dinner. I told her I didn't have another half hour to drive up there and back to get my dinner why doesn't she bring the dinner to me. She said oh no I'm not allowed to leave the store. So I told her that she had lost a customer for life and that I would be writing this review for you. I give this restaurant a one-star rating because you can't give them a zero,lsowbYtSs2fvZQl1i9AQOw,0,0,1,YiPBX4dDDpqXMracj5YXVw

The manager was very nice. She wished us happy holidays before leaving the establishment. When we got home the food was awesome. Original hot and fresh. I rate this establishment a five star. I could see why ppl would rate this store low, its because of the area. There is a bunch of homeless and weridos. The employees were nice, the food was excellent!",5r7oPiNj_TgXCww42M17dQ,0,0,5,xQCvWu338aU0iHPF9qb_NA
2042235,2017-12-21,0,YYRP-b61hjDljhWBfmUlDg,I like KFC but this one is a joke. I gave them several tries but they messed up my order every time. There is no one else in the drive through so why do they make you pull forward? I think it is so you have to get out of your car and go inside to make it right. Not only do they not give you everything you order but their buns for the chicken littles are hard as a rock. I work close by and see it is always empty. That should tell you something. And by the way if you sell strips you should stock ranch dressing or at least tell people when they order that you are out of most dipping sauces. Is seems like not only the pitiful employees but also the management have issues. Never going back.,GYb40uqCrBNqkMU0OK06Rw,0,0,1,ijOK58mA93uxyIUd9F0nbg

3886447,2017-06-07,0,YYRP-b61hjDljhWBfmUlDg,"I am addicted to KFC's bowl (minus the gravy).  And their biscuits.  YUMMY!!!

However, the reason that I am giving them 3 stars instead of more is because every time, and I am literally not kidding here, EVERY time I go through their drive thru, they mess up the order.  Either they put the gravy on the bowl, or the cookie is missing, or they don't give me one of the biscuits, or they entirely forget to give me my drink, or they charge me wrong... EVERY TIME!!",nr2QuEyY_ZKicxnF4eCmLQ,0,0,3,Z9ZjRmV5JMkGT7kf4cXpVA
3924460,2015-07-13,1,YYRP-b61hjDljhWBfmUlDg,"The guy at the counter was kind and awkwardly flirtatious in an 1800's way. He interrupted my fianc√©  several times to continue his charm. I am not flattering myself in any way I just think it was his personality. Aside from that, the location feels like it needs a full sanitation. It was maintained ok but it feels like frying oil sits heavy in the air. Orders were not served as ordered and their drink machine has a refrigeration problems and is not making ice. The food was not fresh. Everything was a bit chewey with an oil taste. Too tired to send it back we just picked at it. The employees were kind and that is why I gave 2 stars. Overall, KFC as a company feels irrelevant and the quality and value in the last 20 years feels like it is unconceivably in decline from you last visit. Popeyes is a better choice when making the bad choice of eating fried chicken. 
Regret eating here, KFC may be how bulimia became an eating disorder. A pun in poor taste.
I forgot to mention that it smelled like vomit in the kitchen area, I made the mistake of lingering too long at the front counter to put a lid on my drink.",cHH08OXLpHyHTkBRAwiJOA,1,0,2,Ri1gEFmaZbXqyojEfzB8Aw
3980346,2011-03-23,1,YYRP-b61hjDljhWBfmUlDg,"lets see....

they must have a slimmed down menu at this location. 

i wanted popcorn chicken and it wasnt on the menu. i had to settle for 5 hot wings, potato wedges and a soda for 5.00. i maybe had 5 wedges total in the box. and the wings were overcooked and not very flavorful. 

i was disappointed and I feel ripped off. i should have went to mcdonalds next door",xXdEnTdGaAuYGV7XKxxuSw,1,0,1,WXFdUfUwg2lDCaT-5NFXhw

Next he over charged us and when I talked to a ""supervisor"" Farrah she refused to issue a refund for the over charge and when I asked for the number to corporate she refused to give that information to me. She is so disrespectful and shouldn't have a job. Oh and they would give condiments when asked even when you order a 16 piece meal. Such a rip off!!!! She just couldn't handle customer service at all. She didn't have an answer for the over charge but yet wouldn't give me my money back.

4304894,2015-05-28,1,YYRP-b61hjDljhWBfmUlDg,"Went there for a side of mashed potatoes and a biscuit to be able to take meds for a headache.  We, my daughter and I ended up getting the $5 fill up boxes.  I asked the young lady in the drive thru if she could make SURE that I got fresh biscuits.  We also asked for Strawberry Lemonade with our meals. 

I'm rating this place with only one star because we didn't get cookies that come with the $5 box.  My biscuits were barely warm and that freshness was REALLY important to me.  I was told that they didn't have any jelly for the biscuits so I asked for butter and also didn't get that.  I am not a connoisseur of Lemonade, but it really tasted like Grapefruit juice.  The barely pink lemonade didn't have even a hint of Strawberry flavor, so I will have to say KFC is the first fast food restaurant to serve Pink Grapefruit juice as a beverage.  It was terrible!",Cap3bkEK4rFnMl44i61BIg,2,0,1,aAFzWzxv6purkaQ70h2J2g

Then got rude talking about I was rude for saying really.....her name is Porscha. I am a grown man, I don't have time to argue especially a woman. Then you a manager so you want to argue with a customer when you or your team members are clearly shorting people on their food.

I tried to order a famous bowl, and the guy told me they didn't have anymore popcorn chicken, so I asked if he could just put a chicken tender in the bowl. Then I asked for a side of Mac n cheese and he didn't have that either because it would take 15 mins to cook. And then the cashier tried to explain it was only him and two other ppl on the shift blah blah blah  After I paid for bowl he then told me to park ahead and he would bring me the food cuz it takes another 8 mins to cook the one piece of tender I had wtf. I then waited over 15 mins and finally my husband went in side to see what the hold up was. When I received the food it was smother and gravy and was absolutely disgusting .",-ig71n4poJNQtf-7XCKqfg,0,0,1,SLSXKBK-y9nH7FuS13-dvg

The potatoes were watery and just blended with the gravy.  The chicken was dry and warm definitely not fresh.  They said it was the last piece of original. The biscuit was ok. The cookie was really good. Guess that deserves one star. Lol",y7y7OA8Z5rPXPW3ES6-Rgw,0,0,1,w2qwYfdzTf5BTAXQa0LzsA

I have found they key to ensuring fresh, hot delicious ones is ordering a 20 piece. I will always have to wait but it is well worth it in in my book.
 
Even left over, these wings are still crunchy and crispy. I have got to figure out what they put in the batter.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,3,2,3,Sg_1BpgsIlZqYroEzfW42w
