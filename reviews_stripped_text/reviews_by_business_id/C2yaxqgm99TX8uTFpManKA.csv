  My husband and I just got married in Vegas 2 weeks ago and had our welcome party at La Salsa Cantina and it was AWESOME!! They did a spectacular job. They were so nice, extremely accomodating and even the DJ they use (Yameel) was terrific. Waiters were on top of everything. Before I was done my beer they were there with a fresh one in hand :) It was the best and whenever we make it back out to Vegas we will be visiting again! 5 stars all the way :)

We were just walking and suddenly listened to some loud salsa music.
Since,we're all Latinas we were so excited and just stopped by. It was like 11:30 pm and there was no line at all!! They asked us for IDs and there was no cover charge...Also there wasnt any dress code and they let us in with flip flops....
They Place its small, and its was too Crowded!! There werent any tables available so we had to stay up and just dance with the crowd. Drinks are good here for the price.

We ordered Margaritas Yardas and they were HUGE!! 
Bartenders and waiters are all latinos and very friendly. Music its a Mix of everything... Salsa,Bachata,Pop,Rock en Espanol,Cumbias,etc.... Nice if you're on the mood for some latin music and want to dance something different in Vegas.

The only thing i didnt like about this place its the bathroom. It only had 
2 bathrooms for that amount of ladies. I had to wait like 30 minutes for my turn. Also, they were very dirty and all wet, i had to cleaned it myself. By the way,i didnt come back again to use this bathroom.

775470,2014-05-10,0,C2yaxqgm99TX8uTFpManKA,"First of all, the Margaritas are some of the best on the strip and more potent than they taste.  They will add as much booze as you want (for an additional charge, of course) and will make those yard long margaritas on the rocks if you ask really nice.  Pro Tip: Don't race your friends to see who can drink their yard long first or you'll be siting out side next to gold painted street performer for a solid 15 minutes trying to get your bearings.  Now, the food (I ordered the Mexican Pizza) was AMAZING....granted I was wasted by the time it came due to said 'rita race, so very little wouldn't have been delicious at that point.  

Some might take issue with spending $20-35 on a yard long anything, especially in Vegas where the booze is ""supposed"" to flow freely, but if you think you're drinking for free when you plunk $60+ into a machine while you wait 30 minutes for the waitress to brink you your watered down well drink,  this becomes the steal of the century.",DZlDT48YujgbDa0_-nMWFg,0,2,5,QlER6wIC8NjPA49S6rpj5Q

This place is the bomb diggs. Spent the week in Vegas with my friend and we got a TEENSY WEENSY bit tired of spending $20+ on breakfast every morning, so we ventured out to the strip to see what else Sin City had to offer our grumbling (but tan) bellies. 

La Salsa Cantina looks super chachki, with a giant margarita glass out front that albeit screams ""eat here for free diarrhea!"" But right next to that is a small sign that advertises $3.95 breakfast. Could it be?! Is it edible?!

I am both pleased -- and weary, because I don't want to give away the secret -- to tell you that it IS real and it IS edible. Beyond edible, actually enjoyable. For your hard earned 4 one-dollar bills, you get eggs, homefries, two tortillas and a choice of meat. I also asked for cheese on my scrambled eggs, and wrapped up all the ingredients into a delicious breakfast burrito. TO DIE FOR. 

Went twice and it was equally good the next morning.

Not sure if being so cheap made the food taste better, or if maybe I still had some extra alcohol in my system, but my mouth is literally watering thinking about how good this meal was. It's still essentially diner food, so no need to get all hot and bothered, but a great option and a TON of bang for your buck.

Started with the Caipirinha (Brazil's national rum drink)--was good, they were not light handed with the rum.  For $13, they better not be light handed!

Had the fish tacos entree.  Came with fresh sliced avocado and rice and beans.  The beans were a little weird, not quite black beans, not quite re-fried?  I didn't eat them, but I'm not a bean fan.  Had a delicious sauce on the fish tacos, can't remember what it was exactly, but definitely had some Ranch in it.  The fish was also seasoned beautifully.
Husband had a green chile burrito dish and really enjoyed that as well.  

We went early for dinner (5:30ish) and so it was dead which was nice because we got good attention from the server.  However, we also watched two other servers eat their dinners in front of us.  Thought maybe there should be a staff area where they can eat out of view of guests.

1791165,2015-05-06,0,C2yaxqgm99TX8uTFpManKA,"I brought my family & friends for lunch on Saturday April 26, 2015. We have been here numerous times, so I was looking forward to having a good time with my family. Unfortunately, this time was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant. I will never set foot in this place because the manager lacks the skills she needs to run a restaurant or a business for that manner. 

Our waitress took our order for our drinks. She brought out  some of the drinks for the adults but forgot our kids drinks.  Another 15 minutes pass and she comes back and starts asking us, what would we like to drink? We were all confused because she already took our order. After another 20 minutes pass and we had to remind he that our kids didn't have their drinks. So she finally brings them & takes our order for our food. 

The waitress brought 2 orders of guacamole with chips. My friends started eating them because they had ordered place one order. When she realized they brought an extra order by mistake, she picked up from the table. She didn't bother to ask if we wanted to keep them. I thought that was really rude. 

My wife order a michelada at the bar. It tasted horrible so I asked the another waiter if they could make her another one. He said sure but the manager has to approve it. The manager came over & I asked me what was the problem. I told her, ""my wife bought a drink and it's horrible can you have a differs bartender make it?"" She got upset grabbed the glass and started to walk away. I then said "" All I expect is good customer service."" She turned around and tried to argue with me. She told me, ""what you're not getting good customer service?"" I respond, ""honestly no. How am I getting good service when my kids can't even get a drink. I had to keep asking for my kids drinks. That's horrible don't you think?"" She then told me, ""do you want an appetizer?"" I responded, ""No, I want good customer service. That's all I expect."" She left with my wife's drink and never brought her another one. My wife had to ask another bartender for a drink. 

About an hour after we ordered our food, we finally got our  food. My burrito was ok but for the price I paid I expect better. I had a steak burrito. My wife's fajitas were delicious. Unfortunately, she had to ask like three time for tortillas. My friend's sampler was cold. They didn't even eat it. The beans are horrible don't get them. 

There were two other couples that complained about the service. They walked out mad cussing out the manager too because she was being rude to them as well. 

The manager never came back to apologize to me or my family. The waitress gave us a discount of our bill. I paid my bill & tipped the lady even though I had bad service. I understand it must be hard for servers. I am more upset with the horrible manager. She is the one that needs training!!! Thanks to her I will never come back!!!!!!

2149462,2014-04-10,2,C2yaxqgm99TX8uTFpManKA,"I'd been to other La Salsa locations in Vegas, and they have never done me wrong.  I went to this location because I was starving in the middle of the day, and wanted a cheap meal with a beer.  La Salsa advertised both a lunch and beer special on sandwich boards on the sidewalk, which sounded great, so I obviously I'm going inside.  

There is a bar near the front, so you can still get some sunlight, and they have video poker!  SOLD!  I drop some cash in the VP machine, order the beer special, follow it up with the lunch special, and I'm good to go.

Strike 1 - The bartender comes back 10 minutes after I order my meal, and he says that they are out of the lunch special, and hands me a menu.  It's 3-frigin'-30 in the afternoon, and they're already out of the lunch special?!?  How about taking down the sandwich board outside so more people don't get rooked into buying a meal that's twice as expensive as they planned??  FYI, they didn't take down the sandwich board.  I ordered something else, and it was decent.  And how do you run out of Mexican food?  Everything has the same ingredients, it's just packaged different.  And this was a basic burrito.

Strike 2 - None of my beers were comped.  Whoa whoa whoa, what??  Is this Russia?  This isn't Russia.  Really, is this Russia?  What bar doesn't comp beer for playing?  I've been to one or two in my life, but they let you know up front.  

So I lost money in the machine (as I expected), paid for my beers (not expected when playing), and bought a lunch that was twice as expensive as they advertised (never crossed my mind that would happen).

This La Salsa either intentionally rips people off by LYING that they don't have a certain dish left, they have terrible business practices, or they are incompetent.  I am NOT going back to this La Salsa ever again, and the other locations probably lost my business as well.",r9oueOmGTqRlg-ah6XnFsA,2,1,1,o42NJLWpNMPrjLqWEs_iKg

This gentleman was what a good server should be: engaging, funny, polite and friendly. Attentive. Because of him, I had a very pleasant visit. I'm gonna be honest and say that I didn't really like the food although I really enjoyed the steak quesadilla I ate. Starting off with the chips and salsa, the chips are on point. Ours were fresh out of the fryer and nice and crunchy. The salsa, FAKE. No spice, nothing nice, and I felt like those cowboys in the commercial that say: ""This stuff was made in New York City!!!"" The queso fundido and the guacamole were outstanding though, and went perfectly with the tortilla chips.

Moving on to the rest of the food, AGAIN, FAKE BEANS AND FAKE RICE. BOO!!!!! You can't fake the Mexican, cause a real Mexican and real Mexican food lovers will know what real Mexican food is supposed to taste like and in all of my 37 years of eating Mexican food, I've never tasted rice like that before. IF you've ever seen buffets or cafeteria lines whip out a bag of pre-cooked rice and then pour it in to a tray, you get it and it has like a rubbery/plastic taste and texture, you'll know what I'm talking about. Puro Rice-A-Roni/Uncle Ben status. My wife and I shared a shrimp enchilada plate, and I felt that they could have been a little spicier, but overall were not bad.

My only real complaint about this place is that breakfast isn't served all day. It's only served till 12 pm, and I don't know about you, but who gets up before 12 pm in Vegas? I had wanted chilaquiles and a cheap bloody mary, but sadly, I couldn't get either because 12 pm had passed, sniff, sniff. Maybe I should get up earlier next time so I can try their breakfast.

We had just landed in Vegas and were craving huge margaritas and snacks. Since it was almost noon (that's 3 oclock dc time okay?), we were seated right away. The cheapest margarita was $9, which in Vegas is not a lot at all, but if I'm going to pay $9 for the shittiest alcohol they have, there better at least be a lot of it in my drink. There wasn't...so we asked the waitress if they could add a bit more alcohol (obviously asians age well so maybe she thought I was like 18 or something and gave me a virgin). She basically rolled her eyes, but brought it back with a nice shot on top. Cool. 

We ordered only a few guacs and quesos for the table and she basically rolled her eyes again (sorry this was our first day, not ready to be big spenders yet). Both tasted fine, nothing special. HOWEVER, each dip came with a plate of like 10 stale chips. R U serious??? But luckily enough for us the bowls that the guac and queso came in were edible so obviously we crushed those.

Their ""specialty"" is margaritas by the yard. So, my posse is walking down the Strip towards our hotel, The Excalibur. Me and my homey Dead Mike decide to stop and gits us an $18 margarita. For $18 it has to be good, right? WRONG! 

I got a berry margarita, I think Mike got raspberry. They both sucked. I don't think either of them had more than a drop ot tequila. By the time I finished my margarita I thought I was going to get sick just from all the pre-mixed artificial berry concentrate, and I was sober. Mike just stopped drinking his. What was the point? 

For $18 there needs to be an ample amount of tequila in a drink. Hell, for $18 it should all be top shelf with pure agave. Instead, this place dumps some concentrate into a blender with some pre-mixed margarita. The ""advantage"" is seemingly that in Vegas you can walk around with a drink in your hand.

Well, if I want to walk around with non-alcoholic margaritas I can do that at Disneyland. I get infuriated when I think about the nerve of this place.",n45pqe8LP7NaPKiXBBiM8w,3,3,1,ZQHlx_SAZUGRhFwFRMe65Q

We had just picked up a few souvenirs at the neighboring Coke and ABC Stores, and quite honestly I wasn't in the mood to eat at a food court or wait a great deal of time for seating/waiting for food. I had seen their breakfast special ($4.99) sign in front and I remembered it on the way back to our parking. 

We stopped in and were seated immediately at 10:30am - it was not overly crowded but about 75% of the tables were occupied by recovering Vegas enthusiasts. The noise level was low to medium, same with the lighting. At 10:35 we had placed our orders. I checked my FB newsfeed and shared a few memes with my best friend, and was able to lovingly gaze at their tequila selection for a few minutes before feeling nauseous/dehydrated again. Luckily our waitress had already brought over my eSprite! By 10:45 we had our plates in front of us. My breakfast quesadilla was good and I would have finished it except for the little fact that my body was only craving water and a green juice! The potatoes were a little tough for me.

Sprinkled along the Vegas strip, I'm sure plenty of La Salsa Cantina's are the equivalent of McDonald's, but with a heartier affair and with better service.  We had 11 in our party and one awesome man named Javier served us all and with such a pleasant smile that after we finished our breakfast of champions and while all the rest of my party gave him good-bye high fives, I extended a little more thank you with a good-bye hug.  He was willing to deal with our rowdy group to make sure we ate well and left with a smile.  Well, we did so thank you!

The food is average, but how can you beat $3.95 for eggs, potatoes, and choice of bacon or sausage?  Of course I skipped the pork, but eggs and potatoes were pretty tasty.  A side of french toast for $2 was a perfect accompaniment.  Not to be forgotten, my double bloody mary (also $2) was pretty damn good too.

We went with the pricey Patron margs (at $13/ea). They were tasty, but really just like any other margarita on the rocks you have every had!  We also started with their fresh made guacamole (they don't do it at the table, but instead make new batches every 3 hours). The guac comes with two salsas and a big basket of chips.  I loved the smokey chipotle salsa and the guac was chunky and tasty. The chips could have used some salt! 

For dinner I had the Green Chile Chicken Burrito (with a side of black beans and rice).  It was excellent.  The burrito itself was stuffed with grilled chicken, whole roasted green chiles and a nice red sauce.  It was crisped up on the fry top and served cut in half (made for easy eating).  

The restaurant itself was kind of forgettable as far as look and feel.  Honestly, while in there I told my husband it reminded me of a Margaritaville in an airport!  Huge bar, a few tables.  Also good to now that while it is in the Forum Shops, it is way down on level 1 all the way at the street (kind off to the side) as you are going out towards Joes (it looks like you are leaving and then there it is!).

The fish was definitely not high quality.  It tasted like cheap whitefish or cod.  The rice was alright, and the black beans were just beans from a can with no spices.

I first went to LAX and it was so crowded, nowhere to dance! What's the point? So, we came here and had a BLAST!!! Next night we went to HAZE at Aria, and it was SUCH a disappointment, so we came here, again. It was so much fun! Staff is friendly, people are friendly. We didn't have the food so I can't comment on that, we just came to dance and it was SO MUCH FUN! I was probably the only non-Latin in there but nobody cared! It was a BLAST!!!

P.S. - they had water bottles for a dollar... A DOLLAR!!! This is unheard of at the strip. I was a happy camper since I don't drink!",l_ZWV8uvBVBKCvMNt7NtkQ,1,1,5,oDvQKh4mIgGv2RFiwCPe6w
5304274,2007-10-31,0,C2yaxqgm99TX8uTFpManKA,"The only reason to even stop when trekking down the sidewalk is for the yard-long margaritas. The bartender that served us was fast, upbeat, and excited (geuinely or not) to have us there. She made a mean margarita on the rocks and it had more tequila than I was expecting from such a touristy hole. In fact, it had quite a lot of cheap tequila. Which, in yard-long quantities, spawns the beginning of an awesome Vegas night. 

Minus one-star for telling us it was $16, then asking us if we wanted on the rocks while failing to tell us that would be an extra $3. Still - get it on the rocks. Trust me.",KKdBQXnUlVUZ0ZNTfMQoEA,1,0,3,OL_WmZaEwrCnEpBQsG4H3g
5394508,2014-12-27,0,C2yaxqgm99TX8uTFpManKA,"The Las Vegas strip is filled with a lot of pricey places to eat. It's easy to get lost in the void of expensive gourmet and overpriced mediocre food. If you're really cost conscience you'll eat at the fast food joints like McD's and Sbarro, or maybe stock up on cheap take away from the ABC store.

And then there's the Salsa Cantina. It's a nice little Mexican restaurant with sit down service, pretty good food and decent prices. I found the staff at this one (it's a chain) to be very friendly and efficient. They have plenty of tables and booths for seating and pedestrian traffic doesn't seem that bad. If you don't want to be all shoulder to shoulder eating in a food court tripping over people and their kids, this place is nice to get a booth and somewhat ""privacy"". 

The atmosphere is pretty fun and it's dim with lots of neon lights and has that feel of actually being in Mexico. But your on the Vegas strip. And just so you know, they have a photographer come to your table and take pictures of you. They'll come back with a free postcard photo of you and then offer you a couple of framed photos. $20 for one or $30 for two. We declined, my iPhone took care of that tidbit of memorabilia for us. 

They have a breakfast special of 2 eggs, meat (sausage patty or bacon) home fried potatoes and corn or flour tortillas for $3.95 up until 12 noon. Add a small Bloody Mary for 99¬¢ or a large for $2. Cheap cheap and very tasty. 

The Lunchtime special offers 2 enchiladas( choose chicken or beef and the beef is not ground beef, but steak), rice and pinto or black beans for $8.95 and $2 coronas. You have a choice of red or green sauce and both are delicious. For happy hour try the 48oz hurricane margarita. If you can't finish it, just take it with you. 

The only thing this place is missing is a mariachi band. But it's a great cost saver while staying on the strip.",qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYA,0,1,3,j6kH7arrnzI-kxrF2-MjLA

5473865,2014-05-09,0,C2yaxqgm99TX8uTFpManKA,"A few months back I ate at a random la salsa and had an amazing meal. Like, legitimately excellent (which is saying a lot, since I live in Southern California and used to live in Mexico). That La Salsa was somewhere between fast food and fast casual. I was looking forward to coming to this la salsa (because I really like Mexican food for breakfast), and was kind of surprised that it was an actual restaurant. The prices reflect that change as well. 

Overall, the experience was ok. The food was pretty good (nothing to write home about, but it cheaply and healthfully filled my belly), and the servers were nice enough, but the service wasn't really *good*. It was like a Mexican Dennys. This is totally ok if that's what you're expecting, but disappointing if it's not. Their hostess set up isn't really working. They have the hostesses doing a bunch of other miscellaneous crap around the restaurant and it means that you might wait a long time to be seated. 

I ate a full meal here once on my trip, and stopped in for some snacks to go twice. Their chips and salsa to go is around $2.50ish and they give you a massive amount of chips and salsa. Like I couldn't have gotten that much at the grocery store for that price. Their pinto beans are also delicious.",WqfKtI-aGMmvbA9pPUxNQQ,1,1,3,Vk6hCdgCMDqDRL9wwHeFQg

The restaurant has on the menu, a 48 oz margarita and the waiter kept trying to get me to get the Patron tequila, even after I repeatedly told him I HATE Patron, that was his first mistake, next, the waiter asked us if we wanted chips and salsa, we said yes, he brought them, we get the bill and its a charge for them, he never said they were not complimentary (where I'm from, Chicago, chips and salsa are complimentary), that was his second mistake (he did take them off the bill). To put the icing on the cake, I ordered  flautas, they were made with some of the thickest tortillas I have ever seen in my life, my friend's salad had no dressing, she asked for extra and where was our waiter?, running his mouth with his fellow staff members, it took him 15 minutes to bring a side of salad dressing, which we had to ask him for TWICE.

We got the chips and guac, and the guac was most excellent. I got a burrito, which was standard mexican fare. It was good, but not great. The restaurant was also almost a side-note and relatively hard to find in the Forums. They were pretty tiny and the decor left some to be desired.

Service was quick and happy and it's hard to complain about that. I think every single person who worked there came by to check on us while we were sitting there.",vJU7VP831iKtwdwdD49MWw,1,0,3,7I5BtMUO_NNbrchCJMlkWw

The club scene isn't really my cup of tea, I'm more of a bar hopper and a foodie, so this place was nice to hang out at.  Also, it was conveniently located right by the Excalibur where I was staying so I didn't have to walk too far drunk. Haha.

Anyways, when we got there at around 8:00ish it was pretty empty, but boy did it get packed as the night grew longer. Especially  at around 10:00pm when they clear out the bar stools and a few tables & chairs to make room for the dance floor, because on Friday & Saturday nights they have a DJ. So when that happens, it's crazy packed and everyone is dancing, which I didn't care for. Mehh.

I just stayed at the bar with my bf and watched all the sweaty people dance. Haha. The bartenders were very friendly and kind. They did their job well, I must say. One of them even gave me a shot of tequila on the house because it was my B-Day. Very awesome! 

Mmm so they have very yummy half  yard margaritas that you have to try. I asked our bartender to make it more on the stronger side and he pulled that off very well. Wow, that thing was strong and delish. And you get to keep the thing it comes in as a souvenir. 

Now about the food...
My bf and I shared the steak fajitas, those were so good! They had a very yummy taste to them and they give you a pretty big portion. 
We also came here one morning for breakfast because they have great breakfast deals, and I mean AWESOME deals! Very cheap, yet great quality food. I got the Huevos Rancheros and I was very satisfied!

I totally recommend La Salsa Cantina!",5YpJb1LvQNaf1_1oUIkRkw,0,0,4,pFcugoJHQrawFO_z5AuuwQ
5889621,2013-07-06,0,C2yaxqgm99TX8uTFpManKA,"Went here while traveling across the country on a stop to Vegas.  We had just left the MGM and decided we were hungry late at night and since coming from Ohio, where no Mexican restaurants are open late, we had to go!  Food is very average.  Overpriced and extremely Americanized Mexican food.  I was expecting a little bit more out of La Salsa Cantina but then we found the best part of this place, the yard margarita!

They were charging 17.50 for well tequila and 19 for top shelf tequila, which we chose!  You also get to keep the glass here, which was an added plus!  They don't play around with these drinks and they make them strong, taking care of us for the rest of the night!

I don't know if I'd suggest spending my money on food here, but definitely get the drinks if you do come here, well worth it, especially if you start the night here and get free drinks while gambling after for the rest of the night!",3G8Xml7x_AZkcqqA4PNEUg,0,1,4,v2KTDCczCudqmt2CiueQpw

When in Vegas you HAVE to take advantage of the opportunity to enjoy your alcoholic beverage on the street. They're $17.50-19.50 depending on what you choose, but trust me you are MORE than getting your money's worth.

I prefer mine on the rocks with salt. That way I can see (and be amazed) at how much alcohol they're putting in. And, somewhat less importantly, I find the frozen ones too sweet.",HMXi4ySve0_SNvLxwz1Vfg,0,0,4,DynKRbYXj1u-PbM4r51Rgg
