I was hesitant to order based on other reviews, but the location is super convenient for me. 

I placed my order through Eat24. I arrived to pick it up 10 minutes earlier than the estimated time (and very shortly after I placed the order). The food was ready, and I was very pleased! I wouldn't want to eat here because it smells like smoke from the bar next door, but I liked the decor and available games. 

The food was super solid. I had the chicken pesto sandwich with fries. The fries could have been slightly softer and warmer, but they were very well seasoned. I loved the crispy peppers on the sandwich. The bread was extremely heavy on tomato, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. 

My companion got the Reuben and was pleased. The order had chips instead of the requested fries, but the chips weren't bad. 

Overall, I would definitely order from here again.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,1,0,4,lOOarqGjl5y-BrgXxw-Ukg

The house made chips were odd, not really crispy, maybe a little mushy or rubbery inside and I'm not sure what they were going for, so those are not a do-over. I really want to like this place because it is so close to work (walking distance) but when you have $12 for a sandwich and then $2 for a drink you are at $17 with tax/tip. I think they would fill a lot more tables if they went a little more ""low-brow"" and shaved about $5 per person off the lunch ticket. I know it's hard to compete with places like Subway or Taco bell, but with those $6 meal deals it's hard to justify a $17 lunch if you are an average schmo trying to keep that lunch budget low. It's not a tourist place, it is surrounded by office buildings who love the idea of a place we can walk to for lunch.",iaQZQj_FRlQ9HJCQtgJb2Q,0,0,3,kpGNAm7KiOWiHTpWfDgGOw

The wheat ciabatta was unforgettable! The roasted turkey, provolone cheese, and sun dried tomato pesto created a party in my mouth.. then my tummy! It was so delicious. To top it off, they have these great chips that are the perfect combo of crispy and soft! This was definitely a win!

My second visit, earlier today, I ordered the All American Burger. I'm not too big on the fancy stuff! Any how, let me say, the second I opened my container, the aroma of real beef entered my nostrils and sent my tummy into a whirlwind. I could barely open my soda before I wanted to just devour my burger. The patty (Better known as a Mondo Patty) was cooked just the way I asked, and the cheese was melted oh so delightfully! The tomatoes and lettuce were crisp and fresh along with the pickles and onions I took off. (I always think I want pickles and onions until I actually see them, not their fault, mine!) Two words for my fries... ""ALL GONE!!"" 

Let me just say, if you are debating about coming here, debate no more. I called in the order and picked it up right away! Great service + Great food + Hidden Location = Gem of Las Vegas!

It came on a baguette, which is unusual for a club, but okay.  Beyond the bread it had a green chile type sauce on it, which is not a club sandwich.  I hate when someplace calls something a club that is not a normal club, it should have a new name if it is not a typical ""club"".   In addition to that it had.  If you look up the description of a club this was not it.  The bacon was not crisp, and appeared only partially cooked, and probably microwaved.  I don't understand how restaurants can send bacon out all wilted, I don't know anybody who likes it that way.

Big thick slices of ham and nice chunky pieces of pork along with pickles and all sorts of deliciousness I was in heaven. They have a very wide assortment of different sandwiches and salads. I tried the super 7 salad which has cranberries on it and I was able to save it for up to three meals almost 4 so it was a huge salad. Another total bonus about New American Sandwich Company is there chips, they must be homemade because I've never had chips like that out of a bag. They also have a catering company along with the restaurant so they've been doing this for years and they have perfected sandwiches and salads with the freshness and fastness that you're looking for.",jpaBV6e6Sf3_CgvShteDSQ,8,7,5,78BZ9sl-K0hGUiqJU2i2mw

NASC is adjacent to a bar in a business park- neither of which really fit the area, making it a little hard to find when they're the only spot in the complex open over the weekend. Besides the sandos, menu has bar staple apps and burgers.

Came in right after opening and ordered two sandwiches and a salad. There was only one employee working, sweet but a little overwhelmed. Dining area has a rustic slant to the decor and games to play while you wait.

The American Hero sandwich (roasted turkey, fire smoked ham, smoked pit beef, cheddar, Swiss) and the Fried Green Tomato BLT were both pretty lackluster- meats were all dry, bacon tasted microwaved, sandwiches were sans condiments which made them even dryer. The Chicago Chopped Salad was even worse, with old-looking chicken and dried-out pepperoncini. 

We didn't finish a single item we ordered and I wouldn't come back. Not sure how this spot gets rave reviews from anyone other than desk monkeys whose only alternative is food from a vending machine.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,6,2,9tT79QFeL-1RSA_uWFkC7A

As you can see in my pics, he has a wall of posters signed by all the performers (UPDATE: lost my pic of this somehow. Will take another next time I go :/) I am going to take a wild-guess that this catering is where the majority of his business comes from. I went during lunch and only one waitress was there. It's a small place and it was filling up as we left but it certainly is NOT a hopping, hipster paradise. If you are looking for the most unique sandwiches presented with a flower on your plate - this is not your stop. They have some staples and a few rare breeds but nothing that you can't get at another sandwich shop. 

I get that some people are turned off because it is attached to a bar, but living in Vegas running into bars is unfortunately unavoidable. I'm also personally a huge fan of dive bars so that might be why I don't mind it as much as some others. The entrance is SHADY as hell, I'm not gonna lie. When I opened the door to the place and saw like long gray hallway with a sign at the end that points to a door and says ""sandwiches"" I was like - um no. I persevered though and am I glad!

I thoroughly enjoyed the meal I had here as did my lunch companion. I had a reuben and it was beautiful. It was perfectly made, the proportions were on point, and the bread was toasted to perfection. The zucchini fries are beer battered! In honestly, it's not my favorite way to eat zucchini but it was delicious and I did eat them all. They are also massive, they basically slice the zucchini into 4/5 pieces long ways and fry. Hashtag, genius. My companion had the american club - or something like that. He liked it a lot.

This place has gone from a 5 experience down to maybe a 2.5 but I can't say 3 due to the many issues. 

Hopefully things go back to how I originally experienced them and I can change this review.",71sUR5bqzlSWqJ1lMynpWg,0,0,2,uQLCobtLYbk7bZJMVWl4dA

It wasn't my favorite, the meat was too salty for my taste, there wasn't enough onions and mushrooms in my sandwich. I barely drink water then I'm eating but I drank more than of the cup because it was dry and salty. The cheese was a little dry as someone said earlier. The fries were just okay. They also have Italian chips, I didn't order those but stole from my friend. They are home made and better than the fries, for sure.

It wasn't too crowded when we came in, so a 15 minute wait for hot sandwiches wasn't too bad. The service was good.

They also offer catering for lunch. The waitress told us that she delivers food to different companies everyday. The menu is different everyday. She said it very quick that I couldn't note it down.",NXn0RBMGCkKN_lIy7vkmIw,1,1,3,TZ7xsl5OmCUJxw5B__reIQ

I had the Fried Green Tomato BLT and it was delicious! :) Customer service was friendly and the food was out within 5 mins. Plenty of tables inside and outside.

Let me know if you make any changes and I'll come back.",viK0WBxOVdcG1f4Xqkrp5w,0,0,3,vJCLKyog1OQBSgJU2bCSVQ

Everything was very fresh and the bread was amazing. I had the Italian on tomato herb focaccia and my friend had the Red Rock. If I'm ever in the area again I'll be back. You should definitely give this place a try!,jTCKOMAZCNpWsFa5sDiajw,0,0,5,DXMS4xmqSwZts_4olOEmLw

The first time, I ordered a bulgogi cheese steak to go. The fries were crisp and salted with a flaky kosher salt, perfection. The bulgogi had shishito peppers and Sriracha mayo, which all came together for a spicy, hearty sandwich. It was just the right amount of heat and the peppers tasted deliciously smoky and kept their texture nicely amid the meat. My friend ordered the regular cheese steak and raved about it. We liked it so much we ate there again the next day. Natalie, who took my order both days, was very sweet and friendly. I tried the Italian deli sandwich with the homemade chips on my second visit. The bread they use is soft and freshly made. I prefer the fries over the chips. My only reservation is that the portions are a bit small for the price. The bulgogi cheese steak really could have used more meat for the $10.99 price tag. It's still better than paying $6 for a crap sandwich from my work cafeteria so I'll be back again for sure.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,23,24,4,6gzgwng3v3yxGfTLxOHwvA
