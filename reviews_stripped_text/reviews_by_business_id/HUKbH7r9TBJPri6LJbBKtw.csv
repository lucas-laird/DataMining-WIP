Its just ok, i used to comes often when i first moved downtown but then i found better. The staff and nice and alwats have smiles on there face.

""what are you crazy! you can't rub your eyes in this place.."" That's the feeling you get at Tacos Mexico. So yeah, this place would be an average tasty taqueria... If I were blind and deaf. If I couldn't see the homeless crackhead staring at me from outside (closely) as I was eating my meal. Or if I didn't have to acknowledge the three hobos hitting me up for change as I walked out. Or if there wasn't a flattened, month old pigeon (??) carcass on the drive-through pavement. Or if I could ignore the ""pregnant"" lady who needed money to buy food for her family but refused when I offered to just let me just buy food for her right then and there. Or if I couldn't see the security-barred windows and double doors I had to penetrate. Or... well you get the point. There were only two highlights. The homeless black artist who drew a fairly decent picture of two of my friends as they ate their meal (he ended up being a real cool guy) that and the orange-ish hot salsa which was seriously good and hot. Again, the food is actually alright, but again (and again and again), the whole experience was bad. It did make for a GREAT memory, however, for all the wrong reasons. When we got back into our car, secured the children, and shut the doors. It was a one of those moments you belt out a sigh of relief and share a good long laugh.

The tacos were slightly warm when it came out. But shouldn't it be hot? I didn't think my order was that long for the food to go warm/cold. The pastor (marinated steak) meat in the tacos was soft , mushy-like and shreddy (which i didnt like--i think the meat is probably old because if meat is marinated for a long time, the acid from the marination breaks down the connective tissue of the meat causing it to be mushy/shreddy). The carne asade fries had skinny fries with melted cheddar cheese, guacomole, onions, a little sour cream, and carne asade meat. It also came out slightly warm and since the cook was a little heavy on the cheese, I felt like i was eating cheese-fries instead of carne asade fries. My horchata tasted like its been watered down-- it was slightly sweet, but there wasn't a strong cinnamon taste in the drink.    

My overall experience here wasn't memorable. I wouldn't come back. I think I would be more satisfied eating a Chalupa from Taco Bell!!!",QEQYldM0S2uvjhbjJAuH3w,2,1,1,0Xik7ySEC87bkJis4rWJHw

Now for the staff.  The cashier lady tonight was so rude. Very unprofessional and unfriendly. She had a sour face, would not wait for us to finish our orders so she kept placing them incorrectly.  She did not only mess up our order but I overheard she messed up another customers order.  When the customer told one of the staff there, she went to tell the cook and she laughed about it and the cook had an angry face like it was a bother. It was just tacos, why is it such a bother to place them on different plates?!

Fear asking for a refill:  So this place only has the soda machine  where you have to ask the cashier for a refill.  This is a pretty busy place so I timed it to where the line was short (one lady in front of me). I stood behind this lady for about 15 mins.  The lady was not placing an order but was chit chatting with the cashier about personal things.  The cashier could of easily stopped the convo very quick to see what I needed but instead she kept on ignoring the actual customer behind (I'm gonna assume) friend. I finally got my chance when her friend realized I was waiting. The cashier barely acknowledged me, did not stop chit chatting with her friend, took my cup without looking at me but correctly assumed what refill I wanted (lucky guess?). I've been here before and I know they charge 50 cents for refill but I guess the cashier didn't care cuz she just placed my drink on the counter and continued to ignore me. I quickly ran off and my friend could not believe how long that took.

When we left the cashier had a stupid smile on her face directed at us. I just ignored her and walked out without saying anything with my friend behind me. Later, my friend told me the cashier and another girl that was cleaning the floor were laughing when we walked out and assume it was at us for some reason.

This would get 5 stars if the staff was friendlier, it's a shame because the food makes it 5 stars.  It's not a high end restaurant by any means but a smile and politeness wins over customers who would write positive reviews to bring in more business. I hope the owner sees this review, not only losing customers but giving away free refills.",5Rxnx3-JfcOcU5qJ8mQ6rA,0,0,2,9-rDCFQAszdLDgKemU7K-Q

1903056,2011-09-01,0,HUKbH7r9TBJPri6LJbBKtw,"After walking down to the Stratosphere early one morning, just to check the area out, I spotted Tacos Mexico lucking peacefully there on the opposite side of the street as I was trying to walk in the shade. Given I had just flown in, my body was still not on local time and it was way past lunch time for me though it was only 10:00. 

While walking, I stopped and asked a couple of local people what they thought of the Mexican place across the street and had they eaten there?  They said the food was ""authentic"" Mexican and the best meals were to be had earlier in the day.. so I thought perfect - let's give it try.  

Yeah, I read some other reviews and in walking up, the place is surrounded by smash bars on the windows and doors and even on the interior doors so go figure!  Is it design, is it decor, or is it protection or all the above?   Make no mistake, you know what end of the strip you are on and yeah, it's definitely not in the ultra-touristy end of the strip but it is not far from the Stratosphere and it's easy to get to by bus, car or on foot if you are very adventurous and don't mind a good hike!    Is the place going to give some people pause either from the outside or when they walk in sure.. but sometimes you need to trust your gut and your nose. 

I walked in and was promptly greeted by the young lady at the front cashier.  I scanned the menu and ordered a chicken burrito and large soda as I was dying from thirst from the early morning Vegas heat - did I mention I walked from the other end of the strip to here? 

The burrito was wonderful!   It was stuffed with chicken, beans and no cheese!  Nor was it stuffed with rice, rice, rice like many places.. I felt it was just the right combo and the flavors were dead on. There were no sides w/ the burrito but I really didn't need any.  It was all I could do to finish the single burrito and hit the trail back. 

While seated, there were quite a few locals who looked like they were regulars really enjoying their meals.

If you are up to the hike to this end of the stip or drive or bus or cab, and are craving authentic Mexican, then give these guys a try.   For the price no where near what you normally see on the other end of the strip, you will not likely be disappointed and will be rewarded with something to remember!.",64D9Ax7fQ5tbweQKXLOcUQ,2,1,3,v7_wWabeHlWKKZn60IhvBA

I'm so addicted to this place that it's not even funny. The four stars is because they don't speak English and they can be pretty abrupt and rude most days. OTHER THAN THAT, these are the best, most authentic tacos I've ever eaten. They make me so happy!

Okay, to be very fair, I only get the carne asada tacos with onions, cilantro and green sauce. Mmmmmmm...green sauce. They are small, but pack a mighty Mexican punch! The meat is always tender, never chewy and they always, always use two corn tortillas so you have something to hold your filling in. Those one corn taco places ensure you'll end up with food in your lap every single time! Not here!

I also love their beans and rice. The generous serving can be shared by two! 

I can get out of there with three tacos, beans and rice and a drink for about $5. Not bad, not bad. 

These are best eaten drunk or hungover. What? It's true! But, I happen to think all Mexican food is best that way. Then sober, next. Then every day. But you get the picture.

This building will scare you, it's doesn't have a working speaker at the menu board so keep driving to the window. Also, CASH ONLY. 

If you have a few dollars in cash to spare, get over here fast! For location info: it's close to the Stratosphere, next to the Burger King.

Prices have gone up, gone are the days when you could order a taco for $1.19, now a mediocre taco will cost you $1.69. 

This Tacos Mexico is located in a shady downtown neighborhood. I once had a bum stare at me while eating, it made for a very uncomfortable situation. The service here is just okay. It's a hit and miss. Today's cashier was extremely rude, she slammed the drive thru window as soon as the bag touched my hand, she was not friendly, she seemed miserable. On the plus, they finally got an English speaking cashier, thick accent, but that's a step towards the right direction. They only used to have non-english speaking cashiers. 

The food is okay, tacos are mediocre like I mentioned before. I've never ordered anything else here before. They do have a taco special, three tacos with beans/rice, and chips for $5 and some change. It's worth ordering if you're paying with cash, if you're paying with a debit/credit card then you'll be charged an additional dollar. The beans are the best here, they top them off with cheese, the meat is too dry and the rice has no flavor.  

Drive thru needs to improve. Wait time is about 20 minutes and they have no prices listed on their drive through menu. They have no voice box and you have to order at the drive thru window.

Maybe an order of 20 plus tacos wasn't the best idea, or maybe the tacos were that much better when I was here a few years back.  My pals and I needed heavy sustenance so we ordered a ton of tacos broken down as below:

Buche (1/5) - undercooked and a bit slimy.  Just not hitting the mark.
Al Pastor (3/5) - overcooked, though still had a decent marinated flavor 
Lengua (1/5) - probably the worst tongue I've ever had and I'm a huge fan of lengua.
Carnitas (2/5)- super dry, bland and tasteless.
Pollo (4/5) - Best of them all, not overcooked.  Solid choice.

I usually don't bitch when places run out of food, but I was looking forward to some classic carne asada tacos, but they ran out during one of their busiest times.  Maybe the beef would have been better?",bIsW255vsUMdZYk_IV7Xhw,2,2,2,lgwz48AT5DJoOj1tt1CuSA

Please don't come here to eat!!!  I went to the salsa bar to get some radishes to eat with the tacos but I was grossed out when I saw that some of these were brownish.  The establishment was very dirty, and is in need of remodeling.  I don't understand how this place has gotten the good reviews that it has.

This was the real deal.  Just past the Stratosphere. Tacos were about 1$ and some change.  Had to stop here on the way back from the Premium outlets.

The tacos pastor were very good.  It was shredded pork and grilled onions.  Extra cilantro, spicy salsa and lemon is how I do it.  The carne asada was really good, Perfectly seasoned, and only a couple of chewy pieces of meat!  They were not greasy They also had pazole, but that is not something you eat before hitting the strip. 

Every time I come to Vegas I have to get one taco from this joint.  If you want some good no frills Mexican this is the spot. Better than most places that I have had in Mexico. I suppose this could be a bit sketchy late night, but that is half the fun esé !

My only complaint is that the hot salsa could have been a bit more spicy.

A) famished

and 

B) broke

When that happens, nothing fits the bill better than Tacos Mexico.  The tacos are great and not only that, but they're dirt cheap, typically ~$1.00-1.25 apiece, depending on what kind you get.  I'll stop there for breakfast (yes, breakfast - they're open 24/7) and have 6 or 8 tacos.   For about $10 I'm stuffed.

One of the best things about Tacos Mexico is that you can get tacos made with a lot of exotic meats that you don't find at many places.  Instead of just the usual beef/chicken/fish tacos you can also get tripe, cabeza, intestine, tounge meat, etc.   They also make an awesome bowl of menudo (tripe soup) for ~$6.

As many have noted, this place is kind of dumpy but who cares?  If I want to take my wife for a fancy meal then I'll go to a nice steakhouse or one of the fancy buffets, but when I'm by myself and just looking for some quick, cheap, tasty food, Tacos Mexico is my first choice in Vegas.",qwlsMuXSDuORY9Ep0K-fGQ,1,0,5,_-p1fZf8aUpv4ihLbOxDAg

It  has become that.

This used to be my go to place but when I had to change to asada V/S pastor (pastor is my fav) I continued on and tried other dishes.  Because I loved this place they were my first in Vegas true mexican food place in town.  I use to savor the idea of this place, wait and withhold my diet to come to this place to splurge to have this place then I came to avoid this place.

It started when I ordered a Pastor burrito and it had pineapple in it.  I didn't order a canadian pizza if I wanted pineapple I would have asked for it.  As I said I avoided it for awhile but on the way home from a movie we though what the heck it used to be good food give it another shot!  So the boyfriend got a Pastor and I just couldn't give my full confidence so I got the Asada.  We got home and they both sucked.  No longer the pineapple in the pastor but it was old and mushy the rice was barely rice it was mush, mine was mainly gristle I kept biting and chewing and spitting out, I finally gave up and went to bed hungry.  Ugh

So my favorite went to my least favorite, I wanted it to become my favorite again but, I will never go back it will now be least favorite...

Every time I am in Las Vegas, I make at least one stop (usually late night) to this mecca of Mexican food goodness. 

The carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas tacos are always a favorite of mine. The amount of meat that they put on their tacos is always comparable to the size of the corn tortillas they serve them on.

Another thing I typically get is the tostada with carne asada. Now here is a generous serving of meat. The way the refried beans mingle with the lettuce, meat, salsa, tomato, and cheese complete with the satisfying crunch of the tostada.. Mmm, Mmm!! It doesn't get any better than that!

My drink of choice here has always been the jamaica. I've always liked hibiscus tea leaves and they do a very good job of it here. It's definitely worth stopping by here.

There is a wide variety of meats to choose from.  Stick with the carnitas, carne asada, or al pastor.  But if you're adventurous, try the sesos, cabeza or lengua. To me, its YUCK (and I'm hispanic). 
The tacos are made on little round corn tortillas, with just meat, onions, cilantro and hot sauce.  Make sure you order plenty (4 at least) cuz they are small.  
The burritos, however, are GINORMUS.  They pile on the meat, cheese, beans, rice, and salsa - or you can customize them any way you want..  HOLY CRAP.  Their menu has more on it than just tacos and burritos.  I recommend you try the sopes or the tortas (sandwiches).

BONUS: this place is CHEAP.  And take a Spanish speaking buddy.  They will treat you better if you speak the language. - see TIP below.

TIP: however, don't try to speak Spanish if you don't know how.  Believe me, they will respect you more if you're just a gringo with good taste in food.",hiakjDddWXWh5BCDv9I4ZA,3,3,4,7AeW8i2CM_Eam79LkKaL6w

1.) CONVENIENT - Late night food alternative that is close enough to the strip. 
2.) INEXPENSIVE - especially after burning money on gambling, partying, and overpriced club drinks! 
3.) QUICK SERVICE - It's a freaking fast food chain...it better be.
4.) MOSTLY TASTY GRUB - The tacos and burritos are pretty good. However, their Menudo really hits the spot....especially after a cold crazy night.

THE BAD: 
1.) FOOD SUPPLY - They often run out of certain food items.
2.) FOOD QUALITY - There have been some menu items that was definitely a miss and not a hit (might just be bad preparation). 
2.) INCONSISTENT SERVICE - Sometimes the service sucks.THEY FORGOT MY BURRITO!!! 
3.) RUNDOWN VENUE - The restaurant is kinda cheesy: jacked up jukebox busting out the Mexican music, the old school tables/chairs, and the cleanliness of the front counter definitely doesn't win ""positive"" awards. 
4.) SKETCHY AREA: There is a reason the place is caged up like minimum security prison. I've seen freaky things happen there - a guy beaten up and robbed right outside, the standard late-night fight between rowdy customers, and what looked to be an unfit teen mom with a half-naked baby that seemed to have horrible mouth sores (CALL CHILD SERVICES!!!)

THE FINAL VERDICT: TACOS MEXICO...SURE WHY NOT!?!
Cheap, semi-dirty Mexican food is definitely a good cure after a Vegas night of partying, drunkenness, and debauchery.

Ordered two tacos de tripa (extra crispy of course) and two Al Pastor tacos. I also tried half a taquito and it was delicious.

Plenty of parking on either side of the store, staff was cool but seating isn't fluffy approved, kinda tight but I wiggled myself into a booth.",UtmsHIyNNgeVZlm6CYLWjA,1,1,4,Yp2ykYKJ4OfPyZ1QBQP8GA

The signs are all in Spanish, but they have pictures and the cashier we worked with spoke good English. Definite dive but worth it.",7zvIwVHtMM0RW8hatGs6YQ,0,0,5,AhdBVf7wI0KGuAEz1AJSkw

The quesadilla came with a plate of rice and beans. The rice as straight dried out. Im positive it was sitting in a pot under hot water to keep it warm. The chicken was also dried but that's how it usually is. The asada was normal nothing special.",3o5RxAwstVARRW-SW66T6g,0,0,2,PlLQm-pLfvKzGASjRq-O4Q
