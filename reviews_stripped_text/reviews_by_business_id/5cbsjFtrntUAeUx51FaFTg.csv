The margaritas were so good and the nachos were to die for. For our entree we shared a taco sampler with a fish taco, pastor and asada. Let me say that I'm from SOCAL and I know my Mexican food, Agave is authentic and delicious loved the whole meal. 

A special shout out to our server, Larissa, she was the best server we have had...ever!!!! Attentive, fun and not pushy or always coming around. We don't get to Vegas often....luckily we are headed back in December and we can't wait to visit Agave again.

92980,2009-09-03,0,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"Wow, I can't believe it took me this long to try Agave. I will definitely be back again soon. Here's the rundown.

The building looks a little out of place with it's eccentric architecture in the middle of a bundle of chain restaurants. However, once you step inside I felt like I had been transported to another place.  We chose to dine outside and even though the parking lot and busy road were on the other side of the wall, we didn't notice. There is a lot of outdoor greenery, a waterfall, and at least two fireplaces.  Very cozy benches and chairs for outside dining also.

On to the food: some of the best salsa I've had in a long time. 3 different types come with the free nachos. The guacamole was pretty good, but I could pass on it next time as it was pretty filling.

Blue Corn Crab cake: Outstanding! Again one of the best crab cakes I've had in a long time also. Quite tasty and the perfect sized portion.

The cocktails were good as well - not too strong but went down well in the warm, outside air. I need to try the tequila flight next time...

Entrees: Taco sampler: GREAT. Crispy, soft taco shells (I know right??! But yes crispy AND soft!). Also had the Tampiquena Style steak: tasty but a little over seasoned (too salty?). Would pass on the steak next time and get more tacos or another dish.

We were much too full for dessert but there were some tempting options.  

Service was a tad slow and not as attentive as I'd like but I've also come to unfortunately expect that in Vegas when there are few other diners outside. The shaded area outside is misleadingly cooler than I expected, likely prompting the other diners to stay inside who wish to avoid the Vegas heat.

Our server did tell us about their great sounding Happy Hour: 4-6:30pm and 10pm - closing every day: 25 cent tacos and $1 mini Coronas.  (can you say bucket of beer?)

I'm confused as to why Agave isn't one of the more hopping late night spots in Summerlin (maybe it is but word of mouth is slow??) since it's got a great atmosphere, decent bar area, great outdoor dining, and the solid happy hour. I'd much rather hang here than some spots at say Boca Park that always seem to be bustling.

The best part about Agave? VALUE. The prices were reasonable.

Ten minutes after they seat us the three of us at a table for six, they want to move us to a booth . Really?Sky high prices for bland tasteless food.  $16 for a carne asada burrito that was mostly beans and hardly any meat and zero seasoning. My wife had the carne asada tacos and they sucked also. No flavor and  $15 for three street vendor sized tacos. Great looking facility, nice waitress even though we never saw her because she was working 12 tables.

149608,2011-09-04,0,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"Let's get one thing straight - if you run a mediocre restaurant, the best way to get away with mediocre food is to make sure the liquor is good. 

Hubby and I stopped in to Agave for dinner last night, and the gal behind the hostess stand looked like she could not be any more pissed off and bored to have a job. (Suggestion to management - first impressions are everything. Get a host who wants to be there and can smile.)

We were seated in the adorable faux-Baja styled patio, and patiently waited for our server, and waited some more. Apparently, the servers must not be permitted to smile either. Oh, well not here to psychoanalyze the underlying issues of unhappy restaurant employees! 

Drinks arrived, and if there is only one reason to ever darken the door of this establishment - and there should only be one reason to do so - it is for the margaritas. These are not the margaritas made with high-fructose corn syrup sour mix. These margaritas are made with fresh lime juice and real sugar. 

Chips and salsa arrived, and I'm guessing the Sysco food broker forgot to replenish the factory-made chips, so that must be the reason the restaurant was forced to serve stale chips. Stale, like when you find a half-empty bag in the back of the pantry with an expiration date of 6 months past. Yuck.

The salsas. Where. To. Begin. The food broker must have negotiated a sweet deal on sugar and passed it down to the restaurant. With all this surplus sugar, what to do? Hmm, let's add it to all 3 of the salsas as a sugary food preservative! Yes, that's right. Nothing pairs better with stale chips than overly sugary salsas that are equally as stale. 

So with a little tequila pulsing through our veins, we decided to ignore the stale chips and sugar salsas, and proceed with an order of ceviche. At this point, you must be thinking that if the chips and salsa aren't fresh, it may be unwise to order raw shrimp. We live a little dangerously now and then.

Let me preface by saying that we prepare ceviche at home on a weekly basis. Good ceviche. Fresh ceviche. We know seafood. This ceviche was not fresh. It was at best prepared early in the day, and left to it's own devices in a restaurant cooler for 6 or more hours. This is not how ceviche is to be prepared. 

We each ordered the taco sampler plate. Bland, flavorless. The rock shrimp was not fresh. (Surprise, surprise). The cabbage slaw tasted like what KFC prepares -sweet. The tacos al pastor were heavy on the cinnamon and sugar. The sugar fairy's hand was heavy on the side of rice as well. The beans might as well have been poured from a can. If you run a restaurant, don't bother serving a side if you are not willing to take the time to prepare it properly. The beans were cooked too quickly, leaving the texture hard and flavorless. Not worthy of gracing the side of a plate in a Mexican-themed restaurant.

If you find yourself heading towards this restaurant, do yourself a big favor. Eat dinner somewhere else first! Find a locally owned restaurant  
where the food is prepared with fresh ingredients by chefs who love food and love foodies. Your mouth will thank you.",m4z8cJqZaJFvIi9-tfGc2w,0,0,2,JHsB-3Y3Vsblsce13CZLHw

220622,2010-12-07,1,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"I had a wonderful experience here with my dad, we were returning from one of his random excursions from the Red Rock Canyon, on one of our random trips to Las Vegas.  Our overall experience was a delightful one.  How we came upon it was by chance, we spent most of the day climbing (read: getting lost) around the canyon, and driving the roads surrounding the Red Rock, mind you, on a pratically empty tank of gas.

I related to my father the concern of entirely running out of gas and having to make our way back to civilization on foot.  A prospect he wasn't worried with, being that he had survived escaping from the Khmer Rouge, running from Cambodia down to Thailand, by himself, with a bag of rice and three gernades (his words, not mine!).  That story will be for another time when I yelp about some of the riverside restaurants in Cambodia's countryside.

So back to the review.  I forget what we had, it was Mexican, there was fish, tacos, and tortillas-like things that we devoured being that we were starving (read: I was starving).  All I can fully remember was the sweet, sinful, and down right obscenely delicious FRIED ICE CREAM.  Yes, FRIED ICE CREAM.  Not fried ice cream, oh no, all capital letters is all I can do to relate how it was all of the above.  I think I cried a little when I finished it...knowing I could not bring any home with me because it would be soggy and melted by the time we had to leave.

Once at the bar we each ordered a happy hour drink special and guacamole to start. That's about the last we saw of our bartender.  There were only 3 other people at the bar, and the restaurant was empty, but the service was unapologetically slow.  We had to flag down the bartender to order after he had left us for over half an hour with our guacamole and empty drinks.  He never came around to ask for our dinner order-we had to ask him to take it.

Well -  this was my last chance for this place - still not impressed.  
After all these years they are still making the same 3 salsa's, all which leave a lot to be desired.  
Their happy hour does not apply to outside seating which was disappointing, so the drinks were $8 - $10 each and were mediocre. 
I had the cucumber cilantro margarita which sounded so good & refreshing, but was too sweet and you couldn't really taste the cucumber or cilantro. 

We ordered the carne asada tacos & carne asada nachos.  
Both entrees were just ok.  Did not care for the carne - it was a little tough & salty.  The nachos were soggy, salty & had little toppings.  

Our server was not personable and made us feel like it was work for him to break our check into seperate bills... when we had one drink & one entree each.

526112,2011-05-17,0,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"Contemporary Mexican Food in Las Vegas - Big On Service Short on Taste.

The Situation:
I took my wife to Agave for Valentines Day. I did a little research to find a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas that was a bit more ""upscale"" than the usual. 

The Atmosphere:
I found Agave Grill and Cantina on the extreme west side of town and it was listed as ""Business Casual"" which seemed fine: not too stuffy, not too casual. We arrived to find most people in jeans & t-shirts, so we felt a little over dressed but no problem. It just would have been nice to have a clear representation of the place in advance. The atmosphere was nice at first as there was a sort of stained glass window at the front and allowed for light to make the place feel nice. Once the Sun went down, it felt like this place became a ""Contempo-cave"" wrought iron balls hanging from the ceiling barely allowing light to escape. The bar occupied the center area of the room and the tables for dining around the outside circle of the room almost seemed an afterthought. The contemporary Latino music was a nice change for us at first and then it just continued to blare and the music was less and less distinguishable from song to song which then began to grate on the nerves. It really started to feel like a disco palace after it became dark.

The Service:
Service was very good, we had reservations for 5:45pm and arrived at 5:15pm. I figured we would just have to have a drink and wait it out but they sat us right away even though we were early on Valentines day no less! They were on top of things with drinks, chips and water coming out immediately, and consistently, food also was prepared well and not much of a wait at all. The waitress looked like she could have been a cocktail waitress at a club but which was in keeping with the atmosphere, but she was very nice, courteous, and helpful. Right off the bat when they offered us a $120 of champagne at ""half price"" and we didn't accept, the 'warmth' of the service declined a bit. Perhaps there is quite an emphasis made on customers that buy 'high ticket' items. At any rate, she and the other servers were also polite and really on top of things.

Appetizers:
We were immediately treated with a bowl of delicious black and yellow corn chips and an arrangement of 3 salsas. Each salsa had its own distinct flavor, seeming almost 'garlicy' so we ordered the guacamole for the chips and I was surprised to see, instead of the usual mini-cup, a gigantic bowl of guacamole! It looked like a 6 month supply! I was in heaven, until I tasted it. Then I was suddenly transported to a magic portal on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.

For my palette, it had a combination of sweet and garlic that just didn't work. In fact, for my taste, it was weird. In all fairness, my wife thought it was fine and the salsas as well, although she did agree that there seemed to be a bit of garlic added to the flavor. 

Drinks:
Not a lot to review here. They do offer a great selection of top shelf margaritas, tequilas, and wines. But their selection was limited when it came to imported beers and specialty drinks. We decided on a couple Pina Coladas but they were off the menu. The pricing on drinks is average for a restaurant in this category. We paid about $10 each for the Pina Coladas and the Margaritas looked to be about the same price. The drinks tasted great, a perfect blend of flavor and strength where the rum could be appreciated.

Main Course:
I ordered the shrimp & crab stacked enchilada while my wife ordered the chicken enchiladas. I would definitely recommend the shrimp and crab enchilada and I was informed that it is very popular for this restaurant. My wife also enjoyed the chicken enchiladas. Both Entrées came with beans and rice both of which, again, tasted very strange. I've eaten Mexican food all over Mexico, San Diego, New Mexico, and Arizona, and I have never tasted such a weird sweet/garlic sugar spice kind of flavor on most of the food. I just didn't get it. I'm all for something new, but this was just weird. Prices were very reasonable in my opinion, I paid $19 for my dish and couldn't finish it all, (probably too many chips) and my wife's dish was about $17.

Overall:
Agave was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for us, literally. We will experience that place only once and hopefully never again. What was cute and cool for the first 10 minutes, became annoying and irritating for the rest of the night. The food was pretty weird tasting (how do you mess up rice and beans?) but the prices were good and the service was great.

Recommended:
No - I get great service from the Sanitation Dept. it doesn't mean I would go there to eat anytime soon.

Vegetarian Friendly: Yes

Tips and Menu Recommendations This place is usually pretty full so definitely call ahead with reservations if you want to guarantee a spot. Try the shrimp and crab stacked enchiladas - only thing that wasn't really that weird.",ro8742KCi6hzpjjiM_25rw,1,0,2,KoUVlq1yxE05if2-rVakAA

I grew up in Southern CA and have seen Mexican food from mom & pop hole-in-the wall joints to the latest trendoid fantasies.  I think Agave is the best ""upscale"" Mexican food I've encountered, by a large measure.  The margaritas are exceptional as well.   Also, if you ask if they have any hotter sauce than the three they serve by default, they have a nice Habanero based sauce that fits the bill nicely (I was there with my 84-year-old mom who grew up eating hot chilies on a farm, and likes her Mexican food *hot*).   I ordered a black-bean, chicken & grilled veg burrito (I forget the exact title of the dish), that was world-class, the treatment of the sauce & cheese on the outside reminded me of some of the best Italian calzone's I've had, and the flavor of the components inside was truly awe-inspiring.  The service was excellent and friendly too.  I'll be back to try some of their other goodies, and soon, as Agave was an incredible taste treat.  The only thing I could find wrong with it if I was extremely picky, was the music was a little louder than I would have liked (weekend at peak of dinner though, so it was not all that unexpected).   I'd go there just for the margaritas, if that was all I was after, as the house margarita was exceptional, and I tried one other which was equally good-- in itself no mean feat, making a really good margarita is an art, and I'd say at Agave, there are artists in both the kitchen and the bar....",f2pYg0uT3Xd7TnovQspisA,0,0,5,5VWmXlFHOHhZ0Tj_SuzSpQ

I've been here twice so far and while I haven't been able to try everything on the menu yet, the few items I have eaten were simply delish! I too was there on Xmas and when I was there it was full of people and they were actually understaffed so service was a little slow but they still managed pretty well - food was on our table within 30 minutes. That just gave me more time to drink some of their swell Tequila offerings. Yes, it's also a fabulous Tequila bar that goes far beyond the standard bottle of Patron. While they do carry around 30 brands of Tequila I wish they would expand this even more to include some boutique brands, some newer brands, and even a few well established brands that they don't carry. That would really complete the full Tequila experience.

My favorite thing was the Civiche.  They did make strong Margarita's.  The average meal price was $12-18.  My Cheese Enchiladas were $13.00!

The one thing Agave has going for them is their ambiance and patio.  The patio has 4 fire places and the option to sit at the fireplaces (couches) or tables.  The service is less than average.  We waited for a host to show up to seat us for 5 minutes.  The server continually forgot to check on us and we had to ask twice for waters.

The fish had an old fishy flavor and I couldn't get past it. If I'm able to eat fish sauce like it's ketchup, I think I have a pretty good tolerance of seafood/ocean taste.

Service: Once again, on and off.  While it's not the waiters fault per se`, we've had an hour wait for the food there more than once. One time we didn't get chips/water until the appetizers came, other times immediately. When it was immediate, there were much more people in there, so I cannot blame it on coming at a busy time.

1962774,2012-02-28,0,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"I'm drafting my review while sitting at my table. Oh.my.god. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REAL AGAVE?!?!?

Let me make this clear, I am reviewing Agave based on this visit as well as compared to previous visits. 

Originally, we used to LOVE this place. We even recently talked it up to a couple of people (and once I remember who they were, I can recant everything I said!), without knowing it has changed so drastically in the past few months that we haven't been here.

It took longer than 10 minutes to get greeted by our server and have our DRINK order taken. Really? 10 minutes? We were ready to order by the time we were greeted. We were told the menu had changed just that day. Everything was more.... Tex-Mex. Nothing looked the same, and this is the second time we found ourselves disappointed in the menu items. The atmosphere was loud and felt a bit rushed, even though we had to wait FOREVER for anything. 

Honestly, if I hadn't already purchased a Groupon, I would have walked out within the first 5 minutes of NOT being greeted/offered a drink. 

The food was over-seasoned, but not in an authentic way. Not the way it used to ""WOW"" you. This was more.... Americanized. More disappointing. If I wanted the American version, I sure would have picked somewhere cheaper and closer to home. 

I ordered the filet fajita. The boy ordered nachos without jalapenos and chicken quesadilla. He still got the jalapenos and the quesadilla tasted funny. Like... funny aftertaste you can't wash out fast enough kind of funny. He took one bit and couldn't eat anymore. 

Also, one drink is apparently all you get. We finished our drinks and it took 25 minutes, yes, you read that right, 25 MINUTES to get a refill of a glass of water? The place is multi-leveled, and the other tables in our servers section seemed to be getting decent service, so maybe there was something about us?! I don't know, but I know I will NEVER be going back, which is a real disappointment, considering how IN LOVE with that place I used to be.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,4,1,1,w0rzTHB37KiekW69vZq5sQ

2223003,2011-06-30,1,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"It's a beautiful premises: twinkly lights, curving ramps, grove-like outdoor seating, El Dia de los Muertos shrines, puffy-leather menus, and brave pinks and oranges brought to submission in the dim, blue-hued light. 

If no one had ever opened their mouths, including us to put in the food, that's how I'd remember Agave now - a food-serving fairyland that (judging by the kids hanging out of booths and the jeans, and I mean under-$30 jeans) anyone would feel comfortable visiting.

The bad feeling started with the hostess, whose ""Can I help you?"" and expectant face implied that she wasn't there to help obviously lost people find their way to the Olive Garden around the corner.

Ignoring the bad start, we were led (by another hostess whose picture can be found in the dictionary under ""aloof"") down the ramp to a booth near the bar. As I said, it all looked very pretty. I was excited.

When our server came to take our order, we asked if they had lemonade. Yes, she replied. What she didn't tell us was that this lemonade wasn't refillable. No problem, but usually a server will tell you if the lemonade is fresh, not a soft drink, when you order so you can decide if you're looking for a ""drink-drink"" or just something to slosh down with the meal. We live in a society where soft drinks usually include iced tea and lemonade, so a it's the waiter's job to clarify if necessary.

And this lemonade? Not fresh. 

Also not cheap at five bucks each, which we didn't know until we saw the bill.  Soft drink prices - or juice prices, if you will, since she explained that lemonade was not refilled because it's considered a juice - aren't listed on the menu. (Nor does the menu list the soft drinks available, which would've nipped this problem in the bud.) 

For five bucks a glass, lemonade shouldn't taste like diluted sour mixer with an ice cube in it. For five bucks, at least garnish the rim.

But water is always nice, and we didn't know the cost of our single glasses of lemonade yet, so our anticipation was still high. 

Another waiter brought out three salsas and a basket half-filled with chips. Each salsa - a sort of guajillo, a verde, and a rojo - was very watery and sweet. Different from the usual, but definitely sugary. We were hungry, though, and it wasn't terrible, so we munched and looked forward to the appetizer.

We had decided to start with the bean and cheese dip. It sounded fantastic: ""puréed pinto beans with chipotle peppers, tecate, fresh cilantro, Mexican cheeses and fire roasted (sic) serrano peppers."" 

It definitely looked appetizing. [See my photos here on Yelp.] Unfortunately, we'd finished our half-basket of chips while waiting for the dip, so now we had no way to eat it. The server had left before we could look down and realize we needed chips. Service here was bizarre, and it wasn't just with us. As I watched the room, it was like seeing a fleet of Jan Bradys who wanted very badly to impress in their roles of Cuisine Facilitation Managers, but who didn't have the nerve to look any lower than our foreheads. Very ""on,"" very vacuous.

We laughed, but we wanted our chips. Eventually we flagged down someone, and much later the chips came, by which time the dip was getting cold. It's okay. We had used the broken chip-grit at the bottom of the basket to scoop up fingernail-sized amounts. The adventure of a new place is half the fun, we said. Good, because the dip? Bland. And? A little sweet.

What? Again? Is this their thing? Are they called ""Agave"" because everything has agave nectar in it? No, I truly ask.

For the main course I chose the potato tacos with mushrooms and Mike ordered the carnitas tacos. I love potato tacos. When in San Diego or Mexico proper, one thing I look forward to is some kind of potato taco. But really, I just love it when any Mexican restaurant gives this vegetarian the option of something other than cheese enchiladas, vegetable fajitas (too often a sad mix of broccoli and carrot), or a chile relleno. So, don't burn the taco, and it's probably going to be aces with me.

The tacos weren't bad. But man... they were... I'm sorry... I have to say it again... SO SWEET. I have no problem with sweet items for main courses or mixing sweet and savoury tastes, but I didn't get any sense of flavour here other than ""sweet."" Mike found his tacos ""weird."" ""Are they too sweet?"" I joked. ""Well, yeah...""

Needless to say, we skipped dessert. We'd had enough sweets.

I find the menu at Agave to be so interesting, and the property is soothing and fun, but the hospitality is nil and the taste is, to steal Mike's words, ""weird."" I like high-concept Mexican, and I could get behind one unexpectedly sweet dish, but the whole meal came down to an unremarkable single-note of sugar. 

And even if the food had been great, I'd think twice before returning to a place with service that was as unwelcoming as it was unprofessional. What a genuine disappointment.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,4,1,2,AiPrQBMWju4RwwhKZMD6aw

Drink Strength, Dessert, and Service gave them the extra half star.

I understand how someone could have a bad experience here.  When the tortilla chips and salsa's were delivered to the table they looked lovely, but lacked in flavor, texture, and were watery. Their blue corn tortilla chips were excellent but they only made up 10% of the chips in the basket, and the corn tortilla chips did not compare. Waiting and snacking on this appetizer doesn't put you in the right frame of mind - thinking that the rest of the food will be great.

   Two limes, some salt, and a bottle of cholula sauce later, 
   our Main dishes arrived and these seasonings saved the day.  

We started with the Potato Portobello Mushroom tacos.  The tacos were in theory a great idea, my Uncle loved them, but all I could taste was potato.  The flavor had a lot more potential.  They could easily be improved by cutting the Portobello thicker, and marinating the mushrooms before they're cooked.  Perhaps grilling some white onions cut long and thin would enhance the flavor profile too.

On the upside the Margaritas were pretty big, and reasonably priced for their size.  :-) This makes most Yelpers very happy. Well done Agave.

Our second dish that arrived was the Filet Mignon Steak Fajitas.  Priced at $16 this dish is incredible; the quality of the meat alone and the amount included warranted a much higher price. Rice, beans, and  fresh tortillas (the tortillas were delicious), definitely helped. These guys do not over season and I doubt they add salt.  So you're probably going to want to ask ahead of time for lime, something spicy, and some salt.  After I doctored up the Fajitas they were delicious.  They had potential, but didn't  quite live up to it.

In theory this restaurant is awesome.  Huge high ceilings, spacious booths, long wrap around bar, nice staff, fair prices, and all around plenty of parking in the shopping center they are in.  Really enjoyed our meal here.  I really wanted to give them a fourth star, but the flavors here just fell a little short. Now that's not to say that I wouldn't be back.  I will definitely come here again when I'm in the mood for Steak Fajitas.

Drink - holy crap. the margaritas were seriously strong. totally worth $5!

What amazed me the most was the operation.  They sold one dollar ""tickets"" at either end of the venue which you can pay with either cash or cards, AND they had an ATM machine right there, which completely eliminated the ""barrier of entry"" for people.

2593067,2012-02-07,0,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"I have been to Agave a handful of times and the thing about this restaurant, it's always something.

This time the food was great (vegetarian stuffed poblano pepper), much better than it has ever been before.  The ambiance was bold and fitting theme as always.  This time we asked to be in the bar area as it gets too dark to see your dining partners on the outer/upper level (learned that last time).  The hostesses were pleasant and accommodating. 

The thing that prompted a full review this time was the service.  There is no law requiring a business to run a groupon.  There is no law requiring a business to run a happy hour, even in Clark County (suggestion: there should be).  So...when a business chooses to do one and/or both of these things, they need to drop the attitude when people actually decide to take part in their promotions.

Our server was nice, attentive, she did call us ""guys"" repeatedly which was annoying, but overall she was adept with getting our happy hour drinks and making sure that we got vegetarian black beans instead of the non-vegetarian pinto beans, etc.  She was pretty great until the end of the meal. However, when we got the check to pay, we tried to use our groupon.  Apparently Agave doesn't allow use of groupons with happy hour items, despite it not being clear in the groupon text.  This is a groupon that was about to expire so I guarantee this wasn't the first one she'd seen or the first time anyone had dealt with this issue.  

Our server told us that she would ask the manager how to process the groupon because we had some happy hour drinks and then regular food.  It was genuinely a whole ordeal.  The manager didn't bother to come over to speak to us, he kind of brushed her off and then we saw him watching us and avoiding our eyeline from across the bar area.  It was creepy.  He had the computer knowledge to separate the checks and then would only honor the groupon for our food, leaving $4 unused.

That's fine, and it would have been no problem if this man had had the jewels to come over and do his job and say something like, ""Hey, sorry our promotions don't cross...""  Truly this would have been their chance to gain future visits by not making it our problem at all and just processing the entire thing.  They are willing to tussle over $4 on a $60 check?  

That's bad business and it ruined our experience.  We won't be giving Agave another chance.  Three strikes, you're out.",Wa_dytXjCuUri4CJsKSd3w,3,1,2,I1lih3-77sziOvVik_YUGA

We've always had good service, and we've always enjoyed the food.  It is pricey, though, so the food and service should be good.  Last night we sat on the patio, right beside one of their gaslog kivas.  We like how th patio is below grade, so you can't see the parking lot.  It is probably the best restaurant patio on the west side.  We were immediately served complimentary chips and salsa, but the chips were stale.  We didn't complain until we decided to order quacamole, which was delicious, and fresher chips were brought without complaint.  Our server had too many tables, but she worked hard and took good care of us.  Agave needs to step up and get cloth dinner napkins.

This isn't a standard Mexican restaurant where you can order the two-combo plate and know what you're getting. I would approximate it more with a semi-gourmet mexican restaurant that puts a little spin on their dishes. 

I got the crispy beef machaca burrito and was fairly impressed. It wasn't necessarily a culinary adventure but it was pretty decent food. The prices are on the higher side than most Mexican restaurants, but they do have some happy hour specials that bring the drink cost down. 

Service was good, the waitress was very nice but the wait from when we sat down to when she first came to get our drink order was a little long. Probably not her fault, but they had bus boys with chips and salsa walking around who could have at least checked in with us beforehand.

With the taco sampler ($8.95) you get to choose which three tacos you'd like to try. Among the choices are carnitas, potato and mushroom, rock shrimp, fish, chicken, and carne asada. My wife and I split the platter, with her ordering a potato and portabella taco (yukon gold potatoes, stewed with chipotle peppers, caramelized onions, spicy tomato sauce and queso fresco) and me getting two al pastor tacos (achote marinated pork shoulder with grilled pineapple serrano salsa and lime).

Ordered:  
Freshly made Guacamole
Authentic Plancha Fajitas (see overall section for details)

Pros:
* Atmosphere:  Every time I come here, I admire the interior design and landscaping
* Spacious/Comfy booths:  Over-sized booths that can accommodate larger parties
* Guacamole:  I'm a fan of Guac and I've gotta admit that this place has killer Guac

Cons:
* Lunch Menu was pretty much the same as the dinner aside from price of  the tacos

Overall:
I really like this place.  Inspiring architecture partnered with some good food and service is a win!  Jade and I ordered the Fajitas which are meant to be shared.  There is an option of meat and we asked if it was possible to combine two different meats (which Agave happily accommodated).  We chose the grilled Filet Mignon & Tequila marinated Rock Shrimp.  It was served with a side of spanish rice, 3 warm tortillas (each),Pinto beans, Guacamole, Escrema, and Salsa.  The Filet Mignon/shrimp combo came out on a sizzling platter.  It was a towering portion and I felt as if could have been shared among 4 friends with no problem.  It was incredible, especially the shrimp!  They shrimp themselves were huge and so full of flavor!  I definitely recommend this for people looking to share.  Guacamole (as mentioned earlier) is also highly recommended!  We went this past Friday during lunch hour and there was no wait.  

Tips:
* If you're a fan of Margaritas, Agave was a wide variety to choose from.
* If you are dining in the evening, there is an outdoor patio (too hot for the day)
* The restaurant sits behind Islands restaurant

Service was also unmemorable, as wait staff did not check on why the meal was half eaten to inquire if there was an issue.

When we arrived it was 9:50pm (10 min to happy hour), so we took our time perusing through the menu and ended up ordering Fresh Fish Tacos, 
Crispy Fried Machaca Beef Burrito, and two margaritas at happy hour price ($5 ea). 
Even though it was happy hour, the place was really empty, but I actually prefer it that way. The ambiance is so beautiful at night. All the warm colors and small dangling lights just made me feel like I was having dinner under the stars. 

We got complimentary chips with three different salsas. I'm not sure of the names so I'll just call them bright red, dark red, and green. My favorite was the dark red salsa. It was mild and had a fire roasted taste to it. The chips were fresh and crispy, just how I like them. Sometimes when I go to a Mexican restaurant that gives complimentary chips, they're stale or undercooked, but that wasn't a problem here. The fish tacos had a poblano pepper slaw inside that Don really enjoyed. They also came with rice and beans. The only thing he didn't like about them was that they came on flour tortillas instead of corn. The Crispy Fried Machaca Burrito was huge! Look at this beast: http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UtxbOEWhfmNajcmfRZuMLQ/l.jpg. Even though I was practically starving, I still couldn't finish more than half. It was delicious though. It had shredded-dried beef with fresh avocado, Mexican rice, refried black beans topped with red fresno sauce and melted Mexican cheeses. If you've read any of my past reviews, you know I love avocado and rice in my burritos. The black beans instead of pinto beans were an added bonus. This was actually the first time I've had a crispy fried burrito and I really enjoyed the crispy outer layer. I felt weird eating a burrito with a knife and fork, but seriously, it was smothered in red sauce. I would look like a monster eating a baby if I just picked it up with my hands. 

All in all,I still love Agave. Last time I went was at 11am when they just opened, so there was nobody there, which made for a peaceful breakfast.

When I got there, it went downhill from there.

It was like they only had one waiter for the ENTIRE restaurant.  We waited forever for our drinks, our chip refills, our order.

Rock Lobster Guacamole for an appetizer to complement the chips was good.  The chips ran out and we waited 10 minutes for more.

Our main entrees were OK.  Refills never happened.  After waiting patiently for 30 minutes for our waiter to return, we went and talked to an employee - who was the hostess (hopping around merrily and fraternizing with her friends) while service just went down, down dooooown hill.

Well, we were talking to the hostest saying our waiter was nowhere to be found and she condescendingly says ""he's been helping you!  He's at your table.""  (and he wasn't.)  Then when we walked back to the table I saw her giving my wife a very dirty look.

I'm done with this place.  Agave needs to seriously look at how they're treating their customers.  It is a shame that this restaurant is taking up space in Summerlin when a restaurant that cares to give customer service and EARN their money could be here instead.

Arrived at 8:45pm.  Got our check at 9:55pm.  Be prepared to waste an entire night if you dare venture here.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,8,1,1,xjM-eP4B8yl-4Z0emlL5GA

I have read about Agave and their great happy hour, so I decided to take the fiancé out for some cheap beers. Or so I thought. 

We drove up and the parking lot was fairly crowded so I thought it was worth it. Walked inside and the decor was cool. Bright colors and nice decs, followed by quick service and our beers as promised. 
Two rounds later we're good and decide to grab the bill and eat else where....then it goes bad.

Being our first time we walk up to the bar expecting happy hour prices when ordering from the happy hour menu, but that's not what happened. We ordered Modelos, which were advertised at the front of the restaurant BTW, as well as on Yelp, for $3, and were charged $5.50.  We were never asked what size beer we wanted nor told they were offered in other sizes which are more expensive DURING happy hour. 

Overall, I guess I expect the bartender to take care of customers and that is not what happened on our experience at Agave.",xsT38zXBXWOLBhfd9DOylQ,5,1,2,GzpXe6YEMy5uZch6yN_BKg

Inside and outside, it just feels cool, like you're in a good casino lounge.  Second, the food is delicious.  They serve a full menu during the day, and a late night menu after 9pm, I believe.  They do stay open all night, I believe, so we usually go in when everything else is closed.  The duck quesadilla is really good, as is the carne asada burrito.

But the drinks are where Agave really stands out.  They have a list of specialty margaritas which run around $10 and are well worth it -- top shelf tequilas with unique flavors.  Personally, I almost always get the Tlaquepaque margarita (Casa Noble Crystal, fresh raspberries, Cointreau and fresh lime).  They also have a large tequila menu, and you can do a sampler of three tequilas for $12.

We experienced the WORST service ever here!
We came here celebrating a family members birthday and had a large group. 
20 people
They provided us with 1 server who also had other tables to serve. What?!?!?!
Yeah one server.. with 1 person helping her. Needless to say everything was super slow and not right. 
Several people had to ask multiple times for simple water refills. We finally just asked if we could have a couple of pitchers of water placed on the table so that we could help ourselves. We were told they couldnt do that. 
So you're saying that you're too busy to get us water yourselves and you're unable to allow us to help ourselves. Interesting. 
Again She was one person so almost EVERYONES order was wrong when it made it to the table. 
Besides that she was so overwhelmed that she actually forgot to take the order of several  people at the table until AFTER the majority of us had received our food! 
It was a cluster all around. 
The food wasn't the worst but the service was so bad that I couldnt even upgrade their star based on the food. Besides I had the shrimp tacos and they werent that stellar. I actually prefer the shrimp tacos from Cafe Rio!

I do like the building, both inside and out.  We did have good service.  We also were there in the late afternoon when there were few other people there.

I had the Steak ""Alambre"" style.  It was a tasty dish that could have used some more heat.  My wife had the Mayan Chicken Tamales.  She liked them but thought they were spicy hot (they weren't) and she thought there was no chicken filing until deep down (there was but it was bland and you couldn't distinguish it from the masa).

When I checked my email later, I received one from Open Table saying that Agave had cancelled my reservation.  I don't know why, but that means no open table points.

3993300,2010-05-26,0,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"So I thought I would try out the famous Agave happy hour, in spite of their recent price increase for their happy hour tacos.

Well, the biggest problem and the reason I only gave this place two stars is the terrible service, from beginning to end.  Walking in, there was no host/hostess even though the place was empty.  So after waiting for the host to show up and clarify the hours of happy, I picked an empty seat (out of many) at the bar. 

I knew they had tacos for happy hour, I thought they might have other happy hour specials, but they only have two types of tacos: chicken and beef.  The limited selection was very disappointing.  I ordered two of each and was expecting somewhat larger tacos (6+ inches) full of mexican style, protein goodness.  When they finally arrived, it was a let down to be sure.  The tortilla was a little larger than normal, but the amount of filling (meat + lettuce + cheese) was about the same amount you get at any taqueira.  And at $2 a taco, that makes them at the upper end of the price range for tacos.

So the REALLY bad service happens while I am eating my tacos.  I finished my ice tea long before my order even arrived, but my drink was not refilled until I was finished with three of my four tacos!  In spite of the fact there were three bartenders working, the bartenders walked past me several times seeing my empty glass, and there were only 5 people sitting around the bar.  They seemed more focused on getting ready for the dinner rush.  After finishing my initial four taco order, I ordered two more tacos and started in on the chips and salsa (complimentary).  By the time I had finished the two additional tacos and the chips, my ice tea had only been refilled two more times for a total of four times.  That may seem like a lot, but considering I had to flag the bartender down two of those four times, it was unacceptable.

Unless they lower the prices of the happy hour tacos back to $0.25, I doubt I will be going back.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,1,0,2,PTBDrnXl18HeyyhDeVaPiw

He's mexican so he's extremely picky about his tacos and the only thing that killed it for him was the coleslaw that came on all the tacos.

I was craving Mexican food only to find out the Cabo Cantina inside Red Rock is closed and will be turning into a Lucielle's BBQ in the future.  Therefore we decided to head over to Agave.

On a Saturday night I put in a reservation for 8 through Opentable and ended up arriving 45 minutes early.  The hostess told us no problem and sat us down within 5 minutes.  

The one thing that stood out at Agave was that the chips and salsa was already on the table before we were seated.  This is a welcome sight from some Mexican restaurants where you have to wait for a server before and chips and salsa is served.  The other thing is there are 3 different types of salsa served with the chips (mild, pecante and a green).

My party ordered a pitcher of the Agave Margarita and it was just so-so.  It didn't stand out at all.  We passed on ordering a second pitcher.

In terms of the food, I ordered a Machacha burrito and it was delicious.  The shredded beef wasn't dry and was cooked just right.  My wife had the fajitas and the only complaint she had was that the Spanish rice was kind of bland, a little too starchy.

Overall, the service was good, the food was good, the Margaritas could use some help and the prices are a little high for Mexican food ($12-$20).

It's a beautiful restaurant; a lot of care has clearly been put into decorating it both inside and out. I loved the artwork, the metal and wood fixtures, the various types of lights hanging from the ceiling, the brightly painted walls.

Our waiter brought chips and salsa to start, and these were head and shoulders above what you get at many Mexican restaurants. The chips were warm, thick, and sprinkled with some kind of large-grain salt, and there were three small bowls of salsa to choose from, presented on an iron serving apparatus. J. and I both ordered taco platters, and we both had chicken and grilled fish versions, and for our third tacos, she had carne asada, and I had birria (goat). Outstanding! Flavorful meat, fresh tortillas. My margarita was tasty enough, but it wasn't as huge as it looked in its jumbo-sized glass -- there was a lot of ice. Still, a nice way to cool off on a hot day.

I've been here twice and the food ranged from extremely disappointing to mediocre. I tried the fajitas and the shrimp burrito the first visit there. The fajitas were nothing special and the shrimp burrito, which was very large, only had four shrimp in it. Four shrimp in what looked like a pound and a half sized burrito! I shouldn't have to start an expedition into the burrito to find the illusive shrimp. This just won't cut it, I was basically eating a bad salad wrapped in a tortilla trying to pass off as a burrito. 

My second visit I had learned my lesson and stayed away from the food. My friend, not heeding my words, decided to order some tacos. And of course the end result was...... bland tacos. The tacos at Del Taco are more flavorful.

Not all is bad at Agave though. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, and good drinks. They also have the largest selection of tequila I've seen and surprisingly good chips and salsa. At least they got something right. All this doesn't make the food taste better though so I can only recommend this as a place to get some drinks and eat some chips for the tequila enthusiast.",eSo5hmAF_UW1N5XFsx0q7Q,3,2,2,4Hcy6QfhwwiUnZ69uNyf8A

4818592,2011-08-07,1,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"My initial impression walking into Agave was a little skeptical. I had read a few reviews about this place and wasn't really sure what to expect upon arrival. The hostess was a little strange and seemed slightly aloof since she wasn't sure if we could sit out at the patio. Thankfully we found the bar quickly and immediately made it our base. 

The happy hour was our initial interest in coming here since we heard great things about the tacos and margaritas. An odd time frame for the happy hour but still interesting and amusing, the happy hour starts at 4:02 till 6:37 and after 10 pm daily. We sat down at big comfy swivel bar stools that served well in aiding to our experience. The ambiance in the whole restaurant is very eclectic and I wasn't really sure the exact theme of the place since the decor ranged from bright pink walls adorned with stained glass windows to high birch wood ceilings with great light fixtures that included Moroccan style star lanterns and large multiple pronged rustic chandeliers. The bar itself is the focal point of the entire restaurant. Smack dab in the middle this giant wrap around bar with 6 flat screens and every exotic tequila imaginable; including a bottle of Patron that goes for 65 bucks a shot! 

Finally on to the good stuff! Jointly we ordered every happy hour taco available. We tried 1 al pastor, 1 lamb, 3 chicken, and 9 carnitas tacos. As you can tell we fancied the carnitas tacos and for good reason too. Dripping with juices these tacos were garnished with freshly prepared cactus body salsa. 

This place has all the right ingredients for a 5 star restaurant. The only reason I'm holding back on the 5th star is because of their margaritas which I thought were a little too sour and not strong enough which might only reflect the skill of the bar tender. 

Lastly, I had a few words with the manager about the restaurant and the progress and current state of the place. He told me there were many improvements in store for this place. I'll definitely be back to check Agave out in the next few weeks. 

This is an excellent place to investigate, make sure you catch the happy hour!",FinuLbBaMhW-dS67BwkpZA,2,0,4,efcF-bfH40eket70rTBGiw

In the good ol' days, I adored their happy hour .25 mini tacos, alas they no longer do that, and so I had not visited recently. However, when staying at Red Rock and in need of some late night eats not served in a casino cafe, we decided it would be the perfect spot!

I do enjoy the Spanish adobe on acid interior. Just walking through the huge wooden doors and into the noteworthy interior is an experience worth having just once. On this evening, we decided to sit at the bar, in fact we have never sat anywhere else at Agave. The nice thing about their bar is that it is gigantic, and only half of the countertops have video poker machines. You don't have to balance your salsa trio between screens!

Speaking of the salsa trio, if you fiend for free chips, then here is a place that does it right with not one, but three salsas! I am a fan of the tomatillo. The chips themselves are nice and fresh.

I had had some red wine, so my husband convinced me to go for the steak fajitas for two thinking I could eat more of the veggies. The plan didn't work out exactly as the steak fajitas are literally a mountain of steak with very few veggies. I am not complaining, as the true spirit of steak fajitas should be the steak! The steak was kind of bulgogi-like, which wasn't a bad thing. Not bad. The menu says the meat is from a filet. The serving was enough for 9-10, nicely portioned fajitas! The rice and beans, however, were not so great. The rice was a little stale and the beans were lacking in flavor. I was sad because I love rice and beans.

Service wasn't spectacular, but our bartender was very friendly. Definitely a good lady to share a drink with.

This place is a great experience. All the furniture and silverware and plates and even the bar were made in Mexico and imported exclusively for this restaurant! The walls are pink/green/red and very colorful with a high cieling in the bar area. There's an awesome patio for drinking margaritas on the cool(er) Las Vegas nights.

The food is Mexican, but tries not to be Tex-Mex (though it still is sometimes). They have duck quesadillas! The winner is the free chips (fresh) and salsa (three kinds - all awesome - all free!).

We had a Groupon that was set to expire, and taxes to do. Since we were already on that side of town, rather than get a refund on the Groupon, we figured we would satisfy our craving for some delicious food from Agave, once we finished filling out mounds of paperwork for the IRS.

We arrived around 7:30pm, and to our surprise, the place was hopping! This is usually a good sign, as it means a) the restaurant is still good; b) the economy is coming back so people can afford to eat at Agave! The hostess informed us that it would be about ten minutes before we could be seated. Not a problem, they looked busy, so we sat down and played some games on our phones. 

It was close to ten minutes later that we were seated and informed our server would be with us in a moment. Having a penchant for sitting in sections with absentee servers, we make it a habit of checking the time when we get seated. This is where one star gets knocked off from a five star potential... It took over 8 minutes for water and chips to be delivered & our drink order taken. 

A couple minutes later, our drinks arrived, along with the chips and three flavors of salsa. We began munching on those while wondering what happened to the restaurant. The new menu is one, big piece of paper. No more do you get the hefty, and very cool leather bound book of a menu. When asked when that change occurred (as we were last in toward the end of summer, and it appeared that new bad reviews were cropping up recently - thought maybe the new menu had something to do with it) - no, the new menu was new for that day. Supposedly, there were only a couple items taken off, but it appeared that the menu was drastically changed. Another star removed, the old menu had some very good food that we couldn't find on this menu.

Our server, a gentleman I can't remember his name, started doing the ""I am going to show off how smart I am by memorizing your order"" thing, until I started ordering my food. Then he brought out the trusty notepad to insure the proper items were ordered. Half a star returned, at least he knows one of his limitations.

It didn't take long before our food came out, it was delivered by a food runner, who dropped and ran. She didn't stick around to see if we noticed anything wrong with it. Of course, there was. I had asked that certain items be left off of my nachos, low and behold, they were ALL OVER the nachos. For over $10.00, the nachos were portioned pretty small, but were otherwise OK, aside from the additional ingredients I had asked not to have included. I was tempted to wait until our server asked how things were to get another batch made, I was later glad that I did not!

I demolished most of the nachos, and started in on the chicken quesadilla. I finished one ""slice"" of the quesadilla while also eating nachos, so it was a little masked. Once the nachos were done though and i had a solo bite of quesadilla, I wondered what I had just taken a bite of. Asking the wife if she would like a bite, she gave me the knowing, ""it's that bad look"", yet was a trooper and took a bite anyway. Her face confirmed it was not just me being picky. 

The chicken in the quesadilla had a strange texture and very ""off"" flavor to it. I can't quite place what was wrong with it, it was just very unappealing to my pallet.  Another star stolen away.

During this entire time of eating, we had never once had our drinks refilled. It was 25 minutes between getting our initial drinks before we saw the server again. This is why I was later glad that I did not wait for him to return the nachos. One more star gone. 

When our server did finally make his grand re-appearance at our table, he asked if I wanted a box for the quesadilla. He either didn't hear, or ignored, when I said, ""No, it doesn't taste good, at all."" There was no, would you like anything else, was it not cooked all the way, nothing. I asked if we could get our drinks refilled, my water was filled up, the wife's water, however, was only filled about 2/3 of the way. 25 minutes to get 2/3 of a refill? Seriously guy? Another star gone.

As the night went on, we lost more and more respect for a restaurant we used to thoroughly enjoy eating at, and just enjoying the ambiance of the dining area. The curved walls, high ceiling, decorative lamps and round windows all add a lot to the dining experience. If I build a custom home, I want my living room to be based on their dining room. It's that great of a building. Suppose, that is where the one star I have to leave them comes from.

One last thing, they changed the music to a more modern R&B type selection, with the volume turned up way too loud for a restaurant. It felt like we had to raise our voices to be heard across the table. We weren't eating at a club...

If you do happen to give this place a shot, at least use the restrooms, the sinks are very cool too!",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,5,1,1,9RWOqQhX3AICvYQrbmlidQ
5754452,2010-11-10,0,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"I have eaten here on 2 occasions. The first, about a year ago. The service at that time was good, but very sparse as there were not enough staff and the place was packed. The food on both occasions was excellent! I highly recommend the seafood burrito. The service we got on our recent visit was top notch. The waitress was on her game and it wasn't as busy so our water glasses were always full. I would definitely go here again based my recent visit.",I3E0WQMyDhkvfrLHVot00w,0,0,4,dkCg73zZiUMadTpZGYOlcA
5892969,2012-10-02,0,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"I dined on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant and bar were busy. I sat at the bar so I could enjoy the company of video poker if the mood struck. 
Shrimp & crab enchiladas ""stack""- the seafood should be the star of the dish, but it wasn't. I think the sauce didn't complement the seafood well, and there were too many tortillas. Overall, was so-so. For $19.95, I expect better. 
Rock shrimp chile relleno appetizer- this is delicious! A bargain at $11.95. Flavorful, with a yummy sauce and ample shrimp. 
Chocolate creme brulee with almonds- tasty, but lacking whipped cream. Very rich. 
Dulce leche milk cake- LOVED IT! Another bargain.
I was given a free dessert because the entree took a long time. Kudos on that!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,1,1,3,smhuGUp4NAxcloDy_CLA1g
5917265,2011-06-07,0,5cbsjFtrntUAeUx51FaFTg,"very very let down. service was super slow and food was garbage. I got the duck quesadilla thinking it was going to be great because of the reviews and everything but I was sadly mistaken. Perhaps I should have gotten the crispy quesadilla instead of the large soft one and there is where I went wrong. But in any case, the soft one is cut up and served covered in sauce and salad. So you have to eat it with a knife and fork. I am guessing my order was done and sitting for a while in the kitchen while they were finishing the other plates because it was super super soggy and had absolutely no other texture. It was super salty and very one-note. So maybe I was supposed to order the crispy small quesadilla or maybe this was a fluke on their part but I am not going back because of it.",k5w9EN9OOr0iM_xpu57a-Q,0,0,2,-MvE3G5wvJ_ysDmcXkE8bw
