20801,2010-09-27,2,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I know I'll be one of the few persons on Yelp to not rate Montesano's highly but it's an honest review.

After seeing so many 5 star reviews on Yelp I was really eager to try Montesano's. The general consensus was:

Great food
Good prices
Very warm and friendly service (this i truly appreciate nowadays)

Moreover it was near my neighborhood so I was really happy about finally finding a good place with good food, good prices and good service.

I decided to try pizza, pasta and several other dishes.

The pizza had a generic crust, crispy but nothing really special. The sauce was nice and chunky. The garlic however was completely overpowering everything and then it was the cheese. I don't know what sort of cheese they use but this one smelled and tasted rancid. Maybe some cheese aficionados will enjoy this rancidness but I didn't. Note that I didn't order a special pizza with weird cheese mixes. (If you're wondering I had to throw the pizza away since neither I not anyone else at my house liked it)

Their stuffed garlic knots are, as others have noted, deep fried and have cheese and pepperoni in them. Again the garlic was overpowering and the cheese taste was too much. They were also very greasy and heavy, probably due to the deep frying.

The pasta came with some small fried doughballs like garlic bread, only they were deep fried. Not really bad, they tasted like the stuffed garlic knots. The sauce was ok, nothing really special but decent enough.

I also tried their homemade canoli. The filling was sweet and generally fluffy.

As for the service I was really looking forward to that family like service everyone talked about. Maybe it was just me but even though I arrived on time my order (i ordered for takeout) was not ready, some items were not available and had to be substituted, most of the store was focused on an obnoxious young lady who kept complaining and arguing about the pastries.

I really wanted to like Montesanos and went there thinking I'd find my new favorite place to eat in the valley but I was very disappointed and won't go there again. I realize my review is probably the only negative, for now, but it is 100% honest and believe me you'd be pissed if you spent $70 on food and had to throw everything away because no one liked it.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,4,1,1,5q6ClGocF2gtDjMDU2ssAA

We're not much for Coke and booze, so we ordered water while we waited. Either it's raw tap or their filter is spent; it was awful enough that neither of us could take more than one sip. Do they make the dough with this bilge? It could explain a thing...

As for the pizza, they nail the cheese, the sauce is delish, and the oil was just right. It would've been one of the finest pies I've had, were it not for the crust. Structurally, it was a correct Bronx crust which held firm upon lifting. Constitutionally, its flavor was bland to the point of disappointment.

Even accounting for that, I wouldn't mind returning. It's better than ""A-OK"". But nowhere near five stars. Nowhere near.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,0,4,FgwP_kzHdHIkQSz9j2VySQ

We got there and there was a line so we knew we would have to wait.  They told us it would be 30 minutes and as we stood and then sat there, we realized that was what they were telling everyone.  We waited over an hour for a table but we visited with friendly people so it wasn't as bad.  We actually sat with a couple that we didn't know so that was kind of cool too.  Once seated, we discovered that everyone was waiting at least another hour for their food to arrive.  The problem is - the staff were not apologizing or explaining it.  Not once in the 3 1/2 hours that we were there, did one person ever say ""we're sorry for the wait"" or ""we're sorry but the kitchen is backed up"" or ""here is a 10% coupon for your next visit to thank you for being patient.""

I can't say enough GREAT things about this place.  Our Realtor brought us here when we first bought our home, and we've been regular customers ever since.  

The food has spoiled me for eating at other Italian restaurants - other places just don't measure up.  

The atmosphere is best described as a warm family experience.  The brothers show a sincere interest in making sure that everyone has been well fed.  In fact, it's almost worth the visit just to come observe their interaction with their 'friends'.  

I don't exactly recall their slogan - something about:  'Where the food tastes like love'.  I have to say, that is probably the best description of the whole eating experience.  You can tell that they've got a passion for their food, and a passion for their customers.

The only 2 downsides is that they don't deliver and sometimes the wait is a bit long. That being said, the wait is usually long because they are so BUSY!

282654,2011-12-11,0,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"As with reviewer Cookie B, I am also pained to have to rate Montesano's so low. I think that the food here is very good and worth the extra wait it often takes for the kitchen to prepare it. However, the front of house service here has continued to be hit and miss - miss to the point where I don't think it is worth it any more to come here. This experience tonight comes on the heels of one a couple of weeks ago, when I came in to buy baked goods from the case. The restaurant was busier at this point, but there were several people up front. I made eye contact with three employees - all of them looked at me and immediately and deliberately looked away. This was a sign, to me, that they didn't want to deal with their customers. I left that night and thus they lost my business. Tonight, after having deliberately planned to come early for dinner to beat any rush, we had another horrible experience. This time, we waited probably at least 10 minutes for a table in an otherwise slow restaurant. The problem with this was that one server said ""we'll be right with you"" and instead of busing dirty tables, went to mop out the bathroom. The young man at the front said much the same, but continued to stack cookies on a tray. Customers should always be a first priority, as should busing tables and keeping them clean. After that, the other issue had to do with who we were actually tipping (paying with credit card) - the server who brought drinks, the one who took our order (the same one who went to mop the bathrooms), or the one who brought out our food. At the end of the day, as much as I want to support a small business, this just isn't worth it.",SbGfX_Nk5DhiCBpBm7zdDg,4,0,2,HM4LBPpFm37t3wTo3FgSrw
286420,2012-10-18,0,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I've known the Brothers Montesano for a number of year. My wife and I used to go to their larger restaurant on the west side when it was still open. Whenever we go here, we are literally treated like family. We've been eating Montesano's food for years and we have developed our favorite dishes to the point where we almost always go for the same stuff. Regardless, they use fresh ingredients in everything they make. Its worth waiting the extra 5 minutes to have fresh food.

The scary part, dessert is the first thing you see when you walk in the door and the last thing you see when you leave. Its a slippery slope! The desserts here are all very large and can more than likely be split between 2 people. Don't be fooled, even after you've eaten a huge plate of baked ziti, you will STILL want to chow on one of these amazing looking desserts. Go with your gut on this. My wife loves chocolate, but I am weird and am not a huge choco fan. If you just want some light chocolate, or none at all, go for the cannoli. You can get it plain, or with chocolate chips. And they put it together right when you order it. Never order a pre-filled cannoli, thats weak!

I love this place, but I often wish their location was larger. These guys have a huge fan base and on some nights, it gets crazy just at the front door. The line here can pretty long. So hit this place on off nights, as Friday and Saturday night may drive you crazy. Regardless, try the Sicilian pizza and any pasta baked in the oven.",L-dCbkZxjPa1Z3YjMCrJYg,0,0,4,g18eJlcT7Pg3GcU9Xy4_6A

350840,2011-09-07,0,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"We were craving pasta for dinner.  So we found Montesano's on Yelp, and with all the high ratings we decided to give it a shot.  At that time they were also offering I think 10% off your bill if you mentioned Yelp on your first visit, so that was just a bonus.  They have such resonable prices anyway, we didn't even care if we had a discount.  We did see the menu ahead of time, so that also caught our interest.

On our first visit, it was packed and there was a wait which was a good sign on how good the place is.  You can tell that there are regulars that frequent here.  We waited for about 15-20 mins.  They have an extensive menu so there is something for everyone and you can keep going back and order something different each time.  We ordered slices of the White Pizza and Pepperoni Pizza to try out.  Their White Pizza was the best ever!  Now my hubby and I keep comparing any White Pizza to it.  We had Grimaldi's and there's wasn't so bad but not as good.  Montesano's just had better flavor and texture for us.  I can't remember now what dishes we got but I know we were really pleased with our selections.  The service staff were great.  It's a family owned restaurant, and as some others have mentioned that they may all be family working there.

Since our first visit we have come back several times, and a few other times have come back for take out, ordering something different almost each time with the exception of White Pizza which we always ordered.  On our last visit dining in, we came in on a late afternoon during the week and this time we beat the crowd and missed the dinner rush.  Amy was our server and she was very attentive and had my hubby's soda refilled even before he needed it.  So far we've been lucky to like everything we've tried.  It always feels like a good home cooked meal.  You can taste the quality and love in their food.

474849,2015-02-22,0,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I grew up in an Italian family back east and I two of my uncles owned restaurants, so I can confirm this place is the real deal if you want true Italian food.  I ate there last night with my gf and her son.  Surprisingly, for a Saturday night we were able to get a table within a half an hour which was awesome because we had been hiking at Red Rock Canyon earlier in the day and then went to a high school lacrosse game in the evening so we didn't have much energy left.  We didn't feel like cooking so it was a spur of the moment decision to pop in to Montesano's since we live just a few minutes away.

The food was spectacular.  We had the Veal Saltimbocca, Chicken Alfredo, and Chicken Francese.  They were good sized portions and we ended up having to take some of it home because we couldn't eat it all.  

The reason for the four star rating instead of five is that despite the short wait for a table, we put our food order in at 8:05 and didn't get it until almost 9:30.  We had been talking most of the time so didn't really notice how much time had passed at first, but when we realized an hour had hit we started asking about it and gradually became a bit annoyed as we had a long day and were tired.  We came close to leaving, but finally the food came out.  The server was very apologetic and said they had just lost a cook which was the reason why all the orders fell so far behind like that.  He comped our drinks for us and even offered us a free dessert, although I passed because we were full and at that point really just wanted to get home.

Assuming the wait for the food was a one time deal due to unusual circumstances I would definitely recommend this place if you want authentic New York Italian cuisine.  I do plan on returning again, myself, at some point because I do want to try some of the desserts they had in the case up front when you walk in.",Bf1tV5m4mrDgfCjVmme3ig,1,1,4,YGFHx_a8MrI2_M-TLiHokA

I have tried different things each time I've been there and every dish has been wonderful. I've never been disappointed. My all time favorite is the Cavatelli with Broccoli Rabe, a must try. The pasta melts in your mouth and the best way to order it is with a combination of sweet and spicy sausage. It is truly incredible. If you have enough of an appetite, with the incredible garlic knots that automatically come to the table, order the Stracciatella soup. It's so good and if you want to save room for dinner, you can eat just a little and they will put the rest in a container for you to take home. It's great for lunch the next day! Of course, you cannot skip dessert. Everything is great. We sometimes get a plate of assorted cookies, Tiramisu, or we'll bring home their Spumoni. 

The service is always great - very welcoming, friendly and they never rush you even though they are always crowded. Speaking of, since it is such a popular place, expect a wait. It's worth it. We decided order their pizza tonight and eat at home. Again, incredible. Best pizza we've had in Vegas.

The standouts so far:
-lasagna explosions - how can you say no to bites of lasagna that are breaded and deep fried??
-chicken parm - always a favorite and done well here
-chocolate cannoli - homemade and the shell is dipped in chocolate.

Food was pretty quick for pizza and nice and hot 
Cannolis were amazing! Best cannolis ever! I had the chocolate dipped ones, I will definitely be back for more. 

Cons
One of the pizzas we ordered was the Pizza Puttanesca which was a heart attach waiting to happen. Soooo salty and greasy- fried artichokes which I asked if they could not fry them, the waitress said she would check and let me know either way but didnt, I received them fried. Bad choice on my part. 
The other pizza we ordered custom and it was great, not my favorite pizza place ( I love Sammys Wood Fired Pizza) but it was good.

Even the waiter apologized several times and kept checking on out order.   Once we got it, there was an error with our order. They offered to fix it, but with such a long wait time we didn't risk waiting any longer.  The waiter did give us free cookies, which the kids appreciated.

The boyfriend and I had carbonara and spaghetti bolognese. We were absolutely underwhelmed. My pasta carbonara was overcooked and was just so dry with very few pieces of meat that wove through the linguine. Bf's spaghetti... ugh. We make better at home. 

Staff is very friendly! Bf did mention how he asked our waiter what their favorite item was -- and waiter didn't seem to have a favorite and prefers their pasta simple with garlic and EVOO. That worried us a bit. How can you not have favorites??

People seem to like their garlic knots but I've had much better at places like C&O in Venice, CA. Theirs was hard and dry.

A younger guy came over almost immediately to grab our drink orders.

We ordered French Fries to keep our little one occupied and they brought them out right away. She gave them two tiny thumbs up. My husband loved the Veal Parmesan. I ordered the meatball sub. It was excellent. The meatballs were extremely moist and the sauce was very well seasoned. A lot of times I can find sauces to be too salty but that was not the case here. Also, it was so big that I was stuffed after eating just half of it. I packed the rest up and it reheated awesomely in my microwave the next day.

If you are looking for non-chainy Italian food that taste homemade, this is it. It's as if a restaurant from Little Italy NY or the Hill in STL, grew wings and landed in this strip mall.

The garlic knots are fabulous and you have to hold yourself off from eating too many, so you have room for dinner. When we first came here, they were proper knots, but they are now garlic nubs. It still taste great though!

If you like calzones, they are perfectly made. You can order them baked or fried. If you don't like ricotta you can ask them not to include it. 

I personally like the sweet sausage, some of the best I've had with the perfect amount of anise. You can choose from about 4-5 pastas to compliment your meal. My favorite dishes are the sweet sausage with pasta, Braciole, spaghetti and meatballs, linguine with red clam sauce, meatloaf and spaghetti or any of the chicken dishes. The servings are big so you may have leftovers. 

If you are full, think about bringing home some treats from the glass case upfront. I always bring back rainbow cookies for my kid. The Italian cheesecake is out of this world, one of the best on the west coast.

Having said that, after about a 20 min wait, we were seated by a kind young man who immediately took our drink order. Our server was such a delight! She made us feel right at home, like the aunt who you love to visit because she loves feeding you great food. She recommended the eggplant parm and it was divine! My boys had meat raviolli and spaghetti and my hubby had the chicken parm. All were great dishes with generous portions. I'd come back even if it means having to tolerate the BIG grump at the front counter again.",DwIIgSGzmB43hFgvnowVZA,1,0,4,rofAPwnIbVIvvOMzQqPeLQ

   Pretty dang delish.... Nice chewy crust not to thick. We had mushroom, blk olive & artichoke hearts, then on one side I added hot italian sausage for the hubs~
   The sausage wasn't to hot, the only thing was I specifically asked if they had Unbreaded artichoke hearts, was told yes! Then ended up with Breaded artichoke hearts on the pie ~ not the worst thing just wished I would have been given the right info.
    Over all very good, not as good as Settelbello's however very different types of pizza in my opinion. Also this was purchased to go, so the 20 min ride probably didn't help. Microwaved before eating at home, still hit the spot and we would go back~
    Lots of desserts in this restaurant....all look wonderful. We have a Choc covered cannoli waiting in our fridge~ this I Know is DEEELISH as I have indulged in their authentic Italian pastries before. Simply ""OUT OF THIS WORLD!""",bdRS6ZRxf6CNrnULnMI1cg,1,1,4,Il7Rf_bCQBxXCOf15dy_xw

1479662,2015-08-02,1,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I like the way this pizzeria does pizza! It takes a deep-dish meat lovers pizza and turns it into a real pie with a crispy top layered crust. It is not a calzone or stromboli - it's a pie!  You can get a pizza several different ways here, but this is by far the way I would prefer to go because it tastes great and it's different. 

I ordered the 16"" pizza expecting to take home some left-overs, but I had no idea one slice each would fill us up! 

I ordered the ham stuffed garlic knots first - only to realize it is one knot.  You can't easily share one stuffed knot, so I ordered a side of regular garlic knots. We were not at all crazy about the bite sized garlic knots because they were mostly too crispy. I think they were in the oven too long.

For dessert, we had some of their cookies.They have a large selection of cookies and cannoli's. The one's I tried were very good. I even took some home.

The restaurant is not very big, but it is clean and comfortable. The staff members are pleasant and service was exceptional. The iced-tea was great.

1516610,2008-09-04,1,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT!!!! 

I've been going here for years! Ever since I was going to the real estate school next door, at their Sahara location (i believe this location is their only one now). I used to always get a couple slices of cheese pizza, and I was always amazed at how delicious a simple cheese pizza can be! They obviously use the best ingredients in order for something so simple to taste so amazing!

I've since moved to Los Angeles, BUT I DEFINITELY make plans to visit Montesano's every time I'm in town! TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THEY MAKE THE BEST PIZZA AND CAPRISI SALAD I'VE EVER HAD!!! I haven't tried much else since I don't get to go there that often anymore, I usually stick to pizza and caprisi salads. I remember the first time i took my girlfriend here, it was back in January, and she ordered the Carprisi salad (i hadn't had it prior) and it blew us both away! So this last time I visited them just several days ago, my girlfriend and i each ordered the Carprisi salad AND a small pizza. 

You guys get my point, this place is a gem buried in a hay stack! I used to live in Las Vegas, so i realize there is SOOOOO much competition in that town! Especially since tourists never leave the strip therefore making business even harder for places like Montesano's! I found this place by accident, and my mission now is for EVERYONE who can get to that side of town to try them! It's worth it! THE BEST PIZZA YOU'LL EVER HAVE, the freshest ingredients make for the best pizza, it's simple yet so many places manage to mess it up. 

Their service alone would make me go back, very friendly, they treat you like family here. I believe it's run by two brother and a sister. I think one of the brothers names is Sammy and the sisters name is Tony. I've yet to meet the other brother. Tony was there last time we went, she's extremely nice, and like I mentioned before, treats you like family, like someone she's known for a very long time. 

The atmosphere is perfect too! The place is just the right size and they have all booths, making your dining experience intimate with the people you're with. Funny italian posters don the walls here. 

BTW, they have wonderful Italian sweet here too!!!

I can go on and on and on about this place, I wish them all the best and I hope to go back VERY VERY soon! TO ANYONE FROM MONTESANO'S THAT MAY READ THIS... Thank you for your hospitality, your great food and for making my trips to vegas that much more worth it! See ya'll soon!",scu1qTGz6xsVKgW_-0Gmjw,2,2,5,DeFkkeqf4SihTd2QA-ARlQ

Just a little hole in the wall place in a strip mall on Eastern.  As a business owner myself, I know how difficult it can be to get staff to do what you need them to do on a consistent basis.   These guys knocked it out of the park.  Genuine smiles, eye contact and service.  Managers greeting arriving repeat guests by name. As I'm originally from the east coast I got a warm fuzzy hearing the New York accent of the manager.  The food was wonderful !

There is no shortage of Italian restaurants anywhere in LV/Henderson and the styles and flavors are endless. And like most food, everyone has their favorite, and their 5-star pick may be someone elses 2 star. Such is food, particularly ethnic food. Heck, we have even been to Italy for a few weeks and considered that to be some of the worst Italian food we had ever had...so go figure. Anyway, the food that we have had here is pretty damn good. Maybe not the 'best I have had anywhere', but very good nonetheless. The last time there, had the Spag and meatballs. The balls were huge and plenty of pasta, although the sauce was a little light, but they happily brought more. My wife went for the raviolis with a different sauce than mine, and it was great too. The restaurant was very casual, which is exactly how I like it. Don't shove tablecloths-candles-etc in front of me---I am there to eat.

I can't comment on the pasta or sandwiches but their atmosphere, pizzas, and pastry are great.

Pluses: Pizza cheese and toppings were all excellent, pizza prep was excellent, in sum this is probably the best pizza one will find in Vegas. Furthermore, it is difficult to find a restaurant that makes rice balls at all so having them on the menu was great

Reasons to reserve the 5th star: pizza crust lacks a lot of flavor, waitress doubted that I could eat a 14"" pizza,  pizza not extremely tasty when cold, rice balls not as good as grandma's (a selection of different fillings might be nice), price of pizza too high (~$12 for a basic cheese)",e3xXqCayE5Oo_xpgQifWWQ,0,1,4,CDNaPmX364tDBAyTLfjrfQ

It's a family owned Italian restaurant that surely makes you feel like part of theirs.  We had the pleasure of dining here for dinner.  Our waitress was just an absolute delight.  I think she was actually one of the family owners.  She had the 'mother's' care when waiting on her guests making sure my husband had enough water to balance out the beer.  Or giving a boy an extra cookie because he finished his entire meal.  It made us chuckle!  Makes you think of your own mom right?  

We started off with the Lasagna Explosions.  What are these you ask?  Lasagna noodles wrapped around mozzarella cheese deep fried with sauce to dip them in.  We had no problem finishing these off in a hurry!  Delizioso!  We also ordered the Pizza Diavolo~ spicy sauce with red and green peppers, fresh garlic and onion.  It had the perfect amount of spice for us with great flavor!  I would definitely order this again.  Not to mention the bread basket brought out prior to us ordering.  It was filled with tiny garlic knots and fresh baked bread.  I was probably full after munching on the knots...  they were so good that I didn't want to stop!

In our experience, you were made to feel welcomed like family.  Thank you Montesano's!

The other had pepperoni and anchovies. The pizza was only $13 but each topping added $2. Still a bargain considering the quality and quantity of the food.  Taken with the complimentary garlic knots, it was way too much food and we ended up bringing home about a third of each pie. The worst part was that none of us had any room for dessert (the case with the pastry when you walk in looked amazing).

I had been craving a decent Italian beef sandwich for awhile, so I ordered the Steak Pizzaola sandwich. This sandwich was perfect in every way: slices and chunks of steak, onions and peppers, slow simmered in a garlicky marinara, on a fresh Italian sub roll.  It was packed so full I had to pick at it open-face style for a good 5-10 minutes before I could pick it up.  I definitely got my fix.

Prices are decent, but do note, sandwiches are a la carte.  If you'd like a side of fries, they can be added and brought out PDQ.  My tea was decent - they don't reuse the tea leaves like many places in the Valley do to save money.  I finished with a small cannoli.  My very friendly and attentive server put it in and forgot it (she was having a bit of a day - allergies were kicking up), so without asking she brought me a large at no upcharge.

The only thing that surprised me about the sandwich selection (the usual Italian subs) was nothing with prosciutto, which I love.  (I miss the prosciutto sandwiches from the old Siena Deli at Trop & Eastern from years ago - those were heaven.)  Perhaps the management might consider adding this as an option.  In the meantime, the Steak Pizzaola sandwich will be taking care of all your lunch needs!

The dining room is small and narrow, and decorated in vintage Italian Hole in the Wall style - nothing fancy here; all it's missing are the candles in net-wrapped Chianti bottles.  That doesn't sound promising, but it's actually very homey and cozy.  You feel like you're in a mom-and-pop Italian place in NYC or Chicago.  This is a place for darn good comfort food.

A small basket of garlic knots and bread was placed on our table and we looked over the extensive menu. Average entree price is about $14.  We settled on a 16"" cheese pizza( $12.99) for our sons, my wife had their board special of lobster ravioli with vodka sauce ($16.99) and I had the seafood combo with marinara sauce over linguine ($19.99).

I'm not sure about their lunch time pace, but be prepared to wait (it's worth it!) at dinner.  They do warn you on their menu that everything is made by scratch and soups are made as ordered.  We waited about 30 minutes after placing our orders.  

Good sized portions and the food was really tasty.  Their marinara sauce was very good, balanced and not acidic.

This time around, we tried the 4 cheese white pizza. It was fantabulous! I loved that one of the cheeses was gorgonzola. Such a great flavor combination.

We also decided to try their fries again - and this time around they were prefect. There was no way I could visit here again without ordering the amazing blue cheese dipping sauce - so we needed something to dip in it.

What continues to truly impress me about this establishment is the great service. The staff really care about the food quality. This place reminds of the random little Italian places I would stumble upon in NYC. It's homey, thoughtful, and caring.

Combine all of that with its close proximity to my house and we've got a home run. This is one of the best pizza places I've patronized and definitely one of the best places to dine in my neighborhood. Love it!",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,2,2,5,cpOKczdSomFWjfYBH8qFMw

The menu is full of Italian/NY style food. All of it sounded good. For dinner we ended up with the Montesano Special pizza. As good as everything else we had.

2074030,2014-11-24,0,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"Decided to go in for a quick dinner since it's conveniently located right around my neighborhood.  Not going to lie, I was actually quite surprised to walk in a rather packed restaurant because I've always driven by this establishment and it never seemed busy.  Something about the ambiance brings me right back to NYC eating at one of those old school mom-and-pop Italian joints with family keepsakes and memorabilia hanging on the walls.

Went for their white clam linguine which was really tasty.  I liked how they didn't skimp out on ingredients as the dish itself had plenty of meat mixed in it.  I did, however, bite into a shell which was unfortunate as I was hesitant to finish my meal after the incident.  The excessive use of oil also made the food unappetizing as it was very greasy.  Besides the linguine, we ordered their spaghetti with meatballs as well which wasn't too bad either.  The sauce was delicious but meatballs were soggier than what I would've liked.

Overall, Montesano's Eateria is definitely one of the better Italian restaurants along S Easter Avenue despite of the few shortcomings during our visit.  We'll give it another go next time and maybe even try one of their specialty pizzas.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,1,1,3,yUPtG3uAqgK5ovr8TO73gA

2103887,2013-11-06,0,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"Hungry and looking for somewhere to eat Monday night, my bf suggested Montesano's because he had heard really good things about it. It was 8pm when we arrived and we were seated immediately. There were a few other diners there but they left shortly after we got there. I later learned they close at 9pm. I would have been there earlier but didn't get off work until 7. Anyway the menu was extensive and everything sounded so good it was hard to decide what to get. We finally decided on the fried calzone, (you can choose baked or deep fried), garlic fries, and a chicken pasta dish with a garlic cream sauce which the waitress said was similar to Alfredo. While we were waiting, we got a basket of bread and garlic knots. The bread was just OK, nothing special, and the garlic knots were good but a little dry and were cold. I think since we were the last diners of the night we just got what was left from earlier. 

While we waited for our food, we checked out the baked goods on the display case in the front. Everything looked really good! I will have to go back to try some of those cannolis! Not too much later, we got our food. I have to say the deep fried calzone was AMAZING. I got it with meatballs and sweet sausage. (Originally asked for bacon but they said they no longer have bacon, yet it's still on the menu. Also who doesn't have bacon?) Either way it was fantastic. The crust was crispy and the inside was STUFFED with ricotta and mozzarella cheeses and the delicious meats it was just so good. It came with a piping hot side of their delicious marinara and it just completed the dish. I took half of it home because it was HUGE. The downfall was the pasta my bf got. It was just OK. The sauce was very bland and didn't have too much flavor. It didn't remind me of Alfredo as the waitress said. It was more of a watery sauce with garlic that's the best way to describe it. I was disappointed because it was $17 which is a bit steep for something I could have made better at home. The garlic fries were good and the ranch that accompanied it was also very good and garlicky. I am giving 4 stars for the calzone and leaving 1 star off because of the pasta and the service was a bit weak. Not once did anyone come to check on how our meal was or refill our drinks. I understand they were getting ready to close but we were the only ones there!

Walk in the front door: Visually, you are bombarded by amazing Italian sweets.  Cannolis (not filled yet so the shells don't get soggy, awesome), cheesecake AND cheesecake cookies, pound cake (with and without chocolate chips), tiramisu, and much more.  Then, take in a whiff.  I bet there is something savory right around the corner.  Oh yeah, this is what I envision Italian.

Service here is phenomenal as it is a family establishment (or at least feels that way), so EVERYONE takes an interest in you - checking on your table, beverages, etc.

I ordered the stuffed spinach pizza and as much as I was trying to avoid cheese this pizza was amazing.  Flipping amazing.

For dessert I ordered the homemade pound cake (rec: get it with chocolate chips!) and ice cream a la mode (spumoni!).  Was not disappointed.

ONLY downer is how long it can take the food to be served.  It IS homemade but if you are coming here for a quickie (i.e., work lunch)(, you should order pick-up.  At least if you dine-in they have free (!!!) garlic knots and bread 'n' butter.",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,1,2,4,GovJcAIiikXvdZRhVxQ5ww

2318859,2013-02-06,1,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I hate to disagree with so many of my fellow yelpers, but Montesano's does not live up to the internet hype. This pizza is NOT the best pizza in town. Actually,  it's closer to the top 10 WORST slices of pizza I have had in Vegas. 

I placed an order for pick-up: one large margherita pizza, one gluten free crust pizza with pineapple and peppers, one order of chicken fingers with fries and when we arrived, we added one of those stuffed garlic knots to our order because it was glaring at me through the glass deli case. 

The margherita pizza was bland, chewy and doughy in the worst possible way. The sauce was either not present or not flavorful enough to notice and there were slices of tomatoes layered on top of the pizza. These tomato slices made the pizza even worse because they created a soggy texture on the pizza that really threw me off. The cheese wasn't impressive and definitely didn't taste as fresh as some of the authentic Italian/east coast style pizza I have had around town. I was not impressed. I couldn't even finish one slice - that's how much I did not enjoy the pizza. Bland, flavorless, soggy and forgettable. 

The chicken fingers were standard. Nothing special. There was not enough hot sauce for my liking, but that is personal preference. 

The gluten free crust didn't impress my GF friend, who said it tasted like she was eating a brick. Bummer! 

I give this place two stars because the gentleman who answered the phone and took my order was extremely friendly and made me laugh a bunch while I was ordering. The other star is for the stuffed garlic knot that we added to our order. It was pretty good - really soft and chewy (in the right way) with great, flavorful, authentic marinara sauce (they should use THIS on the pizza) and lots of garlic flavor (I love garlic!). 

The man who took my order - wonderful. The girl working the front of the store and taking orders/payments for pick-up orders - NOT so wonderful. Is it really that difficult to put a smile on your face a greet a customer when they walk in the door rather than standing around and  allowing 5 minutes pass before you even say a word to the customer?

Do yourself a favor. If you're on this side of town and you are craving consistently good pizza - go to Grimaldi's. At least you know you're going to get something great and tasty for about the same price - probably even a little less.",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,7,4,2,n6QKdw8vHSfNuTtOXdfxTw

Breaded artichoke quarters (like the yummy kind that come in a can) with ranch and marinara. I want to make my own now, but with panko. I can't believe I ate a meal like this midweek.

From the instant view of homemade cakes and pastries, the deep rich smells, to the overly abundant decor on the wall, this place is it. Notice, there are not too many legit Italian restaurants here in Vegas. Buon Gusto is by far my favorite, but I am severely glad that I found another place that I can call home. 

We sat down and ordered the sauteed broccoli rabe with a mix of sweet and spicy sausage, chicken francese over linguini, and eggplant parm over rigatoni. We also received a complimentary basket of mini garlic knots and baked bread. All of this was pure deliciousness. It completely resembled my family's cooking, so I knew this was the place for me. The chicken francese was very buttery and you could taste the white wine and it wasn't overly lemony. The eggplant was sliced and breaded and cooked perfectly. 

We ordered a tiramisu, NY and Italian cheesecake, and a regular and chocolate cannoli to go. The NY cheesecake is by far the best I ever had. They homemake a lot of their cakes and pastries so you know it's good stuff. It's so dense and thick and it tastes just right. The Italian is made with ricotta but in my opinion, it's not as good as the NY style. The only thing I found disappointing was the Tiramisu. I find myself a tiramisu aficionado because it's my favorite due to the depth of simple flavors and i'm always on the hunt for the perfect one. Cugino's still makes the best. Montesano's was very light and had no in-depth flavor of espresso and liquor. The layers didn't merge well together and I felt like I was just eating lady fingers with a Kahlua whipped cream.

The crust on the stuffed pizza is nice and soft, just perfect really.  The cheese is good quality, along with the meat (ham, sausage, pepperoni).

Not sure what is a great garlic knot... everyone that I have had anywhere has been dry on the inside, oily on the outside and crunchy... 

For my entree I had the spinach & egg soup.... Incredible! Loaded with spinach and egg whites in a tasty chicken broth. Even though I was full... I wanted more.... 

My husband ordered a caesar salad to start (big enough for 2 people) and had a the Pasta soup (can't remember the name) He too enjoyed the chunks of vegetables and pasta in a tomato broth. 

The service is great. This is a family owned and operated restaurant (Yay) 
I have to laugh though, when they ask if everything is ok... even if it wasn't its very hard to give a negative answer to the question ""You love the soup, yes?""

2688272,2013-09-29,0,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"Welcome to a cozy spot selling American-Italian pizza, pasta and pastries.  The space is tiny, wrapping around a cookie counter, but it is kept warm with the buzz of people and music from the 50s.  The owners always made their rounds to check up on you.  We came an hour before closing on a Saturday and there were still tons of people picking up pizza to go.  I was told they were awesome, must try it another time. 

Lil man went crazy over the chocolate desserts on display, so we go for their chocolate dipped 7-layer cake.  It has layers of vanilla cake between chocolate ganache covered in melted chocolate.  The ganache was excellent, they should've stuck to this and chocolate cake and it would have been bomb.  Somehow the dipped chocolate gets cold and hard and the cake loses its lusciousness.  The house burgundy wine was pretty good (but somehow I longed for a wine glass) while the antipasto platter was very satisfying.  After nibbling on salami, prosciutto, cheese, you can pile the rest of the mixed greens, peppers and artichokes on your plate and drizzle with either chunky blue cheese or Italian dressing.  

This and the complimentary bread filled us up which was a good thing because our lasagna took 40mins to get ready.  Personally, I don't mind waiting for my food esp when enjoying drinks and starters. But hubby hates waiting so he asks for the lasagna to go.  The manager (owner's wife?) apologizes, give us fresh garlic knots to go and complimentary cookies.  The lasagna was good, their tomato sauce is tasty, and they are generous with ricotta and mozzarella... but it didn't have any ground meat.  I am still on a quest for great lasagna.  I have no idea why they are disappearing from most menus!  

Sorry back to Montesanos... Even with the wait, I enjoyed my meal and the warmth of the service.  It's a great joint for sharing pizza and pasta with kids.  For dates and desserts, probably not your best bet.",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,0,0,4,r0ufD7Swd-Q7YgWfgXsO0g

When we first sat down, they gave us complimentary garlic knots. Is it complimentary? Hmmm...not sure since one of the guys in my party comes here pretty often. Maybe we got hooked up? Well either way....this was delicious!!!!! It was small but flavorful. If I didn't control myself, I would have gotten full just off of garlic knots.

The menu was extensive!! For us indecisive folks, be prepared for the difficulty of selecting just ONE entree. Or if you got the appetite, go for two if you like!

Every person from my party of 3 enjoyed their entrees. Our waitress was the owner's sister and she was soooo friendly and welcoming. Felt like I was eating at an Italian family's own dining table.

Portions were big, prices were good. My Parmesan Chicken with pasta was $13.99 and my special someone's Veal with pasta was about $19.99. The other couple we were with both got pasta entrees and they were savoring their dishes like no tomorrow. 

If you're ever on this side of town, I definitely recommend this restaurant. This is probably, if not, THEE best family owned casual Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,1,0,5,yJSR1UDIVvbOt1DVp9HxYg
2703857,2010-05-23,4,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"Montesano's, mi amore. I pen this ode to share your wonderfulness with the world, happily giving away my secret knowledge to all, whether they be worthy or not.

Montesano's used to have two locations, at points vast distances away from their current address. This was quite a bummer, being that I, too, had an address far from the old space. Despite the casualness of the atmosphere, the lack of exotic recipes or high prices, Montesano's was always my favorite restaurant, and quite the treat on the rare occasions we would make the hike across town. But now! For the past few years Montesano's has been serving the food I've come to love over the past decade IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

I can wax poetic about the virtues of Montesano's for hous, so excuse me if I perhaps over-abbreviate my review. To sum things up: the food is awesome. They're mostly classic italian recipes, along with pizzeria type stuff - pizza, heros, etc. Nothing too fancy. but every plate is delicious. The veal parmigiana ousted veal I've happily paid twice for elsewhere. The garlic knots are amazingly simple but crack-like in their addictive properties. The stuffed pizza is good enough to satiate cravings for the ones we used to order in NY. And it's a family-owned and operated. They're no pretense. No pandering. No attempted hip'ness. Just good food at a fair price. Go, and try it. Or don't. I'm happy to give them business, but I'd be just as happy to not see them get too popular.

MY ONE REQUEST: Outdoor seating! Give me a place to sit outside and smoke a cigar with my meal, so that I can truly sit and enjoy the food the right way.

PRO-TIP: They catered my confirmation!",21KWy-JENq6xVEly5xki0A,6,5,5,vpvY1oR9BXCe52KjWn_rpA
2705143,2011-12-09,2,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"Come on Man!!!  

Are you kidding me 4 and 5 stars, this is at the very best 2-3 stars. I know I have a tough rating system, for me a 5 would be like a Nola's, or Brennans in New Orleans, Table 29 in Napa just too level set.

Now I understand a lot of people mistake a lot of food for good food, as Italian goes this was run of the mill.  I also now understand after local friends (maybe no longer my friends) suggested this place for dinner why some of the comments on yelp were made.  I do admit when it comes to Italian food I am a snob, that's why I avoid American Italian restaurants when possible, because I usually am disappointed, but because of the good ratings on Yelp I caved this time.

First the reason it takes a while for food, is that it is a small place, and they use boxed pasta which is 12 minutes cooking time.  You would assume home made Italian would include fresh pasta, and spices. 

I ordered the rice balls that according to the menu were one of their special dishes.  All I got was something mushy with gooey tasteless cheese, and tomato sauce?  The rice balls I have had are rice stuffed with cheese, deep fried, and some nice marinara sauce on top with some fresh basil. 

My friend suggested the meatballs, another mistake.  Yes there were 3 large mushy, tasteless balls of something with the same tasteless cheese, and unidentifiable sauce.

We also have the anti-pasta plate which was the highlight of the dinner, how can you mess up salad, cheese, veggies and meat.

For the main course they ordered for us the sausage and peppers, and I can't even remember the last dish for the same reasons as listed above, more boxed pasta with tasteless cheese, and uninspired tomato sauce (a little basil, and oregano would be nice).

Now if you are looking for off the strip Italian, lots of food for a reasonable price this is it.  

If you are looking for good Italian off the strip I would suggest Panvino, you will pay a little more, but not regret it the next day.

3077167,2010-12-09,2,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"Initially, Montesano's charms me from the principle of the business, local neighborhood Italian restaurant that is also a deli and family-run, but a closer look reveals a deeper attraction to delicious food, friendly service, and family-style portions.

When you first walk in, there is a glass display filled with all sorts of Italian sweets, from tiramisu to homemade cheesecake and Italian wedding cookies.  At this point, I no longer care that the rest of the interior design is not much more than a few booths and framed Italian advertisements.  It's a neighborhood deli anyways.

When you sit down at the table, they waste no time before bringing over the house garlic knots which are yummy.  There is a small quirk that they serve bread with butter instead of olive oil & balsamic vinegar.  But neighborhood delis, like your Italian cousin who won't hesitate to tell you ""that dress makes you look fat"", should all have lovable quirks.

I've never had Italian rice balls before and those two words don't particularly sound yummy.  But if you read the description (rice combined with ricotta, parmesan, breaded and deep-fried, served parmigiana-style), then you'll order it and get to enjoy a tasty discovery.

I love the crab meat fra diavolo over angel hair, fresh blue crab in a homemade spicy red sauce and al dente pasta, absolutely YUM!  The pork and eggplant pizza was a favorite as well, considering the superb crust and quality cheeses that it came with.

The only complaint I have is that everything is a little salty, but a little water retention is worth this dining experience.

Baked Meatloaf Ravioli - 5 stars - Unique filling, but could easily tell that everything was 100% handmade. Full of flavor and could easily feed a small army.

My mom and I decided to try their pasta dishes for dinner, and we were very impressed. But first, let me just say that the garlic knots are so addicting. It should be a crime to serve them before the main dishes because once you eat one, it's hard to stop. The fresh from the oven garlic knots are crispy and buttery on the outside and soft on this inside, with just the right amount of garlic, butter & parmesan cheese (I'm guessing) sprinkled on top. I couldn't get enough of them, but I knew that if I didn't stop, I wouldn't be able to enjoy what was to come. 

My mom ordered the Shrimp Diavolo over linguini pasta- Jumbo shrimp sauteed with garlic onions and hot chillies, and finished with Montesano's homemade marinara hot sauce.

I was eyeing the Broccoli & Sun Dried Tomato pasta dish- Broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, fresh garlic sautéed in olive oil and tossed with ziti & Romano cheese- but I was in the mood for marinara sauce too. I couldn't decide what to get until our friendly server came to the rescue and said that the chef would prepare a custom pasta dish for me combining the Broccoli & Sun Dried Tomato pasta dish w/ marinara sauce. I was happy. 

Prepare to wait a little for your food as Montesano's food is made-to-order. But I wouldn't have it any other way. The wait is worth it because the food is so tasty. The Shrimp Diavolo is a winner- a little bit spicy w/ a nice helping of shrimp and pasta. My custom creation was good, but not as good as the Shrimp Diavolo. The sauce was a little too salty for me and I wanted more broccoli & tomatoes, but I did appreciate how perfectly al dente the ziti was. I found myself going back to the Shrimp Diavolo, soaking up the amazing sauce with the garlic knots. My mom raved about her dish as well, saying it was much better than some of the other Italian restaurants in town. My mom and I were both stuffed even though we both only ate half of our food. No worries though because we took the leftovers to go.

As we were about to leave, the display of Italian cookies caught our eyes, so I had to buy a box for dessert. The cookies are so good, especially the wedding cookies and the florentines. Reasonably priced too; however, some words of advice, buy the cookies to go as they charge way more if you order cookies at the table.

3167868,2014-08-31,4,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"After quite a few mentions in a YT thread a while back, I bookmarked this spot and have been dying to try it. I really, really wanted to like it, but it just fell short...

When we first arrived, it wasn't all that busy. Maybe 4-5 other tables sat, and no one was waiting at the front to order from the display. We basically went ungreeted and were just met with blank stares. They did get us sat pretty quickly, but past that, I just wasn't a huge fan of the service. Our waiter had a very awkward way about him and made no attempts to greet us, or really talk to us at all. He just took our orders and brought the food. Maybe that's the way they want it? I don't know, but by the time we had gotten our food, the place was completely packed and the service from there on was virtually non-existent. Aside from having a very friendly and enthusiastic woman, I'm assuming the owner, visit us one time at the beginning of the meal, the service was lacking in a big way.

We started off our meal with their complimentary bread basket and an order of the Lasagna Explosion. Their take on the classic bread basket is pretty cool and those little garlic knots are quite addicting. The Lasagna Explosion wasn't quite as good as I expected though. I went to cut one in half to see the inside and it actually exploded out a ton of water. Yup, just clear water. Their sauce here is just way too watery, almost to the point where it has very little to no flavor. Apart from that, I liked that the Explosion is packed pretty good with cheese and it's a good size appetizer for $8, but it was just okay at best and I wouldn't recommend them.

On the menu itself, there's actually a ton of choices. If you're in the mood for pizza, they have that. If you're in the mood for a classic pasta dish, they have that. If you're in the mood for seafood, they have that. I could go on, but it's pointless. For as small as the place is, I was really surprised to see how many things they offer and there's bound to be something for everyone. I ended up ordering the Cavatelli with Broccoli Rabe and hot sausage. As I expected, the pasta was cooked perfectly. However, the amount of sausage in the plate was a bit disappointing and since the pieces were so tiny, it added very little to the overall taste. The broccoli rabe was decent though. It wasn't bitter and had great texture. All in all, just another okay dish.

As far as pricing goes, it's actually not too bad. We only ended up spending a little over $80 before tip, for 4 adults and 1 child. Since there's other things on their menu that I'd like to try, mainly dessert items like the chocolate canoli, I would possibly stop by again if I was in the area. But with mediocre service and okay food, I can't say I'd be coming back for the regular food anytime soon.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,5,3,3,mkiXI4rHpCflnp7khfjG7Q

The gluten free pasta and chicken was ok. The chicken was flavorful but the pasta portion was really big. Possibly too big! The gluten free pasta started sticking to itself in clumps and it just got to be too much of a chore to eat after having had 2 appetizers. So we took the leftovers home. The chicken was finished but the pasta was too clumpy to enjoy again.

We wanted so much to love the food and start being one of the regulars like in the other Yelp reviews. They Garlic knots were good to much on while waiting for our main course. We enjoyed their Fried Calamari the most, great flavor and really crunchy. I got the House Special pizza (their version of meats lovers) which was good and was very reasonably priced. My wife loves seafood and always gravitates towards clams if available. She got the Linguini with white clam sauce, unfortunately this is the main reason I'm giving 3 stars. The sauce was really off in flavor, just garlicky and didn't seem fresh. Tried several bites to see if it will grow on me but it didn't. 

We also like a good tiramisu to cap our Italian meal but we got served a plastic tub full of just mascarpone cream, not enough coffee flavor and no lady fingers.

I recently moved to this side of town and was soooo excited to see this place! I walked in with my mom on a Friday night at 5pm and we were ecstatic to see some of the same guys and it truly was the same Montesanos. The cookie counter in the front was so welcoming! We were seated within 10 minutes and the menu looked almost identical. The waitress was friendly and attentive, but very loud and nosey to where it was almost obnoxious. We got our order of garlic knots and this is where the true disappointment set in. They were tiny. We were used to the big fluffy, garlic, warm, messy bread knots from before. These tiny dried out little balls of bread were almost crispy and had little flavor. Mom ordered the veal marsala and I ordered the chicken marsala and were asked what kind of pasta we wanted. We used to get our meal and the pasta was covered in red sauce on the side. This wasn't the case anymore. The pasta is now under your meat with no red sauce. The marsala was tasty though on the really sweet side. I really wish Montesano's was the same food as before especially since it was a few of the same guys. I might go back and try their pizza since that used to be so awesome, but then again, I don't want to be sad when it isn't the same. Sighs.

Their portions are HUGE!

The only thing I don't recommend is their shrimp cocktail. The shrimp looked and tasted like they had just been thawed from the freezer.

We started out with garlic knots and riceballs. Buttery, saucy high cal goodness. Can't really go wrong with those two. 

The waiter seemed really excited about us trying riceballs for the first time - his excitement unfortunately did not translate to us loving them. They were tasty.. but dousing anything in melted cheese and pasta sauce is going to be a winning combination. 

For the entrees we went with Bolognese and Carbonara, both which were good but nothing particularly to write home about. The portions were generous and the prices were very reasonable, so I was not at all disappointed. 

As i mentioned at the beginning, what put Montesano's over the top was the service. The wait staff all seems like one big family (which they may actually be), and they treat you like you are part of the family too. The guy that waited on us was probably the friendliest waiter i've had in months at a restaurant. And I eat out way more than I should so that's saying a lot.

3519791,2016-02-24,51,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"My first taste of Montesano's was back when they had a location in the shopping center (the one where pizza hut and carl's jr is) off Craig and Decatur. I ate there from the time I was a teenager until about 10-ish years ago when the location closed. I was bummed when that location closed because finding a good pizza joint (this was pre-bambini's r.i.p.) in that area was not easy. Even though it wasn't as close by, I was glad that Montesano's still had other locations around town. The lone restaurant now being on the total opposite side of town from where I live on Eastern, caught my eye recently and I decided to stop by for lunch. Walking in I was greeted and offered a menu after saying that I'd be eating inside. My drink order was taken and brought right out and then the owner came out to say hello. I was so happy to see the same owner inside greeting customers and offering the exact welcoming I had remembered from all my countless visits to the other location. Change happens here in Vegas, we all know that, but it's nice to have a few faces and places feel and taste the same even if in a different location. 

Cheese Slices ($1.99 each) - Very good! The crust tastes good from one end to the other and it has just the right amount of crispness on the bottom. The amount of sauce and cheese is spot on. 

Sicilian Pizza ($3.00 each) - Because I love the pizza so much here, I wish I liked the Sicilian more because it's a type of pizza I really like, but few do right or consistently right around town. The outer crust was nice and crunchy, but the rest of it was just soft bread. The base of the pizza was not crunchy nor was the top soft and pillow-like, which is what I look for in this type of pizza. The sauce they smothered on top tasted so good, but after the 2nd bite, I had a soggy crust on both of my pieces because the sauce soaked through to the bottom. I'll stick with the regular slices.

Sodas are $2.50 and they give you free refills. It takes some time for your food to come out however they make it fresh. You can always order ahead to reduce wait time. The only lunch specials they had when I last visited was either 2 slices and a drink or 1 slice, side salad and drink. Try the homemade soup it's delicious and if you want a cannoli they fill them fresh to order.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,64,64,4,beLQtTFyBqq420ZZnSslGQ

First off, they start you with some complimentary garlic knots and sesame bread. It wasn't bad. But the garlic knots were hard, and tasted more like they used garlic powder and not fresh garlic. 

Then, our orders arrived. I ordered the Chicken in Garlic Cream Sauce on Pasta. First of all, that name is way too long to tell the waiter what i want. Second, there was no garlic taste at all in the cream sauce. The cream wasn't even a sauce. It tasted like they used Campbell's cream sauce. It was thick (like a chowder) and over-salted. My chicken was waayy over-salted and did not even taste fresh. So overall, my pasta was a no.

My brother ordered the Chicken Parmigiana. My friend ordered the Spaghetti with Meatballs. Both had the same sauce that was sour to the point where it became bitter. My friend's meatballs had huge chunks of breading in it that ended up making her lose her appetite. 

On top of everything, the prices were relatively high. I'm not exactly sure the prices of my brother and friend's plates, but mine was $15.99. Overall, we paid $48 and some change.

What we have noticed is that they like using A LOT of garlic and that's pretty much on everything they offer. It's too much for our taste. I also agree with another Yelper about the grease.

If I ate here every day I'd either weigh 400 pounds or be dead from cardiac arrest.  The food is fantastic and they serve ridiculously sized portions.  An appetizer is well sized and would be considered a meal at the average joint.

Keep in mind that things do take a while to come out of the kitchen because everything is made fresh.  If you want it fast, go to Fazzolis.  If you want GOOD food, Montesano's is worth the wait.

I usually eat lasagna when I'm in having Italian and this place serves up arguably the best stack of cheese, pasta and meat I've had.  To top it off, the amount of lasagna Montesano's serves up probably weighs about a pound or more.  One of the owners actually said the lasagna used to be 8 layers instead of the current 6.  If I don't eat apps or bread, I can maybe eat 2/3 of it.  Maybe.

My other dish of choice here is the calzone.  Pizza dough, stuffed with meat and 2 pounds of cheese, then deep fried.  What's not to die for?  Or from.  Ooey, gooey and yummy.  For $7 bucks, this will keep you full for days...mostly because you'll likely have enough leftovers to last you that long.

If (thats a BIG if) you either saved space or you actually have room in your tummy for desert, they have something for every sweet tooth.  If you can't stomach any more food, make sure you take something to go.  From wonderful wedding cookies to cannolis to crazy good florentines, the options and combos are endless.

Not matter what you choose, you will not leave here hungry.",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,2,3,4,qNTPONXJgUKmUymUuZ-Dqw

The front entrance has a glass case full of tempting breads and baked sweets. Behind that is the seating area and I was directed to a booth. The restaurant was noticeably clean, which is always a plus. The servers were very pleasant and my drink was brought promptly.
An older woman was loudly demanding her money back near the front claiming to have waited forever for her order. That concerned me since I was on my lunch break and had to get back to work. But I took a chance and ordered a dinner salad with hot peppers and a slice of Sicilian with added basil. My salad came right away and was delicious. Crusty croutons, halved grape tomatoes, and a great zing from the peppers. Within 10 minutes or so, my pizza came. Perfectly baked crust. The sauce is ON POINT. I want to cover everything in that sauce because it will be amazing. The basil was present, but subtle and cheese was tasty. That sauce tho... I will definitely return. I'm excited to have found this gem of a place and will update when I try out the bakery.",3uPFvvFK9KNexbrArw2W6Q,1,1,4,0rwPXmsl4OS8S74gVMq2NQ
3972855,2014-02-03,4,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I met several friends for a casual lunch.  Feast would be more like it.  The Yelp friend who organized the lunch had pre-ordered what we were getting.  We had a table reserved in the back of this somewhat small mom and pop Italian restaurant.

First, drinks were brought quickly when we ordered and refills were constant throughout our two hour lunch.  And then the food started coming.  First up was some bread--classic Italian bread and mini garlic knots.  Very tasty.  Maybe a little more garlic is needed for my taste but good nonetheless.

Next up were some starter dishes.  We got two orders of what they call Lasagna Explosions and 2 orders of Rice Balls Montesano.  There were eight of us and the plates were such that there were 8 rice balls so everyone could have a try and 12 lasagna explosions.  The rice balls were breaded and deep fried with sauce and cheese.  The lasagna explosions consisted of rolled lasagna, breaded and deep fried and served with sauce.  The sauce was very good and it wasn't sweet.  They had the good sense to hold back on the sugar.

Then came the second stage, the pizzas.  We were brought three different pizzas, a white pizza, a Sicilian fresca (Margarita), and a regular cheese pizza.  I had a piece of the white pizza and one piece of the Sicilian fresca.  My favorite was the Sicilian fresca.  Very tasty and thick crust the way I like pizza.  And you could have guessed it by now, each pizza was cut into eight slices so we all could have a slice of each.

The next course was for the serious eating.  We got two orders of sausage and meatballs, two orders of seafood in garlic cream over linguini, two orders of eggplant Parmigiano with ziti, and an order of tripe.  The first two dishes had their meat sauce and were quite good.  The seafood consisted of shrimp, mussels, calamari, and conch over fettuccine in the garlic cream sauce.  I could have had a bit more garlic in the cream sauce.  

Then came dessert.  We got an order of Zeppole and we were each brought a small plate with a cookie, a cannoli, and their three color cookie.  Desserts were very good.  By now, no one wanted to move we had eaten so much.

Service throughout the meal was excellent.  As I said before, drinks were refilled quickly, plates were cleared, dishes being brought to the table were explained, and the two members of the staff that kept us happy were excellent.  One was Toniann, and I apologize I don't know the name of the other.  The were plenty of smiles and good humor from the ladies and at the end of the meal, they boxed leftovers in separate boxes, marking each so we could bring something home.  My wife had leftover ziti and eggplant and she was quite happy.  I didn't have to cook except to press a few buttons on the microwave.  

Really nice lunch with some great company and very good food!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,8,5,_sqnPSw4Np8nuRlc2kRpDg

The wait staff is very friendly.  I'm about 100% positive our waitress was from the East Coast and gave the restaurant more of a neighborhood feeling.   When you're here you know your food is going to be really tasty, homemade Italian food.   

We started off with the stuffed knots.  The knots come with meat or marina sauce.  We tried the meat sauce and really liked it.  The knots come stuffed with cheese, ham and pepperoni.  Pretty tasty!  My favorite part of the meal was when she brought out fresh mini garlic knots and bread.  Their mini garlic knots are addicting!  They are the perfect size to just pop them right in your mouth!  I'm sure I ate 4 before I realized how many I ate...but then I couldn't stop so I stopped counting!  LOL!  My husband and I split the Pesto Cream Sauce over cheese raviolis and added chicken.  They were very nice and split the dish on 2 separate plates for us.  Neither of us could finish our half of the half!  It was so good and we took it for leftovers.  

I'm definitely going back...and when I do I have to try some of the deserts in their display counter.  When you walk in the door, you see all of these wonderful pastries and deserts.

I was sat by a fairly friendly lady. She immediately took my drink order. I had asked her about lunch specials and she sounded those off. I decided on the simplest and quickest lunch possible. An order of garlic 
bread and 2 slices of pizza. 

After about 5 minutes, they brought me out some fried garlic knot creation that I knew wasnt mine, but tried it anyways. IT WAS HORRIFIC. All you can taste was fried dough, and not all that tasty fried dough like you would have for dessert. The server noticed I didnt get the right order and brought my correct order of garlic bread, after about another 7 minutes. I told her that she could bring the pizza out as well as I wasnt trying to ""course"" it out. She said she would bring it as soon as its ""ready""?!?!?! How does it take more than 12 minutes to heat up two slices of pizza???

Finally got the pizza about 5 minutes later and it was seriously burnt and sitting in a bed of grease. I talked myself into at least trying it and giving it the benefit of the doubt. Bad choice again. It was god awful tasting and so greasy I knew it was going to give me troubles if I ate any more.

I asked for a cookie to go and the bill. She didnt even notice I ate ONE bite of the pizza and mentioned I saved $1.25 by ordering the special. I just laughed as she walked away.

I went here a few weeks back and haven't had a chance to Yelp it, but better late than never. ToniAnne was an amazing sweetheart of a server who hooked us up from the start.

Too much wine probably explains why I originally and erroneously posted/""shared"" on Facebook the first sentence, only saying that the beef broccoli is a must. No, Montesano's is not a Chinese restaurant. It is, however, about the best Italian place I've eaten in awhile. These little places are like hidden treasures for me and my mom whenever we venture out together.

That's when the garlic knots and a side of bread came.  It was decent.  A bit on the salty side, but not too bad. The bread was good, though. Our entrees then came and I have to say that I enjoyed the entrees of my companions more than I did my own.  My mom ordered a Calamari with Creamy Garlic Sauce.  It was ok, but I'm also not a big fan of creamy sauces. I think a spritz of lemon would've livened the dish up a bit.

Had we found the Holy Grail of Pizza in Las Vegas?  Hubby and I had to try it again to be sure, and I promised myself I would Yelp it after our second go'round... so here goes.

Hallelujah!!!! Montesano's is officially our FAVORITE pizza joint in all of the Las Vegas valley.  Their simple traditional Italian menu, paired with outstanding quality of ingredients, makes the yummiest pizza you can possibly imagine!  They bake their bread fresh EVERYDAY! (and you can smell it when you open the door), they make their own sausage, they don't skimp on toppings - but they don't overload them either, and the pizza sauce is so basic it's hard to believe it can be that good... but it is, oh it so is!!!

We ordered the House Special Pizza, and the Garlic Knots.  The overall harmony of the fabulous sauce, sweet sausage, meatballs, pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions and the perfectly cooked soft and chewy, yet crisp crust on this pie was unparalleled.  The Garlic Knots were absolutely 100% like a previous Yelper said ""crack-like in their addictive properties.""  We could not stop eating them, and both made a note to self to double order them next time!

We have yet to try the pasta dishes, but from the looks of things, I doubt they will disappoint.  This place is surprisingly under-reviewed for how delicious it is, and if we could, we would have given it a 7 out of 5.  Montesano's for liFE!!!",hZR7YvZK5KiJnF2b2YsrHQ,1,1,5,lbt-JS8X1dNzuM_K7xkXmQ

Montesano's is true New York style pizza and Italian food that would have the Statue of Liberty giving the owners a high-five with her torch. The torch of first-rate New York pizza and Italian food has been passed to Montesano's. 

  Montesano's is a bargain when it comes to New York pizza and Italian food in Las Vegas. Below is a cost comparison between flying from Las Vegas and New York for a slice of New York pizza and dining in Montesano's. 

Exhibit 1: Flying between LV and NY for NY pizza:
Average round trip flight in January, 2015: $460
Parking at Economy parking: $10 per day
Taxi from JFK to Manhattan : $52 plus tolls&taxes
Average hotel nightly rate in Manhattan: $225
Average price of a slice of NYC pizza: $2.75

Exhibit 2: Dining in Montesano's:
lunch special with 2 slices, toppings, and bottomless Coke: $6.75

Results: Montesano's is a steel for the individual thriving for a slice of New York pizza and Italian food. Dining at Montesano's saves that individual over $600. That a savings that equals eighty-eight Montesano's lunch specials. 

  When it comes to saving this much money on New York pizza and Italian food it was guaranteed that I was going to try Montesano's. The question I am asking myself is, ""what took me so long?"" 

  A few weeks ago, I tried their two slices with toppings and a Coke $6.75 lunch special. I felt the spirit of the Statue of Liberty when I held a slice of the Big Apple in my hands. It was a thin crust overflowing with the ingredients of mouth watering cheese, delicious sauces, and mushrooms that elevated my taste buds to a place higher than the Empire State Building. 

  No matter how much I cherish New York pizza, an eggplant parmesan hero elevates my taste buds higher than the Empire State Building up to the Stratosphere. After my initial visit, I was looking forward to trying their eggplant parmesan hero. What a culinary way to kick in 2015. Between the crunchy bread; eggplant parmesan, mouth watering cheese, sauce, and 4.5 star ingredients filled the space. 

  I place Montesano's up in the tier of the best pizza places and Italian restaurants in the Metropolitan Las Vegas area. I am a believer that there is no best restaurant. This would stop me from discovering new places. With a savings that are worth 88 lunch specials, if I had my way I this would be my first of 87 more to go. Montesano's is delicious New York pizza and Italian food that will have the Statue of Liberty holding her torch in agreement.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,8,4,6ZGjYuSr9OPjUAW5TRCeuQ

You walk in and there's a cookies/dessert section next to the counter. I always like the cannoli's. They hand-fill it for you when you order and the filling isn't too sweet and has a great texture to it. Ends are dipped in semisweet chocolate. 

You can also order mini cookies and whatnot by the pound. They hand make their desserts in the kitchen everyday.

Start off with the garlic knots!! They're lightly fried and served with a marinara sauce and a ranch sauce. 

I always order the house special pizza and the meat lovers pizza. 
The house special has pepperoni, sausage, peppers, mushrooms.

Meat lovers: like a pizza pie...sausage, pepperoni, a bunch of other meats.


The guys working behind the counter are super nice and helpful with suggestions. Shoutout to Frank! He was our server and was so awesome. Make sure to request him if you're here.

4843852,2010-12-17,1,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I have a friend who is very particular about her Italian food, because she comes from a good Italian family.  So when we went to Montesano's, it wasn't enough to taste the food.  She had to meet the family running the restaurant and quiz them about their background.

Steve Montesano came out and told us they come from Naples, by way of New York.  He says his family is still very much involved in the day-to-day running of the business.  So you'll likely find a Montesano in the kitchen or in the dining room.  And if not, you can catch up on their family tree by checking out the old family photos on the back wall of the restaurant.   

Although the service was quite friendly, it was also very slow.  I was with friends so I didn't mind having a lunch stretch over two hours.  But if I had been really hungry, I probably would have been irritated.  So I do want to warn people about that.

I thought the food was delicious, and the portions good for the price.  I had the homemade ravioli, and tried the baked pasta with sausage.  We also had some of the garlic knots and for dessert, a plate of the zeppole.

5145013,2012-04-04,1,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I am not sure how to rate this place. The first time we went we loved it, the second time it was nasty.
 How do you go from awesome to nasty?
 The first time we had a nice chatty waitress and I ordered eggplant and my party the chicken. No problems, well cokked pasta and out this world well preparted eggplant. There aren't many places out here who don't mess up eggplant. We took home a pizza for hubby, he got sick for two days. I think it was possibly msg as he is allergic, no one said they used it. It  wasn't food poisoning. 
 A few weeks later we were in the area and went back. He ordered a meatball sub which was simply older bread with breadballs. Not meatballs, but breadballs, there was so little meat and so much breading they were actually a funny color. And they made this huge deal out of him saving 1.25... give me a break! The first time the eggplant was homemade and stacked a certain way, this time it was little fired up medallions ( probably from Trader Joes frozen food section) that stunk and was a huge rip off for the meal price. For some reason we did not complain, we just secretly whispered "" We are never coming back"".
  The different waitress we had the second time around was ok. Kind of cold and I don't know.. that day we just got the  ""Lets see what we can get away with"" vibe. As in money was all not the customers. If they ran out of eggplant they should have said so and recommended another dish. How simple is that?! Substitution without explanation is a major no no... 
 So for all the people who had bad experiences with the service I believe them 100%. There did not seem to be much consideration for the customer, if they didn't try pulling anything they would have had some new loyal customers. This place seems to lack common sense when it comes to service. I know a chef from a local place who will just be honest and tell people "" We are too busy to fill that order now"". And you know I go there all the time and still do I have never been disappointed. This Montesanos placce will apparently leave people hanging for 30 minutes trying to call in an order.. Unreal.
 So I doubt I'll go here again unless I am in the area with someone who really wants to go.. But I'll offer to pay if they'll just go across the parking lot to Panera instead....",1jIlvLV10nOhwqcvWNQnQw,1,1,2,q7NlijzyoN4s4PR6iJVDWg

Normally, we cook for game nights, but when we arrived on Friday, our friends said that they thought maybe we would just order a pizza this time, which sounded great to us.

They gave us two options, and made the comment that of the two, they always had better service and food from Montesano's.   That made the decision easy.

We called and ordered for pickup, and after about a half hour, we drove over.  We were a little early (they had told us about an hour), but we sat and chatted while they finished our order.

I was very impressed with the service.  The young man who helped us out at the register was polite, and double checked everything with us before we left, even checking to make sure that we had the right toppings on our pizza.  

We ordered: 
A large pepperoni, onion and mushroom pizza.
A calzone with spinach and spicy italian sausage.
Meat ravioli.
Garlic Knots. 
A chocolate cannoli
Some other assorted cookies.

I really liked the food!
The calzone was my favorite, fried perfection with tons of ricotta, spinach, and flavorful sausage.
The pizza was really good.  Thinner crust (kind of a New York style), plentiful toppings...I really enjoyed it a lot.
The ravioli was a revelation.  Some raviolis are not filled well, but these were stuffed with delicious meat, and covered in sauce and cheese...we were fighting over who got to finish these off.  
The garlic knots were only ok for me...very small, but plentiful.  I would have liked them to be a little softer, and to have had a bit more garlic, but they were ok.  

As the desserts go, I only had the chocolate cannoli, which was delightful.  I haven't had cannoli in years, and this was really good.

All in all, I really enjoyed my first experience here.  The food was good, reasonably priced, and service was extremely pleasant. I would absolutely come back again.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,4,6,4,gnPUiyR9zvpyAmXkFZbUeQ

Family owned and operated since the 90's and a purveyor of traditional Italian cuisine for much longer than that Montesano's Eateria had been on my must-visit list even before moving to Las Vegas, but with an extensive menu of classic antipasti, pizzas, pastas, soups, secondi, and sweets the timing never seemed right to sample as much as I'd like - the solution found in the Italian tradition of a family style tasting with seven friends coordinated through the lovely Toniann Montesano herself.  Truly a 'mom n' pop' red sauce sort of place, said in the most complimentary of ways, with a full service bakery up front and walls strewn with signed celebrity photos, maps of Italian neighborhoods in various locales, and kitschy décor it was at a long table in the rear of the restaurant that we were seated and with superlative service, ample beverage refills, and enough food for a party twice our size the nearly two-and-a-half hour meal  could not have better met expectations - each plate perfectly prepared, well presented, and unquestionably delicious.  Beginning first with an opening volley of house-baked bread and supple garlic knots before progressing to fried options including creamy lasagna explosions and toothsome rice balls in bright, aromatic sauce it was at the second 'proper' course that the meal truly took flight, a trio of pizzas ranging from simple cheese and garlicky white on lightly  charred crusts alongside a pillowy 'Margherita' on buttery, thick focaccia-style crust that easily ranked amongst the best 'grandma slices' I've had to date.  At this point sated but certainly not stuffed it was with great spectacle that our final savory course arrived and featuring two platters each of Eggplant Parmigiano,  Housemade sausage and meatballs smothered in marinara, and a bounty of fresh squid/shrimp/sea snails/mussels smothered in creamy white sauce plus a bowl of supple braised tripe the table was literally covered as eyes stared wide - leftovers a guarantee, though all ate heartily with favorites varying from person to person and the tripe a personal favorite, especially atop slices of warm bread from the refreshed basket.  Taking to heart the gluttonous portions provided thus far dessert was ever so slightly scaled back as hot, spongy Zeppole dowsed in powdered sugar and filled-to-order cannoli both shined brightly while Rainbow cake, Butter, and Almond cookies were spot-on authentic  - a characteristic shared by a hot sfogadella that I requested as I paid the bill, ostensibly for 'later' had it not been so perfect...the creamy citrus filling beneath shattering layers not even making it to the car, no matter how full I was.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,5,Djv27wHiW-q7QFFnYbINxA

I could barely chew mine.  our entrees were oversized and completely shattered in sauce.  it was very sloppy.  we were not happy with our food and the chef came out and apologized but instead of offering another dish he said we would just have to pay for it bc he already made it.  we literally had 2 full plates of food untouched. but he did offer us a free dessert lol.  I rather have had a different meal served to us instead of leavin hungry and paying for a meal we DIdnt like.,zsJLk34mTDMyuVS_EaBLxw,1,1,2,Jzrb9KUl6dWub1uhYQX4FA

Since this particular friend hails from New Jersey, I assumed he would know what he talked about. It was a little bit of a thicker crust and sweeter sauce than what I consider to be ... let's call it canonical. A good pizza, maybe even a great pizza, but just a little off from my stylistic presence.

But where Montesano's really shines is with sandwiches. Like all great ones, theirs starts with a foundation of quality bread - a crusty Italian roll inside which fresh and flavorful meats and cheeses are piled.

First positive indication: It's Friday night and the place is PACKED... Go up to the guy at the register and put your name on the waiting list if there's people standing around that area... We made the mistake of standing around and a party of 4 cut us (RUDE JERKS) and we had to wait an additional 10 minutes [in addition to the 20 we had already waited] to be seated.

While we were waiting we saw a sign that said something about being patient while waiting for your food because everything is made fresh to order.  Another positive indication!!!  ..excitement builds!!

So my BF was salty balls that we had waited so long, I didn't care I was EXCITED for the food!!  Another positive indication: the employees [to me] seemed like they were all family?  Might have been my blurred vision because I was SO hungry?  Very friendly, nice, patient with my questions and had great recommendations.

We had to wait a while for the house garlic bread knots- because they were baking them!! YUMmMMmM piping hot, fresh out of the oven!!!  

We started off with the Rice Balls that Yelpers have RAVED about...  One word describes it all: PHENOMENAL!!  It's a little weird to feel rice in your mouth mixed with cheese, but who wouldda thought??  The Marinara sauce tasted so FRESH!  Can't wait to go back and try the pasta!

I got the Margarita Pizza (personal pan size) and the BF got the 14' pepperoni- deeeeeLISH!!  

We mentioned Yelp at the beginning of our meal and our server told us we'd get a discount, but it never appeared on the bill.  We payed regular price- we'd come back with or without the discount anyway!  We'd rather support local restaurants than the Corporate big boxes!",Tq61AHCncEpvRGnUvgnmzA,5,3,5,soxR6C4Iu2cvEE-NmUu_WA

I did a take out order and the person who answered the phone was very friendly. When I got there, the staff behind the counter greeted me. I already knew I was gonna like this place!

At the counter there where all the dessert goodies... My eyes got so big that I felt like I wanted to get everything thing in there...

The food! Omg I really lurved my order of tripe! It was soft and really melts in your mouth with a wonderful sauce... I enjoyed every bit of it dipping the garlic knots in the sauce...

5586813,2011-08-18,2,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I walked into Mom's house and the smell of homemade tomato sauce made me salivate. The problem was, it wasn't ready yet. Ugh, now what do I do? I wanted Italian food and I wanted it at that precise moment.

The solution? Montesano's! Never having been here but always saying ""I need to run in there sometime,"" it was time to do just that.

The wait was long. The staff was warm and friendly to everyone, young and old, with a kind word, a cookie, and a laugh, if needed. The place smelled amazing and staring at the pastry case just made us more ravenous.

Did I mention the wait was long? 

..... Did I mention yet that it was worth it?

Caesar salad, add anchovies, no croutons - It was good. Not great, but good. The dressing was a bit on the thin side, but the greens were fresh, crisp. I would order it again, absolutely, but I wouldn't come here just for the Caesar. One salad was big enough for us to share.

Sweet Italian sausage appetizer - 3 huge homemade links and a generous portion of fresh, flavorful, fragrant marinara. The meat was done very well; great texture, loved the fennel seed, with a perfect balance of herbs and spices. I would like the casing to be a tad thinner, but maybe that's just me. This ""appetizer"" was my entree and I took most of it home. 

Chicken Marsala - really, really tasty! Earthy and deep and warming, with just the right bite of the marsala wine. The chicken was tender and juicy. Very well done. 

The NY cheesecake was fabulous. Thick and dense and perfectly balanced. Not too sweet, a little bit of that cheese bite, and melt-on-your-tongue-but-stick-to-your-ribs kind of texture.

The cannoli. Holy... Montesano's is the reason Rocco was told to ""leave the gun, take the cannoli."" Seriously, folks, seriously delicious. Not a whipped cream, or a custard, or other variation of wannabe pastry filling... Montesano's does it true with a real cannoli cream like no one else I have patronized (save for Nana, and that's saying a lot).

Service was fantastic. Toni Ann and Angelina took great care of us and we wanted for nothing. Smiles abound, chats, refills, recommendations (""you gotta try this!""). It was like being a part of the family.

FYI: The wine list is half decent, but stay away from the house red. It was really just sweet grape juice. Not their fault, I know what I am getting into with most house wines in a carafe. Just wouldn't want anyone else to get into it. Order off the list and enjoy something more notable.

Also notable: Apparently their tripe is something of importance. No less than 3 phone calls asking if it was in the kitchen that night. A sign on the white board declaring that yes, in fact, they had tripe that night. And, I noticed, it's not on the menu. Yet, people are seeking it out.

I've searched high and low for all around good, authentic Italian dishes and desserts and this is it! On Friday and Saturday nights this place is jammin', don't get offended if you have to wait a bit, I promise you it's worth the wait. They don't have a lot of tables and people know this is the real deal so they come a flockin'. If it's your first time dining at this little Italian joint you may want to try to come during the week or for lunch. P.S. they are closed on Sundays.

When you first walk in your mind is instantly filled with naughty thoughts as your eyes scan over the case filled with homemade desserts and treats. Should you indulge and eat dessert before dinner? I'll leave that up to you. 

My personal favorite item on the menu is their chicken parmesan. The chicken is always moist, the noodles al dente and I could go on for days about their scratch-made tomato sauce. Speaking of scratch-made....everything on the menu is homemade except the noodles. The pizza crust, the pasta sauce, down to every single cannoli. Even though there are signs posted reminding you of this, please remember that the food may take a little longer to come out because of all the love they put into each and every dish. It's nbd anyways because they provide you with complementary garlic knots that will make you swoon and will hold you over. Oh and you have to try their pizza. It's made with whole milk mozzarella not some crappy, cheap part-skim mozzarella. The cheese is so smooth, buttery and creamy it's amazing. You'll instantly fall in love (your thighs will get over this love connection later).

5838009,2012-07-18,1,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"Montesano's is a friendly, authentic trattoria and more.  It is also a deli, pasta shop, and first-rate emporium of memorable baked dessert treats.  A server was slow to take our order, based on some initial confusion over who was assigned our booth.  But, once that hiccup was alleviated, all was well.  She was a fine server, but I would have liked to have been informed of the dinner specials like Lobster Parm I later saw on a board.  A sign inside the restaurant reads ""Where love has a taste!"" and diners are reminded by another placard to be patient because all food here is cooked to order.  I found great taste in these environs, and the freshly prepared food well worth the wait. 

I was initially surprised to see that dinners are served here with complimentary freshly baked garlic knots and bread.  Then the surprise turned to shock when the bread and basted knots were placed on the table.  There were 24 Garlic Knots--for only 2 diners!  They were small, but so what?  The doughy knots were warm and quite tasty, and the huge number made up for their diminutive size.  A dozen accompanied us home.

I was less impressed by the fresh but earthy Italian bread.  It was sort of dry, and not that tasty.  But this was a minor setback.  For the Stracciatella (Italian Egg Drop) Soup was the best I have ever had: really hot and tasty broth, and chockfull of spinach and egg whites.  An immense ""Caesars Salad"" with one anchovy as requested, chopped Romaine, Romano Cheese, and fresh croutons was very good but almost overdressed with too much Creamy Caesar Dressing.  

A Shrimp Cocktail featured 8 large shrimp that were good but tasted like they had recently been defrosted.  But I harbored no reservations at all concerning my entree of delectable Veal Montesano over Fettuccine, which was simply superb.  This very creative dish featured nicely pounded and tender, hand sliced, and lightly floured milk-fed veal medallions, artichoke hearts, fresh garlic, roasted potatoes, and roasted red peppers, and was finished in a delicate white wine and butter sauce in a brick oven.  The fragile artichoke petals gave the sauce a welcome hint of lemony flavoring.  And the fresh pasta undergirding the veal was cooked perfectly!  The whole edible conglomeration represented a delicious and very nice blend of harmonizing flavors.

But I was by no means done, because a lovely, large ""Black & White Cookie"" in the display case had caught my eye when I entered the restaurant.  I went back to get a good second look, and then ordered it for dessert.  The unusual cookie, freshly baked on premises, was composed of pound cake topped by vanilla icing on one half, and chocolate icing on the other, and was moist and delectable.  The pure vanilla and chocolate flavors startled my taste buds.  Diane's novel idea of biting down on the black and white border to take in both flavors at once was a definite winner.  And, that lovely cookie was so rich that half of it accompanied me home, and even that amount lasted two more lunches!  

Affable owner/chef Steven Montesano, attired mostly in red, flitted in and out of the kitchen, watched the front of the house, and came over to our booth to check on us a few times during the course of our meal.  He was a very cordial and accommodating host, and it is obvious that he takes great pride in his fine cooking and baking.  Deservedly so!

The service is great. They are down to earth and friendly. The food is definitely the best Italian I have had in Vegas.

They did and saw the plethora of little cookies, pastries and desserts... And love all that. They were quick, genuine, professional. Just came in here for a cup of coffee and now I have to come back. Thanks guys",wNV16_TMvUAEHhEXQxeyuA,0,0,5,kk-eHA_yLioQsj0SpLKkVQ

The pizza is amazing and the garlic knots are delicious. I only gave 4 stars because of the wait time. The food takes longer because its all fresh and its worth the wait. But I wish the staff updated and checked on us a little more during the wait. But once you get your food, you'll be happy you waited.",HVOA8lVvoZBUibJe743uQQ,0,0,4,2btR1J266Kgi2W-NP9jpfg
5913727,2014-06-22,1,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"On my continuing quest for great Italian food we tried Montesano's for dinner.  We were quickly seated and had our drink order taken right away.  The ""famous"" garlic knots and bread also arrived. I'm not sure why everyone likes these. They are very small and quite salty. Order them from Bistro pizza and you'll see what garlic knots really should be.

We ordered a Cesar salad, the baked ziti and baked cannelloni. The Cesar was big, plenty for two to share. I thought it was quite good will lots of Parmesan cheese. The baked pastas were also a pretty good size, but I thought they were just ok, nothing special. 

I saw a couple reviews mentioning the NY cheesecake so ordered a slice. It was terrible. It must have been a day or two old as it completely crumbled when you put a fork through it. Not creamy at all. 

The service was pretty good and I did the enjoy the atmosphere. The one issue we had was the petite blond with an accent. I asked her a question about the menu and she said ""I have no idea"" and walked away. Quite rude and obviously no idea how to provide good service. 

I will continue my mission to find great Italian food in Henderson but probably won't be returning here.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,1,1,2,-Fx8xaqAy3tRiZINxsetRQ

Tonight on a Friday night it was about a 20 min wait; very busy. The service was very slow no refills on drinks until after an hour of sitting. Our appetizer took about 45 mins to an hour and was burnt and flat bc it sat under the heat lamps. Then an hour and a half into sitting we got our pizza and it was burnt, bottom and top crust. So we got the check and left.",gdDTmvbfKLDYLUnjRrCcaA,2,0,2,6R6lb1WdZIOXMSHigaj1Ag

Wow, I spend too much every time I see all the goodies in the display case.  The cannollis are devine, their crumb cakes are perfect with changing fruit flavors.  The brasciole, meat balls are great.

5960159,2014-02-06,8,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"I have had this place bookmarked for some time, so when given the opportunity to dine here with some fellow Yelpers, I was excited by the prospect. We arrived around noon and the place wasn't too busy. We shared a large number of items from the menu.

Here's a list of all everything we tried:

GARLC KNOTS: Really good. Really small, but warm, flavorful and soft. 
RICE BALLS: These were just ok. I enjoyed them, but they weren't notable. 
LASAGNA EXPLOSIONS - I don't usually like lasagna, but this was a nice change of pace from typical lasagna. Moist and very cheesy.
TRIPE - My favorite part of the meal. I don't typically enjoy tripe, but this preparation was very enjoyable. Not chewy at all and didn't have that tripe-y smell that usually turns me off.
MEATBALLS & ITALIAN SAUSAGE - This dish was ok. The meatballs are huge, however, and I enjoyed the tomato sauce.  
SEAFOOD PASTA IN GARLIC CREAM SAUCE - This dish was just ok. the sauce didn't have enough depth of flavor for me and I don't see myself ordering this dish again if I returned.
SICILIAN PIZZA - I'm not usually a fan of deep dish. This had nice flavor, but it was a little doughy for my taste. Everyone else seemed to love this pizza, so it's just a matter of preference.
WHITE PIZZA - This was one of the standouts. The pizza was seasoned and cooked well. I could have eaten just this dish and been happy. 
EGGPLANT PARM - I absolutely love eggplant, but this wasn't my favorite preparation. Too much breading and the eggplant was sliced a little too thinly for my taste. I do enjoy how they serve ziti instead of spaghetti with this dish, since I'm not a fan of spaghetti.
ZEPPOLES - These were my favorite of all the desserts served. I usually don't enjoy Italian desserts since they are a little denser than I prefer, so the zeppoles stood out for being a little more subtle and not overly sweet. Plus, I can never resist powdered sugar. 
RAINBOW CAKE - This was a little on the dry side for me. A little too chocolatey as well, but that's just a matter of preference.
CANNOLI - I don't usually like cannolis and I can't say this one changed my mind about them. 
ASSORTED COOKIES - These were good. They have a number of varieties and I would be back for more of these for sure. 

Service was spectacular. Our drinks were kept full and everyone was extremely friendly and entertaining, making our meal that much more enjoyable. 

We all had a great meal and there were plenty of leftovers for all. I was able to take some home to my mom who's a pasta fanatic and she loved it. I'd definitely be back for pizza, tripe and dessert as those were my favorites from our meal.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,18,15,4,P9hsidWSqjjsz-XJO0KWGw
5984702,2015-07-30,0,NFMD_-wFrbfdhTcdHPDCZQ,"We've been here twice now in the past month since we moved from NY.  Makes us feel a little closer to home when we go.  :-)  The Rice Balls really took us back and the Lasagna Explosions (something we'd never even heard of before) were explosively delicious.

So far everything we've had has been very good (including the pizza we took home on our first visit) and very authentic (ie: huge portions).  The garlic knots are OUT OF THIS WORLD - I mean absolutely phenomenal.

Staff is VERY friendly and will literally HAUNT you if your glass if 1/2 full for a refill (that is NOT a complaint either).  They also push you for more garlic knots!  Which is unbelievable to us because how am I supposed to eat any of this food when I have an endless basket of Garlic Knots in front of me? o.O

Edited to add: The reason I give them 4 stars and not 5 is because literally every dish (aside from pizza or a salad) is ""over pasta"" - it's kind of annoying.  Basically, do not go here unless you're in the mood for pasta (or pizza - which is also very good).  We do eat here at least a few times a month and I have to say, they have the BEST sausage in Las Vegas!!",U8u1jGMpQiFMl5o_ZhOm_g,0,0,4,db23PGsMZSbAXzcwsCIJgg
