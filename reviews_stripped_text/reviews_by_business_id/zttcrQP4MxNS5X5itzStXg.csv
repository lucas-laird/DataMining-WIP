Simon
Korean Fried Chicken
Lumpia
Spam Musubi* we're saving those for later

We will be ordering from the through UberEATS again.
We give them 4/5 because the lumpia sauce was missing, and the simon was a bit small but good.",UCGMccnBlKtqFhS-sDRCYQ,2,0,4,OpMIJIHYsZT6QK4dW4IQ-Q

Chicken Katsu was good. The Pulehu steak on the other hand was not. I've had some real good Pulehu steak and this just tasted like hard cheap beef saut√©ed with onions. I am super disappointed. I would come back here only if I am in the area. Other than that I'm sticking to my 808 mixed plate on Craig!",1LzTG_mnu5xErJG_G44QOw,0,0,3,r4cuKrFb6VKYXTGqc_aMEw

The only little disappointment was in the spam musubi's only cause i wanted it to have a little more flavor. Like a splash of shoyu or teriyaki.",dct-Z72jZnpcEFoj21NU-A,4,2,5,lyFLGOFBMALyMgT5FtxGnw
2328489,2017-03-04,0,zttcrQP4MxNS5X5itzStXg,"I had the lechon kawali w/ tomato and onions. OMG!! This is the best I've had in Vegas (Thelma's being second). The lechon was nice & crisp when served to me... tomatoes was fresh & crisp, not soggy. They served the right amount of meat & fat.  Most places are so stingy and give you a bunch of fat pieces!  I'll def' be back for some of that! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I also tried the lumpia which was different. I'm so used to the traditional ground meat in there... not sure what kinda lumpia it is (my friend just offered me some).  It wasn't not good, I just didn't care for it.  The owners and staff are so welcoming!  They were closing and my friend and I were still talking/catching up.  They didn't force us to leave at all.  They said, we still gotta clean up in the back so we can all leave at the same time.  Such awesome people.",Wv7oZmgh0LKf8jLa9ikx4A,0,0,4,2mg0E2ZSaciScdIGnCPwsg

First I tried to order the pulehu steak with onions but unfortunately that's only served on the food truck (so we were told). Second I tried to order the breakfast special with french toast, Portuguese sausage, egg, and rice but unfortunately that's only a ""special"" so they never know when they're going to have that ""special"" (so we were told). Third I tried to order the 2 item with lechon kawali with onion and tomato and chicken adobo but unfortunately they ran out of lechon kawali (so we were told). Well... 3 strikes and you're out so we left! Too bad we couldn't try the food because I'm sure the food would've been delish... I would hope.",XX--i6RiqjGGTUg4XFNxfQ,3,0,1,jga06hi5Bb0FSxMiGgGRhg

Like other reviews the steak was chewy, but my Korean chicken was delicious.  I was impressed with the chow fun. Hard to find Hawaiian style chow fun in Vegas. Only Chinese style which I like from China one.  My brother said his bento and lechon was good. Saimin was good too. All in all, this place is worth a try.

Not a fancy place, but I'd rather have good food and good value than designer paper napkins - as most of my readers know by now.  

Military discount, easy parking, friendly staff.  
Con: No soda fountain when I went, so I could refill my soda water/lime.  I drink about 4 to 6  8oz servings of drink when I eat, so it's important to me.",5Wg5OanfZ4-2dCxEo-qjsw,0,0,4,6eJn1y1hIOwEHQVccNwVZg

4425973,2017-02-26,0,zttcrQP4MxNS5X5itzStXg,"Remembering how we all enjoyed the food truck when they're at Pure Aloha so we were very excited about the stand alone restaurant. I want to say fist and foremost about the effort and Aloha you get from the owner and workers, much Mahalos for that!
Pulehu steak and Korean chicken combo was all we used to order from the truck and would always only get that meal, and sometimes order that to go before leaving the event, Haha, how nutz is dat! 
Unfortunately Teri steak and a breaded steak instead is served and not the more basic Pulehu unless it's on a special? I was kinda confused about not having what to me makes them very popular with the truck?
Korean chicken was ONO as I remembered and I had it with the breaded Teri beef (not bad).
Kalua ""pork"" was a little bland and not very much of a portion for a single item entree.
The Teri beef was not very tasty at all and was very chewy.
Overall, just feels like they're still trying to work out the kinks on the menu, I can only imagine getting all of the suggestions from all the customers.
I think you're probably hearing the same things, ""do you have the Pulehu steak""? Haha, but I bet it's true.
I'm not biased on local foods at all and I know the differences between ""Hawaiian BBQ"" places and the real local Kine grinds in Vegas and Henderson and this one just fell a few spots on my list of to go places.
My 2 cents, Pulehu being the first, Korean chicken being the second items on the menu, and with the cool monitor menu..advertise your entrees with pictures! It'll be a lot more eye appeal just seeing how ONO everything looks before you order. 
You can never satisfy everyone, and the ""Flip Side"" of the menu only made me want to order Filipino food instead, but I drove 20 mins to get my local fix. Almost made me feel like I was ordering from a 2 restaurant menu instead of 1. 
I for one go to places where I know I can order and always be satisfied with the same good old food that there're popular for, I hope this place will be one of them in the future, but for now we'll have to wait and see.",qIOCztyFIOMm4oryf3xcZQ,0,0,3,Isv309Vd4wc8xzFWns_QkA

Ordered pork adobo but meat wasnt tender it was still hard, ordered lechon but it wasnt what i expected because it was cut into small pieces of pork thats deep fried and wasnt crispy enought!!! Hawaiian fried rice wasn't all that great!!!. Ordered peluha steak but it didnt have that much flavor!!! I don't whos their chef/cook but their food is nothing/waste of money compare to other filipino restaurants like Fiesta, Loraine, Nanay glorias, plus their food is more expensive than other filipino restaurants.
