40354,2015-10-02,0,OMUe6NNOFEe0VdAouIqAuA,"My office ordered lunch from here. We were one semi-large order, and so we didn't exactly expect the food to arrive in twenty minutes. However, we didn't expect to wait two hours for it either. We ordered for delivery, and our order consisted of two subs, a burger, the tortellini, and a calzone. Nearly two hours later, our food finally arrives. The delivery driver left our food and drove away without another word. Upon tasting our meals, we have come to the conclusion that the food was sub-par. Mostly bland and in dire need of seasoning, our food was chewy and soggy. We had high hopes after looking at such a beautiful menu, but were greatly disappointed. My office will not be ordering here again.",Mu69hxrkc6QAN9gZ-Lf2-Q,0,0,1,KrhOhVcoh9HNqmsv8Zxcxw

The pictures looked really delicious but then again looks can be deceptive. So 35 dollars and 30 minutes later, my pizza gets delivered. Well safe to say, the pizza was nothing like I had expected. I ordered a simple pepperoni pizza, you can't really mess that up right? Wrong!!! The pizza was extremely greasy, literally there was grease dripping from every slice and the crust was saturated with it.

The first time I ordered the 1/2 chicken plate, it was good. Today I had it, and the chicken was horribly overcooked, the rice was undercooked and hard as can be and the pita was dry and hard, tasting days old.

Even though we've got a few pizza and kebob places nearer to home (about 250 miles away) we happened to have a restaurant.com certificate and thought we would give it a try. Showed up and no one was here. It's a not a very large restaurant, but they have an extensive menu!  From Italian to Middle Eastern. We ordered the XLarge Steak Pizza ($16.99) which is about the middle of the road size they have and it was awesome. The crust was soft, but crispy on the bottom. Unlike other pizza's we've had this one had no oily/greasy feel or taste.  Also ordered the Beef Chicken combo ($13.95)  It was out of this world.  Such Great Flavor!  If you're in the area, it's definately worth a try!  For the person that gave this place one star... There has to be a reason your ordered from them ""8 Times""!!  They are good.  Don't use a 3rd party ""Eat24Hours"" if they keep fudging up the order.  Call Sofia's directly!  I doubt highly they will mess up and if they do, I'm sure they'll fix it prompty.

The Veggie Plate:  The hummus was so oily! It also had a stange taste to it. The spanikopita was soggy. The falafel was inedible. The dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) were ""ok"". I also ordered feta cheese, it was way over salted. Basically, out of the whole plate, I managed to eat only the stuffed grape leaves. The rest of the plate was pretty inedible.

954429,2014-03-01,0,OMUe6NNOFEe0VdAouIqAuA,"Got a steak hoagie from Sofia's as takeout and was really disappointed when i got home and opened the bag. 

This is what they advertise their sandwich as:
Subs and grinders are served on a fresh Italian roll. Subs are topped with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions and mayo. Grinders are baked until golden brown. Deluxe includes French fries. Combo includes French fries and a small fountain drink or can of soda.

First off, I had to basically build my sandwich. The bread wasn't sliced open fully, more like sliced to make a pocket in which a minimal amount of thin sliced steak (which was tasty) was crammed, and about a half a head of shredded lettuce was jammed into (which mostly fell out) it. The tomatoes were cut like someone had done it with a butter knife and were on top of my fries, (this is not due to carrying the bag, I was careful) There was no onions anywhere, nor mayo, or any condiments at all. 
I got the combo, and my fries were really, really really really salty... once I had a bite of one I immediately had to have a sip of root-beer that was included in my meal. I can't be for certain because I took one sip and immediately spit it out as my soda tasted like someone hooked a liquid soap dispenser to the soda fountain. 

Between part of my sandwich having been missing, overly salty fries, putrid fountain soda, no napkins and slow sloppy service ( I didn't include that part of my experience, but when you see a customer walk into your spot, you should think about greeting them and asking if they've been served) I'm really not sure how this place stays in business. My experience was pretty bad just based on food quality and I will not be back for any reason, will not be suggesting this spot to anyone that is actually looking to have a decent meal.",zkafDF4EBrA2jNPCFByq-g,1,0,2,pl4KAO0r6jcp07dcVCXsNw

So far I've stuck to the Med menu, with several sandwiches and gyros you can't go wrong. I prefer to get anything with the garlic sauce, ask for extra on the side. It's flavorful but the bread is a little thicker than expected, and if the chicken is a little on the dry side, the sauce helps. I don't normally like pickles on my sandwiches, but here they add that perfect element that takes it to the next level.

Service is quick, menu is extensive, they have a large dining room and delivery service. But that garlic sauce is what you need to get here. I would buy it bottled.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,6,3,swlS3O4cI0nzFfIJLSruAQ

1976765,2016-02-16,0,OMUe6NNOFEe0VdAouIqAuA,"This is in my top 5 for delivery, especially because it's a non pizza option. Reasonable delivery times and good food and fair prices. 

My go to item is the beef shawarma, which is served with tahini sauce, onions, and tomatoes. I like to get the tzatziki on the side and spoon it onto my Shawarma or dip fries. 

The cheeseburgers are also super delicious. Big seasoned patties with lots of veggies. The hubby likes his special order without certain items, so I put in the special instruction on Eat24 and they have never messed up an order. Definitely a winner for this reason. 

We've also ordered the cheesesteak sandwich, chicken fingers, and calzones, which were also decent in terms of taste. Most items are served a la carte or combo with fries or fries&drink (fountain or can). The cheesecake is tasty for desert. 


As for service/delivery I always use eat24 for my orders. Only once have I phoned the restaurant directly. I order fries but they heard rice, so a communications error. No big deal. Kind of funny actually when I realized what happened. I never called to complain and I've ordered from them several times since (via Eat24).  Definitely not a deal breaker. Particularly since they've never messed up an order through Eat24. Delivery is usually pretty quick and always within specified timeframe. It's usually the same driver and he recognizes us every time. 

I should add that there's a nearby spot on w Sahara called ""Sophia's"" (I think it's a chain in town) which I have mistakenly ordered from thinking it was this ""Sofia's.""  They are not the same and the food quality/service aren't on par with one another either. Choose Sofia's.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,4,4,5,yghGeRcKmpaTBasAXF92-w

3290789,2012-02-21,0,OMUe6NNOFEe0VdAouIqAuA,"Stopped in on a random afternoon for lunch.  The shop is in the same plaza as my office, so it seemed convenient.

Appearance... right off the bat, the 'storefront' has little to offer.  Little to no decor, aged tables & chairs and a horrific odor that nearly made me leave upon entry.

Service... there were two people there a young man, and a middle-aged woman. I wasn't greeted by either.  I placed my order, (the young man took the order), offered to upgrade to a value meal and cashed me out without incident.

Quality...  Beverage selection was extremely limited.  They had two coolers, but only about a quarter full with limited sodas and bottled water.  I ordered a simply cold sandwich, with fries, both great tasting and hearty servings.  One small concern is the person preparing my food (the same young man who checked me out) accepted two cell phone calls while making my sandwich, one has to wonder how 'sanitary' his phone is!!!

Overall a pretty average experience and slightly above average quality and portions.  Pricing and parking are excellent, location can be a bit hard to find, so just pull in the plaza at the corner of W. Sahara and Monte Christo.

I'm kind of scared to eat them. They do have good pizza but I was so disappointed when I got my wings.",pjYcv0ANoYaAmLd2QhYc5g,2,0,2,EupzQJlcYMwNWS2kEGooPA

The 9:30 delivery time came and went. Turns out the restaurant closes at 9:30. I called the Beyond Menu customer service number, and the customer service representative tells me the order was confirmed with the restaurant. I try to call the restaurant again, and so does the customer service representative. Guess what? My husband and I have no food, and you can't get a hold of anyone at the restaurant because they are closed. Don't confirm orders you have no intention of fulfilling. Thank goodness Beyond Menu was nice enough to refund my money!",Gek8x-Gt3NS8tfWMYjURSA,3,2,1,anfwylVNZhXw-12XVFSmGQ

After attempting to place a delivery order at another Mediterranean restaurant and being treated extremely rudely by their telephone order person, I remembered that Sophia's would deliver Gyros. I am so glad that my craving for Gyros led me to try one from Sophia's! The food was fantastic, the delivery was speedy, and the delivery man was so nice. I will definitely be recommending Sophia's to others in my complex and will be ordering from them again soon!",6BzjS5A-QvRBvw5G2QDEVA,0,0,5,6bMYHhOXZHKOCfn-17m-Rw

But the food is okay too nothing unique. And the price is changing everytime i order. LOL!,hUzr-j6GXzpeSttMuDXGDw,2,1,3,T1vEpy0gUeomHAm3kM8qQA
5624407,2012-10-08,3,OMUe6NNOFEe0VdAouIqAuA,The gyro plate and feta and everything is so good that I can't help but fantasize that I am some secret agent ready to take a bullet for Sofia's Cafe.  I keep a steely hawk eyed stare at all times to protect her and I utilize brutal forms of open handed combat inspired by the wild boar in order to better defend her honor.  The grape leaves are really good and the yogurt sauce should just be called yogi sauce since it activates my deeper inner realms of enlightenment with the sheer yum yum of it.  The baba ganoush woops some bunghole too!,lGSJnW9_MX2KJ36_OX6DLg,2,0,5,vrTkjQPogqrfIbJG6jmWUA

But tried there fish n chips, the fish was kind of chewy? Tried the wings as well it was okay. Smelt like vinegar. But wish they had more variety of sauces.
