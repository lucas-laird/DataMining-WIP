48905,2014-08-30,0,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"Not sure what's going on with this place. It used to be one of the best bars in SW Vegas. The level of customer service has fallen off big time in recent years. Last week I went there with a couple of friends around 9 pm and sat at the bar. The bartender came over, said hi, and then walked away. We didn't see her again for like 15 minutes. When it's 90+ degrees outside and you just want a cold beer, it sucks having to wait 15+ minutes to even put in your first order.

If the place had been super busy, I probably could have understood, but it wasn't. Similar ""lapses"" have happened in the past year or so, although this was the worst by far. They also have a problem with adding extra stuff to a bill ""by accident"" and still trying to charge you for it after you pointed out the mistakes.

This is a nice bar in a nice location so I hope management can fix the problems asap!",H4Btu-Vx5Crk_d5f3vkN8w,2,0,2,7bRZ77t8wmzAm_mSqqN1Og

I've had three different servers and the service has always been good, I don't think my drink has ever gone empty.  Of course my favorite server is Christy as she usually brings us some nice, warm, free cookies for dessert.  Christy's cookies are the best, no euphemisms here!

Most of the food has been pretty good, my faves so far are the Ahi Tuna Salad and the Ahi Tuna Sandwich.  Mmmm, I wish I was eating some now instead of this cold pizza hut, yuck!

I enjoyed all of the wraps except for the fajita wrap, ugh, hard to explain but it sort of had a slimy texture.  Just not too good.

Most items come with fries or you can upgrade for a 50 cent charge to curly fries, onion rings  or several other items.

Today I had the french dip.  Pretty standard operating procedure here except for the Flamin Hot Cheetos battered onion rings that accompany the sandwich.  Sounds awesome right?  Using something that's been fried as batter so that you can fry it again.  I have to hand it to them, it's a great concept.  The execution, however, isn't quite there.  These should be orgasmic and they just sort of taste like onion rings.

1. Brady  who supposedly is the manager , when you're gambling I always thought drink for complimentary at least one so when the guest sitting next to you which was me drinking beer and the players drinking tequila shots obviously depending on what you play you come the players drink not the person sitting next to you beer , this guy had the audacity to tell me he comps the least expensive drinks whoever's playing or not
 
2. Today 10 /4/15 decided to give this bar another try for  football season, we ordered shots of Don Julio silver chilled the bartender again same bartender Brady proceeded to pour patron Reposado not chilled , when I told the waitress the shots were not correct Bradley was irritated and upset

We sat down and had our drinks fairly quickly. After his client arrived, our waitress came back to our table promptly. We ordered my all time favorite: the Flamin' Hot Cheetos Onion Rings.

However, I'm on a mission to stay away from junk, and considering my guilt from the Onion Rings I tried to keep it ""healthy"" with a salad, dressing on the side. Not a great choice, but oh well, lesson learned and it wasn't horrible, just not good. Caramelized onions were in a giant heap, lettuce wasn't plentiful and overall the dressing lacked flavor.

_Bucket of curly fries (gotta love'em)
_ZOOKIE (too good to be true! The warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whip cream, & dizzled with chocolate/caramel just hits the spot to that sweet tooth crave)

My friend def enjoyed her grilled cheese burger. I ordered the ham sandwich which had apples in it. It was so tasty & the fries are the bomb. Everything was solid.
The only downfall I would say is that I did notice someone smoking which made me realize why I don't visit this establishment often as there is no patio to escape to.

I ordered a glass of wine for my wife and bottled water for myself and it took alot longer than it should have, the bar had a  few people in there but it really wasn't THAT busy, but we eventually got our drinks, I tipped appropriately and when it came time to order my next one, I heard lots of ""be right with you"" from a few different people, and lots of eye contact, hand raising, waving money,  but no service.  15 minutes later in a bar that isn't busy at all, I ended up just walking away, of course at that point the girl asked ""what can I get you honey"".  I just said ""never mind"" and now I know not to go in there again, a shame because we initially thought about renting the room from them again in the future. Also, no waitresses came into our room to see if we needed a refill or took away any empty glasses, which is usually the case in other establishments, but there were several walking around the rest of the place.  Oh well, you heard it here, maybe this place is more into taking care of their regulars and ignoring the newcomers, or maybe it was just an off night, either way, they presented nothing for me to want to return.",pK6nf46LIccTQwon-Gunew,0,0,2,gg8YrsosqWsiWXaFOHJYIg

I ordered a $5 happy hour appetizer. Upon review of my bill, I was charged $7.99 for the appetizer. When I asked the bartender about she said it should be $5. She did correct it (which, apparently, was quite the process). When she brought the corrected bill back she commented that it took forever and literally threw the bill on the bar at me.

Sierra Gold has a variety of beers and a cider on tap, the later of which was my preference. I wish they had more than one flavor cider, but at least they had one! We had an assortment of food, but the chicken fingers and fries were the best option. The fingers were a good size, the sauce was good and well mixed, and the fries were great.

1510572,2015-04-28,1,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"Short version: clean sports bar like environment with  above average bar food quality but extremely helpful and engaging staff. I'd give a 3.5 stars if I could give a half star rating but will round up to a 4 star review because of the great service we received.

Was in town for a seminar and after the saturday session, a few of us were looking for a place to grab some food, have some drinks, and watch the nba playoffs. One of the local guys suggested Sierra gold. It was near by so we headed over.

As we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the large center bar. The restaurant was a large, multi level room with a, what appeared to be a VIP section to the side. The overall ambiance felt like a slightly upscale sports bar. The lighting throughout was a bit dim but not too dark to feel uncomfortable walking around. There was no hostess but one of the bartenders told us to grab a seat anywhere we liked. 

We found a tall table with stools near one of the many TVs showing the warriors game. We were quickly greeted by someone and given menus. Only a couple of minutes later, our waitress approached. She was friendly and took our order. We were lucky and arrived 20 minutes before happy hour ended at 7pm so we were able to each order a half off speciality thin crust pizza ($10.50 for happy hour), some beers and an order of spinach and artichoke dip.

My friend's beer came out quickly. I waited about 5-7 minutes but mine hadn't come yet. The appetizer came out about 7 minutes after we ordered and I asked our waitress about my beer. She went to check and quickly came back with my beverage. She said she was sorry for the delay and said she would remove the drink from our bill. It was a kind gesture from her and I'm not sure how many waiters and waitress would do that as I hadn't been waiting too long for my drink but I was not expecting that at all. She earned herself an extra tip and an extra half star rating for her great service.

About 8 minutes after getting our appetizers, our pizzas came out. We quickly realized we ordered too much food. The pizzas were all good and tasty. They were dense enough to fill you up but definitely light enough and not too oily to not feel disgusting from eating it. We ended up taking half of each pizza home since we were stuffed. As for the spinach artichoke dip, the dip itself was good, the tortilla chips were standard restaurant quality multi colored tortilla chips, but the toasted bread was a bit stale.

Overall, it was a nice place that gave a sports bar atmosphere. If I were in the area, I'd drop in again for a drink and some food.",V4U8GXEp4nouIt9modAU-A,1,0,4,fXnhrpwM-Zu8knzU-896_A

The decor is nicer, it's less smokey, and it has an upstairs, which I've had a meeting at before, pretty swank.
The prices-I'm not sure if it's the same or higher; haven't been in another one in a while, but they do also use the beer n bites card and have the same happy hour and awesome menu (Gilroy, yum)
I stayed briefly, long enough to eat pizza, have 2 beers, and run, but I enjoyed my experience.
The bartenderesses are all lovely and leather-vest clad, and everyone was friendly. Food came out fast, as it was not busy at all during this time. I got to sit where I wanted.

Our server was very nice and attentive. Except the fact later on in the night, one of her nipples were showing! 

Another thing, we ordered Jameson shots chilled. I think they forgot about our shots because it took forever for it to come. After we took them, it seriously tasted like water and Jameson. Gross. 

Now then bartenders could be a little more nicer and help out people that are on the other side of the bar. We were at the bar and it was so hard to flag down a bartender just to cash out!

Sierra Gold is just about as close a bar could get minutes away. I never been here but always been fan of the whole PT group of bars. I know they have couple different brands or types between regular PT's, PT's Gold, or the Sierra Gold. Guess each one suppose to be more upscale with the interior decor and the little things. I can say Sierra Gold definitely feels nothing like PT's. I like about it.

This review is for two visits to sierra gold. the first was a visit at lunch time on a weekday and th eother is for a sunday night party we had their oct 30th for my husbands birthday. 

The week day visit was okay. service was good. prices a little high for my liking. Nice portion sizes. I love the decor of the bar. Feels very nice compared to other bars in las vegas. The big boothd and chairs are very comfy and cozy. They give off that homie feeling you get when being in the comfort of your own house. 

Our waitress was helpful. explained the menu, daily specials and specials for it being a monday night football day. 

Husband ordered the hot wings and fries. it was a good amount and he loved that it came in a bucket. easy to eat and he said since he had left over he just needed a lid. Awesome. my dish was a make your own burger. It was huge. I ordered a chicken burger with bacon, cheese and grilled onions. Gosh it was so big i had enough for dinner that night. It was a little pricey but after seeing the portion you understand why. 12 bucks, eh i guess i shouldnt complain. 

Took a little long for our food considering it was lunch but i cut them some slack since they were busy. Which is a great sign. 

Our next visit for my husbands birthday gave me mixed exmotions which is why i went with 3 stars. The first visit was easily a 4 but after the horrible service we recieved i knocked it down one more star. 

We paid a 20 dollar deposit to reserve the louge, which i couldn't believe was so cheap. The lougne was exceptional. Large couches, a little bar area to sit and eat your food. 3 TV's. Nice art of beautiful half naked ladies on the wall. The suckie part was, they charged us a butt load for drinks, i couldn't believe how expensive it was. Ive drank for way cheaper on the strip at planet hollywood. We had about 20 people come in a matter of 7 to 8 hours. (we had the invite from 730pm to 230am. It also was bullshit that since we were in the lounge we were not able to get the specials. Not cool. Everyone was drinking left and right, especially ordering drinks for the loud birthday boy. You would think that the waitress would give better service; ordering tons of drinks, some food, etc. No she had a major attitude problem and we had to leave the lounge and walk to her at her other tables to get any attention. it was ridiculous. 

As someone who has worked in customer service for years and years I was highly disappointed. She was constantly making snotty and snippy remarks to our guests. Rolling her eyes. And being difficult.

Our 2nd visit was so bad with customer service that I will not be coming back during the night time service, only for lunch.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,0,0,3,TUwhCT_iLZCNzfjMDvc_Xg

We sat at the bar, and the place was pretty packed after a recent concert and it was happy hour as well. Service was actually really quick. All staff was friendly.  

We went with a margarita pie because it was 50% off...and now I know why.  I am not a fan of thin crust. I don't like picking up what seems like a tortilla and having all the toppings fold over. Being a margarita pizza, obviously there are not many toppings on it.  The sauce was rancid. It was like they took a can of tomato paste and slathered it all over the tortilla like crust.  Cheese was good, as was the fresh chopped basil, but what a waste of good toppings on a crappy crust and sauce.  I never liked the thin crust/tortilla like crusts that PT's group has. Especially if you're not there for happy hour when they're 50% off, you're paying full price for something that should cost $5-$8 given the size and thickness of the pizza.

When I arrived the place was empty but it must be a pretty popular spot for lunch. By the time my clam chowder arrived at the table this place was starting to fill up. The service was better when we first arrived due to the fact that we had the waiters undivided attention. We weren't exactly neglected after the lunch crowd filed in but it took a little longer to get my water glass refilled. I guess that's to be expected. 

My chowder came out the perfect temperature in a large bowl accompanied by a package of oyster crackers and a bottle of tabasco. All set! Great temp, good presentation, mediocre soup. Ehh, I've had better clam chowder on the salad bar at a buffet. There were lots of large chunks of red skinned potatoes and not much else. It was a hearty serving of chowder but it was mostly filler and only a few small clams. I'm pretty sure I paid $6.99 for a bowl of potato soup masquerading as clam chowder. 

Meal aside, this place gets a 3 star A-OK from me because of the wonderful smoke-free atmosphere. That goes a long way when I pass judgment on a place. Clean air and enforced no smoking is worth a star or two any day.",u9w4LOoKYsM00Scb0HCH1w,1,0,3,3Z0SnX9spwCYsTKx7b40Xg

Having to ask for the check after we've been done eating almost 45 minutes is annoying. Having to wait an additional 20 minutes to find someone to take my credit card is even more annoying. 

I've been here a couple times on busy Football nights and each time the bar was completely full, but there were people sitting at machines not playing, and I was looking to lose money. That's a pet peeve of mine. If one person is sitting down and four people are hovering around them and you're just sitting at a machine but not playing/not planning to, have some decency to move over. 

The food is pretty good, not as greasy as most bar foods, but typical PT's/Sierra Gold fare. This place is pretty big. One night we walked in and found a group playing Yahtzee in the corner at a table - those people were awesome.

One note, and maybe this shouldn't surprise me but it's never been a problem before - apparently it's not OK to smoke clove cigarettes at this bar. While I was losing money at a machine, my friend was smoking and there was no problem.

However when we pulled up, it was a pub.  Yeap.  Greasy pub food. Yum.

Two things that bothered me though.  The first was that it seemed like the music was turned up pretty loud.  Understandably, it is a pub, but at one point, someone decided to jack with the sound system and turn it up even more annoyingly loud.  To the point where you had to yell to hear anyone speaking.

That was alleviated finally after someone fixed it, but it was interesting that someone wanted to mess with the sound volume in the first place when most of the people in there were your normal business lunch crowd.

The other was the fact that the waitress didn't even bother to check if my credit card was even in the payment jacket thingiemajiggy.  I literally was looking all around and was about to have a melt down until one of my co-workers spotted my lonely card on the floor.

I mean, I know I'm good lookin' but really now... I didn't think that waitress wanted me for my card that bad.... or... so I had thought.

In any case, the ordered french dip that came with au jus, and horseradish sauce (you know, horseradish + sour cream) was delish.  Everything seemed okay except the issues above.  Now whether or not future visits will have the same results remains to be seen.

Regardless, they had very cheap, very large beers. For dinner I got the seared ahi salad, it was really good and it didn't overly fill me up  like bar food would have. With everything I got, 5 huge beers and the salad, it was just over $30 bucks, so I was very pleased. 

We left for a while and came back for some drunk food and beers. I ordered a pizza and curly fries, the pizza was shitty and I ended up giving half it to my cab driver on my ride home.

In a nutshell Sierra Gold is a bigger nicer version of PTs. The food, drinks, and prices are essentially the same. Complete with pool tables, a lounge, and even a upstairs event room, Sierra Gold is everything you have come to expect from a PTs and more. 

To be honest the only time I set foot in here is for happy hour. 50% off all drinks and pizzas from 5pm - 7pm and 12am - 2am. In fact this probably the only reason anyone I know comes here. With the HH, drinks actually become reasonably priced: $3.75 for the big mugs, and $2.50 for the small. The pizzas are decent; the Gilroy with it's white sauce, mushrooms and pepperoni is a favorite and you can't go wrong with the BBQ chicken. . 

Service varies depending on when you come. During the day the place is barren, but show up on a weekend night around 12 and you will be hard pressed to find a server.

I ordered a ciroc and soda and wasn't quite sure what I received. The clear cocktail in front of me was extremely sweet. When I finally got the attention from the ""inappropriate for her size"" sleazy dressed bartender I told her I had the wrong drink. She remade it and it still tasted the exact same. Extremely sweet. I sent it back and made sure she understood REGULAR ciroc vodka, with club soda. She came back and yet again. It was still sweet. My girlfriend tried it and told me it had to be peach flavored vodka. When I told the bartender she tasted it and said someone had to of ""married"" the wrong bottles together. Now I come from a long history of working in bars and I know for a fact that pouring 1 bottle of liquor into another bottle is totally against the law.

With lack of better judgement we ordered food. I had the steak fajitas, I specifically asked for no dairy considering I'm allergic to lactose. When my fajitas arrived they were smoothered in sour cream. The bartender then told me she didn't know sour cream was dairy. Smh. I paid my bill and we left right away.

3460503,2011-02-02,2,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"Before the review, I have to admit that I have an automatic dislike for establishments such as this. I don't go to sports bars, don't watch ESPN or Fox News and don't fancy having to choose from a menu that promises cardiovascular disease.  Lunch for me involves conversation, delicate food and pleasant service. 

None of this was achieved today at lunch at Sierra Gold. Suffice to say I didn't have a say in the lunch choice. 

I ordered the Pear & Arugula Salad ($10). The pears were very strange. They seemed to have been soaked in a marinade for a very long time and were soggy and tasted quite offensive. The portion of salad was enormous with a generous heaping of fresh arugula as well as candied pecans. The dressing was very average and the star of this dish was the 3 fried onion strings that they threw on the top. Yes three. I count this as one of the top five worst meals of my life. 

The service here was very lukewarm. No one on the waitstaff really wanted to be there. Our orders were taken right and the drinks were filled.

I've been here before and had the Garden Vegetable Pizza which was just slightly better than this salad. 

Since I'm already looking towards the future in trepidation of my next trip to this joint, I'm going to have to give this place 2 stars. 

1 star for the convenient location off 215 and 1star for forcing me to diet today with the abysmal meal I had.

Unfortunately, PTs (the parent company) seems to have changed their image towards trying to be an upscale bar and restaurant rather than the great locals value that made it so popular. So now it feels like a Yard House with less choice and specials.

Whether it is Sierra Gold or PTs Gold or whichever, their happy hour seems to no longer cover any of their better beers - they are pushing their local brew and domestics. So no more half priced Blue Moons for me.

Additionally, they have fewer and fewer options for food on happy hour. For football specials, they basically dropped all their good specials. They used to have a double cheeseburger for 5 or 6 dollars. What used to be our favorite place for watching a game is no longer even an option to us.

Additionally, service is generally pretty slow here, so there's very little reason to come here anymore.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,1,0,3,4PluvW0wqb_tdD0tBFtskg
3592624,2011-08-21,0,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"My first visit to Sierra Gold saw a loss of $40 for me and $20 for my friend in the poker machines before anyone ever stopped by to say hello or take our order - and it wasn't even busy. After that, I was certain it would take angelic intervention to get me back.

While I did see some angels on my second visit, none of them were flying. 

It was Friday happy hour and the place was hoppin', although due in large part to a college reunion group who were having a great time and passing that happiness on to the rest of the bar.

I ordered their half-price HH special sausage and pepperoni pizza. The angel behind the bar asked if I wanted basil on top - what a refreshing suggestion. 

The pizza crust was good and crispy, but very bland. The sauce and topping were good, but would have been great if there was just a little more sauce. Much to my chagrin, HH special half price pizza is actually $10, plus $1 for every topping (yep, they charged me a buck for the basil). Total damage was $15, before tip. For a crispy thin-crust pizza, that's not a special, it's a rip-off. 

At this point our foursome was having a great time with the angels who tended bar and some others who were making their way through the crowd.  The place was about to get, let's say, maybe a 4 star rating  - despite some miserable happy hours prices.

Then disaster struck - happy hour ended and the angels behind the bar were replaced by pissy young men with little sense of humor and even less personality.  

The place took a dramatic change of moods in just a matter of moments and all-of-a-sudden we couldn't wait to get out. 

I leave the review with a shaky 3 star rating and some very strong suggestions to management - reconsider your HH prices and get rid of those depressing boys. Seriously, they were all in such a pissy mood, you could literally see the happiness evaporating from the faces of patrons all around the bar.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,2,0,3,POnVo8rkcAi4YiTjU8D62Q
3617672,2011-02-06,0,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"I recently turned 21 and a couple of friends brought me here for my first bar/happy hour experience. Wooo!

My initial impressions is that its in a nice neighborhood, doesn't feel run down, and the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. Sierra Gold was probably half full, people were having a good time, and some were making out at the bar.. alright! 

The happy hour special is after 12, requires a beer bytes card, and is consisted of half off pizzas and all drinks. Had a large Blue Moon which was in a big mug (maybe 2 bottles?) but had a tiny orange slice. Aw come on now.. the orange is not a decoration it has a real purpose. 

One of my friends ordered his pizza first while me and my other friend decided to think a bit more, it was another 15 minutes before we saw the waitress again, kind of slow.. but understandable I suppose since she was the only waitress taking care of 6 or 7 parties.

So the pizzas were decent, but I'm not expecting something crazy from a bar. It was a thin crust but had many specialty choices like the fajita pizza. I noticed a bit of inconsistency between my fajita pizza and my friend's hunter pizza, his toppings covering almost the pizza to the edge and mine was 2 inches short from the edge. Oh well not a big deal.

Its hard not to want to come back though with the decent food and cheap drinks. Hours and hours can pass away with some friends and a buzz.. which is why I'll be back :)",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,0,0,3,TM3BcGEqNNF3HnIXouARDA

If you're looking to host a small - medium group i highly recommend this location as they have two venues they can host you and they can even offer the happy hour rates to individuals attending. Their food also is really good. It's perfectly priced and the quality is great.

I moved to Summerlin so this location became a mid-point for meetings. Great location but due the food quality and lack of personalised service I had to moved from 5 stars to 4 stars.

The greens they used were like those wild green salads you buy in the store. You know, the ones that taste like dirt? They were not firm and this was hardly a chopped salad with minimal ingredients.

As I dived my way deeper into the salad I stated getting a funky taste like some of the salad was turning.

I love Sierra Gold!  This place is always poppin' and at any time of day.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner here 24-7 and they have 2 happy hours.  The bartenders and waiters are always inviting when you come in the door, and the atmosphere is super chill.  It's a nice weekly hangout and good for Monday night football, Sunday football, and pretty much for any game as they have a number of TVs available to watch any game playing on any given day.

Their menu is fairly extensive but I enjoy a few things that are at the top of my must eat on a monthly basis list:

# 1 - Gilroy Pizza.  Best thin crust pizza on their menu.  All pizzas are half off during their happy hour!

# 2 - Wings. with any sauce on the side.  They have a number of sauces to choose from!

# 3 - Tuna Panini Sandwich - it's a hit or miss, but if they make it right; it's so good because of the extra cucumber crisp they add in the sandwich.

# 4 - Peanut Butter Cookie Pazookie! Yum!  Best dessert to indulge in when you're having a bad day.

You can gamble on their video poker bartops, sports bet, and they even have a secret rewards program for women who gamble in the bar.  Awesome!

Their private dining area with the big screen TV only costs $20 to rent plus of course you have to purchase food and drink, but there is no minimum tab which is awesome.

Think of a warm fresh cookie straight out the oven underbaked in a ramekin topped off with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.   Now picture your nipples harden with every bite and a smile so cheesy that even the PDA to the 3rd power couples next to you is weirded out.

This is a good dessert if you want to either share with a special friend or just want to treat yourself something very delectable.  I'd scrap every last bite whenever i get to order this goodness.

Of the other food i tried, i think the Steak and Eggs is a good bargain.  You get 3 eggs, an 8oz steak, Country Hash Potatoes, and a side of Toast for like 9.99.  Not bad considering it's a bar.

Pretzel bites were soggy and overly salty.  The cheese and sweet and sour sauce that came with it were cool.  A cup of chili to start my meal was mediocre.  I prefer the Chili at Wendy's but that's just me.  Overall everything else i tried here wasn't too bad for a late night meal

This was just confusing because we weren't sure if our server was coming back or who was taking our table/section over? We came one more time just for a few beers and as we were sitting for a while no one came by the table so we just decided to order our drinks at bar and bring them back to the table.  I'm giving 3 stars for the service which is not consistent as well as the food quality which is not consistent either.  The happy hour is not bad though and at least they have a few more food options available then most bars, we also like the atmosphere here.",xLoEhU6zvFzcc0erH7gfyg,0,2,3,1W6msKXMZ6Xc_pt6KGaXJA

Service is usually good to great at this location, though it can get a bit busy around industry lunch time. Today I went for a 'healthier' option opting for the chicken fajita bowl. I have to say I was a bit unimpressed with the drab plate that came out of the kitchen. There was 7 small cuts of chicken, a few stringy veggies, and a bunch of soy sauce on the rice (for a fajita bowl?? That should be the teriyaki bowl). I was unimpressed with my meal, coming to $13. Why are the healthier options always skimpy and more expensive? That's my only complain this time, the only item I ordered. PUT MORE MEAT ON THE PLATE! 
Everyone else at my table was satisfied, however the boneless wings the table got were very hard- over cooked, maybe they had been cooked and were sitting under the heat lamp for a while. Not sure.

Sierra Gold is a upscale tavern with even a part of the PT's group which I wasn't aware of.  Parking is easy to locate since the parking lot is large.

There were five in our party and we were seated where a pool table was once located. The waitresses here are really hot looking and ours was no exception. Tattooed and friendly she was on her game. I went with the ahi salad which was delish. Generous amounts of sliced ahi over mixed greens with jicama, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, pickled ginger, wasabi and sesame dressing.

But the reason Im finally writing a review and giving this place a 2 star is due to my recent visit on 6/4/11 night shift. I came in to meet a few friends, got a couple of beers, signed my check and called it a night. Upon reading my bank statement yesterday, it appears I was double charged on the tip I left.

4309106,2016-03-24,1,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"Wow. This is the first time I wrote a review while I was in the venue but that's how great of an experience I had here. Originally I stopped by for a quick drink to kill some time in between errands & heard many great things about it from friends. I ordered my go-to (grey goose dirty martini, extra dirty, no olives) Although dirty martinis are a common cocktail, I find that rarely do bartenders make it right. But it was perfect. My bartender was this cute girl w/braces (never caught her name) but super friendly, attentive service. When I checked my schedule, I realized that I had an extra hour to kill rather than 30 minutes so I ordered the Cajun ahi salad. My food literally came in less than 10 min. But the best part was that my ahi tuna salad came with 8 HEARTY WHOLE pieces of ahi. I'm a creature of habit, so when I order ahi salads at other places, I almost expect a measly 4-5 pieces at the most. Not only did I have a great portion, but the quality of fish was soooo good. (Trust me, I'm Asian, I know) the wasabi aioli on the side & sesame dressing really complimented the ahi. + it's only $13?! For the portion of fish they give, this could easily been a $20 salad anywhere else. I guess what took me most by surprise is that this is a neighborhood bar. Although I expected good drinks, I did not expect their food quality to be that great. But it more than exceeded it. Also, cool non-creepy bar patrons. Everybody just does their own thing. As a single gal that loves to be left alone, it's a major plus.. Will definitely be my go to neighborhood bar. You rock Sierra. 5 stars+

P.s never smelled any smoke the whole time. & the bathrooms smell nice haha. & nice lighting. Girls dig that Shit.

UPDATE: Docking a star. Maybe I spoke too soon. When I asked to close out & to watch my drink while I went to the bathroom, they decided to instead clear it. If I wasn't on a time crunch I would've been an asshole about it. But still... Not cool dude. Ask next time ladies, before you clear it!!

I came here for happy hour with my co-workers. I wasn't very excited about this place, because my first experience here was just mediocre. However, being the new guy in the office, I was thrilled to get an invite to hang out with popular workers in the office.  I went to the bathroom and told myself to suck it up and try not to be weird. It was my first invite in 6 months, so I really, really didn't want to screw this up.

I was surprised how busy the place was. I was equally surprised that we were able to get a table without waiting. I got a frosty 24 oz mug of Guinness for $3.50. After drinking and laughing, I got hungry and ordered a large pizza. The pizza was 50% off during happy hour and it was amazing. I went with the Gilroy and it was loaded with toppings and had a very thin, crisp crust. Freakin' delicious! For $9.99, that is really hard to beat. My only compliant is they need some more items on the happy hour munchies menu. I wouldn't mind chowing down some nachos, fries, or wings. Service is okay and bathrooms are clean. Overall, great experience.

My street creds:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,1,1,4,rGxx_VZzc2TTtulQ-1nYsw

4702516,2014-03-17,5,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"The draw of Sierra Gold: decent food, great prices, nice interior/furniture, flexible hours, and location. Sounds like a recipe for success. Great way to screw it up: inconsistencies with food quality and more importantly, customer service. I've been here more times than I can count and it was a solid choice for quick eats and gatherings. After my last experience, the chances of another visit is zero. 

One month prior to a surprise party I was planning for Ruben's 30th birthday, I called them for information regarding their VIP lounge. I was told that it was just $40 to reserve the room and that a menu wasn't required (guests could order and pay freely). It was perfect for what I needed! I asked for a particular date and after being on hold for a few minutes, the associate confirmed that the date was available. Before providing my credit card information for the deposit, I confirmed that it was indeed their VIP lounge, etc. Everything was good to go and I was stoked! I created invitations, secretly invited guests, and planned how it would all go down.

I arrived at SG approximately 30-45 minutes prior to the time I asked the guests to gather, so I would have time to set up and ensure everything was in order. I informed someone at the bar that I had reserved the VIP lounge. She responded with a gentleman's name and I said no, while confused. She said she would check with the manager, but that she may have seen the wrong name. I waited for a couple minutes next to the VIP lounge when the manager came to speak to me. He informed me that another individual had reserved the lounge and that the information showed that I reserved a dining area on the left side of the bar. I urged that there must have been a mistake because I specifically asked for the VIP lounge and I was told that it was available when I paid last month. He explained that what I described was impossible since the lounge had been reserved months in advance. WTF. I lost it. 

The next few lines are everything I, angrily, told the manager. I could not believe that someone was idiotic enough to provide me terrible information and created a false reservation. I'm certain that someone, if not that person, discovered the error along the way and didn't even think of contacting me about the change! If I knew I was reserving a dining area, I would never have been okay with making a deposit AND more importantly, if their lounge wasn't available, I would have gone somewhere else. It was extremely inconsiderate, especially knowing the importance of the event we were celebrating. I was devastated. I had this beautiful party planned and Ruben had absolutely no idea what was going on. His closest friends had already started arriving while this was happening and it was almost time for the party, so finding another location was not an option. Of course, all I wanted to do was leave. Nothing could undo what had been done. I was infuriated.

As horrible as the evening began, everyone was extremely accommodating and kind. The manager happily refunded my $40 deposit when I requested it and when I finally decided to stay, he said that they would take care of us - they ended up comping one of our H/H pizzas ($10) on our $28 bill. He was also apologetic and our server was really attentive. Therefore, I commend these individuals for trying to salvage the night.

This is definitely my new grub spot after a long night at Town Square.

And it looks like a good place to watch sports too in the daytime. Plenty of flatscreens around the bar area.",6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg,1,1,4,uiQpMjMPuyiQhbOCFjoNPQ

I see so much sleeze here in town, it would be nice to have just an ounce of class in a local's bar! This particular SG location is one of my favorites because it is so freaking well located.

Always a huge fan of the pretzel bites! Incredibly disappointed last night with the Golden Chicken tenders. We ordered the bucket of 16 for $26 since it was a better deal than the 4 Piece for $12. Way more crunchy bread than chicken. It hurt our teeth to eat more than 2 tenders each! When I flagged down the waitress to ask why they were so crunchy, she said she was new and would ask if it was a new recipe. And of course never came back until we flagged her down for the check.  We left incredibly disappointed and hungry. What a waste of $51! Could have gone to so many better restaurants for that price.

5339880,2013-04-22,1,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"Sierra Gold gets a big fat 4 out 5 for their happy hour, the atmosphere, the decor, and the service.

I think the whole Nevada tavern concept is a true testament to Las Vegas locals and the home-y neighborhood that is this city.

Sierra Gold is right down the street from my house so I frequent this location quite a bit. I've had 2 different company parties here, and several department-wide happy hours as well.

FOR LARGE PARTIES, this place is quite accommodating. The large ""living room"" was perfect for space for events with 10-20 people. We reserved the space for a department Holiday party in under 3 weeks notice for a $20 fee. The space was perfect for the par-tay peeps under 30 years old and had just enough elegance to make our VP comfortable with his cufflinks and cognac.

SG's menu is quite extensive. Plus their monthly specials are always worth a try. 50% off pizza and drinks for happy hour 7 days a week is probably worth all 5 stars.... On days when I need to eat my feelings, I have to order a buffalo chicken pizza (aka Chicken ranch) and..... the GILROY!!! I am sad they eliminated their size variety and only offer what most would consider a large - but the gilroy tastes just as good as leftovers (not the Buffalo one though - not good reheated).

More times than not, SG & their sister PT's have half off breakfast specials,,,, This used to be a big win for my husband and myself because we were\are huge fans of their breakfast pizza...but they reformulated the menu about a year or so back and it's just not as great - it's good still but not as great. Darn. R.I.P old SG breakfast pizza.

I have a friend that gripes about the bartenders and their ""uniforms"" or as she calls it ""boobtenders"".... lol.. but I mean, really?! it doesn't bother me - to be honest - I've lived in this town for 10+ years... I see more cleavage at Smith's.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,1,1,4,MNv6crUqhAN95WRk6guK7A

Shots are cheap during late nights. 

Beers are pretty cheap all year around. I usually get a blue moon and that's about $5 for a 16oz. Or $5 for a giant miller lite during football games.

Food is decent. Nothing horribad. Nothing astonishingly great. They have a happy hour menu and a football happy hour menu. 

What I do love is that it's not crowded as heck during football games and finding a seat is not like finding a needle in a haystack. My boyfriend and I were there this past Sunday for the afternoon game and it was really easy to find a table with a TV right in front of us. Speaking of TVs, they have plenty. They have different games on different TVs so it's not a team specific bar. However, I do believe Niner Nation is here. They rent out a certain area of the bar and that's where they usually are for the Niner games. It's all good -- I'm all in for the Niners as well. 

The only downside to it is that the service is super slow. There is usually only 1-2 waitresses for the whole sitting area. They take a while to get your orders down but the food is generally really quick to come out...probably because the food isn't brought to you by the waitress. 

Overall, it's a pretty nice bar. It would definitely be the place to go for me to watch some football games. Also, get their rewards/players card. You get $5 credit the day you sign up so $5 off your orders yay!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,5,3,3,bLsiJqIde_NWPPhKugeNBQ

It was seat yourself and the first thing I noticed was that the place smelled like cigarettes, not uncommon for Vegas but a pet peeve of mine in an eating establishment.

Our waitress greeted us fairly quickly but only brought 5 menus for 6 people. We got our drinks right away and she did a good job at keeping them full. The food took what seemed like a long time, especially considering that they only had a couple other patrons. I ordered the Cobb Salad as did the gal to my right. We were the first to get our food but they failed to bring us any salad dressing. We waited for others to get their food and the next 3 dished all came out together. The final dish (a bbq chicken salad) didn't come out at all. We finally had to flag down our server because the one salad was missing and 2 were still missing their dressing.

The food was good but not great. I liked the shredded romaine lettuce for my Cobb Salad, vs. the usual iceberg. A girl in our party had the Fajita Wrap and said it was just meh... but another scarfed down his French Dip, and the guy who only ordered the soft pretzel didn't leave anything behind either.

As with many places when it came time to get the check it seemed to take longer than necessary. I honestly was just surprised at the slow service over all because of the lack of people there - there seemed to be plenty of staff.

I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again if I'm not in a hurry. But it won't be a place I'll ever recommend.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,1,1,3,Ykvi4_EmVQzoWno0uh4jFg

Typically this is the place to get a reasonably priced breakfast without having to go inside a casino, but today is making me reconsider that endorsement. 
While we tend to come around nine, today we arrived before 8 and that will never happen again. Our food took over 30 minutes to arrive and when it did it was lukewarm and incorrect. The manager on duty didn't seem to be too concerned that the table that sat down after us got their food before us and had almost finished eating before she could tell us they were almost done cooking our food. I have a food allergy and need everything cooked in a pan with butter than on the grill but usually this does not add to wait time - today this was the reason it took so long according to the manager.
They did correct the incorrect dish (home fries ordered crispy and came out barely cooked) but did so by taking off the eggs and heating up the original home fries. This took five minutes and by then they topped the hot home fries with the cold eggs. The manager stated three times she would bring more decaf coffee but never did - thankfully another waitress did. To top it off the corrected dish had an additional garnish of a strand of hair. 
The attitude of the manager on duty only made this visit worse. She should focus on bartending because her managerial skills lack empathy and concern for the upset guest.",jzKVoD_YU38NlMsHH74Vdw,1,0,1,SdcmKZqPQc39xRpHS8pQQg

There are two happy hour times, 5-7pm and 12-2am, which includes half off drinks, half off pizzas, and $5 certain appetizers. The food is alright and good to share with friends while drinking. I'd recommend the miner's plate or pretzel bites ($5).

The venue itself is huge. Lots of room if you decide to bring a big group. Parking is ample and there are many TV screens to watch shows or games when you're here. However, there are no pool tables if that's what you're into.

There are a lot of areas to sit and the bar is pretty large.  Be wary that if you sit in front of a machine but are not playing and someone wants to play on it, you will be asked to move.  I like sitting and playing at the machine because my drinks and most likely my food ends up being free.  Although losing money gambling isn't free...

The service can be iffy.  Sometimes you have to wait a bit for someone to acknowledge you, especially if you aren't sitting at the bar.  After you've placed an order (especially if it's just food) you may not see your server again for awhile.  

The food here is ok.  Nothing to write home about.  I do think that they are trying a bit too hard.  I like the idea of the menu and what they have on it but if you can't execute it properly then what's the point?  Just do straight up bar/diner food.  Example, the fish and chips are fish, shrimp, fries (or tater tots!!!) and hush puppies with coleslaw, tartar sauce and lemon.  If you want to get fancy with it like this then the fish better not be super soggy, the shrimp not over cooked and rubbery, the coleslaw have some flavor other than cut raw cabbage, and the lemons fresh and not thin and slimy.

2. Staying in the suburbs of Vegas, getting into town at 1am and no food to be found. Anywhere.  
3. Happy hour between midnight and 4am? Half price drinks and pizza? I'm in heaven!

So on recommendation of the bartender at TGI Fridays that was closing up shop, we shot over to Sierra Gold for some much needed food after a day of traveling and layovers.  We get there and pull on the doors. Locked. GREAT now what. Wait you need to be buzzed in! Smart. The bartender informed us it was a security feature (obviously) and when you hit the buzzer to be buzzed in it automatically snaps a photo of you.

Anyways this place is GREAT.  Homer was fantastic, and made you feel like a local/regular. The food was awesome too. Together we all got, the steak, chicken tenders, buffalo wings and chicken fajita wrap.  All of which were delicious.  Homer happily sub'd out my fries for a side of mac and cheese.

They offer two sizes of beer, large and Big Gulp size. Seriously, his beer was served in the biggest mug I have ever seen. I should also mention I don't get out much, so perhaps this is a normal size mug. 

The music was a lot of 90's and early 2000's hip hop, which I very much appreciate being in my mid 30's. Those were my jams.

The bartenders are usually pretty knowledgable with their drinks and the service here, as with most places tends to vary on the staff. It sucks, but you just do what you can in that regards
Another amenity they have is a VIP room, so if you want a private place for to hang out with friends for like an event, that's totally doable but you do have to reserve it in advance. 
TL; DR I like this bar, it's not the greatest but it is good quality and I generally have a good experience while coming here and I'm rating it in the sense of its a locals bar",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,5,3,4,dwkZvOrFVwNw1gMjIBHIHA
5934555,2010-02-12,0,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"Sierra gold has been my new local bar as of recently. Located off of S. Jones and the 215, this is a HUGE establishment from the outside view. 

The interior is quite large and seats well up to 300 people or more. The bar is the centerpiece of the restaurant, which can also seat about 50 patrons. There is 2 full sized pool tables, separate restaurant seating and an upstairs private event floor with a full bar. Sierra gold is a part of the gold group (pts pub, pts gold) so the food selections are very similar. In that regard, this is more of an upscale PT's, the food is a lot better. I haven't tried much of their food aside from happy hour offerings of pizzas and appetizers, but those are above average, good for the happy hour price. Draft selection of beer is big as well with about 25 different beers on draft, along with many more bottled. Cocktails are good, bartenders are knowledgeable and will gladly make any drink for you. 

Atmosphere is great, this place is often packed most nights and it's hard to grab a bar seat so arrive fairly early.",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,1,1,4,h_-NtLLT1wSYQvwdTrotUA
5954968,2015-01-30,0,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,"I have come to this location on 2 different occasions. The first time we had gone on a Friday night. Great service and food was good. Very nice place for drinks and socializing. However my recent experience was lousy. I recommended this bar to a close friend since I live down the street. We went in and the experience there was quite disappointing. We stopped in on a Wednesday night around 11p. It took about 5 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us due to the fact she was on her CELL PHONE. A server noticed us and got the bartenders attention so we could finally get some service. We ordered a round of drinks and the again were quickly forgotten. The place was practically empty at that time so there was no excuse. Finally another set of bartenders came in and got us another round. I asked for a menu so we could order some food but as soon as I ordered an appetizer the bartender quickly took the menu, guess we were not going to order entrees? The bar slowly started to fill up so we were really forgotten. We wanted to order another round and sat there for about 10 minutes with empty drinks and no attention so I had to wave down the bartender and pay my tab. We went to another bar. I will say maybe this time was a downer but hopefully next time we stop in wont we as disappointing. All in all drinks and food is good but this place is really lacking in the hospitality and service.",2P2ZDqB_jKu8-7iTj_PHfA,0,0,2,3qdY34_GB6lHDUuiru1fAg

The service is always SLOW, yet I always seem to come back for more, lol. I just can't resist the bar food and cheap drinks.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,2,3,HNmKoFcG2r97gBtTBjNnFQ
5989705,2018-03-04,0,aNe8ofTYrealxqv7VtFTuw,I've been in twice after CrossFit workouts with my CrossFit family and I must say that the service has been excellent both times. It took them a little longer than expected to get my quesadilla ready last night but Gabi and Makenzie were great servers. My only complaint and it really isn't a complaint was the $7 I paid for the tall Shock Top. Both of my experiences there have been superb so far and I would recommend it to a friend.,Ee7DchX4XXDIC-5AR_ypTQ,0,0,4,L92pJqevnMyCI5pyLF2zUQ
