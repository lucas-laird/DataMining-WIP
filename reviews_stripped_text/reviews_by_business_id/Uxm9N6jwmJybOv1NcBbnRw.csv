Had the shrimp ceviche, surf and turf roll, king crab roll, pork belly, bass skewer, and the salmon collar. The shrimp ceviche was horrible. The shrimps texture was rubbery. I tried to eat it...I really did, but it had no flavor. The surf and turf and king crab rolls weren't very much better. Rice was dry and fell apart. The pork belly had a good flavor, but the meat was over cooked, so it was dry. The bass skewer was quite tasty. It had a citrus miso glaze that was good. The best part was the salmon collar. It was cooked perfect. The flavor was slightly salty but sweet.

The kimono roll was a very close second, as the combo of he spicy tuna and nice crunch added to a change in pace of texture from the sekushi roll that led for a debate of which was our favorite.  Again, the cuts of fish were very fresh.

We tried two pieces of the Otoro, $15 each, but worth it with all its melt in your mouth goodness.

Let me start by saying The service was fantastic! When your drink would get low, they were on top of making sure to refill it. Everyone worked well together to make sure customers were treated great! 

The food...YUM! Let's see in total during both trips we ordered the following:
Miso Soup: probably the best miso soup I've had! We ordered seconds on this. So fresh, delicious and perfect start to a perfect meal! 

King Cali roll & shrimp roll: didn't love the Cali roll but the shrimp roll didn't stand a chance! FYI they are super tiny rolls, so use this as an appetizer. 

Beef bulgogi bento box: very very good! Well cooked beef slices, with large amounts! Flavor on point! Bento box comes with soup, salad, chicken egg roll and rice. I enjoyed this way too much! 

Salmon bento box: Salmon had great flavor and was cooked well. My mom loved it! 

Ebi don bowl: this is a rice bowl, with an over easy (extremely easy) egg, onions and shoyu sauce with 2 fried shrimp. I came on a Friday and couldn't eat meat, so I got this. Looking at it, I was disgusted because of the runny egg, but I mixed it up and gave it a try...and glad I did because I loved it. Had a perfect sweet flavor because of the sauce, extremely good and worth it! Just wish it had more shrimp. 

Gyoza: the sauce made these soooo amazing! I let them soak up the juice before eating them and I still crave the wonderful flavor!",kGWMfDKOw8CVmO2nQh8CIg,0,1,5,9yokIv3CkI7F4PzqOq_OIg
1362420,2017-04-22,2,Uxm9N6jwmJybOv1NcBbnRw,"2.11.16: I was really craving for ramen thinking that they will have it here. Well they do have it but not at the time that we came. They have a late night that is different from their regular menu starting at 10pm. I was too lazy to go elsewhere so we stayed. 

Located in Paris Hotel we sat near the front entrance. It was pretty quiet at 11pm. I guess everyone is out and about clubbing while I'm just hungry. I wanted something not too greasy so I opt to order their Rainbow Roll called Sekushi Rainbow. In this roll it's actually real crab, came with alaskan crab, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail as the protein. I order fresh wasabi on the side. To my surprise it didn't look like fresh wasabi. As wasbi is a root and if grated it would look like garlic consistency more than what we got. Maybe they mix it with other stuff? It was different and good. 

It's hard to say I'm a fan here as I only ate one dish. For $22 I think it's priced pretty high for a roll. I rather have imitation crab meat lol.

For the main course I ordered the vegetarian noodles, and they were okay. Probably not something I would order again. However my partner ordered the ginger chicken and I ate half of his plate. That is definitely something you would want to order if you're there.

Not as over-priced as other sushi restaurants on the LV Strip, Sekushi does a pretty good job. Nigiri sushi is priced by the piece ($5-$8 depending on the fish), instead of by the pair as in normal sushi establishments, and as a result you end up paying 2x for your nigiri. Rolls are $15+, and are ""slimmer"" than normal.

Fish quality is as one would expect in LV:  not straight from Tsukiji in Tokyo, but not spoiled either.

Service is friendly and efficient for the most part.  Although the waitress did forget to put in the order for one of our rolls, she remedied the situation quickly.

One drawback is there is only a limited selection of premium sakes and a few types of beer.

Locals would surely know of better sushi destinations in LV, but for visitors with a sushi craving Sekushi fits the bill.",RhUQ1Vz3-bDMLbIGlcyzfA,0,0,4,BNvlGXUmYQq6_rZrvTvWnA

We had an early dinner here and were seated at the sushi bar. You receive complimentary edamame with your meal. They have a large variety of sushi as well as small and large plates. We both ordered bento boxes, salmon for me and bulgogi for my boyfriend. He also ordered kirin draft beer and said it was good. The bento boxes include your choice of meat (they also have teriyaki chicken and panko shrimp), salad with peanut dressing, a chicken egg roll, and white rice. You also receive miso soup as an appetizer. The soup was really good but the SALMON was the star. It was perfectly crispy on the outside with the skin on and the salmon itself was so fresh! It reminded me of what my mom makes for me at home. I sampled my boyfriend's bulgogi and it was also yummy. We also ordered pork gyoza and those were good as well. The egg roll and salad were just okay. For dessert we shared the mango and red bean mochi and they were a sweet and refreshing ending to our meal. In short, the food and service were very good!

Food - 3 1/3 starts

The place is located inside the Paris hotel, so obviously, price is much higher than the already expensive Japanese cruisine which ranges higher about 30 - 50%.  

Umi shooter - $8
Oyster shooter - $7
Sashim - 12 pieces - $39
Aria  roll - $18
Rainbow roll - $18
Hamachi Kama - $18
Hot sake - $15
Hot tea -$4.5

Is it worth it?  Let's just say, its the experience.  The presentation of the sashim was nice.  Fish were thinly sliced with two pieces that were questionable whether they were the natural color of the fish or whether they were turning into different stages.  Not daring to try.

 The aria roll was nicely rolled up in a skinny roll. The texture of the rice is mixed well, the filling is made with real fresh crab meat with maybe lightly salted, as you can taste the freshness of the crab meat.  Topping was salmon cerviche with a creamy sriracha aioli that added the heat to the roll along with the sesame coating on the outside of the roll.  That was my favorite dish. The fish and shrimp on the rainbow roll again thinly strategically placed on the roll perfectly fresh.  The shooters were interesting shots with heavy sake, soy sauce, raw quail egg, and chopped green onion.  Need to chute it down as fast as you can . Hamachi Kama is ok, it would have been better if it has more grilled mark that brings out the chard taste.  Again, it's all about the experience.",2xvjDtub65S5HnK-9sYVvA,3,6,4,eEbKOaACAJSyDWae5XjQoA

Two weeks ago, as we were walking from the casino side; we decided to stop by for lunch.  All we saw was the bar and sat down.  I found it weird that we sat there for 10 minutes and the two guys behind the bar kept looking at us but wouldn't talk.  I wasn't sure if they speak English so decided to go look for a waitress.  As I got up, a lady approached me to tell me that unless I see a hostess, no one will be helping me.  Mind you, you can't see a hostess when you're coming from the casino floor.  I told her that I never saw a hostess, she told me 'good luck getting service'.  Really?  The restaurant was empty and this is how you treat a person?

I was so irritated that I came back after I ate elsewhere to speak to the manager.  The same girl says that the manager isn't in and that I have no reason to complain.  This was so rude!

I took a business card to call in the complaint.  Called couple of times and got hung up on when I asked for the manager.  I didn't raise my voice or tell them that it was regarding a complaint.

This place is located inside of the Paris Hotel and Casino. That should have been my first clue. It's literally located on the side of this wanna be alley way mimicking Paris streets. Huh....

The inside was not appealing at all. Very tiny. Small little booths with a center sushi bar. The walls were covered in some weird graffiti type of art. The vibe here is not a sexy one. Very casual and unromantic. 

Service was pretty good. Food came out fast. Very attentive.

As for the food - We ordered pretty much everything they had to offer:


Edamame - Way too salty!

Seaweed salad - tiny portion....

Sliders - Not bad...needed to add ketchup because it was very bland. 

Steak in a Bao bun - This was delicious!! Pretty much Bulgogi Beef in a Bao bun. Soooo good!!

Yellowtail Taco - Way too much Spicy Mayo!! 

6 different speciality sushi rolls - All of them were pretty good. But very tiny rolls, and each cost around $25 a roll. Way too expensive for what you got.

Creamy Udon Seafood Soup - This was really good. Tasted like mac and cheese. 

Overall - this place was way too expensive for lack luster ambiance and small portioned food. There are way better places out there.",HSMzwZ3FbuQ1aLECOv8FtQ,4,0,3,SmxyMMdm--g44vZCi4ZVNA

On the downside, the grilled butter scallops was overcooked and a bit tough. The sashimi sampler was average, the presentation was beautiful, but the fish themselves were hit or miss, i.e. loved the mackerel but disliked the snapper.

My aunties decided to dine in at Sekushi since they were staying at Paris Hotel & invited us to join them along with a few other people that I've never met before.

Unfortunately, since it was already late and I didn't want my daughter to ruin everyone's meal, I opted to just stay in my room.  My aunties felt bad because they said that the sashimi was really good and they wanted to get me something so I asked for the sashimi salad.

My auntie brought my order to my room around 10:15 PM & I ate the whole thing in less than 2 minutes.  Maybe it was due to the small portions, but also the fact that the fish was super fresh and their salad dressing was so good made me want to go downstairs for another order.

If I ever decide to stay on The Strip, I'll be sure to stay at Paris since my aunties's room was much nicer than my room at Bally's--just so I can come back here for their sashimi salad.",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,14,16,4,j2sOfCcvx0hI3MgtNi7Idg

I stumbled upon Sekushi, and I'm glad I did!

I asked the server what she would suggest for their signature rolls, and she said the Aria O.

Considering that I just wanted a quick meal, one roll was enough.

The Aria O has salmon, shrimp, avocado, mango, jalapeno, micro cilantro and honey truffle aioli. Since I am not a big fan of cilantro, I asked if it would be very pungent in the roll, and she assured me that it would not be overpowering the other elements of the roll. Good!

Out comes the food! Beautiful! Presentation's great!

And this roll had a bold immense flavor. It's a good thing I listened to Sandra's suggestion, she was right, the cilantro was not overpowering.
I loved the honey truffle aioli, it made the roll come together harmoniously! Ingredients were fresh, and the jalapeno was just the right amount to make it spicy but not burn your tongue.

I would definitely come back; food, price and service are great!

Im not sure how they got two dollar signs on yelp because one piece of uni was $8 before taxes... where in most places its usually about $6-$8 for two pieces. I went ahead and ordered it anyway because I love uni but as soon as I tasted it, it wasn't as good as the other places I normally go to.. you'd think for the price it would at least be comparable but it was far from it... and I dont remember seeing on the menu where they source their uni. I also ordered the Aria O - which was recommended by our original server, it's one of their more popular rolls... unfortunately, after almost waiting for two hours, it never came. The manager and our main server were very nice and kept on apologizing about the mishap - where half of our orders never came out even after almost two hours of waiting. 
Me and my friends were hungry, upset and to add insult to injury - one of their male servers that handed us the tuna tartare gave us attitude. Im not sure if he was having a bad day or maybe he thought we were just a bunch of complainers but he should've seen/ known that his manager is already trying to do service recovery and he just made the whole experience from bad to worse after almost slamming that bowl of tuna tartare on our table and giving us so much attitude - we were a group of 6 girls and everyone saw and felt the attitude he gave us. 
The manager ended up not charging us for the food that 3 of my friends got and offered to take care of us if we came back but most of us were traumatized with the experience and just opted out.",BC_IQwXUzAHHCBRRaI253w,1,0,1,l10M-DNxRMHjjwtAM2fDuA

We are a huge sushi family so we know what to order and what good sushi tastes like.  Our servers were terrific but that is where it all ended.  The edamame they brought us before dinner was very sad looking. I also ordered a glass of Merlot and was brought out a tiny, tiny glass of very mediocre wine.  I figured for the price I paid it should have been much better.  My family ordered sushimi and got one small piece of fish for $12.  I decided to try something different and ordered the wagyu beef and the seared foie gras.  They were absolutely the smallest dishes I have ever been served in my life.  The wagyu was around $15 and only 3 tiny strips of meat.  I had to fold them over just to get a taste of the meat. The foie gras was $36 and 4 tiny slices probably the size of a penny. I was starving and broke by the time I left the restaurant. Would have rather gone to the Dim Sum place next door.  At least I would have been full when I left.

3737362,2017-08-24,0,Uxm9N6jwmJybOv1NcBbnRw,"Sekushi is by far one of the absolute best Sushi restaurants I have eaten at. I am giving this wonderful place a 5 star rating for the reasons listed as follows. 

1. Ambiance. When you walk into Sekushi, you know immediately that you are in a well managed establishment and will receive only the best treatment. You are welcomed in by all members of the Sekushi team, seated in an area that best suits your personal needs, and the atmosphere around you can only be described as aesthetic. The restaurant is well lit, and far from dull as it is decorated with everything from neon lights to retro Japanese movie posters and kawaii anime eyes. Overall, a very trendy dining experience for people of any age. 

2. Staff. The people are enthusiastic about what they do here. Not only do they greet you, but they say farewell and thank you on your way out. They staff is quick to deliver the food as well as make it, yet the food and service do not seemed rushed in the slightest. Every server seems to be well polished in their profession as they are light on their toes, friendly, bubbly and well mannered. The bussers are quick to clean the place up as well as they are kind to offer cleaning up anything that may be of hindrance on your table. The chefs are skilled in their stations as well, always ensuring that the food is well prepared and that their station is always sanitary. 

3. The food. Everything in this establishment is extremely well prepared, and let me just say that you get what you pay for. My first time ever eating uni I tried here. The color was just as it is supposed to be; a bright light orange. In comparison to the other restaurant I ate it at afterwards, I was astounded to discover that this other place had given me the worst tasting food I had ever eaten in my life. After eating at Sekushi I  have learned what good sushi is supposed to taste like. The fish is fresh and colorful, the food is far from bland, and is a symphony for the taste buds. Everything from the appetizers, to the entrees, rolls, deserts and alcoholic beverages are up to par,  delectable and full of flavor. 

Oh, and one more thing, Nevada locals park for free inside the Paris parking garage, which is a huge added bonus. No worrying about rushing your food down to get that cheaper parking ticket. :)",OlcwzdpXMDIKS46YbvubmQ,2,0,5,_BDUugow-daL_SajJGc3-w

We came on a busy Saturday night and the waiter, waitress and the hostess were so nice. We said we'd wait for the bar seating and they said they had a table open for us if we wanted to sit right away. So sweet. We waited for about 20 minutes then we were promptly seated but during those 20 minutes the waiter, waitress and the hostess asked if we still wanted the table. Again, so sweet of them for checking in on us and seeing if we changed our minds. 

We ordered the Waygu beef tataki and boy was it flavorful. I liked having the lava salt on it. The Creamy seafood udon was extra creamy. Reminded me of seafood pasta in Alfredo sauce. The Aria O roll was delicious. I love the crunch on the outside of the roll. My boyfriend ordered the chef's choice sushi and the fresh wasabi. It was a generous portion for an extra $3.

I ordered the Japanese miso ramen ($18) and my friend ordered the Chirashi don ($22). We were given edamame to start off. The ramen broth was on the bland side and it didn't have that nice rich miso broth. I eat a lot of ramen in the Bay Area and had the best ramen in Japan, so you can say I'm a ramen snob. There were a few slices of chashu and half an egg, topped with bean sprouts and two pieces of seaweed. It was a decent size bowl size of ramen but the flavor just wasn't there.

The Chirashi don was a piece of art! There was a variety of raw fish on the bed of rice. The rice was a bit dry but the fish was fresh.

3985709,2017-01-21,0,Uxm9N6jwmJybOv1NcBbnRw,"First sushi restaurant I've been to in Vegas and was left wanting more. Without coming off as too pretentious here, both my fiance and I spent over a decade combined working in restaurants so we understand the workings of the service industry. We get that sometimes servers are overwhelmed or in the weeds with too many tables, etc... I felt that our server had plenty of time to talk with the fellow co-workers but never once checked on our table once the food was dropped off. This means that by the time she finally did come back and dropped the bill off we hadn't received two of the items we ordered. Unfortunately we never had time to communicate this with her prior to the bill arriving because she never stopped back. Of course once this was addressed they were then taken off our bill but no additional service recovery was taken. I'm not asking for hand outs, but if you forget not only 1 but 2 of the menu items a table has ordered you should probably make an effort to do something to prevent a review like this from happening. All of this being said, the fish was fantastic, albeit slightly overpriced but what isn't in Vegas. We were very pleased with our food but the service, or lack thereof, will drive people away from this place. The only thing saving this from being a 1 star review was the Uni sushi. Some of the best I've ever had and I'm a huge sucker for Uni",wvMF9UN8BTPSYYo6gR109Q,0,0,2,KRJOPjX6M-idtlIiT_pTkg

I ordered:
creamy seafood udon - not bad, udon wasn't over cooked and the broth wasn't over seasoned, perfect balance and combination of the creaminess of the soup and seafood.
Nigiri -
  wagyu beef; nothing special, it is sweet, tasty and soft
  foie gras; very tasty and velvety, must try
  saba; love the fishiness, doesn't have a weird after taste, one of my fave
  hamachi; I didn't care for it, just like the wagyu beef, nothing special, it wasn't melt in my mouth but it definitely did not taste fishy. 
  hotate; nothing special about it either, it was sweet and tasty. didn't taste fishy at all.
aria o roll - the rice was waaaaaaaaaay too mushy, maybe it was just that day, not sure. flavor profile was not bad, it was a nice combo of flavors (i love avocado), ordered this roll since it had the least amount of sauce, I don't like rolls in general.

Service wasn't bad, the servers were attentive and friendly. The food was just not mind blowing though but I don't mind coming back for the other stuff on the menu.",hLKHKWUBshRP1hDdly1tvQ,0,0,3,FdftiS39kvVu8lDcs110Hw

It does Not taste what what it is worthy based on the location as well as the price. I understand the portion may be varied...

Imaging you can taste raw salts in the sushi rolls. The rice is cheap ones, certainly not the authentic Japanese rice. Shrimp tempura is the typical low-end deep fry style. It was not even well done and worse than Safeway sushi!

4793565,2017-08-04,1,Uxm9N6jwmJybOv1NcBbnRw,"My boyfriend and I came here to get our sushi fix for our Vegas trip and we were unfortunately extremely disappointed. We ourselves work at a pretty well known sushi place in LA and for a sushi restaurant in Vegas with such high pricing and mediocre sushi, we had high hopes. 

To be honest, the good probably outweighs the bad, but for a place that sells sushi, it leaned more toward bad for me. I'll start with the bad and end with the good.

CONS:
If you want SUSHI, and I mean NIGIRI, do NOT come here. It would be a waste of a penny. It costs $5+ for just ONE piece where at most other sushi places, they charge you that much for 2 pieces.

Sushi had no presentation what-so-ever. No toppings. No options for toppings. Halibut was extremely plain without lemon and salt or ponzu or something. I received a scallop that was falling apart halfway.

Half the waiters looked like they were just there without really knowing the menu or really offering service. They took your order once and bye. They won't even pick up your plates without you asking them too. Really poor at sushi bar. Out of 4 waiters, 1 was attentive enough. Sorry I don't remember the name.

PROS:
If you want satisfying ROLLS, give this place a shot. Their signature rolls were up to par and decently priced for being based in Vegas. I tried the Sakura roll and it was saucy and tasty all over. 
(We also tried to Negitoro Cut Roll and it was average.)

Come here for the small plates and the cooked food. Judging from the menu, this place really likes its Wagyu, so plenty of Wagyu items here. Not easy on the wallet though.
- Gyoza - was tasty and tasted how gyoza should taste. You can probably skip it though.
- Sirloin Steak Steamed Bun - DELICIOUS. No more words for this but that.
- Wagyu Sliders - Good but not all that.

Complimentary edamame when you start. Not bad.

Overall, this place is worth a shot but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. I'd rather go to Katsuya or try another sushi place out. But if you're looking for some rolls or tapas, make your way here. Sushi? Nah.",o7EzdeZc94zAYTHUwF-x-w,0,0,3,mVNOZtvetiUJgBjO8jOtFg

Started off with the hot sake which was pretty good sake for the price. Nice and smooth. Got the complimentary edamame and went with the safe gyoza appetizer and satisfying till that point. The uni scallop nigi was ok but not as great as i hoped. Ceviche taco again nothing mind blowing. Then our entrees came and went all down hill. My girlfriends chirashi don is cover with thinly sliced sashimi that looks nothing like their pictures i saw on yelp.

Located at Paris Hotel, Sekushi is an adorable Japanese sushi bar. Too bad the food wasn't good.

Chirashi don ($22.00): my sashimi had 3 little bones. Not one. Not two. Three tiny bones! I found the first bone inside my sashimi and showed it to my waitress. One minute later I found another one. The slices were very stringy too. 
Salmon bento ($19.00): better than my chirashi don. It's sad when you get better cooked food than raw fish at a sushi bar. 

FREE CHEESECAKE OR DEVILS PIE WITH YELP CHECK-IN.

5346925,2016-12-16,0,Uxm9N6jwmJybOv1NcBbnRw,"This was my least favorite Japanese restaurant ever. My husband is half Japanese and we live in Orange County and visit Diamond Bar often so we have a very good selection of Asian restaurants nearby.

We were seated quickly, the restaurant was not busy, but once we were seated a few groups walked in after us, and the server went to these groups first before checking with us. They don't seem to be assigned to tables so we were forgotten for several minutes, and about a minute away from walking out before the server came by.

We ordered a bento each and the tempura green beans. She brought us our waters and some Edamame a few minutes later, then the fun started.

I watched the tables adjacent to where we were sitting be brought dishes and the runner ask both tables if they ordered the thing he was holding. This didn't just happen once, it happened 4 times. 

My bento was brought out before the starter, then after several minutes where we were sure they had forgotten we'd order it the starter showed up, and then a few more minutes for my husband's bento to be delivered to the wrong table before finding its way to him. By this point, my salmon was cold. The Miso soup that comes with the bento was served when my husband's bento arrived because they had to make it, and that was probably the best thing we were served. He also didn't receive his roll when the bento was delivered, that came another several minutes later.

The rolls included were very small, I'd assumed they were half but these were tiny compared to a normal piece from a roll, and the entire place is over priced. Don't order the green beans, they were very soft and needed at least a little salt. At $19 per bento, and considering they charge $20 and up per roll, this place could not be more overpriced for mediocre food and service. 

Some of these issues I could understand if the restaurant has been busy when we came in, but it was not. To the point where several of the workers were standing by the bar while we were waiting for any one of them to just bring us water.

I don't think I've ever been to a place that was this bad at just getting the food to the right table. Don't come here, there are better places eat inside Paris.",2cj8jOS2OpEs3zyTl4cAIg,5,0,2,UdVLJSwaLy2eQWGGb0F1ow

If you're a sake fan I suggest you try a bottle of the Lychee Sake. For $23 it is worth the price and goes down a little too well! For food I ordered the Pork Gyoza, the Wagyu Beef Bun (so tasty and tender), the Yellowtail Ceviche Wonton Taco (super fresh!) plus the Spicy Tuna Hand cut rolls and the Salmon and Avocado Rolls.

We were planning on buffet for dinner, so we ordered 2 rolls here to try: Spicy Tuna cut roll ($9) and Sakura Roll ($24). First impressions, rolls were very small, more like 1/2 size bites or maki rolls. The Spicy Tuna cut roll was not what I expected: chopped up tuna with spicy mayo ON TOP of each piece. The Sakura Roll was very salty, without any soy sauce, which masked the flavors of tuna and whatever else was inside.

The table seating is very underwhelming, doesn't feel like you're in Vegas at all. Try sitting at the sushi bar instead for hopefully better ambiance.

Unfortunately, we will not be coming back for the sushi. I can imagine the bill to grow quite fast if you want to leave feeling full. Almost $50 for a snack and drink before dinner is quite scary even by Vegas standards

My boyfriend and I tried their Sekushi Rainbow rolls which has Alaskan King crab, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, cucumber, avocado and wasabi tobiko ($22). 

Next we ate the Surf and Turf rolls ($26) with seared wagyu beef, panko shrimp, avocado, black lava salt and truffle oil. The beef was warm and so yummy!

We finished off our meal with the Kimono rolls ($19) with spicy tuna, panko shrimp, avocado, crispy onion, and balsamic sesame. I enjoyed the crispness of the onion and panko shrimp inside the rolls.

All of these rolls were colorful, fresh, tasty and very easy to eat. The ratio of rice versus filling was perfect. The mix of different flavors and textures were amazing! These rolls looked as good as they tasted!

Overall, I found the rolls a bit pricey but I did recognize that these were high quality sushi rolls. They were refreshingly different! I definitely recommend this place!",mdOX-9te4ZFFnuDOEKbyZw,1,0,4,3zDE40138fQkzZJsp67iXA

5837785,2017-07-31,0,Uxm9N6jwmJybOv1NcBbnRw,"Sekushi was a really fun sushi joint inside the Paris hotel. I absolutley loved the decor and music choice - it felt more like a club or a local joint, than a restaurant inside a casino.

We made reservations for 730 and enjoyed a variety of food. I ordered:
- Pork Gyoza: delicious! and beautifully presented with a flower
- Salmon Nigiri: incredible, fresh and delicious. The salmon was so tender it melted in my mouth
- Kimono Roll (spicy tuna, panko shrimp, avocado, cucumber, balsamic sesame and crispy onion straw) - I didnt really enjoy this roll. The crispy onion on top was almost like hard oatmeal flakes? - it tasted flavorless and was TOO crunchy - to the point of being annoying/painful. It completely brought down the meal for me.

My friend ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box. I had her Miso Soup and some of the fried rice - tasty staples.

I also used the Yelp Check-In offer for the free Cheescake or Devil's Pie -- but recieved Mango Mochi instead (they were out of the other two options). Yum! Cool and refreshing.

Also, I'd rank this as more of a $$$ than a  $$ establishment, as most of the options are $10-20 EACH. And unless you only have one sushi roll or two pieces (pieces, not orders), your tab is going to be higher. My final bill was $52.

I don't know that given all of the other Sushi options in Vegas, that I would return, but I can't say I had a bad experience, so I will give this 4 stars.",yXQnRMJJXvo9UEcK8U856w,0,1,4,CyrR_SzZDqPj0yg_LF37JA

The Surf and Turf is better with the wagyu eaten separately. You can't really taste the wagyu when it's eaten with the roll. 

The 12 piece sashimi wasn't bad. The cuts were very thick and pretty fresh.",e7IND3x69BGd0JfzGecSEw,1,0,4,fFJKmd3N4VNvrCYuTSdAiA

We ordered an eel avocado roll, salmon avocado roll, beef bento box, and the Chilean sea bass app. I did not like how they do not offer brown rice, I find that a little odd. The main reason I am taking the 2 stars off is for the incredibly slow service. My Chilean sea bass came out about 25 minutes after my parents food. I was not happy. But the fish was absolutely delicious and I would order it again if I ever return. The sushi I tasted was just average, nothing special.",InGWV3NxeEjjtvy8uY_aVw,0,0,3,jkgv8BREGYkjFnbMtNLzxQ

We were greeted with complementary edamme . I ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box, my husband ordered 3 sushi rolls, spicy tuna, scallop, and tuna. 

We did not specify but assumed everything would come out together but the sushi was brought out one roll at a time all before my bento box. My miso soup came out before the rest of the bento box.

My husband enjoyed the sushi. My bento box was good. It included miso soup, a chicken egg roll, a nice sized piece of salmon, steamed white rice, and a mixed green salad. It was the perfect amount of food for lunch. Our bill was 55 dollars before tip.",WkJ5k4BMCetP1pBRLoitHw,0,0,3,zQ5P_2WHnvH0ccfgX7hRDQ

I wish had more to eat but was satisfied with all the sashimi we ordered. The fish was really fresh and tasted great. The miso soup was a little bland and watery. But the salmon and yellowtail in particular were my favorite. 

Service was fast and efficient. Our sashimi and rolls came out like 15 minutes later. It's very convenient as a to-go or quick stop kind of place. The restaurant is quite small. Not really meant for romantic dates.",fRzmU2Z9hoxBcRk3vCIKNg,0,0,4,Zfhg5YZe-Ht1crn_K4-H3w
5932056,2016-12-26,0,Uxm9N6jwmJybOv1NcBbnRw,"Decent sushi but they have a lot to work on. I just learned that it's only been open for 6 weeks, so they are clearly still working out the kinks:

The good:
-Fresh quality fish
-Oyster special totally worth it (learned about it from a family at the table next to us): 12 oysters for $24
-Friendly service 
-Quick seating; there were a couple of tables available (while some of the other restaurants in the vicinity had long wait lines)
-Interesting menu
 
The ""needs improvement""
-While service was friendly, it was very spotty and inconsistent. They cleared dishes quickly (for the most part) but some items took a very long time to arrive.
-A couple of the oysters were a little weird...they were fresh, but a few of them had some inedible portions (that were not pieces of shell).
-Chirashi was mostly rice and very little fish; not the ratio that one expects for the price.
-Again - the quality of the fish was fresh, but nothing about the food screamed extraordinary.

It's Vegas. Gotta raise your game if you're going to survive.",Y1zlQuRT31BH-p38U59ZVw,1,1,3,4JP3KNqY2uW8fbahilLU1g
