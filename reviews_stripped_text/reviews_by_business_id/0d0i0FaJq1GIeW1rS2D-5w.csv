But the extra consideration and courtesy displayed by Bruxie employee Andre McDowell is nonparallel in this type of serving situation.

Okay, never thought I'd be down to try chicken and waffles, but heh, this place makes the combo taste natural.  Kinda like cheese on a burger.  I tried the Holy Chicken and it was delicious.  The hint of maple with the sriracha really worked!  I wanted to try the Nashville Hot, but heard from colleagues it was on the spicy side.  I chickened out.  Next time I won't be so scared, I'm doing it.  

Was it a little pricey?  Maybe.  But walk in to a Panda Express on Las Vegas Blvd and your gonna pay more than you do on Mayberry Street.  Totally worth it!",ucpmwBTo-LKeBAMd0tG6dQ,0,0,4,_vN8WFZgMHsr5cqgzwJPTQ
97046,2016-09-13,0,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,Went there 3x during a 4 day stay last week. Our new go-to place for lunch and breakfast. Hubby and I split the Nashville hot chicken and waffle skillet for a late lunch. Was good. Hot but not too powerful. It was just half of a Belgian waffle and 3-4 tenders. I could've definitely ate it all myself but we didn't want too much to eat since it was late afternoon and we had dinner reservations at 7. Went for breakfast twice and had the country sausage and egg sandwich one day. Was very good. Then we went back on our last day before the airport and I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. Good size piece of chicken and very tender and moist. Prices are very reasonable for the size portions you get.

We had never heard of Bruxe Chicken and Waffles because we are from McKinney Texas, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  We lucked upon this place because a restaurant further down the strip that we wanted to try had closed early. So we were headed back to our hotel at the Excalibur, when we saw Bruxie's; that was on Wednesday June 8th. We loved it sooooooo much, that we ate here everyday, including the morning that we boarded the plane.  This place is absolutely Freaking Amazing.  Shout out to Ms. Ann Marie and Mr. Andrea for providing exceptional customer service during our many visits.  We begged Ms. Ann Marie to pass the word to the powers that be, please come to Oklahoma and Texas; there is definitely markets waiting to be tapped!!!  We need you to send Ms. Ann Marie when you do open down here.

Good price point for a quality, hot meal. Great for breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner or late night. Fun dining experience. Accommodating staff.

This is one of those restaurants where you place your order at the register, grab your flatware and condiments, and they run drinks and food to your table with one of those buzzers. If seating is limited, take your order to go and sit outside on the orange chairs. (PS: Those vibrating buzzer don't reach the orange chairs. We asked.)

Drumroll please, now for the FOOD! Hubs had the Classic Chicken and Waffle sandwich with homemade slaw on it. I had the Buffalo Blue Chicken and Waffle sandwich with a celery and carrot slaw. WE LOVED IT! The waffles were light, airy and just buttery enough without being greasy. A little thinner than a Belgian waffle and better! Chicken was seasoned nice. Great taste. Crisp and still juicy. As for the waffles fries, wished we asked for them crispy. But no big deal. Just a little soft but we were really there for the Chix & Waffs, right?

Along with it was the pickle in it which made a really big difference. A thin slice of the pickle was all it needed. This a by far the beat waffle sandwich i have had personally. I also tried my friends order which was the original. It was good as well but for my personal taste it was a bit sweet. We hinestly thought if they added a pickle it would have upped the flavor.

It was a really good place having a patio. If you wanted to stay inside and look outside you have that option.

The problem I seen was they had an employee asking customers if they have any questions about the menu. My opinion is it's mostly Chicken and Waffles so I don't think they'll  be too many questions. But that is the problem she could be helping the girls at the register because they were going pretty slow. My party ordered two meals. One was the Nashville it seemed pretty greasy at the bottom and soaked up the cardboard waffle holder. Not sure it's supposed to be like that but it wasn't very appetizing to look at. Second meal the Carolina BBQ pulled pork I liked it but the pork was cold. We liked the waffle fries. We decided to share the side Caesar salad, it's served in a paper soup cup size. That item was the worst item that we had. the salad was a little old showing rust throughout almost every piece. The parmesan cheese that was on it, was old tough to bite into and turning colors. The dressing was not bad and they don't put croutons in that salad. All in all the waffles are tasty but but they should be that's what you're going for it's just the idiosyncrasy of the other items on their menu.",zGjrjrLkCOcLTnq5nRm9uw,0,0,2,hO9hW70a8eruWPtTLXQjeg

The idea of a chicken and waffle sandwich was intriguing.  Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment.  The chicken, although piping hot, was not that flavorful or juicy. I had the Original so maybe I should have had the BBQ which sounded good.  The Waffle ""bread"" was also pretty bland and was extremely crunchy, which I thought I would like but didn't work on the sandwich.

Astrid was very polite very cordial and knowledge of the menu! 

The sodas are made with real sugar cane. The coke tasted like the Mexican coke!

We ordered chicken fingers it came with fries. The fries need to be cruncher they are blond in color. 
Also ordered bacon cheddar waffle which was horrible.
 it has sugar cane pearls large enough to not melt and I'm guessing to add extra crunch.
 This is not pleasant to eat! Also the waffle is extremely doughy. I think they're sugar pearls cause it to not bake properly leaving a very doughy and dense waffle. not my favorite.

 we also ordered the waffle chicken sandwich that was very delicious chicken is very tender juicy flavorful waffle could be slightly cruncher. it was on the blonde side, soft side. Not saying I wanted it dry and hard. But if serving with hot crunchy chicken sandwich it needs to hold.

 For dessert we ordered  waffle sundae the custard ice cream that came with it was very creamy very delicious! We ask for the regular waffle. Not the one on the menu since the sundae waffle is a Liege, all the deserts uses this kind. Liege is the crystal pearl raw sugar waffle think undercooked dense.
 they were more than happy to accommodate our order and change the waffle to the one served with the chix sandwich. It was very delicious has dark chocolate, not sweet to compliment all the other sugar in the sundae the peanuts were nice and roasted very crunchy, whipped cream was quality whipped cream.

Had the Original Fried Chicken and Waffle, Mac and Cheese, and Seasoned Waffle Fries. 

All of it was amazing. The Waffle was light and fluffy. Chicken was crispy and moist. The Mac and cheese had perfect cheese flavor. The Waffle fries amazing as the bacon really added flavor. 

All of it was so good but as you get through about half of your meal, it starts to feel too heavy and you just can't continue eating anymore. I still had the room but tapped out. This is expected with how heavy the food is but Bruxie is definitely still significantly lighter if you were to order the same stuff at other places.

We Ordered:
I ordered the Bacon, Egg & Cheddar Sandwich with Fresh Fruit & Strawberry Lemonade. The bf ordered the Original Fried Chicken & Waffle, Waffle Fries & Strawberry Lemonade

Food:
Everything is made from scratch here, and it's obvious from first bite. My breakfast sandwich was perfect in every way-- the waffle was fluffy yet crispy, the bacon flavorful and the egg cooked perfectly. I added maple syrup about half way through and was glad I did-- it accented the flavors perfectly. 

I had a bite of the bf's chicken & waffle and it was very tasty! Slightly spicy, with the perfect crunch. The chicken was tender and the waffle was delicious . 

The fruit was fresh (strawberries, bananas and pineapple) and the waffle fries were perfect. 

Drinks:
We both ordered the strawberry lemonade, and it was the perfect balance of sweet and sour. It was clearly fresh & made from real ingredients. They had ice water available for free. 

Value:
Moderately priced, great value.

Waffle with cheddar, fried chicken, bacon, and over easy egg. I told them to hold the Sriracha. They also gave a generous pour of a thin maple syrup over the whole thing. Best ever. I loved the thin crispy waffle; it was just enough so as not to overpower everything else that was going on with the meal. The chicken itself was cooked and seasoned PERFECTLY.

Located on the Strip behind Shake Shack, this little shop offers their own spin on some classic American dishes. Of course, you can look up the menu yourself and see the specifics, but I'm here to give a review! 

Be warned, this restaurant gets busy fast so be mindful of when you decide to visit. I came with a small group at around 7 p.m. and it was pretty busy. Then again, this is the Strip we're talking about so it's expected. This restaurant is self serve so the only service you receive is when you order and are given your food. My service wasn't good. The cashier that rang us up actually spent fifteen minutes talking to their friend who was ordering food in front of me. It was rude for not only me, but the customers behind us. The server that gave us our food also got our orders wrong. At least the restaurant has substantial seating space, so finding a seat shouldn't be hard especially if you're with a small group. My party and I used the tables with high chairs because it was next to a wall outlet. On a side note, thank God for restaurants that have wall outlets near the tables because when you're walking around all day on the strip, it really kills your battery. 

Back to the review, the food took a while but it was a busy day so I don't hold them against that. When we did receive our food I was pretty excited. I ordered the Chicken Poutine which was their famous waffle fries topped with their home made chicken, cheese, white gravy and chives. If you haven't had poutine before, GO GET SOME RIGHT NOW! I'm a huge fan of poutine and their version was delicious. The cheese and gravy was ooey gooey good while their fries and chicken still maintained a small crunch to it. We also ordered the Buffalo Bleu Fried Chicken & Waffles Sandwich,  the Original Fried Chicken & Waffles, and Chicken Tenders. They also offer syrup to go with the waffles and I recommend you try it. Their waffles are LEGIT. It's so soft and has a great flavor to it. The sweetness from the waffles and syrup really compliment the savory chicken. Their chicken isn't exceptional, but it still has good flavor. Really, their waffles are the star of this restaurant so you have to try it.",qDEubS2KNSJPKfb-CAG_FQ,2,0,4,7DTnwCp_JNZVzVPknkKp6Q

The waffle was perfectly made and the chicken was so well cooked with a nice fried skin on the outside with very juicy meat on the inside!

The service there was phenomenal! One of the workers refused to let me get up to get my own free refill and insisted to get it for me (note that at this place you just order at the front and they'll bring you the food so it's not exactly like a restaurant).

Took my family here (2 small kids) location wise it's Kid friendly but the menu is not that kid friendly at all. I ordered Mac and cheese for my kids and OMG it was so spicy that I could not even eat it myself. If u like spicy then order this but it doesn't go well with the bacon and flavor of the sauce. Chicken Caesar salad, looks good but taste bad. My husband said there's a fishy taste in it and it's true, dnt know why! The original
Chicken waffles was ok. Again not kid friendly, the chicken was spicy and the waffles are thin that the veggies inside it and the chicken soaked the waffles so after 3 mins not crispy soft crunchy waffles ur gonna eat but a saggy one.. The chicken taste better than the rest but it's still a little spicy and kinda sweet.. I'm not a fan of spicy food and so r my kids... The waffles the looked good on their menu pics is totally different and like I said its saggy and soaked after few minutes.. My husbands ordered the Caroline pulled pork waffles, same thing, spicy and it was messy to eat so be prepared. It was a little dry too. It didn't go very well with the thin soaked waffles again. Anyways, maybe that's their theme, spicy food but I wish I was told that when I was orderin or at least ask me what level of spiciness I want! Especially the saw my kids Coz the place was kinda empty when we got there. So they have all the time to explain their menu. And it wasn't included in their menu description as well. So there u go! Decide. I mean if u like spicy and ur kids like spicy too then go for it but then again I should be informed of what ur eating or the level
Of it before confirming the order. Their strawberry Palmer drink was also not good.. It taste plain. And  old... I drank my water in my hydroflask!! Kids didn't like it either, almost no flavoring! No wonder it's free refill!! So for 4 items plus 2 drinks  we paid 52$ including tax and tip... Is it worth it? Not really Coz my kids didn't get to eat. I ended up taking them to eat real kids Mac and cheese at CPK after ... So much better food  will I go back there on the future? Prob not..

Balsamic Reduction. The portion itself was huge and probably should have fed at least 2 people but I was hungry and ate it all.

On a recent friends trip to Vegas, our culinary needs collided beautifully - while I lust for fried chicken, they love all things waffle. In our pre-departure Yelping to find culinary delights, a friend happened upon Bruxie, where the two come together to make the ultimate brunch. We're so there!

Bruxie is a stand-alone joint on the strip (as in not connected with any of the giant hotels), so you'll have to brave Las Vegas Boulevard and the desert sunshine to reach it. Step away from the slots and tables, it's ok!  It's well worth it to support a business that hasn't been swallowed by a casino and is still a special treat away from home. 

Inside Bruxie has the typical fast casual set-up: you peruse the menu from the line, order at the register, are handed a number, and then grab your table while the food is brought to you.  While there were many tempting treats, I figured on my first visit it was best to stick with their classic offering, the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  Served up as the menu says with chili honey and cider slaw, you also have a choice of sides - I opted for the fresh fruit to keep it lighter. 

When your food arrives, you will be visually dazzled! It's a mild misnomer to call what Bruxie serves a sandwich, let's face it - this is a decadent taco, bro!  A thin but sturdy and very tasty waffle comprises the taco shell, and your chicken and slaw is generously stuffed inside, with a healthy drizzle of the honey. Syrup is also available at a condiment bar if you want to go full brunch on this bad boy. The size and the various liquids can overall make the tacowich a little difficult to eat, 2 of the 3 of us were relegated to fork n' knife it as the waffle split under duress, but no biggie! What's important here is the flavor, and this is a tasty offering. My waffle-loving friends were overjoyed by the waffle, and I was so happy the chicken was juicy and seasoned perfectly!  All the other flavor elements added balance and variety, and still let the chicken be the star, as it should be. I was also happy the side cup of fruit was standard but luckily not canned - thank you for not cheaping out on fresh produce!  

Bruxie is definitely recommended for indulgent brunchie needs at all hours, and whether you lust for waffles, fried bird, or the delightful marriage of the two, you will be happy!",ACofs6fXBVRS8GG-KDhatw,3,4,4,y4_ijGrOrOdLYFvb_p7zzA

I ordered the Nashville Hot. It might have been the sauce that comes on it but I was not a fan. The chicken didn't really have any flavors I was expecting - it was not spicy at all just very saucy. The relish sauce that came on the sandwich did not work for me. My boyfriend got the original fried chicken and waffle sandwich and mentioned that there was barely any sauce on his chicken/sandwich which was very unfortunate. We also got an order of waffle fries... which was basically 4 pieces. Not exactly worth $3.

So you walk-in and order it like a regular take-out place. You sit anywhere you'd like and your server will deliver your food to your table. So helpful and like regular dining service, they checks on us if we'd like more water (even tho self served) if we were okay (which we were) and to take our empty plates (which went full to empty real fast.)

Interior is pretty divey and hip with their brick walls and gorgeous view of the strip/terrace area. You can choose either high tops, benches, or lower shared tables.

I'm not sure where to begin but let's start with the amazing concept! Of course chicken and waffles is not a new concept but the spin Bruxie puts on its creates a whole different experience. The waffles themselves are crisp and freshly baked. Initially I wasn't sure how I would like it but they were crisp and light not crisp and stiff! It made for a great waffle sandwich. The chicken was delicious and very nicely fried. I got the original chicken and waffle combo and my date got the Nashville Hot chicken combo. The original waffle sandwich comes with a chicken breast dressed with chili honey, slaw and I added pickle. The Nashville comes with a chicken thigh dressed in a tangy sauce and slaw. Both were amazingly good! The combos come with fries which were also good. We spilt an order of fried green pickles, yes our eyes were bigger than our mouths! More than enough food and wasn't able to finish them.

Odd hour already after dinner time so there were hardly anyone there. So lucky us we got to take our time to decide what we wanted although the menu wasn't huge or anything but as a newbie we were enticed to get everything or want everything. The food coming from the side looks so good. So the concept is you order at the cashier and they bring the food to you. 

Tried the following

Nashville Style Hot Chicken & Waffle Sandwich: This was the hubbies favorite because of spice. I liked it too.

Original Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich: It was good, just original. I really like the extra flavors instead, but dang they cooked the chicken just right.

For both the Chicken was nice and crispy and tender at the same time. The Waffles were not what I expect it to be. I thought it was going to be like Roscoe's but it's not. These are different. Bread-like but crispy and thin. It taste light and not to carby. 

It was the perfect bites I have had in awhile. Not oily at all. How do they do it? Perfect just perfect. 

I want to come back and try the breakfast sandwiches and the desserts one day. Will need to come back and see if it's consistent to give it a 5 stars. YUMMY!",sLIn9oBM0aw9q2R9G1oCew,4,5,4,YrqTYUdNYF7hB4-z1TeyWw

I've tried Bruxie in Cali at Huntington Beach in the past and I feel like that experience was much better than this one

I had ordered ""The Original"" which was a fried chicken & waffle sandwich with original seasoned breast, chili honey, and cider slaw, a side of waffle cut fries, and a strawberry lemonade. 

I had recalled the sandwich I had gotten at Huntington Beach be MUCH larger. I remember getting my order and was like WOW... how am I putting this in my mouth (.... ssshhh....) but this time, I felt underwhelmed. Size of the waffle seems normal/reasonable/similar but the size/thickness of the chicken and the amount of slaw was definitely underwhelming. If anything, I'd say this was half the size of what I've experienced. Presentation was flat. Size was flat. Flavor was a bit one noted and the ""skin"" wasn't that crispy. 

Even my friend's irish nachos that's waffle cut fries w/ cheese sauce, smoked bacon, chives, sour cream looked really sad. All the noted toppings were minimal... 

I am happy I did get to try this location at least once but now I don't have to come back. It's quite a pain to come down here as a local Lol especially since everyones charging for parking nowadays.

quick tips:  maybe just get the basic waffles and basic fried chicken.

why?  the beauty of chicken and waffles is the yin/yang balance of sweet/yeasty with savory/meaty.  the hot sauces--and the buffalo sauce are true to form in their spicy/salty notes--but it's jhust too overwhelming.  in addition, the buffalo chicken version has a generous sprinkling of blue cheese.  while i appreciate the healthily big piece of chicken, it's just out of balance. there's just way too much salt in the sauce and too much cheese/hot sauce overwhelming the balance. the waffle is lost--it's just basically an overshadowed flimsy carb, instead of a delightful, equal partner.

i won't say no to going here--but i'll just stick with the basic fried chicken/waffle combo. i'm surprised that this place has such high reviews. i'd chalk this up to mostly novelty. 

also, last small note--i've read from others that the waffle fries are a big soggy. mine were acceptably not soggy.  it was interesting that my container of waffle fries was filled with tiny remnants--not a bad outcome as by volume, i had a lot more potato than if it had only been filled with full size pieces.

as usual--i felt a bit pressured to finish well within an hour to avoid paying parking fees at the NY NY garage. so i'm sorry--but minus half a star for making me worry about paying for parking in las vegas.",9M8PtXcHhP5y4wgcR_Iv8w,0,0,2,iXpnf829EU6aEItjdshKkQ

Food: If you need a Chicken & Waffles fix, this is a great and quick stop. The waffles are Belgium style and are light, airy and with cinnamon sugar sprinkle you don't need a lot of syrup.

Unfortunately...it isn't that great. Even more unfortunately, my boyfriend had never tried chicken and waffles together before that place, and despite all of my ranting and raving about the true culinary masterpiece that is a good plate of chicken and waffles, he wasn't buying it.
Well, thanks to this place, he understands now. 
You have your choice of savory, sweet, traditional, and non-traditional waffle sandwiches. 
To play it safe, we just stuck with the original and Nashville sandwiches. 
What this place gets right, and what is most important about chicken and waffle sandwiches, is that the waffle can't be too soggy or crisp, and the chicken can't be overly fried. The waffle here has just the right amount of moisture, while still firm. The chicken isn't overly breaded or fried...it's like eating a chick-fil-a chicken breast, with different seasoning, on a good waffle. A+ quality.

Perhaps they over fried it, cause it was not golden brown but rather a very dark color. Or maybe its all the over the top seasoning in the breading that gave it that unattractive color.

4 stars for the fried pickles alone! In our 6 day Vegas trip, I tried fried pickles from three different places and Bruxie's were the best. First, they're cut thick, which is different than most (thinner slices/cut like spears). Second, they dredge in delicious seasoning (like their fried chicken). I loved that the seasoning had a bit of heat. 

I was lucky that when I arrived, there was only 2 people in front of me. After, a huge line started forming out of the door. 

I will say that they seem incredibly inefficient. I watched my pickles sit under the heat lamp for a solid 5 minutes until a worker came by to fulfill/bag my order.

I have yet to make it to the dessert waffles due to being overly full, but I will soon.

I will say I remember the waffle fries being a little more well done in the LA location, which they tend not to be so much here and also the portion is a little smaller.  They may be fresh waffle fries so like some other fry places, I'll just need to ask for them a little more on the well done side.

I will say that our last visits have been during our hot Summer months and for some reason the doors are always opened and only half of the room have fans, so expect warm eating conditions, this is unfortunately the only part I don't like

Only knowing about this place in Cali, I've always wanted to try it but never got to! 
But how awesome that these little known places are starting to creep their way into Vegas!

Unfortunately have only been here twice since it's located on The Strip (where no local really likes to travel to, lol!), but well worth it!

Located in ""The Park"", a great new addition to the Strip, same area as T-Mobile Arena, New York New York, Shake Shack, Beerhaus, CPK, Sake Rok and the big, tall lady statue! 

Casual spot. Lots of seating inside, a handful outside. Open kitchen view where you see them making waffles on the waffle makers. Cool decors, i.e. the waffle maker wall, garage like separator from the semi-outdoor seating to inside, chrome touches, etc. 

I've tried ""The Original"" Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich ($9.25) and it is an extra $4 more to add Waffle Fries (aka side) and a drink! 
Big, crispy, flavorful, juicy chicken breast in between a crunchy-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside, airy, light, Belgian waffle, topped with chili honey (salty & sweet goodness!) and cider slaw! I'm a sucker for fries so those were awesome too, but talk about carb-overload!

Service was fast and the workers were on top of everything!

3. Fried pickles: hmmmm, not a great idea. I only like pickles inside. 
4. Root beer: we got it in a weird and funny way because I said ""for here"" and the waiter thought I said ""root beer"". I usually do not order drinks and just drink water. I will probably try their milkshake.

1737543,2017-04-07,0,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,"LIBERO IN LAS VEGAS: In town for a volleyball (vball) tournament and Las Vegas is a destination for many things, including an interesting dining experience. Back in November we tried chicken and waffles (C&W; someone in our trio's first time) and I was directed to try Bruxie, a restaurant with locations here as well as in Southern California.

A 'libero' in vball is responsible for defense and to foster rallies and digs to make the game more fun to watch. I give you this definition because Bruxie reminds me of this role. A re-imagined take on what is now an epidemic of C&W spots all claiming to be authentic, Bruxie's twist is presenting the dish as a sandwich with the waffle's role creating the excitement.

Used as the bread, now C&W is a sandwich to be picked up, held and savored. Some have lettuce, arugula pesto, tomato and various preparations of chicken - Nashville hot, original seasoned, crispy and buffalo-style. Lot of choices including dessert waffles, custards  and sundaes so there's something for everyone who wants decadence with skosh of guilt. Don't expect any healthy options here!

The chicken was the star for me. Served hot (although not too busy, it took a little longer than we thought), golden brown w/a kick of heat on the backside and extremely flavorful with an crunchy crust drizzled in chili honey my two piece original was moist white meat which I'd recommend. Now I understand what the few extra minutes were for - fresh preparation.

For me though, the waffle wasn't as successful. With the two piece you get a bacon cheddar waffle. Thick in height, light with a savory batter the waffle missed in one way - the bit of bacon seemed caramelized and we crunchy like candy. if intentional, this wasn't a pleasant bite for me as the bacon flavor was non-existent. Crunch, no munch.

Overall though, a great chicken outweighs the waffle and holds the team together and you should put Bruxie in your lineup.",IzgEl5xXE5cdMTv1Fxspig,0,0,3,TVi4OTJm0dNgrR11Pz3Asg

It was good, I can't complain but my absolute favorite is the Nashville chicken. 3rd time I had it as strips with the waffle cut fries - absolutely mouthwatering. Have a meal here, seriously, you won't regret it!

I ordered an original fried chicken and waffle sandwich ($9.25) and it arrived looking NOTHING like the menu picture. I decided to put that grievance aside, but was met with on overly crisp waffle paired with an oddly sized piece of chicken. The cider slaw and chili honey were pooled at the bottom of the waffle fold and shortly after picking up my sandwich it split in half...dumping all the honey and slaw over my tray. The waffle, being overcooked was not pleasant to eat as its rough texture was anything but the fluffy waffle I've experienced in the past (at their Orange County location).

Also, when the menu says fried chicken or Tenders, I expect fried chicken or tenders. Instead, it was fried chicken breasts and breast tenders. I would have just ordered the tenders or a smaller order because It was way too much food for 2 people. We ordered a bigger portion because we thought it was just regular bone-in fried chicken pieces, not full breasts. What we ordered could have easily fed 3-4 people. The Irish nachos good.

Initially, I was completely blown away by the Nashville Hot Chicken (skillet with cheddar waffle). It was crispy and the portions were good. I love hot chicken and normally wish it was hotter at other places. Well this was HOT hot chicken!! Woohoo! 

The waffle was meant to balance out the chicken spice. It had a lot of large sugar chunks on the outside which were welcome at first but over time it became way too sickly sweet. There were just too many sugar chunks. The waffle also was dense. So dense and kinda gooey on the inside. I was hoping for fluffy. 

Between the sickly sweet waffle and the inferno chicken, my tastebuds are totally fried. They tried too hard to strike a balance between the intensely sweet and intensely hot.

I ordered the chicken waffle sandwich with fries.

Im giving this 4 stars because the food was good, although the fries were heavily over salted. The staff was kind of awkward to me. 

No one seemed to have real restaurant experience, as they looked to be wandering aimlessly not even looking at what trays needed to be taken or if anyone needed anything. 

Then what I thought was funny was they give you number trackers so they know what numbers are sitting where so they can just drop the food off directly to you.

Menu: 
It's not a big menu, but you're here for the FC&W so look to order one of the variations for a crowd pleaser. 

Decor:
They have a wall made from waffle irons.
The seating is plentiful, but the amount of space they allowed themselves for lines to form is far from adequate. Also, when they are ringing people up, it's hard to get a single file line setup as people tend to bunch up. A designated line 1 & 2 should be implemented with one of those retractable rope devices.

Luckily, she enjoyed it. If you have a small stomach or get full fast, split a sandwich with a friend!",Jx6QyS5unW1yBe1do3kFsw,1,1,4,YAFuXjfXXYb-6oD49_7sgg

Waffle is super light and thin with a good crisp exterior (would have preferred a little more bite but satisfied) 

Chicken is well seasoned and cooked just right - plenty of spices, crispy exterior and moist interior

Spicy maple syrup was a nice touch that helped to bring the sandwich together 

Waffle fries lacked a crispy texture and interior was too airy

It's a good size for sharing and at $6.95, you're unlikely to find a more satisfying dessert in The Park. This is the perfect sweet stop after watching a concert at T-Mobile arena.

There are a few similar waffle sandwich concepts already in Las Vegas, but Bruxie serves it up at a comparable price point with higher quality ingredients. I didn't feel like I was being overcharged to compensate for the Strip location. Service was engaged and excellent, starting with a young man in front of the restaurant who ran to get me a sample cup of their creamy frozen custard when I asked about the product.

The chicken perfectly fried and lightly battered. The slaw and chili-honey sauce complemented each other nicely. TIP: order an extra side of the sauce for dipping/topping.

Once we started eating things were good until I quickly realized they did not give us the regular strips.

I had a random craving for chicken fingers and totally overlooked this, but glad I didn't this time. The batter was crispy and flaky, but was not falling off the chicken so they certainly represented on that night. The chicken itself was very moist and not a bite over cooked as I've grown used to.

We thought fries would be especially when we got there right when the restaurant opened. You basically order your food here and go to your table and they bring you your food. It gets pretty messy with a sandwich and especially with syrup involves it can get sticky. They don't have a very convenient bathroom or sink that you can wash your hands right after eating. They have ice water near the napkins and condiments section which was nice.

Totally caught my eye as this complex by NYNY is new to me since I was last in Vegas.
Came in for lunch and had to try their original chicken and waffle sandwich. Hubby had their hot pastrami and Swiss. We also tried their strawberry lemonade, waffle fries, and mac and cheese.

Maybe I have a giant stomach but I didn't find the sandwich that big. I had plenty of room for sides after eating the sandwich.

Both sandwiches were great - messy but super tasty. Waffles were nice and light and the meats were nicely done. Crispy but not too greasy.
Waffle fries were average. Mac and cheese was below average - kind of reminded me of a cheese whiz. Would skip that for sure.
Loved the strawberry lemonade! Nice balance against the saltiness of the rest of the meal.

But as Ellen L. mentioned yesterday, this location seems to be lacking the consistency that the California Bruxie's have. 

A nearby restaurant had a considerably long line, so we decided to eat at Bruxie, having noticed earlier that there was no line at this location. The ambiance of the restaurant is much like the other locations, and that is important in capturing the essence of the original location, which was and is a small shack on an intersection in Orange. I decided to order the Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar; something I've come to love and is one of my two favorite waffles at Bruxie. In addition to that, I ordered the seasonal Eggnog Shake, just for kicks. The whole ordering process was pretty smooth, except I was expecting them to ask whether I wanted the Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar with a light spread of mayo but she didn't ask. 

The food came out quickly; drinks first, followed by all of the entrees shortly thereafter. When I bit into the BEC, it didn't taste right and seemed to be missing a bit of flavor. It didn't take me long to realize they didn't put mayo in it. Now this was easily remedied by asking for some mayo from the staff and it did taste good afterwards, but the issue again comes down to consistency. 

I have been, am, and will be a fan of Bruxie, but I think this location needs to step it up.

2392987,2017-03-29,0,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,"Having always been a fan of Bruxie, I was excited to see that Vegas now has one located right next to Shake Shack! It's been a while since I've had a delicious chicken and waffle sandwich and Bruxie sure did deliver. I ordered the Nashville Style Hot waffle sandwich which included a nice and juicy fried chicken thigh with shredded lettuce, pickles, and a nice tangy sauce to top it off. I opted out of the pickles since I'm not a fan, but everything else about the sandwich was just so delightful, I loved it. The waffle was soft, fluffy, and not too thick so you wouldn't get tired of it easily.  The chicken was fried to perfection and since it was dark meat, it wasn't dry at all. A couple days late on this review, I'm definitely starting to drool as I'm trying to remember every bite I had. 

As if the chicken sandwich alone wasn't enough, I tempted myself to get a kids meal with a small order of waffle cut fries and mac n cheese. I wanted to get both as sides but fearing that the side orders would be too much, I ordered the kids meal thinking the portions would be smaller. Not sure if this is the case, but it definitely was the right amount for me! You also get a kids cup of either lemonade, soda, or milk with it. Both the fries and mac n cheese were bomb, if you happen to be on the fence like me - I say just do it! 

Having ordered way too much food already, I had to mentally stop myself from getting one of their sweet waffles. The Creme Brulee waffle looked so heavenly and luscious, I definitely died a little inside... But it's okay, this just gives me another reason to be back next time! 

Service was good, not great. After you order they give you what looks like a pager or buzzer, but it actually doesn't buzz. It has a number on it and once your order is ready, the workers call out your number and after spotting you, they walk over to hand you your order. This might be more efficient inside, but since we sat outside, it was a little unorganized. I think having an actual buzzer and just having customers walk up to pick up their order would be much easier. They forgot my fries and drink and I had to walk back to the counter to ask for it. It's no big deal, but I think it's easier to just pick everything up all at once at the counter than having the workers struggle with bringing everything out to you. But regardless, the workers were really friendly and got me my fries and drink right away!

Overall, I totally recommend if you're a waffle lover!",63lLb-67EgP4wXx9GbKHDQ,0,0,4,qxn9J4GVjBstDCNwQ-8Q6w

BUT the irish nachos and chicken tenders were OK. The waffle cut fries that were in the Irish Nachos were delish but the cheese sauce was just not doing it for me.

While I am normally one that goes for fine dining, every know & then a fast casual spot does the trick. So while heading down the strip i figured this was where i would stop for a quick bite before heading to ride the High Roller. I want feeling the waffle sandwich which they are known for, instead I tried the cheddar bacon waffle.. with kicker chicken (breast). I must admit, I was a little leery of a waffle with cheddar and bacon inside but it was delicious! The waffle was soft & tender and the cheddar blended perfectly. The chicken was crispy and a lil spicey.. the perfect combination for me. 

The only drawback was the waffle seemed to have been pieces of actual sugar in the waffle. Guess that was the pearl sugar listed on the menu. I didn't like that at all. I figured that was the sugar used in the production of the waffle. Overall, it was a good experience but please... hold the sugar for being blended into t by e waffle as an ingredient... not pieces of a sugar cube cooked into the waffle.

Overall, this place gets 5 stars; however, I would recommend when there are more than a few people in line it would be awesome if you could take orders from both stations. 

Anyway, we were the fourth in line and had to wait about 7 minutes to place our order.  We don't mind waiting for the food at the table; however, it would have been nice to place the order just a bit faster.

We both had a sandwich.  I had the buffalo chicken waffle sandwich and the other person in our party had the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich.  We also shared an order of the Irish Nachos/Fries.  

Everything we had was cooked perfectly and it just had so many amazing flavor profiles.  Man oh man  -- if this wasn't so bad for you -- I would eat it nearly everyday.  The waffle was perfect and fluffy and the chicken was tender, cooked to perfection and so delicious.

Very casual ambiance where people order at the front and then find seats in the back- luckily we were able to beat the lunch crowd 11am on Sunday and so we could get a seat inside.  

I went with the Original Fried Chicken and Waffle (my friends ordered another original sandwich and the Original Seasoned Fried Chicken and Waffle Skillet) and we decided to order Fried Chicken Poutine to share.  The sandwich is rather filling already, especially for one who tends to avoid food with a lot of grease.  I usually don't like spicy foods, but the chicken and waffle had a great sweet-and-spicy balance.  Chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside (thank god) and the waffle was nice and crunchy!  The only complaint I had was that I literally took one bite of the sandwich and the waffle broke apart immediately and splattered sauce all over me... definitely a 5-napkin meal in my case.

First time trying poutine- absolutely delicious though it kinda was an overkill on top of everything else we ordered (three girls had a hard time finishing half of it)!  I know poutine is supposed to be very rich, and it was very hearty- just be prepared to completely pass out afterwards!  

If you are someone who loves fried food, has a hangover, or is completely willing to enter a food coma for the whole day, this is a good place to check out- not sure if it's necessarily the place for someone who is completely sober and prefers lighter meals.",-oksEyZRFqwe708oV0CBQg,0,0,3,d-lMwBAeMjSIwPsc1aFRJg

- 2 Piece fried chicken Nashville Hot style
- Lemon and berry cream waffle
- Frozen Custard

This is not my first experience at Bruxie as I've dined at their various locations in SoCal. 

Instead of ordering a waffle sandwich this time I changed it up and ordered their fried chicken with waffles. The chicken came out piping hot glistening with the Nashville Hot sauce. The batter was perfectly crisp and the sauce had a pretty good kick. Close to bordering too hot for someone that doesn't like too spicy. 

The waffle was burned as you can see in my photos. I chalked it up to the bacon and sugar that was in the batter. But I think it was way overdone and looked burned. Not sure how they could have plated this and brought it out. The waffle was also sweet with pockets of sugar, designed I believe to cut the spicy chicken. 

The Savior was the lemon and berry cream waffle. The cream was tart with a nice hint of lemon to offset the crispy and not burned waffle. The raspberries were a perfect compliment to top it all off. 

The custard was more icy than what I remember at the other Bruxie locations. I didn't get the rich and creamy taste that I remembered from my other times. 

Skip the fried chicken and stick to the waffle sandwiches. I noticed that everyone else's waffles were perfectly cooked except mine.",OiOR2NtTkfe-SPxsxSa85g,3,1,2,x6j8EZeJ0VRA15B_TxjXTg

I went with my family for brunch around 10 am on a Wednesday. There was a decent amount of people at the restaurant. The service was also very nice, the lady taking our order was extremely kind.

I got the Original Chicken Waffle Sandwich, which was $11.95 and my brother got the Holy Chicken! Waffle Sandwich, which was also $11.95. I wanted something to satisfy my sweet tooth, so I got the Nutella and Banana Waffle, $5.95. Also we got a side of Coleslaw for $2.95.

I first have to say, this place has the BEST waffle I've ever had in my life. I personally love crispy waffles than soft and cakey ones. Bruxie serves just the PERFECT waffle. It's crisp and not so thick, it perfectly companies the fried chicken. The Original Chicken Waffle Sandwich tasted AMAZING, the price was also very reasonable for the portions and quality of the food. The Coleslaw was the best I've ever had too. Now the dessert waffle, Nutella and Banana Waffle was just lovely. It tasted like HEAVEN. Everything harmonized together and in my opinion, the waffle went with the sweet better than the savory.

The salads are also amazing and their waffle fries make the perfect pair with any sandwich. I've tried many places and haven't found anyone who gets this combination right....until now.

For whatever reason, they have 2 cash registers but only chose to operate one that day.  I don't understand this at all.  I would assume that Sunday mornings were a normally busy time so why were they not prepared to handle the crowd?

Anyway - on to the food.  Just ok.  I LOVE Nashville hot chicken, so I was super excited to try out the hot chicken and waffles sandwich.  The waffle - very good.  Hot chicken...not so good.  It was super sweet and not what I was really looking for, although I thought the slaw was tasty.  The quality of the chicken was great, very moist, I just didn't love the hot chicken flavor.  My wife got the original and basically gave the same review.  Super super sweet but good waffle and good quality chicken.

Oh yeah - the coffee - DO NOT GET IT.  -3 out of 5 stars.  Burnt, bitter, worst gas station coffee we've ever had.  There was not enough cream/sugar in the building that could have made it taste remotely good.

The food came quicker than expected, the food looked really tasty. There was one downside to this though, when ordering i specifically asked for no sauce at all, but when my food came there was mayonnaise on it. They replaced the waffle in no time but that is not the reason why this has a low rating. 
The chicken had a very nice look to it, the texture of it was decent, and it could pass for real nashville hot chicken. But looks isn't what makes the food good. The chicken was indeed tender, and crispy. But, the chicken had no flavor what so ever, it tasted like as if it was overcooked or if they used old oil. The waffle just tasted like a wafer with no flavor and almost made me puke when I was eating the waffle by itself. The place itself has a very nice aesthetic to it and it could be a good hangout spot and if you're looking for something quick to eat, very outgoing and polite employees.

When the employee brought out the sandwich she also brought out an extra pan for us since we were splitting it and she also had it cut in half to make it easier for us.

There was a crunch in every bite. The chicken inside again, oh my freaking goodness! So flavorful and so moist. Usually chicken breast can be a little dry but this chicken breast was the best of all breast. How do they get it that moist and juicy?! I want one right now just writing about it. The waffle fries were good but could use a little bit of salt. They were just plain waffle fries but had the perfect crisp to it. The orange soda, it was delicious. It was sugar cane orange soda.

I thought it was great, but I can understand why he didn't like it. If I go back, I'll just have to do so without him.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,4,4,xDyyckXv9vTkLpiyUu3Mog

2787421,2018-04-25,12,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,"Holy moly these waffles are fantastic.

The hardest decision at Bruxie is whether to go sweet or savory. But you really can't go wrong with anything that you order.

I took the sweet route and ordered a waffle sandwich stuffed with nutella, sweet cream and bananas. I also asked to add strawberries on... so like relatively healthy? Here's to hoping. The waffle was perfectly crunchy and sweet and came topped with a generous sprinkling of powdered sugar. Although I'd love to try some of their other menu items it'd be tough not to order this on a future trip. To drink I went with house made strawberry lemonade. You can also add champagne to this if you are feeling crazy... did not do this, and regret not doing this. 

My fiance absolutely loves chicken and waffles and he was a big fan of Bruxie's take on it. This is a cheddar jalepeno waffle served with either two or three plump and crispy chicken strips with sides of honey and butter for dipping. So decadent and so delicious. 

If it's a nice day take your waffles to go and eat them at one of the many tables in T-Mobile park. There aren't that many 'fast casual' options on the strip that aren't complete garbage, and food in the casinos is of course way overpriced. Bruxie was a nice happy medium, and a great option for snagging a quality breakfast on the strip.",84t6jpyclA55TMfMV0X0kA,24,22,5,uqClyjlUe8LB6QAvnV-WeA

The chicken was super crispy, but very salty. I felt like drinking a lot of water after eating the whole sandwich.

I liked how there was a lot of lettuce and tomato slices.

The cab driver didn't know the place, and the cab drop off was fairly far considering we had luggage, but I'm glad we stopped.

My finacee and I were hungry after walking around the strip and I was happy to find out that they had a location in Las Vegas. There was line that was out the door when we arrived, but it moved quickly and our orders were taken and we were sat before we knew it. Now, since the only other Bruxie I've been to was the original location, I wasn't used to the servers having to get your drinks for refills. I understand why because of the way the setup is for this particular location, just wondering if the other locations in CA do this as well? We ordered ""The Original"" and added an egg to it, the ""Nashville Hot"", a Strawberry Palmer, and a ginger soda. I'm glad to say that the food was just as tasty and just as enjoyable as the original location. My finacee enjoyed the Original very much. The chicken filet still had that nice crunch to it and the nice flavor of the herbs and spices. My Nashville Hot had a nice kick to it, but I don't think people from Nashville would call this ""hot"" at all. I enjoyed it because I was able to still taste the chicken, the kick of the spice, and the rest of the seasoning, without overpowering my palate. The Strawberry Palmer was flavorful enough to get the strawberry flavor without being overly sweet. The Ginger soda was a bit strong on the ginger flavor. Also, unfortunately the waffle fries were a bit tough and luke warm. I prefer my fries, crisp and hot.

I was impressed to see the different ways you can have your chicken made to go with your waffle ranging from the mildly spicy ""Original"" with chilly honey to ""Kickin chicken"" which is pretty spicy! We tried both and they were both amazing! Also they make their waffles thin so they're almost like bread is to a sandwich! Easier to eat and equally delicious. 

The buffalo Mac and cheese here is served on a skillet and is soooo good! Also, they were great about holding the bacon on it for us.

Back in the day, The Strip lacked a lot of things, specifically good casual eating spots. Slowly, but surely the times are a changin' and Bruxie is the newest of the new when it comes to casual comfort food eating. I came to Bruxie and went hard, I ordered the Nashville Waffle Chicken Sandwich and the Bacon Mac n' Cheese bake. 

The Nashville Waffle Sandwich, which by the way is a Vegas only option, mimics the Buffalo Bleu Sandwich, minus the gross Bleu cheese crumbles. I'm sorry if you like bleu cheese, but it's pretty much the devil in cheese form. The sandwich is a spicy fried chicken breast tossed in Buffalo Sauce, topped with a veggie slaw and two huge pickles on top. The hotness level was perfect, the sour dill mixed with the spice and light sweetness of the waffle really worked. Stoner Food. Level, Expert. 

The Mac N' Cheese, was stellar; crunchy cheese on top with a gooey warm cheese center and big chunks of bacon. My only gripe about this is the portion size, for six dollars I felt like the dish it was served in could have been deeper. I mean this cost about as much as the sandwich itself. 

Bruxie is a fun option while at the Park and just different enough to be worth your ever valuable dollar. The price point is set to Strip Prices, so be ready for sticker shock when you get the total, my meal alone was $25 with tip. Still, I would go back and try another, which my I'm leaving a four-star here.

It was a relatively close walk to the MGM and very highly rated. We strolled over on our first full day for breakfast/brunch at about 11am. It was pretty full on the inside, but since it was so hot inside, we opted to sit outside instead. 

Bruxie specializes in waffles - specifically waffles with chicken (although there are plenty of options without chicken as well). You order at the counter and they bring your food to your table later. I had the Buffalo Bleu Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich, which features fried chicken coated in buffalo sauce and served with crisp vegetable slaw, bleu cheese crumbles, chives, and ranch dressing. 

The chicken was very moist and tender on the inside and super crunchy on the outside. Surprisingly, the ""structural integrity"" (words that get thrown around when you travel with 3 engineers) of the waffle was very strong. You can hold it up and eat it like a real sandwich without it falling apart.

Me and my GF shared an Original chicken sandwich and an order of the Irish fries.
The chicken sandwich was fantastic! The chicken was tender, juicy, and very well seasoned. It did not have that typical oily finish as you would think from a fried item. Biting into it there was an amazing bounce to the waffle and the chicken. The maple syrup sauce blended perfectly with the sandwich and gave it a nice sweet flavor without taking away from the crisp of the chicken and the waffle. The coleslaw worked very well in the sandwich by adding some extra crunch and tanginess. My only complaint is that my bottom waffle was a little thin, making the bottom fall apart as I was eating. 
The Irish fries were good.. But they could have been better. The cheese on the fries tasted natural, but it was a little grainy and salty. This kind of overpowered the rest of the dish. 
The service was impeccable! A few times I got out of my chair to get something (it's more of a order up front and get utensils and water yourself place) and a server stopped me and said he would get it for me).

It has slaw on it and I almost requested that it be left off because I'm usually not a fan. However, the slaw was tasty and doesn't take away from the deliciousness of the sandwich. 

I ordered the vanilla cream soda to go with it and it was also delicious.  The bf thought it was too sweet but I thought it was perfect.

Instead of getting that version I could only get a plain waffle with strawberries on the side.

The food arrived quick and looked impressive.  Not sure whose idea it was to make a waffle sandwich, but it's really hard to eat.  I'm not sure how you're supposed to eat this with your hands.  I ended up using a fork and knife cutting the pieces of chicken and waffle and dipping it in the maple syrup.  The waffle is light and crispy, similar to an Eggo.  The boneless chicken breast was crispy and juicy, though I was expecting it to be spicier and more heavily seasoned. The sandwich has pickles, lettuce and some kind of mayo, which I think is weird as I want to eat chicken and waffles with syrup.  Kind of wish there was an option to get just the chicken and waffle, not as a sandwich, though I'm sure you could request it.  The waffle fries were awesome and super crispy.  Even thought it was fast food style, the guy still came around to ask me how the food was and refilled my beverage.  

The restaurant was spotless with tons of seating and TV's all around.  Came at dinner time and there was only one other family there.  Maybe people aren't hungry for hot chicken and waffles when it's 105 degrees out.

I've been wanting to try Bruxie after walking past it while strolling around the strip. There was a poster of their ""Holy Chicken!"" sandwich outside of the restaurant and I was tempted to try it out for my first time. This sandwich consists of the fried chicken (maple glazed), bacon, cheese, Sriracha sauce, with Sunny-Side Up egg along with the waffles. Bruxie does an amazing job making the waffle crispy thin and not too heavy to go along with the chicken. If you're more of a waffle person than a chicken person, I probably wouldn't recommend it because the waffles are crispier and thin rather than fluffy and sweet!

Their servings are pretty huge but you also get what you paid for as this sandwich was around $13 (YIKES)! I also tried their ""Palmer"" drink and it was perfect since it was not too sweet. 

I came around 11:30-ish am and it wasn't that packed but by the time I left, there was a line out the door around 12pm so I would try to go before noon. There are plenty of seats outside and inside but I can definitely see this place getting packed throughout the day when it would be hard to find a seat. 

The process to order and eat is pretty fast and easy. You receive a buzzer while acts like a tracker for the servers to find the table and deliver the food to you! I love this concept because you don't actually have to get up and pick-up your food. 

I gave this place a 4/5 because I felt that this place was a boujee way of incorporating soul food for hipsters to like, it wasn't anything too special that ""wow'd"" me. Overall, I'm a big fan!

I am not a big chicken and waffles fan because the chicken is usually dry or bland and the waffle is usually basic. Thank you BRUXIE for showing me what true chicken and waffles are suppose to be. I got the chicken and waffle skillet after a recommendation from a food runner there (who took the time to discuss the menu with me :-))  DELICIOUS from the first to the last bite. The chicken was moist, fries well, and seasoned all the way through. The waffle was dense and flavorful. I don't do a lot of bacon infused foods, so I was hesitant but the bacon was not overpowering and real complemented all the flavors. 

The service was great. Multiple people asked how the food was, which came out promptly despite the small rush they had. There were people constantly circling to clear plates, offer refills, and just saying hello with a welcome smile.

Located at The Park around the corner from the restaurants in front of New York New York.  

There's a name to describe the atmosphere.  Not sure if hipster, trendy, or sustainable is the word, but the interior is similar to Skinny Fats.  Since the weather was nice, the large windows were open, and the Big Ass Fans (that is what they are called) were in motion.      

You must go in line to order, and they bring the food to you.  The line was long when I went, but it went by fast.  

I got the buffalo bleu fried chicken waffle sandwich with a side of waffle fries.  Also ordered the Liege waffle.  Buffalo bleu was mediocre in flavor.  The waffle fries are like Chic-Fil-A waffle fries.  The Liege waffle was my favorite:  fried on the outside, and heavy and doughy on the inside.  Top was lightly coated with powdered sugar.

So much hype because it's new and something you don't see everyday.  Good experience, but the taste was just mediocre.",SVcQ8yqaLDmjMwPRDwQPaA,4,3,4,3cKsGFib0-OAI8ar6Sf-5g

Delicious! I personally had The Classic sandwich and like I said everything was cooked perfectly. I found it to be a bit dry so I added a decent amount of syrup and hot sauce. The fries were also so good! Reminds me of chick fil-a. Food came in ten minutes, and the sandwiches are large and filling for roughly $11-$12. There's a party in my tummy - so yummy so yummy :D

Now as for the management I felt there is some definite room for improvement. The young lady who took my order was less than pleasant. She had lip piercings and super dark eye makeup, which is all good  but she genuinely just seemed like she was pissed off and hated everyone. She never smiled or recommended anything good to try. Just stood there as if I was doing her an inconvenience. I don't understand why she was the first person we saw when we entered the place, when they have amazing employees such an Vanessa (she brought out our food) who are happy, smiley and bring a good aura. 

The tables were all dirty, we had to clean our own! Which is totally BS cause I could see a manager ( I assume) in a burgundy sweater just standing around in the back. There was one girl (I didn't get her name, but she was a young African American lady w/ her hair in a bun ) who was working her ass off! She never stopped moving the whole time I was there! Whenever she got a free moment she would wipe down a few tables and then go back to fulfilling milkshake/drink orders. I also saw her keeping up the restrooms. My point being, she was working 2x while manager stood around. I can't stand that. 
The condiment area was lacking. Only one of the ketchup pumps worked and it was incredibly messy. 
Although they did keep two water jugs out with cups - super awesome especially in summer time heat. 

I probably won't make the trip here again as it was fun but not unforgettable. If I was a guest at New York New York I would 100% say check it out cause it's fun but for locals, just hit chick fil a.",qfP7mVenCRYqijLiWOIWUQ,1,0,4,eDNdcXpuGRRqUziIyGPiBw

CONS: Can get busy

During our trip to Vegas a couple weeks ago, my sister-in-law, a Las Vegas local, recommended we try this place for their delicious waffles. She ended up taking my husband and daughter there and both were so pleased with the place that they convinced me to go try it the next day. 

We went back on a Friday around 10:00 am and I could tell that the crowd was close on our tails. When we got in line, we were already near the door. (You order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you.) Our family of four ordered a Country Sausage & Egg Sandwich, The Original (Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich), a Holy Chicken, a Naked Bruxie Waffle, and a Mint Shake. The sandwiches were much larger and much more filling than I expected. And to top it off, all the food we had was absolutely delicious. The meals even come with a mini bottle of their maple syrup (which I took home with me). The Mint Shake even had REAL mint leaves in it, not just mint flavor added. 

As a native of the Bay Area, chicken and waffle joints are commonplace for me. And I've never really cared too much for them. I mean, it's fried chicken. And a waffle. No biggie, right? Then why, after over a week am I still thinking about how Bruxie's waffles have perfectly married the two? Why can I still vividly recall that when I bit into the waffle it delightfully crunched then casually melted in my mouth?

So my sister-in-law had breakfast there today. She sent us photos. And now, I'm looking for an excuse to come back to Vegas to visit family, of course, and to have a waffle while I'm there.",zJg_PhFJ0kXNh-eUFOufQg,1,0,5,spLY4-JOAm-GNbD09RszWg

3398454,2017-07-07,1,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,"It was a hangover Tuesday for us and we were ready for some brunch. A quick search resulted in Bruxie which offered chicken & waffles which got us instantly excited. Now, I know that chicken and waffles isn't a new concept anymore. It got really big about 5 years ago and now almost every other restaurant offers this option. However, if done right, a meal of chicken & waffles can hit the ball out of the park when it comes to recovering from a very late night in Vegas. 

Here are my ratings based on different criteria:

Quality of food: Really good. We split an order of the original Chicken & Waffles, a side of waffle fries, and a strawberry lemonade. The original comes with Seasoned Breast, Chili Honey, all topped with Cider Slaw. The waffles are thin but go really well with the thick pieces of juicy crispy chicken breast. The syrup on the waffles was done just right and wasn't overly sweet. The waffle fries were very crispy. I recommend getting a side of the Bruxie sauce and dipping your waffle fries in them. The strawberry lemonade was on the tart side which I did not like.

Decor: Bright and Trendy! They have huge LED TVs with menus on them. The thing that I liked about the TVs was that the menu stayed on constantly instead of changing screens while you're trying to read the menu...don't you just hate that?!? One thing that I wish they had was a story on how Bruxie got started.

Cleanliness: No complaints. The tables, floor, and bathrooms were clean.

Service: Both the cashier and the person that brought us food to our table did it with a smile. However, they really blew it when it comes to forgetting part of our order. We had ordered a side of waffle fries and after the server acknowledged that she forgot them, it took her a solid 10 minutes to bring us just the fries. She kept bringing and filling other people's orders but I had to walk over and remind her again about the fries.

Speed of food preparation: Fast...except when it comes to bringing something they forgot. Like I said above, they need to figure out how to be fast on bringing something they missed in the original order.

Price: Expensive. We paid $12 for just one order of Waffle & Fries which seemed a little steep. A side of fries was $4. The quality is pretty good but the price can be a little bit lower.

I recommend Bruxie for some really tasty Chicken & Waffles.",wzA2spUhc2G1yQNNJsS8EA,3,1,4,_8lffzUe0-8wNAhhmYJl5w

Original Fried Chicken and Waffle sandwich (4.5 stars) - Very tasty seasoned fried chicken with a dash of chili honey and slaw in a waffle to be eaten like a sandwich. Cool and so delicious. Only downer was that waffle was a bit cold, wish it was warm like the rest of the sandwich.

Carolina BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich (4 stars) - Carolina BBQ sauce was really good with a slight kick. Pulled pork itself was a bit mushy. But the BBQ sauce with the meat and the waffle worked nicely together. Again the waffle itself was a bit cold.

Atmosphere is modern and atmosphere was lively, a bit hectic on opening week. Managers and servers are super attentive and friendly to make sure you have a great first experience.

It's part of the new Park area in between NYNY and Monte Carlo. Part of a bunch of new hip  places to try around there.

You grab the utensils you need, extra syrup if you want and water is dispensed near there as well. I don't think they have people cleaning after you all the time, so the table we sat at was dirty from the customers before us.
It's a big portion but I think it's doable to finish the meal by yourself. There wasn't really anything special about the chicken or the waffle.

A friend of mine invited me to go walk around at the strip. I got starving, my friend saw a ""waffle chicken place"", but I'm following the low carb diet...
I entered there and asked if they could switch for a grill chicken on the salad (Buttermilk fried chicken Cobb)... omg! They did amazing! A totally KETO SALAD! Pretty yummy! Love it!

I went for a waffle chicken sandwich ( which is what they are known for); since I love barbecue sauce I chose the barbecue chicken sandwich that came with slaw and crispy onions. While all the ingredients were nice and tasty: chicken perfectly cooked, onion rings a very nice touch and great waffle that was perfectly crisp, the barbecue sauce was no good. It tasted like a slightly bitter tomato sauce with nothing else to it; I was highly disappointed and immediately regretted not getting one of the original chicken sandwiches (which was recommended Yelp). It tainted the taste of everything and I feel like this place deserves a five for taste, but I cannot give it that because of the barbecue sauce.
I also ordered a side of their waffle fries which were good, I wish I would have ordered them loaded I am sure they would have been fantastic!
The business had a simple yet appealing and clean set up. The whole place was very clean,  stocked with outlets for you to charge your phone and the sauce station was nice as well. The service was friendly and surprisingly fast.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone; please don't make the same mistake I did and stay away from the barbecue sauce, so you can truly taste the quality of their food.",8iUnOwV5iiMQRA7d09Rb2A,4,4,4,RtTZZkKvh0476B6B3BvQ6g

I went with a few other friends and ordered their buffalo bleu waffle sandwich. My friends tried the crispy chicken (I think that's what it's called), one of the breakfast sandwiches, and a caesar salad. The pricing was fair considering it's more of a ""specialty"" type of food. The sandwich was about $10. The food came out really fast in less than 10 minutes. 

The portion size is huge, I had difficulty finishing the whole thing. The chicken was crispy and juicy, really really good. I love buffalo sauce and I really enjoyed the sauce on the buffalo bleu. The coleslaw was just okay, a bit flavorless. I was expecting a bit more creamyness from the slaw to balance out the tangyness from the buffalo sauce. The first half of my sandwich was really good, but when I got to my second half it got to be too much. All you could taste was the strong buffalo sauce. Maybe it would be a good idea to get the buffalo sauce on the side? Regardless, this chicken and waffle combo really hit the spot. The waffle was light and crispy and did not get soggy at all. The waffle held up pretty well, which I was surprised! We ordered a side of waffle fries, which were pretty basic. I would skip on these. 

All in all, Bruxie lives up to its hype. It's good fast food that will fill you up. I wouldn't mind coming back!",ZpBvHdJUJ4iakpQj7Ll3AQ,4,1,4,_Yl6i2MIOkIWU9Pn4b_qtw

I ordered the crispy chicken waffle sandwich, Southern bbq waffle sandwich, and the original waffle sandwich. Out of the three my favorite was the southern bbq one because it had the most flavor. The chicken was decent and had some crisp to it. What made the dish delicious was bbq sauce and the crispy onion straws. The original sandwich was too bland for me and didn't have an interesting flavor profile. Crispy chicken was also good, but ironically wasn't super crispy lol. The chicken itself was dry, but I think it was more apparent since I didn't get much sauce in this sandwich.

Overall this place was decent. I think I like the location back at home because their sandwich quality is a bit more consistent and cheaper because I'm not paying tourist prices for food. If you do end up going here I'd recommend making your meal or combo or ordering 2 sandwiches if you want to be full.

The Bacon-Cheddar Waffle was the highlight of the meal! It had a crispy exterior with a fluffy interior. The 2 piece fried chicken (we got one of each flavor) is a MUST ORDER. The Holy Chicken sandwich was delicious too but not as good as the waffle that came with the sandwich is much thinner. We were so full from these two dishes that we should've skipped the other three side dishes. The waffle fries and the Mac & Cheese aren't particularly tasty enough to warrant special attention.

-Prosciutto and Swiss with arugula, whole grain mustard and a ""runny egg"". This was my favorite for sure! With you first bite breaking the egg it's yolk runs into every nook of the waffle getting a bit of each ingredient in every bite. So lite and simple yet satisfying! 
-Nutella & Banana with a cream sauce. Looking for a sweet waffle to end this experience I had to go with this, Nutella being a favorite of mine. Not overly sweet but the warm waffle keeping the warm and gooey with the right amount of bananas and cream sauce this did not disappoint!

One bite of that crispy waffle and I was hooked. Made to order fried chicken with the right amount of delicate crunch. I normally don't like sweet mixed with savory but the light smattering of chile honey distracted me from any excess sweetness. I love cole slaw on sandwiches! 

The sausage & egg waffle sandwich looks underwhelming compared to the Original, but the combo is a breakfast staple.

Nutella & bananas! Sweet cream and sprinkles of powdered sugar

We ordered thinly sliced pastrami & Swiss, waffle on the side to take home. I popped the waffle in the oven, along with the pastrami topped with cheese a few hours later-- soo good! 

Separated the lemon cream & raspberries so the waffle wouldn't get soggy. Dip waffle pieces into the tart lemon cream and add a berry-- refreshing and the berries aren't sour! 

Order at the counter, receive a pager, and choose a table. Staff will bring your order out. Water, utensils, maple syrup and condiments are available at the counter next to the registers.

I'm like Garfield The Cat who's theory is ""If it's not deep fried, it's not worth eating"" and the crispy 2 piece Fried Chicken definitely fit the bill.  I got the Nashville Hot version that came with a bacon cheddar waffle and some pickles.  The savory waffle was topped with maple butter and chunks of pearl sugar and I gotta say, the crunchy chunks of sugar was really addicting.  The mix of the sweet, savory, spicy, chewy, crunchy, and creamy definitely fit into the category of ""guilty pleasure"".  One thing I would be critical about is the chicken was super greasy but it was piping hot so it obviously came straight from the fryer to my tray.

Other than that, the staff was friendly and quickly cleared tables as people finished so even though it was crowded, waiting for a table wasn't a problem at all.

For a second night in a row, my husband suggested eating fried chicken since he had previously seen a billboard at Bruxie early in our stay.  

We have eaten at Bruxie's 2nd location at Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade and was happy to see a familiar California transplant here at The Park.  At this location, ordering typically easy as you walk in, you'll see the menu boards above the order counter.  First, order your food and beverage at the counter.  Next, you'll be given a small placard with a number that identifies your order.  Meanwhile, find seating that will accommodate your group and finally, a server will bring your food to you.

At this location, the service was friendly and efficient.  The food was tasty and served fresh and hot from the kitchen.  The fried chicken in our sandwiches had a crisp breading and the chicken breast meat was actually quite tasty and moist.  Waffles are used as the bun to the sandwiches.  The fresh baked waffles are light and crisp and hold their texture without getting soggy.

We enjoyed the food and flavors at this site.  The only surprises that we had were the higher prices of our draft beer ($8) and sandwiches.  Ah, but, this IS Las Vegas.",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,16,19,4,pw72GXtl_R8TA73V8KT64A

The waffle was puffy and crunchy in just the right amount. Paired with a Nashville Crispy Chicken and waffle shaped (real) potato fries, the waffle suddenly became a savory food. One I went back to, not just once but twice in the next two days. What was a potentially disastrous experiment for me, became an amazing experience!

I even tried the sugary waffle. Mouth-watering. You need to try both types - sweet and savory - when going there. Oh, and going with the combo is for sure the best choice!

Ordered the chicken strips with waffle cut fries to go. Tasted alright, nothing special. The order taker didn't seem that enthused to be there for starters.

When the food was ready it sat on the counter for a long time while the two girls whose job is to take it to the customers talked to each other about who knows what...Finally, one of them started bagging the order for me to take out. That process seemed to take longer then it should have.
The girl couldn't figure out what bag to put it in, or she was just confused about something with take out orders.
When we got the meals, the food had cooled down from the wait.
Fried food is not that appetizing cold. The Strawberry Ice Tea was flavorless...The staff all look like high school kids that weren't into it. I didn't see anyone who looked like a manager supervising anyone. I can't imagine what it would be like if the place was busy.

The prices were okay, keeping in mind that this is food being served on the strip. The customer service was very good given the fact that their drinks are refillable only if a worker gets it for you, which We never had to ask a worker once because they were attentive enough to always ask us for a refill before our drinks were empty. The one thing that everyone needs to do when coming to this place is get some of the free syrup that they offer , which is next to the ketchup, and eat that with their waffles. The syrup was definitely one of the bigger reasons we liked the place. One big down side was the fact that our French fries were pretty cold. They weren't stale, but they did feel like they were waiting to be served for awhile.

Their waffle sandwich is made to perfectly pair with the chicken. The waffle is not sweet, somewhat thin, and stays crispy. It sandwiches a perfectly tender chicken breast. Most people try the original buttermilk chicken first, but I loved the Nashville-style hot chicken. The spicy and smoky flavor is not exactly that of the Nashville chicken I experienced at Hattie B's, but delicious nonetheless. I didn't see this item offered at any of the other Bruxie locations so this may be a Vegas exclusive. 

If you're a fan of waffle cut fries, these are a must have.

You can't go wrong with fried chicken sandwiches in between waffles. 

I ate at this location twice during my trip to Las Vegas. Original spicy chicken, waffle cut fries, strawberry lemonade and their Wisconsin frozen custard- everything was fresh and so good. 

Very casual environment. You order at the counter, and they give you a gps tracker where your food gets dropped off at whichever table you choose. Inside and outside patio dining. They also have beer and wine options.  Self serve area for ketchup and waffle sauce (basically sweet syrup) and napkins. 

Crispy chicken fried in clean oil and light fluffy waffles- what a combo!

Service is efficient. Nobody stood out in an extraordinary way. I did have one woman try to clear my plate when I was still eating- not cool.

Rather, the chicken was stewed and the meat was added to the gravy made from the stew juice.  I generally avoid chicken and waffles because of that cultural divide.

I read about Bruxie when the Park was being built and I read about their menu.  It's been bookmarked for almost a year now.  Before the Cirque show at the T-Mobile Arena, I decided to give Bruxie a try.

I looked at the menu and ended up ordering the Nashville style hot chicken waffle.  The menu describes the sandwich this way--Spicy & Smoky Fried Chicken Thigh, Tangy Sauce, Shredded Lettuce, Pickles.  I also ordered an iced tea.

I was given a buzzer and told to sit anywhere I wanted.  They'd bring the food to me when it was ready.  I put the buzzer on the table and went to the area where you get napkins, cutlery, and sweetener.  One of the women brought my tea and said I could have a refill if I wanted.  Shortly after, the woman brought me the metal mini-tray with a cardboard in the bottom for liquids.  I cut the waffle in half and then proceeded to enjoy it.  The waffle was soft with just a small amount of crust.  As I was finishing the second part of the sandwich, the waffle had lost all firmness and it just melted into the food.

As long as I was here, I decided to do it all.  I ordered a dessert waffle and it was a toss up between two but I decided on the Nutella and banana.  It was a bit smaller than the sandwich waffle.  The Nutella was spread on the waffle and then sliced banana was added.  This was good.

Bruxie gives you a fast food option in the area that's different.  I enjoyed my food there.  I would recommend they turn the music down about 20 decibels.  It would have been difficult to carry on a conversation with the loudness of the music.

I might come back and try something else here.  I like the concept.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,14,3,lngi3-6Ikpx-8mBw9En64Q

It is located inside The Park, which is between New York New York and Monte Carlos. Parking situation sucks anywhere on the strip but if you are going to visit The Park,  I personally recommend parking at Monte Carlos parking garage.

There are ample seating inside. Limited outdoor seating available...but all of us Vegasians know the weather here. There's only about few weeks in a year that we get to comfortably be outdoor. Otherwise it's too cold or burning hot. 

It's nice to have a casual eating spots like Bruxie on the strip, which serves fried chicken on a freshly made waffles. I got the original chicken and waffle which came out to be exactly $10 with tax. I personally think it's overpriced for such a small portion but just about everything is overpriced on the strip so what can I say. 

I would say my chicken waffle was decent. Waffle was fresh and airy with little bit of sweetness. Chicken was crispy and went well with waffle. Had little bit of coleslaw which didn't do much in my opinion. Simple and good, but underwhelming in terms of portion. I would recommend ordering fries or other side dish if you are hungry.

So when we took a weekend vaca to Las Vegas shortly thereafter, I was pumped when I saw they had a new location on the Strip, right across from the Monte Carlo and T-Mobile Center.

The food is BOMB. I had the buffalo chicken waffle sandwich with the buffalo cheese waffle fries and a pink lemonade; all in all ran me about $13.

We were able to try the Original Buttermilk Chicken and waffles (with a side of waffle fries, nom!) and the Carolina BBQ Chicken Waffle. For drinks, we had the Arnold Palmer and Strawberry Lemonade.

With or without the sauce, the pulled pork was really taste but I would suggest drowning your waffle + meat in their BBQ sauce! When you purchase a drink, it's refillable so it's def WORTH IT.

As we stood in line looking over the menu, it was becoming more and more difficult to just pick one item as so many of their items looked and sounded really delicious. 

I finally decided on their 4 piece chicken tenders with the waffle fries and my guest go the Irish Nachos, which is Fries, Bruxie Cheese Sauce, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Sour Cream, and Chives. My chicken was some of the best I've ever had. It was crispy on the outside yet tender and moist on the inside. The flavor was also on point. Nothing I would change about it. The waffle fries were also delicious. Not sure if they make them in-house or not, but they were well seasoned with just the right amount of salt and were nice and crispy and stayed crispy the whole time. My guest's food looked amazing as well. I didn't try it, so I can't say how it tasted, but they enjoyed it. 

Just an FYI, if you are standing around waiting for your food and it's been awhile, you may need to ask about it. We waited and waited around 20 minutes and finally decided to ask about it and they had it already. We were expecting to get a number called out or our name as they asked for it when putting in our order, but we never got called. Good thing our food wasn't cold. 

I for sure will be back again to try some of their other amazing looking food.

I was late to the Chicken and Waffles party. I never had them much before. I opted for that Nashville Hot chicken waffle sandwich. I was sold on the heat of it plus a tangy sauce with pickles seemed to make a more complete sandwich than their original Chicken Waffle Sandwich (which seems to only include slaw). 

The waffle held up pretty well for the chicken sandwich. It was only near the end where the tangy sauce and the chicken proved too much for the waffle. Waffle could have been cooked a little more to prevent sogginess. The tangy sauce was fantastic touch to the heat of the chicken. Chicken was juicy and rich. The waffle sandwich runs you about $12 by itself but I was very pleased with the sandwich, plus it's still cheaper than getting a good beer in T-Mobile arena. I did eat some chicken tenders from my buddy, that was a little more of a miss. The breading fell off the tender too easily, although the chicken itself was still juicy and delicious.

The Bacon Waffle is the best waffle I've had with or without chicken. The bacon fat doesn't hit you over the head with smoke or salt, the pork fat mixes in well with the sugar and rosemary. The outside is crisp and has a crunch from the crystalized sugar, the inside is flaky and soft.

Yes, there are buffets. Or you can come here for carb overload amazingness. There are other locations in SoCal, but this is a convenient option at The Park, where there is a variety restaurants and bars by the new stadium.

Since this is the home of the original **Chicken Waffle Sandwich**, someone had to order it. It's exactly what you're imagining, except way more massive. The waffle is super thick and the chicken has a nice crisp breading.

We also shared the **Poutine Waffle Fries.** Good lord, the portion was way huger than we expected. We thought it would be a small appetizer size. Nope. The delicious waffle fries are topped with cheese curds and pieces of fried chicken (yes, more fried chicken). 

However appetizing that sounds, I enjoyed the dish Frau C. and I shared the most. The **Original Chicken & Waffle Skillet** arrived and I couldn't stop drooling. It's surprising I was even able to get a photo of it before devouring it! The chicken is breaded in a super thin crispy batter, the waffle infused with cheddar and bacon, and the whole thing completely doused in maple syrup. To die for!

You cannot go wrong with the Original Chicken and Waffle. The portion is huge and you eat that bad boy like a taco. And just like a taco, all your fillings (coleslaw & syrup) falls right out at the end. The chicken is tender and seasoned well. The waffle is cooked to perfection, so you don't have the flimsy, soggy or chewy situation. 

I don't know what the kind of cheese is smothering the cheesy waffle fries, but I need more of it in my life.

Menu: chicken, chicken, more chicken, and a waffle. You can your chicken however you like, to many options to name. I was with a fairly picky eater who opted to have his sandwich ""deconstructed"" which allows everything to be presented separately so you can decide what to add or take away. Your items are brought to the table when ready. I had the tenders/fries. The tenders were fried to a crisp perfection as were the waffle fries. They were seasoned enough to be tasteful but not over bearing. They offered plenty of accompaniments to add as well. 
Price: reasonable and fair averaging $9 per item. 
Drinks: the had a selection of beers I wasn't familiar with. I'm not a fan, but for those that are in sure this is exciting. They hand craft all of their sodas. I had the root beer which was absolutely delicious.

After our first trip to this place when my family and I visited Vegas last year, my family instantly knew that we wanted to come back for more. Located in The Park Plaza by New York New York and Shake Shack, Bruxie is surrounded by eateries but is the only place that holds the famous chicken waffle sandwich. The have seating available in the three black tables outside and plenty to fit large groups or a couple inside. When it gets busy, they give you trackers that can only go as far as the black tables near the entrance so be careful where you choose to sit. The service is bomb and are welcome to assist you with your needs right away (extra utensils), despite the fact they have a water station complete with sauces (syrup, ketchup, hot sauce) for your use. 

We came by 2-3 times (Thurs, Fri, Sat) during our trip, which seems like we wildin a bit too much but hey! Bay Area sadly doesn't have a Bruxie so gotta take the chance ): Although we mostly came back for their delicious frozen custard, we also got their original chicken waffle sandwich and chicken tenders with their signature waffle fries. 

Their waffle fries are lightly fried yet still remain to maintain that crispness you desire in a regular fry. Their servings are pretty huge so sharing is definitely recommended if you're ordering a waffle sandwich. The original chicken waffle sandwich includes a crunchy honey glazed chicken, a thin/soft yet crispy on the edges waffle, and cole slaw. You can make it a combo with their waffle fries for extra couple bucks more if you're feeling it. Their chicken tenders were large and seemed a bit too overly fried, but that's what gave it its crunchy appearance and taste. Most importantly, the chicken tenders weren't dry! For dessert, we chose their Wisconsin Frozen Custard which is beyond amazeballs. Their frozen custard has the option to be served in a waffle cone or a regular cup (which is actually a whole lot, don't underestimate the size since they fill it to the top). It's definitely mouthwatering and heavenly. I'm disappointed that the bay hasn't matched up to this greatness yet :/ 

Bruxie is absolutely worth the hype of chicken waffle sandwiches. With a open & clean atmosphere, I'd come back again (:",2ILDbEf-9M3v2f9kD01WeA,2,2,5,LeqgcRlywX-i-RK-Y0xCYQ

Park at New York New York (on a night without an event at the T Mobile Arena so you can get free parking!) Walk toward the strip. Pass CPK, pass Beerhaus (I know, it's tempting to stop there). Stand in line. Order your food (I suggest the Original). Sit down. Wait for food. Consume everything. Order more to go while eating. 
The Original: Fried chicken on a waffle (Only 250 kcal?!) Nothing fancy, nothing worth taking a picture of... But it's good. The waffle isn't sweet, just think of it as an alternative to bread. The maple syrup is on the self serve counter for you to drown your meal, if that's your thing. For me, the sandwich is a little bland without syrup. 
California Pesto Chicken: Very light, very simple. I would order it again. 
The Lemon Cream and Berries: The lemon custard was a little too overpowering for me and it made the waffles taste too bland in comparison. Save the dessert for someplace else. 
The sodas are made from cane surgar, no caffeine (except from the cola) and are worth ordering. They also serve alcohol if that's what you're looking for!

I'm a huge fan or Chick-Fil-A, but Bruxie wins with their waffle fries. Always crispy and fresh. If you like them loaded, try the Irish nachos! Cheese, sour cream, bacon. Yum.

A typical order of one sandwich and an order of Irish nachos is perfect to share between two people. Depending on when you come, the lines could be out the door or nonexistent. It's typically more busy around brunch.

Holy Chicken - Fried chicken on a waffle, with bacon, cheddar, sunnyside-up egg, and sriracha. Perfectly fried chicken, juicy with a crunchy crust. Bold salty flavors and a crispy waffle that just barely manages to hold it all together. Luckily, the wonderful flavors and textures of breakfast make this a sandwich that you won't put down.

Roasted Mushroom & Goat Cheese - Waffle sandwich with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, arugula, and goat cheese.

Wasn't sure how to eat it - hold it like a sandwich or knife/fork? When I picked it up, unfortunately all the pork fell out because the fold in the waffle was all soggy. Not appetizing. It was like the waffle wasn't cooked long enough to develop that light crunch on the outside. My friend's waffle sandwich fared a little better but I could see it was also not crisp enough.

We stopped in at probably the worst time, shortly after the naming ceremony for the new hockey team. Holy cow, they had obviously been hit hard by the crowds and the restaurant looked like it! Totally understandable for the amount of people that were drawn in by the special event. It was obvious that the staff was trying to play catch up with busing tables and getting orders out to everyone. Since it was a special circumstance I can't really speak to what the normal cleanliness would be in the restaurant or how long it would normally take to receive an order.

I ordered the Nashville-Style Hot Chicken that is served with a Cheddar Bacon Waffle Biscuit topped with Maple Butter. Wow, so much flavor in this dish. The Nashville-Style Hot Chicken was hot as promised and will satisfy a craving for spicy food for sure. The waffle helped balance out the heat. I loved the flavor of the cheddar bacon waffle with the maple butter on top. So yummy. The only part I didn't love was the crunchy sugar crystal pieces that were fine at first, but started to overwhelm the flavor towards the end. 

My husband ordered an Original Chicken & Waffle Sandwich. This was also very tasty. The sandwiches are larger than the dish I ordered so I'd suggest this for larger appetites. 

For dessert we shared a Liege Waffle with Caramelized Pearl Sugar. I think next time I would try another dessert option. The waffle was pretty good, but it was not what I expect in flavor and texture from a liege waffle. The pearl sugar crystals were large and the texture became off-putting for me as I ate more of the waffle.

Overall, the chicken is amazing and the waffles are a close second. A delicious meal for sure if you are near the NYNY or Monte Carlo.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,5,6,4,wq4-Ty0WIP8AgpZbqQUaKQ

If there is one sandwich to eat while in Vegas, it should be this one, the Original. The waffle was thin and had the perfect crisp and the fried chicken breast had such glorious crunchy breading drizzled with a honey chili sauce and topped with a slaw.  I'm dreaming of this sandwich right now.   

We ordered a side of waffle fries which were not really necessary, as my dreams were already fulfilled by the sandwich.  The homemade strawberry lemonade paired well with the sandwich (I'm acting like it's fine wine).  Plus free refills.

The only reason why this place missed the 5-star mark is their waffles.  Though they were hot and crispy, they put in some kind of sugar pellets in the batter.

I was ready to give this place a 2 star rating until we got our Nutella banana dessert waffle. Crispy waffle, chocolatey Nutella, and sweet custard and bananas...it all just worked!(and for $5.25 this is a good deal!)

There was a bit of a line and I have to say it didn't move very fast - I think there was only one person taking orders. But once we made it to the front and were given a little buzzer, things moved quickly. It was a beautiful day, so we waited at a table just outside for our food. Our buzzers actually never went off, our food was simply brought out one at a time. 

I ordered the Irish Nachos. I'm a sucker for waffle fries and these totally delivered. They were absolutely covered in cheese sauce. 

My friends both ordered the traditional fried chicken waffle sandwich and I got to have a few bites. It was delicious! The chicken had crunch and flavor. The waffle was light, crispy and savory - almost like a bread instead of a waffle. The sandwich also had slaw and honey - so good! Both moistened the waffle just a little, which made for a nice texture and balance to it's crunch.

I came here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and the line was out the door. It definitely gets busy, but the line goes by pretty fast. You start by ordering at the counter and then they deliver your food out to you. 

I ended up over ordering, typical me. I opted for the Nashville hot sandwich along with a chocolate shake and buffalo fries. I honestly loved everything I ordered. The sandwich was delicious, but huge. I ended up only eating half the waffle. The fries was great too! A little spicy, a little tangy and all delicious. Lastly the milkshake, ahhh, to die for. The perfect little dessert drink on top of the chicken and waffle goodness.

This year we ordered a variety: 4-piece chicken tender (OG seasoned w/ all three sauces; fries included), 2-piece fried chicken (1 original, 1 kickin'; bacon-cheddar waffle), and creme brûlée dessert waffle. They were a perfect combo to try a little bit of everything and definitely worth the money.

Personal insight: To me, I favored the bacon-cheddar waffle over creme brûlée since it tasted both savory and sweet (my sis on the other hand preferred creme brûlée bc she wanted all sweet). Also prefer kickin' seasoning - love the spice and caramelized sauce.

We tried the original Chicken & Waffle sandwich and the Roasted Mushroom & Grilled Chicken Salad. Both were excellent.

You walk in and you order at a counter, as you would at any fast food establishment. Once you order you are given a pager that will vibrate when your order is ready. The server brings your food to you. The servers looked like they were having trouble finding the customers when their orders were ready. They might want to fine tune the order delivery system. I would suggest having the customers pick up their order when the pager is activated.

The salad was very good. It had roasted crimini mushrooms, grilled chicken breast, sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, romaine, and arugula. The dressing was a lemon and balsamic vinaigrette.

The waffle was very light and crispy and it was folded in half with a good sized piece of fried boneless chicken breast on top of cider slaw. The chicken was seasoned well and I think I liked it with the slaw instead of with syrup. It was a nice change from the sweet syrup you usually get on chicken and waffles. Very tasty!!!

The location is convenient -- in the Park between NY NY and the Monte Carlo, with a street-facing facade that eliminates the need to hike through a smoky casino.  At 9am, Bruxie is busy but not overloaded.  It takes a few moments to place your order, grab a seat in the spacious and tidy dining room, and wait for your order to be delivered.  

I had the original fried chicken and waffle, with a side of fruit.  I was familiar with Bruxie's style of chicken and waffles from an earlier to visit to one of the Orange County locations, and the Las Vegas location is true to the rest of the franchise.  The flavor is outstanding. My only complaint: not enough crispiness, both on the waffle and on the chicken.  In my world, fried chicken is all about that perfect crisp on the outside to contrast against the softness and juiciness on the inside.

Prices are surprisingly good -- consistent with other locations, and not obviously jacked up due to proximity to the Strip.

4654872,2016-05-05,4,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,"The next coolest thing to the newest entertainment attraction are the restaurants that open with the development. Take the Park for example. Inside the month-new Park at NY-NY, there is a hot new restaurant that opened up there called Bruxie. This past Saturday when my brother and I were hanging out in the Park, we decided on dining in Bruxie. My brother who dined in Bruxie once before recommended the chicken tenders. His convincing words to get me into Bruxie were,  ""The chicken fingers are better than Raisin Cane's."" That was enough convincing. 

    Despite how delicious their chicken fingers are, Bruxie built it's reputation on waffles. The two founders Dean Simon and Kelly Mullarney turned the Belgian waffle into a grand slam ingredient featured in place of bread on sandwiches, as breakfast, and numerous items. When it comes to chicken tenders, the waffle fries are a home run that takes the taste out of the park.

    Bruxie is one of the few restaurants to be located under the Empire State Building. When I stand a few feet from the Strip at the entrance to the Park, I see the NY-NY Empire State Building rising above the storefront. With the Empire State Building as a landmark there is little difficulty finding the first Bruxie outside of California. 

    As soon as I entered the two room eatery, I ordered at the counter. I decided on the chicken fingers with waffle fries, and sugar cane cola. I'd exchange close to $13 with the enthusiastic cashier for a buzzer. I'd wait in the patio room for a few minutes until the buzzer activated. No need to leave a table overlooking the spacious room that reminded me of a park lounge because an employee delivered the food to the table. I did have to inform him that I ordered a sugar cane cola which he soon delivered to the spacious table. This leads to the tip that the staff fills the cup in lieu of a self service beverage fountain. 

    I put Bruxie distant from the price gouging category to the ""You get your money worth on the Strip."" The four chicken fingers were Big Foot size. These chicken fingers were giant and delicious just like Raisin Cane's. Sharing the tray with chicken fingers and waffle fries were Ranch and Carolina sauces. Missing was my favorite chicken side: cole slaw. The delicious cane sugar based cola complimented the food. 

   In conclusion, I enjoyed Bruxie. As far as comparing it to Raisin Cane's Chicken fingers they are tied. Bruxie left me with the lasting impression that they served me a tasty meal at an acceptable price for the Las Vegas Strip in the newest Las Vegas Strip attraction: The Park.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,9,4,jcYed5WL4vlx48cdy8Q-Jg

I came with my family and we ordered:

The original fried chicken and waffle sandwich
The waffle was cooked perfectly. It was soft and light with a crunch in every bite. Chicken was also juicy inside. It had some coleslaw inside the sandwich. Always a good choice to try for a waffle sandwich.

The original seasoned chicken tenders
These tenders are pretty big. Juicy in every bite. They also come with waffle cut fries and ranch on the side. The only problem for me was, the breading and seasoning outside of the tenders was a bit too salty for me. 

Kickin chicken tenders
Very similar to the nashville hot chicken. Had a good spicy kick to it. Juciy chicken in every bite. But it is oily..but good. 

Irish nachos
For me I don't think it is worth it. Its basically waffle fries with cheese all over and small pieces of bacon. It was ok.

First of all, parking for the Park complex was complicated for me (as is all parking in Vegas) because there is no designated parking for ""The Park"". Or at least, I couldn't find any. I just parked in New York New York, but still had to walk quite a bit to get there. (Note: Don't valet; do self-parking. Valet costs $13 here....?!?!?! Costs more than the waffles..)

The waffles themselves are one of the best! I got the Original, which was amazing! Not worth the price in my opinion, but tastes really good. The waffle fries are overpriced; just get them from Chick-Fil-A. I also got the bare waffles, which were good on their own! My mom got the lemon cream (?) and berries. It was overly sweet. I am a huge fan of lemon curd, but wow I swear my teeth were forming cavities while I took a bite. The waffles were also soggy from the curd... So I wouldn't recommend this one unless you've got an immense sweet tooth.

It's a walk up and order place, and then they bring you your food when it's ready. There is a lot of seating inside but they also have outside tables everywhere, which is really nice when it's a beautiful day. 

I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheddar breakfast sandwich. It, of course, came on a waffle and there was plenty of melted cheese on it, but what really made this so delicious , was the bacon ! I Love bacon and I find it very hard to get really good bacon out at restaurants and this bacon I could not get enough of. I was so happy with the sandwich choice, I wasn't sure if i was going to be sad not getting one with chicken , but it was delicious  and I was so full at the end. Will definitely order again.

My boyfriend got the Holy Chicken which looked just gorgeous.  It was a waffle with friend chicken and an over easy egg on top! Also is topped off with some type of spicy sauce. We made it a combo and it comes with a drink and waffle fries, which were tasty also. He loved his chicken and waffles !

Little detail that I love at this place is they have pitchers of ice water sitting out (where the napkins and utensils are). So you are able to get as much water as you need, which I appreciate this so much.

My co-worker and I stumbled upon this place as we were walking the strip after our conference.  We were looking for something that was different and was not crowded.  Monday Night Football was on TV.  As we were walking from the MGM Grand to mid strip, I saw all the 4 and 5 stars on Yelp for Bruxie.  So we thought we give it a try, we were not disappointed!  I ordered the 2 piece with Mac and Cheese.  After I burnt the top of my mouth with the fresh out of the fryer fried chicken, I was in heaven.  The syrup adds an sweetness to the saltiness of the outer crust of the chicken.  The chicken was not dry inside and the crust was not too hard.  The mac and cheese was cheesy and they use more white chesses that added a bitter taste to the mac and cheese.  But that went perfect with the Chicken.    I could not even eat all of my food.  My only complaint is that beer prices are a bit high there.  Now, I would go into greater detail but you know, the adventures of Las Vegas kinda fogged my view up.  But when I did wake up my co-worker and I were talking about how that was some good fried chicken.  So if you are looking for a spot when you are in Vegas, Bruxie will be a good option.

Bruxie's gets a solid 7.5 on my ""I judge Fried Chicken on the Yo' Granny's Fried Chicken Scale"". Here is quick break down of my ""Fried Chicken on Yo' Granny Fried Chicken Scale""  From Poppies/KFC (ugh nasty 1-4) to the midpoint (not bad, and yes this is where most fried chicken falls 4-9) to the cannot be topped Granny's Fried Chicken (a perfect 10).  I am very picky about my fried chicken if you can not tell.

I have to say that most of them were spot on.  The food was fantastic.  I couldn't have been more happy with the choice I made.  I am all about a good waffle......and to have fried chicken paired with it, makes for a great meal.  

Now as to why I knocked off a star.  When we got there it didn't seem to terrible busy, but we stood in line for 20 minutes before ordering.  There were a lot of empty tables inside and out.

So bomb that I'm making this my 100th review. Shock! 

I was surprised on how delicious this place was! I ordered the Original Chicken and Waffle. It was prepared like a waffle taco. Large thin, crispy, yet airy waffle that had a hint of syrup in the taste, a very large, super meaty, not overly battered chicken breast that was seasoned to perfection and had a tad of coleslaw. I got mine with waffle fries too, and that was even fresh. Simple yet satisfying. 

My friend got the Nashville chicken and waffles and he fell in love once he took a bite. His had the right spices to it with super large pickles in his order. I took a bite, of course and it was deflectable! He also ordered the mac and cheese but we weren't too impressed by it. Still ate it all though!! lol. 

At the end, we finished our meals with a Waffle Sundae. The waffle underneath the ice cream wasn't something to be excited about. No taste to it, sadly and it was super thick. I was hoping for some more airy, crispy waffles like what my chicken and waffle came with. That and for some reason I thought of a cinnamon waffle? Was that another option? I don't remember. The ice cream, however, was thick and creamy and you can eat it on its own. Very good!! 


FYI. If you decide to order ice cream, put it on hold so your meal can come out first. The cashier didn't tell us about that so our dessert came out first. Luckily we inhaled our food and still enjoyed the not so melted ice cream we shared. the girl who took the sundae out told us we can do that. She even offered to take it back and give us a new batch, but there was no need. NOTED! 


It did get stupid busy when we were there, but its because its on the strip. There was seats inside and a ton outside. Ordering was also quick and easy as a girl was standing outside giving people menu's.

Overall had a good experience, but it is quite pricey though as we spent $35 dollars on just a salad, nacho fries and their special chicken sandwich.  It does get busy during lunch as we waited 20 minutes for our food.  The chicken was not too dry and crispy considering for white meat.  But if you prefer dark meat, I am not so sure if this place offers it or not.  The salad was good as you got a lot of salad though and enough chicken with bacon and avocado.

4958018,2016-10-05,2,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,"Probably a 4.5 star review, but not 5.  Very strong lunch at Bruxie on a Friday afternoon around 1.  The line was almost out the door, but it goes pretty quickly.  I was with a group of friends, so we decided to share some items.  We went with the original sandwich, the Nashville hot chicken sandwich, the cheesy waffle fries, the mac and cheese, and the Irish nachos.  To drink, I got the strawberry lemonade. 

The food took about 10 minutes to arrive.  Service is great, they bring the food out to you and were very quick to pick up clean dishes or offer refills.  Everyone was friendly as well, fantastic in that regard.

Of the sandwiches, I strongly preferred the Nashville hot chicken to the original.  The Nashville hot chicken is bade with a fried chicken thigh versus the chicken breast that the original contains.  The thigh was thicker and juicier than the breast, which wasn't dry but twas close to it.  Additionally, the sauce on the Nashville sandwich was strong.  It wasn't super hot but it had a bit of heat with it.  The sauce and shredded pickles went well with it.  This sandwich was far superior to the original.

The waffles are light, airy, with a slight crispiness to them.  The syrup was very good, thick with lots of maple flavor.  I may get just waffles with chicken strips next time rather than a sandwich, they were very good.

On the sides, the waffle fries are basic and lightly seasoned.  The cheese sauce is also pretty basic, but it's good.  The Irish nachos are large, imminently shareable.  They are LOADED with toppings:  bacon, cheese, sour cream, chives.  They were good, if not a little messy.  I preferred these to the cheesy fries.

The mac and cheese is made with bacon, and you can definitely taste the bacon.  The cheese sauce is largely cheddar-based.  It was a classic bacon and cheddar mac and cheese.  The noodles weren't overcooked as well, they retained some bite.

The strawberry lemonade is sweet, but not overly so.  You can taste both lemon and strawberries as well, all of us enjoyed it.  And, if you are so inclined you can get a shot or two added to it.

Bruxie is a nice addition for The Park, there's outdoor seating and plenty of indoor seating.  I would absolutely come back on future trips to Vegas.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,2,4,4EipxRKIlTN97NRXjsP97w

This place sits out front of the T Mobile arena and the New York New York. Kind of difficult to decide where to park. You can pay the $7 at NYNY, the $5 at Monte Carlo, or head over to the Tropicana for free, but walk for a while. We opted for NYNY.

I assumed this was a sit down place. Sort of. You stand in line to order what you want, then they bring it over to you. We went about 11am, and the lunch rush was going on. The line was out the door. We did manage to snag two tables next to each other though. We had 6 people. 

The food is a little pricey for what you get. I ordered the Naked Waffles, with cinnamon sugar. It's literally 2 waffles, butter, cinnamon, and syrup. Yep, naked lol.  My husband and son both ordered the Holy Moly sandwich. My husband said his was really good. My son said the siracha flavor was a little over powering. My daughter (bday girl) was a little sad. She wanted the blue cheese sandwich,  which they no longer serve. She got the bbq instead. Hers was alright. We got two orders of Irish nachos, and a fingers kids meal. The Irish nachos were yum! They also brew their own soda, which is really original. 3 of us has the spiced cola. My daughter had strawberry lemonade, spiked with vodka. 

Waffles, 3 sandwiches, a kids meal, fries, and drinks came out to almost $90. Yowza! 

I definitely want to go back to order a chicken sandwich. I'm a ding dong and thought naked meant not breaded, so I want to go back to get something with chicken. I ma",64WaWNeYSmN45a1MdiFv5w,0,0,4,4lkXJNftFazDaIIrqrX43w

We got our sandwich shortly. It looked amazing. However I would give the sandwich 3 stars. For me it was very salty!  The chicken is fried to perfection. But the amount of actual meat you get is very little because the breading is very thick. The waffle is delicious. Crispy and slightly sweet to balance the salty chicken. I also loved the pickle and slaw inside it. Basically everything cut the saltiness of the chicken. I had to put a lot of syrup on it to balance the taste... Which is very unhealthy.

Let me put it out there, it's not cheap. It's not In-n-out or Chick-fi-la. It's like $13 for a burger without a drink or fries, but that's kinda normal in Vegas.
We got the Original, which is a chicken sandwich. The combination of light airy waffle, crispy thick chicken patty, cole slaw and maple syrup was very satisfying. Just writing this review, makes my mouth water.

Be it dripping with warm maple syrup, topped with fruits, preserves, jams, and whipped cream, or as a bun for a perfectly seasoned boneless chicken breast, spicy BBQ Chicken, California club, pulled pork roasted turkey, pastrami and Swiss, roasted mushrooms and goat cheese.... wait, what were we talking about?

Bruxie, the Cali born waffle joint has made it to Vegas.  And yes, it is as good as expected.

Outstanding, with no sweetness.  Nothing get's in the way of making a great waffle.  The Naked with cinnamon sugar or maple syrup the perfect way to whet the palate.

In general, the consistency of the waffles hold up well to the ""wet"" fillings with their outer layer maintaining the crispness.  

For breakfast, the prosciutto and Swiss, oozing with melted Swiss cheese and a fried egg, all kinds of good eats. A generous smear of whole grain mustard cuts the richness of the yolk perfectly.  Sub sage spiced breakfast sausage and cheddar and you get a solid country sausage and egg breakfast sandwich, equally tasty.

Of course, chicken and waffles.  Take an aggressively seasoned, not too heavily coated,  deep fried, crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside boneless chicken breast, give it some sweet heat (chili honey) and top it with some cider slaw.  Calories and fat aside, oh yeah!  For something that will make your head tilt like a confused dog, try the roasted mushroom and goat cheese.  Sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, arugula, lemon vinaigrette and a balsamic reduction in a waffle?  It works and well.

Friendly service.  Prices are what they are.  Expect to pay $10 for any ""sandwich"".

I kept wanting to call it Brexit. And really I wanted to take a Brexit from Bruxie because the place was super cold. They kept the door propped open during the lunch hour and we all wanted to wear our coats. Plus the music was way too loud.

It didn't improve that much with the food. The husband and I got the classic fried chicken waffle sando. If I was blindfolded I would have just guessed I was eating sauce on crispy bread. Any subtlety of flavor was lost with the sweet chile sauce which overwhelmed everything. I had hoped the slaw could have cut the spicy sweetness (and for the record I can handle spiciness) but there wasn't enough of it. I did request pickles which helped a little.

The waffle fries were good at least.

And 2 was way more than I could eat so if you are just one person I wouldn't go for 3. The butter is super sweet and mapley so don't go thinking you're going to need any additional syrup. You will not! I only wish the iced coffee options had been a bit more robust and it would be cool if they offered some hotter chicken but it was delicious as is with the chili honey drizzle! My husband got the holy whatever it's called sandwich and it was wonderful also. The Sriracha sauce was not just plain Sriracha, it was this delicious creamy substance. It was tasty altogether but looked quite challenging to eat! We arrived at 10ish on a Sunday and the line was only about 10 minutes. Friendly, fun service too!

This was exactly what we were looking for. You order at the counter, get a number and a waiter brings you your food. Quick and efficient. Light and fluffy waffles with a slight crisp to the outer layer acted as the bread for perfectly fried, juicy chicken breasts that weren't too oily.

I'm able to work remotely but the idea of staying in my hotel room all day just because I knew there was reliable wifi was a bit of a drag.

The restaurant is adjacent to a small park that provides free wifi (""TheParkWiFi""). I camped out at my table for 4 hours and the staff was nothing but lovely to me. As a server in a previous life I know that campers can be obnoxious, so I tried to keep any requests to a minimum. But a server at Bruxie went above and beyond by consistently checking in with me, bringing me endless refills, and even letting me sample some ice cream (delicious, definitely coming back for the ice cream).

I'll be honest, I had great hopes and expectations for this place, but my experience really took a turn to negative town, and then sped down that road, from the very beginning. Wanna hear more? Read on...

We got to the restaurant and the greeting was not much different than that I get at McDonalds. It was literally a ""NEXT"" cattle call to get to register. And that is when the fun started. I ordered a chicken finger meal with a strawberry lemonade and my girlfriend ordered a cobb salad with a Chardonnay. Sadly, what they call a Chardonnay on the menu, was actually a Pino Grigio (written right on the bottle), and the poorly-trained cashier kept insisting they were the same thing. I don't blame him for the mixup, I blame management. 

Anyways, we were given a pager and told to sit anywhere we wanted to and the meal would come to us. We waited for what seemed like 10 minutes to receive my lemonade and then another 7 minutes for my food. Now, I do not mind waiting for good food to be served, but I did mind waiting that long to get an overlay sweetened strawberry lemonade and food that is very comparable to Jack-in-the-Box or Popeye's chicken. The fried chicken on both plates was half seasoned, borderline burned, and on the dry,  so it was nothing to write home about. In particular, the Cobb salad wasn't good nor visually appealing... tomato chucks were too big, the bacon had a stale taste and texture to it and the lettuce was straight out of a bag (I saw them refilling their salad station when we were leaving).

Like i said earlier, I really wanted the experience to be good. So, to make sure I left no proverbial stone unturned, I also ordered their Mac and Cheese which truly looked scrumptious. Unfortunately, that was yet another let down. They serve their Mac and Cheese in a cast iron skillet...but that is only for show. I thought they baked the dish in the oven (in the cast iron skillet) to melt the cheese, but they do not. In fact, the 'cheese' was gritty (a sure sign it was made with powered cheese), a bit on the cold side and under seasoned... not good.

Lastly, the appearance of the staff for it being such a new restaurant, left much to be desired. Uniforms are disheveled, and the staff is comprised of a bunch of teenagers who seem to be running the place. Want some delicious fried chicken? Keep walking because you will not find it here.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,0,0,2,5F_1fZXEu_8C4rVaJyStsA

Hello Bruxie... the chicken from a chicken and waffle is suppose to be crispy, not soggy af and tasteless.

We came on a hot summer evening right before they closed. The staff was super awesome for letting us order 5 minutes before 11pm. What wasn't awesome, however, was the air conditioning being off. Fans can only do so much when it comes to the Las Vegas heat. :(

I ordered my usual Original Chicken Waffle Sandwich made with their seasoned fried chicken, chili honey, and cider slaw. My waffle was broken, making it rather messy to eat. That's my only complaint though since they were so crispy & fluffy like normal.

Hubby ordered a Grilled Californian Pesto Chicken, which he enjoyed a lot. All sandwiches are made with their all natural, hormone-free chicken marinated in buttermilk, mmm! We also shared a (necessary) order of waffles fries. And by share, I mean fight over. :3

Oh! I do have another complaint. We took our little guy and ordered him the crispy chicken tenders kid's meal. I was so disappointed when his plate came out with 2 small chicken strips and a few waffle fries. It was NOT enough food for a 3-year-old, let alone older kids! I'm not a proponent for prices, but $6 is a lot of money just for him to be hungry less than an hour later.

We all drank our meals with fresh strawberry lemonade. Warning: It is super tart and full of pulp! I liked it, but if you're craving something sweet, you should order one of their old-fashioned sodas made with real cane sugar instead.

Pet Peeve #1- It's an order at the counter type place. These places always make me feel rushed and uncomfortable. Even though I was the first customer of the day, I felt like I was holding things up, so I just ordered an Original Chicken and Waffle Sandwich and a Belgian Mocha.

Pet Peeve #2- Why do restaurants that work so hard to get things Crispy and/or Crunchy put sauces and wet condiments directly on them? It always turns the crispiness and crunchiness to sogginess.

Now onto the food itself. The Original has Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Chili Honey and Cider Cole Slaw. The Chicken was perfectly seasoned and the parts that weren't turned soggy by the slaw had a wonderful crunch. The Waffles were the absolute lightest, crispiest, best I've ever had. Again, except for the parts that had contact with the slaw. Even the slaw itself was very good and the Chili Honey added a really nice sweet heat to the sandwich. My Mocha was the best coffee I had this Vegas trip.

Bruxie is wheelchair accessible and the food is fantastic, so I will definitely be back. I'll just order the Cole Slaw on the side!",e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,2,2,4,DSemHNGQN5ftPCaoKpajBg

Came by before a Knights game, so it was pretty crowded, but the line moved very quickly. Grabbed a seat, and patiently waited for my heavenly waffle dinner to be served. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, but am also a sucker for an authentic liege belgian waffle, so I ordered one of those as well... and waffle fries, because how could you not?

Grilled chicken itself can be really hit or miss, but Bruxie nailed it. The waffles that make up the sandwiches are very interesting. They're not what you'd expect as a ""normal"" waffle- they are thin and airy, so they are super crispy instead of doughy. Super unique, but nothing wrong with it! The sandwich was delicious, and the Bruxie sauce on it was out of this world. The liege waffle was also everything I hoped it would be! If you've ever had one, you know how incredibly sugary, buttery, fluffy, and crispy they are. Bruxie's hits on all of those.

As a waffle lover, I cannot recommend this place enough. But even if you do not have a particularly odd obsession with waffles like I do, if you love good food, you'll enjoy Bruxie.",rQRJ4Mi2EWgNVaVWJGaG4w,1,0,5,ZgZLmGahMCKlKNjIwhZcJQ

Crispy maple glazed chicken, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, sriracha sauce and a sunny side up egg, wedged between a soft and airy on the inside and crispy on the outside waffle.

So.... with that many places to eat, we went back a couple of days later to have lunch at Bruxie.  I orderd the crispy chicken waffle sandwich and hubby had the spicy chicken sandwich again.  I even ordered some Irish nachos which he had never heard of before.  Can I say?  NOM, NOM, NOM!

Free refills, plus you can change drinks if you want. I tried the strawberry lemonade. It wasn't too sweet or too tart. Not powerfully strawberry-ish, though.

Only 50cents to add cheese sauce to their side and drink combo. This place isn't price gouging at all and I respect that a lot in sin city.

Chicken waffle sandwich was intriguing. The chicken ""breast"" appeared to be a conglomerate of mixed chicken breast pieces, tenderized and breaded in a patty shape, rather than a single breast. It was nice quality meat mostly so I didn't mind. Just wasn't expecting it. Asked for my slaw on the side and it was probably less than 1 big forkful. Not upset I'm not that into slaw.

Waffle fries with cheese sauce on the side was good.

The waffle it's self was okay. Light airy and crispy. I was expecting a bit more tenderness, TBH.

I mean, how could I not hit up Bruxie?!  Considering how much I LOVED their Irvine location, this practically guaranteed a delicious ending to my trip.  Which kind of explains why I did it again last month!  Well, that and the fact that they're just that good!

Located on the outside of New York New York, and right next to Shake Shack (also love!), it's great how this part of The Strip finally has some better food options (we wouldn't even bother before).  Thankfully, everything about this Bruxie was just as amazing as the one in Irvine.  In fact, if anything, the menu actually looked slightly better.  The range of options was the same (fried chicken, waffle sandwiches, salads, etc.), but there seemed to be more variety now!

-- HOLY CHICKEN - Maple Glazed Fried Chicken, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Sriracha Sauce, Sunny-side Up Egg...$11.95
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bruxie-las-vegas?select=qwDv2kffPT3T-7ZqPHJIgA)
Aside from how the waffle fell apart after just a few bites (it needed to be crispier), I loved everything about this!  The egg, cheese, and bacon were perfect complements and I liked the glaze's sweetness.  The star was the chicken though - crispy, juicy, and super flavorful!

-- KICKIN' CHICKEN - Spicy & Smokey, Tangy Sauce, Shredded Romaine, Pickles...$11.95
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bruxie-las-vegas?select=BvswIgx2g-M04lPohc41Zg)
Even though it wasn't as spicy (or kickin', if you will) as I thought'd be, I thought this was great!  The chicken was moist, nicely battered, and still very tasty.  What's more, the tangy sauce was awesome and the waffle was much better this time around!

For all of their waffle sandwiches, you can make it a combo by adding a side of waffle fries and a drink (with free refills) for $3.95 more.  Sure, the sandwiches are filling enough on their own, but this is well worth the money!  The waffle fries are insanely good (perfectly crispy, lightly salted) and I LOVE their Strawberry Lemonade (a little sweet, but nothing a little more water won't fix).

Despite having tried something different every time I've been to Bruxie (here and Irvine), I'm still disappointed in myself for not having tried their regular fried chicken yet!  Fried chicken & waffles dishes have failed me before (a la Roscoe's), but I can't imagine I'd have to worry about that here.  I guess I have even more reason to come back!

It didn't take too long for our order to come out and when it did, it looked really good. They were nice enough to cut the sandwich in half, but the slaw in it kept falling out. It was really salty cause of the soy sauce and it drowned out the flavors a lot from the sandwich in whole.

What is diffrent though is that they do have a small menu for beers on tap and they do carry Stiegl which is a plus! Next, they do provide a clean space with their napkins, condiments, syrup, and water cups. Finally the seating area is spacious but it won't seem like there will be a seating problem since it is located in The Park so there is a lot of outdoor seating too.

Finally it seems like they are training their staff still and I do appreciate that they did check on our table a lot to make sure we were ok.

I would rather it be in the traditional form where I can slab the waffle with butter and just pour on the syrup myself.  The chicken didn't really have that much flavor to it.

The portion of the salad is generous and it will leave you full. It's one of my go-tos on the menu every time I'm at Bruxies. :)

They have a large area for seating so finding somewhere to sit wasn't hard and it seems less busy than Shake Shack, good for us.

The same thing happened with EggSlut - last time I came to Vegas, I tried EggSlut for the first time even though there are a ton in LA!

Anywho, this time my family wanted a quick lunch and something we have not tried before, and I always wanted to try Bruxie and here we are! And here was one of the best meals of our trip or of any restaurant!

We had the $5 coupon for signing up online for their newsletter which was awesome, it's a great coupon, and although the prices are not too expensive, this makes it even cheaper!

We ordered two sandwiches - the Original and the Holy Chicken
WOW these.are.dee.lish.ous!!!

The original has chili-honey, coleslaw, and their original seasoning. The chicken is so light, juicy, tender, while the batter is also so light and crispy, thin, and just so tasty with all the seasonings. The waffle is absolutely amazing - fluffy, crispy, and airy and oh so good, and together they make quite a good size sandwich! It isn't too spicy but the sweet-spicy honey-chili is amazing.

Now the Holy Chicken . . . my god this was amazing and almost puts Roscoe's to shame with the chicken and waffle combo! 
Again, the delicious waffle, so fluffy and crispy and thin, but the chicken is glazed in maple syrup - seriously, what is better than maple syrup and fried chicken!? Thick, crispy applewood smoked bacon for some added savory-salty flavor. Thick slices of gooey cheddar cheese sticking to the waffle. A hint of sriracha for some kick, and the cherry-on-top, a fried egg cooked perfectly with the yolk running down the chicken and soaked up by the waffle!

 Seriously, thank you Bruxie for this phenomenal lunch with the absolute best fried chicken, waffle, and combination of ingredients as well as the great service for something special and perfect in Las Vegas!

Their fried chicken cut wasn't what I would usually order but they only had one kind, the boneless, mostly white meat cut. Seasoning was pretty good and it was fried crispy but it was a little dry.

The Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar waffle is nice for breakfast; you can add another egg and prosciutto to make it even nicer.

Just understand it became a concept I was open to...and then there was Bruxie which took things to another level.

Like, when I say another level I mean the top of the Stratosphere kind of level. Why not take thin, crispy waffles and fold them over to make chicken sandwiches? Why not fill them with crazy ingredients? Why didn't I think of this? Well I'm glad somebody did!

Bruxie, located in The Park on the side of New York New York, is something contemporary and cool enough to easily be found in the actual NYC (I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up there soon). I needed breakfast so what do I do? Yelp! Waffles? Chicken? Okay, that'll do.

But when I get there I don't just get chicken and waffles, no no no. At Bruxie things get interesting (in a good way). Holy chicken! That's the name of my breakfast-ish choice and it lived up to that name. Maple glazed chicken, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, Sriracha mayo, and a sunny side up egg. 

Honestly, words can't describe this thing. Okay, I'll try to use words: Sweet. Savory. Spicy. Sexy (wait, maybe not that last one....or maybe.....). Anyway, it's just everything you want when you think of chicken and waffles. Add in some waffle fries (clever) and their own brewed coffee and you'll end up with a meal that'll do you in for the day.

Overall, I'll be thinking (dreaming?) about Bruxie for quite some time. The creative and amazing tastes they concoct (and their employees were a class act too) make this place a must. Yeah, I know there are 5-star restaurants and gourmet chefs aplenty, but go to Bruxie.

Ambiance: Nothing special. It can get loud and super crowded with people waiting for tables. The place isn't large so big parties will have trouble finding seats. The tables, chairs, and stools are pretty typical for a semi fast food chain. I say semi because its not really fast food but kinda is at the same time. 

Service: You go up to order and they bring the food to you. After you are done, you have to throw away your trash. So its not too much of a sit down and dine kind of service. Overall the servers are nice and polite. 

Food: Honestly, I think I was really hyped but I just thought it was okay. We ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and 3 pieces of fried chicken (2 original/1 Nashville) that comes with a waffle. It was good but it wasn't the yummy dance good. I was ready to have the biggest foodgasm when I got my food but I think my mental desires/expections for the food really override what was actually getting ingested. Therefore I think it was okay.

Waffle fries, Bruxie Cheese Sauce, applewood smoked bacon, sour cream, and chives... it's a no brainer. Get in me!

If I have to say one bad thing, I think there were too many pearl sugars in my bacon-cheddar waffle because it became unbearably sweet after a few bites. No need for syrup.

I ordered the original chicken and waffle sandwich and requested the sauce on the side so I could try it individually with their signature sauce but also with the syrup. Note: syrup not needed cause their sauce is 100% on point! The chicken was cooked with just the right amount of crispiness and that right amount of good grease you need for this dish. Also the waffle was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just as it should be. To drink I had their cherry cola which selling point here is that everything in their store is an in house production no 'name brands' all their own unique creations.

Well, Bruxie came in to answer my query.  The menu offered many good options:  waffle/chicken sandies (thin, airy waffles), waffle/chicken skillet (which appear to be different thicker, possibly chewier waffles), and salads (the ""why bother"" option).  We opted to share the seasonal crispy chicken (How this was different from the regular?  Um, I'm unsure.  There didn't appear to be any pumpkin spice).  Anyways, it was good.  The chicken was indeed very crispy and moist in the center.  At the condiment area, you could add mustard, sriracha, etc.  I liked the sriracha the most.  I think it was b/c with the sandwich, you already had something deep fried and plopped with an abundant amount of mayo.  So the vinegary chili kind of cut the richness.  And maybe if the waffle was thicker...like the waffles they let you make at hotels...that would be stellar!

For $13 I got full and it was tasty so I definitely recommend .",DEBtkxl9RhLv7WGlHWVOJw,0,0,4,rIvOwUTZXny1yOxeIDBk0Q

5942963,2016-12-05,0,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,"Originally a restaurant from Orange, CA that has expanded greatly and now hit the strip - this is a great faster stop to get fried chicken and waffles in a fun and new location and building. Although I came in the winter cold, I suspect in the summer this place will be even more amazing once they open the garage-door style windows.

Food is wonderful, and on par with the LA location at which I've eaten.  I split the following:

Lemon Creme and Berries (Dessert) Waffle -- this is great, but tart so prepare yourself for that. It's an adorable waffle sandwich filled with lemon creme and... raspberries(!).  

Original Seasoned Crispy Chicken Tenders (comes with Waffle Fries) -- A classic fried chicken tender.  We asked for a side of the chili honey sauce to pour over as if our chicken was the original with bones... but had instead opted for the one that would be easier to eat.  The skin is crispy, the chicken juice, and finger-licking good.

Strawberry Lemonade -- Sugary, oh my.  But great to drink with the rest of the salty and sweet food we'd ordered. Also FREE REFILLS. Insert love eye emoji here.

An easy stop located on the outside of NYNY (more North from the standard entrance). Go on, you know you want to go.",H0Dq_zK4Ceepkd1KdDK7BQ,0,0,5,eoFc30qTefyFdXu3rynVTw
5942987,2017-10-29,0,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,I love this place. Perfect spot to eat before and after and event at T-Mobile Arena. Favs are the Cobb salad and of course chicken and waffles. The Palmer is refreshing plus they have cups for water if needed. Prices are very reasonable compared to most restaurants on the Strip.,DrftCOvq0Inf6fxUuuw55A,0,0,5,2zeoxR_hoojU8YvQJI4BcQ
5947357,2016-07-17,2,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,"We stumbled upon this place as we were exploring the strip. Located next to the ""Park,"" this place definitely had a presentable and inviting atmosphere. Apparently, it was a new hype that we never heard about until we got there. 

We ordered the The Original Fried Chicken & Waffle, Chicken Tenders with Fries and two shakes.

First of all, I'd like to give the disclaimer that the chicken comes out boiling hot -- which, in my opinion, is a plus! If you burn yourself, well, then it's your fault for not being adult enough, haha. I wasn't really feeling the breading too much, which is why I'm knocking off half a star. It was lightly seasoned and was a bit thin for my liking. The meat though was white and delicious. 

The waffle was delicious and was a perfect combination for the chicken; however, the waffle broke as soon as my boyfriend picked it up. He had to use a fork and knife to eat it afterwards. As for the waffle fries ... well, let's say I was very disappointed. They tasted super chewy and like rubber. I love criss-cut fries too, but these were a total let down. 

I also thought the ranch was a little watered down, which didn't go too well when dipping our crunch chicken tenders. 

Overall, this place is OK if you're looking for a quick bite. They have a cool tabling technology where you just place your beeper on your table and the staff will know where your table is. We spent about $30+ for two people.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,3,3,3,A6N-gP6YVAp04HcnEdtGnA

We stopped at this place, located at the New York New York Hotel and line was already building, so we thought ""why not!"". I ordered the Holy Chicken sandwich which had a poached egg, chicken breast, sriracha mayo and of course a waffle as the buns. 

When I took my first bite, I was absolutely amazed at how perfect the chicken was. It wasn't undercooked, overcooked, NOTHING! The meat and seasoning was ridiculously good, and the combination of that with the egg and Sriracha mayo made it one hell of a breakfast sandwich.

My only flaw was I paid 20 dollars for a sandwich, small coke and a side of fruit (that came with the sandwich). Seems overpriced as hell, but It was good.",Aj1oygrfHfqSf-HAzSpR1w,2,1,4,1sxbcbtOHsR1_nilxiJhog

5985796,2018-04-08,1,0d0i0FaJq1GIeW1rS2D-5w,"Went to Bruxie for the first time last week and I'm so glad that we decided to come back for it! Initially, we went on a Thursday morning around 10:45am. The line was out the door and we were starving so we ended up settling for Shake Shack next door. Saturday morning we wanted to try again but this time we were smart and went right before it opened. They open at 9, but they started letting people in about 10-15 minutes early!! We almost had to wait in a long line again because we didn't realize they opened early! 

Ambience (5/5) - I really like the sort of hipster feel to the place. They have really large windows that lets in sunlight and really brightens up the place. It's a very clean environment and I love that. 

Holy chicken! (5/5) - If you're a person that likes the sweet and salty combination, I would definitely recommend this! I am very picky about chicken because a lot of places make chicken extremely dry but Bruxie's chicken is definitely not dry. It was a juicy and savory piece of chicken that was maple glazed and TASTED SO WELL TOGETHER! 

Fried chicken w/ bacon cheddar waffle and maple butter (5/5) - I'm not sure if we got the original seasoned or the kickin chicken but whatever we got was amazing. Then again I am really biased because I love pairing little big of sweetness and savory. 

Bruxie Burger (3/5) - Don't get it. If you're really craving a burger then go get a burger next door at shake shack or any other places that actually makes burgers. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad! It's just that Bruxie is known for their chicken.. SO GET THE CHICKEN.. promise you won't regret getting the chicken.",Dtdlq0eAy8tfef00r5Q83w,1,1,5,iwqdL2caqzxAZUjkd7tbsA

The Hot Nashville Chicken is above all, my favorite of all time. What does it come with? Spicy & Smoky Chicken, Tangy Sauce, Shredded Romaine, and Pickles. This entree is down to the science. Spicy, savory, crunchy, yet soft and then sweet from the syrup. If there's anything better than this meal, please don't tell me about it because I'm pretty much adamant about this. 

The service is fast despite the crazy long lines, and there's always a place to sit even when, again, it's busy.

My friend and I discovered Bruxie after leaving the NY NY hotel: None of the restaurants around the casino area really stood out to us. While walking towards the strip, we decided to give it a shot. I scanned the menu and was happy to see there was a burger available for me to enjoy. I chose the Mac and cheese instead of fries.

We sat down by one of the huge open windows facing the busy strip. When the server brought out my burger, immediately I was confused because I didn't order a waffle. Suddenly it hit me that even the burger was served atop waffles. I gave it a bite, and was very happy we chose Bruxie to have our last Vegas meal. The Mac could have been cheesier, which is my preference, but I was relieved it wasn't bland. I've noticed that happens at restaurants so often.

The cheese to patty ratio was on point and the waffle was crisp on the outside yet airy. It was a good balance for the beef. Definitely a win!",7U3H1iJZ04FbadJtt2Npjg,1,2,5,VeDQUH3MsvMU2V3FzqdAiQ

We parked in the garage near by and walked along the little area of shops, restaurants, and bars. I thought it was cool how clean it was and how it didn't really make me feel like I was in Vegas. 

When we got to the restaurant there was no line so we were able to ask all the questions we wanted to ask. The cashier wasn't rushing us and was very friendly. 

We ended up getting the chicken and waffles, chicken sandwich, and Nutella banana (suggestion of the cashier). Everything was delicious. We both loved how tender and juicy the chicken was and the Nutella didn't disappoint.
