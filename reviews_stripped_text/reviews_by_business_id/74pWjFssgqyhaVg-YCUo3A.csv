We where seated as soon as we got there and server was nice and the food was so good! My adventurous friends got the monte cristo which was good and I got the Mexican skillet for my messican self and it was perfection.

54959,2017-03-18,0,74pWjFssgqyhaVg-YCUo3A,We had a very disappointing meal this morning. Blueberry pancakes were very dry (to the point of being very crumbly) and did not have any flavor. Banana chocolate chip pancakes were not much better and they forgot to put banana in the batter - served them on the side. Potato hash that came with eggs was very soggy and flavorless. Scrambled eggs were just OK.,BEuZkkbR2Bs9NXdJbHXm8w,0,0,1,OT_skZN8gDkg4M4i0k4AOg

Had a weird experience at the Cheyenne location. Being younger, I assume that my server assumed me being young meant that I would tip her less than 20%. That was not the case as she ignored me my whole experience. I took it up to the register and the problem wasn't addressed. I got a measly senior discount. Though I appreciate a discounted check for a mediocre experience, that doesn't change anything.

Also noticed that their is an option between COFFEE CAKE or TOAST..

She insisted on just asking me what kind of TOAST I wanted. I didn't want TOAST. I wanted COFFEE CAKE and as a returning guest, I let her know that. 

Other experiences at the location have been awesome. As well as the fe visits i've paid to the ANN location.

268739,2017-04-16,0,74pWjFssgqyhaVg-YCUo3A,"We were looking for a close brunch place after Easter.  This was near by and had good reviews.  

Staff is friendly and made us comfortable.  Had a couple items that came out wrong and they were taken care of promptly.  

Overall the food was ok.  The menu is extensive and the combinations sound interesting, but none of us were won over by our meals.  Presentation is lacking, which is overlooked if the food tastes delicious, however the meals were a bit bland.  I had the Enchilada Omelet with hash browns and the coffee cake.  The sauce seemed simple and possibly was a store bought sauce, nothing stood out.  There was a fair amount of chicken and plenty of cheese, but wasn't what I thought it would be flavor wise in the end.  Hash browns were ordered extra crispy and weren't made that way.  They returned them to the kitchen and came back perfectly crisp.  The coffeecake was a nice portion, but not what I would call ""coffeecake"".  It was a chocolate chip cake about three inches high with a drizzle on top.  Kind of crumbly, but good flavor.  I'm just used to a more traditional denser cake with a heavy brown sugar crumb on top.  

I asked the rest of the group what they thought and they all kind of said their meal was ok.  I would eat here again if nearby, but wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",qcq3M_-rABSfwW7eD7_kQw,0,0,3,qA4w-557-SQ2X_aFj_jG9A

I ordered the enchillada omlete which had a scant amount of chicken in it, had a generic tasting diiluted enchillada sauce over it with sliced pepper jack cheese slices not quite melted on top. The tortilla chips were missing as was the green chili the menu promised. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak which was a pre frozen mystery meat  Pattie with gravy that he said was just ok. I guess for the high dollar amount for this meal,  Dennys is a better option. We have eaten at other Cracked eggs and have never walked away unhappy. 
Walking to the register I noticed a customer's coffee cake.. it was very yummy looking, it even had struesle on top, ours did not. I asked the girl at the register about it and she said, snickering, ""yeah sometimes they come out good other times not so much.""

So one day on a whim & the fact that I was starving, we ventured down here on a Sunday, fairly early I might add, so the wait wasn't too bad. 

It was still pretty busy, which is always a good sign ;) 

I perused the menu & finally decided on the Sweet potato skillet, however, I opted for ham instead of bacon. It was definitely interesting. Sweet potatoes, green apples, muenster cheese, ham, grilled onions & an egg over easy to top it off, with a side of coffee cake as well. 

It was pretty good, considering the sweet potatoes could've been seasoned a little better, nothing a lil hot sauce couldn't fix though ;) I would probably order it again. The coffee cake was super moist & delicious too, and I'm not a huge coffee cake fan either.

My Eggs Benedict was not good, at least not worth it for the price. They were tasteless and the Hollandaise was watery, not thick and creamy. Ended up throwing most of it away.

Their prices are a bit much, especially on such simple items.

Although, I ate some of my fiancee's S'mores French Toast with Nutella and it was amazing. And huge portions as well. They had some really interesting menu choices that ARE worth the price.

The food was very good, not spectacular but very good.  I had the Big Bad Wolf omelet, and it was properly named.  Packed with heart-stopping meats surrounded by the omelet it was really fit for a wolf.  The hash-browns were good too, but I had to let most of them go just to get the omelet stuffed in.  Being gluten intolerant I didn't eat the coffee cake, which my wife said was good as well,  And my cake gave her a second one to take home for later.  She also had the chicken fried steak which she really enjoyed.

The negatives and reason this is not five stars is that there was a fair wait to be seated.  Luckily it was a nice day and we could sit outside on the food-court seating.  Inside waiting is minimal. I admit we are slow starters, and came at the peak hour, so maybe if you are an early riser there might not be so much of a wait.  Also, being full and the seating closely set it was rather noisy inside.  I am not the first to post the ""no WiFi photo"" but I have posted it again to bring it to the front because their admonition to talk like it's 1995 was being followed with gusto.  

Still, once seated the service was quick and the staff was very friendly and most helpful.  And that often makes up for any bumps in the road.  

And fie on me, I am so used to eating around my gluten intolerance that I didn't ask if they had a gluten free menu, which I discovered after I had eaten my fill.  On the other hand, I did mention it and the gluten free menu wasn't offered.  Next time I will ask.",gKFbnx-0dYcc-jzDVckbVg,0,0,4,u4386S8uO9VMczREXBKhJg

The server was almost useless and probably colors our opinion of the food. She was more interested in saying ""no"" than in saying ""I will be glad to do that for you"". She says management prohibits substitutions. I never heard of a breakfast place not allowing a swap of toast ofr pancakes.

We came on a Saturday morning about 10 a.m., so it was prime time, but despite that, we were seated within five minutes. The service was great, with someone taking our drink orders right away and the waitress following up soon thereafter. The menu covers the basics -- omelets, scrambles, skillets and griddle items -- with everything customizable to your liking.

Our drinks came out promptly, and so did the coffee cake that came with my girlfriend's scramble. You'll read about this coffee cake in other Yelpers' reviews, and with good reason: It's warm, soft, slightly gooey, and positively designed to make you crave coffee, as good coffee cake should.

The rest of our food was made perfectly to order, and while not the greatest food ever, definitely solid. The seasoned potatoes could have been a bit more seasoned, but then again, I compare all to the Egg & I's potatoes, so ... sorry, Cracked Egg. ;) Our water and coffee were kept filled and our check came promptly.

It's because the food is consistently....awesome!

On my most recent visit, because I have been slow-carbing it since the beginning of the year, I opted for a few simple things.  I ordered up a water, avocado, and jalapeño bacon. There was some confusion as to who ordered up some coffee,  I figured I would take because I knew the coffee was good to go.

The avocado (1/2) slice was fresh and delicious.  The bacon....spicy and all that is bacon.  $10....with tip....whatever.

Not my first choice for breakfast.....certainly not my last...When I have to go as a group to TCE....I am game, but only if it's under my own optimal conditions.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,4,2,4,h58nioWPco1EltmKpFUyoA

& a Denver omlet , which she kindly let me substitute sausage instead of ham. ( im 8 months pregnant & picky ) 
Both came with potatoes ( hash or seasoned , we ordered one of each)

I ordered coffee cake.
Two waters & one soda.

Best I've ever had. Seriously so moist & sweet. Loved it. I would go back just for the cake. 
Prices were fair. More or less IHOP type prices. ( but the quality is much better) 
Our total was 23 dollars & change. 
I have nothing to complain about. 
I didn't hear one complaint from any customers around me. I find that rare , I always here someone at least say, ""oh you forgot this"" but no everyone was on their game!

They care about the restaurant and seem like a big family. If your server doesn't bring you a coffee refill, someone else will. 

To anyone that thinks Babystacks is better: the village must have lost an idiot. We went to Babystacks this morning.  It was horrible. The seating is very uncomfortable. The staff is all young and seem very inexperienced. The food was subpar with a higher price tag.  Would never eat there again.

The servers are always friendly and very attentive. Also, food comes out in very good time. Coffee and water is constantly refilled. And paying at the end of the meal consists of going up to the register.

The omelette or scramble choices here are pretty good. Do not ask for soft scramble! My eggs came out pretty runny when I asked for them not to be. But for next time, I know not to ask for soft, instead medium scramble.

The coffee cake here is to die for. I usually get a slice of it and it comes out nice and hot. They also have variations of the coffee cake from week to week.

Fresh broccoli, mushrooms and spinach sauteed and served over the Cracked Egg's signature seasoned potatoes - topped with two eggs over easy. I requested no cheese - and didn't miss it at all.  So fresh and so good!  

One thing I was happy to see was that the wait was much shorter than I remember for a Sunday - about 10 minutes. I have a feeling that's due to more breakfast options opening in the area.

The coffee is strong, the service is great, and the food comes out pretty quickly and hot! 
I love that there are not so classis breakfast options with peppers and chilies. A huge variety of omelets, and of course some basic eggs and bacon as well. 
On my most recent visit, I went with the special on the board which was a fried French toast with berries. Literally, the BEST French toast I ever had! I devoured all 4 thick sliced and was STUFFED! 
My daughter got one of the specialty French toasts on the menus, and hers came with 6 slices. Not sure what the difference was, maybe because mine was the special. Either way I am not complaining at all, both were excellent! 
I feel like the staff has all been here for a while, and they got it down well! I also love that some of the dishes are names based on the surrounding neighborhoods. (North shore/South shore etc)

The wait wasn't too long here, we waited a good 15 minutes on Sunday - Mother's Day to be exact. 

We ordered:

The Cracked Croissant - $10.75 we love buttery croissant breakfast sandwiches, so this was a definite for us. We chose sunny side up eggs and the runny yolk was rich and delicious with the sandwich. We also chose the sausage patty and a side of soggy hash browns - I'm thinking of asking them to make them well done and crispier next time. Overall I really enjoyed this dish. It was simple, but everything combined made for a great (expensive) breakfast sandwich. 4/5


Cakes & Eggs Combo - $8.50 I chose sunny side up eggs (comes with 2), bacon (comes with 2), and substituted the regular pancakes (comes with 2) with the Coconut macadamia pancakes (comes with 2) - bad decision.

The sunny side eggs were fried to perfection - both eggs had an extremely luscious and runny yolk. The eggs were very sweet and fresh. I wish the bacon was crispy, it was rather soggy. 3/5 

Now onto the pancakes, they had an extra cost to substitute them ($1.50 or so) for the coconut macadamia pancakes. So not worth it! Although the pancakes were fluffy, they were also very dry. The pancakes had the faintest coconut flavor (actually, I barely tasted it) the ""coconut flavor"" was more like a prank. It did have dry coconut flakes, which was not texturally pleasing and only 7 small pieces of macadamia nuts throughout the entire pancake! It sounded better on paper than what was actually brought to the table. I wasn't satisfied or happy with these pancakes - they were a lie. 1/5

It was pricey for what we ended up getting. My favorites were their sunny side up eggs and the sausage. You can get that anywhere!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,2,2,3,oVyYqBziQEhS5uUm6302-A

My bro-in-law's coffee cake came as an ""appetizer"". I had a piece. I was so cakey, moist and warm. And it had some kind of fruit it in...cherries? Who knows. It was fabulous. I also tried my niece's chocolate chip pancakes. Yum. She was also a happy camper.

Up popped Cracked Egg.  We were already in the area anyways, and reading all the great reviews, we decided to head on down.  

Much shorter wait ... about 5 minutes.  Still nice and busy.  Kind of a random strip mall to be located in - almost industrial looking ... but then again, considering it seemed most of the restaurants outside the strip seemed to be in this kind of environment, I think that's just how Vegas rolls? 

Ambiance inside was nice, however, and the servers were super sweet and helpful.  The three of us girls were starving so after a thorough gander through the menu, my friend ordered the Veggie Benny (Vegetarian Benedict since she hates Canadian bacon), I ordered the Country Benny (because my fat arse really wanted some gravy), and my other friend ordered the Croissant French Toast.  Got to choose from either hash browns or seasoned potatoes.  My friend asked the server if they made their own hash browns or if they came from the frozen industrial stuff.  Unfortunately it came from the frozen variety, so we opted for the seasoned potatoes.  Luckily, the seasoned potatoes are delicious - so no sacrifice there!  We also ordered ourselves some orange juice and coffee.  Came with your typical diner - accompaniments (half & half creamers and sugar).  Considering all the crap that's in that weird half & half, we decided to ask her for some milk, instead, and luckily, she was super cool about it :)  

My country benny was very good...super fulfilling, too.  Wish the gravy were just a tad more flavorful - it was a bit bland for country-style gravy, but hey..I'm a gravy sucka and as long as it was smothered on my biscuit and sausage, I was still a happy girl.  All in all, I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to eat here again, but would definitely not be against it if we happened to find ourselves out round these parts.",gokkWEFKps8211I68N_kzA,3,1,4,vYd5DngIuLgE-ncyqQYuDw

I got the Country Benny which is biscuits and gravy with poached egg. It was really good but I couldn't finish it. I would have liked a little bit more gravy to compliment the amount of biscuits there is.

My beau got the Carnitas omelette. It was pretty good. Only complaint is that the vegetables (onions, bell pepper) needed to be cut in smaller pieces.

The parking lot illustrated  that there should not be many to warrant a busy occurrence such as answered calls. So I found myself walking in to place my order in person. From there, everything  went without a hitch.  Food was made so very timely and there was more than enough staff to accommodate my phone order. 

I don't like writing bad reviews so when I do experience less them 5 star service,  I include as much detail as possible. There was nothing wrong with their phones because a test call went  right through while I waited for my food to arrive and my earlier call was mere 40 feet away.

I had the sweet potato and apple skillet which would've had potential if it were a) seasoned even a little b) someone had enough knife skills to properly dice an onion.

After a short wait, our oder came out.....their portions are enough to feed two people!  I wish they offered a 1/2 order.  Oh well, I did my best to finish this thing, but it proved to be too much for me.  The combination of Peanut Butter and Cream Cheese was awesome!  It was so good I didn't need any Syrup or Butter added to it.

There was so much to choose from. But I simply went with scrambled eggs turkey sausage and hash browns and wheat toast. The wait was about 15 minutes. I Requested my eggs scrambled medium.

Let me first start off, my eggs were a bit still watery which threw me off. My turkey sausage was really dry, and I do wish my hash browns was cooked more, no crispness or browning on the hash brown. It was a bit depressing. I still ate it all because I was hungry. 

Breakfast is so simple to cook, how could you not know how to hit all the right points on it. I'm not trying to be mean, probably it was just busy and it got hectic in the kitchen, sh*t happens.. But

And I love, love, love eggs!  It's the world's most complete animal protein.  Bodybuilders and Meatheads alike know...if you want more muscle, you must eat more protein!  I'm far from my early 20's when I used to add a raw egg or 2 to my daily whey protein & creatine shake, or eat 6 hard boiled eggs daily to help 'bulk up'...but I still love me some eggs early in the morning!

The Cracked Egg if you can't already tell is a breakfast-heavy joint.  They are usually only open daily for breakfast and lunch.  It's been voted 'The Best of Las Vegas' by the LVRJ at least 3 times.  So I figure instead of making my own breakfast we'd go check this place out.  

The day we went it was packed!  Of course, it was a Sunday and church was probably just letting out.  There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!

Menu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.

The Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's ""Breanne's Basics"" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In ""Eggs With Attitude"" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  ""The Benedicts"" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the ""Fluffy & Folded"" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  ""Sin City Skillets"" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is ""From the Griddle"" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.  

The Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.

Only gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.

This morning my hubby ordered the veggie skillet (seasoned potatoes, shrooms, broccoli, spinach & tomatoes , eggs) & added corned beef.  I had the California Omelette (avocado, bacon & jack cheese) with the skillet potatoes.  

My omelette was fine.  The bacon inside was not cut up causing it to be a bit more difficult to bite into without taking half the bacon in a single bite!The potatoes were perfect-no grease what so ever! My hubby was pleased with his skillet but was slightly disappointed that it took forever to get his coffee (which is not worth the $2.00 price). 

Given how busy the place was, service was good (even with the lag in coffee).  We also had an $8.00 coupon sent to us by that Cracked Egg making it a good deal.

From start to finish, I thought that the servers and check out was easy as can be.  As for the food, I decided on trying something different since I wasn't a huge fan of their skillets in the past.  This time I decided on their Cracked Croissant.  This is their breakfast sandwich that consist of a huge buttery croissant, eggs your way, choice of cheese, and choice of meat.  I had this with turkey bacon and let me tell you, this meal way to start the day.  My croissant was so big that I ate it with a knife and a fork (my favorite utensil).  The sandwich was buttery, tasty, and even had enough macros to satisfy my daily needs. Trust me...unsure of what to get here?  At $10.95 with hash browns, try their Cracked Croissant.  

PS:  Only issue was with their hash browns.  I wanted it cooked extra crispy.  They dropped the ball on this one, but my croissant more than made up for it.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,7,7,4,KA2p9v9gAsXIqo45EtzzpA

The Cracked Egg is our new ""go to"" place.  If you're there before 8:30, then you have a good chance at no wait but after that, it starts to get busy.  I  have had many things on the menu but my favorite is the pork chili verde omelet.  It's got tender pork, cheese and a green chili sauce over the top and it's full of good flavor.  In addition, I have tried both potato options (hash browns or seasoned potatoes) and the seasoned potatoes are the choice of champions.

Overall, I have always had a good meal here and the wait staff is very nice and attentive, even when it gets busy.  However one thing I don't like is having to take my check up front to pay rather than dealing with it at the table.  Sometimes it's pretty crowded up front and the wait just to pay is the down side while if they took care of it at the table, I get to wait and chit chat with my company instead.",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,0,0,4,ZJWvWxvI9XVkHjLkVFQ5cQ

Okay so why 2 stars? Honestly the service is mediocre at best.

You're not closed yet so don't act like you are. ""Shit where are the bussers"" is what one guy said in response to most the booths needing to be bussed. We watched staff eating then handling fresh food without washing their hands. I'm in the industry... That is a basic guideline to not spreading your germs. I'm not looking for 5 star service but just some professionalism. One girl literally was spinning a coin on the counter the entire time and then dropping it on the floor over and over. It was really annoying... 

I hope that they can tell the staff to act a little more professional so we don't have to feel like we are interrupting their break everytime we dine there. It ruins the experience and it's happened so many times I had to write something.",wumGR88hKlOin5c8Ubsfrw,3,0,2,tTGaMPXJlmgq7f_QSzFCJg

Eggs any style, sausage/bacon, hash browns and pancakes.  Everything that makes breakfast wonderful in one serving.  YUM!

For brunch, you have got to get the Monte Cristo sandwich.  It is a ham, turkey, and cheese club made with French Toast!!!!  Yep, you heard me right, French Toast.  I absolutely love this sandwich.

The lunch menu is great as well.  My husbands dreams about the tuna melts, my daughter demands their chicken fingers, and I usually grab a burger.  So far, everything I have tried has been tasty and have not been disappointed one bit.

They also have a membership program that you can sign up for free.  Once you are in the system, they will send you an $8 off coupon every month.  The coupon has no rules except you have to come in, simple as that.  So sign up for the club and start getting coupons.  The club also gives you a $10 off check for every $250 you spend.  Don't you just love coupons?

With tons of variety so that everyone in your group can find something to eat, makes the Cracked Egg a great place to visit! The staff is always friendly and makes you feel welcome.

Not only do they offer unique breakfasts that no one else does, but it's always very fresh and tasty. The other thing that's really awesome about this place is that they pay attention to small details. 

If your order something that comes with salsa they make sure to heat it up for you so your eggs/breakfast won't get cold. And when you order bread without butter they don't make the mistake of putting it on there.

Another thing that I absolutely love is that they offer Gluten free bread or muffins if you can't have gluten, which is the case for me.

And every time I've been here I've never had a problem with service. Every waitress is friendly, fast and efficient. They always go out of their way to make your experience super awesome.

I've been to cracked egg twice so far. the first time it was slow and the service was even slower. the 2nd time i went it was busier. and the service was still terribly slow. 1) never took our drink order. 2) went straight to food order cause of long wait. 2) forgot my coffee cake 3) forgot my to go box. 4) forgot my to go box. AGAIN. proceeding long wait.
it is a bad sign when your waitress has to apologize to you every time she approaches the table. YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG. 
side note: i did get the same waitress both visits. 

had the PB stuff french toast. SUPER DUPER YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!! if you're looking for something sweet savory and all around goodness. this will hit the spot. its heavy so don't expect to be productive the rest of the bad. pair that with the coffee cake and its game over. nap time. i could only eat half.

also had the corn beef hash. quite good as well. i felt like they were filling the giant platter they brought me with potato though to use as a filler to cover up the plate. i didn't like the additional semi mashed potato added to my corned beef plus the additional side of potatoes/hash browns. that's a little potato overload.

okay. granted the terrible service might be due to a terrible waitress. it still put a damper on my experience. their lucky the food is good or i wouldn't come back.",hkHkvgNklP236_fs4d9iCQ,1,0,3,ZI1hSV3mnl6dsFhwXEIoRQ

I ordered my usual the Northshore Scramble which has tomatoes, grilled onions, bacon, Jack and Cheddar cheese, with sour cream on  top. It came with seasoned potatoes and I ordered avocado on the side. It was good as always especially on top of the buttered sourdough bread. The seasoned potatoes also had a good flavor and they were not salty. 

My husband ordered a Tuna Salad sandwich with a side of fries. They accidentally gave him fresh fruit but when they found out their mistake they also gave him  his fries. I had a bite of the sandwich and the tuna was really good it had a ""zing"" to the taste. 

I like the location of this Cracked Egg because it's inside a little mini food court that has a Starbucks, Subway, Gyro, and Pizza place.

4506559,2010-05-24,6,74pWjFssgqyhaVg-YCUo3A,"What is with the residents of Las Vegas? Do they actually LIKE to pay good money for a mediocre Breakfast? 

On the menu...

Joe's Scramble (** $9.75) Three Eggs scrambled with seasoned Ground Beef, Spinach, Cream Cheese, Scallions, and Jack and Cheddar Cheese.

Before arriving here, I performed my due diligence and read the many positive reviews on Yelp, and how the Scrambles were described as ""HUGE"" (not my description...) or ""Hearty"". 

I was really disappointed when I saw my ""Joe's Scramble"" heading towards me... The Scramble part of the meal only took up a third of the eight inch plate... the rest of the space taken up by what the restaurant described as Seasoned Potatoes... and, BTW, the portion of Potatoes were not HUGE, either. 

I always felt that a restaurant should name an Entree what the primary flavor that the Diner would taste first... and in this particular case... it's the huge amount of Cheese that is layered over the Scramble. A LOT of Jack and Cheddar. This entree is a Cheese Scramble, for sure.

It would take a Forensic Scientist to even find the Ground Beef or the Spinach! And in this particular entree... I really felt that the meat was not all Ground Beef... Tasted like Beef and some other kind of meat.

The Country Potatoes (*** 1/2) was pretty good, but very small portions. Do you know how a Scrabble (the word game) Tile is shaped? That's the size of each chopped Potato with Seasoned Salt added during frying.

Coffee Cake (*** included with meal) Very sweet... But, I have to ask... When did a Coffee Cake have a Jelly Filling?  This really surprised me... never, ever had a Jelly filled Coffee Cake before.

Coffee (*** 1/2 $2.00) Unlimited re-fills.

And then... I received the Bill... Over $41... My mouth dropped in amazement! I looked at what I ordered... the two people that accompanied me (my youngest son and his future father-in-law) and what they ordered. With the tip included... this is as close to a $50 meal as you can get! And, take my word, this is NOT a $50 buck meal! No way, no how!

I asked my youngest, who ordered the Homemade Ground Beef Hash ($10.95) how he liked his Breakfast... He said the Mary Kitchen Hash found at Supermarkets was better than Hash in his meal (and, BTW, he's a Chef!). His comments are not part of the eventual rating...

The Future In-Law had The Cracked Croissant ($10.25)... No comments from that side of the family... I stated that the next time he would visit the ""Big Valley"", that I'd take him to some 5-Star Breakfast places vastly superior to the Cracked Egg... and some that served authentic Joe's Specials. For the rest of you... just search my reviews for Joe's Specials...

Apologies to present and future Family Members for dragging them here...

To aid this restaurant... here is a recipe for Joe's Special I researched on the Internet... notice how much MORE Beef there is... and the amount of Spinach... hint, hint..

Joe's Special

2T Olive or Vegetable Oil
2lb lean Ground Beef
2 medium Onions, finely chopped
2 Garlic Cloves, finely minced
1/2lb sliced mushrooms
1 1/4t Salt
1/4t ground Nutmeg
1/4t dry Oregano
1/4t Pepper
1/2lb Spinach, rinsed, stems removed, and leaves chopped (about 4 cups)
4-6 lg Eggs, lightly beaten

1 Heat oil in a wide frying pan over high heat. Crumble in beef and cook, stirring often, until browned. Drain excess fat.
2 Add onions, garlic and mushrooms; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes.
3 Stir in salt, nutmeg, pepper, oregano and spinach; cook for about 5 more minutes. Add eggs. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, just until eggs are softly set.

No surprises with the food and the wait, even though they were very busy was only 10 minutes. The service here is A+. The food? A+. 

Another added bonus is that its only minutes from the casa. If you make a habit of coming here every weekend, it will be a very expensive habit at $30 a pop.

5260156,2013-12-02,0,74pWjFssgqyhaVg-YCUo3A,"We just decided to try this place yesterday morning. We were so impressed that we came back again this morning. That says a lot, in my opinion.

Most of the food is very, very good, but I want to start things off by mentioning the one dish that caused me to drop this from a 5 to a 4 star review: the coffee cake. I'm not really a big cake fan, but after reading all of the glowing reviews, I decided to give theirs a shot. Any quality it might of had was instantly and unforgivably overridden by that distinct, tell-tale taste and texture of a microwave! What the hell? A microwave? Yeah, sure, that's the kind of taste-deadening, corner-cutting, smoke & mirrors crap people expect from a Taco Bell, but not at a place like this. It was really disappointing and, being the first dish out, a rather disheartening first-impression too. I've read people's reviews, where they talk about how ""steamy"" and ""fresh"" it is, but the steam is artificial and the ""fresh"" appearance is completely false. At least to anyone clever enough to understand that, unless you time things unnaturally well, no cake is likely to ever be served ""steaming fresh"" at a restaurant, that is. Considering how good and legitimately-fresh the rest of the food is, this approach really, REALLY baffles me. Trust me, guys, your cake would be so much better if you a) cooked several batches a day or b) just left it room temperature and honest. Microwaving your food is flat-out insulting to your business and your customers. I thoroughly enjoyed both of my meals, but I wouldn't step in that cake again. Really disgusting bullshit! Get it together!

Beyond that, everything else tasted fantastic (thus the 4 stars)! I simply detest eggs, so I order my meals without. Yesterday, I had the ""Mexican skillet"" and, boy howdy, it was great! The chorizo and salsa were an awesome compliment to the already phenomenal potatoes. I see myself having this same dish again quite soon. Today, I had the country fried steak and it was, honestly, one of the best I've ever eaten. The steak was tender and juicy and the breading was crisp and well-seasoned. Really, really good stuff. I will also be having it again soon. My wife had the biscuits and gravy, which she said was really good, but not quite the way she likes them. Then again, she apparently had that particular bar set quite high when she was younger. She also had the huevos rancheros, which she said was excellent. 

Also, both days, the staff was quite friendly and helpful, though I do wish people/servers would understand that ""water"" doesn't mean ""water with lemon"". I know this is apparently standard practice at many restaurants, but I personally think that, if someone orders just ""water"", you should probably ask if they want a strong-flavored fruit wedge submerged in it before just automatically adding it. Maybe that's just us, but much like with every other single aspect of my dining experiences, If I don't specifically ask for something, I DO NOT want it. Simple enough?

With all of that being said, there really isn't any question about us being repeat customers here. There are some problems, but the staff is pretty friendly and most of the food is absolutely phenomenal.",J6Jz3UXH1oab79JShMaLGw,0,0,4,D05PX4Hq-oR9UP5RwkOW3A

Seriously, two people could split an omelette or a scramble and get by peachy.

That's right folks, The Cracked Egg presents hearty, diner-style food at reasonable prices. Sure, you might not have unlimited champagne, bloody mary's or mimosas... but the flavor of the food here can't be beat. 

My party of 4 was thoroughly pleased... I had the special, which was some sort of grilled chicken with spinach and mushrooms and cheese on sourdough bread. The chicken was succulent, not overdone but not underdone. The sourdough was toasty and firm (not soggy from sitting too long). The mushrooms and spinach tasted fresh and coupled with the cheese provided a great flavor/texture contract. 

My dad had the South Shore omelette... he actually finished everything. That's a good sign for him. 

Other diners had the Carnitas Omelette and Eggs Benedict. 4 thumbs up from them. 

Service was great, never had to ask for more coffee or water. Atmosphere isn't sexy or trend-setting, but comfortable and fitting. The bill was reasonable... about what you'd expect from any diner in the country. I'd definitely go there again!",UEPG6AafC_CWDLCDEfLy2A,3,1,4,Kg8gjtgAOCO89cvqLSEBrQ

- Choice of seasoned potatoes or hash browns. I got the hash browns.
