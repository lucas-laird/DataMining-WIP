If you want a great sausage (many varieties) they have you covered as well check them out",gJhzYU76x7-U23jODY-MRQ,2,0,5,vJ544arqs4dvvRnBoyeBQQ

1234672,2014-08-31,0,9avLLw9uke50m8qO9doyMQ,Second time I've had their food. And I can honestly say that it is some of the best pierogis and polish sausage dogs I've had.,B1I9y4AV4LSdj1OOwNGmyw,0,0,5,SCxmj3dCE8rUd0rtwEKf2Q

Either at the Atomic Bar at Fremont  and 9th for late  night or Banger Brewery at Fremont Experience for 3pm and later crowd. All homemade, handmade sausages with tender skin and awesome flavor.  Ate one Italian and one beer brat with super caramelized onions, mild kraut and mustard and then ordered another beer brat as couldn't get enough. The wife also ordered cheese and potato pierogis with onions and sour cream and they were delicious. Prices were reasonable and owner was extremely helpful and shared information about the food and history. 

Atomic Bar location does not have seating except for in the bar but easy enough to take to go if do not want to hang in the bar. 
We ate standing up chatting with the owner and were just fine!. 

Owner, Jerry, mentioned website would be coming soon as well. Highly recommend if you are a fan of sausages or brats!

Returned on Monday to the Banger Brewery location which I liked better as at Fremont street and has seating. Ordered a cider and Pepsi from the brewery and enjoyed one beer brat (our favorite), one polish(good flavor but less tender), one hot dog (great flavor, tender) and pierogis which are awesome even before you add sauteed onions and sour cream. Super friendly and appreciates the business! Will be a return stop every trip to Vegas. I added his Twitter account to follow to get updates, and can check Facebook for Banger Brewery add well. Definitely recommended.",5fgpl1OZb-ks7dzBuXu3fQ,2,1,5,GH6v2LDvPQAUrIQHF7NJ4Q

2507205,2014-08-23,3,9avLLw9uke50m8qO9doyMQ,"I am beyond enamoured with this man's food. He makes everything with loving attention, precisely to order, always fresh, and always quick. I typically order a polish sausage with caramelized onions, warned sauerkraut, and his nice brownish mustard and it is served on a pretzel bun. It is like heaven in a bun. It is, in fact, so good that ""Like A Prayer"" came on the radio at the exact moment I took my first bite out of my first ever King's Sausage. God and Madonna obviously approve.
His peirogis are equally fantastic, and served with some caramelized onions and a generous dollop of cool sour cream. I have always gone with the classic potato and cheese filled but he does usually offer a special one or two other.
This is the best value available for downtown eats on a weekend evening or late night. He could also possibly save you from a regrettable hangover by filling your belly with polish delights. Delicious.",P35whJ9z0__HUjfSrRmIww,5,3,5,sCT4mRO8d1aWcyAhSeHLaQ

The potato salad is phenomenal and so is everything else he makes. If you have to eat at one place in Vegas, find this guy.

Hand stuffed beer brats, polish dogs, homemade potato and sour kraut pierogis, and my FAVORITE: a habanero sausage that has just enough kick to be perfect.

4386022,2014-08-11,1,9avLLw9uke50m8qO9doyMQ,"You will read many positive reviews here so let me just say these two things:

1. The burgers are as good as or possibly better than the sausages.  I recommend you try several burgers and several of each of the sausages and make your own determination.  For me it's a mood thing, but I'll tell you what, the burgers edge out the sausages lately.  (The pierogi are delightful as well, if you're extra-hungry or can share I say add on an order of those, you will be quite satisfied).

2. Jerry himself is a hoot.  He clearly knows what he's doing and he's an interesting character from whom you want to purchase food no matter how many pints you've consumed.  From Poland by way of Chicago... more street cred than Abe Froman if you ask me.

So there you have it.  Swing by Atomic Liquor or now visit the Velveteen Rabbit on Sunday nights (Check with Jerry on his current and future schedules) and check out some of the best burger/sausage/pierogi action you'll find in Vegas.",-hJ9Q0OSYqdOTVBLOMdg7A,3,1,5,oT6crDH5T2rzZKeZg3orFQ

Pierogis were better then any I'd had (not Polish myself) with strongest endorsement from those who's first gen family made at home. The Golipki (stuffed cabbage) was also yummy. Jerry was engaging, smart and has enticed us to come back for beets. 
This was WAY better food then big Polish festival in Milwaukee.",JzwPA3NpUaLFCZOqlkZ1Ww,0,0,5,vIIGY8LBof_bCLoIgsOYUg

We contemplated getting more food but we had just eaten, so we just got the Pierogi with Potato. 7$ for 5 nice sized pierogi, he even gives you a side of sour cream. They were very tasty, I've eaten ALOT of pierogi in my life time (yes, I'm Polish and have every joke out there!). These weren't the best but they were darn good.

Try this place. Inexpensive, friendly, delicious and authentic. We are here because of a personal recommendation. 

He sets up a station (VERY CLEAN) outside the entrance of The Atomic Lounge. Worth the shirt walk. I felt safe coming from The  Fremont Street Experience.",FSYnVoJVN_6f7MsHlpQKyg,3,1,5,AJTABv5phU3veKGGjaqveQ
