Waitress was very pleasant but food was very disappointing. Had the chicken Caesar salad and wife had club. Her frys were over seasoned and sandwich was short of mediocre at best. The grilled chicken on the Caesar salad tasted like tuna also was tuff and dry O.o Unless your hammered shit drunk and can't physically go anywhere else safely. Hell, I'd just go without, if I knew before I ordered, what I know now. Golden Nugget on Fremont St is really slippin to allow this poor of  food quality to be served in their hotel.

They the took care of me after that. If that happened in the first place I would given them more stars. Sam the manger and mark took care of us after that. I guess we were just lumped into the rest of the late night style crowed. Next time I stay here I will try another restaurant but they did take care of us after we we complained.

293911,2014-12-17,0,X075p7boJU1j1JNHUj5UQQ,"My boyfriend and I found this place on a whim. We were staying at the Fremont and wanted a place to eat. 

Food: It was really great. They have a specific vegetarian and gluten-free menu, which is hard to find in Downtown Las Vegas or on the Strip. Their fried shrimp almost tasted like tempura, which I really like. The vegetarian salads is a big portion, which is the first place that gives a huge portion for a vegetarian plate. 

Price: With all things considered, (delectable food, great service, no wait time, decent ambience, and good location), I thought the price was reasonable for us. It wasn't overly expensive.

Location: It's located inside the Golden Nugget, near the pool/mini aquarium. It's walking distance from any hotel in downtown/near Fremont Street.

Wait Time: We were seated immediately, which was really surprising.

Service: I really liked the service. We weren't rushed, ignored, or constantly bothered. It was the right amount. One thing I especially liked was that our waiter didn't pick up our final signed (tipped) check until after we left. I really hate when waiters pick it up when we're still sitting down and talking. Different servers presented our food, but they were also friendly.

Ambience: It's not too loud. It it next to a bar. We went at a time when the bar wasn't busy, so we didn't have to deal with obnoxious loudness. I would imagine if it is crowded at the next door bar, then it was be really loud. It is somewhat dark, depending on where you sit. You can see your food, but it is dimly lit. There are TV screens around that play ESPN. 

It is also clean and well-maintained. The tables were clean and not sticky. I didn't use the restroom here, but I would imagine it would be clean.",Ze1Orsu3ndyr2A2tGHEH-g,2,0,5,KtZ1cmCywXmwML9MOtjJoQ

The portions are huge so I easily split the Tri Tip Dip  and added a salad to be perfectly pleased. My grandparents each ordered a breakfast and were less than satisfied with the meal for the price.

The service was awful.  Plain and simple she was one of the worst serves we have ever had. She didn't know if they had Italian dressing, she took forever to get our drinks, and she asked us 3 times if we wanted ketchup before bringing it. She never came back to ask us how the food was...if she had we would have let her know that they gave my grandmother scrambled eggs instead of fried (a different waitress brought us our food and when we pointed out the mistake she said she didn't know anything about it and we'd have to talk with our waitress when she came around).

The place was convenient and that's it. Too many other good places to go in Las Vegas to waste a breakfast here.",A6xA_wHkrmW_pM2oc7Yj8w,1,1,2,q0OciziBgSM0y1YaY8aWjg

He delivered our drinks noting how fast the apps were and chuckled about it. Then took our salad and entree order. After a while we get our salads and start eating. Not more than 2 bites in we get our entrees delivered. The food runner apologized and asked if we wanted it in the window to keep warm. .. ya right.

We were not greeted by any of the wait staff or management that passed by several times without a single glance in our direction.

Our livers were already in danger, why not throw some grease on top of the fire. I'm sure if we, my boyfriend and I, had been mature, sober adults, it would have been a more mature dining experience, a têt-à-têt.
But that was not what we wanted. We wanted drunk and low brow and to have people text shout at us on periscope. And, bless them, CJ's did that for us.

The service improved 100% over last time we were here. The food is decent, not great. Maybe my tastes have changed but it seems that the onion rings (a big order, certainly enough to share), have become mostly breading... Where's the Onion? Fish and Chips also have too much breading on the fish, and may have been cooked in oil that was not hot enough (too greasy).

It is convenient to eat here if you are staying at the Golden Nugget, but other than that is is just somewhere around average in quality and expensive for what you get.  The service is better than the food.  The portions are OK, but not at all what they used to be.  Dinner flavor was better than breakfast.  If I had had breakfast first, that would have been the last visit to Claim Jumper.  The Motherlode cake is pretty much the same, but the portions of other desserts were smaller (and no Ideclair).   The omelets are definitely not omelets ... they are overcooked eggs made like a pancake then folded and stuffed with toppings that aren't that great (like undercooked cold broccoli).  Because the toppings aren't cooked with the eggs, they fall out.  You find yourself chewing doggedly on your omelet-like egg pancake, not because you want to but because you paid $15 for it and are hungry.

It was a big portion but it made up for the Boca burger I had the night before.  Waitstaff was otherwise ok and occupied with other tables.

Our server Tammy recommended the French toast, Country fried steak and eggs, and the Scrambler. Decisions! Huge selection to choose from.  I usually listen to the servers' recommendations because they know what's good! Actually ended up trying a few other things too, and the portions were huge. Claim Jumper is known for their large portions of comfort food and great service.

So my family and I are guests at the hotel this restaurant is located in and decided to have dinner since it here. Ordered a pot pie for myself and for my brother he wanted pasta. So the first time the server came out and said that they ran out of whatever pasta we ordered and recommended us another pasta so I let that slide. The wait time is ridiculous as well so we wait a little longer. AND the manager comes out and tells me that the pot pies are over cooked basically INEDIBLE so they offered to give me the menu so I can order something else but seriously I'm done at this point we've been waiting over half and hour and only had the garlic bread as an appetizer. So I just cancelled whatever order for myself. The food comes out and it honestly was just no. The blackened Atlantic salmon that was recommended by the server was SALTY AS FUCK. Even with the lemon on the side. And the calamari wasn't even crispy because of how much oil there is with the breeding. Smh the worst kitchen and I honestly wouldn't come back I'm pissed ridiculous but I'm nice enough about it to not say shit bc it's the holidays.,mfyqmfLpiLeNTwbGW9Tg4A,0,0,1,Isid556Aj_D-CJNAmX9fuQ

Frankly it is the best location I have ever been to and this one recently opened inside the Golden Nugget.  They have all the usual fair including the full racks of baby back ribs which are my favorite.  John S was my server the day I came in.  I placed my food order as soon as I walked in and spent some time browsing the drink menu which is probably the opposite of what the staff is used to.  However, I was starving and saw no point in drinking on an empty stomach.  John was more than happy to comply.  I ended up ordering the full rack of baby back ribs with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.  I also ordered a small caesar salad and a belini which tasted quite good.

Their service is awesome.  I walked in at dinner time and was seated right away.  A food runner brought out my caesar salad within 5 minutes of ordering.  Another food server also brought some bread but I asked them to give it away because I wanted to lay off the carbs.  The drink came 5 minutes after that.  And then after probably another 5 minutes, the ribs came.  These guys really brought their A Game because I am used to waiting almost an hour for my food at the locations in California.  As soon as I finished up a plate, someone walking by would offer to clear it for me.

The food is of course tasty and filling.  The drink was scrumptious.  John rang up my order in no time at all.  Honestly, I was probably in and out in 30 minutes - which was totally fine by me because I had 10 hours of Electric Daisy Carnival to head to.

Did I mention that they are in the Golden Nugget?  Of course I did!  But you know what is really awesome?  You can get anything on their menu sent to your room for room service for like $5 more!  I know, crazy right?  Why settle for boring hotel fare when you can eat Mongolian beef and brocoli!

He returned with the drinks and an oversized croissant as a starter. The bread was really fresh and incredibly buttery. Yummy. I ordered the chopped Cobb salad. The portion they brought was humongous. All of the ingredients you usually find in a Cobb salad, only more so. A very large amount of eggs, bacon, avocado, sliced turkey, tomato, bleu cheese crumbles, and more. I got a bleu cheese dressing on the side. The portion of the dressing was also large and filled with chunks of real bleu cheese. I came in hungry and this was still way more than I could finish. My wife got a hamburger and a side of fries. Each was prepared exactly the way she ordered and she said was excellent. The only negative to the meal was that the noise level in the restaurant was quite high and made conversation a bit difficult. Was this gourmet dining? No. However, this was a perfect informal, inexpensive place to dine before a show with excellent food and really good service.

I got the chicken pot pie and asked for a Caesar side salad, and he told me ""no, that's too much food."" Excuse me? If I want an appetizer sampler, a salad and a pot pie, and share a stuffed baked potato with my husband, I will. I now am forced to live in Trump America, so I might as well order gluttonous amounts of food and dare everyone around to judge me.

I told him that was fine, I wanted the salad. I had to repeat it three times before he RELUCTANTLY wrote it down, chuckling about so much food.

When the appetizer platter and salad arrived, the woman who brought it out tried giving it to another table.

The platter was lukewarm, at best. But tasted fine.

The salad was good, albeit warm, and not as monstrously portioned as I'd been led to believe.

I watched him wander aimlessly between tables, with a confused expression. I wondered if he was having a stroke.

We wanted to play Keno, so my husband waved down the Runner. We watched the Runner walk to the table next to us and take their ticket and start to walk away. Only when she glanced over her shoulder did she see my husband waving his ticket. 

Our food came after this. Salad and appetizer platter totally eaten. Loaded potato was lukewarm. My pot pie was the only food we ordered that was the proper temperature. 

Seriously, the food was subpar, and barely warm. And Mr Magoo would.not.stop.hovering. So, I began writing this review. My soda was empty for 30 minutes, while my husband had a carafe brought to him.

Then Mr. Miyagi had to go and we were introduced to Lurch, the 7 foot waiter, who would assist us. And placed the bill on the table. We weren't done eating ffs, and I'd have wanted dessert but it wasn't even offered. 

Finally asked for a refill.

Lurch has come to the table no less than 5 times in 15 minutes to bother us. Didn't even ask if I want my pot pie boxed up to go.

For the record, because this matters, I worked 13 hours overnight, as a nurse, and was starved and wanted to have good food and sit. I was insulted by being told no, I was ordering too much food. I'm 5'7 & 135 pounds. And again, spent 13 hours on my feet, burning energy. 

My husband is 6'5 and could snap Lurch in half.

We may have eyes bigger than our stomachs. It's our decision to buy more food than we can eat. Trump embodies that right to overindulge and ya'll wanted that so don't try to dictate my life.

I'm trying to be fair with this review and to not focus on my second experience, which was a solid 1.5 stars. So, starting from night number one (a solid 3.5 star meal), I think it's more than fair to level off at a three. Too much math? Ehhhh...

My first piece of advice: Order the mozzarella sticks... that's all. Hell, order two servings. They're delicious. 

Second piece of advice: Do not order the spaghetti and meatballs. The menu shrinks down to a limited selection after 11:00 PM and the pickin's are slim. Frozen meatballs, overcooked noodles and a canned sauce - definitely not mom's S&M. 

Third piece of advice (to the restaurant management): Please don't sit customers (us) at a table three feet away from a man that is shampooing the carpets.

We arrived on a surprisingly busy Monday afternoon, around 3 pm-ish and were seated by the hostess right away. We had already looked at the menu online and done our homework and knew what we wanted, so when the waiter took our drink order, we ordered our meals as well. We both ordered the Top Sirloin 9 ounces. ($20.99, 7 oz. is available for $19.99). For the side I chose mashed potatoes, while my friend chose the baked potato. 

First, the positive..

- the steak was good. Obviously, the most important part of the meal and I'm glad that they got this right. 

- drink refills were taken care of in a timely fashion.

Now, the rest...

- the mashed potatoes tasted like crappy EDR, instant mashed potatoes. Seriously, something was off about them. Actually, the mashed potatoes at my EDR taste much better than this slop, so I take that back. 

- Had to ask for straws for our drinks, ketchup, and A1 Sauce repeatedly. The straws and A1 were delivered in adequate time, but had to ask 3 different people for the ketchup and was almost finished eating when it finally arrived/.

- After leaving, we read on the website that we should have received a choice of soup or salad as well. That simply never happened. 

For all the good things I had heard about Claim Jumper, this was certainly an underwhelming experience. I can honestly say, with so many good dining options in town, that I will not be back.

Bacon/Eggs/Hash browns, Oatmeal w/ fruit (Enough for two people), Egg Benedict, and Chicken Fried Steak.

I was impressed with the chicken fried steak, it was friggen killer. 

Service was fantastic, we had the same waiter the first two times and after that my mom made sure to request him by name and he would serve us even if we were out of his area.  He did a fantastic job on very busy shifts.  We were sure to tip him out accordingly :)

Service was on point. Staff was helpful and in good spirits. 

I left with a piece of lemon cake to go. Excited to try it. :-)

4157078,2017-06-18,1,X075p7boJU1j1JNHUj5UQQ,"Worst Claim Jumper ever!!! First, the waiter was slow and incredibly inattentive; I had to ask for silverware and napkins which given that there was almost no one else there is just absolutely inexcusable. Then, my husband asked for crackers with his soup but never got them. I asked for ice tea with no lemon, but got a lemon and no refill in anything resembling a timely manner. The only good thing about the Widowmaker hamburger I ordered and that was edible were the two onion rings. I had to ask twice for extra mayonnaise and ketchup and it took awhile for those to arrive. Two of the four pieces of bacon were woefully undercooked while the hamburger, which I ordered medium, was so overcooked that I could have used it for a weapon and severely injured my neglectful waiter. The menu said nothing about the hamburger having dill pickles - and really, with avocados, ugh - and when I went to remove the pickle I had to reposition the avocados and it was obvious that removing the pickle wasn't going to help; the entire bottom bun was drenched in dill pickle juice and it covered the taste of the avocados. It even contaminated the string fries next to the hamburger so they tasted like dill pickles. There was so little cheese I almost had to hunt for it and saw only hints around the edges of the hamburger.

I asked for the manager who took about three minutes to arrive and was totally disinterested in the fact that my cheeseburger had no cheese, there was enough dill pickle juice to squeeze into a small jar and whisked the plate away before I could tell him about having to ask for silverware and napkins or that my waiter sucked. He asked if I wanted something else but didn't apologise for the terrible food or, of course, the even worse service. The only time the waiter was prompt was with the bill; he hovered until I got my card out, took it and brought it back in 30 seconds. He brought the bill without asking if we wanted dessert so good thing we didn't want any!

I hadn't been to a Claim Jumper in 15 years and I definitely will not be returning to that one. Unfortunately, it seems my favorite dish there, a fabulous pot roast, has been taken off the menu so I doubt I'll go back to any of them. The portion sizes seem the same: massive. The prices would be reasonable for good food and if quantity over quality is what you want and you don't mind shitty service you'll probably like this place. Otherwise, try Vic & Anthony's, they're both inside the Golden Nugget after all.",6RLju8mIyc8W8hbBJimTig,1,0,1,GOs7H4k3HYl0DD-Oc6dC-g

Let me tell you about the best steak I've ever had. Aged beef, seared to perfection, and it just melts everywhere in your mouth. No chewing necessary. Found here. 

Anyways, I highly suggest this place if your in the area. It's a great addition to the Nugget and Fremont St.",aQn4Tqwef2yeb4Y9jezKxQ,1,0,5,N4JXXHy1StBQK5mAGSRbiw

I had the Ore Cart which included Tri-Tip steak, 3 BBQ Ribs and I had some shrimp which was substituted for the chicken. The steak was flavorful and perfectly cooked, the ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious and the grilled shrimp was one of the best shrimps I've had in a long time. 

On top of the excellent food I have to mention our waiter, Luis. It's rare to find a waiter who doesn't say 'no'. I first asked about a substitution for the chicken and he went to 2 different managers. My ice tea was always full (tells me he paid a lot of attention to our table). When I asked him about changing the channel on a TV, he didn't hesitate and went to get me the remote. He really made our dinner very enjoyable.

This was no different, but my first time for a late Breakfast on New Years Eve . I had the eggs benedict and my husband had pancakes. He got 5 huge fluffy cakes and had to request extra syrup as there wasnt enough for the stack he got. I ate one of his and it was great. 

My benedict was perfect and hash browns were just crispy enough.  I took away a star as I had a side of fruit and was a little disappointed that it was just melon and grapes. Would have liked a little more assortment.

My husband had the Jumbalaya Pasta and he said it was really good. The sausage could have been more spicy but my husband really loves his food spicy. There were 5 shrimp, nice sized and not over cooked.  He also had a cup of the Steak Chili as his starter

He enjoyed that chili and told me that the next time he wants to have the stuffed baked potato with the Steak Chili.  So it must have been good!

My mother and I had both had a cup of their Clam Chowder, which is still yummy as on our previous visits

We had the Club House Sandwich.  I really liked that garlic aioli, however my mother thought it was strong.  Keep in mind that my mother is 82 yrs young and her taste buds have been changing as she's gotten a little older.

We both loved those shoe string fries

The only time we get to eat at Claim Jumpers is when we're on vacation in Las Vegas.  We normally go to the one located on Charleston, on our way back from Redrock but since we were at the Golden Nugget we decided to eat at this Claim Jumper

We had a late lunch so it was not crowded at all.

This is were my biggest complaint comes in:  The service was horrible!!!

My husband asked for iced tea, the server said that they only had Tropical Iced Tea.  My husband asked what was in it.
The response:  I don't know, just order it

I was about to say something but my husband squeezed my hand to signal me to bite my tongue. 

He did go ahead and order it and he said it was ok.

We got our soup and our server advised us that we would have a different server going forward.

Our food came but we were still eating the soup.  So the new server had to move things around to put the plates on the table.

My mother had hot tea and she had asked for more hot water.  

My husband asked for hot sauce

Server said he would bring it right over.  

He was helping other tables, going back and forth, so we waited.  

I noticed a bottle of hot sauce on an empty table nearby so I got it for my husband

We had finished eating and there was still no hot water

So I got up and walked all the way in the back and asked for the hot water

They acted so offended that I came to get the hot water.  I told them just give me the hot water.  A different server refused to give it to me and insisted that the hot water would be brought to us.  

I didn't think it was a problem to go get it but they made it seemed like I committed a felony.  So this really made me irritated.

Our server brought over the hot water a few minutes later

He then had the nerve to grumble to my mother about the food left on her plate.  I told my mom to ignore him because I could tell by her expression that she felt bad.  She ate half of her food and for us that is a good thing.

At this point, my husband got upset so he left only a $3.00 on $69.00 tab

Having worked in food service my husband normally tips 20% but this guy was just straight up rude.

We will eat at Claim Jumper again but not at the one in Golden Nugget

We will go back to the one on Charleston since we've always had great service from them!

The meat was so awful and ""chewy"" that I was unable to swallow it and had to (literally) spit it out of my mouth to prevent choking on it.  The waitstaff did remove the plate and brought me something else.  But, of course, by the time I received my food my companion was finished with his entree.  They did take the tri-tip off the bill and charged me for my  replacement dinner.  We thought that it would have been more thoughtful and more professional for a manager to acknowledge what happened.  In fact, it would have been nice to have been offered a salad or appetizer while we waited or, perhaps, a complimentary dessert.  But this is Las Vegas.

Once we were seated, we had what I would deem the best waitress ever! She was just so friendly! It really just started the mood off right and put a smile on our face how nice she was.

We were kinda bummed because we didn't want her to go but told her to have a good lunch and gave her a great tip! 

We also played keno while we were there. One of the ladies seemed pissed she even had to come to work and the other Keno lady was so friendly!

Asked the server when he handed us our food if dressing was on the side as we were planning on walking a couple blocks back to our hotel. He says ""yup"", trusting this didn't check and get to our hotel and it was soggy drenched salad . Even if we were to have eaten at restaurant we would have asked for the dressing on the side and basically he liked as he was probably the one that put it together himself. He forgot our bread had to go to kitchen to ask for it after waiting ten min. He already had our money so I guess he didn't care about us getting our bread . I would have loved to include his name but we didn't get a receipt either apparently for the $43 27 for a vege burger, baked potato and soggy salad . Won't be back . The only reason for two stars was when I walked up to kitchen to ask for bread a very nice bald guy asked if he could help me and when the server said it wasn't ready he stated it's ready I'll be right back and went and got it for me .

5502550,2015-08-05,0,X075p7boJU1j1JNHUj5UQQ,"First, a little back story.......
I have fond memories of eating at Claim Jumper a decade and more ago, before it changed ownership.  I remember extra large white plates full of extra large helpings of delicious food, garnished with lettuce and an apple.  Portions were so big that I had a guaranteed left over meal for the next day.  Oh, the Ore Cart and Whisky Chicken..... Claim Jumper used to be a very enjoyable experience, a special meal, one of those places you looked forward to dining at! 
   Well, times changed and Claim Jumper was sold to a large restaurant conglomerate.  We watched the portion size shrivel, we watched the menu selection get smaller and smaller, and we said goodbye to pretty plating with lettuce and an apple.  The quality of food and overall integrity of the original Claim Jumper theme eventually changed so much that we wrote off the chain completely. 
Enter Las Vegas, August 2015.......
  On our most recent Vegas trip we found ourselves in downtown around dinner time, right next to the Golden Nugget.  I rely on the Golden Nugget as the nicest downtown Hotel/Casino.  As we strolled through the Casino looking for dining options we saw a sign for the Claim Jumper.  We decided to give Claim Jumper a nostalgic visit for dinner.... 3 adults and 4 kids.
-It's very busy and seems to be the obligatory ""24 hour cafe/restaurant"" of the Hotel.  This is not necessarily a bad thing..... Grand Lux Cafe at Venetian / Palazzo is owned by the Cheesecake Factory....and it's terrific.  
-Service was friendly and just fine
-The obligatory bread plate was a big doughy mess swimming in butter.
-The shrimp pasta should have been called pasta soup since it was sitting in a 3/4"" deep pool of melted butter and oil.  My kids took one bite of the shrimp and declared that they would not eat it because it tasted like chemicals.  My kids love grilled shrimp.
-Grilled chicken salad was on par with what I expect from a fast food restaurant.
-I ordered the Loco Moco which is hard to mess up.  White rice, hamburger patty, fried egg, gravy.  It was just that, and it was fine.
-Overall the food was pretty bad, I will NEVER return.

The Claim Jumper you knew as a kid is dead!  The only thing left from the good old days is the name, which is the only reason why customers dine here.  If this restaurant was named Jimmys Diner it would be empty.  It's sad that this once famous name has been dragged through the mud and tarnished beyond repair.

A funny side note-  As we were walking out of the hotel after dinner I bumped into a colleague who was staying at the Nugget.  I told her we just finished having a terrible meal at Claim Jumper.  She told us that she'd dined there the previous night, ordered the shrimp pasta, sent it back and left the restaurant without eating!",38u6Umpnj9s4QobruUH0nA,1,0,1,n4spJAtEJl8WSyWdRR-nbg

I called in the order for a chicken pot pie and a plain classic cheeseburger, added bacon and comes with a side of shoestring fries. The gal that took my order was super nice and told me it was a 10-15 minute wait. My boyfriend went down and said that the gal he interacted with down there was super nice. The order was ready at the timed promised and the order was correct. 

My pot pie was as big as my face! It was sooooooo yummy! I could barely eat it, I only ate about half of it before I got full. It had lots of big chunks of chicken, potatoes, peas, carrots, mushrooms, onions and the delicious creamy sauce. The crust was flaky and delicious! I was in pot pie heaven!!! It also came with a fruit cup, but mostly cantaloupe,  two grapes and three honeydew pieces. Wish it was more mixed up rather than more of one fruit over the others. 

My boyfriend's burger, according to him, was really good. The fries on the other hand were too salty for him. I tried the fries myself, and the fries were pretty salty. Perhaps ease up on the salt or just let the guest salt them themselves. 

Overall, I would order from here again if we were staying at the Golden Nugget (see my review, was not very fond of my stay there).",9AkgCftyMxFkLdwlcdDjBw,0,0,4,0nTlVnf_EVIYefuyB0vzaQ
