If you want okay Caribbean food go to Danna's Caribbean Grill. authentic flavor, ""Tostones"" Authentic ""Cuban Sandwich"" ""Empanadas"" this is the only place to be..",gYtxuSC5nmQ0vadpHufU-Q,1,0,5,5mTM5pu21J5LXfN_tTf9Tw

Only downside is eating in a shared space with 2 music systems blaring-not much ambience. I'll be back!",WiLIJpiNz3j_LkEVZWRbEg,1,0,4,8DAlAChseM7xHluKiyKRiA

Both times, I ordered the stuffed tostones, once with beef (ropa vieja) and once with pork (lechon). Not sure which was better, but they were both great. For $8, you get five big pieces of plantains topped with meat and cheese. More than enough for a meal! And on my second visit, they added a tasty side of garlic aioli, which gave the pork an extra kick.

I can't wait to try other items on the menu, especially the garlic-achiote marinated chicken breast and the Cuban sandwich (although the latter has salami on it as well as the traditional pork and ham; not sure how that's gonna taste!)

Not the greatest ambiance, because it shares its dining area with another counter-service joint, but the food is fast and fresh and overall delicious! Glad to see Caribbean food represented so well in downtown Vegas.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,0,4,mFCSmUxxH9oIWMb435EByA

And for it to be conveniently nearby is a plus.  They do still have a small menu of the Caribbean grill.  Their Maduros is one of my favs when I'm in the mood for sweet bananas.

This place is hit or miss.  I tend to come here when I'm in the mood for chicken.  I've ordered the grilled chicken wings a few times and chicken tenders which I think is alright.  I've had their Asian Chicken Salad which I wasn't impressed with the way it was prepared and the price of it. 

Today, I tried the Sweet n' Sour Pork.  So I pictured that my meal would be full of pork with rice and noodles as of I were placing an order at Panda Express.  It had a similar concept, but I didn't care for how the salad was in the same container.  For the price of $7.99 which is close to a two item combo at Panda, you'd get the same deal, except the salad here is your second item which I don't think anyone would really want to pay that much for a small side of salad which they don't put enough salad dressing.  Which is one of the reasons why I didn't enjoy the Asian Chicken Salad I ordered in the past for $12.99.  

With my meal, I asked if they could do half rice and half chow mein and they said they could.  I took a fork twirled with noodles and OMG, it tasted like the noodles had been soaking in soy sauce or something salty.  The rice was salty too but tolerable and edible enough.  I did enjoy the sweet and sour pork though.  I wish it came with more for the price.

A few of the menu item prices, I think should be reevaluated. 

So with all that being said, happy eatings!",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,1,0,3,-5sUprmCL53w12s485JYEA

The fries were good too. And the prices are really low. I am very pleased.,RwbQvEN2WoFOhMjLnIY3ug,2,0,5,A_anPOtASpUFemuPFD30fQ
4227090,2016-11-02,4,BoofbNU85LCG3pm9vpzk1A,"I ordered the beef empanadas and beans/rice to be delivered. The beef empanadas were great, but I was really upset at the fact that the beans/rice had pork in it. I don't eat pork and on the menu it didn't say that it was made with pork so it was very upsetting because I didn't realize until I ate some of the beans/rice. They need to really list all the ingredients because I just wasted my money because I can't eat it.",chBQlXXCXr91jSNa8L8QhA,0,0,2,vnUeOWBmAcaE14U27MDbNA
