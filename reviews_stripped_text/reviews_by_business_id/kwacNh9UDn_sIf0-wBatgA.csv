I guess the word, ""Buffet"" never appealed to me, I guess. I was overwhelmed by all of the many different food choices, and I ended up having some pasta w/ Alfredo sauce and some fruit. The pasta was cooked just right, and the Alfredo sauce was bursting with flavor. The grapes were huge, and I found myself trying to eat more, although I was full. The only thing that I wasn't terribly thrilled with were the pastries. I don't know what they put in those things, but it sure ain't sugar. I'm not saying all of the desert was bad. I mean, the sugar free cherry pie was good. I liked the food, but I'm not sure if I liked it enough to go back there again.",JJd5zmYBUGDtLwMDSr4Gvg,0,0,2,6S11QQv9koxW0HbLPwH_zA

They definitely need to prepare smaller portions given the lack of demand or mix it up on a daily basis. Darn good burger and bun for lunch, I swear they must use authentic sauerkraut for the hot dogs, my digestion definitely kicked it up a notch after munching on some. Prime rib was good, pork loin as well, pizza was overdone and flat. Excellent pastries and ice cream options, freshly cut pineapple as well. The greek salad on the other hand took a bit of a nose dive since the last visit, tasteless olives and wimpy cucumbers. Pepsi products being served a big minus, Champage brunch for $12,99 sat/sun a plus, given it includes the previously mentioned Prime Rib.

My husband was here for a conference, we decided on the buffet because I was so hungry I figured I would be sure to find several things I would like here. I could not have been more wrong! I was so sad I could have cried! 
They open at 11am, we arrived around 12:30. I figured the food would be hot, fresh & in abundance. But it was NONE of the above! I wish I had gone around and taken pictures, but honestly, I was just way too upset to do so. My husband only had limited break time before having to get back to his conference so I forced myself to find something that could hold me over...I reasoned with myself - there are starving children in the world, at least this is ""something"",  it was only $10,  I can make it work for the moment.
The pictures in the album are so misleading!  On our visit, nothing was labeled(except some of the desserts) so you really had to guess at what everything was. Additionally, there were not a lot of food offerings and what was there was either dried out, over cooked (pastas), or old. The desserts were the only items that looked okay, but there weren't a lot and they don't make a meal. 
I tried to make it work. I've never eaten white rice that was hard, crunchy & sticky - I thought I was gonna break my teeth! One bite of the pizza was all I could do - it was doughy; the baked chicken wing had 2 feathers on it that we're longer than the wing tip - No exaggeration!!! I was done.
To be fair, there were three positives - the cheesecake was good - not great, but good was wonderful after everything else was so bad. The beef at the carving station, once it was restocked, was really good- very nicely seasoned.  The service was great!

Going fro left to right: in the Chinese section the beef chow fun had no beef, the egg rolls were really little spring rolls and the dumplings were really pot stickers.  moving on to the American section I tried the fried chicken and the crust was hard and leathery and the chicken meat was dry and had the consistency of rope.  In the salad section none of the dressings were labeled and when I asked a worker to identify them he did but with an attitude that suggested that I was stupid for not being able to identify without help.  In the Italian section there was shrimp scampi but no plain pasta to put it with and the tortellini was not identified as meat or cheese.  The clerk there didn't know.  The lemon meringue pie was OK.  The table service was very good.

It had a BOGO entry to the buffet & I noticed on Friday they had all you can eat crab legs. Even though the coupon wasn't valid for Fridays or Saturdays I still took the BF out to dinner because we loooove crab legs. I used to go to Hush Puppies on Monday nights because they offered all you can eat crab legs for $25 but they stopped that a couple years ago. 

We got there around 6 or so & even though the line was long we probably only waited about 30-45 minutes. Not bad IMO. 

With tax for two people it came out to about $47 & to me that's okay because we beasted on those crab legs. I probably got about 4 or 5 plates of it. Yum!

The BF got some other stuff. Prime rib (it looked pretty gross. Very dry looking) and he said it was pretty dry & tough, which didn't surprise me. Usually all meat like that from buffets are not very good. 

Also had some fried shrimp (tasted like corn dogs) & hush puppies (gross) but I did get some fried shrimp balls on skewers & those were actually really good. 

Their desserts were better than most buffets. The chocolate tart & key lime tart were good. The banana cream pie was excellent & it was sugar free which surprised me. And they also have a cool espresso machine. I got two chocolate espressos. Pretty good!

All in all we came here for the crab & crab alone & it was worth it. Probably will go back for Brazilian Steakhouse night.

The all-you-can-eat crab legs (the lines for the hot ones can be long, but I've found the heat shrinks the meat and the cold ones have more flavor!) and the lobster ravioli, which I top with alfredo sauce & parmesan.

No joke, even though the line is shorter but takes just as long because everyone moves in slow motion here, the food selection is smaller but I feel like the quality is higher.

Got here at 6PM on Thursday, the NY Deli theme night, and spent $20 for two using a BOGO coupon and the cardholder's discount. We were able to move to the register pretty quick, but after that it was a good 15 minutes til we were actually seated at a table.

Bonus stars for being able to order the old fashioned Dr. Brown's old fashioned sodas- BF inhaled the black cherry and the cream soda flavors!

NY Deli theme night includes options like lox and capers (though no bagels to put it on, which was odd given the amount of cream cheese they had nearby), pastrami and corned beef (surprisingly NOT good considering they were highlighted), matzo ball soup (better than expected!), cabbage rolls and laktkas. 
Other tasty options included the short ribs, Asian chicken wings and bbq ribs, Greek salad with tons of feta cheese, and fairly decent prime rib- considering their Friday special advertises it as a featured entrée, I didn't expect to see it on other nights.

Like I said, service was slow to get seated, but the food was better quality than I'm used to getting at a buffet- you won't have a mile of different food options, but here they do seem like the focus on doing less dishes to a higher standard rather than putting out a bunch of mediocre dishes just to have ""variety"".

I have never been able to shut my wife up before and actually begged me to go and get her a slice of her own!

The Asian food on the bar was also out standing. The egg rolls were crunchy and very good. The peel and eat shrimp was only slightly harder to peel than at other places, but still delicious. The breaded cod had a very light coat of breading and other than the skewered okra, was the only thing I saw that was deep fried in the ""American"" section (obviously the fried wontons and egg rolls were the things deep fried in the Asian foods section).

Havent been to the Rampart buffet in years but my memory was pretty negative about this place. Recently the only reason ive gone is because the cafe was closed so the only option was the buffets breakfast section. 

This time my expectations were exceeded but not greatly. Food was ok but their presentation is very dismal, i guess i cant expect anything else from a buffet, but more rotations? and no empty platters would help a lot. The salad was empty, fruit was almost gone so i came back for dessert and luckily it was refilled.

Pretty much a decent standard overall. I've been to worse casino buffets and much better ones, but for the 12 dollar price this one is acceptable. If in the mood for prime rib, salmon and other randomly combined things this place works.

The Asian section is still okay if the right chef is cooking but the rest of the food items are rather bland and tasteless to me. I live in a senior community and they sent residents here a coupon for a 2 for 1 lunch or dinner but then when you show up at the cashier they charge you full price and not member's price.

There was a promo going on that night where you spin the wheel and my prize was a ""buy one, get one free buffet."" I was with some family members for this Vegas trip so it turned out to be an ok deal for dinner. The catch with this ""buy one, get one free buffet"" however is that the buffet you are buying is a full price buffet. This means you can't apply any other discount such as the player's card discount or a senior discount.

We came here on a Friday night and so a lot of the seafood fans were overjoyed. Friday nights they offer crab legs and even have the big gray buckets (a la Boiling Crab style) for folks to throw away their crab legs.

For non-seafood eaters like me, I felt the selection was a little limited. They did have steak, fried pork and fried chicken among the meat selections but it just seemed like they didn't have too much. I got a couple items from the Asian section such as their mapo tofu but I found the items here too salty.

As for dessert, the selection was pretty nice. They had gelato, various pies and beignets! It was my first time ever to see beignets at a buffet. They weren't necessarily the best beignets but they decent. The beignets that night were filled with apple filling.

This buffet also had a nice coffee machine where folks can choose various coffee drinks such as espressos, cappuccinos and hot chocolate. This machine is certainly popular because it kept running out of coffee. I had to go back three times before it was working and filled. What is nice about this is, they have to-go coffee cups if you want to take it to-go.

There are sometimes discount coupons in the local paper that you can use to save on the buffet. You can save money too by showing your Rampart Casino players club card to the cashier.

The lines at night can be very long, so you have to wait sometimes 45 minutes in line to get in. The line for the disabled people is always shorter.

The good is that seniors with players club cards get in for $5 each. Regular price is $11.99 or $9.99 with a players club card - this is for m-f lunch only. The price includes drinks. 

As for the buffet itself, it consisted of a small salad bar (with tiny plates) with two soups, three areas of food and one area of desserts. There was also an automatic cappuccino station between desserts and the Italian food set up. The three types of food represented were Italian, broad-spectrum Asian, and American. For my $9.99 I got some romaine with black olives and ranch, a piece of rotisserie chicken, some green beans, and some mixed Asian veggies. The chicken was actually good and the romaine was crisp and fresh so I can't complain about the food I ate - just wish there had been more options that looked palatable to me at the time. In terms of desserts they have a ton of those, including soft serve, meringues, gingerbread cookies (likely seasonal), and a few no sugar added items like carrot cake, apple crumble pie and some kind of chocolate mousse or pudding cake.

BE CAREFUL..CAUTION::..there is a 4"" floor stripping that goes across connecting the busy looking carpet to the hard tile that has a 15° angle to it.

The buffet appeared to be half full, with a few families, and but most of the senior citizens knew each other.  Our waitress was efficient, polite and did not forget us, as most buffet rooms are understaffed making it impossible for all but seasoned staff able to cope.  

The Prime beef was melt in your mouth, the Pork was not dry, and also melt in your mouth.  Marble tofu, had no pork (sad), to many vegetables, but the sauce had good consistency, instead of tofu in water debacle served in Boulder Station. The remainder of the Asian food looked like it had been setting in the trays since noon. Since I was there for dinner, I tried one, spring roll and in my opinion they need to hire a Asian food cook.

Spaghetti noodles were floating in water, and completely mush, sauce had a good flavor, but could not finish it with the overcooked spaghetti noodles.  Maybe if I had no teeth.   The milky fluid and water socked corn was passed quickly.  

Salad, venue was far better, crisp and kinda appetizing compared to the cooked food, but I was quite disappoint, I could have visited any McDonald down the street & around the corner for a better prepared meal, with two exceptions: The Beef was amazing, and one ""No Added Sugar"" hard Ice Cream, with a Chocolate flavor that was wonderful.  

Unless you are possessed and mad, this is a buffet to avoid, unless you live next door, and have lost your teeth along with the sense of smell, and taste.  Or you do not enjoy eating, and are very angry at the long lines and understaffed buffets of other Casinos.",w9K_7MTRO610njK_qgbwcA,2,1,1,llBRNAut2qHGslrv818W9Q

We immediately noticed that the clientele is pretty elderly, and I think that their food reflects that (we're in our mid-60s, but they were all a lot older than we are). Ribs were all they had at the carving station, and they were so overcooked that they only had about two bites of meat on them. That seemed pretty ridiculous as the meat choice. The vegetables consisted of things like overcooked peas and carrots, and lots of mushy looking food. It reminds me of my 85 year old mother, who loves her vegetables cooked to death so she doesn't have trouble with her false teeth!  They did have really good macaroni salad, and the salad bar was nice--fresh fruit, etc. They did a pretty good job with desserts, and having a coffee machine where we could get a cappuccino after the meal was very fun. The people working there were very nice and helpful. Maybe their clientele is mostly elderly locals and that's why the menu is what it is-- but I think they'd do themselves a favor by cooking fresher foods that have more appeal, especially considering the price (which is several dollars higher than Station and many other local casinos). I didn't think it was worth the price at all, and that was disappointing considering that it's a nice casino and the personnel there seems great.

Ran out of Prime Rib by 8:30pm just before I went to get some.

I figured, I would have Prime Rib because Salmon was Saddd!

So terrible Salmon & No Prime Rib.

They also started clearing food by 9pm & never warned us what was going on.
Evidently Coffee shop was going to be renovated so they needed to prepare to open for those customers?

4074314,2012-06-11,8,kwacNh9UDn_sIf0-wBatgA,"I'm sorta embarrassed that I've eaten at this crappy buffet so many times, and  I feel like I need to explain myself. Look, the Rampart sends us free coupons every single month. Yes, completely 100% FREE buffet coupons. I'm a Vegas local and eat at buffets weekly, and who am I to turn down a free meal? 

Admittedly, this buffet is one of the worst in town. The food is just pure crap and mostly fried, breaded or overly carby stuff. Be prepared for fried shrimp, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, french fries, baked potatoes, egg rolls, more potatoes....you get my drift. If you are lucky they'll have a tray with pre-mixed peas and carrots or steamed broccoli. Obviously an afterthought but at least there are SOME veggies. Most of the food is soft, mushy, easy to chew and mildly seasoned to appease the palates of their senior citizen customer base. This place was heavenly after I had my root canal because I could eat just about everything at the buffet and not hurt my recovering tooth.

That being said, the buffet does have a decent salad bar with good dressings and a good assortment of fresh fixings (including fresh crumbled bacon). When we get a free coupon, we usually go and drink soda, eat prime rib and have the salad bar. For how cheap this place is anyway, it's a pretty decent value even if you only eat the salad bar (soda, tea, coffee, juice, milk, etc. is included in the price). You can't get a decent prime rib dinner, including a drink, salad and dessert, for less than $10 anywhere else.

The New York Deli Night (every Thursday) has much higher quality food, but it's way too expensive ($19 per person). On regular nights you can find crappy Chinese food, Italian food, American food and a dessert station. Sometimes they'll have fresh strawberries at the dessert bar which is a big plus. They also have huge New York style pickles at the salad bar and they are always good. There's not a big difference between the lunch and dinner buffets. 

The weird thing about this buffet is that 95% of the time the food is just awful but there's a rare 5% of the time when the food is really super good. It's a strange phenomenon for sure but it does happen. Sometimes the prime rib is INCREDIBLY delicious (I'd say every 2 out of 5 visits the prime rib is crazy good; they obviously know how to cook prime rib). One night they had really delicious freshly made shrimp scampi with huge shrimp. This has only happened ONE TIME, though. It's just very hit or miss. The pizza is sometimes okay and other times inedible. 

If you want to fill up on mediocre lunch room school cafeteria food and your standards aren't too high, go here. If you just want a cheap meal with a salad bar and soda, go here. If you are looking for one of Vegas' best buffets, avoid this place. 

And yeah, all the comments about the old people ""regulars"" is right on! This place looks like a retirement home cafeteria. I love old people and I'm not an ageist at all but watch out, they will knock you over with their walkers and canes if they think you are trying to cut in front of them in the fried shrimp line!

The lunch offerings are typical but delicious. I'm not the best person to go to a buffet because I usually eat few things, but here I actually tried a lot of different foods.

We warned them that the Las Vegas concept of deli is like the Statue of Liberty at New York/New York - all smoke and mirrors and totally fake, but they were brave and hungry.

We got there at about 8:30 pm, early enough for all the food still to be available, but too late for it not to be dried out.

The Pluses: 
-  the homemade potato knish is fabulous, and full of caramelized onions.  And they have deli mustard to accompany it, though at a different counter.

-  the Douwe Egberts coffee machine spits out dark roast coffee, latte, cappuccino, and a few other choices.

-  the cheesecake is fairly good, but wouldn't give Cheesecake Factory any competition.

The Minuses:
-  the corned beef was dry, rubbery, and tasteless

-  the mussels tasted weird, in a spit-it-out kind of way

-  the shrimp, described as ""walnut shrimp"" on the card, had no walnuts, but were sickeningly sweet

-  the pastrami tray, which was half-full, consisted of the tiny bits that fall off the pastrami when you cut it.  There wasn't a single bit that could be called a SLICE.  If I were hankering for a pastrami sandwich, I would have been wearing it instead of eating it.

The other foods that were part of the NY Deli ""experience,"" such as the potato pancakes, gefilte fish, herring in cream sauce, matzo ball soup, and the like, are all things that I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole.  But the others pronounced them ""okay,"" but not great.  

Some good things, like the sliced smoked salmon and the brisket, which Red Rock offers at their special holiday buffets, were nowhere to be seen here.

""Rampart Buffet"" - the area was so CLEAN, I was quite surprised. Usually, a majority of even the nicer buffets are spoiled with food that extends outside of the platter...but not at this place! 

Friday is CRAB LEGS & SEAFOOD NIGHT (4pm - 9pm) and if you have a players card it'll cost you about $50 for two people. I started with the cold crab legs since there was no line, and those were slightly too salty - no butter necessary. 

I had two rounds of the steamed crab legs and that was enough for me to be done. The legs are not baby sized either, contrary to what some other reviewers have stated. The legs were larger sized and offered plenty of crab meat! They offer a wide variety of other seafood items (fried shrimp, cod, salmon, cocktail shrimp, seafood soup, mussels, etc)...but I can't comment on that b/c I just came for the crab legs and apparently the dessert. 

There were countless dessert items that made my mouth water and they all looked scrumptious. I didn't try everything but from what I did eat, the strawberry cheesecake was THE BEST. The apple tart came second with the lemon tart being third, imo. 

Lastly, I love that this place has a coffee / expresso machine that also serves hot chocolate! It is extremely popular too. The coffee with milk (no sugar added) goes very well with some of the dessert items!

It is usually $9 dollars a person for lunch but since we had a coupon, it came to $10 dollars with tax for both of us.  The selection of food was actually quite good for the price.  In fact the Chinese station had a decent selection of good Chinese food, which included real Chinese long beans instead of string beans and stir fried clams in black beans sauce.

To our surprise, the food was very good and the service was excellent. They had every type of meat you could think of for Thanksgiving -  turkey, ham, leg of lamb, prime rib, you name it. The sides were really good, particularly the sweet potato casserole, mac and cheese, and roasted vegetables. They also had a variety of desserts. The sweet potato pie was not bad.

That said, I liked the mussels marinara, the bok choi veggies and the prime rib. The salads were weak, no greens to speak of -- I don't eat refined carbs or desserts, so for me, the protein and veggie spread was below average. The Rampart needs to add some field greens and more green vegetables to their offerings, e.g. green beans, snap peas, brusell sprouts, sauteed collards etc.

5907808,2008-12-11,10,kwacNh9UDn_sIf0-wBatgA,"I'm not a buffet enthusiast, so my review will not impart any startling insights about the Rampart.  In the Vegas of the Before Mirage (BM) era, buffets were a source of cheap eats for gambling addicts coming down from round-the-clock binges.  The food was slop but what did you want for $3.29? If you hit a jackpot you could live it up with dinner at the Palatium Buffet at Caesar's Palace for $7.

With the advent of the Mirage, Steve Wynn figured out you could OVERcharge for everything including buffet slop and suckers would still cheerfully pay.  To this day, the only reason to eat at a buffet is if you're getting a deal. I received a half-price coupon for the Rampart Buffet.

Aren't buffets pretty much all the same?  I once ate at the Parisian buffet, which seemed pretty special.  Otherwise a buffet is just a feeding station, a venue for shoveling in the overpriced slop.  

The Rampart Buffet offers a decent variety I suppose.  Italian, Asian, American, and a full line of desserts. I tasted a pickle from the deli table, but it was just OK.  By far the highlight was a tasty salmon filet. In hindsight, I should have just had that with a salad.  But that's the problem with a buffet, you want to try all that crap just because it's there.

The dessert station has an impressive chocolate fountain with a large silver bowl of fresh strawberries nearby.  You can treat your strawberries to a La Dolce Vita romp in the Trevi fountain of chocolate. I was tempted. Those strawberries made me think about the tasty tidbits Anita Ekberg's lovers must have enjoyed. 

But I thought about the chocolate circulating all day in the open air picking up germs from the coughs, sneezes, and guffaws of the senior citizens.  I'm not a germophobe but for some reason my mind went there. Do you think they change the chocolate daily? Maybe not. They probably allow all sorts of microscopic critters to multiply within that gooey mass for several days.

I tried to eat small portions, but there are so many things to sample I wound up with a severely bloated belly.  Surprisingly, the macaroni and cheese was tasty.  I don't even like the dish, but it looked good.  You won't believe how far this is from Krapft.

While wolfing down my lunch I noticed that all the customers are old farts, which stands to reason since the Rampart Casino is practically a Scampi's throw away from a mammoth retirement community in Summerlin. Concievably they are the last generation for a long while to enjoy a comfortable retirement. I wonder if they appreciate how lucky they are.

The casino itself is pleasant and relaxing, far better than the ghastly Suncoast just up the street.  The parking garage is a confusing mess.  Just make sure you pass the first driveway and pull in where the sign says ""Covered Guest Parking.""

I'm giving this buffet four stars only because it doesn't seem any better or worse than the typical arena for crazed gluttony. What cured me from buffets was the Circus Circus and Excalibur buffets years ago. Those were just pig troughs dressed up with Formica and steam tables. Compared with those, the Rampart Buffet is pretty sophisticated.",PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,9,8,4,JV3GjgCLq64I3Sv05VFPQw
5922885,2017-10-23,0,kwacNh9UDn_sIf0-wBatgA,This is hands-down the most disgusting buffet I've ever been to.  I cannot believe that no one from the hotel has walked through this buffet and realize that the food is disgusting the selection is terrible and there's a very good reason why there are no lines there.  My friend had a coupon we went and ate well I should say we went and observed I barely made a small salad and was not really even interested in eating that the place was dirty avoid avoid avoid you will thank me,fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,1,0,1,brEmyrX88VXoCY0D15fcLw

Due to this, the restaurant manager allows them to have an express ticket to the front of the line, and they get their own seating area next to the food so that they don't have to walk far. 

The elderly regulars I mentioned completely hate when outsiders come into ""their"" restaurant. I've been here 3 times, and every single time, multiple regulars complained to me that if I(an outsider) didn't come to eat here today, there would be a shorter line and shorter wait time for them.  Last time I was here the group of regulars who were standing behind me at the cashier were loudly complaining about how it was a travesty that they had to stand in a line to pay now that ""outsiders"" had shown up. Ever since Rampart changed management, they have been sending out free buffet coupons to players club members. Therefore, this buffet has become extremely crowded. Back before they started sending out comps, only the same 20-30 regulars would show up for dinner every night. Now, there are 100s of new people showing up and it makes the regulars really angry. So, expect one of those angry old people to yell at you. 

The best thing about this place is that they have this really cool coffee-computer thing that instantly makes any kind of coffee you want. You don't have to wait 20 minutes for the server to bring it to you, it's all self-serve

This is Summerlin/NW Vegas so there will be a lot of bitter people fighting and arguing about stupid things. The last time I came I saw this guy whining because the guy in front of him got a bigger slice of prime rib. He kept shouting: ""His was bigger than mine! That's not fair!"".... It's an AYCE buffet, just ask for another slice. WTF is wrong with these people?",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,9,8,2,GVGsqTr6H8isXOWAUG5LIA

It is always packed full of flavor, so much that I don't need the melted butter. The other dishes like their chinese section are also winners in my book with their sauced clams.  My parents like their prime rib. The dessert area is ok, but again if you want good crab legs, this is the place to go and the price, you can't beat it.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,14,14,4,r8YAzdGWGVErJoF8Lx7kgw
