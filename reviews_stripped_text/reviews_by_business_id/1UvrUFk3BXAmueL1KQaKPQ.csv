224060,2016-05-03,0,1UvrUFk3BXAmueL1KQaKPQ,Good food just like the other 2 stores on jones and in Henderson. I also thought the service was great until today when they let someone cut in front of me. I was already good to go and check out but then the heavy set worker insisted that the man right behind me got to check out first because he ordered less items. And when they were checking him out he decided to order more food and I had to wait longer. I was ready to walk out but instead I held my composure. They should've checked me out first like how all normal businesses would no matter how many items a customer purchases. Instead they made me feel like my business there was less appreciated even though I go there all the time and spend a good amount of money. I guess I'll take my business back to jones where they always appreciated my business.,Akg_vxESannyGAXv75l2xA,2,0,1,Y4gvhODc80rt5mDZzTucAQ

We ordered adobo ,not so good and looks like mixed from other recycled adobo. Lechon kawali was dry and BBQ was not the traditional way cooked on charcoal. It was soaked it sauce and again just not a delicious choice. Maybe if they change their cook this will be a fantastic dining place.",jcL6gmVYgysNfqQ-hZCERQ,0,0,2,m08L6D5ie8f8bvW6SdKziQ

She very particular about where I get food from. I've tried many many places and this is the only place she actually request certain foods from. She loves their Kare Kare. It's really delicious. They also make really good Pinakbet. I love the Turon for desert. I recently tried the Fresh Lumpia and it's delicious.

In between two hospitals (St. Rose and Southern Hills) which you know there's filipino nurses and doctors working there haha! All jokes aside, food is really good. For me, it's the typical filipino food you eat at a filipino party. Lumpia, bbq on a stick, adobo, kaldareta, bisteak, turon, etc. They also do carry snacks just like the Sari-Sari store such as Sarsi, C2, cheez curls, cheese-o's, clover chips and many more. Staff is friendly and fluent in both English and Tagalog. I also must say, their bathroom signs are legit! Maganda for Women's, Pogi for Men's! Haha it's so rad!

I called to get a quote for a tray of pancit and lumpia for 50 people. Got quoted $32.99 for 100 pieces which seems to be the going rate but $85 for pancit!!  Really!?? 
Don't think so. I got quoted $50-55 at other places. The girl who me quoted must be delusional or thinks I can't do simple math and reasoning and basically trying to rip me off
And for that reason, I took my business elsewhere which is too bad for them because where I work, we order a lot of food for parties and we have a lot of parties; However, I work with people with integrity.

Unfortunately, everything was bad. The lichon was rock hard, the bistek was incredibly salty, the machado bowl was literally a bone with no meat and for some reason the pork chop then they barely put any in the container. 

Needless to say it was a very poor first impression for our guests and probably the worst Fiesta meal we've had. Hopefully a competitor comes around because this area needs a good Filipino restaurant.",ST8ZS-GxStA9zlMTceYi1w,1,1,2,Q50Dyz32ExS4KgRJ85hnaw

Maybe if they didn't serve them in such big batches, they wouldn't have to. The place itself is pretty big for a Filipino restaurant. Probably the biggest I've been in here in Vegas. For my first visit, I tried their dinuguan and lechon kawali. The dinuguan had hair in it. And the lechon kawali was very cold. I also tried their cantaloupe juice which was way too sweet. I wanted to add water but they only had water with lemons in it. I don't think it would have been a good idea to mix it with my juice. I was craving some pickled peppers when I went there as it normally compliments filipino food but they didn't have any at the time although I'm not sure if this is something that they normally serve. Anyways you're probably better off going to an AYCE Filipino buffet such as Nanay Glorias or Kusina ni Lorraine as this place is pretty pricey for their low quality food.",1uO7nwlNX3PRmdN7mxZ-PA,2,0,1,vzc7UZ1hQ-cC2UAuCrslcw

I got more than what I bargained for cause when I walked in the door I got hit with the full-on Filipino experience. It brought me back to when I was a kid, getting out of the family minivan, sauntering up to an auntie's (who's not blood related) house. The air was a mix of a cozy home and heartful home-cooked meals. And of course, TFC was playing, like a soundtrack to the merienda we were about to have.

Merienda, the light meal, was palabok. It was pretty good but it could've been saucier in my taste. I was still feeling full from the earlier meal but I kept on going. We took home some kare-kare and barbecue skewers to go and boy, they came through on those!

Kare-kare was peanutty enough and the meat was plentiful. Barbecue skewers weren't too fatty and weren't tough to bite through. Seems like this place is the fams' go-to when they don't want to cook...

There were only two people working behind the counter, but we came in rather early so service moved quickly. The employees were super nice about letting us sample the food before we made our decisions, as it was our first time really having Filipino food. We tried chicken adobo and the other meat adobo (maybe it was beef?) in addition to the pork belly and pork BBQ skewers. Our plates were HEAPED with food, definitely enough for 2 meals if not more, and it was only $10 each.

My only complaint is that the soy sauce contained wheat, which admittedly is always kind of a toss up at Asian restaurants, but I still enjoyed my food before my allergies kicked in. The place was very clean and spacious. Most people seemed to get the food to go, so even when the crowds picked up a bit later, there were still only a couple tables occupied.

I can make an argument that there's a VERY good reason the food here is tasty and appetizing, and that's because they uses a ""secret"" flavor-enhancer (hint it is not Knorr but very similar).

My favorite thing in the whole world is adobo pusit (squid sautéed in garlic and squid ink and whatever else makes it amazing). They have it but I have to call and see (I don't think it's daily). 

I got bangus and it had NO BONES (what the what? ) I was able to eat while driving with my hands (not proud of that particular moment, but it happened, so there). 

The Lechon is literally the best I've ever had, ever. Takes me back to the days of family parties and a giant roast pig on the table with an apple in its mouth, feeling slightly sorry for it, but standing right by and eating its back with my hands. Sorry, tmi. 

I host my daughter's bday party once a year and they cater and deliver. Everyone raves about the skewers. BBQ Chicken or pork. No matter how many skewers or lechon or lumpia I order, I run out. Which is bad, but yay. Means they enjoyed. I order food for 100 people and have a party for 50, those babies will be gone. And everyone asks where I got the food.

We we're asking how much is a box of pancit she answered ""$6.99"" and gave us a look like we were an annoying customer. The way she acted like they're gonna close in 30 mins or we were delaying them to close (can you not give us few minutes to decide what else to get?). They close at 8:30!!- - - she just put half of the pancit in the box like srsly?? Even the dinuguan we bought was so messy because she was just wrapping without looking if it's already spilling or not. I'm gonna give 5 stars for the food but customer service is .

I loved the Filipino decor that reminded me of the furniture my family had growing up. They have a pretty good variety of foods in a turo turo style buffet and it's very affordable. I had been craving bistek so I ordered 2 servings of it with rice (2 item combo is $7.50). It was pretty good and I enjoyed the sinigang too. Another Yelper said the bistek was too salty but I don't agree with that at all. I wanted to try more food, especially halo-halo since it's my favorite but I was very full after I finished my food. As full as I was, I still had an entire serving of bistek left over so I was happy about that. So we ended up taking home some desserts they sell from a Kapampangan bakery :)

The atmosphere at this place was fun and they had an assortment of Filipino goodies to be purchased in the front of the restaurant.

We ordered the HALO-HALO Special here and boy was it HUGE! It was enough to be shared by 3 people.  It had all the stuffings and fillings.  My only qualm with this place is that they give it in a cup that is hard to mix and you end up dropping all the corn flakes and other yummy on the table.  Not cool!!!!! NOOOOO!!! MY ICE CREAM!! Either way this place has a good repertoire for their food.  I didn't bother tasting anything because the waitress behind the counter was super pushy with us buying food and it turned me off.  I understand you are trying to sell your food but calm down lady! All I want is my halo-halo! They have a lot of other take out options as well as desserts by the front door.  This place is big enough for parties.  It's worth a try.  Maybe I will come back for other foods but from what I see I think I'll just come back for more halo-halo but this time I'll bring my own salad bowl.

So when it comes to a Filipino buffet, I think, this is by far the most flavorful joint. They also have a bigger variety compared to others at a fairly low price. I'm hooked. 

My favorite entrees to get are the corned beef, fried bangus, steak bangus, chicken curry, beef steak, lumpiang shanghai, and turon. I can see why my girlfriend would feel nostalgic every time she's here because it seems a tad bit like home. The servers are generally friendly as they're eager to serve you similar to that of someone who is inviting you to eat their home cooked meal. 

At the same time, all the meals I've tried were flavorful to taste. I'm told they're not the best per se. I guess Filipino food is one of those meals you really have to eat home cooked-style?
