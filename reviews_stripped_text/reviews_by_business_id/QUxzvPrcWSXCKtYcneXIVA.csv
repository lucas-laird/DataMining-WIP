Come in on Tuesdays for half off their classic fish taco after 2:30 PM... but you may have to remind the cashier, because their registers don't automatically give the discount.

The shrimp verde taco is also good, but I'd personally request it on corn tortillas. They're currently promoting a langostino burrito that sounds tasty, but the fish tacos are reliably large and tasty.

If you think about it, you can get something far superior to a Chipotle bowl for less than the Chipotle bowl with guacamole. It's also a gigantic meal and I always split it into two. The California bowl has the standard rice, beans, meat, lettuce, guacamole, and pico de gallo, with a choice of red or green salsa. The game changer is the chipotle sauce which is probably sour cream with chipotle but it really keeps the bowl from being too dry even if it no doubt adds calories. There's a salsa bar where you can get more salsa, onions and cilantro, limes, jalapeños and carrots. It's a little difficult to navigate quickly with the small cups they give you but I usually go back 2-3 times.

I mostly always crave for the original fish tacos. They're what made them famous and for good reason. I also like the California bowl with tilapia.

They have your typical steak and chicken burrito options if your not in the mood for fish, and these are also great. There is alway some new flavor on the menu to try. There food items are not swimming in grease so you wont feel like you swallowed a lead ball when your finished chowing down. If its your first time I recommend the Blackened Ono Burrito.

Aside the Verde salsa, I did not catch flavor from the other three. Especially the Chipotle sauce which tasted more burnt than anything.

I like Rubio's tacos. They are fresh and I have never had a bad experience with what I tend to order. I rotate between their original fish taco platter, street tacos platter, and grilled fish platter. I've never had the burritos, quesadillas, etc. On my last visit I had the street tacos platter (carne asada, chicken, and carnitas). They were all tasty and well prepared. Not fats or gristle, just good meat.

The chips are nice to dip in the beans and the numerous salsas you can get at the salsa bar.

With lots of chicken, black beans, quinoa, brown rice and, whoa - a ton of sliced almonds - in addition to a few other goodies, this dish can't be beat.  It is such a huge portion that I can't even think of it as being healthy; there's just too much of it, and I don't stop when I'm full.  But it sure is delicious.

I've had other terrific things at Rubio's in the past - their chicken with balsamic veggies is another favorite - but as long as they keep offering the quinoa I'm gonna keep on ordering it.

The delivery itself was pretty quick, which was awesome because we were pretty hungry. The chicken quesadilla was just okay, a little bland but good. The grilled shrimp burrito was really tasty, just a little heavy on the rice inside of it per shrimp ratio. They gave us two sides of their chipotle sauce so that was great because it was sooo good on the food and because we were served a bunch of tortilla chips it doubled as a dip! The only real big let downs was the food itself was delivered COLD. Which I don't have this issue a lot at all with the third party. I assume they made the food early and it just sat there waiting for the driver to arrive. Also, they forgot our large side of beans! We were totally bummed!

5659940,2014-02-12,6,QUxzvPrcWSXCKtYcneXIVA,"Sometimes I just get a hankering for things I would never normally purchase. Fish tacos are pretty high on my list of ""things I don't buy."" On 1/22/14 I just had to stop in and grab something and In N Out had a line wrapped around the block. 

Whenever I go to ""fast casual"" Mexican restaurants, I go for the kids' meal. They're the perfect size and come with a drink, a side and a churro. The kid's fish taco was actually... Really good! 

While I was there, some woman kept ordering extra everything while waiting for her order to come out and sent back soup twice... for a to go order. She was making loud comments about ""oh you know kids, they won't touch it if it has avocado so I need you to fix it."" She tried to give me a look as if she was seeking my approval / agreement. Think again you heifer - you're what's wrong with people. An entitled PITA  that is holding up the kitchen. Kill yo self. Ugh. 

Next some fool (see photo) in a faux fur vest came in asking what is vegetarian on the menu. B---- this is a FISH taco place. GTFO. The poor guy behind the counter said ""real vegetarian like a vegan or pescetarian?"" This broad said ""what is a pescetarian and vegan?"" Oh girl puhleeze. Stop wasting everyone's time with deciding you're on diets that you vaguely heard about on The View. You're embarrassing yourself. He explained them and she said ""no, real vegetarian."" Well there's only a veggie burrito so... deal. 

Between the heifer that kept sending food back and asking for extra chips and sides and... Agh! and this other fool, the kitchen was backed up. 

When my to go order came out, I said that I didn't understand how he was so calm with all of these high maintenance customers who need to get a clue - as I glared at the two wenches who were causing the problems. He smiled and said they weren't so bad and that he likes helping customers. I know he had to say it. I said ""yeah sure they are. They're jerks."" (Amongst other things.)

4 stars for the cashier and the bomb kid's taco I had. Zero stars to high maintenance customers.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,3,4,eG8S4rbLNhwgmbffXGUS8Q

I usually get chips with my order because they have a salsa bar and one time I forgot to add it to the order the manager just gave me it for free.

Maybe because I don't eat seafood and didn't realize they would offer awesome chicken tacos! I like that they have plenty of gluten free options too.
