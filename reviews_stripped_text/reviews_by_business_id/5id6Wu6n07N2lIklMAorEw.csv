298572,2017-06-25,0,5id6Wu6n07N2lIklMAorEw,I would honestly give them zero stars for their service!! It's a 24 hour mcdonalds that tells you to wait one second before they take your order and then tells you they're closed when you go to order when all the lights are still on. Fuck this McDonald's!! Go somewhere else and spend your money.,roMhsyKmCpX5yaGoI8LBcA,0,0,1,-rpVESdVonVS18_5LAbUgQ
759835,2016-08-19,0,5id6Wu6n07N2lIklMAorEw,Cleanest McDonald's around Vegas. Excellent staff. Bathrooms always clean and floors and tables. Friendly staff that greets. Food served with a smile. Whenever I work in the area I make sure to stop.,DxmJ-haI_3wpTT6pZd5a_Q,0,0,5,IIdy8rCrGKrFhkCo-PCKNA

Usually only stop there when I get off work at 3am because it's is the only place open really never have what I order, plus th3y are always making me wait and taking other people's orders that have arrived after I did.

Keep up the great customer service Jovita.,tV-q3aoHwTt6UgqKwDArjQ,0,1,5,MaxcALmFqwK0MTW9TjqSUA
1488897,2015-06-09,3,5id6Wu6n07N2lIklMAorEw,"Love this new McDonald's location! It's minutes from my work and easy access to main highway. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a staff member. He was informing me about the their new Asian Salad menu. The decent spread of selections make it difficult to order. And the dollar menu and sweet treats are the bargains! McDonald's never gives me a hassle when I ask for a fresh batch of their famous fries. I'm loving it! LOL! 

McDonald's has gone a long way improving their menu for more grills, greens and smoothies. So, no more blaming game that fast food chain restaurants causes obesity for both childhood and adults! Haha!

The modern decor, big open space, and nice LCD menu boards make this location an awesome pick! 
The staff is great and service is above average compare to other McDonald's around town. Hope you have the same experience! :)",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,3,4,4,YvU5sszmoh15Hodpfg2Ytg
1631752,2015-09-19,0,5id6Wu6n07N2lIklMAorEw,"This McDonalds has a great location and the kitchen staff in the back is good. The problem is the young man running the counter.

I don't know if the young guy behind the counter is ageist or racist or what but if your older and are not Mexican, he counts how many refills you have and then tells you ""You've had your refill and we only give one! Please pay $2 if you want another refill."" The first time this happens I queried the policy with the GM and was told yes this is correct and it is displayed by the fountain. I asked where as there is NO sign anywhere about a refill policy. The GM walked me all over the store before admiring there was no sign but the policy stands. So I go continue eating. During the time it takes for me to finish my meal I see other people, young Mexicans, go to the counter and get refills twice from the same young man with no issue and didn't have to pay anything. 

I've been to this store multiple times now and have seen this happen every time that young man is running the till.

My last visit was what I consider the last straw. I bought 2 coffees one for my mom and one for me. After my mom got her one refill I was told that I couldn't refill my coffee because she'd already had her refill. And I had 2 Long hairs in my egg mcmuffins that they did nothing about it.

If the franchise owner reads this I'd suggest reviewing your surveillance and take action on this. If your policy is one refill, it should be enforced to everybody or not enforced at all.

Also Roberto the GM couldn't care less about the customers . When I asked to speak to him he was very rude and flippant with my complaint and told me ""Go ahead and call here's my store number and name, I don't care"" when I told him I was going to complain about the issue with McDs corporate office.",6Kr6LWVvo-WbbBQWqGFvQg,0,0,1,FrUXobIyP3INJkbURqtpqQ

The manager said no problem. I get hone and the 10 nuggets were hot and fresh and fries were.  The sandwich and the other 10 nuggets cold as ice.  I had to go out again to another McDonalds and pay more money for the food that was cold.

2562173,2017-07-07,0,5id6Wu6n07N2lIklMAorEw,"If I could give negative stars I would so do it for this place. I have been going to this McDonald's as long as I can remember probably as long as it's been there!!! My thing is that now since they became more modernized, they really aren't keeping up like they make everyone think. First of all I had three back to back episodes of just straight BS. 
1. Went to drive through and ordered my food asked if they accepted Apple Pay. They acted like I was speaking an unknown language so I just asked again at the window. They say oh the machine is down right now....ok I get it and paid with my debit card. 

2. Called before hand this time to see if the machine was working for Apple Pay....they lady said yes it's working. Cool on my way. Ordered my food get to window and the guys says he can't grab my phone to put it up to the machine for the reader to scan it. Wow!!! Really!!! Taco Bell, Burger King and Starbucks all take your phone from you and hand it back. He said I will be held responsible if I drop it, I said then don't drop it in between me handing it to you and to the register and back.  No ma'am I can't. Whatever I paid again with my card. 

3. This is the real fun time.  Sorry it's so long but I had to explain in detail!!!!!!!I call first to see if Apple Pay was working and also stated that unneeded to use it through the drive thru, they say oh yeah it's working and that's fine to pay with Apple Pay in the drive through. Cool here I go again like a idiot. I order my food and explain that I have coupons on my app and would like to use them. Ok fine they say just show your phone at the window. Get to the window (keep in mind I have used more than one coupon at a time here since the app came out) I said here is the coupon for buy one get one free McFlurry's. He grabbed my phone (hmmmmm thought you couldn't do that. Then I say I have one more for the buy a sandwich get another free, he still has my phone and has no idea what he is doing so I say what's up? Our system only scans one coupon per visit. Nope just did it last week. Whatever not gonna argue with you, ok can you scan my Apple Pay now? The look I got was priceless. I have no idea what you are talking about what is Apple Pay? Really get me a manager please. Manager comes while still having my phone in their possession they did not once hand my phone back, manager says oh you have to come in to use Apple Pay. Then why didn't you tell me that the first or second time I came here. Whatever go inside to pay just to find out they charges me for both Mcflurry's. I said he scanned my coupon at the drive thru window why am I charged for both. Oh it didn't process. Ok then go ahead and refund me one of the mcflurry's and I won't be back here again. We can't refund it to Apple Pay. Get the hell out of here. You need to just give me the cash then. We can't do that either. So what ur saying is I'm out the money you just charged me without my consent. I need someone above the manager. She called someone on the phone and after arguing with me and getting an additude with me ended up opening the register and giving me cash back!!!!! Then they give me mcflurry's that we're melted from sitting so long while they get their act together. Not in the mood to continue and not worth my time. I'll freeze them when I get home damn!!!! I absolutely will not ever go here again after all these years. Idiots. FYI you need to train your employees on how to operate every piece of technology you use so they don't have to look so stupid when you ask them a question about it.

5256633,2015-04-30,0,5id6Wu6n07N2lIklMAorEw,I've never seen a McDonald's with so many problems. I work at the CAL Ranch in the same parking lot every morning I go to get a cup of mocha coffee and every time I go in there cleaning the coffee machine. Who cleans the coffee machine in the morning at breakfast when everybody is drinking coffee? Finally I got mad and I asked the girl what's the deal why are you always cleaning the coffee machine in the morning she turned and asked her manager he just shrugged his shoulders and said you can come back in 15 to 20 minutes he obviously doesn't care. In 15 to 20 minutes I have to be clocked in at my own job I'm usually there between 6:30 AM and 7:00am. Then this morning I pull into the drive through where there is a line of cars and before they take my order they tell me it's cash only! Who carries cash on them anymore I now had to back out of the drive-through because I didn't have time to wait in line to not get any food I wish they would get with it.,PWHmXFwf-ndI8X5NIgla_Q,1,0,1,d7h5hVG-rJvwp1LjTgkEtw
