29073,2016-03-08,0,Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA,"Made the mistake of coming here for my one dinner in Vegas.  The bar/countertop looked somewhat inviting for a single diner from outside so I grabbed a seat.  It turns out that the ""bar"" is more of a glass washing station than bar, and there was a consistent flow of dirty glasses being passed across the counter next to me and placed directly in front of me until the clean glasses were finished.  Then the ""bartender"" would noisily unload the dishwasher with all the glasses and hurl the next batch in.  Very unappetizing.  

I sent my Caesar salad back because it had no dressing.  I prefer light dressing but there was really none. 

Then I took a bite of my pasta and found something crunchy.  Turns out it was eggshells.  How it got there, no idea.

1. We walked up to the podium a min after the couple ahead of us. Instead of greeting the two of us as well and the host COMPLETELY ignored us! He just acknowledged the first couple and took them to their table, not so much as a smile in our direction. I would have been willing to overlook this if the meal hadn't continued in the wrong direction.
Before I go on, a kudos to the management: My bf ordered waffles and I ordered an omelette. About 5 min after our order was taken the manager headed over with a beautiful plate of waffles. He explained that their waffle machine had been broken all morning and it just started working again. The manager didn't want to take the chance that his client wouldn't get the requested order and so decided to let the order go out early. Nicely done.
2. My bf didn't want to start eating before me and we figured an egg couldn't take too long, so we kept chatting and waited. The table that was seated after us received their eggs and I was still foodless (this was 20 min after the waffles arrived). Just as I was about to say something I saw our waiter realize the mistake and turn a 180 on his heels back to the kitchen. However, he did not see that I had witnessed his mistake and was expecting him to head over to our table to give a small apology for the wait. Not so. When my omelette finally arrived I expected that to be his opportunity to give a small 'I'm sorry'. Not so. The mistake was never acknowledged, quite the contrary, our waiter ignored us through the whole meal!
That should teach me not to expect.",xGOrSeJsxEhiZbiGMXoC_A,0,0,2,IyJfjA0fh1CX8eAnCHpDBg

We shared each part of our meal.

I got Minestrone Di Verdure (very good), 

main course: Pennoni Alla Vodka (pasta tubes with creamy vodka sauce and bacon, excellent and cheesy too. Server ground fresh parmesan over the pasta.

Dessert: Tiramasu, which was chocolatey and creamy.

My husband got: Rustichella flat bread topped with goat cheese, mozzarella, tomatoes, red onion, kalamata olives, basil and oregano. Absolutely wonderful. Practically like a pizza.

His main course: Petto Di Pollo Al Peperoncino - OMG!!! This was the best tasting and most perfectly cooked chicken I have ever tasted and my husband agreed. It was juicy and practically melted in your mouth like butter. It gives me a reason to go back to Vegas and this restaurant.

I was in the mood for some good pasta and a good portion size.  We also went here because it was close to where we were staying.  It was good.

The free bread was awesome.  It was ciabatta and some rolls.  The rolls I didn't care about but the ciabatta was awesome.  We asked for a second basket and they gave us more.

I got the Minestrone soup to start.  It was good.  Not the best I've had but very fresh and light tasting.  I enjoyed it.

For the meal, I ordered the lasagna ferrarese.  I asked our waitress for a recommendation for a good portion size.  She recommended this.  The portion size wasn't as big as I had hoped; however, it was really good.  It was definitely plenty for any normal meal though.  With the bread, soup, and lasagna, I was full.  No question.  

My wife ordered the Calamarata alle Melanzane.  I thought it was good, but it did have a strange flavor that I couldn't quite pinpoint.  We probably would have rather tried something else.

I've eaten here maybe a half dozen times or so.  The service I've had ranges from average to very good.  No real bad experiences, but every time I'm there the wait staff looks different, so the real bad reviews you see here may be partially attributable to high turnover.

The food quality has always been good, but there is a wide variation in ""heaviness"" of the dishes.  The food is ""northern Italian"" which tends to be a bit richer than typical southern Italian dishes.  There is lots of dishes which feature heavier, creme-type sauces.  I personally don't prefer this, so I order lighter items such as the vegetarian pizza, spagetti with cuttlefish sauce (that's not it's exact name, but I can't remember it right now).  There is a couple simple salads which are excellent.  The desserts are also very good.  I've also had the mannicotti, which was okay, but had a heavy sauce which made it richer than I'd like.  I would recommend reading the descriptions carefully and asking your server for recommendations if not sure.

The prices are pretty reasonable, so I'd dine here again.  It's much better than Regale next door at the Excaliber.",sIDgOgDyl4pgLjC6BknWkg,1,0,3,jdip_oLp9_2_CB7gxr9trQ

Normally, a restaurant like this wouldn't deserve such a poor rating as this is what I would expect from a cheap fast food restaurant for around 5 dollars. For around 20 a plate in a casino worth probably over 100 million, this level of quality is abhorrent. 

The pasta seemed like a box of barilla I could have cooked from walmart, coated in a novice chefs sauce that was like watered down wine mixed with Kraft italian dressing. The lasagna was better, but only because the cheap meat and cheese covered the ragu sauce (as described on menu actually as RAGU). The salad was soggy and dressing poor. The highlight of the meal was the packaged balsamic vinegar served with the bread. Very poor food, made worse by the exorbitant prices.

The service was also extremely poor, we were only visited by the busboy who kept refilling our glasses. The waiter was mostly absent.

Atmosphere was nice, if a little cheesy, but a live concert which seemed to be going on in the casino was a bit distracting during a meal.

Could have got an equivalent meal at sbarros for significantly cheaper.

The server did not spend much time at the table and the restaurant was not busy, only a few tables.After we declined drinks (apparently its offensive to be sober in Vegas), his mood was rather sour. We ordered two lunch specials, a panini and a salmon dish. There was a bread basket with oil which was ok. No attention to refilling our waters. Instead of the panini, there was a steak presented, one that did not look too tasty. The food presentation in general was lacking. The salmon was very dry with very little flavor. It was tepid when served. The entire plate was drowned in oil. It did not taste like olive oil either, for the bread or the entrees, probably soybean oil cut with olive. It took very long for the panini to come out, we had already finished the salmon. There was no apology or offer extended to compensate for the service mistake. Even if it was no one's fault, server presence is the difference between a happy and annoyed customer. The panini was very dry and the beef tough. The server seemed impatient for us to leave, maybe he was having a stressful day.

Our waiter was very knowledgable of their dishes, which, is helpful if someone in your party has a food allergy.  One of the girls in our party is Gluten free, so, we had to research places that offered GF options.  Il Fornaio makes all their pasta fresh and they have a GF pasta.  My friend said it was one the best dishes she ever had.  They have about 4-5 GF options on their menu, sadly, not for desert. They start you off with a healthy bread basket (not GF) with olive oil and balsamic to dip it in.  Our meals came out fairly quickly and are decent portions.  I got the gnocchi, which, I typically do no order.  However, with that said, if I lived near this restaurant, I would go once a week for their gnocchi, it was delicious.  I did not have any drinks but I did get the limoncello cake for desert and, although I couldn't finish it after my meal, it was fantastic.

The restaurant is quite large, but we have never been inside. We always sit in their ""outdoor"" area which is off one of the main walkways of the casino. It's a great location to sit and people watch.

Our favorite way to order is via their regional menu.  This option gives you a 3 course meal for about $35 per person. You get an appetizer, a second course, and then your main meal. Dessert is not included.  Plan on your tab being around $100 with a glass of wine each and maybe a cup of coffee to top off the meal.

Here is a sample of the regional menu that is going to be offered in January 2017:
https://www.ilfornaio.com/festa/2017/Core-Lombardia-menu17.pdf

Be sure to sign up for their ""passport."" You will accumulate points each time you dine, and then you can redeem the points for free coffee, dessert, and appetizer or even a complete regional meal.

Anyway, as for this location the service is always perfect.  We were seated very quickly (which is what usually happens). We arrived at about 8:30pm.  Our waiter was wonderful. It turned out he was actually from Rome. So, it was great to have an ""authentic"" Italian serving us dinner and able to talk to us about the menu items.
  
My husband ordered the Branzino (which is sea bass). He loves sea bass, but wasn't crazy about this dish.  Not because there was anything wrong with it...He just didn't read all the ingredients and it seemed like everything on the dish, other than the fish, was not his cup of tea, but I thought is was WONDERFUL.. it was covered with tomatoes and kalamata olives and Sicilian green olives and some mushrooms. It was SO flavorful and delicious.

I ordered the salmon...It was good, It came with scalloped potatoes and some veggies. It was not as impressive as the Branzino, but still very good.

We also shared a wine flight that included 1/2 glass each of one red wine and 2 white wines..this was only $15, and the amount worked perfect for us.

I went with one of the specials of the day, which was a pasta with a creamy red bolognese sauce, ham, and peas.  I forgot the type of pasta but it was similar to gnocchi but not as heavy.  The creamy bolognese was absolutely delicious and went really well with the ham.  The sweetness of the peas added a nice dimension to the dish as well!

I ordered one of the daily specials which was pasta with seafood, I really should have taken a pic of the name but see photo below. The pasta was pasta and the sauce almost tasteless. The seafood mixture was great though, the shrimp and white fish were quite fresh for the price and being in a city not next to the ocean. Might have been smart of me to order extra sauce, since it seemed quite a dry dish.

The service though, I have no complaints. Although the restaurant seemed full we were seated right away.

We were seated for dinner at a long table in what's usually the bakery, but we were able to order from their regular menu. We were served complimentary bread while we looked over the menu, and we also ordered drinks. I got an alright pomegranate martini for about $14.

After glancing over the prices for their regular menu items (between $17 and $28 for various kinds of pasta) we were informed of a $30 dinner special they were offering as a part of Restaurant Week. $4 would go to charity and it was a great selection of food as well - the $30 included an appetizer (minestrone, flatbread, or salad), entree (chicken, vodka sauce fettucine, or salmon), and dessert (tiramisu or zabaione with berries). Most of my group went for the $30 offer, including me.

The minestrone was well-seasoned, warm, and filling. It was appropriately portioned as well. I wish I had gone with the salmon instead of the chicken, but it turned out to be well-cooked and juicy with some nice potatoes on the side. Wasn't too big a fan of the quickly-sauteed spinach that served as the bed, though. The zabaione was a nice way to end the meal - nice and light after a pretty heavy dish.

In my opinion, an Italian restaurant should either be super affordable and homey-tasting, or more expensive/splurgy but worth it in quality and innovation. This place didn't do either. I can't say I'd spend $30 here when my company wasn't paying for it (haha) but it was an okay experience nonetheless.",HPtNvEBZTZzD6XhNMSdWEA,0,0,3,hq8cBVNLjFQ5SF-F5m-BOg

Our bellhop handed up a bogo entree coupon for breakfast the day we checked in at NYNY, so we had to try!

Coffee and OJ was standard. Breakfast came with a basket of bread and butter. I also ordered a side of fruit not realizing how huge the entree would be... Oops. I was able to take it with me though

I got the corned beef hash with over easy eggs. It came with grilled polenta with Gorgonzola cheese- totally not my thing. It wasn't bad though, just a texture I don't usually enjoy. 

The corned beef was SO flavorful. I believe it had a mixture of onions and potatoes with this. I was very pleased with my choice. 

My husband got the pancakes with real maple syrup. The pancakes were done right, high quality maple syrup. We had no complaints!

Our service was good and quick, the view was lovely from the ""outside"" (really inside, just a casino view)... It was early so no one was blowing cigar smoke in our direction.

The caprese salad was without oil and vinegar, the pizza was completely lacking in character. What was the pink sauce that tasted of shame and regret on the diavolo pizza?

The hostess was there and saw me pull my hand back and look at it - my finger had been punctured and was bleeding.  Investigation revealed that someone had put several toothpicks inside the cushioning pointing up and down.  If someone had sat on it they would have been injured. I suggested to the hostess that they close that table until they could check and clear the cushion.  I then asked for an antiseptic wipe to clean my finger.  A Manager showed up with an antiseptic wipe and a band aid.  He didn't ask, but I told him what had happened. He didn't offer an apology, but he was quick to say kids had sat at that table earlier and must have done that. While he was there, the hostess found another toothpick and the manager removed it.

I give this restaurant only one star due to its management and disrespect from the waiter that served us.  This place is located inside the New York New York Hotel.

We went to dinner at this place with a group of around 12 people or so.  We asked to split the bill four different ways.  At first the waiter said it was not a problem, then when the bill came he said his manager did not let him split the bill.  Really, since when does a restaurant NOT let you split the bill.  This was an awkward situation being that this was the first time we were meeting my sons girlfriends family, so you can imagine.  

It took us an hour just to figure out the bill.  There was extra charges on there of about $100 for 4 bottles of water that no one ordered.  They automatically poured the water when we arrived to the restaurant without asking us.  

This is just unacceptable!!  So the very next day we went to check out and complained to the manager (Marcello), who seemed very concerned at the time.  He told us he will look into it and apologized for everything.

We got a call from him (Marcello) 2 days later and said there is nothing he could do for us.  He said the waiter told him we asked for 14 different bills.  

REALLY!!!!  There wasn't even 14 of us there!  there was only 4 different families of which 5 were children.

Our family overpaid about $100 extra due to this mistake.

DO NOT COME HERE!  TOTALLY DISRESPECTFUL AND THEY DO NOT CARE WHAT THE CUSTOMERS HAVE TO SAY!  THE WAITER LIED!",MdpDeR2xeGR40iu0O897Nw,1,0,1,1IaboMuJjF5_a1tYnMcfqQ

First, ordered regular coffee -- not espresso, cappuccino, etc. It was decent for being bulk coffee, so far, so good. After the first cup, it went downhill. Ordered a couple pastries to share while we waited. The small plates that were brought to use were wet, which if course wasn't apparent until after we had the pastries divided. Pools of water and anything, you know, bread-like don't mix. Take it away. 

Next up was the omelette with bacon and potatoes. A small amount of the bacon was ok, however the majority of it was burned beyond anything edible. The potatoes had more variety; they were either burned to a lesser degree or barely cooked through with no color, and not flavor to match. Eggs were cooked fairly acceptable, but lacked flavor. In fact, aside from the burned bacon flavor, the entire dish lacked much flavor at all. 

Another breakfast on the table was scrambled eggs, with requested vegetables in it, which I'm certain the waitress did not understand so decided to literally ignore. Instead she brought ""salad fruit"". Thank you. Now take it back and bring what was ordered.

Summary: very mediocre service, horrible culinary skills, and an all around sense of apathy. To be fair, they recognized that I was not pleased and removed some amount or other from the bill, which was welcome, but really need to fix the fundamental problems.",n7rfLYuW6rWjKMZPjz3cwA,0,0,1,tiAV3E-p1eE6TarrLyY31Q

I ordered the Cannelloni con Pollo, which was decently sized, but was very bland, with WAY too much cheese.  I'm a fan of cheese, I understand the Italians are, too, but the cheese totally overpowered the sauce, which is a definite no-no in my book.  Oh yeah, marinara sauce?  Absolutely not!  All I could see was white.  Nothing marinara-y about it.  I ate a few bites willingly, and the rest I pretty much had to choke down, for the sole reason that I was paying close to 20 bucks for it, and was not ready to leave with this in a doggy bag to be finished later.  

Atmosphere of the place is nice- it's right across from The Bar @ Times Square, so you can enjoy the old school piano songs while you dine.  They're a rowdy, loud, drunk bunch over there, which makes for interesting entertainment.

In a word- yuck.  Sorry, NYNY.  You've done better.  Il Fornaio gets two stars- 1 for the convenience of being at the hotel I happened to be staying at while in Vegas, and 1 for keeping me from starving to death in the wee hours of the night.

We ordered the calamari as a starter and a pizza as our entree. VERY small portion. You get about 6-9 rings and like 3 tentacles (which I don't eat anyway).

While I wasn't expecting much, thinking the hotel was a play on a theme but didn't take the whole New York concept seriously, I was pleasantly surprised. 

The food was amazing! Some of the best italian food on the west coast, and my mom lives out there so that's saying a lot. I ordered canneloni, which is hard enough to find as it is, and my friend had the lasagna. I wanted both for myself. Their menu was also decently priced, especially for Vegas. 

Our server was excellent. I wish I remember his name, but he was very nice and extremely helpful. He recommended a few little-known hot spots off the strip, and chatted with us despite being the only one serving the entire patio. We were also seated right away, which is a rarity on a holiday weekend in Vegas when you don't have a reservation.

While I love the food and the atmosphere of the hotel itself was great, the set up of the restaurant was odd. They have a patio, which would normally be fantastic, but it's still inside the hotel, so you're actually eating on the casino floor. I love to people watch, but it was hard to hear any conversation with all the noise from the slots and passersby. Maybe if they covered it or put in a glass wall it would be a bit more bearable, but the food is more than worth the noise.

After about 20 mins of tummy rumblings, we were finally seated. First off, the house bread wasn't impressive at all. I ordered the Pennoni Alla Vodka w/ a Crown and Ginger Ale to wash it down. They returned w/ a small almost shot cup sized mixed drink cup ($9.99!?) and a plate of pasta that looks like I could whip it up as a teen home alone on a hungry night. Seriously, if the cups were dogs, my mixed drink cup would have been a miniature pinscher. The pasta actually turned out to be pretty good because the apple smoked bacon and the vodka sauce saved it. Wifey went health nut on me for a change and ordered a ""Insalata cesarina""...sounds fancy huh!? Yeah...they could have just put Caesar salad on the dang menu, but I guess they had to spruce it up for the genuine Italian feel. Well, it was a big disappointment...so I ended up sharing my plate w/ her. 

As I mentioned earlier, that this place tries to live up to the Italian feel...well I did here a couple speaking to the waiter and tell him that the food tasted exactly like what is served in Italy! I knew he was legit Italian because the waiter had to have a translator decipher his Italian.

Considering the chaotic environment in the casino outside the restaurant, we felt at ease and enjoyed our two hour stay. All of the staff, from our host, to our busser, Ricardo, managerial staff, and especially, our server Juan Sanchez, treated us like family. They kindly accommodated our every need. The bread was delicious. And they agreed to serve their sweet and creamy vodka sauce with it, upon request. I enjoyed every item on the three course menu. The tiramisu is to die for!

Daughter and I had beef hash and poached eggs. The eggs were just right.  I did not like the flavor of the beef;  my daughter did.  The polenta with gorgonzola was an odd combination that neither of us liked.  And the texture was weird.  Hubby like his French toast;  but was surprised that it was sprinkled with powdered sugar.

What did arrive (30 minutes after we ordered) was not fully cooked or cold OR not even what we ordered!   Pasta vodka was certainly not Al dente (rather it was hard and not fully cooked).  Spaghetti & meatballs were barely lukewarm.  Meatballs didn't seem freshly made, but premade from the freezer. 
Pizza Christina wasn't even the right one!  Some other pizza showed up.
Nothing tasted good (like it always had in the past).  We requested the manager and after 15 minutes he showed up very apologetic that the computer system was down.

We got waters & the bread/olive oil- it took at least 20min to get the balsamic & straws to go with. The appetizer came out in decent time & was pretty scrumptious. It then seemed to take forever to get our entrée orders in. When we got them, they were so scalding hot that we had to wait another 15min to dig in. Neither dish- at 18.99/ea.- was impressive. &, once again, our waiter was MIA. From finishing our food to the next time we saw him was another 15-20min so we were afraid to order dessert, since we were now cutting it close on time. Which we told him.

We went in for happy hour this past Wednesday, between the hours of 4-6 pm, We usually go with a smaller group but this time there was six of us. If you want to order off of the discounted happy hour menu you must sit in a small area by the bar which has a total of three small bar tables or you can sit by the bar. only options that they give you even though the restaurant area was 3/4 empty, we asked if we could sit in the dining area, they stated if you did you would have to pay regular price, so they would rather squish 6 of us on a table meant for two rather than accommodating 4 adults and two children, meanwhile the restaurant was empty. Then we ordered the food and our waitress stated that we ordered a lot of food, 2 orders of calamari a pasta dish and 5 pizzas, she said it probably would not fit on the table, that is when we stated that would rather sit in a more comfortable setting but insisted in order to get the happy hour pricing we must sit in that area. Then we asked for bread and butter and she said that our meals do not come with it, and that if we wanted it we would have to pay $3.50 for it, its only free in the dining area, which we stated we would pay and we did order a dinning area entree at regular pricing, the pasta dish so it should of been complimentary but regardless we were willing to pay.
Lastly, we asked for the bill and a different server came to remove dishes and give us our bill, 1 and 1/2 pizza were left over by the kids out of 5 pizzas we ordered, so like any other restaurant we have attended, we asked for a take out box, when the server brought back the boxes he stated that there pizzas off the happy hour menu are for eat in only no take out is usually given due to the discounted pricing he stated he would do it this time only, which is ludicrous to say the least as we paid for our food regardless of pricing, he stated that the pizza we ordered was usually $22 instead of the $7 we paid for it and was condescending to say the least, that is what broke my intention to go back yet, just lost a long distance customer that was loyal to your restaurant for the last 5 years, with all the options in Vegas you would think the service would be outstanding, rather a shame of a place that made us feel lowly. I would recommend trying Giada at the Cromwell, highly rated and would have went but booked up, i will try a new Italian place next time.

A solid 2.5 stars for food, but 5 stars for service and environment. 

Came here with my parents and it felt like we were sitting outside in a nice little city! Such a great environment to dine at with great service. 

Unfortunately, the food failed to even remotely impress us.. The best part of our meal was sadly the basket of bread in the beginning - warm, toasted deliciousness! 

I don't remember the exact name of the items from the menu since they're all in Italian so....

//VEGGIE OMELET (1.5/5): literally so meh. The omelet was extremely thick, overcooked, and had no real distinct flavor, besides egg.. And cooked vegetables. We had to dump hot sauce and ketchup on it to make it more enticing to eat, but my mom still didn't finish it. Oh well. The potatoes were really good atleast! 

//SMOKED HAM BENEDICT (2.5/5): This dish had a LOT of potential.... The cream-Parmesan sauce for the Benedict was addicting and the potatoes they served with it were crispy and perfectly seasoned. However, the eggs were overcooked, bread was too hard until I let it get soggy, and I had to soak everything in the cream sauce to make the Benedict taste good. The yolk didn't even spill out..... 

//BUTTERMILK PANCAKES (3/5): Very meh. The pancakes were moist and not dry at all, but that was the only good thing about them. Besides that there was no defining flavor and the pancakes were a little too soggy. Oh well, atleast they didn't stick to the roof of my mouth like most other pancakes! 

Overall, I don't know how the rest of the food is here, but I wouldn't come back for breakfast. Thanks for the great service and atmosphere though!",fHcIDKSv5QwuzWIVMqvrNw,1,1,2,D21qTvm4TaNlEm5aL1Kjsw
2901623,2012-02-01,0,Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA,"Once upon a time, my dad and I stopped into this restaurant while driving home to Reno, NV from Texas. This was in 2004, and we both very much enjoyed our meals. I remember having a ridiculously delicious, rich pasta dish with seafood, and a decadent chocolate cake-thing for dessert. 

Fast forward to this past month. Myself, my partner, and our best friend are roaming around before seeing a show at the casino, and I realize while I'm looking at this restaurant that it is the same restaurant my dad and I ate at years before. Remembering how much I loved it, we absolutely had to have dinner there before the show - even if the guys were skeptical.

I should have listened to them.

Although they were super nice and helpful (I'd hit my head pretty hard on the roller coaster, and they gave me water and let me just stand in the way at the entrance for about ten or fifteen minutes, nobody knowing if I'd pass out, before we finally decided to go in and eat there), and the fact that we were seated really quickly, I don't think I'd ever return to this place.

The prices are pretty high and the food is a bit mediocre. We ordered pizza because it's what the guys wanted, and although it wasn't bad, it was nothing to write home about. Since they're located in the New York, New York hotel/casino, we definitely expected a lot more from our pizza experience. Sad sad...

On top of the mediocre food disappointing me in comparison to my memories of how delicious things were before, the gentleman that we saw most often - a ""bus boy"", I think? - glared at us and made us feel as though we were children being GROUNDED. Every time he returned to the table, his demeanor and the way he moved things around (things were ""set"" down on the table very briskly and firmly, to say the least), he kind of barked at us, and was just overall unpleasant. Our waitress, however, was smiley and nice - all of the two times she made it back to our table. We even had to ASK for refills on water and coffee... which Cranky Mr. Bus Man splashed into our glasses, and promptly stormed away.",Rx-113l9m4ex64C8DZPEbA,0,0,3,FK6-PqR0ylT4jYEeF5Nt7A

She had a latte and I had an iced cappuccino. 

She had fruit n yogurt parfait with granola and again in her words she ... ""Loved it!""

I had the ham and cheese croissant w/egg and it was excellent! The outside was lightly flakey n buttery. Right after I ordered it I was on the phone for 15 min and when I ate my croissant, it was still warm and tasty. It had great flavor.

The atmosphere is great, besides typical coffee displays it had bottles of wine, olive oil, bread (which supplies Fresh n Easy their breads), recipe books and a few other knick knacks on display making it look and feel comfortable.

I go here with groups of people for a birthday dinner or what have you.  With my mom.  For those sorts of reasons.

That being said, this Il Fornaio, located in the revitalized New York, New York casino, was not crowded at all (for sunday brunch) and everything was very passable.

Desperate for sustenance we somehow stumbled upon this oasis in the sea of madness.  

Price for Vegas, more than reasonable.  Atmosphere, inside was sublime, a break away from the noise and flash of the casino.  Bread delivered with a high quality olive oil for dipping. Impeccable service.  The sight and smells of chickens roasting and spinning over a wood fired oven.

There happened to be thunderstorms that had passed by locally during the morning hours and so I don't know if that caused this place to be so busy on this particular morning,  but the people behind the counter seemed to be a little overwhelmed by the wave of people waiting for coffee and pastries...

The croissants here are not very good, they are more like bread and very heavy and doughy.  I had a ham, cheese, and egg croissant and I couldn't taste the ham, it was mainly poorly scrambled egg. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CuohP_W_UJoUowNN3TRpMg?select=5RMTiaPNBW4I2jxk7rXw8A  The cheese was very bland it there was any at all.  I've been more satisfied with the breakfast croissant at Jack-n-the-Box than at this place.  The cafe latte that I ordered was not very good either, it was scalding hot and tasted pretty thin as if there was too much water...

I told you that they seemed to be pretty overwhelmed in back;  neither the regular small tables that littered the side of this small outpost of Il Fornaio nor the communal table in the middle were tended to or cleaned up after, we had to fend for ourselves and wipe up any leftover crumbs or spills from previous patrons...

It was not bad, mind you, but it also was not exceptional like other Italian restaurants in the area.  It was also pricey, but considering it overlooked the casino and was directly on the strip, a price hike is expected.

I ended up having a caesar salad and chicken fettuccine alfredo, and shared some red wine with my dining party.  The food was filling and the alfredo sauce was very solid, but nothing blew me out of the water.  

There are in fact better Italian restaurants for the same price on the strip.  There are truly better Italian restaurants off the strip for better prices if you want to venture out.  I would recommend taking the 10-15 cab ride off the strip to a local Italian establishment rather than settling here, but if you really need to eat at Il Fornaio it would not be your worst meal in Vegas.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,q08btZcADuygyagvn7kVxQ

They take reservations which is nice.  We had tickets to a show and I was concerned about the logistics of navigating Vegas on a Friday night.  

The restaurant is bright and airy and pleasing enough.  you are served a verity of bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The bread was cold which surprised me, most Italian restaurants I've been to warm the bread.  There was one particular roll in the basket that we really liked and were brought a basket of just those.  

I ordered the spaghetti balognese  which was good but really nothing to write home about.  My wife ordered chicken parmigiana which is an off the menu item.  Despite that, it was served quickly and was VERY good.  

They had a pretty good wine list and while some of their selections are quite over priced by bottle, we found one that we were familiar with which I actually thought was even a bit under priced considering.   

While we enjoyed our experience here, it is overall entirely too expensive.  Believe it or not, it was actually the bottle if wine that I thought was reasonably priced.  

There is another place in the casino called Nine Fine Irishmen.  While it is also too expensive, the overall experience is enough to make me overlook the cost (to a certain extent).  Il Fornaio just does not offer the same benefit.

Ordered artichoke, proscuitto (dont care spelling) and mushroom pizza as always its good. Calamari was bomb. Service sucked the big apple.
Strike one: They didnt even bring us water even though every fucking table had it. I had to flag a bus boy to bring us.
Strike two: The waiter incorrectly stated I did not order 1 entree that did not come. It was late, I was with family, I didnt want to argue but I clearly did, it was the seafood pasta dish. He even said it for me when I couldnt pronounce it, and he said I didnt fucking order it!
3rd strike was my son asked for lemon wedges for his calamari...never arrived.

3449508,2010-05-04,0,Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA,"We drove from Phoenix for a midweek getaway with some friends in Las Vegas. We got in a little late and after a much-needed nap we decided around 11PM we were starving. After walking the strip we found the only seemingly-tasty eatery open at the New York-New York. Oh boy.

They were very open, so it wasn't like we came in like inconsiderate morons right before closing. Our section was very understaffed; one elderly man taking orders, filling waters, and serving food to literally everyone dining at that hour. He was still really friendly and it got our hopes up.

Iced tea was alright. Refills started lagging and I really understood however was bummed, because the food was all very, very... very salty. The bread was good, I always feel weird dipping bread into plain oil though, like one of those things Americans think is really upscale and authentic but it's really just something cranked out of the obese arteries that also crank out nasty 'Italian' chain restaurants like Macaroni Grill..

We each started with a house salad. $10 at Il Fornaio gets you a pile of floppy browning lettuce doused in Kraft Italian dressing. Literally. Unimpressive. 

Husband ordered the penne with vodka sauce and I ordered the lobster ravioli with cream sauce. Ha.. ha.. ha.. After a 45-minute wait after the salads were cleared, we were served the worst excuses for pasta. My 11-year old sister could make better pasta. I guess to Il Fornaio, 'cream sauce' means 'brown gravy flavored with fish'. I guess 'vodka sauce' is Easy Mac sauce with a sour aftertaste. My lobster was horrid. I'm not sure what it reminded me of, but it was so tough, like overcooked shrimp. It looked like overcooked shrimp too. Our entrees were so unappetizing we just gave up. Let me add that my husband has been in military training for the past year and is completely used to less-than-gourmet, and even he couldn't eat this stuff.

Disclaimer: I am not against paying top dollar for food that deserves it [the next night we had a grade-A experience at Shibuya which ran us almost double]. This food deserved maybe ten bucks, total, because it reminded me of Bertolli frozen pasta dinners. But we got stiffed for $80 [before tip] for this hot mess. I think it's pretty obvious when food is unsatisfactory, but rather than asking if something was wrong with our food [as the other restaurants demanding this amount of money do], joked he wasn't taking our plates until we ate at least half of each our dishes.

I'm going to make this easy for everyone: Il Fornaio is good if all you're used to is Olive Garden.",xg6MSYJfqjvXUGl90lNoRQ,0,0,1,RciWszzt2_EiJvwZu0tOwA

And the food isn't doing it any favors either.

We started with the calamari, which is Italian for salty octopus parts (or at least from my experience here, it must be). The tentacles are always my favorite and they were overly crispy to the point of being burned. There wasn't much redeeming about it.

Then after the salty sea, we split the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were the tiniest meatballs I've ever seen, and in comparison the ikea meatballs were WAY more juicy and meaty.

Both are inside of the building.

The food is great.  I don't eat meat and my husband certainly does.  Both of us have tried multiple dishes and have returned on subsequent Las Vegas Trips.  I believe we've eaten here 5 times?  

I'll continue to eat here because the food is great, the waiters are very nice and the ambiance is fun.  Unlike other Italian places in Las Vegas, you can dress casually and comfortably and fit right in.  

Note: I typically choose 'regular' menu items and not specials for two reasons:
1) Specials are usually meat-based.
2) They're usually experimental which is why they're not on the main menu.

Two trips ago I did try the special: some angel-hair pasta with eggplant.  I was pleased there was a vegetarian option and I'm in Vegas to gamble anyway so... why not?

I was seated for my 5 PM reservation immediately.  The place was almost empty so I should have been.  I was asked my choice of eating on the casino facing patio or inside.  I chose inside.

My server, Carol, soon came to the table with bread and EVOO and balsamic vinegar.  She poured some EVOO onto a dish and then asked if I wanted any balsamic.  Thank you!  I don't like it when the two are mixed together on a bread plate. The bread basket had some focaccia and two rolls.  

She took my iced tea order and within a minute, the bus person working with her was at my table with the drink and some sweetener.  

I had looked at the menu online but she pointed out the daily specials menu.  After looking that over, I changed my mind as to the main course.  For a starter, I ordered the grilled polenta with mushrooms and sheep's milk cheese.  The dish was very good.  The polenta with the mushrooms and the cheese made a great combination.

The main course is where I changed my mind.  I ordered off the specials menu the shell pasta in a gorgonzola cream sauce with sliced prosciutto. green peas, and topped with toasted walnuts.  The gorgonzola sauce was excellent and the addition of the crispy prosciutto and toasted walnuts gave it a great flavor and wonderful texture.  I'm glad they had the specials menu.  The pasta was brought to the table very hot.  

For dessert, I got the crema al doppio gusto.  The menu describes it as fennel-infused custard with chocolate mousse and caramelized sugar topping.  The dessert had the fennel custard on the bottom and was topped with the chocolate mousse and then a thin layer of sugar that had been caramelized with a torch.

During the meal, Carol was attentive.  She checked in several times during my time there to make sure everything was OK.  The bus person removed dishes promptly and refilled my iced tea 3 times always without having to ask.  Outstanding.

You'll find the typical items on their breakfast menu like coffee, pastries, eggs, pancakes, and fruit.  Breakfast at II Fornaio is just okay and the portions are on the smaller side.  I recently dined here with my girlfriend and her cousins.  Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  It was a Friday night and that kind of stuff happens.  Once seated, we looked through our menus.  I was actually surprised that II Fornaio had a lot more than just Italian food for dinner.  Il Fornaio offers a pre fixe meal for about $30, which includes salad or soup, main entrée, and dessert.  This is not a bad deal at all.  I wasn't craving Italian, steaks, or anything on their pre fixe menu. So, I ended up with their mixed seafood dish, the Grigliata di Pesce Misto for $30.95.  This meal includes salmon, seabass, calamari, scallops, prawns, potatoes, and broccolini.  This is one of those dishes that sounded good on paper and the portions were really small.  The bigger issue was that half of my dish was okay, while the other half wasn't prepared correctly.  The salmon and the seabass wasn't fully cooked.  Both were grilled on the outside and still raw on the inside.  I was starving and figured that it's no different than sushi.  So, I ate it and didn't even mention it.  The good news...the rest of the dish was cooked.

We were seated right away, surprising for 9:30 on a Thursday night. There was good mood lighting, and I suppose this would be a good place to have a date.

They gave us bread upon seating and it was pretty damn good. Soft sourdough slices with some olive oil really hit the spot. Service was a bit slow throughout the night but we got our food pretty quickly.

Dinner:

Porterhouse steak- I know porterhouse isn't the best cut of beef you can get but damn... Im not a steak eater but this was good. It took my breath away. Buttery, smooth, flavorful. Made me a believer. I don't even know what to say...

Pollo Tuscan- Buttery and tender. Really good, light meal. Came with garlic/Rosemary potatoes and thin carrots. Solid meal. Personally, I would take the sourdough bread (see above) and shove some chicken in between...

Tiramisu- Top 5 best tiramisus I've had

We consider it one of the fewer locations on this part of The Strip where you can eat a decent sandwich. Meaning that not only the ingredients are fresh and the way it should be, but also the bread. It almost ressembles a proper Italian bakery.

In the little shop they serve sandwiches (dine in or out), pastries and small hot Italian dishes. All made from scratch. Unfortunately the coffee is not like Italians make it, but hey, this is Vegas baby! Not Rome.

Tip: you can ask for your sandwich to be pressed. If you do, make sure to  ask them to make it extra hot. We've noticed that if you don't the outside is very hot, but the inside is still cold. They serve really thick sandwiches.

Both in the little shop as in the restaurant the service is Italian. It doesn't bother us. Real American's might do.

Because of the prices, the Italian service and the coffee I'm not able to give five stars. For two sandwiches a hot tea and a fresh orange juice we paid almost $32. Even for Vegas stiff.

Delicious Cioppino (Tuscan-style fish soup with monkfish, seabass, mussels, clams, scallops, prawns, tomato and herbs).

Very good Fiadoni Di Pietro (salmon stuffed spinach ravioli) - the saffron sauce was awesome.

4156189,2014-12-27,0,Lau3N654yNyWdIIybea1uA,"Il Fornaio was conveniently located in the downstairs of my room in NYNY and, after walking by it several times, my friend and I decided to eat dinner there on December 23rd.  

First, our waitress was extremely nice and attentive.  Our water glasses were constantly filled, our request for more oil and vinegar came immediately, empty plates were cleared off the table quickly.  I really appreciated our waitress' attentiveness and outstanding service.

Second, the inside dining area was beautiful and quiet.  It had an outstanding atmosphere for conversation.  The place was incredibly clean, spacious and chique.   I  thought the restaurant was a bit too dark but I guess it created a more intimate ambiance. 

Third, the food was outstanding and, with the special 3-course meal for $33, we thought it was very reasonably priced.  The bread served to us at the beginning was crisp outside and soft delicious inside.  

What did I order? I cannot remember (let alone pronounce) the fancy Italian words so bear with me as I describe the items I ordered. The appetizer was a flatbread which was almost the size of an A4 paper covered with toppings and lots lots lots of delicious cheese.  The main consisted of spinach, grilled chicken and potatoes. The spicy sauce was really the superstar of that plate.  It was too bad that I ran out of sauce halfway though my chicken. Next time, more sauce please!  And, finally, for my dessert, I ordered the tiramisu - a large square-shaped decadent light fluffy cake with layers of rich creamy coffee filling.  

If there's anything to improve, I'd say the portions have to be smaller.  Strange how my feedback contradicts the complaint from a previous reviewer saying the portions were too small?  I found the appetizer was far too large and (combined with the bread at the beginning) I've eaten too many carbs that, by the time I reached my main, I was already full and couldn't enjoy it as much.  By the time dessert came, I was full beyond comfort and had to pack it up.  

Overall - I enjoyed the dining experience at Il Fornaio and would recommend it to everyone (who isn't on the Atkins diet!!!!)",i0tH5AyboWPRiCQB31s5_g,0,0,4,EcNj-9eTL-K3j_dtyBSBJg

...until we entered NYNY's Little Italy and saw it was Il Fornaio. Now, I had been to the Il Fornaio in Coronado and it was a horrible experience for me (http://www.yelp.com/biz/il-fornaio-coronado-2#hrid:ba8JuHA3NGLfZWqt9HWEcA). I hurriedly warned my friends about the bad food and slow service for this place's chain, but they brushed me off by assuring me this is the best pasta in town.

Wrong. Although the service was not as slow as the one in Coronado, the food portions were super small. Because my friend and I knew we didn't want to spend $20+ for a pasta dish here, we had agreed to split, which made the already small portions even smaller. We had some linguine with vodka sauce and it was bland and meh. We each only got to eat around 3 small slices of sausage which were nothing special as well. I only left without remaining hungry because I'd decided to fill my stomach with their bread and dip to get my money's worth.

However, the worst part came when we were leaving Il Fornaio. While we were waiting for our credit card receipts, one of our friends was looking at the ""menu stand"" restaurants sometimes have outside for advertisement. Well, he accidentally knocked it over and we discovered what was behind the stand. There was a ""C"" rating for Il Fornaio's health inspection. WHAT?! I have NEVER been to a C-rated restaurant. And what's worse is that they even tried to hide it with their menu board. Wow, I felt like we had been scammed. 

Il Fornaio, you have once again disappointed me. I will never get dragged to any of your other chains again, even if it means standing outside waiting for my friends to finish their food while my stomach grumbles in hunger.",HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw,4,0,1,Lu8IEsvQOff4BE6db7iWfg

The bread was delicious and I could tell the olive oil was a decent quality. Not the best I've ever had, but for the price point certainly not the worst. We did have to ask for cheese, but they brought it over right away. As with every single restaurant in Vegas they are slow with water service. I guess they want people to pass out?

The pollo al peperoncino sounded so amazing all 3 of us ordered it. It was chicken marinated with rosemary, sage, thyme, crushed red pepper, white wine, Dijon mustard and lemon. It was really good! The chicken was so tender and cooked perfectly. 

I'm sure the pasta was better (just a preference) but I knew I needed protein and to lay off the carbs! The sautéed spinach and potatoes served with the dish were a bit of a let down. 

I felt for the prices this was one of the better meals I had in Vegas this go around. The entrees were in the $18-26 range. I've had sub sandwiches in food courts in Vegas cost more than that.

In fact, it was slightly tricky to eat since the ""crust"" [a term I will use loosely here] was neither foldable nor particularly firm.

The table itself was too small and the waiter was very slow and forgetful.  When the pizza came out, as the guy sliced it he knocked into a glass and spilled a bit-- a combination of tiny table and clumsiness, though I'm not factoring ""these things happen"" in to my impression.

I would go back to try out lunch or dinner.  I have had dinner once at an Il Fornaio in Seattle and it was pretty good.

I have visited this location on two separate dates over the past ten years and both times the experience was dismal. While the food is passable (the noodles seem to be fresh and the bread is quite good), the service is what makes this place so awful.

The first time I visited was with a group of friends before attending a concert across the street at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. They didn't seem too busy and the wait wasn't long so we all agreed to eat there.

I ordered a standard alfredo, the sauce was great as well as the noodles. A friend of mine asked for Dr. Pepper and the waiter informed us, ""We don't carry Dr. Pepper, this is Las Vegas."" (Possible he didn't know we were all local and well-aware that Dr. Pepper is indeed readily available in Las Vegas).

About ten years later, my boyfriend and I went for our first anniversary dinner. I again stuck with the alfredo, but it arrived with chicken. I hate sending food back, but being vegetarian, I had to. The waiter brought back the plate with the chicken on it and insisted that's what I had ordered. I let him know that I haven't eaten meat in over 15 years, so I was pretty sure I hadn't ordered chicken. He scoffed and asked if it was okay if he just removed it. I politely declined.

My partner and I thought we'd give it a try mid week, with no need to make reservations.

The food was quite good for the price paid. Slightly classy Italian with decent selection of appetisers and breads. The serving sizes were perfect and we didn't require ice cream or coffee afterward.

***HOWEVER, there were a few issues we had with our dining experience. The primary issue was with service. The restaurant was almost empty when we arrived and we were both told to ""wait outside and you will be seated immediately""... What they didn't mention was that we had to wait for the floor staff to finish laughing amongst themselves before nothing to seat us.

Once finally seated we looked through the menu, chose our meals and twiddled our thumbs and yawned a few times before the waiter came back (20 minutes later) with water and the free bread we were meant to receive on arrival...? He had forgotten to get the oil and vinegar for the breads so we ordered our food and waited for our oil.

10 minutes later a lady who couldn't understand much english came along with the oil and poured it all over the place (yes, this was a language barrier issue - the oil was everywhere like a crime scene), and we spent a few moments giving the place a good wipe down in preparation for the meal.

The mains were actually quite timely once we disregard the other delays... Although I did spend a further 5 minutes figuring out where the restroom was in the casino (why the f*ck there wasn't one in the restaurant I will never know)..

As stated above the meals were fine......

Once we were finished we spent about 5 minutes staring into space yawning before we walked to the bar to ask for our bill. The bill eventually came along, it wasn't too bad.

Would I go there again? No. Was the food great? Yes. Do they need to sort out their staff? Yes. Did we tip them? HELL NO.",jcizyDik1D0g5q4vRWMpIw,3,1,2,QFTiiN4iM9XSGNl-hCD1og

I ended up picking at it, but not eating it.
My mom got the rare veal ($30+), and she also ended up barely eating it because it was just way over-marinated. It still had a vinegary taste to it. I normally love all red meat, and even I didn't like it, so she wasn't just being picky.

SERVICE:
Our server didn't come ask us how the meal was until we were pretty much done picking at it 30 minutes later.

Old world heavy crusted dinner bread made in own bakery on site, tenderloin tip & mushroom risotto was excellent. Breakfast fabulous with of course fresh fruit and real maple syrup. Very solid, very consistent and the most fair pricing in Vegas.",MO-WT5sZW_HXLUwX8yqGaw,0,0,5,kp-6ysggwHGbf8cMQluZ1w

It was the best omelette I have ever had in my life. EXTREMELY FRESH INGREDIENT WARNING.  Omelette came with fresh crunchy asparagus spears, zucchini, and fresh broccoli florets.  UNBELIEVABLE.

1) Very long wait, and attitude.

2) Ordered cioppino, dish half filled with broth and probably about 3 tiny pieces of seafood, I think it was over $30 for this. When I asked is this cioppino, and Ive never seen it like this , was told all restarants prepare it differently.

2b) I sent it back (and I never do this to dishes) and ordered a pizza instead, and even the pizza was very weak. Trust me, if you went to the real New York, you'd be hard pressed to find worst pizza. Go to Rays, the pizza is $2 a slice, and WAYYYYYYYY better. There are much better than Rays too! 

3) Menu selection horrid. 

4) Sometimes, you pay for atmosphere, The atmosphere here was nothing special, I have no clue how they remain open.

Go to Noras instead , about a zillion times better, authentic Italian.

Our server walked by. Repeatedly.  He never asked  how the meal was. He never asked if we would like pepper or ground cheese on the salad. He never stopped. Not once. Close to 40 minutes had passed and our dirty dishes sat in front of us still. 

My husbands meal came with desert so we anticipated the waiter returning with that if not with the check and to pick up our dishes.  Eventually we flagged him
over and he picked up our dishes.  He brought my husbands desert and still never inquired about our meal and didn't offer me desert but my husband requested it. 

He came back to the table and set down two plates and two tattered teaspoons and walked away without even making eye contact. As a footnote:  we both had cake for desert and neither of us typically eat cake with teaspoons.

It's bad enough that a cool looking hotel and casino from the outside (talking about New York New York here) has absolutely NOTHING to do on the inside. This is one of the only restaurants in the entire place and it sucked. There was a line to be seated that was pretty long. We truly thought that the place was spectacular because of it. It was our friends wedding night and they wanted to get a good dinner as did we. This place is over priced (it's Vegas), portions are tiny and the food is BLAND!

Not to mention, our waiter was exceptionally rude. He didn't want to explain anything to us (seriously, reading that menu is like reading a foreign language), it took him 15 minutes to bring us our bread and oil and balsamic, and he did not once offer any refills (I was afraid to even ask in fear that they'd charge us for refills)

On the good side, took our reservations and when we showed up on time we were promptly seated.   Also, they had a very nice Carpaccio appetizer.   That was well done.   That was it... no more good.

On the bad side,  all of the dinners were rather bland and tasteless.   My wife's lamb chops were nothing to write home about.   Several of us had pasta.   My chicken, bacon and cheese pasta had cheese and maybe a speck or two of bacon.   The chicken must have out run the chef that day.   It was nowhere to be seen.   The server forgot my friend's order, although she did write them all down.  So he had to wait while they rushed his order through which left him to snack on bread as he waited.  Oh wait, the bread was emptied in the first 5 minutes we were there, and no refills on bread or water.   (Wow, I felt like I was in jail!)  When his meal finally came, it was more than Al Dente... it was almost stiff!   The next time we saw any server, it was to present us with the bill.   Oh well.

We came here just as we were leaving to come home from our trip to Las Vegas and as someone who is known to be rather picky when it comes to Italian food, honestly this might not have ever even got onto my list - but I'm glad it did.  We were actually in a bit of a hurry, and I did a Yelp search for close places in our hotel, and this came up.  As is often the case, once you filter out the outliers in the reviews, you actually come up with some helpful ones and it seems there are some who can appreciate what is actually pretty decent/authentic Italian food considering the venue.

Service was very friendly and fast on our visit, and while I agree this place lacks a little in atmosphere maybe, it is in a theme hotel so using that as a primary judgment seems short sighted.

Food was good too, we had....

Uova Con Pancetta Affumicata
Omelette Alla Contadina

Both were good, particularly the apple-wood smoked bacon in both dishes, and the filone toast that came with them was great too.  Good coffee as well which was well needed before our travels home for the day.

Perspective people!  This is Las Vegas, it is not Italy (and no the Venetian does not count either - but it's a good hotel).  Good thing too, because those whining about slow service would probably find it even slower and annoying if they really did go to Italy, not all folks are in a super hurry all the time, I'm actually glad for times when I'm not as well!",jpLGApN7hQG2ZeTV0FKhjw,1,0,4,v_A7LB8w7_YNQIjJdYvvdw

 Before I go on, I have to say that I've been to the Il Fornio in Irvine, CA multiple times and  that place deserves 5 out of 5 stars. 

After feeling nostalgic for our old hunting grounds in Orange County, we decided to visit the Il Fornio in New York New York.  Here's my review:

1. Environment: Entertaining. 

We were seated in their indoor ""balcony."" The balcony area was quaint and I love the lamp posts surrounding the area.  But most of all, the balcony gave as an amazing for people watching.  Because the balcony is located inside the casino, the people watching was varied and very entertaining.  

2. Service: Sufficient.

Our waiter as very friendly.  But because CES was in town this weekend, the restaurant was pretty busy and we hardly saw our waiter.  Thank goodness for the waters, or we would have been out of drinks during the middle of our dinner.  

Our order was correct and the waiter was friendly.  

3. Food: Meh.

I had the Cannelloni al Forno.  Weirdly, parts of the dish were hot and parts of the dish were cold.  Too bad too.  The dish would have been promising if it didn't have that weird hot/cold thing going on.

I'm not going to completely write off this place because I know how good this restaurant can be.  However, this location is not very high on my Restaurant list.",YG54z87sI6jQTjaqW14Emw,1,0,2,SwBMSN-y93D7hej8ouFOtg
