Their outside, window menu has tons of dietary details for each of their items. Their motto is ""Fresh Thinking, Healthy Eating.""

You order what kind of meat combination you want in your pita (vegetarian options available). Then while they heat that up on a flat top, you tell them everything that you want inside your pita. It's set up pretty much like a subway. For example, I got lettuce, spinach, avocado, mushrooms, cucumbers, banana peppers, feta cheese and I choose the caesar chicken which also included bacon and caesar dressing. Once everything is in your pita pocket, they roll it up so that you can get a bite of everything all at once. It basically looked like a burrito.

I got a combo which included my pita sandwich, chips & a drink. The girl asked if I go to UNLV and she gave me a rebel discount. She did not even ask for my Rebelcard ID. It came out to $8.46.

My pita sandwich was SOOOOO GOOD!!!! I think the part that shocked me the most was how juicy my chicken was. Usually, grilled chicken has a bad habit of being dry, but not here.

Only complaint was that I couldn't even tell I had any bacon in there. In fact, I forgot until I got to a bite which was pretty much all bacon.

The staff was very friendly and the inside of the restaurant was very clean. I look forward to going back and trying more combinations of pita sandwiches! I think this place will be very successful, especially for those who are health conscious. Vegetarians will love this new option.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,1,1,5,G8F_EkSkekPtCQD-J0RT7Q

The one in Sacramento used to skewer their chicken and Grill it. They would have it stored in a cooler and then refire the chicken with the Soulvaki sauce. It was nice real chunks of chicken that had crispy edges. I used to be addicted to this place while I was in college because it was so hot and fresh.

When 10:30am rolled around, I headed there. The guy behind the counter was friendly and I ordered a breakfast pita - the Morning Glory (Eggs, Hashbrowns, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions & Green Peppers, Cheddar Cheese). I paid for my pita and waited for the guy to make my food.

If you're a vegetarian, vegan, or simply like having a plethora of vegetables for your sandwiches, you will probably love Pita Pit.  The black bean patty is excellent and makes for a substantial sandwich.  The base of your sandwich (falafel, meat, veggie option, etc.) is always cooked fresh.  Pita Pit also allows you as many vegetable toppings as you want, without charging you extra for items such as artichokes, hummus, or avocado (unlike Cafe Rio next door that nickel and dimes you for just about everything).  The pita is very large but thin enough that you don't get too much bread.  Customer service has been excellent every time I've been in there.

My only beef - hehehe - would be some of the meat options.  The souvlaki was excellent, but the heated deli meats wind up tasting pretty weird. I gave in and tried a Dagwood.  It probably would have been better without grilling.

In short, I really do like this place and highly recommend it.  It's more affordable than other options nearby, like Einstein's and Cafe Rio, and you get more food for your money.",8SN6B3cUKkonmN2WEabjyA,0,0,4,M71-v1UmfyT6nB3R6JwzMQ

So far, I've had the ""meat the day"" breakfast pita which comes with Italian sausage, bacon, and eggs. It's hearty, tasty, and you can get it whenever. You can then get lettuce, spinach, mushrooms, and onions - in other words, a breakfast salad rolled into something better than a tortilla. This whole process takes less than five minutes and I've never had to wait in line too long so far.

I had their local pita, chicken chipotle, which was delicious. The other nice thing is there's no extra charge for guacamole, and with sour cream, this thing was out of control. They do have an excellent selection of sauces, so you can find anything that fits your fancy. 

I've been in there everyday this week and if they had fresh juice, I'd have to put in a request to have my office located here.",umZPUpLSJuCTXLckxA4nmg,3,1,5,QsseU87JzoDaWkYuLco5Sg

I love Pita Pit! They started in Canada back in '97 and I used to go there all the time after clubbin' when I lived in Toronto, during college. I can't believe we just got our first one here in Vegas.... and its a 5 min. walk from my work. GOOD JOB putting it next to the university to feed those hungry students. now can you put another location on Fremont street where its hard to get a healthy bite to eat? 

The pita bread is awesome, thin but soft and chewy, there are 3 times as many toppings to choose from compared to subway, and none of them except for cheese and meat cost extra!  Im excited to try all the breakfast pitas, that's next. I good one of my co-workers there this afternoon and she LOVED it. She and I are going back tomorrow!

Its perfect for those trying to eat healthy, lots of veggies to choose from, not as much bread as a sub, and great Vegetarian/Vegan options.  Even though I'm not a vegan I like to get the falafal pita, it was my long time favorite back home. they stuff that thing with falafal, I honestly didn't expect that much food in it.

UPDATE: You don't get all the veggie fixin's with the breakfast pitas! be warned so to not be dissapointed. if you really want guac an tomato and stuff with your eggs and bacon make sure to tell them at the register and pay a little extra.",oUE-E24uKX9WluyW145ndg,2,1,5,mwKiqe-QImvPsqZ3Ma1G2A

Come here for a small, fresh lunch, but don't come starving (unless you're ready to spend). It appears to be vegetarian/vegan friendly. I just wanted fresh veggies. The décor is an annoying whimsical cartoon of the ingredients, but the staff ran it like a mom and pop. By that I mean it's a little disorganized and left me feeling questionable. Despite that I enjoyed my food. I ordered the BLT. They asked me what I wanted in it. The menu says what is in it. So I said, ""everything."" No, you have to still go through and say what you want (like Zaba's). That's cool in that you can get extra stuff without paying extra. It's weird because it's bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo. They cooked the bacon in front of me (neato). The bacon was not like thick, pepper dream-bacon. It was thin and crispy, but it was good. When she was stuffing my whole wheat pita though I felt like she wasn't putting enough greens in there. Regretfully, I didn't say anything. My lover ordered chicken souvlaki salad. It too did not have enough greens. It was like when you open a bag of chips and it's just air and crumbs at the bottom. He really enjoyed the meat and the dressing (horseradish). But after spending about $20 I thought we would be full. If they changed the portions I'd be back because it tasted great.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,1,1,3,LOL2U_7zPBI1LV8EFBkDpQ

Let's just say that after my first visit and eating my first Chicken Souvlaki, I proceeded to have Pita Pit for lunch and dinner the following THREE DAYS. I became an addict *snap* just like that.

For extra details:

- My ultimate favorite is the Chicken Souvlaki. My second is the Chicken Crave. But with so many options, I always come up with new combinations that taste great! 

- Great for salads too! Since the meat they use is well seasoned, tender, and cooked to perfection, your salad will always taste fantastic.

- Pita Card. Get one! You'll rack up points in no time and be able to redeem them for free pitas!! It also doubles as a gift card so you can load cash onto it!

- Delicious break from the crap at the UNLV student union! Cheaper than Cafe Rio!

We found it by accident when we were planning on eating at the fantastic Greek restaurant Stefano's in the same shopping center. We were saddened when we found out that Stefano's is closed on Sunday but this was definitely the next best thing.

I wavered between 3 & 4 stars on this one. Let's start with the positives: fresh ingredients,  speedy service. Negatives: only 1 worker on weekends, the food was good but not great. I would recommend this place if you are craving a gyro and need something quick. Even with only 1 worker she was very fast and very courteous.

They offer a quite generous student discount, and the employees were all pleasant. I did not expect it to stand out as much as it did, in terms of quality and taste, but I was surprised.

3438053,2013-02-26,0,3RiFtEJ6AAvS0x_z38HChw,"A previous reviewer described this franchise as the subway of pita sandwiches. What's the major, glaring difference? The food here tastes about ten times better.

It's not exactly cheap, as a pita tends to run anywhere from 6-8 bucks. You can do the extra meat or whatever if you're feeling extra hungry. Obvious bear says what? (What?!) This particular location largely caters to the UNLV crowd right across from the street and the workers appear to be students themselves. They've been polite and helpful everytime I stopped by-- making sure to answer questions and describe menu items that were unclear. Business seems modest here but I imagine they are getting by just fine during the rush hours.

The basic business model is this-- you pick the type of meat and then customize it in front of an assortment of chopped vegetables ala subway. I love that they offer a wheat pita, and alfalfa sprouts. Other choices include romaine lettuce, roasted tomatoes, cucumbers, and banana peppers. Among sauces you can opt for a tsatziki sauce (a good idea with chicken souvlaki), hummus, or various other sauces including chipotle mayo, ranch etc. Among cheese options, they wisely include feta and pepper jack.
The local special is barbecued chicken, grilled with jalapenos and onions. It went well with chipotle mayo and green peppers.
I've also tried the chicken souvlaki, and I thoroughly enjoyed the grilled steak. Depending on how much, or what sort of sauces you choose to add to your creation, you can leave with something that is pretty darn healthy for fast food and doesn't taste half bad. If you are at all conscious about what sort of foods you eat, you'll find this place to be a refreshing choice.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,1,0,4,J979zVpUbCCH211B2CO2Sw

It's a chain, as I used to have Pita Pit in college when I attended the University of Nevada in Reno, I know this to be true. I remember being highly addicted to the pitas here based off the fact I could get so many add-ins for no additional money. I could basically stuff my pita so full of romaine lettuce, spinach, banana peppers, mushrooms, cucumbers, and all kinds of tasty sauces I wouldn't have to eat for a whole day because I'd be so full. And that was kind of the point - as a poor college student, paying almost $10 for a combo meal at Pita Pit was like... half my beer budget for happy hour at the bar down the street. 

As an adult (heh heh) now, and not a college student, Pita Pit is all right. Even with all the stuffing of veggies I can fit into one of these bad boys it's still just all right. By no means was my chicken souvlaki pita bad, it was good, but I've definitely had better Greek food elsewhere. But again, this is Pita Pit, the chain that also serves a Dagwood pita - so can I really base my opinion off of it while comparing it to actual Greek places that specialize in *Greek* only dishes? 

Overall - service was extremely friendly and the guys working here were absolutely fabulous. They accepted my LivingSocial deal quickly and with ease. They were also chatty while making my pita and making me feel welcome. Food - somewhat bland, but it's a chain, so I guess my comparison to more authentic Greek places is somewhat moot.

It's like a subway with pitas. I ordered a gyro pita. The gyro meat is not sliced fresh, it looked like they threw a few pieces of rubber on the grill and chopped it up. The actual pita was really thin, not the thick pitas you are usually used to. They do have the option between white or wheat pitas. Just like subway, you pick what ever toppings you want. I choose lettuce, tomatoes, onions, feta cheese, a smear of hummus and tzatsiki sauce. The hummus was gritty like sand, kinda nasty. The tzatsiki was thick but it needed salt and more cucumber, it was pretty much just yogurt. The gyro meat actually had some flavor but it wasn't crunchy and juicy it was oily and soggy. I don't even think it was real gyro meat, sadly enough. For just the sandwich it was close to $8 which was not worth the price at all! I'd eat it again if it was like $5, maybe. They do offer a rewards program, you earn points for every dollar spent but you need like 90 points for a free pita sandwich and I highly doubt I'll ever eat here again.

Everyone behind the counter was friendly and very personable and in a city of customer service industry people- super important!",LkRxu8mHFK0JTajmS4pZjA,0,0,4,u6AgbCIyjIED5YFfXdGTeg

Meat was not cooked all the way through (like a microwaved burrito where it was still a little frozen in the middle). Oh, and where are the plates? Service was strange, putting it kindly.

After coming here I have completely RENOUNCED Subway. 
Actually, the fact that Pita Pit and Subway both exist at the same time kind of confuses and angers me. 

Pita Pit gives you WAY more options & variety, and their ingredients are so much fresher. You can add avocado, hummus, tzaziki for no extra cost. 
They freshly prepare their meats on a grill right in front of you.
They have a vegan section of the menu, and I always order the black bean pita which I always stuff full of ingredients until it's really huge. I've taken plenty of non-vegetarians here and they love it. Every time. 

What really gets to me is that it COSTS about the SAME as Subway. Especially since Subway hiked up their prices. Blows my mind.",90Go9OZhKs-5jpagYY8N3Q,2,0,4,ghA4cqCjagPa3wq3vvZsYg

The food was okay, the service was slow but friendly... it wasn't bad or anything... but it just didn't ""do it for me.""  I don't really have the motivation to try different things.  I got a falafel pita, which was okay.  I would probably like something else better, but... meh.  I'm just not feeling it.  I almost feel bad, because for once, I'm lacking any explanation for it!

Pita Pit was a great find as I was in search of a healthy bite to eat.  

We were greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the counter.  He took our order and began making a couple of people's order.  When he got to ours, he calls you over and asked you specifically what you want on your pita, love that customization!  My veggie pita was good and all ingredients were fresh, at least on my pita.  My husband had the gyro which the meat is frozen and is then cooked on the grill to order.   

Prices are reasonable, parking was easy, service was friendly, food was good!",gfR80SvOyWL45S8vPMZxNw,2,2,3,VocVpVEVY9L1T6p3Kacq7w
5659887,2012-09-07,0,3RiFtEJ6AAvS0x_z38HChw,"The Pita Pit chain is the most expensive university food. I'd eaten at the chain when I went to Oklahoma State and I'd say it's for sure the most overpriced sandwich shop near UNLV. It's a good $9-$12 for a meal. Granted, if you actually put vegetables on your sandwich (I put literally everything they offer on mine) you won't need to eat for the rest of the day, but I still. Not cheap for students. 

I've had the gyro (good) and the Dagwood (meh.) I'd stick with the gyro meat. I love that they have a bevy of spreads and sauces, but again, they definitely charge you for it. 

The place is clean, but I've also noticed how employees switch between jobs without changing gloves - which defeats the purpose of the gloves.

Although the food is good, it's too expensive as a student for me to make this a regular stop for me.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,2,3,QUuNofwIhAZsLh2BBLvn_Q
5661262,2014-03-13,1,3RiFtEJ6AAvS0x_z38HChw,"The Pita Pit commercializes a reinvention of the sandwich. Their routine is basically the same you would hear at any other sandwich place, whether you want white or wheat, what toppings, etc, but they have a few refreshing differences.

I ordered a gyro pita pocket.

There are a lot more choices of spreads, including tsiziki, which is what I picked. To be honest, their tsiziki wasn't anything very special, to me, but it's nice that they offered it. 

There are also a lot of stuffings, too. Some that I found appealing: feta cheese, alfalfa sprouts, and artichoke hearts! Yum! 

After building your pita pocket, they wrap it up in sub paper for you. Personally, I would have appreciated to eat mine in a bowl with a fork and knife because my pita pocket was pretty stuffed, but I managed well enough.

The Pita Pit is the place to stop by if you are craving a fun, healthy meal. Mine definitely filled me up.",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,3,2,4,cy-m4dFIBpyISagO2fhI3g

The great thing about this place is that you choose what type of pita bread you want, and then what you want in your pita (Subway-style)... from a variety of veggies to sauces.  The avocado does not cost extra like at other restaurants, which is nice.  The meat is cooked fresh in front of you and placed inside the pita.

On my way home on a Thursday evening, I stopped at Pita Pit for dinner. I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki on a wheat pita. I was good, but it wasn't great. The place was pretty dead with only one guy working and the toppings for the Pitas (hummus, lettuce, mushrooms, etc) looked like they'd been sitting out for quite some time. This was a disappointment because I'd kept hearing about how ""fresh"" the ingredients at this place are. The server, however was both friendly and helpful in taking my order. And the Pita was decent. I will definitely try it again because it IS a nice alternative to subway and I really want to like this place, but this time I will order the falafel.  And update will be posted at that time. Until then, all I can say is...""It was ok.""",ru1KJdPX4Di-ZCa38XB_JA,1,0,3,2I_ODihrie-j_xZJ0I3H5w

Although I haven't been for breakfast, steak and eggs is next on my list to try. We like to stop by after using the UNLV gym, as the location is very close to campus, easily within walking distance from any of the residence halls. There are pre-configured items on the menu, but the best part about this place is that everything is customizable! They have nearly two dozen sauces to adorn any type of pita you like. Certain pitas come with different meat choices or vegetarian options. Once you choose the base of your pita, you get to customize it with a wide selection of veggies, spreads, cheeses, and of course the sauces. You can be as healthy or as indulgent as you want to be, which is something I love in a restaurant! I would definitely recommend Pita Pit for eaters of any taste preference.",FX6SQ1GhLf2O_J1JnrfjkQ,1,0,5,oJjnouMnA_Z084i9d47X9A
