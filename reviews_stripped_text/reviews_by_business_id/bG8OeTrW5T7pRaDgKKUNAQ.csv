43992,2011-11-14,0,bG8OeTrW5T7pRaDgKKUNAQ,"I was thoroughly disappointed.  I expected higher standards from an brand organization like Wolfgang Puck and chose that restaurant over Chillis Too that was across the lobby - big mistake. I ordered a Turkey club and received a sandwich with processed meat instead of real turkey after waiting over 10 minutes for my sandwich.  There appear to bit of disorganization chaos with the staff.  Rather than making my sandwich, one staff member spent over 2 minutes calling for a order pickup that was never picked up.  I assumed the customer had a flight to catch and couldn't wait for the confusion to clear and left.  There were 3 people making pizza while one part time person making sandwiches and doing kitchen cleanup and chores.

First the service was horrible.  I asked the cashier (no waiters) if I had to take a premade salad or if they would make one fresh for me and she insisted that I had to take a premade one if I ordered it, then the guy behind me ordered one and it was made fresh for him.

The salad was alright but still premade for a plane so it had the usual browning of the edges of the lettuce.  The pizza I ordered had a soggy crust and was drenched in olive oil.  To top it off it was piled at least an inch high with raw onions.  My friend got a pizza that had five heaping tablespoons of raw garlic on it.  WTF?  Wolfgang got his start doing upscale pizzas; he should know better.  Where is the quality control?

For twenty bucks I could have got 4 subs at Quizno's and each would have been consistently good, but at WPE, all $20 bought me was disappointment and the taste of raw onions all the way home.

Definitely skip this place.",f7QQEQB3xt-2cowTyk9sbg,3,0,1,sJKBiMdjmSRdakkjk60SqQ

On a long layover I was desperate for something fresh and delicious. So desperate in fact that I decided to make the trip over from terminal C to terminal D (fyi it's near gate D17). Decor is not particularly exciting and it has a kind of lame sports bar vibe, but don't let that deter you from ordering the delicious (albeit a touch pricey) food. 

I had just come off a week of junk eating so I was ridiculously happy to see their various salad choices. I skipped over the meaty salad options and decided on something a little lighter ie. kale and quinoa salad. Sounds leafy and terribly boring? To each their own, but this salad gave me life. A nice hearty serving of fresh kale and other finely chopped veg dressed with just the right amount of tangy and bright tasting dressing. I was in salad heaven...yummmmm.

It's not a perfect five because of the lame decor, the paper plate and plastic utensils (hello! for that price I want at least some form of ceramic and metal composite) and the millenial service.",tEOaCH9skExq4-igJBsqyQ,0,0,4,uIWDB4s1JNpFFid57ijx7A

Believe the reviews when they say this place is not quick.  Believe the reviews that say the quality is poor for the price.  But above all else know that THEY HAD NO MUSTARD FOR MY HUSBAND'S HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH!!!

How can you serve a grilled ham and cheese sandwich and not have mustard?  So they do not have mustard and will not take the sandwich back, and my husband is all, ""if you don't have mustard I don't want the sandwich.""  UGH!

We try not to eat tasty garbage (garbage being unhealthy food full of salt, nitrates, fats, chemicals, etcetera) but when we do eat garbage, we want to enjoy it.  ""Without mustard, I am not going to enjoy this; why would I eat it?""  He has a valid point.

Solution, he ends up walking up to the diner in the terminal hub, filling his hand with mustard from a mustard bottle, and bringing it back to the Express to eat his sandwich.  I wish I had thought to take a picture of my husband's hand with a big ass puddle of mustard in it.

The first time I stopped there I was in a rush.  I asked the guy what can I get quick?  He said an egg sandwich.  I thought ""It's a little late in the day for that......""  forgetting that I was on West Coast time. Well I'm always up for breakfast so I said sure.

Dagnabit - when he told me how much $11.25 - I thought ""Well they got me this time but I'll never fall for that again!""
I was wrong!
I have willingly and cravingly (yes, it's a word!) been back several times.

The sandwich comes on 2 HUGE slices of sourdough toast.  The egg is cooked perfectly - not hard and not running down your fingers runny. Perfectly melted cheese and ham (optional).  It also comes with some very tasty breakfast home fries.

I've had a salad with chicken and was very disappointed.  A lot of lettuce and the chicken tasted way pre-made, no pizzaz whatsoever.

The pizza is also very good. 

I see a lot of people get on the flights with some great looking sandwiches.  If it's a flight that I haven't gotten off and grabbed something for myself, I spend the first half of the flight having a severe case of food envy!!

They do a good job balancing the egg and the cheese here, plus throw on some juicy baby tomato slices to counteract the sausage.

One of the cooks gets up, and starts to make... something. I know a pizza can take a while to cook, so I take a seat and relax. Finally, 20 minutes later, the chef in the kitchen calls a number... it's not mine. It's a sandwich... for the other person in the restaurant. 

The guy who ordered this sandwich was sitting at the bar getting drinks from the bartender. He was so drunk he couldn't walk all the way to get his sandwich, so he starts leaning against the walls dragging himself to the counter. He obviously can't make it back to the bar with his sandwich, so the bartender helps him carry it. When he sits down to eat his sandwich, he falls out of his bar stool, and pulls his sandwich down with him. It lands on his face... juicy side down.

The Four Cheese Pizza was my favorite out of all, of course the menu has changed since I was last there. But the zesty pesto sauce, with tomatoes and FOUR types of cheeses on a 9in. pizza. It is really an excellent place to eat for the airport - you can go to pizza hut and spend $6+ on a single size serving but wouldn't you rather spend $9.99 on a 9in. 12 slice pizza to share?... Sandwiches were always one of my favorites - particularly the Pesto Chicken Sandwich... I mean, theres nothing much to explain you would really have to try it yourself to see what I am talking about.. They Also do Free Sampling, so if you are unsure of what to choose of the Chef Designed Menu, feel free to ask for a sample and the Cashier or cook will be more than happy to assist you. 

If your flight is delayed or you just have a few hours to kill, there is also a full service bar for the adults - Bartenders are there to give you one last laugh while in Las Vegas, and again - prices are Wolfgang Puck really are not expensive at all especially for the Airport. They are the same prices as the actual restaurant. 

Cooks take pride in what they do, and the outcome of each dish - I only know this because I did. Seeing the excitement and satisfaction on each guests face as they opened their package to check their order for accuracy would make my shift so much better.

Las Vegas is known to be super glitz and glammy, but the airport itself lacks that kinda flare. 

In the domestic flights terminal, the food court seemed like an absolute ghost town. Barely any shops, sparse food vendors, not even enough chairs to fit the amount of tables present. Felt like I was involved in some sort of zombie apocalypse aftermath, minus the survival guilt. 

After scanning a bit further, I noticed a Wolfgang Puck's Express. Hallelujah and an ameeeen! Some familiarity in my corner! 

I think by now, most all people have either heard, seen, or experienced food from Celebrity Chef, Wolfgang Puck. I mean, he even has canned soups and TV dinners available! 

At this small restaurant, there are pre-packed salads to go, bottled specialty drinks, fresh fruit, and snacks; all available for quick purchase at the register. 

They even have a casual restaurant section for sit down meals offering pizza and sandwiches, beer on tap, vodka shots, and wine if you will.

Having the unpredictability of when my flight was going to take off, I grabbed some snacks and opted for a simple glass of Cabernet from Wolfgang's signature line. 

Prices are steep and expectedly so being located in an airport. 9oz pour was approx. $15.

Service was really attentive and quick. She responded promptly when I asked for the bill and closed the tab. As I was walking back to my gate, everyone had already boarded and I was one of the last few to trickle in.

I ordered the BBQ'd Chicken Pizza and my friend had the Caesar Salad. My pizza had a nice thin crust, juicy chicken and yummy BBQ sauce. I think it might have been a little too oversauced though, because my pizza was quite soggy. It wasn't gross soggy, but I think because of juice of the tomato and the sauce (and it was quite greasy), it turned out to be more soggy than it should have been. It was still quite good though. Loved the cilantro in there too.

My friend had the large caesar salad. No biggie, just a caesar salad. I think it was a little bit overdressed, but that wasn't a huge concern.

Fast and friendly service. Good value for the food. $11 for a huge pizza is pretty good.

3.5/5 stars for me. Would I come back? Probably not. There are so many other places at the McCarran Airport that I would like to try.",oHhrlIDb8YapzCVERNwqvA,0,0,3,3QyjwmPRYOOU00AQ1YIBEA

I've sat down at a table and waited almost 10 minutes and yet no one comes to take orders or take our care. I waited until there was an open spot at the bar. One lady is working and she was kind of rude but she tries not to show it, although it's there. It seems as if I'm wasting her time by sitting there but, i just asked for water and to see the menu and yet the pictures reviews on yelp was a great advice! Because it didn't look that great! Plus the portions seem to be very small and the prices were expansive. I know it's a franchise and it's the name brand but since I didn't get great service or feel as if it's worth my money, I left. I didn't feel bad either. Located in Vegas international airport.",WRgjbLZKODhEZ1--g1VwHA,1,0,1,ue2dnQAu_JbQ0AJJWXH7pw

I needed something to absorb anything stale that was still sitting in my belly.  Props to these guys for having multi-grain bagel breakfast sandwiches that I could munch on.  Not the tastiest breakfast because I found the bagel to be too thick and bready but it did ok in a pinch.",yy_KQA1FtwilaG-7LB4BgA,0,0,3,kPMTnHp2qA2ygfeaK4aIfw
