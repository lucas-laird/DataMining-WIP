If I weren't staying at The Mirage, I probably would have never sought this place out, but alas, we decided to check it out. For whatever reason, I thought it was a sports bar, but when I actually walked into the dining area, I realized how beautiful the atmosphere is.

The food was solid. We got a bunch of apps - yellow tail with jalapeno, the thinly sliced beef with hot rock, crispy calamari, crab cakes, and miso black cod lettuce cups. Each dish was delicious. I could have used bigger portions, but all in all, each dish was very flavorful and stood out in its own right.

Appetizer (these aren't the exact names):

Lobster taco: so-so
Cod lettuce wrap: a little fishy
Stone beef (thin slices of beef cooked on a hot stone): good
Hamachi: decent
Sausage in a blanket: good but oily

Entree:
Filet Mignon: ordered medium and it was good and tender.
Served with a peppercorn and some kind of wine sauce. I used the wine one.

For sides we had the brie tator tots and roasted mushrooms both were good but nothing compared to the main course.  I would've given a 5 start rating except for the ambiance it was really dark indicating a romantic setting but the close quarters and loud music made our neighbors  more interested in our meal than their own and we had to scream to carry on a conversation.

We were going to have a low-key (read: inexpensive) dinner at The Pantry (24-hour restaurant at Mirage), but upon being seated, we decided the atmosphere just wasn't for us (too clangy-noisy, unappetizing menu, low-end ambience, etc.). 

Instead we went to Stack which is an upscale restaurant with a beautiful, wavy sculpted wood interior, and a dimly lit and warm atmosphere. Although the music was a bit too loud (they should reduce the volume when the restaurant has fewer patrons to absorb the sound), the sound quality was good where it doesn't wear on you. 

Our server Zach personified the definition of hospitality. He is super friendly, accommodating, professional and one of those servers who actually enhances your dining experience! We welcomed that after having inhospitable servers at Otto and Mon Ami Gabi who should have been relegated to the back kitchen. Zach advised us on entree and wine selections, was attentive throughout the evening and made our dinner relaxed and fun!

I never got to speak with anyone, but took a photo of my hold time total because I couldn't believe how long I was waiting and I wasn't confident anyone would ever pick up.  I decided to email them and I received an automated response that they would get back to me in 7-10 business days.  It is day 11, and I haven't received any response.  I finally had to dispute it with my credit card company.  I was shocked at the lack of response and unavailability of the credit card disputes department.

If you go between 5-6pm, you can order the pre-theater prix-fixe menu, which at $45 for three courses is a great deal. Best of all, they don't limit you to the non-exciting parts of the menu as happens with many special prix-fix deals.  Instead everything we wanted to order was actually an option (including what is listed above.)

Service was friendly and fast, allowing for a nice meal before seeing the Cirque show, Love.",u2VzJBUdcwQlUDxCGO4wSw,1,1,5,FWT66_yTKl8tMrBnLSl4VQ

Hot Rocks - Yummy..but pricey as hell!  $21 for 5 slices of thinly sliced beef (and not even like waygu beef) that you grill on a..well..HOT ROCK..with sauce on the side.  It's good but so pricey for what it is.   If i end up winning money in vegas, I would probably order it again 

Black Cod Tacos - I'm not even sure if they have this anymore.  Their current menu shows crab.  But this was the BEST dish we ordered.   We initlally ordered the seafood platter, Hot Rocks and something else that probably didn't wow me cuz i forgot.  Might have been seabass.  Anyhoo,  during the end, I decided i was not full at all so i wanted to order these tacos and SO glad i did, they were SOO good.  The best of everything we ordered. 

The bill came out pretty steep for 2 ppl. I'd say after tips, it was about $180 (and again, i was not filled).  To sum it up, the hot rocks was good but way too pricey so booooo.   The best thing we ordered were the tacos (compared to 4 items we ordered).  If they put my black cod tacos back on the menu), i might come back..but after I give other restaurants on the strip a shot.",G744ODvalKuUlplTy3oqaA,0,0,3,3_sjDo7CEBd9qWrwnNf96Q

The seasoning on the steak was subtle but that's how a great piece of meat should be. The star of the steak was the meat!

As far as the customer service, it was great our waiter checked in on us every now and again and the ambiance was perfect.

338719,2009-08-06,1,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Arrgh!  They completely dropped the ball and caused us to be 10 minutes late for the 7:00pm LOVE Cirque du Soleil show.  After making a reservation for 6 people at 5:30pm, and being asked if we were attending any shows or had any time restrictions, I didn't think we had much to worry about, since we sat for dinner, in an empty restaurant at precisely 5:30pm.

The hostess was pleasant and confirmed the showtime as we were being sat, and I was sure to reiterate this time with the person who I originally thought was our server.  We had expected to enjoy the prix fixe show special menu for $30, but was not offered that menu.  When the server came back to finally take a drink order after a 10 minute wait (while he stood talking in the side station with other staff members, well within our view), we asked about the special menu.  He walked away without a word, picked up 'one' special menu and casually dropped it into the center of the table and walked away.

When he came back with drinks and to take our order (he never asked if we had any questions, nor did he offer to explain any highlights or specials), half of our party attempted to order the special menu, and the other half wanted to order a la carte.  The server informed us that it wasn't possible, and that the entire table had to order the special menu.  It is unfortunate that this wasn't mentioned on the phone, because we were all on a budget, and had to go back to the regular menu to choose another meal.

To add insult to injury, I ended up ordering 2 appetizers (spicy crab and black cod), which ended up costing more than the 3 course prix fixe.  For $17, the spicy crab appetizer was the equivalent of 4 tiny 1.5"" square bites, and the black cod (almost identical to the signature NOBU dish, which is phenomenally more delicious & original), was only 3 butter lettuce cups with aprox. 1oz of fish in each one.

Lastly, the $12-$14 cocktails took almost as long as the food to reach the table (again, I reiterate that we were now 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant).  After we ordered coffee, and one dessert (the coffees were spilled all over the saucers and table, and no one ever attempted to apologize or clean up), I reminded the person delivering the coffee to tell my server (for the 3rd time) that we had to leave in 10 minutes to attend the show, and that we would like our check.  After 5 more minutes, I had to walk around looking for the server, only to have to ask him yet again.  The check was finally dropped at 5 minutes to 7:00pm, at which time we had to get up and bring the check to the server for processing, (who was now leaning in the front of the restaurant, joking and laughing with co-workers, within eye-shot of the manager, who had also been leaning on a bar table talking during our entire dinner).

We ended up being 10 min late for the show and had to wait outside the doors to be seated.  All in all and overwhelmingly terrible and embarrassing experience.  I can see why this restaurant was so empty...",iZT3J9v_mFHPLw9PgaT9Iw,2,2,1,TThm5RXUjHtRvyULDA0lkQ

Really, REALLY surprised that this place is as big of a hot mess as it is, considering it's not new. It's been around for a while, but you'd think it was the newest hottest restaurant on the strip - and without giving its staff proper training. The reason I'm complaining about this first and foremost is because I was here during CES - the Consumer Electronics Show - which is in Las Vegas every year. So, one would think the staff and management would be aware of this ~little annual trade show that brings in more than 100,000 people.

First off - hostess. Wow, attitude much? Honey, if you can't handle all these guests in your restaurant with grace and aplomb, might I suggest another line of part-time work? And, blaming everything from being over-booked to OpenTable is NOT the way to make sure your potential guests feel good about choosing Stack over the other amazing restaurants in Vegas. I don't know, maybe talk to the manager of comping drinks for those of us who had reservations weeks ago...or something to make us feel welcome and that you're truly sorry about the craziness of the restaurant that night. But, that's just me...

We finally - FINALLY - got seated after an hour-long wait...with no one checking to see if we're okay or wanted anything to snack on while waiting or even complimentary drinks. And nary an apology was in sight. That's just f**ked up. 

So, after getting seated, it took forever to get a waiter over to get our menus and drink orders. What was really confusing is that one waiter came over and gave us his name and the name of this ""team"" that would be serving us that night...then the head guy (or who I assumed was our lead waiter since he came up to us and introduced himself) disappeared. Yeah...completely. Some other guy, who did NOT seem like a happy camper was helping us...and I'm using the term ""help"" loosely here. 

Generally don't do this, but I asked for the manager first thing. I mean, from the way the hostess treated us to the ridiculous wait for a waiter... *sigh* The manager seems like a nice guy, but I don't think he's well-respected by his staff. Nothing much changed.

Anyway...enough of that. Now about the food. I have to give the kitchen major props. Though, I should preface this by saying we were STARVING, so I don't know how biased I am about the food...

The food is great. That pretty much sums it up. My part of eight ordered a variety of appetizers and sides as appetizers and wow. Portions are on the small side, but if you order a variety, your entire party can enjoy little bites and not ruin their appetites. From the garbage salad and tater-tots to the pigs-in-a-blanket and chicken wings...we pretty much finished everything on all these small plates. Entrees were good-sized portions, we had steaks to chicken to pasta - and everyone cleaned off their plates. No complaints...and considering we staved off our hunger with the appetizers, I think it's a good sign that the food was actually good.

Dessert was as good as I've had in any restaurant...not too sickeningly sweet, but not so bland you wondered why you even bothered, The sampler dessert plate is the way to go for a little bit of everything for a larger party, especially if not everyone is into desserts.

So, to sum up my ridiculously long rant? If you can get past the unprofessional front of the house staff and you don't go during a major trade show where there are a ton of people around...then I recommend Stack.",ZG9QsCVjrfDK8E6CkBPfEQ,3,1,3,bLCvo0GvqCKQj_wCIXphiA

Both the wife and I tried the filet mignon and mashed potatoes.  Additionally I had a cocktail with my meal.  As stated in other reviews, everything is ordered a la carte.  

The ambiance of the restaurant was fancy, though it was very dark as some have mentioned.  I didn't mind this, as tables are fairly close to one another and the darkness helps give a more private feel than could be achieved with more light given the tables proximity to one another. 

Service was top notch.  Drinks were refilled quickly, food brought out promptly, and everyone was professional and friendly.

We both agreed that the steak was cooked perfectly.  Both steaks were extremely tender and flavorful.  We both order the steaks cooked medium and they came as expected with a warm, just slightly brown center.  Neither of us have had the opportunity to go to a lot of high end steak houses, but I have been to a couple, and this was in my opinion the best steak I have had. The mashed potatoes were also very good.  My wife is a huge starch fan and deemed them the best mashed potatoes she has ever had.

The cocktail was a Long Island Iced Tea.  I am not a wine fan, which I am sure if you had the taste for it would have accompanied this meal nicely, but the cocktail was very well done and obviously made with premium liquors.

All and all this place was great for a special occasion.  Prices reflect the service and quality of the food.  Don't go if you aren't willing to let yourself forget about the check for the night.

The cocktails were great also.  What has been consistently poor, is the service.  The servers in all three visits were unfriendly and dismissive.  I strongly suspect it is because we had entrees with a couple sides to share, and each a couple of martinis.  The servers want a larger tab.  We also told the young man waiting on us on our last trip, that we were in Vegas celebrating my mom's 60th birthday, to which he shrugged and flatly replied he would bring a birthday dessert.  I, myself, work in fine dining so I was a bit disgusted my his demeanor.  Our bill was $350, sorry that isn't good enough for you, dude.  He was still tipped 20%, though he didn't deserve it with his attitude.  My recommendation is this: Go to Tender Steak & Seafood in the Luxor.

The mister and I came here for happy hour right before the Beatles love show. We were in the mood for drinking and small bites. I was a bit daring with a vodka double on the rocks and the mister got a red wine. Of course, a lightweight like myself can't handle a double vodka even though it's priced half off. So I drank most of the red wine. There was a mini menu of appetizers to choose for happy hour. It wasn't much of a selection but we choose the hot wings and fish tacos. It claims that the prices for these appetizers were at half priced. I was like, it is really at $8 -$10 for these appetizers. But the mister assured me that those are the happy hour prices. A bit pricey in my book. The hot wings were very miniature and spicy and the fish tacos were grilled fish fillets served in lettuce leaves. They were both delish that we ordered them again! 

The waitress that served us was really great. To my surprise, the waitresses were dressed in sexy LBD (Little black dress).

992495,2013-10-04,0,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Las Vegas is all about change. Favorites come and go. Some remain solid and by the time they bid farewell we are left saddened. Then, there are others that were once good, but those days have come and gone. I'm sad to say this happened with Stack at Mirage. Eight years ago it opened with Brian Massie at the helm. The space was beautiful, service was exceptional and the food was everything good ole American comfort food should be, and the playful twists made it fun. Over the years, we've dined at Stack more than any other fine dining restaurant. We loved the relaxed vibe, the stacked waitresses and the classic tunes. The hot rocks, pork chop and lamb shank were outstanding. The bacon cheddar bread? Oh my goodness, we couldn't get enough. We'd return for that alone. 

Over time, they no longer offered the bread. The classic rock was replaced by club beats and the prices climbed while quality sank. We noticed a decline about a year ago, and it was confirmed a few months back when we took my husband's cousin out for her birthday. My brother joined us, too, he was eager to try the lamb shank he's heard so much about. I even called beforehand to confirm it was still be served. You can imagine our disappointment when we couldn't locate it on the menu. We waived down our waiter and sure enough, it's been eliminated. This was likely the sign to leave, but we ignored it. We've always been pleased with the steak selection and everyone but me opted to go that route. I chose the halibut ($42). 

We started with hot rocks ($21) they were still excellent. The Spicy Crab ($21) was a new item and it didn't pack any punch. It left us pretty underwhelmed. 

We've enjoyed the porterhouse for two at Brand. We expected the same quality here at Stack but it fell a bit flat ($96). It was plenty for two to share, but it wasn't as flavorful or tender as we know it could be. We also shared tater tots ($11) and roasted mushrooms ($9). The tots used to have pieces of rich smoky bacon and cheese would ooze when you'd bite into eat tot. That's not the case anymore. 

This was my brother's first fine dining experience. he went all out and ordered the porterhouse ($62). I wish I could say he was able to reap the perks and find the value of a quality piece of meat. It was very average at best. He was disappointed and I was bummed for him.

My halibut was the best dish of the evening, the exception being the hot rocks. The halibut was nicely prepared with a hard sear and it was very fresh.

After finishing that meal, the warm comforting mahogany walls suddenly felt somber. A longtime favorite had faded. We knew we wouldn't be back. We suspect it would soon shutter. I didn't see it surviving long after the opening of Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak. I haven't heard any news of it closing, but I certainly wouldn't be surprised if it did.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,2,2,h8j2QqJlR3kh2rB-Nqvy2Q

Our waiter said it was made out of African Mahogany, which he said is an endangered wood species. Insane.
All the food we ordered was amazing. For the main course we had a 24oz steak and some chicken which came with 'Whipped Potatoes' (much better than mashed!) This was more than enough to share with 4 people, but to go all out we ordered some appetizers and a desert. 
The Adult Tater tots were probably my favorite appetizer out of the three we ordered (meatballs, mac and cheese) but all three were delicious. 
For desert we wanted something on the lighter side because we were all very full, so our waiter recommend the strawberry shortcake type desert. It was very fancy as there were small marshmallows individually toasted to a golden brown on top of a perfect ball of vanilla ice cream. Totally worth it!
The service is also great, as everyone makes sure you don't have any dirty plates or silverware laying on your table. 
The only thing holding this back from a 10/10 experience was that I checked in with our waiter on Yelp to receive two shots on the house towards the beginning of our meal, which he seemed to forgot about it as we had to flag someone down to remind them. It wasn't too much of an issue as the drink in the end was delicious, and was sweet enough to be a desert drink.

For the appetizer I got the onion rings. They were good. My husband got the king crab jalapeño tacos. He said they were excellent.

We both ordered the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes for our main coarse. Chicken was very juicy and tender and the mashed potatoes were the best I'd EVER had in my life.

For dessert we ordered the sampler.  There are 6 different desserts on the sampler. The brownie sundae was just ok. The brownies were hard and served cold instead of warm. The Alaskan ice cream was gross. The jelly doughnut and mocha pudding thing were super yummy and so was the Swiss jelly roll. The bread pudding was not good. At all. And I love bread pudding.

We also had cocktails. My husband had some hot martini (I 4get what it was called but it was served with 2 big red peppers attached to the martini glass). He said it was OK but it did have some heat to it. I wanted a Pina colada but they don't do frozen drinks....BOO!!!! So I ordered the Pina colada martini. It was OK but very strong. I had a buzz after drinking half.  The cinnamon they put around rim was very off putting. They put it around my husbands drink as well and he thought it was gross too. He actually wiped all his off with his napkin so he wouldn't have to taste it anymore.

1 other complaint I have is Stack keeps their lights very (and I mean very) dim. So dim it was hard to read the menu.

Pigs in a blanket- FUN! Who has pigs in a blanket on the menu. Great lil smoky sausages wrapped in buttery flaky pastry served with a small carafe of BBQ sauce. Good stuff.
Yellowtail Crunch- Mini ""tostadas"" of fresh diced yellowtail, mixed with a slightly spicy sauce and served a top a crispy won ton disk. Yum!
Adult Tater Tots- Now I'm not a fan of Brie, but fry it up and mix it up with bacon, oh yeah, everything is better with bacon :) Great!!
Pan Seared Dumplings- Steamed, pillowy soft clouds of a chicken/pork/veggie mix. Great crisp ""crust"" on the base from the sear served with a zingy soy dipping sauce. 

For my main dish, I chose the Petite Filet Mignon. A 9oz filet, tender and simply seasoned. Mm, mmm!
We also got a few sides for our main courses:
Crunchy Steakhouse Fries- Crispy, thick cut potatoes with truffle oil and parmesan. Yum!
Baked Mac 'n' Cheese- This looked good, but truth be told as someone who doesn't do well with too much cheese, I passed on this one. 
Green Bean- we needed at least some green! Simply crisp steamed green beans. 

Because we hadn't indulged enough...we had to have dessert!
Banana Cream Pie Bites- Petite mini bites of a smooth banana cream pie. 
Munchkin Jelly Donuts- Sugar coated puffs of jelly filled donuts.

Service was prompt, friendly and efficient. Food came out well timed but quick. Refills provided and plates cleared promptly.

Had a business meal here with 10 total guests, and encountered several issues. Our waiter was initially prompt and pleasant, although as the night went on he seemed to disappear. After ordering or first round of cocktails we had to wait over 15 minutes, which is completely unacceptable.

Appetizers were decent although barely should be considered shareable as most cost $15-20 and were enough for maybe 2 people.

And dinner, the consensus was the steaks were all pretty standard, nothing to right home about. Of course I was the only one who's meal was ""forgotten."" The entire table was served and nothing for me. It became clear that they forgot to enter my meal into the system and had to rush it out. This means I was eating once everyone was done.

Even better, I ordered the lobster GREEN curry which was decidedly orange and not a green curry. I've had enough curries over the years to realize this was something completely different.

We skipped dessert but after dinner was served our main waiter was nowhere to be found. They didn't comp my meal and a a manager never stopped over.

So we spared my aunt and uncle the expense of taking us out to another meal that we probably wouldn't like and went to STACK instead.

STACK is a pretty strange place.  Not what you'd expect from the typical Vegas steakhouse.  The atmosphere is dark, very dark.  Interior design is modern and warm.  And the music.... oh the music.  Where else can you get a gigantic steak while listening to Prince and the Revolution (yeah, that's right, old school).  STACK is like a dance party waiting to happen, except you likely won't be able to move after you're done eating.

I'm a ribeye fan.  And let me tell you that the cowboy cut here was absolutely perfect.  Not only was it enormous (24 oz), but cooked to perfection.  And seasoned with little more than salt and pepper.

My sister ordered the kobe burger, and it too was amazing (I couldn't pass up a bite of a burger.... come on).  

But the single best thing we ate was the 'adult tator tots' stuffed with brie and bacon.  Perfect cylindrical potato morsels that just melt in your mouth.

Porterhouse -- If you're looking for a good amount of meat, this is a great choice.

2) Caesar Salad 
3) Cowboy steak (with a single potato chip)
4) Twice baked potatoes
3) Sea Bass

The taste and presentation was great. Hot Rocks came first and then the Caesar Salad. These two items are pricey for what they are. Don't get me wrong, they were great to try, but I don't believe they were worth 30$. 

At the time we ate here, I was more of a fish fan, so I was not sure how that would go since it's more known for the steak. My Sea Bass was wonderful! Probably top three sea bass entrees I have had.

The chicken and risotto were both excellent as well. My wife says the mushroom risotto was the best she's ever had. As for the sides, the Brussel sprouts pleased everyone and were sweet and tangy!

I think this is a good affordable option in the Bellagio, if you want a quick meal. I mean...it's not cheap but hey it's the strip! I'm definitely going to go back because there are a couple more things on the menu that looked good!",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,1,2,5,F_vHlzSmkUT9stCtl6-URA

The part that is truly incredible is the service!!! i have not been to a place like this in a while. Literally, four people simultaneously at times were serving our table. It is like they are timed to come out on cue and like one of the requirements is setting things down at the same time in unison. Every single employee welcomed us on our way inside..in addition the server new the menu like he cooked it himself. The service is truly incredible.

The atmosphere is great - tiered wooden ceilings and a dark ambiance. I ordered the Tomahawk Rib eye ($62) and my wife ordered the tomato soup with grilled cheese and a Caesar salad (about $25). The steak was amazing! Incredible char with a bone that will interfere with those in close proximity. While we expected to pay quite a bit for the meal, we didn't count on a single Margarita being $25. A few things of note: the darkness makes it incredibly difficult to tell if your steak is done to your liking (I prefer medium, and mine was quite rare - thanks phone flashlight for coming to the rescue). Additionally, we wanted a little privacy and got a secluded booth in the back... Until they sat a party of 2 adults and 4 children (under 10) next to us. 
  In any case, it was a great meal. Expect to pay quite a bit (especially if you're drinking or like sides with your meal).",TQ1CvBXA0-87bQqfAAduyQ,1,0,4,hxX1KrKS4sz30a9xuF5D-A

We complained about the long wait, and they offered to knock the wine (a cheap bottle) off the bill. If you ask me, though, an extra hour or two of prime time in Vegas (10pm-ish) during vacation is worth more than $40 bottle of wine. 

The only reason this place gets two stars as opposed to one is that I went there more recently for the happy hour, and the service was better. Then again, it was empty during the Monday happy hour, maybe that's why it was so quick.",VSRtEK_c84oJygZ0OX0Oqg,2,0,2,5_RrXZDJHwFPXMqKKfaEEw

Everything was very well seasoned and the house sauces were very yummy! The lighting and ambiance was perfect. The disappointing note to our first visit was that it seemed like they were rushing us. Maybe they needed the table(?) The second time, there was a great DJ playing, the food was still good but tried other sides and everything seemed smaller, or just less of a portion we have had anywhere else. Not that we eat A LOT or that we NEED loads of food, but in comparison to surrounding restaurants, everything seemed in smaller quantities. I don't recall any details about the visits in between so they were probably ok. But This last visit... Was pretty awful. We ordered the steak meal for 2, a few sides and a salad. The salad and dressing was extremely bitter-it was like they poured straight vinegar (when we ordered blue cheese) and not to mention we like vinegar lol... but we left it all. Our food took almost an hour and a few minutes to come. Finally the steak came and was pretty much all fat and cartilage. the asparagus were miniscule! and the béarnaise sauce was flavorless.

Start with the Hot Rocks as an appetizer. You will get several thinly sliced pieces of meat, marinated in a DELCIOUS sauce. You are served a scorching hot rock in a basket, and you cook this little mini-steaks yourself. Delectable. The Miso Black Cod Lettuce cups are crisp and refreshing, and the Japanese Spicy Crab are to die for! Little cubes of flavorful spicy crab are served on a crispy rice-crouton square, served with a pleasantly spicy/tangy sauce. If lobster is your thing, the Lobster Taco's are amazing.

I have ordered the Petit Filet three times so far. Always tender, served with two of their signature steak sauces. So. Good.  As an entree choice. they also serve a delicious Penne dish with parmesan, proscuitto and black truffle. SO decadent and satisfying. More than enough to share with a pal.

Try the Seabass in Lobster Risotto. Ohmygoodness. That's all I can say. One of the most amazing seabass dishes I have ever been served. 

As a side, I have tried the XL Twice Baked potato. SPLIT THIS with someone, it is much too much for one person. Seriously. The Sautteed Spinach is also quiet delicious.

Dessert:
You can't leave with out trying the Jelly Doughnut ""Munchkins"". Warm jelly filled doughnut holes with a creamy sweet dipping sauce. Trust me, you will want to rub these all over your body.

The steak, which my friend had raved about all weekend, wasn't as great as I thought it to be. But he said it wasn't good that day. The mash potatoes which the menu described as better than mom's was just alright. Not a big fan of mash potatoes anyway. But the mac and cheese was quite nice. Sea bass was also really good.

1586999,2016-01-25,5,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Stack was one of the better decisions I made while in Vegas with some friends from college. 

My only job for the Vegas planning was finding a good restaurant for our group to visit without breaking the bank. I can very confidently say mission accomplished on that front.

Number one, I might have changed our reservation time 3 times on open table the day we were going to Stack and it didn't seem to be a problem at all. We got the Mirage and walked straight to the restaurant. After talking to the hostess, we probably waited for five minutes while they set our table for 8. 

First things first: I loved the atmosphere of this place as soon as we walked in. It was classy and dimly lit, but not TOO dimly lit. It just seemed like a cool place to be when having a nice dinner. ALSO, we got a round table for our party of 8 which I was extremely happy with. I'm not a big fan of having people at opposite ends of a rectangular table and this huge round table they sat us at let everyone talk with each other during dinner. BIG plus. 

Second: If you come here make sure to check in on Yelp! We got 8 free shots just for checking in. (Granted they were pink and tasted like lemonade, but what can you expect?) 

Third: The food. was. fantastic. I was a little nervous when we walked in and it wasn't busy at all but that might be because we were in Vegas and having dinner at 6:30 pm.... Anyway. That didn't end up being a problem. The Caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had - crispy and fresh lettuce, well dressed. The sides we all got to split were also excellent - the adult tater tots and the mac and cheese. We got two of each and there was a little bit left over for 8 of us. Most of us went with the filet mignon for our entree and we were rewarded for our choice. My steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and the compote butter on top added a ton of flavor to each bite. I got my filet with the shrimp scampi and they were done very well. 

All in all it was just a great experience. The service was prompt, polite, and helpful. I'd recommend Stack to anyone who is staying near the Mirage as it is worth your time and money.",NvTI0n5PhXdJYxTtRPRzrw,11,14,5,P_vNuODaqY6MjxwfhL1lmQ

The customer service here was amazing.  We had two servers at our table and a number of other people waiting on our table.  They brought out the food quickly, cleaned things up quickly, and changed our plates/utensils for the new dishes.  

We came here without a reservation so the wait was 45 minutes on a Saturday night.  We spent the time walking around and playing a few things before going in so the wait really wasn't a big deal.  I had a prosecco at the bar which was not bad and my boyfriend had Black on THE ROCKS...like literally all rocks.  Not a big deal either.  

Stack's menu is relatively simple and easy to navigate.  I liked that each dish was small so my boyfriend and I shared everything.  First we had the Hot Rocks which was amazing!!!!  They bring this hot black rock to your table and I think 7-8 slices of thinly sliced sirloin.  You're supposed to cook the sirloin just 1 minute on each side.  That might be overdoing it a bit too so it's really quick.  THen we had the Grilled Meat Ball Pizza.  Not your average pizza.  The bottom was a herby cracker and it had a sliver of meatball on each piece.  Not bad though.  This came with 8 pieces.  We had the lobster main plate which was quite delicious.  The lobster was a smaller lobster but it was cooked just right and very tender.  We had the adult tater tots which were amazing!!!!!!  They were hollow with bacon and melted brie inside.  I think there were 6 of these.  For veggies, we had the sauteed spinach which was nothing special but complimented the meal well.  

Our meal was $120 but it was quite a significant tip for to thank them for the service.  I definitely want to come back here and I recommend it.

The food was oh so delicious. This place has become my new favorite place in Vegas! Crabmeat tacos are a must try for anyone dining here- they are unbelievably delicious!!
Came here for husband's birthday several days ago and we're still talking about how good everything was. The interior is unlike any other steakhouse and the presentation took our breaths away. Some of the reviews here say, overpriced, but look- this is a STEAKHOUSE. It's not a sterile, stuffy kind of steakhouse, it is trendy and fun. And it's not overpriced when compared to other steakhouses in vegas.
For starts we ordered drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. After being seated we ordered cucumber martinis ($19) and the crab tacos for appetizer ($19). The crab tacos are wonderful but small so don't think it'll be enough for your meal. For the meal, I ordered the Pan Roasted Chicken ($28) with baby veggies instead of green beans which they were more than happy to change for me and my husband ordered the 24oz Tomahawk Rib Eye ($54) with a side of the Bacon and Brie Tator Tots ($10). The food Wowed us, everything that was brought out made me want to take a picture of it. The server Deena was super nice and the place couldn't have been more perfect plus they had real candles on the table which was the cherry on top. I highly recommend this for anyone celebrating a birthday or who just wants to have a great time at a superior steakhouse.",iEkPA13x5bbBM6AOu8JsYQ,1,0,5,MXHpvhYPE-vEtI8GQEfrBQ

We thought about going to Heritage but I heard this place was more lively. We got there around 6:30 to have a couple drinks before 7. The hostess was so lovely, she greeted us with a warm smile and didn't rush to seat us. We seat in the lounge at first in one of the circle tables in the front that overlooks the casino floor, the perfect spot for people-watching. A tall brunette waitress came over with a Ipad to show us the specialty cocktails. I tend to like vodka and sweet drinks so the cocktail witness suggested the raspberry sin which came with real cotton candy!!! We enjoyed our drinks and even took shots with the table of guys next to us! After finishing a round of drinks, we moved into the intricate dinning room which featured breathe-taking architecture. The room is lightly-dimmed and the walls look layered rocks. Our server was so delightful, he was very knowledgeable about the menu. We had a couple starters. They had a quirky appetizer where you cook raw meat on a hot stone right at the table! The yellowtail sashimi was fresh and light. I loved it so much,  I wish I ordered two. For my entree I got a petit filet was came out seasoned perfectly. I usually order my steak med-rare, more on the rare side but restaurants can never give me that. Stack actually listened to what I wanted and I loved it, made me feel extra special since it was my birthday. For the table, we ordered a number of sides which include mac and cheese and tator tots which both rocked. For dessert, we had these adorable banana creampies. I'll definitely make Stack a spot each vegas trip. Overall, the experience was quiet memorable. From the hostess to our server, I can't wait to come back.

We visited this place after watching the Beatle's LOVE Cirque Du Soleil show (which is incredible), and we were very happy with our experience. 

Our waitress, Logan, was super cool, and she knows how to create an excellent experience. After chatting a bit, she directed us towards their margarita - which is $25 - BUT the thing is a DOUBLE and comes with your own private mini bottle of Gran Marnier so you can doctor your drink the way you like it. One of those and we made the glorious mistake of getting a second one. The uber back to our hotel was a blur....

We decided that -hey, we're in Vegas- and went for the Filet Mignon with a side of shrimp scampi. Incredible. Highly HIGHLY recommend. Thank you to the chef, because the meat was like butter in it's texture and the balsamic butter that they garnish it with is delicious. The shrimp was perfect in it's balance of garlic. LOVED it. And we're from NorCal, so we have a large selection of places to eat that are amazing - Stack is one of the two places that came close to what we expect.

If you are going to charge $40-$60 for a steak a-la cart you are comparing yourself to the top steakhouses, at least in price you have to deliver the goods on the meat. My tomahawk ribeye looked incredible with a huge bone in for show but it was all sizzle & no steak. It wasn't very tender.it was kind of chewy. Very chewy. So was my girlfriends filet. This is a personal preference maybe but I feel thicker cuts tend to be better. This was on the thinner side. Again not bad. The adult tater tots were good. My girlfriend's berry martini was amazing.

As far as entrees 2 of my favorites are the sea bass and the Kobe burger.  If you really want to go all out get the filet Oscar style! The lump crab is delicious.

The service is friendly, but they are really slow at delivering the food.

on a STACK of bibles, I had planned to post this earlier.  And so, I'll keep this short and sweet.

1.  Yes, they do take reservations.  I made one via the open table app.  We chose to have dinner at Stack after seeing the 700pm show of LOVE.

2.  No, outside drinks are not allowed in Stack.  And of course, we learned this hard way, as my brother tried to bring in a drink from the center bar (where we stopped for a drink after the show).

3.  Yes, the low lighting ambiance takes some adjustment, but one grows to adapt once you've been seated.  The restaurant wasn't very crowded at 900pm, which provided us with a semi-private area (there was only one large group nearby and they were near the tail end of their meal).

4.  Yes, one should order a drink and appetizers to start.  I had a moscow mule, my mother had a fruity martini, and my brother chose an old fashioned.  We started with the beef tartare, it was quite good.  

5.  Yes, dinner was absolutely delicious.  My mom had the scallops, my brother ordered the New York Steak, and I had the Classic Wagyu Burger (served with fries).  Sides for the table were the loaded mac and cheese and spinach (one needs vegetables with every meal, of course).  Suffice to say, we all enjoyed our entrees and there was some sharing between the three of us (of course).  

6.  Yes, we were too full to order dessert.

7.  Yes, the service was outstanding.  The server answered all our questions, and we appreciated his patience while we deliberated our dinner choices.  He and other staff checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  Great service overall.

BOTTOM LINE:
We saved one of the best meals for last.  Good food and great company on the last night in Vegas!",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,13,12,5,vQbSKsh6gww2Sm2lyNFmvQ

Yes, it is a little pricey; however, it was worth every penny! From the outside It didn't seem very crowded and it looked very modern inside (very aesthetically pleasing), so my gf and I decided to get a bite to eat there. The nice lady hostess seated us to our table and I really liked the ambience. There was a bachelorette party taking place near the main bar and they didn't seem too crazy. :)

I liked that the house/trance music was not too loud and it had a rich and immense clarity of sound, that an audiophile would appreciate! Maybe similar to Bowers & Wilkins speakers. I never had to yell or text to communicate with my gf; the volume was just right!

We weren't too hungry, nor did we want to take left overs, so we opted for the ""signature small plates"". My gf ordered Miso Habachi Skewers and I ordered the Mini Lamb Gyros and they were both amazing! There were small portioned, although they seemed like the perfect amount for us at that time. My gf's small plate came with a little hot grill to keep the meat warm on the skewers and it also had a rich peanut butter sauce; quite tasty! My mini gyros came in a little platter with a creamy cucumber yogurt sauce and they were to die for! I enjoyed that it was like perfect temperature; not too hot or cold, just right! 

My gf ordered a dessert (warm chocolate cake) and it came with vanilla ice cream and a chocolate stick on the side. I had a taste and I believe this was the best chocolate lava cake I ever had! It melts in your mouth! On top of the ice cream there was a white round coin-shaped piece, depicting red letters ""STACK"". We thought it was plastic and to make sure we took a bite and it turned out that it was white chocolate.

The only aspect of our dinner, that I was not fond of, was our first waiter. He seemed a little cocky and seemed didn't want to be there. Good thing that we had the pleasure of a new courteous waiter after we received our entrées. I think he had short blonde hair but anyway, he was great and it make our night more enjoyable!

I highly recommend this restaurant/bar at the Mirage!",hlP6qnXFyzfizKJxTjPgMw,2,0,5,oJLDXztr7KRJ4RbypyyBMQ
2003077,2014-05-12,3,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"I'm ashamed to admit this, but I walked out of this place a few years ago while on vacation with a friend....hence, we are no longer friends.  She originally picked this place based on a martini she wanted on the menu.  We sat down, they said they no longer made that particular martini and for some reason the $50 steak we said we'd get for dinner was no longer what she wanted for dinner.  I told HER to tell our server we were leaving...she just didn't want to eat there.  Since then I HAVE wanted to go back because I always like a GOOD meal for my final night while visiting Vegas and I go every year.

Fast forward to 2014, last week to be specific.  I already told my friends about my previous experience of not eating here and they were down for whatever.  I don't know how Stack compares to the other higher end restaurants in the Mirage but I was determined to eat here regardless.

For starters, I was super impressed with the wine, drink, and dessert menu on an ipad...fancy schmancy!  Being my last night in Vegas I figured I had to split payment (cash/charge) for this meal and asked if we could get separate checks.  I must have asked our waiter too many questions because he kept his cool though I sensed I was getting a bit annoying...I did compensate him with a tip larger than 20% on my portion of the bill.

I ordered the petite filet, adult tater tots, and a glass of cab.  YUM-O!!!! They were all amazing!!! Yes, expensive but you get what you pay for with good quality restaurants.  My friends loved their meals as well - one ordered steak and the other ordered salmon I believe...I'm not sure, I was too into my own meal throughout dinner.

We couldn't decide on one thing for dessert so we got the dessert sampler and everything that came on there was amazing as well.

It was so incredibly flavorful that I didn't want to use any of the sauces it came with. Everyone seemed happy with their meals: sea bass with lobster risotto, roasted chicken, spaghetti & meatballs.

We started with Hot Rocks appetizer which is fun if nothing else.  Several slices of paper thin steak which has been marinated and then you cook it yourself on the super hot rocks they deliver to your table.  Tastes good, doesn't fill you up and has the fun factor on it's side.

We split a salad, don't make the mistake of trying to eat an entire one yourself if you want to finish your meal.  Hubby had a steak which he said was so tender you could almost cut it with a fork and a side of whipped garlic potatoes.  I had sea bass which was amazing but the real star of the dish was the risotto under it.  Lobster risotto which was creamy and so good with chunks of lobster.

Then of course we had to have dessert even though by this time I could hardly move.  They have a sampler to share which has bites of everything.  While we couldn't finish it, was fun to try.

They've changed the menu, made it smaller and taken off a couple of my favorites but if they keep the sea bass, I'm good.",1HvVTMBEs8ZArJ62IGMbCw,0,0,5,x1z63UTmzfYSxMj6FazXSg

You simply can not pass up the king crab and jalapeño tacos.

My fiancé and I have been coming to STACK for the last 6 years to celebrate our anniversary. Every time we come we have never left disappointed.

Our waiter for the night was Scott. It was an absolute pleasure to meet him. He greeted us immediately and asked if we had been there before. Once we told him our story, he smiled and asked if we minded if he went through the menu with us or if we would like to browse for ourselves. We appreciated him asking so much that we told him to ""Go for it!"" He discussed everything with finesse and sparked our interest on a few items. He was also kind enough to let us know that portions (depending on the dish) did run larger and could be split between two people.

For our starter we ordered the caesar salad (to split). WOW! The fresh brioche crouton paired very nice with the housemade ceasar dressing. The lettuce was crisp and the freshly cracked pepper just topped it all off.

For our Entree's we enjoyed the 14oz Brooklyn filet and the, what we like to call, ""Flinstone"" tomahawke Steak. The giant bone makes it looks prehistoric. It's presentation is stunning. My Brooklyn filet just melted in my mouth with each bite. Both steaks are the best we have ever had and we've been to some pretty nice steak restaurants; Mastros, Sulivans, LG's Steak house just to name a few. And don't forget to ask for EXTRA peppercorn sauce. The steaks don't need it BUT this stuff is absolute HEAVEN. 

Our sides were the adult tater totes. They had the perfect amount of Brie cheese and bacon in them. We also had Mac-N-Cheese. The jumbo shells used made sure you got pieces of ham, peas and cheese sauce in every bite. Note: You can share each side between two people.

Our Desert used to be the Creme Brûlée but they stopped making it. It was seriously the best and if you're reading this STACK please bring it back. One of the most unique Creme Brûlées we've ever eaten. 

All in all this place is the best and we make it one the places we at no matter what when we are visiting Vegas.

Just prepare to spend a lot of money on what is definitely worth it for how special a place it really is. Service is also top-notch, we didn't have to ask for a thing and the waiter certainly earned his generous tip. (Plus the tender behind the bar mixing drinks was adept.)

if I had one observation it would be that it wasn't very crowded, given we ate on a Tuesday night at 9:15. If you are looking for a very lively bar scene you might wanna find many of the thousands of hip bars in Vegas. However it was quiet and intimate which allowed me to focus on my party members.

We started off with pigs in a blanket and the spicy Japanese crab, The pigs in a blanket were just like the ones you would get at any cocktail party - amazing! The spicy Japanese crab was just okay - I did not think it was bad per say, it was just not my taste. It was shredded crab on top of rice and lightly covered with a citrus soy sauce. 

For dinner I had the stacked Kobe beef burger with grown up tater tots. The Kobe beef burger was really good, but I didn't not care for the tater tots. They were stuffed with brie cheese and bacon. I think the bacon is what threw me off, I would have liked them if they were just filled with potato and brie cheese. 

I then had to have the jelly donut munchkins with vanilla dipping sauce for dessert. OMG!!!! They were amazing. When I bit into these I thought  I was in heaven. Just thinking about them makes my mouth water. 

Other than the food, the staff was outstanding, the decor is chic and the food presentation is very clever. For example when the jelly donuts came out, they were stacked in a mini cardboard box that said stack all over it (it looked like a DD munchkin box).

I get that some of these things are now available at Otoro and Heritage Steak next door, and that's why I'm worried Stack is not going to be around much longer.  Also, some anchovies on the caesar salad would be a nice touch.. (as the menu indicates, it's a caesar ""as it should be"").

This used to be one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in the country.  I always come here every time I am in Vegas, and I always recommend my friends try it.  The filet has always been exceptional, but recently, everything was just not as good.  The waitress looked like she hated her job, and I just felt bad for her.  She did not suggest anything (no wine pairings, appetizers, features/specials, sauces.  She brought a dessert menu, but by then her depression was wearing off on me.

For the guest: at this point, the 8oz filet is the only steak worth ordering.  It actually comes with mashed potatoes, so at less than $50, it's a pretty good value. Hot rocks is a good appetizer, but it doesn't compliment a steak (so tell them to bring back the hamachi!!).

2510501,2010-02-10,0,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"We were looking for a decent place to grab dinner before KA, and everything at the MGM Grand was booked up (private parties on a fight night), we were staying at TI, and Stack had decent reviews next door at the Mirage. As one of the Mirage's ""find dining"" locations, I expected A LOT MORE. 

You are greeted by loud music and walk through the bar on your way to the table... hoping the club beats will abide as you move into a beautiful dining area. But it doesn't. I understand this is Vegas, and they want you to move from their restaurant into their club, but when spending ~$150/person on dinner I expect to be able to hear my date over the music. 

Our first server (I *think* we had two, not sure really because there was no continuity) talked very fast, and nervously. After he calmed down he was nice and courteous, but barely knowledgeable about the menu. The specials were rehearsed, not even sure if he knew exactly what they were. Food came fairly quickly after ordering, but service after that was scarce. 

We started off with the tuna, and it was overcooked in a sauce with little flavor. Topped with slices of Serrano peppers it was a unique presentation, but nothing I would order again. 

The steak was great, both of ours (NY strip & fillet) came out perfectly done and extremely flavorful. Two different steak sauces were served, one delicious red wine and a tasty peppercorn. The steaks are the only reason why Stack gets 3 stars instead of the 2 I'm inclined to give it. 

The side dishes were just OK, my baked mac n' cheese was acceptable, but nothing to go back for. My wife ordered the sauteed spinach, there's only so much you can expect out of that, but this could have been dropped from a can and microwaved. 

The wine list may have been long, but the selection and prices were horrible. We ended up with a Pine Ridge Merlot, ~$65 for a bottle we can by for $5 at the local grocery store. Other cellars and vintages that can be bought for $10 (Beringer, Red Diamond) rounded out their ~$100 categories. 

When I asked for some sort of bread to be served with dinner I felt like I was being a bother, and although I wasn't charged for it, when it did come out it was warm, but hard and tough as though it had been reheated. 

Overall I think it would be a great place to come with a group of friends or for a party. If you're looking to sit at a bar and grab some good drinks and food this would be a good stop, just stick with the mixed drinks and stay away from the wine. But if you're looking to sit down for a nice dinner I would recommend looking somewhere else. While I hate making comparisons, value and service wise, a place like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse would give you a much better experience for the same money.",iFzcuCSfsepJh1SSFBwrhw,0,0,3,58g5Nxdj1yS8CbhyWmPlxA

I began with my favorite drink - a Bloody Mary. After the Bloody, I got my usual vodka/soda that was made strong, just the way I like it :-)
For my appetizer, I ordered the Caesar salad which was very good! I also tried their wedge salad and that was absolutely delicious! For my main course, I ordered the filet (rare) and that was cooked to perfection! It came with asparagus and a couple of sauces that I couldn't get enough of! I also ordered brussels sprouts on the side and I ate every single last bite.

Then she answered the phone, got off the phone & asked my name. After telling her, she said ""yes, for 6:00"". Uh... what just happened? We were seated early, the restaurant was at about 1/4 capacity yet we were stuck in some awkward corner table, like we were in timeout. Being tall women in heels & our proximity to eachother, the table was quite uncomfortable. Already, my best friend is annoyed. Drink order taken & received with no problem, at which time we placed our food order: lobster rolls, lamb gyros, shortrib meatballs & gratin potatoes. Our waiter insisted we keep a menu, in case we wanted to order anything else. A retrospective quote from my best friend ""make sure you hang on to a menu, because I won't be back!"" Food came, food was delish. Although the lobster roll was fresh & flavorful, it's embarrassing what a ripoff it is. If I recall, it was $23. I'm all about paying for excellent food but there was maybe a tablespoon of the lobster mix. It was worth $7, at most. Our empty plates sat at our table for 20min. No drink refills ever, no check-up ever, no offer for a dessert menu (our most favorite part of dining somewhere we've never been before), no offer for our bill. Now, we're running close on time, because the Boyz II Men show that brought us to the Mirage starts at 7:30 & is on the other side of the casino. So, we're visually stalking the man who appears to be a manager, hoping we can get his attention & let him know about how badly we were neglected. But, his head was down at all times... straightening napkin rolls at empty tables. To the point where it became comical. Here's an idea, apply that attention to detail to the patrons! It was so bad that I actually told my friend that we should just walk out because nobody would notice. Finally, someone came to ask if we wanted dessert. I told him we were now running late & that we needed the bill asap. He brought it right away &, to be honest, we struggled with the tip. Generally 20-30% tippers, we barely were enthused about 15% but we were hoping that the ONE person who did pay us attention- the water boy- would get a cut. On the way out, I grabbed both managers' cards so I can send them an email about how the sh!tty service completely undermines the good grub. The ambiance is cool, the menu has the perfect variety of food & it's worth going back for. Unfortunately, though, we won't be.",hd343st7cOIUSfAd5r0U7A,0,0,2,qXVOS1BwDfgGHpcVXXZqEQ

The steak was melt in your mouth tender with every bite fully marbleized. Portion sizes were designed more for a welterweight than a heavyweight......Sugar Ray not Tyson.

High priced steak, that was tasty, but not worth the money I paid for it.

My wife had the Petite Filet.  She said it was delicious.  I'm sure it was...it should have been for $38.

The service sucked...the ambience was nice, but typical of most of the other restaurants in Vegas...namely, dark.

I'd like to believe that there are a great deal of steak restaurants in Vegas where one could get a killer meal, for alot less...

But, it's a place to see, and be seen ( spending lots of money ), and I guess if that's what you're into, then it's the place for you.

We were staying at the Mirage. We are VIP guests at the hotel.  We got to the lobby a bit early so we decided to get a drink at the bar. We asked the bartender if we are allowed to take our drinks to the restaurant and he said yes, for sure. The hostess at the restaurant rudely asked for our drinks .
We stepped out of the restaurant to finish the drinks and went back to the hostess desk. She again asked  to have our glasses in a unfriendly approach. I was with my husband and 10 year old son. It took time for the waiter to come to the table. The waiters and bus boys were running back and forth without attending to us for about 10 minutes. The atmosphere made us uptight instead of feeling a relaxed
atmosphere. 
We asked for bread and the only bread was with ham. We don't eat pork , So we passed. Then I started by ordering the Mac and cheese for my son and that too had ham.  The waiter said that he can whip up some pasta and butter for him. I ordered chicken and my husband ordered an Cesar's salad and a couple of appetizers. my husband asked to speak with the mgr. We explained the situation and experience we are having. He understood and apologized and asked if he can get us some plain bread from the other restaurant, and we said yes. The mgr said he was going to comp my glass of wine, I thanked him. The check arrived,i review'd the charges, they comped the drink and the two appetizers, (which I thought was very nice considering the experience). I saw they charged $33.00 for the pasta. That was suppose to replace the Mac and cheese at $14.00 and I questioned that with the waiter and he snapped at me and said ""we comped your appetizers"". So what that meant is they needed to make it up with an overcharge on the small plate of pasta and butter. I paid cash and will NEVER go back to the place to eat again. We were very disappointed .. 
FYI , it was my sons Birthday and I made everyone aware. The waiter didn't acknowledge him in anyway, which is soo unprofessional. I will spend my money elsewhere where they appreciate the customers.",IUT60YobB-rExlzyWDn80g,0,0,2,otGUG0PBuvRrpu8Iaro7fw

We came for an early dinner before being a show. We had made reservations for a group of 6 people online and were seated promptly. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. I regret not getting his name because he was wonderful. 

I ordered the Berrylicious cocktail which was delicious. The garnish was beautiful and was surprised that it was a decent pour of vodka. A friend ordered the cucumber martini and loved it. 

Since it was our last night in Vegas, my fiance and I decided to go all out and we ordered The Ultimate Surf & Turf. It's $175 but it's made for two people to share. Honestly it would have fed four grown men, but it was so delicious that we couldn't stop eating it. The porterhouse was amazing. It was cooked a perfect medium as requested. It came with two types of dipping sauces but we didn't bother using either one because the steak was so delicious. I thought the New York Strip side of the porterhouse was the best steak I've ever had, until I tried the filet side. OMG! Talk about melt in your mouth.

The lobster was a ginormous two pounds and was very easy to eat. It was delicious and buttery and the tail was already out of the shell for convenience. I don't even know what the lobster was stuffed with but I don't care because it was so good.

For our sides we ordered the mac n cheese, which was perfectly creamy and cheesy and came out in an iron skillet. We also had asparagus which was perfectly cooked.

Service was tentative throughout the night. Our waiter was very accommodating. The SEABASS entrée is what he recommended but my dad already had his heart set on that. That dish was freaking amazing!!! Sea bass was tender, sauce was full of flavor, had a few lobster bits with risotto. Yum!!

Mommy ordered a petite filet, medium rare. It was cooked to her liking. She also got a side of baby vegetables. The vegetables were fresh and it wasn't soggy. Nothing is worse than soggy ol vegetables.

I ordered the Lobster Curry with rice. Curry was not spicy at all; it was more sweet, if anything. It came with lots of big lobster chunks......they definitely do not skim you on your lobster meat! Also came with cucumbers, carrots and mushrooms. (see pic attached.) I wouldn't mind getting this entrée again.

I made a reservation for a party of 16 for my Bachelorette party this past weekend. The catch was that everyone would have a pre-fixed menu - a set price of $65 and no one could be late. I even had to sign a contract, choose the menu that I wanted and was told that 'Stephanie's Bachelorette Party!' would be at the top of every menu. 

We rushed across the strip to make it in early, paid a lot of money on transportation. When we arrive, we were treated like every other guest. Considering that we had such a large party and that all 16 of us were going to pay $65+, shouldn't we have been treated better? $65.00 x 16 = $1,040.00 and that doesn't include tax, gratuity and alcoholic drinks. 

We were sat at a table in the very front, a table that every guest has to pass to get to their seat - ANNOYING!

We began to review the menus. Every menu was different! None of which had my name of it. Anyways, no one came to take our order, no one refilled our water. It was terrible. 

We finally ordered - nothing was happening. After an hour of sitting there, we decided to get up and find our server (who was MIA). FINALLY - they brought us a salad, an hour later. 

After the salad, still no action going on, no drinks, nothing. We asked for the Manager, the manager was MIA. It took us 20 minutes to locate him and when we did, we just decided that it was so ridiculous, we needed to leave.

I didn't get to try dessert, but their dessert menu had over 6+ items and were browsable through that iPad I mentioned earlier, you know, the one we were ""trying"" to steal.

I think I would definitely come back here for a special occasion. It is somewhat pricey, with the Atlantic salmon be $39, but it was definitely good. Our bill totaled approximately $145 including tip. Hopefully, they don't think we are thieves next time!",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,1,0,4,LDofL9k_9QHAb0zBmWMcXQ

The BF and I went here for a couple of drinks and a snack prior to seeing Love.  I got this cucumber martini type drink.  The garnish alone was so classy.  It was cherry tomatoes with cucumber.  The drink itself was so refreshing and good.  Too many times cucumber drinks just don't taste right - this one you could really taste the cucumber in it and it didn't taste artificial either.  We also got the crunchy fries with the truffle and Parmesan dipping sauce.  These were cooked perfectly - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The sauce was so good too - though I am sometimes partial to truffle oil - it just tastes so good!  Definitely a good place to grab a quick drink.",QUGK3WduEPsZ3TSrfyRcGw,0,0,4,JLugqBwMZ4v8AdrscJ42FQ

2685011,2012-02-01,0,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Sunday night we had tickets to see the 9:30 Cirque du Soliel show at the Mirage, so we knew we'd be eating dinner there.  Earlier in the day we were walking that side of the strip (we were staying at Mandalay Bay) and stopped in to gamble a little and find a dinner option.

We first made a reservation at Kokomos, but after seeing  the menu at Stack, changed our minds and transferred the reservation.  I've never eaten at Kokomos, but after eating at Stack, I'm happy with our decision.

When we made the reservation we asked how long a typical dining experience is, as we had show tickets.  We were told an hour and a half, which is fine with me, I enjoy a leisurely meal.

I ordered a glass of Prosecco, which the BF upgraded to a bottle and shared with me.  We had the spicy crab appetizer, which was we both really enjoyed, the textures, temperatures, and flavors were all perfect.

The showpiece of our meal was definitely the ""steak for two,"" a 40oz porterhouse, served with whipped potatoes and two sauces.  We figured, if we were both going to order a steak, it would be more cost effective to order the one.  We were right.  And it was delicious.  It came sliced, so we could grab one piece at a time instead of trying to share off of the same plate while cutting from the bone.  The sauces were both great, the BF thought the peppercorn sauce was good, but too sweet to be called peppercorn. 

We skipped dessert, even though the selections were all delicious looking.

My only complaint about Stack is the seating.  We were sat in a corner booth, and I was looking directly at the table next to us, which was seated so close that we could hear their conversation.

All in all, it was a delicious experience.",722_fCJ6HiUcidSi2nGkZA,1,0,4,-LjEo5VHfbLklfMTNXE3SQ

There are many many bar/restaurants for you to choose from in the lobby but this one was one of my favorites. While they do close early for a bar in Vegas, they do have some great drink choices and awesome menu items for those who are not looking for a full meal. 

This is a basically choose your own seat establishment. You're greated by a waitress and given an ipad as a menu for drinks. Separately, you'll find that they have quite an extensive list of appetizer/entrees for those who are looking for food. Looking around, however, most people are here just for the drinks and ambience but you're missing out if you don't at least try anything on the menu!

The ambiance wasn't what I would call inviting-- sort of dark, presumably to dim the glare of so many sequined dresses flitting about. The service was...hmmm...not great. I asked for steamed vegetables instead of sauteed and they couldn't figure that one out. Then I could hardly find someone after they forgot the sugar I ordered with my tea.

We had a 7pm reservation but arrived at 6 for appetizers and a couple of drinks during Happy Hour at Stack.  We had the yellow tail, steak and lettuce wraps along with a couple of beers to start off with.  The Happy Hour special beer was limited to Bud / Bud Light - we went for Chimay and paid $14/glass - ouch!  The appetizers were good, the yellow tail sashimi was fantastic.  Great sauce and very good cuts of fish.  The steak on the sizzling rocks - good, but I think people may be impressed more by the presentation.  The lettuce wraps were also very good - nice blend of flavors.  The only downside was that the waitress could have cared less about paying attention to us - she was more concerned with talking with the bartender.

For dinner, we enjoyed items from the $40 Prix Fix menu - probably the best deal we could find.  This included an appetizer (all of us had the lobster tacos), a main course (steak, chicken or pasta), and dessert (either the mini doughnuts or the banana bon bon).  The food was very good - although the lobster taco appetizer was quite small, the accompanying guacamole sauce was excellent.  I had the chicken and grean beans for my main course and it was perfectly done.  Juicy and well prepared.  Our waiter was attentive, but not overbearing for dinner.

Without reservations at 10pm, we were subjected to a 20-minute wait, which allowed us some time at the tables.  Of course, we waited a little more when we returned and by that time I was starving.  When they seated us, there were no complimentary bread baskets.  Negative points.

I didn't want to spend a lot of money on the entrees so I got a roasted tomato soup and pigs in a blanket.  The soup came with a side of mini grilled cheese sandwiches, which, I'm sad to report, were the best parts of my meal.  The cheese was mild and the crust was taken off, which was fine by me.  I wish they used a different cheese though.  The soup itself was very acidic and a much bigger portion than I had expected.  The pigs in a blanket were 11 small bites served in a bowl with ketchup and mustard on the side.  They were extremely salty and I could have very easily done without this dish.

I don't mind spending two hours or more for dinner -- if it were some Michelin-star restaurant, which definitely wasn't the case at Stack.

The adult tater tots are incredible with a gooey Brie and bacon center.  I think the ketchup has a smokey flavor to it as well.  The baked mac and cheese was completely finished.  Very cheesy and crunchy with the Panko.   However the finishing touch was the jelly doughnuts.  That sweet sugary dough was perfect after the grilled steaks and savory dishes.

Last night I took my beautiful wife here for her 41st birthday.  

After a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and a tasty order of ""Hot Rocks"", We decided to share the Ultimate Surf & Turf.

This dish features a 40 oz. Porterhouse Steak and a 2 lb. stuffed Maine Lobster. It also includes 2 sides. We Got the Steamed organic asparagus, and the twice baked XL potato.

I would not consider STACK a steakhouse, but I have had their dry aged steaks, and now this enormous porterhouse. If I ever have a craving for steak in Las Vegas, here is where I will come. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and presented.  We honeymooned in Tuscany, and the famous of all butchers Dario Cecchini serves his Florentine steaks the same way. 

I'm from New England so enjoying a Maine lobster here in the desert is a treat. 
Perfectly cooked, the stuffing tasted wonderful with hints of lemon zest. I was apprehensive at first of the sauce that was drizzled over the lobster but found it complimented the stuffing beautifully. 

We finished with a complimentary assortment of sweets. They were all delightful!

I have posted pictures of this dining experience. BEWARE, they will make your mouth water. 

STACK is awesome. A true foodie haven. Consistency for a restaurant is tough in this day and age, and I'm happy to see that STACK has got it down.

3060155,2014-10-06,1,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Stack is one of the most beautiful restaurants in Las Vegas, and most definitely the best steakhouse in town. I dined here for my mother's birthday and had the best experience from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with luxurious African mahogany tables and wooden pannels tiered in a way that reminds me of the Antelope Canyon in Arizona. The lighting is dim and the music was up beat creating a fun yet intimate atmosphere. 
             To start off, the ladies at the door were very friendly and welcoming. Before we had time to approach the host stand we were already greeted with smiles. We were sat right away without waiting and the hostess wished my mom a Happy Birthday which was a very nice gesture that made her happy.
        Our servers, Zach and Manny were very attentive and had menus ready to go for us as soon as we sat down. My mother was unable to eat meat that night so she ordered the Seabass that comes with a delicious Lobster Risotto that literally melts in your mouth. Being a steak lover I ordered the Petite Filet with a side of Truffle Mashed Potatoes that have a unique taste unlike the regular mashed potatoes. For appetizers we shared the infamous Hot Rocks which are thin slices of sirloin beef in a spicy zesty ponzu sauce. Not only were they delicious but it was also fun to get to fry the meat on a hot rock at the table. My mother and I also ordered the Pigs in a Blanket and the Yellowtail Sashimi; they were equally delicious as everything else. Zach, our server made suggestions for our wines and we did not regret it. Since my mother had the Seabass a cold glass of Sauvignon Blanc was a perfect wine to top it off and I had the Prisoner red blend that went perfect with my steak. 
           The manager sent out a dessert for us that said Happy Birthday on the plate. That was very kind of him and made my mother very happy! It was a delicious Warm Chocholate Cake with a scoop of ice cream. It was the perfect size because after such a heavenly dinner we barely had room for anything else. 
           Overall experience was one of the best I've had as a diner. Everyone was attentive, approachable, and welcoming. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting or living in Vegas. Stack is the place to be!",bresa1Zzju0HPUC1uxfg2w,2,1,5,9AmIX08s7-rI1NiG8tGohQ

Told the hostess we were there, were sent to the bar , ( that had 2 guests and 2 bartenders). We looked around and the place was dead. We watched as the manager, and 3 hostesses and a bunch of waiters just stood there- and we were waiting.   A few minutes later, my brother went up and said, we do have a reservation how much longer do we have to wait - and they gave us some lame answer - but the place was dead!   A few minutes later we were seated and we knew right away this was trouble.
The waiter was awful, awful attitude and not the least bit attentive.
Any request we had he acted as if we were bothering him - rarely came by - and didnt come back to fill drinks unless we flagged him down.
This really wasnt good- because the food is GREAT - just the service is awful.  I would order everything at once - and pray.

We had lobster tacos, sashimi, nyc sirloin and drinks. Our bill was $175 for 2 people - for that money - we should have had far better service.

Darn near an hour later still no food, we asked for bread and the waiter comes and says he forgot to put in our order. Nothing else, didn't offer anything on the house or much of an apology. We were mad and complained to the manager and he turned it around. He apologized and offered our food and anything else we wanted from the menu. He reseated us and gave us new waiters and the service was outstanding. Best I ever had in fact. I really appreciate the turnaround because it means this place really cares about the customer which for those prices means a lot. 
Ok, now to the dining experience. The music is cool/top 40. The ambience is dark and sexy. The drinks are the best I have ever had (I had an old fashioned). For appetizers we had the wings and sliced beef on hot stones. Both two thumbs up. For food I had the chicken and green beans and adult tater tots. I was so stuffed I didn't want to stop eating it was just that good (and I couldn't take it back to the hotel). But atlas I had to call it quits. My friends had the steak with spinach (very good they said) and the salmon and mashed potatoes (darn near cleaned the plate and they raved about the mashed potatoes which looked like cool whip they were whipped so perfectly). 
Then we got a dessert sampling and their donuty things. Everything was heavenly. I'd recommend everything on the menu. 
To top it off they offered us a shot and coffee. This was a yummy recipe for sleepiness. This is not a meal you eat and then get ""turnt up"". It was so rich and flavorful it will send you right to dream land. 
Yes it is pricey but the food was so good I wouldn't complain if we had paid. (we did tip generously for the free meal, the later service made us feel like queens- they really know how to right things!)",ymLlD_Kqy6nrpdD-geAt0w,1,1,5,MWP8lpUc6zZBJ1d0qlplPg

PROS - there are way too much good food on the menu. But we ended up ordering the Seabass with lobster risotto and broth. It was the best Seabass ever. It was cooked perfectly. The risotto was very tasty. I would order it over and over and over again. We also ordered the hot stones which was of course very good.

I went to dinner here right before seeing the Beatles' LOVE show (which I will review later) and managed to get seated sans a reservation on a busy Saturday night (I was here for CES but the Adult Entertainment Conference was also in town).  

First impressions are very big to me when it comes to my first dining experience and so I was glad to be greeted by some smokin' hot waitresses.  Usually a sign of something exciting, though sometimes a sign that they're trying to compensate for something.  But I'm all about giving restaurants the benefit of the doubt.

The ambiance is super trendy, which also equals very loud!  I felt like I was in a club!  Not to mention, it was so dark in there I could hardly read the menus and you get seated so close to the table next to you, it's almost a requirement that you make new friends.  

The food was alright but according to my price-to-tastiness ratio, this place gets a C.   I had the house special risotto with black truffles which was actually an appetizer but came in an itty bitty bowl - very simple but way too greasy for my taste.  My coworker had a few of their American style appetizers (tater tots, etc) which were, not surprisingly, mediocre.

I took his recommendation to try the ""Brooklyn Filet"" which was like a two inch thick filet mignon served on the bone.  The steak was cooked to perfection (which, in my book, means ""barely"").  It was served with two different steak sauces, one was peppercorn based, the other was based on a red wine reduction.  I preceded the main course with an EXCELLENT mixed green salad, and I had the steak accompanied with their whipped potatoes.

My ONLY complaint is a minor one.  Although I do expect to pay dearly at a premium steak house (and Stack qualifies as a premium steak house in my estimation), I do miss the days where one could eat economically in Las Vegas. On this trip I've learned that those days are LONG gone.  I guess the casinos are no longer bringing in the money the way they used to, and they have to make money SOME how.

Luckily, Mirage is not wrong.  Their steaks are all so tender that there's really no need to even order the Filet, you can order any of the cuts and get more flavor and the same tenderness.  

The decor is steakhouse-ish, with it's low lights and dark tones, but the crowd is lively, they have an excellent bar, and the music keeps things pumping.  It's also got one wall open to the casino that allows the crowd outside to add to the vibe.

I had been wanting to try Stack for awhile now, so this most recent trip to Vegas seemed like a good time, especially with a $29.99 prix fixe menu available. The restaurant is dark and spacious and just gives off a cool vibe. My husband did the three course prix fixe and I just ordered off the regular menu. We tried:

Crispy calamari - way too salty, but the dipping sauces were really good

Strip Iron Steak with Whipped Potatoes - my husband thought it was good, but not amazing. 

BLT Salad - not watery at all which made me happy because most wedge salads I have had have the tendency to be watery. It was a nice size and was tasty.

Adult Tater Tots - we wished they had more of a brie flavor and were a bit disappointed because we thought this side dish was going to be better

Creme Brulee - it was good, but not the best

The food was 3 stars, but our service was five star. Our waiter was so nice and when he gave us the wrong prix fixe menu to start - he gave us the $45 pre-theatre prix fixe - he corrected his mistake when he realized we wanted the $29.99 one. He was attentive and it was such a nice touch when he had a dessert made for me for free so my husband wouldn't eat alone. Our dinner was $72 before tip, which we didn't think was bad at all.

However, what is #1 by far (and believe me, the food is fantastic on its own), is the people.

The wall decor is unique. I can tell a lot of money was invested.  The menu was preset, so that was good that I didn't have to think of what to order.

Shared appetizers:

 Hot rock slices of beef app was interesting. You cook thin slices of meat on this 600 degree rock.  Novelty at best.  

Tuna tartare? on a cracker was good.

Mini lamb gyros, delicious. But they brought out 8 pcs total. Uh...there are 12 of us?

Entree:

Filet mignon. It was better than your average steak, but not filet mignon status.  Had a pat of butter melting atop when served. 

Side dishes:

Although tasty, here's where it gets ugly. 1 SMALL bowl each of mashed potatoes, broccolini and green beans, and french fries.  Really? There are 12 of us at this table!  We each got like 1 tablespoon potatoes, 3 strands of green beans and/or broccolini, and a few fries.  Ridiculous.

Desserts:

Mini key lime cheesecakes.  Very good

Rasberry filled donut holes? with dipping sauce.  Also good. A plus that they were warm.

I think our bill came out to $850.  Overpriced, but an overall nice experience.  I think we would've been better off at Ruth's Chris or the like.",-fdk__ix5aZe_tlvwEqqYw,1,0,3,Dv9SwKNnMOj8Trt8u-SEHg

The hostesses were very friendly and greeted and seated us immediately.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and funny, and the service was really excellent.  He did a good job of being attentive without being annoying.

The decor is pretty cool ... it is dim and looks a bit like a cavern inside.  I have seen reviews where some people complain that it is too dark in there to read the menu ... I really don't understand that.  It's dim, but we had no problem reading the menu or seeing our food -- if you do struggle, I suggest going to an optometrist. It also isn't nearly as overcrowded as reviews led me to expect ... yes, the tables are relatively close together, but it is absolutely NOT like dining with the people at the table next to you, or anything like that.  I felt the dimness and the layout made it actually kind of cozy.  The music was nice and not too loud, but not yawn-inducing either.

The cocktails were delicious and nicely strong. 

The food was delicious!  We had hot rocks as the appetizer, and despite my klutziness trying to get the little pieces of steak onto the rock with my chopsticks, we had a lot of fun, and it was also really, really tasty steak with the marinade.  For dinner, my husband and I each had steak, and we shared an order of the adult tater tots as a side.  The steaks and the sauces they come with are amazing, and the tater tots were really delicious (bacon and brie in tater tots is a brilliant idea!).  For dessert, we had the jelly donut holes.

The design was interesting yet somewhat romantic.  The DJ made it a little loud but unless that sort of thing bothers you it was fine.  Service was top notch and very attentive.  They even responded well to an oddity.  I was hit in the head by flying glass.  I think a drunken cowgirl (hey, it's rodeo week) at the next table over couldn't handle her cocktail.  The staff from bussers to manager changed out all our drinks and cleaned the glass around our table swiftly.  Nice response by all.  We had the pigs in a blanket for an app.  Nothing fancy but just the right size and surprisingly tasty.  The sea bass with lobster risotto and shellfish broth was excellent according to my better half.  I'm not a fish guy but had a taste and it was very good.  I hit up the special which was Bbq spare ribs with potato salad, okra, and corn bread.  Fell completely off the bone.  Excellent smokey flavor.  So good I didn't even want to use any of the extra bbq sauce provided.  But it was quite good in its own right.  Forced ourselves to split a dessert and glad we did.  Had the raspberry donut holes with vanilla sauce.  So good and a nice sweet finish to such a savory meal.  Not a cheap meal but hey, you're paying for the quality and service and they make it worth it.

The ambiance is really cool...good tunes for an elevated volume and pretty staff/clientele. This is a nice place for a fun date or group because they have plenty of room for larger parties.

I took a bachelor party of 14 and made reservations about two weeks ahead of time, however, we had to wait for about 10 minutes before being seated and then were short two seats. The staff quickly fixed the error and we were comfortably seated.

The service was quite a bit slower than I expected, as our drink orders weren't taken until about 10 minutes after we had been given menus. Our drinks didn't come until about 1 minute before our entrees, which were delivered quickly and fresh.

I had the petit filet and it was wonderful...ruby red center and deliciously flavored. We had the adult tater tots and macaroni which were fresh and fantastic as well. I tried a bite of the Seabass and it's amazing, I'd definitely recommend that if you aren't a steak person.

I recommend a bit of expediency to the restaurant when it comes to a large group of gentlemen who are eager to make toasts, and get the drink orders and deliver them faster.

I really hope to return and have a better experience...the three star review is mostly due to the latency of service. Again, the food is fantastic.",mLg8M2G15J_szx8onvKM2w,1,1,3,5pKy-z30jas1ieNcrX0-fA
3613527,2017-03-01,1,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Husband and I came here on a Saturday night around 5:30 for dinner. We were going to see Boyz II Men after so we purchased a dinner and show package through the Mirage which gives you the Prix Fixe menu at Stack. 

Seeing as how it was early, it was not crowded at all...maybe 5 other couples were dining when we arrived. We were seated at a cozy little table. Ambience was great! I loved the hardwood design inside and the lighting was perfect in my opinion. 

Our server was great. We had been seated only a few minutes when we were greeted by him. 

We ordered a couple of drinks from the bar from him. I had an Old Fashioned and the hubby had the Ketel One Bulldog. My drink was perfect. Hubby's was tasty too. It was like drinking an alcoholic milkshake. Drinks were about $19 each which we weren't surprised. We kind of expected to pay more considering we were on the strip. We rarely venture out to the strip and the price of drinks is one of the reasons why, but for tonight, we dug our heels in. At least the drinks tasted great!  :)

A few minutes later, the chef stopped by our table to welcome us as well. Chef Eric was his name. Super nice man. He sent us a complimentary appetizer of the Hot Rocks which is thinly sliced sirloin you literally cook yourself on these giant hot rocks brought to your table. It was delicious! In addition, later during the dinner, the restaurant manager, Griffin, also stopped by our table to welcome us and see how our dinner was which we thought was very nice of him. We told him how we were going to see Boyz II Men and he offered up the tip, ""Make sure to catch a rose!"", as he left our table. I wasn't sure what he meant, but after seeing the concert, I understood! 

Back to dinner...For the Prix Fixe menu we each had a choice of one of the following:
Appetizer: TOMATO SOUP, WEDGE SALAD or ARTISAN MEAT & CHEESE COMBO
Entrée: MARY'S ROASTED CHICKEN, KING SALMON or 8 OZ. FILET
Dessert: JELLY DOUGHNUT ""MUNCHKIN"" HOLES

For the appetizer, I chose the artisan meat and cheese combo and the hubby had the wedge salad. It was enough for both of us to share. The wedge salad was delicious with creamy blue cheese dressing and crisp bacon. The Artisan Meat and Cheese combo had just enough cheese (blue, manchego one more I cannot recall) and meats (prosciutto, salami and one other I cannot remember). It was also served with honeycomb, and I believe what was quince jelly, green olives, strawberries and several slices of bread.

I cannot tell you about how satisfied I was with the entrees. I had the filet and hubby had the roasted chicken. My filet was cooked a perfect medium rare and practically melted in my mouth. It was so tender and cut like butta! It was served with a side of asparagus which was also cooked on point. Sometimes when I get asparagus, it is overcooked and limp beyond belief. This was just right. But I could not get enough of the filet! My husband had the roasted chicken. I had a bite of his and the chicken was soooo moist and cooked wonderfully. It was not dry at all. It was served on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes. And let me tell you, his roasted chicken was a very hefty portion size too! 

For dessert, you do not get an option, but we both were served the Jelly Doughnut ""Munchkin"" Holes. They were filled with a blueberry jelly and served with a side of crème anglaise sauce for dipping. You get about 3 doughnuts in each serving which turned out to be just enough. I'm a chocolate fiend, so I would have loved a chocolate dessert, but these were okay. 

I thought we were served a pretty fantastic dinner considering the price we paid for the prix fixe menu. It was definitely worth it. Like I said, the ambience was great and the staff was also amazing and attentive. The restaurant definitely filled up as we left. Would definitely love to go back and try more of this delicious food!",8dhny_lS11HkqAIXteYjig,0,0,5,_Sf_HbU39-_W1WrZ1MW94A

We did the $55 prix fixe bachelorette menu. I think there was a mix up in the beginning because we got some appetizers that wasn't supposed to be included. 

Champagne: It was a bit dry but not bad. I'm pretty sure it's nothing fancy though. 

Shared Appetizers: 

Lobster Tacos: They were tiny but they were cute!!! It was a bit on the salty side but it was tasty. I don't recall tasting the grilled mango though. 

Miso Black Cod: Pretty good. I noticed that the pieces of fish were not size consistent though. It wasn't fishy at all. 

Hot Rocks: Very tasty and fun! You get to cook you own piece of meat on hot rocks. Everyone at the table was having a blast with this. 

Pigs in a blanket: The weakest of all the appetizers. I could make better at home. 

The following 2 appetizers I believe were given to us by mistake. For a party of 7, we got 2 each of the 4 appetizers listed above. We only got 1 each for the below. I didn't think much of it at that time since I couldn't remember what was on the prix fixe menu. 

Yellowtail Sashimi: Yum! I wish I could trade in both orders of pigs in a blanket for one more order of this. 

Miso Hibachi Skewers: I only had a piece of the chicken and it was delicious. The others had nice things to say about the beef and pork. 

Entree: 

9 ounce Petite Filet: My filet wasn't cooked medium. It was more on the medium rare side. A few others weren't cooked to specification either. The filet was tender and flavorful and although the creamy peppercorn and red wine shallot sauces weren't needed, it helped to cover up some of the redness in the meat LOL! I could eat it but I just didn't want to see it! 

Sides: 

Baby vegetables: I love vegetables but omg, it was so salty. I got one serving and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. Either someone in the kitchen got salt happy or just hates the natural flavor of vegetables. 

French Fries: They had a nice kick of spice to it but too bad, they were also too salty. 

Whipped Potatoes: Not better than mom's, or my sister's....they lacked texture and flavor. 

Dessert: 

Jelly Doughnuts: I wasn't too impressed. It was too doughy and the vanilla sauce that came with it wasn't too impressive either. 

Mini Key Lime Cheesecakes: Not bad, but nothing unique. 

Mini Blueberry Cheesecakes: I prefer this one over the key lime. 

Such a nice start to dinner with a great variety of creative appetizers (except for the pigs in a blanket) and a nice entree but the sides and dessert just couldn't keep up. I would give Stack a higher rating if they work on their sides and if they provided stronger or more creative desserts.",NO06oKnVsIXl4mLQxOqERA,3,0,3,AYqgztXCFQlEchmR8b2arQ

It was myself, my wife, and two kids (8 and 11).   Most of the items are a la carte.  I think we picked 2-3 sides for the table and the wife and I got the porterhouse for two.  It was so f*cking delicious.  I don't know if it's because I haven't had a steak in a while or that it was really just that good.  It was probably a little bit of both, but I would totally go back and eat it again.   The presentation was really top notch as they delivered it pre-sliced with the bone in the center for you to gnaw on.   They also had a roasted garlic, of which I ate ever last clove.  I DGAF if it made me smell.  I'm a 40 year old dad and I'm allowed to smell.   I was totally into the parsley and thyme sprigs they used as garnish.  I ate every item that was edible.

Along with the stunning décor, service and food was top-notch. 

Our server, Kyle, effused an easy-going friendliness yet attentive professionalism throughout the evening. We perused the cocktail and wine list as Kyle suggested several beverage recommendations. Upon checking in on Yelp, we accepted the FREE offer for a House Shot then ordered a couple of Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPAs. We each received a House Shot of raspberry vodka.  

Meanwhile, we were deciding on our dinner selections and chose to split our meals because we were still sort of full from our lunch. Kyle accommodated us by having the kitchen split our fresh made Caesar salad and 24 oz. Tomahawk ribeye steak. He also recommended the Adult Tater Tots which were deep fried GB&D and stuffed with bacon and Brie cheese.  The Caesar salad was refreshing and the croutons, which I don't normally eat, were light and toasted crisp. The ribeye steak was AMAZING...tender, juicy, grilled-to-perfection and flavorful. It was huge and we were glad to share it between ourselves. Our Adult Tater Tots were large marshmallow sized hash brown ""plugs"". It's exterior was crisp fried golden brown while its interior was a bacon and Brie stuffed potato.  We were content and satiated from our fine steak when Kyle presented us with the Dessert Menu. Oh, our knees went weak when we noticed their Signature Mint Chocolate Bonbons served with Bailey's Irish Cream dip. Those ""bites"" into the bonbons were scrumptious and a chocolate-mint lover's dream!

As an app I got the Kale Salad. Super light salad, and definitely a good portion for you to eat. I can't really speak volumes about this particular salad as I think all Kale salad come out the same anyways.

Wild mushroom Risotto - Can't go wrong with the risotto tho! They threw in a very generous amount of parmesan cheese, and the more parmesan there is in a risotto, the better.

8 oz. filet - it's an 8 oz. so you know it'll be the size of your fist, but of course, it is a filet non the less, and it was juicy and tender. I recommend getting this especially since it costs almost as much as the pre-fix menu when you order it on their regular menu.

Blueberry Filled Jelly Donuts - Not a big fan of sugary sweets or jelly filled donuts so don't take my word for it. Super filling. So I only at 2 out of the 4 pieces. 

If you're heading to Stack for date night or a night out with friends. I'd recommend opting for this menu because you really get a bang for your buck on it.

The Lobster Taco were small, but delicious. I assume the regular appetizer comes with 4 tacos and I highly recommend them. The Skirt Steak was cook nicely at medium rare, and it is quite flavorful, but a little too overpowering by itself. Side orders must be ordered a la carte, and I had my steak with potato wedge French fries. Perhaps something lighter like mashed potatoes would have paired better with the steak. The Jelly Donut Munchkins Holes are super sweet, but too sweet for my liking.

Atmosphere is nice, it's not too dark and not too loud.

Pros: Incredible steaks - truly, one of the best steaks I have ever had anywhere (filet mignon and my husband's new york strip were perfectly cooked).  The mac and cheese is to die for.  I was jealous I didn't order this myself after tasting it.  Huge side portions for a nice steakhouse.

Cons: There really isn't anywhere to sit while waiting to be seated, except on the casino floor - kind of awkward.  Also, the music is way too loud.  I know I always sound like an old lady when I say that - but there were 8 of us here for dinner at a roundtable in the center of the restaurant and I could not hear what anyone said except for the people seated immediately to either side of me.

Why? Because escrow has been an absolute nightmare and she's been exceedingly patient. And for that we're grateful. And it's an excuse to baller-dine.

Bygones. I easily booked via Open Table and we met up with our seller on Tuesday evening for dinner. After letting us know she wasn't a seafood person, we ordered the Hot Rocks sirloin appetizer (so delicious, had it the first visit) and the short rib meatballs. Also fantastic. 

B and I split the dish that inspired our return to Stack in the first place, the Stuffed Maine Lobster, which was as mouthwatering as the first time we had it. Our seller had the Petite Filet, which looked to be perfectly med-rare, as ordered. She raved about it. 

Two sides were shared by the table, the Tater Tots and the Mac & Cheese. Both of these are good, but I feel as though they could be elevated with some culinary thought. Tater Tots with truffle dipping sauce would tip this over the edge...ketchup really falls flat. The mac and cheese, well....it's pretty standard mac and cheese. *shrug*

Service at Stack on both visits has been on point. No complaints there! The restaurant is swanky yet relaxed, romantic in a casual ""Hey, I just met you and this is crazy, but here's my number, Stack, reserve a table for me, maybe""

Four solid stars. I teeter on five based on the sides. XO we'll return either way for that lobster!

Oh, and I have to give props to our little Vizsla, because when prompted to explain what about our buyer letter prompted the seller to choose our offer over an all cash investor...

Without hesitation, her reply ""It was Honey."" Her Huntington Dog Beach picture clinched our new home. Who woulda guessed. 

I guess I owe another steak to you-know-who with the paws. *wink*",Zj5Caq3EXPQD8g4gV8KoMw,13,11,4,1yvdggU5ujtPnvRavEnXDA

Started the evening with a few drinks and the ""hot rocks"". They made a mistake with my drink (titos & tonic instead of soda) which is an acceptable one. But what got me was no apology, or anything as if I was the one who ordered the wrong drink. FYI anybody who knows me, knows I HATE tonic....

I took a sip and instantly knew it was tonic and mentioned to the servers. They replaced the drink without acknowledging, apologizing or anything.... ok fine.


Second mistake, we both ordered a Kobe burger, one without bacon. They brought out one without bacon and one without egg??? Nobody asked for no egg so????

They took the uneaten burger back and in 15 min time brought out the new burger again with no apology or anything. For a 4-5 ""star"" restaurant one would expect more. In all honesty I would expect these types of mistakes from an Outback Steakhouse not a place that charges $30 for a burger....

This place is dark. If you wanted to take photos of your friends interacting and such, don't do it here. It would require flash and blinding your friends. The place is chilly too, so bring a light coat. Very trendy,

I got the sea bass because everyone on Yelp said it was delicious... and it was pretty good. It was SMOOTH. The taste was great, but after awhile it became meh. It could had been because I was full but it was good if you're not full.

Lobster - husband got the lobster and that was good. It wasn't spectacular but it was good. It better be for $80.

Chicken Wings - my husband loves chicken wings, so we got this... and it was good. Very small - which was expected but really good.

Adult Tater Tots - meh

3971362,2010-09-22,2,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"This is a difficult review to write.  I had the $39.99 prix fixe tasting menu about which the Mirage has been sending me emails for a few months.  

All the food I had was excellent.  I had lobster tacos, the prime skirt steak, and the jelly donut munchkin holes for dessert.  These get high marks in my review.  The tacos were luscious--the guacamole served with them was excellent!  The skirt steak was served with two sauces that were also very well done.  The munchkin jelly donut holes were really tasty with or without the vanilla sauce that came with them.

Now for the minuses.  I had no bread service.  Evidently, if you order from the prix fixe menu, there is no bread service.  I didn't notice this until I was almost finished with my steak, so I didn't bother to ask then.  The steak came with two thin waffle potato chips.  That's it--no side of any kind, not a carrot slice, one broccoli floret, nothing!  I found it amazing when the server suggested I might want to order a side so I had enough to eat.  I did order a side of mashed potatoes at $8.  That sort of negates the prix fixe of early dining.

When I first arrived the waitress brought me a ""new"" prix fixe menu at $59.99 that I should consider as it would entail more food.  This is not on the Mirage website.  I did notice there was more food served including sides.  It seems to be a bait and switch scheme, but maybe no.

I considered giving Stack a 2 rating but the food was all so good, I just couldn't.  I do know I won't be returning here.

And the beautiful interior... the beautiful wood paneling reminds me of something from the Valley of Fire.

The first time I came here, we did the Hot Rocks and shared the Tomahawk Ribeye with 2 sides (mac&cheese and whipped potatoes).
Hot Rocks- thinly sliced sirloin that you can literally cook in front of you on top of a hot rock.  A little overpriced but it was a fun experience.
Tomahawk Ribeye is 24oz of amazing goodness, at medium well.  Getting it with the balsamic reduction mmmmmmmm.  Their mac&cheese is so cute and delicious with bits and pieces of bacon inside (vegetarians watch out!!!) and their whipped potatoes are also a wonderful complement as well.

The second time, we did the great prix meal.  We started off with the Champagne Toast, Market Green Salad, Shared Appetizers (Mini Lamb Gyros, Short Rib Meatballs, Ahi Tuna Tartare, Crispy Rock Shrimp), 9oz Flat Iron Steak, Shared Sides (Mixed Veggies, and Mac&Cheese, and Shared Dessert (Icecream Sandwiches, and Donut Holes).

Note, there was a vegetarian in our bachelorette group the night we did the prix meal and although not the best, they did have babaganoush and falafel.

Although we got a greater variety of food to nibble on with the prix meal, I will be sticking to the normal dinner menu next time.

Even with half price, the appetizers still run $8-12, but I think they're pretty good. The chili cheese fries are very unique in a ""gourmet"" way, the lobster tacos were great, and I am a sucker for the ""hot rock."" Pigs in a blanket were pretty standard, as was the shrimp cocktail. The funny thing about the lobster tacos was they are tiny. I don't mean small, like a street-food style taco, I mean tiny like what you would make with a play-do play set as a kid. Or maybe the size of a gummy candy you get in the shape of a taco. Literally, they are each about 1.5"" long. I would have really been pissed if I had to pay the $21 full price for them!
It does get pretty noisy in here since it's open to the casino and it has a very bar/lounge-y vibe. Service was good and at 5:30, we were able to walk right in to a bar table without reservations.

The beginning! Yellowtail Crunch and the Hot Rocks(sirloin you cook yourself) are a fantastic start. The Pan Seared Dumplings are good as well. If they have the crab sticks( i believe that was the name) order them! Amazing!!  Now to the salads. Love their garbage salad, very unique combinations of different favors. Their Caesar is good as well...VEry pricey on both $15-18 !  Now to the main course:  The ultimate steak for 2 is 40oz of incredible meat!! It comes with delicious Potatoes and 2 amazing sauces. Its a whopping $94. Their filet is very good! The Seabass has a very tasty broth over it and the Kobe Burger with Onion Rings is excellent as well. For dessert I have only tried the key lime pie and it was very good. In conclusion, the service is always excellent at Stack with attention to every detail. For large parties they have a curtained area in the back that can seat 20 or so. The prices are very expensive but the food is excellent and those steak sauces!!! mmmmmmmm!!

Our server, Manny, was awesome and made great recommendations.  To start we had the seafood tower filled with the biggest prawns I've ever seen, oysters, lobster and king crab; hot rocks beef which was thinly sliced beef that cooks on a scalding hot rock (hence the name); and the calamari and shrimp.  

My friend and split the petite filet and the seabass. They were nice enough to split it for us so we each got a nice plate with both items. For sides we ordered the adult tator tots filled with bacon and Brie (AMAZING); asparagus with truffle hollandaise; sautéed mushrooms; and the twice baked potato.

Even I was beyond stuffed, we ordered a few desserts for the table. There was a molten chocolate cake; jelly donut holes with a vanilla dipping sauce (so yummy); bon bons with a mint ice cream center and a dipping sauce; and raspberry sorbet.

We went late, after the early showing of ""Love"" (highly, highly recommended, BTW). They got off to a good start when a request for an extra spicy bloody mary with no celery delivered in solid fashion. Then, we had appetizers for the table:

Hot rock beef: Quite nice, thinly sliced and great with a cooking time of, oh, about 1.5 seconds per side :) 
Yellowtail sashimi: Fresh taste but not up to par with a top sushi restaurant. 
Chili cheese fries: An upscale twist on an everyday dish. The chili was fantastic; a bowl of it would make a great meal. 
Adult tater tots: Very large tots stuffed with bleu cheese (I believe); very, very tasty and generous portion. A little shy on cheese, though, as someone else noted. 
Lobster tacos: Tasty and full of tender lobster, but a but small. 
Pigs in a blanket: Interesting shape, but not otherwise remarkable

For my entree, I chose the bone-out sirloin, medium rare. It was cooked to perfection, very flavorful and juicy. A definite winner. My wife and step-daughter had the surf and turf which looked small on the plate, but was huge on taste and tummy-filling satisfaction. 

Finally, the jelly filled donut holes for dessert were plentiful and heavenly in taste and texture. 

Since nobody in our party drank more than one drink and we shared a lot, we just split the bill ten ways. The total per person, including tip and tax, was $90. I commented at the time that a similar meal back in Dallas, outside of the luxury hotel markup, would have probably cost $75-80, so not a bad premium. 

Please be advised that I'm pretty stingy on the five star ratings; this particular restaurant missed it because of some of the appetizers, limited menu and lack of an absolutely killer entree among the ones we ordered.",2-qk8ijAEjYszDZXwRmbQA,0,0,4,_ip2bNGk9L3bF0gqhMxwoQ

A warm and inviting yet mature setting that is elevated but not too serious. Even in the presentation of the food, they used mini cast iron casserole dishes for their side dishes and appetizers. Service was perfectly timed and excellently professional.

Entree: Seabass w/ Lobster Risotto
Sides: Truffle Fries, Adult Tater Tots, Sauteed Spinach
Dessert: Sugar coated raspberry donut holes with vanilla bean sauce

Everything we ordered was AMAZING. There wasn't anything that we ordered that tasted badly and I highly recommend everything I've listed in our list of ordered food. The main star of the evening though was the Sea Bass. I have never tasted such a perfectly cooked piece of great quality fish in my life. Paired with the lobster risotto (which was heavy on the lobster.... not a bad thing), the dish was definitely devoured in whole. The perfect way to end such a great meal thus far was when we ordered the raspberry jelly filled donut holes. They were warm, slightly crispy on the outside, but oh so good. They were like the fattier American style of French Beignets.

The cavernous effect does have a downside, however.  Noise. We knew the table 3 rows away was from St. Louis just from being able to hear their convo.  

Lets first say that we are not 20somethings living on mommy & daddy's dime and don't go places to be seen which is the vibe we both got from here.  I understand the Light group marketing concept which is have a bunch of hot chicks around and the men with money will show up.  Gotcha.  Makes for great people watching too.  

Anyway, we just wanted to have some tapas like appetizers so we had the bacon/brie adult tater tots -- perfect except we needed 2 orders of them since we were fighting over the 3rd one.  Parm/chicken pops.  melt in the mouth delicious. And the main reason we went, the cooked on the hot rocks thin marinated stacked steaks.  Yum.  

As our ""main"" course we had grilled cheese and tomato soup.  equally yum.  

So why only 3 *** if the food was good.  

The service is terrible.  Even with reservations we had to wait 20 minutes.  There is no separate area for the ongoing bachelorette party of 8 giggle girls at 1 table and 6 at another.  

Once seated, we became invisible to the point where my dinner companion had to go hunt down someone to take our drink order after waiting at the table another 30 minutes.  If the 4 guys at the table next to us hadn't been so enthralling amusing trying to pick up at least 1 of the girls from table #2 of swingles, you can bet we'd of left.  

The over all time from arrival to check signing was 1.9 hours.  For simple tapas & soup..way too long.  Even on a holiday weekend.  Coupled with the fact that 3 tables seated after us were gone by the time our main course came, didn't help my mood.  

We even accounted for the fact that it was a holiday weekend and apparently since the economic downturn, Vegas waitstaff has lost it's ability to hustle.

My drink was stiff which I like. But the service was horrible. Juan had an assistant, so we expected good service. By the time we ordered our food, we never saw Juan or his assistant again. My boyfriend's drink was gone before he received his steak and he was never offered another drink-- probably because we never saw Juan again! My boyfriend ordered his steak medium, I ordered mine Medium rare, and his was cooked less than mine! It was definitely rare. We couldn't say anything because like I said, we never saw our server! I was a server for 5 years thru college, so I know the two bite-two minute rule. I am honestly appalled that nobody checked up on us or asked how our food was; especially since our steaks were $50+. I want servers to work for their tip; they can't just expect it... Too bad Juan didn't work harder.  And it's not like it was too busy and he was apologetic; that'd be a different story. Would like to return to enjoy the food again (mine was cooked deliciously) but the service is a huge part to the dining experience.

We were given paper menus for the food, which were difficult to read with the dim lighting and our 50+ eyes, and tablet with the drink menu, which was interesting. We ordered martinis (very pricey) and asked for a sample of an ""unfiltered"" Belvedere Vodka, which Juan was happy to accommodate. We ordered a simple Caesar Salad (all salads serve 2 - thus the seemingly outrageous price), I had the King Crab Cocktail and hubby had the Swordfish Steak. The food was delicious and was well prepared and seasoned! The only complaint is that halfway through the meal Heidi showed up and introduced herself and that was the only time we saw her. We had already told Juan that we were going to the show and hoped that he would time everything appropriately.

I didn't want to be a bitch, but I told the waiter, who brought over the manager. The cuts of meat were good, and the sides were nice (the mac and cheese side was great) but I just wanted the guy to know that it seemed a little odd that FOUR of NINE MAINS were wrecked by the chef who doesn't seem to have a real handle on his grill.

I was thinking we'd get one main comped, or SOMETHING, but the bill came and absolutely nothing was done about it. I called over the manager and he offered to buy us a couple glasses of wine - we're settling up, we've got our coats on, that seems a little trite. It kind of pissed me off and I stuck to my guns, said ""we heard great things about this place, your man in the back destroyed 4 meals, there's got to be something you can do"". He finally relented and comped us the lamb and bought us a couple shooters, which I appreciated, but it took a WHOLE LOT of discussion. 

I'd give this place a pass if you're in a big group - I don't know how 9 meals at the same time (when 6 of them were steaks!) possible overwhelmed the chef - the place was only half full - but be wary, whomever runs the grill here doesn't seem to fully comprehend its power.",pGx__CPrM_0Tc6knBtyUWg,0,0,2,k8Q_yzc5uiyO6k8KfbO9sQ

We knew it would be pricey, but I know for the perfect steak it is worth the price.  For every steakhouse I base my review on the cut of steak they started with, and how it is cooked.  Some places start out with a bad cut of meat and still cook it right, and other places have a beautiful slab of meat that they absolutely destroy.  And depending on the repuation of a place, I will order the rareness of my steak differently.  

When we had dinner at Stack, I took the risk and ordered my ribeye steak medium.  It was called the Tomahawk steak with the bone in. When it came to the table, I was floored... it was a beautiful thick-cut ribeye still attached to the full bone, which extended impressively off the plate about 12"" or more!  The presentation alone was magnificent.  And then the taste was spot on... they used a type of herbed butter, but it did not take away from the taste at all.  It was a perfect medium, not too rare and not overcooked.  It is places like this that make me want a steak dinner every day! 

My boyfriend ordered the fillet... and it was perfectly tender.... almost like butter! I am so glad he shared a bite with me.

We also shared the asparagus with truffle hollandaise which complemented the steak perfectly.

To finish it all off, we had the creme brulee with cherries... it was fantastic! Again, the presentation was so fanciful, as it came in a thin swirly dish in the shape of a slender ""S.""

*Champagne Toast
*4 tapa-style appetizers: Hot Rocks, Pigs in a Blanket, Lobster Tacos, Miso Black Cod Lettuce Wraps.
*A choice of 3 Entrees: Filet, Organic Chicken, or Penne Pasta
*3 sides: Crunchy Steak House Fries, Whipped Potatoes, Sauteed Spinach
*3 desserts: Banana Brownie ""Bon Bons"", Warm Chocolate Cake, Jelly Doughnut ""Munchkin"" Holes.

The Food:
*Champagne - Tasted like cheap $5 Cook's champagne
*Hot Rocks - the raw meat ( a bit on the salty side) was really tender and tasted pretty good after leaving them on the hot rocks. Remember to drink some water with this dish.
*Pigs in a Blanket - they were pretty much the baby hotdogs and there wasn't anything so special about this appetizer. 
*Lobster Tacos - I didn't taste any mango on this, but it was just OK
*Miso Black Cod Lettuce Wraps - TOO much sauce for a small lettuce cup.
*Organic Chicken - I personally didn't like this at all. Granted it was juicy and lean, it didn't taste ""well done"".  Due to the dim lights in the restaurant, I wasn't even able to check if it was pink at all.  The string beans weren't cooked all the way and could have used a TRIM on the ends.
*Petite Filet - I didn't try this but the girls said it was pretty good.
*I tried a little bit of the Penne Pasta - This was definitely a winner! Parmesan, proscuitto and black truffle definitely complimented this dish. 
*Sauteed Spinach (side dish): Only ate this because it was in front of me.  VERY salty and overcooked. Yuck.
*Only tried the Jelly Doughnuts out of all the desserts. It was VERY sweet and not that bad.

PROS:
*Nice server
*Nice ambiance
*C's Penne Pasta

CONS:
*Horrible Service by taking a LONG TIME - Took over 1 hour for our food to come out and we were rushed to eat fast to leave so we can make it on time for clubbing.

*Food - The food was nasty. No presentation.  My left over chicken had better presentation.

We went for happy hour... four of us.  I believe it was 5-7pm?  Anyway, the selection consisted of kobe chili cheese fries, lettuce cups, buffalo style wings, and a few other things.  Roughly $8-9 each.  I couldn't imagine paying double for these.  Of course, sin city IS the most expensive place in the US to eat, now.  Regardless, we were seated at a very low-top table next to the casino floor which we liked.

Now, have you seen the episode of Seinfeld where Elaine threatens the diner owner for all of his waitresses being ""similar""?  Yeah, same concept here.  All looked to be Eastern European with black hair, tanned, and smokin' hot bodies.  Not that I'm complaining, but pretty odd.  Top that all off with the personality of a troll.  I'm sure it was due to the fact that we were there for a drink or two and apps, but if you want a tip, then do your damn job.  We waited about 10 minutes after our drinks came just to see a menu.  Finally ordered.  Two guys got the fries and wings, and I got the fries and lettuce cups.  Their food came out first, and she brought me the wrong french fry item.  I sent them back since I didn't want to pay $15 for some steak fries and some orange looking goo.  By the time they attempted to bring us three orders of lettuce cups (we ordered one), most everyone was done with their meal.  

The 4th in our party actually ordered a non-happy hour item:  Mini lobster tacos.  Mini is such an overstatement with regards to these.  I think Micro is more suitable.  Anyway, we're talking $5 a BITE.  They were literally the size of my thumb, and he got 4 on his order.  Livid sums up how he felt after this.

Anywway, is the food good?  Yes, what we ordered was good.  Was it worth even coming for happy hour or for the shit service we got?  Not even close.  Save your time and money and put some money on the over at the sports book.",yY2B4hC8FahkUp1qLDaMBw,0,0,2,-1JMnfJ9NM8lsBiHrPhPjQ

4462548,2009-09-24,0,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Came to Stack for dinner with a bunch of friends.  Stack is an upscale New American/Steakhouse restaurant located inside the MGM.  The two things I've noticed right off the back is that Stack is very stylish and also very dark.  Everyone at our table was complaining about how dark the place Stack is. 

We didn't have reservations but was still able to walk in on a Saturday Night at 8PM.  As mentioned before Stack is New American Cuisine with several steak options too.  Soe we are talking about Kobe Beef Burgers, Lobster Tacos, Steak Fries with Truffles, and Tater tots with Brie and bacon and the prices here reflect the high end items too.  Prices start at around $15 for most of their menu options and if you're looking for a steak here they start at $40.  Also, everything here is served ala carte, so you're going to have to pay extra for sides. 

Looking over the menu decided to get Grilled Meatball Pizza and other people got the Pork Chops, the Sirloin Steak, and the Kobe Beef Burger along with Mac & Cheese, Wings, Tater Tots, and Steak Fries as sides.  When we got the food, it came out in a reasonable amount of time and everything came out at once. 

My Pizza wasn't anything I expected.  It was a super thin crust pizza (we're talking about the thickness of a cracker) cut into about 8 2 inch squares with just one meatball (about the size of a sweedish meatball) in the center of each ""slice"".  The portion size was decent, the sauce had a nice bit of spice too, the kobe beef meatball was good and decently flavored, but I still can't get over the cracker they used as a crust.  Just not my thing and was thinking more of ""pizza"" crust than a Ritz Cracker crust. 

I tried all of the appetizers and by far the best was Steak Fries.  It wasn't the fries itself, but the sauce that came with it was excellent.  It was almost like a chipotle/mayo taste to it and was excellent.  The wings were good, but very small.  They were more like wing lollipops than your traditional wings.  The seasoning they used was good.  The mac and cheese was good, nothing mind blowing but good.  And finally the tater tots, to be honest they reminded me too much of what I had from the school cafeteria and while you did get hints of the brie and bacon, I just thought they were just ok. 

Comments from the table pretty much ranged in the just OK area whether it was the Burger, Sirloin, or even the other guy that ordered the Pizza.  The guy who ordered the Pork, didn't like it and thought it was overcooked and tough to eat. 

The service here is professional indifferent.  The waiter did spill water on me when trying to refill a glass and just kind of blew off as no big deal and of course on a scale of 1 - 10 I would rank it as a 4.  Yeah annoyed, but not pissed, probably would have been a two if the waiter wasn't so indifferent.  Also I noticed we didn't get bread and several other tables did, so not sure if you had to pay for it, or again the waiter being indifferent about it. 

My share of the food came out to be about $40.  I'm sure I put in more than others, but WTF.  As to recommendation, to be honest the food was good, but I was hardly blown away especially at the prices you pay at.  I guess I feel the same way about Stack as the waiter felt about us, indifferent.  You could do better, but you could also do worst in Vegas, take it or leave it and from a meh feeling, Stack gets a 3 star rating.",BclQLeF-geeAYb5Re98thA,0,0,3,Bdyru-XxRKCF0STFvBrs9Q

The food was great and the hostess and service staff we're friendly.  For the appetizers we ordered the hot rocks where you cook thin steaks on it.  Very cool. We also ordered the buffalo chicken wings, which had the right amount of kick and they were very easy to eat with only one bone sticking out.  The perfect sophisticated buffalo wings. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with kale, and they were amazing.  The others at the table ordered steaks and were satisfied.  You do order your sides separate.

The Hot Rocks is thinly sliced sirloin marinated in tangy soy and sesame oil sauce and arranged raw on a place. A heated rock is brought in a steam rack and the meat is cooked briskly on the sizzling surface. It was delicious, however 6 slivers of beef isn't going to cut it for an entree. I had to order a second serving.

The tator tot side dish was $10 for 6 tots. Practically robbery! The lamb shank was the only offering that looked hearty and filling, however the portions compensate for the lack in flavor. I'd rather eat 2 bites of heaven than scarf down a plate full of crap. 

Food was good, but here is my only complaint: when I drop $150 for a 2person dinner I expect to be happy and sluggish, not longing for a snack 30 mins later.

We started off our meal with the Hot Rocks appetizer. I think I liked the presentation and DIY aspect of this dish more than the actual taste. It was very unique and somewhat nerve racking to cook your own meat, but the flavor just seemed to be missing a little something. 

For a main dish I had the scallops while my boo had the burger. The scallops were cooked perfectly and I couldn't get enough of the puree. I even ended up dipping my potatoes in the puree to give them a bit more flavor. My bae said the burger was delicious, but huge and super messy to eat. The mushrooms we shared, spectacular. I'm a huge mushroom fanatic and these were delicious and more than enough for two people.

Instead of agreeing and doing so, he goes and looks for first waiter, comes back and tells us we did not order onion rings as appetizer with first waiter...uh duh, we just did with you.  So he asks if we are sure...yes we are...oy!!

Eric's relatives ordered the 40 oz steak for 2 and asked for spinach instead of 2nd mashed potatoes...that did not get computed and they got 2 potatoes, 2 spinaches....Eric ordered Brooklyn filet with scampi - asked for it medium, got it rare.  Had to send back but it was better the 2nd time.

I got small shellfish stack - small lobster tail (gave to Eric), big crab legs that came out of shell nicely, 4 oysters, 2 tiger prawns, baby tabasco sauce, mignonette, on ice...pretty good and filling, nice presentation.  We were too full for dessert.

Appetizer -  Shellfish Stack (picture of this will be uploaded)
Main course - Me and the date shared the 9 oz petit filet and sides
Sides - Adult Tater Tots and Baked Mac & Cheese
Dessert - Banana Cream Pie bites

Service was alright - nothing impeccable. They were there when we needed them, and came by once to refill drinks.

I have to say I was SUPER disappointed that no bread was brought out to the table. I can't think of one ""Fine-dining"" experience where I haven't had something small set at the table prior to ordering - heck, even Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden, and Lucille's smokehouse bring out something.

Shellfish Stack looked fantastic.  If any restaurant wins for presentation, Stack should definitely be recognized as a nominee.  Great-looking food served uniquely.   It wasn't the best seafood I've had, but can't complain.

Steak was tasty, but I've had better (Gallagher's at NYNY has some great meat!).

I thought for sure that the Adult Tater Tots would taste fantastic according to reviews and the server's suggestion, but to my surprise they tasted a bit undercooked and as though they'd been sitting out for too long before being served.  But the baked mac & cheese was yummy!

Dessert was also okay... and not too pricey.


OVERALL - If you want to experience a restaurant with different presentation, try this.  If you want good food at a good price, try another restaurant.  Our bill was about $160 bucks (with only two mixed beverages).... even Morton's - which me and my date agreed is much better - isn't this expensive.",4U380Xqra6lpKWZ6FoO58w,2,1,3,Qz0RqpiHtg97chme_30RGQ

To start we enjoyed some oysters - complemented with an onion vinegar dressing horseradish and cocktail sauce - they were mouthwatering. My boyfriend also started with the Bibb Wedge Salad - butter lettuce complemented with a savory blue cheese vinaigrette - wonderful. For our main we shared the 14oz Brooklyn Filet and King Crab and the Adult Tater Tots - the filet was like butter, the crab like silk on your tongue and the tots they left you breathless - a combination so stunning, it's like a little piece of heaven in your mouth. For dessert, we enjoyed the Bon Bons - the most amazing little bits of minty chocolate goodness. The service was phenomenal and the dining experience was superb.

The steak for two also came with whipped potatoes, delicious.

We ordered the jalapeno crab tacos ($24 for four tiny little tacos) to start.  They were alright but I'd probably skip them if I ever dined here again, the meat and potatoes were more than enough food. The signature cocktails are about $20 each, which just sounds ridiculous. I'd skip that too.

However, there's literally a cut of butter on top of the steak so maybe that's what that reference is for. It's a fatty steak so you'll cut a bit off but thats common for this cut. We also had the kale salad and the seabass, both of which were also really delish. We had no problems with wait time as some others mentioned.

We waited a few minutes for our reservations and eventually were seated at a long table. We did have 2 split tables so about 10 at each one (the benefit of this was when the bill came).

Everything on the menu looked good, but I knew I wanted to the crab and Jalapeno tacos. My friend and I decided to share 2 appetizers and a salad.

So, about 10-15 minutes later one of our appetizers arrives! We look around our table and make sure it's ours and then start devouring it. About another 15 minutes later our 2nd appetizer arrives (which should be the tacos), but our appetizer is definitely not tacos.

We tell the waiter that we should have recieved the tacos and he insists that we are the ones that are incorrect (how dare we accuse him for bringing the wrong appetizer). He says we probably ate the wrong 1st appetizer. He leaves for a few minutes and then says, yea you ate his food and he ate yours. Hmmm that's werid, because you guys put that food in front of US and not our friend who is 2-3 seats down. Both of the appetizers that we ordered had tuna, so had no idea we were eating the wrong appetizer. 

The only attempt at rectifying the situation was, ""so would you like me to order you something else"", no I'd rather not spend another $19 on appetizer that I should have been given, thanks anyway.

What was even more crushing was the tacos were the one thing on the menu I was looking forward to eating. :(

Anyway, despite the horrible server, I thought the food was good. We got the garbage salad and the portion was good enough the share and I thought it was delicious. Both of our tuna appetizers were also tasty, and I snuck half of a friends Tater tots and liked those!

Oh make sure you order the popovers! And hopefully you get seated in a different area as we did...and if you didn't know this dining rule now you do: It is your responsibility to make sure you are eating the correct appetizer.",mdKv-JoUXHzcMXV22BCYig,0,0,3,eDhR_jDQ37qv9Xf15xlMFA

Food was excellent. I had the short rib with the whipped potatoes and tried just about every appetizer on the menu. The best one in my opinion was the crab fondue with the bread.  Great flavor and good portion. The short rib was cooked perfectly and was very tender.  The whipped mashed potatoes were probably too creamy for my liking but still good.

Service was some of the best I've every had.  We always had full drinks and a clean table.  They were very attentive to us. 

My only complaint is the price.  In my opinion this restaurant is much too expensive. I understand it's on the strip and prices will be higher but usually you can at least count on larger portions for the price.  You can share some things but most appetizers and meals weren't very large so be cautious if this is your plan.

Hubby got the Hot Rocks appetizer, which are thin slices of beef that you cook at the table on a hot stone. It was fun to watch hubby try to cook with chop sticks! Regardless, he seemed to love it. My dad and I both got the Buffalo Rock Shrimp. They were breaded shrimp with buffalo sauce and blue cheese dip. I love all things buffalo so I gobbled them up!

For dinner, hubby got lamb with potato gnocchi, mom got sea bass, and dad and I got short ribs with polenta. My short ribs were tender and delicious. The polenta was also delicious. Mom's sea bass was HUGE- she gave me a bite and it was perfectly cooked. The smartest person in our party, though, was hubby. His lamb was falling off of the bone and the gnocchi was amazing. His dish also had tons of mushrooms in it, which I LOVE. I was definitely jealous of hubby's dinner!

For dessert, we had peanut butter and jelly chipwiches. They were peanut butter cookie ice cream sandwiches with peanut butter chips, jelly sauce, and chocolate sauce. I would eat these every day if possible!

The ambience is really cool, although the music was a little too loud for my parents. The lighting is low and the interior is really ""loungy."" There are lots of really beautiful people both eating and working at Stack!

The food was really good. We started off with oysters with a green sauce and bacon on top. Who thought of that? Bacon.. on oysters.. Genius! It came with a lemon slice and a little Tabasco sauce. I ordered the salmon for my entree and unfortunately, I had it sent back to the kitchen. I've never done this type of thing because I feel so terrible asking them to redo anything over! I usually just suck it up and eat it. However, I was not informed that the salmon would be more raw in the middle. I thought they would cook it all the way through, so I was so surprised when I got towards the center. I asked the server and he said, yep, that's how the salmon works, medium rare. He didn't tell me that before. He did bring it back without any problems though. They even gave me a whole new piece of salmon! I felt so bad, but I didn't want to eat raw salmon. It was definitely delicious after though. Mac and cheese was standard, in my opinion. There wasn't anything particularly outstanding about it. I had the banana lemon dessert after with a scoop of chocolate ice cream. It was so good! The dessert was tangy and sweet and the ice cream was super chocolatey. I would say the food is pretty good for what you're paying for.

Like how hard is it to pour red bull and vodka into a glass and fill up four shot glasses..? I'll tell you one thing, it takes about 30 seconds not 30 minutes. We had to remind the waiter several times and each time they said, ""They are still preparing your drinks!"" Horseshit! 

There was 50 of us in our party, so we had a bunch of appetizers and finger food. Spicy tuna roll (SO GOOD), buffalo wings, pigs in a blanket,  scallop lettuce cups, bread sticks, raw meat with hot rocks, and mini shrimp tacos. It was delicious food, but again service was extremely slow and half of us didn't get anything to eat. And what a random combination of food to bring us I thought. I don't eat meat at all, but was starving so just ate the fish entrees. Tasty. 

The only thing we had to worry about was the gratuity and the rest was on the company. They put stuff on our bill that we didn't even order like a Cesar Salad and Steak Fries. We told the waitress and she kept taking off appetizers and could never get it right. Dumb-ass! So we just left her $5 tip and bounced on out. She failed!

I know that this review is crazy long, but if I'm only going to give it one star, I want to explain why. 

My husband and I are in our 40's, full time RVers, and have traveled to 41 of the lower 48 states. We've literally eaten almost everywhere, and eaten all different kinds of food, at all different price points, all across the nation. Prior to the RV thing, we lived in AZ, so two of our best friends from AZ came up to join us for the weekend. My girlfriend wanted to go to Giada, but they were booked, so I checked Yelp - SINCE I TRUST YOU GUYS - to find another option. Adult Tater Tots got my husband's attention, so I made a reservation. 

My friends decided that what they really wanted was everything on the appetizer menu, so we just decided to get a bunch of those, and share everything, instead of doing real courses. Here's what we ordered:

3 Manhattans: $19.00 each
Iced Tea: $4.00
Bottle of Zin $69.00
Water: $7.00
Crab Tacos: $23.00
Wings: $21.00
Oysters Rockefeller: $21.00
Ahi Tuna Tartare: $19.00
Adult Tater Tots: $11.00
Pigs in Blankets: $17.00
Kobe Burger and Fries: $34.00
Dessert Sampler: $18.00

Plus tax = $325.38

Manhattan: One of my husbands favorite drinks, and one of the best he's ever had. I know this, because I don't actually like them, but this one was fantastic. Worth $19? I'm not really sure.

Iced Tea:  it was tea. That's it. No interesting flavors or anything, and they couldn't seem to keep it filled. I was driving, so I wasn't drinking, and I know that this is the cheapest thing on the menu, but c'mon guys, somebody had to drive.

Zinfandel: can't really tell you about this one - my friends ordered the bottle and didn't mention anything about it. I didn't taste it, because I don't care for red wine. 

Fiji Bottled Water:  we had to order this because (I don't know if you know this) Las Vegas is in the desert. Water is essential. The water glasses were about 6 ounces each, and when my husband asked if we could have a carafe at the table, we were told that they couldn't leave one. So he ordered a bottle. They couldn't keep my tea filled, and it was even worse with the water. 

FOOD: Presentation on EVERYTHING was beautiful, it all LOOKED great!

Crab Tacos: 4 to an order, and they were teeny! Approximately 2 - 2 1/2"" long each. Maybe an inch and a half high. They were tasty, but completely unseasoned. It was crab, in a crispy taco shell, with a thin slice of jalapeño and a sprig of cilantro on top of each. Served with a side of salsa, which did not seem house made, but may have been. 

Wings: Served ""lollipop style"" which means that I think that they were from the part of the wing with the two bones in it, but with only one bone and the meat pushed to the ""top"" - they looked like the ""drumstick"" ones, but tiny, once again. They were perfectly cooked, not dried out, which is impressive, considering their size. There were about a dozen, with two pieces each of celery and carrot and a side of blue cheese. They were buffalo wings, about medium spiciness. Again, nothing special. If you're looking for wings, Buffalo Wild Wings does a better, meatier job. 

Oysters:  fine, but 5 small oysters, served with one tiny bottle of Tabasco and one lemon wedge. No crackers. 

Ahi Tuna: in my opinion, the BEST THING we ate, and the most reasonable portion for the money. A bowl of cubed ahi (maybe about 3-4 ounces) atop cubed avocado, served with shrimp chips and soy sauce. 

Tater Tots:  considering that everything we ate was so small, these were ginormous by comparison! 6 to an order, and about 2-3 times the size of an average tater tot. Yes, they were flavored with Brie and bacon, but I couldn't actually see either. There wasn't enough in there. Served with ketchup on the side. No house made dipping sauce or remoulade or anything, just plain ketchup. 

Pigs in Blankets:  unfortunately, exactly what you're thinking. About a dozen Hillshire Farms tiny dogs wrapped in a small amount of puff pastry, served with French's mustard and Heinz ketchup. For $17.00. (If you're wondering what I was expecting, one of my favorite restaurants in the world is Odd Duck in Austin TX. There, they make a ""breakfast corn dog"" with house made chorizo and a Dijon mustard foam that's to die for. And I don't even like chorizo.)

After that, the boys were still hungry, so they split the Kobe burger. The meat was amazing, and cooked to perfection (I did take a bite of my husband's half) but, at $34, it just came with plain old normal fries and ketchup. Not even garlic or anything on the fries to make them interesting. 

Dessert sampler: buffet of tiny desserts. Fruit ones were good. 

My husband asked why I only gave the restaurant one star. Here's the thing: the food was fine. Everything was cooked fine. But at these prices, the food was minuscule. And there was nothing spectacular about ANY component of anything. Which was a real bummer.",5bgJkXet2inbfzqQIJrPQw,4,2,1,UIFTyTGYJNzVu8WL-eTzzg

The aforementioned hot hostess spotted our bachelor party from a mile away and the customer service began.  She sexily seduced (okay, she goaded us) into taking jager shots with her.  She had one of my boys wrapped around her little finger just by saying he's the cutest one out of us (he's so not).  Because of that, he went back to the bar and bought drinks from her TWICE throughout out meal.  Chumps you say?  Maybe.  But it was FUN.

The steak was cooked perfectly.  The two types of sauces (peppercorn and red wine) was insanely flavorful.  Adult tater tots were good.  But the highlight for me was the kobe chili that came with the chili cheese fries.  I think I must have had half of that by myself.  One guy got the sea bass and risotto dish and loved it.  Everyone else got meat and enjoyed it.

Service during dinner was prompt and polite.  Everything came together (as it should) and piping hot.  And since they are owned by the same people, our waiter brought us line passes and VIP entry cards to Jet, the club at Mirage.

I had a great prix fixe meal before the Terry Fator show and it was both nice and intimate and happening and vibrant. The wood paneling on the ceilings reminds you of the Grand Canyon, but the seating is much more comfortable.

The starter was basically a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup. Which is for me the ultimate comfort food. But I have to say it was the best grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup I ever had and I still cannot recreate the thing at home. The steak was amazing, I ordered medium and it was exactly right. And the homemade doughnut holes. I laughed about it till I tried them in the dipping sauce. It was like drinking a flan it was so good. I will never laugh at doughnut holes again. 

Best of all, the service was so fast I had no problem making my show, but it wasn't so fast that they were rushing me out. It was very obvious that they were really expert at getting people in and out for the show efficiently. And it was just enough food not to make me uncomfortable sitting in a theater for 90 minutes. 

One day when I get back to Vegas I'll have to try the full menu, considering how their ""fast food"" came out, it's got to be awesome. Great job everyone.",eqAnAeWRpd5d0PXkOlFmng,0,0,5,H3MnyskA37vgDMC3Hzc2bQ
4954158,2017-07-26,0,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Our experience at Stack was pretty good. Came in on a Saturday night with 10 of us girls for a Bachelorette weekend. We were sat at a huge round table, which was perfect so that we could all look and talk to each other, so much better than a rectangular table so thanks for that. Our server was very nice, one thing we were not a fan of were the tablets on the table to order drinks. It took away from the class of the place and made me feel a little, ""Applebees-ish."" Plus, the tablets weren't working and when we asked why, our server said things have been spotty lately. We asked if we could just order the old fashioned way, guest to server and that was cool. This place is very expensive, very expensive. You won't find an entree under 38 dollars, which I guess is expected in Vegas? I guess? I ordered a salad with seasonal vegetables and the tuna tartare. The salad was a good size and tasty and the tuna was definitely small but also, really delicious, light and super super fresh. The mango salsa it was paired with was perfect, highly recommend this dish. The two were sufficient enough for me. Other people at the table split entrees, shared an array of appetizers and some started with salads. People were happy with the quality of the food, but sheesh, those prices. We got a few adult tater tots for the table, which consisted of brie and bacon, I'm not a bacon fan so I didn't try them but the table agreed they were good. The Buffalo cauliflower was pretty delicious and others enjoyed the mac and cheese. Don't get me wrong, the quality of the food was good, but you're definitely paying the Vegas prices here and it wasn't the most amazing dinner ever you know? The manager, or the owner, not sure who exactly, but a gentleman came over to our table afterwards and thanked us for dining with them and asked how everything was, that was a nice touch. This restaurant was convenient because we were going to 1Oak immediately afterwards, however I wouldn't race back here the next time I was in Vegas, unless I win big.",OT-0VdNkBh0HOQm1apHGNw,2,3,4,no_QQUgaZR83x0_WMEkp7A

Boy was she was right.  Eating great steaks, filet mignons, lamb and some sushi as Kesha, Black Eyed Peas and other hip hop/pop music is playing, really made the place fun.

But fun only lasts so far if the food isn't good and the food here is great!!  I had the cowboy steak (great texas, fatty deep flavor), a buddy had a petit filet (a less fatty more refined and restrained flavor) and a few other guys had a Brooklyn cut, lamb shanks etc.  Great meat, cooked really dead on. 

They offer a few sauces (wine reduction and I forgot the other one), not only did I mow through the meat, it tasted so great, not one sauce touched it until the very last pieces were going to be eaten.

We had some great sides, spinach, the crunchy truffle fries, halibut sashimi, fries with cheese and a beefy chili on the side.  All very tasty and we all shared them family style. Plus their wine selection was on par and my friends who did drink put down two bottles and really enjoyed it.

The service was very attentive and although they were short staffed as a bunch of new tables came in towards the end of the meal, we totally understood as our bill was slightly delayed.

4974775,2007-09-18,4,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Grabbing a quick bite before The Danny Gans Show, a quick look at the menu brought us into STACK.  Without reservations and only part of our party ordering dinner, we were allowed to sit anywhere in the bar area.  This worked out well with a few large tables that sit about six that were available for everyone.

The BF was starving and the Prix Fixe special (5 pm to 6 pm) was looking rather appetizing.  They offered two appetizers to choose from, and he went for the Hot Rocks ($17), which is advertised as ""Thinly Sliced Sirloin, Tableside Preparation.""  The waiter comes by with a plate of hot rocks, and then another plate of about six slices of marinated sirloin.  You're then supposed to place the meat on the hot rock for a few moments to cook it.  The meat tasted so good that we barely seared it as the meat was pretty flavorful on the rear end!

Of the two entrees, he chose the 9 oz. Petite Filet Bone-Out ($40), medium rare.  It looked rather small when it arrived, which a single potato chip on top of it.  But we realized with its thickness, that it was actually a hearty piece.  It came with two sauces, both which were very tasty.

Of the two dessert choices, he went for the highly recommended Jelly Doughnut ""Munchkin"" Holes...mmmmmm jelly ($8).  It came with about four doughnut holes filled with red jelly and a vanilla bean dipping sauce.  The BF would have loved it if the vanilla bean sauce was already inside the doughnut holes!

Our friend and I decided to try drinks from their Cocktail Menu.  She went for the Impeared ($12), ""Grey Goose Poire, Fresh Pear Nectar, Muddled Pear & Sage.""  It was complimented with an Asian pear slice and was really tasty.  (She actually ordered it again, but the second one was stronger and not as sweet.)  I ordered the Bellini ($12), ""Absolut Peach, Fresh White Peach Puree & Sparkling Wine.""  Really good stuff!  It made me want to buy some of this stuff and make it at home all the time.  What a treat!  

We shared the Mixed Greens Salad ($12), ""Teardrop Tomatoes, Avocado, Shallot Vinaigrette.""  When I told the waitress we were going to share it, I was surprised to see two plates of salad to arrive.  The waitress confirmed that it was indeed one order split in two.  What  a generous portion of salad!  We were all surprised and it was quite good too!  The salad was dressed perfectly, not too little and not too much. And the avocado, tomatoes, and cucumbers all complimented it so perfectly.  (If we had each ordered our own salad, I think we wouldn't have made it to dessert then!)

For dessert, we also ordered the Mini Key Lime Pies ($8) with ""Margarita"" Sorbet.  However, our friend only saw the ""sorbet"" part and didn't even realize she ordered the pies!  It came with three miniature pies with a meringue topping that was pretty good.  The yummy sorbet sat on sweet pineapple bits that complimented the dessert perfectly!  The sweet crispy thing on top tasted great as well! 

Overall, we were pretty impressed with the food.  I have eaten at FIX over at The Bellagio, and recalled there were some memorable bites from their menu too.

Service was pretty good. The waitresses were attentive and 'stacked.'  I think they were training a new waitress, so there was an extra set of hands available.  I would definitely return to STACK again, whether it's to enjoy a couple of their cocktails, grab a quick bite, or split a dessert.

Sidenote: There's a yellow lighting issue at this restaurant, which makes everything you order look yellow.  After taking pictures of the food with a flash, then you can really see how great everything looks!

From someone who appreciated the experience, I loved it, aside from the $250 (with tip) bill that came at the end.  First, the reception stand was stocked with super cute, polite hostess types - my wife told me to keep my tongue in my mouth.  

Once seated, our waiter was nails, full of great recommendations, and very hands on.  We sat in a booth which was plenty comfortable, and sizable.  The decor is really cool, to me it felt like a large dark cave, with unique wood textured enclosure walls, really unique.  They also had a huge vaulted ceiling which made the main dining area unlike anything I've seen.

The family started with the hot rock steak, which the girls thought was very neat and delicious - and it was, BOTH.  The meat was awesome, I wish we had more, but their appetizers are designed to leave you wanting more.  We also liked the pigs in a blanket, which had a perfectly crisp and flaky blanket..  My favorite appetizer was the poke tacos, unfortunately each taco is one bite.  For entrees, we had the sea bass which was perfect, and I mean PERFECT, and the 9 oz. Petite Filet Bone-Out, also cooked to perfection at medium rare.  My girls split the most expensive hamburger ever, the Kobe Beef Burger @ $30, BUT... it was one tasty burger!  A side worth mentioning is the Baked Mac 'N Cheese, which the kids devoured.  We figured we might as well go all in, so, for dessert we had the perfect bites of jelly donuts, which was good, but not amazing, like everything else.  

As for drinks, my wife LOVED the Berrylicious martini, just make sure you like sweet things.  I enjoyed a well made, dirty martini.  Best of all, if you use Yelp to check in, you get two free shots, which we quite enjoyed, it was something strong and sweet.

If like me you frequent the Mirage, there are two perimeter choices that make more sense.  KOKOMOS is also a steak house, but with a nicer setting and ambiance.  KOKs is in the casino by the waterfalls and flora, which makes it feel 'outside' somehow, whereas STACK is one of the 'holes' in the resort's restaurant row.  So why pay through the eyeballs for steak at STACK where KOK's offers the same in a nicer spot?  Not that rolling wooden interior of STACK isn't pretty, but it could use windows above or on the sides or both to the real world.  Also, if you just want a beef fix, BLT BURGER offers burgers in a more informal open air location by the RHUMBAR and is FAR less expensive.

This all sounds so critical, and yet you plainly see five stars.  Please be patient.  Give me time to explain my partner in crime is vegetarian and we needed quick eats.  So spying the menu we saw a tomato soup, a tuna tartar, and other quick munchies.  Were they quick?  Yes, but that's because we asked for speed and we were oh so early.  Were they inexpensive or even reasonable?  Umm... no.. but let me explain.

Firstly, we ate in the bar area.  Our wait persons were lovely ladies.  They even bussed.  Think about that for a moment.  Models in those Vegas Baby short skirts... bussing the table.  Didn't expect that, right?  And they weren't sleazy party babes but classy young women.  This had an impact on the meal, since we were feeling... spoiled.

Out comes this silly tomato soup and an extra bowl.  In that bowl is a butter (homemade?) and perhaps some seasoning (?).  The soup is poured in from a tiny metal pot the size of a coffee mug,  We stir, we swirl, we taste.  Ambrosia.  Perfect temperature to work slowly on but in minutes no hesitation was needed.  

Beside these soups were two of the smallest grilled cheese fingerfood sandwiches ever.  Even the bread crust was removed.  And so you feel angry you must ration out bites between your sips of soup.  But it turns you don't have to.  The cheese is goat cheese and each bite is so rich it's like a slice of cheesecake.  Heaven. 

My tuna tartar seemed small but was so flavorfu; that it and the soup filled me.  (That's a healthy 'meal' for $30.)   My partner had a blue cheese wedge.  Not a merciless stiff chunk of iceberg but a butter lettuce bouguet anointed with cheese and nuts that was so beautiful we took a picture of it.  Really.

What we realized just between three plates it that we've missed a fabulous restaurant hiding right before our eyes for years.  I've never seen a soul in the nearby Chinese restaurant, the Ondo is a pass , Kokomos should be a Houstons, and so it's TOO EASY to ignore STACK.  Don't.

Don't ignore STACK.  We WILL return for an actual meal, even if that means eating in the dim but elegant dungeon within.  It's a romantic looking spot but I get a little claustraphobie without windows.

TWO MAJOR CRITICISMS:  this place should either be open for lunch or willing to deliver affordable eats right to the pool.  Also:  no beer on tap?  Are you kidding?  That's what falls out of the back of a bull.  Make a deal with New Belgium beers and only serve their amazing brews.  Please.",h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,1,1,5,kPFmpaoEOqRVyizYHVKOaQ

5157385,2012-10-25,0,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"As with most reviews for this place, we ate prior to Beatles Love Cirque Du Soleil.  Not to start off as a sexist creep, but the skimpy skirts the waitresses had on were the reason I gave them 3 stars in lieu of 2.  Wow.  

We had 7:00 reservations and arrived early to grab a drink at the bar.  Very cool bar area with plenty of casual seating in an upscale restaurant.  Prior to grabbing a drink at the bar, we checked in with the hostess to let her know we had arrived.  Despite reservations at 7:00, we weren't seated until a little after 7:30.  This reminded me of a Seinfeld episode ... they had no problem ""taking"" the reservation ... they just couldn't ""hold"" the reservation ... and that's the most important part!

We were seated in the way back in a more private (and roomy) area, which was nice.  The server introduced himself and said he and another gentleman would be taking care of us.  What we didn't know was that ""taking care"" had a different meaning to them, I suppose.  We had terrible/slow service the entire night and at one point EVERY single glass at the table needed a refill (no exageration).  There were only 6 of us, but apparently the table of 10 next to us (and seated 10 minutes after we put in our order) had no problem getting their food before us.

As for the food ... it was phenomenal.  This is where they made up for crummy service.  As a table, we had the big seafood tower appetizer, which was fantastic.  I had a bone-in ribeye that was cooked to perfection along with a twice-baked potato.  The place was pricey, but we knew that having looked at the menu ahead of time, so no big deal.  Our table of 6 probably spent somewhere in the $600 range.  Too bad for Stack they seated us 35 minutes late or else we would have had dessert, coffee, and after-dinner drinks as well (probably another $150).  Instead, we had to book it to Beatles Love.

So ... the Quick and Dirty review:

Atmosphere - Great (scantily clad waitresses, dimly lit restaurant, good music)
Service - Poor (wasted reservation, lack of attention)
Food - Fantastic (seafood tower, steak, and twice-baked potato were all delicioso)

Once we checked in with the hostesses - they were rude and unwelcoming. Even after having a reservation, we were told that the wait would be 30 minutes. Having a reservation for over a month at this spot, our table should be ready when we check in. Typically 30 minutes isn't a long time and I would bite my tongue and just wait, but we had 10 girls and plans immediately after. One of my girlfriends went up to the hostesses about 15 minutes after we were told to wait (I have no idea what she said, but we were seated very quickly after that) 

My friend made a reservation they gave us the option of having a prefix menu because it's easier for a large group. We didn't want the prefix menu so we chose to order what we wanted at a $40 minimum. She even had to sign a ridiculous contract in order to set this reservation. Once we were seated, the waiter gave us the prefix menu and we told him that we had prior reservations for ordering anything on the menu but having a $40 minimum per person. The waiter was EXTREMELY rude and pretty much didn't want to serve us (probably because the prefix menu is an easy tip for him - lazy)

BESIDES the fact that their entire staff is incompetent and lazy, the food was actually pretty good. 

-Me and my friend decided to split the seafood tower (the middle tier that was 80$) and it came with 2 lobster tails, 4 huge shrimps, 3 pieces of crab leg, and 8 oysters. 
-The tater tots were really good as well although I don't think I would ever spend $11 bucks on these again. I mean... they're tater tots. 
-I tried a piece of my friends Tomahawk bone in rib eye and THAT WAS AMAZING. It was huge too. I wish I would have ordered this

The drinks were average. The bartender made us ""special shots"" (that probably had spit in them) but they were called ""white gummy bears."" (it's pretty much raspberry vodka with peach schnapps and sprite) nothing special or amazing. 

The two stars is for the food. Everything else gets zero stars - sorry stack - you shouldn't have customers jump through ridiculous hoops to make a reservation.",mk0ilbFN33Hz0b2fWHqsqw,3,2,2,c48qL76A7LkADw4rG2CIBg

Appetizers:

Hot Rock: Thinly sliced layers of beef that you cook on a 600 degree rock. We actually ordered a second round, because the beef literally melts in your mouth. The rock also adds an element of danger, which we found quite exciting.

Yellowtail Crunch: I'm not a raw fish person at all, and I loved this. 

Rock Shrimp: Not my favorite dish of the night, but the thai chili sauce was fantastic.

Dinner:

Garbage Salad: For my gluten free friend, we ordered the garbage salad. You could tell a lot of love went into this salad. Everything was chopped up and mixed to perfection. I was eyeing the hearts of palm and blue cheese crumbles.

2 lb Maine Lobster: Yes, this was definitely my order. This could have been my last meal on earth and I would have been happy. The lobster was stuffed with a ritz cracker stuffing and had fresh drawn butter. I might even cry just remembering that part of the meal.

Side Dishes:

Adult Tator Tats: The cutest presentation. It came on one of those petite cast iron dishes with a mason type jar of ketchup. The tots were filled with bacon and brie. Amazing.

Whipped Potatoes & Baked Mac & Cheese: The Mac and Cheese won this round. I would go back to Stack just for the Mac & Cheese. It had smoked ham, peas, and a crunchy topping. Adult junk food at its finest.

Dessert:

We were so full at this point, but I refused to leave without trying something, so we settled on the Banana Cream Pies with malted chocolate ice cream. Everything tasted homemade, and it rivaled even my favorite banana pudding at Magnolia's in New York. I wish we could have tried the jelly doughnuts or molten chocolate cake, but that gives us a good reason to go back.",7Ie3f_4upzsMNAY07d19kA,5,4,5,U6ZTGRniqAmyX31WgvnTKQ

After our trade show, we were hungry and thirsty. The cocktail menu comes in an iPad, which is okay, but takes some time to swipe right left, up and down.  Please bring back print menus! 

The cocktails were not too strong and were made perfectly.  Our bartenders (Justin if I recall), were great and very attentive.  

We got a dozen Kushi oysters ($4 each) and most were clean and was quite tasty.  The star of the appetizers was the hot rocks.  The beef is cut sashimi style and you lay it on the hot rock for 2-3 seconds each side and it is done.  Was it worth $22?  It sure was fun. 

I've stayed at Mirage many times and this was the first time here.  Mirage has many sit down restaurants (been to Pantry, Carnegie Deli, BLT Burger, Heritage Stack, and their buffet).

Our side dishes were good but our Tomahawk Rib-Eye looked like it was sliced with a butter knife.  Asked for medium rare and it was pretty damn rare.

Their menu has something for everyone, even those with dietary restrictions. I told the waiter that I needed gluten & dairy free options and he actually took the time to go thru the menu and point out everything that naturally fit my requirements or could be adjusted to.  He even went through all the sauces I needed to avoid and which menu items they came on. For someone who has had 5 star restaurants and resorts say they couldn't accommodate my diet this was spectacular!

The manager Doug was amazing, we were sat right away despite being 15min late for our reservation (girls will be girls after all).  He stopped by the table several times to ensure our service and food met our expectations.  He even brought over a very nice bottle of champagne (not sparkling wine) for the birthday girl.

This was, without question, one of the best dining experiences I have had in Vegas.  As locals we tend to expect poor service, even in the best restaurants, and Stack set a new bar for me.  I could not have asked for a better way to celebrate my friend's birthday.

As an aside: We had a waiter (who was not ours) come to our rescue when a very intoxicated man came over to our table as we were enjoying the last of our champagne and tried to pick up my friend.  I wish I had gotten his name to extend a personal thank you for preserving our girls night!

STACK's solution to that challenge is to hire the most beautiful hostesses and bartenders in the city (really, these young women are gorgeous) and then not train for a single hour in their jobs. Me and my friend went here for a late-ish dinner after seeing LOVE at the Mirage on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was far from full. It has a very modern, minimalist, dimly lighted decor reminiscent of several of Vegas's new line of ""chic"" steak joins such as BOA and N9NE. The problem was that it took the hostesses almost 20 minutes to find us a table, a problem that was compounded when they didn't know how to transfer our drinks from the bar to the restaurant bill. Also the drinks here are overpriced, even by Vegas standards ($18-19 each) and the bartenders, albeit friendly and pretty, are far from noted mixologists. My friend's martini was made so sweet that it was undrinkable while mine was just flat and supremely forgettable. The best part of the menu are the appetizers; the Pigs in a Blanket are a fun dish not often found in similar venues and I enjoyed the adult tater odds. Me and my friend split the Chateubrand steak for 2 with whipped potatoes on the side and thought that it was a nice cut of meat but not in the same class as Delmenico's, PRIME, CUT, or the dearly departed Nero's. Yet you will be well fed and probably too full to try out desert. The restaurant seems to have a prix-fixe that goes for around 50-60 which I've heard good things about but the restaurant does a bad job advertising it.

 Finally, STACK wins the award for most unnecessary bathroom attendant on the Strip. A bathroom as clausterophic and cramped as STACK's is no place for a man in a tux to stand behind the door (and essentially sneak up on you when you try to wash your hands).",IOf-UvT_gfpP1c7s3HYx3Q,0,0,3,BxAFtA45XlZcuBYFlJzXyg

I couldn't even call another restaurant because the noise level FROM THE MUSIC (not from the other diners having a great time, not from the energy of a great fun restaurant) forced me to go into a loud, busy, noisy CASINO to make my call.

This is a restaurant where dinner, wine, drinks would probably cost (had we stayed) no less than $100 a person.  We've got the money, we're not old farts (ok, we're 58 and 60, but we generally eat our dinner late and enjoy fine food, fine wine and terrifically fun restaurants, lol).

These were a tad spicier than they had to be. I like hot spicy wings as much as the next guy, but these seemed to go a little over the top to the point where they weren't that flavorful. They did come off the bone nicely though. Just be aware that these are more than medium hotness. My wife had the Brooklyn Filet (basically a bone-in filet mignon) which she thought was very tasty and cooked to her liking (she's not usually easy to please with steaks). I had the seabass on the lobster risotto, which was done well and tasty. It combines three of my favorite things. We also had the ""Adult Tater Tots"" which have a bacon flavor and have some brie inside. Maybe its just me, but the taste didn't quite add up to how good it sounded (or maybe the hot wings had killed my sense of taste by that point). Overall I would recommend it.

-garbage salad (yummy)
-split a Brooklyn filet - so delicious, no need for salt, pepper or the two great sauces it comes with. Steak was perfectly cooked, and the filet...oMG, so tender. Can cook a better steak than craftsteak, and craftsteak is good, when they cook the meat right.
-Mac and cheese (DEE-licious. Lots of flavor and nice visible pieces of bacon and peas). most mac and cheese in restaurants are bland. that is not an issue here.

the only downside: the popovers. I read on Yelp to ask for them, because they don't automatically give them to you. So we asked for them, and the mgr (?) said sure - it's not something that they bring out normally, but there's no charge. Well they look good, but boy, I could have used them as doorstops. Ours were extremely over baked, dry and hard. We picked them apart and only ate the insides and left a crusty massacre in the basket; they probably thought, why did they ask for it if they weren't going to eat it ? Oh well that's okay, we had enough in our stomachs anyway. If they fix this popover situation, then all would be perfect.

What we ordered:
Mini lamb gyros: So good! The appetizer came with three small gyros (we had a group of three so it worked out perfectly). Hands down the best gyro I've ever had. My only complaint would be portion size. For $19, you'd think you'd be getting more.

Seabass: Delicious! Came with a lobster risotto with actual chunks of lobster. I did have one problem with the seabass: it was a tad undercooked so I had the chef throw it back on the grill. They re-plated my dish and threw in extra lobster. Minus the mishap, the dish was great. 

Country Potato Gratin: My friends and I split this. I'd say it was pretty standard but still yummy.

Warm Chocolate Cake: Good! Not particularly memorable but we enjoyed it.

My friends ordered the Petite Filet and the Pan Roasted Chicken. They both loved their dishes especially my friend who ordered the steak. We also ordered a bottle of white wine.

Started out with Seafood Stack, small portions, but great quality for the oysters and shrimp, lobster was lacking.  King Crab was the highlight of the Stack.

My wife opted for the ""Hot Rock thinly sliced sirloin"" as the entree as she wasn't too hungry.  She asked the waiter and said the portion was 4 ounces, but apparently he wasn't informed properly or had no sense of volume/weight.  The portion was 4 paper thin slices of beef and the total weight was MAYBE one once.  But nicely presented.

Other entrees ordered were the ""Scallops with saffron grits / crispy pancetta / green onion oil, and the ""Seabass lobster risotto / shellfish broth"".  Both were excellent!  Four scallops were served on over a minimal smear of saffron grits.  Two of us had the scallops, one dish was served with the scallops perfectly seared, while the scallops on the second dish lacked the proper sear.  Seabass was perfect through out, and the risotto was a perfect match.

I chewed up the sugar cane and spit it out, the pineapple I saved for later, perhaps for dessert, I said.

We started off with the Hot Rocks - They brought out a hot rock  and 6 thin pieces of sirloin we grilled on the rock for about 3 sec. each side. delicious for 21.00.

I had the 14oz Brooklyn filet with whipped, not mashed, potatoes. Filet cooked to a medium. Which in retrospect I'll get medium rare next time. Not that this wasn't good medium. It was great!  Juicy and tender. On the bone no less. Which just adds to the flavor!!!  Served with a red wine reduction and peppercorn barenaise sauce. This truly enhanced the flavor. Didn't take away or overpower the meat. The whipped potatoes you ask?  Truly wonderful. I asked my girl to make these next time we have steak and potatoes. She said yes. Of course she did. She loved them as much as I did. 

After all this we were spent. Then Manny brought out our Birthday desserts. Vanilla ice cream with ""happy birthday "" written in chocolate. Truly a simple but heartfelt gesture on the part of the Stack staff. Meant so much to us. 

All in all. Go!  Go and enjoy Stack. The staff wonderful. The food to die for!!!


Update:  Again, this place does not disappoint. Came here tonight after watching Beatles Love. We were looking forward to the Stack experience. 

Guess who our waiter was...once again, the awesome Manny. Such a pleasure to have him again! Service from this gentleman should be taught!!! He was attentive and did not leave us disappointed. 

We started with the sashimi with serrano peppers. So light and flavorful. Along with the kale salad made for a great opener. This time around my girl had the scallops and I had the sea bass with risotto. We ate half and switched plates. What can I say?  The scallops were perfectly cooked on a bed of grits. My sea bass was just as delicious as the last time. 

Carlos, the GM, came by the table to check on us and we had nothing but praise to give him for the food and the service.

The atmosphere was great, a neat place with an intricate design of woods and mood lighting make up the walls and ceiling. Very beautiful. Menu was good, good selection. Drink menu was via an iPad app. I have an iPad and love Apple but I just think this is stupid. Just give me a regular menu. The drinks were very good looking, but SUPER pricey. Specialty cocktails were around $18-$20. Mojito was $19... What a joke. Wine by the glass was $20 and up. I mean seriously, does it need to be that much? We had two beers, both were $8, still expensive but we got two drinks for under $20 (what a bargain). 

We shared the kale salad, bacon and brie tater tots and ahi tartare. First off, the kale salad didn't list red onions as an ingredient and it came with them all over. Had to send it back. Once fixed, the salad was super salty but pretty tasty and very filling. Bacon and brie tater tots were good as well, but expensive for what small amount you got. The Ahi Tartare... Oh I wish this was better. It was served marinated, cut chunk style in a bowl on top of avocado. On the side were what they called shrimp chips. Like round puffed air scoops that smelled and tasted fishy. The ahi was fishy. I order this dish all the time everywhere- including the Cheesecake Factory (where its excellent) and here it was terrible. From the amount, to the texture, to the taste, just awful. 

Im sure if we ordered the $170 surf and turf (lobster and steak) we would have loved it. We spent near $80 and it was sick. I felt like this was just a status restaurant, take someone here to impress them with the prices. Go elsewhere to eat tasty food that might not set your mortgage to shame.",5pzlMJge-09eygoVJrks_A,2,1,2,ScEVim_CqPPE0u17Iz_yYw

So much, that I can't really recommend going back there to any of my friends.  There is nothing that really differentiates it from all of the other restaurants on the strip.  After each of my meals, I left thinking, ehh, this is it.  Where is the flavor and the quality of food?  We didn't order any of the steak (so take it with a grain of salt if thats what you are looking for).

What we ordered:
BLT salad
Sesame chicken lettuce cups
Seabass
Lamb shank
Tater tots


Pros:
I was attracted to this restaurant in what appeared to be an innovative menu.  The creativity that is shown really excited me about the potential food I was going to get.

Cons:
The food isn't bad.  It is food, and I did eat it.  However, its not anything to write home.  I really wanted it to taste better.  I had spent well over 3 hours researching restaurants, locations, and menus and I wanted this to work.  I guess I had too high of expectations for this to live up to.  Unfortunately, I won't be coming back and I won't be recommending it to anyone else that visits.  It left me wanting more for what I paid and in a place like Vegas, there are so many other things I could be doing or enjoying that this isn't going to cut it.",lBrqz3tvS2SU7al1sagZBw,0,0,2,yQmP_tsXu7nqyxubbq61og

I wanted to give them a shout out this time because they always give exceptional service, their food is fantastic, and the entire experience is well worth the bill in my opinion, unlike some other restaurants. 

This time we had: 
- oysters (west coast): I love that they don't just serve the standard cocktail sauce and lemon but also give you a vinegar topping option 
- buffalo wings (like lollipops): the sauce was fantastic and the meat literally falls off of the bone 
- Wedge Salad: fantastic and love that they gave us the option to split it in half between two people 
- Wagyu Burger: presentation fantastic and my step-son said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had 
- NY Strip Topped with Tempura Green Beans: cooked perfectly with an amazing peppercorn sauce on the side 
- Scallops: one word... delicious
- 8oz. Filet: this was my meal and I have to admit I am a steak snob. I'm extremely picky about how it is cooked. The Medium Plus temperature I requested was flawless. I don't like sauce on my steak so I asked for peppercorn rub and it was perfect. The mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms were a perfect compliment. 
- we also had the Justin Cabernet and Brussel Sprouts which were phenomenal. 
- we finished with two red velvet lava cakes and a creme brûlée and they were a fantastic finish to the evening. 

Outside of our food, the thing that made the meal even more perfect was our exceptional service. The manager (who I didn't get his name was great and checked in to make sure everything was going well)... but our staff of three people: Scott H., Vince D., and Taylor were on top of it.

I was born and raised in San Diego, CA so it's nearly impossible to impress me with seafood since it was a weekly meal in my home. But when I say that the stuffed lobster was by far the most amazing thing I've ever eaten, I mean it. I had a sea bass that would put anything in San Diego to shame.

5685199,2013-02-03,1,3Gt3xskppi9jZuTrwrhLNg,"Net: we only came in for drinks and a few light bites before heading to Love. We ordered enough food (three apps) to get a sense of this portion of the menu but can't speak for the full dinner experience.

There are five of us here in Vegas for the weekend - two couples and an exchange student (high school). We had tickets for Love and needed a place to grab a quick bite before the show. We had dinner reservations elsewhere after the show. We jut needed a quick something to tide us over.

When we arrived the first thing we noticed was that the hostess was kind of a bitch. Despite that fact we stuck around since it was close to the theater. It's also a beautiful space. We ordered drinks (a diet with lemon, glass of wine and two extra dirty martinis, straight up, with blue cheese stuffed olives) and three apps (yellowtail sashimi, hot rocks, pigs in blankets*). The drinks took a while to arrive but the martinis were well-worth the wait. Wow. With the extra time it took to bring the drinks one would think the lemon would have arrived with them but no such luck. The waitress remembered when handing them out and said, ""lemon"" but still had to be reminded when the food came. Eh.

The sashimi brought in decent reviews from the fish eaters in our crowd. The presentation was beautiful but the portion was a little small - perfect for two or three, though. Keep that in mind if going in for snacks. The hot rocks are pure kitsch but seriously lack flavor. This may be because we got it gluten free so it was missing soy sauce but even so, steakums on a rock? Eh. The aforementioned, difficult to pluralize pigs in blankets were really good.

Service was spotty, all the waitresses look exactly the same and if the attitude is part of the vibe Stack is going for they should reconsider. I don't need my waitress to be my friend but she should smile once in a while and check in. For a quick bite it'll do but my next trip to the Mirage will include trying another place.

Like FIX, the menu concentrates on trendy or inventive variations of standard American fare. A specialty is Hot Rocks: thinly sliced raw sirloin, cooked table side on a hot rock. You can also get Kobe chili cheese dogs, or a more traditional steak or lobster.

The atmosphere? It's noisy, dark, with candles and spot lights on tables, plus a few accent lights. Servers were dressed a little more conservatively than at FIX. Otherwise, they were similar: young, all in black.

I had a Kobe burger, which comes with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and an onion ring, all on a bun. Tall is the theme at this place. It was decent. Fries are served on the side. I also tried the adult tater tots, which include mild brie and bacon flavors. Also decent.

Based on one meal, I'd say you shouldn't come here for the food, but if you're here already, the food is better than you might expect at a trendy bar. It isn't as good as FIX, but it also isn't as expensive.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,1,1,3,OeH5zuqIFPYwi4xg77RGKA

Five Stars:  
- Service.  Manny & Scott were awesome and the hotties that were running food were so polite and very knowledgeable on the items they were serving.  We really liked the ""team"" structure to the service and were impressed at how hard they were working even considering we had already prepaid the tip when we bought our NYE ""tickets"".
- Food.  The crudo was amaze - get it!  My friend got the hot rocks - she liked that it was fun to cook and such but we hated that it made us smell like meat and she said it wasn't amazing.  The lobster and the filet were both delicious and perfectly cooked and both of the salads were yummy.
- Ambiance.  The restaurant has a great vibe and we loved the rock music, even if it was a bit loud in there.  If you're going for a super romantic date night, it may not be your scene.

Two Stars:
- Wine.  There are only ~5 options for red wine by the glass - and the cab was $30/glass.  I mean, that's ridiculous.  Have a normal $15/glass red wine like every other Vegas restaurant, please.
- Dessert.  We tried the red velvet molten lava cake (there was no lava whatsoever, and the crème brulee (which tasted more like lumpy pudding with a burned sugar crust) had berries on top that were soaked in something yummy, but the rest just wasn't very good.  Just use your calories on an extra appetizer!

We come to Vegas often, and this place was good enough to make another visit - especially to try the full menu, but please get some additional wine choices!",7AizfeB5uZ0Uxs5U9R5u7w,0,0,4,zEBWTPiXVKce9K9mqxEJVA

We only chose Stack because it was in the Mirage, right by the show.  It ended up being a fortuitous spur-of-the-moment decision.  We loved our dining experience!

The ambience is exactly what you would expect from a Vegas steakhouse, trendy and metropolitan.  The low lighting and modern decor were very nice.

Our table ordered a few appetizers to start.  We split the Rock Shrimp with chili sauce, Ahi Tuna Tartare with crisps and ""Adult Tater Tots"" (made with Brie and bacon).  The Ahi Tuna Tartare was definitely my favorite.  The ""Adult Tater Tots"" were good, but they just tasted like regular tater tots to me.  I couldn't really taste the Brie or bacon.

For our entree, my sister and I split the Stuffed Lobster with a side of Potatoes Au Gratin.  Oh. My. Goodness.  It was AMAZING!  The stuffed lobster was so flavorful and buttery.  The lobster was stuffed with a Ritz Cracker & King Crab stuffing.  It was phenomenal!  The side of potatoes was also delicious and perfectly crispy on top!  Everyone in our family loved their food!  I heard a lot of positive comments about the Bone-In Ribeye as well.

I haven't done an itemized pro/con review in while so here we go...

Pros:
Excellent portions of my surf & turf or lobster & filet
Well prepared medium rare steak
Lobster was perfect and I am not a lobster fan
Very good serving staff pair
Well made drinks...martinis and chocolate cakes
Dark, intimate decor (clean-sporty executive clubhouse like)

Cons:
Intimate but noisy.  (I don't like to have to shout over dinner and I want to hear the specials the first time my server fires off with them)*
One cocktail server in the bar/waiting area?  Ridiculous. (I literally batted my eyelashes at a girl I guessed was a cocktail server)
Neither of our servers suggested wines with our steak or lamb
Didn't like where we were seated next to the server's station of clanking silverware and drawers....this added to the noise.

If I ever come here again, I would probably just want to stick to the bar area where the full menu is served.  

This is definitely good for groups.  For a date, not so much unless you text one another your conversation.

Even though the decor is very far from the typical pub with nice wood panels (stacks of wood, hence the name), menu is deliberately dominated by pub-like items like buffalo wings, onion rings and pigs in a blanket. Sharing is encouraged. They also offer steaks and other hearty main courses.

They have an original appetizer called Hot Rock which is a carpaccio style piece of seasoned and oiled beef which the patron cooks on err... an hot rock. Great taste and original. However, the chef should really reconsider the practice of serving Heinz ketchup and yellow mustard to go along the finger food. At least home made laternatives should be proposed.

When we were seated, it took the server a bit of time to greet us. When she approached the table, she seemed a lilttle overwhelmed. There was a quick introduction of herself and her partner. We ordered drinks and they took a while to get to us - our friends weren't drinking and only got soda and that seemed to take a while as well. Once we ordered our apps and meals, we didn't see the server for a while. We wanted another round of drinks, but since we never saw her, we weren't able to order a second round. She didn't even deliver our entrees, it was her partner along which another gentlemen. When my boyfriend received his steak, he commented on how large it was. Her partner (I wish I remembered his name) stated people usually don't expect it to be as big as it is. A few minutes later, the server approached the tabled and asked my boyfriend if he wanted the steak for a single or 2 people. Before he could answer, she stated she forgot to ask. I found this a bit odd. My boyfriend said he ordered the dry-rubbed steak and she immediately knew it was for a single, but it wasn't what she entered as the order. She simply shrugged her shoulders and walked away. 

When we received our check, we were charged for the steak for 2.  My boyfriend didn't want to make a big deal about it, so he went ahead and just paid the bill.  As her partner came to run our card, my friend was going to say something, but ended up stopping mid-sentence. Her partner, noticed there was some awkwardness and stated he knew what we were debating about and said he would fix it. He clearly read our cues and responded quickly. He ended up bringing the check back without charging us for my boyfriends steak on it and apologized for the inconvenience and mistake that took place. We thought it was a bit much, but he insisted. We were floored by his customer service for a mistake he didn't cause. As I was signing the check, the female server came back and said she was going to fix the check. When I stated her partner had already taken the initiative to fix the check, she stated that he didn't know what he was doing  and didn't know what was going on. She removed the check presenter and went back to charge us for the steak. Basically - threw her partner under the bus. 

Let me make it clear, we didn't care to have to pay for the steak, but the customer service aspect of this server was frustrating. Her partner was wonderful, but she just seemed to busy and overwhelmed the hostess should have probably stopped seating her. We still tipped 20%, but only to ensure her partner would get his fair cut. After the initial mistake, she never once apologized nor seemed to care that she made a mistake and failed to provide great service.",kZfBKDZv2IZ2LODVS9Kuew,0,0,3,Eh3FAOHlGwWAG0qqtGwWSQ

The skinny: Menu is very limited, food is overpriced, service is bad....the only positive thing about this restaurant is that it's pretty. And there's a DJ?


The food:
Shared the Hot Rocks, which sounded and looked way cooler than the dish ended up being. It's like trying to be a cool version of KBBQ, where you cook your own sliver of beef on a lava rock? But the beef was mediocre at best, and for $21 it was not worth it. 

They try to sell this place as a steak house... but that pic you see up at the top of the page with the steak and melted butter + asparagus? LIES. The petit filet was dry, and when it came out the butter was definitely still cold and not half melted. 
($49)

I ordered the ""Stack"" burger - which was overall a good burger. Nice thick patty (Kobe beef, which made it nice and juicy) and bibb lettuce and tomatoes etc were all fresh. I ordered it medium, and it was pink in the middle. BUT it came with the WORST seasoned fries I've ever tried. I don't think I've ever come across a french fry I didn't like, until now :(  How do you screw up french fries? They were hard, cold, but yet spicy. Oh, and it came with a ""dipping sauce""...aka ketchup  -___-;; 
($34)

My friend ordered the Salmon, which came with this crispy fried waif of a rice cracker, which was just really really bland. And the spinach was probably the healthiest spinach I've ever tried....straight up just boiled. 
($38)

Overall, the for what it cost, the food was grossly disappointing. Also, very limited vegetarian options. 

The Service: 
I hate to rag on wait staff, I do. And I get that it was a busy Fri night. But this place was like ""amateur hour"". Our waiter was a little rude, did not know anything about the menu, never refilled my soda, and it took close to 1.5 hours to finally get our food (reservation at 8:30, we did not get our food until after 10pm).
