111380,2017-06-06,0,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,Umami is a must try sushi spot. They're food was amazing and customer service was over the top. My wife and I sat at the bar and the sushi chef was constantly checking if we needed something. My wife also wanted something spicy but she couldn't decide what and the chef suggested the poke salad and said he could make it spicy and it was phenomenal. Definitely a must go to restaurant and we will be going back many more times.,0yAO5zlg11jnERm_yPM9Wg,1,0,5,OjcK133sbk8fGQONFt9kuA

171554,2017-01-21,1,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"The best Sushi ever!   I have had Sushi almost everywhere except Japan and this is the best Sushi that I have ever had.  The décor is fabulous, the service is exceptional, the presentation is amazing and the Sushi is heavenly!   

If you like baked rolls you will quickly discover that every baked roll you have ever had in your past was wrong and these baked rolls are just right right right.  If you like Japanese Lasagna order the Vegas roll instead... this is a detour in the right direction!  The Full Moon proves that not every roll has to be heavy to have incredible flavor.  

Have I mentioned the Pink Lady yet???  OMG!  Refreshing, sassy & delicious!!  Garlic Tuna??? ooooohhhhh ya!

Make sure Tracy is your server, order the Jalapeno Bomb appetizer (not too spicy) and be prepared to lick the plate while you wait for the Chef to amaze you!

And the Sake.......  oh mann!!!!!

925880,2017-03-06,0,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"UPDATE December 2017:
This sushi place used to be our go to place (see previous 5 star review below). However, it was recently (around October 2017) taken over by new management. The prices are more afordable and you can expect to receive slightly more meat per order. However, the two things that really set the old Umami apart for me was the quality of the fish (and other food) and great service. Both have gone down noticably under new management (therefore the new 2 star review). For this reason I will be finding a new sushi place to frequent.

OLD REVIEW February 2017: If you are looking for a sushi place in the Centennial Hills area this is the place to go, without question. This place takes the spot as one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas. Every fish that we tasted was incredibly FRESH including the salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and the snapper. Both times that we went here we chose to sit at the sushi bar. Where we enjoyed our very quick one on one service from sushi chef Kim. Kim made various recommendations and came off as very knowledgeable. After our main meal; we chose to try the mochi and macaroons which were great as well! Each of the two times we've been here it was a great date experience in a restaurant with a great atmosphere. You won't find an all you can eat option here, but the food is well priced and after you have tasted the quality of their fish you will understand why they are not giving it away through all you can eat specials.",0OZ9NT-P4Un49Y8bhe946w,0,0,2,BuSxx4roOljgr0hK5-blZQ

1049978,2017-01-21,2,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"Completely blew my expectations! I drove 45 mins from Henderson to try this place and it was worth the drive!

ATMOSPHERE: The decor of this place was actually really nice. They have large TVs which would be fun on game nights. The waiter was a little quiet, but she was really nice. I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar because the sushi chef were very interactive and nice. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS RESTAURANT!

FOOD: The pricing of the food was absolutely perfect for this sushi restaurant, I hope that never changes. They offer different combos that are delicious, filling, and easy on your wallet. The Unagi Don is a large bowl of rice with fresh water eel and eel sauce, it comes with miso soup and a choice of cucumber salad or green salad. The Unagi Don was absolutely delicious, my favorite restaurant that makes it in Vegas. Their Sushi & Sashimi Combo comes with chef selected nigiri and sashimi, in addition you get to choose between a California Roll, Spicy Tuna9 Roll, Salmon and Avocado Roll, or Vegetable Roll. You can also order sushi individually here. The Ami Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) Nigiri is not only beautiful, but made to perfection. They have a smaller specialty rolls menu, but they all look amazing.

DESSERT: They have a more unique dessert menu compared to other restaurants. For cakes, they have a delicious Champagne Cake or a Cheesecake. I was surprised that they have Macarons here in various flavors such as chocolate, passion fruit, and pistachio. As a Japanese restaurant, it's only fitting that they have Mochi Ice Cream in most flavors. Additionally, they have Affogato which is vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso.

DRINK: They have a full sake menu. Their hot tea comes in a cute teapot. They have the basic fountain drinks.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,13,7,5,nfWSYezNTeDNEkWc569Adg

We ordered tako wasabi and screaming O appetizers.  The tako wasabi was a very good sized portion of blissful fresh octopus marinated in wasabi and a little chilli.  Very tasty.  The screaming O didn't get made until we had a couple other rolls.  While the tuna was fresh and tasty, the sauce was like watery soup.  

We also had a Carson roll, a No Name roll, Number 5 roll and a Red Bull.  All the rolls were very nicely made and generally very tasty except for the No Name Roll.  That particular roll was so mild tasting I really did not know what I was eating.  Also the No Name is made like Futumaki, five large pieces.

Service was top notch.  Everyone checked on us numerous times and the chef was friendly and fast.

To my surprise, they are linked to Sakana and Neko, which were both good choices for ayce sushi. We did go during the ending of their lunch menu and it was't crowded at all. I am sure the foot traffic picks up during dinner as well. We got a booth and it was very spacious and comfortable.

The one major standout here was the service. Excellent customer service sets Umami far apart from establishments like Goemon who have gone downhill due to their lack of service. Our waters were filled often, orders were taken and brought to us in a timely manner, our table and plates were cleaned so often that i felt bad for making them have to stop by our table so often.

The fish was fresh on every different nigiri order as well as their rolls and appetizers. Our server even brought my 5 year old a chopstick holder so she could use her chopsticks instead of a fork.

I know it's hard to be competitive up by where I live and yes some sushi was just okay, but they have a variety of rolls and I just asked the chef to recommend something.

He made me a ""Dont Cry Amigo"" Spicy Hamachi roll and it was just fine and tasty with a kick!

The tempura was nice and light I had two orders... why not it's all you can eat.

For being close to home and the price this place is fine.. but if you're in a super picky foodie night maybe pass.

Darin was our server who made sure service was top-notch. We started with the king crab and lobster ngiri, which were that day's specials. Both were delicious and generous; the lobster especially tasted like FRESH lobster, not an overbrined version that some places serve. Then we were going to have separate lunch special bowls of ramen, but because we already had sushi and were getting another roll plus pickled cukes, Darin mentioned that the ramen bowl was very large and filling and asked if we wanted to split it. Good thing we followed his lead because we would have wasted so much--instead, it was a perfect serving of umami miso ramen for each.

BFF received a beautiful complimentary tempura ice cream cake dessert served topped off with a birthday candle!  I felt prices were reasonable for the selections and quality, as our lunch bill was only $35, not including tip.

1935640,2017-02-22,1,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"Very disappointed with this place, especially seeing yelpers have given this place on an average 4.5 stars. 

A 4.5 star restaurant should have excellent ambiance, excellent food, excellent service. This Umami place has none of the above.

First the ambiance, it is quite mod but cold. Seats are not comfortable and has many TV's. Is this really a Japanese restaurant or just a sports bar serving Japanese food??

Service is horrible not because the servers tried to ignore us, rather, they need to be trained:
1. There were empty tables along the wall and the aisle, instead, the seater took us to a table right in the middle of the room with empty tables all around us. Strange.
2. Three servers came to us to take drink orders and desert orders seems to be totally un-organized. 
3. We ordered some sushi rolls. We have to ask for Wasabi and ginger which were not accompanied with the rolls. We should not have to ask for them -- it is a must condiment with sushi. 
4. We asked for low sodium soy sauce. The waitress said there should be one in the kitchen but then she came back and said all the soy sauce they use are of the low sodium variety. 
5. Server did not seem to know the menu well -- has to go and ask the chef/manager constantly. Annoying.
Although all the servers were friendly and courteous, there is a lot of training to be done.

Now come to the food:
A good Japanese restaurant must have good sushi rice as well as regular rice ( that come with the entrees ). This restaurant's rice is obnoxiously bad -- when sushi rice is hard and under-cooked, you just won't have good sushi. 
We also ordered the BBQ short ribs. Way too much Korean BBQ sauce on those ribs. 

Pricing on the food items is disproportionate. Classic rolls are only $6 each. But specialty rolls are about $15 each or more. Why such difference. 

Based on the sushi rice, this place is not worth any thing more than a 1.5 star, but since there is no half star category,  we  give this place a 2 star which is being very kind.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,2,0,2,zgiIF84J43JJRfuabneCLg

The first time we ate here the owner gave us a complimentary bottle of sparkling peach saki which was amazing. The service is perfect and everyone is beyond friendly. This time we ordered a la carte for my daughter and the owner offered for her to eat free off our all you can eat. Granted she doesn't eat much but that's awesome customer service and something you never see at a sushi spot. The chef sent over a bear made out of a orange for my daughter which put a huge smile on all our faces. How can you beat that! Let me comment on the sushi real quick. The best way to put it is it's the exact opposite of what your use to. What I mean is we are use to getting large portions of rice and smaller portions of fish. At Umami it's the exact opposite. Huge portions of fish on small portions of rice. It's dang near nigiri lol. My wife and I had our first date a sushi tachi on centennial and Aliante and that has been our sushi spot for 9 Years.

However, the sushi was worth the wait. It was delicious, fresh, and reasonably priced. I ordered a Spicy Tuna, Tamago, and an Alaskan Roll.

Ordering food and receiving our second and third orders took unusually long. I had to order a few things more than once because it was missed the first time around. The staff looked overwhelmed with the rush. I did notice that our usual servers weren't there. Even the owner of the restaurant had to come help take orders as best as he could. I really hope this was just a one time fluke and that this doesn't become another sushi loca.

We came in at an off time but still during lunch and was greeted and waited on by the most darling girl! She was so sweet, attentive but not hovering, and just good at her job! The food was fabulously prepared and tasted amazing! We left there SO happy about our experience, with satisfied bellies, and couldn't wait to bring our husbands back! We both raved to them about this new place and were excited to bring them back to try it! Tonight was it. The food tasted great but the husbands were not impressed. They didn't seem to find anything exceptionally special on the menu and what they ordered was just okay. But that wasn't the worst part.....when trying to pay our bill, the staff informed us our card had been declined. It didn't make sense as we were both positive we had the proper funds. Even after checking our accounts and confirming that, our card declined again. After trying a separate card and having that also decline, they realized it was their system and began trying to figure it out. After at least 30 minutes of going back and forth and trying to pay our bill, they gave us 2 options. Either pay cash (which we didn't have), or leave our card number, expiration date, and name with them to run it when the system came back up! Ummmmm no?! You want me to give you my credit card information?! No. Well, with 2 babies (8 mo old with us, 2.5 yr old at home with grandparents) that needed to go to bed, it was already insanely late and this was just taking more time. The manager had already left for the night I guess, and I wasn't going to leave my credit card info. So I had to leave my husband there, rush a crying baby home to put him to bed, send my dad back to the restaurant with cash so he could pay, JUST as the system came back up...of course. All of this trouble and absolutely NOTHING offered from the staff or manager. The manager has supposedly been contacted so it's not like she was unaware. It's not my fault their system is down and they can't accept my payment. Being someone in the business of customer service, I'm VERY frustrated with our experience tonight and my husband has made it EXTREMELY clear, we will not be returning to this establishment. As a brand new business, it doesn't look good on their watch. Sad, but we won't be back anytime soon!",ZzZnRPeYkKLLxP5GM938JA,0,0,2,gJ5HWqdWPQ8Yb6oIq_iSIQ

The only downside was that I wish there were more ""real"" sushi on the menu, meaning more variety of raw fish in their rolls. There were salmon, tuna and spicy tuna that wefe in the rolls. So for those who can't eat raw, this is the place for you.

The place was clean and spacious with many places to be seated. AYCE lunch price is $21.95 from open to 3PM and AYCE dinner price is $26.95 3PM to close (AS OF APRIL 7th, 2018). Half rolls are an option for their signature and specialty rolls.

We ordered the super white tuna nigiri, salmon nigiri, unagi, lemon salmon (half) roll, popcorn lobster (pictured), butter fly (half), Wonder Woman (half), wet dream, Japanese lasagna, baked lobster (pictured), Capt. America, hamachi kama, baked green mussels, edamame, and miso soup. 
The top three rolls I recommend everybody to try is the Wonder Woman, Japanese lasagna, and Capt. America. The Wonder Woman roll had shitake mushrooms inside which tasted amazing. Japanese lasagna was perfectly baked and not overdone (pictured). The Capt. America had some spice to it but wasn't too spicy. 
I recommend to avoid the wet dream. I've had this roll in other sushi locations and for the most part they follow the same track of tasting good. However, Umami's didn't. The roll tasted sour like they added too much lemon to it. We don't recall the roll having lemon but if it did, they definitely need to lessen the amount on the roll. 
For dessert we ordered the coffee and strawberry mochi and an affogato. You are limited to only one dessert off the menu. The desserts we ordered tasted great!

The one con about this place is that service is a little slow in my opinion and the tables are weirdly sticky. When eating AYCE sushi, I want to order continuously trying multiple items from their menu. As for the tables, I don't know if the previous customer spilled a drink or something but the table was sticky and it felt gross eating on it.

food...?
Nothing really special.
Not different from an all you can eat sushi place. (Though yama sushi is much better)
Lobster ramen is too spicy, noodle doesn't taste fresh and broth is okay. (I'd recommend monta ramen for better noodle and broth)
Sushi rolls were not fresh at all. Why?

When it came down to the day of the anniversary, we couldn't figure out where to go, and decided against going to the strip. We were looking for something light and not terribly expensive.  Umami was near where we were staying and the Yelp reviews were good.  Maybe it's because we are from Seattle and have good sushi all around, but I kind of felt ""meh"" about Umami.  It was SO dark inside that we could barely even see the menus or what we were eating--I've been in dark restaurants but it was kind of ridiculous.  And it started out kind of strange because it took a long time for anyone to take our order, even though the place was almost empty and we didn't get refills on our iced teas.  The sushi was good--we had a sushi appetizer, and I had the lobster ramen and husband had a fish dish (cooked).  It's been a couple of months so I don't remember exactly what it was. I do remember that we wished that there was some sort of combination where we could try a couple of different things.  We ended up switching meals halfway through because my ramen, while good, was VERY spicy.  We both enjoyed the fish very much.

It was slow for a Friday night but being late I understand that could be the case in this quieter part of vegas. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. 
I personally like the bar so we found a nice corner. Drink orders were taken immediately and here we go. 
The rundown: I ordered the screaming o and a no. 5 roll. Screaming o was placed with the waitress and came first and the attentive chef took my order for the roll which he made before my eyes. 
The screaming o is a staple for me. I love it, it's great. Ask anyone that knows me, it's fantastic. In this preparation the chef portioned out the radish to fit the plate, then sliced it by the portion and proceeded to lay the tuna slices over it and drizzle the sauce. This struck me as different because when eating it ensured that each bite had the right ration of fish to radish to sauce with no biting and navigating of long pieces that typically would be nested on the plate. Rich, fresh, thoughtful. Everything I wanted. 
The no. 5 roll has Cajun albacore and cucumber inside with spicy tuna and crispy onion on top with a light saucing. This was amazing in flavor and generous in fish. You could taste the Cajun albacore even under the topping and onion. A big bite for sushi but well composed. 
All this with a Sapporo makes for a treat meal. 
My friend tried my selections and loved the screaming o but was terrified of the roll, she is a bit vanilla. Her order was a California roll and gyozas and she was satisfied.
The chef made us a delicious special after seeing the difference in our orders. It was a cut scallop bite with truffle oil and a fried garlic slice on top. It was so perfectly tender and the sweet hint of the scallop shined through. 
All in all I was incredibly impressed and will be back!",m1IVpXClMox1VGw5hO2LhQ,2,0,5,F2JVnjvQ0taOI-9qIwtfUw

The ambience could be so much better without the tvs. If I want to catch the game I can walk down to Buffalo Wild Wings! They're so out of place!!! Get rid of the tvs, paint some Japanese anime in their place and you have appropriate ambience.

Uuuuughhhhh wish I wasn't writing this review. I used to come here often when it was owned by the original owners and this place was amazing. They had an ala carte menu but honestly it was worth paying the price because the quality/presentation was soooo worth it.

Now that Umami has been bought out by the owners of Sakana (boooooo) they have completely changed the menu and are now an all you can eat sushi joint. So if you are looking for quality look else where, this place is all about quantity now.

First off, I haven't been a fan of Sakana. I hate the way they portion their nigiri with 90% fish and 10% rice. I was almost positive it was going to be the same at this newly managed Umami so I started off with a small order. 

-beef bowl
-chicken bowl
-seared salmon with lemon nigiri
-Japanese lasagna roll
-#1 roll chef makes

Umami originally had a beef bowl (gyuudon) so we were under the impression it was going to be the same delicious bowl, but when it came out we got a teriyaki beef bowl. The meat was SO chewy my mouth was getting tired after eating one piece. We ended up asking the server if we could switch it out for a chicken bowl because it was so hard to eat. They accommodated us and got rid of the beef bowl. The taste of the seared salmon with lemon was good, but I was right about the portions and couldn't eat the whole piece of nigiri. The lasagna roll was decent and so was the #1. Nothing special. 

The server we had was good and he was definitely handling a lot of tables as best as he could. When I got my bill he had still charged us for the beef bowl instead of the chicken, but he was so busy I didn't care to get it taken care of. It was a $1 difference. They gave me a 10% discount for showing my military ID.

I was definitely upset the whole dinner because I wasn't expecting the food to be that bad... but it was lol. I won't be coming back since I am not a fan of Sakana or Sushi Neko.",JtpZw-NLL5m6BNjd0LPQVQ,4,0,1,A3_0gBlnaIJsu9JLEZumWw

Mini udon is vegan friendly. They also have skewers - mushroom, tofu. A few other items like edamame and seaweed salad for my vegan/vegetarian friends. I'm trying to encourage them to get a little vegan menu. ;) I'll be here way more often then!

Where's it located? 
Same area as Buffalo Wild Wings/Zaba's


What you should order:
Depends what you're feeling...pretty wide variety here, from sushi to Ramen and even hot entrees too...

We started off with some Wasabi Tako and Amberjack Yuzu Truffle which was very tasty. We also split the Lobster Ramen which had spiny lobster tail, shrimp, scallop, mussel, bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms and scallions and a very generous portion of noodles. 
Great flavors, but be prepared for some heat as it is in a spicy seafood broth.

You can't come here and not order sushi??? Wifey got an Avocado Roll, I had to have my Uni, and we got the Ocean Trout off the specials board...we were undecided on a roll on the  menu, so Chef Kim offered to make us a special no-name roll which had soft shell crab and shrimp tempura inside, wrapped in soy paper,  and topped with salmon and hamachi. All sushi tasted very good, generous cuts, and we were stuffed!

There's an Entree section that offers stuff like Chilean Sea Bass, Korean Shortribs, and  Hanger Steak if you're not feeling the raw stuff.

We got their popular Strawberry Champagne Cake and an Affogato to share. Cake was like boxed mix and I didn't taste any champagne,  but it was made with real buttercream. Good first visit,  and thank goodness for this place, because there's very slim pickings for sushi up here in the hills!

The atmosphere was trendy and spare, with paintings on the walls and in the bathrooms and lots of wood and black, and funnily enough a good amount of upbeat K Pop style music and christmas songs. Great spot for large or small parties of adults for happy hour! Try the pear sake!

Impressed with the level of professionalism given by the new management/owner, who came to my table to discuss when I politely explained that the spicy miso ramen dish I'd ordered was not to my taste. 

He wanted to ask why out of curiosity. I've had it before in other places many times before moving to Vegas and I had nothing to hide since I barely ate any of it. Sometimes the taste just isn't what you expect! And he understood but was concerned.

 I felt very well taken care of, he even offered to comp my next ramen, which I said was totally unnecessary. I enjoy giving my business to a good place if they treat me well, once I find what I love to eat, and Umami has MANY options. 

The new management has similar offerings throughout Vegas in four other restaurants that offer AYCE options, which includes standard nigiri and baked/fried/hand rolls. Crab, lobster, tuna, avocado, cream cheese, ponzu, yum yum and SOS sauce seems to be the go-to on many rolls. I can't hate on it because it works. 

I've been frequenting one of the other ""partner"" restaurants, Sakana, a lot recently and having LOVED their options but hated the far drive, finding this place made me happy. The menus are similar and prices, but small differences in presentation and style. 

Our waiter, a young Asian man took a while to greet and seat us but when we finally sat five mins after entering what looked to be a nearly empty restaurant we saw that there were only two servers on the floor and a party of 12 on the far side, hidden from the front, and a few others. Also, the entire time our server was not only serving them but also preparing various to-go boxes. Poor guy probably prepped like 5-6 just in the time we were there, maybe for phone orders. He was as attentive as he could be, responding quickly to us and getting help from the other server and food runner. 

The rolls we ordered were great, dinner combo worthwhile though I wasn't a fan of the very acidic vinaigrette on the salad that came with the combo. I like mine genuine Japanese style with sesame oil. I ordered one to go as well. Overall, would come back as soon as I can!",j8bhSD379qzoVa15RSCBUw,1,1,4,4YfqD0RC-SAd3Uwt4L9faw

The service was the main reason I didn't give this one 5 stars. It took us a while to be helped and the women who greeted us made no effort to help out. 

The most important thing to me is the freshness of the fish and I thought everything was good!!

I love when places like this one offer 1/2 rolls as part of AYCE.

3952100,2017-03-31,0,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"I'm so happy there's a decent sushi/ramen place in Centennial Hills. Umami is just up the street from our house, which is AWESOME! My husband and I love this place! We came here on a Thursday night. When you first walk in, you'll notice the dark, sheek decor. The lighting was dim for dinner time. We were greeted by a waitress who seated us right away! You can choose to sit at a table in the dining room or at the bar to watch the sushi chef's make delicious creations. 

FOOD 

If I could rate this place based only on the food, I would give it 5-stars. Every dish was delicious! We ordered: 

1. Wasabi Octopus: Raw octopus w/ a wasabi sauce on top. It'll clear your nostrils as you chew on the tender octopus. 

2. Toro Nigiri Special: MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS! Get it. It's a special that you'll have to ask your server about. 

3. Applejack Nigiri Special: I've never tried the applejack fish before (I also hope to God I heard the lady right when she recommended it). The nigiri came with a sort of ponzu sauce w/ jalapeno's on top. I loved this dish! 

4. Tiger Roll: The rolls at Umami are well-balanced that is not rice heavy. It's a simple tiger roll that tasted good since the fish is clearly fresh and the technique used held the entire roll together w/o breaking. 

5. Lobster Ramen: The highlight of our meal was the lobster ramen. However, it is spicy!!! This bowl is huge. It's perfect to share. The ramen came w/ a generous serving of noodles, soup, a huge lobster tail, mussels and mushrooms. I recommend ordering this, especially for those who love their Ramen extra spicy. The ramen noodles I've had better elsewhere, but it's still good. 

6. Strawberry Champagne Cake: The cake is light, fluffy and semi-sweet. Get this as a dessert to end your meal on a sweet note. 

PRICE 

Our meal w/ tip was $100 for two people. Umami does not offer an AYCE (All You Can Eat) option. Everything is a la carte. The quality of the food and the generous portion of the Lobster Ramen made it worth the price. I recommend coming here for a special occasion since it is a lot pricier than other sushi restaurants. 

SERVICE 

The service is the primary reason why I knocked this review down from a 5-star to a 4-star. The service started off great, but they didn't staff properly so when it became busy our waitress forgot about us. We sat there waiting for our check for a good 15 mins before our waitress noticed we didn't get our check yet. Sadly, this is a common issue with new restaurants that cut costs by understaffing. I think as they become more popular it shouldn't be as big of an issue and they'll have a higher budget to staff properly. 

Overall, my husband and I loved the food at Umami. The service could be improved. If you come here, be prepared to spend money since it is higher end. The quality of the food, the taste and preparation makes it worth it! 

Happy Dining,

I really like the decor, dark and sexy. It's really dim with open space and a couple of booths. May be because we were the only ones there but the it felt really spacious. 
Food was fantastic! We tried a couple of rolls and washed it down with blueberry sake. Fish tasted really fresh. 
Tried: Anna Roll, Red Bull Roll, Rock N Roll. My absolute favorite was the Rock N Roll, if you like raw fish and cucumber - this roll is for you. I love rice-less rolls and I LOVE raw fish so this was BOMB for me. It comes with a sauce on the side. 
The Red Bull roll was really good as well, it comes with jalapeno slices on top which is a ""no thank you for me"" but it was yummy without it. Escolar on top and soft shell crab and cucumber inside wrapped truly fresh rice.
My partner in crime for the day got the Anna roll to honor herself :) It was pretty good as well. She also had Toro sushi, which I did not try but she really enjoyed.

They've changed management and now are just like every other bland ""all you can eat"" place.  One of the things that we loved about the prior menu was that they used quality ingredients, offered high end sashimi and other non-roll type food.  For this reason, we were there at least once a week and spent well over $100 each visit.  Tonight we sadly left and won't be back.

In addition to their new menu problems, any business that decides it's ok to fire all of their chefs and waitstaff with NO NOTICE is not one that I want to spend my money at.  The only thing better than their food was their previous staff.  We truly enjoyed that we could walk in, be seated, and the wait staff knew what we wanted to drink and the chefs knew what appetizers we wanted to start with.  Firing all of these talented people was a huge business blunder.

Sorry Umami, you've lost extremely loyal customers who are very vocal.  Instead of sending new people your way, we are informing all of our friends about everything we saw and warning them about all the steps down in quality.",rWdT4YGPZRXRFPiBbZ-kJA,7,2,1,1DcVUBfAHkm2yNCrr1rRJQ

It's $21.95 for lunch & $26.95 for dinner & worth every penny! Our server was kind enough to tell us for the rolls you can order **half rolls** so we were able to try more. She also checked up on us often to ask if we wanted to order more. All the food that came out was delicious and one of the better sushi restaurants i've tried.

The ambience is beautiful. Lot of space, beautifully and professionally decorated.  It looks very upscale. The staff was nice. 

The food was not great, but not bad either. We ordered sushi, tempura ice cream, ramen, and karaage chicken. The sushi rice was a tad colder and harder than what we're used to. Fish was OK. Chicken was warm and not piping hot as most other good places. But the sauce was very interesting and delicious. 

Service was work in progress. It was very busy. And our dishes were taking a bit longer. One was completely forgotten.  And other guests' dishes were repeatedly offered to us.

We have been twice and have sat at the sushi bar both times, which is my recommendation. The chefs are so helpful and creative. Both times we had the live lobster sashimi and it did not disappoint!!!!
All the sashimi and sushi was fabulous!!! We had hamachi, kanpachi, sake, ocean trout, bluefin tuna, scallops. We went with what the chef recommended on most part and it was great!!!!
I really loved the garlic edamame as well.

After I painstaking took them out, there were 2 sad tempura shrimp, 1 slice of fish cake, and a piece of fried tofu cut in half. The broth was typical udon you get from mixing water and the udon concentrate. The udon was cooked okay but had a lot of broken pieces like on the bottom of a package. There wasn't a lot of udon either. I'm rarely on this side of town and I'm rarely eating alone but I had a few hours to kill and wanted to try this place because it was newer and I used to live on this side of town when there weren't a lot of restaurants.

We went with a nice mix of rolls and nigiri. The food came out in a timely manner spread out few rolls at a time. ( I have been to some restaurants where they dump your whole order at once and it's overwhelming).  The presentation of the food was nice . The food was delicious , everything was fresh and great portions of fish , no ingredient was overwhelming.  I highly recommend the Vegas roll and the Sammon nigiri. 

The cost for a NOT ALL YOU CAN EAT restaurant was fair , not to expensive and good value. I think our bill for 2 people with beer and about 4 rolls and 2 nigiri was around $65.

I only hope that the quality stays high.

We are regulars and we have tried so many things already on the menu.  The things my wife and I love:

- Sushi & Sashimi Platter - Beautiful design, high quality fish, assortment of pickled sides.
- Shoyu Raman - Pork broth is slow cooked all day and isn't super cloudy.
- Short Ribs - Flavorful but not just slathered with sauce.  Beautiful marinade.
- Taco Wasabi - Raw Octopus with Wasabi sauce, its an acquired taste but they do it well!
- Tempura - Nice and Crispy!
- Number 5 Roll - Albacore Tuna, Spicy Tuna, and the best part fried onion rings!
- Strawberry Champagne Cake - Delicate and savory
- Tempura Ice Cream - Duh, it's just awesome!

The service is top notch.  They've only been open for 2 weeks and I've already spoken to Chef Jun and the Restaurant Manager several times.  They care about what you think and communicate with you because they want to know what they did well and how they can improve.  The wait staff is friendly but you can tell this is a little new to all of them.  Nevertheless, I always felt attended to.

The establishment is a reflection of a more high-end sushi bar that might be near the strip.  On the far wall from the entrance is a huge painted mural of samurai.  If you're a sports fan they also have large screens playing all the games.  One of my favorite parts this the music they play.  They have a mix of downtempo and upbeat instrumental hip hop.

Soooo a decent all you can eat on the NW side of town?! The owners of Hwaro (aka the best Korean BBQ spot around) has taken over ownership! If you like the appetizer, ""the shit"" there then serve you're in luck as they have it here too. We went 15 minutes after 3pm so we got stuck with the dinner price for al you can eat. The menu is large so many plus's to that and the wait staff is super friendly. The atmosphere is fun and cool as well. I'd like to see them busier but hey I was there at 3pm. I would recommend the pang for starts and the kiss of fire! Can't wait to come back here to update this review!!

5158579,2018-06-12,0,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"A pleasant surprise on the north west side! 

I didn't feel like cooking dinner and was having a sushi craving. I've had this spot bookmarked for quite some time and, as always, I was happy to be able to cross it off the list. 

AYCE sushi is my jam! For reals. If you've read other reviews, a pretty good handful of them are AYCE. What can I say? I like to get down with the get down.

The venue in the same parking lot as BOA,a few doors up from Cold Stone and a few doors down from China A Go Go. It's clean and comfortable, with two large TV's; one is a projection screen. They had the travel channel playing. Good choice, Umami. There were a few tables occupied at 9 PM on a Sunday night but we like to sit at the bar so away we went.

Service was attentive. Drinks arrived first and we placed our order for the kitchen appetizers, which was just one KFC. I didn't really like that my hot tea came in a metal cup because the cup was hot and I had to wait awhile to drink it, so proceed with caution in that department. 

KFC was decent. It wasn't what I expected but it was still good. But I didn't come here for the apps. We order d a few rolls; a veggie roll and salmon avocado roll, the lobster roll, the sashimi roll that's cucumber wrapped. We also ordered the seafood salad, oysters, and a ton of nigiri. 

Our sushi chef was AH-mazing. He was attentive and very very fast. Our rolls were well made. The fish to rice ratio was perfect throughout the meal, especially with the nigiri. I loved my veggie roll. It was probably one of the best I'd ever had. The veggies were crisp and actually had some great flavor. The fish quality here is spot on, too. Taste, texture and smell is of high quality. It really can be touch and go with other places. I was pleasantly surprised!

The real star was the nigiri. The salmon belly and even the regular salmon was so buttery. It just seemed to melt in your mouth. Another favorite was the Cajun albacore. I'm not usually partial to it at other restaurants, but his was unique in that it wasn't overly seasoned. I also loved the lemon and smoked paprika salmon. To be honest, there wasn't a piece of nigiri that I didn't enjoy. And best of all, there wasn't a huge mound of rice underneath. 

It was a great experience overall and I'm really looking forward to coming back and giving some more items a try-- including a few bowls of noodles.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,1,0,5,iTmXPAG1kVP8EvVwuLZSZQ

Umami has new ownership and had turned into the typical AYCE sushi place. I've been and was unimpressed with the new service or quality of food. Stay away.


If you're honest with yourself you know there hasn't been any really good sushi in Centennial. When I need sushi I've been willing to drive 20 minutes away for a decent restaurant. 

I think Umami may have changed that. My husband and I went recently on a weekday night and sat at the sushi bar. Freshness and flavor were comparable to the better places in Chinatown or on the strip. They had special selections of fish that were not on the menu but offered to us. And this is really important - the sushi chefs were very knowledgeable about different types of fish and flavor. We really like this place and will return!

Things I'd like to see- wi-Fi. If you had Wi-Fi I'd probably eat there every day. I can't come for lunch and be completely detached from work. I'd also like to see options like chirashi or donburi.

Hangar steak was good, asked for medium rare and it came out rare but quick fix, and was fast and delicious.

Next, they put a sign out front saying they were closed (on super bowl). If I New I would've gone else where obviously!!! The dates and times for business are questionable. Call before driving there.",d9DCHyL_vC5Il5YtaH6lbg,0,0,1,6Y_kGzZzKRCkyiTMNWrkOQ

Every item on the menu we've tried is beyond delicious. Chef Kim is no longer here but Chef Joon is fantastic!",BAz-SCwkySBlQoTW5giPDA,1,0,5,gJ4umT75nM7CZEm0WyeyyA

.... By chance I wanted to visit the T-Mobile store located at Durango and the 215 exit.....when I pulled into a parking slot, I noticed that the store almost in front of me had a big sign reading UMAMI (and that means tasty good in Japanese)...they had a sidewalk billboard with the words "" All You Can Eat Sushi  "" 

 ...We went in looked at the menu and it included Bento, Ramen, Udon, Teriyaki, & grilled  fish. Wow  

....we ordered one spicy  tuna and one California Roll...and both tasted freshly made using good sushi  rice. My wife ordered Tempura Udon and i ordered Tonkotsu Ramen-----the udon tasted delicious and my ramen was original and unique to this establishment ..and it was  tasty... will come back to this place when we don't want to drive into town for  Japanese food",mYuaXH4LULtDUJQyEn4YDw,0,0,3,_Ca92zsJIEliIl89qh24dw
5880720,2017-05-31,0,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"Very good. A little high priced considering a few Sushi places that are all you can eat. Not all great but a few are exceptional and a lot cheaper than this. Lobster Ramon is excellent, very spicy but so good. Sushi Rolls great as far as what we ordered. Oysters very small, too small for the price. Sushi, good but not so cold. Raw fish should be cold not room temperature. Staff was great the bus boys are awesome. (Hope the share in the tips because the really take good care of you).! Nice to have this on our side of town and will no doubt be back.",RIqF5RnBAzetCmyAXbVZiA,1,1,4,AML0ZskOvO9bHLnszOWFIA
5890243,2018-02-20,0,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"Umami was a Jewel, now it is like every other mediocre sushi place so disappointed, the new management has ruined what was a great experience, behind the host podium they have put their Togo service station that now clutters the sushi bar. They have also crudely taped paper announcements to the walls. The food used to be really good, today it was terrible the lunch Roll combo served a salad of iceberg lettuce and a couple pieces of spinach and julienne carrot with a squeeze of dressing in the center of it coating one piece of lettuce and saturated with water. The tempura was greasy and miso soup was I don't know what, more like dish water! The spicy tuna roll was mushy and the sushi rice was not seasoned. When we moved to the North West we were so excited for this restaurant and frequented often today will be our last time! The old menu was well written and thoughtful for the customer the new menu is just like every other place around nothing special.",ucvxSupCGzhIeabwLSBotw,0,0,1,VbU0MysygIoIIGdaZ2jutg
5911599,2017-03-14,0,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,Finally tried this Sushi joint that is still fairly new to the Centennial area. Prices and portions weren't bad. Modern decor. Waiter was great! I couldn't give all 5 stars because I could get all you can eat sushi down the street for approximately the same price give or take a few dollars. However they do have ramen that I did not try. I would go back to try that eventually. If you don't eat enough sushi to pay he all you can eat price. I would definitely check this place out.,0uSLt3BODXJBG1CQE2KfiA,0,0,4,WWFUVGR704OYffgAHU6K7g

5987860,2017-12-29,0,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"I'm so sad to have to give Umami a low rating. The reason for this is because it is under new management and we were pretty disappointed to see an entire new menu when we walked in. My boyfriend and I had been there before the management change and we absolutely loved it so when we went back we already knew what we wanted only to find those items were no longer available. It is now an all you can eat and the quality has really gone down. If we hadn't already ordered drinks we would have left based on how different the menu is. It's very off putting to have the same name but have everything different. If you have never been there before, give it a try since you don't have the original to compare it to. I will say they they are attentive and making sure everyone is taken care of so that was good! However, if you have been there before the management change you will be highly disappointed. As I am sure you will see from other reviews. I don't see us coming back.",8hFr2rtxQKh1EIH2eDvdcA,1,0,2,Rqn0cmpZLk1h_W0wVPIdiw
5993221,2017-06-02,0,BjrKNWhtQkedHw8hP_0Bjg,"Thrilled we now have Umami as a restaurant choice. 

We have been there several times.  We have had the Raman bowls which are filling and excellent.  The specialty roles are well worth the price, as the fish is always fresh.  The garlic edamame was very good..it had some kick.  I've had both the cucumber salad and house salad both great for inexpensive price. 

They offer a wide selection of food choices, including sushi, regular dinner choices, teriyaki choices, ramen dishes.  The prices range from low to high depending on the dish. 

This is not a fast food restaurant,  this is better dining. They have a few ""BIG"" booths for larger parties, which is nice if a lot of people share sushi dishes.  

I recommend this restaurant, the service and food is consistently great. My husband has degrees in culinary arts (chef), he's pretty picky.  He applauds this restaurant.  Do try some of the more expensive sushi specialty dishes,  they are worth the money.",8kjK_SE27MjYFo6mb_s31A,0,0,5,gt68BvpyoSsfkx83o3Qo3Q
