883137,2015-04-09,0,-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ,"I was really hoping to get a hat trick with Las Cazuelas and Windy City Beefs in the same center as this place(both 5 star eateries in my opinion...Check them out!) Unfortunately for Yummy Sushi, I love sushi and have eaten at the best, the worst and the in between. Yummy is somewhere at the bottom of the in-between unfortunately. 

Not set up like a traditional Sushi bar, Yummy has a host that is taking orders while cooks prepare all food behind a semi closed kitchen island. The host and cashier did not smile, however, they had little to do with the rating. We ordered 4 rolls to go; fried Philly, spicy shrimp tempura and Japanese lasagna. Fried Philly had almost no batter and showed the seaweed paper, shrimp tempura was soggy and barely spicy and the Japanese lasagna was predominantly rice. Unfortunately, the lasagna was the worst I have had out of any sushi place and I order it everywhere since it is the one roll that has converted my girlfriend to becoming a sushi or at least a sushi roll enthusiast. 

I hate to be so critical of this place, however, the surrounding restaurants and just about every other sushi place out there make it hard not to be. Also, despite the medium prices, there is no all you can eat. No all you can eat + 2 stars = what is the point?.....

All you can eat with great options and pricing in Henderson; Sin City sushi on Serene and Eastern is a great start followed by Sushi Mon on Maryland and Silverado Parkway. Both have awesome selection and all you can eat options. If you are looking for something a little fancier not for from the Henderson area, I suggest Zenshin in the South Point casino. From my 2 visits there they have had great sushi options as well as some nice custom libations.

For a fast food place Asian place, they are decent. I have never had a dish there that was horrible, but there are certain dishes that I don't need to have (and my life will still go on). I usually get the sushi here. For quick sushi, it's good.

-During the cold season, i was a fan of their ""yummy soup."" I add noodles for $1.50 and I can split this bowl of soup into three portions! 

-Chow mein is yummy but a bit too greasy so I've only got this twice. 

-Combination fried rice is yummy, but be aware, it's oily...so when I get this, I put a napkin on top of a plate, pour the rice on the plate and let some of the oil soak through. 

-Kalbi is good, but I can sometimes tell it hasn't been marinated enough.

It was fresh, clean and delicious! 
Very affordable prices. Most items are under $10.00
I will definitely come back.
I think they have 4 or 5 tables and 6 bar seats... they may also have some outdoor seating. 
They are across the parking lot from Target so lots to do in the area.",kYmp2l-1tGzXO0Y4T48y4Q,0,0,5,9Mr0KseOlXHhQE9QinbxSA

They do not have all-you-can-eat sushi, so if it is just sushi you are after you might want to go somewhere else. But if you like a mix of hot food and sushi like I do, this place is a little gem.

Had their spicy ramen...not good. If you're a fan of ramen, you will be very disappointed at this attempt. They somehow think we won't notice the egg is an overcooked poached egg, and not the magical melt in your mouth soft cooked egg at traditional ramen places. No fun veggies and broth is bland.

Once you get past the server's broken English then everything else goes by smoothly.  Just asking for descriptions, item recommendations, and the like was a bit of confusion on both sides.  

The food selection is actually quite extensive which includes Chinese, Hawaiian, and Japanese dishes along with a plethora of sushi and sashimi options.   My wife opted for the chicken and broccoli dish and a California roll while I had the French Kiss Roll and some saimin soup.

The saimin soup was okay, average at best, with the flavor of the broth leaving more to be desired.  I did enjoy the French Kiss Roll but the ""spicy"" symbol next to it on the menu could have very well been removed as there was hardly any hotness to the roll.  The chicken and broccoli is your standard chinese fare.

Overall, a decent quick lunch if you're craving sushi or Asian food in the area.  I will have to try some of the Hawaiian selection and shaved ice in the future.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,4,2,3,wAfRDQt8lOCqp74tBZNdpg

Stopped at Yummy Sushi out of convenience. The first sign of inferior food should be the name, ""Yummy"". I went in and fully intended to try sushi, but instead ordered the spicy ramen with added pork for an extra $2. I also ordered the steamed beef dumplings. 

The Ramen broth was actually very good. A nice amount of spice and a decent depth of flavor. A few off putting things, chopped red bell peppers (I have never seen this type of pepper used in an Asian styled soup before), and the ramen noodles tasted like they were from a $.25 dorm room favorite. Beyond that, the pork was tender and the other veggies in the ramen were decent. Nothing to recommend so far.

The steamed dumplings were a little chewy and flavorless, but when drowned in the provided sauce, they were meh.

Unlike regular Korean restaurants, they serve bon chan, the little side dishes. So because this was an Asian restaurant, no bon chon here.  But that's okay.

The mac salad could use a little help.

4100772,2017-01-25,0,-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ,"I have been here a few times previously.  This place was ok previously, but whatever changed... now its not so good. 

My wife and kids used to like the meat jun.  But this past trip it was not so good.  Meat was stringy and not quite so tender.  Also the meat jun sauce seemed like teriyaki with oil on top.  Not your typical vinegar shoyu sort of sauce.

Seafood Combo was ok.  I didn't care for the egg-battered fish.  It just seemed so amateur.  A panko crusted or just flour would have been better.  Supposedly it was mahi-mahi... but it either wasn't, or was very old.  The pieces were very thin.  In any case, it wasn't very tasty.  And the packet tarter sauce provided was unappealing as well.  The shrimp tempura was ok, but I kinda feel like it was the frozen stuff from Costco.  Also no tempura sauce... WTH?  They gave a teriyaki sauce only.  The grilled shrimp ok as well, nothing special.  

My next comment is not a gripe, but an observation... WTF is with all the salad on the plate?  I had salad, which was ok, but the fish (kinda small in quantity) sat atop a mountain of cabbage!  I like salad, so like I said its not a complaint, but damn it was a lot of green.

Now to the really bad part... The salmon sushi we had was terrible.  The menu picture shows the salmon wrapping all around, not just the top.  This was not the case when receiving our sushi.  Also the salmon tasted old and fishy... It was also slimy which is another sign of being old.  I had one piece, and could not bring myself to eat another.  My kids seemed to like it, but they don't know any better.

Service was ok despite all the other yelp reviews saying it was terrible.  I don't know that I want to return here anytime soon.  I will probably just sit back and watch other yelp reviews before giving this place another chance.",7ZSjntRADa_sV8vbTk_j5g,0,0,2,Xmk-J6FbZds3ZbQUqvI5IQ

After a few passes by, and no water he reached for my plate as he was asking if I was finished. I informed him that I was not and was finishing my edamame.

i've never really tried their ""chinese-style"" entrees, but they looked too greasy for me to be appetizing. Sushi was average, not too fresh, but not terrible. Deserts (frozen peach sorbet) was yummy, albeit a bit frozen.

Overall, just an average sushi place. Okay for lunch if you work near-by, but otherwise, go somewhere else.",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,0,0,3,eFxhb0Wjrebb1dxKYGDpIg
5374320,2011-11-09,2,-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ,"Yummy Grill is a quick grab bag of Asian cuisine. There are elements of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Hawaiian influence in their menu. This is one of those places where it is easy to stop in while running some errands.

The food comes out quick and the prices are reasonable. For three people, we had lunch for $35. That included three entrees, one roll, and two hand rolls. The food is solid and there was nothing to complain about. I had ordered the Mongolian Tofu and a Spicy Tuna Hand Roll. My main meal came with a large scoop of rice and two cream cheese rangoons. As a lunch special, it came out to be a little under $7. The amount of food was generous and filled me up. Kept me filled until dinner and that is rare with Asian food. 

They are set up like a fast food joint more than a sit down. The prices are a little high for that, but the food is good.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,3,4,DkPU-K84gN-03kLv57BvIw

5393277,2010-12-21,2,-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ,"I wasnt expecting much from this place, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is located in a strip mall next to a Target. Not exactly what you think of when you think great food. The interior is really informal and there were a lot of people coming in for carry-out during lunch.

The people who work there were all very pleasant and the service was good. I was in the mood for sushi so I ended up with spicy yellowtail sashimi, a spicy tuna handroll and a california roll. All were at least average, good stuff. Honestly, of course a place like this isnt going to compete with some of the top sushi places in town, but it definitely holds its own in the midmarket sushi category. I would say the freshness here is spot on, really good, the only downfall might be the fish quality. It isnt top of the line, but definitely above average.",A_dC3FJOqvlsDEiDyMrzlA,3,2,4,Y9cmFcuOkwJWZ5mrMqlVSg

Although a good portion of the menu is sushi, they have a broad menu covering other cuisines which is good for my family because not everyone is a fan of sushi like me.

Four of us came on a Saturday night and decided to sit in the restaurant right by the open kitchen. But you can also order from the counter to go, pick up, or delivery. There were about three servers on the floor covering the 7 to 8 tables and the service was prompt and friendly. Wait time was minimal, orders were correct, questions were answered, and drinks were kept topped off.

The first two pages of the menu are sushi and the second half of the menu is split into Grill and Chinese sections. The Grill sections favors Japanese items but also has a little Hawaiian influence. From the sushi section, I'll usually get the chirashi bowl has a nice variety of fish for the price. The nigiri and rolls are pretty average. Other family members order from their hand rolls which are the perfect portion and dirt cheap. My daughter has been on a spam musubi kick and she was happy that they offered it.

I enjoyed the BBQ short ribs and was very pleased with the portion size and the seasoning on the ribs. They were grilled just right and served with a scoop of white rice and macaroni salad. Also ordered were the teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken which come with the miso soup and a salad. My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which of course I had one wrap and the chicken was well seasoned in fresh, crispy lettuce. Portions were large and about 3 boxes of food had to be taken home giving us good value for the $52 price tag for our four person meal.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,7,4,4,5ajHzGhKsxdR2Vli3AscsQ

So after doing much research on yelp I came across a few places that deliver and this was one of the first ones on the list...I'm less than 5 miles away from this place and I was just flat out refused service for delivery. I even offered to pay an extra delivery charge in addition to what they had. I also clearly stated that I had a big order but instead got a chuckle and a flat out no. I ended up calling Island sushi instead which is about the same radius as this joint and was greeted with friendly and helpful service.

This place is tiny, so  you can't easily take a large group.

Since they deliver I will probably eat here again but we can't afford lunches that high very often right now.

Regardless the food was fresh, and cooked very well.  My husband's teryiaki chicken breast was some of the best I have had, although it took them forever to cook it.
