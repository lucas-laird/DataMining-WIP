Service was quick and friendly but the first bad sign was that they didn't have real butter for my bagel, only a butter substitute, which is just not my thing.  I ordered a cinnamon apple bagel and the way it was put together made it very difficult to eat, because the apple pieces were rather large chunks that kept dropping onto the ground as I bit into the bagel.  Luckily I was eating it outside :)
The part of the bagel that had been under the apple was very doughy as though it hadn't baked properly.  On top of that it had perhaps been stored to close to the savory bagels because I would occasionally get a bite that tasted strongly of garlic.

My family and I had visited this location 2 weeks ago on a trip to Vegas, and even though the bathrooms were totally filthy we were at least happy with the food.  This last weekend, we were in Vegas again and I insisted that we eat there. We were there Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Each day, we had to clean our own table before eating as the eating area wasn't clean. 
On Sunday, we all sat to eat (6 of us) and when I left, I accidentally left my purse on the chair at the table. I noticed I had left my purse there literally 1 block and 1/2 away from the store, drove back like a crazy person.  When I came back, I ran inside to see if the purse was still at the table and started asking employees if they had seen it.  One employee said that she had not seen anything, that she didn't clean the table that it was another girl who was on break. She suggested I speak with the manager, who said she didn't know anything.  When the girl who was on break came back in the store I asked her if she had seen anything when she clean the table, she said she hadn't clean the table that it was the other girl. I asked the manager if I could see the security tape to see if a customer picked up the purse, etc.  The ""manager"" said she had to call someone (another manager maybe) to see if we could see the tapes. I waited 45 minutes for the other manager to call back, never did.  During the 45 min that I was there not one of the employees came up to us to see if we were ok, offer any help or even a glass of water.  Only person who came up to us, trying to help was one of the customers, a really nice gentleman who said he had seen us there earlier but did not see if someone took the purse.  
I'm glad I didn't wait for the ""So called manager"" to call back and see if we could see the security tapes... I'd probably still be waiting.
On the positive side, my purse did show up, a wonderful, honest, kind, loving lady picked it up for me, called my bank (I had already reported my cards as lost) and the bank got me in touch with her.

They also have delicious pastries. The chocolate chip coffee cake is amazing, as well as the pumpkin muffin (seasonal).  

I enjoy coming here for lunch and getting the chicken salad sandwich which is very tasty. It has chunks of white meat chicken, celery, dried cranberries, and toasted almonds. Then they add lettuce, tomato and onion. It's definitely one of my favorite things to get there.

Some could argue that I shouldn't have brought my drink into the store, but no where did I see a sign for ""no outside drinks or food"" on the door or walls. He did NOT apologize for the choice of words that he used to accuse me with and went on to accept my money.

When we got there we were the second people in line and before I had made the order, the number of people in line was almost to the door, I would estimate at least 10 people in line. However, the line moved quickly and by the time I had paid and got my bagel sandwich, the line had dispersed. 

We tried the Chorizo Sunrise and the Smoked Salmon bagel sandwiches. They were both good but the Chorizo Sunrise was exceptional! The first time we tried it, the green chile bagel was still available, the second time we had it, they had run out of the green chile and we had it on a jalapeño bagel.

On Mondays, you can get a dozen for only $7...this place has a steady flow of patrons and they're not slow. The staff was helpful when I asked about the ingredients in one of their speciality bagels and looked it up for me.

I don't recommend this place if you can't enjoy a good carb. I mean seriously IT'S A BAGEL SHOP. Don't get me wrong, they have options for the calorie counter and fat phobic out there. 
This review is for those who love a good chunk of bread fresh out of the oven. That's what I love about them. The bagels in sandwiches, or toasted with butter and sugar... Maybe a dozen plus a couple containers of your favorite schmear. Even lox. The Juices are fresh and dated and the staff is friendly.

Of course I loveeee the bagels, lox, cream cheese, tomato, onion and caper combo, my waist line can't always get one! Although, when I do, the salmon is always fresh, along with the bagels.

Additionally, the staff at this location seems to be different every time I'm here. Not sure if it is high turnover or coincidence. Service has room for improvement. 

The PB&J bagel is interesting as well.....a bit difficult to eat as a bagel and doesn't really go with anything but is flavorful on it's own. Probably better off just eating PB&J on a regular bagel honestly.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,2,1,3,WfvnBrflQe2t3wZ2tFiHkg

There were 4 young females trying their hardest to train a new girl, who was working the front cashier position, and keep the flow of all the orders being made in an orderly fashion. From walk in to walk out I was there 25 minutes. That is uncalled for this type of establishment. The new girl had some issues with my order and called on another employee for help. After the 4th attempt my order was put in, I waited 15 minutes for a 1 egg cheddar bacon bagel on honey whole wheat, not a complicated order to make. 15 minutes of watching the chaos of these young women try their hardest to keep calm, train the new girl, get the orders in and made while having aggravated customers talk to them in irritated tones. I watched 3 customers who came in after me leave with their orders as I stood there looking at my bagel with egg and cheese sit on the food prep line for 2 minutes. I received my food and in the less than a minute drive it took me to get to my office my food was barely warm. Please get new management that is willing to be there for their team as well as their customers.

It started out, I stood under the ""Order Here"" sign for almost 10 minutes, made eye contact with at least 2 employees. I finally asked about ordering, and was told that they were taking orders at the ""pick up orders"" end of the line. I asked why they tell me that when they saw me standing there - she responded that the employee by the register was announcing it - no apologies. I went down the line and ordered, then waited 20 minutes while they prepared my single toasted bagel with shmear. While waiting, I noticed a line of 3 form under the ""order here"" sign. Again, workers ignored them and left them standing there. I finally went over and told them to move. Terrible service, terrible attitudes. My earlier review was removed because it lacked detail, thus the reason for the detail here. It was by far the worst experience I've had at Einsteins.
