Came here for the all you can eat lunch and really enjoyed it. Everything was fresh and the service was excellent with a very friendly and likable staff. We will definitely be back! PS they offer a free beer or sake with the purchase of the all you can eat buffet... AWESOME!",8SxkPsBBN9EbTRKShDUv1A,0,0,5,-V24N4BPLwPhdE44NG7VXQ
1135909,2013-10-07,0,Wyjk6RBeOPQr7td5Tqwksw,"Let me preface my entire review today by saying that Sushi Katsu is still on their soft opening phase and anything I say here could potentially change by their grand opening in two weeks.  Having said that, this new restaurant has a lot of potential and could be a great addition to the valley's ecosystem of ayce sushi joints.

I came here on a Monday noon for ayce lunch and my experience is quite interesting to say the least.  It feels like I was going to a friend's house whose family happens to make great sushi and are inviting me to join them for lunch.  There's just this homey hospitable feel to going here as supposed to other established restaurants where all the employees have their dedicated tasks.

In Sushi Katsu, the single wait staff was also the kitchen staff who made appetizers and reminds me of my grandma on her golden years, she'll just keep telling you to eat more and not be shy.  The sushi chefs were equally friendly and enthusiastic.  They were very interested in knowing what I thought of their food and how they compared to the other sushi places in town.

I ordered omakase and entusted my palette to the chef who dutifully obliged.  I was able to sample all of the nigiri they had in stock, plus one roll that's not on the menu.  The fish were fresh, prepared skillfully, and tasted great!  The nigiri style here reminds me of Sushi on Rainbow in that it's purist and minimalist - only the fish on top of sushi rice with an appropriate portion of wasabi.  

There's nothing wrong with pre-sauced nigiri, which when done properly is quite delicious, ie. Sakana's nigiri. However, you can appraise the fish quality much more accurately than if there's already sauce.  I also sampled the gyoza and shumai per the previous reviewer's recommendations and found them to be of excellent quality.  The miso soup and edamame I had we just ok.

Last menu item worth mentioning is that you can get a single order of sashimi if you choose the $19.95 ayce option on their menu.  That sashimi was yummy, though I wish it had hamachi too!  It's just awesome that you can even order sashimi for that ayce price.  Btw, they have several ayce pricing tiers beyond the 16.95 and 19.95 mentioned in the reviews thus far.  Please see my uploaded pics.  

Because this place is still in soft opening, I feel that it will be unfair for me to rank them against other established sushi places we have in Vegas.  Let me just say that Katsu isn't a complete restaurant yet, more like a work in progress.  Things are changing and there may not be total consistency yet.  From my perspective, I see the makings of a nice, new,  unpretentious ayce sushi restaurant and I'm rooting for them to succeed!",X87BI29HpGXLwjnqbAOctA,5,0,4,FN2oIZpPhhVtTP7AtbHwgQ
1248683,2014-01-15,0,Wyjk6RBeOPQr7td5Tqwksw,"Came here with my cousin. I'm a big sushi fanatic so I thought we'd try out this place. Staff/employees were very friendly and professional. Did the all you can eat, of course. Saw a sign in the front of the store about getting free sake/beer with the ""all you can eat"". So we asked about it and got the sake & beer. Which was great, went well with the sushi.

Ordered some seaweed salad & poke. Followed by a dragon roll & crunchy roll, loved it. Asked the sushi chef if he could make a special hand roll for me with any raw fish. Got a delicious hand roll with tuna & salmon w/ veggies.
The guy who greeted us as we walked in recommended some things on the menu. Appetizers etc. We got miso soup & oyster shooters. The oyster shooters were really good & fresh. 

Overall, place was clean & the staff was cool. I'd definitely would go back again :)",MZl73crpmjLwt1eNQEuZaA,0,0,5,xcns3alIysBufrr1hqEklA
1865193,2014-09-22,4,Wyjk6RBeOPQr7td5Tqwksw,"Not surprised to see this place is closed- a little relieved.
They had a Groupon up, so they were clearly hurting for business. Shit-talking your existing customers generally doesn't encourage more people to give you a try, either: see management's response to Paul G's review. That alone dropped my typical 3-star-mediocre rating to a bottom of the barrel single-star.

Menu is small, not too many specialty rolls and even when you order them they are small. Take out seems to be a hassle for this location but dining in would take a century and a half.

Fish is not the freshest and pricing is on par with places that have better quality. There are so many other places in the city that do sushi better and with more variety, sans an attitude problem.
Good riddance.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,3,1,IFGNDNzP9dJWyuZLQLYCFw

2180338,2014-01-26,0,Wyjk6RBeOPQr7td5Tqwksw,"They tried, they really did. This is a group of people that WANT to see you leave satisfied, you feel for them and want to see them succeed but everything just doesn't connect . First of all, they needed to hire an interior decorator. Walking into the place was an ordeal, they have this metal fence out front which I understand is for outside dining but just looks terrible. Then walking inside you experience this cold, office fluorescent lighting and tables and benches which reminds me of an old deli or, well, an office space from the early 90's.  The menu was confusing and disorganized to say the least as well.

Food - The nigiri was good. We had a few choices: salmon, tuna and white. Good size pieces and good flavor. They had about 5 ""special"" roll options with about another 10 ""standard"" roll options. We had a few but the only memorable one was the Spicy Crunch roll. For these few positives, it doesn't make up for the rest of their follies. The problem is for the same price you can head to Yama, Sakana or even Sushi on Trop and have a WAY better experience and food quality. 

It was nice to see a sushi place on this side of town, we need it, and I was excited to try this place. Unfortunately, I feel it will fall victim as the rest of the startups around here and start sacrificing quality for quantity....

As a final note, like I said in the beginning, these people are nice, they try to serve, but they need something to connect the dots and get someone in there that can help them succeed and change things around.",FxPl561TXJKicHyejdmM4w,3,0,1,lYIezn5WzzEAxnjELDPfMg
2537434,2013-12-29,0,Wyjk6RBeOPQr7td5Tqwksw,"This was my first and last visit to Sushi Katsu. I stopped by yesterday because their van parked out by the street has a sign which advertises they have clam chowder.
Upon entering, I asked the manager, who took my order, if they make their own
chowder as I thought it was an unusual item for a sushi house. He assured me it was homemade, so I said ok, I'll try it as I love good chowder. 
  While I was waiting for my soup, I was looking at the fish at the sushi bar as I 
was thinking of ordering some sushi after my soup. I noticed some fish under 
plastic wrap in the glass cooler where they prepare sushi from. It was dated
12-20-13. The date of my visit was 12-27-13!!!!!!!!!
   I brought it to the attention of the sushi chef who was standing behind the sushi bar doing nothing as I was the only customer in the restaurant. 
He said ""someone forgot to change it"" and just looked the other way. He did not even 
look at it or try to verify that it was fresh. 
  At that point I decided I would not even consider eating sushi here as they had 
fish at the sushi bar that had been there at least a week!!!!!!!!!!! WTF???
  Ok, so the manager comes out with my ""clam chowder"". It was so obviously from
Campbell's Chunky soup can that I asked him again if it was homemade. He said yes but that he didn't have the right pot to make it in............WTF???????????
  After taking 3 spoon fulls I reached into my pocket and put down the money to pay
for the ""soup"" and walked out.  Canned soup is unacceptable in a restaurant and
I don't like being lied to. I also don't like seeing food in a restaurant that has a date of preparation a week old.
   Although I usually just write reviews for restaurants I find exceptional,
I feel it necessary to write this review as this was by far the worst restaurant
experience I can remember. The food was horrid, I was lied to, and I observed outdated food at the sushi bar. I now know why I was the only customer in the place

3360364,2014-07-04,1,Wyjk6RBeOPQr7td5Tqwksw,"We came here for lunch last week.  We had a coupon we had purchased online and thought we'd try this place.  The visit started off badly when we arrived at the place and there was a handwritten sign saying that ""All Groupons must have reservations"", with a phone number listed.  So, we stood outside in the 100 degree Las Vegas heat and called for a reservation.  We were asked when we wanted to eat and my wife told them, we are standing outside and are here for lunch.  They told her the manager wasn't there and could we call a different phone number and talk to the manager?  So, we did.  Again, my wife asked if we could make a ""reservation"" and told the person on the phone that we were here for lunch.  He said is would be over in about 15 minutes.  Say what?  Not sure what his presence at the restaurant had to do with us eating lunch.  My wife asked, ""Can we go inside and order"".  Yes, you may.  Sheesh! 

So, in we went.  A nice lady promptly seated us as we were the only customers there as lunch time (a bad sign?).  We ordered a la carte sushi from the ""Groupon Menu"", huh?! We were quickly given water to drink.  About 10 minutes after we ordered, a young man showed up at our table with headphones on.  The manager perhaps?  Not sure, he didn't introduce himself, but he wanted to know about our coupon.  He took the coupon.

So, after all of that, the sushi came out.  It seemed decent actually, but who wants to go through all of that to order a few sushi rolls?  This place will likely close within a couple of months due to bad reputation and no business.

I feel bad for the waitress as she seemed nice and polite.

I definitely would not come back.",AXlnMURHlXfQMQyQjS6Y8Q,0,0,1,f4t-L_VS2rP-Z8NYXHr9dw
3446995,2014-04-17,0,Wyjk6RBeOPQr7td5Tqwksw,"I took some friends here last night, hoping to expose even more people to my favorite sushi spot, but I was really disappointed to learn that they no long offer all-you-can-eat Nigiri sushi!  They were nice enough to serve us nigiri last night, (even though it is no longer on the menu), but they let me know it would be the last time.  I can't tell you how disappointing this is for me.  Their rolls and kitchen menu items are outstanding, but not being able to get AYCE nigiri sushi means I won't be going back.  Don't get me wrong, if you are a ""rolls only"" person this is a great place to go, but for me this was like finding out that my favorite place for burgers and fries now serves only fries!  Sorry guys, I'll miss the great sushi and wonderful staff.",wmE7kY21MnhX2_wQdeKz7A,2,0,3,eK_U1uMmPmdyQl8tfkh06A
3675358,2013-12-26,0,Wyjk6RBeOPQr7td5Tqwksw,"Saw this across the way from the Walgreens Plaza and decided to stop in and try 'em out. The place is nice and clean but still puts off that hole-in-the-wall vibe. Regardless, it has a nice relaxed vibe to it and currently doesn't have too many customers during lunch; definitely to my liking haha. The lady who sat us was very nice and took care of us the entire time. She gave us a bunch of lunch options to choose from (ie. all care, lunch specials) , but the interesting part of Sushi Katsu was the way their AYCE options were structured. They have two AYCE options: A and B. The A option was the lower priced AYCE option and consisted only of rolled and hand roll sushi plus a limited appetizer menu ($16.95/lunch, $19.95/dinner). The B option boasted the bigger menu which included nigiri in addition to the rolled sushi and a expanded appetizer menu larger than the A option. So many options to consider but we ended up going with option A. 

Overall, the sushi was pretty good. Wasn't the freshest fish but I've definitely had worse. I am a fan of Katsu's crispy rolls (crispy albacore FTW) and the spicy tuna roll. Personally, I thought they could've dialed up the spicy a little more than they had it based on my high tolerance for all things spicy but it still came across well. Made sure to touch on a yellowtail roll and some salmon rolls for good measure and it didn't disappoint. Our waitress also hooked us up with some baked mussels that wasn't on the appetizer menu for option A and they came with a little bit of mayo and a touch of ikura. Again, not the freshest I've tasted, but I downed them pretty quickly nonetheless. 

Not too shabby, Sushi Katsu! The food was good and the service was even better. I will be back to follow up on option B and check out the nigiri offerings. Solid effort from Katsu; looking forward to the next outing.",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,6,2,4,gab2H3zk47rqG4yE8QwKjg

5969598,2014-03-17,1,Wyjk6RBeOPQr7td5Tqwksw,"I came here with a group of friends because they wanted to try something new and I said why not.  A few days later, I'm regretting my decision having tried this place unfortunately.

FOOD-First of, I'm a big fan of sushi of all types but this by far was the worst experience I've had from a sushi stand point.  My friends and I order quite a bit of nigiri and each piece of fish was warmer than it should be to be considered ""safe to eat.""  The fish was supposed to be colder than it was but it wasn't and so it was very off-putting.  We had also ordered some oyster shooters and luckily those were cold.  Their options overall seem very short, not many choices for rolls or hand rolls and the overall size of the rolls were tiny (about 1.5 inches in diameter).  But it was the warm nigiri that got me sick two days later from eating it.  It wasn't fresh whatsoever and this is my biggest complaint of the restaurant.

SERVICE-We had a large group so understandably, they would fall behind and credit to them for trying to keep up.  But when a waitress comes up to you and says to remind her what you ordered after you had initially placed an order, that's unacceptable.  There's a reason you have a pad of paper and that is to keep track of the orders.  Our food would come out 15-20 minutes after our initial order.  If they really want to do business with big groups, they need to prepare themselves better.

AMBIANCE-It did feel like a traditional sushi restaurant.  The decor was bland, there was one big screen tv showing some PBS programming and the placement of the sushi bar itself from the rest of the tables seemed awkward.  The layout didn't seem to make sense to me and I'm not sure if that's due to them being fairly new or poor planning.  

I will not be coming back to this restaurant, regardless of if my friends invite me to join them.  No offense guys, but I'd rather pay more for a reputable sushi experience than go to a cheap place and find myself nauseous a few days later.",PIqY8tBBbRIWmdpW7EFEUw,2,0,1,DOP5X4Ja9CiJTmuyCQdpMw
