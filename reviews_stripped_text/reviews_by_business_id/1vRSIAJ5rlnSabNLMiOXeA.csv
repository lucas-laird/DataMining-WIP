The fried zucchini and jalapeño poppers were freshly fried and very good. The famous stars were both cold and we went from the drive thru to our house about 2 miles away. Really already lol 
The fries were just basic, nothing special but not to bad. 
Very disappointed they took off their sweet potato fries.

4496913,2017-03-07,0,1vRSIAJ5rlnSabNLMiOXeA,I pulled up the drive through at 11:50pm on Saturday March 4th. All the lights were on and I saw a female worker behind the counter with a headset on. I sat there for 5 minutes. Even talked to speaker and tried to get anyone attention. At 11:56 all the lights turned off and was informed they were unable to serve me. Close wasn't until midnight. I am very disappointed I has to wait that long for anyone to even tell me they are too lazy to serve customers.,LLkVk2kUhDAl_C_qN0vZvQ,0,0,1,T-iytT73cYWTfmcqGMzn1g

4833936,2018-03-05,0,1vRSIAJ5rlnSabNLMiOXeA,"So saw lots of commercials last night for the western bacon cheeseburger about 12 to 15 of them within a 2 hour period. Made my stomach growl so I told myself I would go get one for lunch today. The strips of bacon, melted cheese, onion rings and patty on the commercial made it so tempting. I head to this Carl's Jr and the drive thru gentlemen was very pleasant. He gave us large drinks because they ran out of cups, which was nice. They didn't have ranch which was odd, but he also said they ran out. I ordered the western bacon cheese burger meal and my gf ordered the chicken bacon club. I made a joke as we were driving home that I bet they ran out of regular size parties and onion rings. We both laughed, but to my surprise when I get home there is bacon bits instead of strips of bacon, 2 small pattys instead of their charbroiled full size patty, and mini onion rings. Lol this place can't even keep their products stocked for their burgers they advertise on television..",MwL8gs1G4bORzdbkIrmE8A,0,0,1,eiPXUFxfO9s2PYNG4dOpBQ

They have not gotten our orders wrong yet, so there is a good thing.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,3,phTG6TkoDhputRQ42af2pg
