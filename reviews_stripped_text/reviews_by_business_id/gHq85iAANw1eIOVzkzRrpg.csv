70105,2017-07-31,0,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,"Horrible experience from start to finish. One waitress asks for our drink order which was a coffee and OJ. She doubles back in a minute to ask if that was 2 OJ's and a coffee?  Then another server stops by to take our drink order? We're all set the other girl took our order (We hoped). I understand corporate stores but this training for new staff was horrible so far. Only 3 or 4 tables in entire store were occupied when we arrived early. We placed our food order and I watched as the QA (quality assurance) guy slash manager was trying to quarterback the room. His job is to read the orders placed under the heat lamp, ,make sure the right items are on the plates and call for runners to take food. My order was the 3 egg combo and it arrived with 2 eggs.......Not major problem yet but keep in mind these servers place orders on a tablet and don't have to even use memory to try and make it to the closest POS and enter everything like other places. Then you take into account that this place has a QA manager to double check cooks errors. I also noticed toast wasn't buttered. I asked for butter and why wasn't it buttered and the manager/QA guy says it is upon request only. Hmmmmm, why weren't we informed by server I asked to which he replied, they are supposed to. He took entire plate back to the kitchen instead of getting me butter or a new batch of buttered toast when I could have began to eat. In NY, that is illegal to take food away and bring it back, even to take leftovers home, they just bring you the box instead of walking your food around the restaurant. Training horrible from top to bottom. Will never be back nor refer to this place or the $4 Orange juice to anyone !!",4x5AZ_ehShV13IqnMNAbyA,1,0,1,BHk04XRAIK3DOJ202uIgaA

First time I went it in, service was great for a party of two. The waitress was friendly, explained all the specials, and was attentive. They were pretty busy which probably led to confusion. We ordered our food and shortly after we were brought someone else's food. When we told the waiter it wasn't ours he looked a bit annoyed and confused. The customers behind us told him it was their food. Not a big deal, it was busy. Eventually our food came out but the orders were wrong and had to send them back. The manager was very nice and apologized. Didn't think much of it because it was busy.

We came back a second time, they were busy again but we were sat down within minutes. This time we were sat at a table that had just been cleaned, but the seats and table were still wet. We asked for napkins to wipe down the excess water but no one came back with napkins. I took napkins from the table nearby ( I know not cool) and when the waiter saw me cleaning he didn't say anything. We instead got a different waitress. She was nice and friendly as well. Food came out and it was the wrong  order again. I felt bad sending it back but we were both missing/had wrong items. Manager came over and apologized.

Last and final try. Wasn't greeted, someone just told us to pick a seat. Took a while for someone to come over to our table, no napkins, no silver ware. They weren't that busy, it was a Friday around mid morning. We finally got service but weren't told about specials, waitress seemed a little impatient to take our order. We didn't get refills on coffee or water; when I asked the waitress for silverware she seemed bothered and didn't give us napkins. My eggs were very runny and had to send them back. 

The food is what you expect diner food to be: big plates and satisfies that diner food craving. I was hoping this would be my breakfast spot but hey it's vegas and there are plenty of other options. Happy dining to you all!",H6Ype_OiCKQNxL8EdBT4MA,0,0,2,87QjWVvGCMd27mDJvaEtpA
455921,2017-09-05,0,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,"This restaurant was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners,Drive-Ins and Dives. Gave it a try and gave something a try that wasn't on a ""Special Menu"". I was beyond amazed by the non-greasy croissant French Toast and topped it with fresh strawberries & granola. The server recommended the strawberry butter and boy the flavors just exploded! I loved my plate so much that I ate the whole thing! Lol! A lot of the servers even stopped by our table to complement on the concoction I ordered and a few of them also said ""I'm gonna have to try that"" and ""I would have never thought to make that and it looks so delicious"".

My husband ordered the house chicken and waffles. Boy that chicken was so tasty and full of flavor. Served really piping hot (so be careful). The server explains that it comes with spicy syrup and they come table side service to mix it in front of you (maple syrup with 7 drops or so) of hot sauce. Now that's a full of umami explosion party in the mouth!

The host and servers were very friendly. Except for that one girl that worked the front while we were on our way out. One guy acknowledged us for ""how was everything"" ""have a great day"".  Then there was this one girl that just thinks great customer service doesn't leave a good impression once the customer leaves.  I overheard her commenting to her co-workers ""you all sound like a broken record."" This girl was the same one that didn't even acknowledge us or even say good morning when we walked into the door. Sorry but not sorry...this girl being stationed as a host should not be in the front where the first and last customer interaction is at. All in all the majority of the friendly staff outweighed this one girl.

Took about 10 minutes for our food to get to us; overall, it was a great, first-time experience. Zero complaints.

My second time coming to this place, I came in the afternoon and had Monique as my server. I came by myself this time, so getting my order placed went through quickly because like I said, I'm very fast on deciding what to order. It was also really busy at the time; every table was taken and there were people literally standing outside as they were waiting because of how packed it was. But surprisingly, my order didn't even take 10 minutes to make it to me.

Both Dario and Monique were very friendly servers; they definitely gave me a welcoming kind of vibe. Big shoutout to the two of them :)",EN2dSjkDTWO6wS4CpZZrAA,0,0,5,Shlbl8tlGz12Hj0-BgEuWQ

Metro started in Jacksonville, Fl (my hometown) and I frequented Metro Diner each and every time I travel back East.  They seem to have a simple philosophy - good food and good service.  And fast.

Metro's version is full of flavors, but none overwhelm the rest, and the presentation is spot on.  Very friendly staff and management is very visible.

The quality, not so good: i had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and hash browns. The eggs, hash browns and biscuits were average to good diner food. The gravy was bland, like they made a country gravy and added cooked sausage to it. Although there was lots of sausage, the predominant flavors were milk and flour. I know it's healthier, but without sausage grease, it lost its flavor. 

My wife had the San Francisco Benedict. Again, the English muffin, the egg, the Canadian bacon and avocado all average to good diner food. The Hollandaise sauce was seriously disappointing, lacking a decent lemon flavor, with an off color. I don't expect most restaurants to make a true Hollandaise, especially at these prices, but they can do better than an off colored, oil flavored substitute.",ZL_zmesRw89J8PrsdJg6Uw,0,0,3,6Ms8wRfU0h4SYHB3Tg0ZLA

A friend had arrived earlier and was seated waiting for us to arrive. Upon entry, the hostess had instantly known and brought us to join him at the table. 

As always, service is great. Very attentive in every way. 

I decided to try the Metro Club. It includes ham, turkey, bacon, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on 3 slices of fresh white toast. HUGE sandwich cut into quarters. I only ate 2 quarters and saved the other 2 quarters for breakfast the next day. It comes with half a pickle, which is delicious as always. Lots of meat piled up with a thick slice of bacon. Simple but delicious. 

One of my friends got the Bissel Breakfast. Two eggs any style, choice of bacon/ham/sausage, choice of hashbrowns or grits, and a short stack of pancakes. She opt'ed for bacon with hashbrowns. I don't remember the eggs as the yolks were gone FAST ! wtcrap girl ! i didn't even see a drop of residual yolk, anywhere ! the hashbrowns had a very crispy top layer, which almost all disappeared as well, but luckily she got full and i got some of it. HEHE ! Last but not least, the short stack of pancakes. Anyone who knows me knows ive been sick of any sort of pancakes for like the past 10 years, since the one time a few friends and I decided to take advantage of IHOP's free pancake day... For some off reason, this pancake was really good. Another thing i noticed, the syrup was hot ! Unlike the syrups that sit around on the table all day long. I don't know what sort of drug they put in this pancake but it was good ! jk about the drug. i cant explain it ! 

Last but not least, my other friend ordered the fried chicken & waffle. half a fried chicken and a belgian waffle, topped with powdered sugar and sweet, strawberry butter. Served with their signature sweet and spicy sauce. When the food came, the waitress had accidentally dropped a piece of chicken on the floor. She QUICKLY apologized and had another one made ASAP ! He's not one to eat a small amount but requested help for the chicken. When the replacement piece came, we took it instead. I got the drumstick while my friend who ordered the bissell breakfast took the mid and tip. The chicken was super flavorful and juicy. VERY reminiscent of korean fried chicken i had in Korea ! Even the white meat part that somehow ended up on this wing was very juicy and flavorful. Of course it was super hot since it just came out of of the fryer but dang. They definitely put the chicken in a brine of some sort because, YUM ! Their signature sweet and spicy sauce consists of the previously mentioned warm syrup and hot sauce. The chicken doesn't need anything !! i mean, some spice is always welcome, but if you dont like spice, its definitely not a requirement. 

Another good meal ! Cant wait to try other things again !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,3,4,AFFychUR1nZ4-857kGkY6Q

Service is so excellent that they're able to keep up with some custom orders AND get them out in a timely, with a smile. Today's option was the mom omelette with two extra eggs, a beef patty, and extra crispy hash INSIDE the omelette... previous orders were Charleston shrimp and Grits with 4 extra pics of fried chicken... A burger with and extra regular party, chorizo party, fried egg, poached egg, and all the fixings. These guys will do any food item.

You may be thinking that all this heaviness is a bit much, but I'm accustomed to heavy dishes and they're a diner that actually doesn't overdo it with the grease... unless you ask them to. Great flavors. The chicken is almost always magically juicy. The grits have a nice crispy outside texture and smooth inside texture. The burgers are always done well. The hazelnut coffee hits the spot before a really heavy workout session. Great food and great atmosphere.

Will definitely eat again.

P.s.

I eat here 2 hours before a workout on weekends. Once that coffee hits you after your meal, you'll have the ability to go on forever. I hit a PR last time I ate here.",TZCPXnoK4UeUBrgH7oxxhw,2,1,5,RAxNrxwPNTOvM3t9F2S9Dw

Everything on the menu sounds delicious but I narrowed it down to two items to try. I ended up ordering the fried chicken and waffles and croissant french toast. 

Fried chicken and waffles come with hot maple syrup. The server brings it over and adds a little Louisiana hot sauce to it. The mixture paired well with the chicken and the waffles. The waffles were super soft and crispy on the edges. I do not think I have ever had waffles this spectacular before. The chicken was moist and fried to perfection. 

The croissant french toast was buttery and fluffy. It is not like any other french toast I have had before. It had a chewiness to it as well and you do not need to add much maple syrup to it as well. 

Our server was attentive but messed up my coffee order. I wanted regular coffee but she brought over hazelnut instead. The coffee tasted great so I did not mention it to her. Once I was done with my coffee, she brought over a refill as well. Prices are fair and portions are large.

The place was still busy but the wait for a table for 6 was no more than 10 minutes. The service was great but the dinner food was ok. Nothing really hearty or filling for diner/comfort food. We ordered the meatloaf dinner, club sandwich, chicken fried steak dinner, half order of the chicken & waffles and kids grilled cheese. The meatloaf was delicious but only two small slices. For the price, were expecting a huge platter of meat. The club was mediocre with way too much sharp cheddar cheese that was over powering all the other flavors, I ended up picking it off. The chicken fried steak was good but again, not a lot for the price. The half order of chicken and waffles was perfect for our 11 year old. The syrup is a hot sauce blend to give it a little kick. The kids grilled was a regular size sandwich but had entirely way too much cheese for a kids meal. I had to cut off so much cheese so my 3 year old would eat it. You think of diner food you want comfort hearty food and I didn't feel Metro was that, at least not for lunch/dinner Foods. I have heard good things about their breakfast which is more reasonably priced so I would be back to try it out. But would not return for lunch/dinner.

Businesses open and close all the time so whatever just a little amazed the location didn't make it to its 1st anniversary.  Well I had a hankering for Metro so drove to the Rainbow location.

Service great as always, but the food was not up to the standard I was used to at the Trop location.  Corned beef hash was dry, like so dry the corned beef was crumbly and really fine in texture, and the poached eggs were over poached.  Nothing worse than dry CBH with over cooked eggs to boot.

What we found, was that these are more a Southern style, but delicious none-the-less. And when you try the fried chicken & waffles, you can understand this place is doing a lot right.

Somewhat casual dining, but with a pretty decent vibe. The people working were all very upbeat and approacheable. Service was attentive and non-intrusive. We visited on a weekday early, so parking wasn't a problem. And even though they had televisions overhead, they weren't terribly distracting. I would definitely call this family friendly. And that fried chicken and waffles will make a great kids' order.

The menu is full of comfort food. And sometimes, this is just what the doctor ordered. They do a few things very well. That fired chicken & waffles had a very nice, light and crispy skin (same for the fish-n-chips). The portions are definitely for fat Americans- generous to the point of take-home left-overs. I can see this place looming large when the craving for comfort food takes grip.

Just so you don't think this was a paid advertising, I do have to let you know of a big Fail on their menu. Served with the fried chicken & waffles, they'll mix up a small cup of Loisiana hot sauce and maple syrup. This is actually a horrendous idea. One pinky's each was enough to place it on the opposite side of the table for us. But, since this in an 'extra', and not even on the menu, I'll forgive them for that. 

I can't see how elderly people and families (or anyone, really) can miss here. Did I mention they make a mean fried chicken & waffles?",TgW-w80-ketnwdUsjsAaNw,3,4,5,bAcNdYv_SDfzR5rJaHU__g

We've gone twice and both times it was crap. 

The first time I had the meatloaf. I've never had meatloaf with that consistency. It was like baked dog food, only not as good. 

Today we came for breakfast. I ordered the breakfast pie (their specialty), Mike had biscuits and gravy. 

We waited 35 minutes (literally). When our food arrived it was obvious that Mike's food had been sitting. His eggs and hash browns were cold and there was a gross film over his biscuits and gravy. 

I ordered bacon with mine, but I didn't get it. You'd think after waiting for so long they could've at least served me some improperly cooked bacon. 

The manager came over with her bullshit apology. It was inauthentic and patronizing. 

I've seen the reviews on Yelp, the owner's mother must have written them, because anyone who's ever been to a restaurant in Vegas could tell that this place sucks.",YYbPsFrMEdD8C1m4EhXOpQ,2,0,1,uQuPI0aTbsXdW0Po4G24dg

The waffle was really good... I am kind of picky with my chicken so I didn't even eat it, the crust was just off it seemed. 
My favorite right now is the chicken salad with honey mustard. It's not anything super special but the veggies are crunchy fresh and I really like their honey mustard dressing. The chicken on this salad has always been good... not sure why the chicken with the chicken and waffles was so bad that one time.

Not crazy under but enough that it looked like snot and I didn't want to eat it. I've never had to send back an over easy egg and when I told the waitress that they were a little under for my boyfriends taste she went on to try to explain what an over easy egg is. I know what an over easy egg is. They poach their eggs instead of fry which might have been why the egg whites were a little snotty unlike fried eggs, any way he ordered the special which was a breakfast quesadilla instead and again low quality ingredients in mass amounts. He was only able to eat one slice because of the grease. I ended up getting the croissant sandwich with egg cheese and sausage. Simple enough. And I got a side of home fries because the sandwich came with nothing. The home fries tasted like they were frozen then fried.

It had a lot of meat which is good, but it only had cheeze. No green peppers or onions and, again, not grilled! The bread was fresh and tasted good and the fries were fine, but I wanted a Philly, not a French Dip Sandwich. This is a basic American sandwich! My wife's hash was mostly potatoes and very little hash. She could tell the eggs were low quality and not fresh (hard to get here in Vegas, but you can). They were cooked they way she wanted, just poor quality. Again, the service was very good and we were hungry, so didn't complain, but how are they going to change can-bought hash with too much potatoes or learn how to cook a Philly??

Not wanting to wait any longer I saw five seats at the counter so I said that would do. The waitress service was excellent she was super efficient and nice. The food was hit and miss. I had the San Francisco egg sandwich and it was perfect. The grits were instant and not that great.  My daughter had the loaded fruit waffle the waffle was good but there was not a lot of fruit. The manager could see I was somewhat annoyed at the entire experience and he came over and apologized and gave me two certificates worth 14 dollars each on a future trip to the restaurant. He also brought out more fruit for the waffle.

My boyfriend got a burger and said the bread on the top of the burger was different from the bottom, I didn't try it but my guess is the grease made the bread a little more mushy. He said the fries were average, and nothing special. The waitress advised him to not get the Mac and cheese because she said it resembled boxed Mac and cheese.

I went with my wife and three toddlers, as you can imagine, our table can be a handful and is prone to sudden urgent needs, such as a new fork, 10,000 napkins, or another plate of pancakes (seriously have no idea where they put them, I'd look like a TV weatherman if I ate like them). Tim was responsive and exceptionally friendly the whole time- he even laughed at my dad jokes, which is impressive, because my usual audience is toddlers, so I lack practice in entertaining without fart noises.",bae3uqCbqHNNbZlkkrRXiw,0,0,5,jNsJqGh_Q2gZjUje7iO38g

As a fan of this buttermilk bird, the choices around town span many contenders. Let us delve into the Diner's entry into the ""50 shades of gray"" decadent comfort food (because white and dark meat together... no?)

Served all day, the portions we received were substantial; breasts and thighs coated in glistening golden brown breading, each bite emitted a familiar and satisfying crunch that would make Col. Sanders jealous.

The explanation was that these birds were placed in a secret brine for 48 hours, and it held up its juiciness throughout the meal. The delicious birds were accompanied by a healthy amount of waffles, topped off by strawberry butter.

Only time will tell which poultry masterpiece reigns supreme, but in the meantime, feel free to be transported back to the childhood days as the you enjoy every bite of chicken and waffle.",jxrQ-mgqdT13Kh77pXLMaA,1,1,4,_nfrobDlBVkv4aMimeVUfA

My family and I arrived around 11am to have a brunch together. I was immediately surprised by the selections of food I had to choose from. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day long which was a huge plus for me. I'm not a big breakfast person so this place was off to a good start in my books. 

I give this place 4 stars for the lack of service and bland taste. I ordered the Avocado Toast which may explain the bland taste but the service was missing. I absolutely loved the guy that served us but we were handed off a few times which made it confusing when we were trying to order with someone. When we did place our order another person would come up and ask what we wanted and we would have to explain that we already ordered with someone else. I loved the servers but it seemed a little unorganized.

You can sit wherever you feel comfortable, and we were immediately approached by our friendly waitress (whom I cannot remember her name sadly) she brought us our drinks and was very polite in explaining to us what is on the menu. Now, although it was 3 in the afternoon, I decided to order pancakes, bacon, and eggs. The food came quick and was absolutely delicious.

3258021,2018-01-21,0,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,"Gave this place one star because my boyfriend and I went in and ordered food to go last night. First off, the person taking the order didn't write the order down. Now I've been to restaurants where a few don't write orders down but they have pretty good memories and get the order right. This one however didn't and we had no idea u til we got home (15minutes away). He ordered a San Francisco Benny and ended up with the crab cake benny. On top of that, if it's your first time ordering from here, can't tell the difference until u bite into the food because the poached eggs and hollindaise sauce is on top. Well, not wanting to waste it since it was late and they'd close soon anyway, on top of being hungry, he ate it and the whole night he felt like s***. He got up throwing up every couple hours. Pretty bad food poisoning from that benny. I went in the following day to speak to the manager and although he said he could be refunded (I didn't have my bf's card n he was home resting, still feeling sh****), he did not seem apologetic one bit. I was left at the lobby area for a few minutes under the impression that he'd come back and call my bf for the card number so he could refund him. And while I was waiting, the two hostesses didn't ask if I still needed help. It wasn't until one of the servers came by that I said something. Very disappointing experience. Now I don't even trust they'll call and give us a refund. I don't even care about the refund but it's the principle that matters to me.",D5JQHL4HJrk9J_ij-m4dBg,0,0,1,eslMgZkV7VMj1YylVz4Ynw
3269478,2017-09-17,0,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,Ordered the crab Benedict. Where do I start there was one drop of hollandeise sauce on it. The crab  looked like tuna Dark brown. Never in my life have I seen brown crab. The hollandeise sauce was dripping in oil.Tasted like the butter you get at the movies that had been sitting for days. The hash browns well they tasted like somebody poured entire bottle of salt on them. That I couldn't even try to eat. I would recommend never going to this establishment.  My friend had chicken pot pie. She said the reviews on here for it was good. After the 2nd bite I asked her to rate it. She said she gave it a 2. It had no sauce in it and looked like they put a can of mixed vegetables in the bottom of the dish. It had 3 very small chewy pieces of chicken in it..

The hollandaise sauce was perfect and the egg was dripping with yoke as the fork slid through it . My only suggestion would be to put that fresh Avocado on top after the structure is complete. The way it was made, with the Avo in the middle, made it warm and lost the essence of the cool Avocado. But...all in all, it was delicious. Thanks Alot!!  The wait staff is top notch as well! Our server, Autumn, was very tentative and made sure we were taken care of during start to finish. She made sure our FOOD was correct and looking fantastic!!

When you walk into the place, there's a clear ""diner"" feel, as expected. There is a large specials menu board in the back that the host points out to you as they walk you to your table, if you've never been there before. (The specials are basically just variations on normal menu items) 

I love a good breakfast! They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner all day long (I love when that happens lol). The menu is laid out in a very simple-to-understand fashion and shows *in green* what the most popular items are. Prices are very fair. I had a ""favorite""--the corned beef hash with poached eggs and a biscuit. My friend had the french toast special that was listed on the specials board this morning (not sure how often the specials change, but today is 09/15/17), and we both had the ""special"" hazelnut flavored coffee. 

Everything was DELICIOUS (I tried some of my friend's french toast, too). The coffee was amazing (why can't I ever seem to achieve diner-style coffee at home?? They make it look so easy), the service was impeccable and the entire experience from entry to exit was wonderful. Everyone was friendly and made sure that our dining was top-notch.

My ooooooooooonly problem (and it wasn't huge, seeing as I didn't even bring it to management's attention) was that my food arrived kinda... cold? Not freezing. Not undercooked. Just... not as warm as I expected it to be when first coming to the table (and I mean, I dug in pretty quickly). The corned beef tasted great! But because it was slightly room temp, it took a little bit of the enjoyment out of it. And the biscuit most certainly wouldn't have melted butter if I had put some on it--just as a reference for how ""not hot"" my food was.

I will be back, there's no doubt about that. I love the atmosphere and look forward to trying different things on the menu, too.",WDm0OqWQoLuqFo36woMiEA,0,0,5,0W_Ksq5BYZ2ZzNjJJzmz6g

Soup was so thick it was like red sludge loaded with overloaded chucks of partially cooked onion, not even a good flavor and far far from being a bisque.
Cheese sandwich was not hot enough and cheese was like rubber.  French fries were just okay.
They say it's down home southern cooking..to us it is just a greasy spoon with a fancy name and an insult to southern food.  Maybe other entrees are better.  My contention is and always will be..if it's on the menu and it's being served, it should all be up to par and good.

( Please put some more places in Mountains Edge)  I have already been to Metro Diner 3 times in the short time that they have been open. They are doing a very good thing so far.  First time was The Pork Tenderloin Sandwich and the Reuben. Pork sandwich was very good. Reuben flavor was good but was frankly a little thinner than I am used to ( Thats what I get for going to Jasons Deli previously).

The Second time we went for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised,  We had a great meal with Crab Benedict and the Corned Beef Hash. Crab cakes were pretty good, but in context with the meal they were very nice. English Muffin was a little too hard, though. Corned Beef hash was excellent and eggs perfectly poached. We even got the Bananas Foster Cheesecake which was fantastic. 

The third visit, we figured we needed to get what they have on a lot of their signs and we got the chicken. I got Chicken and Waffles and my wife got the Chicken Dinner. Both were amazing. Chicken brined and marinated and perfectly cooked. The breast wasn't dried out and the breading was flavorful. Strawberry butter on the waffles was fantastic. 

A gentleman came by and asked how our meal was and we told him how much we enjoyed the food and service. My wife asked what he did there and he politely replied.. "" Well, Im the owner"". THAT is impressive. The fact that Nick came by and was checking with tables himself says everything about this place. Please, please keep that part up, guys. Guests appreciate it.

I got really excited when this location opened since it was really close to my home, so I've gone here probably four times since it opened. Everything I've had has been really delicious with one exception - my Holy Davoli Burger was moderately overcooked. I didn't actually notice for the first few bites but I did notice it was lacking flavor for such a ridiculous burger. It is a burger that uses grilled cheese sandwiches instead of buns.

Unfortunately the burger was probably medium-well or well done and simply had no moisture left in it, which led to the whole sandwich being dull.

Still, I've had the chicken salad sandwich, the chicken and waffles, a fruity waffle, as well as the steak sandwich with fries in it. I've also sampled a number of other dishes. The steak sandwich I would categorize as okay (just wasn't impressed by the flavor combo) and everything else has been quite delicious.

The staff there were very friendly and everybody seemed to get along well. Our server, Dario, was friendly and very knowledgeable with all the specials of the day. I saw an order of chicken and waffles that was ginormous so I knew right then what I was getting. My friend Karen wasn't as sure since everything on the menu looked delicious!  Dario was very patient and helpful as he helped her navigate the menu. She finally settled on the blackened chicken tenders but was really feeling the meatloaf. What was making her apprehensive was the meatloaf had mushrooms which, she's not a fan of the fungus but Dario assured her she wouldn't taste it because of how it was prepared. So we compromised and order a slice ala carte for 2.50. So glad we did because we both thought it was amazing! Now back to my chicken and waffles. The chicken was juicy and fried to perfection. The waffles with the strawberry butter that had real strawberry pieces in the butter and powder sugar complimented the waffles perfectly. Then of course to really enjoy the chicken and waffles, Dario made this syrup/hotsauce combo that was great for dipping, don't let the hotsauce/syrup scare you,it went well with the chicken and waffles.

I live right down the street & I've been wanting to try it but haven't had a chance until now. I looked up reviews & ordered some of the stuff that was recommended. Let me start with I would've given more stars if I could've actually enjoyed the other half of my food. I ordered the biscuits & gravy with a side of sausage patties which came with eggs & home fries. They dropped off my food & my gravy was almost cold & being that it was house made gravy I expected it to taste better than that. The server was really nice  & took it back for new one. A man that looked like a manager brought it back out nice & hot , but the gravy just wasn't that good. The sausage patties that cost about 5 bucks for 2 pieces tasted like it was cooked yesterday or something? Not good either. The home fry potatoes on the side tasted like they fry a bunch of it & have it under a lamp or something & throw them on a plate per order. I think I just made a bad decision on my order. 

Ok...what made me still want to come back & maybe try other items on the menu is the nice staff & the CHICKEN & WAFFLES! I never thought I'd like it cause I didn't like the whole concept of chicken dipped in syrup, but throw some Louisiana hot sauce in the syrup & it was so good. Sweet, savory,salty, with a lil kick. The waffles came with their house made strawberry butter which was delicious. I didn't even use the syrup with the waffles. The strawberry butter was enough. A must try item for sure.

I'm not a breakfast person, and the lunch and dinner items left very little for vegetarians. Basically, a grilled cheese or an avocado wrap. No option for a veggie patty or vegetable sandwich. I ordered the ""avocado wrap"" with the black beans on the side, with the side dish being ""steamed vegetables"". My guy ordered fried chicken and waffles. 

The wrap came out mostly spinach, was missing the fried jalapenos, missing the chipotle ranch, and only had 2 small slices of avocado. Barely any cheese. The black beans that were originally supposed to go in the wrap, was brought to me in a 2 oz ramekin. I assumed the side of steamed vegetables would be an assortment of veggies, but was only zucchini and squash. They did taste good, just not what I expected. I asked our server about the missing ingredients in my wrap and she said she would get a manager. Took a while for said manager to come out. I didn't ask for her, the server just told her to come speak to us. Manager told me the wrap only comes with half an avocado for the entire thing (it's a sizable wrap), but she would put extra for me this time. Seriously? If the focus of the dish is avocado as advertised, there should be a decent amount. They must have really small avocados, based on what came out the first time. After some time, the manager brought me a new wrap (with double all the ingredients, which I didn't request, but was appreciated) and said my side of veggies would be out soon, but was forgotten. By this point, my guy was almost done eating so I had a few bites of the wrap and asked for a to go box. I gave up on getting the vegetables, which our server brought to me as she brought my to go box, because, according to her, she asked around who's veggies they were and no one claimed them so she figured out they were mine. I ended up taking home the majority of my food to eat at home. The wrap was good, but that was with extra ingredients requested by the manager. My guy said his food tasted good and was a large portion, but the chicken was more breading than meat. One star for a friendly server, the other star for the wrap tasting good, but only after doubling up on the ingredients. For my avocado wrap, his fried chicken and waffles, 2 ice waters and a glass of milk, $28.00. Likely, won't return.",PTfIcx4u7-VaDRaGp0mAdQ,3,2,2,G35F-ySe520VJL7WCwHrSw

Whether you're dinning alone, as a couple or in a group, the seating here can accommodate you. There's counter service, booths, tables with chairs and a small outdoor seating area. It's a great local spot for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. In all of the multiple times I've been in, I have never had a meal I did not like! 
The staff is always friendly, the service is always great and the food is consistent. The open kitchen let's you watch all of the action. Fresh brewed iced tea and coffee, often with rotating flavors (examples brewing peach, raspberry, mango tea and French vanilla, hazelnut for coffee) Portions are worth the price. 
The Food...
A few of our favorites are....
1. The chicken fried steak! It's a real piece of meat, not super processed and frozen. Hand battered when you order and fried to perfection. It is not on the everyday menu, but if you ask and they have all of the necessary ingredients, they'll make one for you. 
2. Fried chicken and waffles. Their fried chicken is amazing! Flavorfully seasoned and fried golden brown. The waffle that it is paired with is fantastic too! I like to take some honey or syrup and hot sauce mixed together for a little spicy & sweet dip. 
3. Charleston shrimp & grits. The fried grit cakes with cheese, covered in shrimp sauce, topped with shrimp, bacon is both filling and tasty. 
4. Huevos Rancheros. This is when I found their magical fried jalapeños slices (that go good on EVERYTHING). It's breakfast nachos.",FANt14cGQpOJskxQUQBK1g,3,2,5,BZPX2sUWdJ5JeIIr_Q65fA

Prior to this visit, I've only eaten at the Tropicana location.  I can vouch for the food and the excellent service at the Trop location.  I have never received less than stellar service from an employee of Metro Diner and food has always been good. So, I expected the same excellence at this Metro Diner.  Our main server was Mary Lu and she was great.  She even recognized us from the other location.  She is a machine, a well-oiled machine.  She was taking orders, serving the food, checking up on guests, and cashing them out.  This Metro is new and I assume that most of the staff is new too. Thank goodness for Mary Lu.  

As for their food, it's all good. The have their signature dishes like the Chicken & Waffles, the Shrimp & Grits, the Bold Burger, the Chicken Pot Pie, and the fried sourdough Monte Cristo.  There's also a ton of other breakfast dishes, burgers, sandwiches, and seafood in the menu. Here's a tip...most dishes are huge.  Come here hungry or expect to take home leftovers.  I've tried half of their signature dishes and recommend the Chicken Pot Pie.  My favorite dish isn't even on their menu.  I love their Meat Lover's Omelet.  It's a handful of eggs stuffed with bacon, sausage, ham, cheese, and awesomeness.  It's not on their menu, but they can create it for you.  On my most recent visit, I got their hamburger patty with a side of eggs.  And because Metro Diner allows you to make substitutions on almost everything, I swapped the hash browns for a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup. This cup of soup is also worth the trip back.  I know, I'm raving about broccoli.  Who loves broccoli?  Well, I do if it's at Metro Diner.  I highly recommend this as a side.  My mom would be proud.  I ate all my veggies. 

Overall, I am more than just a fan.  I think Metro Diner is as good as it gets when it comes to breakfast eats.  It also doesn't hurt that Metro Diner believes in great customer service.  If I have one regret, it's giving the Tropicana location just 4-stars because they're better than that.

The biscuits and gravy were okay...ginormous, but did not have that buttermilk, southern-style taste I was looking for. Also, I did not like that they were drenched in gravy and sitting in a massive pool of it. Why not drizzle some gravy on the biscuits and then put some on the side to enable the customer to add more if they want to? I returned the dish to the waitress. As for the croissant sandwich, if it wasn't for the bacon, it would've been bland as hell. I expected them to butter and lightly fry each side of the croissant prior to assembling the sandwich to add buttery cheesy goodness, but they did not do that which made it a below average experience. Strike 3 was dessert. I ordered the peach cobbler and received a extremely sweet peach crumble/crisp as big as my face.

Surprisingly there were other customers visiting and a lot of employees still being trained. It has that retro diner look like johnny rockets or norms.

I had taken maybe three sips of my coffee and came back twice after I told him I didn't need a refill yet if I wanted more coffee. So I just gave in lol 

Their menu is expansive the have their omlettes, pancakes and waffles, basic breakfast plates, burgers, sandwiches served all day so it can take a bit to decide. I chose the pot roast and it's actually really good. I'd go back for it. The meat was tender and the broth it comes in was perfect, the mashed potatoes too. It was all well seasoned and not too salty or bland and flavorful to the perfect level. The portions are also huge enough to save for two meals. 

My friend ordered an omelette and he said it was still a bit undercooked on the center and the salsa they used he can tell was from the jar so he was a little disappointed about that .

Metro Diner exceeded my expectations and I'd definitely come back! This isn't a cheap diner where employees just want to get you in and out. Its way better than an IHOP that's for sure. It's good quality food, freshly made, quick service and employees care about their guests. My boyfriend had the corn beef hash and I had two eggs with bacon. Both dishes were great and a good portion. John was so accommodating to our needs especially when we asked for a side of rice and avocado. The teas came in fancy yummy flavors.

I had the croissant French toast which was lovely.  I tasted my husband's biscuits and gravy which were seasoned perfectly and the biscuits were light and fluffy. Lots of sausage in the gravy too, not light on the meat.  My favorite thing was the home fries.  Javi explained that they use red potatoes and boil them and then do a quick deep fry.

The MONTE CRISTO SANDWICH was amazing. I definitely recommend it! The sourdough is fried to a perfect crisp. And when they say it is stuffed with turkey and ham, they mean it is STUFFED.

4352236,2017-10-15,2,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,"It's like your classic breakfast joint (IHOP, Dennys, Egg Works, etc) but it has more of a community feel. It's most definitely a chain restaurant, but they somehow captured the feel of a small community diner. Plus, they have more option than your average breakfast joint.

As someone who spent a lot of time living in Texas, it was nice to see some grits (cheesy or plain) on the menu. I got them plain with my Bissell breakfast, and oh boy, it was like nostalgia with every creamy bite. They're not bad, but they definitely don't compare to the grits you get back in the South.

As for the rest of the Bissell breakfast, I got 2 sunny side up eggs, dry sourdough toast, bacon, grits, and half a waffle (subbed a waffle instead of pancakes). The eggs were okay. Nothing that warrants a deeper explanation. They were cooked fine. I feel like everything was cooked well, but nothing really sets this place apart in terms of taste/flavor. 

What makes this place unique is the options they have like chicken and waffles and grits as well as their homey, community feel. Other than that, the flavor is pretty average in the sense that I got what I expected and wasn't completed blown away.

The service was spot on and our waitress came by every 5-10min or so to refill waters and ask if we needed anything. Something that sets them apart from other chains is their service. I feel like their waiters waitresses are all very friendly and approachable.

Overall, if you're looking for a decent breakfast place that makes you feel very welcomed and you want some more breakfast variety, Metro Diner is your place.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,4,3,4,7FMxjia_X8WrmZ4u-AC_Fg

People/service - excellent.  You can tell that everybody from the greeters to the servers to the kitchen to the bussers to the management are motivated, display urgency, and show that they understand and care that the customers coming in are the lifeblood of the business.

The food is excellent for a self-proclaimed ""diner"" - you can get your breakfast classics, varied specials, as well as their own custom concoctions (Charleston Shrimp & Grits, Holy Davoli burger, etc.).  Check out their menu online if you're curious.

My fave right now is still the corned beef hash breakfast.  They roast the corned beef there themselves, and it's just fantastic - savory, juicy, everything it should be.

First of all, service here is superb.  The server never left us with empty cups and the manager even touched tables which I believe its important.  

We ordered the shrimp and grits and the chicken and waffles.  It came out fast, maybe around 10 minutes.   The portions are huge!! Price is around $15 for entrees.  So presentation was beautiful.  The chicken was crispy and so were the waffles.  It comes with a hot sauce syrup that the server makes to order in front of you.  I suggest you try tobasco with syrup instead.  I liked that combo! The waffle also comes with a strawberry butter which was tasty.  The chicken was nice and crispy but i think the fryer oil needed a change because it was dark and i could taste the difference.  I used to fry chicken everyday at work and I know when the oil is bad.  But it was good!  The shrimp and grits were also delicious.  The grits are not the loose kind, its actually a grits cake.  The shrimp was not rubbery at all.  

We spent a total of $40 for our meals with drinks.  We will be returning for french toast and crab cakes next time.",SyX94Qkpowm_9dsn1SDrCQ,1,2,4,CkpILUcOi4BJkxiZE9v0fw
4530306,2018-03-03,0,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,"This is our go-to breakfast spot in Vegas and we're here just about every weekend despite the fact that we live in CA. It's the hubb's favorite because 'they've perfected hash browns' (wth?!) - gotta love my simple guy but his take just doesn't do this place justice.  They've got unique menu options and specials that you just don't find at other places (check their menu out & you'll see what I mean), especially diners, and their portions are HUGE!  

Their chicken & waffles is absolutely scrumptious!!! Not only is it too much to consume in a single sitting, more importantly, it surprisingly rivals Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in So Cal (which is a favorite & must for me when in So Cal), but for different reasons. That homemade strawberry butter is HEAVEN on fluffy waffles; coupled with their unique mustard brined something or other juicy fried chicken - it's the perfect combo of sweet & salty but not too salty (yes mustard, which I avoid & was skeptical about - but it doesn't taste mustardy & gives it its own unique flavor).  And I didn't even add OR NEED TO add the sweet & spicy sauce that comes with it (I don't do condiments or spicy...I know I know, what a bland existence).

For a healthier option, their avocado toast is refreshing chunky avocado spread with fresh tomato quarters on multigrain toast - simple, light yet tasty as well as filling. It inspired me to make it at home, which for some reason is only a close second.

Or if you're lucky enough to order it & breakfast desert is your thing (like my son) - try the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes. Sweet mother of tastebuds!! Delicious & fluffy buttery pancake sweetness with crunchy caramel walnut overload!!

Everything sounds & looks good from their menu, I want to try to all but have so enjoyed what I've ordered in the past, it's hard not to order those items again.  Maybe one of these days we'll actually try their lunch or dinner options.

This place is popular & fills up fast but they're great about getting you seated & served quickly, and they have an outdoor patio with heaters as well. Service has always been excellent with the manager making his rounds just to check on you. Your server takes your order on an iPad & sends it right to the cook while standing in front of you - how's that for fast?  An when you're ready to pay, you do so with your server again through the iPad - super fast & convenient.

My not-so-perfect comments/observations:

1. Yes, the ladies bathroom is a bit messy (not gross or nasty though) more often than not; and

2. On my last visit I was seated facing the cooks. I couldn't help but notice & wonder why the cook wasn't wearing a hair net despite having a really great fro. I kept wondering if I should be checking my food for hair when I receive it (I have long curly hair & know for a fact curly hair falls out like you wouldn't believe). Note to manager: he's got a really great fro but please make him wear a hair net so I don't need to counsel myself. Thank you. Keep serving up deliciousness.

There was a short wait about 10 mins but it wasn't a big deal, we got seated and our drink order was taken efficiently. The hostess explained the run down, they have a black board with daily specials that change each day from featured menu items to drink options. 

Their menu is actually quite the expansive one! There was so many choices it kinda gets hard to choose what you want! 

Our server was nice and helped us through the menu, what their more popular items are and since we were seated in an area that wasn't visible to the blackboard he told us what the featured items were. 

We took a minute or two to figure out what we wanted. We finally decided on ordering chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy and the corned beef hash with poached eggs. 

Though the place was busy, our server was attentive and he had great customer service! He was easy to talk to and was funny! 

It did take a while to get our food which would be the only down side to our experience but I have to say it was worth the wait!! 

Once our food arrived our server checked on us and made sure everything was good. I loved that the manager made an effort to go to each table to ensure their experience was to the best of their ability!

We totally found metro diner on accident and it was one of the best food finds we had all week. It worked out because we didn't want to be stuck eating strip food or buffet. We went in for breakfast and had a basic eggs and hash browns breakfast with a side of biscuits and gravy because we never get that at home. We were so impressed with the food quality and customer service we decided to return every day for breakfast, trying something new each time. 

On our second day of breakfast with some yo halla halla and croissant French toast we were even more impressed, our wonderful server told us that it was a chain and started in Jacksonville. Which made us super happy being from the east coast. After looking on the website we found a location an hour away from home ok the east coast. 

This place had the best breakfast and customer service and we look forward to visiting the ones on the east coast!!!",Yi5BxmlOg5N4l87FPFSTXg,0,0,5,enMfsnFIclnTd9Wzfg129w

Came in because I wanted fish & chips, so this was the nearest place to my house that served it. Totally fell for the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. If you come here without trying the chicken waffles, did you really try Metro Diner? Lol! The chicken was so good and satisfying. The crunchy skin and the flavor was just all there. Plus, the strawberry butter went well with the meal. (Of course I asked for extra haha) Make sure they make their special sauce for any chicken dish, which is basically the syrup and Louisiana hot sauce mixed together. 
The other dish we got was the SMOTHERED CHICKEN, which is on their daily special. It was okay (not as good as the chicken and waffles). It's chicken tenders smothered in melted cheese with some sautéed veggies. 

The service: our server was so funny! & knowledgeable. I think his name was Philip. But he helped us with picking our order and he was so attentive

I mean really, less then 6 people in the whole restaurant and they can't get the order right? Oh that might be because the cook is leaning over chatting with the server and I assume the manager.
When a customer sees that and then gets half of what they ordered !  And then when the other half finally arrives ( meanwhile you have just about finished the first half because it took so long ) so the 2nd half arrives and WHAMO it's wrong!!  Maybe the cook should spend more time cooking and less time chatting with the help! Maybe!
I would give zero stars if possible. I will say I was here in the afternoon last week for the first time and it was good fast and everything came cooked at the same time so I thought I would give breakfast a shot BIG MISTAKE.

Even the extremely reasonable 25 minute wait for Sunday brunch was enjoyable in their outdoor space equipped with complimentary coffee.

Gone is the faulty pen-and-pad method of yesteryear. The wait staff here are equipped with iPads that send orders directly to the kitchen. From our seats, we could see behind the counter where the kitchen operated like smooth, Swiss-engineered clockwork. Our food came out hot, fresh, and faster than we could have expected. I highly recommend the pound cake French Toast--but as dessert, rather than an entree!

The meal itself was sublime: delicious diner food, made with fresh ingredients and in generous portions. The service, however, is where Metro really shines. Though the restaurant was packed, we were greeted, seated, and fed in record time. Even our water glasses were kept magically full as if by wonderful, friendly diner fairies.

We've all been to restaurants where servers cater only to their designated sections, and felt ignored when we need help but nobody nearby was assigned to us. Not so at Metro Diner. Every employee who passed by our table here stopped to ask how we were doing, and seemed genuinely interested in the answer.

Metro Diner gives their employees the flexibility to take care of guests instead of following rigid, micromanaged procedures--which can feel insincere and inefficient. When the server dropping off our food realized we had made a sub (home fries instead of hash browns), she brought a replacement in under three minutes, without having to consult the server who took our order, get approval from a manager, or otherwise jump through hoops to make things right.

I don't have a single complaint. Metro Diner exceeded my expectations in every way. Bravo!",E8o8NcJRgixpWCVobXwzmw,3,3,5,nX2agX_OtGMy9NNFdvJ6zQ

This was my first time at this location. Our server Summer was really great! She had a great personality. I was a little taken back because the restaurant was a little grimy. I guess on the website it's says they will always open the door. We walked in and the hostess was involved in something else, not a customer. To sit us she takes us to a booth by the bathroom, which I didn't like. There 
were others tables available. The booth had not been cleaned and the floor was very slippery. I asked if we could sit somewhere else and she sat us in the front at a table we had passed earlier. This one not too clean either. The food was good but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth. Not sure if I would go back to this location.  They need to get it together!

It's not about being fancy, or necessarily upscale. Metro is about serving good, regular food. I just wish it was open 24 hours & would serve disco fries.  Ok, those are fries with BROWN gravy & melted mozzarella:)
Metro serves up piping hot generous portions and at lighting speed.  Another thing one can bank on is friendly and fast service!  They have pretty damn good coffee, plain or choice of hazelnut.  Nope, no blue plastic creamer containers for the hazelnut- the hazelnut has its own pot of coffee! Insert clapping hand emojis please.  I built my own omelet, and it was cooked perfectly with my choice of sautéed onions, asparagus, mushrooms and melted Swiss.  Excellent, neat and plated oh so nicely. 
I did keep eyeing other people's choices (dishes, yes I eyed all dishes leaving that kitchen)!  Next time, that apple French toast with almonds is

We were never asked if everything was ok - nada - zippo.  The girl came by as she was dropping drinks off at another table and dropped off our check.  Never asked us if everything was ok - if we wanted anything else - didn't notice we left half our meal

Bold City Burger - Of course couldn't finish it but it was full of flavor. What's crazy is it was a lot better as a leftover cause all the flavors had time to sync in with each other.

The place had to be at capacity but the staff was still some of the happiest I have ever seen. After a 5 minute wait (super impressive considering the amount pf people in there) we were seated and our server, Dario. He immediately asked us how our day was and then gave us a rundown of the daily specials and other notable notable items on the menu. We walked in hungry but after he gave his salivating descriptions, we were starving. Everything, literally everything sounded so good! We ended up going with the 3 egg breakfast and the chicken and waffles, which Dario mentioned was one of the best things on the menu.  Before the food came out, Dario presented me with a dipping sauce that is their own kind of special sauce. It was a mix of maple syrup and Louisiana hot sauce. Despite my insistence that it was not going to be a good mix, he told me to give it a try. When the food came out i was in awe. We paid about $25 for all of the food and got TONS OF FOOD. Ive never seen a better deal! On top of that the food tasted amazing! The chicken, which Dario told us was marinated for 48 hours, was amazing and tasted even better with the syrup/hot sauce concoction. The waffles were topped with a sort of strawberry butter that had small pieces of diced strawberries in it. Again I was blown away by the flavor. The 3 egg breakfast looked like it had at least 4 eggs in it and included toast, hash browns, AND sausage patties. Most places only give you one or the other but this was all of the above for the same price. Impressive. Last but not least. The decor and vibe of this place was awesome. It has an open kitchen with a bar you can sit at and does a good job being crowded, while also feeling spacious. If you are a local, I definitely recommend you try this place over alternatives such as Cracked Egg or Egg Works. I like those places but Metro Diner is KILLING them in every category.

After I placed my order I was on yelp reading the rest of the reviews. I came across one review that commented that there waitress left the check on the table while they were still eating. About two minutes after the food made it to the table our waitress came by and put the check on the table and said that we could add dessert to it or just keep it the way it is. Our waitresses name was Darla G. Otherwise she was very knowledgeable on the menu items and how they are made and had new drinks on our table the minute we needed them without even having to be asked. So the reason for four stars instead of five is the check on the table cause I think it's a little bit rude. Makes me think of the back of my head that she's never going to come back and check on us.

 I have to  be honest, I gave this place an extra star because of the server we had, Tim :) He was such a cool guy and anyone that loves brunch more so than breakfast and hates runny  eggs is A-ok in my  book. Aside from that everyone here was very  attentive from the bus boys to the manager himself.  

The place is always busy, but the service is fast and  food comes out hot. I had the huevos rancheros plate (about $10)  which could of fed a small family and my  friend had the corned beef hash (also  around $10). My food was very  yummy and his seemed to  be good as well, but the beef in the corned beef was the minced kind (like hamburger) and  not the shredded  corned  beef which I preferred.

I would definitely come back here!

5744900,2018-05-15,0,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,Came back in today for dinner.  Staff was great.  Greeted with a warm smile and my server was awesome and explained the specials and menu well and suggested the beef dip.  He recommended the Beef dip sandwich which my husband ordered with a side of macaroni and cheese.  My husbands beef dip sandwich was all fatty and very chewey.  He sent it back and opted for the chicken dinner which was ten times better.  I ordered the meat loaf which was kind of flavorless and it seemed the portion was much smaller then what I saw on diners drive ins and dives.  I guess I have to go to Florida to get the full treatment.  They took a lot off the menu like the stuffed blueberry French toast and the Pittsburgh sandwich.  :(. Wish they would bring them back on the menu.  For $41 dollars I guess i just expected the food to completely wow me and not still be hungry when we left.  With that being said next time I think I will try the breakfast instead of the dinner.  Maybe portions are bigger and breakfast will be on point because dinner was just okay.  Service was exceptionally better than yesterday.  Wish I would of got the young mans name and the hostess today was also very nice.  Will return one day for breakfast.,zOB3UWrQveoPZ0EHgvV7-w,0,0,3,UAk2jZJ081TJZ9BUYebIMg
5768893,2018-06-05,0,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,"Went here on the 25th of May, we had family in Town and they wanted to try it out. I wrote a review about our disturbing experience here 7 months ago and i didn't want to discourage them from eating here so we just decided to have dinner here. We are a party of 9 and we were seated promptly for a Friday night. It was about 730pm and the restaurant seemed only a third full. Bottom line, this place needs to train servers when it comes to customer service. Our server gave us attitude, didn't check on us, had no service and gave us another bad experience. If you are looking for a sit down place where you and your family can enjoy a nice meal, then this is not the place. Maybe this is why there are a lot of businesses that are doing the cafeteria style dining,  where you get in line and place your order on a machine and pay it right then and there. Hopefully this place gets better. Food was good except the fried chicken was way too salty.",ZgIEFwFhwGs4fwXNlFn-vA,0,0,2,yPnVAWWE0Fg8lyD--c4S2Q
5776394,2018-01-26,0,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,"The server was nice therefore it's the only reason I'm giving any stars.

For the food itself: I had the Meatloaf and my wife had the Cajun Pasta. The meatloaf had a mushy consistency on the inside and I wasn't sure if it was under cooked. The outside with the slight sear tasted decent. It came with mashed potatoes that were tasty. 

The Cajun Pasta was terrible. It looked like they threw in shredded bits of chicken and some stale brown sauce that was extremely over salted and was inedible. Even the Pasta was over cooked and soggy. However, The server was kind enough to notice and the manager took it off the bill.

I was really hoping this could be a go to diner spot for me since it's relatively close by and in a convenient location, but unfortunately I don't think I'll be coming back.",IPtstZHY8AECWU9TQmWJeg,1,1,2,crpaREnAU85-F_mtcMhSOg
5792918,2017-07-27,0,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,"Ok, ya' all...I can tell you that this lovely diner is a must!
I really could have given this new place 5 stars.

When me and my husband walked in for lunch, we were greeted right away. And the place was buzzing...It is a breakfast, lunch and dinner all of the time kind if place. The greeting was lovely and the service was exceptional throughout! 
The food coming out of the kitchen looked ridiculously amazing...And, there is a menu, that is crazy looking delicious. 
You may want to check out their fried chicken something (waffles, dinner, etc.). Or The, Hash and/ eggs benedict. Hash browns are crispy and look super delicious.

So, what happened with us was that my husband ordered the fish and chips. And I Had the specialty Pastrami with egg on top sandwich. (That was an amazing sandwich with fresh baked bread.  However, I think, Metro Diner missed the mark with the Fish and Chips because they used the Suewi fish(sp) instead of a traditional bass or halibut. Maybe catfish.  I had a taste and thought it was too mushy and a bit muddy for this dish!  

However, the manager came by really prompt and was  gracious and personable. 
Otherwise, you bet! Give this place a try.....I think you all would love it! Great Job Metro Diner!

I decided to give it one more try...we went there tonight and the service was awful.  I  wanted pasta they only have one pasta dish so I tried it...it was actually sauce with little pasta.  My husband's burger was well done instead if medium....why ask if your going to serve it the way you they want to....The server didn't ask if we needed anything no refills no ketchup no mustard...she came back another time to give us our check...then we waited another five minutes before my husband went  to find her so we can pay...I still tipped the twenty percent because I too work...but I'd like to get food that I would have enjoyed after working all day.

5837852,2017-11-07,3,gHq85iAANw1eIOVzkzRrpg,"I've dined here twice now, and have generally liked what I have tried at this diner that opens early but also closes fairly early to offset the near sunrise start (7:00 a.m. -- 8:00 p.m. Sun. through Thurs.;  7:00 a.m. --- 9:00 p.m. Fri. and Sat.).  A Salisbury Steak special of the day was savory and covered with tasty Brown Gravy.  A Brooklynn's Greek Salad featured Kalamata Olives, Feta Cheese, cucumbers, zucchini, Roma tomatoes, hard boiled egg, croutons, Red Onions, pepperoncini, carrot shavings, Iceberg Lettuce, and an authentic Greek Dressing.  The Chicken Pot Pie (I ordered a large, and was glad that I did) was very good, with a creamy inside and golden dough outside.  And unusually dark-skinned but moist Fried Chicken was excellent.

Service here has been attentive, with a managerial tableside visit each time to check on how things went.  And ambiance is deli casual, with basic but functional furniture.  The focus is squarely placed on well-prepared comfort food.

The food is good and taste great. Don't be fooled by the plate size. I tried the meatloaf and it didn't look it was going to fill me up but it did. The gravy is good and the vegetables were amazing!... the tables are a bit small if you have a big group or kids in high chairs (we had 2). The service isn't bad but I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 cause I believe the prices are a little high for what you get.,9DjBlq3Z0msqzQ9dZJAJmg,0,0,4,FDhLVP5B2iWNGeoGygt6UA

Ordered pastrami on rye with the homemade chips and the pork tenderloin sandwich with french fries.

The pork tenderloin sandwich was breaded but served with a bunch of other stuff far from what you get in the Midwest which is more of a basic plain sandwich.  Served on a Texas toast type bun the sandwich was ok.  Fries seemed to lack salt but an abundance of black pepper.

Overall it's just an average spot. Nice staff but food seemed average. May try it again and try something different next time

The first time I visited, I got a burger with mac and cheese with it. Deliciously sinful filled with flavorful seasoning along with it. Along with that, the texture from all ingredients made it a delicious meal. At the same time, my girlfriend got the Philly Cheese Sandwich to which she was very happy about. The buns were just right with a generous amount of meat along with it. A must try. 

The second time we visited, I got their famous meatloaf to which delivers in taste. Wow. I've never been a huge fan of such an entree but I've changed my mind. Along with its sides like the mashed potatoes and vegetables, it was an amazing meal over all. This is not and overstatement, you have to order their meatloaf. My girlfriend, on the other hand, got the hashed corned beef with a side of two poached eggs. Wow. Pair the two together and it heightens the entree. Definitely a must try as well. 

My favorite from my visits there are their amazing cobblers. Topped with a classically-made ice cream and this dessert is the epitome of all sweets.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,6,3,5,U7riwjbzMQ_qTU1kB7w4zA
