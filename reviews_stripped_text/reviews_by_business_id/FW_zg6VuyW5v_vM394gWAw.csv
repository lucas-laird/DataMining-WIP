1527052,2014-08-03,1,FW_zg6VuyW5v_vM394gWAw,"This was my first time at this location. I did not know Upper Crust Pizza went away.

I wanted the chicken fingers, but they did not come with french fries. Fries separately are an extra $3.00. Not that I am a cheapskate, but not trying to pay $15.00 or more on lunch.

So, I ordered the student special - 2 cheese pizza slices and a drink for $4.50 as the sign says. I paid $5.95. I didn't argue, but I feel that was a dollar too much?

Anyway, I am a native Long Islander. I can make pizza. I was not very impressed with the cheese pizza. It was okay...nothing that will win award, but it was not inedible. I have had better pizza at the Red Rock Station buffet. 

Will I go back? If someone else is buying & this is their choice, I will eat there. It would not be a place I myself would say ""Hey family - let's go to Rocco's"".

Tried this place for dinner and I was ready to not like it. I wasn't crazy about the pizza joint that was previously here and I typically don't like super thin crust type pizza. my wife told me they have a special on Mondays where you can get a large cheese pizza for around $10 so we ordered one. Inside was busy with customers and there were plenty of staff on hand to get everybody taken care of. The only downside is that they only have about 5 tables inside and since they were filled with customers eating side it left us customers waiting for take out orders huddled together which was awkward. The inside is narrow so there isn't much space when it's busy. 

I ended up liking the pizza. It was thin, not too greasy, and had the right amount of cheese and sauce. I can't say I'd pay the regular $12.99 cost for it however with a coupon or a promotion like we got this time it's a good deal. I came back a couple days later for lunch and picked up a couple slices of cheese and a drink for around $6 including tax. The pizza was hot and just as good as a couple days before. The only thing I don't get is why it doesn't come in a take out box? The 2 slices were on a thin paper plate inside a brown paper bag. I wasn't just getting lunch for myself but my wife too and trying to carry it all out plus 2 sodas was effing ridiculous. I like the specials they have and look forward to trying some of the other menu items however if it doesn't come in a proper take out box it might make me not want to come back as often since I wont want to risk dropping all the food trying to carry it to the car.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,10,9,4,machEZAKO9dxGr62419yGw

We had fried calamari, French fries, garlic knots, and a half plain/half margherita pizza. 

Fried calamari barely had a crust, it was more of a skin. No crunch, all chew, and if it wasn't for my hot lemons I don't think I could have chewed all that frozen squid. It looked more baked then fried. Change the name to Baked Calamari.

The French fries were average frozen fries, little soggy, no crisp. 

The bread balls, I mean garlic knots, were misshaped baked bread. Not buttery and had no garlic, parm cheese or parsley for anything close to be related to NY pizza (I only lived there for 21 years). Add some salt and it's closer to a NY Pretzel. 

And finally, the pizza. The crust was awful. Like a sheet of paper. It was so thin it kept falling apart because the sauce was like a glue to the cheese and just ripped the crust. The cheese was the cheese you eat at Chuckie Cheeses. And the sauce. I would say it was closer to a sweet tomato jam. And I got to eat all of this cold food and dipping my baked calamari, soggy frozen French fries, and bread balls in this same jam! More like Rocco's frozen food & sandwich, jam & cheese shop. 

And if you don't know what NY pizza is suppose to taste like, go to the hidden Pizza shop at the Cosmopolitan btwn the Sushi Place and Jaleo. It's the closest thing to NY pizza that I have had in Vegas and still is not that close to real NY pizza and also expensive but worth it.",4PH-kLFOZmmiNvgz_bjaxw,4,2,1,54jMlc7F_9HYtDwOXHtb2Q

Two White slices were huge, the ricotta was sweet and well distributed and oddly, the thicker crust was more properly charred than on aforementioned pie. Pizza guy was courteous, pie was ready in a timely fashion.

Pretty good pizza, though not Chicago style = my favorite.  The fist time I ordered a sausage pizza from Rocco's, I thought it was ham.  I tried ordering sausage again and it was the same. Apparently, the thin sausage slices they use remind me more of ham, and are not very flavorful.  I hope Rocco's changes their sausage because I really do enjoy the other components of their pizza.

While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a ""slice special"" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special.

We used to refer everyone here because of the customer service and home like feel you would get here. Not necessarily because the food was excellent  The value of the specials and convenience for shuttling kids between multiple activities in this area made it a win. 

The last few months the owner has been there way too much and his whole demeanor towards customers is like he is being put out, he's rude, unhelpful, and has lost touch with what customer service is all about. 

I called ahead for a small order -- slice of pizza cut In half or double cut and some small side salads. I know lunch time is busy and I had a tight schedule today and needed to pick up and run. 

First he tells me he will take the order then when he hears it he just tells me to come in and grab, and tells me his is busy. Well we are all busy Sir and that is why I called ahead.  We used to eat in every week and see lots of people pick up small orders. After I convince him to take the order I ask him if he minds splitting the salads in two containers cuz it's going to kids at a venue. I get it he's busy and it's a lot of work to use two containers instead of one but then he whines more about what I asked for. Seriously? A three min job of doing a mom a small task is too overwhelming for you? 

I was just going to not show but that is rude and I don't waste so I go in to pick up the order and give this guy with a bad attitude a chance to recover  his long term customer and I tell him how frustrated I am with it and he snaps at me, tells me I am wrong and that he doesn't need my business and won't let me pay for my child's lunch. 

Now he has made my child's lunch late, was obnoxious in front of other customers and he can't even apologize. What a narcissist! Add to that how you publicly addressed a woman, def not acceptable behaviors!

Well since you don't need my business I will take with it my swim team, charitable orgs that I ask to use you, dance team and every other referral that we have given to you so kindly which I have never asked for anything in return. 

Thank you for the lesson in customer service I will def view my own customers at my own small businesses small requests with much more relevance and make sure I don't show up as you did as a business owner. It was disgraceful. 

As far as the food quality goes it has gone down, last three weeks we have ordered meals they aren't cooked or cheese even melted, and the side salads like caprese and cucumber/tomato which they used to take pride in being fresh are not what they used to be and often old that we have to ask for fresh. The pizza guys behind the counter are still nice when he's not there. 

My suggestion is to skip this place and go elsewhere. You can find other small businesses that will feed you with a smile and appreciate your loyalty and the money you spend at them.",d4CFNGvU_JR7PlcJyhcplQ,0,0,1,7UXvdQ5850uQOzI-ilLY1w

They charged us for a pizza we didn't order. 
They gave us the wrong Pizza.
We called and mentioned the mistake around 9:45 and they said to come by in 20 minutes to pick up another one, but when we got there they were closed. 

They never told us they close in 15 min. 

I called the next day in regards to this matter and they hung up on me. Then they ignored my calls. When they finally picked up the phone they acted like a big bunch of jerks saying they assume everyone should know the close at 10 in the local neighborhood. It's a business law to state your hours anytime you communicate with customers over the phone and we are not from the area. 

I would not recommend their service and will be reporting their behavior to the Better Business Bureau. They treated us in the worst manner possible.",evmbwM7bUey786L0_zbqaA,0,0,1,qhzo3_-HJpQElGAEI-84lA

There was no mustard or Mayo that I had requested but that could have been due to my friend not asking for it.... Also very little tomato to moisten ...She told me it had oil and vinegar but there was barely enough on the bread to moisten the turkey I had to add a ton of mustard and mayo myself just to give the sandwich some moisture... The bread was perfect- nice and crusty but I would never serve that turkey to anyone. It was completely over cooked and dried out.,nEHK5Wkl_jWzKR5WwlITYA,0,0,1,STRsU0CV5_YE36i96gGv7A
