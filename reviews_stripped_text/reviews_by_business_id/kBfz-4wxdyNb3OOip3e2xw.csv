Waitresses are incompetent at best, evil at worst and they treat To Go customers like dirt!  FYI -  I was a twice a week regular customer.  

 Been in LV for a year and this was my favorite Japanese restaurant for quite a while - then they changed management and Wow - rude rude rude.  Customer is NOT always right - customer is always wrong.  Girls cannot speak English but are taking your order over the phone - finally finish ordering and ask her how long (since it just took me 10-15 minutes to order), she says 15 to 20 minutes, they are very busy - so I say well please get my order in right away - she then goes into another long disertation (???) about how long it will take - I say that's fine just put my order in right away - again blah blah blah.  So now I am sitting in front of the restaurant (drove all the way there while ordering and she is still going on and on about how busy they are - their are 3 tables and NO ONE at the sushi bar.  I ask the sushi man if he has gotten my order and he says NO.  Mind you, now there are 2 sushi men just standing there with their arms crossed and my order was, you guessed it, sushi!  He says he will make it right away - 5 minutes later we are standing there waiting for one of 2 waitresses to take the money - meanwhile the waitresses are going around to the few tables involving the whole restaurant in this conversation about how rude I am.  Then the waitress who finally takes the money says (loud enough for all to hear), ""you are a trouble maker, always complaining and we don't want to serve you!!!!  A customer then comes up and says ""the customer is always right"".  Bottomline, I paid $16.16 to be abused and lied to, all because I wanted my order given to the sushi man ASAP.  Plus they drove all the customers that were in the restaurant out by taking their argument to them (?).  

Too bad, food is usually good and the Sushi Men are super nice - but the waitstaff are the slowest, rudest, non-english or japanese speaking ever!",lrCZpOpV3GqCRSbNkJj3gg,1,1,1,skhUxUq-a4p7dcygVAWS7g

I am remorseful about writing this review about what was a couple years ago, my favorite sushi place for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas.

But damn, wait till I tell you how badly my last experience there sucked.

Got there at 6PM, we were the only people in the restaurant except for two sushi chefs and hostess.

We ordered a few rolls, and waited 25 minutes before we saw the first one.

Then the rolls came out every fifteen minutes after we ordered them.

And they were the tiniest rolls I have ever seen, and filled with a comical amount of rice, and almost no fish!!!!!!

Our dinner basically consisted of an hour and a half of waiting around, punctuated by an occasional sushi roll every 15 minutes that was so crappy it was worthy of conversation for another 15 minutes.

For the same money, I would go to sushi mon, osaka, or sushi loca.

2762041,2009-12-12,1,kBfz-4wxdyNb3OOip3e2xw,"Being new to the area, I've been out scouting local sushi bars, and this one's only a block from home so I thought I'd give it a try. It's a tiny little place tucked into the far corner of a strip mall. You could drive by it every day and never know it was there.

And honestly, I think I would just keep on driving. I stopped in for lunch on Saturday and there was only one other couple there. So you would think that would equal good service, but no, not even close. I hadn't even had a chance to sit down and take off my coat before the waitress was asking for my drink order. I decided on the AYCE sushi for $23.95.

My sushi chef was mostly non-communicative and never even tried to strike up a conversation, even though I was his only customer. The sushi was about average although they tend to go heavy on the sauces which I hate. I had the volcano roll, which was a mess of mayo and fake crab slathered on top of California rolls. Luckily this was the last item I ordered so I didn't feel bad leaving most of it uneaten.

Aside from the lackluster sushi, my major complaint was with the owner. During my meal, she was yelling at her employees and a supplier about an order. She was loud, rude and quite a bitch. I'm thankful she's not my boss, and I'm thankful there are much better sushi restaurants out there.",bkJRLZ9yANhJI6iRU3k4VQ,1,1,2,LiM2YeDCjzY4i3GqpNlI1g

3014190,2010-12-24,3,kBfz-4wxdyNb3OOip3e2xw,"Have you ever spat out your sushi? I did.

Sushi on Summerlin had some potential.  it has a unique location, there isn't any wait for a table, and they seemed to have good specials.  Unfortunately, I now know why the specials are so low--the quality of the fish isn't as good as it should be.  

When we walked in there was a couple in the far corner eating dinner, and the sushi chefs were standing behind the counter watching football on tv.  The one server brought us menus and took our drink orders as we sat ourselves at the counter.  We decided to do the usual sushi test--order the regular items that anyone would order anywhere else and compare it.  This is how it went:

Maguro:  I spat it out.  I couldn't help myself.  The moment it hit my tongue I tasted that rotten fish taste from lack of proper refrigeration.  I hid it in the napkin and moved on.

Snapper: It was okay but it was very bland and the rice wasn't even seasoned.  They just threw rice in the cooker and took it out to use it.  I never use soy sauce with sushi, and I had to with this order.

Tempura: nope.  Nope.  Noooooooo.  It was done all wrong, came out burnt (look at the photo I posted) and was flavorless.  Their sauce was just brown liquid. 

After the experience there, we exited the restaurant and immediately headed to our regular spot to get that bad taste out of our mouths.  Luckily we did.  

If you are looking for a sushi bar to go to around this area, please steer clear of this place.  I never return to restaurants that give me the gift of diarrhea, and I suggest you don't risk it.  Don't take any single opinion to heart, but if you read the other RECENT comments and they pretty much say the same thing, you may want to take it as a big hint.

Sushi on Summerlin, if I could remove the star I provided on this review today, I certainly would.  You do not deserve it.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,5,1,1,QfsJplc7eEyfMv9BctcKNw
3915156,2012-03-12,0,kBfz-4wxdyNb3OOip3e2xw,"Very surprised by the low rating of this restaurant.  I kept getting flyers in the mail advertising their 2pm-5pm ""happy hour"" with $20 AYCE sushi, and have been meaning to try it.  Went there yesterday with minutes to 5pm, and enjoyed my meal immensely.  It wasn't the BEST ayce place in Vegas, but it was definitely one of the cheapest.  The chefs there were friendly, too.  All that said, this was shaping up to be at least a 4* review.

The problem is that after I sat down and started ordering, and had some edamame and they were already preparing my food... I was told they would not be giving me the happy hour price.  Supposedly their cash register turns off the happy hour prices at 5pm, so if you arrived at 4:15pm and spent an hour there, apparently you'd end up getting charged the dinner price once you paid.  Very deceptive, and I was not happy as I would have gone somewhere closer had I known it wasn't ""seated by 5pm"" but was rather ""paid by 5pm.""

I will be back, next time probably at 3:30pm, so I can enjoy my meal for the price they advertise.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,4,0,3,cMuBA-8YwOAfAldLg7-o-Q
4060143,2007-09-10,0,kBfz-4wxdyNb3OOip3e2xw,"Best All-You-Can-Eat Sushi in Vegas!!

My friends from Vegas have been raving about this Sushi joint for months now and I finally got to see what the hype is all about.  If you are craving for sushi and sake, this is the place to be at.

As we walked through the door, we were greeted by the whole sushi chef staff in Japanese and were soon greeted by Mikey, our host, server and bartender.  All-You-Can-Eat-Sushi is available all day. Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $29.95 (i think).  We were there for lunch and you can order basically everything from the lunch menu.  Add another $10 and you can consume all the sake you want! Yes, that's all-you-can-DRINK sake with your all-you-can-eat Sushi which makes it a very dangerous combination.

Unlike most all-you-can-eat sushi joints in vegas, this place doesn't regulate their 45 min limit rule and they don't force you to eat all your left over rice. Their sushi is super fresh and they offer plenty of specialty rolls.  You also have to try their pineapple infused sake...so smooth and pineappley....and a creeper!  Great idea for our next get-together at our place.

Best highlights of our experience:
1.  Fried Shrimp Heads: Crunchy and tasty!!!
2.  Pineapple Infused Sake
3.  Favorite Specialy Rolls: Double-D Roll and Mikey's Roll
4.  Mikey our waiter was super cool because he kept the sake jar full.  Even had a shot with us.

Must visit this place next time I'm in Vegas.  A short 10 minute drive off the strip and you will totally get your money's worth and more.

I brought my daughter here at her request and spent $62 on all you can eat when there was nothing that I wanted to eat after tasting the first bite. The first thing I ordered was a California hand roll for my daughter and a volcano roll for myself. Her roll came as a cut roll, which I asked them to take back since she is 7 and doesn't eat a whole lot. My volcano roll which used to be the best roll they had, came out as nasty, disgusting, gritty mush with some rice and eel sauce thrown on top. I literally spit it out when I tasted it. I left the nasty mush on the plate and was secretly daring them to question me about it. I then ordered a mexican roll which used to be so tasty with shredded crab and shrimp in a spicy mayo with avocado. Ugh again there was the appalling crab/grit mush in it. After the crab fiasco I decided to start ordering Nigiri. The yellow-tail was simply unrecognizable. It looked nothing like yellow tail, yet when I questioned the sushi chef he assured me it was. Ick! I ordered cajun albacore and was able to enjoy it a little since the ponzu sauce drowned out the not-so-fresh fish taste.

""Spicy Shrimp Tempura"" cut roll. I get this all the time...everytime.
Sometimes have 'em add cream cheese.

I miss one of the sushi chef's that used to work there. He knew my order as soon as I walked in the door!
