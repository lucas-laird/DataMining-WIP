The meat was really good, not frozen. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised! You really have to try it to believe it. It's the type of gourmet burger you'd find at a fancy restaurant like Cheesecake Factory, for instance! Not a cheap burger, but worth it. I will have it every time I drop by The Venetian. :)

Located in The Venetian food court.",W0UyJVdWcQQpy0BT-NHUtQ,1,0,4,4eys1FoGnn3slOkHe-Ufbg
1104957,2016-06-30,1,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"To be honest, i didnt have high expectations before eating at this place. It was 1 am and San Gennaro was one of two restaurants that were open 24 hours at the Food Court at Venetian. I ordered Cheeseburger and Freshcut fries. Waited about 10 minutes and buzzer started to buzz. Suprisingly, cheeseburger was very tasty. Patty seemed and tasted like the one in Shake shack. I like the burgers which gives you the feeling of a healthy burger. This one was one of those. They put cheese, thousand island, tomato , lettuce and onions inside. Bun could have been tastier but still good. Fries were really fresh as they advertised. Burger fries and drink cost 20 bucks. And it deserves.",uFfcik3eYwXh1Vko8E8DWA,1,0,5,l7LUWc57ggr4JBdD9IPbnw

They didn't start making the darn thing until about 20 minutes after my order.  The cheese steak itself is nothing better than what you'd get at a subway or Quiznos.  It's just a bit more--understandably it's inside the Venetian.  Just walk a few more minutes and go to Chipotle or some places on the strip.",F0_ie6WdHFqopRBf9QoEfQ,0,0,1,k-2Mopl3kI1GKXimFlfcdg

1532874,2015-09-15,0,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"This place was a good quick breakfast spot at 2am.  They put milk in their eggs so I couldn't have an omelette but the food was good.  Can't really go wrong with breakfast!  The staff was nice with helping me inquire about food allergies.  Pricing not bad when compared to surrounding places.  Seating is in a general food court style and this area is right near the casino floor.  I loved that I was staying at the Venetian, took a nap around 10:30pm, woke up at 1am, wanted breakfast and walked right downstairs to get some :)",w61S1fhkF1t_5EPyYS506g,1,1,4,y9YnRxQ0s_d9quD3QzBAGg
2145058,2017-07-14,0,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"Wow, don't waste your time, even if for drunk or late night food. Seriously, there are tons better options in Vegas that you can take advantage of, and even if it's too late to go to most, just go down the street 0.2 miles to McDonald's.

The sandwich here was underwhelming at best and smaller than my pinky, yet priced like it was the premiere menu item at the next big cafe. The Grand Lux Cafe right nearby in the Venetian had cheaper and way better sandwiches. That makes zero sense.

Purchasing food here was worse than losing the same money in the casino. Just don't.",yxEZbIFnJXXeZiTHl7KldQ,0,0,1,4ZXM1hArzUDbx8lnR6FOmQ
2653023,2015-02-17,0,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"The burgers here are really good, as well as huge. The prices are a bit high, but for it being inside of the Venetian hotel, it's not too bad. The chili cheese fries were absolutely delicious, one of the best I have tried. They are sold separate from the burger but they are absolutely worth it. Sometimes, they'll have Krispy Kreme donuts, or other pastries available. The customer service was really good, most of the employees spoke both Spanish, and English, and for the amount of people eating, they were pretty fast! I would definitely recommend it and will visit whenever I come back to Vegas.",ZIdgmZ-JeENI-JS3zhHs_g,0,1,5,QGktuBCEUGOF1JjWFLhSoA

Tasty with a bit of seasoning. Tomato was a bit mushy but this is a food court in February. Service was quick. Fries were crispy but not piping hot. I'm splitting hairs a bit. I'll come back.",xe-NSASzolbpIMdR_PprNw,0,0,3,8-e77r7GpZVeAzf8sI9H_w

Definitely don't recommend it whatsoever. Not much to say other than that. I think they're sandwiches might be better but it's supposed to be a burger joint, you would think they'd have better burgers.",TIp9kHzG9bbjwI4bIHffUg,0,0,2,hpUnHFZNu-QtQ6ta2kORWQ

They have a good size menu of different fast food type items and we have tried a few and loved them all. You can grab some food and take to your room, or there is seating there.

The service is very fast and friendly. You will like it, and it worth the 11$ for a cheeseburger because they are great, and convenient.

4150062,2014-11-17,0,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"Saw the reviews, and based on that, I thought I was in for a burger delight! Unfortunately, it was not to be. The burgers were extremely greasy and overwhelmingly unflavorful. We came here on the night of the Rock and Roll marathon so the streets were all blocked and traffic was a nightmare.  So we were mostly isolated to the hotel and I decided not to fight traffic and try this place in the Venetian food court. They got my $37 for two burgers fries and a beer. I should have wrestled through the traffic to get a real burger from In N Out and save about $10-$15.",MCNSEMtULCIMOr_Z84T81Q,0,0,1,aoFm-rw88WctcEVU9ryw7Q

Reasonably priced for the area, in the food court inside the Venetian.  Plenty of seating, and no wait after 1am mid-week.

Can't comment on the burgers, but the fries were so YUM!!!",lGj7s42BJx_Xg7ZgaO_dmA,13,8,5,LLBR0pPzzz2bPtYOv2aBcw
4660312,2015-06-19,0,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"Pretty pricey. Burger and fries costs almost $20 but for a fast meal in the casino it's an okay option when it's over 111 degrees outside!

Located off the Venetian casino floor in the food court it's one of several food stalls. Not anything special but they menu looked safe and the food looked and smelled good so it's worth a try.

Overall three stars based on location and convenience. .",BkWkf3QXlBdPEhJOmYflkw,1,0,3,UnMlsS4GSkA9uhPFobinEw
4777960,2017-05-13,0,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"This place was unexpectedly delicious. I didn't have high expectations for my meal here, as I felt that the only option open around 4-5 am in the Venetian food court must not be that great. I thought to myself, ""These burgers are kinda expensive for a food court. This place is totally gouging people still up late at night with some major drunchies (like myself)...ugh."" 

However, during my three night stay at the Venetian, I came here three times at night for a late night/early morning snack. Yup. Every. Single. Night. It was that good! I haven't had Five Guys before, but my boyfriend commented that it reminded him of them. Even though paying $11 for a cheeseburger that doesn't come with fries was pricey, it was totally worth it. My cheeseburger was extremely filling and the thousand island sauce they put on it absolutely killed it. The burger patty itself was thick and seasoned well. The veggies were also fresh and the tomato was shockingly bursting with flavor. The fries here are also impressive. They're seasoned well and crispy. Pro tip - The colossal fries (with cheese, bacon, and onions) are huge. My boyfriend and I ordered a cheeseburger each and shared these fries and couldn't finish it, even though we're huge eaters trying to soak up our cocktails! 

P.S. - The breakfast here isn't worth it. My boyfriend ordered one of the late night breakfast omelets and it was scrawny. I've made better omelettes at home.",I6mR0j4LsPIOhvOV-nIRSg,1,1,5,kdQfzrLPQvADkdX03_aP4w

5046773,2015-09-30,5,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"Besides the bitchy bad attitude from the cashier, everything tasted amazing! I ordered the cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce, and cheese fries. 

I wanted to use my employee canal shoppes discount and she freaked out because I didn't have my badge, which I was totally okay with! She snarled at me and was like WHATEVER NEXT TIME JUST BRING IT, when I didn't even argue back! :(

The place is a bit overpriced, but the food is pretty decent. The line wasn't too long. The burger was cooked fresh in plain view, juicy and hot when delivered. The cheese fries were made perfectly and didn't taste processed. The fries were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside so definitely 5/5 for food. 

The location sucks because it's loud and smokey... but what can I say, it is a food court inside the venetian.",c2MQ_LPuvtiiKFR_-OY9pg,6,4,3,eEE6nfoNcLZcw6awYifDlA
5131809,2015-02-04,1,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"Came here on a Saturday night for drunchies and you know how that works-- typically 2-star food tastes like 5 stars and typically 3-star food tastes like the best thing you've ever had in the world? Yeaaaaaaa no.

For two burgers and a large fries, we paid a whopping $37 (wut). It was incredibly bland and I had to dip it in ketchup at every bite. Plus, it wasn't very filling. After finishing his burger and a majority of the fries, my boyfriend went next door to get a slice of pizza.

I would suggest walking a bit more to Grand Lux for slightly better food or head down to the better food court by the grand canal shopped to get some late night munchies. 

This burger joint is meant for the slot-machine players who need convenience, not taste nor quality.",Tyb_FnUv3L0LqsYyL8FIAQ,0,0,1,vtyOr8mmgQwsIuPfKX_PBA

5905792,2015-08-23,0,AVtNuwwdgWWm2CZqRe5pKQ,"So.... I wanted a burger today. NOT coming back here again! This place is extremely over priced. 

Anyhow, I had 2 punch cards. One card had 4 stamps and my other had 1 stamp. I was told that I could combine THEIR cards in the past so that is what I did. They told me that it was a first time for everything. They said that they NEVER combine their own cards, that the card itself has to be full. What?!?! This makes zero sense! How hard it is to stamp the old one and hand me back the new one. Then to top it off they took the employee discount away! Than, the cashier Martha as well as the employees and manager had the nerve to talk about me in front of my face! They were saying how I was wrong, how I didn't know what I was talking about. Proceeded to say nasty things about me in Spanish! I wanted a refund and wanted to leave so badly! I should have left. 

San Gennaro, you lost a customer! Trust me, I will tell my friends and they will tell theirs! You aren't that good and I won't be coming back! There are other places in Venetian that cost less, have better meat and their customer service is 5 star like yours should be too! Maybe you should send your employees out to learn a thing or two!!!",6I6DIjwiFEXfseDwToI4bA,1,0,1,T8T-_IEelgNlRhNnQf3jmw
