We ate there but I requested it ""to go"" because we usually have leftovers. The lady taking my order was happy to accommodate. You order at the counter, they give you a number, and they bring it out to you. The Crispy Chicken Mayo Bowl was a generous serving; plenty for lunch the next day. The Crunchy Dragon Roll was very good also. On this particular afternoon, the service was a bit slow but we were not in a hurry. The ladies were apologetic. I also liked their demeanor. I felt welcomed and valued as a customer. There are plenty of dishes on the menu that look very good. Looking forward to trying more.",aTl9sD-HRP8mwTn5vd4PXQ,0,0,4,2VQps4-PJmFtO2C7Z2cF0w

If you want omega-3s, opt for sushi; if you want protein, get a rice bowl; and vegetarians have a few options, too. And if you're on a budget, they have lunch specials $6-9 until 3PM.

 I come for the sushi, and get one of their riceless rolls. Frankly, I'm surprised they have any (given the name), but you're limited to three options: volcano (fried roll, which I don't do), cucumber crush (spicy), or cucumber island (favorite). Almost all special rolls are a flat $9, or they have a lunch with two basic rolls for the same price.

They have menus on the outside of the restaurant so you can just grab one and go. The menu is really simple offering many different types of sushi rolls and ""jumping rice"" aka fried rice. 

I had decided to get some to go for the familia - I got the pineapple fried rice (thai style), dynamite rice, and teriyaki chicken over white rice. The pineapple fried rice was alright - it lacked alot of flavor and something was just missing. After a couple bites, the boyfriend and I decided to pass it on to my dad..haha My dad had gotten the dynamite rice - this is basically the dynamite roll over more white rice. My dad said it was overly cheesy and he needed to drink alot of beer to help wash it down. I had gotten the teriyaki chicken, and it wasn't anything special. It was literally just some grilled chicken over white rice - $9 is a little too steep for something so simple. The portions were big and the service was great, but we weren't too impressed with the food. 

Next time, I plan on getting the kimchi jumping rice and some of their rolls. It's korean owned ( you can tell the moment you walk into the restaurant ) so i'm thinking the kimchi fried rice and rolls should be good for next time.

It was a rice bowl entree called the ""Fishing Bowl"" was described to have tuna, super white tuna, salmon, albacore, red snapper, tamago, and sweet shrimp with sushi rice. The description made my mouth water. It was basically a sushi lovers dream all in one bowl!!!! The price was about $18 and some change. 

When I ordered, the cashier asked if it was to go or to dine in. I replied that we were going to dine in. We sat anywhere we wanted. The tables and chairs were modern and so was atmosphere.

The wait for the food took about 15-20 min. Which was a little long for something simple to make, considering everything is raw sashimi. But as I received my bowl. It was worth the wait!

Originally,  I was looking for a place that serve bibimbaap,  but found out that K-Bop closed, which lead me to here.  I was very upset that I had to substitute my craving for something else other than bibimbaap.  

So,  I went in and found out you order at the counter first before you sit yourself.   Server ""A"" asked if it's my first time,  I told her yes.  I ordered a teriyaki bowl,  baked mussels,  and water.  I sat down and received a small appetizer sample, which was good.  I then received my mussels,  which was made with kewpie mayo, which was delicious.  Then came the teriyaki bowl...

So,  the teriyaki bowl was drowned in teriyaki sauce! Drowned I tell you!  The teriyaki steak had its own swimming pool of teriyaki sauce!   As an Asian,  you don't drown your rice in teriyaki sauce ... Actually,  you don't drown your rice,  period!  So,  I took a few bites and couldn't eat it anymore.  

I asked server ""B"" if I could have a container and a side of rice to go because I didn't like the drowned rice. She tells me this: ""Next time tell us to put the sauce on the side.""  ( haah?) I told her I did not know because it's my first time.  Then she says ""ok. I do this one time for you.""  It really didn't sound all that mean, but a bit on the rude side.  

Anyways,  I will go back and adjust my review as needed. It deserves another shot.",4tVcD5mDy63PfbKrnOOJrA,2,1,3,CLdxTV6Fr8uGIrJXVrlUkw

Walked in, greeted right away very friendly staff. Their menu is great there's variety and the food seemed amazing until we got our food. We dined in and receive our food in styrofoam plates and plastic containers. There was an employee sitting next to us eating in a nice bowl and was just confused really. We got the lunch special so it came with miso soup and salad that were also in plastic containers. The soup was less than halfway filled in the cup wtf? I ordered a chicken cutlet bowl that was $9 and is the lowest quality food I've ever eaten for the price that it is. The portioning is good but quality isn't there. I 15/10 don't recommend this place. The employees were also arguing about workplace drama that was very good entertainment. Go to other Asian joints the price would be the same or lower with much better quality. Big disappointment and I wish success for the business.",5v_O63BD31feF11wm9oT5A,0,0,1,pvgdzUunaUYICtsG0GzthQ

I started coming here last year and I have never been disappointed. They have a good amount of sushi rolls and a variety of bowls and rice plates. When you walk in you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table when it is ready. It isn't too busy and the food doesn't take long to cook. My personal favorite is the chicken jumping rice. If you go during lunch I believe it comes with miso soup or salad (but that could've changed). They have other options such as steak and shrimp. The jumping rice is essentially fried rice with your choice of meat. It has amazing flavor and they give you a lot! So you better be ready to carb up and hit leg day! I also tried their Teri chicken bowl and they are generous with the chicken! If you're on a diet try their sashimi salad. It's amazing! The sashimi tastes fresh and they give you nice cuts.

At first thinking about the name sounds rather corny or catchy so had no expectations. What I did find was reasonable price korean/japanese food for lunch. Interior design that really nice really modern (reminded me little bit of Yonaka) look not just plain walls and feel like in more upscale restaurant. The menu is pretty straight forward with your standard sushi rolls, nigiri, sides/appetizers. The star of the show for me was the jumping rice section. Maybe jumping for the spicy level not that all of them are spicy. Each one comes with your selection of protein for the Indonesia Jumping Rice had choice of chicken, shrimp, or think beef was the third option. I opted for the chicken. I wanted too try more of the menu since it was my first time went with Calamari Tempura. 

The Calamari Tempura was awesome. The thing stood out most is the calamari was not  ring cuts of squid but nice whole piece not thin either. So the inside was nothing but calamari bliss. You had the tempura batter that was so on point. It was flaky, nice even coating all around, and most of all not greasy. On the inside nice thicker cut of calamari cooked perfect, lightly seasoned, and moist. Dipping sauce brought it all together. Great first course.

I had the Indonesia Jumping Rice. Forgot too mention not only protein get choice of rice from white, jasmine, or brown rice. Jumping Rice & Rolls does have some healthy options on the menu. The rice I was surprise at the portion size.  I thought was good size. You added the protein again nice size portion talk about full lunch. Yay!  

No doubt plan on coming back trying more of the Jumping Rice section. Kim Chee fried rice is my favorite kind and few more fried rices that want too try. The sushi not sure about but the pictures looking good. No doubt for me it all about the fried rice next visit and probably the next one and so forth.

She got the crab fried rice and I got the pork belly fried rice. The pork belly in jasmine rice was really good, I only wish it was crispy for texture, but the flavor was on point. I don't like crab much, so I was not too fond of the crab pieces in her rice.

A bonus is that they have refillable fountain drinks!

I don't think I would be down to try any of their sushi rolls, not because I don't think they're good, but I would just much rather have AYCE, which isn't an option here.

Portion wise, you could probably split it between two people for a lighter lunch. 

The salmon skin salad was pretty good, but different from most places I've been to. Instead of being on a bed of seaweed, it's just normal iceberg salad. The dressing was tasty though and the skin was cooked well.

I had driven by this place many times, and honestly the reason I didn't go in was because it gave me the impression of a place with too much carbs. I went in for lunch because a friend suggested it and didn't want to say no. I'm glad to say I was blown away!! The servers are really accommodating. You can tell the quality of the food is high and the price is low. Nothing on their menu is over $9 and their lunch specials are $7. They have sushi although I didn't not have the sushi. Absolutely the best fried rice in Vegas. They make it fresh and give you the option of white or brown rice, the cucumber salad was delicious and topped with crab flakes. I assumed it was imitation crab and when I asked I was surprised when the server said it was real crab. I'm looking forward to experimenting more of their menu.",fqvk3zRgL-zFcQAVdTkqxw,0,0,5,aNxRQ3NDuOBOVbwEXaFYjg

You order at the counter and a server brings your food when it's ready.  You also get a cup for iced tea and you serve yourself.  The sign out front said 7 days a week lunch specials but I didn't find anything especially appealing nor of good value.  I don't order sushi at places like this.  I prefer nigiri to rolls.  I ordered their crispy chicken mayo bowl with jasmine rice (you have a choice of white, brown, or jasmine rice.)  The rice comes with deep fried chicken, shredded egg, mayo, and sweet soy sauce.

While waiting, I got my iced tea.  I found it strange the cashier didn't know if they had unsweetened tea.  They actually have one of the 4 variety pick of iced teas next to their Coke machine.

In a short time, a runner brought my chicken mayo bowl.  The chicken was crispy and the squeezed mayo gave it a good taste.  My favorite part was the egg in the rice.

The meal was OK--something different--but I don't see myself returning here except to try one other bowl that's listed as spicy.  maybe I can get them to up their spice level when I go.  The place is worth a try!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,19,15,3,eHMdvRi0feWahTZpkYkD_Q

I can take $7 and go to sushi mon or Naka and get 2 hand rolls for that price. I'm not much a stickler but cmon. 

Let's get to it then. The food is pretty goood, chicken cutlet might be the best around this town. There rolls are pretty pricey, but it's how this place makes that mulla.

The crab rice was awesome, but it's basically fried rice with crab - snow crab plus big chunks of what looks like soft shelled crab.  Very tasty and enough for a meal. Personally though I need more variety.  I guess you could go family style and share everything, but this is not where I would go for lunch for one or two.  The noodles are also tasty.  The sushi rolls are all ala carte priced so one roll is like $10 each. It's a good portion, but if you are hungry bring a wad of cash because it's not cheap.  The staff is really friendly and service is very quick.  I might go again and up this place one star, but for now I rank it A-OK 3 stars.  Oh and the poke salad is not really traditional poke it's like poke combined with seaweed salad.  Very good and worth the $10 based on the portion size.  

My only other comments concerns the format.  They have sushi bar quality sushi, but no sushi bar.  You order at the counter like fast food.  I would have expected lower prices for this type of service.  They bring your food to the table, but you order at the counter.  Also the name does not really explain what this place is all about.  I have great hopes for this place, but I sort of wonder if they are still working on the menu and dining format.  It has the feel of fast food, but the food is like what you get at a sit-down full service place.  Anyway it is good and worth a try.

Sashimi salad: tuna, super white tuna, salmon, and albacore with mixed greens. All of the fish was super fresh and the salad dressing was perfect. Some places put way too much dressing but I like to enjoy the flavor of the raw fish. 5/5

Rolling #5 roll: shrimp tempura, spicy soft shell crab, and cucumber on the inside. Spicy soft shell crab also on the outside. On top, there was tuna, albacore, shrimp, and red snapper. It comes with a spicy mayo ponzu sauce which I LOVED. I drenched my rolls in that sauce. Sooo good. 5/5

Best shrimp tempura in town! Finished the 3 shrimps on the way home! They could use a bit of change on the sweet sauce that comes with it for a more homemade authentic sauce but no matter shrimp was light, crispy and fluffy as tempura should be! 
Next I had the screaming O...perfection to flavor and taste! For a fast food the tuna is very fresh, well season, not spicy & delicious! I was impressed ! Finished the whole thing. 

I was hungry so I also ordered the soft shell crab with rice (crab jumping rice)
Delicious ! Very well cooked almost gourmet! A little less oil on the rice and a sauce for the crab and you would think you are at a great sushi restaurant !!

New and clean. Counter Service. 2 Asian gals in charge at the counter.  Based on their recommendation, I ordered the spicy basil fried rice (jumping rice) with chicken. The portion was a good size but for $12 I think it should be. I'm not sure that I've ever paid $12 for chicken basil fried rice even at a trendy Thai restaurant in San Francisco.

I think the flavor was great albeit spicy (so not for everyone). It includes finely chopped fresh veggies, and large and smaller pieces of chicken, basil and many chili peppers (that I picked out and did not eat because there was plenty of spice going, no need to eat them). I ate about 1/3. But got to, and bit into, a large piece of chicken, that was not cooked all the way through. I spit it out. I used my fork to cut into another large piece. It wasn't cooked through either. The smaller pieces were though. I ate those. I took the remaining rice to go. I did not complain, because I knew when I warmed it up for a snack later, the chicken pieces would cook through. I ate leftovers later that evening. After 60 seconds in microwave, all was good.

I can say it was outstanding for the price of $10. I also ordered the salmon Pok√© for $9. Both entrees were good and had plenty leftover to take home which was a plus.,w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,0,1,4,ZWD01gzw3Q9U1Ul2dRrD1Q

When you stay to eat they bring you nice dishes. Everything I've ordered so far has been delicious. I got the crab noodle bowl last time and miso soup. So filling. This time I got the screaming O salad and a California roll. All very good. 

Only negative thing is that the girls at the counter could be a little more friendly. They don't say much.",nVaEKWMYWVGdJKsSx0Bb_Q,0,0,4,DjBp6K1qI2o7kJLc5utIag

She was so overwhelmed that it took forever to get our food out. By the time it reached us, the chicken mayo bowl was cold.

The food comes in a box that resembles a microwave dinner box...and that's basically what it tastes like, in terms of flavor and quality. I had a spicy bowl, which I guess was spicy...somewhat...and...well, I can't say much more about it. It was...a meal. Meat, onions and rice. It came with a little bit of miso soup and a salad with ginger sauce and not-very-appealing lettuce. I guess this is what they call fusion? It's vaguely Korean. A fusion of Korean and garbage. Without anything good from Korean cuisine. So it's garbagean. Emphasis on garbage.

Honestly, I've had tastier and higher quality meals that I've heated in my microwave.

On the plus side, the serving size is large, and...well, that's about all I can say in terms of positives.

This place was found thanks to wonderful Yelp reviews. 
This place seemed clean and had a nice decor. The girl behind the counter was sweet and attentive. The menu had so many choices, it took my Wife and I about 15 min to make a decision. 
I ordered a spider roll and a rice bowl w pork belly (yeah, now I have your attention). The spider roll was HUGE, nicely presented and very tasty. The rice bowl was also a HUGE portion, it was a rd under seasoned which was fixes w/ a nice drizzle of siracha. 
My wife ordered a Philly roll and a middle bowl w chicken. The roll was big and loaded w salmon, the noodle bowl was also a big portion. 
Bc  we were unaware of the portion sizes we also ordered some gyoza to share as an app. After woofing them down, then each of our rolls, we barely made a dent in our main dishes, not to worry, we brought them home and had them for dinner. 

Great place, service, food and prices.

I actually came here on a second date trying to convince this person that Asian food is good.   This was his first time having miso soup and he vowed to never eat it again.   Yikes!   But honestly if it were my first time I'd not eat it again either.  The flavor was off like there was something rotten in it and it wasn't hot when we got it.   There were also items floating around inside that I did not recognize. 

The rest of the meal was ok.  I got a salmon skin salad.   It was seriously salty and there was so much dressing.   It was hard to get through. 

The restaurant itself was a little sad looking.  It was dirty and the lighting was bad.   It felt a little like being in a scary movie. 

The reason it doesn't get 1 star is the ladies who work there are very friendly and nice.

Overall, it was very tasty, particularly the crab rice and sashimi salad. The rice was full of shredded snow crab and abundant friedsoftshell on  top. The salad was topped with plenty of colorful assorted fish (8), and the ponzu dressing was refreshing and flavorful.
