Ordered two meals for my wife and myself and was informed the soda fountain wasn't working (after we had paid). We each had iced tea instead.Halfway through eating we tried to get refills on our beverages and were told we would have to purchase new drinks because refills are free for soda only. I tried to reason with the employee and then the manager that we only accepted iced tea as a substitute for soda because they were unable to deliver the drinks we had purchased but was met with rote company policy and a general air of ""if you don't like it, don' eat here"".

1753231,2017-01-12,0,MQlJrXuMAkTtWQQU_nszLQ,"The other reviews were pretty spot on. 
For drive-thru, you'd be better off just ordering inside. Ordered the 4 for $4 and the worker took my order perfectly and when I eventually made it to the pickup window, they gave me the right order. 
Reasoning behind the 2/5 star rating would be the time factor and the food overall.
Can't get much wrong with the 4 for $4 deal, but the fries were not only unfortunately undercooked, but incredibly salty. It shouldn't sound like raindrops when you remove the salt from ONE single fry. I get it, they use sea salt, but it's never been to this extent. 

If you can, I'd say drive the extra miles for a different location. I'm usually down to give each place two tries, but if it's a fast food chain, shouldn't be the case.

I've been to this location quite a few times and recently have had to deal with a very rude lady at drive through. I believe she is SUPPOSED to be in a management role but is clearly unqualified. She always has a terrible attitude, rushes you through every part of your experience and is just overall unpleasant. My coworkers had actually stopped coming to this location because of her. Today I came to the drive through on my lunch break and ordered a cheeseburger combo for myself and a cheeseburger for my coworker. While ordering I asked that one burger not have veggies on it to which this rude person said ""what?!"" I started saying I didn't want pickles, lettuce, tomatoes etc since it seemed like she hadn't heard me. However she cut me of and rudely said ""yes, I know what veggies are thank you."" I've worked in the service industry so I know how to talk to people, I was not speaking in any sort of tone or sounding condescending, simply just trying to order food. Her attitude and choice of words was unwarranted and certainly NOT how patrons should be spoken to. At the window all she told me was what my total was and that my receipt was in the bag. No thank you, no have a nice day, no is there anything else you need. I took my food and left but was even further disappointed once I got back to work to eat when I found she had not given me a straw, my fries were cold and soggy and MY BURGER HAD VEGGIES ON IT.

I recently have become addicted to the chili cheese fries. 

You can't beat there value menu with so many tasty options.

They regularly send coupons in the mail and all of them or worth using.

No chili sauce. No spoon to eat the chili. No straw for the drink. No napkins to wipe hands with. Did get ketchup for the fries, but didn't eat them because they were colder than the ice in my drink.

With that said, I've been to the drive thru at this Wendy's location several times over the past year, and each time they've gotten my order correct and out to me in a timely manner.  Their 4 for $4 is by far way better than the other FF joints that tried to copy Wendy's afterwards.  The employees have been courtesy, maybe sometimes overworked, but for the most part... all have decent attitudes.  If you're looking for organic and health eats along with 5 star service, go else where and pay 3-4 times more than what you pay at Wendy's, B-K, or Micky D's.
