Much as I love Fat Boy's pineapple-packing Hawaiian burger, or a good Fatburger on the char (always order on the char), Freddy's hits the sweet spot for me in price, distance, consistency, and drink selection (I like Wild Cherry Pepsi; your own mileage may vary). I can say that some days are better than others, but overall it gets my highest marks. I very much love the maillard crusting along the skirt of the thin double patties; it's good proof that you don't need a flame grill to make a great burger.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,0,1,5,Jq8OsOTmnv0OUpYIQ4wVrQ

Custard was pretty good, think it's something that I'll have to get used to.

Now to my favorite item, the chili cheese fries, they're awesome.  Great tasting chili with nacho cheese sauce on the top of some shoestring fries. Could eat just those for a meal, great portion size.

In a twist of burger irony, we tried to eat at In-N-Out burger on Easter Sunday night  around 6pm, but they were closed. So we headed for Freddy's because burgers and fries were calling our name.  The California burger has a sauce similar to thousand island dressing - which is my favorite burger.  The fries are shoestring style.  

If you don't want too many fries, then share a plate.  Each burger comes with a gazillion fries - you can easily save money by sharing one order. The kids meals also come with a gazillion fries, so skip the kids meal and just order a  solo burger and share your fries with the kiddos!

I don't know why people compare In-N-Out to the likes of shake shack, five guys, etc. I think those are unfair comparisons because In-N-Out is much cheaper than those places. However, I truly believe that Freddy's is the best direct comparison because of the price point of the burgers and the staff is just as friendly.

As for food, I usually get the California style single steakburger with grilled onions and fries or upgrade to onion rings for a little bit more. The burger is as good as in-n-out or better, but the fries are hands down better! The onion rings are really good too (and that's not something In-N-Out has)!

A Steak Burger is suppose to be 
But the Star of the show is The Turtle Shake 
Even if you just order Shake its worth the trip 

Customer Service is awesome 
Good alternative to In & Out

My husband and I drove by on our way to the Nike Factory and I freaked out a little bit cause well, custard. After shopping, we walked in and ordered one vanilla frozen custard and fries, not knowing the amazingness that is Freddy's. I kid you not, my first bite into the custard and my eyes lit up. I immediately gave my husband a spoonful for him to try, same reaction. Long story short, he bought another custard and ended up giving it to me cause I loved it so much. also. Shoestring fries are my absolute favorite soo there's that too. The staff are so friendly and helpful, it's super clean, and I LOVE the vibe of the dining room.

I was surprised to see a drive-thru! then again... this is Vegas! how awesome is that!  but I'm not lazy, I like to take my time when I can and enjoy what I paid for! lol!!!

As far as the food went:  YUM-O!  I love the lil fries and to top it off that crazy sauce!!! lol  the fries had MY right amount of salt! (I'm downing lots of water tonight! lol)  so, if you don't like too much salt, hey! mention it!!  you'll get fresh fries I bet!
the steak burger single was what I ordered. it was just right for me, but now I know when I come back hungry: double it plz!!  I got all but the onions... usually I don't do the pickles... but I figured, why not!  and boy did that make a yummy difference! it was snappy!  I like the clean counter access of big humongous over size foster family size ketchup to top my burger any which way possible!!! :-)  lol!!  

I like the variety a lot! Since I am cutting back on my splurging, I didn't try the custard... but! that means another reason to go back!  momma always said, ice cream never goes bad in the winter, I'm assuming that goes for Custard!

Second the steak burger is quite amazing I leave it original and love my fries crispy. The fries my just be my favorite they are thin and crispy and not greasy. I also like their hot dogs they are amazing I can't even describe.

1352527,2018-01-26,0,hojZyJk1Wf2UE2CpG7cgIg,"Came here for the first time by recommendation by a coworker. We couldn't think of what to eat and he came up with this place. Located right across from Krispy Kreme in the huge Target Plaza on Silverado Ranch & Eastern, next to Freed's Bakery. 

They offer a drive-thru option, which was what i picked. The idea of steakburgers reminds me of Steak & Shake in South Point Casino & Hotel. Thin, flat-topped cooked burger patties and shoestring fries. Made my car smell very yummy ! 

The fries, you actually get quite the bit. Both orders were full to the brim and falling out into the bag. Lightly seasoned and salted. Pretty yummy ! Quite similar to what you'd get from Steak & Shake, but much more in quantity

They don't have a lot of burger options but they are fairly simple burgers, without all the fluff. No chili cheese or guacamole or BBQ sauce. Only simple original single/double/triple, bacon and cheese, California style, and patty melt

We had ordered a Double Steakburger California Style which includes two steakburger patties, cheese, full slice of onion, Freddy's sauce, lettuce, and tomato served on a toasted bun. 

Overall a fairly simple burger with the normal fixings. Lettuce was chopped up vs the usual leaf of lettuce you'd usually see. A full slice of onion is not a ring or two of onion, but literally a centimeter cross section of an onion with all the rings it inside. Patties are pressed quite flat with cheese in between. Not sure what Freddy's sauce is as I couldn't really taste where/what it was. 

Can't compare to the nearby places like Red Robin or In-n-Out or Shake Steak. Completely different. Closest thing is Steak & Shake and i find it quite comparable to each other. Great to have another place that offers steakburgers outside of South Point. Much more easily accessible. It is a pretty decent size burger in comparison to what you'd get in Steak & Shake. Prices are comparable, if not better pricing than Steak & Shake.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,2,4,a1dO3ffx0jvSWuYudj4zwA

It's hard to describe them, I would say the best way is if you took a steak, chopped it up very fine with a knife, and somehow were able to put it back all together. It's not the greatest description so you will have to go there and find out for yourself. The meat itself could have used a tad more seasoning. Shoestring fries were perfectly cooked. Thin and crispy, again, just a little bit more seasoning. All the employees were very friendly and even the manager came out to see if everything was OK, I liked that.

I am still at heart, an in-n-out fan, with Five guys coming in at a close 2nd. Freddy's has only one location in the entire Las Vegas. It just happens to be down the street from my dentist. I got the #7. which is a double steakburger with bacon. unlike Five guys, in-n-out or even smashburger, their burgers are pressed, flattened sort to speak.  It was good, but i prefer my burgers thick and meaty.the flavors were right and overall it was a good burger. The service was fast, the place was really nice. It was busy, i dont know if it is because this was the only location in town, or because the area is just really busy. They serve shoe string fries, really thin, with very light seasoning. different, but good.. but nothing amazing. The highlight was probably  their custard. Again, not too sweet, and they had fry sauce. which was basically a thousand island with a little less zing, not bland, but mild.

When the manager handed me the bag of food, she also handed me 2 complimentary coupons for 2 future combos and apologized for the delay. I was impressed. That's not all. I got all the way home, only to find that I had two grilled cheese sandwiches in my bag instead of cheeseburgers. 
I called the store, and came back to make the exchange. The same manager, her name is 'Heaven', was clearly mortified of this second error, not to mention the people who got my cheeseburgers won't be happy either.

The patty melt was good, and I enjoyed the super skinny fries.  Ice tea seemed fresh as well.  Kids ordered a mini sundae and concrete.  My husband kept announcing the price with surprise each time we added another item - it really was quite funny.  In the end, after three hamburger meals, a chicken tender meal (regular), and two mini desserts we spent $43.  I guess that's a bit higher than most other fast food joints.  What surprised me was the price of the mini desserts ($3.50 each) - guess I don't get out much.

Ambiance - Whole area surrounding Freddy's looks new, from the repaved blacktop in the parking lot to the modern stylized 50's diner interior of the building which used to house Fazolis. The dining area is pretty spacious,airy,open ceilings. There is also a drive thru, didnt see any cars go thru during my visit. So FYI there is drive-thru service Yelpers. BTW the address is listed wrong..should be 9809 (see my photo) 

Service - Hard workers!!! Minute you walk into the place you are greeted by smiling faces eager to help you. In fact one of the employees saw us walking up from the parking lot and opened the door and greeted us. For being so new it was nice to see staff was confident when giving descriptions of their menu items. You place, pay and pick up your order at the counter when your number is called. Our wait time was less than 3 minutes.  Tables were cleaned up pretty quick.  Eagle eyed workers also came around and continuely cleared our table as soon as dirty napkin,empty straw wrapper hit the table...no kidding! 

Food -  Ordered their Orig Freddy's Dbl Steakburger which was their plain burger just pickles are on it..cheese was xtra.   If you want the lettuce, tomatoes whole bit upgrade to the Cali Burger . We also got Chili Cheese fries  to share and the Mr. got the Triple burger + a hot dog combo.  Our order came to $20 for all  food and drinks! 
 Everything was cooked to order,  so food was still hot when we sat down to eat.

The burger patties are pretty lean, no greasy oozing out mess here. They are smashed thin so the texture of the edges were pretty  brown & crisp on the outer part and cooked well done inside.  They're evenly seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic.(that's what my tastes buds detected)  The bun was buttered and toasted. If you're a big eater the portions might be small for you, but it was perfect for me, it satisfied my red meat craving and  I didnt feel guilty ""super sizing"" it to a double burger.

The fries were the shoestring variety, still hot and still crisp with all the chili and velveta like cheese poured on it.  Their chili is a tad salty for my taste.  Mr. B said the hot dog was okay, I thought the buttered Texas toast was a different and cool take for a hot dog bun.  

The custard I ordered was a Vanilla concrete, similar to DQBlizzard. I dont get why it's called a ""concrete"" though, I was thinking it was going to be served up as brick..lol  The custard concrete is like a real thick ice cream but more dense, creamier..and felt very  rich & fattening ..the mixin I chose was caramel.  The custard was good but I only had a few spoonfuls since I was stuffed as it was.(so note.. order it to go next time) .  

Overall we enjoyed our meal, food was good, service great! I will probably choose this place over 5G's for my go to fast food burger joint when in the area because the prices are more reasonable and Freddy's got the custard!!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,6,3,4,EANdJadhBeA3Jqp_EKQMrg

I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.

Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car.

However, Freddy's has earned their own category.

The frozen custard alone is worth the trip! 
There is nothing that comes close to the richness and creamy texture of their frozen treats.
The shakes come with with a straw big enough to launch a cashew through (when you are done drinking).

PLUS, they have hot dogs and Philly steak sandwiches too. 
If you order a burger, make sure to get a double or triple. 
The single patty burgers are great for the little ones.

They have a lot to offer and a lot of potential, but there could be some improvements.  I had their cheese burger which was good, but not anything special necessarily. Reminded me of In-n-out because they also have their own sauce. If someone I'm with wants to eat there I'd have no problem with that, but I don't think I'll necessarily go back just for myself.

Something to note if you do go: they have a horrible line area.  We got lucky and seemed to go during a lull, but about 3 minutes after we got there the line got incredibly long and it was uncomfortable because people didn't know where to stand, it was kind of funny.  Also, there are WAAAYYY too many workers walking around and standing idly.  It made it super awkward when my family and I were trying to eat and every few minutes someone asked us how our meal is..not gonna lie but in 3 minutes nothing is going to change from our answer haha And at that point we were kind of wondering if they're going to have that many workers why don't they bring us our food instead of calling numbers and we go up and get it?

The best part is the concretes. You now have to specifically ask for whip cream and only the first topping is free. And on my last trip, they didn't even mix it up. There was a bunch of heath toffee at the bottom with a bunch of vanilla custard sitting on top of it. Poor form. But at least they do have a slew of toppings and mix-ins to choose from. And the custard is tasty.

The Chicago hot dog is fine. It tastes like a hot dog. Nothing special. But it's a safe bet.

The fries are shoestring fries, which are enjoyable. They are usually always cooked just right too.

The burgers are ok. Kinda meh. I ordered a double California. The toppings were of poor quality. Wilting lettuce. Can pickles go bad? I think these were bad. Why is the tomato and onion so icky? Something went wrong here. And the California burger was supposed to include 1000 island dressing. There was absolutely none on the burger. There were, though, two sauce cups of some sort of bleh ketchup and mayo combo. So was that the 1000 island dressing? Or was it fry sauce? Was it both? Either way, it was a rip off.

So, in sum, the concretes are usually worth it (perhaps you now need to request they mix-in the mix-in?). But the non-dessert items aren't really worth it. And it's way overpriced. I spent $15 on a combo meal (burger, fries, and small drink) and small concrete. Not worth it.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,0,0,3,GxD5K_HouaZp9yksvo0f3g

Yes, that is my main attraction - FRY SAUCE! Love the stuff. I agree with the Yelpers that say it is like Steak N Shake, also with the Yelpers who say the burgers are a bit dry. Since I dunk every bite in the FRY SAUCE, I really don't care. Their onion rings have been outstanding. (Dipped in FRY SAUCE), perfectly golden brown and crunchy just the right size for soaking in...yeah, you got it, and beautifully crunchy.

Kudos on having more than one diet drink, though I wish it were Diet Mountain Dew rather than Diet Dr. Pepper.

Their burgers were mighty tasty.  You can order singles, doubles, and triples.  As originals (pickles, onion, cheese and mustard), in California style (onion, tomato, lettuce, cheese, and thousand island sauce), or however which way you wanted it.  Just expect it to be a little messy when you eat it.  I've had the Double Steakburger California style and the Original Double Patty Melt both very very delicious.  Not a fan of shoestring fries but they were well made.  It should be more of a topping added to the burger and piled with fry sauce that's at least how I do it.

It gets incredibly packed during lunch, good luck finding a seat.  A bunch of us from work came here and we ended up seating at random table that freed up.  We probably sat at 4 different tables scattered throughout the dining area.  There are a lot of seats but it just gets busy.  They do have a drive thru. I don't like their booths they are long and can fit a bunch of people but everyone has to get out for if the person closest to the wall needs to get out.  Because it gets busy during lunch, this one time they must have mopped but didn't place those caution signs and I slipped but didn't fall.  I was holding the food tray and my food was sliding freely on my tray.  Try balancing your food on a tray while not falling on but sliding all over the place on a slippery surface.

The bread on the melt was some herbed variety that I found more jarring than harmonious. The fries are shoestring fries dusted in seasoning. It was a generous amount of fries. They did give me ranch without having me pay for it, but it was warm from a box. Good thing it was loaded with preservatives.

I know people have a cult mentality for this chain, but it didn't feel it. I'd return to try a concrete. I guess I imagined a messy drippy burger.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,3,1,3,idFFcpoUeMZqF-2JV8PvyQ

Truth be told, I overate tonight. I wanted to stop midway through my meal, but it was too damned good.

I love all kinds of burgers! Sliders, turkey burgers, green chile burgers, and of course steak burgers. Freddy's has perfected the steak burger-sorry Steak n' Shake. I chose the Double Steakburger (California Style), which consisted of 2 patties,cheese, lettuce, tomato, and a thousand island sauce on a soft delicious bun ($7.29 for the combo). Wow! The burger was so juicy and tasty on it's own, I didn't even need anything else to go with it. 

However, the burger came with a pile of shoestring french fries that were seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly.I never eat all of my fries as I usually save my room for the burger and soft drink. Until now! I put those things down and took it as personal challenge to finish every last one. 

Then, my wife had to mention dessert. Hah? No way! Oh, OK! Did someone say PBC & B sundae? Vanilla custard , Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, banana, whipped cream & cherry-sounds good right? My wife and I split the mini sundae ($3.59), and it was plenty. But then again, I was full long before the sundae arrived.",fOut10lknIp64tm3z6UTNg,0,0,5,Lt3j9Mb38HA6nTYE6zXgLw

As others state, this isn't your typical savory, juicy, meat loaded burger. This is a burger has a much thinner patty, is a bit crispy (on the outside), has great toppings, and in all honesty, is one of the better fast food burgers I've had. Decided to go with ol' #1 - because if a #1 can't be done right in a fast food restaurant then they can't do anything right. Burger included two patties, 2 slices of cheese, onion, pickle, and decided to have them substitute the mustard for Freddy's sauce. Excellent choice if I do say so myself. The burger was cooked perfect, crispy outside, not overcooked inside. The Freddy's sauce made the burger & fries spectacular. My order was to go, but I was happy to see that they had Freddy's seasoning salts right at the to go counter available to use prior to leaving the restaurant. Great service, got the food quickly, and I definitely plan on going back.

The decor inside the restaurant is great, very 50's looking - and more importantly it's CLEAN. How often do you walk into a fast food chain restaurant and see tables that look like a flock of 4yo's dominated a smorgasbord? 

I can't wait to go back and try some of their custard. If they taste half as good as the pictures look I may be checking back in with a 5 star rating.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,5,5,4,EGXclkH2LG2qETIYTex13w

Driving around hungry I looked for a hot dog place and found Freddy's Frozen Custard Steakburgers, the reviews looked good so I ventured out and heading there.
Bigger building than I thought, and very quick at taking your orders, I went at a lunch time and only had about 4 people ahead of me which was a 5 min wait.
Upon getting my hot dog ""a chili cheese with onions hot dog"" and string fries, I went over to the condiment station.  I recommend the fry sauce next to where you pick up your order, it's a wonderful blend of mayo and ketchup (well that's what it tasted like to me) but it goes great with the hot fries.
The hot dog was perfect, no way you can eat it with your hands you have to use a knife and fork, but the pop you get from the hot dog when you bite into it was great and the chili was beefy and very tasty it was not spicy but with the melted cheese and fresh white onions it went great with the dog.
I will be going back to try their Steakburger as they looked great as well.

Oh, and a regular burger is a double- be warned. For those of you who aren't feelin that-, they have a California burger. More classic style with a fry sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. 
You can tell everything is fresh, and they use a good quality beef. The also offer hot dogs, shakes, malts, and fries. 
Usually I don't even review fast food- but this is one place I can go when I don't want fast food, but I still want cheap and convenient.

Fast and 100% customer service even through drive through.

EXPERIENCE:

Drove up and was greeted right away with a friendly and welcoming voice.

I told the girl that it's my first time and I asked her which was better, the number 1 or number 7? She told me number 6 with bacon. She did not hesitate to tell me what and enjoyed and to be honest I'm glad she told the truth! 

I also ordered a mini chocolate milk shake and OH MY GOSH, best

It came with shoestring fries and a drink. The burger itself was not as big as I thought since there were two patties. It's about the same size as an In n Out Double Double, only In n Out's has a little more veggies. The patties themselves were a bit salty and just a tad overcooked. The fries were your average shoe string. The Freddy's sauce and special seasoning is what probably allowed me to finish the fries.

What is making me give them 3 stars instead of 2 is the dessert they are known for! Frozen Custard! From their menu you can have it either as a Sundae or Concrete (milkshake form). I ordered the PBC n B Sundae. Comes in mini, medium, or large. Im glad I got the mini cuz I could not finish it! The PBC n B consists of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, Sliced Bananas, Frozen Vanilla Custard, Whipped Cream, and a single Cherry on top. (refer to my pic!) They have other tantalizing flavors as well which is probably the only saving grace in coming back here.

Service is friendly as evidenced by the smiles and attention I received at the counter. Prices average about 7 to 8 bucks if you want a decent meal to fill you up. The overall size of the place is very spacious with enough tables and booths. The bathrooms are a nice size and is actually pretty clean.

Ordering was painless, but watching the them put together a Hawaiian blended custard was painful...it's looked pretty killer!    

My order was done in four minutes, and I was very happy with the appearance of my burger.   It had a caramelized finish like the old snoop burgers ( I really miss that place)   but I was not too happy with the old bacon, but what the heck, the burger was done right.    These folks nicely season their burger while it's cooking, and this what separates them from Steak n Shake.  

The manager does take his rounds in the dining room, and checks on how your doing,    I always feel this what makes or breaks a new business, and listening to your customers feedback is going to be your biggest tool for success.    Good luck Freddys,  you're on the right track.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,7,3,3,Zsz6KrgZB5SMetUsFmOKXQ

Even though the place was quite busy, we were greeted immediately within seconds of going thru the door(literally!). I've got to say that for a fast food place, I was very impressed with the service recieved here. Everyone was rediculously nice and friendly.

After reading the reviews, I had somewhat lowered expectations. Alot of the reviews compare Freddy's to Steak N Shake, which is fair to a certain degree. Living near South Point, I've been to SNS many times, and Freddy's burgers are definately a notch better. The burgers I had last night had a lot more flavor than the burgers I get at SNS, but than again, you will pay a bit more here too. The prices aren't as bad as I had heard, but for 3.19 for a single patty and 4.29 for a double, they aren't exactly cheap either.

Still, though, I really like this place. The great customer service really goes a long way with me. I will definately be back.

When your team member can't hear what your customer is ordering through the drive thru, please don't tell them to say,""you need to speak up!"" That to me comes off really rude and disruptive, especially when they're shouting back at you. 
I'd prefer a more calmer and pleasant approach like, ""I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Can you please repeat that?"" And maybe we'll raise our voice just a little so you can hear us better.

Freddy's was easily worth a second visit. On the first trip I had the double California and it was very good, my wife had a single steak-burger. The patty, although slightly thin,  has some nice char which we both really enjoyed. My son had a hot dog and he said it was better than Nathans. He gave it 5 stars.The bun is loaf style, buttered and toasted. The thin-cut fries were excellent, and we used the special sauce for dipping which was far better than the usual ketchup. The meal ended with a shared Turtle Sundae which was first-rate and very tasty.

The second trip called for a Patty Melt, it was delicious. The onions were perfectly grilled and tasty, the bread toasted and buttered. A nice meat to bread ratio. I added some of the Freddy Sauce and it made the sandwich even better. The meal ended again with a Turtle sundae.

The price is reasonable along with an ample menu selection to warrant future return visits. I would not say that Freddy;s is better than Two Guys, Smashburger, In-n-out, they are all on the burger radar, but Freddy's offers a great alternative and excellent custard creations for dessert.The dining room is large and has a welcome ambiance, the self-serve drink station, Freddy's Sauce & Ketchup dispenser are a welcome change to tearing open 10-15 small packets plus the amenities are well-done. The staff is helpful and friendly plus eager to answer any questions.

I might even eat it in my bed, and not shower and drink my Thanksgiving away. This will lead to several explicit drunk texts I will knowingly regret the next day, but my friends will be entertained. Yup, that's how I will give thanks. 

Back to the hotel...I mean the concrete. Charlie Brown would even agree it's the Great Pumpkin.  If you dig pumpkin pie at all they shove the whole shabang in there including the soft crust, pumpkin filling, nutmeg, whipped cream and crop dust it all with cinnamon.

Fish sandwiches are all the rave right now infant food restaurants. McDonalds started with the fish sandwich many years ago and others have followed suit. Without commenting on any other fish sandwiches, Freddy's fish sandwich is among the top of the list. Crispy, hot and full of flavor, this sandwich is two pieces of fish in a fried batter, served on a toasted white bun with a slice of cheese and a ""Freddy's"" sauce (tasted like 1000 island). 
On this day, I chose the sandwich and the fish and chips. I hope these two items become part of the regular menu. Both are worth the money and a great addition to the already amazing menu.
If I were to give one piece of criticism, it would be the pricing for the hot dogs. The dogs are pretty spendy. Although they a delicious, there is just no value for the hot dogs.
If you're going to eat at a fast food restaurant, skip the chain places and go to Freddy's. Simple food done well, good pricing, and some of the friendliest employees in Las Vegas. Keep up the good work Freddy's.",OXwmkyamQ5H6Ed0xZo_kQA,2,0,5,P7mv92Ry9FwVrpWW0zvmxg

Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers is apparently known for their burgers and custard, but I haven't tried either! The first visit I only ordered fries because I'm not into burgers and wasn't too hungry. I also hit up the drive-thru on my first visit so I still wasn't sure what Freddy' s was all about and since hubby was in the mood for a burger I suggested we go back and try this place again. Since Freddy' s promotes Chicago dogs outside their building and the fact that they use vienna all beef hot dogs, I figured they were based out of Chicago. Nope! Freddy' s started in Wichita, KS. The burgers are fresh, never frozen and grilled to order. Custard is churned fresh daily at each location. I will try the custard on the next visit!

This visit though, I ordered a ""Chili Cheese Dog"" priced at $3.89 and ""Chili Cheese Fries"" priced at $3.59. The hot dog, all beef, was topped with chili, cheese and onions. I enjoyed it! The chili cheese fries were much bigger then I expected. The fries are shoestring and covered in chili, cheese and onions. I liked that nacho cheese sauce was used and I love shoestring fries, but the fries were soggy from not being hearty enough to hold all of the toppings. I'm a fan of onions rings so I ordered some priced at $2.29 and found them to be pretty good. The onion rings weren't as thick as I would like, but they were big round-wise and cooked just right. Hubby ordered a double ""Hatch Green Chili Burger"" priced at $5.49 and he enjoyed it. 

The inside was clean and the employees friendly.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,21,17,3,04vGIax0cZr8QOdU25XjCQ
3522522,2015-05-01,2,hojZyJk1Wf2UE2CpG7cgIg,"I know it's been a while since my last review, but I finally managed to snag some time to write for you guys! I went here with some friends and I was surprised it was so close to me lol.

If you guys are anything like me, you probably thought this was more of a dessert place because of the word custard in their name, but I can assure you that they also sell yummy American food like hamburgers and hot dogs!

I ordered the number 7 combo on the menu which came with a burger (2 thin patties, bacon, 2 slices of cheese, tomato, lettuce, and onions), fries, and a drink. The burger was alright overall, but the best part was the taste of the patties. The buns were kind of flat and flavorless and the raw onion taste wasn't very appealing to me. Also, the bacon slices were all clustered in one area so it was hard to get an even ratio of bacon with each burger bite. Honestly, I think In and Out still has the best burgers, but this place was a nice change of pace. I do have to say that their fries are skinny, crispy, and just delicious. Soggy fries are never a good thing and I'm glad I didn't have this experience here. They also have a fry sauce which you guys have to try, but I think it is just basically thousand island sauce lol. 

I also got the PBC and C sundae which was basically vanilla ice cream topped with pieces of reese's peanut butter cups, banana slices, whipped cream, and a cherry. One thing to note, you can get your dessert in two forms: concrete or sundae. Concrete basically means they will blend in the toppings with the ice cream which makes it easier to eat in terms of cleanliness. It does make the dessert look kind of sad though because it just looks like they used a bunch of ice cream and not as much toppings. The sundae form is messier, but you get to see and TASTE the toppings which I enjoyed when eating the reese's peanut butter cups. 

Overall, I'd say this place was decent and is nice to try out if you have never been here. If you really want delicious, cheap burgers, In and Out is still the place to go.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,4,3,3,TEJH7CxeE9dooGWHW9wcPQ

Had the fríes with cheese a Pepsi to wash it all down.  The burger was actually really good with a soft bun and the burger itself was cooked perfect and very good. You get skinny fries which are good and the cheese on top since I ordered cheese fries made them great.  I also order the traditional Turtle Sunday.

I love their skinny mini fries. they were all perfectly cooked and a generous portion too.
Give the Chili-Cheese Fries extra love by hitting them with some Cholula action...The staff and service is great here, and another cool thing is you can order dessert with your meal and put it on hold.

We finally settled on a regular sundae and a concrete one. When we received our sundaes one of our order was incorrect, the young lady apologized and very quickly was able to make up a new one.

The California burger is what you would expect a traditional California steakburger to be (it tastes just like the steak and shake california burger). It's got the thinnly sliced steak burger with the all the California burger fixings.

Now, I do love their chili cheese fries! I'm not a big fan of chili cheese fries only because it's so filling and I get full off it so fast. It's got the steak burger chunks in it with nacho cheese and mini cubes of onion on it. The french fries are also those thinly cut fries which makes it all the more better. You taste more of the chili cheese than the thickness of the fries which I loved.

Now, the turtle custard concrete. DELISH! The custard was nice and thick and super solid! It was rich and creamy. It had all the fixing of a turtle any thing. So the pecans, caramel, and chocolate just made that custard taste so good. If you prefer it premixed and you want to just sip on it, get the concrete.

We both wanted to try the ""Original Double Patty Melt"". So you would think that when they say a burger or a patty melt is a ""double"", it's going to look like what you would find at In & Out Burger or Tommy's or Wendy's, etc, etc. You expect to see 2 burger patty's! So I get my order and look at it. I look at my brother and ask if what I had ordered was in fact a ""Double Patty Melt"". He assured me I had. I looked at my receipt and that's what I paid for. But I see a paper-thin poor excuse of a beef patty (Oh my god! You could see through the fucking thing!) laying inside 2 slices of bread smothered in grilled onions. Confused, I went to the counter and advised the cashier that they had given me the wrong order. She puts on rubber gloves and proceeds to ""finger my patty melt"" in order to show me that there are 2 beef patty's under in between the 2 slices of bread. Get this, they cut the sandwich right down the middle so that you have a patty on each half. But they make sure that the ends that are cut have the patty's over-lapping each other by maybe an inch. So as long as those ends overlap, they can call it a ""Double Patty Melt"". I'm thinking out loud ""Well that's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. The sandwich isn't big enough to justify cutting it down the middle."" So, it's not really a ""Double"". It's just two incredibly small and paper-thin beef patty's set side-by-side on even smaller slices of bread. Never again Freddy's! Very misleading. Oh and by the way...

4074263,2014-11-15,1,hojZyJk1Wf2UE2CpG7cgIg,"I love burgers and this place is awesome! I don't know why it has taken me so long to try it. Every time I'm in the area I see the long line at the drive-thru here so when that many people line up, you know it must be good. 

This is my new go-to pre-movie quick dinner before hitting the Colonnade for a film. Freddy's is FAST. I mean, order and you'll get your fresh and hot order in 5 minutes or less. I don't know how they do it. I also don't know how they can have such low prices. Seriously! My husband and I had a soda, cheese fries, double bacon burger and a triple cheeseburger and our total, with tax, was around $16.00. Now you can't beat that for a meal of this quality!

If you are watching your carbohydrate intake or are an Atkins / low-carb eater, Freddy's is wonderfully accommodating! They will wrap your burger in lettuce or just give you the meat with a fork and knife. They don't act weird and employees actually understand that you want a lettuce wrap. 

The burgers are very small and thin but they are super flavorful with a nice little ""crust"" around the edge. I would compare them to a cross between Smashburger and In-N-Out. There are lots of free toppings you can add to your meal as well as reasonably priced premium add-ons like chili and bacon. If you are extra hungry, I'd recommend the triple patty burger. That's what I normally order and it's a good size and will take the wrinkles out of your belly (I don't eat fries or bread so I NEED that extra meet and cheese)! 

The chili here is kind of gross. I wouldn't recommend it. And if you order the cheese fries, beware that it's not real cheese. They are covered in squirt day-glo fake cheese (like Cheez-Whiz). Yuck. The cheese slices on the burgers are nice and melty however. Don't miss the fry sauce (much loved in Utah) available at the counter. I like to slather it on my cheeseburger (it's basically thousand island dressing). 

The menu is simple and straightforward -- burgers, fries, frozen custard and hot dogs. Be sure to ask about any special promotions so you won't miss out on a tasty bbq bacon burger with onion rings! 

I've never had the frozen custard here but the desserts and sundaes look super delicious. If you have a kid under 12, buy them a Freddy's t-shirt for $5 and each time they wear it to the restaurant and buy a kid's meal, they'll get free frozen custard. Luckily they don't have a promotion like this for adults or I'd weigh about 400 pounds.

The soda fountain has Pepsi products and Diet Dr. Pepper! The interior dining room has a red and white vintage vibe and is spotlessly clean. Ample seating and friendly employees. I love this place and I am fast on my way to becoming a regular.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,2,2,4,P3a-SlcJiSw9dUYTLNRLKQ

That mind you, is comming from someone born and raised in Wisconsin which is know for their shakes/malts and custard, thinlk Leon's and Copp's in Milwaukee. I usually like to try the vanilla shake because vanilla is kind of a litmus test.  If the vanilla they serve is good all the other flavors will inevidebelty be good. I got a mino choc shake which was as good as anything you will find in wisconsin. Also tried the oreo concrete which isn't quite as good as dairyqueens blizzard, but still very good. 

  So now on to the food lol, I had the chilli cheese fries and a single steakburger w/ onoins ketchup and mmustard.  The burgers are very good the best part of it is the nice thin pattie which is crispy and kind of burnt on the edges which I really like. Reminds me of 5 guys patties. The bun isn't exaclty my fave, I prefer true german thin hard rolls.  But regardless the bun is stil fresh and good.  The chilli cheese fries are great, more or less shoestring(really really thing) fries with a cheese sauce which is pretty good and not artificial tasting at all likke a lot of cheesse fries from other places tend to be. All the other toppings seemed to be of good quality and tasted good.  Overall, I have found a new fave joint to go to 3 or 4 times a month.  I really like it that much.

Freddy's was recommended to me by a friend who was tired of hearing me complain about how bad nearly all burger joints are.

Thanks friend, you've saved me.

I LOVE THIS PLACE. 

Thin steak burgers with a crispy edge.... assembled with care (unlike the Wendy's stuff that looks like a big girl just sat on it). Pickles were fresh and plentiful, placed with care across the entire burger. I stress ""with care."" They do apparently and it makes all the difference in the world.

The shoe-string french fries are the best! Thin, so they get crispy (unlike the crap they serve and Raisin Cains... great chicken and bread but sorry guys, your ""steak fries"" suck). I LOVE FREDDY'S FRIES!

The service was fast and friendly. The young senorita at the drive through had a smile that made me happy to be there and her eyes sparkled like the Nile. Bless that nice young lady. 

These burgers and fries are good enough that they could eventually bring world peace.

Trust me. And this is just about a burger.  Totally the most underrated burger in Vegas.  In America.  Way better than Shake Shack if you're want validation.  Look. My first shake shack was great. Mind blowing,  my second a let down. Freddie's was perfect the first time, and has never disappointed. And it continues to be crave-worthy.

Decided to drive to this location because of the many awesome reviews, even though the one in Henderson is much closer.

Walked in, and it was SO BUSY! Of course, we chose to go on a Saturday around 1pm. I could barely hear the cashier, it was so loud. We had already decided on a double cheeseburger for my husband (thanks to all of the previous reviews talking about how thin the patties are), and a single for me. The cheeseburger comes with onion, pickles, and mustard. I just asked for ketchup and mustard on mine. For the double, we got a meal. For $.50 more, we changed the fries to onion rings. 

So glad we did that. The onion rings were some of the best we've had in ages. The burgers were really good. They had that nice flat grilled, juicy taste. Their pickles are sliced lengthwise. Love that! The single was perfect sized for me, as I didn't feel ridiculously full after I finished it. The double was similar to a decently sized regular burger elsewhere. 

I didn't care for their fry sauce, as it was kind of tangy. I like that they had both ketchup and mustard dispensers by the soda machine. This place was very clean, and all of the dispensers were full. Nice staff. 

We were very pleased with this place, and were surprised that we have not really heard more about this place. We are for sure coming back, and we also need to check out their custard.

I really was never going to go out of my way to eat at Freddy's, but because I happened to be on the side of town where it is located getting my nails done with my sister we decided to go here. I just so happened to see it when we were driving around.

The inside reminds me of an Inn N Out with obnoxiously nice employees. I know, how can employees be so nice they are obnoxious? When while in the course of being there for about 30 minutes and we are asked how everything is about 4 times. Okay, I'm complaining for nothing... I concede to the fact. But I am assuming the niceties will only last for so long, until Freddy's is just the 2nd Steak & Shake in Vegas.

Okay food - I ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a soda, the combo. My sister ordered a hot dog and a water. We shared the fries - it's a good thing we did. The fry portions are massive, which basically does not surprise me anymore. They are shoestring fries though, kind of refreshing... as far as french fries goes.

My sister said her ""Chicago"" dog was tasty and good. My burger was good too. Now I've had the whole ""Steakburger"" thing. I don't know... is it better than other burgers? I just can't decide. I mean, it was good, but... uuuhhh, I just don't know. I'm just not really impressed.

Would I go back? Isn't that what it comes down to? When I go get my nails done and on that day I feel like a burger, perhaps I'll stop by Freddy's. But to go out of my way to come here? Nah. 

PS - They have fry sauce. Obvi everyone knows this is ketchup and mayo, but yea, still... FRY SAUCE.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,2,3,1CEadnaNfCrT7VK1S9MoPQ

What I found was an amazingly fresh burger (cooked to order). The pickles were a nice touch (long, bun length) and the bun was toasted just right! My only knock is that the bacon was just ok and you need to add some sauce to the burger as mustard was the only thing on there. But, Im sure if you play around with it you'll find your perfect way. First impression thought is that It still lacks in the signature taste department compared to In N Out, but this is the best #2 I've found... And that's saying a lot! 

The custard was to die for! Tried a turtle sundae and I wasn't disappointed at all. I think next time it will be the Hawaiian one... Actually, it will be up to the wife to choose the next one so who knows!

The Freddy's Original double with cheese is pretty good.  They do thin and bigger patties.  The flavor is standard and not too oily, nothing special in my opinion but a solid burger.  The fries are the thin type, which I like and they have fry seasoning you can add after too which is nice.

The new Philly cheesesteak is a bit dry for my taste and could use a bit more meat.  The cheese sauce on top is pretty good and helps make the sandwich.

But the second date, or in this case a visit is the one where you quickly learn she's not a keeper and she's got some real annoyances that makes you glad when she gets out of the car and you can drive away. I like Freddy's...the hamburgers are flavorful and the service is fast, but things are not quite as they should be. The California steakburgers sound good but beyond the steakburger itself it's just lacking flavor. Perhaps changing the toppings might help. And the onion rings this time were hard to chew, and in one case didn't seem to be quite fully cooked as if the staff was rushing the orders. 

But as I write this I have to call out their concrete as a failure. When I think of a concrete for dessert my mind instantly compares it with one of America's standardbearers, Ted Drewes frozen custard off Historic Route 66 in St. Louis, Missouri. They offer a simple test for a concrete. Turn the cup upside down. If it stays put it's legit. If it starts to run and drip it's a pretender. My Freddy's cup maybe got to 120 degrees of rotation before failing miserably. And while the Hawaiian was supposed to have pineapple and macadamia nuts and other goodies in it, this concrete was boring. So much so that I dumped it in the trash. 

Will I go back? Yeah, but In-N-Out will likely see my car in their drivethrough ordering Animal style before Freddy's does.

The unfortunate side to Freddy's in my opinion is that their chili tastes canned (I know it's from a can, but not everywhere tastes like straight up Hormel chili from a can, which is nasty), the fries suck and are flavorless, unless greasy is the flavor you are going for, and if you order the chili cheese fries they come standard with a gross cheese sauce and in order to get real cheese you have to psychically know that real cheese is an option that you can ask for.

4817303,2012-12-28,1,hojZyJk1Wf2UE2CpG7cgIg,"Good day friends! CFC here with YET ANOTHER restaurant review!

You all know by now that I'm a Chicago transplant, so when I saw a sign advertising ""Chicago style Hotdogs"" while driving down Eastern in search of feed... I immediately thought, ""Oh no. This is dangerous. If they screw this up I'm going to have go on Yelp and TEAR em' apart! Don't me do this!"" and I'll do it... I've done it!  

But, thankfully, this didn't have to happen.  :-)

I'll say flat out that the hotdog wasn't ""Gene & Judes good"", but it was definitely good. As soon as I took the first bite, a memory swept across my mind... leaving Hot Doug's on California, hooking a right on Addison, I was heading home again! The right toppings, which of course includes pretty much everything but ketchup (don't you dare), a nice buttered up bun and most importantly... the right kind of dog. You have to hear the ""break""... and you do! Real Chicago Hotdog lovers know exactly what I mean by ""hearing the break"".

The fries were just alright. I tend to like a thicker french fry so I'm not going to dock them for that as it's a matter of personal preference. I will definitely be back for the dogs and I will be trying the steakburger and frozen custard next time.

I know now... double burgers are not big!! Also they have show string fries which were tasty, but al the ones we got were tiny fry bits.

So I brought my family here a few months ago and we all enjoyed our food immensely. As my poetic husband wrote in his review (Ray L.), it was ""fat pants"" worthy.

4934463,2012-08-05,1,hojZyJk1Wf2UE2CpG7cgIg,"Yeah Freddy's!  This is a nice place for a burger and with the kids!

I have to say this is a nice place to try for Burgers and good place to come back to many times.  To me, it is a definite notch above the McDonalds, Burger Kings, Wendy's type of places and near quality of Inn and Out.

1.  Ambiance - 5 star - Nice amount of room, people always cleaning and keeping it up.  Even the toilet is very clean and fresh.  I say one of the best when it comes to overall appearance and ambiance.

2.  Service - 5 star - Everyone here, from the manager to the staff is top notch.  Helpful, friendly, open to giving suggestions and ideas.  I find them all to be very, very pleasant and makes coming here even better.  You know how some of these fast food places, they get what they pay for.  Here at Freddy's top class!

3.  Food - 3.5 star - The food is pretty good overall.

a.  Fries - 4 star - Best thin fries ever.  Great sauce near the cash register just for the fries and of course the huge ketchup dispenser with small paper cups to douse your fries in.  Very crispy, lightly fried taste, and you will want to grab a bunch. They give you a bunch.  Not like Five Guys, yet certainly plenty.

b.  Steak Burger - 3 star.  Actually enjoyable, easy to palm in your hand and eat, compared to some of the ones at Inn and Out or Five Guys where it is so huge that you have to create a logistics plan on how to eat it.  The taste is nice, nothing spectacular in my book, however, tasty overall.

c.  Hot Dogs - 3 star -  Actually I do like the lightly toasted bun they put it in, so that is a plus.  It is a hot dog and we did not get the chili dog or anything. However, I find that the hot dogs at Costco, in those amazing soft delicate buns are freakiin awesome and something like 1.50 with a drink, so compared to that, it is a good hot dog..... just not mind blowing.  

d.  Variations - 4 star - they have plenty of variations, doubles and plenty of your basic condiments. Not over the top and confusing, so that makes it nice for your all around all american burger and dogs.

e.  desserts - 4 star - Oh my, oh my.  you have to leave room for the desserts.  The Turgle, PBC & B, and Chocolate Brownie Delight are great whether as a Sundae or as a Concrete, which is custord mixed in like a shake with all the other ingredients.  Tasty for sure!


I really like this place, professional, tasty , easy to get in, easy to park, easy seating, quality, and nice for family, teens, adults.  Nice!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,3,1,4,CVyzFJyXRGd6SsvjiyHoIw

When I 1st looked at it I'm like ""that's kinda on the thin side for the patties"" but I soon realized (I think) that it was because it was pressed down like that when they cooked it. You would think that because it was cooked like that, that it would be dry, but that wasn't the case. As matter of fact there was still enough pink in the middle. I also enjoyed the slightly crisp edges and the little char taste of it. I appreciate how the onions weren't overdone in content like some places, so I didn't have to make a mess picking it off. I also liked the how they used long pickle slices that were not overly sour. I ate the skinny fries on the way home, which is my M.O. when ordering drive-thru and they were perfectly crisp with just the right saltiness. I don't know if I was trippin' or not, but I thought i tasted a hint of garlic in the background? @the drive thru, I saw an advertisement for a drink called the ""pumpkin pie concrete"" but decided to be cheap and passed it up, but by the time I got to the window,  it was more than enough time for me to contemplate and ordered a regular :) good thing I did because it well worth it! It had nice chunks of pie crust and the spice was an excellent compliment. If you're a burger connesiur and have found yourself in a rut, then this is the change of pace that you've been looking for!

Tip: whatever you're about to overspend on steaks n shakes @southpoint save it for Freddy's and while at Freddy's, eat the fries while still warm.

My review is based on my drive-thru service experience. 

11:00 am, Sunday morning (1/25/2015)  and no one is in the drive-thru. Perfect, I'm the 1st one here thought.... Not! They were packed inside! A parking lof full of customers pulling in to enjoy some goodness... I'm a mom on the run running errands with a toddler in the backseat since 7:00 am.. So  picking up lunch and enjoying it at home is always the best choice for me. 

The drive thru cashier was soo sweet. She never said anything when i added more things to my order as we waited for our food in the drive-thru. I considered ordering a shake and opted out when she took my order at the speaker...Then, as we waited i changed my mind. You only live once right? 

I get home and we dig in.. The best chicken fingers i have had in my life. Not greasy nor stale like other joints. Just simply crispy and hot all the way through the very last one. (This was 15mins after i left the drive-thru). I ordered the large order (6pcs) for about $7. It was well worth it. I would go back just for those. 

Their apple pie shake is to die for. That was gone by the time i was halfway home. Every spoonful had pie crust and filling along with creamy vanilla custard. Your tastebuds would go nuts with this one. 

I'm not a fan of their shoe string fries, those were cold and hard by the time I got home. But my son loved them. He gave them a 5/5 as he dipped them in ketchup.

The single burger was delicious. Like the ones dad used to make on the grill growing up. Delicious and well-done. 

Thumbs up for Freddy's, they are doing burgers right over there.",-pCIK2f47lHXiAw-uiD-aQ,2,2,4,BklRzUmCjY_qPCH48gkSqw
5096487,2012-07-14,0,hojZyJk1Wf2UE2CpG7cgIg,"When I was sitting in Freddy's enjoying my burger, I heard some criticism from nearby tables.  I think the overarching criticism of Freddy's - the thin, almost crunchy burgers - merely indicates that people seemed confused about what a steakburger IS.  A steakburger is MEANT to be thin and crunchy.  That's the whole point.  I guess people in this region just don't ""get it"" yet.  If you want your burger thick and juicy, you're at the wrong place.  In that case, I recommend Badger Cafe on Tropicana.  

However, if you're like me and just LOVE a steakburger, you've come to the right place.  I'm originally from the Midwest and went to college down the street from a Steak 'N Shake, the king of the steakburger (disclaimer: the Steak 'N Shake in Southpoint is NOT representative of what a Midwest steakburger is...they don't seem to know how to do it right).  I was SHOCKED to find that Freddy's does the steakburger BETTER than Steak 'N Shake!  The meat is flavorful, the cheese is very melty (sorta like In 'N Out), and the bun is light and buttery.  The fry sauce goes well on both the burgers and the fries.  Speaking of fries... I think the fries are the most notable difference between Freddy's and Steak 'N Shake.  Both chains are known for their shoestring fries.  However, Freddy's fries are fried to golden perfection and seasoned with this incredible seasoning salt blend.  SNS is known for undercooked, underseasoned, cold fries that I only find palatable if drenched in piping-hot cheese sauce.  

I haven't tried the custard.  I don't eat custard, but I'm curious.  I might make my fiancé order it next time so I can live vicariously through him.

Five stars for exactly what it is - a delicious, high-quality STEAKBURGER.  It isn't fair to rate it any other way.  If it isn't your cup of tea... fine!  Great!  More for me!",3rsZCoTmr8EM7DwtGm_RsQ,3,0,5,4I2--Htig6Re0iU60zy8jA

The girl in the drive through had an attitude and clearly didn't want to waste her last few minutes at work helping a customer that was the first thing that made my experience not so great, and then to have to correct them on one part of my order only to get home and see my order was made wrong made this experience pretty terrible.

After going to the Victorville, CA location...and then finding out that this one is owned by the same person, I had really high expectations, that were not met.

The good:
The staff is SUPER polite, and very helpful:  welcoming us when we walked in, wishing us a good day when we left, etc. 
The fries were FRESH, and hot, and delicious.  

The not so great: 
Comparing to our visit last weekend to the Victorville location, the burgers were REALLY underseasoned.  They weren't bad, but it was definitely noticeable.  

They messed up my fella's order...a lot.
He ordered the original double steakburger, adding ketchup, lettuce, and tomato. 

He got a single steakburger, California style, including thousand island...and he hates mayo based sauces.  
He wasn't thrilled with it initially, noticing that it was a lot smaller than it should have been, but about halfway through the burger, noticed the thousand island, pulled the burger apart and saw why it was so small...

Now, we didn't send it back...mostly because he was already halfway through it, but he was super disappointed.

While it's not my favorite fast food burger, the steak burger is also very good and you will like it.",0pxs_SIrX4xjLO-_InE7-A,0,0,3,c_xgPiItYjgmCNf8O_IHoA

Well I think this places is a little better than in n out. Possibly because they have a menu with more options than the standard burger. Every single time I've ate here it's been excellent. The burgers freshly made, and the fries still nice and warm. I love how they don't add seasoning to fries, and you could add to your taste. To top it off, Freddy's dipping sauce hmmmm goes so well with the burger and fries. Oh and can't forget they have custards too and they are a must try.",Lqa-U3bSO1wtYXnHLLjXCg,1,0,5,bJs7saLWDNBr7W4i0mI7EA

Spoke to one of the owners last night (Curtis) what a great guy. Also Asha, the gal at the register who helped us pick out some new items to try (yummy - chili cheese fries), so warm and friendly. Great job Curtis and Asha.

I mean a burger place where people greet you and come around and ask if they can get you anything. Then, we finished eating and they were right there ready to clean up our mess. They had a minimum 2 people doing nothing but cleaning up in the dining room. It was impressive. McDonalds, BK, Wendy's take a lesson in customer service from these people. They do everything but park your car for you. Wonderful wonderful wonderful. Today was Veterans day. The cashier asked if I was a Veteran. Said yes, she shook my hand and thanked me for my service. Then she handed me a certificate for a complete free meal on my next visit. WOW....What a place.

Freddy's is my ideal burger spot. The patties are hand molded at the restaurant and they're super juicy and full of flavor. Beyond satisfying! 

The shoestring fries are perfect! Freddy's seasons their fries and very yummily, in fact. Get the fry sauce! Perfect combo, forreal.

They have a lot of options so there should be something for Just about everyone in the group. My one tip is to maybe ask if there are any vegetarian options or dairy free, I didn't and I have my doubts about whether they do. That or don't bring that person you know who doesn't eat meat.
As for the service. I've definitely had better service, I would like to blame it on our coming in two hours before closing, but not really though. There were plenty of other guests in the diner and drive thru, and I didn't really didn't feel welcome in their cafe. 
As for the food, if you're looking for an alternative to in n out, I recommend giving them a shot; they aren't better, but they are comparable.",Wo2YCyTRHSjdEEKwCrwTcg,0,0,2,iBTErv9wPntvJvB-9ZbLvg

I keep it simple and just add good 'ol Oreo cookies with vanilla custard. Delicious and way better than stupid McDonald's McFrankenstein-Flurry. I've also had a taste of the chocolate concrete with peanut butter added in and it was delicious! Way less sweet than if Reese's peanut butter cups were added in, but that's just me.
