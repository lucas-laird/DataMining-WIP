30031,2016-02-18,0,PAcD5cYk9yFtgUYvejaVfQ,Order was taken by a girl with braces (sorry never got a receipt to know her name). Also can't do the deal taco survey cause of no receipt. I was never offer any sauce and she was nice but short cause she wanted to talk to her friend.,49ykfrA2IBWI2W7xrDYZyw,0,0,1,rFSNMWGSnlxB4HH6FHm8Dw

I thought they were preparing my food in that 5 minutes of wait time. What the heck did they do? How was the ingredient stored? Why were they served cold? Not even gonna microwave it for me? Not like it's the right thing to do anyway but at least try making it warm, no? And I paid for that extra salsa. Nope, it's not in the bag. This is the one single most disappointing drive thru purchase I've ever made.

I'm never going back to this branch again.",Bb6iz8w_42o4cm9DtrCUIg,0,0,1,osfr6yOU1ke3PaD4ip0prg
2315686,2016-10-29,0,PAcD5cYk9yFtgUYvejaVfQ,This is by far the worst Del taco experience I've had. Their coffee was not vanilla-ish at all and originally we weren't even going to get coffee we were going to get soda but the soda machine was so disgusting and smelly that we couldn't do it. Their tacos were not as to par and they are usually. The chips were so loaded with grease and salt it was Hardly edible at all. Earliest in the morning we could've possibly been there they had zero french fries that's an abomination. This experience was horrible I do not recommend this Del taco.,ZkPb2cgGmlJKhmBLTgLBkQ,0,0,2,ZHU276kpH6RKU_m9lmgMeA

Always gets the order wrong
If it's right they have to repeat it 100 times to get it
NEVER have the total before you get to the window
Poor customer service",LnC93etRS5OZG-VDZHdSkw,0,0,1,AbI04VAWk-rAbfXfT-zhug

3141718,2016-02-11,2,PAcD5cYk9yFtgUYvejaVfQ,Let's see where should I start about del taco? It's not my favorite but it's convenient! I only order 1 of two things from them and that's the Epic Scrambler burrito off the breakfast side and the infamous cheesecake bites! That's about it.. Everything else has made me throw up in the past so... I stick to what I know whenever I decide to eat here. The drive thru usually moves pretty quick and the staff seems decent. I haven't had any issues with anybody nor the food.,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,1,1,3,Z-oTFrlCwe241T11klXBIg

Haha, seriously though, one of my favorite late night, and I'm super drunk places to eat.  A crazy large menu means you will find something to grub and I love any place that carries Mr Pibb.  Try the bacon and egg quesadilla.",lwhksSpgIyeYZor_HlN93w,0,0,3,tJc4xhxrQKXJxWIIOfEk5A

4787343,2017-05-11,0,PAcD5cYk9yFtgUYvejaVfQ,"Worst Del Taco in the city!  Their iced tea smells and tastes like sewer water.  You are lucky if you get what you actually ordered. We went through the drive thru today and out of 4 items ordered we got one correct, one was missing, and when I pointed this out the employee argued with me about what I ordered vs. what she bothered to key in. She also refused to give me my receipt so I couldn't even do the survey to say she sucked.  Go to a different location, avoid this one.",Y7D2R1ThyfXMaa4x_CL1hw,0,0,1,OAxswUhdvoFtkyGQvgh83w

Meaning no lettuce no tomato Cheese etc just meat. Well you can't make this stuff up. I got an empty hard shell. No meat nothing. Who orders a shell ? I also ordered one dell taco with cheese only. Guess what I got. A hard shell stuffed with cheese only. No meat ! I don't think whom ever was
Making dine in orders that day didn't understand English enough to make the tacos to order. Needless to say visiting this location going forward is not an option anymore. Just not worth the laughs anymore.",grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,2,_QbNEURUw_bxertWgEx-YQ
