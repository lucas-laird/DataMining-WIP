Called the restaurant letting them know that our sliders lacked the jack daniel's glaze. They offered to deliver the glaze to our room, but the person that brought us the glaze told us that the JACK DANIEL'S Sliders did not come with the glaze.  If the Jack Daniel's sliders was not supposed to have the glaze, then which part of the sliders is Jack Daniel's?

Warning! Never order the Jack Daniel's sliders , especially at this restaurant. You will not get what you order and they will tell you you're wrong.

1023333,2018-03-22,0,X5Q_PKC-AeMrO4uSpnmgGg,I went an ate here for my lunch and the food was good but the service was really slow. The worst part of all is I saw the manger grab a piece of cake with her bare hands and stick it on a glass and go serve it to the customer. Then I saw a different employee grab a different ready to eat food with her bare hands and give it to another customer.,hJM-iZk70Zc9TAsDsfS-zg,0,0,1,uDlgy9FuIVkSptFAbjXF-A
1059658,2017-08-14,0,X5Q_PKC-AeMrO4uSpnmgGg,"This is probably the go to place for a hangout eat or just a late night grab... came in with a good size group of friends at 8pm. Most of our group had the endless apps , a go to choice by many. I had the steak and lobster with two sides... Their food was prompt and accurate; however, my order took 41 minutes. Not only was everyone else on their 4th appetizer by the time I received my food, it was not cooked as ordered. My fries were soggy with blood,  and the lobster tail was grilled from the outer layer and raw underneath. After bringing it up to the waiter's attention he just said he would take it back without any acknowledgment to the mistake or wait time.  Decided to bring it up the manager,PAUL,for constructive criticism and before I finished explaining everything he interrupted with ""the appetizers take a while"" . .. I don't know where he usually dines at or how long he's been in customer service but that's unacceptable. There is no way you can tell me that you'll serve the whole table until they can't eat anymore before putting in my order. I'm a paying customer, I shouldn't have to wait for the fourth round of endless apps to get my order. Another tip, before you give a customer a ridiculous excuse.... it wouldn't kill you to address the issue and apologize for the inconvenience. Just $25 down the drain, if you're considering TGIF just make sure you're not hungry if you're ordering anything that doesn't fall under endless apps.",eNiGzIG27r9e6x_6eAwe4A,1,0,1,8ISYHFAVn9OljLmRNSG-tw

Our server Dani was so slow and non-engaged with her customers it ruined the while evening. Not to mention, getting here at 7:30 and not receiving all of the food in a decent amount of time. At 9:00 we cancelled the remaining order that had not been received.  After asking for the check twice it was in correct with items we didn't even order.

1942084,2018-06-18,5,X5Q_PKC-AeMrO4uSpnmgGg,"It's a chain restaurant in a local's casino on the bad side of town. It's sufficient and fairly consistent. Hit up this spot for an easy dinner before seeing a movie at the Century theater across the floor. Request indoor seating to avoid casino smoke (open ""patio"" gets the fumes). Service is attentive, with most servers training another employee.

Food on most recent visit was priced a bit higher than I expected but it's been ages since I've been to a TGI. They've added new menu items to try to stay trendy, and I really appreciate that they list their calorie count and nutrition info on the menu- went with a soup/salad combo instead of other dishes I was eyeing. Food was fresh, friend got a skillet meal that was sizzling and flavorful while mine was as expected. Drink refills were prompt, which is a nice plus.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,8,3,vIAsJb4iZf8m22zDhvYu3w

As a server I always try to give other servers second chances to correct mistakes they make while out eating. Our servers name was Holly not only did she take 20 minutes to bring us water and 2 beers which she messed up in the size, she was also very rude! When we asked her if she had put our order in for our beer she had the nerve to roll her eyes at us for her mistake! We went for happy hour and we were planning on ordering some more appetizers for our group but she was no where to be found, it's as if she hid for long periods of time waiting for happy hour to end. I try not to judge a server for being slow or even a little forgetful because we all make mistakes including my self, but being rude for your own mistakes is uncalled for. We do appreciate the manager who was working at the time, because he was understanding and he did try fixing the crappy experience she gave us. He was very professional and kind, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to fix the rude attitude she brought to our table. We won't ever be back to this location!",qRbfiO1KkL7G9_QUYbOMwg,1,0,1,SRyyGkN3HN86Eg9JfUEjrA

This was our first visit to this particular location but it will not be our last ! I cannot stress enough how awesome Logan was . He went above and beyond to ensure that our experience at the restaurant was like no other .

3805290,2016-11-01,1,X5Q_PKC-AeMrO4uSpnmgGg,"This is the worse Friday's there is out there. Every time we come here the cooks mess something up. Went here last night at that was my final straw. There's was only 7-8 tables occupied as it was still early. We went for the steak and lobster. The server was nice but it's always the cooks that don't give a crap. Ordered a steak with no seasoning and on the flat grill. 45 minutes go by and still no food. How long does it take to cook 3 meals when the place is dead?! They finally bring out out and guess what, there's seasoning on it. Due to having a sensitive stomach seasoning is out of the question. Sent it back are the rest of the meal and another 20 minutes go by and they finally being another steak. Guess what they did, rinsed it off and threw it back on the grill. It was obvious as underneath there was still some seasoning underneath. The steak was now burned not the medium well that was ordered it was well done and burned. When the manager was questioned why there was still seasoning he lied and said there wasn't even thought it was in the juice on the plate and in the napkin that I dabbed it with. 

Also another order was the jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. On the menu it said a full rack of ribs. They brought out a 1/2 rack. I questioned the server and he said they only do 1/2. We were too annoyed at the steak situation but I should have asked for a menu because they charged me for something that I didn't get. See menu photo from their website. What a joke and in the end a waste of more than an hour and a half. Also never bothered to enter my stripes number so I got no credit. Will never return to this place and I live close by. I'll drive to outback or Millers where they know how to cook right and provide better service!",dwHaW-eG9QEaXghclhGV4Q,1,0,1,5LC7NmaniBp6S94uv9biEA

For our food we couldn't eat they gave us a $10 food voucher, really? We usually tip that much , this was insulting and we will never go there again. We usually take our out of town friends there when they come into town, because they have always been a nice place to go till now.

Other than the cigarette smoke lingering around it was ok. Service was great. We sat at a booth far away from the casino floor, which was great. Ordered a strawberry lemonade as I always do along with a dish I've never tried before: Fettuccine Alfredo pasta with shrimp. A large Caesar salad and new england clam chowder. The chowder was sort of thin and could have been better, but it is what it is for $4 bucks. The salad was good along with the main course. The shrimp was nice and tender. The pasta was soft and the alfred sauce tasted great, especially with some pepper.
