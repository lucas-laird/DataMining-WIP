2640094,2009-03-16,4,6bDpJirSVqt-NXz04vJ8ug,"Oh my, why did I stop here? Somehow I got trapped in the Imperial Palace, surely the ugliest casino hotel on the Strip. I had it in my head that maybe it would be a tribute to the classic Frank Lloyd Wright hotel in Tokyo that was mostly demolished forty years ago. But no, it's just a faux-Japanese facade covering an old-style hotel that looks like it lost its bloom sometime in the 1960's. 

The Burger Palace caught my eye on a promising banner, and I was feeling peckish after changing hotels in the morning. I thought it would be one of those gourmet burger places with all the trimmings. Nope, it's a fast food joint with little imagination. Just a lot of sports murals and teal-colored booths that are a bit of a squeeze for us girth-challenged diners. Perhaps that was their subliminal message to stay away. 

I should have listened as I had a particularly greasy cheeseburger and fries for about $8.75. It came with a lemonade which would have been fine had I ordered it. I spent a good three minutes arguing with the snippy counter girl that I ordered a Diet Pepsi. All in all, I would have preferred having a Big Mac down the block. 

FOOD - 2 stars...burger had heft, but it was mostly made of grease 
AMBIANCE - 1.5 stars...fast food at its lowest common denominator 
SERVICE - 1 star...really surly, but that must be the drawback of wearing a funny paper hat

And any cafe or restaurant near or adjacent to a sportbook is good eating at Vegas. Is it the simple burgers or the chicken strips that keep me coming back? Or is it just the convenience and lack of crowds?

On the second floor of Imperial Palace, right next to the race and sportsbook is the Burger Palace. It's a simple, cafeteria eating place with quite a large menu of burgers, fries, chicken, salads and other fried items that are not really helpful for you.

I like the fact that it seems a little old school Vegas in there. It sometimes feels like a local joint that's in the middle of the Strip. I love that I don't see club scene gals or douchy guys in there. No Ed Hardy shirts, no Axe fragrants, no prostitute looking women; nothing annoying.

So if you're not in the mood for the long lines for buffets or over priced restaurants, give Burger Palace a try if you want simple comfort food to fill you up. It's cheap so you can save your money for the slots. A high recommendation.",MXnFKkh6_9kq3bE4dJXVgA,1,2,4,VfBSJDKRSjkywLsKZK7y_Q

2921439,2010-10-10,1,6bDpJirSVqt-NXz04vJ8ug,"This place needs a serious makeover, but since you are in the Imperial Palace to begin with you have realized that everything inside needs help not just the 24 burger place.  If you are looking at visiting and you are not already at the Imperial Palace go somewhere else for heavens sake.  The food is bordering on being edible, but only barely.  You pay about 10 bucks or so for a combo deal that includes a drink, fries (that are actually okay in my opinion), and a cheeseburger. The burger itself is a basic no frills costco frozen patty that the ""cooked"" somehow.  They avertise that it is a large patty and truth be told it is kinda large, but about half way through eating it I always wish it was smaller (maybe it will do less damage to my insides if it was smaller...).  It comes with some fixings, but don't hold your breath for anything that exciting.
The location is tucked into the back end of the horribly planned IP, on like the 4th floor around the corner from the sports book area.  There is nothing palatial about the decor, mostly it resembles a 1980's fast food joint, complete with artistic renderings of generic famous sports experiences.
Okay, why the two stars you ask?  24 hours.  I can stumble from my room to this location quicker than I can get anywhere else at late at night so I end up going here from time to time, but I always regret it.",-pm-6Ma8PxYYE1ef0B7fKA,2,1,2,RDyUDseA3akywBFY36tUlA
2927196,2011-12-03,4,6bDpJirSVqt-NXz04vJ8ug,"While walking the strip, we saw a sign that said ""burgers,"" so we followed it and ended up here. The color scheme and ""artwork"" on the walls really makes no sense to me. It's like it's suppose to be sports themed, but the colors are all pink with clouds on the ceiling. It's really kind of odd. 

The prices aren't too bad considering it's inside a casino. I ordered the $4.99 deal for one slice of pizza and a medium beverage and Don ordered a cheeseburger, medium drink, and curly fries for about $9.75. The pizza was surprisingly good. I didn't think I was actually going to like anything at this place, just by the looks of it, but I ended up trying to savor every bite of my pizza. The bread was fluffy and there was the perfect amount of cheese and tomato sauce. Luckily Don doesn't really like cheese, so I got to have it all to myself. He didn't mind though because he was busy being seduced by his burger and curly fries. He said the burger was delicious and described it to be juicy and somewhat like In N Out. The curly fries looked perfectly seasoned and browned. I was actually surprised they had curly fries since not many places have them. Since there is a karaoke bar nearby, we were able to have some entertainment while dining, so it was like dinner and a show (bonus). 

I probably wouldn't eat here again, just because I don't hang out at Imperial Palace, nor anywhere around it, but I did have a good dining experience which is why I'm giving them 4 stars.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,5,4,4,qWiaY_GD1oNHSN9e3bCEfA
3038072,2010-10-07,1,6bDpJirSVqt-NXz04vJ8ug,"OK...here's the story. It's about 3 AM. I'm mid-strip and feeling a bit hungry, Need something to absorb a bit of the beverages consumed earlier. I walk into the IP. I see an advertisement for the Burger Palace just upstairs on the third floor. Sounds like it might hit the spot! 

I arrive on the third floor. I see the Burger Palace. Reminds of a desolate snack bar in 1970's era bowling alley. The place smells of grease and a general funk. The menu is posted on a board behind the counter. Also visable is a sign warning patrons that the burgers come preseasoned. That's the way they are. Don't ask. 

I am having second thoughts but I order anyway - I mean, it's the IP but it's still a strip hotel - how bad can it be? 

I go ahead and order. A cheeseburger and a Diet Pepsi. I'm told that it's less expensive if one purchases a combo meal. Go far it I say, bring on the fries as well. I take a seat in a not really clean plastic booth and await my late night snack.... 


Burger: ugh. Yes, that bad really. Nasty nasty. Tastes like a frozen patty one would purchase in bulk at a big box retail warehouse. The fries are a little better - maybe on the overdone and really greasy - but better than the burger (this ain't saying much). At least the diet Pepsi was as expected - you know, diet....

My dad had the Philly. I took a bite and it was bland. Also, it's not an option to get as a meal, so he got it a la carte. At $7.99, it definitely was overpriced. My mom had the cheeseburger meal. I took a bite of that also and it was okay. She got the meal, which comes with fries and a drink for $8.99. Not a bad deal for a meal on the Strip, even if it is at The Quad.

4766454,2012-09-26,2,6bDpJirSVqt-NXz04vJ8ug,"In our culture ""you killed it"" normally means a good thing.  Not so for Burger Palace...

In 2002 (when I moved here the first time) Burger Palace was one of the Top 5 Burger Spots in Las Vegas (I believe it was the RJ that voted them there).  This has changed.  I noticed there were no reviews for this once hidden gem in almost 6 months so I figured I would swing by and give them a try.  

Upon entering my first thoughts were 'nothing has changed'.  This is still a dingy little cafeteria style diner with sports themed graphics on the wall consistent with a child's bedroom.  The tables are still a throwback to the 60's, but the more I think about it I doubt they are 'thrown back', more likely originals that need a remodel.

I ordered the BurgerPalace combo... A hamburger, fries and a coke for the wallet strangling price of $9.14, tax included.  While the woman working the counter didn't flip me off or, to my knowledge, call me names in her native tongue, she wasn't exactly friendly either.

Nearly 20 minutes later I hear a thundering voice consistent with God over a loudspeaker ""Number 14"".  Startled, I glance around and note that I am THE ONLY ONE IN THE RESTAURANT.  Apparently there is still a need for the microphone to avoid any potential mix ups on who's food is ready.

The hamburger-  Having killed numerous cows on the grill in my backyard, I instantly recognized the secret recipe of this masterpiece destined for a landfill: Low quality/high fat beef, salt, waayyy too much pepper.  At the first bite I knew my options were many for this hamburger not limited to paperweight, hockey puck, hammer, etc.  This certainly was not food, however. I truly believe that this poor burger was on the grill the entire 20 minutes I was waiting.  8 minutes would have been enough.

French fries- While they had a golden appearance, they were definitely overcooked as well.  Upon biting into them, they almost snapped, oozing out the trapped grease, leaving me with an insatiable desire to immediately brush my teeth.  Game over.

Coke- Hard to screw that one up.

I ended up taking 2 bites of each item on my plate and exiting with my Coke.  My next stop was In-N-Out on Trop to help rid the memories of this experience.  My advice:  Do not eat here!",dM2Pvd9v-hewm3oZpLczNw,2,1,1,mhTnXaS2BtKGB25Ub8tbVg
