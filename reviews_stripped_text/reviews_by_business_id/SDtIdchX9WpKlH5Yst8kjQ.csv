I gave this place a 3 star rating on the soul fact that I love and support my island people, but when something is overly exsadurated I have too be honest so when my wife said red rice I said let's do it babe let's go try it and be fun and open minded about it cause my best friend is from Guam and I love his moms cooking. To my surprise the food was over prized and not all that great I say this because I favor quality over quantity, even though the average person would say it was a lot of food I say it was decent. I was very unhappy with overall experience here the reason being is that I ordered two musubis and a plate here and spent twenty one dollars okay red rice is great but 3.25 a scoop is a little over the top the owners were kind so I had to be nice about my review.",UIQPEGgaIETvdY-t8uD0gA,0,0,3,fr865sYDb4poO4TQQg7AyA

The gentleman who worked their apologized for not having all the options but offered to have a plate made of kelaguen, bbq beef, and red rice which after longing some good Guamanian food I would have taken anything. And even threw in dessert on the house thanking for visit! 

Their food is authentic, just what I would find at Chamorro village in agana. Rice cooked perfectly without the dryness or hardness. Clean restaurant, nothing fancy but it gets the food cooked right with pride of island crisis one. This restaurant has the warmth of island hospitality that is so hard find here.

449710,2017-02-25,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"I'm a chamaole from Saipan. Y'all know what chamaole means aka Half-cas. Anyway, I was raised on Saipan--and, you know, we Saipanese go to Guam a lot. Anyway, I can make Kelaguen and bbq; but who has time with the mainland pace of life? I only make it on special occasions. 

When I go home to Saipan, my mom takes me out to Japanese and fancy restaurants bc she thinks I've become too American to still like chamorro food. Hello! I love chamorro food and miss the BBQs, fiestas and parties back home. So, I heard about this place and finally had the chance to give it a try.

First and foremost, my heart skipped a beat when I saw latiya on the menu. Why? Because that's pretty much my favorite chamorro dessert EVER. Next is bunelos, but they call it ""banana donuts."" I get it, we're in the mainland. So, what did I do? Oh, I just ordered both of course! And, wow. Best latiyas I EVER had in my life. No really, if you can make an IV filled with your latiya and hook me up, I'm there lol.

And, don't tell my mom but your banana bunelos is better than hers. Again, don't tell her. What about bunelos munga (mango)? Maybe in the future? That's my other favorite bunelos flavor. What about potu? :) I know, I know--gotta focus on the core menu items. Don't want to overload it. 

I ordered the fiesta plate and the rib plate. I loved the red rice, very flavorful and perfect consistency for me. The fina dene was good, but could use a tad bit more lemon IMHO. That's just my preference, so I added it myself. No biggie. I eat chicken all the time so, I didn't love the chicken--I did like it though. Maybe I wanted it with skin? But, the ribs? Oh, the ribs. Gimme gimme more, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. I LOVE the ribs. Tender, falls off the bone, marinated perfectly. Just like home. 

So, yeah, 4/5. I would hang out there, but I don't want to overstay my welcome. Anyway, if you see me, I'm so fair skinned you would think I'm just another haole--not a chamaole. So, it was fun acting like I didn't know anything lol.  But, the food hit the spot. 

I didn't try the spam musubi, but apparently it's everyone's fave. And I have to try the tatiyas, I do love tatiyas with butter. That's what we eat for breakfast in Saipan with chamorro sausage, eggs, etc... So, that will be on my list next time. I also forgot the King Car, which was my childhood drink of choice. 

Everything together was MUNGGE!

831698,2015-10-19,4,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"Out here this week for another family gathering. My family decided to try this place out again. This time was fair.

Let's say they have been open over a year an they still use a banner sign in front of the business. We were hoping for more decor improvements to represent Guam. Inside was much better made us feel like everything from back home was represented well. 
But all the other business around have nice outdoor sign of business logo & name. I think they should invest in a nice red rice sign outside like the other business around them.

The wait for a to go call still took 25-30 minutes we called in the worker who answered said 15-20 but when we got there took another 10-15 minutes so total of 1/2 an hour. Food was cold so we microwaved our food. 

I ordered the chicken plate again it was better this time not as dry & more flavor still char broiled but that was ok. I still can taste the other meats that they must cook their meats on the same grill or use the same utensils because I can taste beef when I'm a chicken eater. The rice wasn't mushy this time it was bland but better not a wet & uncooked like last time. The cucumbers were a little soggy & bitter but it's probably was soaking to long I prefer my cucumbers crisp I know some Chamorros like it marinated longer so my cousin ate the rest of my cucumbers.

Masubi was still not my cup of tea but it's so hyped up I had to try it again. I just can't really get the red rice & wrap but that's ok the kids liked it.

We tried their corn soup it was not thick a little runny but seasoned well just needed a little more corn starch to make it thick. 

Empanadas hasn't changed the mushy no chicken still so I would have to say no to this.

Had a little kelaguen I also would say needs just a little more lemon & pika. Can't taste the coconut. More like ceviche or sisig. LOL! 

Lumpia still the same not a fan but kids enjoyed it. My husband had the beef plate he said a bit better this time around not a chewy & tough but wished they served it warmer or hot when plate came out.

Latijas were good. Kids enjoyed .

All in all its continued progress & wish this business best of luck. The chamorro community is very big so you will always have critics. Keep up the good work! 

I want to give a 3-4 star but just a few more fixes then they will be there the tables weren't clean for us to wait on for our food so I went back outside to wait for our food. If dining area was clean it would of been better for us to wait in doors it was hot outside.",xGzJZ0iVEdzi0rSMteRyfw,1,0,2,sCYJak5C1XX79s2nd9dRIQ

The pork spare rib was lacking in flavor, same with the chicken kelaguen.

I would think that by now, most locals from Guam would know of this place and add it to their list of must-haves when in Vegas.

The bbq taste is going to be different than probably any you've had.  But, will you like it?!  Not kidding, you will probably LOVE it regardless of which may you choose.   It's that distinct soy sauce and lemony combo. 

And if you don't love or at least like it, then at least you can say you tried something new, right?

The husband and I shared the Fiesta plate, which included bbq, chicken kelaguen, lumpia, and shrimp patty.  My only complaints was the beef.  I thought it was a bit too dry but everything else was delicious.  I like my kelaguen with a good amount of tang and a kick of spice and they nailed it.  Not only the chicken but the octopus kelaguen as well.  

The red rice musubi definitely got my attention.  I never had red rice musubi with daigo so I was excited to try it.  It was definitely not the musubi I'm used to but definitely one I recommend.  The spicy sauce gave it a good kick.  Just thinking about it is making my mouth water and wanting more.

The sweet coconut tatiyas were nothing short of amazing.  My 13 year old and I love this stuff.  I must say, one of the best I've had so far.  

Not only is the food great, but the service was amazing.  The staff were so friendly and nice.  The owner (at least I think he was) even came out and gave my husband some denanche, which he has been wanting forever.

That being said maybe after your promo someone's hair stayed in the kitchen area ? which got into the food. So that does explain that!

Admitting you use lemon POWDER & real lemon means your employees will take the lazy way with the powder if needed which I can tell you is never the same as REAL fresh squeezed lemons. No matter which powder you use, squeeze it it's the best way you can tell the difference. As an ex-chef from GUAM I was able to right away, especially with the watery kelaguen.


Tatiyas are suppose to be round, enough said. Again lazy way is cutting it any shapes. Advice: get a cookie cutter makes it so much faster & perfectly shape.

The coconut issue is part of the kelaguen recipe & as long as you guys took to make our food 30-45 minutes. Someone could of kamyu it then , added the coconut to the kelaguen. You can't worry about leaving an important part of the recipe out because it spoils fast, this is the food industry & everything should be made fresh every day. Don't tell me you save for days ? That's not good!

As for the gas grills then that explains that NO SMOKE CHARCOAL FLAVOR in the meats! But totally understand you have to follow all rules for the building. But of course when you say GUAMANIAN food we expect island style. That starts with the Charcoal bbq like from back in the islands at any family event or bbq gathering. 

I see you didn't have anything to say on the red rice ? It's probably because I'm sure that it's not living up to the name as I seen in other reviews. Like I stated we found uncooked & hard pieces in our plates, not just mine.

Last complaint: the timing for orders is not appropriate 30-45 minutes all I can say is put yourself in the customers shoes ? Then think if you will ever want to go back. 

I hope your restaurant the best. I know it's a hard business but these few easy things can be brain stormed. We want to come support our culture & respect what you are doing but with any chamorro you know there is always good & bad reviews. We hope in a year or sooner things will get easier and better.

I ordered the beef plate with the red rice, potato salad and chicken kelaguen. I was thoroughly pleased, although my friend called and was distracted while eating. It tasted pretty homemade even though I've never had homemade food from s Guam household. Now I did order the banana donuts, just because.

1368069,2017-11-29,3,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"I grew up eating Guamanian food and it's been so many years since I last had Chicken Kelaguen. This is a side dish that is usually made with minced chicken, freshly grated coconut, lemon juice, spices and chopped scallions. I got the Hafa Adai Plate, which includes two scoops of Red Rice, one BBQ Pork Spare Rib, BBQ Chicken, Cucumber Slices with Fina'denne' sauce, Chicken Kelaguen, a Chicken Empanada, plus an extra order of Empanada and Grilled Eggplant Salad to share. 

The highlight are the BBQ Pork Spare Rib and BBQ Chicken. The meat is very tender, flavorful and it's marinated well. The Red Rice has a dry, smokey flavor and it taste okay. It's not spicy as it looks. I had to add Fina'denne' sauce on the Red Rice and mix in the Cucumber Slices to make it taste better. The Chicken Empanada didn't taste like there was chicken. The filling looks like mashed Red Rice in a Fried Crispy Tortilla Shell. And the Grilled Eggplant Salad looks similar to a creamy Tzatziki dip. It taste like smokey and mashed eggplant mixed in a tangy yogurt sauce. Now for the Chicken Kelaguen, I didn't see any freshly grated coconut mixed in and to be honest here, it taste kind of dry. So I had to add more Fina'denne' sauce to flavor the chicken. 

Overall, the meal is good to share for two people and the restaurant is clean. I'm just not happy about the Chicken Empanada and Grilled Eggplant Salad, and the Chicken Kelaguen is an acquired taste. I'm probably more accustomed to having quality flavor in Guam. But if you've never had Guamanian food and you're curious about the flavor, you should at least try it and see if it's something you like.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,4,0,3,wL_pB8wGkiged2XtwVUyxw

1488965,2015-03-07,4,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"This is my second check in for Red Rice. I didn't want to leave a review for a restaurant that just opened and I was super ecstatic that  Guam food was finally in Las Vegas again! I grew up on the island and left after graduating from JFKHS. Go Islanders! There were definitely mixed reviews, but here's my version:
1. Naming the restaurant ""Red Rice"", one must live up to its name. Red rice is a staple in Guam. The right consistency, color, and taste of red rice should be spot on. My opinion, it's just aye OKAY. 
2. Chicken kelaguin was way better than my first visit. However, too bad no fresh grated coconut and no charcoal grilled taste to the kelaguin (just like the traditional way of making kelaguin). And red onions were used versus white onions.
3. The pork ribs, sliced beef, and sliced chicken from the fiesta plate again did not have the HOT off the GRILL version which to me, would have been on the spot! Marination was mediocre.
4. Empanada version at Red Rice was not bad in taste, but color in and out was darker than the traditional empanada I remember buying them after school. To me, the most authentic tasting empanadas outside Guam is in Oceanside, Cali @ Guahan Grill. I suggest you bookmark it now! Oh, and their food - delish! 
5. Spam musubi was pretty good. Used of red rice on musubi is gaining popularity. Their musubi version also consist of yellow pickled daikon. Last but not the least, shrimp patties I had ordered twice and still no visible shrimp on hand. Lots of veggies but taste still not the same from most Chamorro mom and pop restaurants back home. 
6. On the positive side, I am glad Red Rice is available for those people who miss the food from the island. It can get busy, so just be patient to get your order right. It's a nice addition to Vegas.",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,10,3,3,_T2YB0GXkRzq0QISczn5ng

One of the sons took my order and helped me understand the menu, food, Guam and even a bit about their business after a few of my prying questions. I could tell this guy had customer service skills and could hold an engaging conversation.
It didn't take long for the food to come out but it did seem to be made to order. I got the beef plate for just under $9. It came with sliced beef, red rice, diced chicken and a little salad on the side. The one son had explained to me that their food was savory rather than sweet, which you might find in similar cuisine (I know practically nothing about Guam food/culture).   The beef was smokey and bit dry, so I added the sauce as he recommended and it was tasty. The diced chicken had a nice amount of spice to it with a bit of citrus that complimented it well. The rice ironically was my least favorite part of the dish.....but the salad. This salad was a few slices of cucumber and few leaves of lettuce with a REALLY good dressing. I literally was searching the menu to see if I could just order a salad but I didn't see one, that's how much I liked this dressing.
The customer service here was very good; even the back of house was interacting with customers. It was clean and brightly decorated and the food was solid. Although I liked the food and I'll be back to try their rib plate for sure, I give it four stars because the food didn't blow me away but it was very good.",dS04EzzFlCCFZSWhNc0w0A,1,1,4,ul-SR022Mhvun1NSBh8YXA

Granted to the average patron they probably won't understand why anyone would get excited about it, but people who are raised/born in Guam will get it. The shrimp patty was so and so.

On walking in, we ran into an immigrant from Guam who assured us that the food served here is authentic and excellent. The restaurant is located in a very small strip mall just north of the BJ's shopping center ( very easy to miss). The restaurant itself is a very small storefront. About 40% of the restaurant is an open kitchen. The rest is occupied by about 7 tables. Being first timers, my wife went with the locals plate. I went with the kelaguen sampler. The locals plate had a serving of barbecue chicken, a barbecue pork spare rib, a portion of chicken kelaguen, fried shrimp patties, and a serving of red rice. My kelaguen sampler had chicken beef and octopus kelaguen with a serving of red rice. Despite the fact that we told them we were eating in the restaurant, all of the food came in take-out boxes. Not the ideal presentation. Kelaguen is prepared by""cooking"" the meat in a lemon preparation and it is served cold. I discovered that I am not a fan of kelaguen. The octopus tasted Bland and chewy. The beef was okay for cold beef ( also a bit on the chewy side). And the chicken was also fairly Bland and flavorless. My wife's local sampler was the better of the two dishes. The pork spare rib was tasty although had very little meat on it. The barbecue chicken was okay. The fried shrimp balls  were very tasty and very enjoyable. And she also did not care for the chicken kelaguen that came in her dish. On the positive side, each of us really enjoyed the red rice. It may not be fair to give only three stars since this may be a matter of my not liking kelaguen rather than being a problem with the way it was prepared.

We were excited to have found a Guamanian (Chomorro) food. My fiance grew up in Guam before relocating back to the United States, so he missed having island food. But our excitement came to end...

We ordered:

1 Fiesta Plate Combo and 1 Hafa Adai Plate Combo... 
-The red rice was way too oily. It was also missing the green onions in it - everyone makes it differently but adding some green onions, bacon bits, and green peas to it makes it real Guamanian (Chomorro) food. 
-The BBQ chicken on both plates were dried.
- The empanada was burnt - the shell was too hard and had a burnt taste to it. 
-The cucumber Fina Dene was missing the diakon (Diago).
- The chicken kelaguen was dried, where was the coconut in this? 
-The one piece of rib on each plate was good. 
- The shrimp pattie was too dark in color on the outside but when opened it looks undercooked. 
-The red rice musubi, was disgusting. I don't see what the hype is regarding the musubi.. 
-Fina Dene was plain, no flavor. You can taste the soy sauce more than anything in this.
-The red pepper sauce (Donne dinanche) was also plain. We thought it would be spicy, but turned out plain, no spicy to it. 

Overall, our food was OK. Not the best, but just OK. One star for bringing the culture to vegas and one star for the decorations and friendliness.

The Fiesta plate is a good introduction to different dishes, but whatever you decide on, always add some red rice musubi. The food is homestyle and a touch greasy, but the pickled veggies and various sauces from the salads add acidity and balance.

The red rice itself was good. The beef and chicken were tender and flavorful. I ordered a side of daigo, which is pickled diakon radish. I just love the crunchiness, the brightness from the pickling, and the spiciness, which wasn't too much. 

We tried a couple desserts that aren't typically Chamorro (not that I know of). The Chamorro beignets could have been a little more pillowy but I did like the mango sauce. The mochi donuts were pretty good. They were coated in cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar; I preferred the cinnamon sugar.

2285259,2015-01-12,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"Im from Guam, and grew up with (Guamanian) fiesta food. 

Definitely the best Guam restaurant in Vegas, yet. 
kelaguen (chopped chicken with lemon, onions, peppers, shredded coconut bits)- good amount of heat, tang, and flavor
BBQ chicken and ribs- great marinade, properly grilled, moist, not dry
Fina'denne'(spicy soy sauce vinegar condiment) nicely made, great flavor with a perfect amount of heat and acidity

Red rice- great texture and flavor, just like home

empanada- filling is so good and spicy but not too spicy for the ones that can't handle much heat, moist and tons of bursting flavor crystals with each bite!

Latiya: love it! Simple and classic. The custard was great, smooth, rich, and not too sweet, the cake was light and moist and does not over power the custard. Perfect amount of cinnamon to spice it up. The best one I've had in a while... 

Service is amiable and good.

Thanks Red Rice! Truly captured the essence of the flavors of Guam! 

Over all:  Tastes like just like home

I minused 1 star because it takes a while before you get your food, they close at 7pm and not much parking.",VJwvYLnmFOOY5TnXRSuQ8Q,5,2,4,bs-3V4w8gF8fbmliu8sYMQ
2332572,2017-04-22,3,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"Talk about totally WELL earned five stars! It not often do five stars but without doubt everything about my first experience at Red Rice hit point for me. The thing is always wanted to try Red Rice because thinking Guamanian food like ???? Not only because never been to Guam but have no idea the dishes that would define that culture. Always enjoy checking new places and more so different ethic food. Like said not sure can truly say this is true Guam food cause never had it or been to that country. OMG. The food at Red Rice is off the charts just amazing. I barely even take the menu with one visit. 

On my first visit had the Hafa Adai Plate. It basically like mixed plate with three different types of proteins and just lot of good stuff. The way they serve the food all in to go containers reminds me of comfort food from another island the 808. Once you open the to go nothing the same but only the best Guamanian food I eve had in life. The BBQ Chicken and Pork Spare Ribs. Both grilled to perfection, nice char marks on both, perfect moist and hot on the inside. The seasonings not sure words give it justice but not traditional BBQ flavors. The Empanada, Red Rice, Chicken Kelaguen, and Cucumber Salad. I am sure that about as true Guamanian food. The Empanada was again perfect golden brown, crispy, and the filling hot. The Red Rice not sure they get the color but love the rice. Someone that lives for white rice this is another form of rice that could eat everyday. They even use that in there spam musubi!!! The Chicken Kelaguen never had cold chicken salad like that before, It pretty much all chicken. It refreshing side dish along with cucumber salad. The cucumber salad the seasoning on top is something that different then other cucumber salads. It not often every component in dish especially one with lot of parts going on. I rave about each one. Solid.

I also ordered the Chamorro Beignet. It not at all the normal Beignet thinking getting at the french quarter. It lot more heavy, not fluffy, flat different size shapes, and the sauce they drench over it. They top it off with some powder sugar. Caution since heavy one order is lot of dessert.  I enjoy it. I had no expectations cause Guam and Beignet. It would order it again.

The portions are ridiculous and really reminds me lot like plate lunches. The prices are similar very reasonable for anything on the menu. 

The service is five stars through and through...I was talking with the dad or maybe grandfather. You can tell totally family own business. The son or nephew was taking the orders and serving you. The dad or grandfather cooking came out asking me about the food. Next thing knowing asking him about the style, asking where I was from, how did I hear about this place, and just all the things tend to forgot the mom and pop family run businesses. He even asked me if like spicy and brought over some spicy hot sauce to try. 

The only thing that keep me from getting here is the hours. They close pretty early. The gentlemen talking to was saying that they were planning on expanding the hours. I love hearing that cause then can get me more Guamanian food! Not sure if more Guamanian food places around Vegas but I would start with Red Rice for SURE!!!!!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,11,8,5,daQ2c-JRt44KD_XZ6sZl1Q

2590263,2015-01-21,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"What a great find before moving to Guam. A great way to taste the culture before moving tomorrow. 

I've tried some of the food before and know a little about it and it's always good food from the heart. 

It was odd having a chicken thigh since I'm used to leaner meats like the breast. We had the chicken plate that came with red rice, kelaguen, and salad. In addition we ordered empanadas, shrimp patties and shrimp kelaguen. For I believe $1 or $2 more you can add the corn tortilla or tatiya which I think should come with it since eating just the kelaguen on its own is quite different. But things cost, and it's just a few more dollars, no big deal. 

The patties remind me of a friend who makes them and it's pretty much spot on. The empanadas were fresh and made to order which is always good. 

For $26 we were pretty full after. Reading other reviews, It really wasn't that expensive as I thought. I believe it was well priced for the amount of food given. 

The gentleman who worked behind the counter came and checked on us and gave us some pointers and things to do while in Guam. 

Missing one star for location and ease of finding the place. From the street it's hard to see an unlit banner.

2662776,2015-03-23,11,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"Hafa Adai! (""Hello"" in Chamorro)

I always had this secret desire to have Guamanian food blow up and become a foodie trend. Slowly but surely my secret dream is coming to life, thanks to Red Rice graciously opening their doors and sharing their lovely culture and unique Island cuisine with the curious Nevada palates. But honestly, you have no idea how happy we are a Chamorro restaurant opened up in Vegas (Henderson area but still close enough!)! We missed Chamorro food so much and we haven't had it in over a year! Sad day, I know. 

The food is made fresh to order, so you will encounter a minor wait; just make sure to call your order in advance if you are in a rush - Phone: (702) 912-4826. Also as of right now they are closed on Wednesdays! Here's was we ordered: 

Fiesta Plate $12.50 - It's a ton of food; definitely enough for my fiance and I to share but we got 2 orders so that we can have lunch the next day! It comes with grilled beef, chicken, a rib (all meats have a dry seasoning), fried lumpia (egg-roll), a shrimp patty, chicken kelaguen (cold chicken salad), a cucumber/lettuce salad, of course you also get Chamorro Red Rice. The rice isn't loaded with much flavor or any intense ingredient, I just enjoy the unique texture and the color is gorgeously appetizing. The rib was juicy and very meaty with great flavor, the chicken also had nice flavor, yet our least favorite was the beef - we thought it was a tad too dry for our preference. The flavorful lumpia was extra crispy (a tad too oily), the shrimp patty had nice flavor, but the best had to be the chicken kelaguen!! It is so flavorful! The best I ever had. It offered a tasty citrus brightness to the meal. Also the simple cucumber salad that comes with the combo has such a dreamy and creamy dressing, I love it. Next time, I would probably skip the fiesta plate and just get either the rib, chicken plate, or just order the amazing chicken kelaguen all to myself. Flavor rating: 4/5

We also ordered Coconut Titiyas (coconut flavored bread/thick tortillas) - which you must eat it with the chicken kelaguen, that's the right way to eat it! They pair so perfectly, I couldn't stop eating it. Flavor rating: 5/5

The red rice spam musubi is also a winning item. It's as big, if not bigger than my hand and they make it with just the right proportions of spam sandwiched between moist red rice. It appears that they also put a little bit of scrambled egg and yellow pickled daikon pickle in it as well, which is delightful! Flavor Rating: 5/5

We also tried the fried empanada, as we never had it before so we quickly compared it to a fried beef taco? Apologies in advance for our ignorance, but we are only familiar with Chilean and Mexican empanadas. Flavor rating: 3/5

Best of all we adore Chamorro culture and the lovely family that runs it! Such nice people! Get this: We got to the restaurant at 6:50 pm and the signs stated they close at 7 pm. We chose to dine in as we were starving! As we dined, it went well past 7 pm and I noticed more patrons come inside and get served with a friendly smile. My fiance and I were wondering what their actual hours are, so we asked. They said that they technically close at 7 pm, but if they have customers they will still serve them and so they close Chamorro time! How cute is that? Such a breath of fresh air. 

They really want to make you feel at home and they succeed. One of the sons Bobac, answered all of our questions about the menu in detail; he seems very business savvy and passionate about the business. After we dined, we had to make sure to compliment him numerous times on how happy we are that they are in Vegas now. He extended himself humbly and even offered us some sample of fried mochi on the house (which tasted like awesome carnival fried goodness!) We honestly didn't expect anything but the gesture is appreciated very much. We could also overhear the mother at the register, explaining the menu to some patrons that are new to Chamorro food and she was just as enthusiastic as outgoing. Such a generous and friendly environment. It truly speaks to Chamorro culture and how naturally down to earth they are.

We support them and their efforts! We also hope they last and encourage more folks to discover Chamorro food.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,19,14,5,F1RUHBa4Rkq8fmVvXcec-g

There are a few tables to eat there but the restaurant has more of a take out feel to it.  Had the breaded shrimp with the red rice and was pleasantly surprised.

The spam musubi is as good as everyone says. The red rice makes it stand out from any other I've had before. 

So why 3? The main course. The chicken is well done and juicy but, for the price, there's a lot of other better options for grilled chicken and rice.

I had the Hafa Adai plate which contains the empanadas, ribs, chicken kelaguen and grilled chicken. For those that are unfamiliar with Guam food aka Chamorro food, I strongly recommend trying the chicken kelaguen with finadeni. It is a signature Chamorro dish and it comes in either chicken, spam, shrimp, and deer (I don't think they offer the deer though). Regardless, it is a very delicious destination for lunch.

The only thing they can improve on is the waiting time. I was the only guest there and it took a while to get my food. I'm sure this is because the food is grilled on the spot and takes time, so it's not a big deal but some people might get impatient.

Here's my two cents: food was great. Tasted very authentic and now there's a place I can go to when I'm craving some red rice and kelaguen. The kimchee was also great! 

But, I think that next time, I will just order for pick up. Maybe it was the fact that they just opened, but the room for sitting is very limited. There's about 8 booths that seats 4 and one table for 6. There was 7 of us and someone had to sit in the car to eat. Yeah.... That wasn't too pleasant.

Aside from that, I really have no complaints when it came to the quality and taste of the food.

We ordered the Hafa Adai plate and Beef plate then sat down. It took about 15-20 minutes to receive our food. First of all, they gave us the BBQ chicken plate instead of the Beef plate we ordered. Upon opening the box, we were hoping it to be fresh and hot because it took quite a bit of time to ""cook"" but it was just warm food. 

The red rice overall was a pretty good recipe but I've had better. The texture and tenderness of the chicken kelaguen was good but I felt like they completely overpowered it with lemon, as if I was eating a lemon warhead. Comparing the two plates and the given the price, the portions of meat given was small. On top of that, the meat lacked flavor, was not tender and poorly marinated. The filling of the empanada seemed to be drenched in oil and greasy. The thing I did enjoy was the finadene, which added flavor to the main entree meat. 

Overall the service was something I did expect in Guam. A very genuinely nice ambiance. The owners as well as their employees were very kind and hospitable. It made me feel like I was back on the island!  

If they were able to focus just more on the flavor and taste of the food, they would have a very good restaurant. To sum it all up the food was okay, but the Guam vibe made up for the experience!

We got the hafa adai and the local plate (only difference is the empanada and the fried shrimp balls) First off, the food itself has a sense of home cooked food. Not heavy on the flavor or fancy looking, but still amazingly delicious and hits the right spot. The red rice is hard to describe, but it has a subtle taste to it that made it appealing. Adding the sauce they provide actually makes the rice taste noticeably different when compared to eating each separate components by itself. The meat was seasoned well and had a great char to it. The tangy cucumbers and shredded meat was a nice refresher to have between each bites. I personally really liked the fried shrimp balls more than the empanadas, but both were delicious.

I have never had Guam (Guaminian?) food so this was a first and didn't know what to expect. The place is located in a small plaza next to other larger plazas. I am not from Vegas so I relied on Google Maps to find this place as well. The place has a handful of booths and a larger table near the front. Looks like it is family-owned where the family is bringing their culture and food to the Vegas. I ordered the Fiesta Plate and an order of the Red Rice Musubi. The Fiesta Plate has a little of everything. BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, a rib, an eggroll (lumpia?), some type of minced pork, and marinated cucumbers over a bed of red rice. The meats were OK. The beef was really tough. The chicken was kind of fatty. The rib was OK...Of the meats, I enjoyed the marinated minced pork. It reminded me of what you would call larb at a Thai restaurant. The rice is made with achote seed to get the color and flavor. I felt the rice was overcooked and was a bit mushy for my liking. The achote seed is supposed to provide color and a hint of flavor and that was correct. The color looked great and it looked like it would pack a punch but it didn't have much flavor. For $14, it was enough food for 2 people who aren't extremely hungry. As for the red rice musubi, the rice again felt a bit mushi. The spam was fried and marinated in a sweet sauce. There was some sort of sauce in the middle which added some moisture to the seaweed and spam. It, like the Fiesta Plate, was OK. Nothing too special. The red rice didn't add much other than making it look more appetizing.

The meal was OK. The service was friendly and helpful but in all, the whole experience was just OK because of the food. Remember to check in for a free fountain drink.

The BBQ chicken and pork spare rib are great, and I love the small shrimp patty fritter. Guamanian lumpia are much larger than the Filipino ones that most are accustomed to and you get one larger piece.

4147680,2017-11-05,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"I first heard of Guamanian food from Diners Drive-ins and Dives. It looked good so I looked to Yelp to see if there were any Guamanian restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. That led me to Red Rice.

Being unfamiliar with Guamanian food I did not know what to order. The gentleman taking my order was good enough to guide me through by showing me the Hafa Adai plate. BBQ chicken, a pork spare rib, chicken kelaguen, cucumber fina denne, an empanada and red rice. I've said it before but it is worth repeating, if you don't know what to order order it all. That is what I did with the Hafa Adai plate.

It took about 15 minutes to get my food today. It was brought to my table in a styrofoam clamshell box as if to go. This is standard at Red Rice. I opened it up and was greeted by much more food than I had expected. The front compartment was packed full of dense red rice which was topped with the BBQ chicken, empanada and spare rib. The back two smaller compartments had the cucumbers and chicken kelaguen. 

I tried the BBQ chicken first. I was so pleased to taste the smoky char right up front. I've had a lot of similar BBQ chicken from Hawaiian places that just came up short. This was delicious and probably my favorite piece of this Guamanian puzzle. Next I tried the kelaguen. I was confused by it at first. Grilled chicken chopped small, mixed with green onion and served cold. It was insanely herbatious with a sour note in the background and a little spice. I wasn't sure if I was enjoying it at first but the more I ate the more I enjoyed. The rib was next. I don't typically like ribs but this was good. Not fall-off-the-bone tender but not difficult to pull off the bone with a little tug. It had the same char foward flavor as the chicken. Not a bad thing. As far as ribs go, I'd eat that again. The cucumbers were cold and crisp. Quite refreshing. I'm not sure what the dressing was but it was a little salty. Soy sauce and rice vinegar maybe? The empanada was sadly my least favorite item today. I don't know what it was stuffed with. I couldn't quite place it. The shell was over cooked. It was very crunchy and dry like a taco shell. I used the dipping sauce for the meats (soy sauce and vinegar like pot sticker sauce) to moisten the breading. That helped. Finally, the red rice. The restaurants name sake. It is cooked with achiote which gives it the red color. One could almost mistake the rice for Spanish style given the color and even the taste to an extent. But this rice is different. It has a very earthy quality. A natural sweet nutty taste. I eat a lot of rice and I've had some good variations. This was wholly unique and now one of my favorites.

I was told before I ordered that Guamanian food was similar to Hawaiian and Filipino food. I was told that some people say it is a fusion of the two. I was told it was just simply ""Guam food."" Having now tried it, I understand. There are some similarities but all the islands from which the comparisons draw are in the same ocean. Similarities are bound to occur. This is a different kind of food. And in the Las Vegas Valley it is coming from this little restaurant on Eastern. It is served by a friendly staff who tells you about the food and talks to you about you. Like a neighborhood joint in a very large neighborhood.

My favorite of all time of Chamorro food is chicken kelaguen. The flavor is outstanding! When I went I ordered the chicken plate which consisted of BBQ chicken, chicken kelaguen, red rice, salad and finadene. Seriously they give you like half a scoop of chicken kelaguen!! That was the smallest portion ever!! I was very disappointed And tastey??? Not so much... I've had waaaaaay better!! The BBQ chicken was just okay... Nothing special. 

I had ordered my daughter a chicken Nene (small/mini) plate. Tell me why my daughter had more chicken in her Nene plate than I had in my regular size plate. Not only that.... The friend I went with ordered the chicken plate too... Why did she get 3 regular size BBQ chickens in her plate and I got two small pieces?? Very inconsistent!!!! 

Also on their menu they offer white rice.... But don't ask because they don't have any. Wasn't sure my daughter would like the red rice so I attempted to order her white rice and got shot down. They don't serve it. Also don't ask for a fountain drink because their machine doesn't work. WTH!? 

Okay my last complaint... The guy at the register was still on a stool!!! Sitting on the stool and leaning with one arm/elbow on the counter as he was taking people's orders... Don't know about you... But that's very unprofessional to me. I've never been to a restaurant where a worker was sitting on a stool and not only that leaning all over the counter like he was bored.

I lied... One more complaint... The service... Takes forever! I should have timed it. But we waited a pretty lengthy time before getting our food. 

Will I return? It wouldn't be my choice... But if my friends wanted to go id go again. Other than that? No I wouldn't.",4bsOm9rmqNJzn7P7Ein9Bw,1,0,2,XQyF1VnU1V-12W9mQgGt_A

Chamorro beignet: just like a normal beignet with a drizzle of mango sauce. Pretty good.

The person at the register was probably 15 or 16 but he was really patient with us as we asked him to explain various things on the menu.  We were a little unclear with our order and ended up with the breaded shrimp appetizer instead of the breaded shrimp plate.  When we asked what was what (because we actually didn't know), the cook (and likely owner) immediately understood the confusion and cooked us a breaded shrimp plate as well.  

All in all we had the breaded shrimp appetizer: radish, shrimp wrapped in red rice and then wrapped in seaweed.  We might have ordered it by accident but it was the best thing we had. 

Octopus - cold octopus in a lemon sauce.  Very delicious.  Lots of octopus too.  Would definitely order it again.

Breaded shrimp platter - 4 lovely deep fried and breaded shrimp.  A bed of delicious red rice and a cucumber salad.  I believe that this actually comes with potato salad normally but I was happy to have cucumbers instead.

Eggplant Salad - sort of like a less smokey version of babba ganosh.  Very delicious, and nice flavor.

Cucumber and radish kimchi salad.  Only a little bit tasting like kimchi, more like a sweet daikon radish.  I like this a lot and would recommend it in a heart beat. 

Beignets with a mango sauce.  The cook (owner?) brought these out to us just so that we could try them.  I didn't even see them on the menu but they were delicious.  A nice sweet sauce. 

Ambiance is a bit dinerish but it's clean and well lit.

Until now.

OK that was a bit dramatic. Long story short, Red Rice isn't quite as good as True Island. But it's good enough.

I had the Fiesta Plate. At $12.50, it's more expensive than True Island's, but contains a wider variety of items. You get beef, chicken, a rib, some sort of seafood cake, a cold chicken salad, and a cucumber/lettuce salad. And of course you get that delicious Guamanian Red Rice (duh). I don't know what it is about that rice. It's not like it has a ton of flavor. I feel like it's mostly just color. But I enjoy it all the same.

I'll say that Red Rice's Red Rice is better than True Island's. True Island's chicken and beef were way more tender and flavorful though. And I miss True Island's awesome sauce/salad dressing. I actually don't know what it was but it was great on both their salad and for dipping the chicken/beef. It's probably unfair for me to keep comparing to True Island, but that was my first and until now, only experience with Guamanian cuisine.

The bottom line is that I'm still a fan of Red Rice and will definitely be grabbing lunch here again.

If you're from Guam and looking for that home flavor or just interested in the cuisine, give Red Rice a visit. Having everything cooked to order is worth the wait in my opinion. I can only recall one other  Chamoru restaurant in Las Vegas which closed a long time ago, but if Red Rice was open at the same time, they would have closed a lot sooner.

I was told the Tamales Gisu will only be available in a catering platter after their last run was done when I visited last week. But that's OK because I could probably eat half that platter to myself.",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,5,1,4,w4WAVbHQHDE962OeDFLJhA

5016025,2016-04-24,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"Too expensive, small portions, and dry meat are the 3 main reasons for the 1-star rating. I don't usually write reviews, but the $30 I spent here was such a waste that I instantly had to write one. I've eaten Chamorro food before when the first Chamorro restaurant opened up on Eastern Avenue several years ago. Their food was so delicious. Sadly, they kept increasing their prices and giving less food, which probably led to their demise. 

So I spent $30 buying 2 Fiesta plates, but it felt like a big ripoff.  The red rice, cucumber salad, lumpia egg roll, kelaguen chicken, and shrimp fritter were ok. I'm more upset about the meat that they gave me. The BBQ chicken was very dry. It was tasty, but I wish they used chicken thighs instead so it wouldn't be so dried up. Additionally, you would think paying $13.50 for a plate you would get more than just 7 tiny 2-inch strips of chicken. They didn't have BBQ beef so I got an extra BBQ pork rib, which were super dry. It didn't even taste fresh. It tasted like it was cooked from the night before. 

I probably would never recommend this place nor would I ever come back. I'd rather eat Korean BBQ or a Hawaiian restaurant as their BBQ is much juicier and tastier.",O7jshr9WKiURGjLr81RgtQ,0,0,1,g_tdeZivq_sl3KHE4yTmWw

First of all, there is a nice, friendly islander vibe here. Good vibes + good food = can't beat that!  

The fiesta plate has a variety of BBQ meats, including a chicken and beef, which were all marinated well. It also had chicken kelaguen which is chopped up grilled chicken flavored with citrus, onions, and peppers. It is a huge plate for someone like me, but it may not be enough to split 50/50 with someone. 

The red rice musubi is like musubi on crack. It features their signature red rice, luncheon meat, daikon, furikake, and a yummy sauce. 

The titiyas are like a tortilla/pita type bread. I've tried both the coconut and the corn. I really like the coconut titiyas, which compliment the chicken kelaguen well. 

I really want to try their desserts like: fried mochi and rosketti cookies. 

My only complaint is the early closing time. Multiple times I've stopped by and forgot they close at 7 PM.

5120280,2015-10-06,3,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"This review is for the Red Rice Musubi only.

If you like Musubi, you'll LOVE the Red Rice Musubi! This Hawai'i girl can't stop talking about it. Get it, get it, get it! 

If you don't know what musubi is, I'll give you quick lesson. It's a handmade, handheld dish made of rice (usually calrose/sticky white rice) and Spam (canned meat/luncheon meat) wrapped in seaweed (the greenish black stuff sushi is wrapped in.) It's the perfect snack, appetizer, home lunch for work or school trips, or if you need a quick bite while on the go. You get the idea. This is a favorite among the Pacific islander culture.

The Red Rice Musubi is made with luncheon meat (not the Spam brand, if you know Spam you can tell the difference). The luncheon meat was tasty, not salty. I've had homemade authentic red rice (I have family from Saipan) and this red rice is legit. Full of bold flavors. It's not spicy. 

If you love bold flavors and feeling adventurous, I highly recommend the Red Rice Musubi!  The musubi also has a mayo-like sauce in between the rice and meat. This is now my favorite musubi and the sauce is what stood out compared to the Hawai'ian style musubi. 

If you're looking to taste Chamorro food without getting a full size take out plate, this is the way to go. It's about $2-3 bucks. It's well worth it. Red rice is a rice dish that is uniquely Chamorro, you won't find it any other Asian or Pacific Islander restaurant.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,5,2,4,dH8iY0vDjeHoeOCKoLnklg

Chicken Keleguen was really close to Josie's family minus the Coconut. (Would not keep well id it had that). Red Rice Musubi was really good had pickled Daikon in middle adding great bold taste and also a little bite that came back on the palate. The Empenada was really good also having a bit of heat to it.

They weren't kidding about that red rice. The rice infused with the spice, meat and sauce made it all melt in my mouth. I could have made a meal of 10 of those. 

Our entree came out soon after finishing finishing our musubi's. I'd like to take a minute to thank the staff at Red Rice and heir consideration for my cousin's shrimp allergy. Their empanada that came with the meal, were told, was actually fried in shrimp oil. They fully separated it from our actually entree in order to avoid cross contamination.

I lived on Guam for three years and I instantly fell in love with the red rice and empanadas so I was thrilled to find out about this gem. The red rice is perfect just like I remember. They also make the empanadas fresh when you order them so it is a bit of a wait but totally worth it! So crunchy and full of flavor. The workers here are super friendly and always have a smile on their faces. I got a bbq platter plate and everything in it was spectacular. I highly recommend this place.

5463859,2015-01-06,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"Red Rice serves the best chicken kelaguen!  

I am Chamoru and grew up eating Chamoru food and this place by far has the best chicken kelaguen I have ever had.  I ordered the Grand Opening Plate which had 2 scoops of red rice, 1 scoop of chicken kelaguen, 1 lumpia, 1 shrimp patty, house salad (it was a choice between potato salad, grilled eggplant with coconut milk, or cucumber salad), bbq chicken, 1 bbq pork rib, bbq beef and a side of dipping sauce for the meat. The red rice was as it should be, orange-reddish color and not dry or too wet with a subtle flavor of achote which definitely complimented the other items on the plate.  The bbq chicken was my favorite out of all the bbq.  Grilled eggplant with coconut milk was just like my mom used to make, creamy and somewhat smoky with a slight citrus twist.  

I went to Red Rice for dinner during their grand opening and though there was a bit of a wait, it was understandable.  The service was great though.  They apologized for the wait and even gave me 10% off my next visit which is a plus because I will be back.  The only con was the limited parking but I didn't mind walking over from the adjacent plaza.  

Red Rice definitely does Guam proud!",EssHQrB6Lr1vNuSMrgacrg,3,3,5,Htg3mjFjFjlSJKkRkylFUA

When I was younger, I used to go to this Guamanian restaurant called True Island BBQ that closed down a few years ago. Throughout those few years, I missed eating red rice because there were literally no other places that served Guamanian food in Las Vegas. When Red Rice opened, I was ecstatic that Vegas had another opportunity to have Guamanian food!

My favorite dishes to get are the chicken plate and the red rice spam musubi! The chicken is very flavorful, and the red rice is definitely on point! Next time, I want to try their chicken kelaguen since it is a specialty from Guam! I've only had chicken kelaguen once when my friend made it, so I definitely want to try Red Rice's!

The price is reasonable for what you get although I would want it to be a tad bit cheaper.
This is the only Chamorro food here in Las Vegas so it does remind me a lot of my childhood days when I used to live in Guam. They are pretty consistent with the taste of their bbq, the red rice and their famous chicken kelaguen. Only wish is if they can open another location possibly closer to where I live since I'm way up in NW Las Vegas.

5574373,2015-01-04,4,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"So sllllloooowww. Ordered a fiesta plate,
Beef kalaguen, and a spam musubi. Waited almost 50 minutes for it. So don't go when it's busy. Or order ahead.  

Summary: long wait time. skip the grilled meats and get the other items. 

Onto the plate: Sub the salad if possible it's a throwaway and makes the fiesta plate feel like it's not worth the price. 

Can the red rice can be more red? If eaten with the meats it gets lost. And the meat just tastes like grilled meats. The beef and pork was tough. Chicken was the best. The chicken kelaguen was good reminded me of larb. But the best thing were the shrimp patties! Crispy outside and tender in the center. 

Beef kelaguen was nice (like beef ceviche) and one of the better things i had. Ordered it with yummy corn (+1$) titiya(tortilla) 

Spam musubi was good but again would be better if the red rice was more spiced or however they make it. Tasted like any other musubi.

5593960,2016-05-13,1,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"Hafa Adai... I love Guamanian cooking and was pleased to hear another Chamorro restaurant had opened along Eastern. I really loved the other Guamanian restaurant that was in the area a few years ago. I even became friends with one of the owners even though I was an out of towner. Sadly it closed up shop a while back and I've been missing the cooking ever since. 

We flew in from the Los Angeles area on the first flight of a rain soaked Las Vegas morning. We got there a little after they opened and was stuck on the menu for a little while before we were approached by a young man for our order. I had the hafa adai plate which came with bbq chicken, bbq spare rib, empanada, chicken kelaguen, cucumber fina dene and that red rice ($11.95). It was a huge meal. A tasty one at that. The red rice was great. There was plenty of it. The bbq chicken was good. I liked it. The bbq spare rib was very good. I could have another of those easily. The empanada was so good. It was different from what I typically know as an empanada. It was deep fried and was filled with tasty, stewed meat. The chicken kelaguen is cooked in lemon juice and coconut milk. It's served cold. The fact that it was cold took me a while to get used to but the flavors are good. It has a very strong flavor. I loved the cucumber fina dene. I could eat that every day. So good. Pickled cucmber deliciousness. This plate is big and can easily be shared by 2 people. I recommend it.

I loved the red rice musubi ($2.95). It comes with red rice, furikake, daikon, spam of course and a spicy sauce. It was so good. Loved the taste combination and red rice in a musubi?!? My mind was blown. It took spam musubis to another level. 

We also ordered a breaded shrimp plate ($8.75) which came with 2 scoops of red rice and potato salad. And as a treat to our friends that were stuck at Bellagio with their kids and couldnt make it to Red Rice, we brought them all back red rice musubis. They loved it. Even my godsons ate them up. So the red rice musubis were definitely a hit.

In eating at Red Rice, I felt at home and that's a big a compliment I can give any place that serves any type of islander cuisine whether it be Filipino, Hawaiian or Chamorro cooking. They play island reggae and that is the type of music I want to hear when I'm eating that kind of food... I also met the owner, the patriarch of the family. He was very gracious and we had a good conversation. He told me how he loved cooking and grilling for family and friends and the choice was made to try and make it a business. He said that everyone in the family had a hand in the restaurant and I have to respect that. I wished him and the business much success and told him I would spread the word and make sure to stop by every time I'm in town....

5612888,2015-03-17,1,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"Born and raised on Guam, left with the hubster and kids in 2004 for DC, where my friends and I don't indulge in making local favorites often enough. So when I got the opportunity to go to Vegas on business, a visit to Red Rice topped the To Do list.

Blanched at the prospect of a $30 cab fare from the strip, so I decided to take the city bus - not a journey to be taken lightly for a sissified island girl gone soft after 10 years in the northern VA suburbs. 

Two buses and an hour later, I walked through the doors and got a taste of home - from the super nice folks behind the counter to the tangy OOG marinade on the barbecued meats to the smoke wafting through the restaurant from the grill. Ordered the fiesta plate and a slew of sides to take back to my hotel (sweet titiyas, spam musubi with red rice, guyuria, shrimp crackers and lemon powder for making kelaguen back  in VA).

For those coming here complaining about this and that, get over it. Your memories of the food on island are colored by your own personal experiences...kelaguen is made different on every fiesta table, no one is going to make empanadas like your grandma or auntie. Yes, you may be going into a restaurant hangry but that doesn't mean you need to give attitude - in person or online - to hardworking folks trying to make a decent living in this economy.

To anyone from home visiting Vegas and feeling mahalang, it is worth an hourlong bus ride from the strip through sometimes sketchy neighborhoods. The cultural shift from glitz to grim on the way will humble you back to your island roots.

Food: 5
Ambience: 3
Service: 3

Average out to 3.6 stars but the food is good and that's what it's about. 

Food: I ordered the fiesta plate, coconut titiyas, and red rice musubi 
Fiesta plate comes with red rice, bbq rib, chicken kelaguen, cucumber fina dene, bbq beef, bbq chicken, shrimp fritter and an egg roll. 
So when I opened the container my first thought was ""well damn not that much food for the price"" but I seriously don't know what the heck I was thinking. Individually the portions are not much but collectively I couldn't finish and had a little snack left for later. 
The red rice was really tasty and there was enough to eat with the meats. Bbq rib was a little dry and tough- was my least favorite. Chicken kelaguen was everything I thought it would be lol. I can't even explain it but it was exactly what I expected in my little food fantasy. Totally yum and must eat it with the coconut titiyas. Cucumber fina dene was good- light and refreshing with a light tang. I could seriously eat it every day. Bbq chicken was tender and good. The egg roll and shrimp patty was eh. Not my favorite.  
The musubi was ah-mazing!!!! They take your everyday musubi and make it incomparable. Seriously. Like I don't even enjoy regular musubi anymore. They totally ruined it for me. The flavor combination of red rice, crunchy veggie, spicy sauce and spam is a happy symphony in my mouth. 

Ambience: typical strip mall location with booths against one side and the cooking on the other. They have some island decor happening and happy music playing. 

Service: this is where it got funky. It wasn't a service issue for me but more of a time issue. I think they were either backed up with orders or didn't have enough manpower behind the counter. Either way my food was supposed to be ready in 25 mins and the wait ended up being 45 mins. Both times I went I waited over 40 mins. No Bueno for anyone with a short lunch. Thankfully I'm not on a time crunch but the hubs was a little irritated by the wait. 

The peeps there were super nice and even explained to me what each dish was and how to pronounce it properly. 

I just wish the wait was not as long and they were open a little later but really this will not stop me from returning and does not take away from the fact that they have bomb a$$ food.

Definitely enjoyed the familiar flavors, especially when we were having it with a few of my friends from back home (Guam) at our 20th high school reunion.  As always, good or bad, Guam food is always comfort food to me. Red Rice was sort of in the middle of the pack for me.

Hubby got the chicken plate while I went full throttle and got the Fiesta Plate.  Favorite things on the plate:  grilled chicken and bbq beef.  Kelaguen was ok (mine's better) and the shrimp patty was kind of mushy in the middle.  I saved my rib for last but it was just too tough for me...lotsa gnawing! I would have liked the rice slightly more al dente (but it wasn't mushy).

We did nosh on the empanada - one of my fave foods from home - and ended up taking four of them to go.  Although I ate them later that day cold, they really are best when super hot.

When I first mentioned my craving to my boyfriend, he found and brought me to some empanada places but they were more hispanic or spanish style. They were good but not the same flavor I was craving. There are just no chamorro places in LA.

We made a trip to the Hoover dam and vegas area, and I decided to look up chamorro food and found this place. Got the plate with empanadas in it, and brought some home also.

The chicken kelaguen, finadeni, and red rice were exactly like the ones from my childhood. The meat was delcious and reminded me of our class fundraisers - selling hot plates next to the beach on a weekend morning. Good times.

He raved about the food and although I had already eaten somewhere else, he made sure to save me some so that I could see where he was coming from. I came back to the hotel to a spam musubi, breaded calamari (or was it fish? I can't remember) musubi, chicken kelaguen, red rice and cucumber finadene.

Ok so I know I said I had just eaten but the food smelled so good I had to take a bite. That bite led to more bites and then I somehow I ended up finishing his food. Oops! It was that good... The red rice, chicken kelaguen and the cucumber complimented each other really well! The citrus flavors of the kelaguen plus the soy sauce/vinegar flavors of the finadene really brought out the subtle flavor of the red rice. I'm salivating just thinking of it.

It was so good that boyfriend and I came back together the next day as a farewell meal before we headed back to Cali. Los Angeles really needs to open up a Chamorro restaurant!!",IIWHna9uYk87yIuPJhwOAA,10,6,5,faNzx31XtiQaW0vw_sdJ-A

The food tasted good, service was a little slow. I do like their red rice spam musubi, which I did not expect it to be spicy. We also ordered the BBQ combo, Chicken Kelagan, Beef Kelagan and a Kelagan combo, roasted eggplant. They were all tasty, but quite acidic. We thought it would come with rice or side but it was just the dish itself. By the time we wanted to go back and ordered more rice there were a lot of customers in line already. The portion were kind of small, we spent over $65 for 4 of us and still left hungry.",tOY3WLorYiO1zBOsl6QYLQ,1,0,3,WzlfZf5bUUns0wY78Oz6HA

5908520,2017-09-02,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"The location isn't too bad, it's on Eastern located in a small shopping plaza. The parking is good. But I do imagine they might be a little harder when it's gets packed!  The inside of the restaurant is small and cozy, decorated to a tee, I love the idea that you can buy some novelty and snacks for the road.  
This is my first time trying the food and I actually liked it, it was different and had some pretty good flavors.  My absolute favorite was there musbi, there's was different than your usual one, they integrated it with the red rice.  I wasn't too sure about trying these bad boys, but I am glad I did, they are now my favorite and I don't think I could eat another plain one.  So they totally got me on that! 
I love the beignets, they were not too doughy and had the right texture, the Mango drizzle made them ever tastier, I found myself eating and eating till they were all gone, I would suggest ordering more then one if you have to share.
They're other selections were good, I really liked the empanada, it was pretty good, the filling was tasty and the masa they used made them a perfect texture, I definitely wished I had more than one. 
I do wanna come back and try more of there dishes! They seem to take pride in there restaurant, food and customers. I over heard one of the employees saying they clean up every day and make sure to do a monthly deep cleaning, and they come in everyday at 10am to start prepping and cooking when customers come I .  So they really take pride in there business and customers.",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,3,0,4,KpyloUjV4jtU4CVZzrBDXg
5927189,2017-12-16,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and found that it was well worth the wait. The portions were ample and well seasoned.  I enjoyed the barbecued chicken and the musubi was a yummy surprise. The fiesta combo is a good way to acquaint yourself with this fusion style cuisine.,yIIDnKI9-AuKGyEVE9sQZA,3,0,4,RIbvretBKD66Tdzq-lNanA
5952527,2015-04-15,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"The food, the ambience and service were all GREAT! I was greeted with ""Hafa Adai"" when I walked in, so it felt like home. There were Chamorro videos and pictures of landmarks in Guam placed throughout the restaurant, as well as island music playing on the stereo. The wait wasn't long, but the woman behind the counter kindly offered some mochi donuts to us for free while we waited for our food. I ordered the Hafa Adai Plate and that comes with BBQ ribs, kelaguen, empanadas, salad, red rice which goes for around $11. The plates are a good size and I was fully satisfied! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is either from the Marianas or would like to try Marianas cuisine",bUPNGvJAamWVPiH4H42O4A,1,0,5,O-VvzBQwIOXJpA30l6S11Q
5955017,2015-04-05,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"I got the Hafa Adai plate and my honey got the Fiesta plate. It was so good! It has been awhile since I've gone to any Fiestas and I miss the food. This place taste just like the food at the Chamorro BBQs. They have a kelaguen sampler and it was good. The finadene and rokkyo were good and the spam musubi with the red rice was the bomb! The empanadas were very tasty. They also make their own titiyas!
Not to mention, half way through the meal, I saw someone I knew cooking in the back so I know the food is always on point.",6UQlnFvSr5dUJuy0RA-M2Q,1,0,5,6Nyc9TMTQ1kbJlH-7ncFYg
5958661,2017-07-28,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"Red rice is a must! If you're ever in Vegas and looking for a flavorful place to eat, I highly recommend this one. This restaurant offers full authenticity of Chamorro food as well as hospitality! One of my favorite sides to order is the Spam musubi with red rice-such an awesome and creative combination! The rice plates alone offers great portions with reasonable prices! Although this place can get super packed, it is well worth the wait and experience! 

I've recommended this restaurant to many people since my first visit and people seem to love it. I don't blame them!",wSOZ1s4U1lHABwth4P7a5Q,2,0,5,xoTZDxOzmd2nDjNZxd_QHg

5993791,2016-12-20,0,SDtIdchX9WpKlH5Yst8kjQ,"When I'm craving a taste of home (Guam), but I'm not in the mood to cook - this is definitely my go to place!

The decor is reminiscent of the restaurants and eateries I remember sitting in as a child, the sounds of reggae music fill the room, pictures of Guam flash on the TV screens and warm friendly familiar smiles are everywhere you look. Nostalgia, check!

I never really order anything in particular because I crave different foods each time. My favorites are the empanada, titiyas, shrimp patties, BBQ chicken, and the pickled goods (in jars on the counter). My kids love the red rice masubi, and bagged fried shrimp chips. And, of course there's also the scrumptious desserts. Amazing food, check!

You really can't go wrong with anything you try here. So, whether you're craving a taste of home, want to try something new, or want a warm ""home cooked meal"" - Red Rice most definitely can check all those boxes. It's definitely a must - you won't be disappointed, that's for sure!!!",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,10,0,5,tCVS24IdmExbvk6gpqeM5g
