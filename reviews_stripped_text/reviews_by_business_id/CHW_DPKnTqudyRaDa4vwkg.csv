I used to travel alot and Mcdonalds was always the ""go to"" fast food restaurant for us. Always consistant food and fast convenient service.

This branch is a very poorly run store. The last few times I have gone thru the drive thru the man taking the order was very rude. (the same person i think).. Could not seem to awnser any questions or be polite in any such way. And the food was sub par.

Two nights ago, we went to grab a quick snack wrap.. We were greated by a big man who had a very poor attitude. I thought maybe he was just having a bad night?? As we pulled to the counter to grab our order a car from the drive thru went around us to leave. He actually yelled at the man who takes orders that he needed to learn how to treat customers. I then knew that the rudeness that was suspected was not just my imagination.. 

Tonight was the absolute last time I will ever go here.. We went thru the drive thru around 12:00 AM and for some reason the man who normally takes the order said that they would be closed for 15 minutes for a break??? This is supposed to be a 24 hour location. I wasn't sure if he said 15 or 50 minute break so I asked him when they would re-open to have him yell 15 back in the headset? Some seriously bad service. 
 
I will pass the word on that this location has inconsistant food and horrible service. The management at this fast food branch should be fired as well as the employees who seem to think that yelling at customers and treating them poorly is okay to do.",hvZ5o9YNJJ-TVCcdT42VoQ,0,0,1,5Qu2S5FWyXz1pp1s55AbZg

Example: I had lost my job, my wife, and my car, and a friend of mine picked me up on the side of the road, but not before I was forced to suck a dick for the $2 that would give me the moolah to afford a single pleasure in this meaningless world: a medium fry from THE KING of fast food, Ronald ""Firecrotch"" McDonald. We drove to this establishment, as it was nearest to the drug den that I had just left. Purple haze ringing in my nostrils and Nickelback blaring from the Hummer H2 behind me, I ordered my delicacy. Upon arriving at the window, I was shocked to find that the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to people who were born sideways with three umbilical cords wrapped around their extra chromosome. Good job being progressive giants, McDonalds. UNFORTUNATELY, this coke bottle glasses-wearing invalid decided to give me, a man with nary a possession to his name, a medium fry trapped indecently in a complex puzzle box constructed from bags that had clearly formerly hosted the cursed sperm sample that grew his hairy greasy ass in a test tube in Santa Monica. I was speechless, but since I couldn't afford a drink, a fire in the hole was not possible and I had to suffice with a middle finger held aloft by my comrade in my defense against this venerable Smaug of the culinary industry.

3321967,2014-12-19,3,CHW_DPKnTqudyRaDa4vwkg,"I went to this location a couple of weeks ago. This is how my visit went:

I pulled in the drive thru a few minutes before 10:30am just in time for breakfast. 
I was the only person in the drive thru so I pulled right up to the menu
I waited for someone to take my order at the speaker but no one said anything
Finally an employee with an headset walked out of the back room of Mcdonalds
I figured this was because the order speaker was broken or something
But no, the employee walked over and flipped the menu from breakfast to lunchtime
I was thinking in my head .... whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
Keep in mind, my car is right there, I'm obviously waiting to order.
Then the employee turned around and walked back into McDonalds
Then someone started taking my order over the speaker
I ordered my breakfast items. which they informed me they were no longer serving. 
I was thinking in my mind ""do you not think I just saw you walk out and turn the menu, I mean my car was like 2 feet away from you""
Anyway, I was craving breakfast, so I let them know I wanted to cancel my order
I was told the breakfast hours were over
Then ... magically ... like a Christmas Miracle, they had breakfast for me.

Truth is I was willing to leave McDonalds with out my breakfast food. I have a rule for myself. I never fight with people that make my food behind closed doors. Yea, maybe paranoid but sadly its a reality. So I was completely polite about canceling my order. I do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast items. Where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service. That conversation of them no longer serving breakfast was one we should have never had. Implying that my order was an inconvenience when clearly It shouldn't have been. 

So then, i went back a few days later (because I'm the type that gives second chances) and they missed a few items that I had ordered. Meaning I ordered them, saw it on the drive thru order menu screen, paid for it and it wasn't in my bag when they gave me my order.

Yea, this is a long review, I would honestly be surprised if someone read down this far. Props to you if you have. But the whole reason behind it is that I am just super tired of getting terrible customer service and paying for food that I don't get. The reason this review is only 1 star is because I have given this place multiple visits and keep coming up with the same problem. Bad customer service.",nEa5Rdj_vHrAJ3Y0dxRGig,2,1,1,_4UPils4ytIgxZ4o2Y72Aw

3872746,2016-07-24,1,CHW_DPKnTqudyRaDa4vwkg,"This location needs new supervision. I'd say about 8/10 orders I receive from this location is wrong or they just don't put the order together completely. Last 3 orders have been missing something. On one order, we ordered a fairly large order, about 8 different burgers. Of those, we asked for one Big Mac with no cheese. They didn't put cheese on ANY of them. In fact one we got ended up being a quarter pounder with just the bun, patty and pickles, nothing else. Nasty. 
The other complaint I have is half the time, the attitude is far from friendly. I wouldn't say rude, just that couldn't be bothered kind of attitude, and that probably contributes to the messed up orders. 
Some people think that this kind of work deserves $15/hr. Those people are delusional. It's not the type of job that deserves that. Most people working at McD's are kids or students. Some management positions maybe, but not the average employee. Paramedics, paralegals, and other more important type of jobs don't pay that much. 
Still have problems. This is a complaint for July 21, 2016. Ordered a few things. One was a plain fish filet, then a couple Big Macs and a couple mcdoubles. 
First the filet. Specifically ordered a plain Filet o Fish, even saying to them 'all I want is the fish and the bun.' Got everything, tarter sauce, cheese etc. 
So I asked them to fix it, again saying specifically how it should be- just the filet and the bun. Nothing else. So this time it had cheese on it. Really?!??!!! Luckily, the third time was the charm. 
Next the Big Mac. They forgot that middle piece of the bun when they were putting it together, so they just put it on top, then put the 'lid' piece on top of that. Wow. 
It is clear that this location will never bother to fix their employee problem. I went back and read other reviews about this location, and it is staggering to me that after numerous complaints about the same reoccurring problems, they still haven't fixed the problems yet. I figured with a big company like this, all of these complaints would have made corporate management step in and make the necessary changes. A lot of corporate chains have stipulations where corporate HQ will fine the franchise owner, or if bad enough, force them out of the company. 
CORPORATE, if you are reading this, I would advise you to step in and fix this location. It is a complete and utter mess.",q5j3gxZbF_qCviRctL9wzg,1,0,1,scCcy8AIeo3JjmtVK1Rbww

I just find it surprising the skinny-richie-constant work-outie people up here in Summerlin keep this place busy!  I mean literally not even a block away is Lifetime Fitness!  That place is hardcore.

Food = OK.  Service = OK.  Fast and efficient as a colonoscopy.  Really nothing of greatness at this McDonald's.  Really run of the mill.  We often visit this location if we are staying in the nearby Red Rock Casino.  Although I would suppose this location stays steadily busy is in part because of the tourists that stay at the Red Rock as well and want cheap eats while on vacation.  Gotta make up for all those lost wages!

Newest thing at McDonald's is their health-conscious Egg White 'Delight' McMuffin.  Definitely a healthier take on their breakfast menu.  And yes, I fell for that damn $1 coupon conveniently stuck to my McDonald's bag and tried one.  Myself being a bit of a health nut can't complain.  This egg white creation is pretty tasty.  Grilled egg whites, Canadian bacon (eh?), and white cheddar all on a toasted English muffin?  All for only 250 calories?  Yeah for a dollar I really liked it.  But at the regular price of almost $3?  I would have probably passed.  With coupon for $1 and a $1 coffee it made for a nice meal on the small scale of economy.  I almost, ALMOST, added a $1 hash brown.  Luckily I passed and decided to save my money & calories for later.

Other than that, I think majority of people around the world know what McDonald's offers on their menu.  If you don't, dang, you must be living under a rock?

We dropped by the McDonald's at 10290 W. Charlston Blvd., Las Vegas, NV 89135 for a refill. I went into the McDonald's for refills for my wife and I. As I approached the drink area, I was confronted and informed by an African American male employee that I was not allowed to get refills. He was very rude and abrasive. He indicated that he was the Customer Service Manager. I explained to him that I had never heard of this policy. My wife and I have been buying drinks at McDonald's for years and always get refills. He let me know that a customer can get as many refills as they would like while in the building but once they leave the building then they cannot get a refill. I explained to him that if that was the policy then the other locations are not following the policy. His location is the only one. He said that he did not care what the other locations were doing. This was the policy and he would not let me get refills. 

As I left the McDonald's, I told the manager that he just lost my business. He said that was fine and did not seem to care about that. Yet, he is the Customer Service Manager which is poor customer service. I went down the street to another McDonald's and got our refills and no one bothered me. McDonald's is not consistent in their policy. 

I placed a complaint with McDonald's Corporate. They had a Director of Operations give me a call about the complaint. She apologized for the experience but was very vague about their policy. At no time did she offer me a free meal or coupons, nothing. Based on the way I was treated at this McDonald's, I would not recommend this McDonald's location to anyone.

When I pick up breakfast for the office- this is usu the place- but just to warn every1, I think going in is faster- but if you have a big order, you may get the stink eye from the other customers- just pretend to read the newspaper- or cont yelping to avoid eye contact!",4I2W5ZQpm90z0oqva7qsbw,0,0,4,hcKQSOK-essIHZqbz2YSpQ

McDonalds has the best kids meals and playplaces so for my seven year old this is a great place.  Love the apple slices and much smaller fry bags for the kids.The sundays are good and the recently added smoothies are great.  Very disappointed in the new popcorn style chicken. It is worse than KFC's popcorn chicken was before they made larger pieces.  In fact, most of my box was just fried coating with little or no chicken.    As fast food places go, I find McDonalds the most consistent in quality and taste.  I love their breakfasts and the chicken nuggets are still the best.  Avoid the angus burgers.  They are not as good as advertized.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,0,0,3,QYpLl33N0H9yVty3XAiq8Q

I'm here with 4 kids, and guess how many employees offered to help me with my order or my drinks? ZERO! Why come to a fast food joint, so you have to do all of the work?!",idDKKUuShcMilsumMKh1DA,0,0,1,NnxkbGnWQvtzowGDCRPl9Q

5688144,2016-06-04,3,CHW_DPKnTqudyRaDa4vwkg,Kid wanted McDonald's and first off the fries are not fresh and the oil tastes old. The nuggets i ordered made fresh yet they still had an old taste to them. My kid loves sausage mcmuffins so I got two as well and they are burnt on the edges and sooo freaking hard to bite into.  Ridiculous. And we are dining inside while I watch these women in the back make food carelessly I have flies all over my food I don't even want to finish it so we will leave now. I really want to tell the manager how upset I am but he's a kid and I doubt a kid will satisfy my displeasing demeanor. I can say after my last debacle  here I will never return to this location I don't care if it's close to me. Id rather go to Boca park last time I was here I can't remember what my big issue was but the head manager called me apologized to me and sent me a few business type cards with a few free items I never came to get because I was so turned off by this location.  Just get better and care about the food you give people please. I worked at McDonald's when I was 15-17 and I know they have ethics and values just wondering why it's so lost in this location,I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,3,4,2,rOwnZSuVhmVH9hysPUVhVg
