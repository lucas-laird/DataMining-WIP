I also had a coupon for a free 12"" cheese with purchase of the XL and even though in not generally a fan of thin crust, it was just as delicious! 

Phone service was friendly, helpful and the pizza arrived on time!

40998,2014-10-18,0,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,Rosie is an excellent server! We look forward  to coming into the restaurant but for about the last 2 months the food has not been up to standards we have seen in the past. The pizza is way too saucy and has too much corn meal on the bottom. We are regular visitors to this Rosati's but our last 3 visits have not been the same as we experienced in the past. Has management changed or are there new cooks? We want rosati's to return to what real Chicago style pizza is suppose to be! I hope the kitchen can work out the flaws!!!,Pl6oWq4eP21clhhCKZaJEw,0,0,2,1qp0f1Dpb9AXpmPJIDSeGw

It seems like each visit brought a decline in food quality.  For example, at one point the salad dressing was the best italian dressing I'd ever had.  It tasted home made.  Now it tastes like store-brand dressing.  Cheap.  

The last few pizzas we ordered were soggy and one had almost no cheese.  I miss the Rosati's from the days of yore.  We will not be returning.  For a great deep dish Chicago-style pizza we'll be eating at Chicago's up the road.",tHStf1qlliRe8iCcxjwK-Q,0,0,2,nvKhMrgwm7Tk9QYk3LU4UQ

We ordered delivery, when the food arrived, we were surprised. Everyone liked it and we will order delivery again.
The pizza came hot, neat, all toppings on the pizza.,( not like what one of the reviews said) The sauce was delicious. The pizza was exactly how we ordered it. And the pasta dish was good as well.

We've ordered here dozens of times but they are often inconsistent.  They cut the pizza into squares when you ask for pie cut, the pizza is often oozing with too much oil, etc.  When they do get it right, it's definitely worth the price.  Plus, it beats ordering from more mainstream chains...

They've forgotten items we ordered for delivery a couple of times.  The driver was quick to retrieve the missing items so no biggie. It's really the girl who answers the phones that's unapologetic and have the personality of a rock.

We quickly learned to start ordering online to avoid speaking with her.  She rushes on the phone, doesn't try to solve issues in a positive manner (i.e. too quick to offer refund for missing item when we paid cash and doesn't offer any apologies), treats customers without any respect and is just plain unpleasant.

I'm a cheese fanatic and from the first bite the texture was all wrong. You couldn't even taste the cheese it was all sauce. Ick! The crust was good and the overall taste was just above average so in fairness I will order a regular pizza from them to see if that is to my liking.

721967,2013-12-03,0,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,"I ordered over the phone for delivery, everything seemed to go smoothly.

I ordered two pizzas, the first one was black olives and pepperoni with alfredo sauce instead of pizza sauce, it was decent. Not the greatest I've ever had but not bad by any means.

The problem came with the second pizza. I had ordered a Cheesy Beef pizza w/ hot peppers which was supposed to have an au jus gravy type sauce instead of pizza sauce. I ordered this straight from the menu without changing anything at all. The pizza I received was a cheese pizza with green peppers, that is it. It had no beef on it, the peppers were wrong, and it had regular pizza sauce. I checked the receipt and sure enough they had it down properly as the Cheesy Beef pizza. It cost me $23 when the pizza I got was sold at around $16-17 on the menu.

I didn't bother calling them back to get it fixed because I don't feel like the delivery driver should have to pay for the cooks mistake by wasting his gas. I will never be ordering from Rosatis again because of this. The price of the pizza puts it in the premium bracket and yet the service is definitely lacking if they can't even make a pizza correctly off their own specialty menu.",CFty6Jcr-wprzBWvd5cWKg,0,0,2,VecZbSWIx92_XTU4QKPA0A

First let me say, the only place I've ever had great Chicago-style pizza is actually in Chicago. The Chicago-style pizza here was ok but definitely not comparable to Giordano's or Lou Malnati's. The pizza should recieve 3 stars, and the breadsticks served before meal should be 4 stars, but the service should really only be 1 star.
We walked in and the 2 girls at the front didnt even say ""hi"". I had to ask if we seat ourselves and she then says ""no, how many?"". She takes us to our table and then drops off menu and walks away. I don't think she was rushing anywhere important as there was only 1 other table eating inside. 
Once we recieved our pizza, she didn't stop back until I was well into my 3rd piece...I then asked for a box and she dropped check off. She was quick to come back to get paid but that was her only moment of urgency our entire meal.

906208,2010-08-24,0,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,"A couple of co-workers and I decided to stop in because we heard that they were doing a pizza buffet lunch at this location. We arrived 25 minutes before the lunch buffet was going to shut down. As we sat down we were assured by the waiter that they were making more pizzas and there would be enough. True to his word they did eventually make enough pizzas and we left after our fill. 

BUT that was not enough to overcome my biggest gripes about the experience. 

1. When you go to a buffet type experience you expect there to be food on the buffet.. 

Having to fight with other patrons over pizza slices is not a fun thing. It just sets up the unpleasant situation where your fighting for every slice and then the whole pizza is gone in 60 seconds. And really, who doesn't hate the douche bag who takes more than one slice in this situation.

2. Rosati's is known for their deep dish Chicago pizza, but they don't serve it on the buffet.

Wow, I asked about this one and they said that they can't justify the cost of putting deep dish on the buffet. WHAT? Why even bother to do the buffet if your going to be cheap about it. If we had known that before we started eating, we would have just ordered a pie and skipped the buffet.  Up the price a couple of bucks per person and put the deep dishes out, I would gladly pay it. 

3. The buffet itself was kinda sparse. I probably would not have noticed it except for I was waiting for pizza. There was salad, only two types of dressing, some pasta, sauces, meatballs and Italian sausages. They have a huge menu, it just felt limited.

Now the food was good and the service was attentive, but take my advice order delivery until they fix this.",zFszUTKwfFIWK6EAYCyR7Q,1,0,3,xEJkq526pTb_wCAz-4WzvQ

1128958,2017-08-27,0,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,"Uldate on update: changing the star to a 4. The owner of this venue contacted me. They thanked me for my feedback and explained how they are going to use it to improve in the future. How cool?! 

Even more cool - we ordered our usual again a couple weeks ago. The delivery arrived with a zeroed out bill. They not only honored the credit they initially offered, they added to it and I didn't even mention it. Bravo for turning this experience into a positive!!! 


Update: changing the star from 1 to 3. Manger Bill called me this morning. He apologized for the incident and took ownership (regardless that the cashier may have been inexperienced). Bill wanted to credit back the entire order, but asked if we would accept a store credit because it was already processed. We agreed. After he apologized again he said something critical, ""I hope that you remain our customer."" 

Look I am a business owner and understand things happen. I still feel like this all could have been diffused but that's ok. Bill made the call (never easy) and I believe he is sincere. Thank you for the acknowledgment. 

This is the first negative review I have ever written. I'm starting with this point to establish just how bad my experience was. And the tragic part is that it could have been avoided multiple times before it got to a point where I was inspired to share this experience. 

We have been Rosatti's customers for years. They're not always perfect. But it's ok. The food is great and running any business is hard. Last night we called in our order. Because of the fights delivery was quoted an hour to an hour and a half. No problem, we decided to pick up. Cheese pizza, spinach salad and bread sticks. Nothing complicated. 

When I arrived I was greeted. The cashier brought out the pizza and a brown bag paper that looked like it held a standard to-go container. It was stapled shut. I asked three times, ""is that everything?"" Three times I was told yes. To the point I where I was made to feel like there was something wrong with me. So I figured the salad and breadsticks were packaged in the bag and off I went. 

When I got home and opened it bag there were only breadsticks. No salad. I was annoyed. If I had forgotten the salad or rushed off no big deal. I would have gotten in the car and went back. But I asked the cashier 3 times, ""is that everything?"" I called. Yep, the salad was there. All packed up and ready when I was there. ""Oh you can just come back and get it."" Here is how the rest of the conversation went. 

Me: I asked three times if that was all. You said yes. You need to send it with a delivery guy. 

Rosattis: We're all backed up because of the fight. We can credit you back on your credit card. 
(Nice attempt to create a solution but didn't solve the problem). 

Me: When can you deliver it? 

Rosattis: (Puts me on hold. Comes back.) We're backed up so when it slows down. About 3 hours. 
(Clearly a response to get me either to come pick up the salad, or accept the credit and forget it.) 

Me: (Now I'm pissed). What's your manager's name? 

Rosattis: (Puts me on hold. Comes back.) He's not available. 

Me: What is his name? 

Rosattis: Bill. (Doesn't give last name even tho I asked). 

I hung up and went back to get the salad. I didn't demand the credit and never got it. But guess what I did when I got home? I called Rosattis from our land line. 

Me: Hi do you guys deliver? 

Rosattis: Yes within a 5 mile radius. And we're about 1 to 1.5 hours out on delivery right now.  

Remember the solution they offered - 3 hours to send it with a delivery guy. But if I ordered it again it would only be 1 to 1.5 hours...?

Ok so they made a mistake. I get it. Running a business is hard and especially on high volume nights like last night. Here are the things they could have done differently. 

Don't BS the customer and offer a sensible delivery time. (We would have accepted this solution actually). Or, stretch your resources a bit to make things right. It was your mistake after all. 

Don't be unavailable when you're the manager. The reason stores like this have a manager is to exercise judgement to resolve issues like this. If the manager is truly unavailable, offer to have them call back the customer. Even if it's the next day. 

I will say this, the young man who was working at the front when I went back at least apologized for the mistake.",i7ei6g4AR-PYlR743xw01Q,3,0,4,FJ--upvdBgF3JZ6_NJOCeQ

My wife called and complained and was told their prices increased. For that price I can go to a nice Italian restaurant and have a comfortable and relaxing time. 

This last time we ordered two large pizzas (with extra cheese) and the bill was nearly $60 but I knew that going into it. We've always loved their food. This time though they loaded (sprinkled on top) our pizzas with WAYYYY TO MUCH oregano and other spices so much that even our dogs wouldn't eat it.

My wife again complained and didn't get anywhere with the person who answered the phone so she asked to speak with the manager...The manager was forward and very rude to my wife saying this is the way that have always made it and that there would not be any adjustment. My wife was floored.

NO MORE ROSATI'S FOR US!!!

And to confirm what another poster said....we also have had lots of problems with late deliveries only to find out the food was incorrect. In one instance we had someone else's order!

1307256,2015-09-02,1,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,"Rosati's is a pizza/ribs/sandwiches/pasta/chicken/salads/desserts delivery service and the only restaurant that I regularly order from. That's because the quality of their food is top notch and their service is excellent. 

My favorites are the ribs, chicken parmesan and pizza (in various crusts). I could order these things every day from Rosati's never get tired of them.

I'm from Chicago so I'm very familiar with ""Chicago-style"" food and Rosati's does a wonderful job of making authentic Chicago pizzas. I can't say that I've tried everything on the menu because I tend to stick to my favorites but I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised when you receive your order.

Of course, other important factors are the people taking and delivering the orders. Tonight Brandan took my phone order (for a full rack of Baby Back Ribs) and he is clearly one of the best phone guys in town. He is friendly and knowledgeable about their menu items. It took him less than 30 seconds to take my order, run my credit card and verify my delivery instructions.

The rest of the staff also contributes to a good dining experience, especially their delivery staff. I frequently get Rosati deliveries by a young woman named Chelsea. As always, she provided a prompt and correct delivery of my order. And I greatly appreciated the fact that she was happy, friendly and professional. 

Incidentally, I've never had an error in my order, nor have I ever needed to return any item for being improperly prepared. Rosati's is  batting 100% with me.

At their location on Hualapai (702-262-1900) Rosati's is delivery only. There is no dining area.",7lrEOzh7TnLuVgheeUc7Eg,3,1,5,vesjSbkY2FCt4b6L3c1JOg

Apparently, you can be charged MORE for ordering LESS. I found that out the other day on my first visit there, at the Hualapai location. On the menu, it listed the thin pizza with Pepperoni, Mushroom, Pepper and Onions at $15.45, so I ordered one without the Green Peppers and Onion. First of all the cashier did not say anything about the extra charge, but did not even give me a receipt, like she knew the amount is not the same. I noticed the amount is a little higher than I thought it would be; after I asked for one, and looked at it, I brought it to the cashier's attention, and all she could say is that the computer calculated it that way. I did not want to make a big deal about 50 cent, but thought it was a good point, and expected at least a valid explanation or a credit. But i guess, this is what they count on, the fact that most people would not want to argue over 50c, which was the case with me as well, but it was also the way they quickly brushed it off and blamed it on the register! If you think about it, it is only a few pennies for me, but imagine how much it would add up to when this happens all the time... Needless to say, I did not make a scene out of it, but congratulations Rosati's, you just made an extra 50c out of me, but lost a customer who would have came back over and over. The pizza is good, but when you get skimmed like that, it just leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. By the way, you can have a very similar thin pizza with the same taste and spices at Costco!

We ordered an X-LG ROSATI'S MONSTER...no olives, no ground beef, add jalepenos.

I saw the girl pull out a deep dish, box it up, and hand it to me. I told her that I ordered a pan pizza. The tag on it clearly said PAN PIZZA. But she told me that it would take another long wait to make another pizza. So I took the deep dish home, which the Mrs. wasn't happy about.

Wow!  The only reason I didn't give 1 star is that our waitress tried to be very friendly.  And I said, ""tried"".  The place is disgusting and needs to be renovated, cleaned and painted really bad. It's dimly lit at night so you may not notice but if you take the time to look around, you will see. It might not pass a health inspection. 

I was craving a good Italian sandwich and we actually ended up here because we couldn't find another place my sister recommended but forgot where it was. I saw a picture of what I wanted on the menu and the picture was like a real dream come true. That was the picture. I was waiting for my food, getting all excited to eat a nice, yummy sandwich... And then the waitress brought the food. Ummm... Didn't look ANYTHING like the picture and I totally sunk in my chair like a kid who didn't get what he wanted for Christmas... And then I tasted the sandwich. OMG!  I cannot stress how disappointed I was. Bland, ugly, tasteless sandwich and a side of soggy, undercooked French fries.  The sandwich comes with a side of Italian dressing that I am sure was hidden Valley from a supermarket. The sandwich tasted like black licorice and lettuce. Iceberg lettuce, mushy tomatoes and some meat products that I guess are supposed to be salami and pepperoni? I could go on but anytime I eat really bad food, I ask myself, ""do the people who cook this not taste it ever?"". If they do, do they just have bad taste or do they know it's crap and keep making it the same way?

3610346,2017-04-29,1,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,"The manager of this company is awful and undeserving of continued business. His name is Bill and is disrespectful. I ordered 3 consecutive meals, 3 consecutive nights. I ordered 24 buffalo wings and a pizza. The collective cost was roughly $150 dollars. The first night my order was fine. The second night the buffalo wings were so overcooked and bone dry. I had to throw out half of them because it was like eating a leather belt.

Tonight I placed my order with one of the kind ladies at the front desk. Very sweet and pleasant. Due to the fact I had to throw half of my order away last night, I was emphatic with making sure the wings had extra extra hot sauce. That way with the delivery time they wouldn't be dry and gross. If anybody eats chicken wings, they understand this. I even told the young lady to make sure the wings were ""swimming in hot sauce"". We joked and she said I will make sure the cook understands. Spending $150 over 3 days, I assumed this place would appreciate the repeat business. 

The wings came to my door bone dry, shriveled up and nasty. This order cost $60 plus the $5 tip to the driver. I called back in asked what happened. I was told the kitchen got busy and it was a mistake. The kind young lady said she would speak to the manager and see about crediting the wings. She called me back and said the manager wasn't willing to do anything. To bad for me. Meanwhile the 24 wings are in the trash can.  I'm not worried about the $19 cost of the wings. It's the principle of a repeat customer receiving an unacceptable meal, spending a lot of money and the manager basically saying ""tough shit"". I will never order from this place again and the ownership should eliminate staff like this who has no regard for the customer. Go to Nikos pizza.

First off I decided to this place because of a special promotion courtesy of restaurant.com. Second, I ordered through the phone, and was told 30 minutes @ approx. 7pm. I arrived and paid at 730pm, and paid, they seemed a little busy so I decided to be patient for my order understanding they are a little busy. Its 745pm, and I'm wondering where my food is, the two people that I was ahead of already left with their order. So I ask the lady taking the phone and orders at the front, and then she goes into the heat oven and to my surprise, pulls out my order. 

Okay, so my order was ready and they didn't want to notify me?? I leave without saying anything, but decided to check on the pizza while I was at a stop light in my car. They have a different type of pizza box and when I opened one flap, it was completely soggy and leaked onto my car's chair, leaving a mess. Most definitely unpleasant because I like to be very clean about my car. 

Now to the food.. I ordered mozzarella sticks, some white sauce with penne pasta, and a rosati's monster chicago style. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good, but how can you mess that up? The pasta... nothing to brag about, it was okay. Now the pizza should be renamed the olive monster, that thing was covered in olives. I can't give the pizza any true critique other than it was more wet than Seattle's weather.

I've worked in a few pizzeria's, franchise and local, and never had a gave anyone a situation like this. Perhaps they their food is actually pretty good, just my specific pizza was disastrous, but I'll never know because I'm not going back.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,4,0,2,ou_wWXBMgNwrkWOCR-eiFQ

It took over 45 minutes for my family to receive their order.  There were only 3 other customers in the restaurant so a busy restaurant was not the problem.  It took over 20 minutes for the waiter to notify me that one of the items on the menu was not available.  My barbeque ribs were overcooked and it was not a full rack unless the pig was named ""Wilbur"" and was from Charlotte's Web.  It was more like 3/4 of a rack of ribs.  There was barely any sauce on the overdone ribs.  Food has a grade of C+ (and I'm being generous).

Kitchen Help - during our stay at the establishment I noticed one thing,  the kitchen help was of no help at all. Several times I noticed the kitchen help coming out the back service door to help themselves to the soda fountain.  It was not just one but two or three individuals that came out multiple times.  When I was leaving the restaurant, it all became clear to me. There were probably about 5 or 6 people in the kitchen, and maybe one or two were working.  Several girls were staring through the kitchen door observation window out to the parking lot where one of the employees was smoking a cigarette and checking out one of the cars parked in the dirt.  Most of the employee's cars were parked in such a haphazard way that it looked like a high school drive-in more than a respectable restaurant.  One employee is certainly active because he was also one of the ones that kept helping himself to the soda at the fountain.  It also doesn't help that the male kitchen help were not clean-shaven.  The kitchen help gets a grade of D- (I've seen worse and that's why it's not an F).

Service - I would have to say this was the only bright spot in the whole experience.  Our waiter, busted his butt to make sure our dining experience was good.  I know he was covering for the kitchen help because he was very apologetic and seemed frustrated at times with what was going on in the kitchen. I give him a grade of A.

My final thoughts:  I have done more than my share of restaurant work in my youth and I have been in the Customer Service field for over 20 years.  This experience was not a good one.  On the website I'm sure Sam Rosati would not stand for this kind of kitchen help or quality of food that I experienced on Saturday November 7, 2009.  Since the restaurant is not in the best of locations, it will have to survive by word of mouth.  It is not going to survive for very long with kitchen help and food like I experienced.

I paid the extra money to get the ""better crust""  I just didn't know that it meant it was the harder crust.  I never had a piece of pizza so hard to chew.  My brother asked me how much I paid for this and when I told him he smirked.   Like Vince Vaughn said in Wedding Crashers it's hard to make a bad pizza, but this place did it.  With so many options here in Vegas I would never try there pie again.",30Apfs9u9-kqQE4qHEWqUw,2,2,2,buK9hg-3CS7Ry7axXEFFOQ
4260022,2018-01-09,1,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,"We've had pizza from this place, in the past, but it was from the Henderson location (my FIL introduced us to their deep dish pizza- dang it is very heavy- I can only handle a single slice, along with a side serving of salad). 

We had a birthday promotion to use last month- free thin crust cheese pizza (cut into squares) with any minimum purchase of $15.00, so we also got an order of chicken fingers, came with the- creamiest- ever- Ranch dressing (I suspect it was buttermilk, because it was really good) (*I think that there were five to this appetizer order*) and a calzone, which came with dipping sauce (canadian bacon + ricotta- it is $7 for the calzone and a $1.00 for each topping). My favorite was the calzone, so glad that we had leftovers to enjoy, too. 

There was a communication hurdle because the person on the other end of the line wasn't quite well-versed, but when the lady was put on the line, all was good. ((*The promotion code is not near the name of the restaurant but in another spot of the printed email, FYI.*)) 

Everything was yummy. The thin crust pizza was flavorful (*I guess, we were surprised because this one specializes in deep dish pizza*); I usually add red pepper for an extra little kick. The chicken tenders were not heavily breaded (lots of restaurants miss the mark on this simple item, but that was not the case here). Our picky eater loves pizza and chicken; if he doesn't eat it, that means, he does not like it. He ate it, if you are wondering, hahaha.  

Not a sit-down restaurant, does takeout and delivery. There were other promotions on the coupons that were attached to the pizza box, as well as the receipt, *mention it*, when ordering by telephone. Glad we found this one near our home.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,3,1,4,S_KV8k41-47Jc-MUT6jRgQ

We came into a empty restaurant so it was nice to have our choice of seats. We chose a seat at the back of the restaurant by the big flat screens. The TV's were entertaining because we were waiting for a deep dish to be made which takes like 40 min.  They had a nice Christmas comedy on so we didn't mind waiting even though we had to refill our own drinks most of the time. Then things start to go downhill from there. The waitress sat a large group right next to us ...out of all of the empty seats in the restaurant she chooses that one! Then they ask the waitress if they can change the channel she changes the TV  we are watching without even asking us...very rude! There was another TV that she could of changed without compromising anyone's entertainment. 

I was happy to see that the food was ready but shortly after biting into in the deep dish I realized that the toppings were wrong. They added mushrooms which I never order because my husband can't stand them . Since the pizza took so long I just accepted the mistake. The sauce which is put on top of the pie was a bit too sour for my taste. The cheesy bread was okay but the meal wasn't worth what we paid for. 

I know that there are many pizza places in the area that taste better and cost less. I wish I traveled a little farther and went to Amore's!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,5,2,1,zJzO4HPdhb2VPEoHk1r0ZQ
4524026,2008-11-08,0,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,"The deep-dish pizza is fantastic, but we've had several problems ordering from them.

The first time we ordered, we ordered online and requested delivery.  We ordered early in the afternoon for delivery at 6pm.  It was a little after 6:30pm that the pizza arrived, which was fine but surprising since they'd had all day to get it ready.  They had forgotten to include the garlic bread that we'd ordered.  Still, the pizza was exactly what we were looking for: crispy deep dish crust, doughy middle with tons of cheese, sausage, peppers, onions, etc.  Delicious!

We just ordered again last night, and this time we called.  They recognized our phone number, and we told them we wanted to order the same pizza as last time.  We also asked that they throw in a garlic bread because we didn't get one last time.  They said no problem.  A half-hour later, they called back and said that they weren't able to deliver because we were too far away.  Puzzled, we asked them how come we got delivery before, and they merely said that it was the driver's discretion and he must have not had a busy night last time.

So I jumped in the car and drove up to get it.  It took my 8 minutes to get there, which doesn't seem like an excessive trip for delivery.  But mostly I wish they would just be consistent; I don't mind picking it up if I know that's required ahead of time.  When I got the pizza home, I was very disappointed to find out that they'd messed up the order.  The pizza was not as good as before because it only had cheese and sausage and was missing all the other ingredients we ordered.  With a deep dish pizza, you have to have lots of toppings!

We love the pizza, but if we order from them again, we'll have to be very careful about making sure they get the order right.",WxJ8l6OTDvvbQKQyv_-5kw,0,0,4,Gy7HYtyQJPaQwGDcYWJnYg
4558368,2016-01-21,0,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,"Only a Sith deals in absolutes... but this was ABSOLUTELY the best Chicken Parmesan I've ever had in a restaurant. I don't know how else to start this review other than to say that. There's no time for eloquent prose when chicken parm is on the line. I mean, man... it was amazing. And don't stop just because I said the chicky chicky parm parm (Tom Haverfood) was the best. I've tried a lot of different things here and they've all been winners. Let me go down the line.

- The pizzas: I've had the White, Hawaiian, and one with bacon. All awesome. I love thin crust pizza, but I dislike soggy thin crust. Not a problem here. The crust was great, the sauce was good, and the toppings taste like they do when you buy them fresh at Whole Foods. You don't realize how bland chain pizzas really are until you compare them to pizza like this. I honestly am opposed to pizzas costing more than a tenner, but after you eat one of these you'll be A-OK with it. The Hawaiian (the best of the three I've had) was absolutely worth every penny. 

- Cheese ravioli: I'm not the world's greatest fan of ravioli, TBH. But this ravioli was great. They're bigger, so they're not like the Chef Boyardi stuff I usually have at home, but that just makes them better. My dad liked the ravioli tons. I really liked the cheese, and I would not be opposed to that cheese blend on a pizza...

- Baked Lasagna: I know, I know.... lasagna is usually hit-or-miss at these places, right? Maybe if you go to a not-so-awesome place. The lasagna here was awesome. I really liked that it was more composed than lasagnas usually look, and I loved that cheese was not skimped on. Also not opposed to throwing some lasagna bits on a pizza...

- Breadsticks: I don't want to ruin this for you. Get them. 

- Wings: You like wings, right? Sure you do. The wings here were good! My favorite was that they were extra saucy, which is great. I love having extra wing sauce because I can dip my breadsticks all up in there and slop it up. I thought the wings were good, but they were blown away by...

- THE CHICKEN PARM: I love chicken parm. It's one of my favorite foods on Earth, and probably what I would pick as my last meal. I don't know the sorcery involved in making delicious chicken parm, as I've only made good parm twice out of about 2042 attempts. But basically you need the noodles to be on point, the sauce needs to bring it together, and the chicken has to be the star (IMO). This place takes that and says ""noodles on point, sauce is great, CHICKEN IS THE BEST."" I got two pieces of chicken, perfectly breaded and baked and sitting atop my noodles. It was the best. Again, best chicken parm I've ever had from a restaurant. I can't imagine going to Rosati's and not ordering the chicken parm. Like I know I'll probably go in there for a pizza but I'll get a chicken parm for later. It's that good.  

- Service: Everyone was super nice, polite, and answered my questions about stuffs. There's a younger girl who works there who was extra polite and nice, and it made me happy to experience that kind of a service in a more casual setting.

All in all, I think the food was great. I think the chicken parm and pizzas have spoiled me so I can't go elsewhere until my taste buds forget about it all. Not only that, but my family loved all the food. It's usually pretty hard for me to find a place when it's my turn to host family dinners, but I've found it with Rosati's. The breadth of options is great, the service was wonderful, but more importantly: it was all delicious and you can tell the stuff is made when you order it.

I ordered for our family last night, just in time to turn on MNF.  Now, I haven't eaten at a Rosati's in over 5 years so I was highly disappointed that this is one of the remaining West Side locations.  Only a few years ago they were like 7-11's and there wasn't and address in Las Vegas where they didn't have delivery service. 

I had been to this location back in 07 or 08 and I was quite impressed when I walked in.  Apparently they have added a dining area and there is a nice Tuscan feel to it.  Keep in mind though, it is still a pizza place.  Not worthy of bringing the Nikon to see authentic Italian art.

We ordered the Chicago Style Deep Dish and it was everything I remembered.  Golden crisp crust layered with cheese, pep's and sauce on top.  I ordered a large, fully expecting to have left overs (the pizza box weighed close to 5 lbs) and we devoured every bit of it.  Seriously, the dog snuck in the trash and ate most of the cardboard overnight!

This was the best pizza I have had in months, if not years.  A great flavor, good seasonings, great sauce, healthy amount of cheese, not to mention friendly staff!

I was very impressed to see how much their menu has expanded as well!  Quite a few items if you don't want pizza (which I would highly recommend).

I had Rosatis a few times from one of their other locations before I moved to this area and never had a bad experience. I now live right across the street from this one and have ordered  a number of times. Some times its great, sometimes its ok and sometimes its just plain sad. The management for Rosatis really needs to evaluate this location and figure out what or should I say who is to blame. Every time I go in here the staff seems confused and frustrated and to be honest I don't think they were trained properly or know what they are doing. I have been 5 or 6 times now and I don't think I have seen the same employee twice (meaning they can't hold on to employees). 

I considered applying here when I first found them but then decided against it after seeing the employees and people I would have to work with. They all seemed just miserable all the time.
For one- when I call and place the order they usually seem confused. I always do pick-up b/c its close by and after I place my order they usually just give me the total and are ready to hang up. I always have to ask how long before its ready. Am I supposed to just assume how long its going to take? I have never ordered food and not gotten a time. Then they usually just guess when I tell them because the person working the phones has no idea how long it takes for stuff to cook.
Which means- when I get there usually either my food has not even gone in yet (happened once) or my food is nowhere close to being ready (happened twice). I have also witnessed my food being packed up and put in the warmer by the cooks and the girl at the front was not notified that an order was complete. I had to go to her and tell her that my food had just come out. (pathetic)
I even came in one night to find out that they had ""given my food to the wrong person apparently"" which I think is BS and they just forgot to do it. So I stood there waiting for it for about 20 minutes and they didn't even give me a discount or anything.
Recently they have had the Lunch buffet for 5.99 from 11-2pm m-f. The first time i tried to go was around 1 on a wed and the guy at the front when I asked if they were doing the buffet said he didn't know if they were doing it and that he was just covering for someone. How do you not know if you are doing a buffet?! So I left. Decided to try again last wed at 1pm and the girl had to ask the cook if it was still going on. I almost walked out again but she said it was so I decided to try it. Not impressive AT ALL!!!! The food had been sitting out forever. The pizza was cold, the pasta was dried up. The sauce and meatballs were good as well as the salad and the anti-pasto. However, I had to go looking around for parmesean cheese when the server dissappeared for a while (leaving 2 or 3 dirty tables out while she was away). I felt bad because she was very friendly and sweet but had no idea what she was doing.

Luckily for this Rosatis there food is still good, however as I mentioned... inconsistent. But it is the closest decent food for me without having to drive far. Just last night I ordered the Rosatis Chopped Salad (might be the best salad I have ever had, honestly) and I ordered The Cheef (there version of a cheesesteak. The Cheef was rather disappointing as the meat was not prepared right and was too greasy causing the nicely toasted bread to become moist at the bottom and tear apart to create a messy sandwich.

If anyone from Rosati's reads this: Please get a new staff! Your manager at this location obviously is clueless as to what they are doing and lets the staff do whatever they like. This has the potential to be such a good place to eat.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,4,1,3,9L4Va2bcWjNXdAvKLQEVuQ

Several employees passed us, back and forth, several times - no smiles, no acknowledgment, nothing. Finally, after 5 minutes a young lady, asks us ""Did you want to be seated?""

Really.  ""Did you want to be seated?""!!!!

""Sure, thank you.""  (although, my wife wanted to say...
""No, we just wanted to stand here and look at your fine establishment."")

She walked us to a table, dropped two menus on top, and walked away.  

Really!  I don't think so.  
Thank you very much, we'll go eat someplace else.  Never going back to Rosati's.  Stay away.",P26LP6M7ukXg7w7cnTIaiQ,3,0,1,hWDNPA2lvY4E8Bl6KKuTbA

5199407,2010-07-31,2,zBD6zc8YU-TA0_KJmN1tpA,"When everything is 50% off perhaps it tastes twice as good? I was tempted to give 4 stars here, but we haven't gone back, so I decided that perhaps at the time we were doubly impressed because of our magic half-off everything coupon. That's a good deal!

The Chicago lady who sold us our car had insisted that Rosati's was the best in Vegas. Granted, she gets her Rosati's from a Henderson location, but we gave this one a try. Thanks to the coupon, we went a little overboard and ordered salad, wings and a pizza. Now, that's just crazy.

The salad is delicious. One of the most solid green offerings I have had at a casual place. The dressing appeared homemade, and all of the ingredients were fresh. I was impressed. I was equally impressed by the artery-clogging garlic knots. I rarely find myself unable to resist a bread basket, but I may have eaten 20 of these tasty morsels.

Chicken wings were good.

Now, as for the pizza, it was perplexing. When it arrived to the table, we had to confirm with the waitress that this was indeed the deep dish. She said it was, but honestly it looked more like a Pizza Hut deep dish than the brick o' cheese I associate with Chicago-style. It didn't come out in one of those pans that the waitress has to carry with a special wrench. It was like a thin deep-dish or something. The sauce was good. Overall, a nice tasting pizza, but not as sinfully cheesy as the Chicago-styles I have had in the past. 

As for service, when we first arrived we had this on the ball, chipper teenager, but half way through he left, and so did our service. Kind of a 50/50 on the service as well. 

I'll definitely be watching my mailbox for another coupon.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,3,3,qUeaaJu8QpzeoVmxkLEROA

Craving Chicago Style Pizza?  Well look no further, just bring a truck to get your leftovers home.  Their breadsticks are to die for.  Garlicky, yet not greasy, small, almost french fry size but light and crispy.  We got an antipaasti salad which wasn't very creative but was delicious.  I should have stopped there.  Salad and breadsticks would have filled me up but we came for the deep dish.  My wife mistakenly ordered the medium deep dish.  Having had Chicago Pizza at its birthplace in Chicago (Gino's or Giordanos??? another time.), I was certain a medium would be about the size of a normal plate and deep.  Instead it was about the size of a large flat crust pizza except deep!  The crust was perfectly crisp and the dough light.There was a lot of flavor and not a lot of grease which is good for a deep dish.  The dining area is small but the Pizza worth the wait.

Ok, we aren't done yet, my daughter wanted pasta so we got her Penne (knock knock Penne, Knock Knock Penne).  Another truck arrived at our table and delivered a trough full of delicious pasta.  They will alter the dish as my daughter wanted melted mozzerella on top. They happily obliged.

So, we carted home 1/2 a salad, 6/8 of a pizza and 2/3 of the pasta for lunch and dinner for the rest of the week.   Did I mention that with drinks the whole meal for three cost $49.00. 

Why not five stars?  Well the atmosphere is not the greatest, the place is small and they don't have as many topping choices as I would like.  But if you are craving good pizza and pasta that won't break the wallet, this is the place to go.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,1,4,CoDqu21VoYiBQlzjSTX8Sw

We placed our order for a small 12' deep dish Chicago style meat combo pizza $16.50 and an appetizer of (12) buffalo style wings $8.99.

They give you a complimentary order of bread sticks which would have been delicious had they been cooked more. They were greasy soggy and under cooked otherwise it would have been a nice bread basket as the marinara sauce was tasty.

Our small 12' deep dish pizza took one hour to cook, that would have been nice to have been told in advance while placing our order. We missed our movie because of the long wait. We ate our wings and after the hour wait for our pizza just requested they box it up to go.

The service was super friendly however they would not accept our coupon for a bogo offer they have in the entertainment guide.  :(

Yet another review brought to you by Groupon. I might have an addiction, just saying. Excited to try some good ol' Chicago style pizza in this town, but this wasn't what I was expecting. 

The place was pretty dead when we got there. Just one other table was seated and not too much happening on the to-go side either. Despite this, the service was still pretty slow. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time. So much so, that we ended up refilling our own drinks and stacking our plates ourselves.

The pizza wasn't as thick as I was expecting. More of a pan pizza than a deep dish in my opinion. I wasn't too blown away by the flavors. The size is enormous though, so I would definitely recommend getting a  smaller pizza than you would think. I was full after just one slice. We had the wings as well and they were just ok. 

Don't make a special trip out here, but it's good if you're in the neighborhood.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,3,3,8hUGLvGQcB9OJNRRYjnoqg
