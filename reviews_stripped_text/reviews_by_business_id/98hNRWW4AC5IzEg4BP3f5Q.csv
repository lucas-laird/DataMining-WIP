11989,2014-10-17,0,98hNRWW4AC5IzEg4BP3f5Q,"Worst service EVER! I would of gave zero stars if possible. We went to celebrate two birthdays. We had a party of 12. It took over 30 minutes for us to get our orders. We all waited forever! We each had ordered and each waited for more than 30 minutes each! Other patrons came in after us and got their food before us. When asked they kept apologizing. Saying they were busy. The ""owner"" lady was rude!!! 
The food quality was average. Ordered some nigiri sushi. There rice portion was huge! Four times the amount of rice to the size of the sliced fish. Could of made three more nigiris. Pretty sad.
When we got our checks to pay we asked about their frequent stamp card. She said she wouldn't stamp our cards cause we had used the free birthday dinner promo. Hello we had to pay for three other people to get the promo so why wouldn't we get stamped. She said ""well we had a time limit and could of close you down."" Meaning we went over our one hour time limit. Hello? We went over cause your service was slow and horrible. Constantly having to ask where our order was and asking for drink refills. WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK!!",-1yVLNCQbL2k6aXr4IeeFQ,0,0,1,k8NpVPA42elDV8hkCFq8-w

Since I like to try out different sushi spots I came across Sage Sushi, so I yelped that sucker and went even though some of the reviews were low. But hey I like trying places even though some people might not like it. Everyone has their own opinion right? 

As my bf and I arrived a lady greeted us and asked if we wanted to do AYCE or al la carte. I am a big AYCE fan because you get your money's worth and then some. I checked out the menu and saw some new stuff that I've never seen at some other sushi places. I came upon the creamy mermaid as an appetizer, I had no clue what was in it so I asked the waitress, who was indeed very helpful. Creamy mermaid is shrimp wrapped in wonton with cream cheese and with special sauce...umm yum!! 

Must try: 
Creamy mermaid- will blow your mind if not your outta your mind. 
Mussels- good, has crab baked with it. 
Oyster Shooter's- MmMm 
Tako- my favorite 
Screaming tuna roll- chef's special, was good but too much cucumber 
Tako salad- with cucumber in vinegar sauce 
Lychee Sorbet- chunks of lychee what can go wrong. Make sure you leave room, totally recommend trying it! 

Overall, my experience here was fantabulous! The service was great, the chefs and waitress was very helpful, and very clean with Japanese decorations. Also, the waitresses get to wear the cool Japanese outfit. Prices are average $25.95 AYCE dinner. But if you go the day before, the day of, or day after your bday your FREE!",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,1,4,ITGzY9OPyyN_x3PgmqJ1mA

192861,2014-09-07,0,98hNRWW4AC5IzEg4BP3f5Q,I've been eating at Sage for going on 6 years now. In that time my friends and I have visited other sushi resteraunts. Some to our dismay. We always return to our favorite place. The turn over in wait staff has caused an ebb and flow with service. Common in the food industry. The sushi however is always of high quality in taste and creativity.  I enjoy the interaction of the chefs with the clientel. Its far better than the generic stoic composure of other establishments. It goes a long way in creating a pleasurable dining experience.,_3d4faxGFpzcX9G3YrKjZQ,2,0,5,crUJGSndLzcX1fPSR4Dp8w

362835,2014-08-26,0,98hNRWW4AC5IzEg4BP3f5Q,"I've been going to Sage Sushi for almost 8 years now. They are right down the street from where I live and I absolutely love the owner and the staff who work there. It may be a little dated on the inside, but I love the kitsch 80's sushi vibe on the inside. I've never once had bad service, always fresh fish, and the chefs have always prepared everything quickly and effectively. My favorite thing on the menu is the Monkey Roll. The banana tempura with the white pearl sauce is so amazingly delicious. The AYCE portion of the menu is pretty extensive and they have lots of great options. 

They are a wonderful little business and I will continue to be a regular customer of theirs. I've eaten at just about every sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. From The Strip's 5 star cuisine, to hole in the wall Japanese locations. Sage Sushi will always be my first choice when going out for sure though!

472467,2010-05-02,0,98hNRWW4AC5IzEg4BP3f5Q,"Big change from the previous reviews as far as appearance. First the Chefs and waitress were in costume playing the part. They also advised me to choose more than 1 role because it could take some time in between orders. 

Appetizers are included with All You Can eat. BIG Plus! The food came in about 10 to 15 minutes. But, I was 1 of five customers there. Now the bottom line.

This place needs a little more for example checking on your drink when the ice melts (I ordered Ice Tea). The Sushi was Average. So the price was expensive. All-You-Can Eat Dinner was 25.00. The special which comes with Saki was displayed as 32.00 per person. 

This place has potential to get better. For now, I advise that you got to your local favorite so you don't feel like ""I should have made the extra Drive to get what I want.""",5POgpnBZUZhXjADHZl30Gg,1,1,2,luD7A9b6NuIwb--rve2Czw

the problem with this place is perhaps the signs outside advertising AYCE and the pricing, as well as the ""free food on your birthday"" gimic.  i mean, let's face it, when eating establishments market itself in such a way, it does make you wonder about the quality of food being served.

that said, as i've stated above, my experience was pleasant.  i ordered the AYCE sushi for 25 bucks, and had the omakase, which was wonderful.  i also had a salad, miso soup, tempura, spring roll, and for dessert - green tea ice cream.  not bad at all, in fact i felt very at home and warm inside.

The food was good; I enjoyed the seaweed salad and found the sushi to be tasty.

I actually enjoyed our waitress, who tried to make our experience enjoyable. She was constantly deterred from her mission by the proprietor, who gave her nasty looks any time the waitress tried to be helpful.

The sushi specialties are mostly cream cheese filled, deep fried, greasy concoctions that were hard to distinguish from each other. 

The best item on the menu was the lemon marinated Tako (octopus). The ebi was also tasty. 

If you are into spice and heat, their jalapeño popper roll doesn't make it. I asked for their hottest menu item and found it mild. 

If you go here, stick to standard sushi, hope the nice waitress wasn't fired for knowing how to do her job, and look out for Mrs. Hyde!",DbBpcxcTCwHxXxswVcgILw,3,1,1,UnzI6VRWQkDM4B9-p439qg

I'm not sure I'd pick it as a date night destination, but it is a good spot to grab lunch or catch up with a friend if you're in the North Vegas area. 

They offer AYCE and the rolls are fairly creative, but the combo meals are the best deal: the sashimi or sushi plates come with multiple courses of soup, salad, tempura, and rice before you even get to the main plate.

Also some of the cucumber in my rolls tasted weird. I dunno If it was more of a texture issue or if the pieces of cuke were too big...I really can't explain it. 

They have 3 menus. One is for AYCE, one for lunch specials and an ala carte menu. I went with AYCE and ordered the rainbow roll, Japanese lasagna, 2pcs of super white tuna, and half of the sc7 and volcano rolls. The lasagna was good but it fell apart when I tried to pick it up. I hate that! I shouldn't need to use a fork to eat my sushi! The rainbow was typical rainbow except that cucumber was so prominent it overpowered my roll! Boo. My favorite was the sc7 it was a cali roll wrapped in soy paper with spicy crab, a touch of cream cheese and avocado. Price for my lunch was $23.73 with tax because I didn't order a drink just water. They also have an ayce special which also includes aycd (all u can drink) with choices of Draft beer or sake and that runs $34 something per person.

I came right when dinner started had a great conversation with the sushi chef, the original chef when the place opened 5 years ago. Said that he returned about year ago so I imagine many of the lesser reviews were for other sushi chefs.

My favorites were the Spider Roll and the Cabo Roll.

Spider Roll - the plate presentation of the soft shell crab was great, sauce spiraled in the middle of the plate with soy and seaweed wrap. 

Cabo Roll - great combination of spicy tuna and salmon - loved the crunch of the roasted sesame seeds.

Overall loved the care and attention from the authentic sushi chef, unlike the crowded mass made sushi places at other AYCE like Yama. You won't be disappointed to stop by this local place.

Was a fan of their specials as well:
Options for all-you-can-eat/drink, happy hour from 9-10:30pm, and a stamped card, 12 visits and next visit free! If it's your birthday bring 5 guests and your meal free (before or after your specific birthday is okay)

The waitresses have an upbeat attitude and are willing to work with whatever needs me and my friends have as customers, however when the owner is around they are reprimanded for even having a 10 second conversation with a customer, even if it's about the food, which is something that needs to be improved. The interior of the restaurant is not the greatest, it looks like they bought their decor from big lots; go elsewhere if you are looking for a location to host a formal event. The menu has a decent selection, I've never been dissatisfied with any dish I've had there. They do not try and scam you by adding copious amounts of rice like I've seen other restaurants do.

To be honest, the fact that this place doesn't have the same curb appeal as some of the trendy spots makes the dining experience much more personal.  For the most part when I'm in the restaurant, I see the same familiar faces.

As far as the food goes, anything that I've ordered from the AYCE menu is great.  Appetizers and dessert are included, which is great.  My wife doesn't eat sushi, so she always orders from the a la carte menu, and she can't think of a bad thing to say, either.

I come here with my family (wife and two young daughters), and I never feel awkward bringing my kids in.  The first time we ever came in, the sushi chef saw my daughters and cut up an orange to look like a bear, just for them!

True to what I expected, there was nothing particularly positive to report about this restaurant. Everything is designed to get you in and out with as little fish in you as they can manage. You are limited to one serving (2 slices) of nigiri. I didn't even see an option for sashimi, which is generally the majority of what I eat. All of the rolls were made mostly of rice, with very little filling -- again, a tactic to fill you up quickly. The rolls were very loose and fell apart easily. What little fish I did actually get was certainly not up to the standards of freshness that I expect.

The deal is like this:
-Used to have owners who worked in the resturant, now you don't see the new ones

-Prices went up, number of items on AYCE went down

-Old owners used to let the sushi chefs 'try' new ideas out for you, and if you didn't eat them, so what! New chefs tried new ideas-WITHOUT ASKING ME WHAT I LIKED, i hated it, then they threw out 3 COMPLETE ROLLS due to me not liking tuna. However, at the end, 1 did not eat 3 pieces of a roll I ordered-so they tried to charge me $3 due to not eating.

-Old decor: nice, peaceful, relaxing and pleasant to have a conversation in. New decor: cluttered, dim, looks like its from an old hotel

-Even the roll names were taken from Sushi Zen and Sushi Loca!

-AYCE punch card, after 10 meals then next one is FREE. Cool, i thought. So I brought in a punch card with 9 punches on it, then my wife and I EACH had AYCE. So they punched my card for the 10th, then gave her a card with 1 punch. I said ""Excuse me, hers should be free I believe, that would make 11 meals total."" ...to keep this VERY short, let's just say the owner wasn't there, they couldn't tell me who the Mgr on duty was and I ended up paying for the whole thing.
Do the math you idiots, I've spent roughly $200 with you, now I bring my wife her for her birthday and you can't give me the meal for free?? Even though on the 10th time ITS FREE!?

To the new owners:
Treat people as PEOPLE, not customers. Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me. I had to get my own refill twice.
And the fact that the ONLY white blonde girl working there TEXTS WHILE ON THE JOB and is still employed is mind blowing.
Sell the place back to the old owners, who knew my face by my 2nd visit. You however have seen my face MORE than they did and Ive brought groups of 9+ people in and you don't think of me as anything but $$.

To the folks reading this:
Go to Sushi Zen, not much further up the road, MUCH nicer employees. If you don't care about AYCE then head to Sushi Loca off of 95 and Ann, that place is an AWESOME atmosphere

The guys at the sushi bar are absolutely amazing. Super friendly and great with giving the perfect suggestion and everything tastes AWESOME. It's the waitress we got. We are leaving tonight and definitely not paying. We got here and right away the waitress was rude right away. We had ordered our appetizers right when we sat down. 20 minutes pass and still hadn't received anything. We ask her for our mussels and she said ""if you order it, it's gonna come. You don't have to ask."" Im sorry, we've been waiting 20 minutes. 4 lousy mussels don't take that long. We'd already gotten our first sushi dishes from the bar and EATEN them before we got the mussels. She could tell we were upset, but didn't even apologize (I was pissed about her attitude). Next thing, we were almost done with our food and we hadn't had a refill yet. THE GUY AT THE SUSHI BAR MADE HER COME OVER TO REFILL OUR DRINKS! So, she brings our drinks and leaves right away. We try to flag her down to order our last items and she for some reason keeps walking past us and looking at us but blatantly ignored us. My boyfriend gets pissed and takes his first drink of his refill and immediately spits it out. SHE SPIT IN HIS DRINK! You can tell the difference between spit and soda. I am beyond disgusted by this sad excuse for a woman. We don't know what she does and does not have. That is absolutely disgusting.

She comes back and I order my normal starter creamy mermaid bake mussels and salmon collar ( witch they never have). She informs me that I can only get two items. So I say let me get the mussels and collar and I'll order the mermaids later. She says no only to items period. I asked well why call it ayce she said sorry the owner changed the menu. I've had talks with the manager before so I guess I shouldn't be suprised. So seeing there was only one chief I knew there was something different.

The AYCE menu is a decent selection. There is something for everyone. I am a fan of cream cheese rolls(yes it still counts sushi, snobs haha) which they have. I had some octopus and eel rolls this last time that were yummy. I recently have started trying some nigiri rolls and the Cajun albacore is yummy. Has just enough kick for me. My friend had their tea and said it was good(she should know she loves tea). I have a habit of not leaving room for dessert but when I do have it, it was yummy.

It's not a super big sushi place but I kind of like it. We usually strike a conversation with people sitting at the bar and the sushi chefs are friendly. Sitting table side is not bad either. A good tip I give to people is at least give a order of a sushi your familiar with so then you can have some sushi being made while you decide what you want. Sage also has a stamp card. I don't know if they always did it or if it just started.

I was told after a bad review on Facebook that ownership had changed a year ago and to give them another try. We went in and everything was the same. Same waitress - CC forgot everything. We told her that we had the chefs hair in our food and did not want that roll that had the hair. She said sorry and no one offered us any complimentary anything for that. When I looked at both Chefs , they were both so drunk , they could barely keep their eyes open. There was an 8 women birthday party at the bar and all the one chef could do was lean on the Sushi counter glass over the food prep area , hold his forehead up , touching his skin. He kept moving his baseball cap forward and backwards , which probably resulted in grating his hair off in the food. Whatever happened to hair nets for food makers ?? All the sushi that was presented at our table was sloppily thrown together and every single roll or nigiri completely fell apart. The quality of the cuts and freshness was C grade at best. They said this was new ownership but everything was exactly the same as 4 yeara ago. Same waitresses , same chefs , all the same decorations. Even the disgusting Unagi was the same. Sages Unagi always had a weird look and texture , and it smells bad and tastes foul. I have never had Unagi this bad and would not even eat it. Unagi is always my favorite anywhere I go and this was not Unagi. I dont know what it is ? Umiya is our usual go to place and they are 5 star quality. I will never be back to Sage again !! Sage was also empty that night , like every other time I have been there , not a good sign. Umiya is completely packed everytime ; a great sign !!",-Ia1lWvBNdgGySyB2VSgNQ,0,0,1,OLJ9PdyouKmuPWYABkhRHQ
5664394,2017-01-21,0,98hNRWW4AC5IzEg4BP3f5Q,This is my favorite place in Las Vegas to go. They have a new owner and management but the same traditional sushi chefs. Shinji is my all time favorite and I love their special for all you can eat and drink for $39.99. It includes draft beer and hot or cold sake. If you don't like sushi then they have bento boxes for really good prices.,0Wmm6GLEB-A2zqx5r2Nnvw,0,0,4,fWej2KIM_vR2MR8f2g6Vcg

Otherwise it's mediocre for the prices they charge.  Services is spotty, atmosphere different and AYCD a good deal.",WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,1,1,3,cExBAfmUOJ1J5oFsN4gEXQ

Although I must say I've never been a fan of time limits on AYCE, but I guess people can and do take advantage of it.  And the fact that out kid don't eat for free :(

I just made myself crave for some sushi",y8mlQX2GmS-lvIUWYcXgdw,0,0,4,JW8ehK-renlWWgvZPGlfHA

The afternoon (11 a.m. - 4 p.m.) and late night (9:00 p.m. - 10:30 p.m.) AYCE is only $21.95 daily. The place was empty; we were literally the only customers in there. It was not fancy; it's just a basic, but well kept atmosphere. The waitress was very attentive and pleasant. The sushi was delicious. We had about 10 rolls between the three us. My only semi-complaint is that the sushi chef was an older gentleman and a little slow with the sushi-making. We were done with the first roll and waiting before the second roll came out; then the same between the second and third. However, by the time we got to roll four, he was on it. The rolls started coming out much quicker; we would be still working on the rolls at our table when the waitress brought out others.  We were nearly done by the time another two sets of customers came in. So if it had been crowded, the service may not have been as quick and we probably would not have gotten the great attention. Overall, I thought it was delicious and well-priced. I will definitely be going back.",xQMe_pYu6yfZdeCaF5cHzA,0,0,4,_WCH8AfBDJM4kzHzR6u8aQ
5840088,2015-07-06,1,98hNRWW4AC5IzEg4BP3f5Q,"Nope, nope...won't come back here. My cousin enjoys this place so we all went and I am not a fan as she is. 

Food: The rolls were mediocre nothing so great to rave about. I hated the calamari we got, the texture of it was gross and the breading too, My guess is it's frozen crap. My goddaughter's fried chicken was bland, no seasoning. Edamame had so much water in the bowl - it's called straining but I don't think they know that. 

Service: Was so crappy! We would ask one girl for a roll or drink and she would say ok and never come back. Had to keep telling the other lady just to get what we already placed (or so we thought placed) with the other. They kept bringing orders that were not ours or got our order wrong. We asked for a whole roll and half of another but got the opposite. By that time we were so tired of the screw ups we gave up. 

Atmosphere: Eh! The places seems kind of dingy. Went to the bathroom and happen to look up, the ceiling is sagging and completely cracked! Just not appealing. Enter at your own risk!",rwxIAhvgoYQZr6VNz1lvhA,0,1,1,-Optg1LJkpxpWvCIgXZV9w

We have been going there for 8 years, and its had ups and downs. Current owner is very nice and friendly, and like most places struggling to balance price and quantity. Quality of fish always good.
AYCE is very fair, especially lunch 11am-4pm.
They take care of their regulars, we don't even order, just let them take care of it. Some of the best rolls we've had aren't on menu, just creations by chiefs. And above all, the Saporo is cold.",zBdfduwvbKUy8tnDLAM9Xg,0,0,4,DFXVN6fXWQIPNNt3uDBPVw

My son had ayce, included....volcano, monkey roll, lava roll, Dragon roll, salmon surprise,royal Cali.   All the rolls were great.
