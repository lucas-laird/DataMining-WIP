The portions were on the small side, it took FOREVER for our whole party to be served and the food didn't even stand out, taste-wise. Maybe it was just an off night and maybe it had to do with the fact that there were close to 15 of us there for a party, but I just wasn't impressed. I didn't order a smoothie but some of my friends did and they really liked them. I would be willing to give this place another chance next time in Vegas but with so many other veggie places that I DO like, this place probably won't get another shot.",yjB4myNUyWyPpkIHY4kdcw,0,0,2,0VtahxsJtKIoWvLrKGncjA

224027,2010-04-12,1,bKbYRUZKDYonSPOjzchJJg,"Veggie Delight offers vegan menu options, but they all cost a dollar extra than the vegetarian dishes. Why? In all other Buddhist vegetarian restaurants I've visited, most of the dishes are already vegan by virtue of being prepared in the 'pure vegetarian' Buddhist style, which eschews eggs and dairy. It seems mean and frankly kind of suspicious to be charging vegans extra for every single dish- just make everything (or the majority of the menu) vegan, as it probably is already, and charge everyone the same damn price. 

The food did not blow me away, and while it was filling, was certainly nowhere near the quantity I expected for the (special vegan) price we paid. I would like to try it again sometime, but I don't know if I can justify the extra dollar for something that is probably the exact same dish at a higher price.",Tf5cKL2LMI2EaM9MBFAaOA,2,1,3,SwhFdl8RWfbQc6tzlbzEAw

649338,2010-05-26,1,bKbYRUZKDYonSPOjzchJJg,"I'm would actually give Veggie Delight just two stars, but I think the taste of the food bumps it up just a bit.  There aren't many restaurants in Las Vegas that are solely dedicated to serving vegetarian/vegan options.  So, I will be back - but they could honestly work on a few things.

I was going to try to call in my order, because I don't live very close by and I was going to be taking my two year old niece with me.  I didn't want to have to place my order and have to wait with my niece in tote.  

Anyhow, I called twice in a 15 minute time period, only to have the phone ring and receive a message that the voicemail system was not set up.  I didn't know if the place would even still be open - I thought that it may have possibly went out of business recently, since no one was answering the phone.

I decided to venture out anyway and if they were closed, I would just have to find an alternative.  When we got there, there was a group of three dining and their food looked delicious.  So, I was excited to give it a try.  The place is very dingy inside though.  It truly is a hole in the wall restaurant, but I always worry about the actually cleanliness of the kitchen when a place looks that run down.  (could just be the lighting and linoleum!)

The service was horrible.  When I walked in, the woman behind the counter immediately asked me what I wanted.  I politely told her that I would like to look at a menu briefly, because it was my first time there.  i was actually a bit confused, because there were so many ""meat"" options on the menu and I wasn't sure if the dish was actually served with real meat or if it was a meat substitute.  I'm not huge on meat substitutes.  I find that there are usually too many additives and sodium so I try to opt for something else.  I was very curious, however, and I really wanted to ask questions about the menu, but the woman was concentrating on balancing receipts and never looked up to help me.  I literally stood at the counter waiting right in front of her for two minutes before she looked up.

We ordered the Lemon Grass ""Beef"" and the Tofu with Mixed Vegetables.  i asked for both entrees to be vegan, which you have to pay a dollar extra for.  For the life of me, i don't understand why I had to pay a dollar more to make Tofu with Mixed Vegetables vegan.

We also ordered Watermelon and Lychee slushes. They were delicious and I slurped my down on the way home.  My niece really liked the Tofu and vegetables.  She thought it tasted like chicken.  

I'm actually a very good, creative cook - but I also love dining out and love to see what places have to offer. I was disappointed, because I was really going to Veggie Delight to have a restaurant experience (even though I was ordering out. - anywhere else I order out, people at least smile and ask me if I have any questions about the menu!)  I could have made everything that I ordered myself.

I'm from Hawaii and whenever I'm home, I am usually left to subsist on veggie sushi rolls, multi-grain bread, fruits/veggies and plain rice. If I feel like spending a fortune, I'll go to the local natural food store for my overpriced boca burger. 

Veggie-D basically takes a lot of those meaty plate lunches that are popular in Hawaii and they veganize it. They have ""fish, beef, chicken"" plates served with a small bowl of delectable multi-grain rice and a salad. I do enjoy their sandwiches(although tiny) and spring rolls. 

The only thing that I won't wholeheartedly praise are the portion sizes. I usually don't leave here feeling very full and that's probably a good thing since I have a bad habit of giving myself giant-sized portions at any opportunity.

The owner then was a lovely petite Asian Lady who was the sweetest person in the world - she would make the most amazing Sandwiches - my favorite was the Spicy Chicken Sandwich - the bread was superbly toasted, the paddies had just the right temperature - the herbs and salad was nicely arranged ! You could tell that you were dealing here with somebody who loves what she is doing - a hard-working person who is very proud of what she does - well that was then ! On Thursday I was back in Chinatown and a moment of melancholy brought me back to this establishment - oh boy do I regret setting foot in here ! There must have been a change in ownership since my last visit ! The person behind the counter was rude ! When I asked him to get me a wet cloth in order for me to clean the outside table and chairs he started screaming at me - since my Chinese is very bad I could not get the jest of it but : really - WTF ! I am a customer dude !!!! The food was even more disappointing then ordering it ! My spicy Chicken Sandwich was a f___ DISGRACE ! The bread must have gotten warmed up in a MicroWave : horrible ! It felt like I was eating a lukewarm, wet sponge - the VeggiePaddies were still cold - the carrot salad looked ( and tasted ) like Throw- Up !

It was not too clean so I was a bit uncomfortable eating here. We did NOT get sick after eating here so I might adventure out here next time i visit Vegas.
The Thi ice tea was too sweet but the mango slush was not too bad they used fresh mango but not enough of mango. Next time I will ask for extra mango.
For appitizers we had 
1. Hand rolled spring roll - It was pleasant mild flavor with rice noodles and some greens. The sauce was okey
2.Tofu strips - It was just bock of firm tofu cut into small cubes and sprinkled with some soy sauce I would not order it again.
For the main dish we had
1. Hawaiian fried rice was well made with the right amount of sauce and vegetables.
2. basil chicken was too soggy because the sauce it was served with. The sauce was some funny goop of something, THe sauce did not have the basil flavor, just some basil leaves were arranged on the side. Not much of basil chicken.  I would avoid it.
3.Vietnamese bean soup - was basically tasteless and so we added some of the mushroom chicken and its sauce.
4. Mushroom Chicken. Was better than the basil chicken. Less of the goopy sauce.

1224073,2012-04-11,1,bKbYRUZKDYonSPOjzchJJg,"Vegan food is pretty hard to come by in Las Vegas (or as my Dad calls it, Lost Wages...har har) so I really want to support those few options that do exist!

This place is truly a little hole-in-the-wall and a bit challenging to find. It's on the end of a long strip mall in what passes for a Chinatown in Las Vegas, which seems to be all different nationalities of Asian restaurants and businesses clumped together in one area. 

It's pretty lacking in the decor department, with fluorescent lights and all, and I did hear the monotonous monks-chanting soundtrack that another Yelper mentioned.
The ladies who work there are very friendly and helpful, however, and the food really makes up for these other issues.

I had ""chicken"" with mixed vegetables, with brown rice on the side. It was super-fresh and really delicious. The brown rice was probably the best I've ever had.
My husband had the peppered ""beef"" and veggies, which was waaay to heavy on the black pepper...you pretty much sneezed just looking at it, but very tasty nonetheless.
We shared the ""chicken"" loaf as an appetizer (bad name) which was good, but I'm not sure if I'd get it again.

We took home some leftovers and they were even better the next day in that weird way leftovers have...I think all the flavors had time to meld together for a great result!

They have a huge menu and next time I'm in Vegas I'll be sure to go back. 

So to sum it up:  if this place was in LA, where I live, I would go there all the time.

Veggie Delight is probably one of the smallest places I've been to but the food is delicious. It is very hole in the wall and only has about 8 tables so if you have the time, I recommend calling ahead and taking your order to go. Other than that, I have never been disappointed with their food. Chinatown has a lot to offer and this is one of the best!

My order always starts off with a Boba or Fresh Coconut to drink, vegan spring rolls & an order of soup or bahn mi. My favorite soups are the tomato or lemongrass beef. I'm usually not a big fan of fake vegan ""meat"" since I am rather picky when it comes to texture but Veggie Delight does it right! My favorite bahn mi is the vegan with avocado. The bread is a good, fresh piece of french bread, topped with pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalapeno and tofu. I also add extra sriracha to mine but that's just because I love super spicy food. Yum!

This restaurant is friendly to kids. However.. If you do plan on bringing kids here,  Remember that at this kind of place, it honestly depends on what your kids are like and willing to eat. For example, I have brought my nephews here many times ( They are 4 and 6 ) and they love it! They've also been exposed to eating healthier, vegan friendly or even exotic foods like Thai Papaya Salad or Sushi so keep this in mind if you're bringing a kid with you. If your kid turns their nose up at veggies or is an extemely picky eater, they probably wont like this place much. If all else fails, buy the kid a healthy but disguised as dessert fruit slush and call it a day :).",wQzVYwRRySCBsXPM4j-oZw,1,0,4,0Nu83ZMu3Lf9eaZkUnTgZQ

We came here after a bad experience at Pura Vida (see my other review) and well Pura Vida could learn a thing or two from Veggie Delight.  This is place is so damn good we actually came here two days in a row.  First day I ordered some vegan Pork sweet and sour, vegan shrimp spring roll and crunchy cucumber salad.  Yum, yum, yum.  The vegan shrimp is a little bland, but everything was still good.  I think all our food was on the table in about 10 minutes!  The next day we ordered the vegan beef spring roll, the vegan lemon grass beef sandwich and the vegan pork skin and avocado sandwich, crunchy spring rolls and taro boba tea.  Everything was AMAZING!  My favorites of the two days were the lemongrass beef sandwich and the sweet and sour pork dish.

There is something so magical and cute about this place... Esthetically it is actually kindof a hole in the wall but both times we came in here, all the customers were so happy to be there and talking to each other, we met locals and everyone was so friendly like a little happy community.

1268687,2007-08-03,0,bKbYRUZKDYonSPOjzchJJg,"My wife and I have been wanting to try Veggie Delight ever since they replaced ""Chicken Quick!"".  For some reason we waited more than 5 months to do it, and when we did, we regret not coming here any sooner!

I grew up in Taiwan, and while I am not a vegetarian, I enjoyed the vegetarian dishes a lot.  Most people here think vegetarian = salad, but not so in most Asian countries.

One of the things I missed most is the ""imitation meat"" products.  I know that sounds questionable at best, but it's just really various soy-based products, sometimes mixed with flour, to produce a meat-like texture.  Take their Vietnamese Vegetarian Lemon Grass Beef Rice Noodle for example, if you weren't told that there's no meat in that dish, you probably would not notice the ""beef"" you are eating is actually made with soy, and marinated in lemon grass sauce.  This cold noodles dish will definitely freshen you up in the hot desert weather.

My wife liked the Vegetarian Beef Noodle Soup, this is a Chinese style noodle soup that we are both familiar with, and she liked it a lot.  The soy-based soup base tasted surprisingly flavorful and complex without any meat in it.

Eating here is especially fun for someone who is already familiar with the ""regular"" Asian cuisines, and see the kind of twists they put on each dish to turn it into a completely vegetarian or vegan dish (if you want vegan, you need to tell them in advance when you order).  One of such dish is the Vegetarian Basil Leaf Chicken, commonly known as ""Three Cup Chicken"" on most Chinese restaurant menus.  Their version of the dish, other than replacing the chicken meat with soy-product (which tastes just as delicious in my opinion), is to put it in a bed of spring mix.  A bold move, and surprisingly tasty.  They effectively turned this into a warm salad dish!

This is a very small restaurant, with the capacity of about 10 people at most at a time.  Don't let the ""Veggie"" portion scare you away, the food is definitely good eats.  And if you are into it, it's healthy too! (But I only care about taste)",13oHusx9NQiXOtzGLHkWKA,2,1,4,L_lyHkC-3qeUBXmUw9oMtw

all the happy eating sounds that had been missing earlier in our gastronomical excursions over the weekend? well, let's just say they came out with a vengeance here. good thing i'm long past being too shy to eat in front of the mister, as i was in full on devour mode, and the food here fully warranted it. 

the mister ordered a strawberry mango slushie, the veggie egg roll and the tofu with spicy veggies, whilst i selected the spicy cucumber appetizer and the vegan version of the tofu with spicy veggies. as soon as that plate of lovely light green cucumber chunks came out, swimming in that gorgeously red, intensely, irresistibly hot sauce, we both knew we were in for a treat. everything was exceptional, and they even brought us out more of that delectable sauce. 

all in all, a huge delight (and a huge relief, as the mister had, not 20 minutes earlier, been almost been lured by the faux chinese fast food lying, ready made, in vats, at caesar's...). thank you to the woman behind the counter at ronald's donuts who recommended veggie delight!

The potstickers are served with a catsup like sauce in the bottom of the plate.

Soooo many yummy choices and a great one to pick is the crispy ""chicken"" and avocado Ban Mi sandwich. It's hard to find a veggie one in this town. Sometimes the breads have egg or they can only pile up a pile of veggies inside. 

I like the Thai Tea here because it's not too sweet and they always use nondairy. 

Their boba always looks good but not sure if it's vegan because they might use gelatin. I always forget to ask but I never choose boba option anyway. It's prob tapioca.

Walking in, the place is tiny. Like, ridiculously tiny. Very hole-in-the-wall, but don't let it turn you off, the food is worth it. When we came in we were handed some menus and literally everything is vegetarian. They have faux-meat things that I didn't think you could faux, like duck, pork, and shrimp. Fascinating. I decided against being too adventurous (even as a meat-eater I stayed away from the three I mentioned) and ordered the vegetarian beef with gravy that came with rice and vegetables, and a sour apple slush. My partner in vegetarianism for the evening chose a curry dish, pork skin hand rolls, and a passion fruit slush. 

The slushes came out quickly and they were delicious. I will definitely come back for these again as a large is $3.50 and will be great on hot summer days. The plate of meat and veggies was HUGE, but lacking slightly. I would have liked to see more actual veggies and less filler. The amount of meat was decent enough though, and I was definitely full afterward. The boyfriend said he liked his meal as well, but even though his curry bowl was huge there was more liquid than produce in it. I would like to see better portions of the good stuff since the price was a little high. 

The food is delicious, and the portion sizes are big just a little more expensive than I would have liked, but still decent. And something I have come to find out more and more is to bring cash to Chinatown because 95% of the restaurants around are cash-only.

She ordered a Lychee slush that was delicious. We ordered the Veggie Shrimp hand roll Vietnamese style - fantastic! They made them vegan for us and even the meat eater among us (me) loved them.  

My normal favorite item to order at the Pho place in Reno is the BBQ Pork with noodles so I ordered the vegetarian pork skin rice noodles here. It was really very good. I missed my hoisin sauce (or whatever it is called) and the rooster hot sauce, but they served it with a spicy hot sauce that was great. The 'pork skin' was very much like thin shreds of bacon bits (a LOT more tasty than some fake shaker bacon bits I've had too). It wasn't pork and I didn't expect it to taste porky, therefore it was very very good.

The menu is fairly simple, with apps, soups, Chinese dishes, and bahn mi-style sandwiches, as well as boba- all vegetarian or vegan, the boba beverages made with soy milk. Prices are low, service is friendly, and the only real downside is the cash-only policy, which I always forget about (or else I'd be by more frequently).

The crispy ""chicken"" and avocado sandwich is pretty solid- heads up that it's heaped with tons of shredded carrot, which can overwhelm the other flavors at times. The bread is also not the freshest, openly kept in the refrigerator by the front counter. But the flavors inside the sandwich? They work, and not in a way that obviously betrays the fake nature of the ""meat"".

Another fave is the Vietnamese handrolls- the pork skin version gets a lot of praise from in other reviews, but I stick to the beef, which has a surprisingly believable texture, even if the roll itself is a bit heavy on the noodles and lighter on the herbs and veggies than I'd like.

1897701,2010-02-07,2,bKbYRUZKDYonSPOjzchJJg,"I love vegetarian/vegan restaurants. There certainly aren't enough of them in Vegas. When I heard about Veggie Delight, it sounded just like Vegetarian Wok in LA, so I couldn't have been more excited to visit. I'm very disappointed to give the restaurant just two stars, but bad service easily rubs this hospitality student the wrong way.

The food is great. It's delicious, attractive, and the portion sizes are good. However, the service totally sucks. The door was propped open, so I spent my lunch bundled up in my coat (it was 50 degrees outside--and in.) We didn't wait very long to order, but it did take a while for food to arrive. We ordered drinks and entrees at the same time. One person's entree, drink and my drink arrived in 15 minutes. Five minutes later, the third person's drink (water!) and entree arrived. Five minutes after that, my entree arrived. I don't know why they didn't bring the drinks out first, and the entrees together, but it's not fun to be the person awkwardly eating by oneself or watching one's food get cold to avoid offending other people at the table who are still waiting.

The paper (takeout) menu says sandwiches come with chips, but when we asked, we were told it was only during certain hours. This is not noted anywhere on the menu and I can not believe they refused to spare a fifty cent bag of chips to make a customer happy. My entree was supposed to come with a ""fresh vegetable"" (noted on both the paper and in-restaurant menus) but I did not get that, either. I guess that's only during certain hours, too?

Overall, the food is good, but not enough to overcome the lack of service.",bFl0Cg7anF3yVN6dcX2Tbw,4,1,2,101BuilB9g_dQ9s3y9wtPg

Yeah nothing too fancy, not a lot of seating so order to go or decide who your best friends are and leave the other suckers at home.

Their Cash Only sign LIES!!! at the end of our little meal my friend and i freaked out cause none of us had cash that day but they took debit card so that sign LIES!!!

Food was interesting I has the Bamboo Duck soup and it tasted almost close to real bamboo duck soup cept it lacked the body that you get from boiling duck bones and rehydrated bamboo shoots. 

Kind of ironic how the direct translation in Vietnamese for going vegetarian is 'eating bland' where as going back to meat is 'eating salty' The bamboo duck coup was exactly that bland. My personal taste to everything must be either heavily seasoned or a bit on the high blood pressure inducing side and to me this soup was about five shades on the bland side. Now when i say bland i dont mean it lacks flavor it had a bit of flavor from bamboo but lacked the salty and savory punch you only get some fish sauce. Oh and they dont use fish sauce here so dont expect none...

The bamboo shoots that were in the soup were obviously canned and too little. The mock-duck ""meat"" had that taste of duck but it didnt last too long, texture was okay and there was also way too little of it. There was preserved pickled mustard but again so little that it was more of a tease then a garnish or an addition to the dish. Personally i wouldnt order this again and most likely wouldnt order any of the soups again.

Why? Well for one i'm Viet and i know what these dishes are suppose to taste like to the point where i can try to recreate something with about 75% accuracy if i try it at home. Two in most Viet broths you need animal bones to get flavor, body, and aroma to soups these kinds of ingredients this place obviously cant use. and Three i'm not a vegetarian nor am i trying to be vegetarian i'm just curious to see how skillful this place is in mimicking tofu or mushrooms to resemble meat. Lastly Five, the backbone to most Vietnamese dishes is FISH SAUCE, we'll power our scooters with it and feed our babies with it if we could. This place doesnt use any and could give me an alternative so regardless of how close they can get something to taste like meat it's always going to be lacking that fish sauce.

The tofu nuggets were complete different. pretty much sliced up tofu served in a sauce that's suppose to mimic a fish sauce caramalization reduction. It had the look and the color but wasnt thick or had that flavor but was good regardless. The tofu was also quite interesting. Between the two commercially known types of tofu (talkin bout silken and firm) this was a type i've never tried before, it was firm yet tender, and had a little play to it. It was close to meat kind of. Sort of like vietnamese fish paste that's been fried (oh gods how i miss fish paste that isnt pre cooked or formed into the shape of a tube...)

Anyway If i'm in the general area i'll come back and give something else a try but it's very not likely i'm going to go out of my way to eat here. There's plenty of alternatives for omnivores out there.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,4,2,3,Ir4Td386q2tgbiyWAxN6pg

1990133,2015-05-23,0,bKbYRUZKDYonSPOjzchJJg,"I read through the reviews, and I see that the negative comments fall into a few categories: They don't speak English; they don't take cash; I personally hate my life and want to damn them for a boba tea that wasn't perfect; they charge a ""vegan tax"" and should be damned to heck; and there was an inconsistent experience.

That said, I found Veggie Delight Delightful for this experience. As a vegan, I understand it sometimes costs more to use vegan products and don't find it unfair that a small business that has a hard time taking credit cards passes this on to the consumer. I was one of the people who didn't read the sign about cards; thankfully, there was a bank two seconds across the street where I could withdraw funds. Although we had ""language troubles,"" I did this weird thing where I pointed at an item on the menu, and it was brought to me. 

It appears to be a small ""mom and pop"" type joint! There was a little kid who was family of some type playing a game--probably very bored to sit there instead of having fun. The place was small, but clean. I don't recall a bathroom. The service was quick. 

I ordered the Vietnamese beef wraps, which were faux beef spring rolls; the dumplings, Vietnamese beef style noodle soup and a two faux sandwiches to go--Spicy Beef, which I'm eating right now) and Chicken and Avocado.

Everything was ""tasty enough."" I had to ask for Sriracha and Hoisin Sauce for my soup, which had none of the traditional accompaniments. 

Could they have better customer service? Absolutely, there are some opportunities. The food is flavorful and the faux meats have good texture. The food came quickly and they were responsive when needed. They have a fair-priced, scare commodity, and it takes good. I laughed at the people from California who thought the food was overpriced--apparently they were comparing the food to McDonalds, which doesn't make any sense. 

I hope the next time I go the service is consistent, but this isn't one of those experiences where my life will end if it doesn't. Thanks for being there Veggie House",DbBpcxcTCwHxXxswVcgILw,2,0,4,c-04RKjaj_kYD6yiuOhWTg

They serve standard Asian noodle and rice dishes as well as sandwiches and rolls. I tried the spring roll, and avocado and crispy chicken sandwich. The roll had faux beef and the sandwich had faux chicken of course. While I was able to detect that they were not actually meat, it was pretty tasty anyways. The sandwich and rolls were actually above average for the Asian places I've been to.

2104309,2016-04-01,1,bKbYRUZKDYonSPOjzchJJg,"I came here on Easter Sunday and dined alone. They don't have a wifi network, but the password to 'Flamingo Pizza' is Flamingo Pizza's phone number, so I was able to guess it and enjoy the internet while I ate.

I asked the hostess if there are any entrees she recommends, and she gave me firm answers. Her third recommendation (and they seemed to be coming in order) was what I was leaning towards on my own, the sweet and spicy tofu, so I went with that. I liked that she really answered me.

Often when I'm by myself I'll take the food to go. But it felt non-awkward to me to eat alone here, and I chose to take a seat. ""I'll eat it here"", I said.

The food came out at a perfect temperature, right at the cusp of where you don't need to manage for burnt tongue. And it maintained its temperature as I ate. When I cook Asian food for myself it's way more binary, from too hot to too cold with only a small window in the ideal range. It was a real treat to enjoy the wider window.

The dish was completely delicious and I wanted to eat it 10 times. 

The drinking water was at a perfect temperate too -- somewhere in between room temp and ice cold. I don't like my water really cold, I don't need it to challenge me. I'm inclined to think they have strong attention to detail here.

For $11.84 (after tax, before tip), it isn't a bargain, for the amount of food.

Their menu gives a 'vegetarian' and a 'vegan' option for each item, which is handy -- you don't have to ask about everything and have a cumbersome time ordering. But it seems unfriendly that the vegan choice is a slightly higher price. Is your operating cost actually higher to make the vegan version? Most of this food is inherently vegan anyways, once it's vegetarian. And any conventional restaurant would leave out the egg or make whatever tweak without charging you for it. So after you have the ah-ha moment, you feel betrayed that a restaurant who brands themselves as vegetarian would be the ones charging you to veganize a dish when everyone else would do it for free. 

The value and menu trick is their only blemish, and it's enough to cost them a star. The eating experience itself was near perfect. I'd like to see them offer the vegan and vegetarian versions for the same price, and then I can revisit this.",Xk6eltDay-oOPeVWwFy34w,8,2,4,snuOw6D6u7zmf7Q6GM_J-w

2792736,2011-08-01,0,bKbYRUZKDYonSPOjzchJJg,"I really liked this place. I was in Vegas over the weekend. I'm a vegetarian,  and my bf is a vegan. I did some research before leaving Los Angles, and I had this place on my list. We tried it, and I think it was quite good. I got the mushroom chicken dish (vegan), chow mein (which wasn't called chow mein -- just ask and they'll tell you what to get), and the sweet and sour chicken (vegan). All of it was quite good. There was a lot of pepper on our food. It seemed to be the last thing that they put on, like some sort of a garnish or something. If you don't like pepper, or you're ordering for your kid like me, tell them to hold the pepper. My son really loved the mushroom chicken plate, even though I ordered him the chow mein dish, which I thought was pretty good. 

One thing to note, if you're trying to get there from off the strip: Coming off Las Vegas Blvd, on one side the street says Spring Mountain and on the other side it says Sands, just FYI. I only saw the Sands sign and went right on by it. After I turned around, there was the other sign right in front of my face. Annoying!  

I agree with someone else about the Vegas strip, it was the worst for Vegans and Vegetarians. Sheesh! A lot of places didn't even have a veggie burger option. This place is a great alternative.

With Buddhist owners, their menu consists of Asian vegetarian cuisine, from entrees to quick snacks like Vietnamese sandwiches and pearl tea drinks.  Most items can be made vegan, usually at an extra cost.  

The language barrier made it difficult to get any recommendations and inquire about menu items.  Vegans will have an even tougher time confirming what is or isn't vegan.  A couple dining at the same time had to leave to the hospital because the girl had some sort of food allergy reaction; the staff was continually apologizing, and I'm convinced this may have been due to the communication problem. 

Only a few tables are set up for dine in at this small establishment.  I had a chicken steak dish, which my brother promptly put in an order for after seeing how good it smelled and looked.  Fortunately, the taste was just as good.  But his dish came out with a different presentation due to extra vegetables.  I was jealous.  The szechuan dumplings were good, as well (listed under noodles, but turned out to be more like an appetizer).

Food comes out as quickly as it's made so you will be disappointed if you're expecting a traditional sit-down.  We ordered the spicy chicken sandwich (fantastic); the basil chicken (also delish); the pork-skin summer roll (while it was certainly good, the pork skin ratio to the rest of the innards was lacking -- would recommend more pork skin to balance this one out); and the ginger tea (both cold and hot -- FANTASTIC!).

We ordered dumplings, beef and mushroom lo mein noddle dish, beef pho, and a ""mushroom"" sandwich. There are quotations because there was no mushroom in the sand which. The sandwhich was all celery and cabbage. I would not recommend this dish. There is a sign at their door that says once the food is cooked and served that there is no refund. We did mention we wanted a mushroom sandwhich and i believe the waitress had to pay for our sandwhich. The dumplings did not have enough stuffing and did taste previously frozen. I liked the pho and noodle dish. Next time, I would not order beef because it tastes like soy. I would order everything all veggie.

It's a VEGGIE chicken sandwich. Don't be so cheap!

Everyone was there before us and no one had gotten their food yet. Then it became apparent why... the owner taking orders at the register was a hysterical mess! You could feel her tension and I wanted to cancel my order. We listened as new customers came in to order... she was so frantic she kept running back and forth to the kitchen fussing at her staff. Every time she would get part of an order written down she would go in the back, reiterate the order, come back to the register and ask the customer to repeat what they wanted. What in the hell was the point of her taking down the order to begin with?! A high school drop out could have handled this task with much less stress and ciaos. It was hot as hell inside. We would have ordered the veggie pho, but with the door open and the heat from the kitchen we decided against it.

I went there yesterday afternoon to eat anything vegetarian while on my 2 2 day vacation in Vegas.Vegas is one of the worst places i have been to for a vegetarian or vegan.

I searched and searched for something nearby the strip where i was staying and this was fairly close.You catch bus 203 on Spring mountain  road and it'll drop you off on Wynn.Its located in a plaza with a buch of other Chinese store.You're in China town and it's located across the street  from the Bank of America.

I got a bowl of Chicken Pho,a Chocolate Boba and a Spicy Chicken Bhan Mi sandwich.

The boba came out first and ill say that it was ok, but ive had better quality boba here in L.A.It was kind of slushy  like and not the most chocolatly tasting.You'll have to try it to understand what i mean!

The spicy Bhan mi sandwich came out second, and i give that a 5 out of a 5.I hated how it cost like $4.50 for a small sandwich but at least the fake chicken meat was top quality!

The 3rd thing to come out was the Pho.I specifically asked for Chicken Pho as opposed to the Beef Pho they had on the menu.I dont like the taste of fake beef broth.The lady brought over a decent, (not big) size of Chicken Pho with fake beef broth in it.. not so sure but it didnt taste like vegetable or chicken broth!

The chicken looked sickening.Although i knew i was at a vegetarian restaurant the chicken looked too real to be true.It looked like real chicken fat .

I really didnt like real chicken fat before i became a vegetarian, so i didnt like it here either.I think what messed up the Pho was the beef broth taste to it.. not to mention that the lady only gave one small little plate of brussel sprouts and no onions  or jalapenos on it as the regular sides you normally get with Pho.

Everything was ok but not the best.. like i always say.Its a vegetarian small Chinese or Vietnamese(NOT SURE) restaurant in Vegas  near the strip. If i come back to Vegas again soon, ill be sure to try some more menu items out to be sure...

This'll help someone or two that is, or might be experiencing the same problems i had there for 2 days.Although i hate living in  L.A, im so glad i live in an area with great vegetarian options for everyday people like myself  and so many others like me.",jTX1ys0y0Gw-K5zXpfuzBA,5,4,3,2EzgYQTDqdDAyXPCqOHBZg

To start, I ordered a couple appetizers: Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce and sweet and sour soup. The soup was piping hot as was the broccoli, so if ever you're looking to shack up on a cold, dreary day in Vegas--yeah, I know, it happens so much, right?--then this is the place to come.

I must not have had Chinese broccoli before because I was expecting something more along the lines of broccoli raab. Nonetheless, it was good and very fresh. I would have liked it to have been cooked a little more tender, but it was probably prepared the traditional way.

The sweet and sour soup wasn't what I was expecting either but really had quite a nice flavor, reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce yet less intense.

For my entree, I had Vietnamese lemon grass beef noodles vegan-style. Wow, this was a very well-balanced dish with subtle lemon grass and aromatic basil. Unlike some Vietnamese noodle dishes, this one was so moist and just a joy to eat.

Overall, the food was out-of-the-ordinary but really quite good. My only complaint would be its confused menu. Despite being a vegetarian-focused restaurant, also offering vegan options for nearly every dish, so many of them have a jarringly meat-centric names. It almost makes you wonder if it's actually vegetarian or that you're about to get kind of meat product mistakenly masqueraded as vegetarian. I mean, beef this and pork skin that. It's a bit too much and almost seems like a desperate apologist's approach to vegetarian cooking. Plus, is there really a difference between an imitation beef sandwich and an imitation beef steak sandwich? Also, despite many dishes offered in both vegetarian and vegan variants, in most cases it's hard to imagine a practical difference between the two. In sum, Veggie Delight has an odd menu that would benefit greatly from simplification, but, oh well, definitely a place worth trying.",H7nMhozULoi6AqjNPe5V_w,2,0,3,fyd3dClMZxMvltZIVui67w

So I decided to check this place out and have a full lunch hear with my food buddy, Ross.  He's not a vegetarian but very open so came with me to try it out..

I of course ordered a strawberry Boba drink and started our meal with my fave, veggie shrimp rolls.. Ross was impressed by them as I knew he would be..

I ordered the veggie mushroom chicken and he ordered the veggie pork chop; each with sides of rice. In spite of me almost ruining lunch by dumping my glass of water across the table, we jumped into the dishes tasting each one as they arrived at the table.

Of the two, the mushroom chicken was my favorite. It had a yummy  brown sauce on it that I poured over my rice. I liked the fact that the pork chop had a last of vegetables surrounding it but was my lesser favorite of the two..

As with any FOB Asian places you'll have a couple of misspellings on the menu and what not, but it's easily understandable so not a problem at all! Just thought I'd throw it out there.

One of the only purely vegetarian establishments in Las Vegas, Veggie Delight is the savior of our weekly ""what do we eat tonight?"" predicament. Their Vietnamese sandwiches (pork chop, crispy chicken and spicy chicken) are amazing. They come in soft french bread and have mayo (or vegenaise), soy meat (trust me, it's good here) and a little pickled salad of sorts with cucumber, cilantro and carrots on it. It's a very filling and satisfying sandwich. They've started to offer their sandwiches as part of a lunch special. About 5 bucks for a sandwich, soup and hot/cold tea. Very very reasonable. 

Yes, this is not a ritzy place. It's actually very far from that. The staff here is seriously challenged with grasping the English Language and the menu ...not at all appetizing. But voila....the food they come up with is amazing, consistent and very satiating. Service is efficient (remember the language barrier but pointing to pictures on the menu helps lots).

Our favorites are the following:

Vietnamese Faux Crispy Chicken/Pork Chop/Spicy Chicken Sandwiches

Basil Faux Chicken

Taiwanese Faux Beef Noodle Soup

Faux Pork Skin Hand Rolls

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because there's a little racial preference thing going on here. We visited twice during our week-long stay in Vegas, and BOTH times they gave preference to Chinese people who showed up after us while we were waiting to be seated. Groups would show up, speak in Chinese, laugh a little, and then would be seated immediately. On both of our dinner visits, we had to wait approximately 15 to 20 minutes for a table.

I figured it's possible that these Chinese guests had made a reservation. So I tried to make a reservation for our second dinner trip and was told that they could not give me a reservation.

A good size portion of curry sauce but I have to make extra rice when I got home. The smell of the curry got me very hungry. I almost ate it standing in the kitchen.
I payed extra for Vegan. I have no idea why because the last time I checked Almond milk cost the same as soy/regular milk. Overall the place is small so take out is good. The taste of the curry was spicy and flavorful. The chix was a little chewy and full of body. I enjoyed a great deal. Will order it again.

Total $11.50. I don't like when places nickel and dime you but so many places on the strip do anyway. So this wasn't highway robbery.

I decided on the ""crispy chicken"" banh mi, spicy chicken w/ veggies which arrived with a side of soup and rice.

The banh mi lacked flavor as well as skimped on the insides, something I've seen so many banh mi spots do out here in LV. The spicy chicken entree fared a lil better, little bite sized chunks of fried faux chicken with cabbage and a variety of veggies, came in a distant second after my boba drink.

The overall food at Veggie Delight is average and slightly over priced, but considering that they are one of the only games in town maybe it justifies their prices.

I've only been here twice now.  And both times I've ordered the same thing, a tofu vegetable mix with spicy sauce.  This place misrepresented spicy. This dish was F-N hot!  But oh, so very very tasty.  I'm hooked.  The tofu wasn't your usual boring bland tofu but rather a tofu that had minced vegetables in it.  The vegetables it sat on were mainly shredded cabbage (I love cabbage), green beans, broccoli, corn, and maybe some others.

My hubby has tried a few of their other dishes.  But of course we can't remember what they were.  He liked them.

I'll admit, our first visit the service was good.  The owner took care of us.  Our second visit was slow and somewhat unfriendly but none the less, we still enjoyed our food.  Too bad it's so pricey.  $9 for a tofu vegetable plate?  Really?

Were not from the area, so whenever im in Vegas without my family, I'll pick up a few sandwiches to bring home for them.

The hole-in-the-wall restaurant is owned and operated by a couple of Chinese Buddhists. The menu is 100% vegetarian. They have French-style sammiches, dumplings, spring rolls. They use tofu and meat-like substitutes. My vegetarian aunty sometimes complains that the meat substitute is ""too meat-like."" Is that a bad thing?

Half my family are vegetarians or pseudo-vegetarians in search of good friendly restaurants.

A friend, who is not vegetarian has been urging me to check it out, so we finally made a plan to go visit this spot. Veggie Delight is in one of the many busy and crowded shopping centers in China Town. If I wasn't with a friend who had gone there before, I don't think I would have ever found the place. It was very clean inside, and the menu was very easy to navigate, and had many pictures that made the food look good. The menu is littered with entrees and sandwiches with fake meat. While I don't typically have a problem with fake meat, I was a little worried about this place because there are a lot of fake meat options. With dozens of options on the table, I decided to go with one that I used to get when I was still eating meat, the sweet and sour pork. The food did take a long time to come as other reviewers mentioned, and my food arrived 10 minutes before my friend's food arrived. The portion size was a bit small compared to other Thai/Chinese places I have been, but the food was good. The fake meat had a good texture and seasoning. While it didn't taste a lot like pork, it had a ""bacony"" hint to it. My friend had a chicken dish, and I was very impressed with the fake chicken. When I go back to Veggie Delight, I will definitely get a dish with the ""chicken"". The restaurant also offers many different types of drinks, which would also be very exciting to try. I hope to try them soon. When we were there they only took cash, which for being in Vegas is a huge problem.

The restaurant is clean and simple.  It fits about 15 people tops so be prepared to wait a little around dinner time. Warning they take CASH ONLY. 

My top three suggestions is the durian (if you like the fruit) slush, crispy pork skin spring roll and the Vietnamese lemongrass ""beef"" cold noodle.  I know the noodles may look dry in photos but the savory sauce is at the bottom to mix.  The durian slush-smoothie is one of the best I've had in town so far.

We ordered the ""albalone"" appetizer, ""beef fun"" dish, and ""beef"" sandwich.  The first thing I noticed was that all the vegan versions of the dishes were priced higher ($.50-$1) than the vegetarian versions (they all list both prices).  Since typically for a vegan meal you are taking away an animal product (eg, egg) this doesn't seem fair, but maybe there is something else making it more expensive I'm not aware of. 

On to the food - in summary, the flavors were uneremarkable, and in the end (about one hour afterward) we were hungry again and our stomachs were a little upset. 

The abalone was just like a thick noodle/starch with no flavor (the sauce was very good).  The beef fun dish was good, but greasy and unfilling - it seemed like sprouts were the go-to filler. The sandwich was plain with the same ""beef"" and many shredded carrots on a soft bun. 

From other reviews it appears we should have ordered different dishes, which would warrant the higher ratings reflected. So perhaps we just chose the wrong options. If I were in town longer I might return to try the crispy chicken or crispy pork rolls.  It's great that LV has this much-needed option in town for veg food - since it appears to be a well-loved establishment.

The strip-mall in which Veggie Delight sits is packed. It's on the end by the shopping light, around the corner from the main strip. It has all the charm of an asian restaurant in a strip mall but that's fine because we're not there for fine dining.

We went with some noodle dishes and pot stickers. The stickers were great: not too mushy and full of flavor. Our noodle dishes were both very good, though we couldn't figure out who's was who's, so we just shared. Honestly I don't remember what we got (Beijing noodles and something else perhaps?). Each of our dishes was neither too spicy nor too salty.

I ALWAYS end up going to Thai Noodle thinking: ""Oh, I will try Veggie Delight next time."" Today was the official ""next time"" when I actually carried out the plan. 

I am glad I did. The place is a hole in the wall, but very clean, and the energy in the space is very positive (sounds like new age mojo, but it is just true). The staff is all very friendly, positive and helpful. I saw one complaint about a language barrier, but when we went our server spoke wonderful English and was able to make several recommendations. 

The menu features a large selection of fake meat with everything from fake beef noodle soup to Chinese style entrees to banh mi. They also have numerous teas, slushes and coffees, which can all be made with soy. Plus, they have gluten-free and vegan options. A+ for variety. 

We had pepper steak and crispy chicken banh mi sandwiches and a pork skin roll. The fake meats were flavorful, and their textures were appealing. The sandwiches were small, and I would have liked more pickled vegetables. The pork skin roll was okay. I think they over crisped the fake pork skin, and it tasted a bit burnt, but the rolls were large and full of lots of cabbage, noodles and cilantro. 

They charge extra if you want to use your charge card. My recurring complaint about Spring Mountain Road establishments is their credit card policies, but oh well, just bring cash. 

Based on my experience, I will probably return to Veggie Delight, but I would definitely appreciate a bigger sandwich for $4.50.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,2,3,z8VHaB0TrhLBCobYYZhtfw

Being told that this place has the freshest tapioca in town, we thought it would be a good time to give it a try. 

I had originally ordered the durian,  the fruit that smells like feet, but they ran out. I then asked for the mixed vegetable juice, but the lady did not know how to make it. Eventually, I decided  on the avocado. At this point, I had thoroughly disgusted my friend with all my choices and she vowed to stay away from my drink, so bonus.  My friend had ordered the banana and was not overly fond of it. 

The rating is not due to the fact that they ran out, or the service was bad, but it was because the boba was too fresh or soft. The pearls at the bottom of my drink were piping hot and had no consistency or texture. As I began to chew, the surprise hit me, I felt no give as they disintegrated.

As others mentioned as well, the language barrier was difficult to overcome, but I did end up getting everything I asked for. I ordered a lunch special that came with a sandwich, soup and tea for $4.99. Sounded like a great deal! I also got an order of the hand rolls to take on the road with me, as I was about to trek back to Phoenix after eating. First, my sandwich came out, which I ate quickly as I was extremely hungry. I thought to myself ""gee, maybe I shouldn't have gotten those hand rolls. I'm pretty full now..."" Then, they came out. I forced myself to eat one because I wanted to try them, and they were very tasty. At this point, I figured she must have forgotten my soup so I asked for a to-go box for my remaining hand rolls. A few minutes later, my soup came out. It looked beautiful- carrots, broccoli, and cabbage in a clear broth. I devoured it, knowing I could use the nutrients after a weekend in Vegas. I was stuffed, but satisfied. I waited awhile for my check which never came, so I just ended up walking up to the counter to ring up. Somehow my meal ended up at $17 even though the lunch special was supposed to be $4.99 and the handrolls were $5.50, but I didn't feel like getting into it. I will agree with some previous reviewers that the whole up-charge for vegan items is pretty bogus. I seriously doubt that they have two batches of every kind of mock-meat, one vegan and one not. My gut tells me it's all the same. Also, the charge to pay with a credit card is pretty lame too. Again, this place was on the fence between getting three or four stars.

I'm an omnivore, but my wife goes back and forth with vegetarian and vegan foods. Whatever floats her boat, I say.  We got a small table right away, and it was moderately full around noon. The parking 
and traffic were a bit annoying, so you would do well to go at off-hours.

The sparse restaurant was a no-nonsense affair. Menus lacked food descriptions or photos (save for a few items on the back). Tables were small and the chairs were hard. Don't come here for the fine-dining atmosphere.

The boba tea's and slush(ies) seemed to be the more popular items that warranted photos on the walls. We ordered the coconut and honeydew slush w/boba. Both were tasty, even on a chilly winter's day.  My wife had the basil chicken with mushrooms. I had the Taiwanese style noodle soup (chicken and beef). Surprisingly, both were well spiced and flavorful. I actually like the substitute chicken, as it has a similar mouthfeel and can be flavored just like the blank-slate that chicken usually is. The beef was disappointing in both flavor and texture. More of a soggy cardboard that somehow stayed intact in the broth. The soup broth was tasty, and served piping hot. Portion size was large enough for generous leftovers. 

Service could have been quicker (at least for the drinks), but it wasn't an unreasonable wait.

Vegetarian pork skin rolls: I probably would've believed these were actually crispy pork skins if no one had told me. Great appetizer that was tasty but light. 

Vegetarian Black Pepper Beef Steak with Special sauce: This was great. The consistency of the protein was as close to beef as I've had at a vegetarian joint and the sauce was great. 

Vegetarian Fish Steak with Mixed Vegetables: They shaped the protein like mini filets of sea bass with black skin etc but it was still tofu in the end. Not bad but the ""beef"" was way better. Sauce was sweet which I wasn't so into either.

pros:
- all vegetarian
- cheap, depending on what you order.  this is vegas, after all...
- tasty, fresh, and very unique food
- pleasant service

cons:
- location is a tough to find, and you absolutely have to drive to it (note: just because it's on wynn road in NO WAY means it's located near the wynn!)
- very casual atmosphere... clean, though
- slight language barrier, but friendly service once you realize this
- weird dual pricing depending on if you want your dish vegan (more expensive) or vegetarian (cheaper for some reason).  when i asked our server what the difference is, she replied ""dairy"".  dairy in chinese/thai/viet food?  that seems odd... especially when you see the menu items.

based on all the yelp love, we ordered the veggie pork skin rice noodle salad.  holy shit, this was AMAZING!!!  super flavorful, crispy, full of fresh veggies, and not heavy.  yum!!  we also ordered the basil chicken because i just love this kind of dish.  it was really good and came with fresh vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, and snap peas.  we requested brown rice with it instead of white rice and some hot sauce on the side.  delicious!   both these dishes were very unique tasting, and the pork skin noodle salad was unlike anything i've ever had or seen.  we finished everything and left with happy, full bellies and ready for a night of boozing, gambling,and other unmentionable activities.  ;)

- expensive given the quality and small portions.
- vegan tax.  You have to pay more to make the vegetarian dishes vegan.  No reason is provided and I have a feeling that there is no good reason why the vegan one costs ~$1 more.

Service is fast and friendly. My experience with the language barrier was difficult to come by, but given this IS in Chinatown, I'm not going to be hard on that. Ordered the seaweed salad with special sauce. Definitely the best quality seaweed I've came across yet; dark green, tied into little bows, and you can order the degree of spiciness at your whim (I decided to not have it spicy, and it was delicious in itself). Don't expect a big plate of this, it's small but small enough to take your time and savor.

I also ordered the mixed vegetarian hand roll (Bo Bi). Two mixed hand rolls with a spicy dipping sauce to spoon on, absolutely delicious! Finished it off with an iced green aoole tea with boba, and I have to say I've never tasted green aoole tea before, but now because of Veggie Delight, I'm hooked on it!

Word to those unfamiliar with vegetarian/vegan diets: Don't expect the entrees or items here to be large. This is a perfect place for a light healthy lunch, and the small plates are a mechanism for you to slow down and savor your bites.

As high-profile as our hotel's restaurants were, the availability of eating options for non-carnivores was lacking. Me being just under a few months old as a vegan, I thankfully was able to trust in my handy dandy Yelp app to locate vegan/vegetarian places in the area and was led to Veggie Delight. At first I was a little confused reading the menu because all over it I read options with the words ""chicken, shrimp, beef, pork"" in them. After looking at the pictures and reading the reviews, I was even more excited to learn of and even more anxious to experiment with several of the meatless options and see their take on carnivorous selections. I was tickled at the fact that it likened many of the Chinese carry outs I'm used to in that they boasted Chinese and American cuisine. Had they've included soul food, I surely thought I was back in Baltimore.

I purchased the Basil Leaf Chicken entree, Spicy Chicken sandwich, Pork spring roll and Shrimp spring roll. My least favorite was the basil leaf chicken. I could barely finish half the container, it had way too much ginger in it. The meat used in it was also not cooked as thoroughly as I would have preferred. It needed to be crisp as opposed to soft and rubbery as the meat seemed to squeak while chewing. My favorite was the chicken sandwich. There's this carrot mixture they use as a topping/spread and the seitan had a nice spicy sauce/marinade that was a great match to the sweet tasting wheat roll the held it together. For the price paid, I would have liked a bit more of the ""chicken"" mixture but if you were eating this with any type of side (chips, etc) you would be satisfied. 

As far as the spring rolls were concerned, what the other Yelpers stated holds true-go for crunchy!!!  The rice paper wrapped round the rolls became sticky and hard to maneuver without everything falling all over the place. It's unfortunate that the shrimp roll doesn't come crunchy. Perhaps some suggestions should be made to them about this. The contents inside were great matches though and the shrimp substitute was delightful. The pork roll had some type of mushroom appeal to it but the color matched and the taste was convincing once you poured the complimentary chili oil on it. 

I also purchased an avocado slush and boy was it delicious! The variety in both flavors and milks (soy or almond) they offered was great and the cups they serve the slushes in are vacuumed sealed so as to prevent spillage.

While she was initially friendly after we were seated it became our responsibility to flag her down for everything...take our order, find her to ask for condiments (i.e. get up from our seat and call for her in the back), ask for our check.  Seriously, no other customers were there so why did it take so long to take our order and bring our food? I think she was more interested in having a social conversation with some guy in the back than her customers. And after the food was served she NEVER once checked on us!

2) Bland, poorly prepared, cheap, frozen, poor excuse for vegetarian food: I have no idea what was being chopped because all we got was what looked like pre-packaged vegetables.  The vegetarian ""meat"" is frozen crap.  The tomato tofu rice noodle soup was a watery tasteless mess. The crispy chicken patty (one tiny flat patty) served with a measly pile of cruddy lettuce and a dried out scoop of old rice was disgusting.  And to top it off the ""pork skin"" rolls were just fried won ton bits with a smudge of noodles and lettuce cabbage mix... Ick!  To top it all off all 3 dishes were clearly ""prepared"" (I use that word loosely in this case) with little to no care...slopping food on a plate. Very sad.

3) Expensive and overpriced crappy food:  the ""pork"" rolls were $5.50, soup $9 and crispy chicken $9. The chemical tasting Thai tea $3.50 and durian shake $5.  Total bill was $34.70. I have had all you can eat Chinese vegetarian buffet for $8/person.

To top it all off the portions are so small...I am still hungry. Damn.  Time for In-n-Out!  End rant.",aYt6yemtPLX1RbX7UT6KCw,4,1,1,3NrUOH1QKAoqfTNGv2yaKQ

When my hubby and I came to LV we tried to eat off the strip and although we were on a holiday from our vegan diet (do I dare say such a thing?), this was our favorite place dine. We would eat here for dinner, then off to Cirque du Soleil!! 

Boba tea here is THE BEST we've had. (Boba??) I was in love with the Spring Rolls.  (Why do we live in Montana? Oh yeah, it's pretty??) We were so in love with the Veggie dishes with the delicious vegan meat, we never had time to try the Vegan Bahn Mi. 

We'll be back first thing when we're in Vegas again!!",4bQqil4770ey8GfhBgEGuw,2,2,5,P-TaYxmfKi18otEalITylg

The lady at the counter was the sweetest thing, and once looking around it felt so warm and home-y. I overheard the customers talking about being regulars and recommending dishes to other customers so the place is making a name for itself.

Stopped by for a drinks with my date and ordered the lotus seed with coconut milk, and she ordered the Thai tea with boba; neither of us were disappointed one bit. Didn't get a chance to get food, but the menu had a huge selection of vegetarian-friendly dishes, so I'll have to come back next time in Chinatown.",56I9CNu-HyqpCxsOXroJXQ,0,0,4,DxM_zC6pZtaPZVIhbIT5IQ
