We were greeted when we came in and the lady asked if we would like to sample anything which was nice. I ordered her food but they forgot to give me teriyaki sauce for her teriyaki chicken so I had to ask for it and then ice machine was not producing ice so I let one of the ladies know and she said there is nothing that they could do about the machine.,nCMKIZSreHpKO89idVoSRg,0,0,3,zHbSog-fvz2ETco4f6Ew0A

3044367,2011-08-21,0,wShT0KXCW0ZAnNKdJr_1pg,"I searched for Panda Express and this location is not listed.

I have been to most of the Panda Express locations on the west side of town and generally like the food. I typically have orange chicken and bejing beef, if I have one of the survey receipts I will try something different for the free third entree.

I especially like the store located at Buffalo and Lake Mead and the store at Durango just north of Centenial.

That brings me to the Charleston/Hualapai store. I have been there twice and both times the portions have been smaller than I am used to at other locations. The entree size is about 1/2 to 2/3 what is received at other locations. The rice and chow mein servings are typical of other locations.

The first time I went, I noticed the smaller portions, but figured it may be a fluke since all the other stores serve larger portions. I was working in the area and the store was convenient, so I thought I would give it another try, same result, smaller portions. So I have to assume this is typical of this particular store.

Since there are many Panda Expresses around town and they are not that far apart, it is worth the extra 5 minutes to go to a different location, for the larger portions, at least for me. Others have to make that decision for themselves.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,2,0,2,UA-wi9HVVpWF8Yxd77B06A

4014441,2014-01-01,0,wShT0KXCW0ZAnNKdJr_1pg,"This Panda Express in the heart of Summerlin, is probably one of the much better ones I've been to in a long time.  I don't get that fast food-y, get in, get out, next person in line feeling that I always get when I visit them in the mall.  This Panda Express is a lot more like a real restaurant.

The inside is very inviting, and surprisingly very clean.  The tables and chairs are new, and they actually have leatherette benches for folks to sit on.  The decor is light and open, in no way cheesy or kitschy with too many bright colors like other Panda Express restaurants.  Mind you, we got here right after they opened at 11 AM so the place was pretty empty and hadn't had its lunch rush yet.  

Upon inspection of the food line, all on it was super fresh.  The rice and noodles were fresh, all cooked items were fresh and not sitting under the heat lamps for long.  Nothing was soggy, and nothing was dry looking.  Very good sign!  Glad we got there for the early bird rush because the food was actually looking tasty.  And for what it's worth for a Panda Express (home of Americanized 'Chinese' food) my 3-item combo was in great order.

Service was friendly with a smile, and I wasn't rushed at all.  With my 3-item combo I got the usual suspects:

-Half & Half of Chow Mein and Mixed Vegetables (gotta watch my girlish figure)
-Mushroom Chicken (Wok Smart item - under 250 calories a serving!)
-Broccoli Beef
-Orange Chicken (always in a little take out box for me)

I also favor the Sweetfire Chicken Breast, Eggplant Tofu, and Beijing Beef.  Now, Panda Express even serves brown rice at no additional charge!  Great for an after gym meal.
 
Nope, not the most authentic Chinese meal but it was good!  Fresh veggies and meats are key!  The mushrooms weren't mushy, the broccoli still had crunch, the meats were hot, and even my Orange Chicken still had texture.  Definitely one of the best Panda Express meals I've had.  I still like how they include the fortune cookie with every meal.  A nice touch, but of course not very typical Chinese.  Yes, I am part Chinese.  

This Panda Express is a bit hidden in the strip mall off of Hualapai and Charleston, but worth the find.  It's much better overall than the Panda Express up the street in the Red Rock Hotel & Casino food court.  Hidden gem for some Chinese-American take-out.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,0,4,ifIR8E1YCP675Q8CuBiNfg
4192064,2012-04-18,0,wShT0KXCW0ZAnNKdJr_1pg,"Panda Express is a great place to eat and a nice alternative to typical ""fast"" food. The entree's here are consistently rated the best healthy alternative to eat from publications such as Men's Health magazine. They use only fresh vegetables cut daily and high quality meats. None of the meals are served with MSG. 

This is a very nice location. The restaurant is kept very clean. The ladies behind the counter are friendly. They move customers quickly and efficiently through the line. 

I have only been to a couple of Panda Expresses in town and by no means an expert but based on what I have seen I think the portions here are very large. I recommend asking for the""to go""plate even if you are eating in. The ""to go"" portion does appear to be a little larger than the ""eating in"" plate.

4414558,2018-04-20,0,wShT0KXCW0ZAnNKdJr_1pg,"I have a medical condition which basically means I cannot eat meat. This is the only Panda Express location I have found in Las Vegas that even offers Eggplant Tofu, and so I stop in often as it's one of the few places I can go. I wish more locations had it (I've never found a location in Orange County or San Diego County that has it either) but that's why I'm not upset. I've never had an issue here until now.

I visited this location on the 17th and it was only just a few minutes after 8:30. I looked it up before I went and saw they closed at 10pm so I knew I had time to dine in. They had another dish in the place of where they usually have the Eggplant Tofu but that was no problem, sometimes they have to make it up for me and that's okay, I never mind waiting. So I let the lady know that I would like that dish and she refused, telling me they won't make it, I could only get what's on the steam table. When I explained that don't mind waiting, she told me they no longer have it, they did away with it. I asked when, she told me few weeks ago (Which could be, I was out of town for spring break). I pointed at that it was still on the magnet on the steam table and on the menu board. ""They haven't removed them yet"". While that's possible, that upset me because there are no other dishes that don't have meat. I would have left if the other members of my party hadn't already ordered.

So I ordered half brown rice and half steam veggies, and went to attempt to make this work. I wanted also get one of the two items as steam veggies as well (since there aren't any other choices for me) but again, she refused to make me any more. I attempted to explain my reasons for asking for just items with veggies but she told me kitchen was closing and they wouldn't make any more food. This was an hour and a half before closing. I get it if I came in at closing but come on. And did she seriously think that what was on the table would last until closing? Of course while dining in, they were still serving food out of the kitchen. At this point, I asked who was the person in charge because of her careless attitude, I didn't want to even have to take it that far but she told me no one was in charge that was on, there was no one I can speak to. Basically, I had to pick two more dishes that I didn't even want and just eat the few veggies that were in it (The rest of my party enjoyed the meat I gave up since it was most of my dishes anyway, and they offered what little veggies they had in theirs but it shouldn't have had to been that way).

This is by far the worst experience I've ever had at a Panda Express and if it is true they did away with the only dish I could actually eat here, I guess there is no point in me coming back anyway. While I understand others do not have the limitations I do, and therefore wouldn't have the issues I did, the service here was still horrible. I'd find another location where they are actually friendly. I normally go during the day shift I guess, and have never had an issue with the staff being so rude. So if you go to this location, I guess earlier in the day is the best time to go. These are just my opinions and mine alone. Take it as you will.

Update; They did reach out to me and offered to pay for my meal, which I believe to be fair. I have also since gone back to this location and found they do in fact still offer the Egg Plant Tofu, which is awesome. I still haven't found another store that offers it and contacting them, they couldn't advise any stores that do offer too but I have one store that still offers it so I cannot complain. Upon returning, I didn't see the employee that was treating us poorly but I hope she just got whatever was going on in her life worked out.

4969657,2012-05-24,0,wShT0KXCW0ZAnNKdJr_1pg,I have eaten at several Panda Express locations in both Nevada and California. This Panda Express has a very limited selection and the food is luke warm at best. They never had tofu or eggplant and the restaurant was cluttered and disorganized. The service was mediocre. High prices too.,DsiHRoTsjd-K1WmlpgoGTw,0,0,2,tkfUkLAj8JcxNKbLlciWjw

5516491,2014-04-18,1,wShT0KXCW0ZAnNKdJr_1pg,"I am not a big fan of Panda Express. The food is too sweet and greasy for quality food, let alone Chinese food, and it's overpriced. Since my family likes it, though, I've been to several around town. This particular store always looks clean and inviting, and the staff are friendly.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,1,2,3,uKZ0QJPx2fYpUE9wXn8RWQ

Food not prepared, lines backed up, trying to close and clean early.  See my photos for the stack of containers waiting for food.  See photo of my horrible looking food.  Do yourself a favor and patronize the Downtown Summerlin location for a better experience.",eHagJ19fXF6cim1QgryeEA,0,0,2,oeLRVNtd1OqqdaDbLlNtIw
