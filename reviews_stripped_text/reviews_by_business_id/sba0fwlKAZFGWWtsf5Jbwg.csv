Nice and thick with good quality chicken, amazing pesto and really flavorful crunchy bread as the outside of the panini. I left feeling perfectly full and satisfied. My husband came out to the car and surprised me with two desserts to eat on the go. Again I was amazed at the quality. The cheesecake was just perfect and the mascarpone did not disappoint either.

This would be a great study place honestly. 

I ordered a breakfast croissant with avocado, bacon, and provolone and a berry smoothie which was made fresh and not overly sweet. They definitely didn't skip out on the avocado and the croissant was huge. It was definitely a filling meal! You get what you pay for.

There weren't a lot of ppl in the cafe on a Sunday afternoon but it's ok. It was nice to have it be so quiet. The decor is shabby chic and I love that it felt so familiar and cozy. Seems like a great locals spot. 

We had cappuccinos and they were amazing and huge and get them when you get there. Trust me... Get them. I want to try all the flavors and the latte. 

I had the Fig and Prosciutto panini, it was okay...it's probably my own fault but I love all those items and forgot that the fig was going to be super incredibly sweet. The bread was amazing. I don't think I'll get this panini again personally, but I do want to go back and try the other ones. Possibly update my review with a panini that's more to my liking. 

Ok the tomato soup is amazing. I love soup and chowders and I loved their tomato soup!! It was warm and creamy, hit the spot on a cold day! 

The Tiramisu was freaking delicious, get it. Even if you just the desert and cappuccino it's worth a go.

The fig and prosciutto panini was over salted and the ""figs"" were I believe, actually orange marmalade. They also added romaine lettuce to the panini which wilted with the heat and adds an off-putting flavor.  Menu states ""baby greens"" not romaine. 

BALT panini was also not edible. Poorest quality bacon available and most likely re-heated  for the sandwich. The sandwich had a watery vinaigrette that just made it worse.

1568045,2014-09-23,0,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"Hm... I don't quite know where to start...

I was in the area for church, and I remembered that this place was nearby.. My friends wanted to go to a juice bar, but I was like hey let's go get some coffee and I've never tried this place. I was a bit excited because whenever I passed by this area, it seemed nice. The outdoor seating had couches and comfortable seats, which you never really see so that's always a plus. They do provide ashtrays for you smokers out there. 
The inside was a bit dark. Not to say that's bad, but just not what I expected. 

Now onto the real review...

I didn't get any food. Their menu was quite large. They actually do have one juice item on the menu if you really don't like coffee and you were kinda forced to come with your friends. They have a variety of food items..So..can you really call them a cafe? I guess so..
I got a shot of espresso because it's on the house if you do a yelp check-in. But I was going to get it anyway of course because the real way to judge a coffee shop is by their espresso beans. It wasn't too dark as far as espresso goes. So as a learning coffee critic, I can't totally judge it, but I did enjoy it. My palette is still growing ;) I also got a latte, which tasted fine. As any latte should. My friend ordered a cappuccino, but it pretty much came as a dry cappuccino (double the foam). 
Doesn't seem like a very experienced barista, but for the most part they get the job done. 

Overall this place is just okay. I was glad there was a non-Starbucks coffee shop in the area. I didn't complain too much or else I would've drove elsewhere. In the end, they got the job done. They did what they were required to do whether it was the bare minimum or not. I wanted coffee and that's what they served. I didn't hate it, but I wasn't WOW'd over it either.

Is it a lunch spot or a coffee place? They are trying to be both, and when I ate lunch here and switched to work mode after that, I felt uncomfortable. The presence of a server alone put me in an awkward position, but when she frequented to my table, sending a signal that I'm no longer welcomed, it was time to leave.

Even though I saw a couple of people seated in a booth and had their laptop open, it didn't feel like a place to get some work done.

It's not the greatest place to have lunch either for the very same reason, it's a bummer considering that their food was decent.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,8,1,2,aXhpHdoWcTASHSMqF-GM1A

1976732,2016-02-15,0,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"First off, for those of you wondering this place does have a view of the strip and it has outdoor seating. I personally like this, as Vegas hasn't seemed to figure out that nice outdoor areas are great for restaurants. 

As for the food. We've tried a few of the paninis and all were very good. Even with the delivery, they aren't soggy or inedible (I live within three miles of the restaurant). The ham and cheese, turkey and cheese, chicken pesto basil, and the sausage paninis are all good choices. I'm not a fan of the side salad that comes with the sandwich, as I prefer lots of veggies w my lettuce. But the soups are pretty good, and make up where the salad lacks. The favorite of my house is definitely the beef and veggie soup. Think pot roast with broth=this soup. This soup is worth the trip. The Greek salad is also a tasty choice (sans dressing- not a fan of their house dressing). I just added my own dressing at home, which is okay. If you place a minimum order with Eat24 they give freebies.  Go with the muffin, which is different every time and always good. It's great for next day snacking. 

Now the service:  I have dined in and had delivery. For my dine in experiences, this place has pretty mediocre table service. I have even seen people walk out after waiting 5-10 minutes without their order being taken. If you're in a hurry, it's better to walk up to the counter and ask someone back there. I think they could benefit from having one extra person on staff to help, and forgo the server making smoothie drinks behind the counter. It might be more than this, but in the few times I was there that was the biggest hold up. The poor dine in service is the reason for -1 star. 
As mentioned, I have also ordered via Eat24 for delivery. The delivery service is much better than the dine in (weird...I know). They are on time, the food is edible, and they read the notes. One time they forgot a sandwich in the order & handled it perfectly. The delivery driver immediately (without complaint) called the restaurant, had the kitchen make the sandwich asap, picked it up, and brought it to the house without delay. They also do a great job with packing the to go order, using cellophane to protect the soups and balsamic-horseradish sauce (which is great by the way) to prevent liquid spillage.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,2,1,4,AUVYEYgwRGKOgTvmRTOM7w

Second try was the Tracian Clay Pot (eggs, feta, tomato, olives and some provolone cheese). It came out quickly and tasted very good. It's not oily and it was nice to try an authentic Bulgarian recipe.

Everything was fresh, flavorful and just damn good.   The tomato soup is honestly the best I have had EVER.  The wife raved about the sandwich and loved the beef & veggie soup.  The waitress brought out a balsamic & horseradish sauce to put in the beef soup, something I'd never heard of.  It was great - added a nice zing to an already great flavor.  

I'm not a coffee drinker but they menu had dozens of interesting sounding coffee drinks and the place smelled incredible.  I was tempted to try a smoothie but after lunch I was completely stuffed.

It's also pretty cluttered inside. I can see how if you want a coffee on the patio it may be a good spot to go. I'm pretty disappointed.,q3OfsFHCJq3pAe-oAdBAgQ,6,0,2,0DO1ADilvKQNuSAZcW769A

2798880,2014-10-19,0,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"A locally owned place on Rainbow and Desert Inn, Strip View Cafe does offer a view of the Strip in the distance (if you squint really hard) and some good eats. The interior is beautifully decorated with a rustic, yet trendy, motif. The staff, particularly the owner, was very friendly while describing dishes on the menu, many of which are made from scratch. Sandwiches are large with prices to match. The chicken pesto panini ($10.95) was excellent with its house made pesto, plentiful white meat chicken topped with melted provolone, tomatoes, basil and EVOO. It came with a side of not-so-creamy potato soup. Even more expensive was the fig and prosciutto panini ($13.95). It was good for a few bites but the cloyingly sweet fig spread was too much half way into the sandwich. The lamb curry pie ($5), made in-house, had a pronounced gaminess to it that benefitted from a curry sauce that added some much needed depth. Saving the best for last, the mascarpone cake ($5) was a tantalizingly sweet dessert comprised of multiple layers alternating between creamy and rich mascarpone and chocolate.

I have been here multiple times and have loved every time.  Have been for gatherings and for personal taste fulfillment.  I have had the Caprese Panini, Grilled Cheese Panini, Chicken Pesto Panini, Proscuito Di Parma Panini, Spinach & feta Panini.  All have had great amounts of meat, cheese and seasoning, the option of the soup or salad I recommend the house soup any time of the year.  My favorite soups are Tomato Basil Soup, a warm reminder of my grandmothers, it really melts in my mouth I can dip almost any sandwich in it anytime of the year it is soooo good and in the summer I love the cold cucumber soup this one I don't dip but I love it!  Every sandwich gives me 2 meals with the soup it is so hardy and filling.

I love the decor in this restaurant it is inviting and warm modern and rustic kind of the perfect blend to have a meeting with a friend for a lunch or a quick after work snack work meeting also a great place for me and my girlfriends to meet for a snack pre drinks.  I live around the corner so I take out often but I have meet up with a girl friend to eat then wine after! :)

The exact same thing happened with the waitstaff again. I had to wave my menu in the air and say ""hellooooo"" before anyone even noticed I was there.

We walked up and their patio was shut down with tarps covering the furniture.  There were 3 tables awkwardly placed on the side walk that I assumed was their patio dining area. The weather was too nice to be inside and we had one of our pups with us so we dined there.
We were greeted by a friendly server that offered to serve food to our dog. She placed menus on the table and returned inside. The menu selection was a variety of paninis, soups, salads, and cold sandwiches.  I ordered the prosciutto and fig panini with the house salad and my boyfriend ordered the chicken pesto panini with a side of their potato soup. My panini was ok. I felt it was extremely salty and lacking fig! The salad was basically a spring mix with cucumbers and drizzled pesto as a dressing. The potato soup was probably the best tasting item we ordered.
As we were finishing our meal a few guests sat outside to dine as well. The minute they sat down they all lit up a cigarette and completely ruined the end of our meal. I eventually went inside to ask for our check and paid the bill so I wouldn't have to smell the smoke anymore.
I was extremely disappointed and won't be back. I love when restaurants offer outside dining but it's impossible to enjoy the nice clean air when your neighboring table is filling it with second hand smoke.",1he_r7kQnK5MXOYqXD-Gkg,3,1,3,cFEKXRxn7Z5UZEyFY7SMHw

Clearing out old bookmarks on my phone I and happen to come across the Strip View Café. First off, ""strip view"" is a stretch. I mean you only see the top of the Strip skyline and that's if you're standing up. No view, no problem because the food here is pretty amazing. 

I ordered the Fig And Prosciutto Panini. This tasty amalgamation has prosciutto on Ciabatta bread with melted mozzarella, fig jam, and baby greens. Plus I added bacon. Because - bacon. I also ordered the Caprese Salad layered with tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil. Tossed in extra virgin olive oil.

Wow they killed on this sandwich! The prosciutto wasn't too fatty and sliced super thin for easy sandwich eating. The bread was soft, but crispy on the outside and the bacon and fig jam should just get married, because I love them together! A must try at The Strip Cafe. 

What about the Caprese Salad you say? It was fresh-a-licious. I'm not a huge tomato fan, but these were thick, fresh, and had that tomato sweetness that really put this appetizer dish over the top. 

The service was a little shaky and our food did take a little longer than I thought it should, but it did start to rain and people were shuffling inside. This could have confused the servers.

Atmosphere:
Kind of an odd location for a cafe. It's on the corner of a busy street, I have a feeling that's the reason for low customer traffic. The inside is quaint but a little dark so we sat outside on the patio since it was a nice day. It doesn't dissapoint on the strip view like the name but you do have to be sitting in the right area on the patio to see it clearly. 

Food:
The lunch menu had a lot of options for sandwiches, paninis, soups, and salads. My group ordered 3 paninis, 2 soups, and a salad. All were great, most outstanding was the cold cucumber soup. Portion sizes were just enough that we didn't need any boxes but also didn't leave hungry.

Service:
Soups and salads were served shortly after ordering, nice when you're hungry. Panini's came right around when we were finishing our first course. Server was nice but not very personable. We had to go get her when we were ready for our bill.

3813328,2016-10-13,6,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"Despite a long and slow day at work, I had an awesome family dinner at Viet Noodle Bar on Spring Mountain Rd. However after dinner some of us wanted some dessert and coffee. So my sister and I decided to open up our Yelp app and Strip View Cafe came up since we were in the vicinty. Then I noticed that I had this placed bookmarked for quite some time, just forgot about it. 

When we arrived, I was surprised with the setup of the shop which contain tons of quirky and cozy items that had an inviting atmosphere and cool pictures throughout the walls. The outdoor patio was pleasant and had a good amount of comfortable chairs. Awesome place to relax with a group of friends or family.

Upon placing our order, my sister and I decided to stay and enjoy the items we ordered. We had the privilege of being served by Jezebel. Who we initially taught was the owner because she was multi-tasking from the front counter, kitchen, lobby & outdoor patio. We were greeted upon sitting and told us that she will assist us. She approach us in a pleasant manner and ask us what kind of drinks we like. My sister got a Dirty Chai Latte and for myself, the Vanilla Honey Latte. We also got the mini Cheesecake.

Now onto the items that we got. From the first sip of my Vanilla Honey Latte...Oh Honey it was delicious!! The honey was paired well with the vanilla taste of the latte, consistent and balanced of sweetness and coffee taste. I was able to taste my sisters' Dirty Chai Latte, and that was good too! Our mini cheesecake was on point with texture and flavor, despite being biased with cheesecake. We didn't get a chance to try anything else because we had dinner prior to stopping by this place. I gotta come back and try out their lunch items too.

Overall we had a cool experience here and a great conversation with Jezebel and how Yelp lead us to this café at an undescriptive plaza on Rainbow Blvd. near the intersection of Desert Inn Rd. Throughout our conversation with Jezebel, another customer walk in and over heard us spoke about Yelp and came up to us and wanted to know more about Yelp. I got the chance to promote Yelp and explained to him how it works. His named is Edgar, so if your reading this review Edgar. I look forward to reading your future reviews my friend. 

Throughout the last 30 minutes prior to closing, the four of us had a great time reminising and acting like a group of high school friends catching up. This is gonna sound cheesy, but it kinda felt like a scene from Friends, whenever they gather at Central Perk.

3839343,2015-06-22,8,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"I went to visit the Strip View Café with my cousin for a Sunday brunch.  Although the name suggests a ""strip view,"" it is a big stretch. I guess if you look closely past the trees, you can see the tops of the hotels. Anyway, the interior of the establishment is very cool-looking with mason jars being hung from the ceiling, stone with granite tops for the counter area, and glass table tops where local businesses have their business cards under for everyone to see. This place definitely gives off a calming vibe.

As for the food, I was highly pleased with it. All of their menu items sounded so good, I actually had a hard time choosing what I wanted to order. 
I ended up having the tuna melt and the vanilla cappuccino (use your check-in offer if you're craving extra caffeine). The tuna melt was a perfect blend of rich flavors from the albacore tuna and the cheesy provolone goodness. The bread it was served in was soft on the inside, and had a delectable crunch on the outside. 
They gave me the option of a salad or soup, and since it has been over 100 degrees lately, I opted for the salad. I've never really enjoyed a salad prepared by someone else until I had their pesto-dressed salad. Initially, I thought they were going to serve us a small little side-salad, but it turned out to be a whole plateful of it. It is still an excellent size for a semi-light brunch. The pesto dressing was drizzled on the salad, and not drenched in it. The veggies and greens in the salad were all fresh and flavorful (you can really tell by the color and the way it tastes). The tomatoes were succulent and sweet, and complimented the pesto and onions well. The vanilla cappuccino did not have an overpowering taste to it, and was made perfectly.

There is outdoor seating in the patio area, which looks just as clean as the inside. I would definitely recommend the Strip View Café for someone looking for a place to have a nice brunch/lunch. Free wi-fi is also available.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,14,9,5,mHhwrG8j0TiNwIcCzPJPNA

I LOVE this place!  It's off of the beaten path and unassumingly delicious! When you step into the restaurant, you'll appreciate the quaintness of the decor.  It could be someone's home.  It's clean and comfortable. 

You have a choice of walking up to the register and just ordering a java and/or food item, but they also have table service as well.  

I love the menu.  It's just enough selection and everything that I've ever had has been fresh, great tasting & a great price too!  My faves include:  The Chicken Noodle Soup (i've honestly never had anything better than this), Watermelon salad w/avocado (dressing on the side), turkey/provolone panini.  Their coffee/lattes/cappuccinos are as equally wonderful as well! 

Not only is the food awesome, but the staff is always on top of it!  What more can you ask for?  Fantastic food, tentative service and a great value!  OH.. and they also redid their patio too, so dogs welcome!  Now, that just seals the deal!",bIUX-QVjnO1LOwzf8TDbNw,1,0,5,0sjCvf2ZWci9sFAzFXZZpA

I went inside first and while waiting to give my order, I heard some people say to the server that they'd be on the patio.  I asked her if I just go there and take a seat and she said yes. 

I went outside and I had my pick of several tables.  The good sized patio area was well covered by umbrellas so the sun was not a problem.  There is a small view of the Strip.  You can see the tops of the taller hotels over the detention basin across Rainbow Boulevard.

In a brief time, the server came out and took my order.  Since I had looked at the menu while waiting inside, I was ready to order.  I started out with lentil soup and followed this up with their chicken pesto panini.  I also got a caramel cappuccino. 

The soup was very good.  Hearty amounts of small chopped vegetables and lentils.  The panini was very good.  The menu describes it as: Grilled chicken with melted provolone, ripe tomatoes, crispy bacon and spinach--drizzled with pesto spread.  That's a good description.

Service was very good.  My server was also a very pleasant woman.  The only thing about which they have no control over is the noise from Rainbow Boulevard.  Being a major street and with a number of trucks, it was quite loud at times.

Also, our young waitress mixed up our order which she apologized for. Poor thing looked so upset. The older woman who seemed to be the owner or manager would not stop yelling at her after this mistake. She got in her face and was extremely rude to the poor girl right in front of the customers. This is unprofessional and simply inappropriate. I felt sorry for the young lady. When the sandwiches did come out the woman who appeared to be the cook set them down and was about to take away my hardly eaten soup without saying a word. I was of course waiting for my sandwich to eat with the soup so I asked her to please leave the soup. She put it down and rudely threw her hand up as if to say ""well excuuuuse me"" haha. I couldn't believe it. The whole experience just kept getting worse.

With that inappropriate atmosphere and those ridiculous prices they'll go out of business just like the people who occupied that strange location before them. Never going back again.

The chicken club was very cheesy with tomatoes onions and lettuce. It's a bit messy but delicious. 

The creamy potato soup is not as creamy as I imagined. I was expecting it to be like a baked potato soup but that was my own fault for expecting it. 

For a drink I ordered a medium hazelnut frappacino and it is really good but my only problem is that the woman who made it put it in a larger cup and it made it look like I didn't get the right amount. I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt because I asked her if this was the correct size and she said she accidentally put my medium drink in a large cup...

One of very few places off the Strip that has achieved this level of quality. Even many big casinos that offer casual dining are not nearly as good as this place.

The only downside are the prices. For a small cafe that's way away from the Strip, and a very casual eatery they charge almost regular restaurant prices. Even a basic meal with a beverage plus tips will run over $30-35/person and much more if you're in the mood for a coffee and a dessert. Too bad, since I really like this place and would visit more often if their prices were a little lower.

Also worth noting - they're located on one of the busiest streets in Vegas. Outdoor seating is available and comfy, but the amount of traffic is not fun.",-g-x5DiRxV0rXCyFkfhU3A,0,0,4,Oi5lZQybPE650aAoOVmQuA

The food was pretty good. I did have a taste of the tomato soup since it had a lot of good reviews. It was just ok for me - tasted too much like tomato sauce to me. Maybe not enough herbs or cream? I got the caprese salad, which was good, but had just a tad too much salt on top for my liking. My friend had the spinach salad with some added meat and really enjoyed it.

As foodies my wife and I are always looking for the hidden gems here in town and after reading the reviews we were very excited to dine since we love cafes. Upon walking in my wife and son went to use the restroom when the server hustle her way past them shoving herself in the restroom first, leaving our five year old to do the potty dance while she took her sweet time. 

The menu looked fantastic and we debated over many of the delicious items on the menu. The server quickly took our order. The food arrived roughly 20 minutes after ordering. 

We ordered the three cheese panini with bacon. This item came out without the bacon on it. Due to the inexperience in the service industry, when we informed the server she looked as as if we had three heads and said, ""You didn't say bacon!"" She sent the sandwich back to the kitchen. Rather than heating a new sandwich so the cheese was properly melted. The chef simply slapped a couple of pieces of bacon on the panini and sent the sandwich out cold with unmelted cheese. Thus, no longer being considered a penni. 

The watermelon salad was indeed not a watermelon salad but rather a tomato salad with some chunks of watermelon in it (80/20 ratio at best). The salad would have been amazing and to be fair the server did take off the bill but server never stopped by the table to ask how our meal was until we had completely finished and she came to clear.

4820343,2016-08-12,1,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,This review is purely about the quality of food not the service. The first time I order prosciutto from there was two months ago and it was amazing. Since then I feel like I ordered proscitto and they got it from the grocery store. If you want thick dense chewy pancakes then order the crapes. I have absolutely no idea how they think what they serve are crapes. Other items are terrible but I'm not going to waste anymore of my time with this review,8noufd1fU2j_jW3gUmp0Zw,0,0,1,0oPWCZwuoiE25caqCgvDdQ
4846767,2017-05-12,0,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,I love that I have found several great places in Las Vegas to eat that are not chain restaurants. Strip Cafe is another one. My salad was probably the best I have have here in Las Vegas since I have been in town. Cucumbers were fresh and flavorful. Great food great owner and staff. If you have a business meeting or just a casual day this is a great spot for a bite to eat! Oh yes and a view of the strip of course  absolutely a 5 star cafe,1afPtEJkkXDrdXSr7ftf-g,1,0,5,lGX9ilAWWuMdotEP0PElDQ
4870270,2014-10-05,2,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"I am so glad I gave this place another chance. The restaurant contacted me after my previous review very apologetic that I'd had a bad experience, and wanted to make it right. They are all so nice, they genuinely want you to feel welcome and happy at their restaurant.

This time I ate in with my husband for a late Saturday lunch; and I will definitely be back. The restaurant and especially the patio are wonderfully casual. The kind of place I could see coming back to often for coffee and a treat when I want to enjoy the beautiful months of Vegas weather. 

The coffee is great; perfect foam, unburnt shots. I worked in a coffeeshop for most of college, so I get sad when coffee is bad; this coffee was pretty much perfect.

I had the Snejanka; holy cow, you could see and taste the love that went into this dish. I had never had anything even close to this salad before, so it was a really fresh, exciting meal. It was also crazy rich and quite filling. I want to try the other bulgarian specialties there, and the watermelon salad! And the soups! The cold cucumber sounds so perfect for a hot vegas day. They do really great plays on tangy and creamy and crunchy. And the deserts. I'm not eating sugar right now, but oh man I want to try those deserts. 

My husband had iced tea (I am specifically abjured to remark that the tea was way better than expected for ""just iced tea"".) and the strawberry avocado salad with bacon. The house vinaigrette was tangy and wonderful, and the avocado and strawberries perfectly ripe. He is usually grumpy and gets unripe hard avocados when we eat out, these were at their perfect peak. He got a few bits of spinach that might have been just about to go off, but overall, both of our meals were fabulous.

I will definitely be back, probably fairly often. I've been looking for a cozy place with a patio where I can bring my sketchbook and snack on a saturday afternoon when I can't get work done at home, and a great place to take my mom for a relaxed lunch when she visits from Minnesota. She always wants someplace to eat outside, and there are so few great local places I can take her. She'd love this place. Thanks for inviting me back, Strip View! I'm SO glad I took you up on it!

I was really excited about the pesto and chicken Panini which had received many many great reviews. however when I received it I was very disappointed because they had forgotten to put bacon and cheese on it so I got some small pieces of chicken pesto a lot of spinach and a slice of tomato that was in the Panini. The Panini was cold but I had it delivered and their store is about a 10 minute drive from my house so that was probably my fault. I was very disappointed with the two desserts my friends and I picked. I love flan and I got the caramel flan style dessert it had no flavor, except for the burnt bottom and the fruity mini cheesecake was simply a small round piece of cheesecake with whipped cream and I believe some white chocolate drizzled on top so we didn't know why they had called it a fruity cheesecake she expected to have some fruits or something either on it or in it. The Caprese salad looked amazing in the photos online and it was to me just a basic standard caprses salad the one great thing though was they had an offer where the first time you order from them they give you a free house green salad and I'm a salad person! I love salad I don't know how much just a regular salad costs but the free salad they sent me yesterday is what I'm having today for lunch and dinner it's very large and their house dressing which appears to be kind like a chimichurri vinaigrette, was amazing! I don't see myself ordering from them in the future. The total cost was $60 for the order and it just wasn't worth it. Once again I work in food and beverage, I  did place a to go order 20 minutes before close, but they forgot bacon and cheese on a simple panini, and I ordered all of their most popular items.",Kp7aAuDOerBmIo3zgvWQTQ,2,0,2,pquLFaniXlQwoFavg2FmeA

5227762,2015-05-04,8,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"The last few months, I've been leading a book club, and we've been meeting at different spots around town.

For this month, we decided to meet at Strip View Cafe.  I've driven past this place a million times, and have had it bookmarked for ages, I just never seem to remember it until we're headed someplace else and pass it. 

On Saturday afternoon, around 1pm, we came in, and the place was pretty empty.  
I ordered the honey vanilla latte right away, and told the server I was going to wait for the rest of the party.

The honey vanilla latte was $4, and the small was the size of a medium at Starbucks...and it tasted amazing.  I'd come back for this alone!  Excellent start to the visit.  

When we ordered, I went with the prosciutto di parma panini, and asked the server's opinion on a soup.  She recommended the lentil, so I went with that. 

I LOVE me a good lentil soup, and this was divine.  The lentils were the perfect texture: not mushy, but not hard and crunchy.  The broth was flavorful, and there were chunks of onion floating around...really great! 

The panini was huge.  In fact, I asked for a box right away and put half away (so I wouldn't overeat, and so my fiance could try it.)...I almost took it back out again and ate it on my own. 
Packed with tasty, salty prosciutto, basil, Parmesan cheese on perfectly toasted bread, this sandwich was heaven.  I even ate the tomato, and I'm not usually a fan of tomatoes.  

Service was extremely polite.  A little slow at one point, but that was because we told them we were waiting for someone who wasn't able to make it.  It took a moment to catch their attention, because they were helping others, but it really didn't take away from the experience at all.  

The place is clean, and I love the set up. 

Now that I've been here, I have every intention of coming back again.  

Great job, Strip View Cafe!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,10,8,5,mLSfgvQSwF2UA1dhPw0_cQ
5237488,2016-05-29,1,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,I had been wanting to stop by here for awhile and finally did. We walked in and was greeted right away and directed to sit wherever we wanted. In looking around the deco is a little confusing and too much. The pictures don't all tie into each other and the glass table tops have business's cards and misc stuff crammed underneath. The waitress brought us menus right away and got our drink orders.  The prices are a little high but after tasting the food I can tell they use fresh ingredients which I am more than ok paying for. Two of the sandwiches did not come out and we had to ask for them. The waitress went back to the kitchen and we could hear her speaking to the cook which should have been kept a little more hushed and private. When she brought them out they were cold. They did comp the sandwiches without us asking and offered free desert so they did what they were suppose to do to make up for the mistake. This would have been five stars if the food had not been cold. I had a veggie omelet and it was honesty the best omelet I have ever had. I didn't understand it being served with a salad though. After we ate I visited the bathroom and again confusing decorations. The man that was in before me I think worked there because after coming out he stood leaned up against the end of the counter going into the kitchen. IF he did work there he left the toilet seat up and it was gross underneath. All in all the place was good and I might go back because of the food and they did comp for the mistake.,EoHdx-byYkY0X3low3-Rgg,0,0,4,yFpr77LC4f4kEu_iMSTxjA

I am addicted to the meatball sub, but if I'm feeling like something light their salad is delicious and made with homemade pesto dressing that is awesome. Every soup is made from scratch and so tasty. We've tried dozens of menu items and they are always consistently delicious.",XwvnqHsWlDJ5T0fzf-eLBw,1,0,5,W7GkPjtZp2-HMztl6Vd6Dg

Human food was good also.. we came about 20 minutes after opening and I'm not too sure they were ready for us. They came and cleaned our table and took our order relatively quick. Staff was friendly and I imagine it was the owner that brought our bill.. she was awesome! Very friendly and loved our pup :) 4 stars for luke warm soup and forgetting my lemons :/,Ky46Bt6dNR-Q886nXNVksQ,0,0,4,9FV2Ov1s1sA5K-ddTsfVdA
5776430,2016-01-22,1,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"I love the interior decor.  I ordered a panini to go.  Upon inspection of the panini, I discovered an issue so I contacted them.  The woman in charge apologized and offered to have her cook remake it and have her driver deliver it to my work (I don't think I am in their designated delivery zone).  Not too long after, a new panini was delivered and a piece of tiramisu was also in the bag...nice touch!  The panini was mostly good except the bacon was not crisp and the fatty part was hard to chew...personally, I prefer bacon to be crispy!  All said, I will attempt another visit in the future as I think it has potential.  At least the woman in charge cared about me enough as a customer to correct the issue.",gIcpEY34kKVvbHlQJcooQA,2,0,4,UHrBFzyclifPJ-_1djULwg

Pros:
1.  Large patio that is dog friendly!   :)
2.  Very extensive lunch menu.
3.  Very good omelets (about the only thing they had for breakfast)

Cons:
1.  VERY limited breakfast menu.
2.  For the only two customers in the place, service could have been a little bit better.
3.  I know it's probably a very European thing to have salad with every meal (even breakfast), but I'm not a salad person at all.  The option to have fruit (fresh or frozen) would have been appreciated and not that much effort. 
4.  I'm lactose intolerant and heavily suspect there was dairy in the omelet  ... feeling the pain the next day.

If Yelp had a half-star, I would probably give this place a 2.5 stars.",Hlmr1pEVgPGg86ZOw-T0Dw,3,0,2,uU5MMuszgvSxjy67Fjnqlg
5827653,2014-03-29,6,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"A neighborhood, hand-crafted, independent cafe. High quality, healthy menu. Fiercely motivated and fiercely motivational! Moderate price.

This is a great place for breakfast or lunch or late night (advertising 6am-midnight hours). Great for kids, with a ton of healthy, kid-friendly selections like fresh squeezed Orange Juice. Tip; you can watch them squeeze the juice right in front of you if you sit at the bar.  Outdoor seating means dog-friendly.

A wide selection of lunch-y, snack-y stuff like soup and sandwich/soup and salad combos make this a great place to meet and greet. Situated on the border of Spring Valley neighborhood and Westside neighborhood at the corner of Desert Inn and Rainbow on the NORTHWEST side of the intersection, this venue is minutes from the strip. Driving from Las Vegas Boulevard, take Sahara west (up) to Rainbow,  turn left (south) on Rainbow. The cafe is on your right with private, off-street parking.

The coffee drinks are just too numerous to describe in one review, but everything you can imagine is on the menu.",bP1-iaqAuy4tEoviQaxJrA,15,11,5,_zqLt_tB-X70thgRVZ0D3g

As soon as I stepped in and I was surprised to see the restaurant was very  vintage looking. We fell in love with it right away. The service was just a plus. She offered items that we didn't know that could be added to what we ordered. I ordered the chicken pesto panini with a chicken noodle soup! Amazing!!! My wife ordered the Italian sausage melt with a beef and veggie soup and it was just as good. I can't wait till I come again!!!,R4WML3jYPkOZXctaD39jGQ,1,0,5,DUx977sSzb0T6pqqJipHrg
5866611,2014-04-20,0,sba0fwlKAZFGWWtsf5Jbwg,"Ok.  I hate giving this review.  In fact, I've debated back and forth for days about posting it.  I love yelp though and it's my main tool for finding new places to try out, so I have to keep it real.

This location is super close to work so I was excited when the business opened about 3 weeks ago.  I tried it this week for lunch with mixed feedback.  I will give the cafe a second chance, because the food was decent.  The dining experience is what throw the overall experience off.  We sat outside on a nice patio, but if you aren't a smoker beware...it's gross eating next to a table, or 3 full of smokers.  

Let me say that the young waitress was FANTASTIC!  She was super nice and energetic!  The problem was is she was the only wait person for the whole place during service.  I could not believe it.  I'm not sure how any business person could support not hiring more wait staff.  The poor waitress was running around too much.  She made errors, not because she was not dedicated, but because she was overwhelmed.  I give her credit though...she was so positive and smiled the whole time.

So back to the food.  We had the BALT panini with potato soup and a turkey panini.  I had the peach smoothie as well.  I had asked for white bread instead of the ciabatta bread, which came out wrong from the kitchen.  We had to go back inside about the bread and got to witness the owner being short with the cook about the mistake.  She actually asked us if we told the waitress we wanted a different bread...ah yeah we did and she even read it back to us on her iPhone.

The smoothie was very thick and sorta bland.  I wouldn't recommend it.  The potato soup had a very herby taste to it.  It was good, but not what I expected.  It was more brothy, than creamy.  The BALT had 2 small pieces of bacon and a sliver of avocado.  I felt like for the price it should have been more.

The food was decent, not exceptional.  I would return because of its convenient location.  I hope as they get busier, the owner sees the value in additional wait staff.  I would worry about losing the one that's there.  And know...I don't know her, just felt bad for how hard she was working, but not able to keep up with the service needs.",9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg,7,1,3,MKRQ1-9qUnmtmu_abaqqDg
