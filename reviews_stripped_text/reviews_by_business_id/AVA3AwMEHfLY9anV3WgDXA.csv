136114,2017-12-24,0,AVA3AwMEHfLY9anV3WgDXA,"I have been disappointed yet again by this location. I was probably the last customer of the night, ordering through the drive thru at 1040 PM, which is plenty of time for a fast food restaurant that closes at 11 to serve guests. The crew member tells me they are out of crunchy chicken tacos, which I am totally okay with, except for the fact this seemingly always happens later in the night. I order a double chicken bowl, as that would be my next choice. I return home (i live one block away) to discover my food is ice cold, working in food service, I'm sure they took their station apart early in hopes of getting to leave on 11 at the dot. I call the location at 11:05, knowing there is still crew there. First attempt to call, the phone rings and rings and rings, no answer. Second attempt, someone answers, I begin to speak, and am hung up on seconds later. I will return tomorrow morning to speak to the management, this is ludicrous and a terrible example of customer service. I patronize this restaurant frequently, but maybe I can look to spend my money elsewhere as I was totally disregarded as a guest.

522021,2016-01-14,0,AVA3AwMEHfLY9anV3WgDXA,"The bad reviews are piling up now.  I went in and was stuck waiting to get salsa by a woman who appeared to be a relative or friend of the cashier.  She had 16 salsa cups (I counted as I waited) and was going for more when I finally asked could I get just one.  Lady got rude saying I need more and I snapped back no need to be selfish and she yelled to the cashier and told her I was threatening her.  Cashier told me to leave in a raised voice.  I said give me a refund and I would be glad to as I didn't have my food yet.  She refused saying I was causing trouble and kept telling me she would call the police. After a few minutes sitting and waiting the customer's husband came in and made a verbal threat which people at a table next to us heard. Not wanting to escalate this anymore I left and just resolved to challenge the charge on my card and send a scathing email to corporate telling them they have a hostile environment for customers.  

Local area manager called me two days later and claimed he reviewed video and said my actions were threatening based on the face the customer made.  He further claimed the husband was calm and shook my hand which is an outrageous lie, the guy told me he was so angry he didn't know what would happen to me when I walked outside.  All from what his lying wife told him.  

I told the manager once I get my money back I promise never to set foot again in your property.  The manager then in a vicious tone called me a trouble maker and said they would legally make sure I didn't get a charge back and said if I did this again I would be arrested. I mockingly asked him did they own the police and he responded with we have the footage now,  I can call them and they will investigate and I don't like your chances if that happens. I mean really bizarre,  almost felt like I must have upset El Pollo Loco royalty.   I finally gave up and said good luck keeping customers and hung up on him.   He called back twice and I didn't pick it up.  I really wanted to get some good evidence on voice mail but unfortunately he didn't bite. 

Great customer service eh?  If you aren't a family member of an employee I suggest you stay out of their stores. Too bad really I have been a customer of theirs for 30 years back to their days in East LA and really do like the food.",eFHdHuRQlDVh2TM8ySxiRA,2,0,1,VK7KyxqqTf3cTTorUmkRKg

888395,2015-09-25,0,AVA3AwMEHfLY9anV3WgDXA,"The BF, daughter and I ate here this evening around 7:30PM.  What a mistake!  

Here's the Cliff's Notes version:  Absolute worst employees and service.  Loud, obnoxious, vibrating buzzers they refuse to turn off so they let them go off on top of the countertop all night so the whole restaurant has to hear it.  Food wrong, and absolutely disgusting.  

Details:  When we first entered, there were 2 small families in front of us.  The cashier looked either very much on drugs, or like she would have rather been in the depths of hell, rather than at work.  She was very rude and not helpful toward what the first (senior) couple.  They were asking a lot of questions, as they couldn't see the menu.  She was very snappy at them and had to ask someone else for almost all of their answers.  She took a ridiculously long time ringing them up.  Next family: mom, dad, kid (I'm assuming).  We had already been standing in line for over 5 minutes waiting for her to ring up the first couple, and this family took her about 3 or 4 minutes.  

I already researched the online menu of what my daughter and I wanted because I'm a vegetarian and she's indecisive, so I was ready to go!  As the people in front of us walk away, i look at her as I'm moving up and she doesn't say ""hi"", ""can I help you"", ""kiss my ass"", or anything.  Doesn't even smile, just stares at me..  So, I just start ordering and tell her I want the kid's meal with 2 chicken legs.  She asks me what side.  I tell her flour tortillas.  She then says, ""you need to pick one of these"", and points to a sign of the side options on the counter.  I tell her mashed potatoes.  Then she asks do i want chips or tortillas.. Wth, I seriously just freaking told her!  Then she even asks again if i want flour or corn! By this point, I'm sure its the drugs..  I order the Grande Avocado Bowl, she rings something in, and then I tell her that I want shrimp on the side (I'm a vegetarian, so it goes to the BF).  She says ""oh, you want shrimp?"" (it comes with a choice of shrimp or chicken, and she automatically rang me up for chicken) So, I'm like ""oh dear Lord, here we go with having to wait another 5 minutes just for her to fix her mistake"".  I emphasize AGAIN for the shrimp on the side, since she was having trouble even forming sentences. BF orders a large cup of chicken tortilla soup.  Painful ordering experience..

While you're waiting for your order, they give a buzzer.  Well, when they call your order, they don't bother turning them off, they just let them sit on the counter top, vibrating wildly, extremely loud, for at least a minute, PER ORDER!  This happened throughout our entire meal.  Extremely annoying.

Food comes up a short while later and the BF's soup is in a small bowl when he ordered large, and she (different lady) says ""are you sure??"".  Wow!!  So she walks over to the chick that rang us up and asked her, instead of just giving him a larger bowl!!  She comes back and says ""my bad, it was my mistake"".  (Screening process for employees must not be too extensive here...) My food was totally wrong, it was extremely sloppily put together and it had chicken ON IT.  I tell her it was shrimp instead of chicken and on the side, and I thought her head was gonna start spinning around; I had definitely confused her to the point of no return.. So I wait about 5 minutes and she gives me my order which strikingly resembles slop you would give a pig from a bucket.  It tasted worse.  80 percent of the entire thing were super-runny pinto beans, which overshadowed everything else since everything was drenched in the soup.  Bland slop.  I forced down about a quarter of it because I was hungry, but threw the rest away.  BF's soup was fine (but how hard is it to mess up soup??) We've been here a couple times and its not normally this bad, but we will NOT be returning. (At least to this location)",u2kUEnt88S7iumV-3Vdmbg,3,0,1,mnNawgCkfngdAlsxGaN3AQ

The employees have all been friendly and I've never had a problem with customer service.

This restaurant is NOISY.  

The big hispanic dude chopping the chicken is annoying.  The BANG BANG BANG!!! of the cleaver cutting the chicken echos through the whole restaurant and it is loud.  BANG BANG BANG!!! then he turns around, flips a few chicken carcasses over on the fire, then turns back to the chopping block and BANG BANG BANG!!!  I know they need to cut the chicken but damn... why does it have to be so damn loud???

This store plays ""background"" music.  Their music isn't bad.  It could be worse-it could be some obnoxious mariachi crap.  But they always seam to have the music turned up really loud.  

And maybe it is the design of the restaurant... maybe this store has some weird acoustics... but everything in this building echos.  I was here a few nights ago and you could hear the conversations of everyone sitting around you loud and clear as if they were sitting next to you.

This place gives me a headache.

Did I mention the food?

The food has a good flavor but the portion sizes are a joke.  I remember years ago when El Pollo Loco gave you your money's worth.  Not anymore.

We walk in and Sarah is at the register couting her money (we realized later she was starting her shift so she may have been verifying her starting cash til). We walk up to the register and after making complete eye contact with me turns her head and looks at the other employees busily trying to get orders together. We stand right in front of the registers (again Sarah is standing directly in front of me) and SILENCE. No hello, no someone will be right with you, nothing!

Seriously, I know its a fast food place so service is definitely not a priority but if you hate your job that much, get a new one! If my son can tell me ""she looks miserable mom"" then its clear as day that you don't want to be there and you are making others not want to be there either.

So before taxes, the total came to $10.47..so i presented the coupon for the free avocado tostada and was told that i couldn't use it because i didn't order an Avocado tostada???? what?? I told him that my order came to more than $10 and he insisted on telling me that i didn't order an Avocado Tostada so i can't use it... so instead of arguing with him, i ordered a Chicken Tostada $5.89.  As i was waiting for my food, i wanted to get some cilantro and they were out, they were also all out of the Mild Pico de gallo and medium pico de gallo.. the only thing i could get was the avocado salsa so i got 2 cups of it and i couldn't find any lids.. So me and some other customers were looking for lids and asked the shift manager... so he was getting more lids... but instead of him replenishing the salsa bar with more lids, he was counting to hand out how many lids each of us customers needed.
After the shift manager gave me the lids, i simply asked him when can i use the coupon for the Free Avocado Tostada.  He said i had to purchase $10 or more.. i pointed out to him my receipt and he acknowledges that my order came to more than $10.  I told the manager that the person that took my order told me i couldn't use the coupon because i didn't purchase an Avocado Tostada.

The manager gave me a refund $4.00. (not sure how he came up with that figure) but my refund was suppose to be the price of the Chicken Tostada that i paid for plus tax ( $5.89 plus NV sales tax of 8.15% $6.37 )  At this point i was sooo aggravated and got the hell out of there.

I was craving fire grilled chicken and saw their advertisement in the mail. I fooled myself to go eat their food once again! 
I don't think I go back soon.",vvxIVr_OR6sHBzGPG9dRXg,2,2,3,xNv-n5VfxCPs6na22Zt_Yg

This is a brand new El Pollo Loco and as far as fast food Chicken places go this place is great. I was greeted right when I walked through the door and the person taking my order was super friendly. There was no lack of friendly service and you could tell by the full tip bin that lots of other people agree. I love the fact that you can see the grill and prep area. The sound of that meat sizzling makes my mouth water like a Pavlov experiment. The condiment station was clean and so was the dining area.

It could be the cooks or it may just be because its new, but the chicken just tasted better than any of the other El Pollo Locos I have eaten at. I even managed to convert someone who was not into El Pollo Loco food into a fan.

Good food, good service, good prices and a clean restaurant. That's more than enough for me. I'll be back here frequently to see how things progress but based on this first experience I am a very happy camper.",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,2,4,5,Re_NqwttiNvclPB7E1Rr1Q

The portions are generous and you get free chips and salsa with your order. Oh and get this, the have Vitamin Water at the fountain and its the same price as regular soda.

And then I come again at 5pm today and out of chicken. The service is not the friendliest.. People working the drive thru talk with such a tone like they are just miserable....

I looked and stated I have a question waited for a min before response and a man responded ""go ahead"". No personality almost like he was annoyed. I asked a question and got a monotone response from the gentleman. I ordered a combo and a soup also asked for the green salsa. No total was given, before I drove up to the window.  When the guy finally came to the window he asked again ""any salsa?"" I replied yes the green as I stated before. He handed me the food and when I got home I was only given two small, like super small, salsas for a meal that definitely would need more than that. For the price you pay for the portions and service, not worth coming again. I like to be treated will kindness and this place did not deliver. Sorry if they were having a bad night but never ok to not be kind to every customer. Please work on that el pollo loco team.

service sucks. they always forget something! either the salsa, napkins or tortillas! why ask me what salsa i want if you don't even put it in the bag every time! 

my advice: avoid this location, but if you have no other choice, make sure to check your bag to see if you have everything. 

also. why get rid of the shrimp? pl",JLtvsyu348me_101eC760A,2,0,2,-mj6YRkdVillvVF4rcvO6w

But over half the time, I don't return home with everything I purchased.  That's an unacceptable percentage. I don't want to have to remember to bring my receipt the next time, so they can make it up to me. I want what I ordered, at the time I ordered it!!! And never an apology. They need to learn to say sorry when they don't do their job right!

After waiting in the drive thru for 15 minutes for a simple order, I got home last night without churros I had paid for. I wanted something sweet for dessert. I ordered it and paid good money, why doesn't it end up in my bag?! This happens over and over, so there's some breakdown in their system. And often, if I don't ask for my receipt, that's missing too. Then I don't get to add points to the app towards a free meal. Mistake always in their favor. Never extra chicken in my bag!
