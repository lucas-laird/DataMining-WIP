I only tried a few dishes, but they were amazing.  Everything was incredibly fresh and flavorful.  The grilled shrimp tamale was exceptionally delicious.  Now...I'm not big on margaritas...but the margaritas at La Madonna are awesome.  They squeeze the lime fresh for them.  When you walk into the restaurant, there's this amazing warm aroma of brown sugar/cinnamon from the beautiful candles that decorate the restaurant and Templo, the boutique that is also run by the owners of the restaurant.  

I believe they also have free wine tastings from 6-8 pm on Tuesday nights and free tequilla tastings from 6-8 pm on Thursday nights.  You may want to call to make sure.  Check out their happy hour from 3-6 pm on weekdays.  They have a nice outdoor patio...which is perfect in this weather!",KomLUbYR1ApIvPSjCfeOdQ,0,0,5,m4fG2cLVb-yv5G8mbO0RGg

If you are in for red meat, you won't be dissapointed.

The wine list is pretty good for a mexican joint, and the mood is just right.   I hear they are opening a tequlia bar soon with some gaming, so hopefully this will boost business for them.   It's a great little spot.

Great for a first date.",UQm8Cib9mvQpxHE07sAhFA,1,0,4,teN25Zp7O-YqrYtQlnd5ZQ

The calamari was good the cheese appetizer was so so. The salads were very good, especially the chopped blue. My friends had the scallops (special of the day) and it was quite spicy and flavorful, the jumbo shrimp diablo was perfect. I had the bone-in ribeye (of course) and it was just ok. A bit expensive if you ask me, because it was not a prime cut of meat. Service was very good but they charge 20% gratuity for big parties. I think 18% is the industry standard. The sangria and mojitos were great! All in all our experience was quite pleasurable. They ran out of a lot of stuff and their frozen margarita maker was broken :( ...darn! A little bit on the pricey/expensive side for Mexican food.Oh yeah, please be warned. There is only one bathroom.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,0,0,3,PnC_nVqwEP6XY06xklr8Sw

Nice looking place. Kinda surprised at the location - it's basically a high-end mexican restaurant. To be honest, not sure if there are too many high end places in town. I question the location since it's on the outskirts of town. 

Roomie and i started with cocktails - i went with the tangerine mojito. she tried a virgin paloma (a grapefruity drink ) - the mojito was very refreshing ( $9 ) , the paloma ok but damn, $9 for a virgin drink - me no likey that ! server brought a nice warm basket of seasoned tortilla chips with 3 different salsas - they all tasted great ! 

Started with the tuna appetizer ( $12) - basically a tostada with a crema base then sushi grade ahi tuna - very thin, then a light sauce w/ lime - very good ! 

Roomie went with the fish tacos ( talapia - $16 ) i tried the chilean sea bass con cilantro ( $28 ) . Both were very good - the portion for the sea bass a little on the small side. I had a cadillac margarita with the sea bass - very good ! we also got a side of sweet corn tamale. the first few bites were excellent - moist, sweet, flavorful. the remaining tamale was a little on the dry side. 

I like this place. I'm not one to eat mexican food all that often but for sure, if i'm looking for a higher end mexican place, I'm here !",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,5,3,4,PH47B4SAljbkdnWjpnXkGQ
1612205,2008-05-23,0,ONFRwi5zzcqDkFKkbF1Fgg,"My husband and I went to La Madonna with high hopes after scoping out several reviews on line.  The food was terrific, for the most part.  However, the service was sub-par at best, and we were one of two tables in the entire place!  I greatly disappointed.  We asked for glasses of water 3 times before finally receiving them, and that was after chasing down the waiter.  In addition, we ordered the bean dip appetizer, which was supposed to be served with flour tortillas.  What we received was just the bean dip.  Again, after chasing down the waiter and asking for the tortillas, we were told that he would bring us more chips.  We received the chips 10 minutes later when the bean dip was cold.  The best part was that our entrees arrived one minute after that.  There was just no effort at service.

I cannot recommend this place.  Our bill was $85 for two of the cheapest entrees, the bean dip, and 3 margaritas.  I had to keep getting out of my chair to get our waiter's attention.  Save the heartache and go to Viva Mercados.",cs0Y0nio4n0uGEbAisBF6g,0,0,2,PWhw_Y0EsEOrQpWcXHG1fw
2230301,2009-05-22,0,ONFRwi5zzcqDkFKkbF1Fgg,"This is hands down my all time favorite restaurant in Vegas. The food is excellent, try the calamari, you will never want to order it anywhere else again! The service is great. I go there so often the servers know my drink and appetizer order now!
You seriously can't go wrong with this restaurant.
Excellent Happy Hour specials (the best in town with $3 sangria & margaritas & half off appetizers) and great ambiance. If you are looking for a night out with friends, a romantic night with a date or a business dinner or lunch, La Madonna can meet all of your needs.
Oh and I havent tried their new Sunday Brunch yet, but I hear its also out of this world!",w3UMfW-XuIyKkgXEvK8N8g,0,0,5,VDr7_t_MfdWDbE19JfyHmQ
2885109,2009-05-13,0,ONFRwi5zzcqDkFKkbF1Fgg,"Again and again I am dazzled by this strip mall eatery that bills itself as avante garde Mexican. We had 12 women for dinner and the servers handled us with efficiency and smiles. Everyone was delighted with the food, especially the chopped blue salad with gala apples, poblano chiles, roasted corn, blue cheese, chipotle, generous amounts of avocado all enveloped in an agave syrup vinaigrette. Most of us ladies ordered the beef tenderloin chile relleno for our entree, and the plates were pretty well clean when they were taken away. I opted for the pollo rostisado, which was a tamarindo chile glazed chicken. It was perfectly cooked and brilliantly spiced. It was accompanied by a 
melt-in-your-mouth sweet corn tamale. 
Last, but certainly not least, was the flan dessert. Hands down, the creamiest flan I have ever tasted. And the sauce was a rich, caramel that gave it that ""I just have to turn to the person next to me and go OMG"" finish.",tEy3HhLG2EDZc7lRnMJQzg,0,0,4,QnCkvPBxWmPGvbRcGO1Jkg

presentation  - excellent
atmosphere  - excellent
taste  - excellent

I had a great time here. What made me a fan was the the menu was something different,..they had things to choose from that sounded good and where good but that I hadn't had before. Even the standard Hispanic food dishes, had a twist!
I was very impressed with the flavors, Mexican food is hard to do this with because I don't normally taste something and go wow- I wasn't expecting that! *In a good way* I love how surprised I was! 

The tres leche cake was yummy but I prefer chocolate cake otherwise I have nothing but good things to say about this place, I will defiantly go back there again!",bEhO6RG2rgf-jFAv0th0gA,2,1,4,Co7dzj34hQI2SR-OpCjYXQ
