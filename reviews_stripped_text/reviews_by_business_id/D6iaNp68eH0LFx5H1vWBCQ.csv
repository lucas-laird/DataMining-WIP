Before going to the line, I first went to the bathroom. The bathroom was extremely clean and smells super fresh.  I can honestly say that you can eat off the floor.  When I got off the bathroom, the line have gotten longer.  The employees were extremely busy, yet they handled each customers in a professional manners, without loosing their composure.  When it was my turn, the employee greeted me warmly and asked if I wanted fried rice or chow mien.  After choosing fried rice, she then asked me what two entrees I wanted.  I chose Orange Chicken and Walnut Shrimp.  She kindly reminded me that it will extra for the premium entree, and gladly accepted it.  While, one of the employee was scooping my Orange Chicken, she asked me if I wanted some egg rolls or soup.  Though, it was tempting to get them, I felt this was enough for my lunch, so I declined.  Finally, once the entire order was fully gathered by the cashier, she asked me if I would like some condiments like chili sauce or soy sauce, and a drink.  She also kindly asked me if I would like to donate my change (so it rounds up to the nearest dollar), and I happily agreed.

Though, I have mentioned nearly step-by-step of what happened during my visit in Panda Express, it only took me less than 10 minutes from the time I entered the restaurant to the time I left.  This visit only shows how much better the training in Panda Express is.  The food was extremely fresh and flavorful.  The restaurant is spotless.  The employees are efficient and friendly.

My strategy with Panda is to try to hit it in the first hour of opening, if I can. That way the food is always fresh. If you wait till later in the day it seems as though you are really rolling the dice. 

I do like the pepper chicken, orange chicken, and just about any of the shrimp offerings!

This location is kept very clean and has always maintained an appealing appearance.

Service is also a crap shoot. I've gotten some nice and friendly service here at times. On the flip side, I've had some employees become irrationally impatient and rush myself(and witnessed others) through the ordering process, even when it's not busy.

When I ordered my food there wasn't any honey walnut shrimp left and I explained to the the lady working named Sarai that I do not eat meat; only seafood. She offered tofu but I told her that I only waited in line for the honey walnut shrimp. She said sorry we don't have any right now so I rejected the half made bowl containing rice and left! She did not offer to make more food and the entire line had no other options even for someone who does eat meat! Unsatisfied, I called to speak with a store manager!

Since my husband and I are workaholics, we often order food delivery or walk-in to pickup  dinner to-go. Tonight we decided to patron Panda Express on Silverado Ranch and Maryland parkway.

Long story short, the ""so called"" lo mein noodles were the worst we've ever had. The noodles were tasteless, dry and similar to what Top Ramen noodles might resemble if pan-fried, over-cooked and sat under a heat-lamp for who knows how long...yeck!

The orange chicken wasn't much better - tasteless and cold by the time I arrived home [ 2 minute drive].
