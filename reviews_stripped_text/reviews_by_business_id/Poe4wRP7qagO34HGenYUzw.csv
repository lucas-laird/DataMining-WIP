I have come to this location in the ballpark of 40 or 50 times and this last visit was the worst. The girl making my sandwich was sick and sniffling all over the place. Talk about disgusting. Call out would ya. She also didn't say more than 15 words while she made the sandwich. Makes things extremely uncomfortable. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.",MjoqIL3lTigoJA_FM2dMmg,0,0,2,GQVG9YxBbwRF-uctFMYnWw
80340,2015-06-30,5,Poe4wRP7qagO34HGenYUzw,"Dear anyone who gives less than 5 stars,

It's subway. You knew what you were getting when you walked in. The food is the same as any other subway. And of course the workers don't want to be there. It's subway. I go in just to remember how glad I am to not work at subway. Each of those workers is a shining example for me to work harder at my job so that I never have to be as unhappy as they are. I love this subway. 

Oh, it also rocks that it's open 24/7. So in case you are tossing and turing in the middle of the night thinking about quitting your job, you can walk into this subway at literally any time and remember how good you have it at your 9-5. 

Thank you subway workers. You are the best free therapy there is.",PKZMMs0vgD-5a84szJ6DbA,0,0,5,cNQk-kFLvtpmm5iIbnBxbw

Every time I've gone here the bread is clearly from the day before, and apparently was sitting out in the open all night, since its disgustingly hard and dry. This morning i asked for jalapeños on the sandwich, and the lady literally took 4 small jalapeño wheels and spread them out over the footlong. Every time i order my veggie delight, they barely put ANY veggies on it. I have to keep asking for more. I'm like, ""veggies are the POINT of this sandwich"". Slow service. Will be going to a different location from now on.",u2kUEnt88S7iumV-3Vdmbg,1,0,1,ttea4cNHVIEhBaRIFAVFrg

Employee walked in 18 mins late (yes I looked at the clock)

Was charge $10 for a sandwich that should have been $7

Was told 3 cookies for $1 but got charged $1.50

Sadly I'll be back because it's next to work, but I'll be calling a manger.

3257808,2010-09-15,0,Poe4wRP7qagO34HGenYUzw,"Let it be known that not all Subway stores are created equal!

I was sorely disappointed when I stopped in here for lunch last week (Tuesday Evening) for some dinner.

I had my usual Oven Roasted Chicken Foot Long on Wheat with: lettuce, tomato, onion, green bell pepper, cucumbers and sweet onion sauce.  $5 DOLLAR FOOT LONG!

We were the only ones in the store and it took forever for us to get through our order.  It seems like one of the employees were new on the job.  The final straw for me giving two stars was that this location had NO LIGHT LEMONADE!

I'm wish this place would include the lemonade... I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and try this location again - although I'm almost tempted to just drive 2 miles down the road to the one on S. Fort Apache and Sunset.  

I think definitely one of the people behind the sandwich counter was new.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,1,0,2,HcfgRv6zroDs3VKOpcpAAQ

5426615,2013-01-14,1,Poe4wRP7qagO34HGenYUzw,"Holy crap! I have been to various subways and this location is pathetic! On this day we ordered 3 sandwiches: chicken breast, chipotle chicken and a kids turkey. For one thing we had to say the order like 4 x. The 2 ladies couldn't get it right....lol! Then this guy with a mustache was gonna make the chicken breast and not even microwave the chicken!! We had to ask for it to be heated up....that's standard of the chicken. Geez....slow as hell and just a bunch of idiots - I'm sorry but yes the service was that bad!  Like I said I been to a lot of subways and I know it's not expected to have stellar service but at least decent service with people who understand how to take an order. This location is always so disappointing.  Who hires these people?!?!",zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,1,0,1,1KjOI62yMfad-5po1Fp02Q

5546590,2016-08-14,0,Poe4wRP7qagO34HGenYUzw,"Not training their new staff at all. I just got out and I have never had a worse sandwich made before. The new guy was not being watched other than being reminded I needed cheese on my sub before toasting it. My sandwich was cut off center, and it literally fell apart in his hands because he was not shown how to close the sandwich properly. He could not wrap it tightly, and one end was hanging out. When handed to me in the bag, it looked like a messy heap bent  in ""half"" and my sandwich is leaking its innards.

Train your new staff. If I walk in and see the same guy working, I'm either asking a veteran maker to build my sub, or walking out.",FxZ055L3UxlRLsr4XLv03w,0,0,2,_illScivIjbfJB-vL39Vdg

I am just happy there is one close to my house and it honors the 5 dollar foot long deal! I once went to a Subway that offered garlic as a condiment. This one needs to add it to their menu. It makes the Meatball Sandwich so much better.,xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,0,3,QLjNve8CtrHYrkEMARXpZg
