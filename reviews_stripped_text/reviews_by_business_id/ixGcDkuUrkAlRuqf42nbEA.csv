Dependable & consistent. I've been coming here for almost a year and they're great at being quick and courteous. 

They also have an honest wait staff - I accidentally overpaid for an item and the cashier recognized it about 5 minutes later and came to my table to give me the $2 overpayment.",1kHG9W0D0-f1UBkdSNigNQ,2,1,5,NIceiqI_ncNywitJ18vCBg
1687851,2011-10-26,3,ixGcDkuUrkAlRuqf42nbEA,"Holy smokes! Sandwichs with ATTITUDE!

Stopped in on a lunch break and was one of seven people in line.  This amount of people seemed to put the four people behind the counter in a tizzy.

When it came time to top off my favorite, the #5, they ran out of pepperoncinis. The sandwich girl who was already throwing out attitude said that they were all out.  Why do I find this hard to believe?

Something must have been wrong with the bread oven today.  My sandwich ended up looking like smoked turkey, ham and cheddar on a wheat breadstick.

I decided to not make a thing about it and completed the order.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,2,0,2,p-aLHmGt3IlVhG-oUd1lag
1818261,2015-07-01,0,ixGcDkuUrkAlRuqf42nbEA,"This Port of Subs is a quick ride from my job. I work at a family business, so I am often joined for lunch with my father and brother. We all love it!

The staff knows us (and our strange orders) by heart. My dad always gets the same tuna salad, with bizarre specifications -- he hates lettuce, so he gets a bed of onion and tomato instead, plus he prefers a downpour of vinegar to anything resembling dressing. What's so great about the girls at this place is that they take the time to remember the specifics. Yesterday, my dad ordered a meatball sub, which was a compete betrayal of his regular order, and the girl almost had a heart attack.  

I've always preferred Port of Subs to its competitors, like Subway or Quiznos. I love the endless options, and that they slice the meat fresh. I'm also a fan of the flavors. Whenever I bite into my regular (medium #15 on wheat with added turkey), the taste just sends me right back to childhood. 

Something to note... They're making the sandwiches fresh, slicing each and every piece of meat, and handcrafting the toppings as per the customer's choices. That sort of care takes time! It just does. So the complaints about long lines and slow service fall flat for me. If you want FAST food, then maybe Port of Subs isn't the place for your quick lunch break. 

Also, as an employee of a family business, I happen to appreciate that this Port of Subs is a family affair as well. I noticed some previous reviews knocking the company for this... But I certainly don't think it's a con, in any capacity, for a family to run a restaurant. They know what they're doing, and they do it well.",Wy1QW1iUzTYVw0jw970sUg,1,0,4,B0XW55gJl6OaOkXaeV_TaA
2051603,2016-03-28,0,ixGcDkuUrkAlRuqf42nbEA,After only eating subway for years now I finally thought it was time to try another sandwich chain shop. I'm so happy I did!!! The only thing I don't like are the pickles subways are better. Other than that bread is flatter you can even get a lettuce or wheat wrap!,IVCKb8qFsbrzsdaRjW06Dw,0,0,5,td22dsq7n_fbmcou5UrfcQ
2432440,2018-02-21,0,ixGcDkuUrkAlRuqf42nbEA,I visited a port of sub for the first time today. I went through the drive thru. The employees did not address me at all. I could see through the window that 2 employees were working. I asked the employee if they could hear me just to make sure the intercom was working since no one had spoke to me. The employee  Laura told me to give her a few minutes because she had a order that she was completing.  I sat there and waited for 15 mins. Laura never came back to the intercom to take my order. I had my newborn in the car so I did not want to get out. I honked my horn to get her attention. She came back to the intercom and asked me to give her a few more minutes. She never once asked what I wanted or even addressed me as a customer the whole 20 minutes I waited in drive thru with my baby in the car. I asked her who the manager was and if she was on duty she told me no. I asked how to reach her and she proceeded to tell me I can call tomorrow. Never once offering her assistance or asking what I would like to order. As long as there are employees like this working here I will never return. I will be sure to contact management tomorrow when they are in as well.,nVAoBY46vR_rb9oo0xJKMg,0,0,1,mJtpGhYbBpLvuX5EI1vUcg
2496579,2017-01-07,0,ixGcDkuUrkAlRuqf42nbEA,"Since we were in a hurry, we ordered online for a 9:15 a.m. pick up of our sandwich. Arrived at about 9:35, only to find out the sandwich had not even been begun,. I don't know why somebody would have an online ordering system where nobody pays attention. I cannot believe that they have the nerve to even ask for a tip.
I am updating this review as the rest was written before eating the sandwich and just reflects not having our order ready as requested.  The sandwich was fantastic, even after we hauled it around for 3 hours the meat was plentiful and veggies were fresh.

2973311,2018-04-09,0,ixGcDkuUrkAlRuqf42nbEA,This restaurant has a lot of room for improvement. First they closed their drive thru without putting up a sign. I sat there for over 5 minutes waiting for them to answer. When I finally came in they said they closed the drive thru. They didn't even put up a sign. Then they were out of hot pastrami. This was a bad experience. The gorl didn't even apologize. Subway will be my choice next time.,az19M-WgZMtK1fCMd6SJXQ,0,0,1,sgGu_TtWoWdCVtS1S809fQ

The number 13 with pastrami turkey and Swiss on wheat is still my favorite trumping the other 17 selections not including breakfast items.  Next time,  don't hesitate, don't wait,  you don't even have to get dressed really (secrets of a drive thru queen) just get to port of subs for a great sandwich!",u6OIc9ndbqrd6fO_jU2xcw,2,2,5,ygdWQLqn6f2jVg14AyDflA
3628268,2018-06-22,0,ixGcDkuUrkAlRuqf42nbEA,I love port of subs but it's pretty disgusting that they don't wear hairnets or hats and their hair is barely pulled back when making your sandwich with hair flying all over the place.

4278578,2013-08-30,0,ixGcDkuUrkAlRuqf42nbEA,"This place sucks! It looks like a family is running this store. My boyfriend and I went in and instead of having the normal shredded lettuce that they normally have, we had big, chunky, bitter romaine lettuce that they probably had just bought from a grocery store that morning because they ran out. 

Another time we had drove to the drive thru to order and no one came on. We had to call the store to let them know that we were outside waiting for about ten minutes. 

They also make the sandwiches very sloppy and lack on the toppings given. And the workers usually have an attitude. The manager/owner is the most greediest with the sandwiches and will not cut you the correct sized sandwich. Barely enough meat to even go across the bread. 

Overall, this place is trash. Don't go there. You'll be disappointed in your sandwiches.",KCj_7KiExeO2N-U_7bi0Sw,1,0,1,g3RIuf3lEqQba1j8VY0CZA
4451915,2014-12-22,2,ixGcDkuUrkAlRuqf42nbEA,"Been here twice, not impressed.

Port of Subs is actually a very good sub shop. I've been to other locations in other cities, and other locations in Vegas I've been pleased.

I've been here twice and both times have been lacking. Last time I went they were out of wheat bread so I opted for sourdough. The sourdough was dry, dry, dry and like a brick. My husband ordered their ""Pilgrim"" sandwich, he only ate half. It's a play on Thanksgiving (turkey, cranberry, stuffing, and then grilled). He said it can't hold a candle to the Bobbie from Capriotti's.

Also, service is slow. I think this is because they have a drive-thru which typically always has someone in it. With the lack of workers this leaves the few employees they have to work a drive-thru and make sandwiches for the people coming inside.

Quality isn't bad - it's same as other POS I've been to. Location is small. Service is OK, but slow.

If it weren't so close to my house I probably wouldn't go back.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,3,2,J10GvfajhLjGIv1prbkp9w
