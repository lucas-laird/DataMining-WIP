There was teenagers running around all over the place and the employees just ignore you. I had saved a table for my family to sit at. One of the employees took two chairs. I told they that I was saving those chairs for my family, the employee said that they needed it to close the bathrooms and still they took the chairs. I had to move to a different table at that point. 

When I finally got my food, which was the same as every other panda, moderate tasting. At the end of my dinner, we started to hand out the cookies and they ended up not giving us the proper number of cookies. Then, one of the cookies didn't even have a fortune in it. So we were technically screwed out of two cookies! Just the topping of a horrible time!",0yYJt9KjHdXqUrISKZVjCA,0,0,1,A2EOWoIkUkpY-0sJFFhTsA
163085,2015-05-26,0,ErzHs0c5EKwLD_YM2ZjsGQ,"I don't frequent panda express at all, and this location did not help alleviate that trend in the slightest. Customer service was very lackluster. Servers appeared lifeless and unamused, and would not pass information to one another. I had to repeat my answer to their asking if I wanted plates 3 times to 3 different people. Not to mention, they failed to inform us of the wait it would take for one of the items and just let us idly sit by.

It doesn't help that the food isn't too exceptional either. This was probably some of the driest fried rice I have ever had the misfortune to experience. Avoid this Panda location... better yet, go find a better Chinese restaurant.",ByTsWFSr423OVk3oitOPmQ,1,0,1,PcsIDrdVYFvHQ4PAhKI0nQ

565877,2017-01-26,0,ErzHs0c5EKwLD_YM2ZjsGQ,Rose is the nicest lady ever(cashier). The rest of the staff totally ignores her and have loud personal conversations. They took 10 minutes to bring my child's cream cheese rangoons. They were frozen in the middle. They finally came out around the time we were ready to leave. Panda should fire the entire staff besides Rose and start over with this location. I will never eat here again. Overpriced small portions and fully staffed with cocky high school kids.

I called to place an order and the lady who just answered could not answer my question so I asked to speak with someone else and she said hold on. I waited about 5 minutes while she had a full conversation about what days she was working with someone else. She then picked up the phone and hung up on me. I tried calling back and they instantly picked up and hung up on me. I tried back for a third time where they just left the phone sitting there without a greeting, and now they're phone is off the hook. I guess I'll take my business somewhere else.

Once I got my food, some of the beef tasted burnt, from sitting under the heat lamp. And the chow neon was like chow me in, very blah. Probably won't come back, only came for my kids to eat quickly before the movie.",e3T9PP79lQCfu5luDoJDIw,0,0,2,tmDSvQH_CohpmPZmdRtAoQ
2784316,2015-10-04,1,ErzHs0c5EKwLD_YM2ZjsGQ,"I've written a review of 2 stars before. And I am updating my review. Still the worst panda out of all the pandas I've been to. I've been to a lot trying to eat a bit healthier than normal fast food. I did say a bit, I know fast food is unhealthy. But my lunches are short and if I forget to bring a healthy lunch I have my choice of expensive restaurants, pretzels, panda and potato hut, btw potato hut is worse than panda. 

So anyways the stepped up their Kung pow chicken it's spicy now! That's a plus! But the ran goons were dry and cold. They don't make them fresh when you order here.  so the Kung pow brought my hopes up and the rangoons brought them back down. Oh well. The shrimp was cold and old. The chow mein needs some flavor. Still no brown rice. 

Little Mexican girl was really nice. Poor girl got slammed after I got my food.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,3,1,2,t6j_981Fk9RZERK3sR0_Yw
2846531,2017-10-28,1,ErzHs0c5EKwLD_YM2ZjsGQ,"Quick. Customizable. Affordable. That's what you can expect when you go to eat at Panda Express. Since I'm a visual person, particularly with my food, it's nice to have a wide array of dishes to choose from readily available and freshly wok'd. The sweet fire chicken is a hearty choice with balanced flavor - the pineapple chunks offer sweet notes and a glaze over the crispy breaded white meat chicken that delicately cuts through just enough of the bell pepper and spice. If you're opting for a lighter dish try their chicken and greenbean entr√©e which is less caloric yet satisfying.",LC_o79IQTseA2Qi41v_rMg,1,3,3,QwvtoBEZzlcMPYduT4SWwA

Not only that but the staff that work at this location are very friendly and always greeting customers constantly asking if everything is okay with the food. It may get a little hectic sometimes but hey what do expect it's a mall with lots of foot traffic and hungry customers. Overall this place is awesome and always clean.

And she is also very bland threw the intercom .... as you order your food she stays quiet so you don't know if this bimbo is getting your order or not .... she sits there hella quiet ..... RUDE no wonder she works at panda she would never be able to work in the casinos with an attitude like that . Hope someone talks to her about that after this review about her .

3428402,2017-11-07,0,ErzHs0c5EKwLD_YM2ZjsGQ,"So it's Panda Express, about the same as any other Panda, which is good and all, but a couple things to know about this location, in Town Square. It's right next to the movie theater, and the only budget friendly food in the entire mall, so it's always very very busy. Everything else is fine dining, sit down, so this fast food place, is not fast, but that's not really their fault, just something to be prepared for. They have the fast food monopoly there. Other then that, expect what you normally would from Panda.",Zkdq2Gyhi-Q5RasEgenvig,0,0,3,hSPP9trnajFfpBU04utW8w
3640196,2016-02-14,2,ErzHs0c5EKwLD_YM2ZjsGQ,"This Panda Express is the one located in Town Square, south of the Las Vegas Strip in between AMC and Yogurtland.

I went with some of my friends to this location on a Saturday night before watching a movie next door and this place was packed. Walking in the place was filthy. All the trash cans were overflowing and the tables were topped with pieces of noodles, rice and spilt sauces =T I understand that it was a busy night but there were so many workers in the kitchen and not one out maintaining the front. 

I stayed in line and ordered what I always order at Panda, tofu eggplant and orange chicken with half noodles and half brown rice. As people in front of me ordered I noticed each one complaining that they weren't being given a fair amount of food for each of the sides as well as the noodles and rice. They were nice enough to add more to actually fill the plate, but you'd think that after a few complaints they would realize that they doing something sketch. When it was my turn the server did the exact same thing everything was half full lol (shaking my head).

I gave them a one and a half star because the food was fine but because they had brown rice I gave them an extra half =]]",YTl5q-1rvWGqtPs1bX7-hQ,5,2,2,A2ftyzV6kHeMy-x4O7fwaA
4655001,2017-10-24,8,ErzHs0c5EKwLD_YM2ZjsGQ,"I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch special. However, good Chinese restaurants that serve lunch specials are not everywhere. That includes the Town Square Mall in Las Vegas. I'd settle for Panda Express. 

This past Saturday I had lunch in the Town Panda Express. For the record it is one of the few fast food restaurants in Town Square. And for the record, regardless that it is close to five years old, it is one of the newer Las Vegas locations. Situated in the AMC Theater promenade in Town Square it is a relatively small location that provides one row of booths and tables. On a Saturday afternoon, the tables were nearly full to capacity. I can only imagine the seating capacity issue on a weekend movie night.

I started off this review by saying that I am a fan of the Chinese lunch special. I must emphasize that although I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant restaurant lunch special, I generally regard Panda Express favorably. In the following paragraph this review compares this Panda Express experience to the Chinese lunch special.

The first difference is the method of ordering. When I visit a Chinese restaurant, I generally order off a menu then wait for the cook to make my food. Walking into the Town Square Panda Express, the food was presented in tin trays (that's what I call them). The kitchen had made the food and now it was in a warm tray. The problem with this presentation is what I call the Panda syndrome. This is when an item is so low that the cooking oil dominates the tray. As I've mentioned in a couple of earlier Panda Express reviews, ""it is unappealing."" There have been a couple of times that I walked out of a Panda Express because of this. As a matter of fact I passed over the eggplant with tufu because of the Panda syndrome. The second difference between the two are pricing. In general, a lunch special comes out to between $9 and $10 after tip. At Panda the two item combo with a small refillable Pepsi drink came out to $10.65. The difference in price is nothing remarkable. However, the difference in dining experience is noticeable considering that one is fast food and the other is a full service restaurant. The third difference is the familiarity of the product. The majority of Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas excluding China A Go Go are independently owned establishments that serve their own style of food. The fried rice at XO Chinese Restaurant might taste better than at China Wok. The nice thing about Panda Express is that their food is identical at each location. That is a good thing. I appreciate their fried rice, chow mein noodles, fire cracker chicken, and other items. In my humble opinion their soft chow mein noodles is far better than many of the independent Chinese restaurants. I ordered the soft chow mein noodles as one of the entrees while making the fried rice a side dish. As the picture shows, half the plate is fried rice. The second entr√©e I ordered was the fire cracker chicken. Lastly, at Panda Express the packet sauces play a greater roll in my experience than the Chinese restaurants. I will always top off the fried rice with at least two packets of soy sauce and the fire cracker or orange chicken with two packets of their hot sauce.

At the conclusion of my dining experience, I walked back outside to the AMC theater prominade temporarily filled up and satisfied. Regardless that this is a dining experience that falls short of many of the Chinese restaurant lunch specials that I've enjoyed in this city, I rate it ""3 Stars.""",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,7,3,44Nxh_ujXIFfFqg4yUOb6g

5401594,2017-04-09,0,ErzHs0c5EKwLD_YM2ZjsGQ,"This Panda Express is located at Town Square next to the AMC theater. I mean, Panda Express is Panda Express. I feel like they've gotten a little more expensive than they used to be. We came when it just opened for the day so not all the food was made yet -- had to wait 5-ish minutes for the entree I wanted. Staff is friendly, good customer service but nothing above average. 

I think everyone knows how Panda Express works -- an Asian Chipotle lol. I normally get a bowl with fried rice and Kung Pao Chicken (spicy chicken with peanuts and way too many vegetables). Their orange chicken is good but majority of the time is super strong, smell and flavor wise. Their mushroom chicken is good, too, but kinda watery. 

I'd really only come to Panda if there's nothing else to eat or if I'm really craving some friend rice and Kung Pao Chicken.",7mjpX2eYbcCt1pcNnN3Hrw,1,1,3,0cY4IPlb49WCmVExeC-e2w
