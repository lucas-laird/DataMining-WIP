Steve, ""The People's Chef "" greeted us at our table, he was super friendly, and had great suggestions from the menu.  The pasta dish was spectacular and rivals any other outstanding fresh pasta dish we might have tried at high end eateries.

For breakfast, he custom made some Bananas Foster pancakes for my daughter that were perfection.  Attention to detail, freshness and presentation made this trip a very memorable experience.  Will be going back to visit Chef Steve's kitchen soon!",asqL8QyElLn9E7xozLObkg,2,0,5,OLdUIkg60aOeyers1FUK1Q

This was weird, but he proved extremely nice and helpful all night.

I got the polenta, and my friend Kent got the burger. We also got the hummus appetizer. The polenta was salty, but the burger and hummus were decent.

The pricing is very reasonable, even though the place is located in Rumor. I'm not sure I would go back, but it was worth the experience to check out the hotel.

992379,2012-03-28,1,L9hxsakFxY315yPqCZL-zQ,"We dined as a party of four and we had the place to ourselves on a Saturday night. Not a single other diner until we were nearly done with dessert. I didn't realize it, but the food is tapas style. We probably would've been better off ordering ala carte, rather than the prix-fixe three course Restaurant Week menu for $30.12. At least our tab benefited charity.

We started with French Onion Soup and Mac Bites; Deep Fried Smoked Gouda and Cheddar Mac & Cheese. The Mac Bites were real tasty, the soup wasn't very good. It lacked the richness it should have and it was overpowered by salt.

Next up was Mixed greens with Toasted Walnuts and a Citrus Vinaigrette. It was lightly dressed and the greens were crisp. Nothing too notable, however.

The salad was followed by Seared then Braised Short Ribs with Sweet Potato Puree, Crispy Potato Strings, Smoked Salt, and a Wild Honey Port-Burgundy Sauce. Tasty, but the portion was small and without the potato strings it would've been like baby food. 

Dessert concluded our meal we had the gossip sundae with green tea ice cream, bananas and fried wontons. Not bad, nor memorable. The lava cake was a bit dry. Not recommended.

Addiction is an odd place, with decent food. I like what they are trying to do, and on occasion they may successful, but this particular Saturday? It was a ghost town. We actually felt like we were part of a horror movie at times. We dined early to avoid the Saturday night crowds, I guess you could say we suceeded. But we're certainly not addicted.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,2,0,3,_lHkZMBhencEQETSbZt_jg

1243746,2012-03-04,0,L9hxsakFxY315yPqCZL-zQ,"Burned by Addiction yet again! My mom wanted to come here for her birthday and because she is an incredibly picky eater, I conceded after offering her many other restaurant options of which I knew we'd have a substantially better eating and service experience. After leaving dinner my mom told me I could pick the restaurants from here on out. She said she trusted me. Sometimes it takes just having the bad experience all up in your face!

Our waitress was nice, but inattentive not out of laziness but because she was the only waitress there and I'm sure waitressing was not her only job duty. The food was meh-everything fell flat and presentation was deeply disappointing and unsatisfying. I ordered the parmesan fries and french onion soup and my mom ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu and also got french onion soup, a salad, seared ahi and a sundae. 

I feel like if a restaurant is going to offer a classic dish like French onion soup, they either better put their own spin on it or it better be the best of the best. This version was neither and I think they tried to hide this fact with an unforgivable amount of salt. The cheese was neither melted nor hot-just a slice of some identifiable cheese that at one point been melted but was now sitting as a thick, unappetizing layer on top of the soup. Underneath it was a slice of what appeared to be wheat bread. It had soaked up the liquid of the soup and was soggy and again, unappetizing. The broth's only minimally redeeming quality was the abundance of onions, but that was overpowered by a broth that was so offensively salty, that if I had hypertension I'd be writing this review from my grave.

The rest of the food was mediocre at best- my mom nailed it when she said my fries tasted like Jack in the Box fries, which I like! But I could've paid $2 for those instead of $6. Presentation was bad on her ahi and it should've been served with some starch-possibly polenta or potatoes-in addition to the salad. 

I don't want to keep bashing the place because it has potential. The food needs work and the restaurant operations could definitely use a boost a la Restaurant Impossible. Being the only restaurant at Rumor, they really need to either step their game up and invest in better quality food and additional staff or shut the restaurant down completely and use the space for something else.",DZOA0yCbH4kDS0s-dHXWFg,3,0,2,o-rpjyioHsedaHB5yxOYSQ

The place was pretty empty except for a few tables, and we ended up sitting outside.  

The menu has a decent selection, and everything was very reasonably priced compard to other restaurants like this one that are on the strip.  We got a ton of food, all of which was delicious! Here's what we had:

Appetizers:
Kobe Sliders ($9) -- 3 tasty sliders loaded with bacon & cheese
Chicken and Bacon Quesadilla ($8) -- Mmm, more bacon and cheese, can't go wrong there! haha
Mac Styx ($7) -- YUM!! Two large pieces of deep-fried mac & cheese... this was my fav appetizer of the three.  

Entrees:
Karmal Pork ($19) -- A thick, large pork chop, smothered in amazing caramel - whisky glaze, with creamy mashed potatoes and veggies.  It was phenomenal!! Easily one of the best pork dishes I've ever had at a restaurant.
House Filet ($26) -- This was very similar to the Karmal Pork, but with filet mignon and a slightly different sauce, and was equally delicious.  This and the pork are the two most expensive items on the menu, but since they come with all the sides and are huge portions, they are very reasonably priced!!  

Dessert: 
Da ""Nutta Butta"" ($6): 4 deep-fried nutter butter cookies served with raspberry dipping sauce... OMG.  So good!! But we were so full we had to bring most of them home to enjoy later.
Also, since it was my birthday, they brought out 3 complimentary mini-cupcakes for us (they serve them as a dessert option, from Gigi's cupcakes nearby).  They were pretty good too :) 

Service was great throughout and our waitress was very friendly and attentive (then again, it wasn't that busy).  Overall I was extremely happy with this place & thought the food was fantastic and decently priced.  I'd absolutely go back & would highly recommend this place!

1911501,2012-01-25,0,L9hxsakFxY315yPqCZL-zQ,"Had a Restaurant.com gift cert so decided to try Addiction for dinner before heading over to the HRH for the Adult Entertainment Expo parties last Friday night.

Upon entrance into the lobby of the Rumor Hotel, we could see the restaurant, but were a little unclear as to where the entrance was, but the combo of hunger and determination was the engine that drove us to a successful seating in the main (but SMALL) dining room.

Menu has changed as of January 2012 ... They no longer have entrees on their dinner menu ... Only the burger bar and ""Tapastizers"".  We opted for the tapas. Our server was friendly and accomodating. Perhaps a little too chatty, because he engaged us in a conversation that went a little long and when he remembered that we had placed a food order, he rushed into the kitchen to fetch our food, but every dish was slightly luke warm, rather than HOT.  One star gone.

Another star lost, due to the fact that the tapas were adequate, but nothing terribly impressive.  

Here is what we ordered:

French Onion Soup: Very rich broth, with yummy melty cheesey goodness on top. Enjoyable, but I found the broth to be a little too intense and lacking the sweet mellowness of some of the better dining venues around town.

Parmesean French Fries:  Very good, and cooked to a crisp coating, and seasoned well and generously with grated parm. YUM

Short and Sweet:  Pork short ribs on top of whipped sweet taters and topped with a rich burgundy sauce (3 little piles).  Pretty good, but could have been better, had they been served at the appropriate temp.

Flat Iron Steak Tacos: Good, but almost room temp when served. Probably would have enjoyed these the most, if they had been served hot.

Overall, not bad food, decent service, and unique atmosphere.  Was happy we had the gift cert though, because I don't think our experience was worth full-price. Nevertheless, I would like to return and try their burger bar and happy hour deals!",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,2,2,3,DcnHbc7E0PT4jQhuHt6J9g

2638911,2013-09-28,1,L9hxsakFxY315yPqCZL-zQ,"I am SO torn about this restaurant inside the Rumor Hotel.  It's so cool and funky in there all sparkly and black and white and silver and the restaurant is all white white white.  Love the decor.  Also loved that as we waited at the hostess stand, the chef came out and greeted us and introduced himself and seated us, telling us about a change on the menu that day.

What I didn't love is that it seems like maybe whoever was supposed to be waiting tables didn't show up and the bartender acted as our server.  He was very personable and friendly, but the service was terribly slow and it took a LONG time from when we did order before the food was made and delivered.  then the bill was incorrect and then the credit card didn't go through and he had to chase us down.  In their defense, their computer went down and they were having technical difficulties.

BUT, that said, the food was delicious.  My husband REALLY loved his meal which was chicken sliders with potatoes and fried eggs... I had the burger and added a fried egg and it was also really good, although I would have preferred my burger and my egg a little less done.

Overall, it was a REALLLLY long visit, we were probably there about an hour and a half, but somehow we weren't cranky and had an okay time.  And the food is very affordability priced!

Anyways he was calling to tell me that my reservation had been canceled due to the entire restaurant being bought out. Then he tried to blame it on the fact that I booked the reservation on open table. couldn't they block out the day on open table? I know this was a last minute thing; just own up to it.

The filet mignon was amazing and priced well @ $26!  It came with a port sauce/gravy and pesto oil, topped with homemade mashed potatoes, then topped with the filet, which was topped with fried crunchy potato sticks/slivers.  On the side were three steamed asparagus stalks (NOT ala carte!).  The pesto oil was AMAZING!  It complimented everthing on the plate!

Ben Ortiz is the manager and was also our server that night.  I can really appreciate his hard work and public relationships he is trying to establish with this young restaurant.  

With that said, Ben did a fine job serving his two dining tables (plus he was serving a birthday party).  Even though we only ordered two filet mignon dinners and two glasses of pinot noir, Ben brought us two additional items at NO charge.  The first was an appetizer.  It was the Thai Chicken Satay w/peanut sauce, yummo!  The chicken had a great Asian flavor, and was so tender and moist.  The second item Ben brought was dessert.  It was the fried Nutter Butters with a delicious raspberry liquor dipping sauce.  I'm not big on deep fried items, nor am I a cookie monster but, these things were quite addicting!

To preface the night, there was a medium sized birthday party held in the lounge/bar/lobby area which overflowed into the small dining area.  There was a DJ spinning music which really complimented the ambiance of the modern decor.  Although, we were only one of two different dining parties, I would still recommend reservations due to the amount of parties and private functions the hotel/restaurant does business with.  

We were so impressed with the food last week, that I just called to make reservations for tonight!!!!  This place is now my ""Addiction""!!!",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,4,4,5,JeINQgRSEF30xhYXZmyQYg
2927150,2011-09-21,4,L9hxsakFxY315yPqCZL-zQ,"I really think someone might've kidnapped the banana man.

Why is it that two out of the TWO times I've been here they were out of bananas? Yes people, BANANAS. According to Norm K., they were also out of bananas when he went, so I'm not the only one that has witnessed this. They should just change the description of the Gossip Sundae, so they don't have to tell people they're out of bananas whenever someone orders it. 

Other than the mystery of the missing bananas, the layout and seating situation of this place is just weird. When you walk toward the pool area of Rumor, you'll see the bar on the right, and on the left you'll see what appears to be an eating area, but there is no hostess or wall of separation to let you know that's the restaurant. You can only assume it's Addiction because you'll see some people eating and staring at you while you look all puzzled. Finally, after a few minutes or so, the waiter will come out to fill someone's water or something, then see you standing there. He'll take you to a table and hand you some menus, but both of the times I've gone, I had to ask for the tapas menu because they didn't give it along with the regular menu. 

I've ordered:
Cuban Ruben w/ pesto salad ($9) - The sandwich was dry. The pesto salad was bland. I pretty much attacked my boyfriend's burger because my food was too boring.

Custom burger medium well w/ fries and fried egg, swiss, mushrooms, avocado, aioli toppings($11) - Yummy. Of course this sh*t was good, I picked the toppings myself! Very juicy and oozing with flavors. I finished the whole thing and most of the well seasoned crispy fries. Funny how much I love crispy fries nowadays when I used to push those aside from the soggy fries I was so obsessed with as a child. 

Black Cod Tostadas ($10) - So delicious! The bass was perfectly blackened and the lime cilantro Remoulade added a nice little kick. It came with roasted tomato salsa, but I didn't even use it because dish was already flavorful. We devoured all of it within 5 minutes.  

Mediterranean Plate ($10) - This came with Hummus, Eggplant and Tzatziki and toasted pitas. I just ate the pitas with Hummus and Tzatziki because the eggplant was so sour and pickled. 

Both visits, I ordered the Gossip Sundae, which was actually quite good aside from the missing bananas. The green tea ice cream didn't really taste how it should though, it tasted like pistachio (as Mel L. mentioned) but I'm a fan of pistachio ice cream anyway. I'm curious as to how this sundae would taste if it had all the correct ingredients though. 

3 stars for a tasty burger, delicious tostadas, and very nice food presentation. Minus two for sub par service, strange layout, and lack of bananas.

The sliders were supposed to have the gravy in the side and it was in the slider.  The gravy was a tad gross and mucus-slimy-like...and I was done.

The place is gorgeous and has a ton of potential...I felt like hotel guests were passing us by like ""Damn nobody told them to eat elsewhere!""

We thought it was a blessing in disguise..however, it was a far cry from it.

We got the following:
-amuse bouche: oyster topped with foam -the oyster does not taste fresh.  Foam wasn't tasty enough to cover the fishy taste.  My fiance wanted to spit it out but thought it would be rude.
-seared scallops: although they were cooked well and the flavors were decent, it was gritty.  They were not clean well.
-NY Skirt Strip:  I ordered this medium rare, it came out COLD.  
-Pan-Roasted Salmon: Salmon was cooked well, however, it was under-seasoned, for a person such as myself who does not eat much salt with my food.  I also was chomping on some grit.  Gross.
-Bread pudding:  This was very tasty.  There were slices of apples within the chunky bread pudding, on top of a perfectly balanced sauce, and a small scoop of icecream.  
-Chocolate molten cake:  came with a small scoop of icecream, which was not enough to cut the richness of the chocolate cake.  Was good, but not as good as the Bread pudding.

Based on the very below par food we had tonight on the ""Valentine Dinner,"" I will have to say no, we will not be returning.  

Oh, my fiance asked if they have McCallan, response was no.  Then he asked if they have Maker, response was no.  My fiance then peeked at their bar and spotted Johnny Walker.

It's on the pricier side but for lazy people like me it's great to have such amazing food in the hotel. YUM. 

Cuban Ruben is really good. OMG delicious sandwich. I wish I could make this at home! It has great texture and is just yum.

The Skinny Dip sandwich is good as well but I liked the Cuban Ruben better. The Skinny Dip is meatier but the Ruben is just a combination of flavors and textures. YummmmO.

The pasta salad is a cold pesto pasta salad and that was ok. I wish it was less oily but it was decent.

Baked Tomato and Mozzarella Salad was delicious but I happen to love tomato and mozzarella together ALWAYS so I knew I would enjoy it. Delish.

If you're really hungry get the Karmal Pork. I know it seems pricey for pork but it is definitely a must get dish. The pork is delicious and the garlic mashed potatoes are garlicky and yummy. If you like pork, potatoes, and garlic you'll like this.

One of our waiters was chill and awesome. The other was a bit too attentive but he mentioned he was bored since it was slow so I guess that is that.

First, when I got to the podium, there was no one around.  Immediately behind me at the bar were 3 employees.  They all saw me, yet not one said a word--not so much as a ""someone will be right there"" or ""let me go get someone.""  Nothing, nada!  Several minutes went by and a woman appeared from a door which turned out to be the kitchen.  She then seated me.  Little thing #1.

I had a Groupon and she asked to see it.  When I loaded it on my iPhone she stated she wasn't sure they were doing it that way.  They wanted a paper printout.  At that point I was ready to leave so she said she'd talk to the manager.  He agreed to take the Groupon number if they could copy my ID.  What?  Little thing #2.

There are 6 entrees on the dinner menu and 6 items on the dessert menu.  They forgot one item from my steak and they were out of bananas for the dessert.  Their banana supplier had not yet been there.  Little thing getting bigger #3.

Charge for a second iced tea at $3.  It was a partial refill. I had 1/3 left when she asked if I wanted more.  Bigger little thing #4.

Now for the meal--it was superb!  I got the 8 ounce filet which was on a bed of garlic-onion mashed potatoes (the menu says puree, but it isn't).  There were 5 stalks of grilled asparagus for the seasonal vegetable (they were perfect!), and the drizzled Port syrup was very tasty.  The crispy tater strings were forgotten or maybe they hadn't been delivered yet, either.

For dessert, I had the Gossip Sundae--green tea ice cream on powdered crispy wontons with butter rum caramel sauce, caramelized bananas, and walnuts.  Of course, the bananas were missing.

Plating for the entree and dessert were nicely done.  I looked at some of the photos for the restaurant to see what I should have gotten.  I sure wish they had gotten their delivery!

I'm not sure if I'll give Addiction another chance.  It is good, but there are too many little things that just add up to a subtraction in the enjoyment of the meal.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,4,3,Ez6nCSGJoDHl9mw2el-FsQ

The bf was a little wary when it was all neon pink and bright white but he's always up for something new. The bar had a few patrons but the restaurant was empty. The bartender called to us as we were finding a table that we would need to order from her and then I had to search up my own menu.... and just as I was starting to rethink my decision she started to SHINE. She was fun, funny, cute, perky and just had a great personality. She apologized frequently that she felt she was neglecting us (she wasn't) and that she was trying to split her time between the bar and us. She did mention in passing that the wait staff and the chef no-showed (reading the other reviews this seems to be a trend) but that the executive chef was manning the kitchen and she was getting her cardio in! The bf ordered the Country Breakfast Sliders and I had the Classic Breakfast. My only disappointment with the food was the hashbrowns. I'm from Idaho, I expect real, fresh, crispy, grated potatoes on my plate. Instead I got a patty of frozen potato- but truly the best damn patty of hasbrowns I have ever had! They were delicious! I was doing some serious eyeballing of the sliders and cursing my gluten intolerance - fresh roll, country gravy, chicken fried steak...YUMMMY. I will say that the portions are small. It was perfect for me, but the bf would have been hungry if he hadn't hauled down a few pieces of left over pizza while we were packing.

The Salmon was also perfectly cooked.  

The atmosphere was so relaxed, dinning on the patio in the evening was the perfect way to start a night in Vegas.

I've been here a few times - one time for Happy Hour where we literally got everything off their ""tapatizer"" menu to try (bill ended up being like 70 bucks and that included drinks).  The food here is pretty good - I'd say based off their tapatizer list, half of it is great, half of it is just OK.  It might get pricey for non-happy hour hours.

The place itself is definitely hip and trendy.  Service has always been very nice and surprisingly quick.  The restaurant is open to the lobby of the hotel and open to the patio near the pool area.  At first, it's kind of confusing because it's not a ""separate"" restaurant, but once you sit down, it really isn't a big deal.  One thing to note is that I think you can only valet here, so remember to bring a couple bucks for the valet guy.  

My favorite ""tapatizers"" here include:

Filet & Caprese sliders (Happy Hour Price:  $6) 
This is my number one favorite thing here.  I do not share this with anyone!  It's a filet mignon cut of meat with mozzarella cheese and a tomato with this amazing garlic aioli.  It comes with two nice sized sliders and fries.  Honestly, this and a drink or two would make for a nice dinner in itself.  

Mac Styx (Happy Hour Price:  $3.50)
Anything fried is always good.  Just try it - you get two nicely sized portioned deep fried mac and cheese bars. 

Seared Tuna (Happy Hour Price:  $5)
My husband's favorite thing here.  Seared rare tuna with these great sauces and a side of some fancy tasting salad.  The flavors are bold and delicate.  Portion sized is slightly smaller, but for 5 bucks, can't complain!

Chili Dog Sliders (Happy Hour Price:  $4.50)
For the hot dog fans out there, try out these little guys.  They're mini hot dogs with chili made out of kobe beef (which to me, tastes like regular chili).  You get two of them and fries, so for $4.50, it's a decent deal.

The Kobe sliders, chicken sliders, and the short ribs are all solid choices too.

Things I would probably be able to skip on the ""tapatizer"" menu are the quesadillas (tastes regular, nothing special) and chili cheese fryz (a lot of the dishes come with fries already!).     

One thing I noticed on both my visits here - my beer is never ice cold.  It's cool, but never cold.  I don't know - just thought I would mention that!  I'll probably be back here for those Caprese sliders.",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,3,0,3,THJPJjPw9lFg9ixaYxvHlg

The service is what really stood out.  Some in our party were vegetatian, and the vegetarian options on the menu were pretty limited, but we made do and the server was super accommodating about it.

I ordered the pesto pasta, and when I asked the server if it was good, he hesitated and said he might need to ask the kitchen to make another batch because the last one was sub-par. He went into the kitchen and tried the pasta, came back out and told me it was okay after all, so I ended up getting it.  It was totally good, so no worries, but I freaking love the honesty/effort that was put in to make sure I'd enjoy my meal!

We also got the bacon popcorn as a starter and that was yummy and a fun snack to start the meal out with.

Someone even said it looked like a rockstar's girlfriend's room, and quite frankly, I would love to be a rockstar's girlfriend if I get to live in a place like Addiction. 

Unfortunately, plans changed and instead of sticking to my 6PM reservations, the gang and I decided to opt for brunch so we can make it to Marquee to see Kaskade. Bust on both parts. While the food itself delivered quite well, nobody at the table had anything to complain about, it was so painfully slow service that earned them just two stars. We awkwardly walked into the dining area, with not a soul there to greet us. When the host/waiter seated us and took our order, we seriously had our suspicions that he was the host/waiter/chef. Not even joking. It took our salads and sandwiches a whopping 45minutes to come out-- and we were the only table there! Luckily, I purchased a restaurant.com voucher for $50 and our bill came out to about $12/person. Not too shabby for a meal in Vegas at all.

The whole setting of the restaurant and hotel is quite interesting.. it almost looks like an upscale motel. Am I addicted to Addiction? Nope. Won't be back again unless someone else wants to do their birthday there!",Nza9TrumxVALFOc3zpPxDg,9,4,2,8l377Tr31lLN4Fz0GeMbwA

I recently dined at Addiction for a friend's bachelor party and was very impressed.  We had a number of the entrees, including the chicken, the filet, and a pork chop special.  All the entrees were delicious...but the steak and chops really stood out.

For the quality of food at Addiction, the prices are unheard of.  You would pay 1.5x to 2x for comparable meals elsewhere in Las Vegas.

What out-shined the food was the service.  For a big group, and one that was boisterous (to say the least), the servers were patient, and warm, and extraordinarily helpful and accommodating.  They truly took pride in the restaurant, the food, and the overall dining experience.

Addiction is without a doubt worth the taxi ride from the strip, and definitely worth the walk across the street from Hard Rock.

I will be back in Las Vegas in 2 weeks, and we will be dining at Addiction again.  I can't wait to share the experience with more of my friends and family!!!",Z4pdCiP26QspE4W9KUdQ3w,1,0,5,KSkSxTg22BGswcqWNfV5vQ

It was casual, but I liked the ambiance. It's fairly open to the hotel lobby and bar, and it's decorated in a very fun modern way. They had a DJ playing in the lounge, which I liked.

The food was actually really good!! I want to go back and try some more stuff off of their tapatizers menu. We ordered the fried mac and cheese (hello, how can you go wrong?) and the garlic sauce they gave to dip it in was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Then I got a burger (yum), and my friend got salmon with pesto mashed potatoes, which was AWESOME.  The menu is pretty small, but overall I really enjoyed it. I think the Rumor is a new little gem just off the strip, and I'll definitely be returning to Addiction.",BziofR3zHRBOudM2-l6yNg,2,0,4,UNLE8OjC3XkdDgIa21KIkQ
