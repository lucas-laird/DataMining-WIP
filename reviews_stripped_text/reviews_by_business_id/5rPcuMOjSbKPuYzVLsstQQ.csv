The pizza itself was good, but the trouble I had getting it makes me not want to go back. They barely spoke English so it took them forever to get my order correct and to add on I had to wait about 20 minutes for my pizza. I was the ONLY one in the store. Not to mention when I finally got the pizza it wasn't hot. It was sorta warm but they could have done much better.",suPIiDo2pcIdRV1H9nPP6Q,1,0,2,KmHLLpY__u8icLuqqkxkyA

They didnt say a word till I went back in, because all I had was a pepperoni pizza.  No sorry or warning or anything.  Pizza was really bad as well.  This place has been going down hill for at least a year.  I finally learned my lesson.",aZ4V3OUdvYc1mZJ4-JnE9A,1,0,1,3JFTnuukopBfPe0xiJEh2A

Walk in ask to go lite on pepperoni the whole time I waiting here he keeps saying I never heard of somebody order light anything . I was about to say something to his face but it wasn't worth it . That's why you work at a papa johns lol.  won't be coming back to this location anymore . Staff and managers are douchbags .,8RVGzkReCFeWAAMBy0Cihg,1,0,1,XdfwLV1jI02rANJw-QbKEg
1900906,2017-09-05,0,5rPcuMOjSbKPuYzVLsstQQ,"So no where on their site when I was ordering did it state I couldn't pay with a $50 bill and when the delivery driver showed up he was very rude about the situation and told me ""you should have called and spoke to the manager if you wanted to pay with a large bill so how else will you pay"" and I explained to him that's all the money I had so he just took my food and left. Then upon calling the store they told me that's their policy. I understand it's your policy, but that should be stated. Not to mention, that gives no excuse for the driver being rude about it. I never thought I could feel embarrassed for having TOO MUCH MONEY for something, but I was wrong!!!",27_VkTaK9G0LCEEJRCbNDg,0,0,1,4k87kqMAokDhvvqdaLMC_g

I placed an online order and it was going to take 95 minutes, I called to confirm and they said they had only one delivery driver working!  They did not offer any type of compensation for future order, I will never order again.  Dominoes and Pizza Hut are far better options!

2362009,2017-04-04,1,5rPcuMOjSbKPuYzVLsstQQ,"Order online through the App. I Always forget the condiments (which used to be free, but I digress). I pay with debit card. I call store to add condiments. Here are my options: charge my card twice and chase a refund 2 days later. Change to cash and pay the entire order with cash upon delivery (basically double charging again, since I already paid on my card) or go without. Because adding condiments is too hard for this group. Cameron who claimed to be the manager there couldn't tell me what was going to happen with my card. And refunding me. Or when. So I just said forget it. We will go without condiments. And never order a papa johns pizza again. It's that simple. Tons of pizza delivery in Vegas. Why choose you? Overcharge. Double charge. And make something as simple as ordering a pizza a problem I have to fix now. What a joke.",DjtfKR0sUeAsxVCTOoC4Kg,0,0,1,tWL5PdiVmRI8YooU_1YngA

We ordered square cut and they did not do that. Next time, we got a pizza with absolutely NO SAUCE- we did get a free pizza after that but it was not square cut we did not bother going back a third time. Also, we ordered a square cut pizza again tonight and they didn't bother to do it again. Not only that, when we went to go pick up our pizza tonight the three guys there seemed super careless about everything. Three times in a row they messed up our order, we aren't going to come back again, very disappointed.",1xx23TeJANXnExyxTs7AoQ,2,0,1,uW-EfEW24Ln7A517DRI_Eg

I usually have to call after I place the order online to make sure they cut it right. How hard can following simple order instructions be? ARGG!",4fE37HSVJitQlI78K8uM1A,2,1,2,oAxk3FSF1DzG5E5tCX7Blw
4164692,2017-10-22,0,5rPcuMOjSbKPuYzVLsstQQ,"Been ordering take out and occasional delivery from this location for about 5 years.  We aren't frequent pizza eaters,  but have been ordering more often now that Papa John's added gluten free pizza - granted it is not completely free of gluten exposure but nice option for those gluten sensitive or choosing to limit it in their diet.  The app is nice and the location good for pickup on the way home in the summerlin area. Have always used the app, and have never had an order messed up.  You do have to figure out the app and maybe takes longer than a phone call, but no waiting on hold and No order mistakes.  We love the healthier, less greasy pizza style of Papa John's and chicken and fresh veggie options too.  Using the app points and deals always available make the price reasonable.  Full menu prices are a bit steep for pizzas that are smaller than competitors.  They do tend to go light on the use of sauce, but there is a an option for heavier sauce as well as light or heavy cheese when ordering on the app.  We light hand tossed crust with heavier sauce no matter what toppings were ordering.. also the premium 4 blend cheese alternative is tasty and we put that on most everything as well.  Enjoy!!",7XCh9Ii_REMe58_Jyo7XpQ,0,0,5,xuRn4BDqwVzZJ3d13Pd0yQ

4828609,2014-08-02,0,5rPcuMOjSbKPuYzVLsstQQ,I used to love Papa John's pizza a lot. This is our neighborhood store and for the past several years we have ordered both take out and delivery from them. The pizza has been okay - not the best. The other night we had to be somewhere at 7:30 (on a Tuesday) and ordered delivery from them at 6:00. An email said the pizza would be here in 20-30 minutes. At 6:45 we called to ask where the pizza was and at 7:15 it still wasn't here so we cancelled it since we had to leave and were already late. At 7:25 the guy showed up with the pizza. We told the guy we cancelled it and he left. If you are on a time schedule and want pizza from this Papa John's order early.,4TOydrfx1__SgB-pFvXVCg,3,0,2,ZklpiH19oJUMYJIOrMytTg

Took almost 2 hours to get my delivery and let me tell you I was not happy about that. They need more delivery drivers and maybe a better management team.

5500503,2015-09-12,0,5rPcuMOjSbKPuYzVLsstQQ,"I signed up for the emails and rewards years ago so I could take advantage of specials and earn free pizzas and such. For as long as I've been ordering online, there has never been and still isn't anywhere to put a ""please prepare well-done"" option for their wings. I have called and asked how exactly I put this ""special request"" in with my online order, and was told to place the order and then call in. So, I always place the order online, then call and request well-done wings. Always. Every time. Mildly inconvenient, but the online specials and deals save you more money than calling in with an order. So, it is what it is. I placed my online order today and then called to request the wings well-done as always and was told by the man on the phone that he couldn't do that without canceling my order and starting over. And yes, I'd lose my discounts that way. I said I had been to the store before. It's rather small. Can't he just yell ""well-done"" to whoever is preparing the wings? As anyone would do in any other restaurant? He laughed and said they are extremely busy. I was a little surprised doing exactly what I had been told to do now suddenly doesn't work. I should have cancelled the whole order, but of course my kids would have been bummed. Instead I said I guess I'll cook the wings more when they are delivered. I was half expecting him to change his tune and tell me he doesn't want me to have to do that. Instead he said okay and hung up. Lousy to say the least. After all these years of loyalty, I guess I'm breaking up with Papa Johns tonight. Pitiful customer service. I will not be back.",T5AJr4NotVejcioO7aU6RA,1,0,1,4u1HsQQIU_kJGMjOnU2tkA
