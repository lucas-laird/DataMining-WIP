The seafood tower was one of the worst we've ever had in town.  We ordered the biggest seafood tower for four but they gave us a serving for two.  The crab legs were so skinny there was no meat to pull out,  two very small half lobster tails served in a large metal bowl.  Our server was very nice but he had to say they were out or didn't have several items we asked for.  $400 is not worth this steakhouse.  The Decor inside was very nice though so it's unfortunate that the food wasnt up to standards.

We always sit at the bar in places because generally service is always faster and more attentive. Luckily we saw the menu online because the bartender never gave us one. When my husband ordered a Miller Lite she said it was not on HH. Had to bust out my phone with the online menu to show her it was. She said no one comes in for HH. Really? Other than that, service was ok the rest of the time. Not fantastic.....just ok

Both the bar and restaurant are beautiful. A very warm & inviting atmosphere We ordered a crab cake & a burger. Excellent! They also brought out a little tasting of a tuna poke that was delicious.

1) wasn't provided a place setting until after food arrived and I requested
2) had no knife, and when asked he literally took the knife from the guy next to me and gave it to me, wtf?
3) would pour the wine from my bottle like I was drinking a boxed wine
4) as for food decent enough for the price, but creme brulee was cold (not chilled) throughout including the top

The service was impressive from the minute you check in at the front until the time you leave.  Our server was attentive, but not intrusive.  Our appetizers consisted of the onion soup (oh the yummy melted cheese!), a beautifully presented salad, and oysters on the half shell -- all were delicious.  Our filets were cooked to perfection and our sides, the maitake mushrooms and the potato gratin, were great!  They have an impressive wine and spirits list to choose from as well.  Unfortunately we were too stuffed to try the desserts, but hopefully next time!  The only thing that someone in our party complained of was the volume level of the music, so I deduct a star for that -- other than that, a great dining experience was had by all!",h8vvO7v710hiGkA05u8N0A,0,0,4,2vBPrssdXZikxRxRNBT_UA

1402040,2018-04-22,0,YH9louUrRpucqk8tuHQeCQ,"An unassuming stellar steakhouse inside the Hard Rock hotel. Wood covered walls, some neo soul sounds and a even handed menu that walks a fine line between steakhouse and seafood with just enough options in between for those that dont eat either. I was surprised to see the Chef making table visits including ours and watching the teamwork among the staff. 

Everything we tried was fantastic and the service was excellent.  The salmon with the fennel crust was juicy, the lamb chops werent overly gamey and they came with this amazing cous cous type of grain. I was surprised to see a steakhouse carry a burger on their menu for dinner and one person in my party ordered it. OMG! The flavors were so well balanced somehow the vinegar soaked tomatoes complimented the hearty burger that was about an inch thick and the smokey slab of bacon.  For $25 i thought it would be a small dainty burger but it was a feast. 

We finished off the meal with their 7 layer carrot cake that was tasty from top to bottom. One thing that sets this place apart is the service: manager visits table, chef says hi, after the server drops off the food they ask ""anything else?"", the server walks you through the menu and doesnt assume youve been there before and lastly they explain whats on the plate. 

id happily recommend them to friends and visitors to Vegas.",4vj_0BQeXjCyNB7ESS5mGg,0,0,5,UgtwBlFarzPeePtsiSeLlg

VERY glad we did! 

We were greeted by beautiful ladies who proceeded to try and set us in the gorgeous dining room...maybe next time! We chose to sit in the bar area and I am glad we did.

The amazing server we had really made the experience a wonderful one. Too bad I am horrrrrible with names and can't remember hers :( 

LL was forced by me to order the Magic Mike specialty cocktail and I ordered a Born and Bred (Channing Tatums vodka) on the rocks with tonic and lime. Her drink was poured skillfully and of course we have a video for proof. It was fun and fruity. The cotton candy was a super fun touch. The Born and Bred was the best potato vodka I have had! I usually request Chopin and now I must find this brand for the home bar.

Cheese bread was brought for LL and we went ahead and ordered two entrees to get the ball rolling. 

A beautiful king crab cake was brought to LL and she said it was delicious!!!! But if i could scream to the top of the mountains...it would be for my entree...

The Vegan Surprise!!!! The vegan surprise turned out to be a vegan risotto with a zillion dollars worth of amazing roasted Matake mushrooms. Pea puree, asparagus and perfectly cooked rice was also presented. 
I had messaged ahead, thank you god for social media, to see if had even been possible and wow this surprise entree did not disappoint.

Brothers Morton you have two new customers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One being a vegan!!!! Who would have thought!!!!!

The reviews on yelp so far are accurate.  It was fabulous.  

I was greeted by a beautiful hostess who knew right away my name and request to sit at the bar (solo dining). Upon arrival to the bar,  Michelle greeted me and like a sixth sense offered me the wine list.  The list was great,  with many offerings from old world to new.  I landed on a beautiful Napa Cab from Long Meadow Ranch, as I knew the Mount Veeder grapes they use would have a perfect tanic accompaniment to a steak.  

They brought out the bread (which was AMAZE) and i ordered a Caesar salad and a bone in filet.  Michelle suggested I get the parmesan crust on my steak and she was sooooo right on.  My salad was simple and perfect.  The steak was to die for.  I love a good bone in filet,  but that crust tho! I finished my meal with an outstanding Sautern paired with the layered carrot cake.  That carrot cake was bomb! I'd go back just for the dessert!

We normally don't do dining experiences on the more ""expensive"" side; however, sometimes we like to treat ourselves.  This experience was A++.

We decided to arrive at about 5:30PM to take advantage of ""social hour"" in the bar area, where many of the drinks were just $9.00.  We were seated at our table just a few minutes before our reservation and we had an excellent time.

MB Steak has a casual, yet elegant decor.  We dressed up; however, I feel you could get away dining at this restaurant a little bit more on the casual side; however, definitely felt in place dressing up.  I loved the colors and style of the restaurant.

We truly felt like valued guests the entire time.  Sadly, I forgot the name of our server.  We had two servers, one who was training another.  The trainee was the primary server and did a great job.  We were constantly being checked on; however, left alone at the appropriate times.  

The food gets four thumbs up!  Wow!  Everything we had was super delicious and cooked the way we wanted it.  We ended up sharing the Diver Sea Scallops with the 18oz Ribeye with Garlic Parm Crust and Shrimp Scampi.  We also shared a side of the Miatake Mushrooms.  Everything just melted in our mouth and we truly thought each dish had its own unique test, unique to that restaurant.  

We were too full for dessert; however, they brought us out a Triple Chocolate Truffle Cake compliments due to us celebrating our anniversary.  Ok, can I say something here??   Don't skip dessert because you are too full.  Take it home.  THIS CAKE WAS AMAZING!

We ordered the Australian Wagyu steak and paired it with the king crab oscar with lobster mac n cheese and potato gratin to share. 

First, was super disappointed that the crab oscar style is on top of the steak, we thought it would be a side style, ruins the favor of a nice steak to do that. The Wagyu, was hands down the WORST we've ever had. It was tough to cut and chew. It didn't have that normal Wagyu marbled flavor / texture. Took one bite and was over it. Lobster mac n cheese, also a disappointment. The pasta was very undercooked and not worth eating. The potato gratin was good and had a nice crispy topping to it. 

The server ended up getting super busy so service after the food came was almost non existent. Seemed more of a staffing issue there.

Our first plate was a regular Caesar salad, which was good. Nothing outstanding to report on it.

However, Larry Hagman was a great guy.  The bartender should be working at Sizzler and not a high-end restaurant with an incredible menu and delicious food.  Unfortunately, he overshadowed the exemplary food and experience.  Shame on us for not simply requesting a different bartender (like the one serving other guests at the other end of the bar.  She was great).  We kept thinking that perhaps he'd metamorphosize into an actual human being.  Didnt happen.  As guests in the hotel for several nights, literally everything else we experienced was awesome at the Hard Rock.  This guy is damaging and toxic.

From the moment we arrived, the Manager and Hostess treated us like royalty. We were shown to our table, but we asked if we could move to another one, just out of personal preference. We were told ""absolutely"" and were promptly moved to the table of our choice.

The ambience was fantastic. The perfect steakhouse. It was modern, quiet, and very relaxing - which is unbelievable, since it's right in the Hard Rock Casino! The lighting and décor was perfect.

The drink and appetizer menu was awesome. My daughter had some sort of drink that was a production - it involved cotton candy in the drink! I had wine, and the selection was exactly what I was looking for - a range from modest to out of sight. The Somm was non-judgmental as I told him that I was going to go cheap and get the least expensive bottle of Shiraz. He told me it was a good choice, and it was!

The shrimp cocktail was the best I have ever had, and I am from Florida and a shrimp snob. The salad was one of the very best ever too.

I had the filet for dinner with asparagus. I don't remember what my daughter had, but it was all great.

The most perfect part of the night was the service. In addition to the Manager, Hostess, and Somm going out of their way to make us feel welcome, we had what must be one of the greatest servers of all time - Fernando. He was perfect from the moment we got there. He checked on us and attended every need or desire, without intruding.

I had a steak at the bar, it was perfectly aged and their mb steak sauce was amazing. I was actually really excited that I found a great new spot.

That was Monday.

I decided to come back today (Wednesday) and there is a large older man behind the bar, I ordered a steak, I think he actually ignored my steak sauce request, and then he put out a fork touching the business end of the fork after playing with the register and touching who knows what else. When I mentioned to him that I would like to cancel the order and that I was grossed out he really didn't care and acted surprised asking me a couple times if I really wanted to cancel the order (btw he put the fork back, maybe you get to taste his hands). This is unsanitary, unprofessional and I could feel newly appropriated vomit wanting to come up my throat. If you, unlike me, would like to taste an old mans dirty hands then mb steak is the spot for you. When you order a steak they give you sea salt, seasoning, some mb steak sauce on the side, but the mystery is what this bartender has touched that will be going into your mouth (I assume a guy who touches the business end of the fork while putting it out probably doesn't care much about washing his hands when going to the bathroom). Enjoy your special mb steak house seasoning! Yummy! (Btw another post on here has a photo of him with two women that says his name is John)",2c5Wq4f76kX6Le5fgz5S0A,2,1,1,KFVbvzSPUu6kkq7nsLWx3Q

From the pedigree that brought us Morton's Steakhouse comes MB Steak.  The brothers, self proclaimed pioneers of the next ""classic"" steakhouse,  and why not, N9NE at the Palms is one of their ventures.  So?

A contemporary steakhouse with a true Vegas vibe whose food is clearly centered around millennial's, all the right hot ingredients seasoned and prepared just a touch different to make them seem apart from daddy's steakhouse.  Jokes on them, as the old becomes retro chic.  Sauces, crusts, and the heavy herb seasoning's of the 1970s are back.

Starters include an excellent charred Spanish octopus. Tender chunks of grilled octopus atop a stewed tomato port wine reduction.  Sweet, acidic, bitter all work to bring out the oceanic flavor..  The foie, solid.  Seared, its fat dripping over a gently sweeten brioche French toast and soaking into macerated strawberries. A Sherry reduction adds the classic nuttiness that rounds out the dish.  The ""bacon and eggs"" thick cut grilled maple bacon, its dripping fat, a pile of frisée, topped off by a soft poached egg. Break the egg, mix it all up, a rich, satisfying warm salad.

The main attractions, the steaks. Offered both wet and dry aged USDA prime, or American, Australian, and Japanese wagyu.  This being a first try, we stuck to the American classics.  In general, the steaks are well trimmed, relatively evenly cooked with a good sear.  One level over temp through the center though the steaks maintained their tenderness and juiciness.  Seasoning is aggressive and peppery.  It works for the thick Tomahawk, flavoring it to its core and complimenting the gentle dry aged funk.  The dry aging is not overpowering.  In comparison, the porterhouse showcases classic American beef flavor.

Note:  will update this review after sampling the signature bone in short rib.

Standard steakhouse sides. Solid Yukon mash, very good maitakes that went well with the dry aged tomahawk.  The standout, the lobster mac & cheese.  Though slightly overcooked, a pile of lobster tail meat atop a very rich mac & cheese.  Heaven.  It works well with the beef, enhancing its natural sweetness.

Correct service but the performance still needs work, opening jitters that should go away with time.

Good wine list.  Typical Vegas resort markup.

A worthy upper mid tier steakhouse.  Solid but IMHO does not break into the Vegas top five.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,34,35,4,P03NNF3uyeWRf5eYI0uWcA

5279258,2017-08-24,3,YH9louUrRpucqk8tuHQeCQ,"When The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino decided to close 35 Steaks + Martinis in favor of a more casual concept to serve their Rehab Pool crowd the move was frustrating, but made sense, and even though the work Marty and Michael were doing there will likely never be replicated by any Steakhouse in Sin City the Casino's newest idea, MB|Steak from the descendents of Morton's proved compelling enough to sit down for Sunday dinner alongside property-wide Executive Chef Bradley Manchester

Located just off the gaming floor, a still-bustling Oyster Bar to one side and recently launched Magic Mike Live on the other, MB|Steak officially opened in mid-May 2017 and described as a concept created by the Morton Brothers to ""bring the best memories of [their] family's history to life"" those dining within its heavily wooded confines will find nearly no detail overlooked, the low ceilings reminiscent of Chicago Steakhouses of the past and the menu veering wide, but not so much that it ever loses its path

Toqued by Patrick Anthony Munster, the St. Louis native who cut his teeth at SW Steakhouse for over a decade moving back to a proper Steakhouse closer to the Strip after a brief stint with Clique Hospitality at Bottiglia, it was with the Chef enjoying a day off that a party of two checked in at the hostess podium before being led past the first of two bars and a staircase that takes guests to an upstairs lounge with living walls and city views, the dining room a bit stark at 5:30 but filling up to about 2/3 capacity by the time a 140 minute feast was completed.

Following a traditional route in offering Appetizers, Steaks, Entrees and Sides, luxury ingredients present in a similar manner to Munster's former digs as first courses, additions to cuts of Beef and toppings to traditional comfort foods, it was with Cocktails and Wine declined that the menu was perused in search of items both classic and distinctive, a plate of housemade Focaccia with caramelized Cheddar similar but surprisingly even better than the Bacon and Cheddar Roll enjoyed at SW less than 24 hours prior

Keeping the volume low and lighting moody, a central chandelier shaped like something one might see in Game of Thrones with spiky projections of black metal and decorative LED bulbs pointed inward or up, it was with greetings from the manager and several familiar faces from 35 Steaks that a lengthy conversation about travel, family and the property's ongoing renovations passed time before first courses arrived, the Caviar ""sliders"" an interesting idea at $7 each with ring-cut Buckwheat circles supporting briny black Eggs, a crisp Potato plus a dollop of Crème Fraiche

Not going too far left of center in the offerings, an elongated plate of Spanish Octopus with Broccolini and Tomatoes slightly tough despite a good char and great flavor, those looking for something more decadent would be well advised to order Chef Munster's Foie Gras that plates quite similar to the one at SW Steakhouse for 25% less, the exterior better caramelized and the portion around an ounce larger

Opting to also make the entrée Risotto a starter, the creamy bowl of rice imbued with Mascarpone cooked as well as any in town with English Peas, Roasted Onions and a half-dozen plump Shrimp, it was with some bites of the dish still lingering that plates were re-set to prepare for main courses, two Steaks, four Sides and a trio of Sauces literally showing the kitchen cooking with fire as both the Rib-Eye and Dry-Aged New York featured a good crust and medium-rare center with the later nearly as robust as Carnevino's version and far more complex than that at Wynn where the exact same 18oz Steak will cost guests $14 extra

Enjoying the Bordelaise the and Peppercorn Sauces plenty, though the house Steak Sauce trends a little too sweet, those who get excited for novel sides will be happy to see MB|Steak has its own take on classics dialed up, the Creamed Spinach with a Poached Egg and stretchy Cheese a reference standard side that tops any tasted in Sin City to date while the Mushroom Grits and Lobster Macaroni and Cheese also justify their cost by way of great flavors and good textures, the Creamed Corn unfortunately a bit too finely ground with the roasted Pepper somewhat overwhelming the generous chunks of Crab

Turning to Hard Rock Pastry Chef Mickey Harden for sweets; everything else including the Bread made on-site as MB|Steak is not officially 'owned' by the Hotel & Casino, it is perhaps a bit surprising that the Morton Brothers decided to go straight-classic for Dessert when Chef Harden has proven quite creative elsewhere, though this small quibble is immediately forgotten when the $16 wedge of New York Style Cheesecake and eight-layer Carrot Cake arrive, each undoubtedly intended to be shared as they are listed ""for two,"" though each are easily amongst the Valley's best and despite their large portions something one may want to peril taking a run at solo",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,5,4,PeQoPO_YCVa4usTYg9FeNQ

An exceptional wine list and enticing cocktail list.  
An exceptional dining experience with delicious meals and personable service.  The bar area is spacious and ideal for an intimate setting for two or a larger group.  The dining area is ideal for both as well. 
My friend is Vegan and they accommodated her with a scrumptious risotto.  We we. For the Magic Mike cocktails- had me at cotton candy!
MB serves mouth-watering appetizers and entrees, oh yes and the sweet ending milkshakes & desserts:)

Place is very loud, but we really enjoyed the environment, if you're looking for an intimate romantic quiet steakhouse this is not it (reminds me of STK at Cosmo). Service is top shelf!!!  For drinks my wife and niece had some type of house special martinis while I had my typical Old Fashioned double. One of the better old fashioned I've had...highly recommend. For appetizers we had the octopus, that's prepared incredible, not too ""rubbery"" on an awesome sauce. Wife and niece had oysters which they both loved. For the main course wife had the Dry Aged NY. She probably only finished half but loved it. I had the 8 oz filet with lobster. It was really good. Still think StripHouse at Planet Hollywood has the bat but this was definitely right up there. My niece had the Salmon and that was prepared very well and was a surprisingly big portion. The girls called it off with carrot cake. Overall this is one of our favorite steakhouses, restaurants and experiences so far.",NhhXoUFYz62otqCsVKuQjg,0,0,5,DTLN520u03IOPy3DhYtdvA

Morton brothers first endeavor together and they nailed it.

Decor was tasteful, great vibe, friendly staff and solid food. Stepped in after an event to have a few bites in the lounge. The menu is your standard steakhouse menu with a few different offerings but nothing to deter you away from trying any of them.

Grilled bacon, crab cakes, octopus and chopped salad is what was ordered along with a few cocktails.

Everything was seasoned perfectly and everything at the proper temperature.  

The meat doesn't differ from any others on or off the strip but originally and hospitality do and they have it",iRuVZPnyeBpPeLBNZNFtjg,3,5,5,ofPSbH-V0blnS74iCN_uyg

We were able to get right in without a reservation.  We shared everything. Octopus was cooked to perfection, tomatoes in the tomato salad were a bit to cold for me but overall dish was good.  Risotto was a bit over cooked & mushy. Dry aged New York was spot on in terms of temperature & flavor. I will have to say the carrot cake was the best I have ever had. I would defiantly recommend this place.",BPRMzqVa2JVhAI0kxKycGQ,0,0,4,r3kIW-hcmjxmYrwTfu8Bbg
