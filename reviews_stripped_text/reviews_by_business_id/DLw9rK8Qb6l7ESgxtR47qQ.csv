50860,2015-06-20,0,DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ,I'm a regular at Ohana Hawaiian BBQ and I absolutely love the food. However my experience with customer service today I don't think my family or I will be ordering from this location anymore. On lunch break I have enough time to order and take my lunch back to work. Thought id treat my family member and order for them to pick up already paid my treat.=) The cashier lady who has been at this location forever gave me so much attitude over it. I asked her if it was a problem having my family pick up their order and I took mine with me.... even explained I didn't have enough time to drop off to them because I'm on my lunch break!! She did not care she gave me even more attitude. Rudely asked me to sign my receipt. Feeling uncomfortable while waiting for my food I could see she was clearly talking about me with the other cashier while the other cashier looked at me and nodded. All I wanted was to treat my Family!!!!!! I shouldn't have to deal with this attitude as we're loyal customers.  Ohana......right. Well they weren't very understanding of the meaning.,MDrsV7SxWp84FcUH9Ux6xA,0,0,1,tR7JTBoCMDMkj428F_RbfA

Omg let me tell you this location has a bad customer service nothing like the greenvalley cashiers. We walked in no hi or hello from the cashier. My bf and I were confused and wasn't sure what to get. The cashier didn't bother to atleast ask us if we need help or have questions. Instead she was just looking at me. When we were leaving no thank you at all. We would never come here. Very bad customer service and cashier is snobby.,O4X7ym5XPDNygO-XyeRCwQ,0,0,1,h4GXRIBaH7gq39lzV2g9uw

Always love the bbq meat especially the short ribs. They were juicy and tendon. The bbq source too was delicious. 
Singapore style noodle and the beef chow fun were as good as some Chinese restaurants that I had in China town.
Chicken katsus was done right. Very crispy outside and juicy inside, of cause, it will taste a lot better with either katsus or curry source. 
Pork belly steam bun was one of my husband's favorites. I like it too! 
Wonton noddle soup is now my favorite. I just realize that I ate the wonton noddle soup 3 times last week. You can choose different kind of noddle but I like the original one. Or just order the wonton soup without noddle as a side. 
Chicken wing was not too special...in my opinion. I can get the same anywhere. 
I have never tried the musubi or boba tea but these are my kid's must have items.

A few friends and my family were planing on a cheap fast but tasty dinner and we ended up here. I have to say that I'm happy we did. I ordered the BBQ combo plate and the overall flavor and portion size deserves 5 stars alone. This place puts L&L to shame with there tender and juicy meat, fresh tasting rice and mac salad. Usually I'm not a fan of mac salad and I killed the huge scoop that was on my plate! Its pretty awesome that you can order some great BBQ and an egg roll in the same place!

So why did I only give this place 3 stars even thought the food was worth 5 stars?? The service was terrible the night we went. I will have to defend them a little since they were pretty busy and the place was hectic inside but that does not excuse the crappy attitudes from the cashiers and people calling for you to get your food. They seemed overwhelmed and stressed out. 

The terrible service will not keep me from going here again as the food is honestly the best Hawaiian food in Vegas. There layout is a little tight when you have a large group of people but all in all I cant wait to have another combo plate!",IzBQ-tzwG2GIPcb-Uo5gVg,1,1,3,14iQqwj1YhnIwCWi53Y7pA

When she repeated my order, the girl said shrimp TEMPURA herself.  Gotta make sure since they've messed up on my orders a hundred times.  My hubby gets there to pick up our order, and sure enough, they give him Fried Shrimp.  She offers to give him 10% for the inconvenience.  More like a very bad miscommunication between the lady who took the order and the cooks.  Fried Shrimp vs. Shrimp Tempura is a big difference to me.  They should have offered to make the tempura and gave it for free.  10% off is an insult after numerous mistakes.",WJHrOyKtIetEpso8cuvFRA,0,0,1,SnXK_9Q0GwpxS0iT5YR52Q

The BoGo coupon at a new dining spot allows me to try two new things and as in this case with Ohana, saves me from making a single ""bad"" choice. Yay! 

I've never been to Hawaii so the concept of Hawaiian food and Hawaiian BBQ is somewhat new to me. I've been to Roy's and I have a Sam Choy cook book where I experiment with recipes, and I've thrown a luau with food from those recipes and gotten rave reviews of my skills.... but I've never eaten at a Hawaiian BBQ joint before. 

My first question to the girl behind the counter is, ""what is your favorite menu items, and what do most people order?"" She gave me two recommendation and that is what I ordered. I had the BBQ Mix and a new menu item, Garlic Noodles. I loaded up on BBQ sauce and headed home to eat while enjoying a chick flick on the couch. 

First up: Garlic Noodles. Honest opinion is to pass on this one. They were dry, sticky and besides the obvious garlic, lacked flavor. I love garlicky foods where you can ""feel"" the garlic, but this had a cheap, powdered garlic aftertaste. No bueno. Few bites and I quickly moved on. 

BBQ Mix: WOW! Lots of meat! Two decent scoops of rice and the ""Hawaiian Vegetable"" (per one Yelper's review) of Macaroni Salad. The rice was cooked well, and the Mac Salad was very tasty! The meat was full of flavor and not lacking in the quantity department.

The service is spot on every time and the food has yet to disappoint. Their menu can be intimidating at first, but it just makes you want to try more things the next time you go. There has also never been a moment when this place was empty of customers, which I have always considered to be a very good sign. Although the menu is vast and they have so many options that are clearly NOT Hawaiian, they were smart enough to clearly label on the board which items are the ""Hawaiian bbq"" dishes.

Ohana has two dining options: you can go to the counter (the girls are wonderful and very friendly) to order and sit down or take-out, OR you can go to the other side of the restaurant and sit down for table service.

There are plenty of tables and seatings on both sides of the room.

The menu is quite extensive. They offer a selection of rice dish, BBQ combo, burger, sandwich, masubi, all kinds of meat, and noodle dish. There is a picturesque wall of food to help with decision-making and to alleviate some of the pressure from guessing what your meal will look like.

This meal comes with a nice, spicy curry flavor and is serve with thin rice vermicelli noodles stir fry with onions, green bell pepper, slice carrots, bean sprouts, scramble egg, chop scallions, and generous portion of tender chicken which taste so soft it just melts in your mouth.

I forgot to get my drink and John had filled my cup and personally brought it to my table, which I feel is the nicest gesture. You can tell there is a lot of love and dedication by how people treat you. The service is very much family-oriented and the moment you place an order, the staff is attentive and ready to make your meal with fresh quality ingredients. On top of my order, I had the Malasadas ($5.50) for dessert and this is a simple treat that I am familiar with in my culture. Malasadas is a deep-fried, round and puffy doughnut that is rolled and coated in granulated sugar. It is the good kind of sweet that you can most certainly share and enjoy in bounty with others.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,0,0,5,zxScpfNM1or9J4T45iWOtA

some of my favorites include; Minute Chicken with Cake Noodle, crispy Gau Gee, Chicken Katsu, of course the spam musubi, kalbi, the pho is even pretty good!

One side is a walk up window where you can order to go, and then the noodles are served on the other side which is a sit down atmosphere.

Called in an order for pick up as it's cold/windy/rainy outside and just wanted some good eats at home.  Ordered a Chicken Katsu/Kal Bi combo and their Salt/Pepper Pork Chop (they've got an extended Chinese menu added to their ""Hawaiian"" menu).

Finally got home and opened our plates to see HAIR right next to the Chicken Katsu.  I was not about to drive back, wait for another plate to get cooked, then drive back home to eat, (not to mention my other plate getting cold while I go out and do all of this) so I figured just call and they could credit my card back or give me another replacement plate another day.  

Their response:
1- come back on the same day and they will make me another plate
OR
2- come back another day for a 10% discount

REALLY?  
If I don't want to drive back the same day for YOUR mistake ALL you're going to do for me and my plate of food with HAIR is to give me a 10% discount on whatever I decide to spend more of my money on for an additional plate?  So I lose my money on my first plate for apparent reasons, then I CAN spend another $8-$9 minus 10%??  Horrible customer service and bad judgement on managements part.

P.S.
I tried their ""Salt and Pepper Pork Chops"" and they should more accurately call it Salt and Pepper Batter Balls with slivers of pork and bones.  There were about 3 pieces that tasted like actual pork chops and the rest of it were balls of deep fried batter with little bitty bones.  I've had this dish at numerous chinese restaurants around Las Vegas like Joyful House who nail it, sadly Ohana missed the mark on this dish.  I'd hate to taste their General Tso's chicken/Orange chicken dishes with the same batter balls and bitty pieces of meat...never on my penny.

Needless to say they can take that 10% discount (what a joke for having HAIR in their dish) and give it to someone else, I'm never going back.

Go to L&L Barbeque, Island Sushi, Rice Trax, or Island Flavor for good Hawaiian Style plate lunches.  If you want chinese go someplace in Chinatown (Asian BBQ & Noodles, Joyful House), Hawaiian Chinese style at Diamond China or Wo Fat.

Since then they have renovated and there is now a Noodle menu and extra seating. I'm pretty consistent when ordering I know what I like so I tend to go on the safe side to make sure I don't end up disappointed. 

Ordered my combination pan fried noodles, the kids got their chicken katsu and some manapua's. I don't know if they use different ingredients or if it's the cooks but everything tastes off and honesty I would give 2 stars for the food but since I have had better experiences I know that they are capable of making decent food I'll give them 3 stars. 

The noodles just didn't taste right the sauce seemed extra watery with no flavor. The katsu was soggy not crispy and the gravy was overly salty. Nothing amazing about their service but it wasn't bad. They asked if our table was clean enough and if we wanted them to clean it again. The place was dirty food all over the floor but then again it was about a hour before closing so I'm sure they had a dinner rush.

We came for the Soup Dumplings especially.  Joe Shanghai's in NYC is the standard to which I hold all soup dumplings.  ""These tender pouches, ""little dumplings"", are freshly made to order. They arrive at the table in piping hot bamboo steamers. Each plump dumpling contains a little pork meatball surrounded by a delightful meaty broth.""

If you have not had soup dumplings, it's almost like dumpling pot stickers, that have hot broth inside that you drink as soon as you bite into the dumpling.  

I hope they owners read this and try to improve on their version of the soup dumpling.   They price was cheap for 10 dumplings and they served it in a silver dish but I had to ask for a soup spoon (the best way to eat it).

My wife and I found that it was random where maybe  only 1/2 of the dumplings had a substantial amount of broth.   It might be the outer layer not being thick enough to hold the soup or idk.   It was just a little disappointing to bite into a few and not get anything out of it.  The broth itself was decent at best.    The dumpling meat was also just okay.   Steal Fat Dumplings recipe, throw in some soup.... I will come back and tell everyone to come too!

We also ordered a shrimp eggroll appetizer which was good and a pan fried noodle dish which was delicious and a great portion.   

There's not many options for xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in Vegas so I'll give this one another try sometime until I find something near comparable to those in NYC.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,0,0,4,X2-6Os5lQlMCUYgOxfpqIQ

My wife's kalua pig had a nice smoky aroma. It was very tender and mixed with lots of cabbage. It was not dry at all and the juices mixed well with the rice.

I didn't particularly enjoy the spring roll only because it wasn't what I was expecting. The wrap was crispy and not too oily. The filling was a mixture of carrot, cabbage, and corn starch noodles. Perfect for speaking up the doping sauce but bland without it.

  They have a pretty good menu, the selections are not as grand as other Hawaiian BBQ joints, but everything they do offer is on point!  
  I swear this place is evil.  If someone dares to mention it at work, a post it note with 3 people's order of choice turns into a whole sheet of paper with side notes (i.e. ""Katsu well-done please"").  

  Today I went with the Katsu Curry, but I have tried everything on the menu from Garlic Shrimp to their Saimen.  The Katsu Curry is pretty amazing.  The Curry sauce comes on the side so it doesn't leave my Chicken Katsu extra soggy.   I got a mini portion (there's also a regular portion) and there was plenty of food for 2 sittings.  If you work nearby or are shopping at the Target and in the mood for some local food, check this place out.

Pros:
 *  They deliver (within reason)
 *  Huge portions.  (you can seriously split the regular sized plates)
 * Hawaiian Sun (this is a must... Lilikoi Passion... Mmmm!
 * Self Serve pop
 * Lunch specials for the price of the mini plates  ($4.95!)
 * Grilled Salmon  !!!!!
 * Loco Moco !!!!!
Cons:
 * I'm not really fond of their Mac Salad. 
 * Saimen @ Ohana's is a bit bland for me
 * Food is good, but sometimes its an overkill with their sauce.
 * No Mochiko Chicken 

Tips:
 * Try their Grilled Salmon plate!
 * Order the sauce on the side.
 * They also have burger/fries.  I'm just saying.
 * Try to avoid dining in during lunch hours.  It is hectic!
 * If you work nearby, have them fax you a menu!

Overall, I'd have to say I'm definitely a fan of this place.  How can I not be? Cheap eats, quick service, and man vs. food portions.  I'm in !",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,4,4,4,uznUUKvGHrnzkzzLmVnvIQ

Nothing fancy here, just straight up Hawaiian styled food. I've been trying to eat less carbs lately and I figured maybe a giant plate of meat would be fine for lunch.

I ordered the BBQ Mix plate with chicken, short ribs, and BBQ beef. This massive BBQ plate is a great lunch fix and for anyone who needs that premium protein boost. The chicken was very tender and plentiful and the BBQ beef was perfect! I could have eaten the entire cow if it came prepared like this.

The Short Rib on the other had almost no meat on it at all. I know short ribs don't normally have a ton meat on them, but usually there's a little to nibble on. This small set back didn't ruin my lunch, I mean; I still had three pounds of chicken and BBQ beef to eat. 

As a wild card option I ordered the Chicken Katsu Musubi. This was very interesting, but also very good. The crunchy katsu chicken with the soft sticky rice was a great combo. They have multiple musubi options including the classic spam musubi, just incase katsu chicken isn't your thing. 

With my sodium levels through the roof and my belly full, I would say that this was lunchtime victory. Would I come back? - Duh

Most of the time things are great, then other times, my food will be cooked and served completely differently than before or things will be left out of my to go order. I've had the salt and pepper shrimp on several occasions and it's come cooked pan fried a few times (which is great) and then deep fried in a tempura type batter with a completely different taste other times (which is absolutely awful.) I've ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry bowl several times and it has always been served to me with the curry on the side in a separate bowl, until today which leads me to the purpose of my review. Today I received the bowl with just a little bit of curry already on top of the chicken. It was nowhere near the amount  that comes in the bowl served on the side that I usually get. The chicken was on top of dry potatoes, dry carrots and dry rice. After a few AWESOME bites it was clear that the rest of the bowl was going to need more curry. I asked one of the girls at the front if I could get just a little bit more for the rest of the dish. She pulled up the information on the register and told me that it would be an additional $0.50. I was shocked  considering I was only asking for a little bit more and felt that I had been shorted to begin with.  So I dug around in my bag to see if I had any change and I didn't. I told her I was completely willing to pay the $0.50 except that they had a $10 minimum on cards. Her response was a very sweet smile and an ""Oh, sorry."" With no other options, I went back to my table, took a few more bites and had to throw the rest away.

For the quality and taste of their food, I would give them 4 stars-- when they get it right of course. I really do like the food and the place is always busy. It's just that there is no guarantee that I'll get the same thing.

For all of the inconsistencies, I would give them 1 star.

For refusing to give me 2 tablespoons of curry because I could not meet the $10 minimum purchase requirement, I give them a hardcore 0 stars and a firm statement that they have lost my business FOREVER.

The rice was good.  However, the chicken was not.  My stomach has been doing cartwheels all night.  I even found a piece in there that was not cooked all the way through and had to throw it out (undercooked chicken can be toxic).  The rest of the chicken really had no flavor to speak of.  I thought it was very bland.  Most of my co-workers were unimpressed as well.  Not to mention, they were very slow at getting our order prepared and nothing was labeled when we got it back to work.  The Malasadas were good, but the ones I had before had a nice tropical cream inside of them.  These had no filling.  However, they were fine and probably the only thing I would order from them again.  I was truly unimpressed.

I got a seafood and kalbi combination. The shrimp was heavily breaded, dry and flavorless. The mahi was okay. The kalbi was the worst I've ever had to the point of being nearly inedible.
Altogether one of my worst restaurant experiences, ever.
Blech!
I don't understand the good reviews, at all.

All I can say is...if you wanna try this place, go on a Sunday.  Yep, a Sunday because they usually have 3 specials going on!  Their current specials are regular plates of Chicken Katsu or BBQ Chicken for $5.25 (or $5.50 can't recall), and BBQ Salmon for $5.95.  It's all good for Hawaiian fast food!  Each regular plate comes with (of course) 2 scoops of white rice (yay Calrose) and 1 scoop of macaroni salad (in Hawaii that's considered your 'veggie').  They don't skimp either!  Chicken Katsu comes with about 3 big rows of chicken, and the BBQ chicken comes with about 3-4 large marinated charbroiled thighs.  More than enough food to share between 2 people...or one BIG KANAKA!  Food quality is good, dishes are ONO!  Almost as good as back home in Hawaii.

This Ohana BBQ is much cleaner and nicer than the one on Durango.  The people are more pleasant at this location too.  Menu is considered typical Hawaiian take-out (but sure, they have tables for eating in)...everything is packed in styrofoam containers whether you eat in the restaurant or not.  Their plate lunches have a great variation with lots of pork, beef, seafood, and chicken dishes to choose from.  Favorites such as Kalua Pig, Lau Lau, Loco Moco, Kalbi Shortribs, Mahi Mahi, and Chicken Katsu Curry are all on the menu.  Even better is the pricing...all regular plate lunches are no more than $9, most between the $6-$8 range.  And all da food is edible!  ONO!  Go figah!  Kalbi not as good as my Mom's but that's another story.  Pretty close to authentic Hawaiian fast food...so I won't knock on the Chinese guy (really from China...guy don't know English or Pidgin) that is cooking in the back.  You keep cookin' without that wok Bruddah!

Besides plate lunches you also have burgers and sandwiches, such as a cheeseburger or Mahi Mahi sandwich.  You can combo these up with fries and a drink for under $6.  They also do other Hawaii specialties like Saimin and Spam Musubi (everyone's favorite!), and even Malasadas too!  This location also serves boba drinks on the cheap and Hawaiian Sun drinks as well.  So you Hawaii transplants can stock up lil' bit on the Hawaii goodies if you need to at the last minute. 

Solid 4 stars for me here, not quite as good as home...but miles better than the L&L's we have here in Las Vegas.  The decor is a bit kitchy (stuff you wouldn't see in an actual Hawaii joint) but I'm not gonna take off points for that.  The food is where it matters most.  Not too much frills, but this place will fill your tummy up good.  And the owners next door of the Quizno's?  They from Maui!  No joke!  They eat at Ohana Hawaiian BBQ all the time.

One cool thing that they have is a daily lunch special that's about $5. I tried my friend's teriyaki salmon and it was quite ""onolicious""-- cooked and seasoned quite well. I got a mixed chicken and beef teriyaki plate. The mac salad and the beef was bomb. The chicken however was a bit dry and not so flavorful. The portions were generous.

The last time I was here, I got their Salmon with rice which I thought was one of the best Salmons one can get, especially at a Hawaiian restaurant.  On my most recent visit, I opted for their Katsu Mini and a Katsu Masubi.  I really wanted a Loco Moco, but cut off red meat for Lent. First of all, let's talk price and portions.  Price is probably one of the cheapest out there and the portions are huge.  My Katsu Mini looked as big as a regular.  My only issue is that it was missing some taste.  From the rice, the macaroni, and to the Katsu, taste was lacking and it was super bland. My Katsu Masubi was also missing taste. If this restaurant was in SoCal, it may be considered really good stuff.  But with the amount of Hawaiian restaurants out here in Las Vegas, I would say Ohana is just okay.  

My co-worker had lunch with me.  He never eats anything outside of Pizza, Burgers, BBQ, etc.  In other words, he doesn't eat outside the box.  For the first time, I actually witnessed someone order a Cheeseburger at a Hawaiian restaurant. Hilarious stuff and he thought it was just okay, nothing special.  

On a side note, this restaurant also carries Chinese Food.  You can get what looks like Orange Chicken here and noodles.  Really??  Couple of things I do like about this restaurant is the details and pictures of their food. Almost every item that you can order has pictures represented. 

Overall, I really don't see myself driving out of my way to come here. The location is far from the usual areas I'm in anyway.  However, I still remember how good their Salmon was.  Maybe my next trip is just for that.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,10,10,3,HNj3sxIkzqr4LoEKAHCc7A

But katsu is different. It is so supurbly crispy and tender. And the katsu I had at Ohana was phenominal. The sauce was good. It was not the normal American style BBQ sauce I get with katsu from other places.  It was more thin and tangy. Like a mustard and vinegar based sauce.  

I got a regular sized lunch plate of katsu with the customary two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. FYI, Hawaiian style macaroni salad is my favorite style. When I received my order I was shocked at how much katsu was in the box. I almost didn't need the side order of Spam musubi. I took much of my katsu and a scoop of rice home for dinner. I did eat the musubi and macaroni salad. In regards to the musubi, it was good. The nori wrap was tender and easy to bite through. The Spam was a normal sized serving. The rice was perfectly sticky. If there is just one complaint I have, there was not enough sauce. I like a lot of teriyaki on my musubi.

- Spam Misubi - pretty good - an oblong ""roll"" with a layer of rice and a thick cut of spam wrapped with nori and then fried on all sides.  It has a sweet sauce in between the rice and spam.
- Fried Shrimp Saimin, Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Saimin and Spam Saimin - 3 variations of saimin and quite delicious and very cheap!
- Pork Lau Lau & Kalua Combo - a little pricey but oh so good!  It comes with Kalua pork like smoked pulled pork cooked with shredded pieces of cabbage.  Pork Lau Lau is the best thing Hawaiian thing I've ever eaten!  The pork is wrapped with taro leaves and then wrapped again with banana leaves and then steamed.  Delicious and tender.  Tastes really great with Siracha hot sauce.   We will be back for more Lau Lau!  The combo also comes with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad.  Big enough for 2-3 people.  Serious.  
- Soup Dumplings - 8 dumplings heated in a silver dim sum dish.  Comes with vinegar and thinly sliced ginger.

There are 2 sides to the restaurant - a dine-in side with wait staff and a fast food side where you go up and order the food.   We opted for the dine-in side.  The menu contains Hawaiian, Chinese, American, and Korean.",EsOu51dW3UTDJTApBxwz2g,1,1,4,zCI32H9Hnqja5CcYRt92mg

Seriously, you name it, they got it.  Yes, Thai iced tea if you please.  That's what you call a melting pot!

A few of us went together, so we were able to sample a variety of items on the menu.

Fried calamari - Seasoned and fried perfectly.   My husband almost ate half the plate himself.

BBQ chicken - Marinated with sweet shoyu and the meat was very tender.

Garlic shrimp - Not your ordinary little shrimps.  This is the whole shrimp with shells, so you must suck on the shell to get all that garlic goodness.

Fried pork chop - Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender inside.  

Chow funn - Good and tasty.  Best of all, the noodles don't stick together like other restaurants.

House crispy noodle - This is a must try!  As you get a generous portion of stirred fried chicken and vegetables on top yummy crispy noodles.

Drinks are: soda- free refills BTW, canned Hawaiian drinks, boba drinks, thai iced tea- 2 sizes- 16 oz./24 oz. Also has teriyaki bowls and gyoza on the menu. No haupia.  

You order at the counter, pay, and get your drinks. Select seating. The cashier (she was very nice BTW) will bring your food over to your table. If you are sharing, you can request disposable plates.

Entertainment coupon participant. We got three regular pacs (chicken katsu, kalua pork, and BBQ chicken), two thai iced tea's, and one drink for a little over $21.00, using the BOGO coupon. The three of us (my MIL) still had leftovers- which means big portions. Everything was very good. The chicken katsu featured white meat- nice surprise (L & L uses dark meat). The BBQ chicken had very little fat. The pork was seasoned just right. The thai iced tea was really good- I don't get it a lot so it's a real treat when I have it. We will definitely come here again.   

The decor was actually not what I thought it would be- very colorful and surprisingly very nice. There were 2 booths, the rest of the seating is tables and chairs,and  a couple bar tables- all are in brown and green (love those colors). Along the menu wall are giant hibiscus flowers- always reminds me of Hawaii. One side has a flat screen tv. It was clean and the cashier would clean the tables right away.    

There were many customers and lots of takeout orders- a very good sign. There are two other locations besides this one. Located in a strip mall, lots of shopping opportunities here- Kohls, Ross, Target, Dollar Tree. We spent four hours at this center once.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,4,DcWenMXfaWqjEEsq7YF9iw

So, there's two sides of this location. The left is for dine-in service and on the right, you order at the counter and you can dine in if you want. The right side is solely takeout containers. I've only experienced the left side; it's nice to eat out of real bowls/plates, but the service is always spotty.

My return visits were prompted by my mom's desire to find the same ""Crispy Gau Gee Mein"" with cake noodles that I love from Hawaii. Their Pan-Fried Crispy Noodles are pretty similar and was the only dish I enjoyed from my initial visit, so I told her that it may satisfy her craving. Fortunately, she does like it! Our most recent visit, we didn't order the Crispy Gau Gee, but enjoyed the noodles very much! The dish does tend to be salty, but it wasn't as bad the second time. We also tried the Wanton Noodle Soup the previous visit and it wasn't very good.

Since I haven't had much luck with the ""Noodles"" and ""Chinese"" menus, I focused on the Hawaiian menu like their other locations.

Garlic Noodles ($5.95): This dish is udon noodles sautéed/pan-fried with copious amounts of garlic. Delicious! I really enjoy these noodles and they go great with the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken.

Combo Plate ($10.25): Kalua Pork with Cabbage and Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. This comes with your standard two scoops of white rice (no brown rice available) and one scoop of macaroni salad. I like their Kalua Pork because it's tender and had the right amount of salt. I usually don't order Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, so I was really surprised how great it tasted! They do it really, really well.

Service is spotty. Everyone is really nice, but they tend to forget about you and you have to hunt someone down for water refills, etc.

If I were to rate this place relative to other Hawaiian spots in Las Vegas I would say it's better than L&L bbq and doesn't quite reach the standards of Aloha kitchen.  I'll review a couple dishes that I get on the regular:

BBQ Beef Bowl:  Awesome bang for your buck.  At $4.95 you get a fist full portion of teriyaki beef on top of steamed veggies and rice.  I have a pretty big appetite and this dish always leaves me satisfied.

Chicken Katsu:  The chicken katsu is right on par.  They use all white chicken.  If you like a little dark meat in your katsu you may get sick off all the white meat.  The katsu sauce is just right.  Not to different than most places which I like.  Really can't go wrong.

BBQ Beef Plate:  The bbq beef plate was just okay.  BBQ Chicken....good, BBQ Beef....good, Kalbi Beef...not so good.  I think what really killed this plate was the Kalbi.  How do you make Kalbi wrong?!  Well, if you don't marinade it long enough and the Kalbi doesn't taste like, well...Kalib!

So, anyhow, Hawaiian food is like a staple to my diet as well as a great way to maintain my high cholesterol.  If you are in the area it's a great place to stop by and pick up food or have dinner with the family.  However, It's not really a place you would go out of your way for.

The Husband ordered the Chicken Katsu and Kalbi Short Ribs Combo, while I ordered the Pork Lau Lau  Their two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad is an embarrassment to Hawaiian food.  When I opened my box, I thought they were kidding.  What's up with the small scoops?  Definitely disappointing on that part alone.

The short ribs tastes okay, but my pork was super dry.  There were minimal fatty pieces, and everyone knows a good lau lau should have some decent amount of fatty pieces! 

Service can be improved here.  The only girl working was outside socializing with some guys.  I needed more napkins and since they are behind the counter, I had to go outside to request more.  It seemed like I was bothering her.

I would have to say that this place has its ""on"" days and it also has their ""off"" days.  Sometimes it's like wow that was amazing.. others its like dammit, why did we go here today.

- BBQ Mix Plate:  Plenty of meat for the price and enough for two people to share.
- Loco Moco:  Their patties and gravy are pretty good - does the job if your craving.
- Chicken/Beef Teriyakis:  Nice flavors in the teriyaki, meat is usually pretty most.
- Spam and Eggs:  Can't never mess this up!

Stay away from:
Saimin:  Way too salty for my taste.
Mac Salad:  I know this comes as a side for most combos, but I'm not a fan of the bland.

Now, unlike L&L where they lay one layer of chicken on a puffy bed of cabbage, at Ohana they lay one layer of chicken on a puffy bed of ........Chicken.  The quality was awesome, the quantity was awesome and the price was impressively low.

When Hawaiian Hale closed down, I was deeply saddened to learn that the most authentic place I know would disappear.  Later I was relieved to discover Rice Trax, Island Style and best of all, Island Flavor.  I have yet to try out Kauai Grill.

The best part about Ohana's is their convenience due to their proximity to the home, and especially the gym (walking distance).  You can't go wrong with the barbeque chicken and the Hawaiian plates are pretty generous.  Lately, the dishes have been getting skimpy these days and now they have been incorporating a grip of Chinese dishes and believe the owners are most likey...Chinese.  

One thing to be aware of is that if you are used to traditional Japanese curry, just know that the katsu curry incorporates more of a coconut based ""thai-style"" curry, not my favorite.  But their BBQ chicken is always a hit and the fish dishes ain't half bad.  I do like their mac salad, probably because its creamy and heavy with the mayo.  I am not a fan of dryer mac salad types.

Mixing and matching is pretty flexible as well and if you need a quick lau lau or kalua pork fix, this place can curb your craving without having to go hella far.  I do wish they had some deserts, but its pretty decent for what they got.  Loco moco and hamburger steak is handmade and not frozen patty's, which is a plus.

So if you are in the mood, this place is convenient and fast.  Staff is friendly and accommodating as well.  I don't know of any signature dishes, but its overall a good place.

Sad because the food is pretty good just didn't like this and may not go back.,vSnYdIYsF6SJ7mHS9ESSjQ,0,0,3,65L6CYbp3YqI0MV8N_mgYQ

After picking up my phone order, we found the order to be incorrect. We ordered a mini Katsu Curry, side of fries, and a BBQ mixed plate. We found that the mini plate did not have rice or Mac salad. Keep in mind that the inconvenienced  driving again to pick up simple rice and Mac salad is frustrating enough. When calling to correct the order, I explained this to the woman over the phone, but nothing else was offered other than driving again to pick up rice and Mac salad.  I'll pass at this place if ever I am wanting Hawaiian food again..",BN-hf4cTiPwbM4kjRYIzyg,2,0,1,A9C_sSa25Y_ROq50cfAysQ
5757977,2018-01-27,0,DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ,Kind of annoyed.. I asked to pay more to upcharge to fried rice with Mongolian beef and would not accommodate. She said there's no substitute bu  I wanted to pay more for it and she wouldn't do it. I just left because I wasn't going to argue with something so stupid. I think that if someone will pay extra for something or pay for a side you should do it. I'm a manager at a restaurant and that's not good business,q_USfyQ11AKAA-wFryKjaw,0,0,1,emCUFivM9XQz2l8_1U3LlQ

The wonton soup was also bland. The Spicy Wonton was disgusting. When you spend $30 you expect good food..instead it we got trash. I  can't believe people actually think this place is legit. We ended up throwing the food away in the trash, because that's what it was, trash. Never again!",FEJP5TWedLvux5d3GfyYng,0,0,1,wCPljyFgyA0uvXVQpWEs2w
5796084,2015-10-16,0,DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ,"One of my go to spots on my side of the town for the past 4 years. Very quick and very easy to order because most of the items I've tried here are delicious!  

The staff are usually friendly and very welcoming no matter how busy they are. The restaurant is spacious even when it's peak hours. 

Every time I go here, I usually order my usual unless I want to try something different since they have a lot of pictures and items posted on their walls. What's my usual? Chicken katsu curry and salt and pepper pork chop. Usually when I go here I order the mini and I still can't finish it. But a regular is usually good to share with someone so you can try different things. Keep in mind, their portions are decent. Usually good to share family style. 

Their chicken katsu curry is to die for. Always yummy and never a disappointment. Chicken katsu is always warm and crispy and instead of katsu sauce, it's curry sauce.  I love the curry sauce so much that I order extra sauce on the side hahaha. What can I say, I love curry! Oh it it comes with mac salad and a side of rice. Their salt and pepper pork chop has a lot of meat on it every time I get it, barely any bones which is ALWAYS a good think. Good amount of salt on it as well. 

This will always be my go to spot for Hawaiian on my side of the town or whenever I'm craving that awesome chicken katsu curry. Oh, and also a side of guava juice too. Never had a disappointment which is why I rate it a 5 for the past years I've been here.",YN_wyoau6tTyLeF_ZHIB2Q,3,1,5,CL2qEHEKhc1VKf_xPqENdQ

They have many selections to choose from the famous loco moco to salt and pepper shrimp and more. Big food portions with great taste. Nice and clean place to eat. Cooks are very good at producing great tasting island food and chinese food, best of both worlds. Good eats for good prices.",29DWe8SD_RCeZ_A6ihxnhQ,4,5,5,Q9RStlA8CT5qfTUM3Btaqw
5835905,2018-06-20,0,DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ,I think I just had the best lunch I can remember in a long time.  If you sit in the dine in section which is the left door you get a bigger menu with Pho and Oxtail Soup.  The right side door is the usual take out Ohana BBQ.  Today I had the grilled pork belly with radish sprouts awesome sauce and folded rolls it's in the appetizer section but was filling for one person.  The plate presentation was really nice didn't expect that at all.  The service was friendly and they work the room together to make sure the experience is excellent.  They feature 8 different types of noodles.  Thanks,b3tK3CkLOfrWpSuvn9Yo1g,0,0,5,Ibcm2SYTGLXt2-Thwe6nyg

The katsu sauce was super watery but full of flavor. My only real complaint is the container for the regular sized food does not have compartments so when I got home the rice, chicken and Mac salad had all mixed together. Luckily I like it like that.",3wCBZB2UarPi5U50c0hRWQ,0,0,4,TOH20zfCTzRsirYbLJqp7A
5876878,2013-08-04,2,DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ,"Egh...maybe double egh...my GF suggested this place and she arrived a good twenty minutes before I did and was better prepared to place an order. I'm guessing that's why her meal was better than mine although not by much. Enough chit chat let me get to it.

My GF was upset I was 20 minutes late. So I didn't spend too long studying the menu. I saw seafood combo and ordered that without reading everything was battered and fried. In fact there was more batter on my seafood than seafood itself. So disappointing... As I was sitting there being read the riot act for being late I saw a second menu board with more options to choose from. 

When you walk in look right as it appears the good food/typical Asian fare is listed over there and you want to make a fully educated choice.

The girlfriend ordered a BBQ chicken dish. It had good flavor and portion size. She was kind enough to share a bite or two with me when she realized mine was all batter/ breading. 

They have seating for about 15 or 20 people but I think they really don't want you to stay. We ordered at the counter, said we were going to stay and had a seat. Our meals came out in ten minutes served to us in Styrofoam take out containers with plastic forks? No plates or silverware...definitely not a good first impression that was followed up by an equally poor 2nd impression when my seafood combo came out with 75% bread.

I wasn't expecting the Ritz going into a restaurant located in a strip mall but was still sorely disappointed with their food, their service, and overall ambiance. 

The GF said their was no way we'd be back and I'd have to agree.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,3,2,2,X7Kfv3xTXdFxt7h6bBymxQ

The pricing is great and the food is awesome. I can say that I might have eaten everything on the menu at least once.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,4,4,4,ZNYqKSH3NYcPNuQJ-X19UA
5946547,2016-06-08,0,DLw9rK8Qb6l7ESgxtR47qQ,I love the Lau-Lau and the Garlic shrimp noodles. The BBQ combo plate is well recommended if you like BBQ Hawaiian style. Price is reasonable and the serving is Kamaina generous. I like that they have Hawaiian soda available to make your Hawaiian meal authentic. Oh the Malasada is a must have. Staff are friendly with a flair of Hawaiian hospitality.,O38E6KW3oiUD9VxHNziakg,1,0,4,9CVHR4PWZKe6LL_NvYATTg
