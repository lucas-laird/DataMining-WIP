1540342,2018-04-30,1,_-o4WsGS2yhFneiuMTNdSA,"Let me tell you about Monti's Smokehouse BBQ. More specifically, let me tell you about this salad they made me. I know what you're thinking... ""Seriously? Salad at a BBQ place?"". You'd be right to think that, but I'm trying to be less of a fat bastard. It's going *OKAY*.

Alright, back to the salad. Arugula, pickled stuff (I'm not exactly sober while trying to type this), feta cheese, and most importantly smoked meat. Real talk; I've eaten a lot of BBQ in my day (see: fat bastard) and I can tell you that Monti's is up there on a whole other level.

Kelcie and Ryan were running the truck and couldn't have been more personable and hilarious! They even threw in some homemade guacamole and chips(my co workers are demolishing it as I type).  The smoke flavor on the pork was about as good as it can get.  They have a variety of tasty sandwiches, even vegan options.

Fantastic!  BBQ trucks are my weakness.  I ordered the bomb Mac'n'cheese and added some pulled pork.  I could have dropped 3 of these down in one shot, it was SO good.  The meat was soft and tender, the cheese not overdone, a good breadcrumb crust covering the cheeses pasta shells, and a damn good bbq sauce.

The people were awesome, the food was fantastic, and for any fan of Lebowski, it's the coolest truck you've ever seen!

It's barbecue, dude!",aPllvDKmOLYe4M2eTHAtMw,1,0,5,74n3lFYV7ddqx0e91YfAqQ

I highly recommend the hot link sandwich or the Tupoc loaded fries. The prices are very reasonable for the size of the portions and the quality of the food. The owners are also extremely nice, and bend over backwards to make sure customers are happy. Also, the homemade pickles are very delicious, and highly recommended.

Gave a suggestion about serving mac and cheese and they totally made the change. (They were using paper and i suggested something else so we could enjoy all of the cheesy goodness! Now they use foil and its much better!) Glad to know that suggestions of patrons are taken seriously.,Fs9RNXVxUtrccpkyD78ruQ,1,0,5,LMVZWj9casXUHYcfE-aVGA

2856276,2018-02-16,0,_-o4WsGS2yhFneiuMTNdSA,"This truck is absolutely amazing and the owners are extremely nice. They make nearly everything from scratch all the way down to the sauces and even the pickles! I myself am a pickle snob and theirs made me want more. They use ""Grandma B's"" recipe and whoever that is kudos to you! In addition to that they contribute 25% of pickle sales to Second Chance Animal Rescue. Being an animal lover makes me like them even more. Plus the truck is named after one of their animals and all of the items are too!  When you find them get either the Lucy Sandwich: tri-tip, Swiss cheese, pickled red onions, arugula and chimichurri on some delicious baguette. 
Or
The Monti Cubano: pulled pork, pork loin, grandmas pickles, Swiss cheese, mustard and once again that delicious baguette. Except this one is a pressed the sandwich.

3834695,2018-01-29,0,_-o4WsGS2yhFneiuMTNdSA,"First of all the menu visually is just so appealing you need time to read through and visualize each item. Come hungry because your gonna wanna try more than one entree like me! Ha I decided on the Fritz which is a truck made hot link, Texas toast, pickles, mustard, and perfect amount of barbecue sauce . And this barbecue sauce is really something it's smooth and yet has that subtlety of sweet but spicy in perfect balance. The link will not disappoint but is so flavorful and juicy and smoked perfect. The Texas toast was grilled perfect and I just couldn't believe every bite was the perfect bite literally. Definitely recommend this . Next I tried the loaded fries they have two options the Tupac and the Biggie even tho normally I'd choose West Coast lol I had to go with the Biggie which is fries, baked beans, pulled pork, coleslaw and sauce. Now this one appealed to me because of the pulled pork and coleslaw but the fries are just perfect not skinny not super thick just right, crisp and seasoned just right! the pulled pork was portioned our bite size and throughout and it was soft and juicy, the coleslaw was heaven it didn't have a bunch of mayo or dressing but instead was bright and colorful full of crunch I didn't even feel guilty about eating French fries! The only thing for next time I will order easy sauce since the beans already have a flavoring on them and they ARE good beans so yeah maybe even no bbq sauce on mine. All and all I had to give this food 5 stars just my whole experience and the owners are very down to earth and professional they are true foodies that apparently did the whole culinary school thing and worked as a chef etc etc well just saying because you see so many food trucks opening up but it's nice to know your getting a lot of love served up in every order with Monti's BBQ and I will look for them out there",iOb90KPckuJ_ubo-R3utOQ,1,0,5,g2wnZY_6qiriLH3q5i5GHw
