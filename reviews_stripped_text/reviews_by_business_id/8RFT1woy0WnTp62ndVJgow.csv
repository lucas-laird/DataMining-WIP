My mother in law got the vegetarian omelette with fries and she loved it! The portion is huge! But very very good.

I got the the play with the steak ham and hash and eggs. W a side of sausage . The sides are BIG couldn't finish it. We got 3 sides of sausage and we usually do at ihop since smaller portions. Everything was very good.


Chocolate chip pancakes my son got. There kids menu to me is exspence. Almost $6 for the pancakes and additional charge for a side, unlike ihop you pay $5for kids plate including 2 sides.

1003595,2017-01-08,0,8RFT1woy0WnTp62ndVJgow,"Service and food were great.  We are winter residents who search for new places to eat breakfast on Sunday. We were not disappointed.  Don't be discouraged by the location next to a somewhat dodgy-looking (my opinion) smoke shop because the restaurant is very clean inside and out.  The decor and ambiance are somewhat retro.  Not obviously set up to be a retro 50's diner, it is still reminiscent of that era.  When we arrived there, even late by our standards, there were only a few customers, and we were seated immediately.  Before we left the place was full, so it is popular, but maybe with a later crowd.  

The menus - kept at the table or booth - are professionally done with accurate photos and descriptions of the extensive choices available.  The wait staff was prompt, courteous and friendly and there was sufficient staff that there was very little waiting for service.  Food was served promptly with no more than the usual wait. Our coffee cups never got below half full. And the food was very good.  My wife had steak, eggs and pancakes and I had the meat lovers skillet; a revelry of cholesterol and calories.  Both were excellent fare, but we obviously didn't go there for a health food menu. Be sure to bring an healthy appetite because the portions served are beyond generous.   

The only knock is that the booths are not padded and they are connected back to back.  If the person sitting behind you is frigidity you are going to feel it.  Perhaps tightening the floor mountings would help.  

Overall it was a great experience.",gKFbnx-0dYcc-jzDVckbVg,0,0,4,ObP_YmYxLeLfwTW51MfR9A

The second time not so good I went on 4th. of July and it wasn't busy at all maybe 5 or 6 tables with people and 4 waitresses. So services should of been fast so you would think. We order our sons food first being 4 he has a small attention span when it comes to restaurants and places a like. After we order him eggs and toast we were told the waitress would come back in a few to get my wife and I's order. Well a few minutes turned in to 15 -20 minutes. After all that wait time a completely different waitresses took our order because the first one didn't seem to enthused to be a work. Granted it was the 4th of July but it was the afternoon. I order the chicken parm sub was way over salted just not good was ok though. If I was you I would skip this and head somewhere else.

Service is impeccable. Very friendly. The food, even better. We each ordered something different and all raved about it. I had the Texas Chili Omelette and it could feed a small (or large) army. My son ordered a few pancakes and what came out could have also fed many. 

Going around the table, everyone was happy. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely become a regular here. 

I think they close between lunch and dinner. Around 3 pm the server/manager said she was preparing to close up but told us in no uncertain terms we were welcome to stay as long as we wished. No rush at all. 

It's a very casual, friendly, old-fashioned diner experience. Didn't try the coffee, but food was great. Hope to return soon. Might try lunch or dessert next time.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,0,0,5,ORPrJuUhdBwjF6U_SRGAeQ

Blue Skillet instead of Blueberry Hill
Maybe because the original team would be ashamed of them! 
One malicious person in the kitchen can cause a bad review!
They served the wrong meal by mistake , understandable. I ordered grilled not breaded and fried pork chops. No problem, I quietly waited no fuss no recriminations, just an error.
Until my "" pay back "" meal came. They had cut the chops to the tiniest most pathetic things you have ever seen. Not worth even tasting.
I paid for the toast and coffee and left. And I tipped the waitress well, she was embarrassed by what they had done.
Maybe this is why they have different name from before.

I love blueberry hills food, and let's be honest, this a blueberry hill location under a new name. However, from today on I will no longer be a patron. I called in to order like normal and there was no answer. I double checked that the number was correct and called again 5 different times with no answer. No worries, I guess they are busy... I called again a 6th time and was placed on a 15 min hold In which I finally just hung up. I decided to just go down to the location and make a to go order in person. I'm normally a pretty easy going person. I ordered a meal with some substitutions because all of their meals are very carb heavy and I am trying to cut back on my carb intake. The meal came with two sides of carbs that equals out to $4.98 a la Carte. I wanted a simple substitute of a side of bacon. The waitress had to go to the supposed manager 3 different times before coming back to tell me they could only substitute with more carbs. They have no idea that I was the one that called in and was put on hold for entirely to long, busy or not, that really is unacceptable and now I'm pissed. I let the waitress know this little fact and all I'm asking for is a small substitute that is a $1.79 less than the two sides of carbs. It wasn't the price I was worried about paying, the meal would've still cost the same and actually more because I was asking for other additional sides that the meal normally doesn't come with. It was the principle of a simple substitution that the supposed manager still couldn't accept. One item to replace two items. As a manager myself, I know these things can be done. Managers are supposed to help de-escalate a situation. Not make it worse. I wasn't asking for a free meal or to have certain things free, I was asking for a direct substitution that ultimately costs the company less. At that point they lost my patronage and I easily spend $100/month plus sometimes at their joint.

She had never heard of Texas Toast so I ordered the Sour Dough Toast.  The CFS came with two eggs, cooked the way I ordered them (Over Easy) and ""hash browns"" that were cut like the egg noodles you get with chicken and dumplings.  The potatoes were under cooked and tasted raw.  The sourdough toast was as hard as croutons, and not to my liking.  The CFS was not something I'd order again as it was the generic frozen kind and had no flavor whatsoever except for one bite in the middle, which I can't for the life of me, figure out why there was flavor in that one area.  The diet coke was $2.59.  The total was $15.00 for the meal and I tipped $2, which made my dinning experience $17.00 for a meal that I wouldn't be happy with even if it was half the price.  I did see other customers ordering sandwiches, that did look appetizing and thought maybe CFS just arn't what they are going to be noted for.  I don't like to give bad reviews, but I do think every meal should have something memorable to make you want to return, however, I did not get that experience during this encounter.  My advice is, good luck eating at the Blue Skillet.",L5JFnETi16y2gNiESXBYeA,2,0,2,DorUwt2U00aauveQUu6htg

Everything was delicious, and service was great. However, my rating is because I was personally annoyed that for two drinks, one large tomato and one large OJ to be specific they charged us $7.99! I know all about having to increase pricing to make a profit, but come on! That's unreasonable. Also, the bacon was rock hard. My husband said you could tell it was made in an oven.

I loved the little old lady (customer) who chewed them out and took the tips back to give to the waitress. It's sad that such things happen nowadays!

When it came time to take our order, she sat down across the table from us and acted like she had all the time in the world   to take our order, as busy as she was she did not rush us at all. Their fresh apple juice hit the spot for me, we ordered the bonanza special. It comes with 2 eggs anyway you like, bacon sausage or ham, and toast with hash browns or their yummy pancakes. Today I opted for bacon and hash browns and toast. The scrambled eggs were flavorful and cooked to perfection. The bacon was nice and crispy, and the hash browns were super yummy, and not too greasy. All for under $10.  My hubby got the double trouble burger, which comes with 2 huge, savory 1/4 lb beef patties, and homemade chilli. It comes with chili curly fries as well. My hubby is 6""4 and can put away some food. Well he could only eat half. The beef was seasoned to perfection,  and the vegetables were crisp and fresh. I would definitely  recommend for your neighborhood  go-to. 

    Service was out of this world,  the food was great, and the employees work well under stress. I will definitely  be back to see Ms. Donna again.",CmaFYyhgk8DJBxHFND0jGw,2,3,5,0JG5lm9e2rrgbP-1iCrTwQ

To top it off, she messed up my order! 
I'm not the type to return my order because I don't like wasting food considering the fact that I know they'll throw it away so I ended up eating it anyway.
