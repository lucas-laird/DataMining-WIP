The place keeps it simple by having their menu but you customize your order by choosing what you'd like on your food. I was craving some chilaquiles for breakfast and I had not found a good place on this side of town. I tried the green chilaquiles with chicken and a huarache with carne asada and they were both delicious!

Decor: Enough tables to sit about 20-30

Service: Very Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable

Environment: Comfortable...good for breakfast or lunch

Food: Mexican
 
Prices:  Affordable.....has yelp $10 for $20 option
 
Debbie Downers:  I thought it was 
 
Conclusion: The only reason I'm placing it 4 stars because I would have to check it out again second guessing myself if the food was really that good!  I had their breakfast stuff and it was absolutely awesome but I want to refrain on a total analysis once I try the non-breakfast stuff.  The fact that they honored my $10 for $20 voucher as I literally got it 5 mins before I got there is cool in itself.  The breakfast burrito was quite delicious  and lack of hunger lasted until dinner.  Damn near 10+ hours.   You have a lot of options to add with rice, refried beans, guac!, avocado, mild or hot salsas, queso y mas!  I would definitely check this place out again if in the area.

I had a business meeting earlier this year, one that we normally have in one of the big steak houses at the strip.  I brought my partner to Saborr, and we stayed for two hours conducting our meeting.  My partner loved it, saying we have to do it again.

But it is the staff that makes the place so enjoyable.  They are always ready witha smile and a greeting.  I appreciate that they offer a military discount, too.  However, they topped the cake when I came in on my birthday.  We ordered out normal lunch, but the staff wouldn't accept my payment, wishing me a happy birthday instead.

1870795,2014-01-26,0,OBzPCuDTMBF4xijlnffnDw,"The wife and I had noticed this place recently and decided to try it after noticing no reviews were on Yelp. 
It's Mexican cuisine whose format seems to be loosely based on chipotle style ordering. The menu is limited, offering burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. They do offer ribs that we didn't try. Something about ribs doesn't scream Mexican food to me. I ordered a chorizo and bacon breakfast burrito, my wife selected crane asada tacos which came with two sides. The burrito didn't have a bad taste but it had no texture even with the bacon and it was very mushy. The taco combination was presented well and it looked promising. Unfortunately it wasn't the greatest crane asada that we've had. It was  pretty tough and made eating the tacos without destroying the entire construction of the taco very difficult. The woman helping us was very polite and answered our questions but could have done a better job with explaining their format for ordering. We kind of had to just figure it out on our own as she watched as we were visibly and verbally thrown off by the setup.   
Overall it wasn't terrible and the prices aren't bad, but hopefully over the next couple months they will work out some of the minor issues. I'd like to try this again at some point in the future",O8G7YD1ohYIiqpq6e67nVA,2,1,3,z1kCUwguvxKKG7g06C-BoQ

The upside: good prices, military discount, fast service, and really friendly staff.

So what exactly am I talking about?  Flimsy plastic silverware that was just about unusable.  Watery horchata (a crime in my book!)  Bland refried beans, plain chicken and uninteresting enchilada sauce.  It's like they basically don't spice anything, not even a little bit.  No salsa bar... I mean c'mon, where's the salsa bar???

I ordered a scrambled egg, with bacon, chorizo, and potato burrito.  The young lady waiting on me was extremely nice and helpful in adding the best extras to it.  Once she took my order, it turned out she was also cooking it all fresh.  All of the ingredients were then place in what looked and tasted like a home made, oversized tortilla and grilled to a slight crisp.  She brought it out to my table and checked if there was anything else I needed.

Everything in the burrito was outstanding!. Fresh ingredients, cooked to order, and almost too hot to hold.  I would definitely recommend trying Saborr for breakfast and I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner.",HxUbNgPzQKkBVkibRJUHNw,4,0,5,WlEpLIPeRT8iuKahb5YDTQ

3630604,2017-02-18,0,OBzPCuDTMBF4xijlnffnDw,"My previous review gave them 4, but my experience the other day brings them to a 3. 

Came around 6 pm this past Wednesday evening with my two sisters, one of whom is 4 months pregnant. Although I'm a patient person, there was a Mexican guy who was ordering for to-go who was having a conversation in rapid Spanish with the older lady behind the glass and this conversation took over 20 minutes. I don't know how long he was there before we came but THEY knew we were there and didn't ask him to move up so we could be seen until he himself stepped out of the way. He also knew we were there too, so acknowledged us and the other customer behind us after that time. The younger Hispanic woman behind the glass was occupied on the phone, so he had to translate to the older lady whom he was speaking to our order. I had no idea she couldn't speak english. Our fish tacos took over 15 minutes to make, which by that time we had been there 50 minutes and my pregnant sister who was hungry when we came in was nearly faint with hunger. She has fainted before from hunger so this is a problem that's not theirs, but still, that wait time before ordering is entirely their error. Another 10 minutes while they asked us what tortilla we wanted and then our sides and FINALLY over one hour later we got our food and discovered the next problem.

What on earth happened to their delicious flan in tiny ramekins?! Seems these days half the time the flan isn't there and when we finally saw some flan and tried it, it was in a larger pastry plastic shell and sadly tasted like it had been in the fridge for 4+ days (bad refrigerator taste). We at least did not have to pay for it but they said they didn't know how long it had been in there. What??? 

Overall, tacos were good, pico had a very strong onion taste--stronger than usual, flan, service, & wait time were a huge disappointment. I had been the one to suggest us coming there that night so needless to say we won't be back til after summer probably if we are desperate, or maybe give em a try again next year.",j8bhSD379qzoVa15RSCBUw,0,0,3,Yspon8jG_4u6ubAf7YmCqQ

I ordered the 3 taco combo, and thanks to Yelp, I got another taco for free when I checked in! Ask my tacos had cheese, lettuce, sir cream, pico (really good), red salsa, and jalapeños.  Here is my breakdown of the meal:

2 shrimp tacos- you pay 25¢ more or so, but WELL WORTH IT! These were very good with ""intense"" flavor.  5 star. 

1 asada beef taco - steak had a decent flavor, but a little tough.  My toppings made up for the meat being a little overcooked.  3 star.

1 chicken taco - seasoned pretty well, despite being a little overcooked.  No question it was grilled, though, you could taste that. 3 star

Rice and beans for a side.  Can't expect much. Unrated, nothing special. 

At this point, I was leaning towards a 3 star, but decided for a 4 because my co-workers workers really enjoyed their lunch (fish tacos and chicken enchiladas).

The food was good. Really good, actually. I had the 3 taco plate ($6.99) - birria, fish, and carnitas. I never order birria, but it was reallllly good. And so were the carnitas! Fish was decent, but not memorable. The plate came with 2 sides (I picked beans & rice), so it was totally filling. Actually, I didn't even finish it, which is pretty rare for an eater like me. 
Overall, excellent value. More food, locally owned, and about the same price as Chipotle. Plus points for 10% off military discount.
Ambiance, however, is kinda lacking. Or I mean, this isn't a place with ambiance. It's more like a Roberto's. Perfect for a lunch break from work. If I lived in the area, I might even hit it up for a casual dinner once in a while (2 for 1 happy hour! $1.75 micheladas!).

It was one of those things where it looked a lot better than it tasted. The burritos are decent sized, although I like to stick with the three tacos to get a variety in my belly.

I ordered the 3 tacos so I could sample their selections.  I got one fish, one carnitas, and one carne asada.  The fish was good, the carnitas was better, and the carne asada was just ok.  
You can pick the toppings, the sides, the meat and the tortilla. They have a soda fountain, bottle and canned drinks.... and I even some some beer selections. 
This is very casual quick grab some lunch kind of place, but the food was good and the staff friendly. If I'm hungry on this side of town again, I will come try some of the other meats. Who am I kidding....I'm always hungry!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,2,1,4,73xItYW1ZwIxtJ3q77x09g

4835405,2014-09-25,0,OBzPCuDTMBF4xijlnffnDw,"I was pleasantly surpised by this place. I went in expecting just average or below average Mexican food, but I left having enjoyed my meal with the plan on coming back.

I got a wide range of tacos: carne asada, pork chile verde, adobada pork, and fish. With some rice and beans.

Besides the fish, all the meat was already cooked, chopped, and sitting in bins, which was kinda a let down. I at least was hoping that the adobada was on those spits and being freshly carved amd grilled. But everything had good flavor and nothing was dry. The pork in the chile verde was a little tough, but nothing too bad. The adobada tacos were a little soggy since the meat was sitting in the sauce/juices.

The best thing I ate were the fish tacos. I watched each one be hand breaded and fried fresh. The batter wasn't too thick and I could taste the fish. The cabbage was fresh and crispy, and the sauce,  while present, wasn't heavy or overpowering and helped round out the taco.

Everything I ate had good flavor, and my total bill didn't put a dent on my wallet. I will definitely come back for more of the fish tacos and to try other stuff on the menu.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,3,0,4,3z4oLTgkms0MbKtooDFhww

Similarly to Chipotle, you can go down the line and tell them exactly what you'd like on your torta/taco/burrito. Unlike Chipotle, the upcharge for guacamole is only $.25 for tacos/tortas, and $.50 for burritos, and most of the time, they don't even comp it anyway. Oh, and the guacamole's more flavorful anyway.

For a fraction of the price of Chipotle, I got more food, dessert, and 2-for-1 beer. Eat local.",cjurhtrnXpb-5JlJHvEk_w,4,1,5,Nh28cLUvx5ocgbDb2BL8jA

5227840,2016-10-24,2,OBzPCuDTMBF4xijlnffnDw,"Stopped in Saturday morning while our brakes were being repaired across the street.

The restaurant looks like a little hole in the wall from the outside, but is actually fairly large, very clean, and very bright. 

They have an open kitchen, where you can see all the magic happening.

Its set up a bit like a Subway or Chipotle.  The menu is on the wall, and you dictate what you want on your burrito/taco/etc as it is made for you.

My husband and I chose the cheese quesadilla, I got mine with two sides, and he ordered a tamale.  Cheap, quick and easy. 

I know quesadillas are not hard, and aren't really the best thing to judge a place on, but they were good!  The cheese was gooey and melty, the tortilla was crisp, but chewy:  perfection.  

The beans and chips were great too.  I'll have to find out if they make the chips in house.  They were really nice. 

Fella's tamale was ok.  Flavor was great, but one side of it was super dry.  One of the downsides to premaking tamales.  The other half was perfect, and the flavor, like I said, was fantastic. 

The service was phenomenal.  
The two ladies working were friendly and fast.  Super polite.

It's a hit and miss with personalities and customer service but I'll deal with that to have good food!! 
Today there was a half naked/homeless man inside getting tacos!! That makes me feel a little uncomfortable when I'm alone (as a female with small child). 


I did preorder my pickup through yelp today and when I arrived they claim they didn't receive it. Either way they began making it after I showed them the order. Sucks because I literally didn't want to wait.
