The quality of the food here is incredible. The udon broths are perfect - they're not salty and they're not bland. Their tempura is so lightly fried and comes with both curry salt and green tea salt. They have ginger pork that doesn't overpower you with ginger flavor and is very tender and soft. They have miso eggplant that is rich but sweet at the same time, but not overpowering. 

This is far better than the previous restaurant that was here. The prices are just right. The owner and staff are so nice and accommodating. The restaurant is never too busy. It's just perfect.",V-FM3wh4wJ6UKdKA4lhbPQ,0,0,5,mD2TpTsP8ts5Ip0tksRK8g

1253911,2016-12-31,0,Q3c9S0GOZpuBQkwXeXvo0Q,"Been here several times and have been pleased with both taste and service each time. Every visit I have had some variant of cold (zaru) soba, most recently with tempura. The tempura batter was very crispy, fried just right, and the shrimp very soft. The 'koshi' (firmness) of the soba is on the firm side - not over-boiled. When having soba, it is customary to ask for 'soba-yu' after finishing your meal. It's basically the water the soba was boiled in. Most of the nutrients get lost in the water during the boiling process which is why you also consume the soba-yu. Don't be afraid to ask for it - they'll know what you're talking about and its health benefits are definitely worth it. Usually you mix it with your leftover dipping sauce and drink, just be careful because it's usually very hot. 

Their lunch specials are awesome. The combos come with a half portion of a rice bowl dish and noodles for a very reasonable price. The service is always great and the workers very nice and welcoming.

The place was empty save for a mother and her cute toddler, so I was a little hesitant to dine there. But I'm glad I stayed! 

I was between the Shrimp Ten Kake and Gyu Don, but at the advice of the waitress, I got the Shrimp Ten Kake with soba noodle. My friend got the Gyu Niku with soba noodle. In addition to the noodles/tempura, there was also a side salad and a little plate of pickled vegetables (I couldn't put a finger on what the vegetable was lol). They were a nice addition to refresh my palate. I enjoyed the assorted tempura that came with my noodles; they did not lose their crunch when I dipped the tempura in the broth, which was much appreciated. While their broth was tasty, I felt like the flavors were a bit muted and would've enjoyed a bolder broth.

The waitress occasionally checked up on us but was not too overbearing. They also gave us a coupon for a free dessert on our next visit. Price point was acceptable as the meal came with the salad and pickles. Service was fine, though our food did take a while to come out.

I was content with my visit here, but is it something I'd crave on the regular? Not really. Maybe I'll come back for their gyudon sometime, if I'm in the area.

I thought the food here was really good. It was not too heavy or oily. I had their shrimp and vegetable tempura w/ cold soba & my friend had their katsu-don w/ hot udon. I just really wish they had a brown rice option. I know it's kinda uncommon to have brown rice at Asian restaurants but I prefer brown rice over white & it would be nice to have some more healthier options anyways.

The nasu-dengaku was my favorite. The eggplant was very tender and beautifully presented. The miso glaze moreso glazed the serving dish. I made sure to scoop up all of it with the eggplant pieces. 

The sansei tororo was a hardy mix of seaweed, greens, carrot, and yam. Delicious broth and soba noodles! The only unfortunate part of dinner was filling up too fast for dessert.

I started with the chawanmushi appetizer, which I enjoyed. My guy opted for the cold soba noodle meal and was disappointed by the quality and flavor. Perhaps going the route with added tempura would have been a better choice. I'm not much of a fan in the first place, so I opted for a chirashi. Meal was beautiful and fairly priced at $15 including soup and salad, but some of the fish used was less than fresh and the spicy tuna seemed downright old.

We're gonna drain the cup dry""
- Leigh & Coleman

I was pretty scared when I came here trying to go to I-Naba and found that they were closed and Chabuya was open in place. I love good Soba noodles and I-Naba was the best in town by far. To my shock and surprise Chabuya was not just as good as I-Naba, but as a first impression goes, it was better in a few ways.

The menu is almost identical to what it was under I-Naba, specializing in fresh soba and udon, but containing several other Japanese dishes such as Chirashi, Katsu Don, Age Nasu, Oyako Don, etc. I couldn't help but compare everything I tasted to the previous incarnation that was I-Naba...the results are as follows:

We started our meal off with an order of Chawanmushi, literally ""tea cup steam,""  an egg custard dish with a little shiitake mushroom, shrimp, chicken, and fishcake placed in a tea-cup-like container... it was enjoyable and comparable to I-Naba's.

While the Chawanmushi was good, we came for noodles. The noodles are not the dried variety. They are still made fresh in California and shipped in weekly. The noodles tasted and felt virtually identical to I-Naba's...which makes since as they come from the same source. A smaller amount of tsuyu dipping sauce was served with the noodles, but they were happy to bring more when I requested it. Chabuya's Ten Zaru contained a slightly more plentiful portion of tempura vegetables...a pleasant surprise...and I was happy to taste the same light tempura I was accustomed to.

My love ordered a hot Udon combination that came with a side of Zuke Tororo (Marinated raw tuna). I really started to take notice of Chabuya when I tasted the Zuke Tororo. This dish was certainly better than I-Naba's version...and I was a fan of I-Naba's.  

Admittedly, I didn't have the occasion to taste several of the items on the menu...Could I be rushing with this 5 Star endorsement? For me, I-Naba was always about satisfying a certain cold soba deficiency. Cold noodles are a refined craving to be sure...some would even liken it to crack. Those individuals are just soba junkies! This is such a deeper, more fundamental craving. This is a spandex to the figure-skater kind of essential craving, and I am immensely pleased that Chabuya is here to quell that yerning. I'll be back...though it may take a while for me to venture into other parts of the menu...after all, that soba is so good!",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,12,8,5,zI_j8ajSd9IXvGZmCPlNCg

3023811,2017-03-18,0,Q3c9S0GOZpuBQkwXeXvo0Q,"Definitely hidden in a corner and there's 3 signs on the restaurant itself with NA-NA I think being the larger sign so it makes it a bit harder to find. My friends and I came around 8:30 last night and the restaurant was surprisingly very empty. We were the only ones there. Its a good sized restaurant with clean restrooms and a simple menu. 

I know they have lunch combos and we were sad to find out that they don't offer those noodles/rice combos during dinner but we will have to be back during lunch to try them! 50% off appetizer (one for the table) with yelp checkin! We ordered the salmon sushi which was a lot like salmon nigiri IMO but with a lot more rice. It also had salmon roe on top. At first bite, it had a refreshing taste from I have no idea what, but it definitely threw me off! However, I do wish that they would use a bit less rice, I could barely taste the salmon. There were 6 fairly large pieces in one order and it came with ginger and wasabi. Next time however, I will be ordering the salmon sashimi. 

I ordered the gyu niku, hot with soba noodles, which has thinly sliced ribeye and a boiled egg. I didn't know that it also comes with seaweed and a piece of pumpkin or squash (?) tempura as well. I wanted more veggies and requested mountain veggies ($2.50) on the side. Probably won't be ordering extra veggies on the side as there was enough seaweed to keep me happy. The broth is on the lighter side, but I still found it to be flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of ramen broth as it can get really salty so this broth was perfect. The tempura, despite being soaked in the broth, was still very good and crunchy but I will request for it to be on the side next time. 

My friends ordered the unagi bowl which came with a small side salad and some miso soup. He said he enjoyed it more than another place in OC which was surprising! My gf ordered the Ten Zaru, cold soba noodles, which came with shrimp and veggie tempura. Very cute presentation! The broth was hidden in the cup underneath the green onions! They also provided a dipping sauce for the tempura. 

Server was attentive and refilled our waters without us having to flag her down. She also came by to check on us often and boxed my food to go. I wished she packaged the broth and noodles separately though! Not a big deal, I didn't want my noodles getting super soggy so I just separated them when I got home.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,1,0,4,Kbt3cG62ZoC4E-7ZhDXz1w

3236195,2016-10-11,0,Q3c9S0GOZpuBQkwXeXvo0Q,"I was soooo craving something with rice and beef with a teriyaki sauce and while perusing the different restaurants, I decided to order from Chabuya.

I order the Yakiniku Don and noticed the tempura....of course i need tempura in my life and then I noticed Chicken Karaage [one of my fave things to eat!] so that found it's way on my order...geez, my eyes are bigger than my stomach!

The food arrived nice and hot and smelled delicious, let me share my food adventure.

The Seaweed soup: This soup sent me back to my childhood. This soup sent just the right amount of nostaligic warmth through every sip.

The salad was, at first a mix of simple green, but the dressing was a bright yet suttle sesame style dressing that really wasn't overpowering and gave the greens the right coating of dressing.

Tempura: Visually, I liked the slight little markings and shapes the vegetables were cut in to really create a nice presentation. Most local asian restaurants use the usual staples for tempura, but what I like about this collections was the addition of the perilla leaf, it's own unique shape stood out.

The Chicken Kaarage was good, moist and the light wasabi aioli was just enough!

Lastly, My yakiniku Don. I think i was the envy of everyone near me at work, the aroma filled the work area and then it was many inquiries after that!. Mushrooms, onion, and teriyaki beef? Over Rice? Yes!

Everything was enjoyable and delicious, I will definitely recommend this place to my co-workers!

Chabuya is nice in that they like to deliver/take out dishes and offer discounts and honor any check-ins or deals without question.  

We ordered a couple cold noodle dishes and the eggplant appetizer.  The eggplant was very good, tasting similar to a age dashi tofu just with an eggplant to change the consistency and taste up a bit.  The soba noodle dish was delicious and came with a good selection of vegetable tempura.  The cold noodle vegetarian dish came with same mushroom and Japanese greens with a very tasty broth.  For everything the meal came to a little over $30.  We were thoroughly full and could even have brought some leftovers home for another meal if we chose.  

Very delicious and an authentic Japanese location.  I thin t heir location is the only thing holding them back from more customers as they aren't in the traditional Spring Mountain line of Asian restaurants; rather they are on Desert Inn instead.  Chabuya would be perfect for a hearty lunch and will be on my radar if in the area in the future to try some of their other hot or rice entrees.

After calling in the early afternoon to make a group reservation, I found out later that they are usually closed Sunday nights but the owner, Danny, was nice enough to stay open to accommodate our group. What followed was an impromptu sake tasting, stellar service, and some excellent dishes. 

Plenty of good appetizers can be found on their menu like the creamy and rich Chawan mushi (egg custard with shrimp, chicken, and mushrooms), the well balanced Nasu dengaku (sweet miso glazed eggplant), or the crispy chicken karaage. But my favorite app was the salmon oshi sushi -- excellent, well seasoned rice topped with salmon and ikura.

For an entree, I went with the pork ginger don. Slice of pork with a prominent ginger flavor topped a massive amount of rice.

If you still have room for dessert, try the An'mitsu.

I would sooooo gonna go back.",itnix8lejRL3XF6WsRIMKg,0,0,5,Yvqe4P-GBkVKRGUttmfEAQ

Tempura vegetables were fresh and lightly fried. Unagi was delicious, but perhaps too few pieces?",KjOhQyC6kocsEih0T2Uc6A,0,0,4,EcnABaGjzi-HIL8e2OdT0w
4912526,2016-11-11,0,Q3c9S0GOZpuBQkwXeXvo0Q,Small place hidden in a Plaza that you could drive by many times and not notice. Very welcoming staff inside and willing to help through menu. Food was excellent with plenty of options...and Asahi beer on draft. Would reccomend giving a try for good Japanese food.,27JX6k0P_1TrQhtsZ1Nilg,0,0,5,OFYZOgYNZK6kUgGNFfEMUA

Chijimi a bit on the undercooked side,  tempura sauce had no flavor at all...didn't think that was possible.  Karaage was overcooked.",r6awYzzKuW3VDIq7A3gC0A,0,0,1,5bXCBqQmljf14P7nXjtKJw

Parking situation: excellent.
Service: so fun.

Came with a friend on a random week night and the place was pretty empty. Apparently this place used to be i-naba (which is where my friend told me we were going and what I was looking for as I drove around the parking lot for 15 minutes) but the sign on the outside says ""chabuya"". They're apparently the same place though so don't fret.

We started with a tempura appetizer because (yay yelp!) checking in here gets you 50% of an appetizer. The tempura was good. It was a nice variety of their menu items and I really enjoyed the chikuwa tempura--something I'd never had before! I also ordered the gyu-niku since this place is known for its noodles. I'm no noodle-master but I thought they were pretty tasty. Also split the katsu don with my friend which was above average, as far as katsu don goes.

AND THEN DESSERT. An mitsu (per website: agar jelly, fruit, kinako ice cream and brown sugar syrup) and an order of kinako ice cream. Get the an mitsu. It was really tasty and the jelly and fruit complement the kinako ice cream beautifully. Seriously, you won't be disappointed.

Our waitress was also super sweet. She was the one that suggested the an mitsu (we were just going to share an order of the kinako ice cream). And apparently the sword they have on display up front is a real samurai sword! (Don't touch.. very sharp!)

You might drive right past this place since it's pretty unassuming and located on a block of Decatur that doesn't exactly scream ""asian restaurant here!"" but if you take the extra 15 mins driving around the parking lot like I did, you won't be disappointed.",2PpCp3l1c_yzcY236ptEKg,0,1,4,K_boY7KDCYoXrBYW2BiX2g
5846084,2016-10-15,0,Q3c9S0GOZpuBQkwXeXvo0Q,"This place is tucked away in the Smith's Shopping Center- probably not the most accurate in regards to location- but the most notable landmark. 

As far as the food is concerned, the presentation and portions were traditional and pleasing to the eyes.  For taste- the food was quite enjoyable from something like the miso soup to my Zuke Don.  Flavorful and satisfying. 

If I could have given 4.5 STARS, I would have- they are in the midst of establishing themselves as Chabuya (formerly Nana Noodles) and creating an identity for themselves. 

Definitely coming back- the service is very attentive!",Yp_rw7oHnGULuRPKFHnjWw,0,0,4,21vDpWT43x9NB4eg5RA58A
5908557,2017-04-15,0,Q3c9S0GOZpuBQkwXeXvo0Q,"This was a big disappointment. I wanted to like it because I go nearby often. The service, while very courteous, was severely subpar.  First the tea was lukewarm, then the miso soup came lukewarm. Then they shorted us on the sashimi order. The server corrected the mistakes, but these are basic mistakes that should not have happened. 

We ordered several appetizers such as salmom nanban zuke, sashimi, chicken karaage, marinated eggplant, and a pork ginger don rice bowl. Nothing was remarkable, just passable - but the salmon dish was oddly cold (or again lukewarm). Not sure if it was supposed to be that way, but it was a turnoff. The ice cream (an mitsu) dessert was the best item, accompanied with a sweet syrup, mashed red bean and gelatinous cubes.  

Frankly, compared to the many otherJapanese places we frequent in LV, the setting, furnishings, and service felt tacky. I was just happy to leave as soon as possible.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,1,0,2,P091_halw5gYfc_PQUVyUw
