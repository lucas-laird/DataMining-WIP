We had a chance to meet the owner, Joe Masterson. He took the time to tell us the history of the restaurant and showed an impressive knowledge of seafood from around the world.

My wife had the Whole Fried Belly Clams. They were hand breaded after we ordered them, then fried to perfection. She is from Massachusetts, and was extremely pleased with the authentic taste of these Ipswich Clams. (Very hard to find out west)

I ordered the Shrimp. It was honestly the best I ever had. They remove the tails and  de-vein  them all in house. But just like the Clams, they were not breaded until we ordered them.

When we pulled up it was smaller than the Mexican joint next to it and I was very unsure about the whole thing. When I walked in tho and saw the picutres and smell it took me back and I thought I was sitting at the board walk.

I assumed we would be served because menus were on the table but as soon as we sat down the lady told us to order at the register when we were ready.  the staff was sitting down watching Tru TV with the TV pretty loud when we walked in but was kind enough to turn it down when asked.  

I ordered the lobster roll and my mother the haddock. My roll cam on what looked like a piece of texas toast, one slice foldded in half, with a mixture of lobster, celery, mayo, it was very runny but had a good taste. The seasoned fries were fresh cut but soggy.  My mothers fish tho was excellent. The batter was not too heavy  and very flakey. The hushpuppies a little to dry.

356799,2010-11-26,2,UAMTM6LMA2on079oBMFBPQ,"I finally got around to getting to Lazy Joe's the night before Thanksgiving. I got there around 5pm, and they were actually pretty busy!

I really, really wanted to like this place, but I had some issues. I'll say first i'm NOT a fan of their batter. I know, it's gluten-free, and i'm glad this is out there for people with gluten allergies. But, I prefer a beer-battered fish. The quality of the fish was good, I got a single piece of cod, and 2 shrimps. The flesh was sweet and tasty, no fishiness. YAY! The batter is just not up my alley, it's dense and heavy. The hushpuppies were -excellent- and I really liked those! They seemed handmade, with flecks of onion and parsely. The fries were SO dissappointing! The color -looked- good on them, but they were soggy, limp and greasy. I got the seasoned fries, and I liked the flavor of the seasoning, I just could not eat much, due to the limpness.

The owners of the business really TRY hard, tho. They are both friendly people, and seem to care about some things, but leave other aspects hanging. It's a small place, with perhaps seating for 30 people. There are menus on the table, and it seemed like it was a sit-down, waiter service type of place. But, if you took a seat, you'd find people cutting in front of you, and they don't bother to put signage up, to let people know to order FIRST, then take a seat. Clarification on this would be nice, but I'm sure the regulars knows the drill by now.

I'm glad I tried Lazy Joe's, but I won't be back. If I want great F&C, I have a Village Pub down the street that is much more to my liking.",DwS5fvL_BR1-uUaafGTkOQ,2,0,2,aDX5T0ZhLbCq4-sK3eX9cw

I can safely eat gluten free here. the fries are fresh cut, the batter is a corn based batter and although they don't season it my non gluten free husband still likes it (although he adds the non gluten free malt vinegar to his). It's so great to be able to have onion rings, fried mushrooms, AMAZING chicken strips, breaded fish and so much more. My parents who aren't gluten free also prefer Lazy Joe's to other fish and chip restaurants in the valley so I know it's not just the gluten free thing that keeps me coming back. The food is just really great and fresh! Their tartar sauce, marinara sauce and ranch are also really flavorful and they have the best coleslaw.

Noticed Lazy Joe's while driving back and forth on Rainbow and also found their ad on a local newspaper. One of my husband's faves is Fish and Chips so this was a place we had to go to...someday.

We finally checked it out for a late lunch on Friday. When we arrived, it was packed! There were no tables available...It's a small place. I would guesstimate the maximum capacity of 30 people. 

Their menu isn't posted anywhere except an 8x11 copy in front of the register. The hostess was quite helpful and made suggestions while we perused through the menu. 

I ordered the Fish Sandwich (Cod) which comes with a side of cole slaw and fries. I also ordered Clam Chowder and a drink. Total price: $13.80. Not cheap!

My husband ordered the 2 Fish Filet which comes with a side of cole slaw, hush puppies and fries, and a drink. His bill was about $12.00.

Their cod Fish Sandwich was very good! Not too greasy. The batter was light. It didn't overpower the fish. They give you a choice between cod, catfish and some other fish. They also give you a choice between regular or seasoned fries. The cole slaw was creamy and a bit underseasoned. The clam chowder was delicious! (Although, they give you a tiny portion for $3.99.)

449098,2011-08-18,0,UAMTM6LMA2on079oBMFBPQ,"I'm always in search of good Fish & Chips and that seems hard to find in this town. So alas, I gave this place a shot especially since it was near my house. After all, what did I have to lose? 

First Impression: Hmm maybe we should re-think this! We walked in and the place was dead but the owner was a great fella along with the rest of his staff so we decided to stay. 

My fellow foodie and I ordered our dishes- 2 cod & onion rings and 2 chicken/2 cod with seasoned fries. Let me tell ya, those fries are so worth it. If you like the cajun fries at 5 Guys, these are better! Nice and crispy and great portion size. 

At first glimpse of my plate, i'm thinking hmm $10.99 is far to expensive for 2 itty bitty little pieces of fish and 2 small but fat pieces of chicken. Well once I started eating I soon learned that the combo was bigger than I thought. All them carbs quickly filled my stomach. Lo and behold, there was a huge cod filet buried under my fries! 

The interesting thing is that they use a gluten-free batter, which has it's pros and cons. One pro being that the fish wasn't as soggy and greasy as you find in other places. The con being that there was hardly any flavor and I hate to use the tartar sauce & malt vingear for every bite just to give it flavor. 

My partner enjoyed her over cooked onion rings, which the staff was more than happy to remake but she declined. Had they been cooked slightly less, these onion rings would have phenomenal! They were seasoned perfectly just a tad bit over cooked for me.

The chicken strips were thick and juicy, and the cod fish could have been great but alas the gluten free batter killed the taste.  This place definitely has the right bells and whistles, they just need to revamp the batter and I could definitely see myself coming back.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,1,0,3,LoaPi7AIzK_0vwh-ek5pUw

I went in hungry, in a good mood and wanting fish and chips.

Very nice girl at the counter and the owner cooking.  I ordered the 2 piece cod platter and a side of onion rings.  

The main problem is that everything comes coated in this bland, pale batter.  A good fish batter should cook up golden brown or darker, be crunchy and add flavor to the food.  The pale, tan concoction that was on the fish and onion rings was flavorless and just looked ugly.  I tried to dunk my fish in the tartar sauce, but the batter fell apart.  Then tried cutting with knife and fork, same problem,  crumbled into bits.  Now I know your probably thinking I waited too long to eat it.  Wrong, I ate the fish within 5 minutes of it being prepared.

The reviews seemed promising.  So, we drive on over there for dinner...and we're excited because it's a Friday and we saw online that Fridays and Saturdays they're having their All-You-Can-Eat fish or shrimp.  My brother gets the AYCE shrimp, I get the AYCE fish and mother gets a fish & scallop combo meal.  Across the board, all our food items are ruined by their batter.  The batter is not light & crisp...it's so eggy and thick that when it was fried, it became hardened and gummy.  However, what's that saying?...Beggers Can't Be Choosers...and we're going to try to at least eat our fill on the AYCE deal.  My brother goes to order another batch of shrimp and gets jumped on by the younger bald-headed fry-cook/owner/warden guy.  This guy asks for specifics...how much did you order, how much times did he already order...blah blah blah.  To sum it all up, their fries are burnt, their toss salad was mediocre, their hush puppies were actually decent and I could easily make a better tartar sauce at home!  The flowering onion was possibly the best item we ordered...it was light and crisp but very flavorful.  My brother had the clam chowder and he said it was mediocre, as well.

To sum it all up, their food was nothing special and that barking, snappish fry-cook guy ruined our dinner.  The owner (JOE) was upset at his crew because he, too, was snapping at them for something in front of all the customers.  It was just pathetic all the way around.

That should of been the red flag to send us on our way. 

She came in behind us and there was a younger guy working the register. He was just plain scary looking, looked totally cracked out and rubbed his nose as he stared at us.

If it wasn't prepaid, I probably would have just left, in hindsight should have just asked for a refund. The food was bland, no taste, had to be smothered in tarter sauce to make it eatable.

525972,2013-04-25,0,UAMTM6LMA2on079oBMFBPQ,"After my visit to Lazy Joe's Fish & Chips tonight, I won't be returning.

I ordered a 2 item combo plate, which came with 5 shrimp, 5 whole belly clams, 2 hush puppies, fries, and cole slaw.  I also tried the lobster roll.

This place must live on the novelty of being ""gluten free"", because that's the only reason I can see to eat there.  For those of us who can eat gluten, the batter is anything but flavourful.  I'd describe it as bland, with a ""mealy"" texture; and certainly not the nice crispy texture you'd want if you're craving fried seafood.  I understand that those with gluten allergies will love this place on principle, but this is definitely a case where everyone else suffers.  They DO have whole belly clams, so that is a plus.  However, you have to tolerate the gross batter in which they're fried.  Talk about taking a good thing and ruining it completely!!

On the flip side, the lobster roll had way too much seasoning, especially the SALT!!  It was literally like eating a salt lick on a dried out, toasted, New England style hot dog bun.  It had lots of fillers, too.  It was stuffed with lettuce and celery; not something anyone in New England would tolerate in a lobster roll.  Of course, that didn't matter, since you couldn't even remotely taste the lobster with the entire mixture tasting like it had been prepared on a big block of salt.

When the gentleman behind the counter asked how everything tasted, I did bring the saltiness of the lobster salad to his attention.  I asked him if he made his lobster salad for the rolls in big batches, and he said yes.  I advised that he ought to taste it, as the salt levels were extremely unbearable.  He then proceeded to tell me that another customer had commented on the salt level, and that this particular batch they ""got in"" seemed ""saltier than usual.""  Thus, it seems that they actually don't ""make"" their lobster salad in big batches, but rather ""get it in"" in big batches.

However, the biggest faux pas wasn't the extreme saltiness of the mixture, but rather the complete lack of any effort to ""make it right"" with me, the customer.  All I got was a gruff, ""sorry,"" and that was that.

I used to live in Boston.  I know what good ""East Coast"" seafood is supposed to be like.  This is NOT it!!

P.S. I saw three high chairs in the restaurant.  ALL THREE OF THEM HAD BROKEN STRAPS.  If you have a little one who fidgets a lot, then note that you won't be able to properly strap them in at the table.",VH1yfoiAlmmYVcIciysOCw,7,0,1,HZ4TVVfe2_9qL9IGeRVZkw

We ordered a 2 fish (cod) and 2 chicken combo w/seasoned fries, cole slaw, hush puppy and a Super Combo (1 Fish, 2-shrimp, 2 oysters, 2 scallops, 2 clams) with regular fries, cole slaw and hush puppy.

I thought the food  was little too expensive for a fast food place. The  wait time was decent. The orders came out within 6 minutes. 

 There  was no taste in the fish or chicken, very bland.  Even the items in the Super Combo had no taste. Some salt would help. 

The batter tasted the same for the fish and chicken. It was a little too heavy and mushy.  I was expecting the chicken to be more crispy. 

The seasoned fries, cole slaw and hush puppy were average.  Nothing special.

I actually came in because of the mediterranean menu they claimed to have, but the woman said it didn't work so they stopped serving months ago. Well. Cool. How about taking that sign down and taking that menu off the internet?  I was pretty angry at this point.

Apparently this place has a gluten free batter, which explains why it was really bad. Same batter for the fish as the moz sticks. One might think they would share this gluten free batter things with people, but I guess they wait until you've paid up to surprise you with tasteless food.

We gave it a chance because it was two VERY HUNGRY WOMEN and to be honest, the food was not edible. The service was terrible. And we also saw a lady handling raw fish and then touching her cell phone and touching the fish again without washing her hands.

Only one person working and (who I later found out) the new owner sitting outside.  Guy doing all the work was friendly, but definitely could have used some help.  Sales rep stopped in and new owner came in and started haggling over prices of what he needed to order - not a generally good practice in earshot of paying customers.

Tried the 2-pc cod & chips.  The cod was very tasty, moist inside and fell apart in your mouth.  The fries were just how I like - substance with a little bit of greasiness.  Both were very good.

I did notice the cod wasn't as large as the previous photos.  Guess the new owner is making changes.

By far not the best fish and chips I've experienced. but good flavor.  A bit pricey for the size of the fish.

I love me some Lazy Joe's! Anytime I'm running errands in the Southwest I try to put Lazy Joe's on my food-radar. First off, there IS a Lazy Joe. But he's the least lazy Lazy person I know. He not only takes orders and does some of the cooking, he's floating around from table to table talking to his patrons, and not just talking at them at a shallow level... he genuinely wants to know about them, what their background is, what they do... he's looking for a way to connect with them, and often times he finds it, winding into stories of yesterday and how he came up in the business. He's very interesting and treats every customer like a member of his extended family.

The food is a pescaphile's dream! (If you don't know what ""pescaphile"" means, you may not be one.) The menu includes clams, scallops (delish!) and many non-fish items such as burgers and chicken, which contrary to what Jessica Simpson believes, is not ""of the sea"" and in no way references tuna. However, if you go to Lazy Joe's Fish and Chips and do not get fish, please check in to your nearest insane asylum, cuz you're a bit off and need professional help.

The past few times I've went, I've been lucky enough to land on their all-you-can-eat fish fry special, which they run Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The starting round starts with 2 pieces of either cod, haddock, or catfish, six shrimp, and fries. By the time you hit the bottom of your basket, you'll be filled with a sensation of mourning, like, ""This delicious fish... these tasty shrimp... they're all gone! NOOOOOOOO! What have I done to deserve this pain and misery?"" But fear not! Just let Joe and his staff know, and within minutes, the glory of fried fish is back, and this cycle continues until you profusely sweat fish batter.

Exaggeration? Not by much... it's that good.

It's a tiny bit on the pricey side, but then again, you're getting fish in the desert, so it comes with the territory. I wish they would expand closer to me, but for now, anytime I find myself on the southwest side of the 215, I look for excuses to be near Lazy Joe's.

  I decided on the fried calamari, The cod fillet and shrimp combo plate. Everything is made with special batter for people that are gluten intolerant. The only thing I'm intolerant ,that I know of, is bad food. so I was hoping taste didn't go where gluten went.
  This is not a Red Lobster or a Long John Silver. Lazy Joe is a very small restaurant on a strip mall, but they're not about size or theater staging, they're about food! still the place is nicely  and casually decorated, the staff is very friendly and the place kept very clean.
  In case you're wandering, the food was surprisingly good, did not miss the gluten at all the fish was crispy and so were the chips. The calamari was very tasty also, and the sauces were in harmony with the rest of the food. Can't wait to come back and try the other items, even though the prices are a bit too high.

The hush puppies are REALLY good. They are crisp on the outside and felafel like on the inside.

The coleslaw is perfect, not overly mayo ""gooey"" and fresh.

I ordered the Admiral's combo which includes 3 of your seafood choice, fries, and hush puppies. I had the Cod, the shrimp, and the clams. As soon as I get home I dig in, the first piece I had was a clam strip, and it was NASTY; Mushy, undercooked, and extremely fishy tasting. I move on to the shrimp, which was possibly the best cooked out of everything, and the taste was just ok. Finally, the cod, again, slightly undercooked, still gray in color, not flaky, and the batter completely peeled off as soon as I touched it. The fries were, once again, under cooked and soggy. The hush puppies were tasty, but tiny. Worst part about the whole thing is that after an hour of consuming this meal I started getting cold sweats, stomach aches, and a headache. I hadn't had anything else before or after the lunch, so there's no doubt in my mind that the fish (or the poor preparation of it) from this place caused it. I will not be returning to this ""restaurant"", and will encourage all my friends, co-workers, and fellow yelpers to do the same.",IYukmVuHXA96nh0KUxY9DQ,1,0,1,Q-KrQa0jPIuK-xvGuegg7A

Their whole menu (except for bread) is gluten free, because they use a corn coating. So that means I can have fried fish and seafood and things I never get to eat. It's not THE tastiest food, in fact, it lacks a lot of salt and flavor. Clearly all frozen and then flash fried. But I still looked forward to going. 
 HOWEVER, this time (and I've been at least about once a year for the past few years, each time I pass through LV), we walked in and there were no customers (noon on a weekday) and  one woman working there alone. And I see why. First, there was a lot on their menu that was simply not available, including SALAD. Basically, everything we ordered as our first choice was not there. And then it was pretty flavorless. 
 Also, and this is a pet peeve of mine that's happening in more and more restaurants and businesses: the tv is on playing the news. And good grief, there's certainly no good news happening in the world right now. So I asked the woman (since there was NO ONE else there!) to please turn down the volume. I don't think listening to murders, terrorist attacks, etc. is appropriate or appetizing while eating. I've left my home and want to enjoy being AWAY from the TV. if you agree with this, please comment or put it in your reviews.

The guy on the phone had no idea what was on the menu and insisted there was a new owner so things has changed. 
I decided just to go there and order in person.I ordered the cod fish and chips and after dealing with the guy at the register who knew still close to nothing about the menu and received no help from the cooks I sat outside and waited. The place isn't very big but there may have been 2 or 3 tables with people at them out of the 7 they had so it wasn't busy. I waited about 20 minutes and the food was ready.

I took it home which is literally down the street less than a mile. I say that because it wasn't like the food had Sat in the car for an hour or so. When I finally opened the food I found what resembled fish and chips coated in grease. I understand it's fish and chips but this was a bit much. the fries were limp and the batter just fell off the fish which was far from fresh. I had to drown it in salt and the tablespoon of tartar sauce just to get it down.

I was really dissapointed and have no issue in saying I won't be back. I have it a 2 star and it barely got that.

If you love fish and chips, well this place is for you. If you don't care for fish and chips, there are other things on the menu that you can try. All the food is gluten free and the oil that they use to fry the food - makes the food super light, and not oily at all. I normally eat the blooming onion at Outback Steak House, but upon trying Lay Joe's flowering onion, I realized that Outback's Blooming onion sucks! The seasoning fries that came with my all-you-can-eat fried shrimp was amazing! Super tasty. The fried shrimp was really good and fresh. Our table also ordered the fried clams, and the all-you can-eat fried fish, and Lazy Joe's himself allowed for us to share and try each item. The tartar sauce used for the fish is amazing, but if you're like me and prefer malt vinegar, they have that avaiable too. When ordering the all-can-eat fish, there were three choices. Haddick, Cod, or Catfish. Order the haddick - the taste of the haddock is the best. Not too dry or flaky. The catfish is super juicy but can be a little bland. 

The service was wonderful! Lazy joe's himself was there to cook our food as we ordered it. It is as fesh as it gets. He really knows his stuff explaining which region the clams and shrimp came from. The staff was friendly and acommodating. 

The place felt, upon entering, small and alittle warm. Even though this place was packed, the food didn't take long to make at all. Even for all-you-can-eat. 

Even though the location is a little bit hard to find, and really far  from where I'm at, I would definitely recommend everyone to cone out and try this place.",DC9yjg6hluUKtBdmvVWiVg,4,1,4,uOx24h0i5NOodL31_G2gyg

The atmosphere was very subtle, a straight open kitchen type. Only about five to six tables. Small and quaint. It was a Saturday afternoon around 5:15 p.m. and we were the only ones there.

I was a bit surprised as to the varieties of choices on the menu. Of course everything was deep fried which is certainly not a bad thing.

We both ordered fish and chips, I got the haddock my wife got the cod. We got them to go. Bill came up to approximately $30. My wife put on an extra $6 for the tip. Bringing the bill to approximately $36.

The food was okay, nothing to really write home about. Fish and chips that were crispy and tasted nice.

The following day my wife reviewed her checking account only to find that there was now a $96 charge from lazy Joe's. Oops, something obviously was wrong here.

On Monday morning she called and attempted to the speak with somebody that would be able to help her with the situation as it seemed as though there was an overcharged and possibly a mistake.

Only after getting the runaround for the next two days trying to get in touch with somebody who has the authority to even discuss how to correct the situation because we were told only the owner could handle that.

Finally after 4 days we contacted our bank to have the over charge removed but still provide them with the payment as we ordered. Coincidentally, one of the waitresses called us back the following day after having the charged contested and told us that she would be more than happy for us to come by and pick up our extra $60 that had been mistakenly charged by her.

Well the food was acceptable, maybe a little overpriced. I certainly find that the method by which the management handled the credit card over charge certainly will keep me from returning.",EVDpRxM79QXuWJs8xZyyHA,6,0,2,unpvqHrGokkR_rSVePo9Sg

Mediterranean food at a fish & chips place?! I questioned it at first, but figured I'd give it a chance as few businesses would venture into two completely different cuisines. 
I ordered the gyro wrap and was surprised to receive the gyro in a tortilla wrap (instead of a pita..pictured on the menu) & discovered that several slices of pickles had been added as well. After removing the pickles, the gyro wrap was generic at best with the oil from the gyro meat saturating the tortilla so it became an oily mess. Wrap was served alongside fries-which were the best part of the meal.  

My sister ordered the lobster roll & as her review states it was definitely not lobster meat. I'm thankful I did not order the same as I am allergic to shrimp (which is what the ""lobster"" seemed to actually be). 

Check in offer for 20% was not applied correctly as our pre-tax total was $28.97 and I paid $30.28 with the discount. I questioned the cashier about the amount, but she quickly dismissed my inquiry. I was not given an itemized receipt.

I'm not a fan of the Gluten Free batter.  It just tastes ""Blah"" and kills the flavor in my opinion.  They should have a traditional beer batter or tempura batter for the normal people.

Staff and owner are friendly and prices are reasonable but I most likely won't be back unless they add a different style batter to their menu.

There are some great things about this place. When we walked in, first thing I notice - no heat lamps and no pre-breaded fish sitting around. They make their stuff to order which is awesome. The bag of their special batter (a gluten free recipe) can be purchased here. The owner was quite nice and advised us to get a small drink (which is still a gigantic 20oz cup) as there are free refills in the restaurant.

The various fried items (fish and zucchini) were nicely breaded with their special coating and remained moist inside. The coating was substantial and more in the style of a cornmeal-type breading rather than a lighter beer batter. The great thing was it was not greasy but yes, as a previous reviewer noted the batter did have some trouble holding together.

On the downside was their sides and sauces. The tartar sauce was too heavy on the mayo - not enough acidity to balance out the flavour. The coleslaw was kind of bland, nothing special. The fries were homestyled fries which typically lack that lovely crispiness and are prone to become soggy quickly. The hush puppies were ok.

Finally a quick note or word of warning. This place doesn't really season (salt/pepper) their fried items for you. Personally, I have no problem with that 'cause that's how they roll in some of the fry shops in the UK that I've been to. It's kind of expected that you load your stuff with packets of salt/pepper yourself.

Overall, I think this place is good but nothing I feel an urgent need to return for. However for those who have dietary restrictions, this maybe a place you need to check out.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,2,3,OnftadbtxJI3LOjwKIwWsA

I did not find my childhood memory but,  I believe the experience myself and friends had at Lazy Joe's is just the beginning of a lot of new memories.  The fish was delicious, lightly breaded and NOT greasy at all!  Too many fish and chip spots in this town serve deep fried fish dripping in grease!  The fish choices on the menu are wonderful, haddock, cod, catfish!  The shrimp was delicious and fresh and the full bellied ipswitch clams were incredible!!!! And, if the fact that the food was so good isn't enough, I have to say the hospitality was over the top!  Not the waiter, because there is none.  You order food at the cash register and it is delivered to your table.  It's the friendliness of the owner Joe, and his staff.

Now, Joe's fish & chips cannot compare to the crisp, delicious, and authentic fish & chips served at C&A, but they're not bad!

The batter is gluten free - so that's cool if you have special dietary needs. 

My gf and I shared the 3 piece cod fish & chips platter. The fries are absolutely delicious. Get the ""special seasoning"" on the fries instead of just salt. It's a mixture of sea salt and paprika and a bunch of other stuff. I really really enjoyed the fries. The fish was cooked perfectly, but the batter didn't really do it for me. There wasn't much flavor and I didn't get that crunchy fluffy bliss I was expecting. However, it was fresh and my gf really enjoyed hers.  I am kind of picky. 

The platter also came with hushpuppies, which were really good. 

The service is great. Joe, the owner, was actually the one who took our order and came to our table a few times to make sure we were enjoying everything. Very nice guy and cute little place!

Things were bad from the beginning. We walked in and weren't greeted by what I assume to be the owner or manager who was on his cell phone. The couple in front of us hadn't been acknowledged either so we just waited. After a few minutes we were told that their credit card machine wasn't working and they could only accept cash but there was an atm up the street in Walgreens. We wanted to order and come back to pay but we were urged to wait until we got back so it could be fresh. We loaded the kid up, went to Walgreens and came back only to find that the couple who had paid cash hadn't even gotten their food yet. We ordered, I paid cash and we waited nearly 20 minutes for our food while the other couple ate. 
We ordered cod and catfish both orders came with shrimp and fries. Everything was well cooked and fresh but it was all bland. After adding salt, pepper, vinegar and hot sauce to the fish it finally had enough flavor to be edible. The fries weren't greasy but they didn't have any crispness to them at all. My husband said he wouldn't go back but I'm still undecided. 
Perhaps if we would have been greeted, didn't have to wait to be told about the credit card machine, would have ordered before we went to the atm, were given the change from the cash transaction as soon as I paid (had to wait for them to put change in the register) and maybe would have been compensated for our troubles (some free hush puppies would have been nice) we would come back but I'm just not sure.

That being said to the Gluten-Free eater this place is awesome.  It has great customer service, both mom and pop here were very kind, and the Fish and Chips was awesome even to non-Gluten-Free standards.

The fish is fried, but it's not a heavy batter, it's light and everyone liked it a lot.  The timing is obviously right when they fry it because the fish was perfectly flaky, not a second over cooked.  I also got the lobster roll.  It seemed small at first, but it's because the roll it's on is small. There is plenty of lobster salad on it.  I liked it this way, more meat than bun.  This was actually my favorite, they have a unique take on it.

My one advice to the restaurant, the place can be a little cleaner.  The tables and chairs are sticky, and the sauces are sticky as well.  The food is amazing though, I will give them that.

Waited at the counter several minutes with no greeting and had to walk back to the kitchen to rouse somebody who finally came out and then disappeared back in the kitchen for 5 minutes. When he finally came out and we wanted to order he told us the owner is no longer honoring Groupons. Probably our good fortune as the atmosphere is at best fast food dingy.

I was really looking forward to eating here after finding it on Yelp!  My son & I came here today for lunch after his doctor's appointment.  I skipped breakfast because I was expecting to have a big lunch.  I ordered their lobster roll which came with fries & coleslaw, a small corn chowder, and chicken strips for my son.  Fries were soggy, not a single one was crispy; lobster would have been good if they didn't smother it in so much mayo, and the parsley that they sprinkled on top made my stomach turn; clam chowder was nothing special- tasted like it came out of a can.  On a positive note, my son enjoyed the chicken strips but didn't touch his fries, and that's a big shock since fries are his favorite food.  It's been almost two hours since we consumed the food, and sadly both my son & I are beginning to feel nauseas & queasy.  Would not be recommending this place nor would we be returning. :(",tmBrer6xi5-vIM8NB6m9HA,0,0,2,muVXVOAg3JAq_UIQgf-KAg

I had a groupon so I stopped in one late afternoon after work on my way home, and did a pick up order. They were very friendly both on the phone and in person when I went in. 

I got the super combo which consisted of a bit of everything: 1 fish, 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, 2 oysters, fries and some coleslaw. However, I'm pretty sure I got a lot more than just what was listed. I also had to try their New England Clam Chowder because, really, who wouldn't want to try fresh New England Clam Chowder from a fish and chips shop? 

Everything was cooked well and tasted pretty good. I know this place is all gluten-free, which is nice for those with gluten allergies or intolerances, but I'm pretty sure gluten is key to a good frying batter. The seafood itself was tasty, and I think the oysters went best with the gluten-free batter, but there was just something off about the way the fried parts tasted on my food. The fries were tasty, as they were seasoned with the special house seasoning, and the coleslaw was okay, but nothing to write home about. 

I think the best part of my meal was the chowder. It was by far the best New England clam chowder I've had in town, and is the closest to the way I've had it on the eastern seaboard when I vacationed there some years ago. It wasn't too thick, and had lots of clam and potato parts. I love New England clam chowder and I would go back just for a big bowl of that stuff by itself. I kind of just wished I had some good bread to go with it, but the soup definitely stands on it's own.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,1,1,3,l-3UBmgqm2m7nxseZm_Ajg

I ordered the catfish and chips combo. My first thought was, ""This is edible but hands down the worst fish and chips I've ever tried.""  The fries were tired looking and when I took a bite of the fish, the fish completely separated from the batter like all the filling falling out of a hot pocket. A really thin hot pocket. Was definitely not a fan of the bland batter and the fish.

2937583,2011-08-31,1,UAMTM6LMA2on079oBMFBPQ,"It is difficult finding places that make fried gluten free food anywhere in this country without holding the threat of cross contamination over you. For some, cross contamination is not a large concern and fried food, in all its glory, can be experienced with a minimal price to pay later that day/night. For people like myself, too much cross contamination is out of the question and fried food is something of the past unless you make it fresh at home. Of course, I felt this way until I read about Lazy Joe's and it was all trouble from there.

First off, do not come to Lazy Joe's thinking that you are going to get that rustic ale flavor from their fish and chips. The breading is gluten-free, so it is going to taste a little different than the pub down the street (see Crown and Anchor in Vegas!). However, that doesn't mean it isn't delicious! The breading is still a little flaky and not too heavy so that it weighs down the flavor in the seafood. Even though the breading lacks seasoning at times (I wouldn't mind them adding some salt, pepper, granulated garlic, herbs, etc to give it a little more character), when it encases something like a flowered onion or a big stick of mozzarella cheese, very few negative things can be said about this experience. I added some seasoning and BAM! Dunk those fat cheese sticks into their great marinara sauce and you have an appetizer. There is nothing but pleasure while eating their version of Chili's Awesome Blossom. My waistline may hurt a little after eating these app's, but hey, it can't hurt once in a while!

Onto our entree's: Calamari and Popcorn Shrimp. Oh deliciousness. Like I said, the breading needs a little more character but wow do they know how to cook this food perfectly. The shrimp were nicely sized and tender while helped by the added crunch of the breading. The portion size was quite large and if we had stopped eating when we should have, there would still be some pieces left the next day. The calamari was perfect. Served with a marinara sauce, I almost forgot about the simple breading and the fact I had to add a little extra seasoning and some lemon to make it just right. I love that they give you the rings and actual calamari itself when they serve you. FANTASTIC.

Now, onto the fries. If you like crisp, somewhat over cooked french fries than this is not your place. If you are okay with slightly limp fries but with fantastic seasoning, this is the place to go. I normally like my fries crispy, but when they put their seasoned fry seasoning on these potatoes I forgave the lack of crunch and dove in head first into the massive pile of carbohydrates in front of me. To all those who say these fries are terrible, please admit to not liking these type of fries before bashing potatoes that are actually very good and bring the meal full circle. Just a tip: GET THEM SEASONED. Otherwise, they're just predictable and you should try to keep it interesting.

All in all, this should be a solid 3.5 stars, but because Yelp refuses to apply half stars to their reviews I will push it up to 4 because the service was friendly, the restaurant was clean and well-maintained and hey, any place that makes it safe for me to eat in will beat plenty of other restaurants in my book!

P.S. They have specials all the time. Check their website!",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,4,2,4,mY8sX94AMaXMRc0xmB5LRw

I live close to UNLV so this place wasn't an easy find for me. I got the number and asked for cross streets.

Nothing tasted fishy which is a clear indication of how clean the seafood and frying oil is. Before we were even done with our meal the chef sent over a little desert for us to share. He probably noticed how happy we were with our food and wanted to show his appreciation.

The menu on Yelp is drastically different from their current menu (check my photos for the most current menu as of 6/7/17). Lazy Joe's has good variety: Cod, Haddock, Catfish, Tilapia, Shrimp, Scallops. If you aren't feeling fish, they also have chicken fingers, plus a wide variety of Greek selections such as gyro and falafel! 

I admit that I was a bit skeptical of gluten free breading on fish, but it was extremely delicious! The breading is extremely thin, but crunchy...so crunchy in fact that it can just fall off the filet! I opted for the Cod and the Catfish. The Cod wasn't anything special, but the Catfish was exquisite! The tartar sauce was also appetizing; there was a sweet/citrusy note that kept me going back for more.

Overall, Lazy Joe's is definitely worth a go if you're in the mood for fish! The couple that runs the place is super happy, and the food won't disappoint! And it's gluten free! All upside!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,1,0,4,OUP6x87W70NzoQyPd6uIlg

3514816,2010-04-03,2,UAMTM6LMA2on079oBMFBPQ,"When I think of fish and chips the first two restaurants that come to mind are Long John Silver and Arthur Treacher's. Growing up in Virginia those two fast food joints helped form my opinion of that type of food. Needless to say it didn't leave a good impression. If I had a place like Lazy Joe's to try when I was younger I would probably have a higher regard for it.

I tried the cod and shrimp combo. Everything is cooked to order. The cod was tender and flakey and the breading crispy and light. Not greasy at all. The combo came with 2 shrimp, which didn't even look like shrimp when they came out because they were long and thin. But, I guess they butterfly them or something to give them that shape. The seasoned fries were great and the hush puppies (2 of them) were equally as good.

With a drink the meal came out to about 8 bucks, so it's on the pricey side, in my opinion. But the quality of the food was on point.

The place is locally owned, with the owner working the register and checking in on the customers. There seem to be quite a few regulars as the owner knew many of them by name. The decor has a tropical/Keywest vibe, with pastel colors, framed pictures of palm trees and beaches, and plantation shutters on either side of each picture.

At first I was skeptical because I wondered how the texture and taste of the batter would be like without all the Glutenous goodness in there. However, I did overhear one of the employees tell a customer that a part of their secret ingredient is pineapple juice. Pineapple juice? Sold! I love pineapples in liquid form. This then made me assume that this batter would be slightly sweet...

I opt to get their 2 and 2 combo which had 2 slices of the cod and 2 shrimps for $10.99. Oh..it was delish! The breading was light and not filling at all (but it's a good enough portion to leave you satisfied) with a nice crisp to it. I could taste a very very light sweetness to it which I assume is from the pineapple juice! The cod was so tender that it started breaking apart in my hands as I ate them by piece. No complaints here though! I was happy to have a variety and was glad that the shrimp was a good portion as well. The fries are nicely seasoned too. 

I'm a big fan. It's such a small place, but it's SO clean and the decor is just too cute to not admire. I also commend them for having such an open kitchen where guests can see you cook. I find that people who are confident with their execution of the food, and their cleanliness by letting guests see them cook is respectable and trustworthy. The service is so wonderful. I see them walk around and have conversations with guests on a personal level (I mean in a hospitable manner). It was so nice of the guy to stop me halfway through buying a bottle of lemonade by warning me that the lemonade was completely organic with no additives so its extra sour. I'm all for lemonade, but that extra sour to it makes me feel like I might as well just drink a full glass of lemon juice (YIKES!). Good looking out my friend! So I just got the mango lemonade instead...phew.

I had two kinds of clams and they were AH-Mazing! A friend had the lobster roll and my Prince had fish. Everyone liked their supper. Really good ROI for the meal. Would dine there too often if we lived nearby.

Edited to add: 

I noticed that some of the reviews are polar opposites of each other. I really liked eating there and I don't know what to say... possibly different cooks and Joe actually being there makes a difference? Maybe he has had issues with suppliers? Perhaps freshness is open to interpretation? Quality is hit or miss? 

When we went there it was about an hour before closing. Joe was very friendly and talkative and, yes, some might say loud. I prefer colorful. Visiting with him was part of the charm for us. There was A/C (thank God!). The coleslaw is not your average slaw... it's sweetened with pineapple juice rather than sugar. It's different. I liked it. Joe offers a vast array of things for you to dip your fried yummys in. 

You're eating food served on paper in plastic baskets people. This is not Red Lobster (hallelujah).  My Prince and my other friend both felt their cod was on the dry side. Cod can be like that. Haddock is probably a better choice. Fish is not likely to be ""fresh"" on Monday. Keep that in mind anywhere you order fish. We were there on a Saturday. 

We also tried the appetizer assortment. I loved the mushrooms. Between the four of us there was nothing left. Another thing to note is that the cooking/breading is Southern style... not British. If you're looking for fluffy-battered fish you're going to be disappointed. 

Some women came in to order about a half hour after we got there. They meekly asked if he was still serving. He basically said, ""You're here, I'm here... let's do business!"" I like that in a small business owner. The customer is king (or Queen)! 

Awkward moment... Joe being helpful by reading the ingredients off a drink bottle for us because of my food allergies. THIS IS SOMEONE'S GRANDPA! Have some respect! ;) 

We were in Las Vegas for friends. I think we spent a grand total of $5 on slot machines. But to have two kinds of fried clams again? Heck yeah I'd go back! 

If you don't like places where employees are likely to socialize with you, with a business owner that treats his customers like friends... you should probably skip Lazy Joe's.",3ygnjwzBMaEWRAxCQMd8dQ,6,4,5,59j8CrcY35YBCJHsx7ldoA

For a starter, I got a small (8 oz.) clam chowder which is done New England style.  It was excellent and it was served mouth burning hot!!  I had a bottle of hot sauce on my table I'd asked for.  The cook asked me how I liked his chowder (Joe, perhaps?) and he asked if I used the hot sauce in the chowder.  I had not, but i saved enough to give the chowder a good shot of the hot sauce.  It is great!  Next time - hot sauce in the chowder from the get go!

I had the large (12) fried clams.  With it I got the seasoned fries (included with the meal) and cole slaw.  Two hush puppies come with this meal, too!  I got a small iced tea.  Refills allowed. 

You order at a counter and then the staff brings your food to you.  The seasoned fries were very good.  I found myself using hot sauce more than the tartar sauce for my clams.  I agree with Candace that there's too much mayo and not enough acidity to balance the mayo.

This is a nice place to stop for a different dinner.  I'm not sure I'd make the trip there often, but it's a good alternative.

It's late afternoon, almost 2 pm and I am customer number 4 of 4.  Not a big crowd but it's way past lunch, right?  I've read good things and I trust Yelper's opinions so I rock a two piece cod and take a seat in the now totally M T echo chamber... Was that a pin drop? 

Okay, I'm goofin' around here; the place is empty but I'm here to sample some brilliant F&Cs not do a line dance. 

My F&Cs are done right quick and served with a smile. Two big hunks of fish a litle larger than a fat wallet and Real Fries!?!?! Everything is a perfect golden brown. The fish is meaty and dense with a crisp crust.  The fries, though not crisp, are perfect. I believe that the water content in real taters is too high for crispiness.  

Included with the PHAT fish and tasty chips are cole slaw, tarter sauce and dos peros de los silencios... Two Hush Puppies... 

The slaw is good. Cold, crispy, creamy, flavorful etc.... The tarter is good.  Creamy, tart, fatty... Etc. Balsamic... Check!

Bite! Hot! Hot! Hot!!! But GOOD! Not the ""best"" I've ever had but good. Dang good! Just puttin that out there. 

I'm from Washington state, home of Ivar's Acre of Clams, where even the F&Cs at Dairy Queen rock! Okay, so now that my pedigree is established, you know where I'm coming from.   A gentleman came by asking how's the food.  I told him great and asked where he gets his fish.  I explained I'm from Washington State and caught a lot of Ling Cod in Puget Sound.  He told me he has a Broker from Boston that provides his good seafood. Atlantic Cod is okay with me.

BONUS! All you can eat F&Cs on Thursdays to Sundays... Whatch out NOW!  $10.95... Nice!

Pick 4 and you have a true fisherman's platter.  Be sure to substitute Onion Rings for fries.  Nothing is battered frozen imitations - it's all battered in the store immediately before frying.  

Cole slaw is good.  Lobster rolls are not bad.

I went through and read all the other reviews.  I had a couple of things to add.  One is that this place calls itself a Fish N Chips place, but let's be honest.  The phrase Fish N Chips brings to mind the English classic.  Don't go here to get English style Fish N Chips.  The batter is a corn meal batter that is used all over New England not Old England.   It's not a puffy flour based batter.  It's a light thin corn meal batter.  It's also not a southern style fried fish place.  I see the owner saying he can vary the spice to give you different seasonings, but if you don't say anything you will get a mild batter which is what I prefer.  They also don't have Pacific fish species like Halibut.  They have North Atlantic seafood like Haddock and Cod.  I believe they also have catfish.  Needless to say these fish are going to be frozen because unless you live next to the docks, you're not going to find truly fresh fish in most places of the world.  We live in a desert.  The only place that have truly fresh fish in Las Vegas are going to be 5 star restaurants that fly fresh fish in daily and charge $50 a plate.  That's not what this is.  I've eaten New England seafood for over 40 years and this is as close as you will find in Las Vegas and I have looked.",Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g,2,0,5,mA0WT6hgg7Og2KACAActSw

Con's
1) Our food took a while to get out to us...about 20 minutes or so. Patrons who came after us received their food first.

Oysters were cooked a bit past golden and were rather salty (I expect oysters to be briny but this was brine with added salt). The scallops were decent-sized but the batter was pale and falling off.

Second time here, my friend and I were the only customers. We both got a fish and chips combo. Comes with 1, 2 or 3 fish fillets, fries, coleslaw and a hush puppy. I ordered this instead of my usual preference of fish sandwiches because I really wanted to try the hush puppies. We got our food and there were no hush puppies. I asked the guy ""don't these come with hush puppies?"" and he said ""oh we're out, they'll be here tomorrow."" Ok how does that help me?? We should have been told that they were out beforehand or at least been offered something else in replacement. 

The fish fillets were so small. Definitely not worth $8.49 for 1 scrawny fish fillet, a small side of fries, a small cup of coleslaw, and no hush puppy. 

Additionally, the food was bland. Fries were bland and kinda soggy, fish batter was super bland and the fish didn't really have a taste. 

The guy that normally works there (the one that's always sitting outside when it's slow) is rude and has pretty bad customer service. I don't know how its possible that he's still working there with all these bad reviews about him. He must be related to the owner or something.

Food was really good! Fries are seasoned and very tasty! Son's chicken & fish was moist and full of flavor. Husband said that his platter was good and mentioned that his oysters tasted ""Clean"". Anyone that eats oysters knows what that refers to! The breading wasn't thick but very tasty. 

I loved the scallops, they were cooked perfectly but the only thing that I suggest is to eat them as quickly as you can, try to not let them sit too long. The characteristic of scallops is that they are really juicy, so if you let them sit there for too long, the juices from the scallops will start to leak out and they start to become soggy. That's the nature of the scallops, nothing to do with the restaurant.

Decor was very cute! And the staff is so nice. The owner, Joe, talked to us and was super friendly.

4336224,2015-05-27,0,UAMTM6LMA2on079oBMFBPQ,"I pondered for months about whether to purchase a groupon and now after eating there today I wish I hadnt.
We first went at lunch time but power was out in the whole shopping center so we left and came back for supper at 6pm. We walked in and a man was sweeping, no customers but a line quickly formed behind us because the man at the register needed help punching in our whole order. He easily took my groupon and marked it redeemed but the register baffled him and we had to show him eveeything we wanted on the take out menu so he understood. Even so he had to have the other guy who was the cook come over to help him, took about 7 minutes to just place our order. I noticed he also had trouble with all orders of people behind us, he obviously wasnt the normal register guy. After ordering a 2 piece fish one cod and one haddock and one ipswich clam we take a seat to wait. By this time all tables are full and our meal comes quickly enough but hushpuppies were missing and hubbys clams had mysteriously turned into scallops. A quick chat with the guy cooking brinfs clams soon enough and he got to keep the scallops though to me they seriously looked like tater tots. I couldnt tell a difference between my 2 pieces of fish and I have no idea if it was actually different or not. It was blonde in color not nice brown and crispy like shown on their menus, that disappointed me right from the start and the fish was bland,  nothing that i would ever ever want to have again.

I think the new owners wanted an established place to sell their Mediterranean food and maybe this was a good price but they have no idea what they are doing with fish and all orders placed after ours came out wrong, not due to the chef but I think the order taker had no idea what people were actually asking for.  No cook could ever mistake clams for scallops, it's the only thing that makes sense! My advice...DONT GO!

They use Gluten Free flour and cook in a natural oil so the batter is light and doesn't fill you up or make you feel like you ate a brick. 

You can also choose between white and sweet potato fries. The coleslaw is good but needs some help in the seasoning department. 

The only downside is that you may have to wait a while for your meal if there are a lot of people in front of you. But to me it's worth it for fresh cooked seafood!

4744341,2010-04-18,4,UAMTM6LMA2on079oBMFBPQ,"Earlier this week I was in Escondido, CA on business, and for lunch we went to the Sandcrab Cafe.  The fish and chips there were awesome, but oh so covered in fried batter.  My coworker, having not really had much fried food in his diet as of late, got a mean talking to by his stomach.  I, on the other hand, suffered from a bout of the itis.  Mmm fried food.

So here I am on a Saturday afternoon wondering what to put in my belly.  I was driving down South Rainbow, planning on getting something quick at Fausto's, when I saw Lazy Joe's Fish & Chips nearby.  Now the only other fish and chips that I enjoy here in Vegas is at the Crown and Anchor; mostly for the fish.  The fries there are just okay.  I decide to skip Fausto's and head into Lazy Joe's to get my second helping of fish and chips this week; and I'm glad I did.

I got myself the two piece cod meal, which came with seasoned fries, cole slaw, and two hush puppies.  The other two fish choices were catfish and hughglej...yeah, I don't remember.  I *think* it started with an H though.  The thing that surprised me was how the fish turned out.  It was delicious, but also didn't have that ""fresh out of the fryer"" layer of oil on the outside that seems to be typical.  All food is cooked to order, which is obvious when you try to take that first bite of fish (and then proceed to do the rapid ""inhale-exhale"" with the food still in your mouth, instead of, you know, taking the food out).  The batter on the fish did not overpower the fish, it complemented it in that you didn't feel like you were eating batter with a little fish filling.  The fish fillets were a good size, with me feeling very satisfied at the end of the meal.  The seasoned fries were great as well.  See Michael W.'s review for a more in depth look at the fries.

All in all it was a very satisfying meal.  With a bottle of water it cost me $10 and change for my meal.  After finishing my meal I noticed that they had a sign with a special for all you can eat fish and chips for $10.95 or so; better deal?  Yes, but I was already stuffed after two pieces of fish.

I wasn't aware this place was gluten free. The fish wasn't seasoned, there was a watery substance in the basket my fish was in so within moments the barely crispy batter got soggy and separated from the fish. The fries were okay but some of them got soggy too. In my opinion, just about everything on the menu is grossly overpriced. The customer service was good, but that doesn't get me full.

Unfortunately, it seems they have again decided to turn the place into a half fish and chips and half Mediterranean restaurant.    Its really a bizarre combo.    The original fish and chips recipe from over the years at this place was fantastic and moving away from that doesn't make such sense to me.

The fries changed.   They are nearly as good as they used to be.   Before, it was clear they were fresh cut potatoes..  that is no longer the case.

The quality of the shrimp now, its just not as good.     

The cod is still just about as good as its always been.     

Still no hush puppies and no more AYCE.  

I will say the service is good.. the new folks seem to be a little more on top of things service wise.

My wife had the fish and chips, 2 pieces, (1 each cod and haddock) of fish and upgraded to the Greek fries, which ate fries with feta and spices. Fish was cooked great, white and flaky.

joe is a hard working man.  his mission is to offer a quality product and true customer service.  how can we as comsumers go wrong.

here are the top points:

1. if you are alergic to gluten, this IS the place.  there is absolutely NO gluten on the premises.  so there is no chance of cross contamination.

2. he prepares all the food by hand.  EACH shrimp is deveined and detailed.  has anyone ever been to a place like this at this price point?  i think not.

3.  the haddock is seafood gold.  my first time tasting it and im a big fan.  It is very buttery.  he is one of the few places that has it.  this alone has made a customer for life.

4.  fried food brought tears to my wife.  she hasnt tasted onion rings, calamari, fish.. in YEARS.  too bad he doesnt have a location in socal.

5. nothing is from a bottle/premade.  he makes everything on his own.  (ok, except for the ketchup and condiments) but the slaw, batter, etc is all from a secret recipe.

bottom line, if you have celiacs or a gluten allergy, this place will bring you back from the sadness.

But le sigh, the entire time I was eating I was somewhat disappointed... For the price I paid, I feel like I've eaten better elsewhere.

ORDER: I ordered the Super Combo. Since it was my first time, I wanted to sample what this place had to offer. This order came with 1 fish, 2 shrimp, 2 oysters, 2 scallops, 2 clams, 2 hush puppies, fries and cole slaw. I'm no fish connoisseur, so I went with the haddock because the owner said it was the best; but you can choose whatever fish floats your boat between that, cod, and catfish.

BATTER: Seemed like everything was dipped in a universal batter. It was quite thick and completely unseasoned--heavy spices aren't common for fish & chips. But maybe a little sea salt? I had tartar, cocktail, ranch, and some buttermilk-y sauce which was awesome... but I still felt like my meal was missing something!

SEAFOOD: The fish was cooked perfectly: most & flaky. The shrimp were cut kinda funny--couldn't even tell they were shrimps until I bit into it--a little tough if you ask me! The clams and oysters had to be my favorite part. I love that clean ocean-y taste; the seafood they use here is pretty good quality! 

SIDES: I upgraded to sweet potato fries for an extra $1. Totally worth it. What's not to love about the holy fried sweet potato?? Crisp on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. I'm crazy about fried mushrooms so I went with an order of that for another $3.69. I'm not a fan. The mushrooms here are bland and quite rubbery. Not ordering those again.

SERVICE: Excellent! The owner was working the register and preparing the food. She was so sweet and gave me some recommendations on what to eat. Everything is made fresh. It serves up pretty quick--within 10 minutes or so.

OPTIONS: If your dining partner doesn't like seafood, they do offer other options like chicken fingers and chicken wings. They also have sandwiches like the lobster roll and soft shell crab sandwich which I really want to try. 

I was half satisfied with my meal. I think if I come here again, I need to order something a little different. I require heavily seasoned foods and that's probably the reason why this place isn't on my hitlist. Also considering I spend $23 and wasn't pleased with my meal somewhat irked me a bit--a little pricy!

We were already craving some seafood so we thought why not?

I ordered the fried mushrooms and the 2 pieces of fish + chicken tenders combo, it comes with fries and cole slaw.

The mushrooms could've been fried a lot longer, I didn't appreciate the hot juices from the mushrooms spewing out when I bit into them which actually kinda burned my lip. The batter could be better, didn't stick to the mushrooms well but for the price ($4.99) the amount of mushrooms you get we're reasonable.  

Now for ($10.99) combo we ordered, you get to choose what kind of fish you would like with your tenders and I believe it's a choice between: cod, catfish, tilapia and haddock - we opted for catfish. Now we LOVE fried catfish so we had some high expectations on this haha. The 2 pieces of catfish were really juicy and tender and crispy. They were well seasoned and pretty big in size for what you get! I love the end pieces since they're crunchier. Chicken tenders were average, nothing special about them but also good in size. Cole slaw was not my favorite, way too watery for my liking and seemed kinda bland. Fries remind me of diner fries, well seasoned but not too crunchy - most of the fries were quite soggy.

Overall, this place is OK for a quick take out of fish & chips. It's the only fish and chips place around where I live but I would def look for other options in this area. Again, I used a promo code w/grubhub on this order totaling only $4.30 + $2 tip so not to shabby for a decent delivery meal!",7kM0cE5UfCirNA2it1O2Qg,0,0,3,fTrt7iooBMpvRBUTdroosg

Unfortunately what I received was nothing like what I was expecting ( now I notice that the picture of lobster rolls from this place are outdated...years ago). In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't actually using lobster - tasted/looked like shrimp to me. Glad my sister who is allergic to shrimp didn't order a ""lobster"" roll for herself. Should have known something was going to be off when the waitress asked if I wanted mayo on my roll....
My sister and husband's gyro wraps were also non-traditional. Came served on a tortilla wrap as opposed to a pita  and had pickles in them.
The only good part of our meals were the French fries that came on the side!

Also the 20% off for the Yelp check-in is a LIE! We didn't receive an itemized receipt and the waitress assured us that the discount was given. But A check totaling $26.97 pretax shouldn't be $30 after 20%off. 
Definitely a waste of money here",U-lHUPZbG8R7Bqxzq8X_lQ,2,0,1,mUBEgehKcRNFAeJeqC7OVQ

       - The fryers are situated 10-20 feet from where you're sitting so prepare to smell like grease. That probably also explains why everything felt sticky.
       - Fried Catfish seemed moist and flakey but were a little too greasy and lacked the flavorful cornbread breading of other places.
       - 1lb of steamed clams seems like a lot more food than it actually is.
**Price**
       - $24 for two.
**Ordered**
       - 3 Catfish Fillets with fried, cole slaw & hush puppy - The catfish was moist, but extremely greasy. The seasoned fries seemed a little undercooked.
       - 1lb of steamers (steamed clams) - With the buttery gravey, cholesterolicious, but not very filling.
**Recommendations**
       - Maybe I just caught them on a bad day, but I wasn't seeing what the other yelpers were saying. I'll probably give them another shot based on the other reviews.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,1,2,f3u8jgJNBBkKm97yA2IHNw

When we first arrived, he sat us down, and explained everything to us.  Specials, prices, onion rings made on premise, fries are cut on premise, mozzarella sticks are home made, NE clam chowder wasn't ready yet b/c we were alittle too early, where the fish comes from {Maryland/Gulf of Mexico/Boston}, what he makes, how he does it, how the process works, how long he's been there {almost 5 years}, how old he is {I'm not telling}, his past business {a deli in Cali}. Super friendly guy and not in a creepy way, very very nice homey place.

All you can eat fried cod and shrimp w/ coleslaw, fries, hush puppies {$12.99} add a drink w/ tax just shy of $17.00 and you will be STUFFED to the gills.

He also knows the calories of his items!!!! 75 calories per piece of fish, 120 calories for 4 shrimp, etc!  And he fries in Soy oil to make it as healthy as possible.  We all had a lovely time and sitting down and talking to a fellow Easterner is always a pleasure.

Only thing I can say it was tad warm in the restaurant, so my only suggestion is to turn the A/C down about 5 degrees. 

Lastly, if you a pressed for time, go to their website order, and he'll have it on the table ready for you when you get there :). Not that it takes long but that's the kind of service Joe has at his place.

This is a very small, unassuming place in a strip mall. Not much on ambiance. If you take a date there, she will not be impressed and you won't get another date. 

On Friday's they have an all you can eat shrimp special and that is what we had. I've never had gluten free deep fried shrimp before so I can't compare it to other gluten free places, but I have had my share of regular fried shrimp before and I can tell you this place just doesn't compare.

The shrimp lived up to their name and were on the small side. The gluten free batter was okay, but rather flavor-less. Maybe it's really good for gluten free, but if you aren't gluten free you can find much, MUCH better deep fried shrimp with little to no effort. Honestly, Long John Silver's has better fried shrimp.

The service was fine and the owner did come by to check with us and make sure everything was good. That was very nice, but honestly, if you aren't eating gluten free there is really no reason to come here.

5688102,2013-04-24,10,UAMTM6LMA2on079oBMFBPQ,"So I was craving a Good fish and chips and I thought hmm how about the fish place next to Faustos. I looked at their menu online and at first was turned off by their prices however I wanted what I wanted. I got 3 of the first mate dinners. All with cod, one with shrimp and the other with scallops the last all cod. For $12.99 you get a choice of 2 out of 5 seafood choices, fries, 2 hush puppies and some coleslaw. I didn't want my scallops deep fried and the owner who was very nice ask me if I would like them Pan Seared and I was very happy and pleased as I accepted his offer.  I also wanted to treat my kid to a fun drink so I got a $1.89 bottle of some locally made root beer. Neither one of us enjoyed the root beer... The carbonation tasted stale and it had a bad aftertaste. So our food is ready and I proceed to drive 3 minutes to my home.  I get home and the food Looks Amazing!  The fries were homemade, a little salty but good. I think if they did the double fry method they wouldnt be so dark and would taste better. The fish quality was superb tender, flaky and juicy and the crust was different but cool. The only quams about the seafood was its total lack of seasoning.  There has to be a little to help enhance the natural flavors. The cole slaw was also.flavorless, mayonaissy cabbage. They need to pick up the flavors in their cole slaw, I think a bit of dill relish and some black pepper and Bam! I didnt care for the tartar sauce, it was sweet and I prefer a more savory tartar sauce, in fact a savory sauce would have complimented the fish better.   My hushpuppies were tiny a little over cooked on the outside and little under cooked on the inside BUT THE TASTE WAS DELICIOUS. I really enjoyed them. Now remember those scallops he was going to pan sear for me, in garlic and butter no less, not SEARED at All! The sear would have been perfect to compliment the texture of the scallops. They were not very seasoned either but tender and not overcooked.  I think if they took a chance and made some better culinary executions, that this place would be packed all the time. At first I was upset at the flavorless fish than I read the reviews and saw it was gluten free. Ah haaa I said however Gluten free doesn't mean taste free. Celtic sea salt is healthy and flavorfull and good for you. I finished half my meal, my kid too and my brother ate the whole thing. The quality of the food is Amazing the execution needs a bit more love. At the end of the meal all I kept saying was how I should have ordered the Lobster Roll. For gluten free I think the quality is great and should be packed with gluten free people. There was only one couple eating there and as we were waiting a man came in to eat. Update the interior design, makr a few key culinary decisions and Voilà I bet they would be the next hit Vegas place on diners driveins and dives!",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,14,11,3,VqdyZbRerTdVIMqYPYVdJg

1.  I am originally from Rhode Island and the sea food on the west coast tastes bland.  So, apart from everything else, the quality of food that they make their dishes with is enough for me to give five stars.
2.  My daughter has celiacs disease.  It is near impossible to find a place that will make a four year olds favorite food without worrying if they understand what gluten-free really means.  
3.  The prices are affordable.  Sure, from the outside this looks like another strip mall greasy spoon but the food is so good and the owners are really invested in making your experience great.  It reminds me of home and I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place.

One small issue (it's just a personal taste one), the lobster rolls are made with onions and celery.  I WISH it was just mayonnaise but unfortunately most people love a little crunch in their lobster roll.

I had sat down and was disappointed seeing how I came in at 1230 and I was the only one there and sat on a sticky table. Like really, you didn't have time to wipe this down? None the less, the food came out quick and it was quickly over looked.
