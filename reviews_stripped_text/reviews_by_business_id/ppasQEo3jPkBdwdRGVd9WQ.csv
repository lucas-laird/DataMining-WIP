But when two of my kids said that they were hungry and want to go to Roberto's Taco Shop ""my 8 year old daughter call it the place with the good beans and cheese burritos"" I could not say no to them or my pansa I love the chile Colorado burrito but I always have the girls their put some cheese on it. And now that we walked here I guess I'm going to be frizzing all the way back home, but it is always less cold back home because we are leaving here with our stomach's warm from the good hot food. It's always worth the cold walk to get the hot food if you can come up here try their carne Asada Fry's they are worth the. Walk day or night",KLGy5BWaYA958CTK0dLhsg,0,0,5,XvgqrXP-6CDf9D_jYVWBPg

Carrot and jalapeno salad worth trying--better than most. Somewhat shady neighborhood, especially after dark--best for lunch.

My husband and I did a quick stop at Roberto's by Nellis AFB and order two Carne asada fries and as I was grabbing red sauce I seen something crawling out of the salad bar. It was a cockroach! I've never been so disgusted in my life. The two people that were working there didn't make it any better. Soon as I spoke to the guy about the roach he had no idea what to do so he called the manager and I'm assuming he didn't answer and decided he continue cooking. I brought it to their attention the second time letting them know the roach was still walking around the salad bar.  I made sure to take pictures and video. I will definitely call the health inspectors.,-tbYzspdPLIsb_dY4ufcrQ,0,0,1,iomHdNXYEsyNWUqHViCMeA

The cashier was bland the first time I went here. Oh well, right? Second time I came here, the cashier (different one) was separating change, saw me, and looked back down until she had separated all $7.62 of the dimes and nickels someone had paid with. Okay, fine.

I told her my order in English (six breakfast burritos- two potato, two ham, two bacon). Then she gave me a death stare and asked what kind. I didn't get a ""hello"" or ""thank you"" or ""please sign here"" when she put my credit card receipt on the counter and walked away. I had asked her for pico, which she didn't ring me up for, and then she tried charging me $7 for pico, which comes in free-flowing abundance in other places. Forget that noise.

Also, I used to work in a Spanish-speaking kitchen when I was younger, so to hear the cashier and cook talk trash about me while I was waiting for my food is totally uncalled for. I suppose if you don't speak any Spanish and can tolerate surly angst from a $4 burrito joint, it's still possible to go there when everything else is closed.",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,1,1,1,SCItw88htELkep83dM3XlA

You order through bullet proof glass.  The clientele there range from pimps, hookers, gang-bangers, and old folks that will ask you for bus fare.

This is not my favorite of the Roberto's that I have been too.  The food quality and clientele is better elsewhere, and I'm not being bugged by people for money or food, or feel like my life is endangered just by ordering food there, but of all the Roberto's, this one has the most character, and it's close to Nellis AFB.
Here I had a chicken taco (it was only 99 cents on Wednesdays!) and a pork torta (forgive me, there is a proper Mexican name for this, but it slips me, and is not worth the time to look up),  The meat in the torta was almost non-existent.  I have had it in another location and it had plenty of pork in it.  The chicken taco was great though.  Crunchy taco shell, just the right amount of cheese on top, and messy.  You can't beat them for the price.

First off coming here late a night is a bad idea. The salsa bar was a buffet for local bums. While we were waiting for our food, we saw 2 different bums walk in and grab carrots and ice and then walk out . 
When we ordered there was no one else waiting for food so we thought naturally that we would get our food rather quickly. Not the case, 2 orders went out before we got our food an when we did it was sitting on the queuing rack. I must've been there for at least 10 minutes. 

When we finally got back to the room eat our food we were disappointed with what we got. 
First the carne asada fries were a disaster. The fries were undercooked and raw and the carne asada was nearly burnt to a crisp. There were tons of black burnt bits mixed into the fires as well. We had to fish though the entire box and pick out the burnt chunks. Every other piece of meat was burnt on one end so even the ""safe pieces"" weren't edible. See my pics of the  dish if you don't believe me.

The cantinas tacos had the same problem. The carnitas was old and hard like jerky an could not be eaten w/o breaking a tooth. 

The only thing that was ""normal"" was the rolled tacos. 

Another major mess up was there was guacamole on everything when I specifically asked for no guacamole since the GF is allergic.

We hate to waste food but none of this was edible. If you dont believe me look at the pictures I uploaded... 

The place is not on par with the other Roberto's that we have eaten at. I don't want to thrash a business but there are many things that need to be taken care of at this location. I'm sure that this place would be a health inspectors dream... 

Shame on you Mr. Roberto for this place.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,4,2,1,_aowdtGYrM5ghzuztoapWQ
