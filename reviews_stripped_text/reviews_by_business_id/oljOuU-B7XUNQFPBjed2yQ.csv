11010,2012-09-03,0,oljOuU-B7XUNQFPBjed2yQ,"I would not recommend this restaurant.

We had a party of 9 and we waited at least 30 minutes from the time we ordered until our dishes arrived.  And that wasn't even the worst of it.  When we tried to tell the busboy, waitress, and manager, they all adopted a ""not my problem"" attitude.

First we ordered water.  The waitress brought a tray of water and just left it on a nearby table.  This is in Las Vegas, where people tend to get thirsty after a long, hot day.  After a few minutes we were about to get up and serve ourselves when another server finally put the water on our table.

Then there was the long waiting period from the moment we ordered until our food arrived.  It took so long that we started to check our watches, so I know that it took at least 30 minutes until the last person got served.

The first person was served in 15 minutes.  Then, one by one, the dishes slowly came to our table.  The first person actually finished her dinner before the last person was served.  I was the second-to-last person to be served.  The last person was a 13 year-old boy.  I decided to wait until he got his plate, and it's a good thing I did because our waitress then came by, grabbed my dish, and said, ""You got the wrong dinner,"" before hurrying off with it.  There was no apology.  No ""Sorry for the mix-up"".  She just grabbed it and left.  That means someone else in the restaurant also got their dish late, and might've gotten a dinner that was partially eaten.  The waitress didn't even check.  Ten minutes later, my dish arrived, so I ended up being the last to be served.

When we tried to tell a busboy about the long wait, he simply said, ""There are a lot of dishes"" -- as if it's not his problem, and that there's no one he can mention this to.

When we tried to tell our waitress how long our wait was, and how bad the service was, once again, she didn't apologize and didn't even offer any explanations.  We asked for the manager and she simply shrugged and brought him over.

I told the manager how long we'd been waiting and he adopted a very defensive attitude.  When I asked him who his manager, or the owner of the restaurant was, he simply said that the restaurant was owned by a corporation and that I should contact ""Vivian"" (whomever that might be).  In other words, he not only wouldn't acknowledge the problem, he wouldn't take responsibility for it, nor give us an easy way to inform anyone else.

It took three discussions with the manager before he finally let go of his ego, apologized, and offered to look into the problem.  To his credit, he also took my dish off the bill.  But the cost of the meal isn't important.  The problem is with the ineptitude of the staff, and the attitude of the waitress, busboy and manager.

The final insult was that the bill came with an automatic 18% gratuity.  That's because we had a party of nine.  So the staff gave themselves an 18% tip for giving us bad service.  When the tip is automatically included, that takes away your ability to vote.

Before you come to this restaurant, imagine that you'll wait a long time for your dinner, get a lousy attitude, and that you might still have to tip them as if you got great service.  Then think of all the other restaurants in Las Vegas that you can give your money to and go there instead.",ahAvfTdZnblSR6S4ZpXCtw,0,0,1,UYzDjBxeXWCyMZtWUSNc6Q
20025,2013-12-24,3,oljOuU-B7XUNQFPBjed2yQ,"Came here for my 6 year old's birthday with the extended family; it was a busy night for them, and I felt quite bad for the wait staff. In the beginning part of the meal, they did a pretty good job with the service and the food was actually 4 star (tuna poke was a particular standout).

Then things got progressively uglier. Despite the restaurant slowing down, our waiter pretty much disappeared. Whenever he would come by, we asked him to bring out my daughter's birthday cake with candles that we had brought to celebrate. He told us at least twice that it was on its way...then 30 minutes went by. Both my kids are melting down, my 6 year old is crying on her birthday, the grandparents are falling asleep and I couldn't even find the waiter.

He finally reappeared and I asked him for the cake back and the check cause we had to go. Another 10 minutes and the cake and the check appear...with a mandatory 18% gratuity added on.

No apologies from the waiter, just our own cake back, a sad little girl, and a pretty much ruined evening.

So we walk out, then I realize that they didn't give us our candles back and we still needed to light them at home! 

Final straw, daddy really mad now. Marched back in and spoke to the manager who was very accommodating, removed the tip and found my candles (likely fished out of the garbage). 

The moral: great food, they try hard, they just happened to wreck a particular little girl's birthday dinner (for what that's worth).

Luckily, we washed the candles and had a great time at home!",urBMeIurWTdy6dsjy4iOzQ,3,0,2,uQqwocaeJMsCbohD_mhpJA

46901,2013-07-05,0,oljOuU-B7XUNQFPBjed2yQ,"First of all I have to say that I love Kabuki - the Town Square location anyway. Kabuki always has had a great atmosphere and design in their restaurants and the food is definetly good. I usually try to make a trip out to eat at Kabuki at least once a month. The kids were visiting for summer vacation and we just came from watching a movie at the Suncoast when I suggested we try out the location at Tivoli Village since we always enjoy our experience at Town Square. That was a mistake! We came during the week in the afternoon and the surrounding area was like a ghost town, like I was waiting for a horde of zombies to come running around the corner at any moment. Anyway, we got to the restaurant and it was just as nice as the other location. Besides the decor and the food thats where the comparisons ended.

Although a lot less busy, there was no one to greet us at the front. We waited for a good 5-10 mins before someone in the back finally noticed and came to greet us, even though there was a bartender and servers that saw us and never mentioned to anyone that we were standing there. We were sat right away.

I proceed to order my usual delicious appetizer, the Firecraker, and I decided to go with something else besides my usual Samurai combo, so I went with some ramen, which was good nothing I would order again. The main entrees came out in a resonable amount of time and everything was prepared great as it always is, however they never brought out the appetizer. I asked the guy who brought out our food about it and he said it was coming right up. It finally showed up when we were halfway done with our entrees and when our server finally came around to check on us I mentioned it to her and she apologized but after that she never returned to check on us. The least they could have done would have been to give the kids a free refill of their ""special"" soda for the minor inconvenience, but that would have been a long shot since no one ever even refilled our regular drinks. 

Overall not a good experience, customer service and attentiveness was just not there. Not sure what was going on that day but I felt like there should have been the owner hidden away in another room watching their staff on hidden cameras like that show on tv so they could see what kind of bad service their employees were providing that day. I will never visit this location again. In fact we went to the Town Square location a few days later and received the same excellent food and service I have come to expect from Kabuki!",WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,2,0,2,IjOM6Z0DDSXgT8OP2n8MPA

My wife ordered veggie roll which was good, and for myself its chicken teriyaki with bbq beef ribs.  They put my order in wrong as some dinner deluxe combination, and after being surprised when dinner is served i questioned the waitress on why i have extra food (shrimp, tempura veggies, etc).  I'm told that is what it comes with, okay...  This is not my first time ordering this dish at Kubuki as we dine at the town square location but i don't press it.  Then i start to eat the beef ribs, and i freakin break a chopstick trying to chew off this gristle.  This is not right the town square location these ribs are absolutely awesome melt in your mouth.  I inform the waitress these are not right, so manager comes by to apologize.  No offers to fix it, etc.  no big deal i just chalk it up to learning curve for this place.  Then i get the bill, and sure enough they charged me for the wrong entree.  Back comes the manager to correct it.  Then i try to pay the bill using my 15% off grand opening coupon i got at the town square location and the server comes back to tell me i cant use it with other discounts.  It turns out instead the manager applied some newspaper advertisement discount or something instead of taking care of the problem.  In the end she removed the entree and applied the 15% discount which is fine.  I would rather pay full price to have a relaxing and enjoyable meal but it just didn't happen here.  It was one thing after another, nothing like the town square location.  I might give this place a few months to get it together then try again.

939861,2013-04-21,0,oljOuU-B7XUNQFPBjed2yQ,"Kabuki solved the following problems...
1)  Our friends are a retired couple on a fixed income, always looking for the most bang for  the buck.
2)  Hubby hates to waste time eating.  (His words, not mine).
3)  I have nearly impossible dietary restrictions.  


We went for Lunch with friends Liz & John to celebrate hubby's new gig.  Liz & John both got the ""Ninja Deluxe"", which they have gotten in the past & they agreed it was excellant as always.  We have found Kabuki to be CONSISTENT!!   

Jim (hubby) got the Lunch sized  ""BBQ Beef"" & the Lunch sized ""Chicken Teriyaki"" with ""Brown Rice"" & ""Salad"". Hubby doesn't much like to eat, (he considers it a waste of time & has often said ""I wish I could run on batteries"" since eating takes him away from more interesting activities).  To my utter amazement, I heard Jim say ""Yum""!!  If you knew my husband you would know how earth shattering this is!!   

Now on the hard part""...feeding me.  The reason?...I became a Vegetarian in 2001 & don't eat meat or seafood.  I have found Asian restaurants to be a HAVEN for Vegetarians like me.  HOWEVER, now I can't have anything made with Milk, due to chemotheraphy induced neuropathy in my hands and feet.  KABUKI to the rescue...they have FRESH FRUIT for Desert...so no whining about not being able to eat the green tea ice cream!!  As if this is NOT ENOUGH...as a result of complications from my cancer surgery, I can't have anything with Gluten in it.  SOLUTION:  Kabuki has Gluten Free Soy Sauce...be still my heart!!
So I ordered the follwing:
1)  ""Fried Tofu"", ALWAYS DELISH, the breading is made with Rice Flour, so no Gluten issues here!
2)  ""Avocado Roll"", (I requested it made with Brown Rice).
BONUS:  ""Edamame"" (one of my all time FAVES) is included...this dish was fresher than fresh and AWESOME!!
3)  ""Mushroom Miso Soup"", their Miso Soup is ALWAYS superb...but the addition of Enoki & Shaitake Mushrooms made it DEVINE!!   My Oncologist told me I should eat Miso Soup & so this was both tasty AND healthy!!

BONUS:  Brown Rice is an option at no additional cost AND you can order it on ANY Roll!!

We have always had good service & the Tivoli Village location is just BEAUTIFUL!

The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is they brought most of my food about 15 minutes BEFORE everyone elses.  I guess they did this because I ordered an Appetizer & a Soup, my Roll came with everyone else's food.  I suppose I could have told them this was my Meal & not to be served before everyone else's food, but they could have asked when I did not order an Entree...jus' sayin'.

I guess that between my bad knee and her bad back, we've developed a fear of tatami rooms, so we've been avoiding Japanese restaurants.  Friday night, however, found us checking out Kabuki,

Orchid decided on beef teriyaki (combination plate), and I had the tonkatsu (pork) (also combination plate).  On the whole, well-executed, except for the fact that the pork tonkatsu reminded me of a plain American breaded pork chop.  Seasoned and prepared the way I would like a pork chop, but just wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  Orchid had Kabuki's version of fried ice cream for dessert, which she enjoyed.  The iced tea was quite well prepared, and the hot teal that we asked for with the meal was nice (but I wasn't expecting the large cups; I had rather thought we'd have one pot to share).

All in all, a nice ""something different.""  We will be back.

We ordered iced tea and there wasn't even ice in our glasses. I asked for sugar and the server provided a sugar container that was close to empty with 2 sugar packets in it.  I was so upset with the food and the service that I refused to leave a tip. Do yourself a favor if you want fresh sushi and great service go to Sushi Fever on W. Sahara. I even addressed these issues with the manager and there were no adjustments of the bill. To be clear when I visit a great sushi bar or restaurant I am a huge tipper if it is earned. I have left over $20 tips at sushi bars previously for two people. This place needs to go out of business. I would have been more excited to throw my money in the garage than wasting it on this old seafood!!! Please save your time and money.

Not to say their sushi is bad; it's just not the best I've ever had (hello, Osaka on Sahara). It's a little one-note and a little warmer than I like. But I was looking for sushi at happy hour prices, and Kabuki certainly fit the bill.

My husband and I sat at the sushi bar and split a pitcher of Sapporo (a steal at $13.95 for HH). We also ordered several rolls off the HH menu: Philadelphia and spicy tuna ($3.95 each), and Rose (shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and avocado) and Alaskan (baked salmon on a California roll) ($7.95 each). It's nice that they show you the regular price vs. the HH price on the menu, because that let us know that we saved $14--plenty of cash to get an order of hamachi sushi ($4.75) off the regular menu.

Service was good and thoughtful. They gave us a free bowl of edamame, which was a plus, and the sushi chefs gave us an amuse-bouche of okra slathered in something that tasted like peanut butter. (Not sure what it was, but it was pretty tasty!)

There are other things on the menu if you're not in the mood for sushi, but if you are in the neighborhood and you're looking for a good HH sushi experience, Kabuki is a good call.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,1,3,2ya3k3vB6zqf55MluI-wwA

A few minutes later a man in a white hat/clothes came behind the bar and let us know that since 'they close at 10, they had already called last call'.

At 2:30pm on this stormy day the place was almost empty.  We were greeted as if we were long time guests and our young server was very charming and attentive. My wife had the sake sampler and I had a Mai tai which was just the hit of sweetness I was looking for. We also had waters, which must be filtered as the water tasted fine. We started with the Edamame which was very tasty.  I ordered the Kabuki Lunch Special and my wife the Takoso sliced octopus appetizer and the Sashimi Salad.

Everything arrived promptly looked and tasted great.  My wife could not stop raving about the amount of fish in her salad and what a great deal it was. I loved every one of the options on my Kabuki Lunch special.

We finished by splitting a pot of coffee and the battered deep fried green tea ice cream.  Coffee tasted great, my wife loved the ice cream, but myself... not so much.

I do agree with the other reviewer it's not as a happy hour price, but the service and the quality of food were good which made up for it. Thanks to Kelly, she definitely has people skills! 

HH sushi ordered were Alaskan Roll, Asparagus Salmon, and Albacore Sushi tasted great. The portion of fish to rice was good. The Paradise Roll was tasty and I like the garnished sauce used (not a HH item). In fact, I love all the sushi sauces they used and that goes with the the calamari rings as well. The Tokyo Buns both had great flavors, but it would have been an excellent items if the buns were served warm. The slaw that came on the side I thought was fantastic! The Sake Sangria had too much ice and dissipated the flavor. This drink would have been great garnished with mint leaves.

This is my favorite Kabuki, located in the Tivoli Village. I like the patrons that dine here compare to the younger/tourist crowd at the Town Square location.

My husband and I first order wine.  The regular menu has average wines found at your local CVS, and then a few ""special"" wines, which are of better quality, but not deserving of the average $12/glass. 

We ordered an appetizer Beef with Sishito Peppers, which was only $4.95 but was too meager (like 2 bites each) and NOT reflective of the quanitty in the picture on the menu.  Not cool to gyp your customers like that. 

My husband ordered Philly Hand roll, smoked salmon Philly roll, and a crunch roll.  I ordered a just sashimi salad requesting the dressing on the side. Well all of my husband's order came out and the waitress told me the kitchen made my salad with the dressing and that it was being remade and it will be out shortly.  I was kind and said, ""No Problem"", quietly assuming it would only take just a few minutes ...I mean how long does it take a handful of lettuce and plop a hand full of cubed up fish, anyway?  Well even after my husband politely waited 5 minutes before I told him to start eating (I don't eat rice, so we don't share), he finished his entire meal and ordered some gyoza, which came out before my sashimi salad!  So our meal was not a shared ""awesome"" dinner experience, and was dampened as it was sorely extended by he eating his meal in front of me and for he to wait for me to finish m meal.  Obviously the waitress avoided asking how the meal was going, because she knew it was not going well. Nice one, Kabuki!

When I arrived home my two daughters and I were excited to eat our food.  
Two containers with Mushroom Miso were good we thought but the third container of Miso soup had no mushrooms but had a  piece of a plastic bag instead of mushrooms. Approximately 2""x1.5"". 
I called Kabuki and described the situation to a manager. It took him about almost 10 (!) minutes to realize what is going on. He asked me several questions about me and my order: where, when, how and what exactly I ordered. Several times I told him what my order was. Finally, I asked him how it related to a plastic and what he is going to do about the situation with that piece of plastic in my soup.  He thanked me for the information I provided and said he would go talk to staff and kitchen to do an investigation. I was really confused. Is that everything he had to tell me?
 He called me back in about 25 minutes. He said his name is Hoon and he thanked me again for giving him the information. Hoon said he is sorry and told me he did the investigation, and he does not know where this plastic came from.  He asked again and again a lot of questions, including the color, shape, and size of the plastic. I offered to even send him a photograph from my phone, but he said he didn't want it. Hoon guessed it came with mushrooms. 
-Ok, Hoon, so...? - I asked.
-Oh, Are you planning on coming back? (Good question, BTW).I think you are familiar with our menu. We will give you a bowl of miso and ONE roll at your choice for free. 
We have been loyal customers there. Bringing friends and family there and having lunch or dinner, spending thousands of dollars (what is easy to track with Red Mask card) we were honored with One miso and ONE roll FOR FREE. 
My daughter that had miso with me and I both ended up staying up all night and next morning with diarrhea and stomach pains.
We do not think we want to be back to that restaurant and would not recommend you.",ieXPqbbfVXz00f2NWAPQxg,0,0,1,6LuP6R8gQY5jCmtNAydAwQ

The staff are super nice specifically the bartender/waiter who i think was named James. It's been too long.

From what little we ordered the slices of fish were fresh and quality cuts with no hit of being anything other then the finest. 

The Garlic Edamame was absolutely amazing as well as nice and garlicy. 

Cocktails and Saketinis were nice and flavorful and pack a nice punch. 

See this people? This is why you should procrastinate on writing reviews. Because you absolutely forget all the selling points that made you enjoy the experience.

I had the Spicy Ramen which was made aware to me by our bartender that it's nothing more then over-glorified instant. My other option was a combo plate but that was just way too much food and double the price so i grabbed the ramen. Cant really compare it to any of the ramen shops because you have one that comes out of a bag against one that takes hours of boiling down bones then adding other magical mystical animals to give it the flavor you want.
What came out was a nice sized bowl of hot soup with chewy noodles and a lot of bean sprouts. Again it doesnt compare to any dedicated ramen shops but was good enough.

I'd give this place another shot if i was in the area but there's just so many other places to choose from.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,2,4,3SjY8GSeMALcXGCb7_wibQ

Not sure if it was because I'm sick at the moment or was grumpy because of the service but the food didn't have much flavor.

Ordered the agedashi (fried) tofu, spicy miso soup, and spicy chicken. Longer than normal wait for the tofu but I was definitely hungry by that time. I was disappointed to say the least. It looked appetizing but the tofu itself was clammy and slimy. The sauce itself was slimy...running off my chopsticks like runny egg whites. The other fare came out about 10 minutes later...again excited. The spicy chicken looked similar to the picture except for one big difference...it sat in it's own pool of oil. At first I thought maybe it was juice, but when I pushed it against the plate and ducked my napkin in, it was all chili oil. A LOT of chili oil. The food wasn't even that spicy. I picked off the top since there was no flavor in the oil other than smoked chili...80% was left on the plate. The spicy miso soup was my last hope but it too was gummy and oily. I think anything labeled ""spicy"" just means they use chili oil..not that they put fresh spices or anything else. My noodles were overdone and the only flavor was the red chili oil glazing the top of the miso. Maybe the sushi is better? Maybe food that is not spicy so its not swimming in oil?",r94mflaArQMJXJTkYkk3qw,1,0,2,By36_Am1f2UgGUBNHuwLiw
2196180,2012-08-30,2,oljOuU-B7XUNQFPBjed2yQ,"i've been going back and forth between 3 or 4 stars for a couple of days now.
what finally made me decide to go with 4 stars was the service.

the hubby and i brought his mom, dad, sis and nieces here for dinner.
what we didn't realize until after we sat down and got our menus was that it was a chain restaurant with locations in california, arizona and nevada.
not a huge chain, but a chain nonetheless and, boy, am i not a fan of chain restaurants.
to my surprise, kabuki serves up some decent fare for a chain restaurant.
believe me, i was worried.

we ordered quite a bit of food and our bill was still pretty reasonable.
it was likely because we ordered a few things from their reverse happy hour menu which takes place everyday after 9pm except sundays where it starts at 8pm.
they also have a regular happy hour from 5pm-8pm.

they definitely don't skimp on portions here.
even the appetizer portions are huge!
if i had known that we were going to get cheesecake factory sized portions, i would not have ordered so much!
we ordered the firecracker, mixed tempura, yellowtail carpaccio, soft shell crab, sesame chicken, pear endive salad, salmon skin salad, omakase special, albacore crunch roll, rose roll, mediterranean sea bass, tempura udon, slamon sashimi and the following nigiri - aji, kaibashira, 2 anago, 2 toro, amaebi, 2 hamachi toro and aburi kaibashira.

a few downers:
there was far too much rice on the nigiri pieces.
they serve you huge slices of fish but the rice is equivalent.
i was told that you can request less rice so i will try that next time because i only ate about 1/8 of the rice that they gave with each piece.
the fish appeared fresh and everything was very tasty.
there's nothing fancy about the sushi here.
i don't use wasabi and soy because it tends to drown out the flavor of the fish.
i eat it how it's served and i'm used to sushi chefs that use some sort of condiment, sauce or aged soy to enhance the flavor of the fish but they don't do that here.
they could certainly improve on their ginger as well.
albeit, it wasn't the pink stuff, which is great, but it didn't have the consistency or spiciness that i've become accustomed to.

our server, however, was phenomenal.
she was kind, attentive and very patient even after they closed and we were still eating.
i asked to have some yuzu squeezed on my scallop and she wasn't sure if the chefs could do that but when she brought our sushi order out, she also brought a small dish with yuzu juice in it and asked me if it was what i wanted.
heck yeah!
i was ecstatic!
she definitely went out of her way.
i've found that to be few and far between lately.

it's not on my list of ""go-to"" spots but i would dine here again.
now that i know how huge the portions are, i'll take it easier the next time around.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,5,4,4,_ef7AW1Deazoqikek5LL0g

We were seated promptly however the service was terrible. It was disappointing considering the waitress should have taken advantage of the slow business. She was also extremely shy and she rarely checked up on us. Usually I wouldn't mind, but my water was running out and it's hot in Vegas during the summer and I was dry as a bone. I started stealing my sister's water. Also the waitress wasn't available and we had to flag down another waiter to bring us plates. For the terrible service I would have only given this place three stars, but I came here another time before with a big group of my friends and we were served by a waitress named Sara and she was absolutely amazing! She always wore a smile on her face and checked up on our big party. Everyone was impressed. 
As for the food the sushi is always fresh and great! I got the spicy tuna which was only $3.95 for 6 rolls. Not bad at all! Also the rose roll and Vegas roll are a must! Additionally I got the spicy miso ramen which is not on the happy hour menu, but for $8.95 it comes with a big bowl of ramen and a side of salad which tasted incredible (:

We walked in at 9:00 (they close at 10 on weekdays) and were greeted at the door by Hana. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was relaxed and modern. One star for atmosphere.

Our waiter was Shelby, and he was very attentive and friendly...definitely took care of my boyfriend and I. He swung by to check on us regularly, which was nice because we never had to find him. One star for wonderful service. 

Just a heads up, their menu is very extensive. Be prepared to battle indecisiveness, because you'll want to eat everything. 

Now, the food. I REALLY wanted to give this another star, but my chirashi just wasn't what I was expecting. The sashimi was alright but the pieces were small, as were the ones in my boyfriend's teriyaki chicken/ sashimi teishoku. I understand that fish is not cheap, but if you are going to charge $17 for a bowl, it would be nice to have the portion sized accordingly. I'm from Hawaii where EVERYTHING is expensive, and I've had a cheaper yet more abundant chirashi there. However, my bf's meal was priced at $19.99 and came with a salad, tempura, bowl of rice, teri chicken, sashimi, and miso soup. That's a lot of food for one dinner, so maybe I just have to try other things on the menu. 

On the plus side, the chicken karaage appetizer was yummy, and all the plates were pretty. For dessert we had green tea mochi ice cream, which was also a little pricey for the two pieces it came with, but the ice cream's flavor was light and floral and rounded out the meal well. A third star for these points. 

Overall, not quite the authentic Japanese food I was craving, but there are a lot of fusion items and a vegetarian/gluten free menu that I'd like to try, so I'll definitely be back.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,2,2,3,9sIQOeaVu6dLoQkcDgRbhQ

It was perfectly mediocre. I ordered some gyoza and a bowl of ramen, really what i'd consider simple fare, and was underwhelmed. The gyoza were a notch above Trader Joe's, and the Ramen broth really lacked much flavor at all, until i liberally adulterated with peppers.

My brother and his wife adore this place, for the few items they order again and again - not very adventurous (they were not familiar with either gyoza or ramen - go figure).

From the moment we walked in the door, the service was friendly & above average. Our waitress marched to the beat of her own drum but she made us lol several times & was more than capable of accommodating all of our requests, etc. The funniest part was that she asked if there was a b'day, because there were gifts- we told her it was a going away party for one of our friends & asked if there was anything special they could do. We died when, after dinner, they brought out vanilla ice cream with ""happy b'day (& a heart)"" written in chocolate syrup & about 6 of them sang in Japanese (with some sort of jingly accoutrements). To the food!... We ordered the standard edamame & also the garlic one. Both were very good in their own rights. The garlic one smells very very garlicky when it 1st comes out so we were somewhat apprehensive but it was delish. We all enjoyed the miso soup (even those who aren't ""soup people""). We ordered a plate of the sesame chicken for the table to share- it was ok, it would have been better if it was white meat. I'm a salt kinda girl but it was walking a thin line of being too salty. The sesame ginger dipping sauce didn't help so we got a side of their self-proclaimed famous teriyaki sauce (dying for a sweeter balance!). Surprisingly, it wasn't that sweet- when it was all said & done, I opted to dip in soy sauce. It just seemed like alot of work for an appetizery dish! We ordered several sushi rolls- all of which were well received by our taste buds & tummies. There was also an order of the chicken teriyaki & an order of the beef one (to please the meat-&-potatoes guys). They were not skimpy on the meat &, at one point, I made the oxymoron declaration that I'd ""never heard them so quiet!"", as they munched away. In addition to the happy b'day ice cream, we ordered one of their chocolate squares to divvy up (it's scored so it was easy to share). It was unusual, it was scrumptious. In fact, I'd go back just for the dessert menu- there are a few other items I'd like to try! Was I blown away? No. But, based on location, ambiance, service & the overall pleasant experience, I'd be happy to go there again.",hd343st7cOIUSfAd5r0U7A,3,2,3,y8WufD1mv7NI7Ba8Bc36bg

It's kid friendly and they have a kids menu. The service is typical of any chain restaurant, attentive and responsive. I am always skeptical of mainstream Japanese restaurants who try to serve an extensive menu. They had both cooked food, sushi and ramen/udon. The lunch specials were reasonably priced with a few good options. My daughter loves udon and it passed her taste test with flying colors. I had the hamachi Kama or yellowtail collar the size was more than enough but maybe a little over cooked and the ponzu a little off for my taste. We also had the chicken salmon teriyaki combo which was a little overcooked too but a great portion for the price. We have high expectations for sushi so I rarely order from chain type restaurants so we didn't here. We are ramen snobs as well so unless it's recommended or a specialty item and not on the last page of the menu like it was here we stay away. They had a good selection of rolls so this might be a good place for the casual sushi eater. I would suggest this restaurant as a good lunch spot for the lunch and happy hour menu. They have good mainstream Japanese selections but nothing that exceeded my relatively high expectations. Overall good enough. We'll be back",orZu1n436kYnKy8CIcf29w,1,0,3,BkJOP4_QwWJO14D-Jed68g

Slightly spicy with sesame.  Miso soup excellent. My wife's teriyaki and tempura was plentiful and quite well done.  Tempura was lightly coated and dried perfectly.  Unfortunately sushi was poor.  Now the actual fish was fresh and tasted fine if somewhat dull. Rice was poorly seasoned.  And it fell apart when you went to eat.  Every piece I picked up the rice just broke apart.  Spicy tuna roll was not spicy and mostly just mushy tuna.  None of the sushi had any wasabi or flavoring. Just hunk a fish sat on top of a misshapen ball of rice.  I struggled with rating.  The kitchen won out.  I would definitely come back but not for sushi. There are too many good sushi places in town for them to serve this stuff here.

I highly recommend the Happy Hour if you like basic rolls and don't want the cream cheese-avocado-fried crawfish-salmon roe-rainbow tuna bomb; Happy Hour takes a dollar or two off of rolls you would already eat, like spicy tuna and salmon. 

The calamari here is surprisingly good. Very tender and light.

My friend got two of the cream cheese-avocado-fried crawfish-salmon roe-rainbow tuna bomb rolls of sorts, and they were both delicious and large portions. One thing they do not do here is skimp on the fish and ingredients inside a roll. I feel like you do get your money's worth.

With every meal they bring out edamame for free. While I do ignore these large-and-by, other people really enjoy having them, so that's always a perk. My friends like the garlic edamame here, which you do have to pay for.

I also came here for lunch once, and the Korean short rib lunch is really good. Reheats nicely for the next day and a good portion of food. Perfectly lightly sweet but not too sweet. 

Food here is simple but done well. Atmosphere is nice, and they are doing so well it looks like they are expanding to next door as well. I think it's a solid pick for a first date .",lUPSEbFRd3jDOM5agGnjWQ,2,2,5,na3G5b4MCCGcCsNjLjTB2w
2985654,2017-08-12,0,oljOuU-B7XUNQFPBjed2yQ,"This is now my new favorite place. Tonight will be the third night in a row my husband will be dining here. We stopped in on whim while strolling Tivoli and I'm so glad we did. It was love at first bite. Hubs has a gluten sensitivity so the first time he was weary and stuck to what he knows. The second time, I brought his sensitivity to the attention of our waiter, Josh. He was the absolute best ever! He immediately moved the soy sauce to my side of the table and brought my husband a bottle of gluten free soy sauce just for him. He then made sure all of my husband's dishes were properly prepared and ensured the dishes he and I were sharing were gluten free as well. The husband has had the seaweed salad, the sashimi salad, and a bunch of the basic rolls (salmon, 2 kinds of tuna, and scallop), which he says were incredible. We shared the chicken hibachi rice (GF) on the second night. I didn't think it tasted any different than the order I had the night before, when I didn't share with him, so I was really pleasantly surprised. I had the cucumber salad which was prepared different than I'm used to since it was prepared with no rice wine. Instead they use a ponzu sauce and sesame oil. It's different. Very unique. I can't explain how delicious it is. It's right up there with the outstanding cucumber salad from Andrea's, at Wynn (which is the best rice wine one). I've also ordered the yakisoba twice. Both times with chicken instead of beef. The first time regular chicken yakisoba. The second time I asked them to personalized it for me. I ordered it with no bean sprouts and no onions and no garnish (basically just chicken breast, yakisoba noodles and cabbage) and they made it perfectly. It's the best yakisoba I've had in Vegas so far (it's my favorite dish so I get it everywhere I can). 

TLDR; best overall dining experience in a while. This place will cater to your food sensitivity and allergy needs, as well as cater to your food needs even if your just a picky and simple girl like me. Also try the strawberry lemonade. They make it fresh in house and it is delicious!!!",W6rcI2OuYP_BCN1rzmgVOQ,0,0,5,kiblZf7Kokh3t2yVY9eUPg

The sesame chicken was a hit among our  friends.  It was perfectly seasoned and fried.  Unlike most sesame chicken which is tossed in sauce, it's served dry with a dipping sauce.  

With a party of 12, we pretty much ordered everything.  From the sashimi combination platters to the koshou beef, soba, unagi rolls, everything was really good.

Decorative place, nice atmosphere and again very busy. It took a abmormal amount of time to get drinks and order. As we were sitting awating our drinks we kept getting bumped and pushed from the servers grabbing sushi plates from the bar. This was extremely frustrating. They should have a server pick up area, not continually reaching over patrons who choose to sit at the bar. Drinks arrrive finally and they bring complimentary edamame. As we sat there we kept getting wiffs of some not so great smelling fish. This was definitely not a good sign.  We ordered tuna appetizer with jalapeños. Flavor was ok but the fish was very fatty and should not have been served imo.  Drinks were out at this point (draft beer served in a 8oz glass doesnt last very long) and again it took forever to flag down a server and forever to get them.  We ordered food directly from sushi chef.  We ordered 3 rolls in total.  All were just ok and all were rushed. You could really tell they didn't put much effort into it.  Sushi rolls fell completely apart before you could eat them.  Meanwhile, bad fish smells still are hitting us every few minutes. Probably won't go back. They should really consider revising the policy for servers picking up food over your head the entire meal. They should also consider more training into rolling the rolls so they are edible and not just a pile of fish and rice on your plate.

We didn't want anything fancy just a casual family celebration. Luckily we agreed he wouldn't be disappointed if it wasn't great being it was his bday. We typically frequent sushi Loca in DTS which has been great (after having our share of ACE sushi and appreciating quality over quantity these days) but we wanted to try a new sushi place.  We ordered from HH menu since it was available and the first round of crunch asparagus salmon was decent. We continued with 2 rolls of Alaskan and a crispy rice with tuna. We got our complimentary edamame after the first roll was already served but no big deal. And my husband ordered Sapporo but server convinced him to go with asahi on special. Although, after reviewing the receipt the Sapporo was actually cheaper on happy hour. So why convince him to get asahi  when HH of his choice was cheaper?? I hate when servers don't know the best deal or how to make customers happy. Anyway Alaskan rolls completely different than what we are used to. It was baked! We like fresh, raw sushi so this was a complete disappointment and  when I questioned  the salmon being cooked she said ""yes baked"" And didn't even ask if we would have preferred something else. She kind of got away real fast after seeing my disappointment. My 7 year old was so disappointed she took off the salmon  and said ""on a scale of 1-10 I give this a zero"" I wouldn't have gone that low as I found it tasty but I don't go to sushi places  for baked salmon. It was greasy and a piece  fell on my husband's new designer  jacket which is now stained with oils spots - no fault of theirs but for that, he won't be back. The crispy rice with tuna can not Compare to sushi loca! Lesson learned, you pay for what you get. Service was just ok. Nothing special. And the atmosphere was NULL! And I mean Nada, none.

It tasted like udon noodles in mulky seawater. The rest of the dishes were not much better. Their sushi did not taste fresh, the rolls did not have any taste, and the cod fish was dry. Basically, we did not like any of their food...

The service was average. The waitress was friendly and nice, but she was lost  half the time. We had to ask multiple time to get more water and drink. At least she was nice.

Last week they had a sake tasting party, which also happened to have a limited AYCE buffet of fresh sushi and a few beers.  Total cost for this event?  $25 flat.  That's better than a lot of the AYCE restaurants around town.  Granted, there were only a few different types of nigiri & rolls out, but the event was more about the sake.  I got to taste lots of (I assume) pricey sake, and a few typical Japanese beers.  The whole event was well run (if under-publicized) , and an amazing value.

As for the restaurant itself, I really can't review it.  From what I can tell, it looks like a ""normal"" sushi restaurant that is a bit overpriced.  I'd prefer to go to my hole in the wall AYCE sushi place around the corner for $21.95 than order from a menu and probably spend more.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,1,0,4,r44C5iOzNFC9FuKWYrGl0g

When I came in there with my family we brought a coupon with us that states ""buy one lunch combo and get a complimentary one."" By the time we paid, the waitress forgot about the coupon but she fixed it by making TWO of the lunches complimentary. We all thought that was very nice. We also got two appetizers. The crowd favorite was their calamari. The two sauces that comes with it are very addicting. One is somewhat spicy and the other is pretty sweet. I'll probably come back just for their calamari haha.

I have never been to the Town Square location but I understand it is a Southwest US chain so I imagine it is quite similar there.  The first time I was at the Yelp Rehearsal Dinner CMYE and my review chronicled my eating there, but I was thoroughly impressed with items on the sushi menu that are more rare here: suzuki (sea bass), aji (Spanish mackerel), hotategai (jumbo whole scallop) and anago (sea eel).  The jumbo scallop was massive and hung over the rice, and melted in my mouth.  We also had the geisha roll (I love how shiso leaf is a key ingredient) and the yellowtail jalepeno (delicious).  Eric R. was not too happy with the hibachi steak and chicken meat quality but everything else was great.  I also had the salmon skin handroll (they do not do them in a cone shape) and it was huge and delicious.  I had the usual iced green tea.  Our server Paul was great.

When I returned I sat at the sushi bar.  I was entertained by Chef Terry and Chef Bobby.  I ordered the aji tataki appetizer - the aji was not very tasty this time (I prefer sushi style I guess) - chopped awkwardly with green onion and ginger, with wakame and daikon on the side and ponzu sauce.  Skip this.  I asked the chefs their opinion and got salmon with green onion (belly cut, they understood my love of fatty fish), hamachi belly (with kaiware sprout), and the jumbo scallop again.  The scallop was much smaller but just as melt-y and fresh.  I freakin' love it!  The chefs were awesome and entertaining.  Chef Terry gave me a spicy tuna handroll with less mayo, added jalepenos, and spicy ponzu on the side.  I also had iced tropical green tea (unsweetened).  The handroll was not that amazing (tuna quality was eh) but Chef Terry told me he can do better for quality and cuts next time.  I had a $10 off $30 deal from the grand opening so this was a great deal on a meal.  They do have lunch specials, happy hours, and reverse happy hours so there is more to explore here!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,4,5,4,pjYAiKLnI3p1RkZQpQBtxQ

Water for some, but not, all in the party; salads delivered to us while miso soup (on same tray) sits cooling, unattended, at the empty table nearby. Pointing to the forgotten soup, it's brought to us, but no longer hot. Once hot soup showed up, it was definitely good. 

I like the option of small plates here - one of the ways to build your meal. Some in our party ordered individual sushi pieces and also the small plate of miso black cod. I had a taste of the black cod, and it was certainly ok, if not amazing. Seemed maybe a bit reliant on the sweet miso prep, rather than the natural sweetness of black cod itself. 

I ordered the Chirashi bowl - A decent collection of fish atop your choice of white, brown or 'sushi' rice. Tasted fresh, and pretty reasonable at just under $20. I got to try the shrimp tempura, which was pretty standard tasting - not exceptional. 

I ordered the Brussels sprouts, which was the one truly interesting dish of the night. Fun, almost like tempura. Flaky, crunchy and savory, this is absolutely something to try. 

A decent array of wine and sake and beer. Colorful interior at the Tivoli Village. You could do worse, but the enthusiasm of all the reviews I read here about Kabuki do not match my experience.",yvXEJcXRtffR2GuWULbRjg,3,2,2,D6DtC-6Jd9eGWDju1K3deQ

They give you $25 for your anniversary of being a member, $15 for your birthday, and every $250 you get $25 to spend. The money does expire but if you live sushi it's a good deal.

Such a great all around surprise.  After the many FAILURES of Tivoli Village, I was surprised and relieved as to how much I enjoyed Kabuki.  The only thing was that it was very slow service.  Our food and drinks took forever.  But great service nonetheless.  

ATTENTION All Restaurant Managers take note: Sung (whom I presumed to be the manager as he was the only one in a tie and dress shirt) is the best manager I have seen in the city.  He supports his staff.  He was on the floor the entire night bussing tables, taking drink orders, running food, running checks.  He, unlike most of the awful management here in Las Vegas was not above doing those things.  He looked like he had control of the restaurant, for he was not frantic, but very present.

Nahee, our server was very good.  She had a huge section, yet she kept her cool, spoke intelligently about the menu items.

Food was phenomenal.  Lovvvved the super rich, calorie ridden Alaskan roll.  Great fish - very fresh, with so much flavor.  Salmon skin, was a much simpler alternative which I enjoyed just as much.  Tempura was great.  Not as battered and heavy as I've had in other Japanese restaurants.  Just wish there was sweet potato in our mixed tempura.  Peach sakitini was pretty good, however I normally like stronger drinks.  Still, it was worth my curiosity.  

Dessert - Opera Cake.  Very different the typical mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream every other Japanese restaurant has.  Such a delicate taste.  Great ending to an absolutely wonderful experience!",hjHsvhrS6AJfx0rrEAWAIg,1,1,4,urABEAn254a2SKIGMyjMMA

I need my photo from another location that granted our request. I'm guessing they discontinued it due to cost. It was so delicious! Anyways on to tonight's experience. 

Came in on a Sunday night with the fam and was a bit disappointed. Maybe the Southern California locations have spoiled me. We ordered a little bit of everything. My favorite and it's safe to say the tables favorite was the appetizer small plate of the short ribs with the grilled onions. The tuna tartare was a waste of calories and money. I don't like have the mix my own tuna tartare and honestly speaking my chop sticks skills didn't help either. The assorted sashimi was so fresh and delicious but I know sashimi isn't for everyone. The rolls were mediocre but by far they very the best dragon rolls I've had. Some people at the table aren't big on sushi so it was a hit for them. Also, we ordered two other rolls I can't recall. They were ahhh alright. Average flavor.... it's hard to impress a sushi lover like me. Now for the second part of the experience as I like to refer to the service.... Man that was average too! Why it was average is beyond me. There is the same about of workers as customers for crying out loud. I couldn't even request a refill request from our actual server until a sweet lady in a collared shirt stop by to ""check on our table"".

The new Kabuki is a beautiful, modern spot featuring high ceilings and a pleasant patio. It is definitely a safe spot to bring a variety of people from a first date to your slightly adventurous grandparents. It is a nice environment, and they can accomodate larger groups.

Service is attentive, and they work to make everything right. We experienced a kitchen delay on our visit. We weren't event bothered really, but even without a complaint from us, they took $10 off our bill.

The menu is huge, so you are sure to find something for everyone, including kids! They boast an award-winning kid menu. One of my favorite things about Kabuki is that they will make any roll with brown rice! I ordered the Lotus On Fire with brown rice, and it is pretty much my sushi amateur ideal - a California roll with spicy tuna, lotus chip and thinly sliced jalapeno on top served with a side of crunch. That along with the sautéed asparagus appetizer are a perfect light dinner for me. 

The husband also tried their spicy ramen, and he was a happy diner. 

The beverage menu is extensive as well. It was late, so I didn't want to load up on iced tea. However, I noticed they had approximately five varieties of iced tea.

Would have paid double elsewhere. I will come back again fr sure!",bTUqFF4i4zQ8x2x5lTYslw,0,0,4,SO9AlLDdSPw3yueJ5B2E1Q

I went with my boyfriend late for dinner and we didn't have a reservation and the staff was great and so friendly. We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs make the rolls so quick. I absolutely loved the dragon roll they actually made it look like a dragon and it was fun. Also the kabuki roll with lots of fish on top, definitely would go back again",RVBhvRfflhkasj1lE3NLWw,2,1,4,nQu8nYZoudM6Aqazjcq-OQ

The food here is delicious. Never had s bad meal here. The prices are reasonable. They've got some unique menu items. The Sautéed Asparagus and Garlic Edamame are delicious appetizers. Sushi and Sashimi are great too. They've got lunch specials till 4pm with a good selection. Try it out you won't be disappointed.,qwBzdApvDLOu5wxDyPj3SQ,0,1,4,yZUbBKWeY-LnJ22FvfezAQ

Ordered 3 ""basic"" rolls... eel roll, yellowtail roll, and spicy tuna roll. The eel roll was just ok but the spicy tuna and yellowtail were way, way, WAY overminced. The rolls were not rolled very tight either or maybe it was because the roll had no structure due to the overminced fish. They kinda fell apart when you picked one up. The overminced fish was like eating sushi roll baby food. Not a fan. Service very nice but won't be back next time I'm in town. Baby food sushi rolls are not my cup of tea.",b4WR7VF4dRZUYnWSkEtq2A,1,0,2,d15AfOQBS9IDWyJyb5y-NA

The ramen was good,the broth was delicious and the most important thing but I look forward to the usually fragrant marinated egg with a custard yolk, their egg was not.  Very disappointed bc it was just a over cooked hard boiled egg with no seasoning. When a ramen places egg is good I always order extra.  All in all it was good place the broth made up for the bland ass egg.  So hopefully they'll read this and improve it",97bIIVHvtKGJbSwv2Slf9g,2,2,5,gqlyGIXnh04pUxm8R613-Q

We had such a wonderful order the last time we were here and order the same thing with totally rubbery disgusting chicken served to us today and not only did our drink order  never get filled but he had he nerve to insult us by stating that we didn't say anything soon enough.  We literally waved our hands for five minutes and waited for 10 minutes trying to get our servers attention who never even checked on us once our food arrived. I am a sales manager and this is completely unacceptable... When I asked to speak with his manager who was in the restaurant he said that he was only authorized by the manager to give a $1.70 discount .

I inquired about the vegan options and was assured everything was vegan except they said that there could be cross contamination in the tofu because it is made from an outside vendor.  I told the waitress that did not make sense (ultimately she was throwing her vendor under the bus) and she just sent the manager over.  I talked to the manager and wanted the fried tofu for my daughters and she told me the oil is the same that fries the fish.  I asked for it to be pan fried and her response was 'usually we don't but I will this one time just make sure you never ask for it again.'  I was floored.  Then to top it off as all the food was getting delivered she told me 'by the way I cancelled your order'.  She did not offer to make me something else.  We walked out at that point.  Go to town square- a million times better.,OZridIkufRtDQ5CeF2MdmQ,0,0,1,BGe_Z8fZsEU7XoxFuo7Rww

I can't say that a single topping really stood out as being particularly good, and the salmon eggs were a big disappointment. The eel nigiri had too much sauce on it.
