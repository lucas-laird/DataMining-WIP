2340324,2018-04-11,3,hzdESAd29XmdQhTyuj1gJA,"I really got excited to see a Nathan's stand at the Mandalay Bay. After walking thru the shark reef I was hungry so I thought the nearby food court would be a great stop!

Seeing Nathan's with it's own stand was different. Looking at their menu it was all the normal stuff, hot dogs, fries and shakes. Their prices though seemed a bit high, everything was between $5-$10 a la cart. $32 bill for 2 people to have lunch.

So we order our food and when it arrived I was really disappointed with that came compared to the price. Thin tiny hotdog, cold buns not steamed, overcooked fries and not much flavor to anything. 

My local movie theater has Nathan's hotdogs fresh, juicy large hotdogs with steamed buns. Why can't the actual resteraunt be as delicious????",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,11,3,2,6_gUh4Ju_ivc5XDvF7kvYg
2432699,2016-04-06,0,hzdESAd29XmdQhTyuj1gJA,"Nathan ' s is an okay stop, but the bacon is VERY salty. Also the hot dogs that they sell are undersized and they are dry and not juicy unlike other hot dog stands. Also they are very pverpriced. 25-ish bucks for a kids meal, bacon cheese dog and bacon cheese fries which are very flaky. 3.50 for WATER! very overpriced. Finally, I think that you should go to the other neighboring restraunts  quick are 20-39 steps away like Johnny Rockets or Pan Asian or Subway.",5Xzs5tbvrjrOcfFSB0nuhQ,0,1,2,3GHCtUjalLRkUpsTpGlkMQ

Maria was helping my family and I and the menu shows $4 for a bottle of water, this location has two different water options. Not both of them are $4 and it doesn't specify this anywhere on the menu. After picking up the ""more expensive, undocumented water"" Maria began to rudely explain that this water was more expensive and not on the menu, she was talking down to us, rolling her eyes and we also overheard her talking about us after we had paid and left. Very POOR customer service towards us and our situation. I definitely will not be back to this place because of the type of service my family recieved. Would give zero stars if it were an option. Please update your menu and retrain employees.",sUypC3cYcxqLNhmoWsDZSw,0,0,1,ROlV6LPDuDTaUFLSx9-mJw
4105804,2016-04-01,0,hzdESAd29XmdQhTyuj1gJA,"Completely average food for an expensive price. On a cool spring night, we decided to grab something quick before heading into the shark reef. The chili cheese fries didn't have much flavor, they weren't as good as I remembered and the hot dog was rather messy. I got it with onions, sauerkraut, relish, and mustard. The sauerkraut was too a bit sweet, it didn't really taste like sauerkraut. Overall, this place is overpriced and you can find much better food in Vegas for the same cost. The 3 stars is a little too generous, but it wasn't terrible, just basic.",xsTc0-jryDgAE_HuOUA2Ng,1,0,3,dJ7uCpd0R-ZP8Njvzle9eQ
4232618,2017-04-25,1,hzdESAd29XmdQhTyuj1gJA,"One cashier during a lunch rush seems a little stupid considering it too me 10 min to get to order but the wait between ordering and being served wasn't too bad at all, so that's a plus.

I sprung for the foot long bacon and cheddar burger - the hotdog itself was ok. The cheddar ""cheese"" topping was more or less that nacho cheese paste which was fine. The strips of bacon were a nice touch but kinda chewy so they break right away and caused the dog to fall apart. Pulling the bacon out and eating it separately remedied this.

Fries? Pretty solid, probably the best part of the meal (besides the much needed, overpriced beer).",B8SYB5r6wbFqWKfaKQQFBg,1,1,3,XXzi72RsTcvoftJQrAX4rA

I was helped by Manager and Justin, very fast and polite. They seem to have great team work and customer service. Food is pricey but good and taste fresh.

Dog was ok but bun was fully split into two pieces which mad handling an issue.  The fries were well under done.  Sadness.  This place could be a 3 but care and attention to detail was really lacking.  They were not even that busy.   

The Good
All beef dogs

The Bad 
Fully split bun. 
Under done fries. 
Servers just going through the motions.  

The Ugly
20 bucks for a dog and fries.",2FAYIIecGFsfcxUbwSRqjg,0,0,2,hQrV17i0-oFAp4El9GVq8A
