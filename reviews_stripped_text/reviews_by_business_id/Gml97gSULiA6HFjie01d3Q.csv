It was disappointing but not so much that they will lose my patronage. It would have easily been a 4-star rating without the chocolate cake as all the other food I have tried is quite excellent!

51385,2015-05-11,2,Gml97gSULiA6HFjie01d3Q,"I placed my order via Yelp around 7 pm. My growling stomach reminded me to look at the clock and it was 8:24 pm already so I decided to give the restaurant a call in case my order didn't reach them. They told me they received my order around 7:30 pm.. The gal on the other end ensured me it has already left and should be at my place any moment since technically it has only been one hour since they got my order, not an hour and a half according to my calculations. I didn't make a big deal because I thought maybe they were really busy. I hung up and waited some more... Then it was 9 pm. I called back and by now I am upset because I AM FREAKING HUNGRY! .. The same person put me and hold, and of course within a few minutes, there was a knock at my door.  The pizza delivery guy told me he tried to call but couldn't get thru to me (probably bc I was dialing the restaurant!!!! ) 
Bottom line: 1 1/2 - 2 hours is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS for delivery especially if you are down the street... If you are slammed then call your customer and just inform them and be upfront. The pizza and wings are COLD and soggy. I cannot stand that!  I am writing this review as I am waiting for my oven to preheat so I can heat up my pizza and hopefully get a decent crust.
Perhaps this is an isolated incident.. This place had good reviews and that's why we decided to order thru them. Here's to heating up my LONG awaited pizza and wings after waiting 2 hours for delivery. For the price, it should of been at least within a decent time range.",wVvyI4GW0mKVhltAYOonoQ,0,0,1,yCLQGL42sf6oXekf8VY65Q

We ordered 1.5lbs of wings, an order of garlic knots, and a sausage and pepperoni pizza last night, not one of them even remotely disappointed. In fact, in my opinion, this pizza was cooked to perfection, and the ingredients were extremely fresh.

I have a friend who is an extremely picky eater, even he could not stop tossing back these knots, and for good reason. They were delicious, both cooked and seasoned very well.

437523,2014-02-27,1,Gml97gSULiA6HFjie01d3Q,"This place is awful.  How is it even possible to have such a high rating on Yelp.....do the owners continually write their own reviews here or what?

We just ordered a Picante pizza along with some chicken fingers and fries.  Setting aside the fact that it took an hour and fifteen minutes to arrive; the pizza was warm, not hot and the chicken fingers were almost room temperature-----obviously we're not off to a great start here.

Ok, fine, let's try the food.  It was......tasteless.  Again, how is this even possible to have a tasteless pizza along with some tasteless AND dry chicken fingers?  I have no idea, but this joint seems to excel in this nigh impossible feat.  The only thing that made their food palatable was to smother it in their ranch and/or garlic Parmesan sauce.

Did all the chefs or cooks quit, get fired or go on holidays since their last review?  Were we the unwitting victims of ""take your kids to work day""......ie a bunch of 8 year olds running amok in the kitchen?  Who knows......better yet, who cares?

The only thing I'd have to comment negatively on is the price, it's a bit high for sides. Having 5 dollars for breaded mushrooms and most sides is a lot given the relatively small amounts. Still the flavor is there, so if you're just looking for a pizza go here. I personally recommend the Bianco pizza, or their coupon for two 16 oz pizzas, quite a money saver.

Being as we have a hungry family, and we like left over pizza, we opted for the 30"" pizza with pepperoni and some garlic balls.  My wife placed the order on-line which went smoothly, and we chose to pick it up since they are only a couple of blocks from our house.  This also save us $5 on the pizza and the $3 delivery charge.  The only ""issue"" with the on-line order was after checking out it said our order would be ready in 10-30 minutes which I felt was quite a spread, kinda like the cable company when you need an install done.  In defense of Pelligrini, it was a third party web site so it's probably not their fault.  

We decided to split the time and headed down to pick up our order 15 minutes after ordering.  When we got there we got a friendly greeting from a few of the employees. The guy at the register told us our order would be ready in about 10 minutes, and he was pretty close, it took 12 minutes.  Good enough for me.  The place was clean and had one table with a couple of chairs and a bench to sit on.  It's definitely a take out place so don't go expecting to sit down and eat. While waiting more employees came in to go to work and we received a friendly hello from them as well, which I thought was nice.  

Our order was brought out and the first thing to pop into my head was, ""Damn, this is one huge pie""  I mean to the point we had to take it home in the trunk of the car.  Get  the pizza home, grab a couple of slices and a few of the garlic balls and sit down to eat.  The pizza was quite good.  The crust was thin, but not cracker thin, and was light not doughy like other places.  The next time we order, I'll ask them to cook a bit longer as I like a little crunch to my crust, but that's personal preference.  The sauce had a good flavor and the cheese was good quality.  The pizza had an ample amount of pepperoni, to the point every bite I took had some.   

Now onto the garlic balls.  These were quite good,  but I think they could have used a bit more garlic, but that's just me.  The outside crust was nice and crisp and the inside was light and soft.  Definitely with the $4 bucks.

While not the best I've ever had, overall it was very good and we will be ordering from them again.",9qGOxS9tFI6M7QwG4JjYuQ,1,1,4,2BgcRaRdT78hr7t7V5Hl5w

However, the Chicken Piccata was horrible.   The menu said Spaghetti in a Lemon Sauce with Capers and Chicken.    What they failed to mention is that they also add sliced greek olives and Artichokes....both of which I like, but good gosh....all three of those things have a very strong flavor, and along with the too lemony sauce, it was simply not edible.   Even the chicken had a funky taste, although my dog seemed to enjoyed it and would have given a higher rating than I.    I ended up rinsing half the spaghetti, removing all the crap, remixed it and used the packet of parmesan that came with the Calzone to create something that sounds awful, but was much more edible than the way it arrived.  Even the garlic bread had a funny taste and was chewy.   I would love for them to respond and tell me if they actually taste the stuff they serve, because that dish needs some serious work.

Wings stand out more than the pizza, with a few different flavors: honey bbq and garlic parm so far are faves. Wings aren't too meaty or too scrawny but good value for the price and packed with flavor.

We usually get a pizza and then an order of fingers or wings plain with the sauces on the side. My favorite is their house sauce which blends teriyaki, bbq and hot sauce into one.

I recently moved to this particular neighborhood so I was sad to lost my previous mom and pop Italian joint. With that said, I was VERY happy to have found this place! Their menu is enormous and they have something that will please everyone. It's also very affordable, and they even deliver (with a minimal $1.50 delivery fee! what!?). With so many choices it was actually to pick one entree, however the staff was happy to offer their insights.

Speaking of the staff, they were extremely friendly and offered plenty of recommendations on their favorite dishes. My husband and I ended up eating inside the restaurant (which they are in the process of expanding, exciting!) and it was very clean. After listening to some recommendations, we ended up with garlic knots, mac and cheese, and stuffed shells. Being first time customers, they even gave us a 10% discount. It was very sweet. After quickly paying we took a seat. 

Within 20 minutes we had received all of our food, and let me tell you, there was a lot of it! There were almost 20 little garlic knots, which I highly recommend if you go, plus huge portions of mac and cheese along with many stuffed shells. Both entrees even came with garlic bread (which we didn't realize so we ended up with so much bread!). Neither my husband or I could finish everything. We ended up with lunch for the next day.

They are extra crispy, twice perhaps even thrice dipped in batter and fried to golden perfection. If it's a shameless night in, you can't go wrong with some of these pies and fries. 
My only critique is quite petty, the toppings are a little skim. If you are going to make pizzas so large, throw the toppings on there to fill it!",hGPlPuFPYmxTtjDvXExEtA,1,1,4,B1UwRRPdwsx8drHL3LOMcQ

I order from here sometimes and the pizza is ok. I ALWAYS tip the drivers. I'm not an asshole and I've been a consistent customer of Eat24 for YEARS. I've never had a problem like this before. Tonight I got the garlic knots, fries, and an eclair. Garlic knots were overcooked and burnt, fries were wet and soggy, eclair was also overcooked and kind of old looking. 

Because I am pregnant, I didn't want to go through the stress of calling the restaurant myself. Call me crazy, but whatever. I wasn't about to fight with a restaurant owner over food when I have a growing fetus inside of me ok? So I messaged eat24 instead and hoped they would deal with it for me. Eat24 customer support is always super sweet and easy to talk to, so they were more than willing to help me out. They understood my concerns and really just wanted to make sure that me and my unborn child were safe. 

Eat24 called the restaurant and told me that the restaurant owner said he ""cooked the food perfectly."" Um what? He said he cooked it himself so he was sure that it was cooked to perfection. I don't know how he can be so arrogant and rude. Especially over a $13 order. If he had just comped the meal, I'd probably order from here again in the future and order even more food, like I usually do. But now I'm just never going to order from here ever again. How stupid of them to do business this way. NEWS FLASH: PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST TRYING TO GET A FREE MEAL OUT OF YOU FOR NO REASON. Don't be arrogant about your fucking food and don't pretend like you know more about what good food is than your customers do. 

The reason why I keep using Eat24 is because they CONSISTENTLY provide me with GREAT customer service and always take my concerns seriously. That's how you stay in business and how you keep getting money from customers. Providing good customer service will get customers to return to your business instead of turn them away. 

In other words, I'M NOT FUCKING STUPID SO DON'T TREAT ME LIKE I AM. You're actually lucky I'm smart enough to know what good food is. Because if I wasn't, I would have eaten it, gotten sick, and then I would have sued you for putting my pregnancy at risk, asshole.",EofDXGTIjqq310yIMKq67w,8,2,1,7RZ9U64JAbR4naEK-aPYmA

I wouldn't eat the garlic knots. I'm from New York, and I've never had ""garlic knots"" like this before. Don't really know how to characterize them. Maybe bread bites with some sprinkled cheese on top? And the cheese wasn't even melted. They provide marinara sauce, but honestly was just a strange menu item that I believe

I had hoped to change this review. The manager of the store called me immediately after I posted my review and he was very apologetic for my pizza not being on point. A really nice guy!

We ordered a pick-up special 16"" cheese pizza, a 18"" Philly, garlic balls, and Zeppoli . It didn't list sauce on the Philly online, so we asked for white sauce on it... which they totally forgot. Wait time was an accurate 30 minutes.

They only have one crust option. It's very thin with a slightly thicker edge.  . Not dusted with flour or cornmeal. It was also very chewy, and way too tough for my liking. Flavor was very plain... comparing to saltine crackers. 

Toppings were of decent quality/flavor, but the cheese was SUPER greasy. Dripping off the pizza. 

When we picked up our order and paid, they forgot our garlic balls, so we pointed it out and one of the guys went back, got a bagged box and brought it out to us. It was barely warm. The pizza and Zeppoli were hot... so they made the garlic balls before the pizza? I don't know. I didnt mention it and took our stuff home. After trying one of them, I realized they were dry... the cheese wasn't even melted on them... and they were hard, or overcooked, or something. I hate using the term ""inedible"" since I freaking love food, but I couldn't eat these. :(

Zeppoli was tasty, and the kids loved them. Can't go too wrong with fried balls of dough with powdered sugar on them though!

Overall, I was very dissapointed. Usually my family of four happily stuffs face... but we still have half of each pizza and all the garlic balls leftover. 

On the upside, they have a very impressive selection of food ranging from pizza, pasta, salads, soups, sandwiches, pasta, chicken and ribs, and desserts.

I lowered my rating from 2 to 1 star for the location itself...it doesn't even have a sign on the storefront, was kind of dark/dirty and run down for a new restaurant.

I ordered my pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni (only $1 more for extra toppings!) and got spicy honey bbq sauce on my wings. The food took about an hour to get here. That's pretty good, considering I ordered my pizza 45 minutes before they closed!
The pizza was pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but definitely worth the money. Crust wasn't burned like most places! The wings were amazing.

Arthur is super kind and his staff is incredibly polite and they treated me like royalty when I came in there!

The pizza was a thin, limp, greasy, sad specimen that easily split into a congealed latticework of ""cheese"" and ""bread"". There was no tomato sauce. 

The wings were cooked hard and were so plain we had to go on a buffalo sauce search. We found about a teaspoon's worth, most of it stuck on the backside of the foil. 

Dipping sauce came with the wings. It wasn't blue cheese. It wasn't ranch. It actually reminded me of the homemade French onion powder you mix with sour cream. 

The only thing I wasn't disappointed with was the Coke. 

We took pictures so you wouldn't think we were lying.

I had Philly Cheese steak pizza and funnel fries ..

First off let me start off buy saying get an order of funnel fries !! I haven't seen alot of places that do this and here there amazing some even have a carmel texture to them after the powder sugar sets in -- if I could cause this is where I would inset text and say there f ing amazing seriously really good. -- only thing you need with this is a nice pilsner 

Pizza was really good too these are not what you call light pizza's I tend to think more on the heavy side for a definition meaning crust and dough is heavy witch is good and bad the bad meaning normally you can only eat about 2-3 slices before getting stuffed however taste and flavor was really good -- normally on a philly pizza its a little overly salty or bland tasting it stood up really good. 

They have a huge menu amount of menu items ranging from popcorn shrimp,fried rav, lots of sandwich's, burgers and large dessert menu cannoli's.

This place is worth checking out at least once and forming your view. There prices are just right and not crazy lie some I have seen.

They also offer delivery and coupon threw eat 24 and I think they do grubhub.",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,4,2,4,PMr6rbTsISioAVg8uMgvCw
