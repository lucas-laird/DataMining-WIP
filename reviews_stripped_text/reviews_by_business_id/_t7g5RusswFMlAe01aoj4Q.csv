I walked in, it was an average size, nice colors. I got the menu and there was only 4 items available! I was like wtf... Then when the lady came and we asked her if we could have this one item and no we do not have the itrm. So I ennd up getting whatever was there. The only good thing was the rice... white rice that anyone can do... I don't know why this place has 4 stars iin other web sites.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,0,0,1,kFfrv25EMtMw1UTQQZvwag

If you're going to compare it to Korean BBQ buffets in California or NY then you're going to be surely disappointed because the meat is, of course, a lot better in terms of quality and price than here.  

However, if you're looking for a good late night eat that'll fill you up, this isn't too bad of a choice.  The grills are a bit small for a big party, but the people who served us here were really nice and always waited on us.  The decor could use a little more work.  The place isn't anywhere to brag about, but it's also a place I wouldn't mind eating if someone suggested it.",a0PH_2zKVQExMP5w-OJQKw,1,2,3,0Ep3LbH2o77kx0aYNrYivQ
