They are always very polite and professional and they are quick at making your lunch.  Pretti in particular was very kind and sweet to me and I appreciate her professionalism. 
I will recommend this place!",IPzboIcLJgrAjJjBT9iNmA,0,0,5,eqKy1KGtpvQpQju-1Cr6dw
1376724,2012-10-27,0,zOYqvrpenMaAz0rc7n41Aw,I've always loved Port of Subs. They're sandwiches are way better than Subway. This location stood out because it was by far the cleanest location I've been in yet! Even cleaner than the one by my house in Anthem. I was very impressed by this as well as their service.,qfYbaGxtBjjN0RbYC1Hpbg,0,0,5,ANCmg0N6aB1GRTMoxIZj5A
1551007,2015-12-09,1,zOYqvrpenMaAz0rc7n41Aw,"Two hours to make a two sandwich order and then when their non-English speaking driver couldn't find the apartment despite being IN THE COMPLEX. After 10 insanely awkward minutes on the phone where I repeatedly tried to direct her to the right building ""stop here, no. STOP. The building you just drove past"" she just left and went back to the store without a word of warning.
When we called to cancel the person who answered the phone very rudely informed us that we had the wrong address to our own house -- the same address every other restaurant in town has no problem delivering to (this was ordered through an app and my same address has been set as default with no issues for two years). Even were it wrong... and it obviously wasn't because their driver was IN the complex driving around on the phone with me... no attempt at all to resolve the problem before just leaving? What poor customer service.",FzmKwzH1ECKudHZ5xkV2hg,0,0,1,7oxttNdhZuSKnK7F0bU3LA

3285073,2013-11-29,1,zOYqvrpenMaAz0rc7n41Aw,The sign on the door reads ANY 2 foot long sandwiches for $10.95.Also the Middle Eastern lady behind the counter told me about this special before I ordered.When I went to pay she charged me for the normal price (about$20) .When I asked why she said it was because the 2 foot long sandwiches I ordered were not the same .She never told me I had to buy 2 footlongs that were exactly the same to get the discount !! Nowhere on the sign does it state that ethier .The sign is VERY misleading. At least they could have informed me when they were making the sandwiches.What a joke.I'll never eat here again.,U-qTUib5bxR5f8-edhBsIQ,1,0,1,eGjQTXxC3G4Lv0jxz34wcg

They are way better than Subway... you actually get the entire piece of cheese here, not just a half. Their prices are much better than Capriottis and Subway!

5497157,2012-09-17,0,zOYqvrpenMaAz0rc7n41Aw,"I used to eat at this location at least once a week when I lived out here. Earning free sandwiches was a regular thing! 

The shop is always clean when I come in and never too packed. Today's visit was in and out. The staff was extremely nice here today and has always been when I come here.

My only complaint, and this is a vegetarian complaint so it might not hold true to most, but I wish they didn't slice my cheese on the same slicer they slice their meat. But, I am aware of this, and could simply stop coming here. Actually it's one of the main reasons I typically choose Subway over them.

In the end, their sandwiches are always fresh and flavorful. I have been to the one closest to me now here and there on Hualapai and Flamingo and the same story is there. Consistency is key and they seem to have it down.",dnv5UpldAE6UITDcMleLVA,2,1,4,mNACBmX1nthejq8-NvD-iQ
