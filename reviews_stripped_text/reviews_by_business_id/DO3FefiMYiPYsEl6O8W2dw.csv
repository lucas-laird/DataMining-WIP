135866,2013-01-09,0,DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw,"YUM!!  My friend and I went to the Las Vegas Grille for lunch today after she found a coupon and we checked them out on Yelp and saw all of the favorable reviews.  

We both ordered a homemade sausage on pretzel rolls; I had the Turkey & Chicken  New Mexico Chile sausage and she had the Turkey & Chicken Mediterranean Sundried Tomato sausage on pretzel rolls.  There were no condiments or extras of any type on the rolls, and they didn't need it because the sausages had amazing flavor on their own.  My sausage had a bit of a kick to it but nothing too bad since I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to spicy food.  We also both ordered side salads and were surprised by how large they were.  The salads, while fairly basic, were not just the typical iceburg lettuce salad; they had field greens, tomatoes, onions and what seemed to be homemade croutons.  The balsamic vinaigrette served on the side was one of the best dressings I've had and I want a bottle of it with me at all times.

Service was great.  You order at the counter and then the food is brought to you.  The girl taking our order (I wish I had gotten her name!) was very helpful and had suggestions for us since we hadn't been there before.  I had read a few reviews that said there was a lengthy wait to get food because everything is cooked to order, but we were in and out pretty quickly.  Also, as soon as we had ordered our food and sat down, our server brought us warm rolls right out of the oven first and then our salads next, so we had food while we were waiting for our sausages.  

I can't wait to go back and take my (meat loving husband) with me.  I expect this will be one of our favorite places to go, and I plan on checking out the Saturday night stand-up comedy soon.",6uXv2sy_mejlktiZPPbD0A,0,0,5,Dw804WUnw2WiLPTrTUG4Zw

Not dead like a handful of tables were occupied but dead like my fiancee and I were the only two people there, aside from the staff. The food was decent but the service was crazy slow. I decided to give this place another shot and phoned in an order. All I wanted was a # of beef loin. The guy on the phone said they were fresh out. How do you run out of beef in a restaurant that sells grilled food? It's not like I called a seafood restaurant and wanted spaghetti. So, I ordered a # of pork loin instead. I'll leave out the details about having to wait while listening to terrible stand up comedy and get to the food. When I got home, I opened up the meat and it smelled like Formaldehyde -- like when I dissected a cat in 11th grade Anatomy class. I ran it by a couple other noses and even my dog agreed it was bad. I lost my appetite it smelled so terrible. So, I called the restaurant only to be told by the guy on the phone that not only was the meat good, but it was the best pork they'd ever made. They were like those crazy chefs on Kitchen Nightmares swearing up and down their food is legit and their customers are retarded. A few minutes later, the owner called me and basically bragged about how top notch that meat was and how they'd been eating it all night. I wasn't calling to get my money back, I just called so they'd know their food went bad and they should get rid of it before someone else ate it and got sick. So, if you ate there tonight and got sick, rest assured that they knew they it was going to happen.",vSIH8409XCqzB1A4I2OXoQ,1,0,1,uGUUVOb37zOQMLHniAPKNA

The flavors are exotic and spot on:  turkey green chile meatballs, herb crusted pork loin, pecan wood smoked chicken, and six hand-crafted sausages. I've tried them all and can't choose between artisan bratwurst and the italian fennel for a favorite.  The meats here are slow smoked to perfection. Today I had wings and ribs. I consider myself a wing traditionalist and never imagined my favorite wing would become a smoked jerk chicken wing, but it is. The ribs were indescribably phenomenal. Smoked, packed with subtle hints of the apple wood they had been steeped in for 5 hours and then polished to perfection on the grille. I eat here weekly and I have had flavors I've liked more than others, but I've never had a bad experience. Phil and the guys care too much to let that happen. Come in and ask and he'll tell you about the untreated, then house brined meats they prepare at the LV Grille.

         1/2 lb of  beef sirloin  with red wine jus, New Mexico green Chile sausage and rainbow slaw.
          The ribs were very tender and flavorful.  The jerk / pineapple sauce had a little heat with a touch of sweetness. 
          Beef sirloin was the surprise , I do a little bbq'ing myself and I never thought of using sirloin, not enough fat . These guys pull it off very nicely. It was moist and tender , 
           The New Mexico Chile sausage was my least favorite , I guess I am to use to the  mass produced sausages that are grind to a paste and more tender. These were more roughly ground and not as tender as I like ,but this is a personal preference.

They gloppes the sauce over to cover bad meat taste.  The beans were also old and glazed over like they had been reheated from last week.

Well, walking through the door, we were met with the smell of the hardwood smoker and that unmistakable, nostril pleasing authentic BBQ smell.  
I had a good feeling that we were in for a treat. 
Well, we ordered smoked hot wings and let me tell you - if you love smoked meats and hot wings - order these!  The combination was absolutely DIVINE.  Well done! 
I ordered us half a rack of St.Louis ribs with a side of roasted red potatoes.   The ribs were perfect!  I'm typically a rib snob and prefer baby backs, but these St. Louis style ribs were outstanding.  I would definitely order them again, but after eyeballing the Las Vegas Grille's very interesting and unique menu, I have to say, I'm anxious to try out some of the more exotic fare.  
We enjoyed a caramel apple pie with vanilla ice cream for dessert, and it would have been perfect if it had been served hot, but that is my only constructive criticism for this place.  And besides, next time I will want to try their creme brulee cheesecake, so it's no biggie :)

1115784,2012-01-17,4,DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw,"I did the unthinkable....I ordered a salad at a BBQ joint.  Go ahead and judge me, I deserve it.   Luckily my friend went with the Bratwurst, and that is part of the reason The Las Vegas Grille gets high marks from this guy.  (thumbs pointed to myself)


The Bratwurst (made in house) had great flavor and that crisp snap you look for in the best sausages.  I come from Chicago, and in the midwest, our blood is 4% sausage to start with, so I know what I'm talking about here.  

The Salad here shouldn't even be on the menu, since all the other smoky delights clearly trump a plate of greens.  

The salad itself was a plate stacked high with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, and white onion.  I added roasted chicken which was just so/so.  The creamy vinaigrette was great though, but I'm sure you could find something a bit meatier to dip in it.  My big beef about the salad, is that there is no way to dress and toss the salad at the table without making a huge mess.  I don't know why restaurants keep commiting this herbivorous sin.  I ended up just dipping various lettuce and chicken in the dressing.  It was healthy but very disappointing.  


Let's be realistic though, you don't go to a BBQ place and get a salad, you come here for a heaping mound of protein, a slight case of the meat sweats, and a feeling of accomplishment (yes you did just eat that whole plate).",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,3,1,4,SCaJ0Pnhoa_mSj1jZ-afLQ

1252298,2012-04-25,0,DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw,"Originally from Cleveland, Ohio, I have tasted barbecue grilled in a big barrel on the street and while there are those who would question the cleanliness of this method, great barbecue is cooked this way. 

I came home today when I entered The Las Vegas Grille and ate some of the freshest, most delectable barbecue meat. 

Of course, the sides are totally different from my Cleveland days (which consisted of a slice of white Wonder bread, baked beans and maybe grilled corn). The rotini pasta salad is off the chain with a light flavor and not covered with oil. The red potato salad is just as light without being laden down with mayo and hint of red pepper to add to the taste.

Now for the meat. The sausage is made fresh including grinding and casing and, being from Cleveland with a large Eastern European population, I know my sausage and this sausage is so full of flavor without that greasy aftertaste.

Of course, the ribs are the stars, smoked in the smoker in the restaurant, and are tender, with a smoky flavor in every morsel (instead of liquid smoke flavoring used in many places) and huge portions are served.

Finally, the service is friendly, inviting and I am looking forward to coming back over the weekend for live entertainment being offered.",BE-GULNj8SAZmrK79da48Q,1,1,5,FczkwWAq4JPQLLBQw_C5QQ

I had the special Oktoberfest German Hunter's sausage with bacon in it. Damn good sausage and the roll it came on was quite delicious as well. I personally couldn't taste the bacon but wow still really good.

A little later Phil brought out a sample of (I Think) Artisan's Bratwurst and holy crap that was good. Some amazing flavors.

2238103,2012-03-15,2,DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw,"Hubby and I were desiring bbq after watching numerous episodes of Man vs Food.  Viewing a grown adult man consume pounds of smoky bbq'ed beef sounds distasteful at first....until the countless close-up shots of juicy pork and chicken and beef start to invade one's consciousness.  Gah.  We dropped into the Las Vegas Grille and were happily surprised by the cheeriness of the interior and the friendliness of the owner.

This place is super fun and serves up delectable food.  The wings are smoked which results in less fat!  Healthy(ish) wings!  I ordered the brat and 3 Hawaiian meatballs and both were so flavourful and fresh.  Since the sausages are made in-house, there are no bad-for-you chemicals in the food.  Hubby's chicken was crispy and juicy and the various sides we ordered were tangy, provided ample textural contrast (rainbow coleslaw, braised red cabbage, Bavarian potato salad), and were not dripping in mayo/other sauces.  The Thai curry sausage was yummy and spicy.

Phil, the owner, takes such pride in his craft which is a delight to behold (and consume).  He also has a sense of humour; after ordering my brat and meatballs, he replied, with an evil grin: ""so, you want a sausage and balls?""  Hee hee.  Ok, yes, that appealed to my inner 12 year old boy.  ;)

Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get (lots) and the type (meat).  Not a lot of veggie-friendly options, as the joint is a BBQ place, but there are a few sides and salads that fit that bill.

2323342,2012-09-05,0,DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw,"Went here based on Yelp reviews.  If I could, I would give it 3.5 stars, but since Yelp STILL does not allow half stars (why the hell not?), I am going to give it the edge and give it 4 stars.  It is a nice little place and smells of delicious BBQ when you enter.  The guy manning the counter (I presume the owner) is very nice and gregarious.  The menu is a little overwhelming at first, but basically you can get ribs, brisket, chicken or a variety of homemade sausages.  You can also get a few sandwiches and combo platters with various meats and sides.  I had a 4 meat combo, which came with 4 meats and 3 little sides for $24.  My wife had a bratwurst sandwich. 

Overall, the food was good, although it was not great.  Some stuff was better than others.  The best things were the ribs and the chicken.  The ribs were very tasty, but are not saucy if that is your thing.  The chicken had the jerk pineapple sauce and it was delicious.  The brisket was not good.  It was weak and low on flavor, and the flavor it did have was mostly a vinegar taste.  The fennel sausage was fine, but it was not anything super special, although I think it would go GREAT on a pizza.  The german potato salad was fine, as were the baked beans and sauteed vegetables.  Overall, for $24, I found the combo to be a little overpriced, as I could have easily eaten the whole thing and then some.  My wife enjoyed her bratwurst sandwich immensely though.  It came on a pretzel roll and with the sauerkraut, it had a nice sweet flavor to it.  It was pretty tasty and a decent price at $10 with a side.  It is a healthy sized sausage.  They had some tasty sounding desserts on the menu but we didn't try them.  

One last thing...the food is slow to come out.  They make everything to order, but it is very slow.  There was only a table or two ahead of us when we sat down to wait for our food and it took a while.  I can imagine that if that place were full, you would be waiting forever...which I think could end up hurting them in the long run.  Either call it in or be prepared to wait a while.  Overall, a pretty decent meal, but not anything I would drive across town for.  Maybe if I stuck to the better things I had and got them in greater supply, like a rack of ribs and a whole chicken, for example, it would be better.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,0,0,4,ODfNEDLj8JbzcwTAXf-pwg

other states to try different barbeque places.
   But how lucky we are to have found some of the best barbecue we,ve 
ever had right here at home in Las Vegas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   Tonight was our second visit in less than a week and we were as happy tonight 
as on our previous visit last Sunday.
On Sunday we ordered a full rack of ribs and a 3 meat combo.   WOW!!!!!!!!!
The ribs are super tender and have a great smokey flavor that can only be 
achieved by using an  inhouse smoker and great wood.  The 3 meat combo
included chicken, smoked tri tip sliced thin and a smoked pork loin which also 
sliced thin. All of the meats were very tender and had great flavor.
We also sampled several different side dishes which are all homemade like 
roasted potatoes, cole slaw and macaroni salad. All were fantastic.
  We also had the pleasure of meeting 2 of the owners, Phil and Chris,  who 
both were very nice and took the time to explain to us how they cook the 
different types of meats and how they get so many different flavors using 
different seasonings and different types of wood.
  O.K. so we finished our leftovers Monday and Tuesday and now it,s
Thursday and we are craving more barbecue. This time, we are going to try the sandwiches. My GF ordered a barbecue rib sandwich special which included
a side dish and a drink for only 7.99. She loved it. 
  I had to try one of their sausage sandwiches since they make all of the
sausages in house from scratch. Phil recommended I try his new creation,
a curry chicken and turkey sausage sandwich with carmelized onions on top.
OMG good!!!!!!!!!!!!! What an amazing flavor.
   On this visit, Phil and Chris both remembered us from our previous visit and 
made us feel welcome and happy. These guys are very passionate about their 
barbecue. Not only do they have great customer service skills, they have a
product which is by far, the BEST you,ll find in Las Vegas.

3024282,2011-06-23,4,DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw,"Eating at the Las Vegas Grille was like watching the first season of the Simpsons.  Very, Very rough around the edges but you can tell there is a lot of potential there.

My first visit to this new entry on the Westside dining scene was on a Saturday night and I found the place to be more on the empty side.  I attribute this to a an odd location within a non-descript strip mall on Sahara.  I was impressed however with the gigantic electric smoker they have staring down at you as you walk through the doors.  The menu immediately strikes you as shouting ""not your typical bbq place.""  Sure they offer standards like Ribs & Chicken, but they also have a selection of fresh made sausages, meatballs and other non-traditional bbq meats like pork loin.  You can order the meats a la carte, in sandwich form as as combo.   Rather than bore everyone with the fine details of the meal, here were the highlights:

-The side options are phenomenal.  Not only do the offer a unique variety, everything we had was top notch.  I absolutely loved the Bavarian Potato Salad (no mayo, with vinegar) and the Red Cabbage.  
-The Kielbasa on the pretzel roll was tasty, large, and a definite value at 7.99
-The pork loin and sirloin were both captured the essence of properly smoked meats.  I could tasted the rich earthy taste that smoking gives meat.
-The guys running the place seem passionate about making the restaurant into something great.  They were friendly and genuinely wanted us to understand their menu.
-Prices were reasonable for a meat joint.

But there were some lowlights as well:

-The ribs had a great rub on them, the sauce was tasty but there was very little meat.  By that I mean they give you a fair number of ribs per se, they just use really small ribs. 
-Speed of service.  You order at a counter giving the impression the food will be coming out relatively fast, yet we waited 1 minutes despite their being only one other table.  Im all for waiting for quality, but let the customers know that it might take that long and perhaps offer free biscuits or cornbread....just a thought.

I really liked a number of things at the Las Vegas Grille, but you can tell they still haven't found their feet yet.  I hold out high hopes for them because its always good to see the Vegas dining scene diversify with unique choices.  My 3 stars represents a restaurant in their first month, but it certainly doesnt capture all the potential that is there.

You order at the register, and then they bring the food out to you at your table.  The gentleman at the counter was very helpful and made some great suggestions (such as their thai chili sausages that are the current special).  

I had a three meat combination (the sausage, 1/4 rack of ribs, and the apple wood pork loin).  All three were good, but I really enjoyed the pork loin.  It was thinly sliced and had a great flavor.  You can definitely taste the flavor of the smoke.  Very good.  The ribs were also good as they just fell off the bone, and they were not overly fatty.  It came with a good pineapple jerk BBQ sauce.  Very tasty.

I had the spicy baked beans and sauteed veggies for sides.  Nothing too special, but solid and tasty.  Have to have a well rounded meal, right?

It took a little while for us to get our food, but I didn't mind because (1) I was not in a hurry and (2) I could tell that they make their food fresh.  We waited maybe 15-20 minutes to get our food after ordering.  This didn't appear to be some assembly line place.  This is some good stuff!  

My meal was $15.99 + tax and a drink.  I believe the 2-meat combo was around $10/11.  

They also had a drum set near the line area, and I'm not sure if there is live music in the place, but it would have a nice vibe to the atmosphere if they did during dinner or something!",K8a-efwCHx8Jc2wsosLgWA,0,0,5,QdbVG9xUGxaHI0CPhyjlyQ

LV Grille is not your typical BBQ fare.  It's definitely more refined and I would say it's more new-age BBQ.   So if you come in with an open mind, then you will be amazed by their BBQ.

The owner is extremely passionate about his food and has photographic memory.  2 of my friends who I ate with were on return visits and the owner knew their names and exactly what they ordered from their previous trip.

He went through the menu with us and was extremely helpful providing suggestions.  We ended up ordering their ""off the menu"" wings which were smoky, spicy, and delicious.  I probably would have been fine eating just the wings. 

After that, we shared a 4 meat combo with 3 sides as we opted with the Ribs, Chicken, Beef sirloin, and Sausage.  The ribs were tender, smoky, and fell off the bone.  The chicken was juicy, not dry, and the skin has the crispness where I say screw my cholesterol - i'm eating up all the skin.  

Everything was really good and this place will only be better bc the staff really cares about your opinions and they want to provide the best gourmet BBQ.

The 2 meats were chopped pork in BBQ sauce and smoked kielbasa sausage. The side was spicy baked beans. The pork was very tender and the kielbasa had great smoke and garlic. The beans were better than most and had a nice tang. The portions were ample and allowed for some kielbasa to go home.

The owner: also really friendly, and is really passionate about his food. He really wants to know how your food is, so that he can keep on improving the quality and introduce more flavors.

Things I've tried:
Mediterranean Sundried Tomato, made with turkey and chicken. A nice firm sausage, filled with flavor. 
Thai Chile: my favorite! A little spicy, tender, this one just bursts in the mouth with flavor. I love this stuff!
Artisan's Fusion Meatball - Beef & Pork: meatball in a wine sauce, pretty good, definitely worth trying.
Hawaiian Meatball - Pork Beef & Ham: my favorite meatball, tender and meaty smokey flavor, surrounded by a deliciously sweet Hawaiian pineapple sauce. 
Southwest Green Chile Meatball - Chicken & Turkey: a tasty meatball with a mexican marinara sauce on top. Nom!

Sirloin on sourdough - plenty of tender and juicy beef, nicely toasted bread; with a side of Bavarian potato salad that tasted heavily of paprika or a similar spice.

1/4 white chicken ($6.99) - breast and wing. I got it plain (for my kid) with the BBQ sauce on the side. Plenty of juicy meat and it came with one side.

1/2 rack of St. Louis style ribs ($16.99) - the meat wasn't fall-off-the-bone tender, but it was good, smokey, and very meaty. The ribs are smoked for several hours then finished on the grill with your choice of sauce. I loved the bbq sauce -- a touch sweet with plenty of depth in flavor. The meal came with one side.

Red potato salad - plenty of acidity plus eggy-mayonaise taste. It was ok.

Herb roasted potatoes - excellent. slightly crispy exterior/soft interior, well seasoned.

3592577,2012-08-13,1,DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw,"Anyone who knows me knows I am a barbeque fanatic. Traditionally drawn to Texas style barbeque, I have also developed a great appreciation for both Kansas City and Carolina barbeques throughout the years. There's just something about that slow cooked cut that makes my mouth water.

In my opinion, when you do barbeque good, it feels so natural going down that you can sometimes enjoy and entire meal with friends and never realize, until it over, just how wonderful the food was. I know I am supposed to feel guilty about not recognizing the tender, juicy cuts of pork, beef or chicken while they make their way down my gullet, but I honestly feel so at home enjoying great barbeque that I can easily get lost in some sort of euphoria.

By the way, bad barbeque (which Vegas has plenty of) is so offensive to my pallet that I can notice nothing else and I want to stand up and throw it back at the moron who cooked it.

In all my years of enjoying some of the world's best (and not enjoying its worst), I have to admit that I never expected what I found at The Las Vegas Grille (with an e). I am still adamant that there are only three types of barbeque (as previously mentioned), but I will hereby acknowledge that you can do some great things with slow smoked meats and I will still call it barbeque.

That's exactly what you will find at The Las Vegas Grille, excellent slow smoked meats that challenge every notion of traditional barbeque. The choices will leave you baffled for a time, and the menu is a little difficult to navigate, but the end result is definitely worth the adventure.

You won't find any barbeque sauces littering the tables at The Las Vegas Grille, although I expect you could ask for them if you truly want. But what you will find is some quite delicious selections of non-traditional meat items ranging from tri-tip to meatballs to chicken/turkey sausages that are all smoked with an impressive variety of wood chips. From grape to apricot to just about everything imaginable, The Las Vegas Grille uses these woods  to smoke its equally interesting variety of meats and the result is something you just have to try.

I will not go so far as to say that I am convert to this new and intriguing style of barbeque, as I will always be emotionally tied to true Texas barbeque, but I will say that The Las Vegas Grille is definitely something that is very welcome to the Vegas culinary scene.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,5,2,4,XO7NLJic2N3jFkmkOpV4Rw

It was cool because we practically had the whole restaurant to ourselves with only one other diner. Phil came out to greet us, and was happy we found out about LVG through
YELP, went over the different woods they use, and the different applications for all the meats.

This meal definitely led me to a smokey high (drug free!), and a food coma. Can a good meal change the way you feel about your day? It sure can. While my day was already going so well, this dinner certainly was the creme dela creme of my perfect day.

I just needed to indulge my curiousity for this place since I hear yelpers raving about the awesome smokey goodness of their dishes. I had the Three meal two side combo for $15.99.

White Oak Roasted Beef Stirloin: The hard smokey flavor from the White Oak just really stood out and blended so well with the stirloin. On top of that, the meat was so tender, and flavor although full, was light and soft. . Just the subtle taste of light herbs and smokey white oak.

Thai Green Chili Curry Sausage: Hand made with chicken turkey meat with thai green chili. It was REALLY spicy, but I loved that the meat didn't overpower the spice of the chili since the chili was the focal point of the whole sausage. In most places, you can't really enjoy the wonderful spice of the thai chili since most condiments in various dishes take over the taste of the chili. Here, you can definitely enjoy the taste of the chili.

Apple wood roasted pork loin: The sweet and denser smoke flavor went so well with the pork loin. The loin was also tender, and if you squint your eyes and scrunch up your nose, you can feel that light sweetness in your taste buds.

BBQ St. Louis Ribs with traditional sauce: I loved the smoke flavor in the baby back ribs. I had a bite, and you can really taste the powerful smokey flavor of the Walnut wood. So good I didn't even need extra BBQ sauce for extra kick.

Everyone is so friendly here, and accomodating. Phil takes the extra effort to speak to the customers about the process of these wonderful culidary dishes. Knowledge is what makes the world go round!

Oh Phil. Hat tipped to you. You are like the Bill Nye the Science guy of meat smoking chemistry. Your formula, wood and meat combinations are on point!

We also took home 2 different desserts and munched them later. OHHH so tasty!

I loved the mixed bean side dish - none of that overly-sweet, gloppy canned baked beans here. And the salad was a very fresh, nice mix of spring greens and iceberg lettuce, with a phenomenal homemade balsamic dressing.

Our side dishes were Bavarian potato salad, rainbow slaw and spicy beans.  The ribs and sausage were excellent while we both felt the pork loin and tri tip were dry.

No, this is a hard review to write because all I will be thinking about for the rest of the day is The Las Vegas Grille's BBQ.  After trying Phil's homemade sausages, I feel like every sausage I've had up to this point has been a lie.  These are the links you've been looking for.

The sausages here are truly homemade, from the grinding to the smoking.  Phil, Las Vegas Grille's owner, has absolute control over his final product.  The first half of the equation is what to put inside the sausage.  The other half is the wood he uses to smoke the meat.  It may be cliche to say ""quality over quanity,"" but it totally applies here!  The easy way out would be to throw all of your different meats into the smoker, and cook them all at the same time, which would give a similar flavor profile to all the meats.  Instead, Phil takes care to pair each meat with a specific type of wood and smoke them separately.  Longer process?  Yes.  More unique and distinct flavors?  Absolutely!

My favorites have been the Thai Curry sausage and the Sundried Tomato sausage.  Yes, they really do taste like curry and sundried tomatoes, and have an awesome smoked flavor as well.  In my pre-LVG life I would have said that sausages came in two varieties: plain or spicy.  Phil has opened the door to artisan sausages, and there is no turning back.  Sausage sandwiches?  Not no more.  You don't need bread interfering with what these sausages offer. 

You can also order combos and get different meats for your meal.  On my most recent visit I went with a 2-meat 1-side combo for $9.99: Thai Curry Sausage, Sirloin with red wine sauce, and herb roasted potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw?select=-lGXHtFOQ8wCSmeD3YE8dA).  The sirloin was oh so tender and came with a swiss and horseradish aioli.  I found myself using a lot of the aioli, as the red wine sauce on the sirloin was a bit sweet for my tastes.

Excellent experience all around.  Friendly service that will walk you through the menu.  Be sure to talk to Phil to truly see what makes this place so special.  One of his newest menu items are smoked chicken wings, which I haven't tried yet.  Looks like I'll be making another trip to The Las Vegas Grille real soon...",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,16,14,5,liJKOoGPmdTduk6wrka-fA

We decided on sharing a 3meat, 2 sides combo. I read through the reviews to find out which meats were the hits and it did not disappoint. The Thai sausage was lovely. Nice snap when you bite, lightly smokey, has a nice lemongrassy, cilantro, minty flavor to it. The ribs were juicy, perfectly smoked through and the BBQ sauce was tangy and a little sweet. Normally I want more sauce on most ribs, but these didn't need it. BBQ chicken with the pineapple jerk sauce is everything you want in chicken. The skin was crispy while the meat was absolutely juicy! I'm a sauce person, but the little baste was good enough since it was really well seasoned. 

I LOVE the fact that all the meats are smoked separately, with different wood. Phil is serious about his BBQ as many established places around town do not really do this. 

The Bavarian potato salad was delish. I love myself vinegar based taters and this was definitely one of the better ones I've had. The spicy baked beans were pleasantly unique. I love that it's a mix of beans! The spice isn't spicy but spice filled and had a slightly sweet aftertaste that seemed to be like nutmeg/cinnamon's doing. It's a bit like Carribean beans my friends mom makes which I happen to adore. 

Phil and his staff were very nice and friendly. I just love really cool owners that really is proud of their product and happy to make this a positive experience. These are the type of places that should be supported. 

I've been keeping to a 4star first visit with a several visit bump to 5stars, but this was seriously ""as good as it gets"".

First of all the homemade sausages are amazing. The Artisan Bratwurst is to die for and the New Mexico Chile is equally tasty. I also had a 1/4 rack of ribs with the Pineapple Jerk sauce that was nothing short of astounding it was so good. 

The try at a veggie side was horrible, and should be replaced by a steamed veg with some butter sauce, not that sauteed mess. The smoked sirloin was not up to par and should be removed from the menu. I don't think sirloin is a good smoking meat choice. Replace it with some brisket or a tri-tip with a dry rub and you will have a winner.

Ordered it based on Blair's ROTD from a few days ago praising it and wow, I was not disappointed.  A heap of smoked salmon on the incredible Ciabatta bread with some veggies and a nice aioli.  I was a little disappointed when I opened it up my container and saw the sandwich hadn't been cut in half (I never requested it this way though, so it wasn't their fault).   I took out the little plastic knife from the plasticware they gave me, and it cut through the middle of the sandwich, bread and salmon all like it was butter.

I never know what to expect from local establishments but we love trying new things.  Unfortunately I am on a fat loss diet so this was really a trip for my wife but I admit I did sample some of the food so I could write this review.  We ordered the 3 meatball taster.  The meatballs, which are ground on the premises, are delicious and light as opposed to the dense rocks my mother used to make.  The taster gives you three different sauces and each had a great flavor.  One of the three meatballs was slightly pink in the cen tr er but phil assures me that is due to the fusion of  three types of ground meat and that they are very careful to ensure it is cooked properly. All tasted excellent. We also got the ribs and pork combo with potato salad.( the pork was not the pulled pork choice but a thinly sliced pork).  The ribs were excellent with a mild bbq sauce that had a great flavor.  They fell off the bone almost just from looking at them.  The pork was not as warm as we would have liked and really did not have enough flavor.  We didn't like the potato salad because it was in a vinegar based sauce but I suspect some people would like it as it is a matter of taste.  We met the owner Phil who brought out the peanut butter chocolate pie my wife tortured me with.  Luckily I am not a huge peanut butter desert fan so one very small taste was enough for me.  It was not too rich and had an excellent flavor and texture.

The price is amazing.  The meatballs were $3.99 and the combo 10.99 +2.00 to add the ribs.  They have sandwiches and other meats on the menu and they also make their own sausage from scratch.  

I did not try the bread as it didn't look that spectacular and my wife didn't rave about it.
They sometimes offer deals on other sites and whoever is in charge of that for Yelp should hit them up!
All in all, this is a great deal!
Note i have corrected this review as i had inacurately statased a meatball was undefcooked when it was in fact cooked properly and was pink due to the meat mixtures.  Thanks Phil!",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,1,4,cqF8cBxIjWFYvO3wgM9ygQ

I'm gonna go out on a limb here by saying this but this is probably one of the best BBQ places in Vegas. 
I tried this place because they were on groupon a few moths ago. As most people know its a 50-50 thing with groupon, sometimes it's not worth the paper it was printed on and other times you thank yourself for being adventurous and cheap at the same time.

This place was truly a groupon gem! I see them from time to time on groupon now as well. Ok from this point forward I won't mention the word groupon in the rest of the review. 

The food: 
All of it was Broke da mout' nom nom! We wanted to try as much as we could so we both ordered a 3 choice plate. 

The smoked wings were phenomenal! No need for sauce on the bad boys.. You can taste the smoked in goodness...

I had some ribs, sirloin and some chicken.. All of the meats had a great smokey flavor. Each meat was very distinctive in taste

5918755,2011-06-01,5,DO3FefiMYiPYsEl6O8W2dw,"Driving to the library I noticed a white banner advertising the opening of another new restaurant on W. Sahara Ave (same strip mall as Swish).  So I decided to give The Las Vegas Grille (former site of CJ Texas BBQ) a try on my way back.  

The restaurant looks spacious, tables are not crowded together, and the chalkboard menu looks beautiful, and there is a big smoker near the cashier.  It is a barbecue restaurant with a menu that can be categorized into the following major groups: barbecue meats, handmade sausages, meatballs, and sandwiches made from barbecue meats or meatballs, salads, side items, and desserts. 

The lady at the counter plus all the staff at the restaurant were all very nice.  As this was my first visit, it took me awhile to look at the entire menu, but they were patient and offered suggestions to help me decide on what to try.  I was thinking about the St. Louis BBQ Ribs, but ultimately went with the 4 Meats 3 Sides Combo, which consisted of Beef Sirloin, BBQ Chicken with Pineapple Ginger Jerk Sauce, Applewood Roasted Herb Crusted Pork Loin, and Handmade Sausage (Artisan's Bratwurst)  for the meats, and Bavarian Potato Salad, Rainbow Slaw and Rotini Pasta Salad for the sides.  Before I was done with my meal, I also ordered all three of their meatballs (Arisan's Fusion Meatball made with beef and pork, Sweet & Sour Hawaiian made with pork, beef and ham, and finally the Southwest Green Chile Meatball made with chicken and turkey).

As long as I can remember, I have always enjoyed charcuterie items, from Taiwanese and Chinese sausages to artisan German and Italian sausages and hot links from the South.  After culinary school and having had the opportunity to attend a master's class on charcuterie taught by CMC Fritz Sonnenschmidt (master chef, author and leading authority on the subject), I learned to appreciate it even more.  And out of all the items I ordered, I would say that their Artisan Bratwurst was my favorite.  It is also very healthy, as far as cured meat products goes, as they do not use nitrites, nitrates or MSG in their curing process, instead they utilized a high heat smoke curing method.  The result is sausages that have a nice flavor, good smokiness, and not overly salty.

The Applewood Roasted Herb Crusted Pork Loin was also very good.  It has the nice smoke ring, indicative of true barbecue, and the pork was still juicy and packed with flavor.  Undoubtedly, it would be great in a sandwich as well.

The BBQ Chicken with Pineapple Ginger Jerk Sauce has nice flavor, but was a little on the dried side.  The White Oak Roasted Beef Sirloin was okay, it definitely has the smoky flavor, but was otherwise too much on the well done and dried side for me to appreciate or enjoy it.

The meatballs were pretty good. Served as it, it is too salty for me (but my personal preference leans towards less salt), but serve it in a sandwich it will be just right.

I like restaurants that strive to serve healthier and more natural foods, and this place definitely does that!  Although they do not make their own breads, they do sourced them from a local artisan bakery (Great Buns Bakery), which makes a good pretzel bread.

Overall, it is a good barbecue restaurant that can be even better with more fine tuning.  And personally I would be here just for their sausage sandwiches, which currently is available in the following selections: Artisan's Bratwurst, Italian Fennel Sausage, Keilbasa Polska, Kids Beef Frankfurter, Mediterranean Sun-dried Tomato, and New Mexico Chile.

Food:  3/5  Some items are super good, while others were okay.

Price:  3/5  Reasonable.

Ambiance and decor:  3/5  Spacious arrangement, minimally decorated restaurant with a giant shinny barbecue smoker right inside the restaurant, staffed by friendly restaurant personnel. 

Location:  West side, just down the street from the car dealerships on W. Sahara Ave.

Parking:  4/5  Plentiful parking.

Cleanliness:  5/5  New, and kept in pristine condition by the restaurant staff.
