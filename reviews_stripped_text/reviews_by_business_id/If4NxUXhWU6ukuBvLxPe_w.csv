Ever since the first time we got dinner here it's become a weekly thing. They are always putting fresh trays of food out and nothing has ever tasted like it just sits around. I wish they had their shanghai lumpia out all the time because it's hella good, but we've only been able to catch it there once so far.

2880476,2016-10-19,6,If4NxUXhWU6ukuBvLxPe_w,"Filipino food is on the up and up in the American foodie scene. With all the fusion dishes out there and ube this and ube that, sometimes you just want to enjoy Filipino food dishes done traditionally and prepared in a grocery store's kitchen because you are just too lazy to cook and never really learned how to do things right. That's where Philhouse comes in for me. They are a great ""turo turo"" option for Filipino food - where dishes are already made, sitting in hot plate and you ""point point"" to what you would like to eat. You can either order combos (comes with rice or pancit) or do entree sized items. They also have a wide array or heart-attack inducing fried and crunchy goodness towards the end of the ordering area where you can get fried chicken skin, chicharon, jeprox (fried fish), etc. Out of their main dishes, I personally enjoy the menudo (cause I love the hot dogs in it) and the bistek (the meat is usually pretty tender and drowning in delicious sauce). Hipsters beware, I wouldn't introduce someone to Filipino food to this place, but if you do, the workers speak both English and Tagalog and can help you find something you might like.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,8,6,4,KaDQO4zB-6l5_69tAgWHOg

3647321,2017-03-20,1,If4NxUXhWU6ukuBvLxPe_w,"I've been here a few times & all experiences have been consistent. 

It's turo-turo style (point-point) where you tell/point to the item(s) that you want & pay at the end.   The name of the concept is from the Philippines. I didn't make it up! =)

[ PROS ]

* Food is already prepared, so service is quick

* Prices are reasonable - $7.25 for 2 item combo

* Serving sizes are big

* They have a lot of choices

* You can choose between rice or pancit, or half & half... and again, serving size is huge! The pancit alone can be a meal itself (and I'm not exaggerating)

* Staff & Manager are friendly 

* Bicol Express is deeeelish!

* Binagoongang Baboy (Pork with Bagoong) was actually really good. A lot of fat, but very tasty


[ CONS ]

* Tables are limited. When they're busy, you may have to wait for a table

* Dinuguan, Kare-Kare are a bit bland (for my taste buds anyway)

* Pancit is a bit dry


I'll definitely be a regular here tho.. there's still so many other items to try!",Kq_Cg-INSv4i8wNo1kDF-w,3,1,4,htzFac68zm7KK7HW4o9WTQ

To call it a juice is being generous. For $3 it is pricey. It has maybe a drop of juice and cup full of ice. Goat dish was meh. Chicharon was not crispy and oily. Squid is dry. They even forgot to give vinegar for the chicharon.",_VOxmPH8tdGQS3D7TMGFQg,0,0,1,C76YJxEluALJSrd5WKyMIg
3751902,2018-02-24,0,If4NxUXhWU6ukuBvLxPe_w,"Still giving three stars as they are really friendly here and I haven't tried enough to really know how I feel. First time coming here today and I got a small pancit palabok and large sweet spaghetti. I will say the portions are big here they FILL the containers up! I also got cantaloupe juice which was a bit pricey but it was good. The pancit palabok was meh it just a step above bland seemed maybe it was cheaply made they used spaghetti noodles and there was only ground beef I like my palabok with shrimp and lechon or at least crushed chicaron so I was pretty disappointed with this one. The spaghetti was kind of the same thing not completely plain but the flavor wasn't all there also there was little to no meet or hotdog no cheese either. I will be trying this place out again want to try their dinuguan, bangus, and pork belly hopefully it will make up!",XzcfH6aS6W80XlSQSTKpIg,0,0,3,HTVA5JquJPQNyybffMTqhQ

4207651,2017-10-04,0,If4NxUXhWU6ukuBvLxPe_w,"If you're craving for delicious, homemade-style Filipino cuisine, then PhilHouse is the place to go (in Spring Valley). When an establishment has owners and employees that care, it shows not only in the quality of the food but also throughout the overall dining experience. Yes, the place is laid out 'turo-turo' style (point out what you want) with very minimal human interaction, but every single time we come in for a Filipino food fix, we are always met with pleasant and friendly folks behind the counter eager to serve up the freshly prepared dishes. PhilHouse also has a grill area that offers pork belly lechon, barbecue and other grilled meats and fish that compliment the wide variety of dishes served up daily like laing, kare-kare, dinuguan, lumpia, okoy, pancit palabok, sisig, grilled bangus pork/chicken bbq and many more to mention. Also, don't forget to try their breakfast menu for that oh-so-good longsilog, spamsilog (yes, spam!), hotdogsilog or tapsilog which your food preparer is only too happy to pile on to your hungry plate! Lastly, PhilHouse is now one of our go-to places for party platters--the price is good, the quantity is ample and the taste is top notch. We ordered our platters and the awesome pork belly lechon from PhilHouse for our class reunion and everyone who sampled it enjoyed every morsel making the party's food offerings a success (thanks guys!).

This quick serve Filipino restaurant is located within Island Pacific Seafood Market so I didn't have any expectations, I thought it would be like Grill City at Seafood City, but boy was I wrong! 

I was pleasantly surprised to like everything I tried here! Okay don't shoot me, but I'm not a fan of Lechon. Usually, especially the ones made here in Vegas, the skin is too hard to chew, tons of fat, oily and gross. BUT PhilHouse's Lechon was delicious! I LOVED IT. The skin was crispy and NOT hard at all. The meat was juicy (yes, oily too) and there was more pork meat than fat. It was my favorite dish out of everything I tried here. I wish I ordered some to go. I heard they make their lechon fresh daily. It sure seems like it. 

I also got the sinigang, which was delicious. Tastes like my mom's and aunts. Not too salty. Perfect for this freezing cold weather too. Would've preferred shrimp over pork though. We also got pinakbet and another oily pork dish, I forgot the name. Those were pretty good and made better than some other places in town. 

Oh and the kind lady that helped us was amazing, so friendly. There wasn't a long line when we got there but when we left the long line for dinner started to form. I really liked this place and will be back to try other items!

** TIP: The hours posted on here are wrong (""closed at 5pm""), still open as of 6pm. No hours listed at door or receipt, assuming they stay open as long as Island Pacific Market is open 10pm.

** Also check out the Bread Republic bakery to the side, to get fresh out of the oven Pan De Sal and Ube or Buko Pandan Cupcake with Flan! SO GOOD!",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,9,6,4,eBcCRGj0lxArWskZEnd-EA
5195207,2018-05-25,0,If4NxUXhWU6ukuBvLxPe_w,"Check your receipt when you pay, they added $0.75 for making my food ToGo, not my fault because I told the lady from the start when I was ordering, then when I was paying I noticed they are not wrapping it, so I said ""that's for ToGo"" then when I checked my receipt as I was walking away there's that extra charge. 
Then today same thing happened, I asked for a combo and the lady taking the order made a mistake and she puts the 2nd viand/dish ""ulam"" in a bigger container, so she told me that it won't be full because it's a bigger container, I said ok. After I pay, I checked my receipt and there's that $.75 again!!! Mind you, they don't tell you that you're getting that extra charge... and for something that is not my mistake. 
Did not go back anymore to question that extra charge, anyways, it's just $.75, but they won't get me the third time! Or probably won't buy from here anymore. 

Do not order the Kare kare, the meat is an unknown parts, it's like left over from the other dish, it was so hard to chew also. I think because it is covered with the peanut/yellow sauce that they think they can fool you.",ldIBLeflqehwYj_T6r0yOg,0,0,1,VZFi24XhKsyp6xKHgKiI4A
