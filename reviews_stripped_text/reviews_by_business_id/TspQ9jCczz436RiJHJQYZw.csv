101789,2016-06-09,0,TspQ9jCczz436RiJHJQYZw,"I had the 2 Kubideh special for $11.99.  I chose the ground beef & ground chicken Kubideh Kabobs.  There was plenty of food on the plate to fill me up.  Both versions of the kabobs were cooked perfectly.  They both were cooked to order and came out nice & hot.  The rice was well rice so it was on the dry side as usual no matter where you get it.  I should have asked to see if I could get some type of sauce for it.  I did add some roasted and chopped hot peppers to it which had a great taste.  I also added some other green sauce / salsa type of thing which also was flavorful.  Sorry don't know the name of it.  I really enjoyed the fresh bread that came with the order.  They served both the kabobs on the bread so the juices soaked in a little to give it more flavor.  The plate also would have come with a roasted tomato & mixed greens but I did not get them.  I did get the onions and asked for extra which they gladly gave me a bunch of.

The only negative about my experience there was that I would have had to pay for a side of the garlic sauce.  That is not a big negative but wish the dish would come with a little side already.  

The young lady that took my order was real nice and answered all the questions I had as this was my 1st visit.

They have a good size dining area which was very clean as was the bathroom.

Overall I enjoyed the food very much.  It was a great price especially for the amount of food I received.  I will be going back for sure.  If it was a little bit closer to the house I would probably go there a couple times a week.",PAvUfCRzSSl97v5M3ddUfw,0,0,5,Oljw47JtD1aI4Co9gCHsNg

We had the Kubidah kabob which was perfect in flavor and tenderness, a Beef Gyro, also perfect, the tenderlion lamb was a bit undercooked/chewy and the shredded chicken, also felt undercooked. Overall, its a good place in LV area, though not the best for kabob. most dishes come with rice, half mideastern style pita bread, green salad a grilled tomatoe and chopped onions. As for portions, I guess big customers like myself, its almost enough, average diners will find it hard to finish and kids will have to ask for a to-go box.
Prices are average for value and the staff are decent but can definitely use a smile on their faces.

The food was promptly delivered at exactly the time we requested...I mean right at the exact time we asked for it to be delivered!!! That took a huge stress off of us and allowed our housekeeper to transfer the food into proper buffet server/warmers before our guest arrived. Fresh Kabob brought over dinner for 25 people including salads, incredible rice and extremely tasty Kabobs. Our guests absolutely LOVED the food. We encouraged them to go and support Fresh Kabob by dining there regularly as this is the kind of business that should be supported and rewarded. 

To give you an idea of the amount of food. We had a total of 19 people. We ordered the dinner for 25 and added some sides of hummus and tabuli salad. We also supplemented the dinner with some chicken wings. That made it perfect for a group of people with pretty big appetites and and even gave us a few leftovers for us to enjoy the following day.

I love this place. If you ever host a party and want something different than the ordinary, give Fresh Kabob a chance. You and your guests will be happy you did.

Thank you again Fresh Kabob. You helped make our party a great success!",ngk1yxWvxCuO_lvJ87PReg,2,1,5,imjC5C_uVBOh6ELmLzEpVg

619760,2013-08-19,0,TspQ9jCczz436RiJHJQYZw,"Ordered no. 11, 12, 18 and the Mast.O.Khiar ""yogurt & cucumber"".  No. 11 is the combo chicken: cube skewer and a ground skewer. No. 12 is the lamb combo: cubes and ground each on a skewer. No. 18 the fried chicken tenders with fries. All orders served with saffron rice, fresh baked bread and lettuce. We also Sampled the hummus. 

We all agreed that both lambs; cubes and ground, were really good. Flavor enhanced with dry rosemary topped on the meat and grilled with it. 
We all also agreed the kebob chicken was below average. Although the chicken was topped with rosemary identical to the lamb, we felt the rosemary was a distraction to the tast an not an enhancent. Also the Chicken kebobs had the raw chicken taste/smell. 

All kebobs, lamb and chicken were juicy and and tender, and perfectly salted; a must for any kebob place to master regardless of taste to be even considered a kebob joint. Otherwise it is just somebody with a grill and meat on skewer, which is not kebob. 

However, the fried chicken was really good. I even joked that he is in the wrong business; being a kebob place instead of fried chicken. The only downer he served the yougurt-cucumber as a dip, and I wished for more options like coleslaw for instance. The fries were okay, McDonald's quality, I personally didn't enjoy them. 

We didn't like the saffron rice. It lacked flavor and it was hard to chew, to be fair we only eat aged basmati rice, nothing else, so it could just be a matter of food habit. 

The yougurt cucumber sauce/ dip needs to be more liquified. It felt little bit dry, but was acceptable. The bread was hot and fresh, just normal. 

The hummus sucks big time. I also asked to sample the baba ganouj but was told it was already prepacked. So I passed on it hence the hummus sucked. 

Service was good, food was fast and timely. 

Portions were nice and generous. Pricing was very reasonable. I used the yelp deal $40 for $20, which saved us $20. Even without the yelp deal, pricing is still good. 

The place is clean and neat. Has couple of booths and the rest are tables. The decor was simple with a small touch of elegant. 

Bathroom spacious, modern and extremely clean, a major plus.  

We disliked the TV volume which was very high. The signal was lost for a while and the place went really quite, then back to the loud noise. 

Self service. You order, pay at ordering, then pick up when your number is called. 

We would've given it a 5 star, despite our dislikings, but hence all sides were at the same price, however they refused to substitute the rice for any other side. We found this a downer. Why you want to force me to eat a side that I don't like?

 FYI. I disapprove of rice being the side dish with kebobs regardless of the rice edibility. I think kebobs a thirst-triggering meat course should go with more moist side like hummus, baba ganouj,... etc. 


In conclusion it is worth a visit. 

Just a quick note, I spoke in plural because that was the opinion of the group and not only me. However the detailed description is my own product.

Rice, VERY dry with absolutely no flavor. For a Mediterranean place, you need something more than just plain white rice. 

Hummus. Also very plain tasting. For hummus being an al-la-carte item, one piece of pita bread is not cool. I mean come on, it's bread. Don't make me discover it's only enough for one person when u give me a family size portion of hummus. I forgot about this when it happened last time. Shame on me. 

The chicken and lamb were both good kabobs. My girlfriend wanted a lamb/veggie kabob combo and they charged her full price for 2 entrees. 

The spicy sauce u can serve urself is very good. Do not forget to get this!

Overall, there are better Kabob spots nearby. $32 for me and my girl to get kabobs with no drinks/dessert is crazy. I say this place is only good in a pinch.",AYESvJ2yiikh6pMmfv3qIA,0,1,3,WHgmn7xVGgsyCuPzlBTMZA

Needs more marinating time.  Maybe we got a bad batch but the basmati rice was soooo soggy that our table and the one table beside us went to the service counter to ask for a replacement.  The replacement was the same sorry soggy rice considering that basmati is a firm type of rice.  Maybe it's just the restaurant quality going downhill.

1543961,2013-11-10,2,TspQ9jCczz436RiJHJQYZw,"BABA GHANOUSH. AND DAT BREAD.

This will honestly be just a review about the baba ghanoush. It's delicious. Spiced just right. So inexpensive. As good as the baba that I've had in $$ and $$$ restaurants. Comes topped with sliced black olives (which I wish were whole and preferably a different variety, but you overlook the small things in the presence of perfection). 

If you like hummus and you haven't tried baba ghanoush, you're a fool. Try some. Preferably from here.

And the bread. Homemade. Soft. Warm. This is no Wonder® Taftoon. It's the real deal, made in house in a tandoori. And you can order an extra 12"" round of it for 99 CENTS. I may just go here every day and buy some rather than keep bread in the house. 

The real reason I came here was because it was close to my house and they had falafel. Which was also excellent. A little dry, but falafel is a fickle thing sometimes. Comes with a good sauce and all the right fixings, all of which were very fresh. Guess what it was served on? More delicious flat and warm goodness. The only way to improve this would probably be by adding some baba.

Definitely getting that Yelp deal next time and taking my roommates.

From the outside, this place doesn't really look like much. It's clean, and newish, but that's about all I could tell. Inside it's clean too, with tables as well as some couches and comfy chairs to pick for seating. It's a walk-up-and-order type of place, too, so step back to read the menu and make your selection so you don't hold up the line. There was a good group there when I went, but not enough to call it crowded- there's a large screen where some folks were watching the Spain/Italy soccer match, which seems to change based on what is playing at the time. If you're not the sports type, they also have free wifi- ask the cashier for the password. 

The menu is pretty diverse, with kabobs (hence the name) taking the majority, but some wrap sandwiches and other grilled meats, too. I love Persian and Mediterranean cuisine, and this place had a good mix of offerings from lamb, chicken, and tenderloin kabobs to chicken schwarma wrap and sides such as hummus and dolmas. 
I had the chicken schwarma wrap, BF had the lamb kabobs, and we got extra bread and hummus for the table. Other dining partners ordered slightly different variations of the same, but beef dishes. Everyone dug in and loved the food- it was hot, fresh, and flavorful, and in ample portions. The plates each had sides of a small salad or dolmas, and rice or hummus- these are probably interchangeable, but i have to say that the rice was surprisingly good! Very moist and flavorful, it perfectly complemented the lamb dishes.

I can definitely see us coming back here- and probably frequently, too. They have a menu board up front offering specials, including pistachio ice cream, that we plan on trying next visit.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,2,4,-mNL6BhpAmXxdHebDOoCig

The prices were very reasonable. I went with the $11.99 special of ground chicken and lamb kabobs and my co-worker went with the grilled chicken breast @ $8.99.

2192003,2013-08-26,0,TspQ9jCczz436RiJHJQYZw,"I've tried several Kabob places around the Eastside and have to say that Fresh Kabob is the best in terms of price, taste, and convenience.   Fresh Kabob is one of my go-to lunch spots.  

I usually get #4 Beef Shish kabob for a great price $9.   The quality of the beef shish kabob is a little inconsistent though; most of the time it is tender and so very good, but sometimes it is a little tough.  The #1 Koubideh $7 is also good if you like ground, seasoned beef.  Sometimes the koubideh is a little too dry though.   That's why Fresh Kabob ends up with a 4 star, instead of 5.

You get a lot of sides with your entry: grilled tomato, small salad, rice, and pita bread.   The rice is the best out of all the kabob places I've tried... fluffy and moist, not dry and hard like elsewhere.   Don't forget to get some of the best mint chutney on the Eastside (spicy and sour green sauce), at the counter; I use that mint chutney with everything (meat, rice, and salad).

Fresh Kabob is located in the corner of a mini strip mall just south of the airport so there is plenty of parking in the lot.   You order and then wait for them to call your number.   There are comfortable sofas for waiting and a soda machine that also dispenses soda water (besides plain water).

Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. 

The young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly. The gentleman who gave me my food, apologized for the wait (15 minutes is not long in my book, but maybe for some it is), and said that calling ahead is a great option if you're ever in a hurry in the future. 

I ordered a lamb and chicken shish kabob. They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored. The green sauce that was at the counter where you pick up your food was perfectly spiced and I put it on EVERYTHING! I appreciate the fresh lemon wedge that was included in my to-go container. 

My only real complaint was the price. It was more than $17 for two kabobs, which I thought was on the expensive side. If they took their prices down around $2, I'd be here way more often that is good for my wallet...",xFSLb_pxXta5G4oaRB1ylQ,4,3,5,641ca8i5v5RZK9IngojV2Q

2535157,2018-06-24,0,TspQ9jCczz436RiJHJQYZw,I'm going to be honest here with this review. I usually love kabob places and I saw that this place had 4 stars and I was impressed by the amount of reviews and rating so I decided to give this place a try. So I came here yesterday with my man and we were a little disappointed in this place see he's Persian and he always takes me to good Iranian places and this place has like a twist between Iranian and Mediterranean flavors. We got the chicken kabob plate with the rice and salad and we also got the shirazi salad for the appetizer. So I'll start with the appetizer. Shirazi isn't supposed to be spicy they add jalapeños and not enough salt. Don't get me wrong I love spicy stuff but when it comes to this it's not supposed to have that ingredient in it. And the chicken it was alright a little on the salty side but it wasn't horrible. And for the rice I'm going to be brutally honest here it seemed like low quality basmati rice it just didn't taste too well. I hate having to rate this place a two but I was more disappointed than impressed like I hoped I would be. Maybe I'll give them a second chance someday idk.,6cWG68FRJmudUrxddj9Feg,2,0,2,MhIwsQzn-t4uQkLxpcKMKA

Wow, am I a fan! Their chicken kubideh is on point and their chicken kabob was super tender, juicy, and flavorful! I substituted the rice for fries (because honestly, I'm middle eastern and I'm tired of eating rice haha). The only thing I can say about the food is that I paid nearly $20 for the #11, a drink, and the garlic sauce. Granted you get bread, a small salad (which was just a bunch of greens on top of some onions), and a grilled tomato... I still felt like it was a bit much. I mean maybe its the setting that throws me off because if you were to go to cheesecake factory it would probably be the same cost if not more.

3349981,2018-01-05,0,TspQ9jCczz436RiJHJQYZw,"Christmas day, driving into Vegas, and we have a couple of hours before catching our flight out of town. We are in the mood for kebabs, and our usual ""go-to"" place is closed. Proximity to the airport and decent reviews wins the family vote for our travel day Xmas meal. 
When you enter, you proceed to the counter to place your order. We ordered a good sampling of menu items - A plate of mixed kebabs - chicken and beef kubideh kebab platter with rice and mixed salad greens, a plate of chicken kahari, mantu meat dumplings, eggplant bademjan, and a side of mast-o-musir.
Interestingly, the menu offerings represent a variety dishes from several close yet distinct cultures. Mantu meat dumplings are more of an Afghani food, while kubideh kebabs, eggplant bademjan and mast-o-masir are all classic Persian offerings. Finally, chicken kahari is traditionally a dish of Pakistani origin. 
For the Persian offerings, the chicken kubideh kebab was delicious- balanced in seasonings, and moist. They were so good that we ordered another 2 chicken kebabs at the end of the meal to take with us on the plane, but somehow managed to eat them before even leaving the restaurant. The beef kebab had a bit of an ""off"" or sour taste, almost as if the beef was a day or two beyond the expiration date. We would not order the beef kebab again. The eggplant bademjan was well fried and served with a generous amount of olive oil, with a nice drizzle of a mild garlicy yogurt. This is a tasty appetizer best shared by at least 3 or more people as it quite heavy if you plan to eat any thing else. the mast-o-musir was perfect: thick creamy yogurt elevated with shallots and mint. The perfect compliment to the kebabs.
The mantu dumplings were acceptable, but the outer pasta-like dumpling shell was crisp . At other Afghani restaurants, the dumpling shell is served traditionally as soft - like al dente pasta. We would probably not order this item again. These dumplings were filled with ground beef, served on a bed of lentils and covered in a mild yogurt sauce. 
Finally, the Pakistani dish, chicken Karahi, was the surprise entree of the whole meal. It was as good as any accomplished Pakistani home cook would make. Chunks of chicken bathed in a savory, rich, tomato based sauce softly blanked with the typical tapestry of spices used in Pakistani cooking, and complimented with bell peppers and onions. 
The pita / naan served with most of the entrees is soft and fresh. 
Note that at the end of the counter where you order, is a dispenser for a classic green Afghani sauce that goes well with the kebabs. It is a mildly spicy cilantro-vinegar based sauce. There is a sign that tells you ""one per order"" and there are micro-containers into which the sauce can be dispensed. It is an addicting sauce- but the management does not need to appear  so ungenerous with the sign and tiny containers. Do they mean once little container for a big order with multiple plates? One little container per person?
Overall, this restaurant is fast, casual, provides generous portions, moderate prices, along with a multicultural variety of offerings. The chicken kubideh kebabs, mast-o-masir, and chicken kahari all warrant a return visit!",H9uv2jAZOpMO05v8d4rKog,0,0,4,Fh9UWZe2BU2-EpM2ZF0y7g

2. It was very good, a 3.8 or 3.9, rounded to a 4 for star rating purposes. The food is Persian food, think Iranian, if that makes it easier to understand the geographical aspect from which the food is derived.

3. The YELP coupon, pay $20 for $40, was certainly a bonus.

4. First, being situated across from the runway at McCarran IAP in full view of the departing and arriving aircraft was a great visual treat, particularly at dusk. That added to the very clean, well-lit, self-service restaurant in the small strip mall across the street.

5. Now for the food! Very good stuff. We each enjoyed a kabob, one chicken, one beef, and both were normal portion size, and tasty. Both served with a different type of rice, and flatbread nan. We also had a small, locally packaged salad, again, good, and unique tasting in a positive way.

6. For dessert, we had a pre-packaged pistachio ice cream cup that was great and unique.

7. As for service, the gentleman that took our order from behind the counter was simply excellent and accomodating at every point - refreshing to experience. In fact, he helped us approach and maximize our coupon to hit very near the $40 coupon we purchased.

My husband got #11, a chicken shish kabob and kubideh plate. The kubideh was our favorite, it had so much flavor and was nice and tender. The shish kabob was also very good.

Falafel plate was good as well! Their falafel is the best I've had so far here in town.

The rice is good, albeit slightly bland. The pita bread/nan was very good.

Here's the deal.  We ordered a gyro and a wrap, along with some hummus.  Dude behind the counter was nice, but for some reason he only talked to me (even though my husband was also talking to him), and he called the gyro a ""j-eye-row.""

The hummus came out first, and we started to chow down.  After a couple bites, I looked at my husband and asked how he liked it.  I asked because it tasted like...air.  Like nothing.  It looked like hummus, it felt like hummus, but it didn't taste like anything.  He thought about it and said ""it couldn't be blander.""  So, the hummus was a bust.

When our food came out, we were pleasantly surprised.  The meat in both was good--though extremely salty--and flavorful.  It was a nice contrast to the lifeless hummus, but I definitely think that it was a tad overpriced.

Overall, we agreed that we wouldn't be coming back.  It wasn't the worst thing ever, but it definitely didn't meet our expectations.  We eat out a lot, and it is always a bummer to spend money on a meal that is just meh.",BgF9Iy2wKPLYAcU-1Kfq_w,2,1,2,m4vtdDr6hVEeC-pa6Xi52Q

I usually get the sirloin kabob which is flame broiled and seasoned to perfection each time.  My husband gets the beef kubideh special & of course, it's bomb!!  The saffron rice has a unique buttery flavor and is firm and delicious.  Veggie kabobs are again seasoned perfectly, juicy and just grilled enough to not be mushy.  The mast-o-kihar is by far my favorite and the bread u get to dip it in is fluffy, warm and made to order - just like everything else.  

When you eat at fresh kabob, u get fine-dining quality food at counter service prices! And to top it off?

Back in the Flame days I would have given them 5 stars, but in the years since ownership changed hands, it's not quite the same.  There is inevitably a super long wait time, whether the place is empty or full, and there is always some issue. A couple of times the soda machine was down, once they were out of taftoon bread, once out of chicken, once there was no furniture (I think this was a dispute with the previous owner).  Just always something irritating.  The wait time, coupled with the issues knocked my rating down on this $10-15 counter order establishment.

I generally order the Chicken Shish meal for $9 and a friend and I share the mast-o-khiar $2.5 (cucumber and mint yogurt dip), but today I went for the Chicken Karachi $7 because the picture shows a bunch of veggies and didn't want rice (their rice is so good, but so bad for me!).  The meal I got didn't really look like the picture.  I didn't have many veggies and I did not care for their sauce.

These kabobs are fresh and super tasty. The chicken is all white meat chicken breast and the steak is very, very high quality beef. The seasonings are just right -- not too spicy for a normal palate yet packed with flavor. Make sure you get a side of their homemade green sauce, it is killer good. 

The freshly baked naan-style bread is amazing. I could gobble it up plain but I like to stack my meat on top so it soaks up the juices. Since I am a low carb eater, I didn't try the rice but instead got a side salad. It, too, consisted of simple yet high quality ingredients. They only have one housemade salad dressing that's exotic and very fresh tasting. This isn't a place to go if you are in a rush, they really do cook everything to order so it can take about 15 minutes to get your dinner.

The main dining room is nothing special but is decorated with pretty granite tables and there's even a nice couch seating area. There are a few tables outside on a small patio that afford gorgeous views of McCarran's runway so you can watch planes take off and land while you eat. The restaurant is located in a nondescript shopping strip center amongst office buildings and gets super popular during the workday; go in the evening or on the weekend for less crowds. 

There are three main problems I have with this place. One, the prices are just too high. I know fresh, made-to-order food costs money, but when I have to shell out nearly $40 for two of us to eat a light dinner at a quick service restaurant, that's really hitting me in my pocketbook! The portion sizes are out of whack with the prices; the portions are pretty small yet still expensive. I had to order TWO kabobs to fill me up.

Two, the overuse of styrofoam sends a bad message. Why trash our environment more by using ALL styrofoam? Surely there's a more eco-friendly way to plate your food! Styrofoam containers are so 1980, get with the modern times. People do care about our environment and responsible business owners should too. 

Third, the employees can be a little off-putting. It was my first time in and the guy taking my order seemed less than thrilled to have me as a guest. As I sat waiting for my food, several other patrons came in and told the guy behind the counter that it was their first time and even asked for recommendations. The employee said, very bruquesly, that he didn't know what they would like and offered ZERO help to these poor people. That's a sure way to make sure people NEVER set foot in your restaurant again.

I absolutely love the food here and the quality and taste of my meal outweighed all of the negatives, thus resulting in my 4 star review.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,0,0,4,uyMumqGmOYgO6WOoCcn8Vg

I received flavorful yet very dry ground beef kebab on top of the driest rice I've ever had. Garnished with a ""salad"" that was nothing more than spring mix laid next to my food. Why even add this ""salad"" to the dish if you're going to do nothing but take it from the container and plop it on the food. Was it just for the added color? 

I received a large lemon wedge which I guess is their idea of how you're supposed to moisten up there dry meal. Problem is they don't deseed their lemons before they give it to you. I had to use my finger and dig out eight lemon seeds from my lemon wedge. Yes you read that right 8 lemon seeds! Thankfully I don't dislike lemon so it did help make this meal tolerable but for the folks that don't like lemon this would not be a great meal. They really should offer some sort of sauce to help out their dry meat, dry rice, dry salad greens.

They also forgot to put the tomato in my to go box that I see is advertised on other pictures.

On my first visit I ordered a Beef Kabob plate. I really liked the beef kabob and I liked the saffron rice as well. The veggies on the side were good too. The only thing missing was maybe a small hummus or cucumber sauce side for dipping the pita bread. 

My second experience was ordering takeout for a work lunch. Placing an order for 10 was easy and ready in 25-30 minutes. They have many reasonably priced meals which made it easy to stay within T&E limits for our lunch. All of our orders were correct and everyone enjoyed their meals. The only room for improvement was on the way they packaged some of the to go orders. There were large skewers stabbed through the takeout boxes from top to bottom. When we removed them to separate the to go containers we ended up with leaking juices due to the holes in the bottom of the containers.

The Shredded Chicken Wrap was my choice for my work lunch. I liked the variety in this meal. It included a yummy grape leaf, hummus, and sauce for the wrap. The flavor on the chicken was good and I liked the flavor of the chicken and sauce together. It was very messy though.

Overall, a great lunch spot. The menu is large and offers a nice variety of plates and wraps. I like the variety of meats offered too. Pricing is very reasonable.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,6,3,4,Tyc3iqyCKllTeuZW1-GAaw

CONS: Strike #1: no silverware, fries didn't come with ketchup & chicken kabob didn't have any sauce or garlic sauce i'm used to. Strike #2: the chicken was tough to bite into & under cooked in the center
PROS: Chicken seasoning was perfect otherwise. Love the warm, soft chewy bread & Salmon was super tasty & perfectly cooked. Interesting touch hummus garnished with blk olives ontop!

The Tenderloin is very tender, juicy and grilled to perfection with a tiny bit of that burnt grilled crust for extra flavor. It's all great. The only reason why I had to give 4 stars is because I feel the customer service has slightly gone down, maybe management has changed or something.

Well, since I don't visit the post office next door very often, and I don't live on that side of the city either, I don't usually make a detour for Kabob.
Surprisingly the dining room area is bigger than it looks like from the outside. There are some comfortable couches to sit down while waiting for To Go orders.
They have fountain drinks for $1.99, or a variety of other beverages in the refrigerator from $1.49 and up.
Daily special was $11.99, three different meats (beef, chicken and lamb Shish kabobs) with rice.
This time we ordered: 
Gyro with French fries.
Very little meat inside pita bread, lots of iceberg lettuce with sauce, and french fries. It was tasty.
Tenderloin Chicken Shish kabob on the platter with saffron rice, garnished with onions and some green leafs and grilled tomatoes. Freshly made, chicken was very tender and tasty. 
I watched them making my dinner through the glass!
We also ordered cheese cake.
Desserts are not made on promises, some outside company supplies it! (I think Manan)

The hummus was a bit chunky texture not smooth and full of olive oil like most really good hummus. They also gave you 4 small pieces of bread when you ordered the hummus, you need more bread for the amount of hummus you get, I can tell the hummus was made days before and stored in the fridge. It came in a styrofoam cup and lid and it was cold so they just grabbed it from the fridge.

I had a combo plate: chicken, beef tenderloin, half rice/half salad and a yogurt drink. Almost $19!!! NOT cheap and all of which, was mediocre at best. The chicken was a bit dry and seasoned poorly. The tenderloin was tough and chewy, I had to spit some of it out and could not finish it. The salad was weak...not traditional middle eastern salad and skimpy slices of onion. The rice was good. There are much better options for bottled yogurt drinks too. The service was fast food style at best. The owner...or manager...barely looked up while he was frantically counting his money in the register like he was late for a mortgage payment. I had to say hello. Not sure where all these great reviews come from...they can't possibly be coming from middle easterners with love for traditional food! Hope they get their act together because Vegas could use a nice kabob house, but for now...this place is not it!

The service was relatively quick and you have a nice view of the planes landing at the airport.  The prices are fairly standard for the type of cuisine they serve.  However, the chicken and beef kubideh I ordered had more of a southwest Asian flavor to it whereas I was expecting Persian style food.  The difference is that the Pakistani/Afghani version is spicier as opposed to the Iranian way of preparing the same dish that's not spicy at all.  Although the distinction is subtle, it may be important to some people.  Also, there was no grilled tomato included with the meal, which is a hallmark of Persian kubideh.  The food was still okay.  The rice and naan that came with the kubideh were both good, but people should know that this is not an authentic Persian restaurant.",5GDXk5Y3QhXBL0BCm6plPQ,2,1,3,hwFlAFTPKlCXtF1hrAaYkg

5683004,2017-04-27,0,TspQ9jCczz436RiJHJQYZw,Fresh Kabob is a great Mediterranean restaurant off the beaten path close to the Vegas airport.  Whenever I'm near sunset park in Vegas I have to stop at Fresh Kabob.  My go to is the chicken Kabob and chicken lule combo with rice and salad.  The bread that comes with the meal is a great addition but be prepared for a lot of carbs.  The grilled whole tomato is a nice touch to the meal.  A must try is the house green sauce that tastes great with pretty much every bite of the meal.  The chicken Kabob and ground chicken skewer are both tender and freshly cooked which makes this one of the best Mediterranean places in town.  Its location would be the only downside since I live a bit away but when I'm craving Kabob and have time for a drive I would chose this place.,hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,1,0,4,wA6w4zngbhvh2nYJoD25eA

you get plenty of good proteins that, unlike other places, are not super greasy! And their prices are super reasonable. 

I got myself 2 chicken breast skewers, which were perfectly seasoned but not oversalted, juicy, and especially not greasy; it came with rice and I don't really care that others have said it can use seasoning... for me it was perfect the way it was. I do not prefer salt in my dishes. Same for the salad, I got dressing on the side but decided to sprinkle ilt with lemon. And last but not least... their BREAD! Omg! Fluffy but not yeasty or heavy, seasoned but not super salted or fattening ... stayed pretty pretty soft hours after being served... (we took boxes to go)... that was the best pita style bread I have ever had in my whole life. 

In other words, this feels to me an extremely authentic experience and I was so happy I could eat here to complete fullness without having to worry about messing up my macros :)))))

Most of the halal options that i found via yelp were closing or closed due to my flight arriving at 9 PM. I was lucky to find this establishment still open thus drove up & looked over the menu. I ordered the hummus and chicken kabob plate. Hummus was grainy but the bread provided with it was nice and flaky. The kabobs themselves from what i saw in the pictures from previous reviews looked grilled but mine appeared to have been grilled and than cooked in a pan since they didnt have a crusty exterior on them as you would normally expect. Aesthetics wise it didnt look good but did taste fine to me. I am giving it two stars, the service was decent just the food wasnt what i would expect.

The staff is friendly and helpful as I did ask some questions as this was my first visit. I decided on the #4 (1) Tenderloin beef shish kabob. The meal includes fresh bread, tomato, onion, mixed greens and saffron rice. $8.99

The meat was dry, tough and chewy the taste it left in my mouth was that of burnt charcoal.  Wow so disappointed I was as the meat should have been the star of the meal. The saffron rice and the fresh taftoon persian bread was good however not enough to warrant a repeat visit.

My meal by itself cost $9 and change for a couple small bits of meat, rice, homemade taftoon persian bread, veggies and a bitter tomato.

Yeah, I don't think I will be making a return visit here anytime soon. I really wanted to like and enjoy this place since is so close to work :(.

I was left unsatisfied, empty, wanting more, needing more, and in need of something to remove the bad taste from my mouth.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,7,3,2,u11BxvempdZgkhjOGv_pCQ

Being this is my normal Sunday/Monday lunch spot its surprising that I've only ever had two items on their menu but as far as the ground lamb and the lamb chunky kabobs are concerned they are to die for. I usually get the combo and ask for extra lettuce and I can make two meals out of that regular lunch; 

I'm usually there right as they open the doors for the day and its nice to see everyone scurrying around cleaning and prepping for the day. I've always been greeted warmly and once I gained that elusive ""regular"" status the staff would even tease me about never changing my order or for being more than 5 minutes past their unlocking of the door. 

Walking into the store you are bombarded with the intoxicating aroma of fresh meat and vegetables being grilled on an open flame.

I know that my last review for this place is also a 3* however this one is a not so shiny 3*. 

Here are they key reasons why:
Price increase with a inverse correlation to portion. (fancy UNLV talk for more money and less food)
The mix and match is now $11.99
The bread is now $1.99
Mat-o-khir is now $1.99 (albeit you get 1/2 a round of bread with it)

Frequent eater punch card:
They changed it from meals to visits. In addition I told them that I forgot the card once or twice and they gave me a new one. The cards totaled more than enough for a free meal however, they did not honor it. 

This place has been my default Kebob place in Vegas for nearly 5 years but I am slowly falling out of love with it as I no longer feel that it is a great value that it once was. I may have to search the valley for another spot to get my Kabob fix at.
