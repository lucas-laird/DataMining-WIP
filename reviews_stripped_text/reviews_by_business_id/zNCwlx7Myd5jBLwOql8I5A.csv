Tried to go eat lunch there last Saturday ( with our 16 month old son) and was told they only serve lunch in the bar.
Ewww, no thanks ! Obviously with my son we couldn't , but why would I want to eat in a smokey bar?! They advertise lunch , but apparently not the case anymore .
Very disappointed in the 2 times we tried it since the move. We would eat there all the time before , even recommended it to locals and out of town friends and family .    
I really hope they get the same quality of food and management back like they use to.
We will not be back anytime soon.",fRNdhxULxOCEsWXb3esdUA,1,0,2,_fUNpHIM2tOXXRDLJJwRHQ

We were greeted by the owner at the door and he was very nice.  We ordered the fried mozzarella to start and it was decent.  My wife ordered the pasta primavera which she loved.  I had the shrimp diavolo (?) which was also very good.  Great flavor, the pasta and shrimp were cooked perfectly and our side dishes, salad and minestrone soup, were also very good.  The service was great and if I lived here, I would definitely frequent this place.",Nwo4xEpnR7tTfcpOR8JS7w,0,0,4,-vcTtFUiSM7aHffqyyd3kA

What were you thinking???  This place was bomb I've never seen a bigger disaster!! People from all over the country have heard of this place, how could you screw that up!!  Dumbest story ever!!",S6un-WIdw5ybbatDlm-Nkw,1,1,5,yX4RawGmvGFAN6VuIJRDew

Booth seats were ripped, fake plants covered in dust. They need a major overhaul. Caesar salad salty, chicken parm had an aftertaste that was not pleasant. We ordered a side of pasta with garlic and oil, which they forgot to serve us. Sorry that we reminded them to bring. Tasted like metal and old oil. Will not return in the near future.",j0S6WR4tkM50fVZJcTH7rg,3,0,2,_YTZAkBj3FFFiSmX-VXD8g

Soggy, greasy breading, and too much of it, and off flavor.  Scrap the Clams Casino.

My friend and her husband had dinner at Carluccio's a couple of weeks ago.  She had Veal Piccata and said it was awful.  No lemon flavor and no capers.  Apparently Carluccio's doesn't use capers, one of the two key ingredients in this recipe.  She said don't bother but, being who I am, wanted to see if she was being picky,  She wasn't.  It was AWFUL.  Bland, faint lemon flavor and again an odd aftertaste.   
Scrap the Veal Piccata.

The entrees come with a side of pasta but I preferred to substitute this for ravioli.  I asked for meat sauce (twice) and got, you guessed it, ravioli smotherd in Marinara sauce.  Bland, watery and unappetizing.  Scrap the Ravioli.

My Caesar Salad was good, fresh and had the perfect amount of dressing.

My dinner companians said their meals were just okay, but one liked hers very much.  She had shrimp. 

We aren't going back.

Scrap Carluccio's.",TGYVnlAY0R8WX4IagRiuRw,3,2,1,Ib-qCMBWfcRWXdK-nZwmRw
3127668,2012-09-06,0,zNCwlx7Myd5jBLwOql8I5A,We had dinner there tonight and it took 2 1/2 hrs.  We were a party of 10 and it took an 1 1/2 hrs to get the first plate.  The worst part was they brought all the adult food first and 20 minutes later brought the kids chicken fingers and spaghetti.  After dinner they didn't even clear the table before dessert.  There were only like 4 other tables so it wasn't packed.  Food was pretty good but not worth a trip back.,7qsSe-2XHTl7RqlrqwPTQg,2,0,1,cyo9iz1G0TZbQhQtV0B1Sg
3298115,2012-09-12,0,zNCwlx7Myd5jBLwOql8I5A,Overpriced food and terrible service. There's far too many great Italian restaurants in this town to waste your money and time at this one.,wMIJGvKsnPD_T2OKoCXJlQ,1,0,1,R7NOiLDPUN7BRMlvnt2y3w
4008751,2012-09-20,0,zNCwlx7Myd5jBLwOql8I5A,"I really wanted to like this place.  The small wait staff works hard. The is menu is very extensive with a really good variety and the prices are fair. But they lack focus on who they are.  The menu talks about their pizza, but I didn't see anyone ordering it.  There's lots of Pasta choices as well as other entr√©es.  They have a Liberace piano that's played on Fridays. The food was okay, but rather bland.  Nothing about this place was anything ""special.""  I left with a sense of unrealized potential.  If Gordon Graham could spend a day with them Las Vegas could have another A+ Italian restaurant instead of just another pasta place.",gfY5hPf4umUmBSoKg4ulmA,0,0,3,ZXTNrnFpY-6iu21vkWtaXw
4098833,2012-01-24,0,zNCwlx7Myd5jBLwOql8I5A,"My roomate and myself were looking to try a different italian place so we did a search and found this place.  It is inside of Doc Hollidays and turns out to be the same place that was on Trop and Spencer.  That being said, the food was really good and our server Bill was fantastic.  Definitely will be back.  
The only downside, and this is a minor thing, but it was very loud.  That being said, it was loud because there were a couple of big parties there and certainly not enough to keep me from coming back.",FO18LqVB1lvLUmB3wc5Y0Q,3,0,4,ycozSXzjl1bWb419Y_artw
