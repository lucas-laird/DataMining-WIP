I pull up Friday and order a double jack mean with regular fries and a rootbeer . I get to the window , she is scrolling on her phone . Cool idc . But she then grabs curly fries , fingers touching them mind you , after touching a phone she probably takes all over he store and bathroom . So I reminder that bag isn't mine as I was watching her , she seemed confused looked in the bag went and got the right fries . I drive all the way home and the burger is the regular jumbo jack not the double but the regular but I paid for the double which is a couple dollars more .. okay whatever I let it pass .. 

THE NEXT DAY!! 
Same girl I ordered 
-#12 medium with rootbeer 
-double jack with sprite and regular fries 
-kids meal
-2 tacos 
-cheesecake 

They didn't have the cheesecake so she gave me 2 cakes , kids meal was fine . She didn't give me my sandwich for my #12 , didn't even ring up the tacos . This girl is not paying attention and it's beyond frustrating . Bring the boy manager back more often he gets the orders right ... I rarely go here but I may not even go back it's so frustrating .",gaM0sISnDeGcePTCVx20sw,0,0,1,e2NljdITvzEsQHgTqmTZZg

After a homeless guy accosted us in the drive thru, which is after a TV show skit-worthy attempt to order a large cherry Sprite (come hell or high water, he wanted to give us a large curly fries...Of course the screen is broken!); this mess is what they call jalapeno poppers!

For real, y'all?",QeHm1e8h6fakyMJm8KcAtg,0,0,1,zqR4v3ISZCb1cH74PdLBMg
