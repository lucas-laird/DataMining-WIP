I got some hot sauce which tasted like spaghetti sauce, the ramp had too much mayonnaise, nothing tasted good.",Wu-yg4k0EgOeU2xuG6tcyw,0,0,1,c0A9ZkgpYg0sR7J-aghm7Q

It's a great little to-go where you can also get a nice cup of margarita if you so desired (yes please, who says no to tequila?) 

I visited this place often on my way back to my room to pick up a bedtime margarita. They do shut by about 10-11pm so you can't really get here that late. The restaurant is a few doors down where there's a full bar and sit down dinner served. This basically has a few stools and high tables for you to park at if you wanted to have a quick bite before you go on your way. 

The service was usually ok, sometimes there seemed to be a bit of a wait on the food getting out but other times it was a relatively painless operation. 

The food isn't the best, but it hits the spot when you're hungry and need an itch scratched and they do have a limited bar as well. Not much more you can ask for in a hole in the wall really.",CwyCsrcU4b0l-1FvQnnWtA,0,0,3,iGpDfmZpK3HJcwXqdqPKzQ

I'm always in a rush at breakfast because I can't be bothered to get out of bed or out the door as early as I should.  Cadillac to Go whips out fresh, delicious breakfast burritos in less than 10 minutes.  

Lunch is just as quick!  I love their chicken avocado wrap.  Everything is cooked and seasoned just right, and chopped nice and small.  No awkward burrito moments when you bite into it and pull out an entire wing or something.  Awkward burrito moments are the worst, right?  And you won't experience one at Cadillac to Go.  Trust me, I'm as awkward as they come.  Enjoy!",2MD7YF90xxjqPIAS4vcWjw,1,1,4,pFXXqCAiJ-d-BBEjh8ivYg
3570594,2016-02-28,0,7re6iyJY2v4Zb3x3hJnkaA,Nothing good to say about this place. Food was lousy and the person who seats is terrible. The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars was because my friend like the desserts. The bus boy was pleasant,2vLZGxi7klMxbiPki59ogQ,0,0,2,yrN3fORFrxF9xne2I7sQHg
3958428,2014-05-24,1,7re6iyJY2v4Zb3x3hJnkaA,"Cadillac To Go is a little stand with two tables, just off the new Cadillac restaurant and bar, in The Golden Nugget. The food was all right, but man what a cluster! We went late night. Two of my friends ordered the same beer, but they only poured one. When my friend asked about her draft, after we all had our food, the woman responded with ""I know"" and walked away. I don't think she did know, though she eventually returned with the beverage.
I ordered a breakfast taco, that was supposed to come with eggs and hash browns. I was served beef tacos instead, and when I took them back, was given something else I did not order. I  gave up. I was hungry and it did taste pretty darn good. The full restaurant probably has better service, and we would have been better off eating at a sit down, time wise. 

I think that management needs to fine tune the service here. Based on how awesome CJ is doing next door, it is only a matter of time before they get this sorted out.",uyQ_lCy_2DEBNawQTK4kfg,1,1,2,3GYpNY2FcpxcRFKXv8xkfA

Now the service... Awkward and not great... I'm in Vegas, there's 1000s of restaurants, I will not choose this place... Our girl came by once and gave a weird look.  Over heard the table next to us say, your lucky you're good looking because the service sucks...that pretty much sums up the experience.",4WOUYfLxDEkPulk9vdubig,0,0,1,UKi2NicZMfxd9uUurxfVLw
4943838,2014-09-13,1,7re6iyJY2v4Zb3x3hJnkaA,"I got the Beef Fajita tacos as that is what the guy Isaac recommended ($6.99). It was very good. Tender & seasoned beef, avocados, onions, veggies & jalapeños in a soft shell. Food came out quick & fresh. And Isaac was very friendly. Thumbs up. Great place for something real quick to eat. They have a restaurant next door too which seems nice.",XTEmaVwAkdRyrYP45zd7iw,2,2,5,XrPq4KnNUX2BgEr_P0tnMQ
5607204,2016-09-14,0,7re6iyJY2v4Zb3x3hJnkaA,"Food, nothing special but priced way better than the other places in the hotel. The first night, I was pretty hungry after sleeping all day so I decided to come down and get some nachos. They were super yummy! I should have asked for no peppers, I think they were chilis because jalapeños are usually ok with me, but these were super small. Anyway, I picked them suckers off because I didn't have enough water or lemonade to wash it all down.  The chicken was nicely grilled and juicy and the cheese was the nice liquid cheese that I'm use to on nachos. I'm not a fan of real cheese shredded on top, I enjoy me some melty cheese. It also came with a side of guacamole, but wished I also had a side of sour cream as well. Who serves just guacamole on the side and not sour cream? I guess the sour cream was maybe drizzled on my nachos? I don't know, I couldn't really tell. But I would totally go get those nachos again!

The second visit, I got the chicken avocado wrap. This was not a hit with me. The dressing was the only thing I tasted. I couldn't taste anything that was actually in the wrap. It was so heavily coated in the dressing that I made myself choke it down. The bright side to this one was the side of grapes. I enjoyed those grapes so much. 

Overall, if I were to ever stay at the Golden Nugget again (see my review for the nugget, not so happy with them) I'd totally come here to eat. Other wise, I will always remember Cadillac as my saving grace while staying at the nugget.",9AkgCftyMxFkLdwlcdDjBw,0,0,4,T9pipJNVJcnBXKMEGBu3mw
