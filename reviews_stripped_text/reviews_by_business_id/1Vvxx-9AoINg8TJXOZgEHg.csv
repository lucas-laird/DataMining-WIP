22451,2012-07-16,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"I came across this restaurant in a travel guide (yes, my family still buys them occasionally) about a year ago.  I was looking for Mexican food and initially chose Los Dos Caminos over it because they offered free chips and salsa (silly, but important...who wants to pay for just chips and salsa?!?) Now Dos Caminos is closed (so sad) so we decided to give Yolos a try.  The chips are now free (unless they always were and I was thinking of a different restaurant).  The tacos are delicious as is the cilantro rice.  I have never had rice like that before and it was amazing!  The margaritas were also delicious.  

I'm surprised at the complaints about the price.  Our meal at Yolos was cheaper than any other meals we had on our trip.  I felt that the price was comparable to my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago.  

We ate early, so the restaurant was almost empty.  The atmosphere is cool, dark booths illuminated by the drink menu.  Our service was excellent.

I will definitely come back on my next trip.",4LlW9fw3f6tNjR5z_Rb-fQ,0,0,4,594VLQUnMONNmwi5ViF4qA
28617,2010-01-11,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this place.  Planet Hollywood has two other Mexican restaurants in the Miracle Mile that get so-so reviews and I expected Yolos would be like that but it was actually great.  The food was really good, with more complex flavors than your standard Mexican place of this price range.  We were there for Sunday brunch and they have a special brunch menu which looked good but we ended up ordering off the regular menu so I guess I can't comment on the brunch menu (although it did have a very tempting ""Hangover Stew"" which I would ask you to try just to tell me how it is).  The queso fundido was the best I've had anywhere, and the nachos were really good as well, every chip had a ton of yummy stuff on it.  The tortilla soup was spicy and they poured it over the tortilla strips as tortilla soup should be done.  The guacamole that came on the side of the dishes was very good so I would bet the guacamole appetizer is even better.

The service was a little too in your face, but that also meant that it was very attentive so I guess that's a toss up.  I would recommend this for a good casual lunch.",mlgiry9XO2wYxqfWDDVsUg,0,0,3,QBcs0Wsb1T_pNEB2PPGMDw

I ordered the Gaucho Steak. Appeared to be a sirloin and was supposed to be rubbed with red pepper. Looked and tasted a lot like black pepper. I was over cooked as well. Luckily the mushrooms, asparagus, and potatoes were good so not a total loss. Although not worth the price tag. I mentioned the doneness issue to the waiter and a manager offered us two deserts.

One thing i noticed when dining alone is that service often is ridiculously good. No matter if you eat by the bar or not, they seem to care for you more and want to give you all the attention you need.

The sizzling fajitas combo was generous and tasty as it should and they have quite a few interesting cocktails as well. This place is located right off the casino floor so if you dont want the uptempo you should go somewhere else. Service was speedy and precise and they seem to have a great coordination in between each other. .

The name of the restaurant is actually YÖLOS which quite randomly involves the Swedish letter ""Ö"", but in this case i will not make any scene, just go with the flow.

She was sincere, professional, and kind and I appreciate that more than anything. I honestly would visit again now knowing how seriously she took this issue of allergies. The fact that she took time out of her busy day to contact me, refund my bill and assure me her team would be coached speaks volumes.

Now the guacamole will be made right in front of you fresh, the server will bring out the ingredients in a mixing stone which already has fresh lime juice in it.
At which he/she will mix it for you then place it on the table.

Food came out fast but it's street tacos, it's simple.
Nothing really stands out with the Mexican rice and black beans.
Same goes for the chicken as well.
Overall it's something that an ordinary cook at home could make and that's exactly what it reminded me of.

I was eyeing the ribeye but I figured I'd save to eat a steak from a steakhouse.

It took several minutes to get a table ready for us, because the hostess was so careful about getting the napkins and menus placed ""just so"" on our table. We were there for 1.5 hours total, and had time for only 1 drink because of the poor service. We were thinking that perhaps we were on a ""hidden camera"" show because we truly felt ignored.

STREET TACOS - these were also in a flour tortilla. Again chicken had good flavor and it's hard to mess up a small street taco. Fish street tacos also had good flavor

They had a lunch special with a salad and an entree for 12.99 i believe... that is what my friend and i did. You can also add a margarita to your lunch for 3.99 which is great!

Our server was great with making sure that everything i ordered was made vegan friendly and he was extremely nice about it! It is amazing how much your server's kindness can affect your experience at a restaurant! Anyway, i ordered a salad minus the sprinkled cheese that was on top and i also got the veggie enchiladas without cheese.. The rice and black beans were also vegan.

So I ordered the steak salad for $16.  A few bucks extra, I thought, but on the strip, so oh well.  The salad was huge and had a lot of moist, perfect temperature, marinated, real steak.

Move on to needing a quick bite again at PH and I take my mom and cousin.  We ordered the guac...only 1 and a 1/2 avocados for $11.  A little skimpy on the portion.  But they made it table side and it was good.  

Ordered the steak nachos...waiter does tell us it is only 7 nachos, not a pile...we say ok, well it was plated w 7 bites, but those bites had that same steak and about 2 1/2 bites of steak to each nacho.  I had to fork and knife the steak, but they were good and filling and we actually left one on the plate.

My mom ordered the steak burrito and again, it pretty much had a real, properly cooked medium rare, very pink, tender and marinated steak inside.  It was served with white beans and I prefer black, but otherwise a good choice.

Service was friendly and fast for the most part.  The chips, salsa, and guacamole were all delicious, although our guac was not prepared table side as others were :( We also had the queso fundido which was really great.

My first drink was the pink Cadillac (watermelon margarita) and it was great.  My second drink was even better though, and I continued to drink them throughout the weekend - it was the ""opposites attract"" (I think that's what it was called?

Food - No joke, I got a fajita with maybe two-three pieces of steak.  It's like half of it dropped on the floor and they were like, oh well, only two pieces left.  Serve it up.

On top of that, it was truly awful!  No flavor at all.  I was eating onions and peppers on bread.  That's lovely.

Service - When the waittress asked me about this, I told her.  No complaint, just told her my thoughts.  Now, when the MANAGER came over, he looked completely unprepared, hungover, and like he was in over his head.  He stuttered like a fool, and just walked away.  There was no conversation at all.

Total busch league here.  No people, and I'm a bit shocked they're in business.  By the way, their signs say they have hooka starting at 10PM, which is a misprint, yet they keep the sign up.  Kind of funny.

I had the carnitas street tacos, which come three to a plate.  There are also shrimp, chicken and fish options.  

The big hunks of shredded pork were plentiful but they were a little bland on their own.  With the addition of some great fire roasted salsa and guacamole though they were delicious and very filling.  I definitely couldn't finish all three.    The double white corn tortillas were very lightly fried just to give them some tooth so they were sturdy enough to hold up.   That was great.  I hate when the tortilla tears and falls apart and you end up with a mess. 

My companion had the beef enchiladas, which were topped with a green chili sauce.   They too were moist and the beef was shredded and plentiful.. but they were a bit too salty for me.  

Each plate comes with rice and beans.   We tried each type of rice and the cilantro rice was the clear winner for me. The other option was ""Mexican rice"" and it was your standard tomato-based concoction, just not super flavorful.   We didn't bother trying the black beans, we were both just too full. 

Plenty of beer and tequilas to go with... all in all a good bet (ha.. no pun intended)... and quite a substantial amount of food for your money.  I would go back.",8qtsJtmefjJZIFM6_Ksd7A,0,0,4,xljBFWaGahEtEPK4HN7-iQ

This isn't your average soup, you get an experience:
The shredded chicken, tortilla strips, and toppings come out in the center of the bowl. Then the waiter pours in the soup itself. Why is this glorious???  Compare your cereal that's been sitting in milk for a bit vs cereal right when milk is poured on it. One is soggy and one is crunchy. 

Tortilla strips are meant to be crunchy. Ask for a few slices of avocado and a squeeze of lime. It's the Mexican way to eat it. It adds greatness. 

The guac isn't very good. It needs more salt, like, onion, jalapeños, there are no tomatoes, and it's over blended. Leave some chunks in there for texture. I wouldn't recommend getting it if you have guac opinions. 

I've also ordered tacos from Yolos. They were surprisingly pretty good. I'd order them again if I wasn't so into the tortilla soup.

We had Gustavo as a server....he was pretty bad. He was either overwhelmed or distracted b/c he only checked on us a few times, and we ended up drinking somewhere else b/c of how bad he was. We were ready to spend a bunch of money on margaritas, but his service left us w/ a bad taste in our mouth. 

The hostess...on the other hand (not sure what her name was, but she had dark hair & was pretty cute) did a GREAT job. She was very welcoming, professional, and friendly. Plus, anytime were called her over (which was a few times) she took care of us immediately  with drinks, water, etc. 

Food was pretty good. They make the guac in front of you (I'm always a fan of that). My dad got enchiladas (not sure which ones). He said they were just okay. He mentioned a few times that the enchiladas and the black beans were missing something. My GF and I had some tacos. I had the Shrimp ones (Shrimp Baja  perhaps?), and they were pretty good. The shrimp was a different flavor than I had expected, but different in a good way!

The location wasn't bad, and the ""ambiance"" was pretty good. It was a little on the darker side (not like Darth Vader dark, but with minimal lighting LOL).

I know it is Vegas, and every drink is $15+, but I would have appreciated a bigger margarita glass. The ones we were served was not impressive for the amount. Overall, the flavors for the margs were pretty damn good.",hOBWk6Fu-O9pqlkVmWU3AA,0,1,3,SEFlnvdlXE0Qqdg_KUgVbQ

The margaritas here are the best I've had anywhere. They're so sugary sweet, but perhaps if you drink a few, the alcohol will catch up and kick you in the ass...maybe, but I didn't drink that many. I'm pretty sure they use real fruit to puree into it because you can taste the seeds from the raspberries. I enjoyed the mango best, but I'm partial to mango.

The karaoke DJ lost my friend's slip, went on some extended break where he just stood there, maybe checking his email or bidding on an eBay auction. I did sing a song and when I asked the KJ where to get my drink, he handed me a slip and told me to take it to the bar. When I did, the bartender gave me... a cheap, plastic EMPTY cup with the Yolos logo. When I asked him what he was going to fill it with, he laughed. And the I said, ""no, seriously. Where's the shot?"" and again, no laughs. I can afford to buy my own drinks but don't advertise something you're not going to deliver.

Every time I am in Las Vegas I make sure to get a drink at Yolo's  It's right off the strip and easy to access inside of Planet Hollywood.  While the bar isn't stocked like other bars the bartenders here make great use of the available booze.  They can make amazing drinks on the fly that aren't on the menu.  Prices are better than most strip adjacent bars.  Plus the chips and salsa's are pretty epic. Yeah its just chips and salsa but damn they nail it.  The waitstaff and bartenders are very nice, attentive and fast!

2817903,2012-03-15,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"The food in my opinion is very Americanized but was pretty good.  I was there with a group of ladies for a Bachelorette Party on a Friday night so they were somewhat busy. 

The chips and salsa they leave on the table are delicious. I love the baked chips and the salsa is the perfect blend of spicy but not too spicy.  Once I had a chance to look at there really cool electronic drink menu I decided on a frozen strawberry Margarita. The drink was super delicious! It was pretty awesome that you could create your own Margarita though. One side of there drink menu was the create your own Margarita and the other was a list of cocktails they offered. 

I decided on the Pork Carnitas street tacos for dinner. They came with a side of black beans and a choice of rice either Mexican or cilantro.  The meal was three small tacos with guacamole and salsa on the side of the plate. The tacos were just ok in my opinion. Personally nothing spectacular but not horrible either. I thought they were kinda of dry and needed just a little more sauce to make them better. I just used extra salsa to enjoy them a little more then I would have normally. 

Now price wise this is pretty expensive for Mexican but it is on the strip so that is what you get. People should not be surprised at how expensive it can be. On top of being a pretty expensive meal for one person because I was with a party of 8 or more thy added gratuity. Gratuity ended up being $6 for everyone which I thought was decent for Vegas pricing. 

The thing I really enjoyed was the decor and ambiance of Yolos. I loved the colors and lighting. Also we had excellent service from a very attentive waiter who was wonderful at helping a large group.",HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q,0,0,3,QYjpDbrW6hAsedJoTweUew

Ordered a few drinks, those were pretty good. I got a drink that was like a strawberry lemon drop with an edible flower. Super cute and delish.

I got the ceviche. My friend got carne asada tacos and their fresh tabletop guacamole. Nothing special about the food. Meat on the tacos looked dry. The guacamole was just regular, needed more salt and lime. The ceviche was alright needed something more.

I must say that the service/bartenders were on point, very courteous and worked as a team to take care of the customers, 5 stars to Alex and the rest of the bartender crew!!! As for the DJ(Ramsy), at first he did ok and played a good mixture but then got stuck on just playing Cumbia and Mexican music with the dance floor empty. I went to request a specific salsa song by Marc Anthony and his comment was disgusting! He proceeded to tell me with an attitude that he just played salsa 2 minutes ago and turned around and ignored me. A really good Dj takes the time to play what the audience/dancers would like. I didn't expect him to even play it right then either and just thought he was very rude and for that reason, I won't be going there any longer if I know he's the Dj!

I had to save it for after I finished my food because it tasted like that gum in the Zebra package I used to chew as a kid. Super sweet.

The food was pretty good. We order some dip; I can't recall if it was bean or cheese. The waitress warned us that it was pretty spicy, and she was right. But in a good way. I also ordered the enchiladas which were pretty darn good.

I do have to knock this place on a couple points, though. First, my sister's salad was weirdly salty; she couldn't even finish half of it. Second, the service really dropped off.

I ordered the 3 taco combo, actually my husband and I both did. We both ordered one el pastor, one shrimp and one carne asada. I ordered refried beans and spanish rice.  Our food arrived and looked tasty. I started with a bite of the el pastor taco and it was love at first taste, great flavor.. I knew after filling up on chips that I had to at least take a bite of each one before I got too full to try all three. Geez, I just wanted to keep gnawing on the el pastor but I put it down and picked up the asada taco and sunk my teeth in.. bleeeh.. the meat had no flavor, very disappointing. I got over the disappointment of the flavor lacking asada pretty quick knowing I had that little pastor unit waiting for me to return to him.. I picked up the shrimp taco and took a bite of juicy deliciousness. Man was I wishing I hadn't filled up on chips. I pushed away from the table determined to let my food settle because I was not letting el pastor escape.. I didn't want to waste belly room on beans and rice but I did have to try.. beans had no flavor like the asada and the rice was just ok.

From the start, the chips and salsa were amazing!  Also, as bizarre as it may sound, one of my main factors to judge a Mexican food restaurant is by if they serve queso dip.  No, I'm not talking about the more authentic queso fundido, but the actual dip that I can scoop up with a tortilla chip.  It's more of a Tex Mex staple than authentic Mexican and something that I can definitely appreciate as a native Texan.

This place not only serves queso dip, but it's probably some of the best that I've had in Las Vegas.

If you are on a budget however this is one of the better places to dine on the Strip if you aren't in a hurry to get somewhere. 

A client invited us to dinner here for a dinner and some drinks and it was underwhelming at best. Our server ignored us constantly (even with empty beer glasses/liquor drinks) which you think he would be eager to refill for us. It was after peak dinner hours and he had 4-5 tables at best. 
We are a pretty easy going group but walking by our table over and over again with empty glasses of anything is just unacceptable. 

The food was an alright blend of Mexican food. Nothing too shocking or blow your socks off on the actual menu or unique items you will be eager to try out. 

My favorite part of the meal without question was the table side guacamole they create for you and the salsa. These provided a great snack and I wish I only ate them for my meal. The enchiladas the server recommend for me we not as exciting as these chips/salsa/guac. 

If your a tequila drinker (I am not) you can select from over 60 types at the bar here. The place seems like an appropriate place for a quick lunch when you hop off the roulette or blackjack table.

The tortilla chips did not taste fresh and were not very good.
They didn't offer burritos.... what?  They only offer burritos M-Thurs (or something like that.)
The chicken quesadilla definitely tasted like something I could have made at home and was unimpressive.  Part of it was soggy (with what?  no idea), and there was dead space along the whole outside of the quesadilla that didn't have any fillings... so it was just bland tortillas.  Meh.

The hostess was kind of weird but after we were seated....we had exceptional service. I mean exceptional. Our waiter was friendly, honest and very customer service oriented. The entire staff (busboys, etc) were actually well presented.

The food....delicious! Very yummy mexican food...I had the shredded beef enchiladas and the appetizer guacamole and everything was very tasted. Worth every cent :D

The margarita.....eh it was tasty but not strong enough thats why I gave four stars",d2E1GEoCtxH8KSs8xp4UYQ,0,0,4,dguz9J8n3FrCtakwLOIgpw

The servers are great, Guillermo, Christina, Chris and Nadjana kept us happy with drinks and unique foods, they are all great fun!. The Drunken Chicken and Steak Nachos were both fantastic and I will miss them when we go home. The location is great, in the mix but not in the middle of the casino.

3304642,2016-12-25,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"This place has been consistently consistent! In terms of food, service, prices every time I visited Vegas. I give them a solid 4 stars:-

Was in Vegas recently and after many hours travel time, checking in, and dropping bags, was not ready to have a full dining experience. What I really like about this place is efficiency & good quality for $$ spent.

I believe kitchen closes at 10 pm, we arrived 9:30 and sat at the bar. Bartenders shared what's happening that weekend, and gave some good tips. I ordered the Mahi Mahi street tacos, delicious, plentiful, hit the spot, highly recommend them. Cost was $16, ordered Dos Quis Draft Lager $6.. very reasonable as well.

There was a DJ there spinning tunes and we are feet from the Planet Hollywood casino, so lots of energy all around. I'll def be back!",3oC57Z24H8GfR6jXiJJyUw,2,2,4,Xb806rxO7CdhNcDnUcLPzQ
3324005,2017-03-25,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,Bar is ok. Prices are not too bad but I can't recommend this place for the karaoke it advertises. They even advertise free shots for singers. The DJ takes requests but seldom let singers sing. The DJ just plays dance music.,KCe6vpEyxL-qokeRezFs2w,0,0,1,7FW82HTBGVEDSR_i1hhRig
3383714,2014-04-27,2,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"There's a scene in the dark knight. 
I've seen it like two thousand times. 
Seriously, I've seen it a lot. 
When I was a kid I watched Star Wars over and over again. 
It was on cable and my parents liked to leave me at home alone for really long stretches. 
I watched it so much, I memorized pretty much all the dialogue and songs in the movie. 
I'm old now, though. 
So I calculate I'll need to watch this batman movie at least eight thousand more times to memorize it all. 
Anyway, the scene where the joker tries to shoot the mayor; the only glimpse we get of him without makeup. 
That was about the time I ordered. 
About two minutes later, literally, my food arrived. 
It felt like I had traveled back in time and ordered before I arrived. 
God damn I wish that was possible. 
The self I send back would always be waiting in line. 

So I got nervous. 
Like, this one meal could ruin my whole trip to Vegas. 
It still might.
I'm writing this waiting for my check. 
But the food was decent enough.
The service was friendly, and very boobalicious. 
Oh, there's was also a very fit, attractive male also. 
Vegas must grow em on trees or something. 
Good looking people, not hot guys. What?

The bottom line is, if everything else is crowded and you're so hungry you could eat a dead rat off a sewer grate, then try this joint. 
Otherwise, earl of sandwich is right around the corner.",n4yxwGqopF90PHxgp0cOLg,1,1,3,Oz5W82fqMyOl8Td4BbwA3g

3415230,2017-02-19,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,I saw this place walking inside of planet Hollywood and I thought I would give it a try. I'm very familiar with authentic and great Mexican food. This however is neither. It wasn't terrible but definitely not going out of your way for. For the price it wasn't bad though if you are in need of something quick and affordable for the strip.

3431197,2011-12-27,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"Pretty good place! We went here after seeing the line and the wait for Spice Buffet, especially in respect to closing time; and P.F. Changs also having a wait.  Turns out Yolos was a good choice.  There was no wait, plenty of tables, nice atmosphere despite practically being in the casino and fast service.

The Tortilla soup was great. The mahi tacos were ok and the chicken fajitas were decent. I'd give the food three stars. The service was phenomenal and courteous; and very timely. Our food came hot and fresh, and a bit faster than we were ready.

It's not a bad place to try out. It isn't cheap, but not many places in Vegas are. It's not that expensive either.",J2752iXa_1ZPQtiQl5yZ0A,0,0,4,UxhgJq5-pvRSWiYQpnC08A
3444448,2015-08-29,1,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"Came for a late lunch a little before 3pm and the awful experience started from the very beginning. They didn't have any sort of lemonade (regular, strawberry, etc.). Half of their menu is varying levels of spicy, without any sort of indication. Usually menus at least try to put a pepper or something to indicate spiciness. We ended up ordering the steak nachos without the jalapenos and a caesar salad. There were 7 nachos in total, with a small piece of meat on top - completely ridiculous for about $12. The steak was very chewy and the portion size was laughable. The caesar salad was okay, nothing that special, but then again, there aren't a lot of ways to go wrong with a caesar salad. 

Service was awful, we were not checked on at all during our meal and considering there were 2 other tables there, the service was horribly slow. I can't even begin to imagine how their service would be during peak hours. We were given our bill when we had just begun to eat our food, which made it feel like our server was just trying to rush us out, when the restaurant was nearly empty.",hTZb1INhnCG8URaFywVoYQ,1,0,1,n_q8w0O6WKiWsvyzsORYHA
3467383,2009-09-09,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"I thought Yolos was great!
The margarita I ordered was literally the size of my head....ok my head is small....but still....

We started with the Guacamole. They make it fresh right at your table!
It was excellent....perfectly seasoned with all the right flavors. 
The tortilla chips were hot and fresh and the salsa was nice and spicy. For my entree I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Fajitas. The Portobello Mushroom came served on a hot, sizzling skillet cut into strips. It was so meaty and delicious! They served the fajitas with cilantro rice and black beans....SO GOOD!
For dessert we ordered the cheesecake and the chocolate lava cake. I didn't really care for the cheesecake but the lava cake was good. My favorite part about the desserts was the home-made cinnamon flavored whipped cream that came with them. That was something really special.
I would definitely recommend Yolos! Food and service were excellent!",4pefQIbqzrkPTlDSM62otA,1,1,4,nsaAIYvaTt_Ylwf0NPsOzQ
3472754,2009-10-19,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"I was really, really impressed with this place. We walked in on our way back from north-mid strip to the Luxor for a bite to eat in the midafternoon. It appeared to be a really basic hotel type restaurant -- mediocre food for a high price. But we were hungry and had 4.5 hours until our 9pm dinner reservations. We just needed a snack.

The chips and salsa were really good (the chips came out so hot it hurt a little to eat them at first), the guacamole was good, and both the ceviche was good and the taquitos were fine. My girlfriend claims that her strawberry margarita was the best she has ever had. They use real fruit to make their fruit margaritas, so I suppose it's not all that surprising.

The prices were perfectly reasonable.  Vegas' latest trend appears to be the ""sexy"" mexican restaurant. This was not that, but it was tasty... surprisngly so.",xFTXrAJrMFtsnr0GzHkcXg,0,0,4,0E-I3xH2cy_bwiZhrKBOZg

Staci Green and her staff were wonderful in their preparations and duties during the party.  Niko and Tony were outstanding in their duties behind the bar to ensure everyone had exactly what they wanted in very short order.  The food served was excellent and the drinks were top-notch as well.  We received many compliments from our party guest about the location, ambiance, food, and drink service.  If you are looking for a fun spot to host a gathering of party-goers in Las Vegas, then I can highly recommend Yolo's Mexican Grill and their bar area.

3496511,2013-08-14,1,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"We ate here for lunch with friends who were visiting from out of town last week. They had a decent (for the strip) lunch special which was various entrees for $9.95 with optional $5 margaritas.

Everyone except me opted for the special.... sadly, there were no veggie or fish options on the special menu, which meant that my food and drink came out to a whopping $29.

My shrimp tacos were pretty forgettable, I barely touched my beans and rice, and you have to pay for chips and salsa. Lame.

I'm not normally a cheapskate, I swear, but for mediocre food at lunchtime? No thanks. Instead of bang for my buck, Yolo provided a whimper.

You only live once... so go eat somewhere else.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,3,2,2,SwxLYFFaci1MmmgDA-e3Kw

I would maybe eat here again becuase there aren't many nice mexican food places in Vegas. The food was good, but very americanized. I prefer traditional mexican food, and this was not it. I will say the margarona was great. It is a margarita with a corona... It is worth trying!!

Came here to get a ""snack"" which turned into a full on meal. The fajitas are pretty good. There's about 6 thin strips and they give you all the goods to put into your fajita: sour cream, guac, beans, rice, etc. 

The guacamole fresca is pretty damn good. They make it in front of you and it's just basically guac and chips. 

I don't know, I thought this place was pretty good but I was also starving so at that point, I think anything is really good. 

But I do recommend this place if you just want an afternoon snack or don't feel like splurging on the fancy restaurants",4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww,4,3,4,Awdb8CoMa84khmxP5RXFMA
3516947,2014-08-28,23,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"After finding out it would be a 2 hour wait at Gordon Ramday BurGR, we decided to hang out inside YOLOS (they had no wait) for drinks and appetizers. I was first impressed by the large, long booth we were sat at. That quickly changed when the people at our table kept kicking each other. There was no room under the table for us to sit comfortably. Our server was quick to take our drink order and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. 

We ordered a ""Quesadilla"" priced at $10 and ""Empanadas"" priced at $10 for our snackage. The quesadilla had jack cheese, onions and peppers inside. It also came with a side of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. The quesadilla was good, but average. If you want beef, chicken or shrimp in it then it will cost you $4-$5 more. The empanadas were well liked by hubby and I. They were stuffed with chorizo and had a green chile avocado salsa underneath them. The only complaint I have about that dish is the size of it. They put enough of the green chile avocado salsa on the plate so why not add just 1 more empanada to make it an even 4? If this were a cocktail party I could understand the small bites and portions, but this wasn't the case. With 4 people at our table it was awkward so hubby and I just ended up splitting one of them. The margarita did taste decent! 

They have lunch specials during the week that right now start at $9.95 and a Happy Hour at the bar as well. Also beware about the music inside this place. it's very loud and it's hard to have a conversation with the people sitting right at your table.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,29,25,3,xfbBXJU6DKJqHRFWk1lQKA

To drink I had the mule which wasn't very strong but still tasty (if you like ginger beer of course). Service was excellent as well.

3557154,2014-05-11,1,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"This place does not have a name brand chef, true that. The price is in line for the food served considering this is Vegas & the strip. The 2 of us ate for $54. Our bar tab for 2 delicious Margo-Ronas was $24 pushing the tab & tip up. Perhaps I'm not feeling the pinch because a similar drink in DC would cost more. 

For entrees, we had the Pork-Pibil (4.25 stars) & the Steak Picado (3 stars), service by Gustavo(4.5 stars), ambiance (4.5 stars), drinks(5 stars). Average = 4.25 for rating. That is a-okay in a city with so many big name chefs and prices. If you are not a buffet grazer, this is a very decent alternative.

So we went here and was surprisingly amazed at the quality of this food.  We started off with the Salsa Trio as a group and then I got the Street Tacos Dinner (Chicken Breast, Pork Carnitas and Mexican Gulf Shrimp).  Honestly so good.  This place is dirty cheap.  People who are getting upset regarding cost must be used to eating Fat Burger or In N' Out.  We had four guys who ordered meals and boozed and it was under $100 bucks.

3661420,2012-03-12,1,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"Dont eat here unless you like being treated like garbage.  I was recently at Yolo's in Planet Hollywood for lunch on 3/10 around 2-3 pm and had some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  The experience started off pleasant  with me and my two friends being seated promptly and we were very excited to try the food.  After the tableside guac was made the rest of our group called and decided to join us for lunch and our party of three grew to a party of 12.   I asked the waitress if we could move to a larger table to accommodate the rest of the group and she said she would have to ask the hostess so I went to speak to the hostess and she said she had to talk to the waitress.  All the while there were 3 empty tables right next to each other that could be easily pushed together.  The table to our left was a very nice couple that offered to move seats so we could add to our group but we told them that was a very nice offer but not necessary because there was room elsewhere. The table to the right of us was more interesting because it was the manager on duty who completely ignored us and made no efforts to help us obtain a larger table for our party.  After the three tables had been pushed together and everyone was seated, we started to move our appetizer and drinks over when we were stopped by the waitress, not the manager who was still sitting eating her lunch and staring at us, and were told that every member of our party of 12 was required to order a meal off the menu or we couldn't eat there anymore.  We let the waitress know that a few people may not be eating but everyone was going to be drinking but they still told us that we wouldn't be served unless everyone ate.  We were obviously upset by this since we are such a large group and the waitress would have gotten at least the min 18% tip that is added to large groups so we couldn't understand why they wouldn't serve us.  She told us that her manager had instructed her to tell us this, still while the manager is eating at a table less than 3 ft away from us.  The manager never once came us to us and talked to us directly or even tried to explain her position, the waitress said it was because they were too busy to seat people that weren't eating even though there were at least 5 empty table in the restaurant and plenty of room still at the bar.  We paid for our guac and my beer and left the restaurant to go somewhere more accommodating where every member of our group did in fact order food and several drinks.  The total bill ended up being over $500 for our group and we had a great time elsewhere.   I am so incredibly mad at the manager for being a coward and not even having the ""balls"" to tell us herself that she wouldn't serve us and very disappointed that at a great casino they allow staff to treat guest like garbage.",HXXp8nqFgwF8EMZv5rgPOw,0,0,1,YYXT2T3pk1RQ6A4iANms5Q

I was the un-official ""concierge"" of our Las Vegas weekend and knew that upon arrival we would be starving and ready to eat. I Yelped PH for on-site restaurant so that we could eat...stat. Yelp came through and gave us this tasty jewel! Upon check-in, I asked the gentleman at the desk if he could make a reservation for us, which he happily did! Bonus!

Atmosphere was inviting, hip, and un-pretentious. I was very impressed with the price-point vs. atmosphere...in Vegas, many restaurants depend on a so-called ""hip"" environment to allow them to boost their prices. Not Yolos! $12 for 3 tacos and rice & beans....and this is after you fill up on their complimentary chips and salsa!

LOVED the chips & fire-roasted tomato salsa. You know you're food is going to be great when the chips are fresh and warm, and the salsa is fresh and tasty. Our server, Todd, made sure that he kept them coming. He also prepared a beautiful table-side guacamole (worth the $8, both price and presentation were spot-on.)

My girls each ordered an alcoholic beverage (I don't drink) . The raspberry margarita was made with fresh berries and Todd even brought a to-go cup for the left-overs...which is why we love Vegas that much more!

Ok...the food, I know I'm taking forever, but you know you want these details! Three of us ordered tacos (carnitas, steak & shrimp) & three of us loved them! I ordered carnitas, cause I'm a pork junky, and I tried the shrimp which was outstanding! Friend the fourth ordered chicken fajitas which were your standard fajitas platter with all the fixins' However, the chicken was plentiful and tasted great!

My only disappointment was the rice and beans...not enough flavor here, AND the margarita fountain that wasn't! I was expecting some kind of rockin' show-piece and it was a lit-up tower with a nozzle...behind the bar. I totally had visions of ""weezin' the juice!"" Boo!

I would come back to Yolos on another trip, and I would sample a few of the appetizers next time! I'm looking forward to it!

I really am not sure what was added to those nachos, but it looked like a pile of crap. It didnt taste any better. So for entrees I think the majority of us either ordered the short ribs or the filet mignon. I guess since this was a Mexican place I should've ordered something else, so maybe this was my fault. But the waiter who took our order described the steak to be comparable to some NYC quaility steakhouse cuts. Steak looked nice and plated well but it was lacking some seasoning.

4102628,2017-11-14,1,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"Decent Mexican food at a good Las Vegas price, service on point and quick, and drinks that appeal to anyone.  And it can easily accommodate large groups.

On the drink menu the Pink Cadillac is listed before the Best Buddy Margarita.  This is also representative that the Pink Cadillac (aka Watermelon Margarita) is better than the other margarita flavors (strawberry, raspberry, or mango).  It is sweet (it is a flavored margarita after all), and comes with a slice of watermelon so it must be healthy.  Also watermelon liqueur, which I need to go get some now.  A lot of drinks were ordered by the table, and everyone was satisfied with their choice.

On to the food, and first the appetizers.  It's a Mexican place, so of course one needs to partake in chips and guac.  The guacamole is made fresh at your table, with tomato, onion, jalapeno, cilantro and lime juice.  The presentation is nice, the guac is fresh, and the flavor simple.  The portion of chips is appropriate for the amount of guacamole, but you can ask for more too.  Also under the appetizers are Tostadas, which can come in Chicken Tinga or Beef Machaca.  These are large open tacos with lots of fixings.  The Chicken Tinga came with more flavor than the Beef.  By the time that my entree, the Mexican Gulf Shrimp Street Tacos, arrived I was pretty full.  All tacos come with the options of black or pinto beans, and Mexican or Cilantro rice.  I opted for the cilantro rice, but did not detect any flavor from the cilantro, only the green coloring.  The Shrimp Tacos themselves were seared nicely, and the pineapple-garlic marinade was reminiscent of my time in more tropical locations than Las Vegas.",FJKw-FNduFwowZtrs36Egg,1,1,4,6eOaC60rNJjZcnLDjVoPAw

The street tacos (had both the chicken and beef) were well worth $5.  You get two tacos stuffed with surprisingly yummy meat.  Since you get 2 tortillas per street taco, I suggest breaking them up into 4 actually bite size tacos!  I was salivating over the sizeable plates of $5 tequitos and $5 quesadilla, but trying to maintain my figure I worked so hard on before Vegas, I abstained. 

Lots of $5 margaritas were flying out of the bar, but since I can't drink tequila, I stuck with the quite passable $5 white wine.

Good food and drinks, good prices, hip atmosphere, all at one of the newer Strip properties strikes me as a great deal.  

One complaint: the bartender - who gave me the Dos Equis when I asked for a dark beer? - was very pretty and just as rude.  Just a lot of unnecessary attitude.  She reminded me of a quote by the travel writer Bill Bryson:

We downed the chips and salsa like it was our job until we could have a rational conversation again, and then ordered some drinks.

RESTAURANT REVIEW
This place is located inside of the Planet Hollywood Casino.  Don't ask me where exactly because even if I tell you, you'll probably still get lost.  It (the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino) is huge and it's just retarded.

I was seated immediately.  I got my chips and salsa, ordered my drink and then the manager came out to greet me.  HUGE PLUS!!!  I love it when they do this.  I kindly asked him if he had hotter salsa, and he brought me out diablo sauce, which was actually too hot for me and the taste wasn't as good as the regular sauce.  Unfortunately, their sauce is like some sort of roasted thing that I don't care for.  I'd rather eat something that looks more red, not blackish.

I ordered some sort of enchilada but the server came back and said they were out.  I wasn't too happy, so I changed to the Carne Asada Ranchero.  I should've asked for medium-well.  Oh well, my fault.  The food was pretty good, it came with some sort of tamale, some weird looking rice that I'd never seen before and some black beans that I don't care for, either.  I didn't really care, I was just hungry and looking to experience the place.  I'm glad I did.  I actually found it off Vegas.com.

I can't remember what I drank, it was some minty-leafy drink with alcohol.  It was good.  I wanted to try something new rather than you run-of-the-mill margarita.",6LgWG72Sq9lnZGKSjJLx_Q,1,1,4,_UBx18xUgPj1g3tEbK-UIw

You can also get very tired, very quickly of the long lines at the hedonistic buffets.  Additionally every hotel has soo many restaurants you can easily get lost in the websites and hotel brochures.  Sometimes you just need to explore the mystical Vegas landscape and hunt yourself down some grub. So that's what we did.

Get it? You got it.) when we say the giant bright neon sign for YOLO'S Mexican Grill.  

It appears quaint, yet still very active.  Like a small 10 person house party that gets really out of control.  We checked out the menu, and decided to roll the dice.

It wasn't too busy inside, maybe 60% capacity, but it was enough that it didn't feel lonely inside.  We were sat near the edge, so we could ""people watch"" the hordes of people stroll by.

The décor is quite modern, except splattered with neon.  Think of the design style inside Aria, but then have street artists come with buckets of precise neon and accent the whole thing.  Strangely, it works; not like neon did in the 90's

We began the Yolo's experience with a Margarona; a margarita with a Coronita inserted upside down.  We saw everyone around us drinking it, and said, ""That looks fun, let's try it!""  I'm not a big margarita person, but it wasn't bad. Wasn't spectacular, but the spectacle of it cranked the ""fun-ness"" level which somehow made it tastier.

We ordered the Chips & Sales ($3) to start of the meal, both to curb the alcohol and the hunger gained by walking around The Strip for hours.  What came was a mountain of corn chips and a heaping bowl of salsa, almost too much for an appetizer.

Immediately after we indulged the Roasted Vegetable Fajitas ($13) and the Adobo Vegetable Enchiladas ($12).  We immediately realized how naïve we were in ordering an appetizer as the portion sizes of the two mains were enormous.

Like everywhere on the planet that served Mexican food, I had to ask for more tortillas twice (12) and because there was simply SOOO much food to stuff into my gullet.  The vegetables were spiced nicely, not overly salty (as a common Mexican trend) and thankfully there was enough sour cream, salsa, guacamole and cheese (most importantly) to garnish my riotous portion of tortillas.

We tried both the Mexican rice, and the cilantro rice; the cilantro being my favorite.  It was enough of a palette cleanser to separate the barrage of Mexican flavours.  The black pinto beans were superb, and both made sure we finished the portions.

By then end, we actually had to force ourselves to stop eating.  We were so full we felt like the blueberry girl from Charlie & The Chocolate factory.  We sat to regain the blood flow to our legs and enjoyed a Bohemia draft, and a Carta Blanca - both imported Mexican brews.

Best of all was the bill, it was easily the least expensive meal we had had in Vegas thus far; yet one of the most satisfying.  Partially due to our significant over indulgence.

We did end up visiting the negative ATM's immediately after, as the gargantuan ""fullness"" needed a solid 90 minutes before we felt like normal human beings again.",yqQ_BQPLp0vQKZ0Ys9a4cQ,0,0,4,UTMvwtBDsu1DzY6LxH2dhQ

5111711,2010-01-25,0,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"Having grown up in LA and being a HUGE fan of mexican food I'm always skeptical about eating ""posh"" mexican food.

Before we get started with the review, DO NOT go to this place if you are expecting ""typical gringo mexican food"".  What I mean by that is if you want oil soaked enchiladas with a heaping spoonful of refried beans with 3 lbs. of cheese covering a scorching hot plate and chile rellenos, crunchy tacos, and the 3 item combo from a place like Chevy's, El Torito, or Macayos, then move along.  Otherwise, keep reading.

I ordered the carnitas street tacos.  The carnitas were tender inside and slightly crunchy on the outside which is a result of the braising process but also the pork slightly frying in its own fat.  They weren't greasy though, and came dressed with salsa, onions, and cilantro (hence, street tacos, like the ones you get in street taco shops).  But the flavors were outstanding.  No shredded cheese or heaps of lettuce either, which added to the authenticity of this food.  These were served with black beans and rice on the side which was nothing special, but really I didn't need anything overly overstated.

Yes, paying around $12 for 3 tacos is exorbitant, especially when you pay $0.50 to $1.00 per taco in Mexico.  But come on people, it's Vegas.  If you want cheap there is a La Salsa around the corner.  And when you take a street taco and refine it to up the gourmet quality, it really was worth it.

They serve the obligatory chips and salsa, and I would best describe the salsa as being a more coarse molcajete style salsa. 

My friend ordered the steak nachos, which were unconventional but delicious.  They were individual flour tortilla chips with a slice of grilled steak, cheese, and beans with a jalapeno slice on each chip.  Those were delicious as well.   

All in all, I would highly recommend the food, but have an open mind, especially if you are expecting the same ol' american style mexican food.  Certainly hole-in-the-wall taquerias have their merits and strengths (some al pastor anyone?!) but this place provides a more upscale spin for a tasty lunch.",6k2VpCFOJrXoqcEevwGgxA,3,1,4,ftnuey-KGRlHGihW92Fj-Q

Her steak had a lot of fat throughout so she said something to our server.

We went on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. 

They start you off with some delicious salsa and chips. The salsa was tasted great with some smokey undertones. The chips though were a little flavorless, but that was remedied by a dash of salt. 

For drinks we ordered the house and cadillac margaritas on the rocks. I am purest and would drink tequila and lime juice if they offered it. I am not sure how ""pure"" the house margarita was, but it past the taste test. I don't like cadillac margaritas as there are too many liquors in it so I won't review it. 

I read some Yelp reviews about the street tacos so we had to order them. One order of chicken and one order of fish.  They brought out 3 soft tacos with sides of pico de gallo, guacamole, rice and beans. This what Mexican Food is all food: simple and inexpensive. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted great. The fish tacos were made with Mahi-Mahi, but I would have preferred a more authentic fish taco made with Tilapia.

I found the chips and salsa to be very good for snacking - they offer a very good house made salsa with warm chips that really offer a sweet and salty mix.

We also ordered two blended drinks, of which the name eludes me because we were faded as hell - but one tasted like starburst, and the other tasted like a lighter less sweet pina colada (which is damn good).

Ordered the chicken nachos, which I found to be a little weird because the chips were soggy, not crispy (which probably meant microwave cheese melting action as opposed to tossing it in a oven). The chicken was shredded and plentiful, and the cheese covered the spice covered chips very well. I only wish we had some extra sour cream, some house salsa, guac, and some sweet chilis.

from the lunch special menu, i ordered the carne asada street tacos with mexican rice and a margarita,  which i had  frozen. all were really satisfying. having sides of guacamole, salsa and lemon really helped add a zest of flavor to the tacos. the margarita was extremely refreshing. kinda frothy, but super tasty. sometimes i crave their margaritas, and then start craving margaritas in general. ahh! im craving it now! 

the decor of the restaurant is up to date and chic. really neon bright crazy hues. a very fashionably hip mexican restaurant thats for sure.

Being from Texas, my mark for Mexican food is high. We ate at Cabo Wabo too, it was a little better and a little cheaper. The food here was very plain. The chicken was just a simple white meat in rectangular strips and the tortillas were standard, not homemade. There are also no free chips and salsa (which blows my mind at a Mexican food place).

The big knock is that the queso is barely a step above the jarred stuff in the stores. There is an oil based, cream quality to it. It's just plainly subpar.

Blue corn coconut shrimp appetizer was super. Only four but that's to be expected. The Drunken chicken nachos were HOT. I like hot but this was lips on fire hot and there's nothing telling you that when you order so my sis couldn't eat them. The chicken was kind of soupy so it made the chips mushy which I don't like. Also, the chips were bottom of the bag, small pieces. I've never had that even in the cheapest dives.

5659211,2011-07-26,1,1Vvxx-9AoINg8TJXOZgEHg,"I'm weary of eating on the Strip because of two things - the prices, especially because everything has an 18% ""entertainment tax"" tacked on, either in the price of the food, or at the end of the meal, and because service is either non-existent or good. There is no in between. 

When my sister was complaining about being hungry when we had time to kill before we saw a 9 o'clock show last night (7/25/11,) I was dreading how much I was going to have to throw down to pay for the meal. Walking around Planet Hollywood, I noticed there isn't much in the way of food.  My sister wanted pizza, but we couldn't find any. Next choice (always the best) was Mexican food. 

We walked right up to the bar and sat down. Got ID'd, were handed menus and given waters. WOW, $5 for chips and salsas. I look over at the people sitting on either side of us. They have chips and salsa and there's no way I'm paying that much for what I see. My sister and I settle on splitting the $10 ""drunken"" chicken nachos. My sister remarks that the margaritas come out of a slushi machine. ""Ew, that means fake lime flavor. Pass"" she says, with a scrunched up nose. I look at the drink menu. The mojitos sound good. $10? Eh, never mind. I'm not that interested in paying that for a drink. I'm a local, after all. 

I look at the register in front of me. ""$138?!"" Our neighbor's tab for two is astronomical! Our other neighbor gets rung up. ""$124!!"" Good thing we only ordered an appetizer or else I might be in the poor house. These dinner portions are TEENSY! 

My sister worries aloud that we might not have time to finish our meal when it comes out. A few minutes later a small mound of nachos comes out in a molcajete. My sister says ""never mind"" about not finishing the nachos. The portion is so tiny, one person could easily finish them. Good thing I'm not very hungry so it was enough for two. My sister laughs when she says we finished them in less than 10 minutes. 

The taste was decent. Not the best ever nachos I've had, especially because some chips were full on black at the bottom of the pile - they probably got forgotten about under the broiler. The bottom was soggy as there was a big puddle of whatever the watery ""drunken"" sauce was.

The service was attentive, which is a big thing in Vegas. The interior is also fun and pretty. Even though my sister is nowhere near full and I feel what we bought was worth maybe $5, I don't feel terribly ripped off. Would I make a special trip to eat here? No, but it was good for what it was - a ""low priced"" snack on the Strip.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,2,3,-vXGlD2CqEe7zhmjOqPirg

You have to pay for chips and salsa and we had 3 die-hard salsa fans, so we ordered two orders - which got pricey, especially because there is not a lot of salsa in each order (although what you do get was very, very good). 

I had the vegetarian enchiladas and added guacamole (for an extra charge). The sauce could have used a little more punch in the flavor, but all and all it was really good. I enjoyed the cilantro rice as well.

The other two dinners ordered the chicken burrito and taco lunch specials and said they both loved their meal. 

Cool drink menu presentation at the table (like an iPad type menu) and the service was good and attentive. I liked how dark it felt in there - good ambience to forget you are in bright, hot Vegas.

When we got there the restaurant was empty and it was 12:30 which is prime time for restaurants. While that should have been a red flag we decided to give it a try anyway. When we were seated the hostess warned us that the waiter would take a while to get to us which I didn't understand because they weren't busy at all.

When we finally ordered, our drinks didn't come out for another 10 minutes. The salsa was alright but not very spicy. I ordered the tamales and my boyfriend ordered the burrito-both on the lunch menu for $9 each. My tamales had barely any chicken and tasted bland, the rice had absolutely no flavor, and the black beans tasted like they were from a can. Not to mention the temperature of the food was scorching hot so I could barely eat it at first. My boyfriend stopped eating midway through his meal because he lost his appetite and he is quite the foodie. His burrito steak tasted like pot roast and there was no spice whatsoever. Burritos are not supposed to taste like pot roast people! GROSS! Our server was very polite but he was busy waiting on the entire restaurant by himself so service was extremely slow. 

The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the drink menu is illuminated which is pretty cool, and it has a hip vibe but looks can be deceiving! I was born and raised in Texas so I know how good Mexican food tastes like and this food is very far from it.

Also,  you can expect excellent Margaritas!",uK_GOFy1KZ8bYoJD9K_XhA,1,1,5,ihzFZOdNMQ0GqJ69EqUvJg

Vegas...after a full day of drinking in the hot sun by the pool you wake up in the hotel room after a 2 hour power nap and you're ready to get ready for a big night out but then you realize you haven't had much to eat! We rolled into Yolos without a reservation around 11pm on a Saturday night and found 4 seat at the bar. The awesome bartender Chris was nice enough to first hook up our dehydrated asses with some waters and he kept our glasses refilled throughout our meal! I give him credit for not getting a cramp in his wrist! He made some great recommendations and answered our questions. The DJ begun playing some music just as we were getting settled and he was damn good! I was dancing in my seat from the minute I sat down until we paid our bill, I actually danced outta there. I think we should have just stayed at Yolos with the awesome DJ and Chris all night because the rest of Vegas was a bust that night. Anyway, I had the beef enchiladas with the cilantro rice and it was delicious! Yolos has fairly good Mexican food for Vegas and it's very reasonably priced! We'll be back Yolos!!!! See you soon Chris!!!",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,1,2,4,i_zdBBUlowGVQQ1tsLO7yw
