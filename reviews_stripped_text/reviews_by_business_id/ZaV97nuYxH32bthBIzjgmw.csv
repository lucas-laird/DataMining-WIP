The smells coming from the restaurant delighted the senses and we quickly went in to see what was in store.  The Mongoliam BBQ was quite delicious, as good as any I've had with super high quality (kosher remember) ingredients.  We also tried some of the middle eastern fair, also delicious, I loved the kibbah and their spicy dips rock.  During our stay in Vegas, we at here 3 times, each time was great and everything from the typical Jewish food to the Mongolian BBQ to the Persian delicacies were all spot on.  Definitely give this place a try and their delivery service was amazing as well.  They gave us chaffing dishes, a crock pot to use pre-Shabbas so our lunch was warm, just amazing food and amazing people.  We loved Wok On In, definitely the best Kosher food in Las Vegas and ranks up there for delicious food with the non-Kosher places as well.",Frsvmv_BnvQS0sHcMPoOEA,0,0,5,N_G5kLeNygRlBfXP3ZWufg

I really enjoy eating here.  I have been going for lunch an average of once a month for awhile.  They have many many options, and it's healthy too (if you want it to be).  Since you pick out your own veggies and flavored sauces, it's probably your own fault if it tastes bad.

A few things are missing for a 5-star review:

1. The cashier is sometimes too busy ringing people up to deliver beverages and side dishes in a timely manner.  I think separate people to handle those duties during busy lunch/dinner hours.

2. Pick a direction and stick with it.  The tostones were good, yes, but what do they have to do with Asian food?  And why the chicken wings and fries?  This place does the wok concept well, but some menu items are irrelevant to that concept.  Don't try to be everything to everybody.

3. Bring back the original, soft, sesame-covered bread from when this place first opened.  That stuff was amazing and went well with the Asian flavors.  The current bread is closer to fry bread.  Good, but it used to be great.

Yes, I have my suggestions, but it is overall still very good and worth a try if you've never been.",R4LQOf68_POgEdOZfyZ7tg,2,1,4,bSEEMzoR--vKsw6_EKh92g

Customer service is A++

I walked into this restaurant a little confused at first but understood the concept right away.
 I am vegetarian so the veggie bowl is 7$. I filled up my bowl with countless vegetables, tofu, they even have a ""meat substitute"" if you ask and it is AWESOME! I loaded up with my veggies, sauces, rice & noodles and it was fired up on the mongolian grill!

The food was DELICIOUS, the service was very friendly,and  the new owners approached me to make sure I was having a pleasant experience, which was very nice. 

As an appetizer I had the cream cheese wonton's which were pretty good!

Its right across from UNLV so, I go almost twice a week after class for yummy, quick, and affordable meal!",3FsR_Tw-M6QNyNXr2yQcaA,0,1,5,I1fYyO3QXWG03n75fD67uA

Starting from Mongolian all the way to kosher middle eastern food, at the beggining I did not think much of it but lately new chefs arrived and new management, turning this place into a GREAT place to get lunch or dinner.
Prices are very affordable especially if you take under consideration that this is all KOSHER food, which usually gives a significant mark up on anything.

The owner of the place YAFFA is very down to earth and nice! She sat down with us and chatted for half an hour, gave us complimentary dissert and GREAT service...

Try it out, you won't regret it!!",BB_7Eosz-8AvgETVbAg6og,0,0,5,4EOf10gLOZhEDVdtXJUH9A

I wish they would put the sauce on for you since it's hard to tell how much to use or how many flavors to combine. But still delicous and healthy. Sesame bread is yummy! Overall, a great deal for the price. I will probably be coming here for lunch at least once a month.",NPT02yKt2J2pZZF4BSLnGg,0,0,4,PyuCsnP7MvgOLY4PwUUmqQ
1310923,2011-04-07,0,ZaV97nuYxH32bthBIzjgmw,"In the past three years, this restaurant has gone through at least four owners. It appears the latest are, based on my experience today, the worst unfortunately.

We walked in, and there was absolutely no attempt to help us. The staff stared at us blankly, without even saying hello. We asked if they had Mongolian grill, and they nodded. We told them we wanted that, and they just kind of kept staring at us while holding up a bowl. My wife asked, ""So do we tell you what we want in it?"" and finally the guy responded verbally, telling us yes.

Every other Mongolian grill I've been to, including all previous owners at this location, you get your bowl, you go down the line and put your ingredients in, and then you give it to them to cook it up. At this place, however, you tell them what ingredients you want and they put them in the bowl for you. This is incredibly annoying when the person making your bowl is barely communicative.

Not being able to put the ingredients in yourself, you end up having to tell the guy whether to put a lot or a little of something in, and even when we'd do that, he'd just put the same amount. When asked to add a SMALL amount of chili sauce, he put on a full ladle of it. When asked to put on a LOT of onions, he put on the same amount of onions as he did all the other veggies.

We were also given no direction whatsoever as to when you pay. We stood there like idiots at the cash register, as previously you would pay before you made your food or sat down. After standing there for a few seconds with no one coming over to help us, we just seated ourselves.

It was actually difficult finding a table.  Many of the tables had dishes still sitting on them from previous people who had eaten, despite the fact that we were the only ones in there currently and there were staff just standing there doing nothing. Also, even the tables that had been cleared had lots of crumbs and debris on them. We had to seriously search before finding a table that actually was clean.

We sat down at the table with our food, were asked if we wanted something to drink. We asked for Diet Cokes. Despite there being a soda machine there, it was brought to us in cans. Apparently the soda machine is not functional.

The entire time we were there, no staff member ever came over to ask how we were doing. We had to call across the restaurant to get the guy's attention when we wanted water. When we wanted to go, we called to the guy again, asking for our check. He actually just stared at us blankly. We repeated, ""Can we have the check please?"" and he looked at us uncertainly. ""The check...?""  ""Yes, the check!"" and he finally seemed to understand and brought it over to us.

There did not seem to be a language barrier issue or anything, as on the few times the guy spoke his English was perfectly fine. He just seemed completely uninterested in serving us.

We were charged the price for the lunch special, and it was only on the way out of the restaurant that we noticed a sign saying that the lunch special came with soup and an egg roll. We had never been offered either.

The place was just awful. The food was a little lackluster, but the main complaint was the staff. They were utterly non-communicative. It's not like I even want waiters to be super outgoing and friendly or anything, I just want to be answered when I have a question instead of stared at wordlessly. The service was just absolutely terrible.",1oSb1_MP9RR77F6Fijfftg,3,0,1,hOTKn3qrTsZd5p7oHQ_L8g

1483065,2010-05-07,3,ZaV97nuYxH32bthBIzjgmw,"Wow, this place is awesome. I didn't know what to expect when I parked my bike up to the entrance but as soon as I got in there I knew it was the place to be. It's buffet meets fast food meets restaurant service, and that combination with the customer service is terrific. Totally affordable, quick, and easy.

Went inside and it has really good use of space, and has a modern feel to it and plenty of areas to sit. I obviously looked slightly lost as I went up to the counter area, but the cook greeted me and asked me if it was my first time there, which it was. He showed me around and told me I could make pretty much anything I wanted. I paid first ($6.99 for a vegetarian bowl), got handed a bowl, and went to town. You go down the buffet and you have a ton of veggies and toppings to choose from. From what I could tell, my meal was completely vegan (until I put honey on the AMAZING sesame flatbread, YUM!) and all the ingredients were super fresh. I picked out some tofu, bean sprouts, zucchini, onion, snow peas, green pepper, and mushrooms. I added some garlic sauce on top, and handed it off to the cook who added some noodles and other sauces (he asked me first if I wanted it spicy, and I declined) and then added it to the big wok behind the counter. Eventually this small bowl I was handed turned into this giant plate that was also served with a side of white rice. He handed the plate to me, and told me to sit anywhere I like. 

After grabbing some chopsticks (don't do it, just eat with a fork - trust me) and some napkins, almost immediately after sitting down I was served the aforementioned sesame flatbread with honey, and a glass of ice water. Freakin' nice. And the food? DELICIOUS. The past few weeks I haven't had much of an appetite, but I ate the whole damn plate. And the bread. And downed the water. It was very tasty and left me really satisfied with the different flavorings of everything. 

This place gets 5 stars for service, convenience, price, cleanliness, and it's only a 5 minute bike ride from my apartment. Epic win! I will definitely be coming back with some friends and some cash to tip the next time because the service really is excellent. Just be really careful, you may be so full that you can't Wok-On-Out!

P.S. As I sat down they played Lady Gaga. As I left they played Katy Perry. This makes Adina a very happy panda and will keep me coming back. Good food + good music = yay!",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,4,3,5,771E4zaKpCRyMleFkTtNnQ

The soup is rather ordinary, but the ""sesame flatbread"" is nice.

There was a friendly elderly lady working the counter and Mongolian station. Service was OK as there wasn't much business.  The dining area was large enough for a big party.  It was a little dirty.

I had some Mongolian which you could basically add any or all ingredients with beef or chicken. It was different, at least not my fave.  

They make a variety of Mongolian, Mexican, Mediterranean, and Israeli food.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,0,0,3,90jIA-DwCEWqEC6Eolkr3Q
2379532,2011-03-12,0,ZaV97nuYxH32bthBIzjgmw,"I went here the other day with my co-workers. Much to our surprise, it's no longer a Mongolian restaurant. It's a Chinese restaurant and we were told it would soon serve Italian and Mexican food as well.

I asked for the lemon chicken and was told that was the only thing on the menu they didn't have. So I went with the sesame chicken. It was pretty good. It was lightly breaded and slightly sweet. However, I did taste sesame. Nor did it have sesame seeds though my co-worker's general chicken had sesame seeds.

The lunch special is $10.99 which is a little pricey. On the upside the owner offered us all a complimentary dessert. They had a pretty nice selection of desserts. I opted for the lemon bar which was moist, tart and had the right amount of sweetness.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,2,1,3,435zD3Nowmf8PQ67iCV7Ag

The food was decent, the only thing that docked it was the guy hassling me for tips when he was just the cashier, not even the cook. I gave him a dollar but I was kinda weirded out by the approach.

No service, they plate your selections and the meats were both floating in this bloody ice water as the ""hostess"" grabbed out a small finger bowl and set it aside. My wife nearly got sick just looking at it as we stood there for 5 minutes alone waiting for a cook. So we just walked out. 
Again, no one to greet you, no explaination of the new process, very gruff when talking to anyone. they grab the ingredients you ask for and try to short you on meat for a set $11 price for one serving. 
Plus they advertise hot dogs and hamburgers, buffet mexican food? At Kosher-mongo BBQ? WTF? Absolutly horrible experience to see such a good place turn to this. I will warn everyone I see to stay away.

The veggies were fresh and there was a good selection - bok choy, spinach, tofu, green onions, white onions, carrots, pineapple, bean sprouts, peanuts, baby corn, mushrooms, orange noodles, cabbage, etc....

Interesting mix of sauces to create your own - soy sauce was behind the counter in the hands of the grill master so he added it.  For those who order meat, you can choose chicken, beef or pork or all three.  I got beef.  There was enough food for 3 meals so this was a really good deal.  No complaints!  I would go back.
