Staff's really friendly and helpful. I ordered 2 Carne asada street tacos & green chicken enchiladas. Tacos were super delicious! Enchiladas were stuffed with actual chicken chuncks!! I prefer mine with a little more sauce, but they were still good. Oh and the beans! Yuuuum... they were actually whole beans.. not the can refried beans. Rice was pretty good too. Definitely check them out!",CPb2q-BhdqlFdqRU92mY6Q,0,0,5,JTIb-fho7vUdbx371hSA-w

My friend got the chile verde special for that day $6.99. I got the two small quesadilla special. Both dishes came with rice and beans. The 'small' quesadillas were not small at all, and very fat from being stuffed with so much chicken. The chile verde was very good as well.The way it works is you order at the counter then sit down. You can tell it is a family run business. At least it seems to be. I would definitely go back there. They are on the corner of Arville and Hacienda, just opened on the back side of the two story building. Seating for maybe 12 inside, but real good food.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,3,0,5,tLNZBGC7n1SVOhJsV9AhGw

2705445,2016-08-26,0,FLHTWU3KVMz7qSH4yYsKPA,First time here - great hole in the wall restaurant! Food quality is better than the Roberto's type fast food shops. We went right at lunch and there was a fair amount of customer's which makes me happy when a place is small and/or tucked away. The wait for our food was not so bad (made it here and back well within my lunch hour). They were accommodating of our low carb diet and the amended carne asada plate we ordered was delicious. I'll be back!,vrC2KB7eZurnlGh8vSb2lg,1,0,4,TenfGIzKzGb7MtbM9s6IBw

4878636,2014-06-26,1,FLHTWU3KVMz7qSH4yYsKPA,"This tiny lunch counter is tucked in a business park, and recently changed from a Satay place to a Mexican Kitchen.  I work around the corner, so I had hoped to find a hidden gem like Taco y Taco on Eastern.  This place might be cheap, but it's much too basic.  I dig the family business model with Mama in the kitchen and the daughters on register, but the menu is only a few items, and the food comes out very plain.  I'm not a good cook, and this is no better than what we get at home.

The carne asada was cooked without seasoning, and had hard bits of fat in the mix.  The lengua was tender, but again seasonless.  Three tacos and a drink for $6 is great, but the onions and cilantro come on the side, the tortillas are steamed, not grilled, and no salsa in the go bag.  I guess I needed to explicitly ask for it.  My friend got a chicken burrito, and was disappointed in the small amount of meat inside.  He was also bummed how spicy it was, since there was no indication on the menu it would include a lot of hot-hot salsa.

It feels like this family is ""playing restaurant"" with their kids, and while having lunch you can walk to is nice ... the food is not.  Skip it, and wait for the next family to try something in this space.",Hj2bC9FUrj2NbCn2noproQ,4,0,2,rNihqOBacbf_A5QKG5KnDQ

5522441,2014-09-05,0,FLHTWU3KVMz7qSH4yYsKPA,"Not a bad little taco place, the service was super-friendly and I got three tacos and a drink for $5.95, so the price was decent. It's located in a spot where there's literally no other restaurants or even convenience stores for blocks, so that's also a mark in their favor. I walk or ride the bus to work, so anything on the way to or from is a boon.
A previous reviewer pointed out that the tortillas for the tacos are steamed, and that the meat isn't overtly spiced, but I found its flavor pleasing and the green salsa that came on the side was grand. Cilantro and onions also come on the side so you can add as much or as little as you want.
The place is obviously family-owned and operated, and I must admit that as a taco place, it's not fantastic--three Yelp stars at best--but I had such a pleasant experience because of the service and location that I raised it an additional star.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,4,0,4,BIErVRa5RKimfIKRVZgd8Q
