We ordered supreme fries which was really supreme. Hot fries with glucamole, mushrooms and pico. 
And we ordered burger combo with coke. The burger was really good, crunchy with some onions and fresh lettuce. The patty was tasty. 

The prices are reasonable for vegan food.

1000608,2017-10-31,0,nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"I tried this place and was very hopeful after reading mixed reviews. So- their food is decent but not like super good. Their soups are delicious- prob my favorite part of my order. The carnitas street tacos were pretty good, wish they had a bit more seasoning on the ""meat"", their red salsa was bomb so I just slathered it with that and lime juice, you could almost not tell it wasn't actually meat. I also ordered the potato rolled tacos and was not impressed- it's like two French fries in a corn tortilla and then I specifically asked them to put the cheese on the side (because sometimes I don't like vegan cheeses and I did not like theirs), but they put the cheese all over my tacos anyway and when I called to complain (via Grubhub) because I couldn't eat the tacos with the nasty cheese all over them I was told that my order was right and that they put the cheese on the side and I will not be refunded. They did agree to refund me for the horchata that I order and didn't receive. 

My overall take is I wish this place had better customer service. If they screw up your order and you can't eat it because of it, you will not be refunded- they will blame the customer and you'll be out of money. Really bad bad service, wish it wasn't so... I won't be returning for that specific reason. It's the principle...they said I was lying about my food being wrong instead of taking responsibility for their mistake. 

Okay so today it's over a month since I wrote the review for Panchos and I was literally like attacked on Facebook by them for writing a real review and in their response they just straight up completely lied, then made it so I couldn't even respond to them because I guess they needed ""the last word"". Big tip- don't accuse your customers of lying when they are not. I'm not the only person commenting on your awful customer service. Just fix it!!! I've attached a pic of the Facebook post where they were upset about my review and then disabled me from responding. To be clear- they never offered a refund like I've detailed before. And Grubhub was not the issue, they were. I will still use Grubhub to order food but will never go to this place, that says something!  Also, I found a vegan place here in Vegas I love called vegetation and they don't blame their customers or try to shift the blame to Grubhub when they mess up, I promise!  

Maybe the next time they get a bad review they will actually reach out to the customer to correct it instead of just lying on the internet and saying they did. The management here are just straight up liars. Bad service, don't go!!!!",o1AiAfE16y8bHKdwpaqrAg,0,0,1,DxGaiZXZCriAYyq-CITsTw

I would personally rate the food a two star but the service and concept deserves a five star!

This is not gourmet vegan mex. I would compare it to the omnis version of a ""Robertos"" type place. Junk food.

100% vegan. Grub Hub and Uber Eats.

We tried a variety of items most of which have Daiya :( cheese. But I can overlook that because we completely forgot to request minus. *punches self in face*

Chorizo Quesadilla- not sure what we were thinking ordering this, the chorizo was yum but we couldn't get past the Daiya goo factor. It was warm yet had that outer crispiness, prepared perfectly.

Wet Burrito-best item we ordered, huge a filled with yumminess we opted for Ascada and glad we did.

Potato rolled tacos- fried and crisp these were super yum but of course they are fried. The white looking lettuce and mayo globs were a shock and total taste turnoff but the fresh sliced avocado on top made up for the goo globs.

Nachos Al Pastor-covered and piled high these had amazing flavor. The meat choice I picked was a great decision. Once again I should have opted minus the Daiya shreds goo and the glowing bright white lettuce.

The hibiscus water is soooo yummy. Its NOT sweet and the tart taste goes perfect with the food. Wish I opted to try the Horchata but neither hubs nor I like cinnamon nor care for sweet stuff.

All and all the food is fast food, I'm willing to try other items like the tacos....but we do not like corn tortillas and wish they would opt for greener lettuce and less processed products. 

Better than Taco Bell, def not health food, yet cruelty free compassion based grub. Support local business.

First of all let's address the elephant in the room. What is going on with the AC?! There is none! They told me ""yeah unfortunately the owner of the building won't fix it"". Then it sounds like it's time to find a new owner of a new building. I've literally ordered no onions every single time I've been here and every single time except for the last time they gave me onions. That doesn't mean they didn't mess up though. Wouldn't be Panchos without a screw up. I waited for damn near a half hour for some tacos to go! 

It just really bums me out. I've been to this restaurant four times now and this is my final time. The restaurant area looks very bad. The no AC just makes it even worse. They could at least paint the wall one color. It's a combination of multiple oranges where they painted over other things with the wrong color. The bathroom is the cleanest thing I've seen in this establishment and it's extremely clean.  I wish the rest of the restaurant reflected what the bathroom does which is typically the opposite of anywhere you go.

Such a great concept but what a crappy location and store in general.  The food is pretty good here but it's everything else that brings down the place.

1448097,2017-02-08,15,nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"FOOD: All Vegan, all Mexican, all the time! They make their sauces (including a sour cream and fresh salsas) in house. The potato taquitos dorados are a good option for Vegan newbies, or their tacos. The ""asada"" is pretty good, will be trying the ""al pastor"" next. I was hoping to get a great grilled veggie burrito or even some veggie fajitas, but they don't seem to do that, which I found strange. I was thrilled to see quesadillas and nachos on the menu, but my ""asada"" quesadilla barely had anything in it. Vegan cheese can be a difficult transition though. Avocado was fresh but I'm perplexed as to why they only seem to have chopped iceberg lettuce and underripe tomatoes when their target audience is people who eat produce for half of their diet. Menu is extensive though, with other options including tamales, tortas, fideo soup, and sopes.

SERVICE: Not impressed with the female cashier. It's not obvious that you walk up to the bar to order since the register is smack-dab in the middle of the bar with chairs around it and tables blocking any reasonable area where patrons would line up. There's no signage and the menus are all over the tables, but there is no table service. Finally figured it out on my own since no one addressed me after I entered and stood around for a few minutes. Placed my order and the cashier had to double check with the kitchen for availability of every item, then asks multiple times if it's for here or to-go, making it an unnecessarily long process. No smiles, no friendliness, nothing that indicates she understands she's in a service position or representing a new business. Male staff was the exact opposite: friendly, engaging, knowledgeable, and helpful, even brought me out extra salsa.

LOCATION: Parking lot is small, which may be a problem as they get more popular. Interior is a ghastly orange color, no decor to speak of, and the microwave is right in plain sight of the customers. Random bottles of generic salsa are out on counter.  Would suggest moving the microwave and adding a salsa bar to improve the interior.  This is a neighborhood with several solid Mexican restaurants, I'd only pick this place if you're specifically wanting dishes with vegan cheese/meat options as there are better veggie burritos nearby.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,31,23,3,hF0R7n04y8YKDZ8bXP7oQg

1558658,2018-02-02,0,nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"Found an all vegan taco shop, yes! I drove to Vegas to meet friends and stopped by here at the end of my drive before going to strip which has more limited vegan options. I ordered the Friday special, a burrito. It was a lot of beans and rice in a large tortilla. This definitely isn't healthy vegan food, it's comfort food and very hearty and filling. Also very simple, for my protein I got mushrooms and there was some lettuce and tomato but that was it. It ended up being two meals for me and I loved the tortilla. It's a very casual place, you order at the counter and there's cafeteria like seating. The mexican place next door has vegan options as well if you don't find something you want on the menu. It's located in a more run down area just off the strip at a major intersection so there's lots of traffic and congestion by the restaurant but for me it felt like it was worth the trip. It's also by the university so saw a lot of students dropping in. The other thing I love was how affordable the food was. You sometimes see someone add a vegan label and hike up the price even if you're getting something super simple but Panchos Vegan was very reasonably priced. I liked my food a lot, wish I had room for dessert. They had a huge menu and lots of different appetizers, entrees, protein options, desserts, and tacos. Would highly recommend for any vegans visiting Vegas. it is a little inconvenient if you don't have a car because you have to leave the strip but if you have time, I think it's worth the detour.",svyVKwAJkkbhJjGhnLoBWw,0,0,4,13MTkv9l9ksgcZ44oHLbYg

Posole- coming from a authentic Mexican culture it was very bland. Here is why I didn't give them a 5 star. I was very disappointed.

The seitan for the asada is flavorful, however, the texture is too spongy for my taste.  The al pastor seitan had the same type of spongy texture as the asada, but this one lacked  flavor. I wouldn't order it again. 
 What I  was really pleased with  was the sope. The dough was not greasy, not undercooked, not too thick.  Also, the beans were on point, soft and had its own flavor. The sour cream didn't  really taste like anything and the shredded cheese looked more like mozzarella cheese  instead of queso fresco or cotija which is what it's  traditionally served with.
The horchata water was by far the only item you couldn't  that was vegan. It had that sweet and cinnamony taste that regular horchata has.

A man answered the phone and when I asked him if I could place an order for a carry out, he paused and said "" you wanna place an order right before we close?"" Mind you, they still had another 20 minutes to go. How rude. I told him I knew that and would be there within 10 minutes. He then proceeded to take my order.

Also, the establishment seemed cleaned but it was extremely hot in there and when I arrived the cashier lady was all by herself at the front. She was taking orders, taking them out, cleaning tables. She was really hustling. And she (cashier/bus lady/server) told me  that the A/C wasn't working  properly so maybe I just went on the wrong day. No big deal.

Anyhow I told him it was my first time and he made some suggestions to which I chose the Cuban torta. He brought it out not long after, and it looked like a typical sandwich, one bite into it though and this was heaven! The bread was perfectly crisp yet soft inside, the produce was fresh and cold, the faux meats were tender -not rubbery -and flavorful enough. The avocado was perfectly ripe! And just the right right amount of onions to give it a little kick.

2207334,2017-06-04,3,nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"As a Laco-Ovo Vegetarian, Vegan restaurants are a place where I can find a range of (hopefully well) thought-out entrees and sides instead of picking from one or two token dishes without meat or subbing something for something, hold the other thing. Most often, Vegan restaurant management is tuned into common food issues such as Gluten and Soy allergies and avoiding the GMO tell-tale High Fructose Corn Syrup by using Cane Sugar. 

This is not the case with Panchos. They have no Gluten Free options nor do they have any Meat Substitutes that are not Soy-based. If you are seeking Gluten-free or Soy-free, you will not find it at Panchos as of late May 2017.

While this may be no huge deal, there is a deal breaker for me. Panchos Vegan Tacos, a ""MEXICAN RESTAURANT FOR VEGANS,"" DOES NOT OFFER GUACAMOLE. SRLSY. Yes, you read that correctly, a Vegan Taco Shop that does not offer Guacamole. Isn't this like reverse cultural appropriation or something, the withholding of the best part of their culture?

Now, if you had Panchos Carnivorous Currascaria maybe you could get away with it, because maybe Brazilians don't appreciate guac for the elixir of life that it is. But a taco shop without guac is like an airplane without  wings, a politician without lies, or a Filipino doctor on United Airlines, it just doesn't fly.

I see a new ad with a tostada that appears to have green goodness on it. Or at least it appears green, so maybe they took the feedback to heart and adjusted with the market, and if that becomes the case before I find out and update this review, then good on 'em for evolving their business. I intend to stop by in a few months when I'm out and about and hungry and have cash to eat out and see. 'Cause if there's guac I'll stay and eat the Soy and Gluten, nom nom, for I'm just a Laco-Ovo Vegetarian looking for a yummy Taco that has Guac!",_fFpucW8mSKvFJ46zSJCrg,4,2,3,K3yUrmGmBFkgepjBrJd6xA

My subsequent visits resulted in orders of Pastor nachos with nacho cheese instead of shredded, and asada street tacos. Everything I've ordered has been delicious and I definitely don't feel like I'm missing out on not having meat. 
Since the recent expansion and addition of a second register, ordering to go has been so easy.

I did get a good look at the menu though.   It really irks me though I drove across town just to hit this spot as it's vegan and it was a waste of time, gas and energy.

We were both very satisfied with them. We will be returning very soon. When we left the cashier told us to have a nice day. Good service.

The woman who served our food, seems to be the manager or something, was extremely rude. She dropped our food and started walking away in the middle of me asking her for something. She then proceeded to yell to me from across the dining area because she couldn't be bothered to listen when I was addressing her. Then, while beginning to eat my nachos, I realize that they forgot my ""meat"" and had to again go up and ask for something else. My husband got the supreme fries, aka cold fries drowned in toppings. 

Overall, I am HIGHLY disappointed waisting a 30 min drive to go to a place that couldn't care less about customer service at all. This will be my last visit to this establishment. Too much competition in Las Vegas to treat your customers like crap.

The restaurant itself was clean and didn't have loud annoying music blaring, I got my order to go and that is where the problems started. I ordered dinner for myself and my husband, along with dessert. I was unable to eat the dessert because it was just way to sweet. I like sweet things, but this was just too sugary. The cake seemed a little hard, so I don't think it was fresh baked. The only flavor I could get out of it was ""sweet"". The rolled tacos were okay, they were filled with potato, which I knew before ordering, but there was just not enough flavor to them. Included in the take out bag was two small containers of sauce. The red one was very hot, but kind of tasteless and the green one was very mild and also tasteless. The tacos were crispy, but that is all I could really say for them. The rice had no flavor either, it really needed some spices and maybe some chopped green onions or something in it to make it flavorful. I don't know for sure, but I don't think the rice was very fresh either. The beans also were not flavorful, I was so disappointed! I tasted my husbands burrito (get your mind out of the gutter!!!), and it was the tastiest thing we ordered, but still not that great, it was filled with the same rice that was served on the side. 

The worst part of this whole thing (PLEASE TAKE NOTE FOLKS WHO ORDER THEIR FOOD TO GO) is the boxes they put the food in are not at all sturdy. They put the boxes in a bag that is just big enough to fit. When I tried taking out the first big box, the contents ended up in the bag. I appreciate the fact that the boxes are good for the environment, but I wish they would have told me to just rip the bag open to get to the food. I highly advise doing that. 

I really wish it would have been more to my liking, but I make some scrumptious vegan Mexican food at home, and maybe I'm just spoiled. I am glad that they have a presence in Las Vegas and I'm glad that so many people love the place.

The presentation of the nachos was so appetizing that one of the patrons asked if they could take a picture of my food. Their portions are also very generous, especially for the price.

The only thing I disliked was that the ratio of nachos to toppings was not proportionate. If you're like me and you love your toppings, this may be a problem for you. I wish the classic nachos were served with queso instead of shredded cheese so it would be easier to get cheese on every bite. I also wish there was more than just a drizzle of sour cream on top and a dollop of guacamole because there's no way you could get more than just a few chips with sour cream and guac on them.

The street tacos tasted great, I have no complaints there. Next time I eat here I will probably be ordering more tacos instead of nachos. Overall, I think it's a nice place for vegan Mexican food.",f-Qepve8hGa9mE6YuTPe3w,0,0,3,CzNDtUH9AoPiF58uUgYKIw

This place has completely assuaged that fear of never tasting asada, al pastor, and chorizo ever again. The flavors and textures are completely on point, I couldn't have asked for a better food experience. We also had a great service experience as well.

I got a northern Mexican sope al pastor, a taco de asada, and a wet burrito al pastor as well. The tacos are authentic street tacos, so all they have are the meat, cilantro, and onion, which worried me because so many meat substitutes are overcooked, but it was absolutely perfect.

3448013,2018-06-21,0,nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"If you are vegan and enjoy eating vegan tacos, then you would certainly enjoy eating at Panchos Vegan tacos.  Panchos Vegan Tacos is located on the East side of Las Vegas inside the Tropicana Plaza. This taco joint does not only have tacos, but it has a variety of mexican food such as sopes, nachos, burritos etc; and they're all vegan. Panchos is a vegan restaurant that just opened up in the middle of 2017 and has been getting more popular as the population of vegan/ vegetarians has been growing overall too.
    Having vegan family members can make eating out hard to do, because there is not a lot of vegan options in Las Vegas. I have come across a bunch of vegan places which have only been burger joints. I am vegetarian so my options of eating out is not as difficult as it is for my mother.  There is currently only one Panchos Vegan Tacos in Las Vegas as it a little brand new. Panchos Vegan Tacos is like a Robertos but everything on their menus is all vegan. Their tacos are filled with vegan ground meat and topped with cilantro, pico de gallo, and green spicy salsa. Their sopes are also topped off with vegan meat, chopped lettuce and tomatoes and a vegan cream. 
    I came across this place on Mother's Day. On a special day like this I did not want to take my mother to eat at the same burger joint she always goes to. So when we came across Panchos Vegan Tacos we thought it would be gross because the menus online did not look satisfying and the photos that were posted did not look as great either. When arriving, the restaurant was packed, and the place looked very unorganized, they used one whole section of the restaurant for the employees and guest to order their food, and the other half of the restaurant had about 8 booths and 4 tables. This restaurant does feel crowded because you have the line of guests ordering and then the other half of the line is outside or in the dining room area.  
Although I had a first bad impression of this place, the employee greeted us and we told her that we were new to this place. Once we informed her of being new she explained the entire menu to us making things easier for us to explore the menu. Their food certainly surprised me and I was very surprised on how similar the street tacos from Panchos Vegan Tacos tasted like real street tacos.  My mother certainly enjoyed coming here as she told me how great the street tacos were too and how the sopes tasted just like the sopes she makes at home. This place does not only bring you great quality of food but it can also bring you back to home, because the foods have similar tastings to the original dishes. 
The pricing for each plate is very affordable and the highest I have seen on the menu was about ten dollars, and that was for a huge burrito. Eating out at a vegan restaurant can turn out to be very expensive because there is not a lot to begin with, making prices higher since it is a unique thing to have in the city . So far this place is great and affordable and you can take someone out to eat here for just about any event.
One thing that I loved about this restaurant is how pet friendly they are. I know that some people are not comfortable with having pets in the space that they are eating at, but this place surprised me because not only did the employees not mind but the guest at that time eating there did not mind also. This explains how good the environment here is and the atmosphere.Another thing I loved was the great service they provide, the employees did not mind taking the time to explain the entire menu to us and tell us how their dishes were done, I believe that's what helped us pick our dish because it gave us details of what we were going to be expecting. I recommend anyone who loves street tacos and mexican food overall to come visit Panchos Vegan Tacos. 
I was satisfied with this place and have already told others to come here and have received great feedback. A couple of feedbacks I have received were from people who were not vegan/ vegetarian and have told me that the food that they tried tasted better than a taco with real meat. I have also received feedback from someone who was encouraged to stop eating meat because it made her realize that she can still eat her favorite foods with no meats. I have received a lot of positive feedback about the dishes and feedback about encouraging some people to try out the vegan/ vegetarian lifestyle. I think it is amazing that a simple review like minds can change another person's mindset in the up most positive ways. My intentions of sharing this place with others was not to encourage others to go vegan but to tell those who are vegan/ vegetarian to try this mexican joint out.",_Cp5iNqH0TDLVHhmQB1gGA,1,1,5,KjopEZXU2_B37pKcjdiaAA

I don't know about you but no parent wants to deal with their hungry kids be upset while waiting for their food. The best part is when they actually bring my kids sides they bring NO PLATES or FORKS!!!! I'm not sure if every time they forget or assume my kids will eat from the table and use their hands. When I ask them for these simple things I always get and attitude and have to wait even longer meanwhile I finished my food 10 minuets earlier.

definitely the best thing in las vegas and probably best mexican place anywhere. not to mention vegan of course duh! there is large block lettering outside so you won't miss it!

we came here on our last day in vegas right when it opened at 10am and got the chilaquiles, red and green tamales, chickend and asada soft street tacos. 

be prepared to drink lots of water (if you're basic like me) bc the chilaquiles are quite spicy but absolutely addictive! god i dream about that dish. the rice and beans they came with help to quell the spice. the rice was really good too. 

loved both tacos, i think we liked the asada better. they are such a deal and typical tortilla size, so i would definitely get more than 2 if you're not getting anything else. 

i'll pass on the tamales, they don't always have em, but compared to the other stuff-- they were dry and a bit bland. of course they came with a red and green salsa but my mouth was already on fire so i just couldn't anymore. 

they were out of horchata but have a hibiscus tea drink and unsweetened (yay!) iced black tea. 

god i love this place.

friendly owner & service. they've only opened about a year ago. your food gets served to you and they were kind enough to fill our water bottles. 

we came on a friday morning so there were only about 2 others but one more came in. 

casual, fast food like ambiance. looks like they're doing construction to expand their space. 

petition to open one in la! please! i need pancho's!

if you live in la, it's worth it to drive a few hours and get pancho's. other good vegan spots around too. make it a vegan day trip!

ugh my mouth waters every time i think of this place. love that it's all vegan and mexican. yes!!!

I had the al pastor torta and carne Asada taco, ALL VEGAN.  Great posole, rolled potato tacos.  Very helpful cheerfull staff, even the owner was sitting down.  Will definitely be back
Many more times to this amazing completely vegan Mexican restaurant !

Went back next day to entertain some family, and the food just seemed disappointing... it's incredibly incredibly
Bland, no seasoning, no depth, as a chef by profession these are things I look for.. when you ask for salt they give you little tiny packets and to season your food properly you're gonna need at least 8... all growing pain issues that can be fixed to make the place successful. Food inconsistent at the same time two days in a row .. wish the best though and hope they work these issues out and succeed.",Uh6DToB8too37cPVwbkHEw,1,1,3,VWFhy_i_KG5ABJ2H3APasQ

Cashiers weren't really knowledgeable about the food and had to go ask someone else about what they used in some of the items. 
But over all the food is amazing.  And they have daily specials which is a bonus for me. portions are large and prices are low.
I recommend the potatoe rolled tacos and the pozole with mushrooms. Oh and wait the nachos were freaking delicous!!

I had the Chilaquiles with both green and red sauce and it was really good. I decided to add a full size taco and picked the mushroom as the ""meat"" and what a great choice. It was the best thing we ate. My wife who is NOT vegan loved the taco too. She ordered two potato tacos and was not expecting much but she came away really impressed. The chips and salsa were good too. We saw a couple of guys order the nacho plate, man it was huge.

4039393,2018-01-05,1,nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"I never thought I'd say this, but their vegan al pastor tacos are better than the al pastor at most traditional taco shops. Talk about seasoning! 

Pancho's is bringing affordable vegan food to the masses and what better way than by Mexican food! I've eaten here a handful of times and my food never disappoints. I have to admit I've had all of their meat and I'm sure you know my favorite is al pastor. I've had their tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and nachos. They also carry soup and tamales.

If you need a recommendation then definitely do the tacos or a quesadilla on corn tortilla. I feel like the burrito has way too much everything else in it and then the non-melted cheese on the nachos are a put off. The quesadillas with melted vegan cheese is amazing!

My only suggestion to get that last star is their customer service and the store cleanliness. I'm sure they run on a tight profit margin, but they need to step up their ordering system to be more organized. Also they could really spice up their beans and rice. Hate to admit but they are pretty bland. 

Definitely check out Pancho's to help save the earth. They have awesome weekly specials like taco Tuesday! Theirs includes three tacos and a drink for less than five bucks. It's very affordable and centrally located.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,6,2,4,o744NfcWt67eFeAUuNia0Q

Then I saw a lot of people coming in and out. It was full. I was curious and looked at the reviews on both yelp and google and both nearly 5 stars. I ordered two tacos of al pastor and I couldn't even notice the difference. If anything it tasted better since with no meat the food is based solely on flavor.

As a lifelong Mexican food eater from San Diego and full-blown anti-veg carnivore up until a few years ago, I can say that this place delivers like no other. It is real Mexican food--spot-on ""meats"" and sauces and sour cream--but 100% plants. The location, ambience, menu, and service is authentic hidden gem, strip-mall Mexican food, yet, dare I say it again, made from plants.

I sampled the potato rolled tacos (crispy and satisfying--I could have eaten 5), ""cheese"" and jalapeño tamale (very good without being dry), the ""beef"" tamale (also good, though I think I liked the jalapeño better because I like the little kick), and the wet burrito with both the red and green sauces (HUGE burrito with crumbled beef that is so ""real,"" you'll be truly concerned that a mistake was made). I liked the green sauce a little more, but both sauces were perfect and I asked for another serving. I would legitimately buy those sauces and put them on everything.

My man sampled my plates and also had the ""chicken"" burrito--loved it all, couldn't believe the serving sizes, loved the sauces, and walked out stunned that we got our ""dirty Mexican food"" vegan style. ""How did they make the rice vegan!? What sour cream is that!? Can you believe the menu!? Can we go back tomorrow!? That wasn't greasy and I don't feel gross--how is this happening!?"" He's an Alberto's (Filibertos, etc.) guy and felt like, for the first time in around 6 years, that he got ""his food"" without compromising a thing. The boy was practically dancing in the streets. 

No way that anyone will think the food is vegan--everyone will like it. Flavorful, filling, messy, crunchy, saucy, awesome Mexican food without consuming/harming/using an animal. Just wow.",Chwk1kLfQhstO_EIbxFGMQ,2,0,5,DEKUjGYEuxg2wzEiVvFWwQ

The customer service from this company specially today was very poor! I was informed they were on dirty dining and because I made a comment on one of their Facebook post they felt the need to send me a private message being extremely defensive. After I readdressed this via their public post they continued to argue with me through their social media account. I just don't think that's something you do to a customer.... specially when the vegan community here in Las Vegas is very tight-knit.... not sure on how I feel about this, it's tough when you enjoy the food of a place but the service is not up to par.....


So I was surprised to see that a place would actually have authentic vegan tacos. The location of this place was a bit confusing but it's located by the Tropicana Cinema. The prices are very affordable there's a lot of choices with drink combos too. I stuck to the single authentic style tacos these are made out of seitan. I used to be a meat eater and tacos were some of three foods I missed the more THESE TACOS ARE SOOO GOOD you cannot tell the difference from real meat.

4720965,2017-05-27,0,nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"I can't believe that there is a Mexican restaurant that is completely vegan! And on top of that, it's actually really, really good!

So I actually had this place bookmarked a few weeks ago since its not that far from where I live. I had looked at a few of the pictures and saw the 4.5 star ranking and figured any place with this many good reviews I need to try. I saw they had Vegan tacos but I assumed they just had a few items, not the whole menu. I'm not vegan, but I have recently been trying some vegan food in an attempt to eat healthier. I found the fact that this place is completely plant based to be a pleasant surprise.

So my wife and I ordered too much food as usual (thank you for to-go boxes) and were very happy with almost everything. We got the nachos with ""asada"", five different types of tacos, potato taquitos and a Cuban torta.

The nacho cheese sauce was fantastic and you couldn't tell it wasn't real cheese. We asked how it was made and told us it is made with potatoes, carrots and nutritional yeast, plus some secret ingredients. I would eat this over the usual neon yellow nacho cheese any day.

The torta was my favorite thing, and again I couldn't tell it wasn't real meat. It had ""ham"" and ""turkey"" and ""hot dogs"", along with tofu, avocado and ""cheese"". Though I wouldn't call this a Cuban, it was easily the equal of any other torta I have ever had.

The taquitos were one of only two things that weren't that great (I'll get to the other later). It's not that they were bad, it's just that they weren't as good as the other food we had. They potato didn't really stand out as a filler for the taquitos, but they were pretty decent after being dipped in salsa. If you are a person that likes taquitos more for the crunch of the fried tortilla than the meat inside you'll probably like these. I could see myself ordering them again if I was in the right mood.

For the tacos we got one ""asada"", one ""pastor"", one ""chorizo"", one ""chicken"" and one mushroom. The mushroom (the only one not trying to imitate meat), while far from traditional was delicious. Along with the mushroom we also loved the chorizo, which you couldn't tell wasn't real chorizo. The chicken was also very good and tasted like chicken, and the pastor could pass for pork but was a little to sweet for my taste. The only one we didn't really care for that much was the ""asada"". We also ordered the asada on our nachos and it was by far the least favorite ""meat"" we tried. It wasn't so much that it was bad, but it didn't taste anything like carne asada or beef in general for that matter. Its consistency was more like a sausage than steak, and it's probably the only thing we wouldn't get again.

There was also one additional meat, cactus, which we didn't try but I guess we will get that next time. I can't really hold the ""asada"" against them considering I have yet to find a vegan substitute for beef that actually taste like beef. I have now had vegan cheese, eggs, pork and chicken and loved each one, but I guess beef is much harder to pull off.

The prices were on par with any other Mexican place you'd go to, though I thought the torta for $10 was a little high, despite how good it was. The nachos on the other hand for $5, with the option to add meat for a $1, are a fantastic deal.

Even if your not vegan, but you enjoy Mexican food, I highly recommend coming here. If you are vegan then this place is a must.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,4,2,5,klMghDJTJUj1YUpzCJGhNw

DINNER

Not good.

Hubby and I semi-vegan for a while. Tried many soy and gluten meat substitutes, never liked any except firm tofu. Hubby is amazing cook, uses tofu WELL in home cooking. He'd chef a great vegan restaurant if given the chance. Recently became full-time vegans for 5 months in prep for vacation. Only began playing with dairy substitutes at home, having good luck finding palatable ones.

Went to Pancho's with friend who had liked it his few previous visits.

Woman taking order at counter (walk in, order at counter, brought food to table) initially unfriendly and distracted, got her in better mood after a while. Paid with credit card, later discovered never given receipt, so can't confirm if 10% discounted, sign at counter states ""Meatless Monday"" 10% off. Ordered a lot of food because friend recommended it, stating portions were ""small"", but they really weren't.

SALSAS (CONTAINERS COME WITH MEAL)
green: YES
red: YES

SALSA (ON SIDE)
pico de gallo: YES

MEATS
Asada (gluten-based steak substitute): NO
Chik-end (soy-based chicken substitute): NO
turkey: NO
ham: NO
bacon: NO
hotdog: NO
tofu: MAYBE
mushrooms: YES
nopales (cactus): YES

DAIRY
melting cheddar cheese: NO
melting white cheese: MAYBE

DISHES
- Classic Nachos ($8.99) with Chik-end: MAYBE. Mountainous. Avoided Chik-end. Sour cream, sprinkled cheese acceptable. Red/green salsas great when added to it.
- Cuban Torta ($9.99): NO. Downright weird concept.
- 3 Soft Street Tacos combo ($7.99): MAYBE. Vegetation (fresh cilantro, chopped onions) was fine. Out of 3 ""meats"" only mushrooms good. Supposed to come with rice & beans, never got those, hubby said via his burrito ""you didn't miss anything"".
- Fried Rolled Potato Taco AKA Dorado ($1.50): NO. Bland.
- Corn Quesadilla ($5.99): MAYBE. Mushrooms great. White cheese acceptable.
- Classic Burrito ($7.99): NO. Ordered w/ mushrooms & nopales. Bland, virtually all rice, a few beans and very little mushrooms or nopales.

DRINKS
Sangria soda ($2.50): YES. Arrived immediately.
Tamarind soda ($2.50): YES. But had to go to counter to ask for drink halfway thru meal.

My tacos came to table quickly, but had to ask about potato taco & quesadilla after patiently waiting quite a while.

Overall consensus: BLAND. Where's the seasoning? The garlic? And spiciness? Only via hot sauce at front counter or red/green salsas. So do most vegans, or vegan americans, prefer bland food? This place would make you think so. Hubby went to the counter to ask for sliced jalapenos for his burrito, told they didn't have any. Cuban arrived with sliced jalapenos on it and stated so on the menu. WTF?

We won't be back.

When ordering delivery through a 3rd party (Postmates, Uber Eats, Amazon) each service lists the menu items differently, and there are a few minor price discrepancies between them as well. I'd recommend they review their menus on each am make them consistent, especially when it comes to listing items such as fillings properly.

I finally came here for lunch!

1. Location - You are gonna have a hard time finding this as it is tucked into a strip mall that is somewhat discombobulated in terms of access and all the different stores.  This is the location where there is a Dunkin Donut, 7/11 and a Tropicana Theater that has older released movies for cheap.  If you go at lunch, it can be hard to park.

2. The Restaurant - Interesting Decor, built for efficiency more than modernism.  Not a negative, and really it is just okay, but boy is it very efficient.  Order food, sit and wait and you can see them processing the food or you can dine in on the dining room side that has a few tables . The restaurant was quite busy during lunch.

3. The food - Yes, I love mushrooms so I had a classic  burrito with mushrooms.  It was so good and I love the two sauces that they give you. I used them both.  The rice, beans are perfect and with the mushrooms, you cannot beat the taste.  I was about to order another one for dinner it was so good.

They offer four choices of vegan meat, a gluten based Asasa/Al Pastor / Chorizo, Mushrooms, Soy based meat or cactus.  I haven't tried the cactus yet, but if it is like a jack fruit, that should be good. 

Next on my list will be Soft Street Tacos, Tomales and I cannot wait to try the Posole.

4938424,2017-03-15,1,nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"I came here after seeing so many good posts about this place in the ""Las Vegas Vegans"" Facebook group. Honestly, I was disappointed...

I told the owner to order me his 2 favorite dishes. He chose the enchiladas and a torta. I was not impressed with either. The enchiladas came with rice and beans. The rice was okay, but the beans lacked flavor (tasted like water). 

It seems as though the chef went through the vegan freezer section and bought all the fake meats and cheeses, put them together, and called it cooking. This is 100% fast food for junk food vegans. If you are looking for food with any nutritional value, this is not the place. 

That being said, I do think this place is a great transition for stubborn carnivorous junk food eaters. You might even be able to trick a meat eater into eating here! I applaud Pancho's for spreading veganism and was happy to see how busy they were when I went in. Over half the tables were full when I went! 

The owner and the staff were incredibly friendly. The owner kept checking on me, and he was ready to answer any questions I might have had. So although I'm not the biggest fan of the food, I really like the staff and appreciate their spread of vegan knowledge. I honestly wish nothing but success for this place! 

*They may want to change their name though, because Pancho's Kitchen is AMAZING healthier vegan Mexican food so people may have higher expectations if they see Pancho's Tacos with the similar name.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,10,3,3,NlBfTCLGRxMB-KLvEJrlMw

The food is really really good for the price especially being Vegan but I can give 5 stars because my Tamale was essentially the most dried out thing that wasn't even edible and they messed up our order .

We dined inside but before that we stood in a pretty long line to be helped . When ordered a blonde guy with a pony tale was going to take our order till I asked what the products were made with (I have a soy intolerance ) anyway he had Zack take the order in which not only did we order lunch but my friends got their dinner to go and asked for sauce on the side which didn't end up happening and had to be remade later on . Once we placed our order we found a seat.

The food came out as it was ready I guess but my friends all got their food and I was waiting for my one asada taco which was delicious , potato taco which I wasn't wowsers over and I already discussed my jalapeño and cheese Tamale that essentially was just a waste of money . I can say Vegan tamales I got from sprouts and made myself were better which is why I can't go to four stars but especially with the Service .

My food came last and they didn't offer or bring me any salsa or dipping sauces . There was a woman browsing around asking if we were okay but she didn't really know where my food was and later when our to go order was wrong nobody seemed apologetic but they made sure to charge for the refills .

Overall it's affordable Vegan with tons of variety and decent quality items.. 

My friends got nachos with mushroom which were okay but I felt lacking sauce ...

I really liked the taste of the asada and for vegan it's worth trying I just hope you get better help than I received",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,10,4,3,lK5NBMTGriczecZciuqA8w

One of a kind is definitely fitting for this pretty frig-gggin delicious authentic vegan restaurant. I ordered the ""Tuesday"" special three asada tacos, three fried rolled potato tacos, and two tamales for approximately $15.00. With the exception of the tamales everything else is totally worth returning for! The seasoning was on point, and each dish taste uniquely different as it should (unlike some of the other competitors). The presentation of my to-go order was simple yet impressive. It was refreshing not to see any oil or grease in my containers. 

Useful Tip: Utilize the menu before ordering at the counter. 

The cashier was pretty intimidating he just stood their asking is that it repetitively. If your seeking an vibrant, down to earth vibe from management this might not be your place aside from that the food is terrific and 100 percent worth returning for!!",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,7,5,4,hDBBGumGYoxvJFuQzTuklg

It comes with 3 potato tacos and a side of rice and beans. Everything tasted great - I had zero complaints. No meal would be complete at a taco shop without some horchata. As far as I know, Pancho's Tacos is the only place in town with vegan horchata. I've also tried the Gran Torta ($9.99), which is not to fuck with. Seriously, it's loaded up with chorizo, ham, cheese, and who knows what else. Just eat it.

Oh yeah, did I forget to mention the menu is 100% vegan? Pancho's is a vegan hotspot, but on the two times that I've been here omnis have waltzed in with no idea this place was even a vegan restaurant. Notably, they stayed to try out the food so kudos to Pancho's for exposing the masses to good Mexican vegan food.

I continue to stand tall about exploring more kid menu options that make sense. It's difficult to get younger children to maintain the plant based eating habits. You have an opportunity to truly craft a solution that is much needed in this town, and in my favorite type of food, Mexican. 

Taking this need and owning it could go a long way! It's also not advantageous as a parent to order the quesadilla and it be over $7. 

I wanted to just get that tidbit out of the way so I can reinforce that aside from the suggestion - this restaurant still receives top marks. 

The enchiladas are amazing, sopes and posole - just the way I remember, as well as street tacos and other popular favorites! 

You get red or green sauce, or when you takeout - both, and it's phenomenal. I took advantage of the $1 Vegan donuts and yea, just had to. So delicious.

My favorite is the Asada street tacos! They're so delicious and simple, Two just never seems like enough. 

Tonight we ordered the 3 taco special that comes with a drink for 6.99. Those were great as always, my fav. 

We also ordered the the classic nachos, oh my gosh were those huge! Way more than the two of us could eat and they were delicious too. I forgot to snap a picture of just how big and pretty they were. I liked them a lot though,  I wish the cheese could have been melted into the chips before adding all the rest of the toppings. For the cheese being vegan it is good but would be better melted. 

As for Panchos itself, this place is always busy! They're actually expanding right now into the unit right next door. The set up is great. They take the orders in the old room and you sit and wait in the expansion room. The menu also looks larger than the last time I was there. They're offering burgers, no-so-tuna melts and even breakfasts. 

I've heard the tamales were good, I need to try those next time. They sell them by the dozen, just check ahead of time if they have any.

Only downside I can say is that their horchata was not that good. It tastes very powdery and the residue sticks in your mouth. Hopefully, the horchata is different the next time around. The jamaica was a good though - not too sweet, and has a touch of that tart flavor.

5566674,2017-11-22,6,nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"""Updating"" as a reply for the owner. 

Firstly: I never said nor stated I am strictly vegan. NOT being vegan however, doesn't diminish nor make my inquiries any less valid. My personal dietary restrictions don't take away my concerns for what is in your food that I am PAYING for and putting in my body. I'm flattered you dug through my other reviews though. 

Secondly: How are you going to dispute ME on what YOUR employee SAID TO ME - To go and visit the taco shop around there. Because yes, he also is NOT vegan (like I told him I wasn't!)and eats at the taco shop when he doesn't want to eat where he works. Obviously you weren't there because if you were I would have received all this information on the spot. Which leads us to

My third point: I appreciate you giving us information about the food (now). The problem you STILL FAIL to realize AND address, is that NOWHERE on your website, or menus can we have the knowledge of (and verify) ingredients and the sources. You said it yourself!! All those other places are frozen , pre-made etc. So we're suppose to just now take your word on the basis that you ""exposed"" other establishments? That's what I meant when I said you have a responsibility as a VEGAN establishment to provide this information TRANSPARENTLY and have it READILY available to support your claim. It's nowhere to be found. If you don't understand what I am asking for with ""What are your ingredients for your all your vegan protein?"" I cant help you. That is as clear as I can make it. This IS about Panchos, not any other place. 

Fourth: To be fair here. I read a couple of reviews BEFORE writing mine because I said to myself  ""Am I? Am I the only one who thinks this way?"" And no! I am not alone. Read some four star reviews, even five star reviews and you'll see where I get what I am saying in my review. Your customer base (not all) says your establishment is out of items constantly, the drink selection is minuscule to bare minimum and I got the ""hole in the wall"" reference from another two reviews. I was not the first one. So maybe even if reviews give you four or five stars, you should read them. Or don't. It's your business. 

Lastly: This is very audacious of you.

 ""Simply for the fact that we are 100% vegan, non-gmo and low sodium... your life just got healthier.""

Why cause  low sodium? Just because you believe that less sodium is good for you shows me how uninformed you personally really are. The scientific community has never come to consensus  that less sodium is best for everyone. Low sodium IS better when you've overloaded your system with it or if you have an intolerance to it. I am not in need of low sodium or non-gmo. I am in need of less calories. Which is what most of your dishes are NOT. Based on what I was served (NOT HOW MUCH I ATE) alone, it contained all my calories for one 24 hour period... a detriment to MY diet. Why would you think eating out at your establishment is making MY life healthier? How do you know I'm not having a cheat meal at your restaurant? Healthy = is a dish with protein equivalent to fats and carbs OR high volume (A LOT OF FOOD) but low fat/low carb. Again, something the dishes served here aren't. 

'When people say that Pancho's Vegan Tacos is a ""fast food"" place.. makes me wonder.' 

Wonder no more. I just answered it for you.  If I ate here everyday I would become morbidly obese. It doesnt fit the healthy profile based on the proportions of carbs/protein or volume/carbs to MAINTAIN a healthy lifestyle. Personally, I maintain a strict diet so that I can eat out often. Unfortunately, I cant do that here.

I will check out your new location once it opens and the old one closes, maybe you'll have the nutrition facts and I will surely update my review then.",miaAbv1x0G7D5aPQfVL53g,4,3,2,3eCXkPUL725RZIwOBUxdAw

With that being said it's still good food, the cheese and jalepeno tamale is good the tacos are ok, and the wet burrito with red sauce was good too, their just needs to be better communication as the order was messed up and also their was a lack of customer service, she didn't seem happy just bleh about everything which I've met people like that so it may just be how she is.

Cashier seemed a bit impatient and not as friendly as I hoped. However, the food was GREAT and I enjoyed it.",qSCnbhwyDqsFQbVqq6-C9A,1,1,4,FRqyuaXnEt4Bqfw8n64BFg

Wait times can get somewhat long but the staff keeps you updated as much as possible and, honestly, why are you going out to eat if you're in THAT much of a rush? Also, they're a small business just starting out, you have to forgive if they're out of certain products-at least they let you know right off the bat instead of keeping you guessing. If I could donate a million dollars to any restaurant it would be this place. I can't get over how delicious and authentic the food tastes and how FRIENDLY!!! The staff is. I love this place so much, and I'm so glad they're expanding. Definitely make this place a regular one.",VoRYTBty1GI2Dw6yOYeTqA,1,0,5,OEDk7AknIYIsdTyvGGJDEA

I'm so happy there is a place like this in Vegas, the food is delicious, I was having trouble finding tasty vegan food in town, this place is definitely the solution, so good, I can't wait to explore their menu, so far I had asada tacos, pastor, and posole! My new favorite spot!",sDcZSWUsxxiEommvO_hzwA,0,0,5,nqeSncrJm0dJ9SUpeVnisg
