124257,2011-12-18,0,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"Have you ever gone to a restaurant and remembered having a great experience, only to return and find yourself very disappointed? Such is the case with my most recent visit to I Love Burgers. I first went about a year ago before I had started the blog and have been meaning to go back and give a proper review based on that impression. Sadly now I wish I hadn't returned because my view has been tainted.

I Love Burgers is located in the shops inside the Palazzo in the heart of tourist territory. While the space is a bit too open and sparse, it's kind of a fun, bubbly attempt at something modern and different. The one major complaint I would have is that the lighting is totally inconsistent and awful. But I'm sure 99% of the people that go in there don't even give this a thought so we can move on.

Their menu has everything from appetizers, to shakes, salads, and of course burgers. In addition to some Angus offerings, they also have ground buffalo, turkey and chicken burgers. I had the fried mac and cheese bites on my first visit and wasn't that happy with them, so chose to skip any apps this time. My lunch partner ordered the fried pickles and I guess they were ok although I probably wouldn't order them again. I usually don't mess around with any strange offerings on my initial review visits as I'm trying to focus solely on the burger.

As for the burger, this second visit was very disappointing. There was one word I wanted to repeat over and over again: DRY. I'm sad to say that this was the first time I've ever taken apart a burger for one of my reviews and actually add a decent helping of ketchup. The meat was dry, the bun was dry, and it needed help. The meat had ok flavor, but it was just too dry and overcooked to be good. The lettuce was a bit weak, the tomato didn't help, and my cheese was melted but not really present. I don't really remember many of the specifics of my first visit, but I do remember being happy enough to make a mental note for a full return and official review. I'm not sure if I just caught them on a bad day or if things have changed and are not as good as before.

One thing I'm sure that changed were the fries. On my first visit I had shoestring fries which I remember being far too thin and not quite substantial enough to hold any good flavor throughout my meal. On this visit I was given normal fries, but found them to be very soggy and had a bad oily taste. Maybe a place that is called I Love Burgers isn't as concerned with their fries, if I wanted amazing fries I should go to I Love Fries?

I do want to make a special note in this review and mention the representatives of this restaurant chain. While I was there for lunch I tweeted my location and got a response from them the next day asking how my meal was. After a small conversation back and forth explaining my disappointment, they were very apologetic and mentioned that after supposedly selling over 150,000 burgers this year they're bound to mess up occasionally. I can definitely accept this explanation, and wouldn't write them off for good, but still have to take points off for inconsistency between my two visits, and also take into consideration that my friend was equally as disappointed with his meal. Maybe I'll try their Town Square location next time for something a little different.

Based on all that, what can I say? A $10 dry burger, combined with $5 of disappointing fries makes this for a pricey meal that I wasn't happy with. I guess you can take the strip location into account for the price, but I have a hard time paying $5 for fries almost anywhere. At this point I'm really not sure if I can recommend going here, sorry to say. Maybe next time I'm down at Town Square I'll venture into that location and hope for a better experience.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,0,2,MpdFFG7ChFx0ZsfGEp6qvQ

When the waitress finally came to our table to take our order, she interrupted my boyfriend mid sentence when he was ordering  to have a conversation with another waitress who was walking by. Naturally, my boyfriend and I were a bit annoyed that she thought her conversation with this other waitress was more important than hearing the rest of our order. when she  finished her conversation she looked at us annoyed and said ""uhh is there something you'd like to say to me?

4 nights in Vegas for the Rugby Seven's Tourney.  Decided to ease up on the nightly $200 dinner bill and go for a burger with the wife, daughter, sis/bro-in-law and their infant daughter.  We get seated after waiting 15 minutes (restaurant was not even half full).  Sit down and waitress ask for our drink orders.  I order an orange shake and a water.  water comes out in a few minutes. She takes our order.  We wait ten, twenty, thirty minutes. not one thing comes.  We would have made a huff, but our kids were there and Redfoo from LMFAO was sitting next to us, so we let it slide for the moment.  Now we watch Redfoo get his food, eat it and leave, and three tables around us get drinks and appetizers going.  Finally, flag the waitress (who clearly didn't give a rats ass about customer service) and ask what gives?  She says, ""Oh yeah, i think the ticket got stuck in the machine.  it will be out in a few minutes"".  30 minutes later, the bro-in-law leaves and our food comes out.  The guy who brings out the food yells across the room to the hostess up front.  ""IS THIS 21.  IS THIS FOR TABLE 21?""  as he starts giving our food to another table.  We say its our food and tell him we've been waiting over an hour for our food.  He says, ""no you haven't""  the ticket says 26 minutes.""  Idiot.  So we get our food, they forget half of the order and my daugther's meal was left out.  We wait another 10 minutes for my daughter's food to come.  Still haven't gotten my shake.  For the first time since she took our order, server comes buy and we tell her, we've waited over an hour for our food, our order was wrong and items were forgotten.  She responds, ""I guess the teamwork isn't working today."" whatt????  Then she says, ""well you still want the shake?""  Never an apology, or acknowledgement of our waiting so long. 

After all the waiting, our food was not good at all.  Just average fair.  Would have been better to go to McD's.  Oh and I finally got that shake. After my meal was finished.  

I will be sharing this with the corporate folks and the Palazzo.  It was shameful and those who run this business should know that their staff is going to ruin their business.",jx0Gi_1gOcbsNxs_gAk-8w,0,0,1,Efqdkqttp_ejorIHX4rLyA

The entire table of 6 ordered  the dante, I heart bacon, standard, and bbq burger. The waitress messed up on our order for the bbq burger, it was suppose to be the wagyu kobe burger.

I tried all of the different burgers and fries and here are my recommendations. The I heart bacon burger and poutine fries. The bacon burger was the juiciest and tastiest burger out of all ones we ordered. It was just how I would prepare the burger myself. I don't really like blue cheese, so that is why I did not really like the dante burger. Why poutine fries? It got mushrooms in it. That's all.

I Love Burgers - its time to cough up fries with your burgers at no additional charge.

I also had the strawberry milkshake it was very very good, however again it was a bit high for the amount you get.  (a small slender glass with a 1/4 leftover in the milkshake shaker).

Firstly, the service was amazing. We had Ryan for our server, and from beginning to end she was attentive, sweet and so helpful in recommending items to us.

We stumbled on this place because we spent the afternoon shopping and really didn't want another ""upscale"" experience after the seafood and steakhouse dinner and lunch we had at the Encore. A burger was exactly what we wanted and this place hit the spot.

What we ordered:

Fried Mac & Cheese for appetizer: YUM!! It had a slight kick of spice that wasn't over bearing and paired so well with the cheesiness of Mac and cheese.

The Steak Burger: their C.A.B. is just that- genuine Angus meat. It was juicy and flavorful. I'm not a fan of cheese in my sandwiches, and quite honestly I'm glad. The bacon and carmelized onions with their Worcester aioli was so delicious. And the brioche bun was nice and soft- just a little filling.

The love & Seoul: the onions were a little overwhelming but the wasabi mayo and fried egg added a good flavor touch to this one. 

Onion rings: your basic battered fare. Good, but nothing crazy to sing about.

Do yourself a favor and get a spiked shake!!! Ohmygosh... I would come back just for this shake. We got the Buzz- ice cream, bailey's vodka and kahlua... It was serious ice cream grown up heaven.

And as the other reviewers have mentioned, an In-n-Out burger for $2 tops this burger. We also ordered the restaurant's housemade chips, as suggested by the waitress. They tasted as though they had been sitting out for awhile. Since this is Vegas, I'll ""bet"" this place doesn't last longer than 2 years, if that long.

The first time I went with a friend of mine our burgers took over 45 minutes and they both came out wrong- wrong toppings, wrong meat temperature, etc. We were so hungry by the time the food arrived that we decided not to send the burger that was way overdone back and they literally brought out a slice of cheese for my friend to add to hers. The fries were ok, not as spectacular as the menu made them seem, but not bad. The service was not good and not bad.... 

I came in tonight as I was craving a good burger and had a better experience but only an ok burger. The service was great, Jason was attentive, friendly and helpful. The triple truffle fries were great! My Dante burger was literally soaking in caramelized onions and gooey blue cheese... Not bad but the consistency was soggy. The wine was surprisingly good and the deep-fried twinkles and Oreos were pretty good. 
I really do love a good burger so I will be back, but I do think everything is rather overpriced since it's a-la-carte and I easily spent $30 on a burger and fries each time...",qGPPquScTJALnkAZoYNx3Q,2,0,2,RxwlxUoAlXcLWqYzzMVBlg

They advertise 55 beers but I think that at least 50 of them are generic macro brews with a couple craft selections like Lagunitas and Stone.

We also had an order of fried pickles which came with an extra hair on them.  Interesting thing is that the pickles were sliced lengthwise and fried.  My wife had a frozen daquiri that was tasty.

Well this place was probably the worst place I've eaten a burger at. We got seated right away, I ordered a bbq burger well done , my husband ordered the double all American burger medium well and we shared garbage fries. We told the waiter if they can bring the garbage fries with the burgers. Well they brought the fries first as the appitizer, which was not what we wanted but it was.no big deal we understand things happen. Well after our ""appitizer"" we waited for over an hour for our burgers, we had really thought they had forgotten our burgers.so this is about 1 1/2 just for two burgers and fries that we have waited for. After they brought the burgers I bite into mine, blood came running out , the burger was medium rare and I could not eat it because I am pregnant which is why I ordered mine well done. So after waiting for an 1 1/2 I had to wait an additional 20 min just to get my order. Now the second time they brought my burger it was.cooked correctly but had no bbq. I didn't send it back, just ate it bc that wasn't a big deal to me even thou I ordered a bbq burger. So it's not almost 2 hours just for burgers . They brought out check and my husband saw they had charged us a for a ""refire"" which was the burger they had to redo since THEY did it wrong in the first place. We were really pissed off at this time so we asked to speak to the manager who told us he had forgotten to take off the charge. He kindly took it off, but it was ridiculous to even see they charge us for a mistake they made. 

So service sucks! It's the widest I've ever seen.
The taste of the burgers are ok if you get passed the grease very grease  burger part. Burger king burger has less grease then a burger from this joint
The only.good thing was the garbage fries were really good.

Overall this place sucks!! I rather had spend my money on burger king then this place.  So many people were just looking around wondering how long it is to get their burger. It took us well over 2 hours just to get served two burgers and fries. Worest experience ever.

 I stayed at Palazzo during new year, and decided to try this burger place for quick lunch. Great service, and we thought we found a good spot.
My husband ordered his burger medium, but came out, it was rare. He usually never eat rare meat, but for the price that they charge we expected good quality meat, so he didn't send the dish back.
Next day, he got bad diarrhea for several hours, by 2pm he was suffering with high fever and pain in stomach. I had to take him to urgent care. 
Later that day, I went to talk to the restaurant manager but he didn't really helped me and just handed me corporate manager's number and email. He actually said something like, it's in Vegas during the New Years, and my husband was possibly hungover!

He was so ill, so we had to extend one more day and I drove us back 2days later. As soon as we got back, then I got sick.
I had been contacting with the manager but since I paid my bill with cash and didn't keep my receipt they basically said I have no proof, and eventually they stop replying me. I didn't want to waste anymore time, so I stop contacting them.

i went ahead and sat at the bar because i feel kinda weird sitting in a booth or table by myself.on another topic, i don't understand why more people don't sit at bars and eat.the service is usually better and quicker.bartenders are also more interesting to talk to than waitresses.anyways...

sat and the bar and took a look at the menu.started off with a strawberry milkshake while i decided what to put into my stomach.the bartender recommended the Dante.It is a ground sirloin patty topped with caramelized onions and blue cheese.thought it was a weird combination but decided to try it anyway but added the sauteed mushrooms with some of the New York style chips on the side.the bartender quickly informed me that even though it is on the Fry List, they are actually homemade potato chips.they are greasy as hell but oh, so good.the Dante was good too.

an interesting combination of flavors as the blue cheese mixes very well the sirloin, onions and the garlic.It almost overwhelms you on the 1st bite but you can't stop yourself from continuing.next time i come i wanna check out the Oregon Trail, which is basically a bison burger(another animal on my to-eat list).

another thing worth mentioning about this place is the awesome selection of booze they have.pretty much any beer you can think of is served here.if you are not worried about spending 35 bucks on a meal consisting of burgers and fries then definitely check this place out.

this thing was juicy and tasty, dripping with such flavor you could almost hear the subtle ""squeal~mooo"" with each delicious bite. its like a yummy little piggy and a juicy little cow were wrestling around inside my mouth! (try to get that image out of your brain). the crispy onion strings served perfectly complement the juicy, and the gouda not only balanced the kick of all that bacon, but brought it all together in a gooey-cheezy blanket of goodness.

I don't mind paying upwards of $17 for a hamburger, if the food and the service are commensurate with that sort of pricing.  The food here isn't bad, but I don't think it's worth what they charge for it, and the service wasn't commensurate with the pricing either.  With the exception of the hostess, everyone seemed to try to do a good job, but didn't know how.  The word clumsy comes to mind.  

The hostess wasn't very welcoming at all.  Princess, I don't need my ass kissed, but bear in mind a customer's first impression of the place comes from you. 

We were seated at a tiny little table, with scarcely enough room for plates and drinks.  The furniture and decor had a cheap look, and felt very much like a fast food place.  I can't recall siting in an more uncomfortable seat than at this place.  It seemed designed to encourage you to eat and leave as quickly as possible.   Come to think of it, I wasn't able to discern any connection whatsoever between the layout and the decor of the place and what was being served.  My hunch is the previous occupant of the space was an ice cream/gelato shop or something similar.   

After we were seated, the whole meal felt rushed.   

Our server started by offering only soft drinks, but the place serves beer and wine, too.  The meal seemed to be going downhill from the outset, so I ordered a Diet Pepsi to keep it simple.  

When I didn't respond quickly enough for the server after he took my buddy's food order, the server decided he would put my buddy's order in and come back.  Mind you, the place was half empty.  

Midway through the meal, another dude, with his arm in my face and his hand on my Diet Pepsi, says, ""can I get this from you?""  Well, now that your forearm is in my face and your hand is on it, you might as well.  

The entire meal was a series of poorly timed interruptions.  For example, how about giving me a chance to try the food before you ask me the perfunctory, ""how is everything?""  And how about not asking that question when I am lifting the overpriced hamburger to my mouth to take a bite of it?

Bathroom was fucking nasty! How about someone clean it?! Made me feel like I stepped into a middle-of-no-where bathroom...
Crowd was low class! 
Food was HORRIBLE! 


The worst burger I've ever had in my life. I requested it with a side of salad, instead of the bun; probably should have just had the bun so it hides the disgusting food and presented me from getting lifeless salad.

Hey McDonald has burgers for a dollar or whatever, what I got here was $15 so I expect this burger to be 15 times better than of McDonald's!!! 
Salad was dry and lifeless. No presentation to it, I could have cut that too; that's how immature it looked.
The carrots inside had gone bad n I threw them out of my plate. 
The meat was just dry! I felt like I was eating rubber plastic. I stopped eating a few times but had to suck it up bc we had to get to things n didn't have time to talk to the manager and hear apologies. I mean food sucks. Nothing to be sorry about! 


I asked for olive oil n vinegar, the bottles were soooooo greasy, I just stopped what I was doing to wash my hands; then I saw that nasty bathroom again.

We both loved the sweet potatoe chips though I was undecided if I liked the caramel cinnamon dip that came with it... made it too much like dessert for me. The mac and cheese was super good too. Perfect crunch and perfect flavoring.  It was a nice compliment to our burgers. 
I got the tahitian vanilla shake and man I have to say that it was the best shake I had ever had... even though it was vanilla it had loads of flavor and was just so great though the waitress did kind of forget about it for a little but I will let it slide because it was so good.

We had a group of 7 girls come in to celebrate a bachelorette party.  It was not super crowded, and we were seated immediately.  None of us quite knew what we wanted, and we knew we didn't want to stuff our faces.  The waiter did not care that we all wanted to share our meals and order kids meals (age 12 and under).  Nor did he care we all walked in with our own drinks and didn't order new drinks.  He was quite possibly the most friendly, outgoing, make your day better waiter that you could ask for.  After our meals, the waiter brought the manager over to meet the bride, who then gave us shots on the house.  You really can't ask for a more personal touch than that.

I had a kids meal burger, although it's plain, you can add on what ever toppings you want.  We ordered all of the different fries for the table, I'd say the sweet potato is my favorite.",pNPnTu7iWPJ_huyFO7UUJw,2,1,5,wCiMM60v6q7GX277ELx7UA

But...I love burgers, you kinda broke my heart! You definitely didn't show me the love. I was a little disappointed and heart broken after eating here.

We were staying at the Palazzo and wanted a quick lunch to help us absorb all the alcohol from the night before.  When I saw that there was a restaurant called I love burgers, you just HAVE to try it right?

First off, did any of you think it was hard finding the place? The Palazzo Hotel is seriously sometimes super hard to navigate around.  For some reason, I always have a hard time finding my way back to my room.  Everything looks so all the effing same that I can't tell the difference between being in the Palazzo hotel or Venetian. 

Finally after some time finding the place, we got seated for our lunch.  The BF ordered the Inferno and I ordered the Seoul.  I'm Korean so maybe it was a mistake ordering a ""Korean"" burger at a random joint but the burger was not very good.  The kimchi kinda tasted funny that the mix of sriracha and kimchi tasted off. The BFs Inferno wasn't that much better either.  He was expecting his burger to be spicy but even I thought it wasn't spicy enough.

There are definitely better burger joints in the Vegas strip.  Disappointingly enough, I love burgers just doesn't make the cut.",-LhU9PZZKaP_xFa_rjo9jQ,5,4,2,sJ1lMyXOkc_9OxF1IJfRWA

Part of the reason is due to the fact that i always stay at Palazzo and the other part is because of their  Happy hour and their Bacon Bloody Mary which seems to cure my hangover from the party the day/night before.

Location:  ILB is located on the 2nd floor where all the stores are.  It is extremely hard to find and feels like a maze due to every turn looking the same.  I would highly recommend asking someone it is at.  Till this day i still get lost looking for it.

Food:  The burgers are good...nothing special or amazing for it.  Price is a little steep but your in vegas...everything is going to be on the high side.  The size of the burgers are pretty decent as it will fill u up.  The garbage fries which consist of cheese, chili, jalepeno etc was decent the first time i tried it but since then i opt for the parmesan garlic cheese fries which is really good if you like garlic and cheese.

Drinks:  The thing i love most about this place is their happy hour.  However, you have to be at the bar to get this pricing.  The drinks are strong and very good.

1330358,2013-12-20,0,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"Although I thought the burger was a 4 star burger it was priced like a 5 star burger ($16). Garbage Fries, 4 stars, $9. They had a decent selection of craft beer, although not special enough to make it a destination for someone looking for craft beer.

The Good:
BBQ burger: (American cheese, bacon, barbeque sauce, lettuce, tomato and onion strings) I did enjoy this quite a bit but it certainly wasn't a $16 burger. The BBQ sauce had a good flavor, there was a generous helping of bacon and the burger was juicy.
   Garbage Fries: (fries with chili, jalapeños, green onion, cilantro, black olives and aged cheddar cheese sauce) This is exactly the gooey, greasy, kinda mess it sounds like, but it's also pretty damn tasty! 

The Bad:
The service at the bar definitely left something to be desired. I finished my first beer with my fries and wasn't asked if I wanted another until my burger arrived 10 minutes later, even though the bar tenders were not busy and kept walking past me. After I finished my burger and beer I sat watching the game on the TV, again they never asked if I'd like another beer. If they had been running around, working their butts off that would have been one thing but they were just absently wandering around B.S. ing with each other.

The Indifferent:
For a burger joint they have a nice selection of craft beer. It's good enough if you're there for a burger but if you are looking for a selection that contains unusual, limited release, or hard to find seasonal's don't bother stopping here.

I could have easily given them 4 stars for the food but they lost one for the service and another for charging for a 5 star burger but only delivering a 3 1/2 or 4 star burger.",maeTOPoDpldg7ltkDmOVaA,1,0,2,H7B0rxiwuHCeu_YuZC9Lbw

Staying at the Palazzo, the family and I wanted to grab a quick burger before catching a show. Being pretty much in the hotel ""I love burgers"" seemed a great place to try.  When we were seated by the hostess we were put in a group of tables that we didn't like (and didn't ask for).  When we asked to move, we were told that the other sections were shut down until later.  After seeing that another group of patrons were sat where we requested, we asked our server and were moved (strange). Things started well with a friendly waitress that explained the menu... So we ordered a few burgers and the""Garbage Fries"".  We received our food fairly quickly and then were left to eat.....for a really long time. Having a few issues with my plate (burger undercooked - raw in the middle and a dried out pickle), I waited patiently for my waitress to return.  After waiting 15 min. and watching my family finish half if their meal, I called out to another passing employee to send my server over.  My server came and with measured contempt listened to me and then... without a word took my plate and left (really strange).  She did return relatively soon with a replacement and everything was made right but it was a weird vibe (like she was barely tolerating me). Honestly, I was really trying to be nice about it.  The problem is this. When you charge $17 for a burger it better be perfect. Although the food was very good, I think I just had a bad experience. My family seemed to really like the food so almost everyone was happy.  Then came the bill....  3 Burgers and one shared order of fries... $78.00. No joke. With tip that makes a quick lunch for 3 here almost $100. Just too expensive for the product. The food is pretty good but, the odd service issues and the astronomical prices make it a poor value.

While the ambiance of this place is pretty nice- bar along the one wall serving plenty of craft beers and pouring a fine drink, and blond wood accents and tables in the middle- the food is just okay and for $23 for a burger and fries- I was expecting a lot more. 

I sat at the bar cuz this place was hopping. The line was out the door and the ""To Go"" window up front had people 5 deep (one guy told me it was going to e 30 minutes for to go orders so know that this is not ""fast food"") I ordered a Pepsi (watered down- poor ratio of syrup to water and at $3.25 I expected perfection) and began to look at the menu. 

Plenty of burgers made out of everything from beef to turkey to tuna to buffalo. There are 5 or 6 kinds of fries from shoestring to potato wedges served with ONE sauce (you pay extra if you want more than one). I went with the red pepper aioli which was pretty good. 

The problem? They don't ask how you want your burger cooked. So I said , Can I have mine medium?""- and the guy said, ""Okay"". Imagine my surprise when it came out med rare and when I questioned it- the server told me the chef prefers to serve it that way. What? I didn't send it back but I was a little worried as according to my server- the meat comes in whole and they grind it at the location and hand form the patties. Too many chances to have something go wrong with fresh ground beef to eat it undercooked, but that's just me (too many food safety classes, I guess) 

The burger came with mayo already on the bun (wish I had been told that too) with lettuce, tomato, red onion and I paid extra ($2) for a slice of cheese. It was a hearty ""bar "" type burger with a soft brioche bun but nothing really stood out. I could have had an Angus burger at McDonald's for half the price and more toppings (like a pickle). 

As for the fries- I went with the ""baked potato fries"" which were really just fat wedge fries. They came in a cute bowl and were hot, hot, hot! But even the red pepper ailoi sauce couldn't jazz them up enough. 

This place has a ton of potential but it needs to get through it's growing pains and figure out what makes these new ""burger bars"" successful. It's friendly service, food cooked the way a customer wants it and no long waits. For me? If I'm going to splurge my day's calories on a burger and fries- it had better be worth it.

Like any self-respecting modern hamburger place, they have several exotic burger options, as well as many different beers on tap.

Although things can get a bit pricey, they do have a great happy hour with half-price appetizers and deals on drinks (which I enjoyed on more than one occasion during my stay).  If you order a large beer, you can bring the cup back later for a $5 discount on the next beer.

1. Spikes milkshakes. That's right, spiked milkshakes. Or double spiked. Either way, the oreo one was delicious. The booze complimented the milkshake excellently. 

2. Fried pickles. But these aren't your average fried pickles...they are tempura fried pickles. Oh dear lord, they were absolutely outstanding. They were made possible by Tim, their resident bartender/server/chef/all-around awesome guy. 

3. They really know their way around bacon.

4. They have a really large selection of burgers and delicious appetizers. If your not adventurous enough to try the friend pickles (your loss), do NOT ignore the mozzarella sticks. 

If you're in Vegas preparing for a crazy night, or recovering from one, this is the place to go. I can vouch for the ""I Heart Bacon and Eggs Burger,"" simply because I do, in fact, heart bacon, eggs and burgers.

My husband and I split an I love bacon burger and ordered mac & cheese bites and fried pickles for the table.  The mac & cheese bites were the best I've ever had. I was glad that the burgers don't come with fries so I could indulge in these and not feel as guilty!  The fried pickles were really good too.  They were cut thin and fried.  Many places fry the spears and it's like an explosion of hot liquid when you bit into the pickles.  This place has it just right.

The burger was really tasty.  They are thick patties and quite a decent size so if you don't want to feel too full I'd recommend splitting the burger like my husband and I did.

I Love Burgers looked decent and expresses a sentiment that I feel, so we opted to go there. It was fairly busy when we were there, but we were seated right away so it wasn't terrible.

Service was excellent all around. I can't remember our waitress' name, but she was great and gave many good recommendations when we told her it was our first time at their restaurant. I saw that they had spiked shakes and I knew we had to get one. We went with the Twisted Caramel Corn and it was spectacular. Our waitress said they were a pretty good size, so we decided to split it and they even put it in separate glasses for us, which was nice.

I opted for the Wagyu Kobe beef burger, which was amazing. It was super juicy and rich and just everything that I expected it to be. Yes, it was a $25 hamburger but it was worth it. And, even though my stomach was stretched to capacity, you're damn right I ate every bit of it. My boyfriend got the Oregon Trail which was a buffalo burger and he was raving about that as well. We split an order of the Parmesan Garlic fries, and those were super delicious too.

It was definitely kind of pricey for what you actually get, I think we ended up paying about $75 after tax and tip but the spiked shakes were kind of on the pricey side. So if you don't get one of those, I would say $50 for two people could easily be achieved.

The burger was excellent. It was like biting into a soft, meaty pillow!  The fries were excellent. Just enough sweetness and saltiness. FINALLY, my shake shows up! Just in time to get my check, because I know how long it takes to get from The Venetian to the airport...

Food was good! I did the Inferno Burger with a black bean patty (skip the warm lettuce) and add onion strings. It was yummy, good kick of spice and the patty was charred to perfection, just enough to crispiness.
My boyfriend fell in love with the bacon & eggs sliders. He called the mini quail eggs cute- and devoured them. My BFF had the Dante with a turkey patty and loved it- especially the blue cheese.
Bad news though!!
Service was bad, bad, bad. They need to look at their staffing plans- our server was swamped with too many tables! She was filling drink orders, ringing up checks and helping at least 6 tables; meanwhile, 2 hosts were standing around doing nothing. At least 4 guys were bussing tables and done, standing around with nothing to do. There were at least 4 bartenders, yet they were all standing together taking. My drink never came, and we had no utensils while our food sat at our table.
The saving grace was how nice and apologetic our server was!",kny4xHwAIWuBAr5NfPvAhQ,1,1,2,XcS9ww7skn1D7mF6hyNJRg

I ha the Oregon Trail Burger, a buffalo pattay with the normal fixin's and an aioli sauce that I couldn't even taste. It was of course pricey because we were on the Strip and it was buffalo.

We also got garbage fries, ground beef, black olices, sour cream, jalapenos, onions, they were alright too, but nothing to write home about.

I had the Standard burger (medium well) with string fries and a spiked oreo cookie shake. Kris had the Sirloin burger and orange-sticle spiked milkshake.

My sisters and I stopped by I Love Burgers at the Shoppes at the Palazzo and decided to share everything that we ordered. I got the BBQ Burger and I really enjoyed the great taste of the barbeque sauce, cheese, bacon, and onion ring combination. One of my sisters tried the I Love Bacon Burger (I had to have a bite because I truly love bacon) and I was surprised at how you could taste the bacon in the burger and the how much the crispy onion straws added to the overall quality of the burger. I definitely recommend this because honestly who doesn't love bacon and it will satisfy any appetite. My other sister got the Chicken Caesar Salad and LOVED it. The dressing was perfect, I think it is house-made and it had a little extra something that made it taste different than other Caesar salads that I have had before. 

We also ordered sweet potato fries and onions. When I saw sweet potato fries on the menu I immediately knew that I had to get them and they didn't disappoint! They were crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. The onion rings were sooo good! The sauce that came with it which tasted like a 1000 island sauce with a kick was complimented them wonderfully!

My sister ordered the Very Spiked Strawberry shake. At first, I was skeptical how a milkshake would taste good with some vodka in it but I shortly changed my mind as it was the BEST shake I have ever had. And even with the alcohol in the shake, I could barely taste it which made it that much better.

I love Burgers is in the restaurant and shopping area within the Palazzo / Venetian complex.  It looks like a diner and feels like a diner, but you won't pay like a diner - you'll pay much much more. 

First off, what did I like?  Nom Noms - fried pieces of mac and cheese.  They also do a nice selection of beers, including a Chimay Trappist White, which might be my favorite beer, and it goes well with fried food.  These golden nuggets of awesome were delicious, and definitely turning up for.

Unfortunately, that is the only thing good about it.  The burgers were completely tasteless.  I opted for the ""I love bacon"" burger - which I was thinking, given the amount of bacon on and supposedly in it, that it might actually taste good.  It didn't taste good or bad - there was no taste to it.  Really bad.  The sweet potato fries were flat and they didn't come with anything to dip them into.  This was really disappointing.

Service was bad as well.  The burgers came out before the appetizer, the bar screwed up, and we couldn't get the attention of our waitress when we needed her.

After an afternoon of shopping, I decided to grab a quick bite - and I was craving a burger. So why not try somewhere new? Ugh. I so should have just gone across the street and gone to Stripburger or even BLT Burger. It wouldn't have cost me as much and I would have been FAR more satisfied.

I was tempted to go with the I Love Bacon burger, but the bad reviews of it led me to choose the Dante burger instead (bleu cheese, carmelized onions, etc.).

Everything is a la carte - so fries or any sides are not included. I wanted to try the fries, but the bartender warned me that the serving size was huge, so I didn't bother.

When the burger arrived, it was...uninteresting. Just a burger on a plate with a side of lettuce and tomato. I ordered it medium, but saw only gray and no pink. And juiciness...forget about it. The bleu cheese was all melty, which can be a good thing, but it just tasted off. The whole thing was just bleh. Really BLEH. I couldn't even finish it, even though I was famished.

And to make things worse, I could start to feel my stomach churning. Immediately after paying my $20+ for just one burger and one beer, I made a serious beeline for the restroom. Ick, ick, ick.

Why pay so much for such an awful burger when such a great bleu cheeseburger can be found almost literally across the street for under $10? And I can get cheese fries and an awesome cocktail with it too, and not spend as much.

Ordered medium, it still ran red - nicely seared on the outside and bloody in the middle. My kinda burger.

Skin-on shoestring fries coulda been a little crisper, but with a shake or two of seasoned salt, they did the trick. I ate at the counter/bar - service was quick, attentive, and friendly. In this place, who could ask for more?

Still, a $14 burger's a bit much no matter how much it moos when you bite it. But, for a $14 burger, it was a pretty damn good $14 burger. When you want a beer and some ground beef with the hair singed off it, this is your spot.

To start with, it took the waitress like 10-15 minutes to even get to us to take the drink order. The drinks were brought to us by a different person, so it was another 10-15 before we could even make our order. 

One of the people in our group ordered a chocolate shake which was brought to us so long after it was made that it was half-melted. Some of the food brought to us had also started to cool down, and they seemed to ignore my friend's order of ""no cheese"" on his burger. 

Also, one of the ways I judge service at a place is by seeing if I get to the point where it took them so long to replace my water that I need to start chewing on the ice. Like 20 minutes after I got to this point, the hostess (the one who seats you) and not the waitress finally came and refilled our waters. 

The burgers were, precisely as a different reviewer wrote, average. They're better than many fast food places, but not the quality I'd expect from a place that charges $12-25 for just a burger entree. Honestly, the food is one of the few things saving this place from a one star review. I am, in fact, quite full after eating there, and I did pay a relatively cheap fare for Vegas Strip food. 

Warning! The Parmesan Garlic fries are actually just their fries with Parmesan flakes and garlic sprinkled over them. I expected something nice, akin to the Counter in CA, where there is high quality cheese melted on and I eat them with pleasure every time. That's not what these are. 

To put a nice bow on the whole deal, the waitress took the 20% coupon we had from the book that came with our room and failed to ring it up at first, thus causing the person carding the bill to need to go void the transaction and have them re-ring it up.

We checked into the Palazzo early and wanted to grab something to eat while we waited for our room to be ready. The girl at the front desk said the I love Burgers was now serving breakfast, so we headed on over. 

The restaurant was maybe 1/3 full. Not at all crowded with many empty tables, but for some reason it took them 10 minuts to find a table for our party of 4. We should have left then, but we were all tired from early am flights and we just wanted to sit down. After another 10 minute wait, this time to order, the waitress showed up. Two of us ordered coffee and the other 2 ordered $10 bloody marys. They were curious to see what a $10 bloody mary loohed like. In the description there was a promise of a piece of applewood smoked bacon in the glass. We tried to order our food at the same time, but it turns out the drinks waitress cannot take the food order, so that meant another 5 minutes waiting for the food waitress. We all ordered food and then sat for 20 minutes with neither food or drink. Incredibly, our food came before our drinks arrived. The food was ok. My husband ordered an egg white omlet and was served what was clearly not an egg white omlet, but otherwise our order was correct. I was splitting an oder of the breakfast sliders with the or woman in our party. They were good, though not warm. I suspect they were prepared for the group sitting behind us who walked out before the food came. Our drinks were finally served 10 minutes later. The two bloody marys did not come close to justifying $10 a piece. It was just bloody mary mix poured over ice- no garnishes. My husband walked over to the waitress to point out that the bacon was missing. Instead of taking the drinks away and fixing them, she brought over a plate with 2 pieces of bacon on it. She also commented that she didn't bring the olives that should have come in them and asked if we wanted them. My husband declined, but the woman in our group that ordered the drink said that she would like the olives. She got a death stare from the waitress and the olives never came. 

I can report that they were fast with one part of their service - the check came out within a few minutes of the food, in fact, before we were even done eating. This restaurant has a long way to go. If you are located in a Las Vegas hotel, I don't think there is ever an excuse for poor service. By the time you open up a business on the Strip, you should have all parts of your business pulled together and working correctly.

2090195,2015-07-17,1,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"We were staying at the Palazzo and wanted a bite to eat for Breakfast, so we stumbled upon I Love Burgers inside the Restaurant Row that is shared by The Palazzo and its sister property, The Venetian.

I will preface this review by saying that we probably didn't come to this establishment for the right type of meal -- I say that because the name obviously implies Burgers, so right off the bat, you should know it's not likely a good place for breakfast. Yes, they do have a breakfast menu, but it's not their specialty. Either way it goes, it was off the beaten path, we were hungry, and stumbled upon it, and thus, here is the review.

It was around 9am and we wanted to put something in our stomachs prior to getting our day started, and while the Grand Lux Cafe is always available, we wanted something different. 

The breakfast menu isn't extensive, and is but half a page long. Again, understandable, as this place isn't geared towards the morning crowd, but cool of them to offer breakfast being in the Palazzo enclave.

The place is very unassuming in the early hours of the day, with barely a patron in sight. They seem like they have far too much of waiter staff, and not enough cooks. On the one morning I went with my parents (they kept going back LOL), there were only 3 other patrons in the establishment, yet it took them forever to push orders out. They had like 5 waiters and what appeared like 1 cook. 

I'm going to assume that since it was a holiday weekend (4th of July), that the manager booked extra waiters, expecting more traffic through the early hours of the day. Such wasn't the case.

On this particular morning, nothing on their breakfast menu looked enticing, but being that we were already in there, I figured to go with a sausage burrito and OJ. I ordered my burrito dry -- Sorry, I don't like sour cream and cheese/salsa all over a burrito for breakfast. Someone else in our party had an order of 2 eggs sunny side up and two others had omelets and the other had the 'On the Border' skillet. 

It took them exactly 24 minutes to cook my breakfast burrito, only for them to get it wrong (they flooded my burrito with the sour cream and salsa, when I specifically said I wanted it dry). Fortunately, it took them only 5 minutes more (Half hour total) to bring out a new one. To me, the burrito was super bland. The eggs had no taste, the sausage was without flavoring, the cheese was the only thing holding this thing together as far as a decent breakfast. I knew after the first bite that I had made a mistake coming to this place for breakfast.

Others in our party were pleased with their breakfast, and they kept coming back to this place the rest of our stay, me, not so much. One thing that is cool is, if you keep your receipt and come back the next day, they give you 25% off your order -- These folks I was with kept coming every day for breakfast, and by the 3rd day they didn't need a receipt anymore, as the morning staff recognized them and kept giving them 25% off their orders the rest of the stay.

I personally wouldn't come back to this place, unless it was the only option available again.",Si6CDh3AIT5hrsqYFebLLw,0,1,3,ZfIqZbmrMRTArdZH2ceN8A

He was polite and quick and apologized when my food took a little bit longer than expected due to a large ticket in front of me.  Little did he know I could still be waiting in line at the other place.
The food was great, the restaurant immaculate and you can tell the people working there genuinely enjoy their job.  It felt like a small-town diner but I was in the middle of the Vegas Strip...not easy to pull that off.
Bottom Line: $27 with tip for a very ample breakfast that I am currently digesting.

The service was not what we expected to be ""Vegas Caliber"". Instead, I believe we were served based on our appearance. I walked in there in really plain clothes, and haven't showered yet since I was so hungry getting off of our flight. I asked what the popular choice was, and she gave me ""the look"", ""the eyeroll"", and then ""the sigh"" before she replied in a tone where answering my request was going to take another important minute away from her life. After we had ordered, I had hoped the food would be better than the service. Wrong.
The food was the same as something you would expect from Burger King. I think we would have gotten better service there as well. I will not give them one star for although my experience there was not great, the food was not sloppy, looked halfway decent, and the place was clean; cleaner than Burger King...
Unfortunately, I will never return to that place for I had learned my lesson: you get what you pay for; meaning the service should equal how much you pay for the meal.

Parking was fine since it was in a hotel. Either self park or valet (free). Place was located in the Palazzo...kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the hotel. Anyways, we were seated right away which was a plus! The thing was, I swear...our waitress was on coke or something. She kept mumbling weird statements which i did not understand and she just talked too fast for me. Shocking since Im from New York and we're known for talking really fast. But anyways, drinks came out ok. But the food...WTF?!?!? It was a 45 minute wait!!! I was with 2 of my uncles and they got burgers and I got a drilled chicken burger! It does not take 45 minutes to grill a damn piece of chicken!!!! And the food came out messed up (except for mine :-D). One of my uncles' burgers was cooked way to well done. It was basically cooked to a charcoal. My other uncle's burger had mayo on it when he said no mayo and didn't have tomatoes when he asked for tomatoes. WTF?!?!? Oh yea, my chicken was cold. We were told that the fries would be beefy, but no...they were super thin...like chips. Total disappointment. You know what really bugged the crap out of me.....fries didn't come with the meal?!?!??! WOAH! Crazy...and the fries (more like chips) sucked big time. Burgers were totally overpriced. I got the gilled chicken burger which was $10 but since i wanted avocados with it, it was an extra $2. Wackness....I will never recommend this place to anyone. I actually warn you people not to go there. Oh yea, one of my uncles got a milkshake.

2464930,2016-06-27,1,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"This place honest to God gave me diarrhea right after eating there, their service is inconsistent, and their manager is a giant asshole so you can assure that this place will not improve anytime soon. 
 
I will never eat at this location ever again. They have another location in Town Square that my friends say is amazing, but do yourself a favor and don't eat at their Palazzo location. I honestly regret choosing this place over In N Out. 

I work in the Palazzo, so I used to eat here frequently because their menu seems like it'd be pretty good and it's the closest restaurant to where I work, but every time I've been there I was disappointed and was given really bad service. I work at a sushi restaurant and the way they treat their customers is kind of appalling to me. I can't see how they can treat anyone the way they do, let alone do it at work. I would definitely get written up or fired from the restaurant I worked at if I acted how some of them do towards customers. 

Recently my brother and I ordered garbage fries to go and they forgot to put our order in for 30 minutes. Not the best customer service during that experience, but the shift manager paid for our food so I respected and appreciated that, and said I'd go back there and continue to try more of their food. 

BAD DECISION. I come back a week later to order some food to go before I headed to work which was pretty much just around the corner. I had always ordered sides from there, so I was taking my time with the burger menu because I never ordered from it before. The manager (a different guy from the previous experience. I was told he was their general manager. He was in a red shirt and everyone else was in grey, seemed to be of Asian descent, black hair, tattoos) seemed annoyed that I was struggling to pick what I wanted on my burger rather than helping me out with the menu a little after I straight up told him I've never had a burger from them before. I even apologized because I didn't want to give him a hard time and said ""I'm sorry if I'm being difficult, I just haven't eaten anything all day"". He doesn't write down my order and goes to put it in. He comes back, I give him my card, and he sets it down, and leaves it unattended by their computer while he goes off to bus a bunch of tables instead of completing my transaction and giving me my card back. He then disappears in the back so I tell another server to let the manager know that I'll be back for my card, but I had to rush to work to clock in really quickly. 

I come back and the manager is still no where to be found, my card just sitting unattended on top of their computer, out in the open, so I ask a server, ""I know my food wouldn't be done yet but could I get my card back because it makes me a little uncomfortable that it's just sitting there?"" He completely understood and got my card back to me happily, apologetically, and politely. 

I go grab some coffee and then come back for my order. The manager drops off my bag of food, doesn't review what's inside, doesn't say anything, no ""here you go"" or ""enjoy"" or ""have a nice night"" and continued to walk off. I'm quickly trying to check the bag and then try to stop him to ask if there's any ranch in the bag, because I didn't see any and I specifically asked for some when he took my order. He kept walking and didn't stop so I thought he must not have heard me so I spoke up and said, ""excuse me is there ranch in the bag?"" He doesn't turn around, and practically barks ""HOLD ON!"" at me. The server who returned my card back to me witnessed the whole thing. I asked him what that guy's problem was and he just shook his head and said he was sorry and he didn't know. (I would later find out the silence was because it was his manager. I didn't know this until after this experience). I told the guy straight up that the way the manager was acting was rude and that I understood I was in a rush, but I work in the restaurant industry and it shouldn't have been hard for them to accommodate me. After all, the restaurant was near empty. I even explained to him about the previous time I was there that they forgot to put in my order for 30 minutes and he looked shocked. 

The manager comes back with my ranch and slams it down in my bag and storms off. He does this right in front of the other server. I could not believe him. I got back to work to find my burger wasn't even cooked all the way through and the cheese for my tots was this luke warm, pale yellow, watery sauce that came in a a to go cup. My burger was super greasy, the bun was soggy, and it was practically falling apart as I ate it. About 20 minutes after I ate, I was running to the bathroom. It gave me diarrhea. And I know it was the food because like I said before, that was my first and only meal of the day and it was 5 in the afternoon. 

Moral of the story: this place sucks and you shouldn't eat here unless you want to be pissed off and have a stomachache.",eLJNRoq32BxFonQivdxOuw,2,0,1,ZSi2_sADAwYNdcttX-OXhQ

When comparing I Love Burgers to other gourmet burger joints, it falls short.

My personal binge was a fuel-up after a long run - so I dove in to the Oregon Trail (moist, delicious bison and cheddar burger), a big ol' serving of dill pickle fries with house dipping sauce, half of a friend's order of baked potato wedge fries with blue cheese sauce (A MUST!!!), and my very own Blueberry Panshake - exactly what you think it is, a blueberry shake made with maple syrup and vanilla.

While the food at I Love Burgers is pretty good, I am not sure it is totally worth the price.  I got the big $17 Oregon Trail burger.

The dining room is large with plenty of seating and lots of TVs to watch the games on. The menu is not overwhelming so you should not spend an hour trying to make a decision on what to eat (aka, that's you my dear wife).  For our appetizer we went with Mac and Cheese Nuggets. Little gems of Mac and Cheese breaded, fried and topped with shredded Parmesan are served with a side of spicy cheese sauce, because what else would be served with cheese but more cheese ? We finished these off pretty quickly and easily.  We could talk about my wife Simone's choice for an entree but I'm going to be honest, I don't want to. It was basically Eggplant Parmesan in a hamburger bun. Yes it was good, but why you would order a vegetarian burger at a place the specializes in cooking MEAT Hamburgers is beyond me.

I had the Caprese Burger, he had the one with buffalo meat, the one that's name escapes me right now.  My burger was dried out a little and just kind of bland.  I thought maybe it needed some more balsamic or seasoning or something.  I had a couple bites and moved on.

I had a bite of his burger, and it was decent, but I was already feeling kind of ""bleh"" about the joint so I didn't get overly excited.

The fried dill pickles we started with were pretty grand.  The natural cut french fries were pretty solid as well.  I had a sip of his chocolate shake and instantly went into a diabetes coma - SO SWEET!

The service was just OK.  I wasn't fond of our server - she lingered wayyyyy too long tableside when checking on us.  May be just a personal thing but it was annoying.

All in all, I wouldn't be whining too much - except our tab, with tip, was just over $60.  Honestly, I would've been happier at In N Out or McDonald's.  Two stars for most everything; one extra for the pickles.",xL4EOIKW6ZRM06T1lMjb_w,0,0,3,EQKNEWs5Bcmpw2QIzD5sDQ

The menu is loaded with options for all sorts of picky eaters, and they even modified one of their menu items to make scrambled eggs EXACTLY the way I like them. All the produce seems super fresh, and everything is beyond flavorful.

I was contacted by someone at I LOVE BURGERS and they apologized and to me that says a lot when a business reaches out to you and acknowledges their mistake and promises to make it right and for that reason I have upgraded my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars.

I will give them a shot next time I am in Vegas and hopefully they do it right this time.

We were getting ready to leave Vegas and we wanted to find something quick and boy did we make a mistake choosing this restaurant.  The first sign and the reason we should have left immediately was when the hostess told us that we would have to wait 15 minutes before we could order, but we still decided to give this restaurant a chance.

Problems:

1. Took 30 minutes to give me my drink
2. Took 60 minutes to give us our fries
3. Took 90 minutes for them to give us our burgers and not everyone got theirs and orders were messed up

What blew my mind was that they said they were not your typical IN N OUT and that their burgers were gourmet style.

Are you freaking kidding me????

Food finally came out and five of the eight in our group got our burgers and unfortunately I was the only person that actually liked my burger, while my friends had under cooked burgers.  They offered to comp us but we were not having it and just walked out.

Pros:

Chicken Burger was good
Sweet Potato Fries
Basil dressing

Cons:

Slow
Unprofessional
Unorganized
Under cooked burgers
Small grille
Wasted space in restaurant

Unfortunately, this restaurant is poorly run and they probably won't be in business long due to the fact that they are unorganized, slow and don't know what the heck they are doing.  They need to get their act together quickly or they won't be around much longer.

Tried to be as fair as possible and even gave them 2 stars when most people would give them a 1 star.",02k0y4BziRSDDLpMevowAw,3,2,3,GJbCLDUGKSvOoFpMfGtySQ

My craving for poutine was unfortunately not satisfied. I was expecting the traditional Canadian dish of a mountain of cheese curds and fries smothered with brown gravy. Instead it was a slight twist on the classic with sliced mushrooms and melted mozzarella. The pickle spears tasted good at first, but quickly became too greasy.

I enjoyed the taste and creativity of the Seoul burger. The blend of sriracha, avocado, fried egg, wasabi mayo, onion strings, and angus beef was yummy!

I didn't experience the crappy service that the other people seemed to have, which was nice!  However, I agree with the other patrons who said that the food here isn't really worth the $$.

My mom and I split the chicken sandwich, and my dad got a bacon cheeseburger, and my husband got some sort of hot-n-spicy business.  It was pretty good, but my dad's bacon burger was really good--it had bacon actually IN the meat--yum!  And he ordered it well-done, and the waitress had the foresight to mention that it would be well-done, but it would look medium because of the hue the bacon gives to the meat.

We also got a basket of fries to share amongst the table, and it was plenty.  The chicken sandwich was really good as well--very juicy and flavorful.  And the barbecue sauce I ordered on the side was delightful as well!  Very good taste to it!

The drinks we ordered were really good, too.  I had a frozen margarita that was delicious.  My husband had some yummy imported beer that he thought was good, too!

I ordered the ""Oregon Trail"" Buffalo burger with no cheese or sauce and added avocado. Delicious!!! I was reminded how much I love buffalo meat. Mmmm... buffalo meat. I ate every bite of my burger. My friend ordered the Garbage fries (which I ate quite a bit) and delicious too. 

My only problem was that I added avocado for $2 and I got 2 skimpy slices of avocado. It didn't even cover half of my patty. 

Price: The specialty burgers are a little expensive but I think to try it once for a great burger, then come eat here and shelf out the $20.

3104010,2011-05-21,0,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"Update from 5/17
Went in late on Tuesday, around 8:45 ish I think. Walked right past the hostess stand and cruised up to my spot in front of the TV's at the bar. Chatted with the bartender for a second and got right to it. I ordered the Dante and subbed the bleu cheese for a slice of cheddar. Seriously, it came in LESS than 5-6 minutes cooked medium and there were about 30+ people dining tonight, (I'm pretty sure there's a show that gets out just about that time.) 

I was amazingly surprised how fast it was. Didn't order any fries or a shake this time, but usually go with the sweet potato fries, garlic Parmesan fries, or the mozzarella sticks. Ordered one of my favorite beers, the Leinenkugel sunset wheat on tap. Friggen YUMMMY beer, has a light citrus-y taste to it. I am and always will be a repeat customer here, top notch in my opinion.  Everything was fresh, fast, and you get what you pay for here. The Dante is one of their more expensive burgers, ($15 I think) but like I said, you get what you pay for. This place is still a lot more reasonable than the celeb chef restaurants in the palazzo/venetian, where you're gonna pay 50+ just for an entree and a drink. You're paying for the name, not for the product. Excellent damn burger, oh so juicy. The caramelized onions just fall out of the burger, it's actually a little annoying how many onions there are on this thing!!!

side-note: Also got to witness the end of Dirk scoring 48 points against the OKC Thunder, that was impressive. So I started up a chat with two other guys sitting at the bar about how fun it is to watch somebody score that many points in the playoffs. Friendly people hanging at the bar, so that's fun meeting new folks.

Designed in a mode that is cool, eclectic, and visual--you are taken on a quick pace to your table.  Once seated, the menu challenge begins.  I say that because of its diversity and taking the time to decide what you really want to order.

Scanning the menu--we both made our own decisions on what to try.  My wife ordered the Heart and Seoul Burger.  It is laden with a variety of items (avocado, kimchi, onion strings, a farm fresh fried egg, and furikake-wasabi-mayo) with its ground Angus marinated in Sriracha and soy sauces.  I, always having a traditional burger desire, received their Standard Angus Burger which had lettuce, tomato, onion, and Louie sauce.  Both burgers had brioche buns with the name ""I Love Burgers"" implanted in them.  

Having been to Vancouver, and enjoyed them, we asked for Poutine Fries.  These are a delight within their own.  Golden french fries covered with brown gravy, mushrooms, and carmelized onions could have been a meal unto itself (we asked them to leave the cheese off since I am lactose intolerant).

For dessert, we had a piece of lavish chocolate fudge cake that ended our meal on a high sumptuous peak!!

Summary:  The burgers were truly a pure delight!!  My wife never once stopped eating hers and enjoyed every element of it.  Mine was one that could always be used to show how a traditional American hamburger should be cooked and created. I want to compliment their manager, Mark, for coming to check and see how things were going and our waitress, Ashley, who made sure everything was in place.

Nom Nom bites - macaroni cheese bites were lacking in flavor. Especially good cheese flavor. I say pass 
I heart Bacon - good burger with bacon in the patty, more bacon on top and onion straws. Very tasty and was a good ""safe"" choice for me. Not the best burger I've had, but decent. 
Garlic Parmesan Fries - DO NOT GET! I repeat...DO NOT GET unless you're expecting to raise your blood pressure by 100X! These were the saltiest batch of fries I've ever tasted. When I told the server they were reallyyy salty, he said it was because of the parm. Even after dusting the parm off, it was still as salty as table salt! My friend's plain fries were salty too. Someone must've spilled the salt all over the fries. Disgusting. 
Bread pudding - yuck. but I'm not a bread pudding fan to start with so you can disregard this. I just found it to be a little hard than usual. It's served with ice cream, which was the best part about this dish.

3452283,2012-12-04,1,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"So not good. So not worth $17. I know it's the Strip and I expect prices to be high, even for casual food and I'm fine with that, but if you charge $17 for a burger there's a minimum expectation that should be met. Like maybe it should be served hot. Even though my burger was served medium rare, it was so dry I had to pile on more mayo to get any flavor at all. The outside was way over-charred, the inside was a red/pink color that I've never seen in a burger. I always eat my burgers medium rare, so I know what they should look/taste like. When you cut into a medium rare burger there should be some juice - usually it's dripping down your hands. Not here - not so much as a drop, just a weird color that makes me wonder what they're adding to the meat. And it wasn't hot, barely room-temp warm. I got the I Love Bacon burger which had very little bacon or any other flavor (supposedly a ""blend"" of brisket and bacon, so maybe that's why the color was odd?). The ""crisp"" bacon described on the menu was soggy. The bacon mayo had no bacon flavor (I actually opened the burger to see if they'd even put any on). So basically I got a barely-warm, bland burger for $17. I also ordered garlic parm fries - again, barely warm, kinda chewy, they'd definitely been sitting around a while. Definitely out of a bag, not hand cut or anything that I've normally seen at high-end burger places (at least the ones who care about putting out good quality product). That was another $7 and not worth it, I only ate a few of them. McDonalds has better fries. The side of garlic mayo that came with the fries did come in handy to put on the burger. 

Here's my theory on how they make the burgers - pre-formed patties that are slightly pre-cooked. Then they stick them in the fridge. When you order, they toss them on the grill again to warm them up. That's the only thing I could think of that  would explain the temp of the burger and the overly-charred exterior. And the super-dry texture. 

I really regret not sending it all back and asking for the food to be served hot, as it should be. But I was tired and hungry and just wanted to eat and move on. Bottom line - save your money, go elsewhere. Even the Johnny Rockets in the Grand Canal Shops serves up a better burger and fries. And for less. 

I will say my server was pleasant and efficient. That's the only good thing I can say about the place.",kz4WIDTj_q5ttbvCjbUkXA,1,0,1,q1gFlwrh4UgEfNb288U_Cg

3466747,2011-01-10,1,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"Quite possibly my favorite burgers in Vegas now...  I've already gone about 5 times, and intend to go many more.  So why only 4 stars?  Well...  The service has been pretty slow at times and they've fallen flat on a few items.

So... a summary of my experiences...  

Mac and Cheese nom noms - Eat with caution!  Crisp panko breading on the outside, deep fried, and then served blistering hot.  If you're in an evil mood, you can not warn your friends and then laugh heartily while they burn their tongues on the oozing cheese!  Ho ho ho, you nom nom noob!

Mozarella Fries - Obviously the waitress had no idea how to explain these things, because I was expecting something totally different.  The short?  They're mozarella sticks.  The long?  They're REALLY GOOD, thick mozarella sticks, the marinara is wonderful, and the cheese was obviously extremely high quality.

Triple Truffle Fries - Taste like dirt!  But yummy dirt!  What would normally be called a shoestring fry (more on this next) tossed with truffle oil, and slivers of what appear to be real truffle oil.  Don't ask me what the third truffle is, I don't think anyone actually knows.  If you like truffles, this is a good choice.  

Shoestring fries - What normally passes as a shoestring fry can only sob at their own gross obesity compared to these...  We got a huge mound of these incredibly THIN fries.  They were like nothing I'd ever seen before, and really tasty....  Definite recommend.

New York Style chips - The first time I had them, they were out of this world.  Crisp, thick cut fresh potato chips.  The next time I had them, they sucked.  They were even thinner, but somehow lacked any semblance of crispness and were just soggy and cold and reminiscent of a bag of Lays that's been sitting out in the rain.  Very disappointed.  I'll try them again, but be careful.  I'll ask for well done next time.  

So on to the burgers - 

Caprese Burger - One of my two favorites...  INCREDIBLE mix of flavors from the freshly ground beef, to the thick fresh slices of melted buffalo mozarella, and thick slices of beefsteak tomato.    Add on the basil aioli and balsamic reduction...  and it's a whole range of flavours at one time.  Taking a queue from, but definitely not to be mistaken for a Caprese salad, this surprisingly refreshing burger will still sit in your stomach like a pile of bricks when you're done (not in a bad way).  It's a lot of food, and well worth the price.

Ahi burger - My second favorite, this ""burger"" is basically sushi in disguise!  Lightly seared to keep the tuna fresh and rare in the center, it packs a spicy kick AND a wasabi twist.  Loaded with tomato and lettuce on a sweet taro bun, it's just fantastic.  The only thing that could make this perfect burger even better would be a some avocado... and you can add it (for an extra $2)!  A bit pricy at $17, but despite being just fish it is just as filling as a regular burger and hey...  sushi isn't cheap either!

Dante burger - Hmm... The most disappointing of all the burgers, it still wasn't bad.  For me, I guess it lacked the ""fresh produce"" flavors.  It came without lettuce or tomato and was just too heavy for my tastes.  Caramelized onions, a big beef patty, and bleu cheese.  Great for the caveman, but I want to at least PRETEND that there's something healthy about my burger!

The food is really top notch, the burgers pricey but worthwhile, and the fries and appetizers are VERY reasonably priced.  Kick up the service a bit, and it's the best burger place ever!",5hO83i9JURqbnnGr2-ib0g,3,2,4,85SxRMLI_4kg5bJinRFgpw

It began with a hamburger patty that had chopped up bacon mixed in with the beef and was smothered in bacon mayo and a billion strips of thick-cut bacon. The only thing that wasn't full of bacon was the cheese (I think this should be remedied).

We had the truffle fries, which I thought were good but a little lacking in truffle flavor until I tried the truffle aioli, which was DELICIOUS. (I am a truffle maniac.)

No empathy, no concern at all for wasting my time and making me late from my lunch break!

Seventeen bucks for a bacon burger which came out dry with a dab of the bacon mayo that I could not even taste.

what i ate:
- fried mac and cheese nom noms (FREE): due to my trusty yelp app we got this appetizer for FREE! (yay for free!) this was definitely tasty, but seriously, how can you mess up deep fried cheesy stuff?? while very tasty, i couldnt bring myself to have more than two. sigh, i really should have stopped at the first piece, but i couldnt help myself, i was just too hungry. 
- wagyu kobe burger: tasty, but it was not worth the price! seriously, opt for one of the other burgers. don't be swayed by the idea of a having a ""wagyu kobe"" burger! have that at your local steakhouse where the price will be justifiable. also, without the sauce (comes on the side), the burger isnt that amazing. the sad part about it is that the truffle flavor gets overpower and drowned out by the sauce, but without the sauce the burger is pretty unremarkable. so, to keep yourself from being caught in this delimna just order something else!
- dante burger: sauteed mushrooms, om nom nom. the blue cheese was the perfect pungent partner to the savory mushrooms. i loved eating this
- parm garlic fries: very tasty and garlicy. the parm gave it a nice salty bite. nice size to share
- bloody mary: spicy, peppery, delightful.

pros:
- loud fun atmosphere. very sports bar themed
- large space, so plenty of room for large parties or small
- dante burger was very tasty, as were the fries
- there wasnt much of a wait when we strolled in at lunch time on a sunday afternoon. 

cons:
- service: she was there, and then she wasnt. for a very long time. we ordered drinks, and boom, they were the LAST things that arrived. stranger still was that the manager (i think she was the manager) brought one drink out, and then stopped by again towards the end of the meal to ask about my drink. while she got my drink, she didnt apologize, didnt comp us, didnt say anything! also, my friend ordered a dirty martini that was supposed to come out with olives stuffed with blue cheese. when he pointed out they were just regular olives, she just sent over a ramekin of blue cheese. w t f ???

The Fried Pickles were *meh*, nothing to really speak of....the Breading was bland & lacked flavor.

The Fried Mac 'n Cheese was awesome.  If I could make these at home, I'd make a whole bowl of them and eat them while watching a game.  

The Bacon BBQ Burger was pretty good.....$16 good?  Nah, but it was good.  I understand that it's the Strip and prices would be high, but for $16 at a place called ""I Love Burgers"", I was expecting to be blown away.  That said, I'll come back again and will try a few more menu items, it's that interesting to me.

We dined at the bar and the service was really good.

The fried mac and cheese are these bits of fried squares of creamy goodness.  Also had the fried pickles.  Wasn't to excited about these.  They sliced the pickles lengthwise and the batter was greasy and not much flavor.  My co-workers like their burgers.  There were 6 of us so I don't remember what they ordered.  I got the Loco Moco and was disappointed.  I ordered it medium rare.  The burger was cooked on too high of heat too fast cause the edges were hard and dry and only a tiny piece was medium rare.  The rice... there bunch of crunchy pieces... yah.... hard rice... not good....  My coworker had the red velvet cheese cake.  There was the crust,  then there is a layer of red velvet cake and then cheese cake on top.  He really liked it.  I got the banana fosters cheese cake.  Is it worth the calories?

My friends and I were wandering through the mall around 10:45 in the evening and smelled the burger aroma from way down the hallway.  We thought we'd grab a burger since they smelled so good.  The restaurant was happy to seat us, but we noticed that the kitchen staff was cleaning up the grills.  We discovered that they were closing in a few minutes so we decided to not be the douchey people that come in at closing time and keep everyone way late.  

We returned the next evening at an appropriate dinner time and ordered some food.  We started off with an order of the garbage fries.  This is a plate of fries drenched in buffalo chili, jalapenos, green onion, cilantro, olives and cheese sauce.  I'm not the biggest fan of olives or jalapenos so I picked them off my portion.  The fries were decent and hit the spot because I was starving.

I always order a plain jane burger at burger places because I use that to judge whether I like the burgers there or not.  Typically the fancy burgers mask the taste of the actual meat with all the extra hoopla going on.  I ordered the Standard (lettuce, tomatoes, onion) with American cheese.  I have to say that the burger was mediocre at best.  The beef itself had not flavor at all.  I'm not sure that they put any seasoning on it.  It was supposed to arrive medium but this was cooked closer to well done.

I also got an order of the parmesan garlic fries.  These were pretty tasty until you got to the bottom 1/3 of the fries and discover that the remaining fries are completely drenched in grease.

My husband wanted to see inside Pallazzo since he's never been. While walking around we decided to stop in I Love Burgers for a quick bite. This would be our first meal of the day. The restaurant was clean and had a quirky style. It wasn't busy so we were seated right away. Our waitress was really nice and delightful. I ordered a medium (as opposed to medium rare) Dante Burger with additional avocados and water. My husband ordered a mushroom burger with onion rings and a Bloody Mary. It took about 10 minutes for the burgers to arrive. For the price of a $15 burger, I expected more. Although it was gourmet, I've had much better. My husband was almost done with his burger when I reminded him that his Bloody Mary hadn't arrived. He then reminded the waitress who had it brought over right away. So the burgers were okay, nothing to rave about. Our bill came out to $38 and I didn't even get a drink. But that's Vegas for ya! So here's the kicker, 3 hours later, I wasn't feeling well. My body started aching and I had a migraine. These symptoms I'm familiar with whenever I've had food poisoning. I knew it was because of the burger since I had nothing else to eat that day. I returned to my hotel room and vomited. I was then bed-ridden for the rest of the night but couldn't sleep due to muscle aches. The next day, I felt better but my neck muscles were still sore and it lasted for a week.

Loco moco cost $14 for not a lot of food and the taste wasn't really worth the price tag either.

Everything on the loco moco tasted good EXCEPT for the burger patty; Considering this is a burger place, that was pretty disappointing.

Great stop for some decent priced hamburgers in VEGAS!

I ordered the Seoul Burger Medium cooked and it was amazing! The hamburger comes with poached egg, avocado, kimchi for the right combination. 

First bite the hamburger literally oozed out with flavor from the meat and the egg from the yolk. It was even better when it was then mixed with kimchi and avocado. 

The garbage fries is also fantastic. Great mix of everything you can imagine. Please eat with a fork.

i love burgers was still a little expensive for my tastes, but much more reasonable compared to everything else in the vicinity, and probably ultimately just a few more bucks than the food court, which offered nathan's hot dogs as a best option. 

we ordered the sweet potato fries to share. my friend got a shake which i believe she enjoyed. we were a little grossed out by the idea of the blueberry panshake and caramel corn shake (with real corn?) but didn't try either so i guess i can't be the judge of that. 

the fries themselves were good. we got the garlic sauce which i have to say was a little disappointing for me. i ended up using ketchup. 

i didn't get a burger at i love burgers. i got the warm spinach salad which came with an egg in the shape of a heart. how do you get an egg to be heart shaped? it was hard boiled but the center was a little soft. edible though. overall i guess i found the salad decent. i think it was supposed to come with cheese but i'm pretty sure mine had no cheese. 

i think i wish i had just gotten a burger. i don't know if i really saved that many calories and perhaps one of their other options might have been more delicious. the salad was fine. overall the restaurant seems to have decent food (nothing to write home about, in my opinion...) and prices that are on the pricey side, but still reasonable for this part of vegas. 

i think basically the lesson i learned is that if you're going to go to vegas -- either be rich or win big and then go the extra mile and spend a few more dollars on your dinner at one of the celeb chef restaurants.

Mac n cheese noms: basically deep fried mac n cheese cubs/tots.  Comes with a cheese sauce.  A little too creamy/saucy with the cheese in the noms plus the cheese sauce was overkill.  Cheese wasn't sharp enough for my liking.  

Parm burger: it's a burger for the vegetarians.  2 slabs of eggplant parm with cheese and marinara sauce between 2 buns.  it was okay on flavor since it's missing all the veggies that a burger would normally have.  they decided to just replicate the italian dish and put it between 2 buns and call it a burger.  for me, i would've preferred a more burger-like experience with all the veggies.

Standard burger: what my fiance got.  I don't think he had anything remarkable to say about it.

  The fries are served separate from the sandwiches.  Expect to pay $20 for an eggplant parmigiana burger or basic burger sandwich, fries, and bottomless soda. The higher-end burgers cost as high as $17. What is kind of cool is having ranch dressing come with the fries.

Fortunately there were several TVs showing the Sunday night football game, and a selection of booths, pub tables, and regular tables to choose from. 

Our server, Alma, was very attentive, patient, and helpful: attentive because she checked in on us frequently; patient because she gave us extra time to order and to finish our meal; and helpful because she offered menu suggestions and brought us extra drinks and sauce throughout our meal. 

I ordered the turkey meatball sliders and was MORE than impressed. These not-so-little burgers came with an impressive turkey meatball, hot marinara sauce, and fresh toasted buns, and were literally SMOTHERED in provolone cheese. Wow. I even had extra to take home because I was MORE than filled.

4737284,2015-11-05,1,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"1st let me set the tone and expectations for my review before you read about why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.

- You are probably standing outside this place wondering if you should go in or not

So let's be honest here.  If you really just wanted to eat to consume calories, you would have gone to a food court.  If you are craving something fancy and amazingly flavorful then you would not have stopped to read this review either.

I am guessing that you most likely ended up here because you wanted something better than the food court but do not want to deal with fancy restaurant prices or long waits and that means this place might fit what you are looking for.

Lets start with what to expect:
1. think of this like a ""i'm trying to be a fancy Red Robin"" type of experience.  Everything in Vegas will cost you a little more than normal and this place will offer a much larger variety of burgers, shakes, drinks and sides than anything in a food court
2. you obviously did not see a big fat long line of people waiting to eat here so you should already know that Guy Fieri is not in the back cooking your burger.  However, this burger is much better than what you find at a food court
3. So given that you are not going to take a cab to go to Summerlin or Henderson and actually go to Red Robin, then just go in, sit down and enjoy your burger.

If I was solely rating this place for flavor of food, I would give it 3 stars.  Better than any fast food place but nowhere near anyone's top 50 burgers they have ever eaten in their life.  But the burger is not in anyone's ""worst"" list either.  They are cooked to your specifications, my medium rare sliders were juicy and flavorful and my sweet potato fries were ... well, sweet potato fries lol.

So eat here if you are looking for a Red Robin, Johnny Rockets type of burger, DO NOT eat here if you are looking for a Father's Office type of burger.",qs2LD54aE8eXzrapVsAjBA,1,1,4,P1swyZvuiKYmP3k4x8XumA
4748138,2014-01-08,1,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"My wife and I were not in the mood to travel too far from our room at the Palazzo to grab a bite to eat so we chose I Love Burgers. In fact, I think this is the first restaurant we saw after exiting the elevator on the second floor to the shopping area. I Love Burgers looks like a throwback diner or cafeteria with the checkerboard floors along with the rest of the décor inside. My wife and I agreed with the name of the place so we ventured inside to give this burger joint a try.

Burgers: My wife ordered and absolutely enjoyed her Thanksgiving burger. Made from fresh ground turkey and topped with stuffing, cranberries, cheese and gravy, this burger melted away with every bite. It was so moist and delicious! Probably one of the best turkey burgers either of us have tried. My wife had hit the I Love Burgers' jackpot with this burger. She was the big winner while I was the big loser with my order of sliders. The ground beef in these sliders were really dry, tough and could have used more seasoning. The buns were too crispy from being toasted too long. The sauce on these sliders did not add any flavor. Needless to say, I was really disappointed with these sliders. Instead, I had to savor every bite of the Thanksgiving burger that wife gave me. 

Fries: I thought the sweet potato fries were interesting. They tasted more like a dessert than a side with the amount of cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on them. These fries came out super-hot so we had time to finish our burgers first before diving into them as a dessert.  

Service: It was really busy during our visit and it seemed like they did not have enough staff in place to wait on all the tables. This made the service really slow. I'm hardly ever in a rush but it seemed like an eternity between finishing our meal and getting our check. With that said, we did have a terrific waitress who was really cordial with us. But unfortunately she appeared to be overwhelmed and somewhat exhausted because of the situation. We did not hold that against her and hopefully none of the other customers did as well.

It was probably around 8:30 on a Wednesday night. We were seated right away. The waiter came over within a couple of minutes and took our drink order. I was so tired and hungry, I couldn't decide on what to eat. I asked him what the most popular item was on their menu and he said it was their bacon burger. I LOVE me some bacon, but I just wasn't in the mood for it. 

I actually ended up ordering the parmesan sliders, they sounded so good! My girls ordered the kids chicken strips and french fries. They kids meals come with a soft drink. The sliders were $11 and the kids meals were $7 each. Not a bad price for dinner at The Palazzo. 

The parmesan sliders were really good! It was breaded chicken with cheese. Good flavor and filled me up.

We had an attentive server who seemed to be in a good mood. The service on our second visit, however, during a busy Wednesday morning, was laughable. Paul actually seemed to hate his job. Even though I requested no onions, my burger arrived with onions. When someone at my table mentioned that to Paul, he half-heartedly apologized, with no offer to make it right in any way. THEN, another table-mate realized he never got his sweet potato fries, and Paul's response was that we would only be charged for the food that we had on the table. He did not offer to bring out another order of sweet potato fries. I honestly can't remember another recent encounter with such an indifferent server. Although I wasn't paying the bill (nearly $450 for our table), I made sure no additional gratuity was added to the bill on top of the automatic 18% for our group size.

5048224,2011-01-08,4,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"So with the opening of a new restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian, the BF tends to want to try it since he works on the property. His lunch break experience here during the soft opening was so bad they had to comp the entire groups meal...I'll add more to that later. 

I decide to meet the BF for dinner once he got off work so that he can give it a second chance now that they're a few weeks open. 

Beer Nerd Rant ahead-

He noticed on his last visit that there was a few beer bottles on the counter that he did not recognize so we asked for a beer list. There were 3 that we have not seen before and we tried to look it up online to see what it is exactly. We couldn't find it online. Turns out that their names are written wrong. The beer we were most curious of was listed as ""Imperiale Beer Ubi Red"". The REAL name is Imper Ale Ubi Rossa by Birra Tentute Collesi of Italy. The other two Imper Ale listed are also wrong but are the Fiat Lux and Alter Bionda. It was impressive once I found out what it was.. Our server brought out pint glasses.I had to ask for wine glasses because you don't serve this like it's Bud Light, flavors must aerate. It was small wine glasses for Chardonnay, you need large wide glasses like Pinot Noir or Montrachet or a goblet for full flavor. I think you should know and put the right name on beer list and know how to serve high end product correctly. It's beer, but it was a $30 import so it is a fine product. You wouldn't do it with a wine and I'm just saying, fine beers isn't any different. I know they just opened...for future reference (if people who work there read this). 

Onto the food.....

We shared two starters:

Mac N Cheese & Yam Fries ($6, each) . This is really misleading since both are under ""gourmet fries"" list. Mac N Cheese are more like breaded fried mac and cheese, not mac n cheese flavored fries. It was nice and gooey in the middle, good panko crust and the southwest cheese sauce it comes with was perfect for it. Yam Fries aren't fries- they're thin sliced as chips. We ordered it with the garlic sauce (server recommends the rosemary goes well with it) and it was a airy crunchiness that is kinda addicting. The kind of thing you can keep on noshing on and not realize how much of it you've been snacking on! 

Burgers:

I had the Ahi ($17) which was nicely seared to keep the middle rare. The bun is a taro bun so it's like the sweet buns that most Asian bakeries would make red bean buns with- soft, a bit sticky and sweet. I really liked the sauce on it...it was gingery and had some kick and set off the tuna well. 

BF had the Oregon Trail ($17) which is the Buffalo meat burger with a fine aged sharp cheese (cannot remember which right now), garlic aioli. It was juicy and well seasoned, a solid burger. 

Service was friendly and pretty good about checking on us. 

This is a vast improvement from the BFs last experience. It's my only experience so I'll give them a positive rating since I did have a good meal. Worth the price? That's hard to say as a local with off strip, cheaper options. We obviously get a great employee discount so that made it worth going for us. It was a good burger and if you're a tourist and you're hungry I don't see why not if they get their consistency down, but that might be a while.

BF does not Yelp, but this is some excerpt on his Facebook discussion- an upsetting 1 star kind of experience:

""to me it just seems like there are too many hands in the cookie jar and the focus becomes to look as busy as possible as opposed to really taking care of the customers...it all seems like a grand illusion they think will keep them from getting fired when the hammer comes down.

you would think with 8 chefs on the grill and the head chef there that they could serve 15 guest in a reasonable time. instead they were all making food for each other. there it was in front of us plain as day:

""that has to be our burgers...nope those are going into the back. oh those must be them...nope half the grill people left and sat down to eat them with the milkshake girls...""

He said he would probably give them 2.5 - 3 stars now averaging both experiences, but we'll wait for a 3rd time ( 2nd visit for me) to figure out if this place holds up as a solid place for a burger on the strip or this positive experience was a fluke. A $17 burger should always be top notch.

UPDATE- we had lunch here again and it was pretty decent and alright service so things has improved. The menu changed though and the yam
chips are now gone.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,6,4,-pkmwtEgU2l0gRBRaVXI6Q

Food

I know you're always going to pay more for food in Vegas but with the price tag, I expect quality food.  The food here is extremely overpriced for what you get.

The self proclaimed ""world's greatest fried pickles"" were solid but the ranch to dip them in tasted processed, artificial, and gross. The garbage fries were a pile of ok bar fare, but nothing special. Now the kicker, THE BURGER WAS A UNSEASONED HUNK OF JUNK. It looked so tasty too, but had ZERO flavor. Bun not toasted, meat was unseasoned and had no crust, and the roasted peppers had no flavor and were cold.  Go to Bachi Burger, Burger Bar, KGB, BLT or Sin City Burgers.

We were greeted by a super friendly hostess that quickly seated us and gave us menus to peruse. I noticed that each burger was priced around $15 and didn't include any sides, which struck me as being a bit odd. No matter. After a few minutes browsing their delicious-looking options, I ordered the Standard with Pepper Jack cheese and mushrooms, as well as a side of Parmesan fries. I figured $6 for a side of fries was pretty steep, but just having entered the US mere hours earlier I had a hankering for the classic all-American meal, so I ponied up the extra cash. My friends must have thought the same thing, as we were all giddy with excitement for our meals.

Not long after, our waitress brought out our (massive!) dinners. It doesn't say this on their menu, but a ""side"" of fries is actually an entire basket. Had we known, my friends and I would have easily split them, so take note! As for the food itself, the burger was tasty, although not $15 tasty. As for the fries, they were a bit too thinly sliced for my taste, but that's just me.

I know what you're thinking: ""Sarah, you're giving them only two stars, so there must be more to the story. Out with the juicy details!"" Alright, alright. I just needed to write this preamble to collect myself. Brace yourselves...

When I went to the women's washroom, there was no soap in the dispenser. Gross, yeah, but it happens from time to time. What made me feel REALLY grossed out was that the staff use the same bathrooms as the customers, so how could they not notice the soap was out, unless...? No!

5420586,2011-01-19,1,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"I was in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show and this place was highly recommended by some of the convention attendees.

But a quick note I learned on my visit to the ""I Love Burgers"" restaurant at the Palazzo Hotel ....the restaurant was in the middle of a long soft opening and they were still fine tuning the tastes, servings, servers, and prices of the menu. I will explain how I found out it was a soft opening. With that in mind, I actually l gave the restaurant more forgiveness than I would give most other restaurants.

The talk from some of the attendees was the ""I Love Bacon"" gourmet burger. The restaurant's menu explained the burger as ""..a blend of ground sirloin and applewood-smoked bacon, crispy bacon, bacon mayo, smoked gouda, onion strings, and brioche-style bun"".  The burger was a wonderful blend of meaty flavors. I liked the burger because I Love Bacon, but honestly, for the a la carte burger, it was $17 (See my pic).....if you want more toppings than stated on the menu, other toppings like caramelized onions, jalepenos, mushrooms, extra bacon, etc cost an extra $1-$7 per extra topping....OH NO....and I still needs the fries!

Since we still have to purchase the fries, the restaurant actually has a list of gourmet fries to suit any taste. We chose the regular fries and the Parmesan Garlic fries. The regular fries were better than the non garlic fries. We mentioned to our server that the garlic fries were cold and it lacked the taste of garlic. The server apologized, but that is when I learned it was a soft opening of the restaurant. They did not charge us for those fries.....THANK YOU!

These are gourmet burgers, it was tasty, but I wish the prices were more visitor friendly. I know this is a Vegas Strip restaurant and the prices are justified, but I will probably find another place next time around.

We started off with the milkshakes. They can liquor up any of the shakes, so we of course opted for it...perfect way to start the day, right? :) Milkshakes were AMAZING. They use Haagan Dazs ice cream and the coffee milkshake mixed with some Kahlua and Bailey's was pretty awesome. 

For appetizers, we decided to share the sweet potato fries, truffle fries, and fried dill pickles. Not too bad, pretty standard. Our favorite was the truffle fries. Had a nice kick to it. They also brought out bacon aioli, garlic aioli, and ketchup. The garlic aioli was pretty tasty and went well with the fries.

As for burgers, I ended up getting the ""I Love Bacon"" burger after hearing a nice sales pitch from our waiter. Mmmm, I gotta say, I do love bacon, but this was a little overwhelming. Bacon mixed in the patty, with bacon strips on top, and bacon mayo. By the time I was half-way through the burger, I felt pretty sick, and the burger started tasting super dry from all the salt. I guess it's a good way to get bacon-lovers to take a nice reprieve from bacon-binging. My buddies enjoyed their burgers, especially the ahi burger on a taro bun. 

As for service, it was very friendly, but super slow. It took about an hour for our burgers to come out. We ended up asking for our fries early because we needed SOMETHING to eat. And they also mixed up our order. We ordered a drink that never came out as well. So I guess still a little hectic.

The menu itself is pretty simple. The waiter mentioned that they were planning on adding some new items. Hopefully they can keep up with their orders!

Would I come back? It's a maybe. I definitely won't order the bacon burger again. Overall, I thought it was okay. Prices weren't steep, typical Vegas strip.",Lp3YKesc6hahMLgXcv3L2w,5,3,3,7k-ePeJpBNqkWCSgfwCrZg

I wasn't disappointed. We started with the ""World's Greatest Fried Pickles"". They lived up to the name. They were expertly seasoned spears fried to perfection. I've had fried pickles at a ton of restaurants and at The State Fair of Texas, but I can honestly say these were the best I've had. Next we had Blueberry and Caramel Corn shakes. The blueberry was ok, but the Caramel Corn was out of this world amazing! The burgers we ordered were the Waygu Kobe and the I Love Bacon. The Wagyu Kobe is the most expensive item on the Menu at $25. The Wagyu Beef was worth the hype, but the burger overall was just good, not amazing. The prosciutto was good, but not the best and the truffle cheese did provide a nice flavor. The I Love Bacon was good as well, but it didn't floor me.

5684667,2013-01-24,0,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"This review is going to cover both of my experiences at 'I Love Burgers'.

The first time was in January 2012. I am a bit of a burger fanatic, so when my buddy and I saw this restaurant while walking through the Palazzo, we had to stop and try it.
My first impression was that the dining area is too sterile and it was packed! But the true question was how are the burgers? They did not disappoint. We ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese Noms to start. They are VERY small, but the flavor was fantastic. On to the burgers!
We ordered three so we could cut them in half and try a variety. Caprese Burger, Wagyu Kobe Burger, and the Oregon Trail Burger. As well as Sweet Potato Fries.
The Caprese Burger was cooked perfectly, as were all the patties, however the balsamic reduction was a bit much. There was quite a bit on the burger and feel a little less would have added to it. Sometimes less is more. That was the case here. 2 star burger.
The Wagyu Kobe burger was good.... But not $25 good. The patty was juicy and flavorful but it didn't make my eyes roll back in my head like Kobe Beef should. The Truffle Cheese was a fantastic addition, after all, Truffle cheese is amazing all on it's own! I didn't care for the pretzel bun at all. 3 star burger.
The Oregon Trail burger was great! I make Bison Burgers on average of once a week at home. For those that haven't tried Bison, you are doing yourself an injustice. Bison is lower in Fat, lower in Cholesterol, Higher in Protein and in Minerals. Has an amazing sweet taste, and is so JUICY!!!!  Back to the burger.... We ordered it with caramelized  onions to soften them up and take the edge off a bit. The result was a spectacular burger. Juicy, perfectly cooked, flavorful, with a perfect amount of roasted garlic aioli. The Wheat bun was firm enough to hold the burger together, yet not so dense that it took away from the tender patty. 4+ star burger.
Sweet Potato Fries were great. Dusted with the perfect amount of cinnamon and brown sugar. 
So, over all, the first visit deserved 3 1/2 stars. Being there are no half stars on yelp, let's call is 4 stars, as it was better than 'A-Ok'.

The second visit was last week. This time I knew what I wanted. I walked in around 5:30 pm. The place was DEAD! And it remained dead for the hour and a half that I was there.
I sat down, placed my order of Mac & Cheese Noms, an Oregon Trail Burger with Caramelized Onions cooked medium rare, and Sweet Potato Fries.
The Noms came out pretty quick. They were as good as I remembered. Still a bit small, but, good nonetheless. Then came the fries and burger. Fries were luke warm at best. Some were even a bit soggy. It was bad. Just bad. However, the burger was worse. My previous experience of a perfectly cooked Medium-Rare burger was a memory. What I received was what appeared to be a juicy Buffalo Patty, but in reality was a dry piece of shoe leather. After my first bite, I cut into the burger to view a grey DRY overcooked $18 burger that my dog would have rejected. I squeezed the patty and not one drop of any type of liquid could be found. This was a first degree burger felony! 
For the remainder of my stay at the Venetian, I stayed clear of 'I Love Burgers'. Granted this could be an isolated incident. But it was so bad that it wasn't worth taking the chance. This visit was not only zero stars, but, I would go so far as to give it multiple negative stars.
The WORST burger I have EVER had. And I've had some pretty bad ones.
Because of the good first experience, I have given it 2 stars. Otherwise it would be one star. I don't think I will ever give it a third shot.",-aOyKAkjjEEyaGrXB9uKCg,0,0,2,Q6-i4vZHuRvfVLwbxR1ASg
5707344,2013-11-24,0,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"I am disappointed with this place. From how difficult it was to find its location in the Grand Canal Shoppes, to how long we waited for our food, and to how the food tasted. As a guest staying at the Palazzo, my friend and I wanted a quick dinner before our night out (aka needed greasy food to absorb alcohol). We saw an ad for this place in the elevator and it seemed like it would fit the bill.

We sat at the bar to order our food to go and I had sticker shock to see the average price of a burger for $16. Really?? Burgers are great and all but I don't think the size and quality (solely judging on pictures from Yelp at this point) justified it. However, we were pressed for time so we ordered a Dante and BBQ burger -- both cooked medium rare and with avocado.

We waited for a really long time and after a short walk back to our room, I discovered that our food was cold and overcooked. I expect a burger place to know how to cook a patty to medium rare and I was torn to see no pink in the patty.  Also, I think they forgot about us which is why the food was cold. I REALLY love burgers and this has been the most disappointing burger I've had... Possibly ever. At least they didn't forget about the avocado. The BBQ sauce and avocado were probably the best parts. 

I feel like I was cheated out of a meal and it cost way too much. I'm pretty serious about enjoying my food -- some people talk about you have a finite mount of breaths you can take, I see life with only a limited amount of meals you'll have. I would've preferred eating food from In-N-Out than here. The three-star rating on Yelp for this place is generous.

If you need a quick meal (or any meal) while at the Palazzo, I'd suggest skipping this place and going to Grand Lux Cafe. At least it's consistent, even if it's a chain restaurant.",y_NN5l98IJ94RYV9bewsoQ,2,0,1,0C43qwnTJEoohA4oCbuuNw

I also got the sweet potato fries, which they were kind enough to ask, cinnamon and sugar or salt. Salt please - I don't need them sickly sweet. Of particular note those, this place doesn't exactly use 97/3 lean beef. More like 70/30. Wow.

All in all, satisfying. Their menu is a little small - I guess for a place with a name like this, I was expecting a laundry list of options, when there are in reality only about 8-10, and some of those are fish/turkey, and not really ""burgers,"" if you ask me. Price was high for a burger, but it's Vegas, as I've said a million times this week. Who knows if I'll ever be back, but I wouldn't avoid it.",tPufvUuxXLJOMYQ7gzsMVA,1,1,3,B8xFUPVbFwzFJsVU26Tdng
5797187,2011-05-26,1,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"I came here for the reason one of my friends works here at the bar. The reason why I give this place two stars is not because burgers to myself *personally* are redundant, but the fries were very soggy and the food was overly greasy. Ordering The Longhorn (which I thought was *slightly* a better alternative for meat than just a burger), the chicken itself was too greasy for my liking. The fries were too soggy because so much grease was put into making them, or maybe the prep in the back doesn't know how to make fries correctly?

For a burger venue, they have a wide bar and were distinctive drinks on their menu that really weren't that bad. The drinks and the different creative styles they were mixed in were fairly noteworthy for a burger restaurant. Also, your food comes out in less than 10 minutes; I have to say the service here is on top of it, as even observing to-go orders, they waited less than 10 minutes to receive what they needed.

For the drink and full bar, and the speed of the service I would have gave it three stars, but the food at best is two stars. This is one of those burger restaurants to where if you're super drunk or hungover on The Strip, the greasiness would be the perfect place here to soak it all up.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,2,0,2,11fpdP-HAkP2LyrZ6lDYHA

5837345,2016-09-25,3,R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA,"Talk about over-ordering for the sake of a more robust Yelp review!  Here Diane and I enjoyed a really tasty and complete lunch that for me consisted of an excellent thick medium-rare burger with very flavorful bacon and mushrooms added; a large portion of fine hand-cut fries; a heaping order of Tater Tots; nice light, hot, and thin Fried Pickle slices with Ranch Dressing; and an unanticipated THIRTEEN superior battered Onion Rings, all fresh and smoking hot, served with a memorable Remoulade Dressing.  I knew I would receive some Onion Rings in an O-ring order, but the possibility of receiving twelve large ones was never remotely anticipated.  Fortunately this was the last day of a conference, so 3/4 of the rings; half of the fries; and many Tater Tots were able to be carted home to accompany a sandwich for another lunch the next day.  

Diane's burger was medium well rather than medium rare as ordered, and the added Cheese Sauce represented by our server to be mild had an unintended kick to it.  She does not like anything hot or peppery!

The manager came over, tested the creamy cheese, and verified its taste as being spicier than what it should be.  He said that he would be having a talk with the kitchen staff about this.  A new burger was offered but Diane declined in the interest of time.  She did enjoy her Chocolate Milk Shake, however.   

Service was friendly and efficient except for the glitch in the Cheese Sauce.  Apparently our server's representation about it was accurate but the kitchen crew faltered in faithfully executing what should have been a mild rather than spicy embellishment.

The food and service were good enough for us to make a return visit, whether or not we are staying at The Palazzo.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,5,4,A1nOq99dJLXNBgXz5aYs7g

With that said - the salad options were quite exciting and I was glad to see that I wasn't limited to a paltry wad of iceberg, rotting tomatoes, and bagged cheese.  Instead, I got a mountain of fresh green lettuce, avocado, and plenty of other tasty salad fixin's.  I asked for the tuna addition and was a little disappointed at how overcooked the tuna pieces were - but they were still flavorful.  Just a bit dry.  Service was good.  Friendly.  Relatively quick.  I loved all the tv's readily available for sports watching and spouse ignoring.  Next time I am in Vegas - I'll keep I Love Burgers in mind if I'm hankering for healthy.

Coming here, I didn't expect the attention I did.  We were promptly seated with a warm greeting, tables were so spotless, you could eat off of them, duh.

She knew when to fill my water glass, provide me more napkins, check up in me from time to time, jeez she might as well have wiped the ketchup from my lips!

I've made burgers and fries at home better than this. They couldn't even get the num nums right. I could taste powdery cheese throughout the entire appetizer. Not sure if it's just Buffalo, but my burger was entirely dry and hard to stomach, asked for extra garlic Aioli sauce just to swallow it. The menu claims they cook all burgers medium with a pink center unless otherwise requested, mine was well ALL the way through. Fries were boring and none of the cheese actually stuck to my fries because they used powdered Parmesan. At least melt some butter or something to make it stick to the fries.
SERVICE: again H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E

The Wagyu Kobe burger was $25 for just the burger and it was good. But I expected more from a $25 dollar burger. Again, make sure you ask for more demi glacé to soak the bun in extra flavor.

This is what we ordered:

-Mac and Cheese Nom Noms: Tasty fried Mac and Cheese squares with a side of cheese sauce. They were very good and probably the best part of our meal!

-Sweet Potato Fries: nothing special about these, some were not cooked well. I have definitely had better elsewhere. 

-The Standard Burger with Cheddar Cheese: it honestly looked pretty boring when it arrived at our table. Sadly, the beef patty was not juicy or  hot and tasted pretty bland. 

-I love Bacon Burger: my husband ordered this. He pretty much felt the same way I did. The burger was not great, and what a shame since it was called I love bacon! 

The two good things about this place:

-Friendly wait staff who checked up on us often. 

-Very fast service! We were just starting on our Mac and Cheese appetizer, then 2 minutes later, our burgers arrived!

The standard: Literally a standard burger. Lettuce, tomatoes, cheese. Nothing special. BUT!! The beef patty was moist and you can taste that it was good beef. Not ground crap you buy at supermarkets, but literally fresh ribeye or whatever part of cow it is chopped up into delicious goodness. 

Salmon salad: I know, I know...go into a burger place and order a salad? Well, for us gluten-free folks we don't really have a choice. Salad was very blah. I felt like a moo-Cow trying to chew on grass. Salmon was moist and good, but still a very unsatisfying meal.

Coffee bean milkshake (spiked): Spiked with vodka, kahlua, and baileys. Trust me, you cannot taste the alcohol! Comes in a giant cup with extra on the side...I couldn't stop eating it! The bf had to tell me to slow down ;( Little random chunks of ice cream made it all the better...delicious!

Overall, not bad for your average burger, but not gluten-friendly at all. The waitress told me they put bread crumbs in the patty so you can't even order it without the bun. If I could eat the whole burger without suffering from an allergy, I'd come again....but for the salad? No thanks.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,0,0,4,QwecMCyvmEuOWs0mCy1eLA

The French toast combo was enormous, consisting of one dish of four slices of French toast and another dish of eggs, bacon, and more hashbrowns, if I remember correctly.
