The Coffee Pub had a cute cozy cafe vibe with choice of seating inside or out .  We were told we could seat anywhere we wanted so we chose to sit inside .  

The service wasn't as prompt as I normally would like it to be.  This other couple seating in the same area even said "" hmm we should have sat outside where everyone is at .  So It wasn't just me.  

The food was delicious my hubby ordered the French Toast with side of patties . And I ordered their egg white omelette with chicken and fruit .  I love their healthy options of egg whites , soy or skim milk with your lattes and fruit sub over potatoes .  

I was so looking forward to giving them 5 stars but it was the service .  The regulars got really nice welcome back treatment which was cool to see .

This time at Coffee Pub Restaurant. We ate outside because it was a nice day and the atmosphere was nice. The restaurant seemed clean and had its own style. 

I ordered the Pub Dip (French Dip basically). It came with roast beef, sauteed mushrooms and onions, with melted mozzarella cheese. It was excellent! The au jus was flavorful and the sandwich itself was too. I was definitely wanting more afterward. 

The fiance got breakfast croissant and it came with diced potatoes. I didn't have a chance to try the sandwich but I did try the potatoes because they looked awesome. They were just ok unfortunately. The were cooked perfectly but had zero seasoning. The fiance said the same of the sandwich. Having not tried it, I can't really make an accurate assessment of it.

Since then Marty opened the health and juice bars in a local gym franchise, the ownership shifted twice, but the Coffee Pub's flexible and delicious menu continued.

The lady said it was 4 piece of French toast (which was surprising to me because it only cost $1 more than a regular 3-slice French toast). But I didn't expect the amount when it came out. The French toast was basically two almost-sandwiches (choice-of-fruit and cream cheese enveloped by French toast), cut into four triangles. It was amazing!!

The biscuits and gravy side was phenomenal. I LOVE biscuits and gravy and these were honestly probably the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. The biscuit was full of flavor and the gravy was absolutely delightful! (If I'm honest, I loved these more than my amazing French toast).

After a simple ""breakfast"" search in our general area, I saw a well rated place with two of my favorite things: coffee and pubs. After clicking through some pictures I came across the a lobster omelet. LOBSTER OMELET. That sold us. Well, me. I sold Greg. 

To be honest, I can't even remember what he had, but you can guess what I had. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered a ""SOMETHING"" omelet or ""SOMETHING"" scramble, and you get it, and there's egg, there's cheese and assorted accoutrements, but there's only evidence that the ""SOMETHING"" was maybe once a part of the ingredients. Coffee Pub knows no such practice. That was a LOBSTER omelet. It was good. It was lobster-y. It's something I want to eat the next time I go to Vegas. Hell, it's something I want to eat for breakfast today. 

As a note, I love me a good potato. Hash browns, baked, mashed, fried, I just love it, but the pub potatoes, or whatever they may have been named, were just ok.

The staff once they get to know you are incredibly friendly and courteous. They do get swamped, but they will take care of you and make sure you enjoyed your meal. The other day I spotted Carolyn Goodman having lunch there. A few days prior I saw Dina Titus eating at Macaroni Grill...I think I just have a knack for spotting public figures. 

Anyway, the menu is huge and the food is solid. Some of it is hit and miss, but some of it is very much hit ,among those being the Lobster Omelet, Tortilla Soup and the La Jolla Sandwich. You can do the half sandwich, soup and pasta salad or fruit combo for like $9. You really can't beat that for freshly made food. The Lobster Omelet is delicious with huge chunks of lobster.

Breakfast is traditional American. 
For me, the mark of a great restaurant is how good the eggs benedict are. These were pretty great. The eggs were perfectly poached. The hollandaise was rich and creamy and everything you expect from hollandaise. The potatoes were seasoned well and perfectly crispy and soft inside. 

We opted for patio seating because it was a beautiful day out in early October. Our server was a tall mustachioed Kings fan.

what was beyond horrid was the chorizo omelet my bf had been craving all morning. it was brought to us beyond burnt.  like so visibly wrong we were shocked they would even set it on the table.  yes, the presence of chorizo can darken the overall omelet appearance, this was not the issue. the issue was that the cook done burnt the shit out of that omelet.  my bf is of the generally never send something back and make the best of it school.  he tried dousing it in sauce to make it edible. nothing could help that sad omelet.  

we didnt even get the opportunity to send it back as no one came to check on us for several several minutes.  despite seeing my empty plate and an omelet missing two bites on my bf's, the waitress said, is everything ok here? hmmm, probably not.  we explained it was not edible due to being beyond burnt. she apologized but did not offer to cook another or ask if he wanted something else.  after a few mpre minutes we asked for the check, having to flag down another server.  the chorizo omelet was not taken off the check.  

I informed the waitress that as the omelet, was not only visibly burnt but inedible, that it should be removed from the check.  She then had a man come over, possibly the owner, who tried to explain to us that if may have been burned because the chorizo has to be cooked a long time. bad, bad, bad excuse, even more so as my bf used to own a bar/restaurant in the southwest and is quite aware of how chorizo needs to be cooked and that most important, it can coexist with eggs in an omelet without it being burnt beyond consumption.

We decided to try the special which was the Californian Eggs Benedict and the Smoked Salmon Scramble with bagels and cream cheese. Both plates were tasty and light, so if you want to splurge, you can do so here with out feeling it in your tummy or your wallet since it's reasonably priced.

You would think that since the name of the restaurant is called The Coffee Pub, you'd be able to order a from a selection of coffees and styles...not here! They only have one type, I believe it's Farmer Brothers brand and that's it. I'm not a coffee guru or anything, but this will definitely go on my top ten list of Worst Bad Cup of Coffee's list!

Pros: Good and affordable breakfast. I do like that it's on the outskirts of the strip, not far at all from the 15 hwy  great location. Love the patio setting they have to sit outside. Greeted immediately walking in, Thumbs up!

Cons: they could really use an update in the cafe. It's super outdated, and the ""older"" look just makes you think that it's automatically dusty and dirty(if that makes sense) although it was clean. I ordered the breakfast burrito and my husband got the breakfast croissant with a side of potatoes. Mine was good, soggy at the end of the burrito, which made it hard to eat... it got really messy and juice all over the plate and ended dripping off the plate to the table to my leg hahaha. Had only the one napkin that came with the silverware. I think you should be given extra napkins automatically when given your food (personally). The waiter wasn't around enough towards the end when I changed my mind to have coffee to ask for it. And then come back to give me or ask me for a refill. There's also no sign by the dining area that says you need to pay in the front.. so we were waiting forever it seemed for our waiter to bring us the check.. seriously towards the end, like never saw him. I think his timing was just bad. He wasn't a bad waiter. He just came too soon after given the meal and then just vanished. No in between at all. - forgot to mention my hubbys sandwich he says tastes like a normal croissant sandwich, wasn't amazing, and wasn't bad either.

It's definitely a hidden gem and I probably wouldn't ever have known about it if it weren't for my bad habit of trying to find shortcuts in this city. The place has a very ""homey"" feel and actually reminds me of being in Lake Tahoe or some place in the mountains. I dined here with Don earlier today and ordered a 1/2 sandwich combo with The Palm Springs Sandwich, roasted tomato soup, and coleslaw ($8.95). Don ordered the Ribeye Steak and Eggs ($12.95). While waiting for our orders, we studied on our laptops because they have free wifi, woohoo. The food came out pretty fast. The soup was pretty salty, so I didn't care for it very much at all, but the sandwich tasted so fresh. I don't normally order anything with roast beef in it, but the combination of roast beef with avocado was very tempting. 

While we ate, I couldn't help but notice that there were a lot of regulars in the house. The employees would call people by their names and already have their usual orders memorized (it's always a good sign when people come back that many times). They were also surprisingly busy. I say ""surprisingly"" because I've never heard of this place before or even seen it. They had a lot of people dining out on the patio, inside, and calling in orders. 

I will be back here very soon, especially since it's not too far from CSN and it's right by the freeway.

The place is small with rickety wood chairs, old plastic cups that had a lot of chips on the edges, some plates were plastic, and cheap silverware. 

Wasn't a very professional greeting and taking orders was done so poorly (even by the manager I found out at the end). He didn't right things down and messed up several orders of the people beside us and forgot an item. Why not use a pen and paper? 

Every time someone brings a plate of food or drink they'd ask ""who ordered this?"" 

They didn't bring either appetizer until I asked and ended up being right before our main meals came. 

The appetizer noodles were good but kinda small portion for costing over $4. 
The soup in the appetizer section of the menu also came out way late. As soon as the soup came out I said ""doesn't this soup come with a topping?"" I seen pics on yelp that looked different than this I told them. There was a tiny amount of cheese, I gathered it all. There was also only 3 tiny pieces of chicken and made with canned veggies. I should of took pics but was hungry and didn't want the Benedict to get cold so just ate that. Benedict was good at least and good potatoes. 4-4.5 if rated on that meal alone. 

Even after expressing displeasure in the soup and having empty drink for a long they let my drink run out again. The servers don't help each other and work their sections. Our server (the manager) just poked his head and looked in the room but wouldn't come check in, it was so weird. 

Finally the manager brought the table beside us the pancake he forgot but didn't have it in a to go container when clearly this group was ready to go long before. This manager didn't think about the customer and just in his own planet. 

What bumps out from a 1 star is the decent food and the manager trying at the end but it was so frustrating. I asked for a manager and the lady said okay rolled her eyes and laughed! I knew why and that is when I first realized our server was the manager lol. 

He heard me out but didn't seem to care all that much. He said ""give us another try and come back tomorrow for free meal"" I said I'll try again but not for at least 2-4 weeks to give you time to update and train employees. After chatting a little longer I asked for my check and he said ""I'll cover this one but you pay next time."" So he offered me a free meal but but literally 1-2 minutes later changed his mind and said ""you pay next time"". Hahaha to funny. 

It was one awkward breakfast so not to likely to be back anytime soon. Hope this review helps keep your expectations realistic at least.

The ambiance is clean and country quirky. We felt comfortable. 

It took about 5 min to be acknowledged. I get annoyed when you aren't even acknowledged. No, ""hi, be right with you."" No, ""good morning."" Maybe I'm getting old and have high expectations. The two tables who sat down several minutes after us had drinks and had ordered before we even talked to a person. Oh well I digress. 

The iced tea is like a tropical tea. It was yum. 

After we ordered it took far too long to get our food. The two other tables, who sat after us, were finishing eating. 

When our food came the person had to come back three times. Each of these times she came with the wrong meal. Pancakes? No. Croissant Benedict? Yes, but this is a croissant sandwich. Now the right meal comes. Another situation. My husband ordered the potato cakes as a side to his burrito. He has two McDonalds looking hash browns on his plate. She also places a plate with two more McDonald's looking hash browns down. I say, ""oh, we asked for the potato cakes."" She says this is the correct item. She leaves. Two minutes later after we salt and start picking at them she comes back and takes the two in the middle away. It was all just weird. I totally think that someone got our salted ""potato cakes"" because she wanted us to take the orange that we placed on the plate off. Oh, and PS the ""potato cakes"", of you haven't gathered yet, are not the type that come with sour cream and apple sauce. They are like McDonald's hash browns.

When you walk in its more like a diner rather than a coffee shop that I had expected . They have a nice area on the patio to eat as well as two rooms inside filled with old pictures , reminiscent of it's past. You can pick your own seats as well. My seat seemed as if it was going to break which was a little uncomfortable so I switched seats with a table near by . I found that the interior part of the restaurant was uncomfortable so we opted for the patio. The patio area is a nice shaded area. 

I got the frozen white chocolate mocha frappe and the salmon lox. Delicious ! They were both very good and the waitress even gave me a few more capers cause I'm a caper freak. Anywho , service was awesome and you can tell that everyone that works there cares about their customers. A few regulars came in and they greeted them welcomingly asking them how they've been etc . Was nice to see this and they even treated me like I've been going there along time .

We opted for outside seating, as the September morning weather was cooperating. 

Drink orders were slow, as was the service in general. The food was delivered by, none other than, the ""gardner."" A jack of all trades it would seem. The eggs, hash browns and sausage were all very good. The pancakes, on the other hand, were not. They were chewy and it seemed as though they must have been done before the rest of the meal and then reheated. The coffee was decent and the atmosphere had a cool coffee shop flare to it.

If we weren't such happy people, this experience would have ruined our day.

My fiancé & I went today around noon during lunch rush when many of the tables outside were taken. I'd read the great reviews & it was the closest breakfast spot so we came with reasonable expectations. After locating the place, we walked in smiling & looking around & immediately an older white lady server barked at us ""RIGHT THERE!"" while pointing us to the two-tops (2 person tables) near the register with the urgency of someone handing off a baton in an ekiden relay. Oookay, we sat down in the dimness & awaited our server. 

The place looked understandably busy & after a while a redheaded server asked if we had a menu & after we said no she handed two to us & we asked if we could relocate to sunnier Table 1 by the window. She said sure. 

 We already had coffee beforehand so we planned to share a meal and add sides to it. Our server came after a few minutes & with no greeting asked what she could get us. I smiled & politely asked a question about the pancakes & she made it seem for all the world like she was thinking ""Hurry TF up"" without ever actually saying it. I dislike feeling rushed, but I hastily made our order of pumpkin pancakes with a side of bacon & asked to hold onto a menu. She left without a word. I looked to my fiancé & asked if that seemed rude to him & he agreed she seemed very rude, yet she lacked the frazzled look of a server whose tables were crashing so we figured it was a personal problem.

Seated on the other side of us outside was another couple who was seemingly forgotten & agitated (their table was in the corner but clearly visible through the glass), because about 10 mins later another server had to get our server to that table and it looked like she was apologizing then took their order, got their drinks, & stalked off. It was then I noticed she was pregnant. 

A pair of regulars were then seated near us & she treated them more warmly, at least. We had to flag down the nice Japanese male server to ask if we could add to our order a side of eggs & he said sure & went off to relay. About 2 mins later our order came out complete & was brought to us by a really sweet younger white guy who was either a server or food runner & asked if we needed anything else. We said we didn't & dug in.

The pumpkin pancakes were delicious, and the eggs were made perfectly but the star of the show was the bacon, & I don't even really care for bacon actually. They were perfectly crisp, thick, with mostly meat & not oily. The pancakes were warm and yummy, the added whipped cream and pecans were a nice touch. I'd come back for the food but ask not to be seated with Tatiana as our server. 

We got through the meal then asked for the check from the redheaded server once again (I wish we could have tipped HER) & our meal ended up costing only $15.60. Our server came back, said ""here's your check, thanks guys!"" to the table of 2 regulars & then slapped the check face down at ours without a word & left. I was actually pretty disgusted with her at this point. We discussed whether we should tip her at all & finally I decided to tip just $2 (the lowest I have ever tipped a server) when she showed up for the first time actually smiling & said we could check out with her. We paid & left. She could have made an easy $5 tip from us if she'd been polite at the very least. I doubt she made $20 in tips the whole shift that morning with that attitude.

Overall, if our server had been better & not bitter as hell, the experience would have been enjoyable. I've worked with burnt out girls who were pregnant in their last trimester who were at the end of their patience but were nicer than Tatiana. I'd go back if only for the food.",j8bhSD379qzoVa15RSCBUw,2,1,3,InuIba-L_c6VJNNov10U8A

3726342,2018-03-06,1,0XEqyl_lVaJNHRKxNcjJZg,"Automatic +1 for another great find off of the strip. Still relatively close if you'd like to venture off. This has all the makings of your traditional down home breakfast joint. It is modest and intimate, but boasts a huge menu with a bountiful selection of breakfast food and a few select sandwiches (nearly all named after California cities). It's comfortable with just the right amount of quirky.

The service was just a little slow, but seeing as it was the Sunday brunch rush, I can hardly fault them for that. All things considered the staff were very friendly, and our server made sure we had everything we needed without being overbearing. 

Now food wise:
Coffee is top pedigree, comes with real cream and flows freely. After playing roulette between several menu items, I finally settled for the Spanish omelette. (chorizo, onion, potatoes) served with a smatter of salsa and cheddar on top. Usually comes with refried beans, which I love, but just wasn't feeling at the time, so I got a side of potatoes instead. It also came with some flour tortillas on the side. I was pleasantly surprised. Very good quality of food, and the chorizo had just enough zing too it, while still maintaining its potent flavor.

We also ordered stuffed French Toast for the table. Very good, on the threshold of amazing, but it just fell a little bit flat for me. It lacked the ""wow"" factor, I think mainly due to the bread itself falling a little short. It was somewhat thin, and a little conservatively dressed. I guess when I imagine stuffed french toast, I think of over the top, bursting at the seams, a few bites in and you can barely finish it. It was still good nonetheless.

I'm a fan, especially given the price point, quality of food, and the easy to find location. My only real question is who are the nicely dressed people framed on the wall with no name plaques? Frequent diners? legal team? Investors? Founders? Who knows! But I'm determined to keep coming back until I do.",bfq5L0rWgG5VQF3tU1TF5w,0,0,4,ZpaRkZ2bNNzHF2M_T5a3aQ

I hate to write a review with such a low rating because they were so nice.  Service is the only reason that I did not give this place 1 star.  The food was absolutely horrible.  We're  actually feeling a little sick.  

The fact that the place was a bit run down didn't deter  us since it's been around for a long time and it's located almost across from Palace Station  (old section of LV).  What did give us a moment of pause was that the place was empty on a Sunday during brunch hours.  That's rare in Vegas unless there's an issue. 

For beverages we ordered coffee and iced tea.  The first cup of coffee was good.  The second tasted like the burnt bottom of the pot.  The tea was cloudy and tasted dirty. 

For food we ordered the California Eggs Benedict $9.75, and the Ribeye & eggs $12.95 (plus $.75 for cream cheese to spread on the bagel and $.60 for house made salsa she told me I should try on my eggs).

Everything about the Benedict tasted old.  The tomato had a mealy texture, the eggs were rubbery, the hollandaise was incredibly bland and gelatinous.  

The Ribeye meal was a disaster.  The steak was way over done, mostly fat & gristle, and lacked any kind of flavor (steak or seasoning).  The scrambled eggs were...gross is the only word I can think of right now.  The house made salsa was good, but didn't save the eggs.  The side of fruit (pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew) was good (they accidentally brought potatoes, but a fruit cup followed quickly after I mentioned it) and the bagel (plain, no choices) was okay.

Let's start with the soup. My date was very unimpressed, it lacked spice and flavor. Perhaps ask for some lime with the soup? Or some of those crunchy tortilla chip pieces would definitely up its game. My stuffed french toast was awesome sauce. Didn't even need any syrup, I ate it with a side of whipped cream. The only thing stuffed at the end was me. Haha! Get it?

Coffee pub feels like you are eating in someone's giant California kitchen. It's homey, comfortable, somewhat lively and very nice. 

They offer a small variety of different coffee drinks (which qualifies them to have the word coffee in their restaurant name). When I notice a restaurant calls themselves a coffee shop but they are only serving regular coffee, IMO they don't have the right to call themselves coffee anything. 

The food we had was awesome, the portions were big, the prices were reasonable and everything we ate during our two breakfast trips was delicious! I would go into more detail but since we went to Vegas last month already I just remember that we loved it! 

If you live in Vegas or you are on vacation and can get off the strip and onto sahara ave. somehow this is the place to be! If we go back this will most likely be our breakfast spot.

Service was awesome. Just fantastic. My server was Lauren and she was the BEST! The moment I walked in she noticed my laptop bag and offered me a table near an electrical outlet. She insisted I take a larger table so I can fit my laptop and meal. When I ordered coffee she read my mind and asked if I wanted water as well (I find that servers rarely ask). She checked up on me the whole 2+ hours I was there.  She offered me plenty of refills and reassured me that I'm welcome to stay as long as I wanted. I never felt rushed or pressured and felt genuinely welcome.

Food was tasty. I ordered a simple egg and sausage and potato dish which is what I always get for breakfast. Coffee was very tasty, too, which is important if you drink coffee black like me. Prices were fantastic.

Ambience was perfect. Noise level and spacing of tables, etc. were great. Free WiFi actually worked unlike half the places that claim to have WiFi. And it was fast; no lags.

This is a great place to come do work, to study, to eat great good, and to feel truly welcome. If I lived in Las Vegas I'd honestly come here at least 4 times a week which is a lot of time to dedicate to one establishment but it was just so great!",YH9Et9cWthnzJilaNZ5gXw,0,0,5,-pTcsYbXSIOdPIZxUjrKzQ
4156713,2016-08-15,0,0XEqyl_lVaJNHRKxNcjJZg,"I picked the Coffee Pub to meet with my friend and her daughter passing through Vegas. It was the perfect meeting place because it is very close to the west side of the I-15 freeway but not on the Strip, very easy to get to and had such great reviews here on yelp. It's in a creatively designed business plaza and isn't really very visible from the street although they do have a sign, but it's not huge. Another yelper said it was right across from the Bank of Nevada and that was a great help. It's also really close to Palace Station and is actually between that and In and Out on the In and Out side of the street.

I was greeted with a smile as I was walking in by a waitress serving people on the shaded patio who had their doggie with them, so it's dog friendly. They have a lot of the freebee Vegas magazines outside should you want to pick one or two up.  It was around 9:45 on a Sunday morning and there were only a few tables of diners at that time. By the time we left, a little after 11:00 am, things were fairly bustling with diners, so going early got me my pick of a great table in the corner with lots of light from the windows surrounding it.

I ordered the half stack of pumpkin pancakes topped with whipped cream, maple syrup and pecans. It was delicious and I could only eat about half of it. I'd say the two pancakes were about 8"" in diameter and took up most of the whole plate. The regular stack is only a little bit more money and would be great to split if you'd like to do that. My friend and her daughter both ordered egg dishes which looked wonderful and they both said theirs were really good too. I don't doubt it. They looked good and their portions were large as well. Oh, and they have gluten-free bread for those who don't eat gluten.

The only one little thing that wasn't perfect was the coffee. I am very finicky about my coffee so I asked the waitress what kind they served and she said ""Farmer Brothers and it is delicious"". I found it to be too strong even loaded up with sugar and what was probably half and half. They also have a soy milk option.  Next time I would try a cappuccino or something along those lines.

All in all, I was very happy I chose the Coffee Pub. There are surprisingly few restaurants near the Strip that I could find where they're open on Sunday, you can have regular good old American food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, has a nice ambiance and good service as well. Our bill was only $33 for 3 breakfasts.  I highly recommend it!",rxkkBnttILRjBPDqLg0UHQ,0,0,5,d94Lm0evqHKdigEJV0xiGA

The club was huge, double-stacked, and toasted so it hurt your mouth a little. But it had good flavor. The #10 had turkey, avocado, sprouts, and tomato on wheat.

Coffee pub was hands down my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas and my favorite staff. I used to live near by so I would order delivery at least once or twice a week. The delivery driver was so fast and nice and eventually knew my order by heart. My go-to's were either bagels and lox or a Sandwhich. Since I moved from the area, any time I was on that side of town, I would stop in or order for pick up. The last time I went in for pick up, it was a warm day so I was wearing shorts and a top. As I went in to pick up, there was a bit of a wait. One of the men working in the back of house saw me and after he got done looking me up and down, he went and got the rest of the back of house staff and they all came out and were gawking at me until I felt uncomfortable enough to move. They moved too to get a better view and I asked them to stop. One of the servers asked me if everything was okay and I told her I felt extremely uncomfortable. She was nice enough to tell them to stop and get back to work. They all went back in the kitchen, laughing, and continued peeking out at me until I left. This was quite unfortunate because I miss the coffee pub but don't find it worth it to return to feel as uncomfortable as I did that day.

I decided to order from the specials out front and got the breakfast crepe with chicken, mushrooms and a variety of other vegetables and hollandaise sauce.

I didn't actually like the crepe. There was a cream soup base inside mixed with the chicken and
veggies that I found off putting. I did love the hash browns.
Jacob absolutely loved his chicken tortilla soup, the fresh tortillas on the side was a great way to start off his breakfast. I'm also not sure what he got for breakfast as he ate it super quickly, but I know it came with their roasted potatoes which he enjoyed as well.

We first went here on Mother's Day (2014). I had never heard of this place before and it's sort of situated in a random complex that I never knew had a restaurant nestled among it. The place looks pretty old which totally adds to it's charm. Our waitress was upbeat, friendly, and really made us feel at home. And by that I mean, she really gave us a vibe that made us feel like we were in her house and she was about to whip up a great homemade meal. 

I ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict. Our waitress suggested to have the hollandaise on the side since she says that sometimes they can get a little heavy handed on it. I took her suggestion and was glad I did. I love that i was able to have complete control of the amount and now that I have done that, I may continue to order it on the side. The salmon was delicious, thinly sliced, and they served the perfect amount of it. I also ordered the grilled potatoes for the side and they were perfectly seasoned and cooked!

My BF ordered the chili omelette which had the perfect amount of chili to egg ratio. I've had some chili omelets at other restaurants where the chili completely overpowered the rest of the meal, but not the case this time. 

Our son ordered the chocolate chip pancakes which were so delicious and perfectly fluffy! He didn't end up eating the whole order (usually he does) because he was a bit under the weather. Our waitress noticed and gave him peppermint tea. I thought that was so sweet of her to do. I was really impressed by her gesture!

The 2nd time I visited this place was with my best friend. Her and I always take each other out for either breakfast/lunch/dinner for our birthdays each year and this year I chose this place.

She ordered the California Benedict (canadian bacon, tomato, spinach, & avocado) & I ordered the Lobster Omelette. Her benedict was delicious, creamy, and had perfectly poached eggs. When I had the first bite of my omelet, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but then I couldn't stop eating it, lol! They put in a really generous amount of lobster that tasted like it was mixed with mayo or cream cheese and scallions. I've never had an omelet with seafood inside of it, but this was surprisingly delicious. It's very rich and although I may not order it again (only because I want to try the rest of the menu), I'm glad that I did!

We will DEFINITELY be back to this place. It is a ways from our house, but it's totally worth the drive.",eH8-DE48eh6xXnoKc6_lnw,1,1,5,MlNxISPk6FaD_nnLtF3YYQ

We also ordered the ribeye with eggs and their house potatoes. The meat was cooked nicely and the potatoes were good. Again, nothing spectacular though.

I am not a lobster lover, so I ordered a scramble with broccoli and feta. My husband says he probably wouldn't order the omelet again because it is covered in a rich cheese and chile sauce, and creamy isn't one of his favorite adjectives. However, there were definitely plenty of chunks of lobster. My scramble was solid thanks to a healthy helping of super fresh broccoli. And, we both enjoyed potato cakes, basically a McDonald's hashbrown. 

In addition to a large breakfast and lunch menu featuring staples like omelets and sandwiches and some creative twists, aka lobster, the Coffee Pub also has an extensive coffee menu. My latte was one of the better executions I have had at a full service breakfast restaurant.

Cons: order was wrong, food took a little bit longer than normal 

I went here for breakfast one morning because I saw all the great Yelp reviews. However it was a little bit disappointing. The place itself is cute, perfect little breakfast nook and the location is good. I ordered a veggie omelette with no cheese, there was a lot of cheese on the omelette. 

On the menu I think it says that the omelette comes with potatoes and two slice of toast. I asked our waitress instead of the potatoes can I have fruit instead? And she said yes. Ok perfect. 

I order two pieces of sourdough toast with no butter but when I got my order, I got no fruit and had 4 pieces of toast with butter on them. 

I normally don't say anything but I told the waitress and before I could finish my sentence, she cut me off and said ""oh I know! they put butter"" and she grabbed the toast pretty quickly and came back with 4 pieces of toast without butter. Still no fruit bowl or potatoes. 

I am not the kind of person to speak up when my orders wrong at a restaurant, it's too nerve wracking for me so I never brought it up to her that they forgot my fruit bowl. And I never brought up that my omelette had cheese all over it.

We sat ourselves and were served quickly (which was great because we needed to get home). The coffee was pretty standard coffee....nothing special for a place named after it. My friend had the pumpkin pancakes, which were good, and I had the croissant egg sandwich sub over medium egg. Mine was very good, but very homey... as in, I could make this at home. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. The bacon was crispy and the eggs were cooked well. It was good. Service was great, the woman who works there (owns it?) with the short hair knew everyone's names that came in and was very friendly...offered to bring out a coffee to go for me, which I appreciated.

The first time I came, I had my old favorite sandwich, the Floor Show which is just turkey and avocado. You can't really can't go wrong with this simple sandwich and it was good. I came back again last Friday and decided to get a little more adventurous. I decided to order the Huevos Rancheros. This is one of my favorite breakfast dishes and I like to try them out when I see them on a menu. Our server informed me that ""it is the best dish on the menu"" so I got excited! She even went as far as to tell me that she comes in on her days off just to have this dish so my friend decided to order the same dish. 
Well..........our orders arrived and at first look, the dish looked really good but then I tasted it and UH OH! It was a huge disappointment. First of all, they used flour tortillas which I prefer corn and I am used to the dish being soaked in salsa. There was little to no salsa on this dish but they did pile on the cheese. The beans were totally separated from the dish which I found odd and they tasted like they had been around a while. The flavors were dull and tasteless but I managed to get it down.

Everything we ordered was seriously so great. We had the banana and strawberry stuffed french toast and all I can say is WOW! I never had stuffed french toast before and I like how the flavors were subtle. It wasn't too sweet and the fruits were fresh. I also got an over easy egg and upgraded to the chicken apple sausage. The quality of the sausages were great and tasty too! The bacon here is crunchy and thick! The egg benedict also had a nice hollandaise sauce.

Coffee Pub had good reviews and despite it being very close to the Strip, we decided to give it a shot. We were very pleasantly treated by a waitress whose name I can't recall but was definitely in the right profession. She swooped by and got our coffee and breakfast orders, cooed over our dog, managed several other tables, and made some very comfortable, friendly, and raunchy small talk in between. Even with her other tables, she seemed to be very attentive and picked up on their needs before they had a chance to flag her down. 

We sat outdoors so we could have our dog-son Arlo with us while we ate. I got a vegetarian breakfast scramble and she got the Hungry Farmer (or something like that) Omelette without the meat. The home fries were amazing, slightly seasoned, and crisped to a satisfyingly crunchy level. The scramble and toast were good but not outstanding, and the iced coffee I had was bold but not so flavorful. No matter, the meal was cheap, filling, and not a hassle to turn it into a vegetarian breakfast as is sometimes the case. I would definitely return on another trip through LV. I also enjoyed the waitress' demeanor and energy and hope she finds her happiness in food service or elsewhere.

I visit Vegas quite a bit, and try not to eat on the Strip if possible.  The Strip is a ""rip"" and the only benefit of eating at the Strip is I can use my comp points for mediocre, overpriced food.

Finding a mom-and-pop place like Coffee Pub makes the trip more enjoyable.  Its nice to just walk away from the clangs of the slots or the smoke filled casinos.

This Coffee Pub is tucked away in a desolate strip mall, completely on the opposite side from the other merchants.  Its next to an Embassy banquet type place, which I mistook for the Embassy Suites Hotel (its not!).  Its across from the Nevada Bank if that helps.

The place is small, holds maybe 50-80 people, cozy, with a few big table for groups.  There's outside tables for the pets (I guess?) or maybe for the smokers, though I am not sure of the Nevada laws regarding smoking near an eating establishment.

Prices are reasonable, and plenty to choose from for Breakfast/ Brunch/ Lunch.  Originally I was going to get breakfast but the sandwiches sounded so yummy, I decided to have that instead. I thought I ordered the San Diegan, but realized it was the Redondo, the turkey, bacon, avocado on sourdough.  It came with melted cheese, but I held off on the cheese. It comes with fruit, salad or chips.

Stephen had the huevos ranchero, and he said it had a good kick to it.

5919253,2011-10-07,0,0XEqyl_lVaJNHRKxNcjJZg,"Great off-strip location for breakfast or lunch!  Super delicious and friendly place to eat!  Convenient and plentiful private lot parking - no valets or hassle!

They have an outside patio, too -- and plenty of seating inside...without ever a wait.  When I lived in Vegas, I would come here 3x per week for lunch.  It's owned by a lovely couple who set a relaxed tone to enjoy, and have hired wonderful servers.

The menu is great, expansive (= lots of choices!)...and they will accomodate any changes or special orders.  My favorites are the soft chicken tacos, roast beef melt, the chicken tortilla soup, and/or any of their omelettes (served all day, get it with their great home potatoes).  They also have fresh baked goodies (muffins/cookies), and great coffees.  It's a winner!",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,1,1,4,Xw5JqoMl4s11GVBFQkBiTg

Pretty pricey for breakfast but maybe because a lot of business people go there. 

Service is better than other places I have been too.",kOqcNFcpDl3h8vFNJ7FwWA,0,0,3,fCxKeppBtpVn-if7Mg9ulw
5961157,2016-05-22,0,0XEqyl_lVaJNHRKxNcjJZg,Really solid place to get a very tasty and reasonably priced breakfast in Vegas.  It's about 10 mins from the main part of the strip.  Portions are very large and and French toast with the homemade whipped cream is amazing.  The service is a little slow at times but the waiters and waitresses are super nice.  The outdoor seating is wonderful and the menu is huge.  I could never fathom spending a fortune on a mediocre breakfast at any of the casinos when I can drive a few miles to the Coffee Pub!  Highly recommend it.,N79jKQHB-SHcZTyjh2Xgjg,0,0,4,E4krjZFHjcQpDFgUCGor7Q
