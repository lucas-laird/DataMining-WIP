29784,2017-04-25,0,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"Homemade noodles with hot, spicy broth is one of the world's greatest pleasures. We tried the uni udon, mad tiger udon (hot), and the takoyaki when we visited. Service was insanely fast and I have no complaints about the staff. Despite being Friday at 5pm, they weren't slammed busy and were very attentive about refilling drinks. 

The uni udon, which they're known for, was not to mine or my boyfriend's taste. It was sadly a little bland, with very little uni. You do have the chance to double up on the uni, but we didn't take it and kind of regretted it. The noodles were good but since it's a cream sauce, the whole dish was crazy rich. 

The mad tiger udon was amazing. I doubt I'll ever order anything else the next time I come here. The broth had a heat that really crept up on you, the pork was perfectly seasoned, my egg was cooked perfectly, and the noodles were chewy and flavorful. 

The takoyaki... Well I could have eaten three plates of it. It's nothing unique but it did have good chunks of meat and plenty of sauce with it. So good and a really nice presentation. 

Overall, I'd absolutely recommend this place. The noodles are delicious and the service was great. I'd probably stay away from any of their cream-based udon dishes but to each their own.",wkKnzTG93gutdDWJpjwDQQ,0,0,4,Q_SuHYxMKWEQ65vCN9AKvQ

130225,2017-05-29,0,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"I enjoy a good bowl of udon and MM is a great addition to the Chinatown in LV. This place specializes in udon and when a place specializes in one main dish, chances are it's going be good, or at least better than other places that focus on a lot of different dishes. I visited a few times and I rate this place high. 

We started with the Takoyaki appetizer. This is a favorite of mine. I've tried it in various times in festivals in Tokyo and the US. Some places have a good balance of flavors while some are overpowered by the sauce. MM gets it right with a good balance of flavors. However, depending on what udon you order, it may be better to have this while eating your udon or even after it. I'll explain later. 

Our group then tried 3 udon dishes - beef, shrimp tempura, duck. I had the beef. They are served in big bowls so little chance of spilling while you work through it. The presentation is great. The taste is better. The broth is quite subtle and clean. I loved it. The noodles were good and cooked just right. I prefer cooking it another minute for added softness but that is my preference. The beef was flavorful and the portion was right. More than other places. You won't feel underfed. 

Now back to the Takoyaki. Udon broth flavor is relatively light so if you order a shrimp tempura, it is a light flavored fare versus beef. Eating the Takoyaki starts your palette with a stronger flavor which can make your udon taste lighter than usual once you get to it. Some dishes may benefit from having the Takoyaki with it. Just make sure you taste the udon first. 

The location is fine but parking can be tough on a Friday. There are tons of parking but not enough to support all the establishments. Expect to park farther or make a few rounds. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place. I'm still working through the their menu and this place has become on of my favorites to visit in Chinatown.",F7Z9snvN8y2e-h5Twse7cA,0,0,4,qOU9IDIWJImXUA3NoJpsxA
196740,2017-08-13,0,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,It's hard to find places that make fresh udon noodles! Usually it's pre-made/packaged. You can watch them make it right in front of you. I saw this restaurant driving by and made plans with my family to try it one day. Only regret is not trying it sooner. Nice sized portions and fair pricing. We already made plans to go back. Oh and parking is not so great...there is parking behind the building. Looks like an alley lol but a lot of other cars were parked there as well.,VipUvXPYQ1ivoTB7j2BXaQ,0,0,5,JLAG6wEnaXhvyMzNZJMSrA

399453,2017-05-16,0,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"Marugame Monzo is one of those LA spots that decided to come to Vegas as well. I remember hearing about this place opening and the usual long lines and hype around it. The pictures looked good, and I was definitely intrigued by the concept as the udon I usually have is the simple noodles and clear broth. Came here for dinner with my girlfriend and the place was pretty empty for a Thursday. The interior is simple and clean with a bar facing the semi open kitchen and tables everywhere else. 

Service: Simple, friendly service. Nothing terrible but nothing memorable either. It's a local spot and they serve noodles. It is what it is. 

Starters: Takoyaki. Probably the best takoyaki that I've had in Vegas, came out sizzling hot on a skillet garnished with onion flakes. Looks trippy as the flakes move due to the heat making it seem like the dish is alive. Just from first impressions I could tell that this was going to be top notch and i was right. The takoyaki is very hot but the perfect amount of crispiness, sauce, and of course octopus. Generous with the portions too compared to other places but if I could I would have ordered 3 plates. 

Entrees: Sea Urchin Cream Udon x Seafood Tomato Cream Udon. Both were great and it felt like I was eating pasta sometimes instead of udon. I love the creaminess of the broths as well as the generous amounts of uni in mine and also seafood in my girlfriends. The noodles are thick just like udon should be, but also just the right amount of tender. It's handmade in house and nothing beats hand made noodles whether it's pasta, ramen, or anything else. I found myself done with my noodles pretty fast and wishing for noodle refills which I'm not sure if they had. Luckily my girlfriend couldn't finish and gave me some of hers. I still wasn't satisfied and found myself drinking the broth as well. Be wary if you're someone who likes extra noodles alot, but the quality and portions are there. 

Thoughts: I've never tried the one in LA so I can't compare but I can definitely say that I'm a fan and it's refreshing to see something different from Ramen as there's so many around town these days. I love the lightly Italian inspired yet traditional dishes and the takoyaki itself is worth a visit. Definitely a great addition to the local scene as my girlfriend and I could now debate between udon, pho, and ramen when deciding what we're in the mood for.",rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,0,0,4,bdm7G1aF57If8jKuWA-HtQ

499747,2017-01-03,1,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"Maybe I missed the memo, but not sure what all the hype is about.  Decided to check this new place out as I'm a big fan of all things noodles and saw this new place pop up.  Pretty disappointed I must say.  I ordered the duck udon (double portions for +$2 more) and my wife had the pork belly udon.   Note to self, the double portions is A LOT of noodles (and that's saying something for someone who always order kaedama at ramen places), but not double the meat unfortunately.  The ""soft boiled egg"" side added came out as a hard boiled egg, unlike the gooey, awesomeness, somewhat runny yolk that you'd expect.  Not really a coincidence when all the side eggs ordered came out that way?  Broth was OK, could be warmer actually, and definitely on the lighter side.  Duck didn't have much flavor though the pork belly was tender and good; you can't really mess up pork belly.

All in all, a lot left to be desired.  And with the wait for a table and price points (~$100 for four bowls of udon, one takoyaki, and four green teas), I don't know that we'll be coming back again anytime soon.",4vV2td4BgUmGJ8ozhwzOVg,1,1,2,cwZuyZgE9Rb51Lvr8LQeSA

765172,2017-01-10,0,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"Omg been wanting to try a place where they have udon, but our server this japanese lady spoke little english and suck at taking order and said you can't take out soup which is retarded. That you can't have the noodle in one to go and the soup in another. I ordered the Champon Soup since it was the one with all the veggie and seafood. She said it was chicken/pork broth and for the veggies just cabbage. She did not said it had mushrooms in it. When I saw pictures of it we thought it was seaweed. When we got it, the taste was over bearing of mushroom. Not good, I asked the lady if there was something they can do since she didn't even say their was mushrooms she was acting like she didn't understand and wanted to do anything about it. I had to ask another sever that actually spoke english. And explained to her what happened how the other server didn't say their was mushrooms and it didn't say either on the menu. Man what if I was allergic to mushroom what would have happened since the Japanese server didn't say it was in there. So this english server spoke to manager Yoshi that was filling in for manager explained how it was made and can't remove mushrooms due to they Sautee the veggies all together before put in soup. That it's already made that way. I did order just the plain soup which was good but man kinda sux cause its not like a noodle place where u can customize what you have in it. But the only thing that was good was the manager Yoshis customer service. He removed that soup off my bill and was willing to make a different soup but by then I was full off the plain soup..also the only other thing we tried was takoyaki and I guess you would just have to have a taste for it. Hey I can say I tried it but will not eat it again. Dough with octopus inside. Not sure might come back to try what Yoshis recommended but they need better servers that speak and understand english.

I dined in Monzo on a Saturday evening with my significant other. The parking is quite tricky and busy -- try parking around 99Ranch and walking over if you don't want to go through a web of tight parking spaces during their busy hours (5pm - onwards). Monzo was pretty busy around 6pm, but they got us a table for two within 5 minutes. 

I ORDERED:

CHICKEN KAARAGE - $5.50
The kaarage was juicy and delicious! 

TAKOYAKI - $7.75
It came out piping hot in a cast iron takoyaki plate -- so wait a few minutes to cool down. My girlfriend loved the takoyaki so much, she ordered another one. Definitely a must try appetizer here. 

BEEF UDON (double portion) - $13.95
** Extra Soft Egg - $1.75
This was a hot udon bowl with green onions and seasoned beef on top. The broth was rich, delicious, and not overly salty. It's pretty freakin' bomb. Their udon, of course, tastes fresh and has a nice chewiness to it. 

MAD TIGER UDON - $11.95
Spicy ground pork with chives, green onion, bonito flakes, and a soft boiled egg... all on top of a bed of perfect udon noodles. The special broth that you pour on top of it makes THIS dish. This bowl was heaven and my girlfriend regretted not ordering it with an extra portion of udon noodles.

The noodles were cooked perfectly and had a nice bite to them, while the cheese sauce was extremely creamy; with every bite cheese strands would have to be cut from the piece you just ate to the rest of the udon. I enjoyed the slivers of onion throughout the dish, giving it a crunch and extra texture that made the dish that much better. The chicken in it was cooked to perfection and gave good protein to the udon. The beef udon on the other hand, which my friend got, was delicious in its own way. The beef broth was tasty on its own and very flavorful. The udon, once again, was cooked to perfection and absorbed some of the flavors of the broth. The thinly sliced beef that accompanied to dish was also very tender and absorbed the flavors of the broth. This was the perfect dish for the current weather outside (which was cold and very windy).

But why the four stars? I gave them one less star for their appetizer. My friend and I shared the pork lettuce wraps and though they were delicious with a hint of spiciness, the lettuce wraps came already assembled and the meat-to-lettuce ratio was a little lacking.

Went with a party of three and ordered four different udon to share, the Miso Carbonara, Niku-udon, Tomato Seafood, and Ume-shiso. Any other visit I probably would have appreciated the carbonara and tomato seafood more but I was a bit sick so it was a little to heavy for my liking. 

The Miso Carbonara was not quite what I was expecting. There was a hint of the miso in the carbonara which was great. It's okay to eat in smaller portions but the cream based broth can become quite heavy. 

Tomato Seafood was a bit better to eat in terms of heaviness as it was made with a tomato cream based broth. Between the two special udons, I prefer this one more.

Ume-shiso and the Niku(beef) udon were fine. Nothing spectacular. What I do like is that the broth in the Niku-udon was Kansai-style (lighter in color and flavor). 

I think the specialty udons need a bit of work - the two we had were a bit too drenched in the cream and the attempts at the fusion of udon and Italian weren't quite working so well. Interested to try the udon gratin next time, but I may stick with the classics as it's hard to go wrong with them.

1304109,2017-02-10,41,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"Marugame Monzo is without any doubt, one of the most beautiful udon I've had in life! 

Come strong from L.A, they are highly known for their creative take on Japanese udon. The restaurant itself is located in the ever crowded, but fascinating Chinatown F& B complex, easy to spot thanks to their giant signage, but getting parking in the plaza was definitely a chore! Once inside, I noticed that the interior was just like the one in L.A. Simple and not much going on with the decor and details, mainly the major use of cream and dark colors- but somehow the simplicity appeals to me and altogether it creates such a warm and cozy ambiance. Unlike the location in L.A, the queue here was actually much friendlier, we barely waited over 15 mins on a weekend lunch! 

We came here two days in a rows and ordered:

* Takoyaki: This taste pretty generic, hence not the best I've ever had but nevertheless it was still enjoyable, slightly crispy outer layer with melty texture inside. They are quite generous with the octopus bits as well. 

* Miso Carbonara: If you're a fan of carbonara sauce, you're gonna love the creamy sauce in this dish. Perfectly executed, not overpowering and it's the udon that did all the talking here. Chewy and fresh, topped with bacon, the Miso Carbonara is one beautiful bowl of udon. 

* Sea Urchin Udon: Now, this is my HEAVEN. It is creamy, hearty, suitable for those who favors subtle uni taste. And if you fancy a bolder Uni taste to your dish, they give you an option to double up on uni for an extra $5. Winning! One of the most stunning bowl of noodle and I swear it has starred in a couple of my hunger induced daydreams :P.

Marugame Monzo is certainly not disappointing in any way, from the homiest space to the beautiful food, supported by friendly service. This is unquestionably one of the most memorable and best meals I've had in Las Vegas! Can't wait to be back and recommending this to you :)",9lU5zOPluc6Y8JZUL9nzsQ,52,50,5,uIfnYkE3LAJwBz8Q5qleHw

Came here with a few other friends and we were seated pretty quickly. Some of the items we ordered were the miso carbonara, takoyaki, Hot red dragon udon, tempura egg, spicy ground pork rice bowl and chicken kaarage.

Miso Carbonara (5 stars)- good size portion very thick and you could taste a hint of the miso. Very heavy dish but very delicious and filling. Lots of thick cut bacon and sauce. This is my favorite dish here. 

takoyaki (4 stars)- comes in a slotted skillet with 7 pieces. I thought it was neat seeing how fresh and piping hot it came out. Takoyaki pieces were still sizzling which was a nice touch. The takoyaki itself were good but some parts of the batter were still a little uncooked. All in all it was a good dish and I would probably order it again

Hot dragon Udon (4 stars)- comes with spicy ground pork, bean sprouts, and onions. Mirky broth that was pretty tasty when you mixed in the spicy ground pork. Good dish if you're looking for a soup with a little bit of spice in it. 

tempura egg (3 stars)- under salted and slightly cold. I wanted to try the soft boilded egg but I believe the eggs were made ahead of time and was not very warm. I was expecting a little more flavor from this dish. Probably would not get it again but was worth a try since it is a soft boiled tempura egg. 

Spicy ground pork rice bowl (4 stars) - This was a great addition to my lunch set. This is a very spicy dish so you will be drinking lots of water. Very flavorful. Make sure to mix the meat into the rice. 

I would come back to Monzo. Food overall is very fresh and the noodles had a good chew to it. If you're looking for an udon place in Las Vegas I would highly suggest this spot.",c55ONBsSZBfaUN5Uhy-qGw,0,0,4,_9wLGMM_wG_2IVeKIvo60Q

We came here on a Saturday night and the restaurant was packed. Maybe it was because of the 40 degree weather outside which made eating ramen very appealing. We had a party of 10 people and it was a little difficult to sit us together but the staff made sure we had a table together. What great customer service! 

Just like the LA location, the ramen is handmade and freshly made. If you are sitting close to the kitchen, you can see one of the kitchen staff making the ramen from scratch. It is not an easy process.

The large laminated menus he gave us were clearly laid out but without photos - kind of expert level. Los gringos needed a little help. I asked for and received a menu with a few photos and that helped us visualize the unfamiliar.

I went for the signature Uni Udon with cream sauce, it seemed one of the most interesting choices on the menu, and I was not disappointed. The uni topping was good uni, not bad uni. Bad uni is one of the most disgusting foods one willingly puts in one's mouth - if you've ever had that revolting experience at a sushi joint you know what I'm talking about. Good uni is one of life's great pleasures, an explosion of conflicting flavors and textures that would never cross paths in a God-fearing natural world, like lions and lambs frolicking together: fascinating, alarming, dangerous. Good uni.

The little one ordered a mushroom infused Udon, the broth of which I found to be the most savory and delicious of my family's choices. On another day I would happily order it.

The two middle sons ordered the same duck udon. Both reported the duck to be ""not super chewy & annoying, it was good, had good texture"", ""much more flavorful than chicken, doesn't need any additional flavour"", while they both found the broth a little dull.

Grumpy big teen ordered the chicken udon, a very safe & unadventurous choice that unsurprisingly underwhelmed him. Safe but sorry.

Wifey ordered some vegetarian something or other that she, too, deemed ""meh"".

The appetizers were a delight enjoyed by all. The pickled vegetables were salty, crunchy, quickly consumed. ""Interesting, new & cool"" said son #3.

The mixed tempura vegetables I described to my uninitiated kidlets as ""like onion rings only better"" were very well received. They ""had a lot of flavor, even better when dipped in the broth"". ""I loved those because they were fried and they were fried"".  Also eaten all up & very quickly.

Fueling this review and giving grumpy teenager the opportunity to drive us all home were the three small bottles of sake shared by wifey & me. The carbonated lemon reminded me of kamikaze shots in college, tart and sweet. A big hit. The carbonated blueberry winethat followed was not as big of a win, a little too frivolous for my taste. But it made our third personal bottle - a more traditional chilled white sake - all the more enjoyable. It was familiar, refined, sweetly smooth, restrained, strong, quiet.

1380579,2017-01-09,0,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"And along came the 3rd, 4th, and 5th visits... LOL Continue to return because i LOVE FRESH MADE NOODLES. i dont care what kind of noodles. udon, ramen, knife cut, hand pulled, whatever. XD 

Curry Udon is a hot udon in special curry-based broth with pork belly slices and onions. When ordering, i was expecting udon in a japanese curry sauce. When arrived, i was a bit surprised. The curry is ""thinned"" out with a broth making it not as heavy (which is great!). Flavor is nice. The pork belly slices are thin. Similar to thickness used in hot pot. 

Mentai Rice Bowl - Decent amount of mentaiko on top of a fresh perilla? leaf topped with shredded dried nori in a rice bowl. Tasty little appetizer (to share?) if you are a fan of mentaiko (salted cod roe). Good amount of saltiness which tastes great with a bite of rice. 

Udon Gratin is a cream sauce udon with chicken, onion, and cheese on the top and baked and served in a small stainless steel skillet. This might be the only thing on their menu, besides the takoyaki, thats served in anything else other than a typical plastic bowl/plate. As the name states, its udon gratin. similar to the potato gratin you may have had before topped with melted cheese in a creamy sauce. I do believe the portion of udon is smaller in comparison to any other udons they offer though. Its almost more of an appetizer size than an entree size. Flavor is nice. Creamy and cheesy. Didn't notice there was chicken as i only tried a strand from my friends. Quite heavy with the cream and cheese. Tasty nonetheless if you like heaviness and cheese. XD 

Wakame Seaweed Udon is a simple hot udon with seaweed and green onion. As mentioned. Very simple in their clean traditional broth. Great for the sick or not feeling so well. 

Duck Nanban is a hot udon with duck slices and green onions. First meal of the day, had double-portioned this as well. Simple traditional style udon topped with slices of duck. My only dislike of this dish is the duck was a bit thin. Not because I had ordered double-portion udon so it felt like i didnt have enough meat, but id prefer the duck to be sliced thicker, maybe double to maybe triple thickness of how they served it. Maybe because im used to roast duck noodle soup made by chinese. Just holds so much more duck flavor. Also had a side of seasoned egg (more on this later)

Hot Dragon Udon is a hot udon in Paitan Soup, topped with stir-fried bean sprouts, chinese chives, and spicy ground pork. According to google, ""Paitan Soup"" is a Cantonese white broth made with seafood and pork bones, similar to a tonkotsu broth in Japanese ramen. When i tasted the broth, it had reminded me of tonkotsu broth. Though they label it being spicy, but it was not spicy at all for me. Very minimally. May be spicy for the non-spicy eater. Decent amount of toppings. My mom stated this was a bit salty for her though making my duck nanban udon taste plain XD 

Mad Tiger Udon is a cold? udon with spicy ground pork, chinese chives, green onion, bonito flakes, and a soft boiled egg served with Special Broth (Hot/Cold). So this is a ""bukakke-style udon"" where its not in a broth but ""mixed/sauce"" style where you pour your sauce/broth over prior to eating and mixing. Different places may serve this differently. Some may combine the toppings and sauce/broth into 1 and have it separated or like this place, have toppings and udon in one bowl, and the broth/sauce in a separated jar. Oh guess its cold udon. (i copy those ingredients from the menu). When i had ordered, i was expecting a hot udon, not in a soup, but served with a hot broth/sauce. No wonder the temperature went warm when combined. Toppings wise was very similar to the hot dragon udon. I would have preferred the toppings and udon to be hot as well. After mixing, everything went to a mildly warm state. Flavor overall is not bad but not spicy as well, like the hot dragon udon. On-table shichimi is required. XD 

Tempura Soft Boiled Egg/Soft Boiled Egg - Literally a plain soft boiled egg either by itself or tempura fried. For some reason, i was expecting it to be flavored like japanese ramen places, with soy sauce, or something. Yolk doneness had varied the few times i had gotten this or udon had came with. Sometimes its a perfect velvety smooth yolk, sometimes more towards a hard boiled egg. 

Seasoned Egg (Daily Special) - Priced as the same as a soft boiled egg, this was a daily special the waitress had mentioned. As mentioned previously, maybe this was more similar to the ""soft boiled egg"" i had hoped for.... NOPE holy salty ! i dont know if this was a seasoned egg or a salted seasoned duck egg or something. WAO WAS IT SALTY ! Maybe it was more of an experimental item for them. If they had this and their normal soft boiled egg merged together, i think it would be good.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,0,4,n7rPwiwVynuvH8tvhaox2g

We had come for the opening and had been fans since due to the freshly made udon and great flavors. They now serve ramen BTW so check that out regardless of my opinion.

Staff was friendly and service was lightning quick today. Excellent service.

On to the food. Low key pretty much everything is good. The mad tiger is a favorite for the spicy fans (it's really light on the spicy side. More chilli flavors come through.). The duck nanban was nice. The duck was super tender. Great flavors. The miso carbonara has been a long time favorite here. Light and creamy. Really makes you feel good.

The item I had today, however, was the ramen. It was good! It was on the lighter side, though, almost too light. There also wasn't much of a salt component. Maybe a slightly heavier umami or the addition of a soy sauce component may be beneficial to the ramen. On the other hand, the flavors of the clam were very present and very forward. The clams themselves had a nice texture. The scallops were super nice to bite into, like little bits of surprise in every bite. Very good item, just needs a little more umph.

I'd say will eat again, but I'm a fan boy, and I've been back to this place lol",TZCPXnoK4UeUBrgH7oxxhw,0,0,4,-XeP606QNB6aCBe-GvKNEQ

I have to start with the excellent waiter service because they were all so attentive and super respectful and nice. They were all so prompt and checked in on us frequently, which I love because I hate being ignored or forgotten at a restaurant.

My love and I started with Sapporo on tap, an order of Tanuki Sake and the fried chicken appetizer. The sake was smooth and sweet and Sapporo never disappoints. But what did upset me a little bit was the fried chicken appetizer-- it was four SMALL pieces of fried chicken for $6. It was still absolutely delicious, it was just I couldn't justify the price with such a small portion. 

After finishing the sake, a waitress informed us that if we ordered another round of sake, we would get a FREE fried octopus appetizer-- and of course we obliged~

The bonus about this location includes no wait on a Friday evening! The location in LA has 1.5 to 2 hours wait on a Tuesday night! There was never not a line and it made me appreciate all that hard noodle kneading work more. 

Though it's the same establishment, I felt like the noodles here are a bit lacking. I'm not quite sure what it is lacking but something is missing. Perhaps it's lacking an umami feel that was left behind in LA? Or the water in Vegas is different? The noodles are still good but didn't quite give me that wow factor. 

My hubby ordered the mentai squid butter udon and the broth was creamy with squid and little fish eggs (mentai). I decided to venture from my usual sea urchin cream udon, which I know is fantastic, and try the hot dragon udon, which is spicy paitan broth with bean sprouts and ground pork. This is like a ramen bowl, except with udon. Both broths were flavorful and the noodles had a nice bite. 

The negitoro for the appetizer was delicious to eat and fun to assemble. The sauce to dip the wraps in had a wasabi kick. The vegetables and shrimp tempura had a nice hot dipping sauce. The shrimp tempura was slightly soggy on the inside; otherwise, everything was fried well. 

Though I wasn't blown away with the dishes here as I have with every visit in LA, it's still exciting to know they have another location now and when in Vegas, I have more noodle options.",3JJGEQ6nV3edLA9Aso2mNA,2,3,4,x0Bcd6f2JUE84pIyHn_YCw
1773262,2017-01-18,1,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"New udon place near Pho Kim Long and TruVape. The first time I was here , my friend and I split the miso carbonara udon (their most popular dish) and takoyaki appetizer. While the takoyaki was delish , I wasn't a big fan of the miso carbonara udon at all. The broth was waaay too heavy and creamy. I didn't like the bacon on top either. This dish may be for some people , just not for me.

I decided to give Marugame another chance today since I've been having a really bad sore throat lately and I thought a bowl of hot soup and noodles would be the cure. I'm happy I tried out this place again because I liked the dish I ordered this time a lot more. I ordered the beef bukkake udon (I guess bukkake is that you pour your choice of either hot or chilled broth over cold noodles). I really love the broth in this one and the noodles were nice and thick as always. You can definitely taste that their noodles are handmade. I added a tempura soft boiled egg to mine and I highly recommend getting it as a side. I never had tempura egg before & it made my bowl much more satisfying. My friend had the hot dragon udon and I tried some of his -- it wasn't too intensely spicy. The spice definitely still added flavor to the udon. 

Probably my only drawback would be that this place is more expensive than I would to pay for a bowl of noodles.. :( Cheapest bowl would be 7$ but that's just the broth and udon .. An actual meal would be around 12-15$+. Decently sized portions though and the food comes out quick. It hits the spot when you're craving something savory. Their customer service is excellent. If you don't know what to order , they're more than willing to help give recommendations or explain the menu more.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,4,3,4,CIqH309_ewKf1jCyII5G6g

I stopped by lunch and when I came in at 11:40am... The place was shockingly empty but I was greeted right away and sat right away as well. 

Ambiance was kind of cool as this is another hand pulled Noodle (udon is specialized here) place that has the chef pulling noodles to order. So it's a great place to watch the chefs at work since the kitchen is an open area. The set up was very clean and very well organized. The colors were a little on the dark side but I felt like everything worked very well together to make it an inviting place. 5/5

Service was ok... It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either. They gave us the menu and gave us a few minutes to look through the menu but it would've been better if we had gotten an explanation of the menu. It was not a large menu but it was a little confusing. I ended up getting the lunch special combo. It was basically a $3 upgrade to your udon order. With that extra $3 you got a mini rice bowl. It looked like a good deal so I got it. And it was. I'm not sure how large the regular portion is but this was $2-$3 cheaper by getting this deal.  (3/5)

The food on the other hand was yummy!  I got the Mad Tiger Udon... It was served in a nice bowl and it was garnished with the most perfectly soft boiled egg.  The soup for this was served in it's own little jug... Served very hot! Basically you pour the soup over and mix and enjoy!! :) The soup was hot enough to warm the entire dish EXCEPT the egg... Sadly it was perfectly soft boiled but when I broke into it and dipped it into the soup... It was cold. I left the rest of the egg sitting in the soup and by the time I finished the noodles, it had warmed through. So I would recommend saving the egg for last. The flavor was very good with bonito being the most dominant flavor with a decent kick. I love bonito so it was perfect for me. :) if you don't like bonito I don't recommend this for you. And if you do not handle spice well... This will be spicy for you but for me... It was very well balanced. (4.5/5) 

Beef slice mini bowl was a mountain of thinly sliced lightly seasoned beef that was melt in your mouth tender with just a hint of soy sitting on top? of a bowl of rice. It was totally delicious. This is a dish that I will be craving. 5/5. It was seasoned just enough so that when you had that perfect bite with a little rice and a mountain of meat on your spoon... It was perfectly delicious! 

And by the time I left around 1pm... The place was packed!!! So my recommendation is come early to not have a wait! :)",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,4,2,4,QqkVzlcawQlHfW8haSP_7Q

There is a new udon place around the spring mountain area as well, that to me gives you more bang for your buck (yelp at your own risk).

ACCESS: Went at 6:30pm on a Wed night with my family. No wait, though the parking lot was full. We looped behind the businesses to find additional parking. 

FOOD: A+. Well-balanced udon all around. I had the duck udon, and tried some tempura udon and vegeta-full udon. All really tasty and well-balanced. The duck was very well made - soft and tender. Tempura crispy and soft on the inside. Vegetable broth smooth and milky (seriously, we didn't know if we should drink it or not). We also ordered a tuna mini rice-bowl and it was good, though I'd say the udon is the highlight of this restaurant. Portion size is big! 

PRICE: Very well-priced for what you get. Udons range from $10-16, mini rice bowls $5-6. Remember, portion is big. 

SERVICE & AMBIENCE:  Service fantastic and checked on regularly. Ambience is very simple and clean. There's a nice cozy clean feel and it's not too crowded, not too loud. The kitchen is separated with a clear glass wall so you can see how they hand-make the udon noodles. Pretty fun!

Bathroom is clean so you can bet that the kitchen is clean too! And...it is because you can see them working in there :).

Staff was very attentive, service was quick, food came out quick, and overall very nice experience. 

We got Takoyaki and they tasted pretty good, nothing crazy special but served in a pot like how escargot would be served, kept it hot throughout our meal so that was a plus. 

Of course we tried the Uni udon which was good, but very creamy. My sister and I tried it but could not finish it, my sister ended up ordering a broth Udon which was really good. I got the carbonara, which I really liked. Also very creamy but I was able to finish it. 

I never thought that I could tell the difference between Udon noodles - but this place's Udon is definitely like no other, definitely fresh. The noodle itself is thick, chewy but also ""bouncy"" - not too chewy with that boiled dough texture. 

Prices for certain Udon can be overpriced - the shrimp tempura Udon was $13 for just the Udon and 2 pieces of tempura shrimp. I want to come back and try the pork belly Udon. I thought the broth was really delicious, served very hot, sweet and savory, not too salty and very light - perfect on a cold day.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,0,4,8nyuvUe_m3xv7CkW32yi2Q

We came in for lunch as my hubby wasn't feeling well and needed some soup noodles to perk himself up.

We ordered the champon udon, the kakuni udon with double noodles, and the fried chicken appetizer. We were told at seating that our noodles would take at least twenty minutes do it was advisable to order an appetizer if we were hungry. Overall the noodles came  before the twenty minute mark and actually less than 5 minutes after the appetizer arrived. Just FYI.

The fried chicken was kind of like a Russian nesting doll - you know that there is a small nugget of chicken hidden away somewhere in the heart of the fried overly salted coating. As crunchy as it was, I would definitely pass on this item.

The udon was pretty terrific with that slight chew of freshly made noodles. However both noodle dishes we ordered weren't without flaws.

The champon udon was supposed to come with seafood and mixed vegetables. The seafood in the dish was the worst kind - very minuscule shrimp with scallops the size of my pinky finger nail.I would have preferred more generous helping of a meat like pork or chicken. The stir-fried cabbage was also a bit bitter as well (also kind of surprised they stir-fried the cabbage as the champon I've had before is just cabbage cooked in the broth). The broth however was a good match for the noodles.

The kakuni (braised pork belly) udon sported the standard udon broth topped with some kakuni. Both the standard broth and the kakuni were bland which kind of ruined the noodles for me. When I scooped up some of the champon broth to eat with noodles, it was much better.

Overall service was good and the value is reasonable. I definitely would skip the fried chicken appetizer. I've all 3 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,7,2,3,rTI7Qly7f15RJzqSwBDlMw

service was very good!  the hostesses and the servers were all very kind and attentive.  i imagine they were from another mon restaurant because they definitely seemed more experienced than your typical new restaurant hire.

we had a couple of their ""signature"" dishes...

uni cream - not nearly enough uni flavor.  there are many restaurants that serve this same dish and they manage to capture that umami in a way that this dish did not.  so, although good, improvements can definitely be made.  the cream stood out the most in this dish.

carbonara - again, the cream.  so much cream!  a typical carbonara's sauce is created mainly with the egg yolk as the star but this one was basically an alfredo sauce with some bacon in it.  

curry udon - i have never had worse curry in my life.  it was actually not curry.  it was more like a mildly curried flavored gravy.  way too much starch, not enough curry.  tbh, i'd rather eat it at home with some frozen udon and boxed curry.

negitoro - so if you're interested in making your own handroll, go for it.  otherwise, skip it.  i don't really get the whole deconstruction of this dish.  i would much prefer to be served an already made handroll over this.

i would eat here again and try their more traditional dishes.  i really did enjoy the noodles themselves and would buy just the noodles if i could.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,3,2,3,ymdpBmQjJO5febWYYK_-rw

The Uni one is definitely more expensive on the menu. It has at least one whole Uni in the bowl, but the overall soup was a bit bland. Maybe it's meant to be that way so it won't fight with the Uni taste? Or maybe we had the takoyaki first and that's why we couldn't taste the noodle afterwards. Definitely picture worthy tho.

Simple decor and clean. Service is 5 stars. 
They have everything related to Udon. The udon is handmade from scratch. It will make a difference between homemade and instant one. Udon is perfectly textured (chewy). The bukake is my favorite. The soup is on the side and it has a bit stronger taste. Today, I decided to get Kake Udon with a side of Kakiage (vegetable and seafood tempura). The portion is huge, I am so full for lunch! 

Price is a bit high. Shrimp tempura per pcs is $2. Hot tea in a can is $3. The plain udon Kake is $9 (does not come with anything except green onion and tempura flakes). 

Recommendation: price is high compared to other udon place. They should have lunch special with price range $8-12 like Oodle Noodle. I paid $18 for my lunch today and that's too steep of a price for everyday lunch. Also, they do not have fresh hot/cold tea. Green tea is from a can which I find that dissapointing.

I ordered the Uni Cream Udon with extra uni. I love everything about uni - the texture, the briny ocean taste...all that. But the extra uni in this dish was a tad too briny for me. I think that without the extra uni, it would be perfect. But at least for the extra $5, you really get a lot of uni. Although fat noodles are not really my thing, I have to say that I enjoyed the texture of the udon here.

We also ordered the Miso Carbonara Udon. The miso gave it an interesting flavor twist. It was very good as well. The takoyaki was good but not special and the pork belly bowl was...well, blah. 

The service was fast and friendly and my water glass never went empty.",bfQrBM-vaLrNpfigHWRK1g,2,2,4,Zus7lr6_IMi8puCDl5rFtA

Word on the streets say it good..

Word was right..

I ain't usually a huge fan of udon, but marugame monzo would be pretty high on my list if I ever was to crave it. The interior is clean and stylish with a comfortable minimalistic modern feel to it. My favorite aspect is the looking glass windows around the bar seats where you can watch any of the chefs put together your order.

I got to try the hot dragon udon, and the miso carbonara. The hot dragon wasn't too intensely spicy which was good considering you don't really get an option to choose your spicy level, and the broth is a pleasant tang that almost slightly reminds me of a tom yum soup.

The udon isn't lacking anything either, it comes in a pretty decent sized portion, with onions, and ground beef. The miso carbonara had to be my favorite of the two though. It was more creamy and thick, similar to the consistency of an Alfredo. It was pretty thick and filling, and the bacon compliments the udon butter taste pretty well.

The signature bowls that we got was about 13 dollars each which is a little more pricier than I like for a bowl of noodles, but they have cheaper more simple udon options that go for about 7-9 dollars.

Parking can be difficult during their peak hours and the place can have a bit of wait time on the weekends, but overall I'd say its definitely worth a try if you haven't been yet!",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,4,1,4,0xtbPhXnT_CL9-cUdeVnpg

First of all, I'd like to say that I LOVE the employees here! They're so nice! And when you walk in, EVERYONE greets you! And when you leave, EVERYONE says goodbye. It's such a nice thing to see.

We went around lunch time on a Thursday afternoon and was seated immediately. Probably not super popular because it's off the Strip. But it's definitely worth it to go.

The Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps were great! I was also able to impress the Boyfriend because I could handle the spice - it's the kind of spice that stays in your mouth and you can't feel it in your throat. The lettuce was fresh and crunchy. I'd take off some of the fried rice noodles though.

For the main dishes, Boyfriend ordered the Miso Carbonara and I ordered the Seafood Tomato. Both were AMAZING!!!!!!! As someone else stated, the Miso Carbonara does taste like Bacon Mac N Cheese - which isn't a bad thing. And as you can see, the bacon strips are pretty big. And you can taste bacon in every noodle. The Seafood Tomato was great as well. I thought it would just have a seafood flavor in the creamy tomato sauce, but it definitely had seafood in it! And bits of tomato. It was served HOT and uber delicious. But I definitely regret not getting the Sea Urchin udon. If Boyfriend let me, I think I would've ordered 2 udon dishes for myself...

Thanks to the new opening of LA's Marugame Monzo, Las Vegas now has a place for fresh Udon Noodles!

I was a bit surprised by the number of udon offerings at Udon Monzo. The extensive menu includes no less than 27 different udons, ranging from Hot, Cold, and Bukkake, to their more creative Signature Udons. Some of the more traditional udons go for as little as $6.95, while the most expensive, the Sea Urchin Cream Udon goes for $16.95.

My love and I started with an order of Negitoro and Pickled Vegetables. The negitoro allows you to make your own mini hand rolls. I found it to be fun and worth the price. The Japanese pickles were good, but I'd only recommend them to those that know they like pickled root vegetables.

Then we were on to the main course...udon! We opted to try two of their Signature Udons: Sea Urchin Cream Udon & Hot Dragon Udon. The Hot Udon Dragon was great! Hot Udon in Paitan Soup, topped with stir-fried Bean Sprouts, Chinese Chives, and Spicy Ground Pork. It was warm and flavorful. I was a little disappointed in the Sea Urchin Cream Udon--Creamy Uni Cream Sauce Udon, topped with Ikura, and a Shiso Leaf. There was a healthy amount of uni chopped and mixed through the cream sauce so the uni flavor came through, but it was a little one dimensional. I prefer tomato cream sauces with uni. They actually have a Seafood Tomato Cream Udon that I think I would be more interested in next time. We were trying to order this dish and add uni to it, but the chef was unwilling to acquiesce to this request. Instead we order a Seafood Salad to eat along with the Sea Urchin Cream Udon. This is not a bad option if you're looking to incorporate more seafood into your uni udon. We ate some of the salad on the side and also added some of the pieces of seafood into the udon. It didn't alter the taste of the uni udon significantly enough...still leaving us wanting for the foodgasm we were hoping for from Marugame Monzo LV.

The space is nicely presented with dark wood contrasted against white walls and an open kitchen with ample counter seating in front of it. We will return...but I'm not sure we'll rush back. Then again, udon is not my most preferred noodle. Hopefully the bleak parking options keep the lines down...LA can have quite a wait for their udon, and I would certainly like to explore more options.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,44,39,4,Z05ACNKCgMaag0vKWzrslA

Freshly made udon on the premises. If you are here by yourself of with just one other person, sit at the counter and watch how udon is born--mesmerizing. I found it interesting that the layout of the place is the same as the LA restaurant, but it's actually more spacious here--understandable, I guess.

I got the Wakame seaweed udon, which was delicious, light, and really hit the spot. One great option was the mini rice bowl pairing. I got the ikura mini rice bowl ($4 extra) with tiny flakes of dried seaweed--delicious!!

If you're checking monzo out for their uni udon (like me) forgo it and enjoy a uni spaghetti from Trattoria Nakamura-ya. It's pricier, but so much more worth a visit than this place.

If you're in the southwest area and want noodles with seafood and a creamy broth go to Mamaoh. Order it without jalapeños if you don't want it spicy. It's called seafood champon.

After a long day at Universal Studios and driving back from LA, my friend and I wanted to end the night on a good note with something good to eat. Went to palace station first for oyster bar, but he saw that the wait was about 40mins. Neither of us wanted to wait so he called this monzo place, and they informed they close at 11. We got there 10mins before, leaving us plenty of time to order.

Right when we walked in, a female server greeted us and informed us to order before 11. We understood. She proceeded to seat us, but tried to right next to the only other table seated. Petty. I asked if we could sit one other table over....

As we're waiting for our food, she gabs with the kitchen staff.. which is fine, but it's an open kitchen and you sat me right in front of it. Instead of being discreet, she's talking loud enough for me to hear, ""I told her last seating was 11."" Then the kitchen and the rest of the wait staff turned to look at our table with discernment. Very rude.

5 minutes after our food comes out she jumps in to not check up on us, but to drop the check saying they're closing soon so pay up. We promptly followed orders and paid the madame. 

I couldn't enjoy the food (uni udon) because I felt like we weren't allowed to.

You can't be petty and self-absorbed working in the service industry. It's not about you, it's about the guests. If you don't want to serve passed a certain time then close earlier.. or go work somewhere else.",wu1aog5_q4Xv-1J7v0Jp6A,2,0,2,FvtDwH_PdXizS-35Zl7iGA

They seem to have resolved the issue of having the noodles cut too large and now they are just the right size and texture. The broth could still use a little more flavor but they are getting much better.

The service was friendly and very welcoming. When we entered we were immediately seating and we were given a quick run down of the menu.

I LOVED IT!! The homemade udon noodles were soft with the perfect amount of chewiness. The sea urchin cream sauce had depth in flavor and the udon noodles had generous chunks of sea urchin in each bite and it was topped with salmon eggs to help reinforce the flavor. The egg I got on the side was a bit of a disappointment because when I threw it in, it was on the cold side and it didn't even get warmer as I mixed it into my hot udon noodles. The cream sauce was so good, I didn't need the egg. And the portion here is HUGE!! I was surprised I finished it. I was so full afterwards but it was worth it.

I had never had them like this before though. Their noodles are very thick. Anyways, it's all about the broth flavor to go with the noodles. Marugame Monzo LV impressed me with their broth. 

For around $13 each, I ordered the Hot Dragon (spicy thin broth that reminds me of Thai cuisine flavor) udon soup & the Miso Carbonara (not too heavy but creamy). My boyfriend claims the portions were healthy, but when my soups came out, I already know I wouldn't be able to finish both. I guess they upped the portions? Either way, they were amazing. He ordered the Nigatori rice bowl (only $5!) & sea urchin soup (pretty heavy but yummy). I recommend ordering an appetizer or side to compliment your udon bowl still. 

One thing I wasn't fond of was the hot green tea comes in a can instead of a pot. Other than that, I will definitely be back to try other items. 5 stars also for the cleanliness & really nice, prompt customer service!

Vegas lost one of the best Udon restaurants around and many of students at UNLV miss you guys greatly. Best wishes to you all but if you choose to go back to Vegas PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!.

First off, let me just say that the phone number listed connects you to a realty company's answering machine. I checked on google and there were no other numbers for Marugame Monzo here in Vegas. I know I didn't connect to the wrong number because I tapped on it and called twice and both times I got the same recording. Since I was on the road, I decided to stop by and order a takeout. The parking situation there is absolutely atrocious! I had to park in a dingey area behind the building. The restaurant was busy, and I waited at the podium for a while ( a few of the waitresses seen me, but seem to pretend that they didn't) and It's not like the place is huge! Finally, a waitress asked if I needed help, and I told her I would like to order a takeout. She then told me that they don't do takeout...so be informed...the information on this restaurant needs to be updated on Yelp. Also, a young man came up as well to verify that they don't do takeout and they don't foresee doing it. They were both nice enough and apologized, but what a disappointment from the start! Since I travel a lot for my work, I do my eating out then...when I'm home, I like to enjoy eating in the comfort of my home.

Everything was so flavorful!  The udon was cooked perfectly.  My fiancé and I enjoyed watching the lady make fresh udon at the bar.

The mini mentaiko bowl was good... if only they served it with chopped scallions, it would be better - I'll ask for that next time.  The thinly sliced beef bowl was perfectly seasoned.  The beef just melts in your mouth!

Monzo LV to anyone! I order something different from the menu each time I come here and I've yet to be disappointed! They make the noodles directly in front of you which is fun to watch and even more enjoyable to consume. They maintain a specific level of humidity within a controlled environment to ensure that they always produce a perfectly uniform noodle. It's a very trendy new restaurant and one of my favorite places to go with my boyfriend and our friends lately! I'm impressed by their presentation and delicious, extensive menu. I've tried many of their appetizers including their Taiwanese pork and mentai onigiri; takoyaki; and fried chicken. I also tried their mini negitoro rice bowl which you can add to your udon for $4 as a lunch time special. Mentai onigiri is seasoned fish eggs on top of a rice ball with seaweed on the outside, takoyaki are little octopus balls, and the negitoro is fatty tuna; If you enjoy sushi, I'm sure you'll love any of those. The fried chicken is juicy and crispy! It's served with one lemon normally but I usually order extra. 
 I've tried many of their udons including the curry, duck nanban, mentai squid butter, clam vongole, hot dragon, kakuni, udon gratin, miso carbonara, seafood tomato cream udon, and the cold mad tiger. Each dish is very different and has it's own unique flavor. I love the thick, aromatic curry with thinly sliced pork belly! The duck nanban, shrimp tempura, and kakuni udons are served with a thinner, lighter brother but it's very delicious and flavorful. The flavor profile of these dishes contain a more traditional Japanese flavor compared to their popular Italian Fusion dishes, which are also very good in their own way! The big, fat slices of pork belly in the kakuni udon are full of flavor and very tender. These dishes aren't overly complex but the duck is very masterfully prepared and well thought-out. I also enjoy the grilled green onion in their duck nanban, they have a slightly sweet flavor. The squid butter udon is delicious too, they gave me a good amount of squid in addition to the fish eggs. The entree has a slightly creamy, light colored broth that I find delicious. However, my boyfriend wasn't thrilled about this because he isn't as adventurous in matters regarding seafood. He did enjoy the clam vongole udon! It's similar to a white wine clam fettuccine dish you'd find at most Italian restaurants with a Japanese twist added! It's very good but I believe it's only included in the dinner menu. The udon gratin is another Japanese Italian fusion dish. The thick udon noodles taste amazing in this creamy, cheesy dish. It's very rich and fills you up quickly. Their pasta inspired dishes have yet to disappoint me. The miso carbonara is amazing as well!",cJr-hmFCCQFhRHFtsyNB-A,0,0,5,CvOH4cS5CJ7NQqBtK8YiQQ

The restaurant is very small but it's clean and modern. All of the tables were taken except for a spot very close to someone else so we chose to sit at the counter/bar facing the kitchen. There was no line/wait. I'm glad we chose this spot because it was fun to watch the cooks make the food, especially seeing how they boiled the noodles. It was also much more spacious compared to the other cramped spot we were offered. 

Their menu has a variety of different ways/dishes to choose how you want to eat Udon noodles and I had the hardest time deciding since I wanted to try it all! 

My boyfriend and I ordered the Fried Chicken to share and it came out very quickly. They have this cute little shaker on the table at every spot with a spicy red spice in it, I shook this over my chicken and found it to be quite delicious! It had a little side salad with the chicken but the salad had no dressing on it whatsoever... I squeezed the lemon over the salad to give it a little flavor. The chicken was crispy, juicy, and tender but still a little wet from the grease... if you prefer all-white meat chicken - DON'T order this. It is all made out of dark meat.

I ordered the Champon Udon! The broth was a little thick but was packed with so many amazing flavors. The noodles were just perfect! But there was definitely a lack of seafood :( there were little baby shrimps that I had to hunt for and also tiny baby scallops that were even harder to find. 

My boyfriend ordered the Hot Dragon Udon and has claimed it as his favorite noodle soup he's tried in Vegas so far and we've had lots of ramen, Chinese noodles, Vietnamese noodles, etc. so I highly recommend this one!! Very yummy! 

Will we return?? Absolutely! The food was good, service was super quick, and the prices were very fair. I'm sure this place will end up being so busy they have a line out the door soon so I'm not sure I'll ever be able to return!",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,1,1,4,waw3PuMb9s5WPIFf45t7Iw

The takoyaki was exceptional as well. It came in a skillet sizzling. It's really hot so you have to wait to eat it for about a good 15 minutes.

Differences: 
- Vongole tasted different and had extra seaweed toppings and onions. Not bad but not what I wanted, especially since it's my favorite. 
- Fried chicken was bad. The waitress explained it was a new recipe and different from LA. Didn't suit our taste. Looked and tasted undercooked. 
- hot tea in cans, no tea by pot

Similar taste as LA:
- hand cut noodles
- cold mentai and beef udon 

Improvements:
- larger size for the beef rice bowl
- more clams for the vongole

Shrimp tempura udon +soft boiled egg: huge serving with yummy fresh udon noodles & hot broth. I def enjoyed texture of the udon noodles and how light and crisp the shrimp tempura was. Bonito flakes and green onions are a great garnishes to my udon bowl. The soft boiled egg came separatley in a different bowl which was weird because it was semi cold.

Carbonara: Why did i taste so much coconut milk? This was my boyfriends dish of course, he loves the creamy stuff. I went ahead and tried his udon, & oh boy was I disappointed. I didn't taste any miso, only alfredo mixed with coconut cream of some sort. I wouldn't recommend this dish, I'd just stick to the traditional hot or cold udon with broth!

I grew up eating a lot of it, and I just loved the thickness of udon noodles and the simplicity of the broth. But just like how I feel about KBBQ here in Vegas, the Marugame in Little Tokyo in LA tastes better. I don't know what is it. Maybe the ingredients there are fresher? But all in all, it's still pretty good. 

So far, I've tried the Curry udon, udon with braised pork belly, and the duck Nanban udon. The noodles had good texture, not too chewy nor too soft. The curry udon was flavorful, but I wish it was a tad bit spicier. I'll request that next time. The pork belly udon was meh, more so because the pork belly was not very tender. The duck Nanban was duckin tasty. I've tried the uni cream udon at the Little Tokyo location, but it's a little too heavy for my enjoyment. I literally KTFO after I ate that.

You definitely see and hear a lot about ramen places all over the place, but you hardly hear about the other Japanese noodle, udon.

The beef udon of course. Since I went during lunch, I got the lunch time special, which was the noodle soup with the small beef bowl with it, in which, I got the beef udon with the beef rice bowl. If you really wanted more food on the rice bowl, you can opt to not get the lunch time special, and pay the extra $1-2, which is what my dad did. 

My rice bowl came out first, and it reminded me of the iconic Yoshinoya beef bowl, which I enjoy, so to say the least, the beef bowl had be sold.

I liked my choice though in the end and would be back to try some delicious cold noodles.  And they have cup sake which is always a plus.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,6_EQVvA3I9YfOGbZqSBBoQ

Had a bite to it but slurp-worthy with its silky outer texture. Love love love. As for the broth and accompaniments, it was lacking. I ordered the Hot Egg Bukkake Udon. It came with the noodles, a soft boiled egg, some grated radish and some bonito flakes. I was instructed to pour the soup (that came in a little beaker) onto the noodles. 1. There wasn't enough broth for the udon 2. If it's going to be a soup dish anyways, why not just pour in the soup for me? Either way, I expected the dish to be more ordinary since it was pretty basic but the radish and broth just didn't mix. It was a strange dish that I don't really suggest ordering. The other dishes looked much better.  I also got a side small tuna rice bowl. It was minced tuna but it also felt so minced that it became really dry. I asked the eel sauce on the side and used it to add some moisture and flavor but it still wasn't a great-tasting dish. Another letdown. The service was great and the place was very relaxing but the dishes I ordered really put a damper on the mood.

3383766,2018-04-10,1,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"So was wrapping up a 3 night vegas trip and wanted to grab some food before hitting up the airport. I had been eating all types of food during the stay but was really craving some solid Asian food and after a quick yelp search was able to find Udon Monzo. This seemed like the perfect spot since I had not had Udon in a while so made my way over to the spot. Parking is free in the area and plentiful so there should be no problems on that front. The joint itself is clean and decorated well with spots at the bar to see the folks actually making the noodles as well as normal tables. The servers greeted promptly at the door and was immediately seated.

Opted to sit next to the window to see the chefs making the noodles itself which was entertaining to watch. After perusing the menu, decided that we were going to go with the negitoro, the carbonara udon, and the Uni Udon. There are more traditional options but I was curious so went down this route. The negitoro is a ""do it yourself"" type wrap deal where they give you seaweed, tuna, cucumbers, wasabi sauce, and sauce to dip into. The dish itself was absolutely delicious and I was a fan of the wasabi as it set my nose on fire. The ""soy sauce"" dip was excellent also offering good contrast to the wasabi making this a great starter. The two udons came out fairly quickly afterwards and the portions are pretty healthy here. I also think the fact that we ordered fusion udons made it more filling as it was ""sauce based"" making it feel heavier. The noodle consistency was good for both dishes and was to my liking. The carbonara was good and certainly I ate a good amount of it but it lacked some of the Asian fusion esque I was hoping for and seemed to be made in the more traditional Italian sense. Perfectly fine but a but just not as interesting as I was hoping for. The Uni udon was good as well but I was disappointed to not see pieces of udon in it. Both of the broths were a bit rich for me especially when that's all the table had so would definitely recommend ordering a non ""rich"" udon if you are ordering one. With this said, perfectly good and definitely hit the mark on solid udon.

All in all, a great spot in vegas to pick up some udon and I will be back to try some more of the traditional udons.",3Av38uh8aHDvZMV_1eojQA,5,3,4,wZIvhTbhgiixTKnfdtZN-Q

Ambiance was kind of nice as it's a great place to watch the chefs at work since the kitchen is an open area.

I ended up getting the lunch special combo. It was basically a $3 upgrade to your udon order. With that extra $3 you got a mini rice bowl. It seemed like a good deal so I got it. I got the Hot Bukkake Udon... It was served in a big bowl and it was garnished a soft-boiled egg.  The soup for this was served with a tiny jug and the broth was very hot.

In the former spot of Mr. Tofu is the bustling spot of Marugame Monzo. Replicated from it's successful LA location by the Mon group you know that you're going to get at the worst a decent place. Its very modern decor, dark wood furniture and white contrasting walls encasing the glass covered open kitchen. 

Udon know this but udon is my favorite of Japanese noodles, or maybe even of ALL noodles. Its austere appearance, square nature, and mild snappy texture is how it triumphs over all others. I'm the guy that orders Udon from the place that serves sushi even though I know it comes from a frozen packet and some instant dashi broth. 

Monzo offers the traditional classics such as kake, bukkake (don't google that), zaru and then some. Sometimes you need to please the foodie. These days if it isn't racking up likes on Instagram then you lose a lot of marketing. Maybe that's where dishes like the Miso Carbonara, Uni Cream, and Hot Dragon come from. The way the dishes contrasts on the photo may look great, but I think too much for the modest noodle. The udon doesn't hold the flavor of the heavy uni cream well, jiggling the sauce everywhere, better suited for its Italian cousin.

The tempura udon was some of the best I've ever had, even compared to places in Japan. Broth was savory and flavorful, noodles were chewy (handmade in house!), and the tempura was battered just enough to be crispy but also preserve the taste of shrimp rather than stuff batter in my mouth. The portion was sizable and I could not finish the entire bowl of noodles. 

The uni cream udon was also really delicious, though I prefer hot traditional udon. The cream kind of tastes like alfredo sauce, so this is an interesting fusion dish. 

The pork belly appetizer was outstanding! Comes with 3 large chunks soaked in some Japanese umami sauce -- a must get to accompany your noodles. Perfect amount of fat and meat ratio! (I love pork belly but don't like when the fat outweighs the meat.) This place does it right! 

I will 100% come back next time I'm in Vegas!!",VhbAKBGltxbdKOS6ZraZFg,2,1,5,stDNYKLFmcFJmC3fDGd0GQ

3825959,2017-02-09,0,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"I love udon and it is hard to find a place that have many varieties of udon. Then Marugame opened up. Depending on what time you go, they can get busy. Service is good, the waitresses would come and refill my water and ask if everything was ok. They even have a machine that keeps their green tea in a can and coffee in a can hot. They make their own noodles and sometimes you can see them pull it. There are windows/open area where the kitchen is. Our favorites are the fried chicken, yakoyaki and the miso carbonara.

Fried chicken: it did not have a lot of chicken but it was delicious. I would recommend to squeeze the lemon on top of the chicken if you like that.  

Yakoyati: comes out hot on a skillet. Wait a little bit before you start eating because it is extremely hot. They are crispy and you can taste and see the octopus inside it. The sauce compliments the yakoyati really well. They are also a good size as well. 

Miso carbonara: this is their most popular dish. It is a little bit more expensive. This is my favorite overall and it is what keeps me coming back. The broth or sauce is creamy without being oily. (I get a upset stomach when a sauce is too oily.) However, this udon is heavy. They also add bacon to the udon and who doesn't love bacon!

The workers were very attentive and helpful when it came to explaining their menu when our group said we have never been before. 

I tried the fried chicken (karaage) for an appetizer and thought it was only okay. Now the shining star of their menu is their uni cream udon. My oh my. One of the more memorable things I've eaten in the past few months. It was quite delicious. Very creamy and hearty. YUMMM! There's pieces of uni scattered in the dish. You can pay an extra $5 for extra uni but that would be quite expensive considering the udon itself is already $17. But the portion size is quite generous and I left feeling happy and full.

So yes to the uni cream udon! I also tried my friend's miso carbonara which was also tasty.

The menu features a number of different preparations of udon including hot, cold, bukkake (cold noodles with broth), or the flavor-rich signature dishes. While I found the texture of the udon to be perfect, the broths and preparations were very hit or miss. Of the signature udons, the miso carbonara was rich and flavorful, but was quite heavy with the creamy white sauce and bacon. On the other hand, I also tried the duck nanban, which had deliciously tender pieces of duck, but the broth was so light and lacked any flavor once the few pieces of duck were gone. Double portions of udon are an extra $2, but cannot be applied to any of the signature udons. 

Other than noodles, they also feature some traditional appetizers including takoyaki (octopus balls), and fried chicken. Another shortcoming of Monzo is the hot tea, which only comes in a can. However, the service was good and fast and I've never had to endure a wait for seating.

FOOD: I've never enjoyed udon until this moment. I would definitely come back to try all the udon dishes since all the noodles are made fresh. The place has an open kitchen concept where you can see the chef's cooking. You can see one person tirelessly working to make the udon noodles for hours while everyone else is operating in a harmonious manner to get all the dishes out and made to perfection. We ordered the following: 

1. Sea Urchin Cream Udon topped with Ikura (Salmon Eggs): If you love uni, then I highly recommend this dish. It reminded me of the Trattoria Nakamura-Ya uni cream pasta dish. The cream was rich, but not thick or too heavy. I enjoyed the saltiness of salmon eggs as they popped in your mouth mixed with the chewiness of the udon noodles and sea urchin cream. There's chunks of uni in the dish that was superb! I sprinkled a hint of the chili seasoning they had on the side to give it an extra kick as well. 

2. Negitoro Wrap (Chopped Fatty Tuna w/ Green Onions, Seaweed, Kaiware and Cucumber): I can eat fatty tuna for days! :-) You add the fatty tuna, green onions, cucumber and wrap it yourself. There's a dipping sauce on the side that is salty so don't go heavy with the dipping sauce or you'll miss out on the awesome fatty tuna flavors. 

3. Miso Carbonara Udon: My brother in law loved this dish. I on the other hand preferred the Sea Urchin Cream Udon better. It has a thick creamy sauce that is really rich. If you enjoy carbonara at Italian restaurants then I recommend this dish. 

4. Seafood Tomato Cream Udon: My husband ordered this dish! I cannot say much about it other than I enjoyed the Sea Urchin Udon better. I felt like it lacked flavor. 

PRICE: Our meal for 3 people with three udon dishes and one appetizer was roughly $60 with tip and taxes included so roughly $20 per person, which isn't too bad for the quality and taste of the food. 

Overall, I HIGHLY recommend coming here. I haven't tried all the dishes yet, but I am eager to try the cold udon noodles next time.

The second night we tried the Udon seafood tomato cream sauce, Udon Sea Urchin with salmon eggs (uni with ikura), side of soft egg & shrimp tempura,  braised pork belly and fried chicken Appetizers. Exceptional Udon flavors complemented with the perfect ingredients. The braised pork belly stands out from the fried chicken and shrimp tempura.
Definitely, the Udons were freshly made and the taste was amazing.
The prices are a little steep and portions are not filling, but respectful since their is no p8001 competition for the kind of foods they offer. Service was excellent and our patronage was greatly appreciated.

The menu was priced between 12-16 bucks a piece. I did get the extra noodle which is additional 2 dollars. It would be better if they lowered the price a bit because udon noodles are usually like priced between 8-9 dollars. Between two people ordered the noodles and it became like 40 bucks without drinks.

We were seated promptly, got our menus and was able to order off their lunch special menu which basically gives you a little add-on side for a few dollars more. As someone else mentioned, there's no explanation of the menu.  Better know what you're getting into before you go - you're reading up on it on Yelp obviously.

The place was pretty empty when we were there, and the amount of service was very minimal. So minimal that they didn't bother to clear any of our plates until we had paid and left. This was a little irritating so I started putting our empty bowls on an empty seat just to get it out of my way. Was never offered a water refill either. Service gets a 3/5

Quality of food and value - the make your own negitoro hand roll was a little disappointing. The quality of the chopped up ice cream scooped tuna was subpar and the fresh/real wasabi was somehow really bland. The ikura rice bowl was very lacking in the ikura department, also disappointing.  The carbonara udon was a very creative idea - but very very creamy for my taste. The uni udon was also creative and had a decently strong uni taste to it while also being decently creamy.  You see a trend here? 3/5 overall for food quality and value. I'd give them a 4/5 for creativity though because this isn't your typical authentic ramen joint by any means. Plus you get to watch the noodle making show.

I probably wouldn't come back here again. Overall value was not there for me and it was not worth the headache trying to find parking here.",wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg,1,0,4,RV9OzjkJ5yorQPIG-FezLA

I had the kitsune udon and my boyfriend had the miso carbonara, since it seemed to be popular on Yelp. We were warned the noodles take 15 minutes to cook (surprising, as they are a noodle shop) and the waitress suggested we order an appetizer to hold us over til then.
The cooking of the noodles looked meticulous. You could definitely taste the love in the udon noodles itself. Best udon noodles I've ever had... The fish broth was not too salty.

We got there around 6pm and there was no line so we were seated right away. The menu is exactly the same. I ordered the udon with duck inside it. The duck pieces were limited, but they were very flavorful. I indeed wish I had more pieces of meat. The broth was very rich and the udon was handmade! It was soft, chewy, and absorbed the flavor of the soup. YUMM!

We also ordered a pitcher of beer that was about 4 glasses and takoyaki as an appetizer. Be careful if you order the appetizer because it comes out in a hot pan!

I always like homemade udon, I had a great experience of fresh udon in Oahu, Hawaii and have been craving for it. So, when I saw the sign ""homemade udon"" while driving along Spring Mountain Rd, I knew we have to stop here for lunch.  So, we order the followings:
Takoyaki: Maybe it was served hot (sizzling hot), it was the best takoyaki I have ever eaten. The fried batter was literally melted in my mouth and the octopus was just the right amount of chewy.
Curry Udon: My husband ordered this one and he loved it.  I tried a little taste.  Curry is the typical japanese curry, not too strong.
Beef Udon: My mother-in-law ordered this.  I didn't try it. She said the soup was too oily due to the fatty beef (beef brisket) and kinda bland.  But she loved the udon.  So, not as perfect.
Seafood tomato cream udon and Sea Urchin cream udon: my daughter and I shared these two because we couldn't decided which one to get.  Both are very tasty. If you love uni (sea urchin), you will love the sea urchin one.  I have to say, these two are the best on the menu.
Miso Carbonara Udon and mini Ikura (salmon egg) rice bowl: my 6ft tall boy ordered this. He loved the miso carbonara, he said it reminded him of cream of corn, but on the heavier side. He said the salmon eggs were very fresh.  He barely finished the whole thing.
All in all, this is one great noodle place if you love udon.  If you haven't tried fresh udon, then you have to give this place a try. The place isn't big.  We arrived 5 min before opening so we got seated right away. But in no time, the place was full.  So, I advised you to go early.  Services were great.

I ordered the curry Udon (I got hooked a few years ago at Marukame Udon in Waikiki so I had to try this version) the noodles were perfection and the ""broth"" was more like a gravy than other places I've been and there were chunks of onion in the soup. It was PHENOMINAL! If you like curry, this is your dish. Period. My husband got the more subdued but artfully crafted shrimp tempura udon. The flavors were subtle and super yummy.

The takoyaki is served in a hot plate and man was it delish. There were 3 of us and we could barely finish it.  

Up next, it's Bukkake...Teehee to that word, but in this case, it's you pouring your own soup into your udon bowl and whatever you order from this side of the menu, you can have it hot or cold.

I got myself the ikura bukkake. Never had anything like this, but I do love noodles and I do love ikura.  The combo didn't sound to pleasing, but it actually tasted good.

I ordered the takoyaki to start off and boy was I happy. Our order came out on a sizzling pan and was hot. As the takoyaki touched my tastebuds, they were jumping with excitement. I think what really made it perfection was the slightly crispy bottom from the sauce touching the crackling hot plate. This is an experience you can't get anywhere else. 

For my main dish, I ordered the miso carbonara. At first I was a little confused (in a good way). I could smell the miso in the back of my mouth; it was the aroma. It was so nicely balanced with the creamy carbonara. I feel like nothing really overpowered the other; however, after an entire plate of the carbonara udon, it started getting salty. The portion of the of the food was nice because I think another bite would make it taste heavy.

Chicken tempura udon- My friend's order. She said it was not that great. The broth (which i tried) was lacking in flavor. Underseasoned I would say. Chicken tempura was 2 thins slices of chicken in tempura batter. No issues there.

Miso carbonara udon- What I ordered. In the reviews people had said you can taste the hint of miso. Unfortunately, i did not taste miso at all. Instead it was just drenched in alfredo sauce. I still had half a bowl of alfredo sauce in my bowl after finishing. Basically, this dish is more of just udon in alfredo. I don't recommend.

They even split the check for us at the end to make it easier for everyone. Thanks for asking them to do so Wilson.

When the food came, their presentation looks delicious. I tried it and it was really good!!! The potion is a little more for it to be worth $17 though. I suggest they should add more udon to the bowl. The broth is very creamy and thick. You can definitely taste the sea urchin in mostly every bite. I love it! The atmosphere was very crowded and loud since there were a lot of people. The service is a little slow though however the food is super good.

****Environment: The place is well set up, roomy and I love the view of the chefs in the kitchen preparing this awesome meals. The menus are nicely legible and laminated and the cups have these cool description on them in regards to drinking!

*****Food: The food here is mouthgasming great! I ordered the Uni Udon bowl, Takoyaki Balls and Pork Belly Appetizer. To start the appetizers were great! The Pork Belly was nicely presented and had a nice sauce drizzle not top. It was a little hard at some parts but mostly tender all around. The Takoyaki Octopus Balls, were nicely presented sizzling on a cast iron pan and topped with bonito flakes to give that moving effect. Lastly, the Udon bowl was delicious with thicker consistency than your normal broth but it paired well with the Uni. It was almost like a fettuccine consistency, but definitely recommend!

****Service: The service was friendly and prompt. They came by to check often and even was nice when we decided we wanted to order more and recommended some dishes for us to try. The only think I have to say is that, they did not however open the beer we ordered for us, which is why I couldn't give a full star. 

Overall, I would definitely return to this place and recommend to anyone who is visiting Las Vegas or is a local there!

We tried the beef tataki appetizer and it was soooo good!! I could eat 3 plates of that all by myself. *insert heart eye emoji here*

I got the miso carbonara udon and it was rich and a bit heavy, but a good kind of heavy... if that makes sense! It tastes like carbonara, but with udon noodles. Pretty self explanatory. Nothing special IMO, but it's not bad.

My brother got the curry udon and it was bizarre for me, but it's probably because I'm not used to it. I thought the meat in the dish was chicken but it turned out to be bacon, so that was also weird. Not a fan of this one and wouldn't order it again if I came back.

My friend got the shrimp tempura udon and it was just udon in the classic broth (I'd assume) with shrimp tempura. Pretty simple and I think she said it wasn't a memorable meal.

Overall, the three of us agreed that we weren't satisfied with our meal. Like that feeling of ""ahh, we ate good tonight."" We also agreed that we wouldn't come back to this place again (but I think I'd come back for the appetizer).",tqCGsK9HfX59DhkXzW-tTw,2,0,2,cdCcpVqb0IzMpM9SQRUe_g

With so many ramen shops opening up in Las Vegas I was beginning to wonder if there'd be any other specialty noodle restaurants like The Noodle Man.  Thankfully Marugame Udon opened up after expanding from LA!  

The restaurant is spacious and has plenty of seating at the bar area.  I love sitting there and watching the cooks make the noodles.  I love how the servers greet you as you come in as it's those little things that take you back to Japan.  

My partner and I started off with the Takoyaki (octopus balls) and then ordered the Kitsune Udon and the Hot Dragon Udon.  

The Takoyaki was phenomenal.  Please refrain from sticking the whole thing in your mouth because you will get burned!  Take a bite, sit it on the plate, and then split it open so it can cool down.  You'll enjoy it a lot more.

The Kitsune Udon was something that I ate a lot of in Japan because it's cheap and it's served everywhere that serves Udon.  It was good here too, but I just wish the soup was hotter.  Oh, and I didn't realize that bean curd is the same as tofu.  I heard others saying the same too which is why I had to mention it at the top of this review.  The tofu was good though.

My partner offered the Hot Dragon Udon and enjoyed it.  She is a noodle fanatic and enjoyed the Udon.  WARNING: the Hot Dragon Udon is ACTUALLY kind of hot.  I never ate anything spicy in Japan as literally nothing there is spicy, but this Udon actually came with some heat.  Her big thing too was wishing the soup was hotter temperature wise.

I hear it's a popular spot in LA and that there's usually a 45 min wait.  Luckily there's no such wait here, at least on weekdays.  Give this place a try when you're in Chinatown and try the Takoyaki!",9S52XHEyrvOv4OZxU6pCLw,2,1,4,MACI9qrOctQspK2_3NISjA

The Negitoro wrap with was chopped fatty tuna, served with daikon, cucumber, kaiware, soy sauce, and a wasabi-jalapeño sauce with nori slices. It was light and delicious however I wish they had given a few more toppings to plump up the wraps as they were the size of thin cigars. I also would have liked more wasabi-jalapeño sauce served with it. We also got the Kakuni pork belly to start. It was not what I expected as it resembled smoked kalua pig (Hawaiian smoked pork). It was tender and delicious, but I think it could have used some sort of additional sauce just to add a little more. It was very delicious though. 

For our entrees we order the Miso Carbonara and the Udon Gratin. Both Italian-Japanese fusion dishes. The Miso Carbonara was absolutely on point! The sauce was creamy with hints of Miso--def the bomb.com. Topped with bacon, thin strips of nori and pepper. The udon was perfect. 

The waiter set down the Hot dragon udon by mistake (instead of the Gratin that we ordered) so when we let him know, he apologized and had the kitchen whip up the Gratin as quickly as possible, and let us keep both! So we started with the Hot Dragon. It was was bombtastic too! A little on the spicy side for me, but my bf loved it. When they brought the Gratin out (so cheesy) it was a smaller size but still delicious. Total Italian dish, we finished that and ended up finishing the Hot Dragon too. It was that delicious. Portion sizes are nice but def recommend appetizers too. This is probably going to be one of our new favorite spots to eat at! Yum!

Service:  Service was good.  The people were really quick to take your bowls away but a little less quick at refilling your water cups.

Food:
Mushroom salad 4 stars - warm bed of buttery asian mushrooms on salad.  Interesting concept as the dish is hot and cold.  The mushrooms wilt the lettuce a little.

Takoyaki 4 stars - this one I think is deep fried.  Its for sure not made fresh but it was still decent.  Big pieces of octopus and it was very creamy inside.

Miso Carbonara 4 stars.  Its there most popular dish.  Do not order however if you don't want anything heavy or you don't like cream sauce.  The dish came with 3 small pieces of bacon.  It was a little soggy.  3 pieces was enough for me though because the dish was so heavy.  Flavors were good but by the end, I was struggling to finish.  The noodles are cut very thick as well.  I think this dish had great flavor but I'll opt for something lighter next time.

Pork Belly Udon - 2 stars.  My friend ordered this and didn't really enjoy it because the pork belly was tough and not tender.

Shame on me, I have never heard of Marugame Monzo in LA, but I can assure you this Vegas location is bomb!  Located near the beginning of Chinatown on Spring Mountain, it shares the same plaza as Pho Kim Long and Lee's Sandwich. Good luck finding parking.

As much as I love the curry udon from Marukame Udon in Waikiki (a meal I miss too often), I went a more simplistic route and got the Shrimp tempura udon.  The broth is amazing and the noodles were perfectly al dente. Noodles with a little bit of chew are way better than soggy, overcooked noodles.  The shrimp tempura here puts those wimpy ones you get at sushi restaurants to shame. 

Then there are the more sauce based dishes on the menu, like miso carbonara, squid ink, and uni.  I liked the miso carbonara, but it wasn't amazing.  A friend recommended the mentai squid butter and uni cream udon she had in LA. So, I will try those next time! 

It's nice to have another late night option in the area and refreshing to have something else besides pho or ramen.  Service was perfect and restaurant was very clean and welcoming!

5094741,2017-01-15,19,R9gRb3T8t-eIKlOtMPShuA,"Incredible udon and incredibly high prices.

The udon, made in house.  Thick, glutinous, toothsome, springy, slippery, neutral flavored noodles in a dried fish based broth.  Gentle umame from the natural glutamates of konbu add a hint of smokiness, soy sauce the requisite salinity.  A sprinkle of green onion and tempura flakes.  Kake udon.  Done.

Definitely a good bowl of udon but at $7?   70% higher than expensive Hawaii and nearly double typical Japan prices.  Still, cheap eats by anyone's standards.

Variations sampled included a kakuni (tender but over braised pork in sweetened soy sauce), duck (simply seasoned, cooked medium well with properly rendered fat), and beef (thinly shaved, hint of soy, overcooked)  udon.  Adding the small amount of protein makes for a more complete meal but the hot broth rapidly overcooks the proteins.  If meat is what you need, order them as a starter and a basic kake udon.  The broth is the same and the proteins will be properly cooked without adding an oil slick to the broth.
 
That said, neither the duck, kakuni, or beef tataki are that special though no complaints.

Cold udon, emphasizes the texture of the udon, a very good, somewhat citrusy dipping sauce.  Refreshing.  

The piece de resistance, uni cream udon with extra uni.  Orgasmic!  Heavy cream flavored with smashed uni, envelopes the udon.   The pile is topped by a shisho, more whole uni and ikura.   Warm, creamy, oceanic in all the right ways.  The cold topping adds a fresh boost of oceanic brininess.  Whoops!  Ahhhhh.... TMI.

With all the hype there is always that worry that the restaurant would not live up to the hype, but this was not the case.  I have been to the restaurant on several occasions for both lunch and dinner.  The restaurant feels spacious compared to other popular Japanese restaurants in the area and the service is great.  Every time I have ordered the food comes out quickly (sometimes the takoyaki takes an extra 10 minutes, but totally worth it)

Here goes the rundown of the food

Lunch Special Experience:
Zaru Udon 7.95 - healthy portion of perfectly cooked cold noodles with dipping sauce that you can flavor as you like.  Great for the hot Vegas summer days

Negitoro Rice bowl +4 - During their lunch service you can add mini rice bowls for an extra 3 or 4 dollars.  I added the tuna bowl and it was just the right portion of a different flavor to go with the meal 

Double portion +2 - I would definitely take advantage of the double portion of noodles for an extra 2 dollars.  You will have so much excess dipping sauce, so why waste all of its deliciousness?

Dinner:
Sea Urchin Cream Udon 16.95 - This is probably one of the most instagramed dishes at this chain of restaurants.  Not only is it gorgeous to look at it is delicious.  The creamy sea urchin sauce is to die for and it is worth every cent you spend on this splurge.   Just writing about this dish makes me want to go back and order it again.

Sides:
Takoyaki - Careful they come out really really hot.  I admittedly have burnt my over eager tongue on this dish once...maybe twice...before.  They are super flavorful and the moving fish flakes are always a crowd pleaser.

Lettuce Wraps - Another great appetizer choice.  The wraps are the  perfect sized meat + crunchy noodle filled lettuce cups to keep your growling stomach at bay while you are waiting for the main dishes to come out and they are easy to share if you come with a small group.",QfFQvV6tcSg2cnbZORK3sg,1,1,5,SrT-Be2Ux2ZUeXLm1eEOLQ

The dressing was very light but still able to flavor the whole salad. We had the fried tofu with a lot of daikon radish. The tofu was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft in the center.

I ordered the lunch combo which came with an udon entree, and a small bowl of rice with my choice of meat. I decided to go with the cheesy udon with seafood accompanied by a pork belly rice bowl. My girlfriend went with the uni udon dish. 

The cheesy udon came baked with the seafood. Be warned, it is EXTREMELY cheesy. The cheese flavor is quite light however despite how cheesy it is aesthetically. Not too salty, which I liked. However, the cheese flavor gets a bit overwhelming after a while. The pork belly bowl was good, but a bit on the saltier end. Thin cut slices of pork belly, so don't expect the thick cut. 

The uni udon was probably my favorite dish. Not a big fan of uni, but the flavor went nicely with the rest of our orders. The sauce they drenched the udon in was very flavorful, and helped balance the taste of the cheesy udon. They are also quite generous with how much uni they served with the dish.

The noodles were excellent, great texture and the sauce was pretty flavorful although i did not taste much miso. The dish had bacon in it but not enough, and in addition the bacon needed to be crispier and maybe in smaller pieces for more even distribution. It was essentially a carbonara but with udon noodles which could have benefited from a bit of cheese like parmesan. Overall decent flavor but not sure i would return based on the miso carbonara.

I added a second star to this review because the food was delicious and I could see it being made while seated at the viewing window. My server was nice as well, but the cashier flubbed my check.

Pros: Delicious food, inexpensive, nice server, great appetizers

Udon Monzo located in a strip mall, a little tight, and had to wait about 20 minutes before we got seated for our party of 8.  The service was friendly and fast.  The tables, chairs and the overall location was clean. 

They have a great variety Udons to choose from, everything from soup based to dry.  The quality of the food was delicious, simply the best Udon I've experienced.  The quantity of the food was plentiful too.  The others stated the Octopus Balls is a must eat.

Okay now to the big stuff...the bathroom.  :) The mirror was dark, like if it was tinted, had I been a little darker in complexion I would not be able to see myself.  The music in there was too loud, a quality bathroom one must be able to hear every drop, fireworks, splashes of every movement.  It was quite dated but very clean, the flush was on par with a common house toilet.

Tried it again two more times on other separate occasions and its pretty dead now.
That alone proves something is wrong.  Here is what I think is wrong.

Prices are high for the small portions.
Don't let the huge bowls fool you.  There is not much in there.
So what am I comparing to?  L.A. Tokyo Town.
Better prices, larger portions.

Drinks are wack.  Outside of regular soda that you can get anywhere they have calpico.
No I'm not going to drink Sake at an Udon house.

When you look around,  EVERYONE is drinking water.
Not because we're health conscious, its because the drink selection is TERRIBAD.
When you ask for hot tea,  IT COMES IN A CAN!?!?!?  really!?  isn't that toxic to heat a can?

I personally prefer udon, but you're really better off taking your business up the block to Monta.  I truly hope management reads this and makes some changes.

Lastly the staff is all up on yo grill when its time to order, but then stop serving you when you're waiting for change,  it was so obvious they expect me to get sick of waiting so i'll just leave a huge tip.    Jokes on them,  I ended up taking back the 20's and leaving close to exact change.

I don't know if they make those noodles in-house, but they had a nice chew, and the broth was somewhat creamier, with clams and bay scallops.

I got the creamy tomato udon and the bowl is huge. However, the actual food is about 40% of the bowl so the bowl is just to make it bigger than what it appears. This establishment also has a lunch special (I believe 7 days a week!) which is a bowl of udon and a mini rice bowl for 3-4$ more. The mini bowl is again about 40-50% the size of the regular bowl. My husband got that and he said it was a good deal for those who have a hearty appetite.

I was so excited that I went to their soft opening. I liked their product so much that I've gone at least 4-5 times afterwards. 

I have actually gone to their Los Angeles location once before so I'm quite familiar with what they have to offer. They are known for their ""signature"" udons, which are on the contemporary side. They have signature dishes such as uni udon, miso carbonara udon, and mentai squid butter udon. 

I've tried a majority of their traditional udon. I've had their wakame udon, chicken tempura udon, duck udon, beef udon, mentai squid butter udon, curry udon, miso carbonara udon, and udon gratin. 

My favorite, by far, is their duck nanban udon. I actually prefer the traditional styled udon because I like my udon in hot soup. Their duck is well flavored and goes very well with their light soup base. I just wish there was more duck though. 

Their udon is the star of every dish. Honestly, no matter what you order, their udon would be the same. After dining at Marugame so many times, every single time, their udon was consistent in texture. The shape may not be consistent since their udon is done by hand but everything else is consistent.

If you are lucky enough, you may catch them making the udon through the glass. In fact, sit at the bar so you're able to watch them cook! 

Also, if you're super hungry and you are a big eater, you can double your portion. What does that mean? You get double the udon! Not the meat though which is quite unfortunate. 

I think my only problem with Marguame is that their signature udons can get a little on the heavy side. Of course it would be heavy because a majority of them are cream based but I just wished they took a step further to create a signature dish that has those star ingredients, such as uni, that isn't cream based. 

There's still a lot on the menu that I have yet to try so I do look forward in going back to Marugame and trying them one by one.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,2,4,qxX06Fm5V7oDZxnpztQWgw

Both were very good, got a side order of pickles the acidity goes well with the carbonara udon. 

The two udon and two soft drinks came out to be $43 that's with tip and tax and an order of pickles.

Negitoro Rice Bowl - The fatty tuna was fire and was a great small app...

Curry Udon - I'm a huge fan of Japanese curry however this dish fell short with a strange aftertaste....

Miso Carbonara - Basically the go to dish....dish was fire and worth getting over and over....rich and creamy (pause)...bacon added the saltiness and elevated this dish to umami.

Since it was open on Christmas day, my family and I decided to try this place.

When we got there at 11:35AM, the restaurant was already filled with people even though it just opened 5 minutes later. I am not sure if it is due to its popularity or how it was open on Christmas day, but you should definitely prepare to wait for both your seating arrangements as well as your food. 

After our orders were taken, it took around 30-40 minutes for our meals to be prepared. I understand that the restaurant was filled, and there were a lot of other people's orders to be taken, but I did not like how our meals were given at different times instead of all at the same time, which explains why I took one star off. 

However, I give four stars from my review for the food! The food was delicious, and I am definitely coming back to try their other dishes.

I did not try the uni udon (sea urchin) because I'm not a fan of uni, but presentation looked good and my friend enjoyed it. The miso carbonara was creamy, soft, and flavorful. It's a heavy meal and I never had creamy udon before this. Reminds me of a Japanese fettuccine pasta. The beef udon (hot soup udon) was the type of udon I'm use to. Broth was good and noodles were soft and delicious. Overall, I'm glad I tried this place out, it was a good experience and service was good.

The kakuni udon had 3 big pieces of meat, but honestly this is too rich for one person to eat. I would not order that again. The dragon udon was spicy and had a lot of red chili oil in it.

On my first trip to Monzo Udon I decided to try traditional broth and tempura accompaniments including shrimp and chicken.  The broth is light and full of the tempura flakes that give extra texture.  Love how the tempura items are brought separately so they don't become soggy from being in the broth and there is the perfect balance of crunchiness with the tenderness of the tempura contents.  The Udon noodles were the right texture and cooked to ideal firmness.  If tempura isn't your style I recommend the Champon Udon that is seafood based with veggies in a lighter broth.  The monzo salad is also refreshing with a thousand island similar dressing, maybe slightly salty for my taste but overall very tasty.

My family and I were super excited to try this place out. I mean those pics of the carbonara udon looks sooo good!

We get our table which took way too long for a place that wasn't packed. We go on to order our drinks, which was just water and a green tea. When the drinks came the ice in each cup was more than half way melted. Has me wondering why would they serve it like that? I mean the water wasn't even cold. We then go on to order our dishes and this is where the problem started. I ask for my daughters noodle to be in a separate bowl from the miso (weird I know but my 3 year old likes it that way.)

The udon was definitely the star of the dish. It was extremely fresh and chewy! This was my first time trying hand pulled udon and I am in love! The cold beef bukkake udon was very unique as well.

Q: Why did the Udon noodles stop drinking?
a: They wanted to be Soba!

Upon first bite, I knew what my 600th review would be on. What a crazy delicious lunch. Did we over-order? Of course we did! But I've been wanting to try this place for forever and a day so I got all the bites I've been craving.

For starters, we had the Takoyaki and it was the best takoyaki I've had like no joke. Feeling sleepy in Sin City? Let your arm accidentally brush up against this screaming hot pan and it'll wake your ass up! I loved how hot it was though because it gave the sauce a chance to caramelize and form a crust around the takoyaki. The pieces of octopus itself were generously large chunks. Eat it fast if you like your takoyaki gooey. If not, give it a few minutes to cook longer in the pan. You get seven takoyaki so share with the table! We also had the fried calamari and those were okay. I could have done without it though.

Sea Urchin Cream Udon and Seafood Tomato Udon were also order. We were recommended to get a soft boiled egg topping which I ended up not touching. The egg was served cold from the fridge so I already wasn't feeling the $1.50 addition I let the server talk me into. But dat uni cream sauce doe. That cream sauce is thick like Hilary Duff 2017. Aw yis. It was rich and decadent. The sea urchin cream sauce coats your mouth and kicks you in the mouthpants! Get an ikura/salmon egg in the bite and it's an explosion of oceanic flavor. It gives your dish an extra note of brininess that lingers in your mouth. It was ridiculously addicting. The bite of Seafood Tomato Udon I did try was good but I couldn't pull myself away from that Sea Urchin Cream Udon. That dish is haunting me in my dreams. Mmm! 

And fresh made udon in-house? Uh, yes please! They were neutral in flavor while being perfectly springy with great elasticity, soft and chewy with a smooth texture. It really held the sauce well. It was udon perfection!

I'm glad to have tried this place and it's going to be hard to force myself to try other places with this place serving up the best takoyaki and an amazing bowl of sea urchin cream udon. Staff is friendly, parking is a nightmare [as per usual for Chinatown], and they sell alcohol. 5 million stars!

The noodles are made in-house and they have a nice chewy texture to them.  There are quite a bit of udons to choose from, but seems like the most popular ones are Miso Carbonara and Sea Urchin Cream.  These sounded a bit too rich so my wife and I decided to go with Mad Tiger and Hot Dragon instead.  Both of these are considered spicy but I didn't feel much heat from either one.  Between the two, my wife and I both preferred Mad Tiger.  It's a dry udon served with hot broth on the side.  I thought it was going be similar to dipping ramen, but the broth came in a small pouring container rather than in a bowl.  I just poured little bit of broth on a spoon and ate it together with the udon noodle.  The broth was pretty tasty and quite concentrated in flavor.  This udon came with spicy ground pork, green onion, lots of bonito flakes, soft boiled egg, and dry seaweed.  There's also a cold version of this udon but the ingredients are the same.

Hot Dragon came with similar ingredients as the Mad Tiger but this one came with regular soup broth.  I thought the broth was a bit light and not spicy at all.  It was still a good udon, nonetheless.  

This place also has a small selection of rice bowls and appetizers, as well as sake, beer, and wine. 

For lunch special, this place offers udon and rice bowl combo for $3-$4 extra.

Slowly but surely we got an influx of ramen shops however still lacked an udon place. To satisfy my udon cravings, we would have to hit up marumake udon several times on our trips back to Hawaii. Thankfully now all I don't have to travel all the way back to Hawaii to get my fix! 

I've always felt that udon is like the wallflower stepchild of the noodle family that is always forgotten about. Sadly most people never realize how awesome and unique udon really is... 
Enough story telling and analogies, let's talk about the food here. 
First off, you will notice that they do the noodles in house here!  Really and truly the noodles are the crown jewel of this place. Yes, there are a few other places that make noodles in house but they well all ""ok"". The noddles made here are top notch and on par with what you would get at marumkae (in Hawaii) or any other udon-ya in the motherland. 
My default order is the curry udon. I also like to add a little of the thin sliced gyu niku to make it my own creation. The curry udon as a dish is a delicate dish to make ( don't scoff at me) as too much broth you lose the essence of curry and the opposite when there's too much curry; you end up with curry noodle slurry. The curry udon was very well put together here. 

For the lady I ordered Bukake udon. This is the purest udon experience that you can get... it's a bowl of simple broth and it allows for the fresh noodles to be the Star of the dish. 

The only knocks that I would have on the food we ordered was the kakeage was just to oily and the tempura flakes were serve to us were actually Panko flakes ( yes I can tell the difference). 
My assumption is that they pulled the kakeage from the fryer and plated without letting at the oil drip out of it. It was just a little too greasy to eat at the time however we took it home to make tempura donburi for breakfast the next morning. 

We will definitely be back and hope that the fried menu items get cared for with as much detail that goes into the noodles.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,5,5,4,kDe80sRfF8mhSVyQwAX6jQ

I was somewhat bummed out, but made plans to meet up with friends later in the evening to try this newest restaurant to open in Las Vegas.

First of all for any one not familiar with this area, I just have to let you all know that parking will be a struggle unless the parking god just happened to smile up at you from the asphalt.  So be patient and alert when trying to score a decent parking space.

That out of the way, Udon Monzo just opened for their first day of soft opening this evening, and the restaurant was already at 90% capacity. Definitely off to a fantastic start.

The food we ordered on average were quit good. The menu offerings also has a good selection of Udon dishes to try that a hardcore foodie could come back here twice a day and still not run of new things to try for at least 2 weeks.

The Uni Cream Udon was my favorite thus far. On my first visit, I opted for the regular version, but an even more Uni ""Extra Uni-Style"" upgraded version could also be ordered for a $5 upgrade fee. I think that would be worth it for fans of U N I.

The Bacon Carbonara Udon was good, but I prefer it to be creamier. The Curry version could have a slightly more pronounced Curry flavor.

Kakuni Pork Belly (???) Braised Pork with Sweet Soy Based Sauce was good. Not as good as my ex-roommate's recipe, but you also don't have to fuss over the stove as you slowly braise it for 1/2 a day.

I hate the canned hot green tea, cause it's gross and like warm when you drink it. I think they should get real hot tea. The takoyaki was really freaking good! It came out pipping hot with katsuobushi moving around on top. I will definitely make it a point to order this dish every time! The beef tataki was okay. I was not impressed. The meat was thickly sliced and was tough to chew. I was not sure if I enjoyed the gelatinous sauce on top. It had a good flavor yet weird texture. And for the main entree, the beef udon was good. The udon and broth were up to par! The beef tasted great but the texture of shredded beef is not very appealing. The soft boiled egg was cold! Even after dipping it in my soup and letting it sit in it, the yolk was still cold, so I wasn't a big fan of that.

Uni udon- Udon with creamy broth and.... literally one little dot of uni. They totally skimped us on the uni because I've looked through several yelp photos and saw others with much more uni (yes, just the regular order and not extra uni).

Miso carbonara- Udon with creamy broth and a few pieces of bacon. It was okay. I feel like I could have made this myself at home.

- Popular udon shop that makes their noodles the classic hand crafted way.  They roll and flatten the flour with a long wooden rod until the perfect thickness and then they cut the dough into strips of noodles. 
- We were the first ones in line when they opened at 11:30am, the line got long and the restaurant filled up quickly - not a very big restaurant, maybe 40 seats 
- Accepts credit cards
- Extensive menu - they don't just have udon (hot and cold options), they have rice bowls and great appetizers too. 
- On the weekends, they are open from 11:30am to 11pm without a break in the middle of the day. 

What we ordered: 
- Takoyaki 7 pieces for $7.75 - The large pieces of octopus balls came out on the steel cratered pan, which helped make the takoyaki retain it's outer crispness.  The large size meant there was soft and moist interior that wrapped the octopus bits.  The takoyaki was piled high with benito shrimp flakes, mayo, sauce and seasoning.  It was one of the best takoyaki I have had in a restaurant in the States! A must get! 
- Fried Chicken price $6.25 - Yuuuummmm!  I love Japanese fried chicken, the way they marinate it and it's fried but not oily!  It was deliciously juicy and tender meat! 
- Sea urchin cream udon $16.95 - Uni is one of my favorite things to eat so I wished there was more uni in this dish.  The uni was crushed and found throughout the creamy broth.  It was topped with shiso and ikura fish roe.  I am particularly impressed with the thick and chewiness of the udon, the noodles came in an unique shape, more rectangular than round.  Although, I love the creaminess of this dish and uni, I might order something else next time.

My usual order includes uni (sea urchin) udon and a pork belly rice bowl to share (or if it's lunch, I do the combo of those two).  There definitely were inconsistencies though, such as overcooked noodles on repeated occasions or lack of sauce.  The seafood tomato cream is pretty good also.  I think their udon is just so tasty that really... you can't go wrong with any dishes.  This place definitely holds a place as one of my go-to whenever I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat.  They've always been pretty quick and efficient in getting us in and out.  If you're craving udon, I'd recommend you guys checking this place out!

Tip: They also do to-go, but you have to order in person and pick up there.",p2qFjnQKIZVi7qdj-B31iw,3,1,4,GuLGH_YUukWnBqa8iSHiJg
