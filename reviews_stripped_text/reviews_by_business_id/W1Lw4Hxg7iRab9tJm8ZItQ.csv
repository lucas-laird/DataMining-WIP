The guy tells me it'll be 15min, So fine I'll wait 15 min. Then I pay at the window and the manager lupe says it'll be 20min! How does one person say 15 min now you're telling me 20!?

271488,2016-07-15,1,W1Lw4Hxg7iRab9tJm8ZItQ,Sorry guys your drive thru service sucks!!!  Can you guys read the order on the ticket because you guys pretty much also screw up my order??? Duh. I'm sure you guys are aware that your drive thru speaker is horrible with unclear and static noises but haven't changed it for a long time. Oh yeah FYI your phone number on your receipt and Yelp is incorrect and does not work. I wonder why?  Hmmmm. I guess it's now Popeyes chicken for me.  I managed for years the corporate restaurant for Carl's Jr and would have fired whoever is running this location. It all falls down to the manager.

Thought maybe they'd get one order right...but I was wrong. I get to the window and the girl hands me a drink (which was not part of my order). Told her that I had not ordered a drink. She says ""well WHAT did you order?""  She took the order to start with and had everybody's orders wrong. MAnager came over, told me I owed them more money. This was Tuesday Dec 6 at around 4:00 pm.

Ordered a thigh and it looks like they threw a wing in there only 1/4 of the thigh was edible the entire wing las completely hard the biscuit was still doughy my mashed potatoes and gravy is mostly gravy and the popcorn chicken is entirely hard over cooked pieces of shit.

I don't usually feel that I have to check my to go orders from from KFC but I will definetely check every item in the future. After getting past the hard biscuits we opened a container of ""gravy"" which was just was brown water. In all of my years eating at KFC throughout the country, this was a first. So either the cooks were lazy or KFC has changed their recipe. I am sending them a video and will hopefully get an answer. I am giving them one star because I am holding everyone responsible for this. They all saw the brown water and still served it.",v2n3LumaoFZu82_ues3TsA,2,0,1,HKzumcDQr4HUirESUJILWA

OH MY GOD!
its like they went to fremont and hired any possible preson who was desperate for a job. a couple of the associates smelled, thats right SMELLED. like body odor. seriously? take a shower, youre in customer service let alone the FOOD BUSINESS! the kid at the register seemed as if he just got back from smoking a blunt in the back and although my order was repeated back correctly, it was received INCORRECTLY!
when i went back to get them to do it right, it took 5 minutes before i had to yell to the back to get someones attention. then the person that ended up fixing what was wrong fixed it with no gloves. god knows what she was doing before considering all staff disappeared to the back. the people behind us waiting for food even said they had terrible customer service. at one point i got so tired of waiting i climbed over the counter for ketchup. on top of all that, when my boyfriend got his food, it looked like the person who made the sandwich got hungry and gouged a piece of chicken right out of the center THEN proceeded to put it on the bun. food looked old, overcooked, dry, disgusting! 
i ended up handing everything back and demanding a refund.
absolutely ridiculous staff!
start hiring people with educations and people that show respect to those around them by BATHING. this place needs to be start over from scratch. from building to employees.

3889935,2018-06-10,0,W1Lw4Hxg7iRab9tJm8ZItQ,"This is the KFC that I usually visit when craving my Crispy Colonel fix.

There used to be a problem a few years ago at this specific location with the food occasionally being too salty, but they have thankfully gotten over their excessive use of NaCl since then. The service itself is usually pretty quick, no long waits here.

Extra crispy or the original recipe is usually the way I roll when coming here. The newer barbecue recipe simply does nothing for me; it appears to be little more than extra crispy chicken with barbecue sauce slathered on.

It's always worth being patient until those inevitable KFC discount coupons show up in the local newspaper to ensure that you get that extra special, extra crispy deal. 

Happily, $5.00 specials now appear to be a regular offering - no coupons needed!

When you stop on by, tell them the Crispy Colonel sent you and see just how extra crispy things can get ;-)",1aJni3g7tN1ikyCxIHnmtg,0,0,4,8Det6AsmNo_wAEE7FGF13g

Going inside I would expect better that involves more face to face interaction.  Customer service is severely lacking at this location.  The lady taking orders made me feel like I was being an inconvenience.  Excuse me for being a paying customer and therefore a part of your salary, lady.  After I placed my order she threw all my food into a box and handed it over to me before I could even give her my money.  Obviously the food was not fresh though it was very hot.  After I sat down I could hear the staff arguing amongst themselves in the kitchen.  It is unprofessional to do so within earshot of customers.

We could not even call and complain because the phone was out of service. We called corporate and they sent us a $10 card to be used at this same location. We wanted to give them another chance so we went in and what i witnessed was horrendous attitude from the front cashier. 

Lady had been waiting 30 minutes for her food. Politely asks the clerk when her food will be ready. Clerk says ""When its packed up..., I have a line thats priority over you""
 This lady continued to be polite however the clerks balling into the cash register.The finally customer gets her food and is around the corner getting a drink unbeknownst to the manager who walks up to the clerk and has the nerve to say ""dont you cry mija, miserable **** like that don't deserve to have customer service"" Even after all that the customer only said ""Im not sure why you're crying when you were rude to me"" and walked out with her head high as the clerk repeatedly yells ""Have a nice day ma'am""

That whole fiasco took about 45 minutes, then our food was ready and of course our order was wrong. Needless to say we wont be back and the Manager and cashier should be ashamed of themselves.",e_fqVFEDky4gn_yFAC0aZg,1,0,1,FHTvJwDJuvKQXEO72tpxmQ

Just looking through the drive-through window I see garbage on the floor including pickles and papers.  Sat in drive-through 10 minutes without even a warning that it would be that long.  The sad thing is is this is the second KFC we went to tonight because the first one didn't have biscuits. It's drive-through experience was even worse. They didn't feel like talking over the speaker for some reason. This one was just as bad with that though. I think I'm done with KFC.,TuBMw3s-yVApNZC3vzFkpw,4,0,1,aoDl7yjKo5j2gs0iodBIjw

The entire interaction was horrible. When I asked to speak to the manager she said it was her and I asked her why she was being so rude and she didn't apologize or say anything just took my money and closed the window. It was a very odd exchange. After waiting over 15 minutes another girl came out and was super friendly. I never got a receipt to do a survey so I wanted to do a review

I ordered at the drive thru and was told that there would be a sixteen to eighteen minute wait for extra-crispy chicken; I agreed and drove to the window.  After thirty-five minutes the ""team-member"" brought my order to the window.  I saw the sign on the window which states ""you will receive a five-dollar gift certificate if you do not receive a receipt with your order"".  Looking through the bag to make sure that I had received exactly what i had ordered, I saw that I dd not receive a receipt and knocked on the window to ask for the gift certificate.  Another team-member answered my knock and after listening to my request, called the original team-member over, who I again explained the request too.  She stated ""I am not giving you a gift card"", pulled my receipt from the register and thrust it through the window at me.  Extremely rude customer service.
