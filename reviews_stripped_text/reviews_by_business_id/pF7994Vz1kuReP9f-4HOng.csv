307537,2014-01-17,0,pF7994Vz1kuReP9f-4HOng,"First of all: I review this place as a fast food place. Of course you can't expect the same for less then $ 10 as you can for $ 200+ in a nice restaurant.

When that's said: This is the place I have eaten most of my lunches for the last couple of years. I always get the grilled 3 piece chicken. As side orders I pick cole slaw and pinto beans (they took out the grilled corn that I had from time to time).

The chicken here is in fact better then what you get in most fine restaurants. The side orders are okay, but nothing special. The price for food with drinks is less then $ 10, so you get a really tasty lunch for a cheap price here!

If you have a choice for when to go here I would recommend going outside the busiest lunch hour (Noon-1 PM), but before 6. After 6 I have had a couple of experiences with a bit dry of a chicken.

You might ask how I can give a place 5* with not everything perfect in my review. Compared to almost all other fast food places it's in another league. And I love chicken :)",jT_MLDmBBL-oMWLczE9CkQ,0,0,5,usVClIOD6USPv0_Y3XY9fQ

One of my favorite reasons for going there other than being fresh and delicious is The creamy cilantro sauce that I love with everything. I ordered a Pollo Bowl combo which I have been excited about all day, yes excited about fast food lol. When I got to the window I asked for cilantro sauce and the packets of jalapeño got sauce with my order. Of course the cashier said no problem. Keep in mind I already placed my order at the microphone menu and decided to wait to get to the window to ask for sauce so out couldn't slip her mind and could just grab or as she hands the bag through the window. When I got my bag I saw green sauce inside but no packets so I got her attention back and asked for the sauce I requested previously. She apologized and have me the missing packets. Upon getting home and ready to eat, it comes to be the green sauce I was given was tomatillo salsa and not the cilantro sauce at all. So basically, she forgot both sauces and when asked again for them gave me one and an incorrect one instead of the one that makes me go there to begin with. Not a big deal, just makes my food alot less satisfying and too much of a hassle to go back.",eQsb0vyh9ganpkGoBmp0uQ,1,0,2,kaM1n6RkDYcpnmztpjTVqg

I at one point had gotten so fed up with the awful service that i stopped going, even though I really love the chicken.  Recently, we started going back, and we are glad we did.  The service has dramatically improved.  Also, there have been some positive changes to the menu that have made it even better, such as adding broccoli as one of the sides.  The only problem that I run into now is that they often dont keep up with demand in their cooking of the chicken, and will not have leg and thigh meal available.  Your choice is to either wait 15 minutes or pay more for the breast and wings.  This, however is a corporate policy, so I cant fault the individual restaurant for that.

I opted for the leg and thigh meal with a loco side salad and spanish rice as my sides. This particular restaurant gives you a pager that goes off when your food is ready if you dine in. The cashier was super friendly and even cracked a few jokes with me while taking my order. The interior of the store could be cleaner. I know that this particular store gets busy, especially during lunch hours, but there should be someone checking the dining room to make sure the tables and floor are cleaned regularly. The chicken is good, and if you are trying to be extra healthy you can get it sans skin, although the skin is my favorite part so I would never do that :-)

3140876,2017-07-03,0,pF7994Vz1kuReP9f-4HOng,El Pollo Loco like any other fast food place can be a hit or a miss depending on the day you go. I generally don't come here unless they send me some of those coupons in the mail. The prices can get a bit high without some savings so I will always wait until I can get some sort of deal. The chicken here is pretty damn good but I would only like to pay the coupon price lol. This location gets 3 stars from me because they are extremely slow every time I have decided to pay them a visit. Today I waited about 15 minutes in the drive thru because the cashier was clueless. I read her my coupon description and she insisted that it was for one of the under 500 calories entrée MEALS and not just the salad. Now I know that I can read and comprehend very well so I was sure this was for just the salad. I get to the window and she tries to apply it to the MEAL she was so adamant about and well what do you think happened? Yep.. it wouldn't take it because it was only valid for the salad. But didn't you say... Never mind I shall digress... Overall it was just an okay Chicken Avocado salad anyways..

I believe all the older locations will look like this too. I also like the new menu options, they are definitely adding that Tex-Mex attitude. Giving it that fresh taste similar to Chipotle. A good thing is the prices are still affordable and you can order a decent size meal for $5. Did corporate leadership hire a hip up to date marketing consultant to re-vamp their image?

They have a self-serve Salsa Bar where you can get as much salsa, onions and cilantro as you want. 

Our usual order is the 10pc Family Meal with 2 large sides (Mac 'n' Cheese & Mashed Potato) and flour tortillas. I love flame grilled chicken and their seasoning soooo good that I actually like eating the skin of the chicken and I usually don't like chicken skin! Mac 'n' Cheese is super inconsistent. The Cheese can be super thick, super thin or chunky. Mashed potatoes are usually a little more consistent. 

Yes, I've said that I love EPL but I gave this location 1-Star because when we walked in, the Salsa bar was DIRTY, there was only ONE clean table in the entire restaurant and we took it before anyone else could. Trays on the other tables with trash, tables weren't wiped down, it was GROSS. 

My son accidentally spilled a cup of water on the floor and on the table, so he asked them for a rag, and what they gave him was thinner than the napkins on the table in the dispenser!

It is rather saddening. I go to El Pollo Loco every so often, however, a different location. Came to this location as it is closer to Chinatown area.
The 1 star is due to its El Pollo Loco taste. The chicken has a good seasoning and spice in addition to its charbroiled taste.
The wait was horrible. Do not expect a fast 'fast food' place. If you are ordering their chicken, you should expect at least a 20-30 minutes wait time. While waiting, I even saw my food laid out in the open (box opened) getting cool before they actually called my name. My chicken ended up only warm. 
The saddest part is they ran out of forks. How do you run out of forks?!!? Especially during lunch time. We were eating there at the location and asked for plates and utensils when the worker told us, ""Sorry we are out of forks, we only have spoons and knifes."" 
It really is a shame that I have to give a one star, other El Pollo Loco locations are more efficient. Just this one tends to be a lot slower. Definitely something to beware of.",UX80mE44b-ObNif3cXRtGg,1,0,1,u8ivinlVH-dQlTvnmMzdWg
4942562,2017-12-12,0,pF7994Vz1kuReP9f-4HOng,Worse El pollo loco I ever tried!!!!! I will never go there just because of this experience that I had. I took Rancho burrito with chicken and what I got???? A lot of rice instead of chicken. Staff doesn't know how talk to customers. Sauce bar was empty.

The prices are reasonable and the sides are not so bad.  But the best part of the meal is the tortillas, they are unbelievable.  My husband and I often eat low carb and so buying a meal allows us to eat the chicken, but smelling the tortillas will often be too tempting, so we always ask they do not include them, thus eliminating the temptation.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,4,ZcXkyBAyw6Sc7AaJzIK3IQ

Its weird...everyone can remember the best steak they've ever had, perhaps the best sushi but NEVER the best chicken.  Not that I am saying this is the best chicken I've ever had.  It isn't...nothing comes close to my mom's roasted chicken :)

I guess I go here since its so close to my apartment and the fact that it is a bit healthier than standard fast food fare.  Why go to Taco Bell when you got this place?",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,3,4,4,wY6qUhw2WvE7XRylv8Fnfw

I have an issue EVERY time I visit, rude crew members that mess up my order too often.

This most recent bad encounter was with Kimberly via the drive thru. There was an issue with my order no fault of mine and she responded with attitude. She was in the wrong as verified with her shift lead and yet all she could do is roll her eyes and walk away from the window.

I am tired of being treated like crap and argued with in a hostile way when they continue to mess up on my orders.

I really am not returning to this location ever as it is not worth the aggravation. I will drive further and visit the sahara/decatur location.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,4,1,1,aXswTHDzglu1oK2PAyzUww
5914537,2017-07-27,1,pF7994Vz1kuReP9f-4HOng,just spent 20 minutes of my 30 minute lunch break to redeem my free birthday meal. a man was screaming at the manager because he found plastic in the salsa bar . he fished it out and threw it in the counter while the manager yelled back at him and wouldn't give him a free meal. she gave up and walked away....instead of removing the salsa the man just put his bare hand in. no one changed the salsa in the 20 minutes I was there. they were too busy talking shit about the man in Spanish loud enough to be heard in the dining room. I will say that the cashier Jennifer held her cool and did the best she could in spite of the whirlwind going on around her.,YLRhuGso3nlntbcamthnZg,0,0,1,JKUo2Fr7nEyxIMBUky9VPw
