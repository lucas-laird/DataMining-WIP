My boyfriend and I went in for the Portobello mushroom burger during lunch...he orders it and was told they run out of the bread. We ask if there was anything for our inconvenience....the MANAGER comes out and says no. He says they ran out and can't discount the meal. He didn't even apologize for not having the bread. Fine we said. I ordered the 10 pieces nugget instead.  The food came out cold and the nuggets taste like it's been sitting out since this morning.  Bad service!..,check!  Cold food!...check!

It used to have great service and no issues, unfortunately the last few times I have gone the drive thru lady has been rude and my order is ALWAYS wrong.  Today was no exception! Ordered 2 combos today, baconator with diet coke and spicy chicken with no mayonnaise. I even politely had the them read the order back to make sure it was correct.  I was given a double cheeseburger with regular coke and the spicy chicken had mayonnaise, that coupled with the rude service was my last straw, I will no longer be going here. :-(",URIBtJsoDkPL8SjrLwfaGQ,2,0,1,7X4oA_o0RyLYlArZ0RKkoA

Surprisingly, this store must have a lot of fans since the lobby was pretty busy and there were other patrons that desired Wendy's as much as we did.

With the expansion of their 4 for 4 meal we decided to try the Jr Bacon and chicken sandwich too. Everything was fresh and made to our liking not the ""way"" it comes. And they got our food order right the first time. Such success!
The staff was very attentive to their guests needs and were cleaning as needed tables for guests. Thanks Wendy's on Arville for having fabulous staff.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,0,0,5,MHZpadZC4z-SN0gGN7zMzQ
4074347,2017-08-02,7,1tNVPumjvFErYjvSXbOQ6Q,"I know, I know: Wendy's? FOUR stars? Yes and yes. I rarely review places like this but I had such a fantastic experience that I needed to let the Yelperverse know about it. This is an old school Wendy's, meaning it's not fancy, it's pretty worn down and worn out, and it's in a not-so-nice part of town. So imagine my surprise when I came here and not only was it spotlessly clean (two employees were constantly wiping down tables), it was packed with obvious regulars (lots of old timers and a chatty fellow in line behind us who informed us as such). 

It's clear that many of the employees here are ""lifers,"" meaning they always have and / or always will work for Wendy's. That means they are super efficient and true superstars of the fast food chain. The older lady took our order (we had lots of substitutions) with zero issues and got it 100% correct the first time. 

When our food arrived, we were both shocked. This was hands down the best Wendy's food we'd had in a long, long time. The burgers were hot and fresh and perfectly seasoned, the buns were fluffy, the cheese was melting and gooey, and the produce was so high quality that if you didn't know better you'd guess it was from a higher end burger restaurant. The lettuce was crisp and not brown nor wilted, the pickles were perfect, and my super red and ripe tomatoes were sliced uniformly. I can't say enough about how great this burger was. 

It's fine, but there were several homeless people (and one mentally ill man) hanging out in the parking lot in broad daylight (at 1:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon). They didn't intend to harm anyone, but one of them came inside and started walking around and talking to random customers, disappearing into the restroom (he never came back out before I left and the employees didn't ask him to leave). For that, I had to dock them one star. People were freaking out and feeling uncomfortable, so I would recommend this location get some better security or manager training so they can better deal with situations like this. 

For obvious reasons, I'd suggest you use the drive thru window instead of choosing to dine in. But this is a dang good Wendy's!",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,9,10,4,OU_GqJqXDNFIHt5pGm_TVQ
4406545,2009-01-03,11,1tNVPumjvFErYjvSXbOQ6Q,I eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but I'm always hoping for a finger in my chili. I never try any of their new sandwiches or anything I stick to the chili. It's by no means good but hell it's less than $2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning.,3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,6,5,2,kGC-CRiu_3ILR3zTYx76mA
4538430,2012-12-02,0,1tNVPumjvFErYjvSXbOQ6Q,"Why are they lucky enough to get 2 stars? Their food is usually ok. It's their service that is HORRIBLE!!! Every time I order any sort of food item they make you pull up and wait even if there is no one behind you in line....why?!? Ill tell you why! They are being timed. I know it is FAST food but don't you want your customers to be happy rather then worry about a timer? I especially love when they give food to the car that was behind me and asked to pull forward, first. I'm pretty sure it isn't rocket science to make a junior bacon.... 

Their wild berry lemonade is to die for! Don't get it too late at night or else it will be watered down. 

They didn't have chocolate frosty so hubby tried a chocolate frosty shake. First, it was gross. Second he found 2 pieces of plastic in it while drinking it. I tried the caramel frosty once again GROSS I love caramel but they used way too much.",JfnY0VcP63s5RF1sfOHjBQ,2,0,2,Ws0c4AkhtQLqWcggZFN0lA

On this trip to Vegas, we figured we wanted to eat here because we haven't had it in so long. Needless to say, the food was ok but the service sucked. The lady kept rushing me to order, I wasn't done ordering and she kept telling me my total.

4932883,2018-03-29,0,1tNVPumjvFErYjvSXbOQ6Q,"Welcome to Wendy's, or rather, no welcome at all. 

I had placed my order at the drive thru, and like most experienced consumers, I was sure to be as specific as possible to assure minimal confusion. She asked, I answered, nothing out of the ordinary. I paid for my food, and while doing a brief glance, there was the awkward waiting period before I left. Assured I had everything, I left without a thought in my head. 
About ten minutes into my drive heading home I had a feeling, and I checked the bad once more. There was no sauce, which we were both specific about when I had ordered, as well as my two cookies. This is just one of many different scenarios that I have encountered here at this Wendy's location.
Upon my second arrival, I made my complaint at the drive thru, where I was acknowledged and told to drive to the window. When I pulled up to the window, I was asked again what my complaint was, even though I had just explained and was made to feel like I was acknowledged.
I was only granted my sauce and my two missing cookies, yet nothing else to compensate for the inconvenience.
This location lacks service, awareness and consideration.
Yet the worst part about this Wendy's location, is not the expected incompetence, but the simple theme of not caring. They just do not care. We are but one customer out of a cycle of a hundred they see in a single work period. I enjoy Wendy's, but I do not enjoy their employee's disregard for others.",Gee7ipQKfnnDpJ9WEUfLOA,0,0,1,wugwur9crXRMrzbs1btOFg

I had the bacon cheese burger combo, now you can choose from many options instead of fries you can add a salad, or baked potato.  I had the fries.  

The burger is really very good, it was made fresh, they toasted the bun, it had a couple of thick apple smoked bacon strips, pickles, lettus and tomato.  I enjoyed it very much, it reminded me of the home style my mom made us as kids!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,2,0,3,5SYpjGvU323gJGN57i3ZHg

This time, the fries and nuggets were hit, but burgers still cold. Asked for a refund on one of the burgers and the lady wants to argue that it's fresh! Fresh doesn't mean heated to the proper temperature. There was maybe 5 people in the whole store, you can produce hot food. You can't get by solely based on the name Wendy's, you have to deliver as well. This location did not.",-r2tywPFg7lCw9hPpHsk_w,0,0,1,9eVikaNM_6_t79rymM2A-Q
