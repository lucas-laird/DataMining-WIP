2183317,2013-10-13,0,USMzHt3XL3nPXVVOfRw1-g,"BJ's is a great local watering hole in the Southwest area of Las Vegas.  It is clean, not too smokey, and has a decent menu.  There are a ton of TV's and private rooms if you want to bring a group of people to watch some of the games.  There are game day specials and 3 happy hours throughout the day, so it is hard to miss their specialty menu with $5 appetizers and 50% off all drinks.

They are open 24 hours, like most gaming bars, but BJ's staff is very friendly.  The only negative is that service can be a little slow sometimes, because there are usually only 3-4 staff members there on any give day and if it gets busy, it might be tough to get a drink or some food.  

BJ's gets a big 5 star review, as they are the official home of the University of Florida Las Vegas Alumni Club for football and basketball.  They decorate an entire area of the lounge and have a complimentary buffet setup for all Florida Gator fans. 

BJ's is great place to stop if you are looking for some video poker, appetizers, drinks, and sports if you are in the southwest.",XAsTftSdKLetN-g6hD_i7w,0,0,5,od78DlD5kYucu9MUzGIR7Q

2388676,2016-01-23,8,USMzHt3XL3nPXVVOfRw1-g,"I love BJs. Um I'm talking about this cocktail lounge bar in the middle of a neighborhood near Decatur and Windmill. They have Happy Hours twice a day 4pm-6pm and 12am-2am, I believe it's half off drinks. They also have Football specials, food and drink specials, friendly staff, and it's a nice spacious place.

Honestly I don't really wanna let you'll know anymore about BJs and their $8.99 Thursday nights prime rib deal. I really don't. Their Thursday nights prime rib deal goes from 5pm - 11pm or whenever they run out and they've already ran out on me once. I would call ahead since there's also Thursday Night Football. It's a pretty good deal. The prime rib ain't that bad though I usually eat it like my steaks, medium well. A lot of times it's larger than you'd expect, sometimes it's not. When it's not football season I've gone as late as a few minutes before 11pm and got prime rib with no problem.

The rest of their menu are actually pretty good, I'd say way better than the usual bars that do basic pizza and burgers not that they don't also serve pizza and burgers but they're good. The bomb shrimp bites are very tasty, so are the wedge salads, wraps, and desserts. Keep your eye out for their specials menu they had some lamb chops dish on it the other day, I really wanted to order it but I was craving a prime rib.

This location is spacious and fits the lounge atmosphere I think. They have lots of TVs and seating areas. They do only have one pool table but I think they'll let you play free as long as you buy a drink and some food, unless they were just hooking it up I don't know just ask.

The staff here always does an excellent job, they're very friendly and welcoming. Warning or fyi the ladies do wear some lovely attire.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,12,9,4,puO0Ngb1pBT6h9ynEtw9Hg

Previous experiences with BJ's Cocktail Lounge on Decatur have been negative as well and I see nothing has changed.

I decided to give this place another chance and have some dinner and a beer while watching the football game on TV.

This place was DEAD at 6pm on a Saturday and not a single thing was going on.  

Don't waste your time going here or talking to Savannah, the bartender!   She was rude and looked like it was an inconvenience that I asked her for a menu and to change the TV channels to the football game.  She had such an attitude and chip on her shoulder.  She even barked at another customer that he HAD to drink his drink at the bar and could not sit on the couches a few feet away and watch the game with his friends.  He had also asked to change the TV channel to the football game and it seemed as if she did it reluctantly.

I would have given 1 star, but I gave two as the food was good...a simple BLT with a fried egg and avocado.  Sabrina, the server, was friendly with a nice smile.

When I went to settle, I was given two checks...one for the beer and one for food.  I asked Sabrina if she could combine the checks and she said it was done already.  I thanked her for doing that and paid my tab,

The issue was that Savannah decided to come over and rudely tell me that she combined the checks but from now on ""WE DO SEPARATE TABS FOR BEER AND FOOD FROM NOW ON, but it's combined!""  Like she is doing me a favor...It should be common sense to get one check!  If that is the policy with BJ's, than why didn't Savannah take my food order from behind the bar?

I won't be going back...and that's shame because it is the closest neighborhood bar to where I live.  I'll just spend my money somewhere else.",OEddIjmyqjuLrqS14DgbUw,5,0,2,zzwxlV9TFrxNxxZO_uCBSA

There are several televisions around the bar area and a seperate dining area that's also covered in televisions.

The food is great and low priced during the MNF specials.  The drinks were 50% off and were not only mixed very well, but everything tasted fresh.

I explained my situation with Roadrunner to the manager of this bar and a waitress and they were as shocked as I felt.  Their service was above and beyond and I don't think it had anything to do with having to make up for my horrible experience at a different bar...I think they're just this amazing to every single customer every single time you visit.  I'll be back for this Sunday's Texans/Packers matchup and most other games this season.

THANK YOU for a great experience!",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,2,1,5,1MBppSiBqTkUaxXy44XHPQ

Closer to 16oz if you ask me.  I dare you to finish it all.  Amazingly, there are LARGER cuts available as well.  But come early, this special is so popular they might run out!

I think this is one of the nicer BJ's locations in town.  Upon entering the establishment, there is a humongous bar waiting to greet you.  The bar top is nice, made of granite or something.  I'm used to seeing bars with busted up wooden counters that have been around forever.  The bar has your standard Game King machines, but there are also ample seating around the bar without a gaming machine, so you and your friends can sit at the bar without occupying a machine someone else might want to play.  

On the right is a good sized dining area with booths and tables.  Last week we had a party of 14 show up and they were able to accommodate us in a big double table setup in the corner.  Seating is comfortable and the booths/tables are nicely spaced.

On the left there are 2 large screen TVs with long couch seating areas.  Great for 2 large parties.  I haven't sat in this particular area, but the couches look comfy and you can pretty much relax and lounge out.  Right next to this area there is a lower section with a pool table where everyone can gather around and have a drink and whack some balls.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,3,1,4,dsMKDjrZARw-4uznCn48LQ

Kind of in an out of the way spot (unless you're local to the neighborhood).  Very nice on the inside and has plenty of tvs and comfy seating, a large bar, separate dining room and a pool table.  BIG PLUS - although there is gaming at the bar, there's plenty of non-gaming seats at the bar as well.  I love this. It's one of my pet peeves to go to a bar and not be able to sit because i'm not a gamer.

Food:   Food is decent, but honestly not always my first choice for dining.  They recently revamped the menu and took some of my favorites off.  I go for the prime rib night and it's definitely worth the money.  It's tender, tasty and a great price.

Drinks:  I don't often drink beer here but they have an ok selection on tap and in bottles.   I normally drink mixed drinks and have been pleased with what I've had.  I also have liked many of the ""special"" drinks that BJs has such as the Marilyn Monroe Vodka with fresh strawberries and lemonade.  I've allowed the bartenders to just create something for me and have never been disappointed.

Service - From the first day until now (over a year later), the bartenders have been super friendly, fun, and provided fantastic service, especially Stephanie, Elizabeth, Julia, and Joe.  Drea rocks the food service.  They are there to make sure you have a beverage and a good time.  I've never seen them be less than gracious to any and every one who walks through the door.  Their capacity for remembering everyone is unreal.   I have been in there on happy hour when it's been crazy and they still make everyone feel like they are getting personalized attention.  They are wonderful.

As a regular of over 3 years I've seen this bar slowly lose what made it so great.  When i first started frequenting the bar they had awesome happy hour for 3 hours twice a day.  Wednesday night all you can eat spaghetti, Thursday prime rib, Saturday shrimp dinner special, 1/2 price breakfast for early birds every day.  When you walked in everyone greeted you and if they knew you(which they made effort to learn your name on your first visit) proudly said hello with your name attached. Four of a kind card of the day changed every day.  Your points could be used as money in the machines. They have always been strict on comps.  $20=1 drink.  Don't expect much more.  Now the specials are nearly all gone except for Thursday prime rib.  Happy hour is 2 hours now. Every bartender i know no longer works there.  Its sad whey great places change what made them great.

I'm reminded of Season 8 Episode 7 of How I Met Your Mother where Barney Stinsen is trying to pick a new strip club to hang out at. By no means is this place a strip club... but I am on the hunt to find a local bar to kick it. I passed this place a couple times on the way home from Yoga. I finally decided to swing in because I was starving and I got fed up with trying to find a Gyro place to satisfy my craving after passing a Gyro billboard off Las Vegas Blvd. 

My first reaction when I walked in was the thick cloud a smoke that smacked me in the face. You'll get use to it after a couple minutes, but it smells like a typical casino. I plopped down at the barstool and was greeted by Julia, the bartender. Super sweet, easy on the eyes and a delight to chat with. She made my ""dining for one"" experience less awkward. 

The first thing on the menu was a Gyro meal. I was destined to stop here. I went with that and hoped that it would be somewhat decent. I wasn't expecting a knock out gyro, but for bar food, i was impressed. It came with crispy fries seasoned with rosemary. The gyro came with thinly sliced lamb with onions, tzatziki sauce, and wrapped in warm pita bread. I washed it down with a pint of Guinness and was perfectly happy. My bill came out to be 19 dollars with tax and tip. The pint of Guinness was $6.00, which is kind of pricey for a local Las Vegas joint. 

Overall, I was happy with the service and food quality. The smoking is a downside, but you probably won't find a non-smoking bar anywhere in Vegas. Price is average. This place is in the front running for my hangout. 

 A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,4,2,4,cNrKuZSTy4klRXK1OY24MA

We sat ourselves, told them where we were and waited...and waited...and waited. Bleach-haired fishnets girl finally came over for our order. Cept we had a little problem...no menus. Took another 10 minutes. Got menus and water. Half an hour later, she returned for our orders. A member of our party very clearly ordered the margherita pizza, even pointed at the menu as she did so. 20 minutes later, the scantily clad blondie brought a margarita. The drink. Went back to the bar to order the correct thing. 

Another 20 minutes later, my chicken pesto pizza with no tomatoes came out. With EXTRA tomatoes. Under the cheese. Sent it back, knowing full well it would only get uglier.

Five minutes later, the margherita (pizza this time) finally came, it looked scarily similar to the tomatoey chicken pesto with the chicken picked off. Seriously, pesto margherita.

Keep in mind that we were literally the only customers. There were six of us.

Definitely try the calamari, buffalo wings, and spinach artichoke dip.",T7wGe2rsUtDfUrLYwU3d4w,3,2,5,QaXWcrCkD7krvdfNk1OtSQ

It's friendly, You will be welcomed the moment you walk in the door, the moment you sit down, and again when you settle in. Trust me, it's not overwhelming, it's sweet and it actually seems sincere. Everybody is attentive and almost determined to make sure you enjoy you time at this location.

Food is good. If you've eaten at a different BJ's, you won't be surprised. Happy hour is 4-7 and they also have reverse happy hour. 50% off drinks and they have a $5 menu of small items. We were there around 4 and ordered sliders, calamari... and my husband was dying to try their blackened chicken mac & cheese (not happy hour food). The sliders (2) were par for course and the calamari was quite tasty. My husband yummed up (made yummy noises while eating) his chicken mac and cheese.

Place is nice. Some seating areas remind me of the VIP sections at a Vegas club : plush booths, chairs, dim lighting.. very nice touch. They also have tables away from the bar scene and a pool table off to the side. It definitely has a classy vibe which personally, I didn't expect.

It's a great bar for my neighborhood and we'll definitely be back.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,2,2,4,8D7bwGfgFbJll9yfrnhPTg

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the friendly bartenders.  On Thursdays they have a 6.99 prime rib special that is so awesome! My husband gets the double cut for 6 dollars more. The portions are actually pretty decent and both visits our prime rib was perfectly cooked. It comes with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies. The mashed potatoes are good and the veggies aren't bad, but I will say the amount of garlic that chef uses on those veggies is just out of control! Yes, I love garlic, but seriously it's like a whole head of garlic in those vegetables. At any rate, it's a great deal and a good meal. 

If you gamble, they have a players card log-in that's pretty cool. It's busy on Thursday due to the great deal they have going on, but the bar is pretty big. The bartenders are attentive and actually act like they enjoy their job. 

It's a very spacious place. I like the layout and the atmosphere is social and chill.  There is a pool table, comfortable couches to lounge in with your significant other or whatever you are into and a dining area. Definitely making this one of our hangouts!",yvAYprNnakItO2O4zjDHtw,2,0,5,ZfyLGjiIOFXo2dS_D9Z9bg
5627700,2016-01-09,0,USMzHt3XL3nPXVVOfRw1-g,"1st visit and last!  I walked into this BJ's location to order some food to go.  Upon walking in I was immediately greeted and asked what I wanted to drink almost immediately after putting $20 into the machines located at the bar.  As I played the bartender comped my 1st beer.  After playing for 10 minutes I played another $20 bill.  ($40 total). The bartender brought me a receipt for the 2nd beer.  Along with my food.  The food that was extremely cold.  When I asked, ""you charge your players?"" She went to her screen and said you only had $40 ""coin in.""  

I am a local to Vegas and I have never seen a bar use this tactic to not comp their players to save money.   I spent 15 minutes in that bar, gambled $40 and I was only comped 1 beer.   I steadily played all my winnings and losses at $2.50 a hand.   The food was a 1 on a scale of 1-10.   This isn't how you manage a bar.  This will be the last time I ever visit ANY BJ's location.  I use Yelp all the time and the reviews determine where I eat, drink, and play.  Hopefully patrons read my review and go somewhere else.  

A better suggestion to go in Southwest Vegas near this location would be BAR.  (Born and Raised) Phenomenal drinks, comps, food, and atmosphere where they take care of their players.",GCbN1Y2pu7gibky37kL09g,0,0,1,U1sBDNfG6LcfyYs_LicQ4w
5666630,2015-07-01,0,USMzHt3XL3nPXVVOfRw1-g,"I've been to this BJ's location several times and this is easily one of the nicest neighborhood bars I have been to. They have friendly staff members, tasty food,  and plenty of drink selections. Plus, the large open interior is stylish, clean, and complemented with comfortable bar seats. 

This spot covers all the essentials: video poker for the players, pool table in the corner for the hustlers, tvs mounted above the circular bar to keep the sports fans happy, separate dining area, and even a lounge area loaded with couches for those who like to get comfortable and socialize. 

There's a decent selections of draft beers here (Delirium Tremens got my attention) and I really enjoyed the food selections I've tried from their kitchen. Their mac and cheese entree is topped with seasoned chicken, bacon, mushrooms, and lots of gooey cheese. Also, their marinated chicken wings aren't fried.  Instead, they're braised first and finished off on the grill. I could taste the delicious difference. Overall, the menu has a good variety of bar food selections to choose from.

I'll definitely be back here in the near future to catch their happy hour food and drink specials.",jK5IzbH2qQNKmxjkk5C7pw,1,1,5,rh0JysYB9i85P1PVy7JO7Q

I got great suggestions from the girls behind the bar, and was pleasantly surprised to find local beer on tap. Three Joseph James handles and a Tenaya Creek, and decent options otherwise (though my friend would have loved to have a Fat Tire). Overall I had a great experience. Great service, great food, great atmosphere.",OHTpVz1BSGZ5p4qAibgdug,0,0,5,yCLSZ8ACwRLFXAqmBjOpMg

The decor was muted browns and had a quirky wall piece which consisted of men scaling the walls (kinda like army men figurines). Had a good selection of beers on tap and probably a full bar. 

The food selection was pretty good as well. Between the five of us, we shared lobster dip (A+), meat lovers pizza (A) and Nachooooos (A+), which had actual peppers that left my mouth on fire.",ANLSKvFmCgRMjxtELq70FQ,3,1,4,JW0HMIZBut9g6p-coVnzxA
