Okay, so the service isn't always the best, but who cares when the pho and the banh mi is beyond good. For all you vegetarians, they have the ultra elusive vegetable broth pho that tastes amazing and is always available. For everyone else, the rest of the pho is just as amazing with just the right amount of salt.

Now the banh mi. Holy Vietnamese sandwich! I've had it at a ton of places and this one is by far the best. Everything, including price, is so good.

Finally, don't go here so I can always get in with no wait. Thank you.",9u9fQhq0hynxjLQgZGpmSA,0,0,5,0qr2UCCO9Ja6_L2AnBakfQ

And analogously, collecting grease in a plastic wholesale Kikkoman bucket and boiling it with water doesn't make soup. This place has some of the oiliest and insipidly-flavored broth I've ever tasted in a Vietnamese restaurant. 

And you know what? Reviewer Veronica O. wasn't lying, I too spotted the cockroach nest in the light fixtures, but rest assured, they're all dead. Well, at least the visible ones were; I can't account for what I didn't see.

But I did manage see some almost adorable ""mites"" in my water cups; yes, that's water cups plural, because the second one they brought had one inside. This place is infested, someone call the Men in Black.

The shredded pork skin on the rice plate is disgusting. It smells sour, tastes sour. It's not the vinegar sour or any good kinda sour. It's the sour that tells you it's bad! I have had the Vietnamese rice plate in many other Pho places and none of them taste like this.
The female owner was nice, we could at least talk a little. The male owner came over and questioned us ""What's wrong"" and we told him the shredded pork skin tastes bad. He became really defensive and said its freshly made and that's how it tastes. He told us ""you don't know how this tastes like. This is pork skin, that's how it tastes"" in a pretty annoying, defensive, aggressive tone.

I don't feel being treated as a customer. I'm 100% sure the pork skin is bad.

The female owner came again and said it's made yesterday and maybe it was from freezer and still cold and blah blah blah. Well, two owners said different things. I conclude that bull*rap. Never eaten here again.

My Pho is just ok. Tastes like MSG broth. I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2 because the female owner was nice to us.

Note: The female owner is nice. Got us a side pork chop as a replacement. I just don't know how the male owner can be rude to customers.",Bb6iz8w_42o4cm9DtrCUIg,0,0,3,Vk1K7QstmWnhr7wrth1WyQ

Yes it was a cockroach,  a momma cockroach.  It ran down and went under the table,  then a baby size cockroach crawled out running aimlessly through the wall,  and it was followed by three more roaches.  Yes the light fixture was their nest. 

My bill came,  and I pointed at the roaches on the wall.  The waiter laughed and said sorry,  he said he would tell his boss.  I complained to the cashier too,  and they didn't think much of it.  She kept repeating the amount of my bill. I paid and jammed out of there. 

Funny thing is,  that other patrons also saw the roaches and didn't react to them.  This is not ok!  I don't want Roach as one of the meats in my pho.

1409439,2016-08-01,1,03icrim6SfEQJlejDMbzsA,"Came here for lunch with a friend after hearing about this All-You-Can-Eat deal going on Saturday's and Sundays. Availability is between 10:00A - 0300P at $12.99 and 0300P - 1000P at $14.99

Originally prior to coming, we had saw the menu for the AYCE that includes

Menu #1 - Sai Gon Pho, Vermicelli Beef Spicy Soup, Egg Roll (Cha Gio), Potstickers, Chicken Wings, Saigon Fried Rice, Spring Roll, Saigon Fried Noodle, and Dessert: Fruit & Cake

Menu #2 -  Bun Bo Hue, Beef Rice Noodle, Vietnamese Pancake (Banh Xeo), Saigon Fried Rice, Egg Roll (Cha Gio), Chicken Wings, Rice Flour Cake w/ Shrimp, Crab Rice Noodle, Saigon Fried Noodle, and Dessert: Fruit 

Originally we were going to come here with another friend but he didn't wake up until we already started eating. Despite the spread of news by FB and what not, it doesn't seem like many people knew about this deal or had been doing this deal when we did. 

Upon arrival, it took a minute or two till we were discovered and sat at a table on the side. The restaurant seemed to be ""Cramped"" due to the décor of many wooden fences to ""separate"" tables and hanging camping lights and the awnings on the side walls, in attempt to create an ""outdoor? Vietnam? feeling"". Lol. Horribly fail imo. The lady was nice with the limited but fairly decent English. She had told us we were not limited to a certain menu, and can order from both AND we were allowed to ""share"" orders AND recommended to order multiples of the ""appetizers"" due to length of time needed to cook each item. 

We had ordered the Saigon Pho, Bun Bo Hue, 2 orders of potstickers, 3 orders of spring rolls, 3 orders of egg rolls, 1 Vietnamese pancake. 

Bun Bo Hue had arrived before the Saigon Pho. Then came rolling in the potstickers with egg rolls, spring rolls, then last but not least, the Vietnamese pancake. 

We had been told the noodle soups are generally smaller than the normal order. When it had arrived, yep they were smaller than the ""normal"" (from other restaurants). Bun Bo Hue included slices of meat (not raw/plain beef but similar to the ones that Vietnamese cuisine has in a roll. and a spear of similar meat but pork I believe. Doesn't bun bo hue have tomatoes and pig feet? Soup flavor was decent. 

Spring rolls were small. Yeah it had shrimp but lacked some ingredients like pork slices, and some other herbs. The peanut sauce that came with it tasted a bit weird. Not like a ""went bad"" weird but like... iunoe. Bit different from the usual peanut butter hoisin sauce combination I usually get. Adding sriracha made it weirder. o_O ? 

Egg rolls were long but about 1/2 the size of a normal egg roll. Potstickers were fried and seemed to have the same filing as an egg roll. 

The Vietnamese pancake (banh xeo) was the size of a large plate. Yeah that's the ""normal"" ish size of one (though still smaller and thin) but definitely lacked in ingredients. The only things we had found inside the egg ""wrap"" was bean sprouts, and like 2-3 shrimp. 

The lettuce that came with both the egg rolls and banh xeo was varying in size. So varying that it seemed some were from the outer layers, and some were from the very inner most layers. Not sure if this is something to be nit-picked about but hey... at least gimme a size that can fit the stuff im supposed to eat it with LOL

After we finished our food, the same lady came to recommend more things to order. Some on the menu (chicken wings, etc) and some not on the AYCE menu (bbq pork spring roll). We were quite full so opt'ed for dessert. Gave us 2 slices of watermelon per person. I mean, the watermelon was sweet, and she was seen eating it after she gave it to us too xD 

Overall, I guess its good to try once. Maybe. I like viet foods but this is no where near the best ive had. Quite far from it. I had heard from my friend this place had changed owners a few times in the past year as well. For $13, its not a bad try if you can eat a decent amount. 

This place used to be good because I used to call in to pre-order 2-3 lbs of bbq pork for making bun thit nuong at home. Not sure if they still do that but considering my experience this time around, maybe I shouldn't try.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,2,2,SE1QG4vcCNPYePEcEW30Ig

1492299,2012-01-15,7,03icrim6SfEQJlejDMbzsA,"Can't beat the price of $5.95 for a bowl of Pho!

DO order the Pho!  The sweet broth, the al-dente rice noodles, and the thinly sliced beef makes the taste Pho-antastic!  

DON'T be disappointed that the raw beef comes out more cooked than expected.  Since the broth is pretty hot and beef is so thin, it practically cooks the beef well done while it's on its way out to your table.

DO order other items on the menu... I shared a BIG bowl of the Catfish soup with my dining companion.  Fresh catfish & fresh veggies served in a tamarind broth.  At the price of $14.95, it was enough to fill both of our stomachs! 

DON'T be surprised if you find yourself thirsty.  I think they use the tamarind broth seasoning in their soup.  
...and DON'T forget to come after 3pm, some items only offered during dinnertime. 

SERVICE: ***** [Friendly & FAST!]
AMBIANCE: **** [Clean!!! ...except the bathrooms, but it's expected]   
FOOD:  ***** [Wide variety of food choices at dinner time starting 3pm]

1559815,2011-05-23,0,03icrim6SfEQJlejDMbzsA,"My wife wanted us to try this new place out.  And, I am glad that we did.

The restaurant is located kinda on the outskirts of Chinatown.  It is located within the Koreatown mall complex.  Unfortunately, there is not alot of activity within this mall.  We did not think it was a very good location to have a restaurant... kinda out of the way and kinda hidden.
If you are facing the mall, it is on the right corner slot.

As you walk in, it is a pretty nice place.  However, there were not alot of patrons when we were there (granted it just opened).  

The menu selection is huge.  We ordered a glass of water, thai tea, banh kho, bun bo hue, and pho dac biet.

Okay, the water tasted like bleach.  Yeah, it did not go over well.  Great thing is that I mentioned it to the manager and she gave me a free bottle of water instead.  That was very sweet of her.

The Thai Ice Tea was good.  Little bit too rich; however, I just poured more water to make it less powerful.

My favorite dish was the banh kho.  It is like patties topped with some fried onions, shrimp, and other spices.  You wrap this patty in lettuce, mince, herbs, etc.. and dip it into some fish sauce.  It was great.  Only issue was that they did not give us enough lettuce.  Wish they did.

The bun bo hue was okay.  It was not too spicy.  Such a shame!!  wish it was.  Also, I was disappointed that they did not have the pork feet.  Hey man, what can I say????

My wife tried the Pho Dac Biet.  She said it was good.  The broth was very tasty and better than most places.

As for service, they were really good.  Since we were the only ones in the restaurant, we had great service!

As for price, it was a bit more expensive than most vietnamese restaurants.  I guess they have to charge more because of the distance and less clients.  

Overall, my wife and I really like this restaurant.  Service was excellent, food was not that bad ~ actually above average and good, and price was okay.  Personally, I think this is one of the better vietnamese restaurants in china town.

We would be back!

Let's start with the disgusting fresh spring rolls. When I took a bite I notice no only did they put shredded lettuce ( YUCK ) inside of the spring roll, The lettuce was wilted and old. 
The peanut sauce tasted sour and had a really odd funky taste to it like it was spoiled.
By far the worst fresh spring rolls I've ever had in my life! 

I ordered the combination pho dac biet which took forever to get to the table. Considering the restaurant wasn't even busy I found this to be odd. 
Finally the pho arrived and tasted like a swamp of MSG.
Again they tasted a funky sour taste -
The food is off here for some reason.

Have been back about 4 times and it is consistently good. Their tofu is always fresh. It probably helps the freshness quotient of a restaurant to be in the same shopping center as an Asian grocery store (Greenland Market).

You first walk in nothing really special about the place like the decor although one stands out they do have two widescreen tvs (just happen last sunday night game got me some pho and football). The service is ok. They were very prompt getting my order but came too getting refill on soda took till empty and never checked up on me once got my meal. 

Really talking about the food everything was very tasty, very reasonable price, and get lot of food. I started with asian salad with flank steak. The flank steak should reword it too teri beef (local style), The cut of meat was exactly the same style think slices of beef plus marinaded in teriyaki base or sauce. Honest I could have just had the teri beef over rice and be Happy camper! It was on salad greens. I not big on the whole salad part but wanted too try something new besides my pho plus I was starving. I did eat everything both salad and pho.

The pho order the #34 but its the one that has everything in it. Tendon, tripe, meatball, etc. I normally don't get the meatball because not big fan of it in my pho but love everything else. I like in tasting mood so like why not. I was happy I did. It nice small ball of bountiful of goodies. In every scoop get piece of eat different treat! The noodles perfectly cooked and the broth had nice flavor too it. I by far no expert on pho broth plus always put my siracha and hoisen in my broth. I always make point too taste the broth first. Me always good sign is the less put of both the better I feel the broth is. I really like the broth. All the vegetables nice fresh, crisp, and looks good.

The flavor was okay, a teensy bit spicy, enough to make my nose run. I didn't touch the lettuce that came with the Bun Bo Hue, it looked old and wilted...gross. To be honest I felt pretty ripped off because this bowl was like $7.75

My bf ordered a small bowl of pho which was decent and he also ordered the BBQ pork sandwich, it was pretty big for $4, a footlong I think it was but my bf was pretty pissed because he said all he tasted and saw was a bunch of lettuce and onions and very, VERY thinly sliced pork... 

I also ordered the coconut smoothie which was ok. 

Service was ok, they didn't talk much. The man however annoyed me a bit because he didn't even know what was on the menu! And when the food arrived he tapped the utensils as if we were dumb and didn't know where to get it. Rude much?

The soup was delicious and full of flavor! I got the pho dac biet (pho special with everything in it) and it was full of flavor, a ton of noodles and lots of meat as well.

I came here to try their Pho without any expectations. I was starving, and Pho always hits the spot. I ordered a large bowl of their combination Pho (#1 on the menu), Cha Gio and Iced Vietnamese coffee.The coffee arrived first but was surprised, and a bit disappointed, it came premixed. I was hoping they would bring the Vietnamese coffee strainer and all. I wasn't impressed with the coffee. It didn't taste fresh. I suspect they brewed a big batch and mixed it up with condensed milk and refrigerated. It tasted like a stale coffee with crushed ice. The service was friendly and polite though. The lady took my order within quick minute I sat myself down.  However, it took them half an hour to serve the soup and the egg rolls considering the place wasn't busy/packed on a Sunday afternoon. I didn't complain for the long wait as I was watching the bus girl as she cleared, cleaned and sanitized the tables, and the older guy (maybe the owner) admonishing the cashier while he ate his lunch of rice noodles with sriracha and hoisin sauce and broth on the side.

My soup arrived, suprisingly, lukewarm. They were a bit stingy with their fresh herbs and bean sprouts. The herbs for my pho didn't come with ""culantro"", the jagged elongated green leaf. Even the herb accompaniment to my cha gio was lacking slices of cucumber, and had only 5 sticks each of pickled daikon and carrots, and just one lettuce leaf for 4 rolls. The accompanying nuoc cham was very watery, and to say the least, bland. I had to add a teaspoon of chili paste oil for extra kick. Though the soup came lukewarm, the broth was good.  It was beefy and rich but I didn't taste the subtle presence of star anise, cardamom and cinnamon.  I had to add a teaspoon of sambal olek and few drops of nam pla  and a drizzle of hoisin sauce to make it somewhat close to the broth I've tried and savored in the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.   Pho Saigon's was/is not as good as Los Angeles' Pho So 1, Seattle's Pho Bac, or Denver's Pho 79 or Fredericksburg, Virginia's South Vietnam House . I usually finish my pho, broth and all but this time, I left half of the broth.

The cha gio was smaller and thinner to what am accustomed to. I didn't taste the presence of the ground pork skin or the rat's ear mushrooms. To me, personally, it didn't taste like a Vietnamese cha gio. It tasted more, and if it was skinnier and longer, like Filipino lumpia.
This is my first venture to Pho Saigon and though I wasn't that impressed, I am, for sure, going back for another try.",W9C7l46Me0iuzbio_0BhdQ,0,0,3,LkI2m0IGlCatBfXZkk0J0g

This restaurant has all the right ingredients to make Vietnamese people happy. Good food. But that's just it, good food doesn't cut it when the majority of California Viets end up at Pho Kim Long because of proximity. What this place really need is a maitre d.

A woman comes out (the woman who I spoke to no longer than 20 minutes ago on the phone) 

I repeat myself twice more. She says ""no we don't do that. We don't have that service."" 


I show her my confirmation number and order. 

""No we don't have that service there is nothing I can do to help you."" 


After about 5 more minutes of the same conversation. I get frustrated and walk out. 

They clearly have the option to order online otherwise their restaurant wouldn't be signed up. But they did nothing to help me or solve this issue. Maybe it was the language barrier? I have no clue.

Came here with my girlfriend and her 7- year old daughter on a Sunday for the all you can eat for 12.99 per person ( they charged her daughter 10.99 ) We read online that they had two menus, but upon arriving they handed us one menu that was missing many items that was supposed to be on the second menu.That made me a bit apprehensive, and while I was trying to decide if it was still worth it, an older Asian woman encouraged us to sit and asked us what we wanted to drink -I told her Thai tea, but she insisted on a different tea-she said it would be very good-so I went along with what she recommended. While we were looking over the menu (since it was not a buffet already laid out ) the woman again very strongly encouraged us to order two of anything so "" we wouldn't take all day"" . We ordered -as she insisted- two of each -egg rolls , chicken wings, potstickers, rice , and one bowl of pho. Everything we ordered was very small-usually just two or three pieces EXCEPT for the rice which was piled high on a big plate-enough to fill 5-6 people. After eating all of our food except for only being able to eat about a quarter of the rice plate,I asked for the check (since we were all stuffed) The woman then proceeded to tell me I had to finish eating the rice or I would be charged for another separate order. I thought she was joking, but she then said that I was wasting their food and I had to pay if I didn't eat it! Talk about cheap!! First of all they didn't even have all the items on the menu ( false advertising to get you inside) and then they don't have any food prepared (as in a buffet) then they PUSH you to order too much( I wanted to just try one of each thing at first in case I didn't like it) . Then they try to trick you by making you pay for whatever you can't eat!!? The woman said she told me when I ordered that I would have to pay extra if I didn't eat it all (TOTAL LIE!)
Needless to say-I was angry and told her I wasn't paying extra-my total for three people for LUNCH was already $50 , and it was not good at all -then I am given a total con line that I would expect at the strip from a street criminal!

My galpal and I were greeted with a straight faced waitress who didn't look any less grumpy when we requested to be seated a little further inside the restaurant (she first directed us to a table by the entrance where people hustled and bustled alongside it and wanted more solitude). Sure, we let that slide and thanked her when we got to our seats - she responded by handing us our menu then asking what we wanted for drinks. Water and house tea, respectively. She rolled her eyes on us. After handing us our drinks a couple of minutes later, she abruptly asked if we were ready to order. We said we might need some more time to decide. She turned around looking unimpressed. After another 2 minutes, a male server asked us once again if we were ready. I didn't quite make up my mind yet so I had my galpal go first. We were beginning to wonder what the rush was. By the time I made my decision, I called up another one of the waiters who patiently got my order down while the previous 2 rushed around the restaurant. (Yes, we were attended to by 4 different servers tonight. Not something I always come across) 

By the time our food arrived, we already savored enough of the environment to feel its unwelcoming vibes. The servers looked aloof and there was that uneasy quiet-ness to the restaurant that made us notice the flies buzzing around us. My order of the rice bowl (with grilled pork, 2 egg rolls and vegetables) would probably add up to a 3.5 stars. The pork was flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary, the egg rolls were dry and the vegetables were simply bland. I kind of wish I took the chance and waited in line for either Pho Kim Long or Pho So 1 just to get a taste of their better alternatives. My friend ordered vermicelli with an egg roll and reacted the same way to the food - tasteless and 'blah' 

All in all, this place is getting a 2 stars simply because I had great company tonight. We managed to find humor in our situation and laughed it off but this rating is a heads-up for any of you who plan to come here. Explore your options because there are waaay better Vietnamese restaurants along Spring Mountain - Try, as I mentioned above, Pho So 1, Pho Kim Long or even Pho Huang - for the sake of your taste buds.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,2,2,2,v7GnUhzH9-kLHM5_xuCoAg

I'm originally from OC, so I was desperate for some good old fashion pho. Looking through yelp, I was surprised there were so many highly rated pho places.  So I decided to come here cuz it was close to my work place and had a decent amount of reviews. For the amount of food I ordered, it ended up costing me 40 bucks. For food that was NOTHING special in size or taste. I could get the same thing in OC for half that price! What a major rip off. The tai meat was hard and overcooked.  The noodles were overcooked, soft and gross.  The spring rolls were nothing special. The pho and drinks just took way too long to come. I mean come on, we were the only customers there! The service was just dreadful and slow, which made me grumpy cuz I was hungry. I'm just shocked because it looked like the owner/manager was Viet. Our Asian server didn't understand English OR Viet. So I wonder, why hire her? She even gave me the wrong change...didn't believe me until she typed into the calculator.

5123006,2016-08-08,4,03icrim6SfEQJlejDMbzsA,"Came here on a Sunday night to an empty house for their all you can eat and I guess I took one for the AYCE team. Unlimited Vietnamese sounds great but when they remove 75% of the protein from what should exist in a certain dish, all you have is leafy vegetables, rice and rice based noodles. 

The run down:

Fresh spring rolls: The highlight of the meal but nothing extra special, I think I ate 4 orders as each one actually had a full sized shrimp...and everything else on the menu was a bit of a let down.

Potstickers: They weren't potstickers but those cheap Sam's Club quality frozen and fried 
wontons...nothing like the photo on their menu...I guess they ran out.

Saigon Fried Rice: AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. Menu says sausage, shrimp and chicken. A couple of pieces of tiny cubed sausage among egg mixed with a huge heap of fried rice and some diced carrots and cilantro. Super huge portion...super disappointing as it was completely void of shrimp AND chicken. The sign says anything left over is charged a la carte price, so when they heard we had ordered it, the owners must have been high-fiving in the kitchen that they could fill us with rice for $30.

Rice Flour Cake with Shrimp: So-so...a bit oily, it came recommended by the elder lady owner. My pic looks better than it was.

Egg Roll: Was a very long, thin spring roll, not that great...at all. My date thought it was old.

Vermicilli beef spicy soup: Had this twice as it was a soup on par with what you'd expect flavor wise with a good broth except for the fact that the meat was embarrassingly scarce. It also didn't come with any sides to spice it up to your liking (Jalapeno, lime, etc...).

Chicken wings: Have had better at a lunch time Chinese buffet.

Vietnamese pancake: Huge pancake dripping oil with oily drenched bean sprouts and only 2 pieces of shrimp in the whole thing. A joke.

Saigon Fried Noodle: They ran out

Crab rice noodles: They ran out

Fruit and Cake: They ran out

Other Gripes:
-They claim to have 2 menus but most of menu #2 is just menu #1 written out in Vietnamese.
-They actually brought out another plate of fried rice without asking after we forced ourselves to down the first...No way, back to the cocina w/ that!
-Things weren't timed too well between courses, lots of unexpected down time.
-If you are only going to have 8-9 items for all you can eat...don't be out of 3 of them!

How much is shrimp these days? I think I saw them for $3.99 a pound at La Bonita for medium sized last week which is the size they use...would an extra .20 worth of shrimp per dish beat the house if your two customers are already spending over $30 with tax and tip?

Overall I won't return. The options and execution left a lot to be desired. With them being so incredibly tight with the more expensive ingredients I bet they could have turned a profit charging $5 a head.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,9,7,2,KAGEJfaiodrcbW2qwCstYw

Pho Tai (Rare Beef plus Meatballs).  Not a big fan of their broth here...a bit bland and not very exciting.  It's not bad, just not very noteworthy in my book.

Oxtail Pho...not bad. Same broth, so again, not too much flavor really. The Oxtail was tender and tasty, but super fatty and not complimented with the broth IMO.  I like the Hawaiian style thicker/heavier/saltier broth to go with Oxtail myself.

Combination Banh Mi...this was pretty good! The sandwiches had lots of ingredients and flavor, and the bread was soft and tasty.  Recommended!

Vermicelli Noodle w/Grilled Pork, Shrimp, Sausage and Egg Rolls ($8.95). This was also good!  Lots of goodies in here, and everything was yummy.  I'd order this instead of the pho!

Che Ba Mau ($3): Coconut Milk, Red Bean, Mung Bean and Jelly. This is like a Vietnamese Halo Halo lol. It's very tasty...love the sweet coconut milk and red bean combination!  Yum

So it's a hit or miss kinda place for me.  Good luck!

I prefer the made with meat broth, but I like to see lots of green things floating around in there, and that is what Pho Saigon delivered to my table. I think my eyeballs popped out a little when I saw just how many vegetables were in there. It was hard to fit my spoon into the bowl between the celery, broccoli, carrots, bok choy and tofu. 

The noodles were a good consistency, and the pho broth was solid. They brought out individual plates of the pho fixings, which I thought was a nice touch. The fixings looked pretty fresh. I also like that they have two size options. A small is always more than enough for me.

When I lived in San Diego, some of the owners of Pho establishments figured out how to bypass the Yelp Filter by going WAY out of their way to take the proper steps. I mean, they would clear their cookies, register their accounts at the public library(for IP address reasons),  make tons of friends, invest their time into writing one detailed 4-star review per day for 30 days, and then when the filter believed that they were real people they would write a libelous review about their enemy.  These fraudulent reviews usually looked something like: ""I got food poisoning here last night. The owner stole my credit card number and bought Burberry with it. The health inspector came in while I was eating and shut the place down. The cooks are Mexican! The owner isn't Vietnamese he is Filipino! There were cockroaches in my Pho, I ordered the rare steak pho without cockroaches but I got them anyway!  The srirachi sauce was actually aids blood.  I was molested by the owner when I went to the bathroom"".  And when I lived in Los Angeles county, Pho restaurant workers used to vandalize competing restaurants, and they would always get into physical altercations in public when they would run into each other. There is a lot of politics and backstabbing in the Pho business. What many people don't know is that frequently one Pho restaurant will be started by a group of Vietnamese immigrants, then one member of the group will betray the others by breaking away and making his own restaurant. This is usually the root of the hostility. The moral of my story is that one of the main reasons all the Pho joints on Yelp average a 2 1/2 star rating is because of these ""Pho Wars"".  So don't go on Yelp to try and find a good Pho place. Just run around town and try various places. See which ones you like and decide for yourself. 

PHO SAIGON is one of the better Pho places I have been to in town. The broth is oily and clear. The steak is bloody and tender.  They pack your broth with sliced green onions. And the store has a good location.. it's located in the same center as Greenland and my personal favorite restaurant: Sushi on Rainbow!  

The Pho at PHO SAIGON is actually really good. Pho is a simple dish to me, it doesn't have the complexities that Ramen has. I personally believe that Pho is Ramen's inbred twin brother.  PHO SAIGON does a great job at presenting a Pho which is quite typical of what you would find at popular douchebag hangouts such as Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1.  The reason I like PHO SAIGON better than Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1 is because you(the reader) sucks, and you eat there. I don't want to eat there and completely suck with you. No one wants to suck, right? So come to PHO SAIGON and be ""cool"" like me.

I support all Asian-American businesses so this place gets 5-stars by default.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,12,8,5,uIflVJwI0uGdYUsqAuPyUQ

Had Durian smoothie and friend had Jackfruit the durian was not to my liking but I can say I triied it. 

Fresh rolls or ( spring rolls ), foot long sandwich with Korean beef was mine and friend had the pho' with steak flank. 

The spring rolls really good though I was missing basil ? I have been to a couple of pho places that put basil in them tastes really great that way, however can tell there really fresh. The Korean Beef Sandwich was really good I have a few suggestions though its hard to eat cilantro as a whole with stem attached maybe they could pick apart or chop also the cucumbers instead of slicing them on a bias maybe try julienne them this would look really cool to match the carrots they have its kinda hard biting into a amazing baguette and have to chew for five minutes with out chocking. The Korean beef was flavorful and tasted yummy. 

The pho looked amazing I also seen some pho dishes that looked like crispy beef or chitlins ? maybe next try that. The bread was amazing normally I dont get excited bout that but have had some bad experiences in the past either soggy bread or worse 

Overall ok",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,1,1,3,f_VQ69ThHNuvBqlneJdanA
5986296,2014-07-12,0,03icrim6SfEQJlejDMbzsA,"I always come here for authentic Vietnamese food when I'm in Vegas. I live in the OC, Little Saigon, so know good Vietnamese food when I see it. This place has reasonable prices and great food. My family usually gets pho...can't go wrong with that or the com tam (broken rice) As for myself? I'm a Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (grilled pork and egg roll vermicelli) kind of girl. I ask them to hold the Bun (vermicelli) tho = less carbs. 

The service is decent, not great but not poor either. I've never had a problem with the service. I guess they could be a little more friendly, but let me ask you this. If you are a shy, introverted person and that's how you've been all your life, do you think it's hard to change? This is how the owners are and their workers are pretty much the same in how I observed. But it's not going to stop you in making the best Vietnamese food outside of Vietnam and Little Saigon now huh? 

I'm still going to go back to this place even though it's a little bit off the strip and away from the other thousand pho places along Spring Mountain.

5 stars is for the food!",ZHNsOxD9iNyGQXsO1T9piA,0,0,5,V_A5PEimggqyEarl4WIt-w
