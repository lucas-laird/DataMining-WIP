Its skin was too thick that I couldn't pass it to be Xiao Long Bao, it's just a regular dumpling with thick skin. So that was disappointing. The taste was okay, not considered bad, just the skin was too thick that it shouldn't be called Xiao Long Bao.

 At the end, the server also messed up our check. He gave us a check that is not ours. If we were dumb enough not to look before paying, we would have paid more than what we had actually eaten. The server made a mistake and gave us a check of another table, and the wrong check contained more expensive items than what we ordered. 

I might go back to give them another chance and try some other menu items, since the beef chow fun was okay (at least better than Chinatown), but Zine won't be at the top of my list.

All in all, I can't say that I would eat there again. It's just overpriced for the quality of food that you get. If I want good Dim Sum at a good price, I will go 10 minutes from my house down on S.

1119213,2010-06-08,0,liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA,"This is a new, high-end Chinese fine dine eatery in the Palazzo Hotel and Resort. It essentially replaced the former high-end Asian restaurant called ""Woo."" We chose to try this restaurant only because of a voucher we received in a hotel package. The voucher allowed us to take $30 off of a bill of at least $60 total. We thought, ""what a good deal!"" Well, on second thought, NO it wasn't!

The food:

Overpriced Chinese food. I hate to say this, because to the contrary of popular belief, there IS such a phenomenon as expensive, high-quality Chinese cuisine that is absolutely worth paying for. Zine, however, is NOT such a phenomenon. While the description of the restaurant alluded to a variety of Asian dishes on the menu, it mainly Chinese cuisine, with the exception of a few Vietnamese ""phou"" dishes. 

Mao Pao Tofu = 20 dollars
Sirloin Beef Cubes = 30 dollars
Cup-size Hot/Sour Soup = 8 dollars

And no, the quality of the food was not worth the extra charge. The presentation was sloppy (I swear the noodle joint @ Bellagio (Noodles) can do better than this). The taste? Sure it was good and tasty, but I am absolutely convinced you can find this same taste and quality from a local Asian eatery (probably on Spring Mtn Road) 5 minutes away by car. 

Service:

I have to admit the service was top-notch. They constantly checked on my table, asked us if we needed anything else, and it made me realize I should focus my criticism not on the staff that was simply working here trying to make a living, but the overzealous owner or hotel mastermind behind this careless restaurant concept. 

Here is a warning to those who are planning to use a similar voucher at any of these Palazzo restaurants: they will automatically calculate the 18% gratuity based on your ORIGINAL total, not the discounted total. So while my bill essentially came out to around $50 dollars for two people, the 18% tip was based on a total of course $90. 

Overall:

I would probably not come back here again unless there is a miraculous price adjustment to their menu. I would to reiterate that I am a proponent of expensive Chinese food, though it must prove its extra worth through quality and taste. Zine does not justify the price of its menu and I truly believe that without the voucher currently being offered to Palazzo residents, Zine would see little business in far future.",KAU0uc4Ff_RNfJ_3_BKgug,0,0,2,RglTsT0jZJAmFPS4NhGyQw

Filet Mignon Noodle Soup: Pretty good, but didn't blow me away. Seemed a little under-seasoned.

After a night of partying up Vegas-style...... ok fine, I meant hanging out with the 2-year old at the mermaid aquarium in the Silverton hotel..... we were looking for something to eat before heading back up to the room.  Palazzo doesn't have many no-frills restaurants in their lobby like the Venetian does, so we decided to have some quick Chinese food at Zine.  I knew it wasn't going to be cheap, but that's ok.

As for service, it was pretty non-existent after we ordered.   Normally, I would let it slide if they were busy, but they weren't.  I had to go to the front to ask someone to get the bill.  Even after that, it took about 5 minutes to actually get it.

$18 for pho.  Yes, the beef noodle soup that you can get a decent bowl of for $5-7 depending on your locale, just weaker and three times the price.

The jellyfish salad - OK flavor, could have used some ponzu or some other acid, but cut way too thick.  Jellyfish should be the consistency of soba, not chow fun.

Steamed pork buns - OK, but nothing to order again.

Duck and winter melon hot pot - If I'm paying almost $20 for it, I want the duck deboned.  Nothing is more annoying than picking out tiny shards of bird bones from your food.  If it were cheap-n-rustic, I could forgive.  Yes, the bones lend flavor, but turn 'em into a stock for cooking.

All in all, the food was fine. We were tired and had just come from the air port, ready for our first meal off the plane. We weren't expecting anything extravagant, but it filled us up and we were satisfied.

If you're looking for an amazing food experience, this isn't the place to go. But if you want to just grab a friend, eat somewhere with really pretty interior design, and relax in a sea of red lanterns then I'd say go for it.",L-2fUdw72MXSgQyhGYsaMg,0,0,3,0uz6Nx_3sBSbjvuo9x3Wog

The decor is upscale and the service is much better than a casual dining restaurant. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are huge. 

Most times it's not too busy as there are tons of dining options to choose from.

Prices are 2-4x what you would pay in a Chinatown somewhere in the world for the same dish.   However, if you keep in mind you are in a high end casino, the prices are reasonable when looked at from that perspective.  This is one of the few higher end sit down restaurants that are open for lunch.

Their $15 lunch prix fixe is a good deal.  You get a soup, entree, and dessert.  The mango papaya cold soup I had for dessert was awesome!  Too bad I have no idea where else I can get it.

If you like PF Chang's, you will find Zine to be a couple of classes up and more authentic.  

If you like authentic Chinese restaurants usually, you will be complaining at how expensive Zine is but you will appreciate the quality, cleanliness, and service.

Just because we're Asian... At a 'Fancy' Asian restaurant, we were treated like 'Asians'.. Meaning 'No respect'.. 
When the food arrived, they handed my food 'Across' my mom's face to give to me...the whole time eating.. NOBODY came by to ask how we're doing..
The table beside us, a 'White' family... When their food arrived, they were placed in front of each diner... Without reaching across another person's face...

I had to flag down a waiter/waitress to refill my iced tea.. 
It's so sad these people are so ignorant to treat other Asians like this...

The pho had was spicy thai (so sorry not sure exact name but it thai spicy one/ Lol!). I really enjoyed! The broth was for me always the measurement of any Pho. I was tasty with body for flavor and could taste that thai or spicy kick too the broth. I normally put shiraca in my broth but with this one no need. I did put bean sprouts and thai basil tradition. Pho prefect dish after drinking helps settle the stomach.

We order couple appetizers pot stickers, pork su mai, and steam bun with pork. I loved all the appetizers! The pork su mai especially stood out for me. The filling was awesome. It had lot of depth of flavor besides the ground pork. It nice moist on the inside and steamed perfect on outside. I loved the steam containers dim sum style they served both the pork and steamed bun in!

Imagine taking your neighborhood chinese/vietnamese restaurant, decorating it with a lot of gold & crimson, then sticking it in the Palazzo...
... oh yeah, and then tack on an additional 50%-100% to the prices.  

EXPENSIVE BUT TYPICAL CHINESE FOOD
Traditional Chinese food is generally inexpensive but apparently, Zine is the exception to the rule because they serve the exact same dishes you can get off of Spring Mountain Rd. for half the cost.  Case & point:  Thai Coffee = $7.  And it's mostly ice.  
... Normally, I don't bitch about pricing but this is downright obnoxious for the very unremarkable food they serve.  Folks - there is NOTHING special about Zine's cuisine - it's just a compilation of chinese & vietnamese foods.  In fact, I could name a few restaurants in Chinatown that serve the same dishes but taste soooo much better for half the cost. (I'm not gonna though!  These are my own private restaurants... [grin])

ZINE = ORDER IN ONLY?
I'm actually convinced that this restaurant exists if only to provide Chinese 'whales' with immediate Chinese dishes in various styles, be it Hong Kong-style, Szechwan-style, Cantonese-style, etc. because they seem to be able to do ALL of these styles at lightning speed.  And I've seen orders come in to the restaurant from what appears to be the high roller suites and they seem to jump on those faster than the dishes I had just ordered.  
...Meanwhile there's rarely anyone in the restaurant.

ONE UPSIDE: VARIETY
This is one big big menu.  4 pages of single spaced menu items.  One right after the other.  Don't believe me?  Check it out for yourself.  http://www.palazzolasvegas.com/assets/pdf/jademenu.pdf
If you're Jones'in for Chinese food and want something in particular, this is a good place to start because they seem to have everything here.  For a ridiculous price of course.

WHAT ABOUT THE FOOD?
Everything should look familiar since it's what most chinese restaurants carry.  I'm not going to even bother listing the things I ate, suffice it to say I ate 12 dishes over a 2 day period and ALL of it was very average and overpriced.  Nothing at all stands out at this restaurant.

TRY WOO.
For a truly tasty & satisfying Chinese meal, try Woo.  It's sorta Chinese but it's not really ""Fusion"".  It's more like Chinese food with different pairings of tastes & sauces that compliment each other in ways that you probably aren't familiar with.  The result is an explosion of your taste buds.

CONCLUSION:
This joint serves weak dishes at Rockefeller prices.  Don't be surprised to have the meal total $80-$100 for two.  Then ask yourself when was the last time you ate Chinese and actually PAID $80+ BUCKS for 2.  
...It's convenient to get to if you're at the Palazzo but if you're there, why not just eat at Woo for the same pricing?

2-Stars.  Seriously folks.

---------------
WHAT'S UP WITH THE 4+-STAR REVIEWS?
Do people not know the difference between good Chinese and mediocre Chinese?  In a town with places like Pearl, China Grill, Woo & all sorts of other Chinese places down Spring Mountain, why would anyone rate this joint a 4-star or a 5-star?

Ambiance/Vibe - Not your typical Chinese restaurant.  It's very upscale and expensive but you can dress casual.  I came in shorts and a t-shirt.  The decor was simple yet elegant.  The service staff is excellent too.  I never saw the bottom of our glasses.

1st Course: Assorted Dim Sum Sampler - It came with shu-mai, veggie eggrolls and potstickers.  Since it was a sampler size, it was enough for both of us (one of each).  I liked the shu-mai and potsticker and although the eggroll was crisp, I didn't like it so much.  I'm not a big fan of vegetables.  The shu-mai and potsticker tasted better than a lot of the restaurants.

2nd Course: Chinese Lobster Salad - Salad was very fresh and it same with Chinese croutons and Mandarin oranges.  I'm probably the only person in the world who's not a fan of lobster so I traded my lobster pieces for more oranges to my brother. 

3rd Course: Chicken Corn Soup - We had a choice between Won Ton, Hot &amp;amp; Sour or Chicken Corn but we both opted for the Chicken Corn Soup.  This soup was no joke; it was the size of 3 regular soups at a regular restaurant.  The bowl was so deep, my brother and I had a hard time finishing it.  It was making me full but the soup was so good.

4th Course: Honey-Glazed Walnut Prawn - My brother got the Classic Lemon Chicken.  Both came with Fried Rice.  Since this place isn't like any other Chinese restaurants, the serving isn't family-style.  It was served to us as individual entrees.  The picture might look like a small serving, but it's not.  The portions were more than we could finish.  Plus the soup was filling and we were trying to save room for the dessert, so we actually had left-overs.  My brother liked his chicken and I liked my prawn - both were delicious.  The walnuts were nicely roasted and glazed.  I'm not a big seafood eater, but I absolutely liked my prawns.

5th Course: Dessert - I got the Mochi Ice Cream (Vanilla) while my brother got the Mango Pudding.  They were yummy in our tummy!  If this place wasn't so fancy, we would probably licked our dessert plates, hahaha.

And by the way, my brother said that their Ice Tea was the ""best"" he ever had.  It was a good mix - not to sweet where the sugar didn't overpower the tea.  Overall, it was a really nice dining experience.  If it wasn't so expensive, I wouldn't mind coming back.",sAb47uEcSjK3uQcylhkhPw,5,4,4,40eOiWJbO_KLLxglfEZ_og

Since i was lazy to walk anywhere to eat (well, i'm always lazy to walk), it worked out well.  And if the restaurant is within viewing distance from their craps tables, well let's say i don't stray too far from home.

I was shocked to see how huge this place was upon entering, and the place was maybe 15% full.  It's quite elegant and very quiet inside.  I think i saw tv's in the back bar area, which I wasn't expecting for this restaurant.  

The food was average, some bright spots, some lows.  The shrimp and pork wonton soup was a touch salty, and not really warm.  The honey walnut prawns, which i was very excited about, were disappointing.  Covered with mayonnaise, it was too overpowering and you couldn't taste anything but the mayonnaise.  It was like they dipped my head inside a jar of Hellmann's.  As for the wins, the mongolian beef was flavorful and i appreciated the texture of the beef.  The pan fried noodles were a surprising winner.  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.  

All in all, it's good when you're lazy and at the Palazzo, but i wouldn't call it a destination spot.  It's also a little too expensive for Chinese/Vietnamese food, and especially for the small portions they give out.  $18 dollars for pho? $20 for fried rice?  OHN.

Ordered the steamed pork dumplings (xiao long bao), steamed shrimp dumplings, noodle soup with pork and pickled veggies (Taiwanese staple), and filet mignon pho tai.

Har gow- eh, it was decent. 4 pieces. typical dim sum fare.

Steamed pork dumplings- omg, what a disgrace to even call this that name. I had 1 piece and was thoroughly offended. He had a piece and made the funniest this-is-gross face. We left the last piece untouched. 

My noodle soup with pork and picked veggies was so bland and tasteless that I just couldnt eat it after a few bites. Instead I ordered beef noodle soup. 

Beef noodle soup came to the table 5 min later. Holy shit. It was freakin spicy as hell! I thought I was gonna die. They had added 10 red peppers in there. Not kidding. My mouth, throat, tummy, and ass was on fire. I'm really ticked off that they didn't indicate the spicy factor on the menu. It took me at least 30 min or more to get through half the dish.

My DC had the pho tai and said it was awesome. I only had some broth, so I can't comment on it. 

Anyways, this place is not recommended. The bill was about $81, which included a thai iced tea, vietnamese iced coffee and hot tea. Hells no. Never again.",-9I98YbNQnLdAmcYfb324Q,7,6,2,2E1gNqPPOTtCSjVolCL76g

I agree with what many say that the place is overpriced, but we clearly had a better lunch than many.  Don't know if they're inconsistent, or if we just ordered better?  Here's what we had:
-Shanghainese Pork Dumpling: A pretty basic dish that is hard to do badly.  The dumplings did take a while to come out (we were told this in advance), suggesting that they are fresh.  They were freshly steamed and pretty good.
-Cantonese Roast Duck: This dish was small but very tasty.  The duck was nicely cooked, and the skin was flavorful and crispy.  Enjoyed this.
-Satay Ox Tail Noodle Soup: Our waitress was very pleased that we both knew what ox tail was and that we liked it.  Apparently most of the whiteys that go there don't.  Living in LA, we eat everything!  This was super interesting.  Viet-style  Pho, with Thai-style satay base, with Chinese-style ox tail.  It says it's spicy and I'm sure it is for some.  I wanted it hotter, so we doctored it with some of the sauces on the table.  I enjoyed this dish a lot.  Great mix of flavors!
-Singapore Style Curry Rice Vermicelli: Again, good flavors and interesting mix.  We enjoyed this too!

Overall we enjoyed our meal but, admittedly, it was expensive.  I was also mildly annoyed that I needed to leave the restaurant to use the restroom; for this price, but a restroom in your place like all the other medium-upscale places!

The sauce on the side which is some sort of Hoisin sauce was a perfect complement. The soups are also good but you could get the same thing at other places at half the price.

4047996,2010-08-03,4,liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA,"Zine, SHAME ON YOU for calling yourself a Chinese Restaurant and even worse an upscale Chinese restaurant... 

Some of the reviewers complain that Zine is overpriced, but that is to be expected being located in Palazzo. As long as it's good, I don't mind paying a premium for good food. However, Zine's food not only lacks in quality, but also in taste and presentation. And, as far as their service goes, let's just say I've gotten better service at my local KFC. 

I know better than to eat Chinese food on the Strip and that for real Asian food you need to go to Spring Mountain Road (8 min cab ride from the Strip). However, being hungover, I was delusional in thinking that Zine deserved another chance. Yup, I blame it on the alcohol (we'll the after effects that is).

Come Friday afternoon on 7.30.10 at 1:30 PM, my friend and I were extremely hungover, starving, and craving Chinese food aka hangover food. We were about to walk over to Noodle Asia in the Venetian, but remembered that we had a 15% discount for Zine as hotel guests of the Palazzo, so we decided to give them another chance.

When we arrived at Zine, it was once again near empty so we were seated promptly.

FOOD/DRINKS:
*Iced Lychee Drink ($7.95): Disgustingly sweet. It was a literally a can of lychee in syrup placed into a glass and then topped w/ ice. If anything, this should be called a dessert and NOT a drink. 

*Potstickers ($8): Meh! This was actually gyoza (Japanese potsticker) where the skin is much thinner and borderline translucent. Although the bottom of the ""potsticker"" was crisp, the chicken filling was completely tasteless. The accompanying sauce wasn't much help as it tasted like diluted sweet soy sauce.

*Siu Mai ($6.95): Meh! We ordered this the first time and it was just as bad the second time around. The skin was completely dry and so was the meat. This was definitely not homemade, nor steamed. *ahem* Microwaved.

*Har Gow ($6.95): Meh! It arrived cold and the skin was hardening on the tips. The shrimp filling was dry and tasteless and was missing the crunch from the bamboo shoots and the hint of ginger.

*Fung Zhao ($4.95): Pictures speak a thousand words, so I will let my picture do the talking. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA?select=oX3NocjM0NOBQPQvivrsrg

*Fried Tofu ($8): It was ok. The firm tofu was battered lightly and fried to a crisp golden brown. Tofu is naturally very bland and takes on the flavor of other ingredients and sauces. The accompanying sauce was so diluted that it tasted like water.

*Steamed Pork Spareribs ($4.95): It was ok; however, it wasn't cooked correctly. The spareribs should have been mixed w/ the black bean sauce and then steamed. However, Zine steamed the unseasoned spareribs first and then topped it w/ black bean sauce. The spareribs were tender, but were flavorless unless you got a piece of the black bean which was extremely salty b/c it didn't get a chance to break down during the cooking process. 

*Salty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice ($16.80): FAIL! Everything about this dish was wrong. The white chicken meat (should be cooked w/ dark meat) was overcooked and dry. Normally, salty fish that's been soaking in a salty briny oil is used so it flavors the rice w/ hint of saltiness from the fish. Instead, they used shriveled up fried salty fish pieces. There were a barely any scallions and no ginger, so there was lack of freshness and aroma. In short, the dish was bland and I broke the cardinal rule when eating Chinese food...dousing soy sauce ALL over it.

SERVICE:
Same as the first visit; cold, rude, and inattentive. It took nearly 10 minutes for the waiter to acknowledge we were there, even when the restaurant was near empty. The staff was also terribly disorganized; every time a food runner comes out w/ dish(es) they didn't know what table ordered what. 

Just as much as a degree doesn't give you commonsense, the chef receiving a ribbon from Le Cordon Bleu doesn't give him the credibility to cook ""authentic"" Chinese food. Harsh, I know, but sometimes the ""truth"" does hurt.

The noodles were pan-fried, but not enough of the noodles were pan-fried.  I would say 5% of the noodles were crispy.  Also, most places tend to over-sauce the pan-fried noodles and that makes any crispyness soggy.  To add insult to injury, the scallops were not cleaned properly and had grit in the meat.  The chicken and fish fried rice was good.  Not enough meat.  The best dish we had was the combo BBQ.  We had the Roasted Duck, Spare Rib and Pork Belly.  This was done excellent.

Zine's menu was typical Americanized Chinese food. Although it's suppose to be a noodle/ dim sum place, there weren't enough dim sum choices to put dim sum in the name of the restaurant! There were a few noodle choices in addition to pho noodle soups. But I was expecting all-out noodle/ dim sum fest type menu, PLUS some typical Chinese dishes. It's more of the other way around. But all criticality aside, what about the food you ask? I ordered green onion pancake, a bowl of Schezuan beef and tendon noodle soup, and iced tea. The pancake was a lose/lose for for me. It didn't' taste like onion at all, but more like butter. Heck! If you poured some syrup on top, I would of thought the pancake was from IHOP. The soup, however, is what hooked me. It was soooo GOOOOD. The flavor and freshness made the soup absolutely amazing. It was a pretty decent sized bowl, and I ate it ALL, broth included.

The decor is nice, the staff is okay. I really don't like having to ask for more iced tea, it's my pet peeve.

4484313,2010-06-04,0,liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA,"Zine is an upscale Asian restaurant that was labeled one of the ten best in America by Chinese Restaurant News. Chef Simon To, the recipient of the blue ribbon award from my alma mater (can you say that about culinary school?), Le Cordon Bleu, has created a menu bursting with excellent renditions of the more popular items you find on Cantonese, Vietnamese, and other Eastern menus throughout the valley. I would like to try everything on his menu, however, due to the extraordinarily high prices you pay for these renditions, dining here is more of a luxury than feasting on similar versions elsewhere.

Between the two of us, we ordered four items. The amount of food was more than enough, but surprisingly, we didn't leave stuffed - a definite plus. We started with the Rare Filet Mignon and Beef Ball Pho ($18), a version of the traditional Vietnamese soup. The filet was  tender, the broth was rich, and the rice noodles weren't over-saturated with liquid. My only regret was that we hadn't ordered the version of the soup without the beef balls, not because they were bad, but because the filet was so wonderful. Likely a traditonal pho would not contain filet, however, so this pho is a particularly indulgent one and the hefty price tag confirms this.

We then moved on to the steamed Shanghainese pork dumplings ($9.25), which for the record, are the absolute best I've had in town. China Mama on Spring Mountain has been reviewed as having the closest version to those of the incredibly popular Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, but Zine puts those to shame. At China Mama, the technique just isn't down. The dumplings fall apart at the bottom because they are too thin, releasing the coveted broth prematurely, and the crimping at the top is inconsistent and often sloppy. Zine is the only place I've seen that can compare to Din Tai Fung, however, they don't have the great variety of options, a sad yet understandable difference. Unfortunately, they also cost twice as much, but for a Strip restaurant I'd expect nothing less. If I put myself on a food budget, which I really need to get around to doing one of these days, I'd order these alone and wouldn't need much else.

We finished with some dishes from the ""Chef's Special"" section, all of which end in $0.80. I think this is supposed to make the consumer lucky. We had the sauteed vegetables ($16.80), which were impeccably dressed in a light garlic sauce and cooked beautifully. The little pearl mushrooms were a welcome and unique variation, however, I was hoping for Chinese broccoli rather than regular broccoli. The Honey Glazed Walnut Prawns ($28.80), a personal favorite, could have come out hotter but were delicious nonetheless. The dish consists of extra large prawns that have been lightly battered and fried and tossed with a mayonnaise based sweet sauce and, of course, honey glazed walnuts. Sounds healthy doesn't it? I found the quality of this comparable to same dish at Ping Pang Pong in the Gold Coast, but due to the fact they cost double at Zine, Ping Pang Pong wins my walnut prawn competition.

Other than the prices, there was nothing about Zine that would make me not go back. Each dish we had was skillfully prepared and well-balanced, so if you see a dish on the menu you've enjoyed elsewhere in Vegas, chances are it will be better here. Just don't forget to eat the lucky dishes so your gambling habit might pay off and cover the cost of your meal.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,1,0,5,Knpf77ICHOZyIJ924xEnDw

Yeah yeah yeah you heard it from me a gazillion times, I'm not a Chinese food fan...so take this review with a grain of salt perhaps?

First, the restaurant wasn't that busy and the server (and kitchen) was really slow. For a party of 6 people, our food came out in largely varying times. Majority of our party's dishes trickled out except a couple, so we asked about them - twice. So about 25 minutes later the remaining dishes finally arrived. 

We had vouchers and our server was clearly annoyed about it. Maybe she was really cranky about working on Christmas. We politely explained the situation and tried to be nice about it and smile instead of giving her a hard time (hoping it would lighten her mood)....well, she was non-receptive and further decided to be short and unattentive. At least the hostess was nicer....

I ordered the wonton noodle soup which was bland, albeit the more ""healthy item"" on the menu. The bok choy was not ""ripe"" enough and the broth was...off. The egg noodles were sooo tangled I started getting frustrated about trying to eat them, hahaa. No I did not finish my dish.

The spicy scallops were very spicy omfg. Way over-sauced. The scallops weren't cooked right and overall tasted like spicy mush. 

The sweet and sour soup was just ok but I would not ever get it again. 

The only good thing about my meal was my lychee drink which was fresh and light with real lychee fruit, none of that fake stuff.

Everything was overpriced and not that good, I did not enjoy my time here and it was not a good value even with the vouchers.",nlowCDWvJBurOGGMXzjqHA,2,1,2,_3-aqnduVTxVrNMXWOxP_w

Service:  There were a lot of servers (ratio was probably 2:1 servers to customers) so there was never a problem to get anything.  Food came out at a decent pace.  Check came out fast when requested.
Food:  I had the beef congee (porridge) and I thought it was good.  It was very simple and I added a touch of soy sauce to it.  The beef were small chunks but soft and delicate.  I would definitely get the dish again.  My friend thought the pho was ok (filet). I ordered the appetizer sampler (2 potstickers, 2 egg rolls, 2 shrimp tempura, 2 pork dumpling).

Occasion:   Lunch
Party of:  Two
Ordered:  American ginseng with chicken soup, minced beef over rice + egg, satay oxtail and tendon noodle soup, lychee iced drink
Total incl gratuity: $120

Yes, you read right. $120 for two people for Chinese food.  Is it over-priced. Extraordinarily!  Is it worth it?  Absolutely.  After a long night of party hopping from LAVO, to Marquee, to Tao, being seated in a quiet booth in the corner and lunching on Chinese is the way to go.

The American ginseng is amazing.  There is a word in Chinese that describes the effect this soup has and I'm not sure if I'm translating it properly, however, drinking this soup really provides a ""healing"" effect especially after what we put our bodies through in Vegas (8+ hours of 5 inch heels, taking in second-hand smoke...you get the idea).  The bowl is small and runs you $20 for one, although it is SO good.  I was skeptical of the minced beef initially.  It is a dish normally not ordered by the typical Asian person.  It turned out to be generous in portion and very tasty.  The raw egg is stirred into the saucy beef mixture and tossed with the rice.  It is served piping hot in order to cook the egg.  I don't think this dish is on the menu so it must be special ordered.  Finally, the oxtail and tendon soup is good in small doses but a little overwhelming when you're eating a large bowl of it.  This is dish you'll want to share amongst two to three people.  Oxtail is meaty and the satay flavor is strong.

We enjoyed ourselves so much at Zine, we came here both days for lunch! Although steep in price, I think Zine makes for an excellent choice for good Chinese food inside a hotel.",gm0V0GmBBlUlTqoZHsjWqw,1,1,4,TP2FPOy_ncP73ASdzb9DjA

5049661,2013-02-06,0,liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA,"Since I come here fairly often, I figured a running list of dishes would be the most help I can give. This place is consistent with food, but I understand the price has really scared off people. That's the thing with Chinese food is that often times even if it's cooked well done, we have a mentality it is ""cheap food"" and again, this is a expensive casino and is a nice dining place and it's not like their prices aren't posted on online menus. Some dishes are not worth getting at the price they need to charge to be inside a expensive casino property but some are fantastic. If the basics or Americanized favorites are what you want or you are rather frugal of a traveler then do yourself a favor and go up Spring Mtn for half the price. Otherwise, if you like a nice ambiance and nice quality over thrift then read on. 

I guess this review is gonna be the most useful for tourists than locals. Granted I get special hookups of sorts now which makes it more affordable for me but even so I would pay for my favorite sea bass fish dish at full price. 

One way to get savings is they actually have a Happy Hour! It's half off all the appetizers (you can see menu online)  and beers! It's 3pm-6pm Mon-Fri, and 10pm-1am Sun- Thurs. They also do lunch specials Mon-Fri until 3pm for $15 which is a soup, entree, and mochi ice cream. 

Best dish - baked Chilean Sea Bass. It's a rather good portion for the $32 that is shareable, 2-3 filets of fish. It's baked in a sweetish glaze and on a bed of zucchini, tofu, whole roasted garlic, mushrooms in a light sweet and tangy sauce. Its one of my favorite fish dishes ever.

Best surprise- the pho. It actually is some of the best pho I've had as the ingredients are top notch fresh but the broth balance is lovely. It is double the price, but if you're going to pick having pho here or at that place in TI and don't want to go up to Spring Mtn to get off strip prices, just come here instead as this one is rather good. 

Other stuff I've tried: 

Crispy pan fried noodles - Had it with various toppings but my favorite was the seafood one. Really good, fresh and plentiful with seafood. Other meats are good too, but it's standard. 

E-fu w/ crab - one of my favorites. E-fu is a soft braised noodle and is every bit my comfort food Chinese dish. I loved e-fu as a child and still do. The crab in this is fresh and the portion is hard to finish. I order this very often.

Rice vermicelli noodle with shredded duck and pickled cabbage - I like this as well, better if you ask for some hot mustard to mix into as it adds the right amount of omph to it. It is a subtle dish and normally not a fan of vermicelli (except pho) but I love the sauce that is in this and the combo of pickled cabbage in it. This is also something we order a lot. 

Curry Crab- really messy, but a awesome tangy and fragrant curry. It probably takes away from the dish a bit to do the curry on the side, but seriously was hard to crack shells covered in sauce no matter how delicious it was. 

Seared Scallop with Schzuan Pepper Sauce- the sauce is good and they do give you plentiful big scallops but they were cut in half thinner and well cooked which I don't prefer so I haven't ordered again. I may ask whole piece and not well done. 

Shredded Pork and Thousand Year Congee- pretty good congee. I know thats a very plain and subtle thing, but a sign is it didn't really need soy in it. It was well seasoned on its own. 

Yang Chow Fried Rice - it's bb pork and shrimp fried rice. Pretty good and flavorful, no need for any seasoning, except I do love hot sauce on my rice. 

Cha Gio- they were decent viet style egg rolls, but not my favorite. Also I was missing the plentiful herbs, It just came with lettuce and nuoc nam. 

Macau style pork belly- the portion isn't very huge, but it's perfectly cooked. Crispy skin, melty fat and juicy meat. 

Spicy Chili Wonton - nice fresh made wontons in spicy oil and sauce. Pretty good as far as dim sum go. 
Spring Onion Pancake- theirs is good, crisp and comes piping hot fresh. 
Black bean sauce pork ribs - one of my favorite dimsum and theirs here is really tender. 
Shrimp har gao- good, but standard. Same goes for the Shumai. 

Red bean pastry with vanilla ice cream - it's basically like spring onion pancakes except with red bean instead. A pretty good dessert with a bit of vanilla and chocolate sauce. 

Service here has never been bad, it's always in a acceptable range of good to really good depending on who we get. There's a few people we prefer having, that has been here a while and are ninja intuitive with diners needs. 

I'll keep adding to this list as I dine here.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,12,2,5,JwOtTxy7PdLohUhaveljwA
5055342,2010-03-09,4,liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA,"Saturday morning/early afternoon, we woke up hungry craving for dim sum.  By the time everyone was up and ready, it was almost 2pm so we needed to find a dim sum place that was open later or 24 hours.  Upon searching on Yelp, we found this place at the Palazzo and thought it would be convenient since we were staying at the Palazzo.

We walked downstairs and into the restaurant and stood there while the hostess was on the phone where we waited to be seated.  The restaurant was empty with the exception of maybe 3-4 tables filled.  The decor was nice and upscale and we knew we would be paying a pretty penny to eat here.

The menu is filled with high priced items which includes Chinese, Shanghainese, and Vietnamese items and the portions were extremely small.  Light eaters can finish multiple dishes with no problem.

FOOD:
-Steamed Pork & Shrimp Dumplings (Sui Mai) - The meat was rubbery and it didn't taste fresh.  It tasted like it was frozen and reheated in the microwave.  $7 for 4 pieces.  

-Steamed Chicken Feet - I personally didn't eat it, but one friend said it was okay, the other said it was bland.  $5 for 3 or 4 pieces (we ordered two orders).

-Steamed Shanghainese Pork Dumping (Xiao Long Bao) - Decent, but not as tasted as I've had at other places.  It lacked the broth inside too, but was still served with the special sauce.  $9 for 6 pieces.

-Pan Fried Noodles with Seafood - The $19 noodles weren't even crispy and was too ""saucy"".   

-Beef Chow Fun - Probably the most decent dish I ate, but it still didn't have enough flavor.  

-Hainanese Chicken Rice - EXTREMELY disappointed in this dish which cost almost $17.  The ""special"" rice that comes with it barely had any flavor and the pieces of chicken were extremely skimpy.  The ginger sauce lacked green onions and salt.  

 -Roast Duck - I didn't eat this dish, but we had leftovers when the serving size was extremely small, so I'm assuming it wasn't the best dish.  

-Fried Rice with Dried Scallops - Not enough salt in the dish, it was extremely bland.  We spent our time adding soy sauce to add some kind of flavor to the dish.  

SERVICE:  
Horrible!  The staff was extremely inattentive and not very friendly.  The waiter took our order and disappeared within seconds after we were done.  The only time we saw any of the staff members was when the food arrived, any other time, they were no where in sight.  They do pack your food if you decide to take it to go.

CONCLUSION:
I am extremely disappointed in this restaurant, I left the restaurant unsatisfied and not full.  Being in one of the high end, 5 star hotels on the strip in Las Vegas, I would expect better quality service and food. Pricey food is expected in Vegas, but quality is as well and this place lacks quality all around.  Use the money you would spend here and cab it to Chinatown where you'll probably get horrible service, but at least the food will be good.",YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ,4,0,1,C9lUJjM-0TvmS7zfLSW8Vw

       - Ambiance - This is a fancy Chinese restaurant. Plain and simple.
       - Value - You're not really getting value from this place. All the dishes are about twice as expensive as your normal Chinese restaurant with only a little better quality. You're pretty much paying to eat at the Palazzo.
**Ordered**
       - $10.50 Chilled Jelly Fish - Your standard Jelly Fish appetizer. Portion and quality wise, it's standard (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zine-noodles-dim-sum-las-vegas?select=ag2_JZA1cw80fMH4y1jGSQ#ag2_JZA1cw80fMH4y1jGSQ).
       - $19.80 Ma Po Tofu - A decent amount of Tofu with bits of ground meat to keep it filling. It goes great over rice.
       - $32.00 BBQ Combo - You get 3 choices and we got the duck, pork, and cold chicken. Everything seemed a little higher quality than you'd get at a normal Chinese restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zine-noodles-dim-sum-las-vegas?select=6HIB5tmvQ-dpQfprj4v2Tg#6HIB5tmvQ-dpQfprj4v2Tg).
       - $18.80 Fu Chow Fried Rice - If I ever come back, it's because of this dish. The concoction of seafood, creamy sauce, and egg over the fried rice is probably one of the best things I've ever tasted. This is a must try (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zine-noodles-dim-sum-las-vegas?select=IGBA0jtvRQh4RUAdy3nGKA#IGBA0jtvRQh4RUAdy3nGKA)
       - $6.80 Mango Pudding - The dessert was sweet, but not too sweet. They pour this sweet milk over the pudding. It's a very lite and delicious dessert (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zine-noodles-dim-sum-las-vegas?select=48iUdH1NvIDOHxjYjFRgwg#48iUdH1NvIDOHxjYjFRgwg).

My boyfriend ordered a dish, the waiter asked if he wanted rice and my boyfriend replied ""does it come with it?"" HE LAUGHED and walked off like we couldn't afford rice. Every dish and drink we ordered the slammed it down on the table and walked off. Some other waiter had to fill our drinks. That waiter was so much nicer, we wanted to go ask the manager if replace him with our waiter.

By far, this is the worst restaurant that i've been to. Portions are kids size, this isn't a french restaurant.

This was the second of three lunch dates that the No1DP and I had over the course of our last Vegas stay. 

Zine Noodles Dim Sum is located inside the Palazzo casino floor. This was rather convenient as we didn't have to get out of the Venetian/Palazzo hotel complex, but as with all Palazzo restaurants a bit of a walk to get to from Sands Expo, the site of many a convention. It also didn't help he only had a little more than an hour for lunch.

Service was really slow that day, even if only half the restaurant was full. It took 30 minutes from when the orders were placed to the appetizer being served. No1DP was a little late to his next class because of this.

Appetizer: Steamed Shrimp Har Gow. $6.95 gets you 4 pieces. The har gow was relatively big compared to other dim sum places and the wrapping was not too thick. The har gow was even better when I dipped it in the chili sauce.

Mains - When the main dishes came we were rather surprised how big our dishes were. Each dish could feed at least 2 people. This was my first meal of the day (dunno how much No1DP ate beforehand) but the No1DP and I were only able to finish half our dishes. Note to self: next time get extra plates for sharing because it seems like these dishes were made to be served a la carte and not in individual portions. 

No1DP had the braised E-Fu noodle with crab meat ($18.80). E-fu noodles are used in Cantonese yee mein. In normal preparation these egg noodles are deep fried. These noodles are often eaten on birthdays as the long noodle represents long life. They are normally chewy and eaten with mushrooms. The noodles themselves were chewy and absorbed some of the flavor from the mushrooms but a tad dry and plain. Real crab pieces were used in this dish.

I had the satay oxtail and tendon noodle soup ($19.95). Broth was DELICIOUS. I could taste the peanut in the broth and the soup reminded me of a mix between a panang curry and kare kare (just put bagoong in the meat!). There was a bit more fat in the oxtail but the meat fell off the bone. My only complaint was that the chopsticks were a bit thick and I had a slightly hard time picking off meat from the oxtail.

Should I come back here next time I'll definitely get an appetizer and a dish to share with another person to cut costs or stick to dim sum. Although the dishes here were decent the restaurant's prices reflect typical Vegas pricing for casual restaurants, which isn't cheap by anyone's standards. If that's the case find a dish that you can't find in your hometown or if you're going to spend that amount of money anyway on a restaurant find one that offers a more unique experience.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,0,1,3,P1pounPRitA4Zs1CoeQvVA

Chilled jelly fish was missing sesame oil and a little more salt. It was so bland. Jelly fish is one of my top favorite things to eat too and it was a little disappointing how bland it was.
The soy marinated chicken was delicious!  But the portion sized was a little pricey for a quarter of a chicken leg. $16 to be exact!
The chicken feet I would say have to be one of the best dish I had there. The skin fell off the bone and it was so flavourful!

Maybe if you are into PF Changs kind of Chinese food you should try this place. $50 for two people is cray cray. That would feed 4 people easily at a real Chinese restaurant!

In terms of ambiance, it's a nice looking restaurant. It's located off to the right side of the casino floor. The inside is nice looking, and our table was pretty big. They had a TV in the back that was playing a soccer game.

The service was AWFUL. I don't think our waitress ever introduced herself, and apart from taking our order, she never stopped at our table. She didn't even ask how the food was (which is pretty normal, no?) and we had to flag her down to get our bill. There was an eyelash (or some sort of small hair) in my teacup, so I asked her for another cup. I eventually had to flag down another person to get me another cup because our waitress never came back. I could understand her forgetting if the restaurant was packed, but all she had was us (a table of 2) and another table of 10 guys.

The food was ok, but I've had MUCH better dim sum. We were thinking about ordering another round, but decided against it because a) I was hungover, b) the food was not as good as we were expecting, and c) the service sucked.

i've been here a handful of times, mostly just for the noodle soups. which were ok. today was my first time having their entrees, and i wasn't impressed with anything we had. it was probably the worst bbq duck and pork i've ever had - tasteless, gristly, just yuck....

12 veggie spring rolls, 4x beef chow fun, 4x fried rice, 4x bbq combo, 3x steamed veg, 2x kung pao chicken, 3x lemon chicken, 3x honey walnut shrimp. bbq combo is $30 for awful bbq - 1/4 duck, 1/4 chicken and maybe 1/4lb bbq pork. $25 for an order of lemon chicken, which is literally 1 piece of chicken katsu w/ some lemon sauce.

I had done my research before going to Vegas, but since I was with my daughter and I like to have flexible days, I didn't want every meal planned out and reserved. So we hit a few places based on proximity, hunger factor, and what sounded good. This was one of those MISSES.

Our hotel room TV made Zine sound so fabulous. They really played up the black pepper beef, so that's what I was craving. And my daughter and I love dim sum, so they drew us in with that as well.

Well, there is no dim sum. They've got appetizers that you would see on any Asian restaurant menu. Period. Dim sum? Not really. Ambience was really nice. Service was really good. Food was MEH and it was outrageously expensive. Our meal was $104 and we had no alcohol and we didn't even eat the $30 plate of Walnut Shrimp. Yes, $30 for what you get at any Chinese place. Only this wasn't good and my daughter ate one shrimp and then pushed the plate aside. They really should have comped us.

The black pepper beef, I will grant them, was super tender. But it was flavorless. Literally. And it was $32!

We also shared pot stickers (standard) and Vietnamese Egg Rolls that came with a clear sauce that we couldn't figure out if there was any flavor at all. It definitely wasn't fish sauce. I love fish sauce. These rolls were really bland.

So Let Me Repeat: If you want to throw away your money on bland, overpriced food, this is your place. If you want better food, go to McDonalds. If you want to spend your money on fabulous food, go to Gordon Ramsay Steak or Raku.

The Hot and Sour Soup I ordered was very good, but the Kung Pao Chicken ($24) was no more memorable than what I can get at Panda Express.  The dish has red/green bell peppers and water chestnuts(?) as fillers, which are my personal markers of a cheap dish.  I expect fillers in a $5.00 Panda Express portion, but not a $24.00 meal.",g70IK4LQ8Cf4i6M-n4Hwyg,0,0,2,nBFUO4BEUX8wcvU_S7kOlA
