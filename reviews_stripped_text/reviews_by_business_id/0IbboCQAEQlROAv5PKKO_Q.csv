44712,2010-08-19,0,0IbboCQAEQlROAv5PKKO_Q,"Tried this place out since it got a good review...ehh overall it was okay. I ordered the Shaka Box which had a slice of spam, teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef, and a mahi mahi. The amount of food was a lot, so of course I couldn't finish it (leftovers for work). 
The place is small so if you have a big group of people order take out. Prices are not bad at all for the amount of food you get. The combo I got was only $7.95. The spam musubi was $2.15 for one, which is a big size for a spam musubi. However, it was ridiculously packed with too much rice. Yes I know it's suppose to be like that but seriously you couldn't really taste the spam.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,0,0,3,0RXEsG1Ppm-F3V_u2jdEzQ

The gravy was also v good.  I also had a spam musubi it was solid .  Everything was good  but did not blow me away  . If I was in the area would not hesitate to stop by.",3dbkO9K5vcvJXuKrVu4BMA,1,1,3,B1MoVN1yalE09nee0KfKJw
787295,2010-09-16,1,0IbboCQAEQlROAv5PKKO_Q,"I went ahead and gave it four stars reluctantly although I would rather give it 3.5.  The Loco Moco from here is one of my favorite guilty pleasures. It's a super filling, tasty dish.  If you order anything priced $7 and up, you absolutely get your money's worth.  The portions are huge. My only problem with this place is that when i started going here almost two years ago, they never burned my food.  Now, every time that I order anything that is not the Loco Moco, it always gets burnt.  So I've basically avoided ordering anything but that for more than a year now just because it's not worth my money to get a whole bunch of burnt meat.  I might have to try again soon and update my review and then check to make sure that I hadn't offended someone there unintentionally.  Maybe the reason they don't burn my loco moco is because it's easier to spit in my gravy, but it's so delicious that I can easily get that image out of my head when I'm feasting on an order.",6Bv7-Epx8047a4LZ9ywF8g,1,0,4,CTYR1D5CGc2BuEC6MxADLQ

They have the best macaroni salad in history!  The prices are very reasonable too. The customer service beats every other establishment out of the water!

1631543,2011-01-11,0,0IbboCQAEQlROAv5PKKO_Q,"Hands down the best Chicken Katsu in Las Vegas! The Katsu sauce is really what makes it even better! Their portions here are big so it is well worth your money that you pay for it! 

Since I moved here from Hawaii 7 yrs ago, I was always craving plate lunches like at L&L and was glad to find one here, but I was really disappointed with the food there. It was overpriced and greasy....I'll write a review on that one later! We stumbled upon this place when I was working at Smoothie King across the street, my parents were waiting for me to get off work and ate there, of course getting me a Katsu Plate to go. I was a regular there quite frequently. Some of my other favorites was the Mahi Mahi plate, Loco Moco, Teriyaki Chicken Burger, Katsu Curry (Chicken Katsu plate with Curry on top), and Teri Chicken plate! 

They served Poke here once in a while and the Chantilly Cocoa Puffs too!! 

Its sad to say that they have closed down on December 24, 2010. But they said if things get better, they may open up again! It was a good run while it lasted....now where the heck am I supposed to get bomb Katsu????",CmPjoba7N2ZSa3goSsSN6Q,2,0,5,twF8pYffVvUBl6VdlIC_pA

They give you an insanely huge amount of food here, so be prepared to have leftovers! The combo plates are enough to feed 2-3 people, depending on appetite. A ways off the strip, though, but so worth the drive!",kHmXUEOAsIbguUrPoX6Tkg,0,0,5,nf8fSMS11lAf5P8WHbtdqw
3075671,2010-04-30,2,0IbboCQAEQlROAv5PKKO_Q,"Like others have said, great hawaiian grindz in Summerlin.  Like most places like this it's cheap and you get a ton of food.  The katsu is what I get probably 2/3 of the time or the chicken combo with katsu and BBQ chicken.  The mixed BBQ plate is solid of course too.  I have eaten at a half a dozen or so hawaiian places while I was looking around for a good one and this is it, I can't really imagine what a place could do to be better, maybe just as good I guess.  Once in a while I venture out and try a new place and I am usually disappointed.",WANhIVSoD5oIIu2LfKx5Ig,3,1,4,vwJbXSFBE-g5gal91rqCYA

We stumble upon this aloha island restaurant that made this cold weather feel more snuggly! I was really surprised how fresh the food was Thanksgiving Day. I'd fly back for some more macaroni if I can!  Chicken katsu was too delicious! Definitely a fan of this place and they were really clean and accommodating to all my questions about how to food was prepared.

The place gets a little bit busy sometimes but its well worth the wait. I would definitely come back to visit whenever I am in town again.",VfJ2jzzoSyrCiZqG1gnL1Q,3,3,5,lEaNu-BxnwQUHy7VTarXew

When I got there the cashier was apologizing about the short ribs ...he said some looked a little small. When I looked at it I was like OMG! this is more than enough for me. I can't even finish it ...and believe me I tried. I just found out they can customize combos for you which is great on days like today where I didn't know what to have ..chicken or beef? It was so good and most important the rice and the macaroni salad tasted just right. The macaroni salad also comes with the combo. Even though L & L is much closer to me I prefer this place because of the great service, the food tastes better and you get bigger portions.I also like that they have a variety of different desserts to choose from on a daily basis.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,5,4,5,qboCF8kOxVKqvvXLbp07Dw

Their chicken katsu is one of the best ones I've had by far. The katsu had the perfect combination of crunchiness to juiciness. Their grilled chicken had excellent flavor. Don't forget to pick up some dessert! The Chantilly Coco Puffs are a must.

I've been loving the katsu from this place since they were at their original location on Sahara and Maryland Parkway.

Everything that we have tried so far has been great.
The Katsu is a perfect blend of juicy and crunchy and their katsu sauce is my absolute favorite.
The Bar B Q beef is juicy and not dry.  Unlike other Hawaiian places, they don't need to compensate for mediocre food by over-marinating.  

Other favorites include:
- Portugese Sausage Musubi
- BBQ Chicken Musubi
- Curry Katsu 
- And of course, their Authentic Hawaiian cakes imported direct from Mike's Bake Shop in Waianae!! ! 

They don't always have the cakes, but when they do, you had better grab one.  As a matter of fact, we have a fresh Dobash in the fridge right now and I hear the milk just calling my name.  I'll get back to you guys later.",j3Xr0XifJTb43Hdmue8b9A,1,1,4,5fUU8LV_WrHASizxjYffPQ

The loco moco, chicken katsu, Island grilled chicken, BBQ plate, mahi-mahi, poke, saimin, mac-salad,  sticky-kine rice, kim chee, musubi, etc - everything is good here!
The only improvements would be furikake for the rice and if they served manapuas (steamed and baked)!
Yah - it gets busy, but only because it is soooooo good!

If you are hungry for ono local foods in Vegas, take a short drive to Aloha Island Grill!",1TsY_wvCLQvL3mNHUcHo4A,0,2,5,UpQj-SzSc9g02nfU_PZBsw
