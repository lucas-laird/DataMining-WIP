Everything made to order so it's fresh! It's a nice family owed restaurant and everyone is very nice! I come here at least once a week to get a taste of good Mexican food!

384419,2012-02-09,0,SknYYIK1rBNgYqNl4tYUPA,"This review is specifically for the breakfast. We pick up the breakfast burritos once a month or so. The staff is always very nice and they do a quick job of making your order. You can get bacon or ham, but we usually get bacon, ham, and potato, which is a great value for $5. You can barely finish them for a breakfast item. The tortillas are some of the tastiest I have had anywhere. I would highly recommend for breakfast, they are open early. I have not tried any of their lunch items.",4sy5iPF-XKl2I5uRWsaBEw,1,0,4,rmxWv4rRZ6WIv6-wFSj7wA

Our 'go to' are the Chicken Flautas...They are amazing! My husband loves their menudo. Reason for taking off a star: The service is not great. The salsa bar is always empty and they close too early on the weekends!,FrY8lOa-2R9kUO6NvniBNg,0,0,4,2F1TCRTO2T3BQBRLWRaDcQ

Restaurant is small.  Relatively clean.  
Prices seemed about $.50 - $1.00 more than most other places for most items. 
For the Flautas it was worth it, I don't mind paying a smidgen more if the food is great.

Didn't take me long to find it, with its bright colored windows advertising $1 tacos and delicious burritos. I walked in and was greeted right away, they had a wide array of meats and freshly made Aqua fresca. I ordered the Cuban sandwich, and was very pleased by the size. I was able to watch the cook prepare it, from toasting the bread on the flat top stove to placing the eggs, cheese and variety of meats on the bread. It was like dinner and a show I guess in this case lunch and a show. When I got to take that first bite it was the most amazing thing ever, I got a perfect blend of everything. I will definitely be going back and will recommend friends try this amazing place out.",ao0yrutF9q_IklN825sTZw,1,1,5,YPF4tF2GJt80zkiIN32TBw

The food is simple Mexican fare, nothing special, but it is good comfort food. I especially enjoy the carne asade nachos - they'll never make the cover of a foodie magazine, but the nachos never disappoint.

The problem would be that the .99 cent tacos are really the only deal there.  As other people have said, this place is more expensive than Robertos/Amigos/any other place for the same quality food.

I will keep going for the lunch deal, and that's about it.",vFiwwcmzSEXNKMsTdvWVhg,0,0,3,hioRWoperheCzzg6Mv0img

Asked to have a quesadilla on corn & not flour tortillas because of wheat allergy and to start them first 'cuz he was very hungry but all the food came out at same time - quesadilla in flour & wrong sauce on the enchiladas. When I brought up the problem she said quesadillas were only on flour (couldn't say they would not make it on corn before having us pay for it?) Then when my remade enchiladas were done they just sat on the counter until I happened to look up & the cook pointed to the counter by the cash register/order taker who had no inclination to let me know my food was ready. Later when I asked if there were desserts she just looked at me until I repeated my question & motioned with her head towards the freezer with ice cream bars. Guess words required too much effort. 
So I advise going somewhere else unless the whole rest of the city is out of food.",vMYKQeuuC9py7VkRCdAquQ,2,1,1,FUJKPrxKODbP6sJ5TiAf6A

They always seem to be just busy enough for you to wait a little bit which is a very healthy sign.  The Breakfast burritos are packed with eggs, beacon, cheese, and photos.

The food is what you would expect, it's pretty good, not too expensive, and it comes out quick.  Since the food is rushed out so fast, you often get meals where the cheese isn't remotely melted.  Generally they just rely on the heat from the food to melt the cheese.  Staff has been friendly and the place is usually pretty clean.  I give this place 3 stars because it isn't anything special, but still good.",-PHC1ulwHkY4LEmMqmFwPg,1,1,3,iBCrkawLpoK_k2dVwVTvTA

2699667,2016-09-22,0,SknYYIK1rBNgYqNl4tYUPA,"I'm a regular at this taco shop. Everything is relatively inexpensive and it tastes authentic. My go to items are the 99 cent chicken or beef tacos and the green sauce chicken enchiladas. Both options really great! 

Make sure to get an order of guacamole- it's simple and has a great consistency (a nice add on to any item). 

Also, and more importantly, the red sauce at the sauce stand is the best I've had at any taco shop. It's spicy but doesn't have the overpowering chipotle flavor. 

The main reason they lose a star is because even though the tacos are great, there isn't a ton of meat in them!",WcHrKAGuewJxxlPqlelN4g,1,1,4,z1WP_yCZiuklBQig5j1T9Q

Microwave to cook meats. Soggy rice and taco shells, kinda tasted like packaged fried rice. I am from Cali where the Mexican food tasted like mexican food. Just like how my Abuela cooked. Not tex mex like Robertos. Well here is hoping things get better or someone opens a shop that actually taste like authentic Mexican food.

However, the adobada is still the absolute best meat option at any Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at. And I love Mexican food!! Do yourself a favor next time you're up for Mexican food...
Step 1 - go to Maria's!
Step 2 - order tacos, a burrito, a torta, breakfast burrito, whatever...with adobada!!! I get the #5 combo that's on the wall (two tacos with rice and beans, substitute adobada for the meat).

Menudo was awesome. Lots of tripe in it. Flavor was great though a little spicy if you're sensitive to that. 
This is the first time I had adobada so I don't have anything to judge it by but it was very good. I liked it a lot. 
Carne asada taco, chips cheese and guacamole and quesadilla were average and there is nothing wrong with that. 
The chips were either a little over cooked or just cooked in old oil. I liked them but the Mrs. didn't.
