The only deception is that yelp is sending people on a wild goose chase since el rey de la pinata  is not located on bruce and bonanza. Its actually located on owens and eastern. Address is right but just use your maps app to locate it, thats what i did.",KM0Z-LkRi_QMPZ_6GH6IHA,0,0,5,Xb-umHTmQmZ513paiKGKZQ

The candy, gum, and toys to fill it is really low priced too, but watch the lollipops, most contain chilli and are spicy in the center. 

They have a lot of character party supplies that are hard to come by elsewhere and they are masters of what they do. The prices can't be beat. $10 for a small one along the lines of what you'd find in Target, Walmart, and Party City for much more and their big ones are beautifully made and only $20 a pop They can do any character that they don't already have if you pre-order. This will definitely be our go-to place from now on.",wyMvg42GjucF40jucZs-4Q,6,5,5,6gJSQVLLk7THi4yXvw3Ugg
1890748,2018-04-06,1,4oeqftAA2w9rcffOFaxFLA,DO NOT go here. Bought a piñata with plastic balls by the next day half the balls popped. Came back to the El Rey and told them piñata was defected did not want to replace or give me money back. The manager said All sales are final. I didn't see not one sign in the store that said that or on my receipt. Absolutely no air inside the store which is really hot and also didn't see any business license visible. Front door glass broken which is hazardous and is taped with thick scotch tape. Somebody call the Better business bural. Horrible horrible!!!!,glA_2M3-rdumorpQ7JSaxw,2,0,1,XMoSQx1pqMkApoYQBkNoXg

This store is soooooo underrated! I came in here after going to another store where they wanted $40 for a made to order piñata. It wasn't that long ago I was a child and know Piñatas cannot be so expensive. I pulled up yelp and put in party store and brought this store up. Decided to come pay a visit from all the way in Centennial. 

They have every type of piñata you are looking for, I'm all sizes and occasions. And if they don't they will make it for you! We are having a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" party and the ship piñata they made was so great but incredibly unexpectedly amazing. We ordered it along with a piñata stick. 

I will ALWAYS get my Piñatas from here! They also have a great selection of Mexican candy! 

Incredibly affordable, and friendly!",b7ppmK1yIvK5vx5IcdE-3g,1,3,5,-vyCR_p5We47kFvPahGtOw

4137761,2011-10-18,3,4oeqftAA2w9rcffOFaxFLA,"Who doesn't want to pick up a stick and beat the crap out of something and then have candy come out of it???? 

So if you need a pinata for any function or Hell- just to relieve stress this is the place to go....

LARGE HELLO KITTY PINATA NEEDED.......
LARGE HELLO KITTY PINATA FOUND!!!!!!!!

They have all kinds of pinatas for good prices.
I paid $20.00 for a large hello kitty pinata- for a pinata at a regular store (Party City, Walmart ect...) all they do is put a flattend mylar balloon of the character on a small/medium ball type of pinata and then charge you $14.99 and higher. Sucky deal if you ask me..... JUST SAYIN!!!!
But here you get a pinata that actually is designed to look like your character. If they don't have a certain character on the floor that your lookin for just order in advance and they'll make whatever you want and I think that's $5.00 more. 
They even have wooden pinata sticks wrapped in different colored cellophane paper for only $1.99 each.

The store is a little dim and there are party supply stuff for sale however those seem to be priced higher than at Walmart or Target. 
So I suggest that you buy your pinata here and the other stuff elsewhere.",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,10,3,3,wlelfKjmnYmVS1pFHqu_6A

I drove there to check it out and placed my order. For just $35 I got a huge piñata that was supposed to look like Jay cutler of the Chicago Bears. I picked it up a few weeks later and was quite impressed. It is hysterical.  

I gave them some pictures so they knew what I was looking for. The helmet is a bit goofy looking and the colors aren't quite right but it's worth every penny. The Staff are so friendly and helpful. I bought some Mexican Candy and a piñata stick also. The guy cut a hole in it for me so I can put the candy and other goodies in later. Overall a great experience and I now know where to get a piñata made. Love!!!!!

4888369,2014-03-29,0,4oeqftAA2w9rcffOFaxFLA,I have purchased pinatas here a few times over the last couple years. Other than a not so convenient location they are good. They normally have the character I'm looking for on hand. This last time I went I had them custom make me what I wanted for only $5 more. Since I went in advance for the party I told them I'd come back in two weeks for it. I'm not sure how short notice they will do on custom orders. I told them I wanted a ninja in black clothing; pretty vague. When I went to pick it up it was cute and even looked like it was jump kicking in air with weapons attached. I'll post a picture soon. In all it was better then I anticipated and will continue to return. Other times I've called I've had to use my bad Spanish but recently the employees speak and understand English well.,qXmZkmN305aISAyA92DxNA,2,1,4,NL7mG4bKxFmXOTLoQJARsA
