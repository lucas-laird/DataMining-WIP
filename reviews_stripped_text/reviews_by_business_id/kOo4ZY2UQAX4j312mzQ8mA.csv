If you are catering a wedding in vegas, or a birthday party in vegas I highly highly recommend them. Communication was responsive, using email and text, when the delivery was about to happen. The packaging and prep of the food, was TOP notch. There was considerable effort and pride when packing this food up. Anything that was needed, was included and thought of. The serving utensils were all high quality and professionally presentable. We hosted a Bday party at the Aria sky suites, so drop off was quick and needed to be timed perfectly. Via txt communication we were able to nail the drop off perfectly. I tipped the bell man pretty well, to bring up all the food to the suite. It worked out perfect all and all.

Holy Guacamole!! I can't say enough about how wicked AWESOME this was. I've never EVER had as good a grilled veggies set as theirs, not to mention the carne and pollo. There's not enough time to dig up all the compliments I can think of.

Let's just leave it at that. In the meantime, I'm spreading the word!

An addendum:
Brenda asked about duration of service and costs.  Delivery and set-up was included along with napkins, utensils, warming trays -- the works. They were fast and efficient and then stepped back while the carnage began. Cost?  I wish I knew. But, my daughter did the negotiating and she doesn't want to reveal the dollar amount.

I found Taco Naco on Yelp & was surprised with how simple, organized, straight forward & prompt everything was. I inquired to feed 80 people & paid about $500-$600 for it. This includes tortillas, Asada, chicken, al pastor, chips, guac, tomatillos, limes, cheese, grilled veggies, the food warmers, serving utensils, paper goods (plates/forks/napkins), & aluminum containers you don't have to return. All were high quality from the plastic bowls to the ripe limes and moist flavorful meats. They came right on time as requested & I paid in person upon delivery. One disappointing area was that I felt like there wasn't enough cheese or sour cream, but too much tortillas. The cheese/sour cream ratio compared to the amount of tacos made wasn't enough. I would've traded all the leftover tortillas for more cheese or sour cream (HA). Anyways, I recommend Taco Naco!",XqsuWJIwdy0OXYvUX1I2-Q,0,0,5,uh5i9JDOgdp1zfGnKRZlrQ

I tired his burrito as well.  Both burritos were extremely small in comparison to other quality burritos.  Think--half the size of a chipotle burrito.  The vegetarian burrito was flavorless and the carne asada had flavor but was nothing special.  The burrito was priced at $6 which is standard but not for the size obtained.  They ran out of onions and bell peppers for the vegetarian burrito.  This would have been fine, except I stopped in a few weeks ago to get a burrito and they ran out of beans and rice!  Odd--they sound like they are always running out of ingredients.  One thing that is surprising is that guac and sour cream come standard in the burrito.
