I ordered the Passion bowl, substituting the tuna for some salmon on a bed of COLD, HARD, INEDIBLE brown rice. I enjoyed the fish, but hardly anything else. The seaweed salad was just okay and so were the sauces. My bowl was definitely missing something, don't know what it was, but I wasn't blown away.

It wasn't seasoned properly so it wasn't spicy or salty AT ALL.  Brown rice was too hard--and I eat brown rice all the time. It should be firm and nutty. Not difficult to chew.

They weren't stingy with fish/protein portions, although my fish had lots of cartilage or whatever the white stuff is is that makes fish chewy in some parts and hard to eat. The ingredients seem fresh and they let you add toppings without making you feel like you're inconveniencing them. So, summary of my experience is good customer service but just okay in taste.

The food is tasty and was fresh enough. I love the concept of healthy and sustainable eating. The restaurant is quick service, but is decorated well and inviting. We came in with a groupon and my only complaint would be the cost. Wihtout the groupon, it would have been rather expensive for a quick service spot.

Their preconceived bowls are great but you can also create completely from scratch. I love The Passion Bowl!  Staff is more than happy to tweak your order to suit your preference. My only complaint would be the limited availability of the Raspberry Miso sauce (I'd heard it was amazing but although it is still on the menu it has unfortunately been removed).,Iafv3eVzIdPd1P2gTMp4BQ,0,0,5,FLUeXVnKKqvgmI9iqjnbPg
2077694,2016-11-18,0,gvSn76jIWco_sDxp6090og,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a good place to have lunch and after reading mostly good reviews, we decided to give this place a try. There was one review I noticed stating that they had found a hair in their food which I chose to ignore and figured maybe it was a one time mistake that wouldn't happen again. 
This place is extremely over priced for the small amount of fish that they give. $10 for one choice of fish that doesn't even fill up the entire scoop. Their sauce choices are very limited and while the menu says that they offer furikake, the worker said they do not have furikake and instead, added some black sesame seeds and 2 full sheets of nori. Receiving my food I was very disappointed but did not complain as it was my decision to give this place a try. My boyfriend opted out and we went to Jersey Mike's Subs for him. While I was eating my bowl there, I noticed a LONG strand of hair that was noticeably cooked with the rice. The worker had little to no hair so it could not of been his and had to have been from whoever made the rice. I immediately went back to to show the worker my contaminated food and he did not seem very surprised. He offered to make me another bowl and began grabbing a new bowl but considering the hair must have been cooked in the rice and this had happened to another customer before me, I was not going to chance it.

So I walk in around 1pm and I'm greeted by the worker right away. I tell him it's my first time and he immediately starts walking me through the steps of how to order (simple enough). 

I ordered a build-your-own with a base of white rice, protein choices of ahi tuna, salmon, and crab, and topped it off with sriracha mayo, sesame seeds, and furikake. I hurried my hungry little self home so I could devour this food in peace.

Overall, quality of fish was good. I was very impressed with the salmon - fresh and tasted great. The imitation crab, however... tasted like it had been sitting in some vinegar-y type sauce, which made it taste different than regular imitation crab found at most sushi and/or poke joints. As for the ahi tuna, I'm kinda wishing I didn't get it. It was just meh to me. I enjoyed the salmon best. The sriracha mayo compliments it so well. 

I don't recall what size I got, but my bowl (no extras/drinks/etc) cost about $16. A little pricey.

2138884,2016-11-12,0,gvSn76jIWco_sDxp6090og,We had purchased a groupon for this place and wanted to try it out. So last Saturday we went to the location on Rainbow. Before hand we looked online and on yelp to see what time they were open til. On Saturday night at 7 we arrived to the place only to find the place completely closed.  Mind you everywhere we looked and even on the door said that they were open til 9 pm. No sign no nothing explaining why they closed early. It wouldn't of been such a big deal if we lived by the area. But we live on the other side of town. So my husband called around and someone at the Warm Springs location answered and said that they would accept our groupon at their location. It's was more or less 5 mins away. When we got there the place looked closed. The lack of light led me to believe that.  However the open sign let me know that they were in fact open. There were no customers when we got there. There was one guy working there. He was really cool and talkative. He explained the menu to us and was helpful. I ordered the Buddha bowl and my husband the passion bowl. My bowls base was greens and my husband's traditional. Rice. The fish was good. The sauces were good too.  It wasn't bad tasting. But to us the portion sizes were just extremely disappointing. I found myself still so hungry afterwards. I figured since I ordered greens as my base I'd get more that just a handful of greens or if you can even call it that.  Honestly i have had better poke bowls else where. I really wanted to like this place. This location inside is beautiful. I love the decor. But sadly it didn't reach my expectations as far as poke bowls go. I definitely won't comeback.  I wouldn't recommend it to my family or friends either.,g5czf__WW0nQO_PUMHTFEA,1,0,3,6biTzufIFSp4bpP4IzIbtQ

But it's nice to not feel hurried through a line especially when you don't know much about pok√© bowl building.  They are so nice here and explain it all.  They have some of their signature bowls you could order but I like to make my own with half rice half greens as a base.  Your not eating 100% pok√© so if you get all rice as a base, well rice is dry so expect that and get some extra sauce on the side.  You get to choose your sauce so if you get Orange citrus Yuzu and it's too sour then maybe next time get a different sauce!  I get a little siracha mayo and sesame wasabi and it's a good amount of sauce for me.  They fish is very fresh and high quality.  I love my little bowls of healthy deliciousness!  I get the 4oz scoop of protein and it's a lot and the cost is about $10 which is about the price of a sushi burrito and it's just as super good!

There was literally just a couple at the counter completing their order, while I went about taking photos of this pleasantly decorated casual dining restaurant in the same plaza as SkinnyFat's SW location.  Even the normally packed parking lot was sparsely populated with just a dozen or so cars, probably all belonging to employees working at the restaurants that are still open.

So the guy holding down the fort alone had plenty of time to walk me through the ordering process. As this is my very first time at one of these Pok√© Bowl restaurants (which is the hottest restaurant to open at the moment in Las Vegas) I seriously thought I was done once I narrowed down my pick to the signature combos on one of their boards, but Matt, yes the guy mentioned in many previous reviews and tips, informed me that I still need to pick a base before the rest of the pok√© bowl could be assembled.

So for ""Passion"" (their most popular item) which consists of Ahi Tuna, Green Onion, Ginger, Sesame Seeds, Seaweed and Sesame Wasabi Glaze I overcame my past negative experience at Whole Foods with sushi roll made with healthy brown rice and decided to give Brown Rice another shot. Maybe it was the sauce, or the Tempura Crunch add-on, but this turned out to be really good. Definitely recommended for first timers or anyone overwhelmed by the billions of potential ingredient combinations and temporarily incapable of formulating a timely decision. 

Spicy Spirit (Salmon, Jalape√±os, Cucumber, Pineapple, Mango, Sriracha Powder, Teriyaki) was my second pok√© bowl, which I customized by opting for the recommended Quinoa and Mixed Greens, and sauced with Sweet Chili Gochujang Sauce (instead of Teriyaki).  It was simply delicious. The heat from the jalape√±o slices was good, but eventually exceeded my Scoville Heat Units (SHU) tolerance limit.  The Quinoa on Mixed Greens combination made this truly a Pok√© Salad that is tasty and healthful.

Was it worth giving Netflix a break and getting out of the house?  Is the election process rigged?  Is it a bad idea to provide taxpayer money to build a Las Vegas stadium for the Raiders?  Does adding good vanilla ice cream to a good apple pie makes it just that much better?  Yes. Yes. YES. Yes. 

It was definitely worth getting out of the house, driving past Desert Breeze Park, avoiding the peril of potentially running over any preoccupied Pok√©mon Go players that might dart out of the shadows, and the occasional bad drivers.

This would also be great for those looking for healthy alternative to break the doldrums of having to eat the same weeklong menu of a typical meal prep routine. 

Oh yeah, no fountain drinks offered, but they have cans and bottles of beverages in a small fridge, as well as brewed teas to go with the rest of your order.

Highly recommended.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,8,10,5,2CC_4k2YMwRsGRmTMzxdvw

He ordered the Buddha bowl which is supposed to be spicy tuna cucumbers etc etc. the tuna was ahi tuna with spicy sauce squirted on it not real spicy tuna I ordered salmon with spicy mayo both fishes (tuna &salmon) were not fresh at all tasted like it was frozen then thawed out and sat on the counter at room temp 
The spicy mayo and soy sauce could not cover up the taste of unfresheness and the choices are very few. The fish and cucumbers were at room temp when I bit into it which is not good for sanitary reasons
