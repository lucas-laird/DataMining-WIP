27727,2007-08-28,0,A8IouaHOlMHoVIRuAKbKzA,"Amongst all of the hustle and bustle of over-the-top Las Vegas there is a nice down to earth wine bar hidden in an unlikely location. Located in the Masquerade Village at the Rio Hotel, The Wine Cellar & Tasting Room offers a classic old world wine experience for those looking to unwind and relax over a quality glass of wine. As you walk downstairs from the casino floor to the ""Wine Cellar"" you are instantly removed from the bright lights and noise of Vegas and enter into a quiet relaxed environment enclosed in rustic rock tile and brick archways.
Showcasing around 50,000 bottles, valued at more than $10 million, there is sure to be something on the menu that catches your interest. Or once you have your glass spend some time wandering around taking in some of the rare museum pieces located on site, including a bottle of 1800 Madeira from the cellar of Thomas Jefferson. If you're in the mood for some California cult or other very collectible wines then you're in luck because that's exactly what The Wine Cellar caters to. With more than 100 wines by the glass you're also free to sip here and there until finding that true gem. The professional wine stewards on sight have no problem offering up a taste before committing to a full glass pour. If you feel like some munchies then pair your wine with a multitude of cheese options, served with a basket of freshly baked bread.
Even though they claim to be Las Vegas's most famous wine bar and retail shop I would have had no idea that it was even there unless I happen to glance at a small sign in the parking lot of the Rio convention center with the magical words ""Wine Bar"". And to my astonishment this wasn't like your traditional Vegas cool & contemporary swanky hang-out but instead a nice classic wine bar. Of course the prices are still on par with the rest of Vegas the atmosphere can't be beet if you're looking to escape and savor a glass of wine as you unwind from a days worth of sight seeing or are looking to start the night off.",8VP2LZagEVW6jtYBRBNuXg,3,1,3,zrapYMG4Bw8fHSUMnx8YJw
112877,2015-08-09,1,A8IouaHOlMHoVIRuAKbKzA,"Staff are accommodating but the selection is mediocre and the prices are ridiculous.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that it's absurd to charge $XX for a glass of wine you can find in a supermarket.  When you tout yourself as having the best wine cellar in Vegas, you need to go a little deeper than Cakebread.

That said, you can find some interesting things in the wine-racks.  Interesting, but priced at restaurant prices, less 15%.  That's not interesting to me.",iLjqUgpHkK827yudywPUsQ,6,2,2,Tm7-KruUBv_CommX8DzwMA

Also, their bread, cheese, salami, olives, oven roasted tomatoes, dried fruits, and nuts are a great accompaniment with the wines. They have bottles as cheap as $10 to collections in the thousands of dollars if you are interested in buying wine. The service from Jose was fantastic and amazing!

Once you're downstairs, it looks like a genuine wine cellar.  They've got jazz music playing and you can easily have a conversation in there.  It's such a 180 from whats going on upstairs.  They have a wine shop with a wide variety of wines by the bottle and of course a wine bar.   I recommend getting a flight  as their pours are very very very generous.  

The bartenders are very friendly but also give you your space.  Overall, its a nice hideaway and much better than that wine bar at Mandalay Bay.",pnrG47iwW26dDyHCwEr8UQ,1,0,5,62Sqxd0hU2Ca7NLUcilk_Q

They have an incredible selection of wines to choose from and you can walk around the whole place looking at what they have. There's lots of comfortable seating and tables, but I like to go to the tasting bar to sit. 

I love to nibble on stuff when I drink wine and they have plenty of that here. Plus their wine flights make it really easy to try out different types of wine and not spend a lot of money buying bottles you might not like. I've tried several different types of wines I've never had before because they had flights to try them out. The service here is great and they are very knowledgeable about the wines. Even if you know nothing about wines, you can tell them what you like (e.g., fruity and sweet) and they can pick out some good wines to match what that. I went here years ago with some friends and did just that (when I knew nothing about wines). I would probably say that this is the place that turned on my fascination with wine.",YSxkqt1AVEt8vUvJy-5jxg,1,1,4,HX86n9euz291uWYcRsEi3w

Since we had dinner reservations upstairs at Voodoo we decided to check it out. We sat down and looked at the flight menu and were actually horrified when we saw the prices. We go to many wine bars and have been to various wineries and found the prices completely obscene. 3-2 oz pours were the flights and they averaged $40-$90. A glass of Stags Leap was $47. The labels were all recognized. Cakebread, Silver Oak, Stags Leap... All great wines but why would I pay top dollar for a wine I can get at Von's??  We ended up paying for our bottle of Pelligrino and leaving without ordering anything. We hopped in a cab and went down the street to the Palazzo for drinks at Double Helix. 
Here's a tip: If you want to charge those kind of prices, bring in wines that you can't pick up with your cold cuts.",bsRcyNiPKhh4VSw0S98vbA,15,5,1,htUaJEHrRwI7lAiHZDKC5g

1131190,2015-01-18,2,A8IouaHOlMHoVIRuAKbKzA,I have been to this bar a few times on visits to Vegas and have loved the atmosphere.  I enjoy good wines and  they have a good selection. I went in tonight with my husband.  We described the type of wine we liked and they recommended one.  It was beyond what we wanted to pay at $100 but it was so highly recommended that we went for it. Turned out I didn't like it so much .  While talking to the sommelier we started talking about other wines and some blends I liked. He brought one out for me to taste and I said I liked it better than the $100 bottle. My husband said to pour me some.  I thought he might have been  trying to give me something because I so didn't like what he recommended   When we got the bill we were surprised to find that it was $50.00 for that pour.  Really?!!  We were stupid to not have asked but  I think they should really let you know before pouring you a $50 glass especially  after you balked at a $100  bottle.  I'm feeling taken and will never go back again. Beware of thus place and make sure you know the price before you even taste anything,k98krNalrjQy9YRQNEVemQ,6,1,1,ip09mKPu_xGxa5vTVPRGnQ

My largest issues with The Wine Cellar are its lack of food (although the cheese & salami they do have is excellent) and lack of any reasonably priced wine bottles.  This place is definitely focused on doing tasting flights of wine along with some cheese and when you're talking about flights it's normal to charge a higher markup due to the small tasting portions.  However, the bottle list is focused on aged wine with exorbitant markups and there is very little under $100 which is really what most people would be looking for.  Did I enjoy my expensive time at The Wine Cellar with a group of friends?  Yes.  Will I be back?  I doubt it.",Uv5v7r1eN4XFsKZ2jwn1sg,3,0,3,Anraquz_0zyNVEPFzjpxzQ

The tricky thing is knowing when this place is open, considering the drive from the Strip (unless you happen to be staying at the Rio).

The menu is organized with wine flights, cheese flights and various appetizers.  They have recommended pairings but I wouldn't be afraid to order the food according to your own ideas if you know your own palate.

I won't attempt to drill down too much into the individual wines since everyone has such different palates.  Half the fun of this place is learning about everyone's different likes, dislikes and food bigotries.

Started with flight 5 Grassy Fields and Flight 1 Fresh Cheese.  Cheese was served with sliced baguette french bread.    Cheese was good but nothing wowed me.  Enjoyed the Frogs Leap Sauvignon Blanc, Craggy Fields S.B. was just ok, Surprised by the Compte LeFond Sancerre!  Not usually a big Sancerre fan but this one won me over.

Mentioned to our server that I liked stilton and she produced some to try next.  It was delicious and worked perfectly with the red wines we ordered (Frei Bros Merlot, Grgich Zinfandel, Atardi Tempranillo Rioja).

Had some grapes, cheese and the reds and was in heaven.

The Rioja was easily the best wine I tried and inspired me to order some extra Manchego cheese to pair it with...YUM.

At this point the entire bar was covered with wine glasses, cheese and smiling happy customers.

Servers here are knowledgeable and friendly.  They were happy to let us relax and joined in conversation when they weren't serving other customers.

The Wine Cellar at The Rio is a good place to stop in for drinks either before of after going to dinner in Vegas and has become one of our regular stops when we go to Vegas.

The Wine Cellar is located downstairs from the Masquerade Village in the The RIO. You really need to look for it to find it. The Wine Cellar keeps the noise from the casino floor to a minimum so you can sit and enjoy your wine.

Once you get downstairs, you'll find yourself inside an actual wine cellar where you can either sit at the bar or plop yourself down in one of the several couches they have there. 

There is a wide variety to choose from. You can order wine by the glass or if you're up for experimenting a little, one of the several wine flights they have.

We trusually get the flights when we visit there. Surprisingly, we found the prices pretty reasonable and the pours rather generous.

There is a limited menu of cheese and snacks if you want a little something to nibble on with your wine.

Screw top wine for a tasting??? How very low class and sad. :( They might as well have served box wine. The ($12) charcuterie was boring too (cold bread, cheap olives)

It truly feels like a cellar, you descend a grand staircase, and are in elegant surroundings lightyears away from the casino chaos above. Comfy overstuffed chairs, dim lighting, and great service by a knowledgeable and personable Sommelier await you. The aforementioned light bites are a stellar accompaniment to any libations you choose; the cheese offering more options than the charcuterie. 

We truly enjoyed having wine flights, fromage and conversation in this lovely space. I'm just bummed that I didn't know about it sooner, because I would have been a regular when I lived in Las Vegas. (insert sad oenophile face :(

I was hopeful at first.  You walk down a spiral staircase into a dimly lit, spacious, and pleasantly calm wine bar with comfy couches and chairs.  There were maybe four other patrons, and we were immediately greeted and given a menu by a friendly staff member.  Unfortunately, she was apparently the only one working.

The employee was literally passing back and forth in front of us, not looking at us and busy . . .doing what?  I don't know what she was doing, but she couldn't possibly have been THAT busy because there were only 6 people in the entire bar.

Upon first descending we thought ""this place does look like a napa cellar, how cool""!  A couple of cowboys warned us that the service was slow as molasses, so after a while of waiting at our table we decided what we want and approached the sommelier.  We ordered two flights, and he helped us pick out some cheese to accompany.

During this process, ""it"" started... The reason for which I will never return... The show.  The Rio show where gals and guys in skimpy outfits ride around on a float on the main floor with blaring overplayed pop music. It was loud - REALLY LOUD - down in the ""wine cellar"".  The engineers/architects/managers/designers that came up with the concept of a wine cellar in the Rio missed a CRUCIAL aspect that absolutely ruins the atmosphere.  They should have installed sound proof doors at the entrance.  

Imagine standing in a winery and all of a sudden they start blaring cheesy pop music so loudly you can't talk.  Yeah.  You would leave.  ASAP.  We were out for a birthday celebration so we stayed, but this turned a pleasant evening where we were willing to drop some dough into an ""if it weren't for this, we would like this place"" kind of evening. Maybe they only do the show certain nights, then it would be worth going on off nights.

We switched tables to another part of the area where it was a bit more shielded from chaos above, and giggled at the absurdity and discomfort.  After our wine and cheese was delivered (along with a very nice bread basket), the wait staff was relatively attentive, and friendly when we did talk with them (although remarkably absent for only one other table present on a Saturday night).  The wines were wonderful, the cheese accompaniment was delightful and exactly what we were hoping for... But, I will not return.

Descend the wooden stair case bound by a beautiful wrought iron railing and grab a seat at the wooden bar or in one of the comfy club chairs at one of the numerous seat groupings. 

My husband and I were looking for a quick drink and snack before seeing Penn & Teller at this Vegas institution. We didn't expect to find such a place, but were pleasantly surprised when we stumbled upon the wine cellar. They offer several different flights of wine which are grouped by grape and sometimes region, red vs white, light vs medium to full-bodied and on and on... and the 3 oz. pours are unusually large! Prices for three glasses range from $19-$55 depending on the selection. And they are wonderful--- you can savor your basic sauvignon blancs or chardonnays from California and France or sip on the more medium to full-bodied reds like the Prisoner and David Lust. You can order olives or a cheese plate with some dried fruits and nuts to nibble on. The food is not super gourmet but is just perfect for enjoying with your wine flights. You can also opt to taste sparkling, scotches etc so there is something for any beverage drinker. The gentleman behind the bar is just lovely...accomodating and knowledgable.

3399292,2016-09-10,5,A8IouaHOlMHoVIRuAKbKzA,"So disappointed.  Sorry this place is not at all what I was expecting.  If you love wine, I would not recommend this place.  While they have a great selection of wines if you are going in for a tasting/flight they need to open NEW bottles of vino and not ones that have been sitting on the counter for days.  I have sensitive palate and enjoy good a nice glass of wine and the tasting I had were awful.

As a tasting room, once you open a bottle of wine and you expose it to oxygen the aromatics and flavor start to reduce dramatically. This is the first step of your wine going bad.  After 24 hours a bottle of wine is pretty much shot as it starts to develop stale flavors. 

I have traveled all over the world and this way by far worst wine cellar/tasting room.  My tasting was gross and the wines tasted like sherry and pumpkin notes. This was not very pleasant.

The walls are lined with beautifully displayed wine racks filled with wine and the lighting sells the ""underground cellar"" feel.

You can choose to sit at the bar or one of many inviting couches, armchairs, and bistro tables.  The menu offers many flights of differing varietals and varying prices.  Flights come with a basket of varying breads and of course some water to cleanse the palate.

It took me a minute to find the entrance, which is located near the small Rio stage in the masquerade area of the casino. Descend the winding, wrought iron stair case down to the cellar. There is a feeling of being removed from the rest of the casino. Another reviewer mentioned that they could still hear the band upstairs. It was quite quiet during my visit, but with no band playing, this may have been good timing.

The bar tender greeted me warmly. The offer flights of wine, either red or white. Each of the three glasses had a decent sized pour. The prices vary from $19 to higher, one of the most reasonable options in Vegas. They also have cheese plates with dried fruit and bread to nibble on.

4382397,2018-05-24,1,A8IouaHOlMHoVIRuAKbKzA,"Awesome ambiance and service, but overpriced even for the The Strip.

I've wanted to come here for awhile. My husband and I were seeing a show at The Rio so we came in before our show. There really wasn't much information about what's offered on their website so we went in not knowing what food and drinks were offered. 

Walking in I immediately liked the ambiance. Located downstairs from the main casino area it is a cozy space with a rustic winery feel. Seating includes a long bar, tables, and couches. Seating areas are nicely spaced out. My husband and I opted to lounge on one of the couches and thought it was a comfortable way to enjoy our wine. 

The woman that helped us was friendly and attentive. As soon as we walked in she greeted us and offered us menus. She encouraged us to sit anywhere we liked and she'd be over soon to take our order. We were given the perfect amount of time to look over the menu without being rushed. She continued to check on us enough that we felt taken care of, but not so much that her presence was intrusive to our experience. 

The menu offers many different wine flight options as well as wines by the glass. Flights start at around $30, but most are $50-$60. Each flight comes out to about two glasses of wine. I saw on Yelp that they were working to improve their food menu so I thought they might have a few appetizers. On our visit the menu only offered a couple of cheese flights, a couple (literally two) meats, and items you'd get with cheese plates like olives or nuts. 

We wanted a glass of wine each so we shared a flight of Pinot Noirs. Three of the wines in the flight were good. Ironically, the most expensive wine in the flight was not good at all. We ordered a cheese flight that included gouda, cheddar, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. This was a sad display with some dried fruit around the cheese. It did come with a large bread basket featuring the same breads served at Voodoo. For $30 and a nice wine bar you'd expect a nicer spread with mustards, jams, or nuts. We also ordered the meat plate which had five pieces of two different meats. The meats were delicious, but again the presentation was sad with just a small cup of olives on the side. 

All said, we had the equivalent of two glasses of wine, some cheese, some meat, and a lot of bread for around $140 with tip. I realized later that this spot offers 25% off to locals, but even with that discount this spot would be a hard pass. Next time I'd just skip this spot, spend a little extra money, and have a full dinner at Voodoo Steakhouse.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,5,1,2,h6O3m-GxfTrWkFMcuQcsOQ

Service: Very friendly and professional staff; sommelier was very knowledgeable; service was a little slow at times given the long bar which was broken up by stone columns, making it hard for the servers to see you at times.

Atmosphere: Cozy downstairs setting ... reminiscent of a cellar (surprise); however, music from the band which plays upstairs is somewhat loud and intrudes on the setting.

Pricing: Yes, it's overpriced ... but it's also Las Vegas; I can't think of a wine bar or cigar lounge located in a Las Vegas casino that isn't overpriced.

Selection: I like the wide variety of flights they offer.  I ended up having a glass of Silver Oak (2006 Cabernet Sauvignon) and a tasting of scotch.",Kvbr3lQ9gp3XYlnI8SNRiA,0,0,4,dt-xF8u7svcXIeUiIyJvXw
