There Additional Mexican drinks they have there were literally empty yet they had it in the back some good that does you when you trying to sell your product The cashiers busy and her only job is to ring people's ordering maybe the food runners should step it up I will not return here was not impressed it should stay a hotdog stand at best don't waste your money not worth it",2EqjPdndkBaINJTTdp13Fw,0,0,1,BBu3pGTb6bwXnOC64oNXtg

What's the big woop about hot dogs? Before my first visit, I truly thought all hot dogs were created equal ( or at least similar). Well, it turns out they are not. 

I've tried every dog on the menu. My fav being the house Dog and the red dog(i love anything spicy).

All dogs are not created equal. I've been back 5 times. Diet out the window. The dogs are imaginative, delicious (cooked wrapped in bacon), and hearty (5/1).

I tried to even direct the different breads. Ex. Portuguese roll: I traditionally don't like. The texture, saltiness and taste left me nothing to complain about.

My favorite bread is the lobster roll. I think it's a must. Like driving in a Bentley. Its as good as it gets.",OqZD6bm6MZcRqQVGmhA0Kw,1,0,5,feb3ZXB3Gsopk9Vx0zH86Q

Why wouldn't anyone want to put a hot bacon wrapped weiner in their mouth and just have a foodgasm after? Honestly i've only been to two different hotdog spots like this and I highly approve of the idea. This brings eating hotdogs to a whole new level. 

I fell in love with the vibe as soon as I entered. They were bumping Pac in the back and had memorabilia of his genius. This is place is pretty lit and not too hard on the eyes.

So we ordered the Elote dog and some #Filthyfries. Both were amazing. They even gave us an extra ranchero dog on the side and man. I really appreciate that gesture because that one was my favorite.

My first question was could a dog shop, originally started in Los Angeles,  opening up doors in the desert of Las Vegas really be tgat good....Well, my friends, it is. 

I of course read some fellow yelpers reviews before setting out. Many suggested the lobster bun and one review warned of long waits. When I pulled into the parking lot there were several people at the front door and I thought, dang, here comes the wait, at least I had mentally prepared. As I approached the door, the crowd moved away, and I realized they were standing there in food comas, not waiting to order.  

Inside the business was clean and well lit, with a almost pub feel to it. There were several beers on tap. When I stepped up to order, I told the server it was my first visit and he immediately explained their simple, but delicious menu. 

I order ""The Mutt"", which is not on the menu moard, but a combination of the red and the green. Spicey and full flavored. I also ordered the corn on the cobb, it comes street vendor style, very messy and with lots of flavor.

I ordered to go, and waited about ten minutes,  which I honestly did not think was bad, but when the server brought my order to me, he said they threw in one of their ""house"" dogs for my ling wait! 

Needless to say, once I was home and the food was taste tested, it was a grade A hit. I highly recommend Dirt Dog for an early Sunday evening outing.",p7YdXcQC8Jinl0OWsNxafA,0,0,5,6STzx8uR8q-G9n-1X6YM3g

I tried two other spots for elotes today and this by far was the best,3rd time is a charm. It is a clean restaurant and very spacious. They have the perfect person working the front. Forgot his name but he was a great guy!!!! Please please see photos, tho they don't do t justice and go here to eat some great food.

This is a first that I have seen and I would say is commendable as he went out of his way and take his time to make it up to my family. For that we are truly grateful. That is one thing that is nice to see is that he takes customers feedbacks and go out of his way to try to make things right. Not alot of places and business owner do that. Even with the bad experience with food they delivered in customer service from the beginning. Thank you for understanding.,0BWVf4hiNXdgRwBmxiZ0aw,0,0,4,ULLTm1T5HX7kNyBjfT_JZQ

Co workers took me to this place for lunch figuring it would be quick. 3 of us ordered at the same time and only one of us got our food within 5 minutes. Myself and the other guy got part of our food 20-30 minutes after and still wasn't complete. Our last item that we had ordered didn't come out till 45 min after which by then we had only 15 minutes left before heading back to work so we asked if we can just get it to go. To make things worse 2 guys walked in just before we left and they received their complete meals within a few minutes. I'm not one to get upset but this experience really made me not want to ever set foot there again. Staff at times showed great customer service and engaged with customers but at times also looked confused and seemed as if they didn't have a set plan to get food out to the customers within a reasonable time.  Aside from that the food does taste great. I have no complaints there. Maybe I'll give it a shot at a different time & day and hopefully I can have a  all around great experience. 

House dog, pepper fries and dirty corn all tasted amazing. Very flavorful!",_ZsLZWxQHCn8bX5tSIY6fQ,2,0,2,0pYeoQJPe7w9-_r8QzU_kQ

I mean c'mon it's just hot dogs. We ordered 2 hotdogs, 2 sides & 2 drinks. Total came to $27, that included tip, which I thought was kind of expensive! My hubby ordered the house dog & I ordered the teriyaki dog. When the hotdogs came I was disappointed b/c the buns were way bigger than the hotdog! I felt that my hotdog was a bit dried despite the fact it had teriyaki sauce on it. I would think they would top it off with lots of onions & bell peppers but it was short of it. I would normally would use a fork & knife at a hotdog gourmet place, but at this place I didn't have too. We also ordered chips & from the picture on the menu I thought it would be more like the chips you get from Buffalo Wild Wings, you know crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, it wasn't! 

I think the best thing we ate was the corn esquite. Also, for a hotdog establishment I expected more beverage options, which they didn't have, however no big deal.

Elote Fries: The fries were crispy and golden. They put a lot of cheese on the top and there was corn and bacon mixed in with the fries. The fries were decent, but I probably wouldn't order them again. 

The House dog and dirty chili dog: All the hot dogs come wrapped in bacon, which adds a lot of flavor.  Overall, the hot dogs were okay. Definitely not the best hot dog I have ever eat, but it wasn't bad. A bit overpriced for one hot dog though.",64rbmreKXl842yfyCvD4fw,2,0,4,4FDTNTsSdphqk77axiDPGg

Been wanting to try this place out for a while and finally got the chance this afternoon. The restaurant itself is a bit hidden if you're not familiar with the side of town. My sister and I drove all the way down from North Vegas to check this place off of our list. Smaller place, beers on draft, but they don't just have hot dogs. Their menu includes Tacos and ""Taco Fries"". I ordered their Brown Dog which had a sweet teriyaki sauce and a sesame aioli with onions, bell peppers and bacon bits. One added bonus is you get to choose the type of bread your jot dog goes on. If you're a fan of anything teriyaki this is your hot dog. Their dirty fries are dusted with chili límon and are addictive. My sister ordered the Patty Melt Dog and said I had to try it when we return. We were both pretty hungry, so there wasn't much sharing. 

Service was nice and very polite. Our food came out quick. I noticed a stack of board games by the bar. Great place to just hang out with some friends have a snack and some laughs.",HGj8FYzkxJ0Uw8vNjbyluA,0,1,4,4u66NjgVPgNaNjSVb_6yWA

1334493,2017-09-30,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"Stopped by this spot for lunch since I was in the Blue Diamond area. A small little restaurant in the edge of a business complex just east of rainbow, it's bigger on the inside than it looks. Once you step in, you walk right up to the register and the menus are to your immediate right and to the left of the door. They have a photo for every menu item that gives you a visual of what you're ordering (might I add that the food really does come out like the photo). They play 90's hip-hop and R&B on the radio, and you can still hear yourself over the music. Three TV's are tuned to various sports and the artwork is all centered around, obviously, Los Angeles and its culture.


Since it's my first time here, I asked the cashier for reccomendations. She helped me decide on the Elote dog and Filthy fries. 

I ordered the dog on Texas toast. The buttered bread holds the toppings on as well as it can (I see why they call it an extra dirty dog). The fries are made to order and came out extra crispy. The chipotle aioli sauce and semi-spicy guac gave it a great kick and still kept me from running to the fountain for a refill.

While these items were plenty to eat, I was curious about the street tacos and decided to try an Al Pastor and Vegan taco. A little underwhelming in size, but at such a low price point it's still worth it. I'm conflicted here. The vegan taco was good, tortillas were heated perfectly and the toppings were plentiful. Well executed. Now, on the other hand the al pastor taco was a bit disappointing. The meat was seasoned very well, but the tortilla was overcooked and too rough; I could not enjoy this taco as much as I'd hoped.

Despite a stale tortilla, overall experience was great, the employees were helpful and prompt in their service, plus managed to keep the place very clean. The food was well worth the price and the ambience was welcoming. I'll definitely be returning soon.",lR-6lc5Ejqutbcd21kahQA,0,1,5,uAcK1cZwLI8fZdZQyKkDng

I had such high hopes for DirtDog. I was introduced to this establishment by some friends on Facebook. I don't think I can put in to words the excitement I felt. My inner fat boy was doing summer salts. My in-person experience left very little to be desired.

To start, the parking lot is eerily dark and extremely small. The proprietors of this establishment should really consider buying the land adjacent to this location to expand the parking lot or, at the least, put some lights in the parking lot. It's nearly pitch black out there and even as one that has good eyes, it is hard to see.

Inside, I was impressed. The layout was nice and chill. I was surprised by the hip-hop influence in everything from the music selection to the art work on the walls. Someone is a huge 2Pac fan; I loved it. The tables are plentiful and the dining area is spacious. Folks weren't on top of each other, but it still felt intimate.

My partner and I ordered our food with unfettered excitement. I don't remember the name of what I had, but I recall getting the lobster bun. That part was absolutely delicious. It was buttered on both sides and so soft. The taste of the dog itself was okay. Admittedly, I will say it was probably a poor selection. It had nacho cheese and bacon bits on it, but the dog wasn't very big and I found myself still hungry. This would've been okay had I not spent so much for the experience.

I also ordered the loaded fries that guacamole on them and that was terrible. The guac was waaaaay to smooth and creamy, so much so that it seemed like a guacamole puree. That added a taste that completely ruined the rest of the fries and I ended up throwing them away.

I would go back to try something else. I am hopeful that I'd have a better experience next time, if I choose a different menu item and stick to the basic fries.",1k1N6_n_fjrMvLQ3OkaLJw,0,0,3,vRu_bkD_fVZkHbCYGVmXLQ

They have a friendly staff, and when ordering they are always patient no matter how long the line is. When we visited today, they were packed with a steady flow of people lined up out the door and the service was still top notch, they seemed to thrive in the high paced environment.

With the amount of business they get, they may need to invest in more space, as there were no tables available to eat so you had to keep an eye out to rush to a table once it opened.",p9c15C0TiryLJKobzwPt1A,1,1,5,UgvFwePzK_mEWpG7Za68WQ

The restaurant is spacious and clean, and there's a good amount of selection on the menu. I ordered the ""house"" dog aka ""the dirt dog"" which consisted of a beef dog wrapped in bacon (all their dogs are which is awesome!) topped with grilled onions and peppers cooked in thousand island sauce, letchu, mayo, mustard, and bacon bits! As far as the bun, you have a choice of 3, I chose the Portuguese which is a ""sweeter"" bun and the bun is laced with a green chile spread. Overall, it was a delicious dog! Probably one of the best I've had in a while. My friend ordered the ""red"" dog which was spicier -- and for those who aren't too used to spice, it definitely has a kick! My lips were burning a bit after tasting hers! Dirt dog is definitely a good spot to grab a quick and satisfying bite, so glad they brought one over from LA to Las Vegas. Also, shoutout to one of the chef's Cameron! Since business was a little slow when I went, he hooked it up with some free samples that weren't on the menu! From onion rings, to jalapeño poppers, and his own secret sauce!",5R8SuEzBjcitbPj4RYNi-g,0,0,5,74753QDDV4NljoGMAeYaXQ

1527565,2018-06-22,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,Hello there! So I came in about 2 days ago I believe it was Tuesday the 19th. I did a phone order at around 445pm. I was only 10 mins away. When I got there it was about 545 about an hour difference from my phone order! I ordered 4 hot dogs 2 fries and a dessert as well. When I got there 2 names stood out Nicole and Jayden. Jayden was the one who took my pick up order at the register. My food was supper cold and I was willing to take it and go. There was a bunch of traffic and and accident so my 10 mins turns into and hr. Nicole then came to me and said she apologizes for what happen and offered to have ALL OF MY FOOD REMADE do to the circumstances! I waited only about an additional literally about 5 mins and all my food was done and made fresh (HOT). Nicole sat at the register while redoing everything and talking with me ay the same time about your company and how she loves it. Nicole and Jayden both had impeccable service. I will defiantly be coming back. She also very knowledgeable on her beers as I work at BJ's and am the bartender to have someone like her be as knowelgebale is a plus in my book. Keep up the good work girls and DIRT DOG. your food was well with the extra 5 mins wait.,wvgK1N_vhswWo4tIrTTDPg,0,0,5,SLn36vYsKMccF0nqdI1ZJg

Stood in line for 45 minutes watch the whole restaurant clear out the front door was held open the whole time so the inside of the restaurant became hotter to the point where I couldn't even sit and stay and enjoy my food and beer. I watched 4 other employees pace back and forth while a 2nd computer was available the whole time to clear the line that was out the front door and around the building. I watched as probably $1000.00 of business walked away after having to wait so long (based off my tab for 2 hot dogs, 2 fries, and a cold beer). Like I said the house dog and filthy fries I had and the dirty chili dog and fries my other half had were Really good, I have been looking forward to coming to this place since moving out here, but after watching this shit show take place, my beer getting hot , and not being able to finish or enjoy my food because the front door being open for over an hour and the restaurant heating up (mind you it's a cool 105 today) I'm very unhappy and dissatisfied.

The Veggie Dog ( green style w/ Portuguese bun)
For lack of a better word.... it.. sucked.
The chimichuri was not chimichuri it was something that made the bun a light green color and kept it super dry.
I didn't mind the veggie dog itself, nice grill marks, but zero flavor. Just a soy tube. A little fat, salt/pepper can go a long way. 

* They offer 3 types of buns (which are all egg washed so NO VEGAN option) a regular white, a Portuguese (which was described as sweet but really should just be described as SUCKS)

I did want to add that the cook noticed that I wasn't really into my meal and offered to make me something new but by that time I was already full.

My pick is the classic house dog, on a lobster bun. My guy preferred the Green Dog with chimmichurri sauce and the Portuguese bun. The street corn was delicious, but we'll have to come back for the garlic fries. Deep-fried Oreos are served with a side of cinnamon frosting for dipping for a sweet ending to your meal.

Great music, fun vibe, my sons and I loved the games while we were waiting for our food! The food itself tasted great! All three of us loved it! Soooo.... this was our first time visiting. We took a minute to go over the menu, this seemed to immediately set a tone of annoyance with the girl at the counter. We did step aside so others (there weren't any) could order. When we finally decided my sons ordered first. With the first selection she asked what type of bun, my son asked what his options were, annoyed she recited them. Second son orders and again asks bun choices as he hadn't heard her. She is even more annoyed. I place my order and hand my card over to pay. She swipes it and literally flings it on the counter. Okay.... so, the same girl brings out our order of fries wayyyyyyy before the food arrives and simply drops them on the table. As for the dogs we ordered two house dogs and one ranchero. Again, they tasted great. Only the two house dogs were so different from one another they didn't even look like the same dog. One was clearly loaded up and the other had been skimped on.

Menu- Simple, easy to read menu w/ pictures as reference. Wish they had more variety of hot dogs though. 

Service- Friendly. It's not really a restaurant style service. You just order when u walk in and sit down with your number & they bring you your food. 

Ordered the House dog on Lobster roll & Red dog on Portuguese roll and asked for the chili flakes on the side because it looks overwhelming in the photos. The house dog had a little bit too much sauce for my liking but overall it was a good hot dog. The bread made it even better because it was a little buttery! 

Sides- ordered the garlic fries that came with a garlic aioli. Wish there were more garlic on the fries though. The aioli was good. Very garlic-y

I ordered a vegan taco and their elote fries without the bacon bits for roughly $8 all together. 

It was delicious!! I thought $2 was expensive for 1 taco, especially once they finally served it to me because it was TINY. But it was all worth it at first bite. So flavorful, recommend trying it out. 

Their elote fries were really good too. Comes with a lot for $5.50 and I couldn't even finish it all. Put some in a box and finished it once I got home.

Apparently Dirt Dog hails from LA--but I only heard about it after moving out of LA. LOL! It's located in the very corner of a random plaza, so use your GPS like everyone else has said.

Shoutout to the waitress who was doing everything tonight: taking orders, bringing plates out, bussing tables. She was super friendly and gave us a quick run through of the menu. According to her, the house dog and green dog were their most popular dishes. So we got those and the dirty esquite, which is basically elote in a cup. The house dog was so flavorful--the sauce was so bomb. The green dog was also great and a little more tart, but house dog was my favorite. I do wish their dogs would have a crispy bite to them like the ones at Top Dog in Berkeley, CA. The esquite was actually just ok; the cheese was pretty monotonous, so I added some tapatio to change things up.

I took off a star because it's way too pricey for a fancy hot dog. This place is cool and I can see myself coming back when I have a hankering for fancy hot dogs (who knew that could even be a thing lol)",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,7,4,4,ys9h7NncU9ScTAhhvYsDUQ

1761843,2017-09-30,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"A pretty decent place! Been there twice. First time by myself, second time brought a friend. The food definitely tastes good, but the portions are small, if you get just one hot dog, you'll leave hungry. A couple things I have to mention about this place that made it into 4 star instead of 5. 
First of all, there is no menu at the table, the setup is more like McDonald's. But the problem is that people are very indecisive. It makes the wait extremely long, for example, last night, I had to wait about 15 minutes for just 2 people in front of me to order.. They were standing there, looking at the menu and couldn't decide what they wanted. This could be easily solved if there were either more cashiers (instead of just one), or even better, let people sit at a table and give them a menu so they can sit there as long as they want until they decide. This way others won't have to wait so long. Second thing is the restroom. The place can get pretty busy, the place serves beer and plays music. This means that people might want to stick around a little longer, but the restroom is only for one person at a time. This can get very uncomfortable. You have to wait even if you just want to go wash your hands. Otherwise it's a very nice place, cozy set up. Food doesn't take too long to prepare.

The portion is huge. I'd highly recommend everyone to check this place out if you're in Vegas. My boyfriend and I truly enjoyed this place! 

However, the only thing that's keeping me from giving this place a 5 star, is that we found hair in our chili fries. I'm not the type of person to make a big deal about hair in my food. I would usually just pick it out and not eat the part of my food that the hair touched. But this time it wasn't just one strand of hair. It was two or three long strands. It was mixed in with the chili.. I just couldn't. To be honest, I lost my appetite. I didn't even bother trying to pull it out because I was just kind of disgusted actually.. we brought it back to the workers and they gave us a full refund of the meal. Which was really nice of them to do and I really appreciated that. While we were standing there waiting for the worker to do what they needed to, my boyfriend overheard a manager (I'd assume she was a manager) talking to the cashier lady that she needed to talk to her about ""this.""

The ambiance looked great. It looked like that in between my visits that they had updated alot of stuff. Tables and the bar area were awesome. Very clean and very open. Loved the layout but it was a tad cold as in not temperature cold but not very inviting...4/5

Service was still off... Maybe I keep on getting them on off times. I entered and looked at the menu boards...I was greeted right away by a lady in the kitchen but the guy that was taking the order was busy doing something... I'm not sure what but there were only 2 tables and they already had their food. I waited a bit and he came and took my order. (3/5) the only reason why I have him a 3 is because he remembered that I asked for extra lime wedges and brought them out.

Food was sadly where they missed it this time. They are known for their hot dog wrapped bacon. Well this time the bacon was chewy and not crisp and no char at all. The lobster roll was toasted almost too dark but sadly the bacon was white since it was mainly fat and limp and just soggy and stringy. The hot dog had no char which added so much for to my dog last time. I got the mutt and the toppings were actually better then last time but the main part... The hot dog wrapped bacon was soooooo sad. :( And I waited almost 15 minutes for this dog. I understand that they are trying for quality over quantity...I get that and respect that... But when I wait 15 minutes and the dog and the bacon is soggy and limp.... The respect goes out the door and I have to wonder what the heck were they doing back there????? (1/5)

The dirty Esquite was the best thing I had today.  It was pretty good but even with all the kernels that get stuck in between my teeth...I stick with the dirty corn... It was good but it had too much crema for my taste it was on the verge of being too creamy. The corn still had great texture which was very glad for. (4/5)

Will I be back.... Maybe... They are very close to me but the hot dog was such a disappointment today. If I do come back it might just be for the corn... Not sure if I want to try the bacon wrapped dogs again with it being so inconsistent. :(",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,4,3,3,51mFSIOkqeCNebso2kfGDw

The bun was great and the hotdog was great . For 5.95??? Not that good. Now- if it came with fries and drink for say... $9.99 then fine. Still pricey but totally doable. Also didn't see any options for a plain dog w/just mustard or catsup..They should have that.

I don't drink beer. But if I did, $8 for a beer is higher then at Dodger stadium. Would love to see there sales for beer. I would bet a lot of money is not so good. With this location and in this town... Very few are going to pay. $8 for a beer. 

Also love it's open until 11pm... But have a ""happy hour"" say 9pm to 11:00pm... Half off... You would kill it ....

The fried Oreo cookie . Is good. I mean Oreo cookies are one of the best things ever created... So it is almost impossible to mess up an Oreo...But only giving 2... Not so good. Dipping sauce is great. But I LOVE OREO and would never get this desert again.

Who doesn't like a churro? Would have been A LOT BETTER if it was twice the size and 1/10 the cinnamon sugar.

Overall the space is way to big and just doesn't fit the hot dog vibe. Also I love Tupac ... But completely out of place and threw the vibe off.

I hope he has free rent as the burger place that was there before had to move as it's the single worst location on Rainbow.

Another terrible thing......When u pay with debit or credit they turn the pad towards you (cool)  and first you must decide what % of tip to leave...5,10,15 or 20%. (NOT COOL)
This is BEFORE YOU EVER GET FOOD OR SERVICE!! 

Also they would like you just to leave your mess at the table and there are no garbage cans. Ok that's fine... But how about a sign telling me that?

So a few minutes go by and no eltoe fries or elote. It's been about 10  minutes since our dogs came out then my elote fries come, then we wait about 5 more minutes and the corn comes out. Not to crazy about the corn , tasted like it was chargrilleed so we had a few bites and that was it. Elote fries were a tad to salty but overall good.  Our friends daughter got the kids menu chicken nuggets. Shes only 4 so she takes a bite and she got corn dogs instead which she doesn't like but we weren't about to wait another 15 minutes for it. Few minutes later the employee comes back and says oops I gave you corn dogs by accident instead.  Will I be back ?maybe if I was in the area.  Overall dirty dogs were good but If you want them cold and one item brought out at a time . By all means go ahead.",28PH_pr-dJBBSgSMXwQ47A,0,0,3,PluF1wC8FoJlqIXshLRxoQ

Dirt dog has been a local favorite in LA for years and has been coined ""The Official Hotdog of Los Angeles."" Well guess what? It has finally come to Las Vegas! If you don't know what a Dirt dog is, here is a quick explanation. It is a 100% premium all beef weiner that is wrapped in a center cut slice of bacon, then served on your choice of bun and topped off with either the menu selection of toppings, or they allow you to create your own by mixing and matching for your own unique experience. This is Hands down the best Street dog I have ever tasted. The hotdog is never greasy and always tastey and served on a toasted, warm bun. Then they give you the perfect amount of topping to dog ratio and serve it to you al la carte or with a side of fries and drink if you choose. They are also open late for those of you who have a late night craving and they have a location on The Strip inside of Ballys. Seriously, this hotdog will curb any craving and your only regret is that you didn't buy 2",WY2DGvQ0l6-vKtDuA4mztw,0,0,5,6lkJr48uR7iANZVytWz8Xw

My dog was a bit spicy, but the flavor packed a punch. And elote is always a weakness of mine so eating it here was a treat. The ranch that accompanies the fries is garlicky as well and we couldn't get enough of it. Topped the meal off with the horchata ice cream and we went home with more than happy stomachs.

1978100,2016-07-01,1,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"Lucky us! We decided to give Dirt Dogs a try last night and they were hosting a free tasting (whoop whoop!). Great way to try a few of their menu items so I know what to order on my next visit. Had the House, Brown, Green, Mutt (secret menu item) Dogs and the Dirty Corn. They also offered a Red Dog, but I was too full, lol. 

The House Dog was my favorite. All the dogs are great tasting, quality ingredients, but the House Dog had all the right flavors and textures for my palette. The Green was also a hit for me. The Brown Dog had an Asian influence and the Mutt was just that...a ""mutt"" mixture of other dogs combined. Beware, it was really spicy! We skipped the Red Dog, but that too looked very spicy. The Dirty Corn was the highlight of the evening! Basically Mexican street corn, soooo good!

We also ordered Garlic Fries and Dirty Chips. Both were okay, the chips were slightly burnt for my taste and the fries didn't have a ton of flavor on its own. But the aioli dipping sauce that come with the Garlic Fries are a perfect complement and really elevated the flavor. My hubby tried the Deep Fried Twinkie which I wouldn't recommend - it was soaked in grease, perhaps cooked for too long, or at the wrong temperature.

The owner and chef spoke briefly during the tasting. The concept is street food style served in a sit down setting. They mentioned everything, down to the bacon bits, is house made.

All in all, hot dogs are excellent, highly recommend the Dirty Corn, but the other sides/dessert are just okay. Would definitely go back though!",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,4,4,4,fhcHjDLY4WOwAsGqJWHVUw

It's the different aioli sauces that make these items legit. And if none of that is your food of choice, then their street tacos are amazing. The red salsa is a must with their guacamole. Definitely a place where ppl go to indulge, so bring your fat girl/boy appetite and be ready to grub. The environment and decor pays homage to iconic LA scenes and people, along with the music which is mostly west coast rap music - I dig it!

First, i waited too long for a ONE hotdog take-out on a not so busy time. I was told i would be called if my order is ready but i had to follow it up. I could see it was ready because i was sitting on the table next to the cashier. Second, the waiter service needs improvement on attentiveness. My order was sitting on the counter while the waiter/waitress was chatting. And although the waiter was apologetic for the long wait which i appreciated, they would really look good in the customers' eyes if they would pay more attention to the wait time.",jPRmiThUODYcju6jtusAcw,1,0,2,HcJFwmLYMs-P-tWFqwmIPw

They have a wide selection of over the top dogs; don't skip the lobster roll bun- it's delicious and helps to keeps all the toppings contained. The Elote Dog is my personal favorite, I have ordered it both times I have been there following a hosted event. 

They have the usual suspects for sides, some also taken to the next level with toppings. But for a hot dog joint, the most notable thing on the menu is their vegan taco.. yes, you read that right- VEGAN TACO! They offer a few varieties of street tacos but the soyrizo is the best in my opinion, even for meat eaters. 

They also offer a decent selection of beers, fried Oreo desserts, and a true to their LA roots atmosphere, complete with Tupac music and murals. They also have a fun map mural that serves as an interactive guestbook, allowing guests to pin where they live in the greater Las Vegas area.",PVB0ggrspa1wWUECI7BN6w,4,3,4,_v103ca76FxMqnkMB32Nug

It ended up making the two vegan tacos I ordered taste like they had actual chili in them. The corn in the cup was flavorless as well, and also tasted like chili. My fiancé even said it when he tried it. He got the chili dog and said it wasn't good at all: there was no flavor at all. Everything was good quality and homemade BUT NO FLAVOR OR SPICE. 

Although the atmosphere was nice (they played modern music and had board games to play), you go to a restaurant to eat and the food is not worth it and outweighs anything good about Dirt Dog.

It's pretty amusing to see an LA-themed restaurant here in Las Vegas. But I did love the 90s Rap/Hip Hop that's constantly playing. On a side note, there seems to be a Tupac Amaru Shakur tribute vibe here as well (as there should be!) I loved the ambience. They also have those angel wings painted on a wall of which girls love to pose in front of and post on instagram for the 999999th time. But hey, it's free hashtag advertising for this place, right? And they have some board games that you can play at your table while you are visiting. 
You have a wide variety of choices and options here. You can get any dog with a choice of your normal bun, Texas toast, lobster bun, or Portuguese bun. I've never tried the Portuguese bun, so I got the Ranchero Dog with the Portuguese today. They also have a lot of other street food type items here as well such as nachos and tacos. And their desserts look fabulous. I didn't try any desserts this time because I could feel my love handles growing just by reading the dessert menu. The dogs themselves are not huge. They are normal length so they won't stuff you. In fact, if you have one of those big ""American"" appetites, one dog may not satisfy you.  I also had their garlic fries. Very good but a tad oily especially the fries on the bottom of the box. 
My only gripe about this visit was that my fries took a while to come out. My dog came out and I finished eating it long before the fries came out. No biggie. I was in no rush. The staff was very cool and friendly so it was fine. 
I'm looking forward to coming here again and trying more items. I only had this place a handful of times back in Los Angeles, so I'll try everything else here.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,8,6,4,Q-OwuKU54YrQCTxl3e_bJA

2140484,2018-03-26,2,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"My friend summed this up for me.. ""Dirt Dog was a basket of disappointment.""

We'd eagerly planned our trip to Dirt Dog for weeks, looked at Instagram and Facebook videos, and had our mouths and taste buds all ready for some decadent deliciousness. But alas, it was not to be. 

The line was long, but moved swiftly. You place your order at the counter and your food is delivered to your table. Service was pleasant and our food took about 10 min to arrive. Two of the dirty dogs and an order of filthy fries cost about $22. 

Now, the food.. that's the disappointing part. My friend got the patty melt dog, I got the elote dog,and my boyfriend got the chili dog. We split an order of the filthy fries. The fries were definitely the best part of the meal. Covered with melted cheese, bacon bits, and guacamole, they were a treat. They weren't as hot as I'd like, but that was in part because of the cool guacamole on top.

The dogs though.. they were more like sad puppies. They weren't fully wrapped in bacon, and the lobster butter rolls definitely weren't buttery as promised. My dog had the most ""stuff"" on it, but it didn't really make sense- it just was a lot of corn that didn't really taste like anything , the cheese was overpowering in flavor, and the hot dog was WAY too salty. It just felt like a waste of calories and elevated blood pressure .

My friend was similarly disappointed by her patty melt dog. Not enough cheese and the bun was also not buttery and was dry. My boyfriend gave the chili dog another blah review. 

Just felt meh all around and I won't be going out of my way to walk these dogs anytime soon.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,6,2,3,5fwdguhgoKwrGg7SIcq19g

The fries were unappealing & tasted below average. Comparable to bad fast food fries. The veggie dogs came out impeccably horrible. Immediately the appearance was much different from my previous outing. The dogs themselves looked yellow. The toppings were poorly cut and the pieces were comically big. The dog was Las Vegas comparable dry. Very little sauce & the toppings were almost completely different than the Dirt Dog in LA we had a week prior. No salsa, very very little cilantro, bun was terrible, & the Veggie dog lacked any flavor and tasted like it was sitting in water for days. Wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone.

The moment we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by Cassie. She provided kind and bubbly service as talked about Pokemon Go and the menu, of course. She was able to help us with all of our questions. 

My boyfriend got the House Dog and a side of garlic fries. 
House Dog w/ Lobster-style bread: Seemed like a normal hot dog, nothing too fancy. 
Garlic Fries: He would get it again. I personally expected more, could skip. 

My sister and I shared the Green Dog w/ Lobster-style bread and the Dirty Esquite (I call it the dirty corn in a cup).
Green Dog: Very refreshing and light. The bread was toasty AND buttery..
the perfect combination. 
Dirty Esquite: A street corn lover's dream. My sister has braces, so this was very convenient for her. The bacon added a nice crunch but would love more added into it!

Last but not least, you can't skip on dessert. ""Food is for the stomach; dessert is for the soul."" 
Horchata Ice Cream: For the price, there is a generous amount of pleasure in every bite. The horchata ice cream had a smooth, cinnamon flavor, along with Rice Krispie bits and some nuts (is available without nuts as well). The crunch definitely added to its consistency. With the churro on top, this dessert will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth. 

Although there are some things that we would skip out on, we are looking forward to trying the rest of the menu and returning soon.",96xXuvVkvyt8IoQES21-GQ,1,1,4,0YmI9Z1iLKzaZC1g0oQLkg

I'm normally a plain dog eater, maayyybe a dot of mustard or kraut. So I was expecting a kick to the face of intense flavors. I was pleasantly surprised (shocked, even) that the dogs are balanced and not overpowering. They're delicious!! The Elote Dog is EVERYTHING. Also the best jamaica drink I've tried. And do yourself a favor and get some deep fried oreos with horchata whipped cream. 

While I love the 2pac and old school tunes they play, I do wish they were the edited versions since I bring my kids here.

Tip: Allow yourself ample time when coming here. They prepare each item fresh and it's a smaller mom-n-pop-type shop, so they have a smaller staff. Don't expect to be in and out like you would getting a dog at sam's club.",7AKWPQLa4QxKOVE_FBRtUA,0,0,5,CoI93DQMtonxyu287N2rkg

It was packed with flavor, I pretty much ate the whole thing in under 5 minutes. I wanted to savor the flavors, but man it's a hot dog with a flavor punch. I also decided to go with their salt and pepper fries, elote (Mexican corn on a cob), and deep fried Twinkie! Hello!

2248944,2016-07-13,4,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"Shout out too my partner and yelper Suzy H for telling me about Dirt Dog. We decided to go on there soft opening date. I know not the most ideal time check out brand new restaurant. They had some kinks that needed work out. None of the taps were running, fountain machine was down, and most of the bottle drinks never had time chill. It was expected so NONE of it bothered me. Really the star of the show was the Dirt Dogs. 

So one thing always count on dining with Suzy H we make sure try the menu. We got three different dogs. The Green, Red, and the Mutt dog combination of the two (also secret menu item). The Red Dog stole the show out of the three. At first thinking not that spicy after the first couple bites. Talk about subtle just kick you right in the mouth. By the end was hurting needed take breather before started on the second Green Dog. I like spicy food. It not crazy over the top heat but just be warned some kick too it. Green Dog fan of the chimichurri sauce. Overall nothing that stood out or worked for me compare to the Red Dog. Or maybe the Red Dog killed my taste buds. lol!!! The Mutt Dog if looking try both really great option. 

The base of all the hot dogs are bacon wrapped Nathans brand hot dogs. I have seen before but not whole menu based alone on the concept. I love the concept!! The bacon nice crispy on the outside. It gives the hot dog more body and keep Nathans hot dog more moist/hot. The topping on both dogs really complimented the whole dog. The Green Dog not make as much of lasting impact compare to the Red. The buns that another Dirt Dog concept or one of the options lobster style roll. I think lobster roll should be given with any Dirt Dog. It not only reminded me of quality lobster roll sandwich. It adds so much more flavor then regular hot dog bun. Talk about reasonable priced. Not only reasonable compare to basic hot dog on any strip casino or casino. The quality your getting speaks for itself. The simplicity of the menu fan of three different parts Dogs, Sides, and Desserts. Less think about and for me everything had was awesome or solid. The sides we got the Garlic Fries and Mexican Corn. Both solid. 

The desserts that FIVE star da bomb. I came back on second visit ONLY for desserts. Nothing could damper the fact had my first Deep Fried Twinkie. Deep Fried Oreo enough said. They ran out of Horachata Ice Cream. I like the fact they make it fresh every day and went at the end of service . They ran out. Just gives me another reason come back!!! Second visit came with my cousins visiting and doing out tradition food tours around Vegas. Dirt Dog was perfect dessert spot on my radar and talking about Deep Fried goodness. It was heavenly. The Twinkie the cream that came running out on was awesome. They have sauce for both but truth neither one needs it. 

The service every person came in contact with was friendly, awesome, and the manager very much around checking on guests. Five star service both times I visited. 

One thing find the place is if looking for it at night. The sign no lighting around it. If anything look for Sparklings well lit sign and its in the same parking lot.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,4,4,qTL8JLmvVWfHcRnGfxxPwg

My husband and son got plain bacon wrapped dogs on a butter bun and seasalt fries. No complaints there.
I had the brown dog and filthy fries. I just about died with every bite of the brown dog. The flavor profile was spot on; saltiness of the dog and the sweet and savory of the teriyaki and sesame on the Portuguese bun. I got the chipotle aoli on the side which was a good thing since the salt and pepper already added a nice kick to the fries. Ended up maxing out but happily full.

Next was the churros. This was the only reason we took off a star. They were kind of puny in size (that's what she said) and unfortunately while they looked tasty, they ended up being raw inside.

All in all a great meal. We will probably pass on dessert next time. The takeaway message here is that there will likely be a next time.",G7Ca2lgiFKKpv1v8glT4KQ,0,0,4,VP2S-OiKB33Am_101qeOzw

Got the chimichurri (green) dog and the house dog. Got the option of regular bun, Portuguese bun, and lobster bun (up charge). Tried the Portuguese and lobster bun. Find absolutely nothing special about the lobster bun. Portuguese bun was good. These dogs were okay, but nothing too special or interesting. 

I am a lover of all things potato. And these potatoes were very disappointing. Tried the garlic fries and dirty chips. The garlic fries were like regular fries with some dried roasted garlic sprinkled on top. The chips were seasoned. Both were dry and lacked flavor...

The cup of corn... It was fresh grilled corn which was nice. Still lacked flavor.

Overall, seemed like a great idea but nothing quite delivered. Price seemed pricy for street style food.. I much prefer Buldogis for hot dogs with flare.

I had The Green Dog, with chimichurri sauce and avocado spread, on a Portuguese bun, which is a slightly sweet bread. It was delicious. My husband had The Original, which is wrapped in bacon and topped with 1000 Island, ketchup and mustard, also on the sweet Portuguese bun. It was also delicious, though I liked mine better.
We got a side of the chili and limon fries, that came with a spicy ketchup. They were good, and I think the ketchup definitely made them better. We also got the side of corn with cheese, though I can't remember what it was called. I didn't care for it, my husband liked it, and I think it would have been better mixed instead of layered. I might try it again.
They couldn't serve beer last night because their machine wasn't cooling it. We both had the bottled, Mexican, Coke. The Coke was good of course, but we were disappointed that there wasn't any beer available. Luckily the food was good enough on its own.
Other than the beer not being available there was one more negative and it had to do with cleanliness. It's a pet peeve of mine, but tables and seats had crumbs on them as we walked pass. Also, some of the staff was sitting and chatting, when someone should have taken the time to make a pass to clean up more. 
The staff was all very friendly, even the ones sitting around for a bit. They played 90s music that was little loud, had sports plating on TVs, and had a big picture of Tupac on top of the soda fridge. Their only other location is in LA.
I really enjoyed the food, and will for sure be back for another $6 hotdog. And who knows. Maybe the tables and seats no one is sitting at will all be clean as a bonus.",1GbtKqRpDAfv13fUYIBBmA,0,0,4,WtVvL_yYJYY2G_3xgdyM1Q

I had the dirty chili dog, with garlic fries. They were both delicious. The only thing I could have asked for is, possibly, a spicier dog or chili. A little heat would have put that hot dog over the top. To cap off our lunch, we ordered the deep-fried Twinkie, Oreos and Churro. I had never had any of those. They, too, were delicious. When you think about a hot dog and fries, the prices are a little higher than what you would probably expect to pay.

I'm happy to say we stayed and I'm sooooooo glad we did! Variety of dogs and fries, even tacos, and corn! He had the dirty chili dog, I had the House dog and we each shared garlic and elote fries. Hands down best French fries I have ever had! Usually when you order garlic fries, midway through eating them, they turn soggy but not these ones! Seriously the best French fries I've ever eaten!  I was a tad confused by my house dog thinking it would have thousand island dressing, green chili sauce and the standard toppings.

I liked the 4 hotdogs that we had (house dog, red dog, green dog and patty melt dog) but that was it. I was expecting a huge party in my mouth with tons of flavors but I missed the party. 

Tupac was playing when I walked in and I felt like I was home, then I saw the board games and thought my 3 year old would have fun here. I got home with my to go order, ate and now I feel jipped. 

The house dog had a ton of mayo on it which ruined it for me personally but it should be Great for you mayo lovers. The only thing I tasted on the patty melt was the fries. The red dog had the most flavor but was a little weird for me. The green dog was my fave but I needed more toppings, I was left with a handful of bread at the end. Speaking of bread; I tried all three options and everything was good but I'm not sure what the ""lobster"" in lobster bread was all about. Tasted like Texas toast to me. The only thing that knocked our socks off was the cashier who took my phone order and gave me my order, she was nice, and dessert. We really enjoyed the fried Twinkie, churros and Horchata ice cream. 

I feel like I cant be the only person to not love this place so I'm going to go back and try some other items on the menu even though the bf doesn't want to go back. I was disappointed to find there are several more items on the menu in the restaurant than there were on the dirt dog website menu.

Almost everything had chipotle mayo on it and nobody can enjoy that much chipotle mayo and be sane.

I haven't been eating meat much and today was the day to indulge a little bit. 

As we entered we were greeted by a girl at the counter, she was friendly and told us to order when we were ready. We stood there for a moment (since it was our first time) and checked out the menu. No one in line but us. My BF mentioned that it was our first time and asked suggestions and that's when the girl at the counter went over how it all works, gave us customer favorites, her favorites and was able to answer all our questions. 

After drooling over their menu on the wall for several minutes, we finally made our decisions. I got the #DirtyChiliDog topped with their house made chili and melted bacon cheddar. My BF got the #PattyMelt topped with the melted cheddar fries and Chipotle Aioli Spread. Oh, and let's not forget the #DirtyChiliFries which is also topped with their house made chili.

We didn't wait long until our food came out. Everything looked so yummy as the food came to our table. Definitely an Instagram worthy type of lookin' food!?!@?

Overall, customer service was great! The restaurant was clean, love the decor and the music. Now, the food...It wasn't bad, nothing too special, I guess with all the hype, I was expecting more. My BF and I felt that the food was a little too salty for us which I think is the main reason why we didn't LOVE IT like we had thought we would.

Also, get the Mexican corn in a cup as well as the ice cream both were delicious, you won't be disappointed.

The tab selection has one of my favorites -- Xocoveza. (It's chocolate, coffee, vanilla, milk sugar, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon to me. My favorite winter beer!)

The menus were lit, clearly placed, and had high definition photos of each food selection. The cashier was explaining the food to the couple in front of us and was very friendly. 

Food: They have a menu created from the famous LA Street Dog (Los Angeles). Being an LA native, I can attest that those Bacon wrapped hot dogs with grilled onions, mayo, ketchup, mustard is to die for!!! But the Po-Po be chasing them off and the city of Los Angeles bans them!! That's because they were sold by illegal immigrants. This establishment has hot dogs (including a Veggie Dog), but they also have different kinds of fries, as well as Tacos. They even have Jamaica (Hibiscus punch) and Horchata, Coke fountain drinks, AND a BAR! We got a Green Dog, Al Pastor Fries, and an Elote (corn on the cob). AY CHIHUAHA!  DIOS MIO!! My hot dog was in a toasted, warm, buttery lobster roll (you choose the type of roll you want from 3 selections). Flavors were ON POINT. The Al Pastor Fries were my absolute FAVORITE (so far, this was my first visit after all). There were big chunks of pineapple, thick chunks of pork (literally tasted like Chorizo to me), sour cream, cilantro, lime, oh yeah and french fries. And it was enough for 2 people to share! The Elote was delicious! 

Ambiance: It was Urban. Graffiti artwork on the walls, gangsta rap/ West Coast rap/90s hip hop. The cashier was tatted up. The crowd was Urban (mostly minorities) but to my surprise older White people were there too. The restaurant was pretty full and a long line was formed after we sat. 2 big flat screen TVs. Even games to play at your table (cards, Jenga, etc) while you wait. Even the floors had artwork on them. There was a section of a wall full of hot sauces!!! They had my fave brand, Marie Sharps. 

Overall I had a great experience. The only negative was an obnoxious customer snapping pictures of everything. He even asked me to move so he could take a photo of the artwork at the register. OBNOXIOUS. 

I highly recommend this joint, it really embodies LA, the Latin flavors and spirit. It's a very chill place! The cooks were also professionally dressed too, so it is very evident that they take pride in this business and that the Chefs are allowed to create magic.",CBWiAM9pP6w4Jg-PoeV2rg,0,1,5,uqasUMhkuXIeMxe8bU_8DQ

Although, Their elote in a cup is okay. Every time I've ordered it, it had way too much mayonnaise where I couldn't even finish it. This place is good don't get me wrong, but nothing mind blowing.

Atmosphere-clean, modern, fun, and an INCREDIBLE 90s hip hop and rap playlist that killed it! There are cards and board games you can play while you wait but considering how fast they move even when it was busy you won't have much time to kill. 
Service-so friendly, so fast, table was vacated, cleared and wiped down within minutes while we waited to sit. And the place was full!  Each thing we finished was whisked away promptly and politely. I don't see service this terrific even at fancy restaurants. Super impressive. 
Food - this is why the place was PACKED even at 3 pm on a Sunday. So so so great. I will crave this food. The filthy fries are delicious and, for those of us who don't eat beef hot dogs, they have a SOY-BASED HOT DOG you can swap out for the beef dog on any of their dishes. Amazing!

We ordered the House Dog, the Mutt Dog, The Chili Dog, filthy fries and the elote corn cup. My favorite was the house Dog with red and green peppers, onions and bacon thousand island. It was superb! We ordered the mutt dog because we couldn't decide between the red or green dog. Next time I will pick one or the other because the clash of flavors was a little much for the palate. Just enough spice. The chili dog was good but not what I was expecting. This place over does it a bit on the cilantro and bacon, but that's just my opinion. I would order it again just cheese onions and chili. The fries were delicious. Crispy fried and they didn't get soggy with all the condiments on top. I was surprised how spicy they were. The corn cup was good but again, I would do without the cilantro and bacon. No room for desert but I would love to try the horchata ice cream mmm.

The convenience of getting a street dog out there after events, concerts, games, and even just shopping is just one of them lol. As many times as I tried to re-create the LA dirty dog, alley dog, Tijuana dog, whatever you want to call it, it just doesn't hit the palate the same way. 

Having Dirt Dog just 10 min away has been a great way to suffice my cravings. Honestly, all the hotdog variations we've tried have been really good. I usually go for the one that closely resembles the OG LA dog. We tried their horchata ice cream when they first opened, and omg that was pretty darn amazing. My kids love, love their deep fried Oreos.

One star docked off because of a few things. First of all, the garlic fries sounds so good, but when they come out, they are not that great. I am an eloté fanatic! I'm an original customer of the ones that used to come around my neighborhood in Cali that are sold in carts. The eloté here I feel like is missing some of its authenticity. It's just a little too Americanized. Can't explain but my feelings are real lol. Lastly, for hotdogs, it's pretty pricey. Even for a plain bacon wrapped hotdogs for the kids, it's the same price.

In conclusion, we will continue to come back. We just know what to get and what not to get now. Service has always been great. We love the music played there. Totally our era!!",LgFDWZTLi1w9OGi5BtKORg,0,0,4,tuJW0wgVCEAcG04veHzh8w

Veggie dog was served to me barely cooked. Sent it back for new one.

Akia at the register was wonderful!  She explained everything on the menu in detail and even gave a few recommendations.  It's only her third day working here, and I truly believe she could teach courses on customer service.

The kids loved their hotdogs and fries.  My son even ate all of his and most of mine!  (Again, I'm not a hotdog person.)  The only downsides were that there's mayo on the hotdogs, which wasn't listed on the menu.  There were also two menus next to the door that we didn't see: one for street tacos and taco fries.  Had we seen them, we might have ordered those instead.  We were so focused on the main menu on the wall, though, that we didn't see the other two menus behind us.

The food came out incredibly fast!  We were barely seated when the food came out hot & fresh.  After eating, we decided to order some of the goodies we initially missed.  We got a street taco (DELICIOUS) and the fried Oreos and a churro.  All were absolutely outstanding, piping hot and fresh!

We grownups will definitely come back for the street tacos and desserts, and the kids obviously loved their hotdogs.  The only tip I have is that if there are any foods that are off limits for you (like mayo) ask before ordering.  Not all ingredients are posted in the food descriptions.

The house dog was probably one of the best hot dogs I have been blessed to try. Nice and meaty hot dog on a delicious toaster bun with bacon, green chili, thousand island dressing, and grilled onions. Some of my favorite hot dogs were just ketchup, mustard, and crushed potato chips, so this is a good departure from that.

The garlic fries were good. I was expecting more garlic, as it was more like regular fries for me. I would probably try another topping next time.

My husband got the chili dog and loved it. We also ordered the garlic fries which were good. 

The seating is a little odd with about half barstool and half with normal tables. 


From my husband:
I can honestly say they have one of the best chili dogs I have had since moving back to the west. 
I hope it does well there is also one on the strip in front of Ballys!!

I do want to note, in the interest of full disclosure, that Timothy (owner) did invite me back but the food was so good this time around that I offered to pay (twice!). It says a lot about a business when the owner is willing to stand by his product. So thanks for hosting me Timothy and let's get into it!

1) House Dog- I tried this on my last visit and wasn't sold on the lobster roll bun. This time I opted for the Portuguese bread and what a difference! It was toasted perfectly and it stood up to the sauces... home run! 

2) Al Pastor Fries- I'm pleased to report that the seasoning on the fries has been adjusted and is no longer overly salty! I did prefer the Al Pastor over the Asada fries from my last visit. One suggestion: if they were to leave the meat on the grill just a little longer so it gets that nice char this would be perfection! 

3) Dirty Esquite- this was reason I wanted to come back! I had never tried it with a bit of lime or bacon. It was different but quite tasty! The change elevates street food nicely. 

4) Horchata Ice Cream & Churro- this is the stuff dreams are made of! I'm still kicking myself for not trying this on my first visit. The ice cream has the perfect balance of sweetness to the vanilla. It's topped with puffed rice and almonds for crunch. The warm churro as a contrast is golden and delicious.  If they sold the ice cream in pints, I would buy it!",xSvbDk6TFQoVn9lioHSssA,1,1,5,mIp_9Fgkgbmnsd7wGy8iBA

2743843,2017-04-02,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"Awesome, awesome dogs; way, way understaffed.

Tried the veggie, mutt, house, and red dogs. Overall, the dog itself is flavorful, meaty, juicy, and it's got that great bite that makes hot dogs so great. And the dog is wrapped in bacon, but it doesn't interfere with the bite at all; just makes a crunchy, juicy, fatty wiener. Absolutely delicious.

They're stuffed with toppings, but not overfilled. Get the lobster bun; really buttery and soft to go with the hot, savory dog within. The toppings are reminiscent of the Chiptole fajita mix, with that grilled, mild Mexican flair.

RED DOG: This thing packs a very spicy punch. You can see the red pepper flakes lining every inch; really spicy but not excessively tongue-burning. I thought it was just right. There's a nice dressing/sauce underneath the wiener that brings the whole scrumptious thing together.

MUTT DOG: Tons of stuff going on here. Gotta get the lobster bun to sop up all the sauce coming underneath. It's got the heat of the red dog, with more spicy tomato sauce from the green dog part. The guac paired very nicely with the heat.

HOUSE DOG: Meh, what you'd expect from a hot dog with all of those toppings. Nothing crazy, not particularly memorable. Stick with the red/green/mutt.

The garlic fries were the bomb. Garlic for days. Their fries are really crispy and salty, but the garlic sauce just takes it to another level. A must-try.

The dirty corn is also great. If you're into carnival/fair style corn on the cob, make sure to get one of these. 

This is a genuine competitor for Vegas' best dog with Windy City and Bulgogi's. Vegas hot dog lovers, meat lovers, food lovers alike: put Dirt Dog next on your foodie bucket list.",uo_pVsOEkfe-6LwsWGOnkg,0,0,5,h6d0ppMWZncEtC-KrOZI1g

Lots of ingredients went on both kinds of hotdogs. If you like hotdogs that are big, hot, and full of ingredients, then Dirt Dog is the place.
Positives: the food didn't take long to come out. They have some board games on the side that you can play at your table. It's a nice change from seeing video poker machines to play, and our kids had fun playing Candy Land. Our fries were good to; we had the sea salt and black pepper, and the chili cheese fries. Lots of toppings again on the chili cheese fries, and the fries stayed hot and crispy. 
Negatives: the one front door is the only door to come in and out, and is about ten feet from the register so there is a huge cluster when there is more then two people in line and others are trying to leave. The music, very classic R&B/rap  but super loud ! One thing that did bother us was the chili cheese fries came out, then three minutes later the Sea salt and pepper fries came out, then five minutes later the hotdogs came out. Why the staggered food delivery?! And keeping up with cleaning the tables is always a must anywhere.

I mean, seriously.  It's like a whole new level of hot dog.  Unfailingly delicious and innovative toppings elevate these bacon wrapped dogs to heights heretofore unimagined.  Best sellers are the Red Dog and the Green Dog.  But why pick one or the other?  You can get both by ordering a Mutt.  Aye, that's the stuff!

You've gotta get the Dirty Chips.  They're dusted with just the right amount of seasoning.  Be SURE to try house made spicy ketchup.  They've got ranch, too, of course.  Woooo!

Chef Joana remembered me from my first visit.  I told her I've been jonesing for one of her Dirt Dog's ever since my last visit in July.  She made me a Mutt Dog that just couldn't be beat.  

The location of Dirt Dog is sort of off the beaten path, but don't let that stop you from visiting.  This place is well worth the drive.  Dirt Dog doesn't disappoint!

2876402,2017-08-07,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"Finally got to try this place out since I was in the area. I ordered a Mutt Dog and the Dirty Corn. The hot dog was super juicy and pretty tasty as well, although I did enjoy the Red Dog side more than the Green Dog. I loved the Portuguese roll and wish other hog dog places would use it as their bread as well! It was soft, chewy, slight crisp on the outside, and had just a hint of sweetness to balance out the saltiness of the hot dog. The line was also a nice touch since I added some of their extensive collection of hot sauces. They have so many types and it was definitely hard to choose! The one I pick was SUPER spicy though, and my mouth was on fire after a few drops. Fair warning to those who dare to try. The only complain I had about the Mutt Dog was the lack of toppings. I had a measly five or six slices of onion and I wish there were more. 

For the Dirty Corn, I found it just okay. The corn was fresh and sweet, but there wasn't enough char. The few bites I had with the char were phenomenal and I just wish it was on the grill a bit longer. The toppings didn't taste very traditional to me, probably because of the lack of chili powder that I usually love to sprinkle generously on. The taste improved a lot with a spritz of lime.

My friend ordered a House Dog with an order of Garlic Fries, which she enjoyed. Overall I would give this place 4 out of 5 stars. The food was pretty tasty but would be greatly improved with more toppings. The ambiance was nice- kinda had a sports bar feel with a touch of urban and edgy. Something that also knocked down the rating was the weird storage area near the bathrooms in the back of the restaurant.

The employees were friendly but didn't have much pep in their step in terms of cleaning and getting the food out. We had to get napkins to re clean the seats after the employee came and wiped them down. The bathrooms were not clean.

I have eaten here 4 times and have not ordered the same thing twice and can easily give this place five stars. The line moves quickly the staff is friendly and the food is served promptly. You can adjust your order to your taste however I recommend trusting the Chef & Order directly from the menu the dogs are insanely good. The french fries are outstanding. This is not a location where you will go to stay on some sort of diet or eating plan. This is a place where you get an amazingly delicious fresh hot dog made like no other hot dog you've ever eaten.

Not only that - it was brought out in numerous runs and therefore, some food got cold as we waited for the rest. When we confronted the staff, their solution was to just remove one of the items from our bill and refund us as we already paid. Needless to say, i was quite displeased with the customer service.

I kept seeing this place pop up on my YELP as a ""NEW and HOT Business""  and being that it's on the southwest area of town made it kind of convenient to drive to since I'm not that far away. I assumed this until I actually got into the car and start driving here. It's located in a pretty random area and not to mention a bit tricky to find depending on which way you are coming from. I had to ask myself ""No why would they put this location way out here"" Anyways so I finally located this place and pulled in.

Service is so HUGE in my book especially when you are a new establishment. I have to say that I wasn't impressed at all with the level on friendliness or service. I've had better service and hot dogs from Wienerschnitzel's.. No Shade! For starters, when I walked in I wasn't acknowledged and finally when somebody did come from the back they just looked at me look at the menu. No "" Hello!...Welcome!...Any questions on the menu?..."" you know the key components that I thought come pretty standard in a business. With you being a new place you usually have people make suggestions on the menu or hell even ask do you have any questions?. When I was finally greeted my order was taken and the guy who took my order went right back to talking to his friend or maybe a co-worker that was sitting at the counter about personal plans for the weekend. He was more concerned with getting back to that conversation than worrying about my first experience here. Not a good start at all. I ordered the House Dog... Red Dog... Sea Salt Fries.. Ran me a little over $15 and some change. Wait time on the food was quick. I opened my bag to make sure that the order was correct which it was. When I was on the way home of course I wanted to nibble on some fries only to find they weren't as fresh as I know they probably could've been. I was pretty much over it at this point and a little sorry I made the trip to try it out. The hot dogs were just OK.. Just didn't give me that WOW factor. You could tell they'd been sitting for a while and tasted maybe even a tad bit overcooked? Idk maybe I should've tried it on a different bun or maybe I didn't do that because it wasn't even suggested at the time of ordering. In my mind I feel if you have 3 different buns to offer I'm sure some of these buns are probably paired better with different type of hot dogs that the employee can kindly suggest. That didn't happen. I have to mention all this because these are simple things that can cost people from wanting to even come here to dine. I can't say that I'd be back anytime soon too many cons than pros...And if I do hopefully the experience will be a lot better.",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,6,4,2,UG_MAQmM4W832ZWlEsBIFQ

The food: ever wander out of a LA bar at 2am and smell bacon deliciousness?  Welp, Dirt Dog just brought that to Vegas!  Bacon wrapped dogs with grilled onions and peppers.....where it gets good?  The bonus toppings!  House, green, red or brown.  I chose the Red Dog, upon ordering I was warned that it was spicy.  No lie there!  Spicy with a great flavor but certainly a lasting sting.  Paired with garlic fries complete with fried garlic it was a meal I would come back for.  Craft beers on tap, sweet!  I was able to sample the corn courtesy of my boyfriend and it puts street corn to shame!  Picture elote, just add bacon....bacon makes everything better, am I right??  And then the sweet, sweet finale to my meal....D-E-S-S-E-R-T! That's right, dessert!  Fried Twinkie and Oreos to be exact, paired with housemade horchata whipped cream and sprinkles, my inner fat kid was pleased. 

If I didn't say enough about the food to have you venture to Dirt Dog, let me tell you about the staff and atmosphere.

The staff was friendly, offered a thorough detail of the menu, the back story of the restaurant and that was just when we walked in.  During our meal we were checked on by multiple staff members ensuring we enjoyed our meal.  There were suggestions for future visits on their favorite menu items as well.  The restaurant was clean and well kept, tables bussed and free of trash.  The 90's hip hop kept things nostalgic for me.  The only thing I would change, it was a smidge warm in the restaurant.  Not unbearable, but it wouldn't be pleasant for a sit down meal.",_vZFVI5rsjMGwSKN1p_Kbg,4,3,5,p7J3i0rnm9rttGX9e4vcIw

I wasn't sure what to order so I asked Anisha what she recommended. She recommended the ""Green Dog"" and the Chili Dog. I decided to order the Chili dog on the lobster roll bun, Al Pastor taco, and the Horchata Ice Cream with a Churro. 

The Chili Dog - was made with a house made spicy aioli, bacon and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize until after the fact that it had Aioli. I must say that I hate Aioli or Mayo. However, it was really good.

The Al Pastor - was marinated and seasoned really well with onions, and pineapples. 

The Churro and Horchata Ice Cream - was one of the best Churros that I've had in a long time. It was super moist in the inside and crunchy on the outside.

Ive been wanting to check out Dirt Dog after seeing pictures all over IG. I knew they had an LA location so I was excited to see that they opened one here in Vegas. 

Came here on a Saturday night around 5 pm. We started off with some elotes aka ""dirty corn."" The elote was bomb dot com, spread with lime infused mayo and butter compote and topped with cotija cheese, cilantro, and chili powder! With every bite, I could taste all the ingredients. It was so flavorful, and I don't remember enjoying corn as much as I did here. 

We tried a few of their hot dogs which included the Red Dog, Green Dog, Mutt Dog, and the House Dog. My favorite was the Mutt Dog, which is half Green Dog and half Red Dog. The Green Dog is topped with their homemade guac, chimichurri sauce, onions, bell peppers, and lime, while the Red Dog comes with a spicy tomato chile and chipotle aioli sauce. Besides all the fresh toppings and condiments, what makes these hot dogs so great is that all the sausages come bacon wrapped and placed in a lobster bun. The lobster bun adds some sweetness and butteriness to the hot dog and another level of awesome altogether. 

The fries were also really good, perfectly crisp and crunchy. The Filthy Fries were straight up filthy (in positive terms). The cheddar sauce was freakin amazing, and I wanted to spread it all over my hot dog. Talking about spread, I gotta come back to that horchata spread. Oh man, the desserts here are off the charts! I would come back just for the desserts alone. The fried Oreos were to die for along with the fried Twinkie. The batter was killer, and it was the best fried oreo I've ever had. They both came with this Horchata whipped cream, and I don't wanna hype it, but that Horchata spread was so damn good that I wanted to shed a tear. 

The entire staff was super friendly, and big ups to Tiffany for her excellent service and explaining every single dish down to all the nitty gritty details. 

Excellent food and superior service. Doesn't get better than that. Dirt Dog is a place you do not want to miss here in Vegas.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,6,5,5,XJk48jNbUXpmuOeL5gQJog

To begin, this place is conveniently located on Rainbow Blvd right between Blue Diamond Road and 215 so it is really easy to access. There is also plenty of parking. The place is reasonably big and wasn't packed at all when I went there.

This place offers specialty hot-dogs for $5.95 and sides (Fries, corn, etc...) and desserts (Deep-Fried twinkies, oreos, and churros, etc...) for $2.95. But this place becomes even more interesting with their beer selection. Dirt Dog offers a rotating selection of craft beers that are absolutely amazing. Whether you like light or dark beers, citrus or grapefruit flavored beers, expect to find something you like there! Jesse was instrumental in introducing all these beers to us and making us have a great time there. 

The atmosphere there is great and they even had a DJ and free cotton candy that day!

I ordered the plain bacon wrapped dog with the veggies (bell peppers and onions). It was good and the bread they use, the put butter on it and grill it. Nice touch!

The 5 Stars is really for the service.  I was there on 12/16 The front counter girl is awesome, great service! There's a girl that was working there that impressed me. She's short (like me) and had curly, dark hair. I don't know her name but that girl was on point in delivering food to the tables and getting the tables clean, all while smiling and being personable!

My hotdog had 0 sauce. Onions, peppers, and red pepper flakes on it. I had to put ketchup and hot sauce on it for any flavor.

The ""cook"" had a weird awkward smirk on his face while making it and the vibe of the place seemed uncomfortable. 
My bun also tasted burnt. 
I ate half and put it down. 
The dirty corn was AWESOME though I will say that and that's the ONLY reason why I will give it 2 stars was the corn.

Boring and dry for me and 3 other patrons having the same opinion. I don't see why this place has a high rating... maybe we came on a OFF night. Cooks seemed young and rude and the food was bland and dry.

Tucked away in a small retail plaza on Rainbow just north of Blue Diamond, Dirt Dog offers some bomb-ass hot dogs, fries, and fried desserts. 

The space is actually quite bigger than you'd expect, and they're actually not that busy...probably in part due to the remoteness of their location (but that's perfectly okay by me). 

Get the Dirty Chili Dog. It's the best dog they offer. Bun, bacon-wrapped dog, hearty meaty chili (no beans), cheese, onions, cilantro, and chili aioli. Perfection. The chili has spice, but not heat. And if you can manage to get that perfect bite of everything together, you'll be a customer for like.

The second-best product Dirt Dog offers is the Deep-Fried Oreos. Seriously. You need these in your life. They offer the perfect contrast to everything you just experienced with your Dirty Chili Dog. They're not overly-battered or greasy, they're sweet, warm, and the perfect texture. 

You NEED Dirt Dog in your life. Next time you're nearby, give it a go. You won't regret it. In fact, you'll probably be back next week.",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,1,0,5,8ulLXiEd1gI7mC3IU_hitg

This location isn't on my side of town however the trek was well worth it! Maybe just maybe one day they will open closer to me! Inside was clean and the staff was very friendly and happy to answer questions I had about the menu. You can get your order to-go or they have a good amount of tables/seating inside. Tacos are a newer addition to the Dirt Dog menu and I thought they were pretty good. The dogs are really where it's at for me, but it's nice to have options.

Chicken Tinga Taco ($2) - Chipotle tomato sauce, onions and cilantro. Corn tortillas are currently the only option for the tacos, no flour. Holy shit this was a spicy taco! I loved the flavor and even though I seriously had sweat rolling down my face, I couldn't help but keep taking another bite. 

Al Pastor Taco ($2) - The meat is marinated and grilled pineapples and onions are what tops this taco. Al Pastor is usually my taco of choice so I was really looking forward to trying this one. Sadly it wasn't good at all. When I picked up the taco it fell it was so soggy that all the fillings just fell through. The pineapple seemed canned, so not sure how it's getting grilled. I prefer fresh pineapple that you see getting sliced over a spit or grill.

Carne Asada Taco ($2) - Pico de Gallo and scallions top this red chile cilantro marinated asada. Good flavor and especially well liked by my hubby. They have some really tasty sauces/salsas here that pair nicely with this taco. 

Dirt Dogs are about $6 each and come fully loaded. They don't skimp on toppings and have great flavor. I love the slightly buttered and grilled split-top buns (aka new england or lobster bun) and the bread holds the dog and toppings nicely. They also have Portuguese and traditional buns as an option.  

The Dirty Chips are very good and I recommend adding cheese and meat of your choice it really takes these tasty chips up another level. Dirty Corn is reasonably priced and I didn't think it was bad, but I didn't think it was great either. My drink of choice here is the Horchata it's very good and better than I have had at other places recently. Oh yes, they also serve beer! For dessert you can choose from fried oreos or twinkies, horchata ice cream and churros.

But instead I will talk about the churro :)

The churro is only $2 and it is fresh and crunchy and moist in the middle and has plenty of cinnamon sugar which is a must for churros and there is even lots at the bottom of the basket that you can pick up and keep making it rain goodness all over your churro . I personally like to take my time and continue to dress my churro up and make sure every bit is covered with the special dust so I never get a naked bite lol. And to top of the churro they send it out with a whipped cinnamon cream that kinda taste like horchata which just really puts the finishing touch on the churro.

Upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly woman at the counter with bright pink hair. The dining room is very cool/hip/clean. The music is mix of something you'd hear in LA - some reggae, kayne, and sublime made for a relaxed feel (maybe not so much the kayne, but personal opinion ha!). 

We were asked if we had been there before and said ""no."" The cashier went on to tell us about their hot dogs and which things she enjoyed the most. I went with the Red Dog and asked for the chili flakes on the side (I get worried when cooks have the ability to scorch my mouth with pepper flakes), the ""Dirty Esquite,"" a fried Twinkie  and a fountain drink. Came to roughly $14 - not bad at all!

The hot dog was pretty spicy without the flakes on top for a garnish. It was super flavorful, had a nice snap/crunch, and the traditional bun was perfect with it. The Esquite was packed with flavor! It comes with a lime wedge, which you definitely want to use. The fried Twinkie was, well, a fried Twinkie. It was delicious. But what set it off was the horchata whipped cream!

It was tasty and I did enjoy it but the price is outrageous when you really think about what you've purchased - that is a cost of about a week's worth of groceries for a lot of people. For the price, it's not worth it at all, and it would not be something I frequent. I love hot dogs, I make them all the time, and I use Sucker Punch spicy pickles (I dice them into a relish), and it's my favorite fast food at home. With that said, I'm a bit picky with how I like them. I get the hype over this place but I do feel you're better off buying kosher or organic dogs and doing them at home. 

Flavors are good and fun to have them every now and then, but again, it's just way too expensive for some wieners. I am happy, though, for the owners and their success.",-SWRw9-1ARVKLAWE0Sxw1Q,0,0,4,pD73PIrH4AgmeSDBBNLDhQ

If you like sweet breads, I recommend getting the Portuguese bun.

The garlic fries.. The garlic sauce was soooo good! Next time I come here, I'm going to ask them if they can drench my fries with this sauce! Haha

Being in the state of borderline hangry status, I was very excited to finally try a dog at Dirt Dog. 

Like a true Yelper, I was figuring out what I was going to order before I even arrived. Green dog...red dog...-errr...should I go with the Mutt? I even showed the menu to my peers to help me decide, because let's keep it real, no one should be ordering the same thing. 

When I walked in, I FREAKED OUT when I saw there was a whole other menu (or 2) aside from what is listed online. ""There's an even dirtier dog?! And Tacos?! And dessert?!"" I found myself experiencing drive-through anxiety and ended up with the Elote dog on a lobster roll, with chili fries...and carne asada fries---- I dunno, it all happened so fast. 

Long story, short, delicious dogs and fries. Definitely hit the spot. Their dogs are Nathan's all-beef (and bacon-wrapped), so...yum. The only reason why I'm not giving it a 5 is because Dog Haus exisits...and I'm a true sucker for Dog Haus (1. they make their own dogs, 2. they have smaller portions available one can sample everything, 3. well, I'll save this for another review).",iOok30z2H8XVnaMeCjgqCQ,1,2,4,AK6WcBg33W-YjrnD_ksGcg

It's located deep within the Grand Bazaar Shops of the Bally's Resort, across from Wahlburgers and next door to Fuel Bar and Sin City Brewing Co. You could walk right past it if you're not paying attention. The eminating french fry smell was what caught my attention and made me stop to look around, after which I spotted their hot dog display.  The place is so compact that it reminds me of a hole-in-the-wall I might find in New York City.  

I decided to try their House Dog (first item on the menu) with a side of lime seasoned Dirty Fries. The hot dog was juicy and the bread--which was grilled to a light crust--was soft and warm. The fries were fresh and delicious, albeit a tad too salty (they could have dialed back the seasoning). The dog's chile spread (a combination of what appeared to be chipotle mayo, green and red peppers, bacon bits and onions) was tasty but very messy. Although every bite was pleasant, it was a struggle keeping my hands clean. The ""dirty"" namesake makes more sense now.

If you like hot dogs, are looking for something quick, or are in dire need of an alternative to the plethora of overhyped and overpriced restaurants in the area, then Dirt Dog is your answer.

Dirty Corn - Kind of disappointing, it looks super authentic and appetizing but it was very dry and the seasoning was not strong enough. I think if they added on cream or mayo rather than leaving it dry it would have had more flavor.

Dirt Dog is damn good! Came here randomly after Facebook bombarded me with ads for the place. Do y'know which ones I'm talking about? ...You probably do. They're almost pornographic, in a food way.

But, anyway: I ordered the House Dog on a Portuguese bun with a side of Elote Fries.

Both were astounding! The hotdog was massive and packed with flavor. I sorta wish I had been a little more daring with my choice of dog though. The House Dog was tame compared some other options on the menu... But still tasty nonetheless!

Truthfully, it was the side of fries that stole the show for me. Just imagine: crispy, salted fries soaking up all the flavor from the creamy, lime-y corn. It's almost as if the two were meant to be combined!

I'll definitely be back to try some more.",ImnJ5KKaWWNjj1E9kEArmQ,2,3,4,ESIbGkVLb3MPm6t0d37dCQ

I like to call these ""Frances and Porter's Excellent Lunch Adventures"". Nine times out of ten it's for lunch. Nine times out of ten we say we are going to go to ""restaurant a"" and wind up going to ""restaurant b"" or ""restaurant c"". Always changing our minds.

BUT... thanks to YELP, I came across Dirt Dog, and we went straight there, no stopping. We says pictures of this place and had our minds made up. Turns out Dirt Dog's location is at a former hamburger joint that I just loved.

About 15 minutes after Dirt Dog opened for the day; we went inside and were immediately greeted. By a young lady in a halter top. If not for the fact that she was behind the counter, I would have thought her to be another customer. She was however very informative about the menu. Here's what we ordered.

Fran: The Green Dog: Chimichurri Sauce, Guacamole Spread with Garlic Fries

Porter: The Red Dog: Spicy Tomato Chile Sauce, Chipotle Sauce with Dirty Fires

The food is awesome people. The cost, just under twenty-five dollars!

Fountain drinks for beverages. Sodas, tea that sort. There is also a bar area.

The decor to Dirt Dog is pretty cool but seems unfinished. One wall has a floor to ceiling map of southwest Las Vegas. The other side of the room was a blank wall. Walking towards the restroom is an empty room. This appears to be a waiting room of sorts. A window for take-out at one end, door to the world on the other. A very large sticker of sorts is on a wall in this room. The sticker is of the Dirt Dog logo. But a good portion has come free of the wall. 

So here's the plus side: 
The Food

So here's what I consider to be a negatives:
No staff uniforms, not even name tags
Incomplete decorations on the walls.

I always get very filled up as my wife and I usually each get a dog(veggie one for me) and fries but we added the esquite corn and it was a complete meal.  The best thing about Dirt Dog is they have a soy frank but they will cook it on a separate grill so you don't get any meat lingerings from other orders.

I like to share that all of the selections do have a spicy level to each item. Other than they're delicious dirty dogs, you should try out their selection chili fries and desert. For my first time there, I had to try out the signature items along side the all time public favorites. I started off with a house dog and dirty chili dog which both had a spicy-chorizo chili taste, then shred a batch of filthy fries topped with guacamole, chipotle aioli, cheddar and cotija cheese. I finished off with their sweet Horchata ice cream with churro. That cinnamon blend really puts flavor into my tastebuds. I ordered deep fried Oreos for the kids and they only come in 2 pieces. It was not worth the price for just 2 pieces... The whole thing actually cost me a total of $35 which is pretty pricy but it's always worth the experience. You might even become a regular here. Overall I bet this would be a perfect spot to watch sport games if they added more tv screens all over. They already have an alcohol license and beer to complement their foods.

Clean establishment. Friendly staff and our cashier even made recommendations. I of course wanted to try everything there was. 

Ordered the first 4 dogs on the menu, garlic fries and the horchata/churro dessert. 
Verdict: 
My favorite is the green dog. Chimichurri sauce is amazing. Red dog was spicy as f but then again, I don't often eat spicy foods. The traditional house dog was fabulous and my least favorite was the brown dog. The flavor didn't pop. 

Garlic Fries - I prefer them nice and crispy. These are definitely not. And the garlic sauce that comes with it is okay. Maybe they need to chop the herbs in there a bit smaller. 

The dessert came out looking all wrong. I guess they were having problems making the churro so first came the horchata ice cream and then then a really over done churro. Way over done. The ice cream tastes like a vanilla ice cream with bits of sprinkles. Have you ever tried the horchata at Taco y Taco? That's like Christmas in your mouth.

Let's Go!

Vibe: 
So Dirt Dogs has a origin story coming from LA. The decor was made to make you feel like you we're walking on the street in LA. Coming from California I have to say I loved the decor. Although it seemed a bit cheesy it had a nice feel. There were 2 things that I really liked in the restaurant. One was angel wings painted at the back of the restaurant. It was a major photo op. Now the second was a pin wall the I absolutely loved. It was a map of some of Vegas that allowed people to pin their names to the wall. It was nice and interactive.

Service:
So dirt dogs has a cashier and a table service to deliver the food other than that there is not much employee customer interaction. In all honesty, I don't mind that at all. The employees are nice, helpful and prompt.

Food:
Now the thing you want to know about... How's the food?
It's fantastic! I went with my family and we ordered the elotes dog, and a patty melt dog. For the Patty melt dog, we ordered it with Texas toast which they refer to as lobster bread. It was so good. All their dogs are wrapped and cooked in bacon. The fries threw me off but it was good with the chipotle aioli was A1! Now the Elotes dog... I hate cilantro but on this hot dog? I couldn't even tell is was there. It was just like eating elotes. 

I loved my experience here. It was nice, chill, and I hope to come here again.",HH7VzcNn3jAZ0_J4Xr9JsQ,1,1,5,5GNIM3r1TkskgvGonzwN4w

Price might be a little high but the food is better than avg. so I don't have an issue with it. They play a lot of hip hop and hardcore rap classics. They have a few TVs and some board/table games.

4/5 because of price for value and the ordering at register creates congestion at the main entry.

Mutt dog with lobster roll: first off, it seemed like I got the end of a bread or something because mine was way thinner than my boyfriend's and the hot dog fell apart after one bite, which was surprising because he got the chili cheese dog. This hot dog was supposed to be 1/2 green dog and 1/2 red dog. The red dog was so overpowering that I couldn't even tell it was a mixture, it felt like I only got the red dog. It was so spicy I couldn't even eat it. It  was so spicy I drank my water and also my boyfriend's water. 

Chili cheese dog: it was good. Mostly just tasted like a standard chili cheese dog. The lobster roll on this one is was way better. I wasn't amazed by it.

Elote fries: pretty good, I liked the mixture.

And never fear - vegan options are here!

I tried the vegan carnitas tacos. They were fantastic, and topped with guacamole and a few not-overly crunchy plantains. I believe they were $2.00 each taco. 

I also was excited to test out the spicy eloté which is basically just corn engulfed in hot cheetos along with the other standard eloté toppings that street vendors usually include. I wasn't terribly impressed to be honest, but sometimes that happens when you get yourself too pumped up to try something new; you develop unrealistic expectations. However, it is a beautiful social media #foodporn photo post.

Speaking of social media, this location frequently utilizes Instagram to advertise their specialty items, and this successfully results in them being a thriving business. You may want to prepare for a large line at the register and no free tables, but maybe you'll get lucky?

Their Specialty Hotdogs (Dirt dogs) are all priced between $6.25-$7.25, and they aren't your average hotdogs, these are loaded with the good stuff. My favorite is the House Dog ( bacon thousand island, onion, bell peppers, green chile, of course bacon bits! , ketchup, mayo and mustard) and you can even choose a lobster bun for that! 

Sides - pleaseee get the Dirty Esquite! (Corn in a cup with cotija cheese, cilantro and chili powder) amazzingg! And the Filthy Fries (guac, chipotle aioli, cheddar and cotija cheese ) another one for the win! 

And of course, a meal won't be complete without dessert, at least for me, I ordered the Deep Fried Oreos served with Horchata Ice Cream and sprinkles, the oreo was not oily, and its freakin delicious!! 

There's few seating near by,but some days they fill up fast. Location is in the Grand Bazaar Shops, you can type in the address and it will take you there.

The beauty in coming to a new spot with my spouse is we split. So I get to try more without stuffing myself. He ordered their red dog and I tried the green dog. We split the dirty corn, garlic fries and a Twinkie. Although it was so good we almost had to order two twinkles. 
The red dog was great. Nice and spicy, covered in bacon and veggies. 
The green dog was not spicy but had a zesty and refreshing flavor that calmed the spice from the red dog down. 
The garlic fries are plain fries with a delicious garlic dipping sauce so you can control how much anti vampire flavor you want. I will be getting TWO sides of this on my next visit.....it was YUMMY! 
The corn was missing the creaminess of the mayo that I'm accustomed to with street corn. That being said it was still very good. It came on a stick so it was easier to handle covered in cheese, bacon and cilantro. 
And lastly, when you come in save room for desert! I might have to stop in just for late night fried Twinkie runs....this could be dangerous! They serve it with a light dipping sauce that really complements the Twinkie.

There's definitely an LA feel to this place especially with an LA radio station playing while you eat. The servers were friendly & attentive. I did mention that sprinkled salt on the fries would add flavor if you didnt want to dip your fries in the yummy garlic dip.

Came in for my first dirt dog with my lady, the presentation is on point every thing that you order comes out looking like what they named it to the T. For me I guess I have had better hotdogs. It just seemed like the hotdog itself was extremely salty so any of the condiments or garnish you could possibly order you can't truly taste due to the saltiness. The idea is one of a kind I give 5 stars for creativity but the taste counts too! For example all I could taste on the Elote Dog was the cotija cheese and high amounts of sodium, usually corn is sweet  it was like extra filler corn very bland.",RijJ1GeiTxJcWKR1IpO49g,0,0,3,PJWILBp0WAg-Z4T1GE6jBQ

We also ordered 2 coronas, which didn't come with limes, so we had to ask for-however, we were only given 1 single lime. When we asked for more limes, they decided to bring another one-piece of lime-what a waste of labor and energy.

The fries were salty, but somehow they lacked in flavor. The tacos were alright, but they were not that good to die for- I personally liked the chicken tinga the most-as it was the most flavorful one. The elote was bomb actually though, and so were the esquites-even thugh they were a little too watery. 

The complaint I had was about their service. Apparently, my friends who have previously visited this place mentioned their service was good and so were their food. However, the service on the night we went was just mediocre. The server was slow, and nowhere to be found when needed. Our table was not cleaned in time. The floors were dirty, and not a single bottle of sauces were refilled.

The hotdogs were all legit. Don't even bother to get it without the lobster bun, because I think that's what complemented the dogs in a perfect way. 

The corn on the cob was out of the world. However, my second attempt, they somewhat skimped on the sauce and cheese, so it wasn't as good. 

The horchata whip cream is like crack. The deep fried oreos and twinkies were amazing, and by far the best I've had. As for the churros, they seemed a bit burnt. The second time I ordered it, it was the same, so must be something about the dough/temperature of the oil.

Going to LA is one of my favorite experiences: relaxing at night on the beaches, trying all the great food, and indulging in the California lifestyle. One visit at the flea markets is when I first had the California dirty dogs. A mexican creation of a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with crema, avocados, and onions is what make childhood memories great. Hearing that we were having an establishment named after this delicious treat, makes me utter a phrase I thought I'd never say, ""I need some of that weiner!""

Setting: Incredibly difficult to find, and placed in a terrible location. From blue diamond, it is the first plaza on the right where the bar and the pho place is. From 215 the last plaza on the right before you reach blue diamond. 

Interior: Huge, and very open with tvs posted throughout the space.

Service: There was 2 parties in the restaurant and it took about 20 minutes for my food to come out. I mean for a hotdog and a corn on a stick you'd think they'd come out much sooner than that.

Food: I got the house dog and the loaded elote. Elote: super weak, it pretty much is just a normal piece of corn, decorated with flavorless ingredients and really disappointed me. The House dog was ok and the topping added it to it made it all taste the same rather than having each ingredient stand out.

Overall: I won't be coming back here, I hear steamie weenie has a jalapeno jelly hotdog with other fixins that I'm going to check out next.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,8,5,2,6rcmva_43F2njF2RrejgOQ

Dirty Dog and Green Dog tasted very salty and not sure if that is how it is supposed to be or if the cook had a very off day. My wife and I couldn't continue with the punishment.

Dirty Esquite and elote fries was ok

I was very aroused by my food. The ladies behind the counter warned me to put my clothing back in and so I obliged. Then enjoyed my delicious food. The hot dogs and their topping complimented one another how a Victoria secret models wings, panties, and bra compliment their bodies. As my food was demolished in by inch and the dogs and beer made their way down to my belly like George Washington attacking the British red coats. I was finished and satisfied. The sexy hot dogs had made their way down the runway and back. Residing now in my belly. Then came my deep fried Oreos with honey butter (I believe). I nearly fell out of my chair and offered my body as sacrifice to the aztec god quetzalcoatl. They made love to me orally and washed down elegantly. I will say I was spent after my indulgence here.

I had the patty melt dog which was super bomb! A little hard to eat because it was so big but that's not really a bad thing! The regular bun held up really well and was so soft and tasty even on it's own. 

I also had the dirty corn which was ok, it wasn't the best thing ever and I would probably just order something else next time instead. 

The horchata was really good.

As for the place itself, it's s really cool place with lots of murals and the colors along with the decoration were very harmonious. The only one thing I didn't like much was the bathroom because it was a little too dark.

4567202,2017-03-07,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"Good things and bad things about this place. which I ferociously consumed within the last 5 minutes. First it's overpriced. Owners have to remember that in the end they are still serving hotdogs. I mean I paid close to 30 dollars for 2 chili dogs, an order of chili fries, and deep fried oreos. Now I know what everyone must be thinking that's alot of food for 30 dollars. No it wasn't sadly. As a former professional chef I can understand food costs and making sure your turning a profit or attempting too as a newly opened business. However, giving me a very small dessert box with 20 small broken french fries that came from the freezer covered in a small amount of chili is not worth 6 dollars to me, it's just not. I won't completely bash the fries, the little bit of chili I did have was delicious.

 The dessert, ahhh the lovely taste of cookies dipped in a sweet batter and deep fried, served with horchata whipped cream. What could be wrong with that? Well again with the cost. I will say nothing more other than I think that 4 to an order based on the cost would be generous.

The chili dogs. Well the menu stated house made chili with melted bacon cheddar cheese. Chili was on point meaty, savory, everything you could want in a good house made chili. The cheese, again delicious. The bun, a lightly buttered split top bun that held everything together nicely. The dog itself was all beef which is expected, juicy, with a nice snap to the casing. But, there was another flavor involved. A spicy, unwanted flavor, which I discovered was an undisclosed jalapeño mayo of some sort. The problem I have with this is that it was undisclosed but most of all took away from my ability to enjoy it without taking a sip of my drink halfway through chewing because of the heat. Oh and they hotdogs were 8 dollars a peice. 8 dollars for a hotdog? I believe that serving high quality food for a fair price is something that has seemed to have gotten lost. You can serve food for these prices on the Las Vegas Strip because it's a tourist destination and you can get away with it. Off the strip that stuff doesn't fly, at least not with me. I think this business needs to rethink the cost of their menu. That is probably a good reason why only two tables were occupied for dinner. 

For all these reasons Dirt Dog gets 3 stars. Three very generous, wife influenced 3 stars.",SfbqU4ZhCFZ4gU1h1h6r6g,0,0,3,5OepP6JJfSVfTFapVBbLlQ

We absolutely love elote and couldn't pass this up. Plus hotdogs and tacos? Score! We ordered dirty esquite, 4 carne asada tacos, 3 pastor tacos, 1 elote dog, 1 filthy fry, and a dirty elote and some drinks. My first issue was that the dirty elote (pretty much a traditional elote style corn) and one of the carne asada tacos never came. When we finally checked the receipt we realized the cashier hadn't charged us so my husband went back to order it and see how long it was going to be, he decided it wasn't worth the wait as he'd already finished his hot dog (not a huge deal since we weren't charged but my husband was bummed). The elote dog was pretty bland. I didn't really taste the corn over the beef flavor of the dog. The dirty esquite felt like they had just added a bunch of cotjia to a cup of corn and it was kind of dry. The tacos also didn't pack much flavor. They came with a wedge of lime and some red salsa that was kind of an average salsa. Now I will say the filthy fries were pretty good. They had guacamole, chipotle aioli, cotija, and some melted cheese. I really enjoyed the chipotle aioli and think they could've added that to the elote dog for a kick. The fries were all our favorites and agreed we'd eat them again but that the rest of the food wasn't worth the drive from centennial out to blue diamond. It wasn't a total bust for a one time trip. Overall we just felt a little rushed ordering and the cashier not hearing parts of the order was disappointing. The order also wasn't read back to us so we didn't realize the mistake. The tables had order numbers left and we couldn't tel which tables were taken and had trash left behind as well so we had to clean off a table for ourselves.

I ordered the ""brown dog"" with a veggie dog which was essentially a teriyaki stir fry on top of a veggie dog in a buttery soft bun! LORD IN HEAVEN. I cannot. The carbs. But so good. So, so good. We got the kids corn dogs for our 4 year old son and he  also gobbled that shit up. 

Okay, suffice to say that the food is friggen awesome. The cashier was also super friendly and the service was fast!

I'm in the Summerlin area - looking for something that's still open and has people raving. In comes Dirt Dog , a place my bro in law visited while he was down in LA. The reviews are superb, so why the hell not? 

My fiancé and I arrive to find a few people inside, rap/hip-hop music playing in the background and a smiling person up front to take our order. 

We order the elote (with light cotija cheese) & the filthy fries. We attempted to order the horchata dessert (which looked damn delicious) but the clerk informed us that the churros weren't coming out right so they weren't going to sell those (which i appreciate cause I'm not trying to eat a wonky looking churro LOL). 

When our order arrived, my fiancé noticed that there were bacon bits on the filthy fries (even though that's not listed as an ingredient on the menu). There were also bacon bits on my elote which I hadn't noticed so I appreciate the lady who came running out to tell me after she found out we don't eat bacon. I'm happy that they were willing to make our order again - that too without any hesitation! :) 

As for the food, I think it was a little cold but that's probably because we took it to go instead of eating it in. 
I'll be back earlier next time to dine in though! 

Customer Service = FIVE. 
I'm docking a star because I think that something like bacon should be stated as an ingredient on the menu.

Little did I know that when we did walk in, the place was completely empty. The only physical person we saw was one guy in the back in the kitchen area. I noticed that guy did glance at us but he didn't greet us until my boyfriend waved his hands in the air. We stood in the front scoping the menu for about ten minutes until a lady walked out from the back and told us ""She would be right with us."" We we're in no rush so we didn't mind. It felt like another five minutes flew by until our order we finally taken. We were just questioning why it took so long to order and wondered if they just opened cause it looked like they were still preparing for the day. 

When it came to the food, I got the Dirty Chili Dog. Right when it got served to me, I was very excited. The sauce was dripping down the bun and it overall looked stuffed. First bite, was outstanding! I got a taste of the flavors including the bacon bits. It was not until the middle of the dog that I realized that the bottom half of my bun was sort of hard. The only reason I didn't catch it right away was because the dog itself was covered in sauce. Other than that, my hot dog was pretty good. Not bad at all. 

My boyfriend tried the tacos! $2 dollars a taco, he begs to differ. Out of the three tacos, he realized one of his tacos were cold. But the rest were like warm. Those were his only complaints about the tacos but overall they were pretty decent. 

Would we come back to this place? Sure, if we were in the area and it was one of our last resort. This place was not bad at all.",OhtTOqrT_yKzzBYQy52jVA,0,0,3,HBVfwBbjoOGAPA7uAixUcg

Each hot dog is apparently wrapped in bacon which makes it even better. You have a choice of buns you can put your hot dog on..from lobster roll (which is $0.50) more or Portuguese roll or regularbhot dog bun. 

I ordered the red dogg. Which has chile sauce, peppers and chipotle aioli. It was pretty good. The peppers definitely gave it a good kick of spice. The toppings weren't overwhelming with alot of stuff so you can actually taste the juiciness of the hot dog. Yumm. 
My friend ordered the mutt dog which is a mix between the red dogg and green dogg. He said it was pretty good. 

I also ordered the filthy fries. Wasn't a huge fan of this one. It has cotija cheese, guacamole, cheese spread and fries. It didn't taste as great as it sounded. Next time I'll stick with regular fries.

The hot dogs are juicy and bacon wrapped and a very decent size dog.  The toppings were just enough that they had little falling of but enough that you got toppings in each bite.

The lines do get long and parking can be tricky. The restaurant is tucked in the way back corner of a strip mall where a pet hospital and a big bar/lounge is, so I recommend just parking a little farther and just walking the rest of the way. Customer service is really nice and the murals of Tupac and Kobe Bryant adds to the atmosphere. They offer style tacos and a vegan taco too. The corn on the cob is Mexican street style with chili powder, slice of lime, and cotija cheese on top. Yum yum. They also serve some craft beers, horchata, and Jamaica drink. However, sometime they run out of things. Maybe because they are so busy? Like today they said they ran out if CO2 for their soda machine. Boo. And they ran out of horchata today. Either way, the place is still cool and the food is good. I'm sure they will work out some of these supply issues as they see how more popular they are getting.

The house dog with the bacon thousand island? Are you kidding me? Bacon Thousand Island? Then... more bacon? Soooooo good!

The Red dog just had such great flavor... smokey from the chipotle and some kick from the chili sauce...oh yeah, more bacon!  Can't pick a favorite here.  The only true winner was me since I got to try both.  The fries were solid, but I couldn't make my way through all of them.

I asked if there was any way to just purchase half a hot dog with no toppings. The man working the front informed me that I would be charged full price *$5.95 and that a kids menu was in the works. That's fine and all but full price for a half hot dog for a toddler? That's a bit much in my opinion but we made do and just shared what we ordered with our daughter. Also there is no changing table in the women's bathroom, I'm going to guess that there will be parents bringing their toddlers and babies in sometime that may need to be changed. So it's a good idea to have one installed in both the women AND men's bathrooms. They at least had high chairs, so good job on that!

My son's meal come first. He loved everything. My corn on the cob came next. I kind of liked how they didn't wait to bring out the dog and the corn together. I can only eat one at a time anyway. And this way the dog wasn't cold when I was ready to dig into it. 

I was thrown at the register when paying. It asks how much you want to tip. This was my first visit so I wasn't familiar with how the place was run. I tipped lower than usual as a result.

First off, the restaurant has such a cool vibe to it. The decor is nice, the staff is great & I loved the music; old school hip hop & some other music genres mixed in. Very open seating, so you don't feel cramped at all. 

Now onto the food...Oh. My. Goodness! Everything we ate was amazing. We got 4 different dogs. The spicy one being my favorite but all delicious. The fries were crisp & cooked/flavored perfectly. Dessert did not disappoint at all! I loved the horchata ice cream & the portion size was perfect for my boyfriend & I to share. The homemade churros were soooo much better than your standard churro & it came with a great cream to dip it in that complimented the flavor well. Deep fried Oreos were awesome. 

I will 100% be back again & the one thing I loved was that I didn't feel gross after all that food. Usually with hot dogs & sweets you feel heavy, bloated, greasy, etc & I felt great. I think that speaks to the quality of the food & the way it's cooked. Everyone must try this place!",zuJwiAXFGQ4_Dfozybx5kg,0,0,5,7HrvI2II8S7WPMvPnwE5xQ

Right when you walk in to the place a very nice girl greets you and asks if you have been there before. We told her no, so she gave us the run down of all the need to know's!  

We tried a little bit of everything. Everything was really, really good! We didn't dine in because we were on the go, but we appreciate the way they packaged everything so well, including the corn on the stick.  

I had the house dog and loved it. They are large, but still wish I would have ordered two even though I know, I would have been dying stuffed. 

The chicken taco I ordered was on the smaller side, but I mostly came for the hot dog.  I regret not ordering the elote fries; next time.

4875383,2017-02-03,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"The best hotdog you've ever had - period. Located off of south rainbow and next to a pho place, lets just say I eat a lot less pho and a lot more dirtdogs.

This place is about the dog, but more than that, they're about the toppings and the bun.

TIPS:

1. Be prepared to wait a bit. Not because the place is ever slammed with customers, but because the quality of food they provide just takes a bit to finish.
2. GET THE LOBSTER ROLL. I personally think this should be the only bread option they offer because it's so much better than a regular bun.
3. Chips/Fries - these are just OK in my opinion, however, if you like seasoned fries/chips, they may be up your alley.
4. One hotdog is enough, unless you're a really big, super starving dude. I'd recommended bringing a friend, ordering two different dogs and splitting them. It's amazing how different they taste.

I decided to order the Green Dog and the Mexican corn in a dish as a side. You are able to pick the bun you want with your hot dog so I picked the Lobster bun based off the recommendation of the server. The roll has nothing to do with lobster so if you aren't a sea food fan do not let this scare you away. I was glad I did because it was really soft and buttery.

The hot dog itself was pretty good. The only recommendation I can give is to grill hotdogs. They taste so much better when they are grilled and I think it would really enhance the flavor. I also wished they put the guacamole on the top of the dog instead of in the roll because it was hard to taste that way.

The corn was good as well but I wish there was a little less cheese because it overpowered the corn. 

Overall it was ok, just wish they were able to grill the hot dogs.",eh9uc8xHYR9-rki7fWggQQ,2,1,3,LIcVAeSWEdV9ExVnVOB6aA

Me and wifey tried the green dog and the brown dog with both lobster bread. The hot dog and the mix that goes along with it are okay, the bread was very good though. Its a one time quitter for me.

The cashier got everything correct in our order and made sure she repeated it so there was no mistake. Great cashier! 

There is a sign attached to the straps that hold the line together. It says ""You cannot take a table unless you have paid for your order and got a number"". The reason for this is because there is only 10 tables in this place. No room at all. 

We get our number and look around and there is a kid sitting at a big table all by himself. No parents, no food, or number on the table. The server brings our food and we pointed out that we needed that table and they weren't following the rules, that your business made. The server goes over and the boy tells her his family is in line. She comes back and doesn't do anything about it. She didnt wanna deal with it. So we stood there, with our food in our hand waiting for a table when there was one right in front of us but the employees wont inforce the rules. 

We got a table right next to the kid and his family finally sat down 15 minutes later... 

The food was great. No complaints there at all but I personally won't come back because that was completely disrespectful. You have rules, we are following them and you make us wait.

I had seen advertisements and reviews that were good so what the heck. It was not the easiest to find in the shopping center, But I may have entered the wrong driveway. I walked in and went to the counter and I ordered the Dirty Chili Dog and the Dirty Corn as well as a drink. The Dog was wrapped in bacon and cooked perfectly covered in a semi spiced meaty chili. I can't say that I was wowed but I was impressed with the Dog. The wrapped in bacon part is a signature way they cook em. The Dirty corn was exactly what I was hoping for. Grilled corn topped with crema, cotija cheese, cilantro, bacon bits and chili powder. Served with slice of lime. The Menu describes it perfectly so might as well use theirs. Firm Crisp Corn with a sweat crema flavor and a bite of heat from chili powder. I opted to not use the lime, but one of the neighboring tables said that was the trick to it. 
Thank you for dining  at Dirt Dog. I need to go here again and try the different varieties and take Josie for the corn. She would find it amazing. If in the area please go check it out. They have beer also by bottle and draft. I was going to a work meeting so I opted out of the adult beverage.",QtuzG4-zmGTdB0jSMC54tg,1,0,4,lkhJ1ObuA445hpJba69NkQ

I had the house dog on the lobster roll.....don't waste the 50 cents extra....hubby had it on a regular roll and said it was extra good. The onions were barely cooked certainly not caramelized and I didn't have any bell peppers.....wrapped in bacon no but there were bacon bits.  Still it was very good. Now...I had the dirty chips and my husband had the (or tried to have) fries with cracked pepper.  The first food out was the hot dogs.  Then my chips came (they were over cooked and tasteless) and then, after talking to two waiters we got my husbands fries.....should have kept our mouth shut.....they weren't good at all.  Mind you we were 3/4 way thru our meal.  The manager came out and compensated the meal.  I hate that....it's like you complained in order to get free food.

The good:

The customer service was outstanding. The cashier must list all the buns they have to every customer she helps all day everyday, but when I asked what types of buns they offered she was super patient and explained everything with a smile on her face. We were also approached a few times during our meal to see how everything was going and to clear any trash we had. 

My order was delivered to my table super quick. I placed my number on my table, walked away to grab napkins, and when I returned it was at my table waiting for me. 

The bad:

My food was cold. The hot dog had good components, and I feel like it would have been really good if it was hot, but I ordered the patty melt and the fries were cold and soggy. The bun was hot, but the inside of my hotdog was cold. The corn that I ordered was also pretty cold and seemed like it had been sitting in the back for a bit. The flavors were good, but I can't eat a cup of cold corn.

5310711,2018-03-28,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"Craving food from the City of Angels? This is one if the places that originated from LA. Located in a small shopping center in Southwest Las Vegas, you will find locals and a lot of people from Cali checking this place out. 

When you walk in, line to order is just ahead. Did not like that part as this creates heavy traffic that loops the line into the exit line and to the people entering the establishment. This makes it hard for new comers and repeated customers from deciding on what to order. The menus itself are displayed to the right side of the wall making it harder for people to take a look see at the menu. 

Inside they is pretty small as well, especially for those who have families to eat dinner with. There is a capacity of up to 30 people or so. If you plan on eating there come before 6 oclock. My fiance and I got lucky. Right when we walked in we were able to order right away. 

Now the menu. They are known for their hot dogs and the street foods. The street foods they offer: street tacos, fried foods (fried oreos, Twinkies), horchata ice cream w/churro, garlic fries, chips, elote, and a few things off the secret menu. 

What we ordered: the extra dirty chilli dog. You can choose from three different buns, but the one we chose was the lobster roll. The dog was dressed with onions, cilantro, chilli cheese, and topped with bacon. I ordered the horchata ice cream w/churro. We waited not long for the hot dog, but literally waited for more than half an hr for the ice cream. The girl working the tables and serving the orders had a bit of a miscommunication that I already received my order. Knowing that it was busy, she got upset, but later apologized. 

How the food tasted: the hot dog was a 3/5 as the dog looked wayyyy bigger in other pictures. Its smaller in person, and the taste was over hyped. The bacon was too chewy and the bun made it extremely greasy rather than that OMG factor in our mouth feeling. However, the horchata ice and churro made up for the rest of our visit. Churro was hot and just freshly made. Horchata ice cream concept made me enjoy every bite as the ice cream tasted like the drink. Cinnamon, the nuts, and flavor balance out well.

Overall, will come back to try the other food when it is less busy.",pa8zvcFxnj6jFtywlxKf_g,0,0,3,DO5UDB4zB5gn3BkIduAY8w

Unlike other restaurant, the vegetarian options mirrors those from the regular menu (you have different options for hot dog toppings).

This cafe style restaurant is based off of Los Angeles' street food. In addition to hot dogs, they serve fries and tacos and fried Oreos or Twinkies. There's also alcoholic options as well. It was packed on a Sunday night (for good reason) and there were literally no available seats upon ordering. Once a seat opened up, the employee was prompt and rushed over to clean the table. 

Everyone that we interacted with, whether it was the cashier or server who brought the food, was positive and everyone was super friendly. I love the overall vibe of the restaurant.

Now the bad...the Brown Dog was super duper, like burn my tongue...salty. My hubby couldn't even eat it. I ate the dog after I scraped everything off of it and ate it alone. Then we got a Deep Fried Twinkie, the Horchata whipped cream was yummy. The Twinkie would've been yummy if it wasn't drenched in grease, we ate most of it but couldn't stand the layer of grease left in our mouths.
Price on par with all the other hot dog joints in town. I'd go back just because its close to home.

Yesterday we stopped in after my daughter's Volleyball game it was full but not annoyingly packed. I love the ambiance of this place, it very Cali-centric, with a huge graffiti mural and Pac playing in the background. But the food.. OOOHH let me tell you about the food! I had the house dog, which is their simplest of the dogs, but this thing was loaded. First off, all their dogs are wrapped in bacon, and served with sautéed onions and bell pepper. The house dog also has mayo mustard and ketchup. All the things I never knew I looveddd on a hot dog. It was really good. My only complaint- it was a little creamy with mayo and the onions and pepper being sautéed in a thousand island based sauce, next time I will do extre mustard or pickles or something to cut mayo. We shared the garlic fries which were extra garlic-y, which I loved. Skip these if you don't want to breath fire well after your meal. Hubby got a Dirty Chili Dog which looks amazing. Daughter got the Dirty Esquite, which is just Elotes in a cup, son got the mini corn dog kids meal. Which came with 2 Oreos and a cinnamon cream dipping sauce. Somewhere along the way, he decided the cinnamon cream was actually for his French fries.. . Great little lunch or dinner spot.

I had a vegetarian dog with a mixture of the green and red sauce with the lobster roll all the recommendation of the employee who was very helpful. YUM! The red sauce is pretty spicy and I like spice! 

*disclamer for vegetarians, they make the veggie ones as ordered so it may take a while for yours.  Give the register guy a heads up if you're still looking at the menu but know for sure you're gonna get the veggie dog.  

Their house made chips are bomb. The dirty fries are delicious and the sauce that comes with the garlic fries is really tasty. 

The group before us bought all of the corn so it was a 30 minute wait for the next batch of corn to be roasted. We ended up staying long enough to get the cup of corn which was a nice (but kinda random) side dish. 

Hubbs and his mom also enjoyed their hot dogs. I forget the one that the hubby got but he said it kinda tasted like a hamburger and that the bacon bits are legit.

Cons (reason for non-five star rating)
The bun.  My fiancé and I both ordered our hot dogs with an original bun and both were a bit hard, which made it hard to bite into. When we picked up our hot dog, the bun was completely split in half, like two pieces of bread with a hot dog in-between.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that, but it made the hot dog definitely hard to eat and super messy because everything was falling apart.  I think for a hot dog place, the hot dog and bun should not disappoint.   I ended up having to use a fork and knife.   What's the fun in that !  

Pros
1.  Friendly service.  Right when we walked in we were immediately acknowledged and she asked us if we've been there before.   We told her it was our first time and she gave us a breakdown of the menu.  Definitely a plus ! 

2.  Great choice of music.  There were plenty of times when my fiancé and I said, ""man I haven't heard this song in a minute.""  Definitely old school hip hop with a combination of current music genres.   

3.  The dirty corn aka their version of the elote.  I definitely enjoyed the spices they put on it and the corn was cooked just right ! 

4.  Garlic fries, I would've preferred more garlic or salt on the actual fries, but I think it was a pro because I enjoyed the housemade garlic dip that it came with.

Overall, great first experience and I would like to come back to try other items on the menu and perhaps the hot dogs are better on the lobster roll versus an original.  I'll be sure to keep you updated !",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,5,3,4,Rvw4mtsEq-NgeJxDhwsgHg

This coming to Vegas was a much needed addition. Have tried the Dirty Chili Dog, the House Dog and the Elote Dog and recommend the Hose Dog and the Elote Dog. The Dirty Chili Dog is good, had it on the Portuguese Roll, but I only slightly prefer Carney's or Pink's over it. The House and Elote dogs were great on the lobster roll.  Sauces, add ons, and condiments were a perfect match on both of these if ordered as is. Would suggest either of these as your first dog here on the lobster roll. The sweet Portuguese roll doesn't seem to work for me and may be why I wasn't sold on the chili dog on my first visit.

If a more traditional dog is your style, they are happy to accommodate for the picky eaters and kids.

*2Pac How Do You Want It playing in the background*

Today, National Hot Dog Day, is the second time coming here. To my surprise, Dirt Dog had no idea (cmon DD, market this day and fill up these empty seats!!!).  

I love this place with a passion.  I have never experienced hot dogs prepared in this way before. They offer other ala cart items including Deep-Fried Twinkies, Dirty Corn, and assortment of fries. They offer alcohol if you wish. If you are looking for the ultimate comfort food, this is one of several places I recommend. 

The restaurant is clean and tidy, you can tell that the owners spent extra time to the details in their craft.  From the wood flooring, brick wall design, artwork, and bar feel, I can see a diamond on the rough with this developing Rainbow area, and I hope that this restaurant grows. 

Pros: quality Nathan's hot dogs, tasty food and flavor, quick customer service

Cons: not much customers even during lunch hour 

This time next year, I expect a dancing Dirt Dog mascot, a live DJ, and bustling restaurant filled with hot dog enthusiasts willing to increase their cholesterol for one day.

""The House Dog"" is a bacon wrapped all beef hot dog with thousand island, onion, bell peppers, green chili spread, ketchup and mustard. I was a little skeptical of the ketchup and mustard, but it works. Absolutely delicious!!!

""Carne Asada Fries"" is not to be passed up either. Yummy deliciousness in this brown little box. I couldn't wait to dive into the box and started eating them on the drive back to work. Pick de Gallo, crema, green onion, Carne Asada and fries. Maybe there was more to it. But this was soooo good!!

""Dirty Esquite"" was just okay. Cup of corn, crema, cotija cheese, bacon, chili spices, cilantro and lime. I tasted some other flavors too.. but was overwhelmed by the saltiness. I'm going to have to pass on this one next time.

""Dirty Corn"" .. the corn of my dream!!! Honestly, this dream will have to wait. I was so full from the other food that I couldn't stomach anymore! 

""Churro"" .. this one totally had promise! Fried choux pastry with cinnamon and sugar.. and don't skimp on the horchata whipped cream dippers thing. I took a bite and realized it was raw in the middle.

A tiny little basket of fries over sauced to soggyness were decent nothing too over exaggerate about. All of this for about $20. Way to overpriced for a hotdog and fries joint.

L.A. loved and Vegas presented, Dirt Dog has spread its wings from The City of Angels and crash-landed in Sin City.  So hot!

We had just arrived in Vegas, buzzed and hungry, well past noon.  Southwest Airlines had a retiring pilot who ended up buying drinks for all the passengers on board in celebration of his retirement.  I guess when the pilot is buying, the flight attendants gets liberal with the booze because I needed food in me like 30-minutes ago.  After flipping through some bookmarks, Dirt Dog was chosen.  You know it hit the spot because we got dirty... so sooo dirty!

We got the Elote Dog on Texas toast [$7.25 + $0.50 for the lobster roll], a Dirty Chili Dog on Portuguese bun [$7.25], and one order of the Filthy Fries [$5.50].  That Texas toast was so buttery and crispy, it was hard trying not to moan with every bite.  If you love Mexican street corn, elote is for you.  The Dirty Chili Dog was a sodium bomb.  The Portuguese bun is slightly sweet so it helped off-set the saltiness a little bit.  Of the two dogs, I'd choose the Elote Dog over and over again.  As for the fries, they were amazing.  The Filthy Fries were topped with guacamole, chipotle aioli, cheddar, and cojita cheese.  I can imagine sitting back on a velvet couch with Chrissy Teigen in nothing but matching silk robes, eating these fries, while John Legend writes ballads on his piano about how awesome it is that I stole his wife.  He can keep Luna though.  She's cute but I ain't nobody's step-mom, okay?

So a place with 90's hip hop? Uh, yes please!  The staff is charismatic and friendly, the atmosphere is fun, and the food is great.

Let me tell you what I was expecting, and then I'll share with you what I actually experienced. I was sort of expecting a grittier, younger version of Pinks hot dogs. I mean, they both originate in LA, they're hot dogs, kinda trendy hang out type spots, and each one has made a home in Vegas. 
The Yelp reviews were good, pictures solid, menu I thought ""eh, not very extensive"" when compared to the OG Pink's. 
When I arrived, I thought the vibe was great. Board games, a game on TV, west coast rap over the speakers. I ordered an Elote dog, the person I was with ordered a chili dog. 
We had to wait 20 min, but didn't have anything better to do, so we happily sat around. 
When we got our dogs, the first thing I noticed (and did NOT expect as a first timer) was that the dogs are enveloped in a Texas toast/hot dog bun hybrid. 
Two of the thickest, most buttery, fresh and slightly toasted slices of Texas toast, but welded together towards the bottom to create this masterpiece of ingenuity. 
The Hot dog by the way (it's a hot dog place, afterall) was INSANE. Way better than what we're getting at Pinks. Guaranteed. 
The toppings on the Elote Dog. That's really a site and taste to behold. The perfect balance. 
As I was eating my dog...... I was already deciding which other menu item I would get to next.

I got the ranchero dog and it came with beans tortilla chips, a red sauce and a fried egg. It was definitely messy but in a very good way. The red sauce had a little kick to it that really balanced everything out. My one complaint is that I really couldn't taste the beans. I think if I could have it would have been the perfect hot dog.

My husband and I were searching for a place to eat for dinner on a Friday night, and we came across Dirt Dog online. It was 12 miles from us, but the reviews were overwhelmingly positive and it had been a while since we'd had a good hot dog; so we made the drive across town. We walked in around 7 PM, and the line was nearly out the door. We thought about coming back another time, but we had already driven all the way across town, so we stayed. And thank the good lord above that we did. The line moved much faster than we expected; and once we ordered, they had our food at our table in approximately 6 minutes - which was astounding, considering how busy they were. 

We ordered two hot dogs, an order of dirty fries, and a churro with HORCHATA WHIPPED CREAM *screams internally*. This only set us back $23 (not bad for a Friday night dinner, in my humble opinion). Their Portuguese bread is perfectly sweet, and pairs wonderfully with the sweet corn and lime mayo on the Enote Dog; and the lobster bread (more buttery, and $0.50 more) was also very delicious and tasted splendid with the House Dog. 

Needless to say we devoured our food - every bite of which was absolutely incredible. We will most certainly be coming back. A 12 mile drive is a small price to pay for one of the best hot dogs in the city.",KxSI6tQst1m6Z-QbXgcX7w,0,0,5,w-lz2g8ElzCaIsZQUkhWmA

The times I've been here it's always late at night, not many people & usually only one or two people working. No complaints besides maybe twice they didn't have what I wanted to order, likely because it was late. The place is nice inside I like the bar stools & wall paper. It makes a good display!",eZrS8SeTgX4c7ir3G1-8VQ,0,0,4,fE7qB7CJPt_wZ_MxLNpx_g

5991209,2017-11-23,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"From my experience, Dirt Dog feels like it's trying to be a modern restaurant coped with a Los Angeles ""dirty dog"" hot dog stand. Although it caters that theme by playing music that has roots in LA and incorporating art that can be found in the City of Angels, the dog does not hit the note of a true inner city street dog. Granted, the actual hot dog tasted fine (my dog was cold, my wife's was not) and the fries were spectacular, I would say I could come back to try some more.",IgMd8KHLrqZOCksJOISTvw,0,0,3,oO-pkfMYegExphCL8NyOUw

It's hip, simple and inventive with selections ranging from vegetarian hotdogs to corn on a cob. I was smitten from my first visit as I choose from different styles of hotdogs. Who knew such a simple entree can be rather complex? 

For dinner, I had torn between the brown dog or the green dog which gives me the reason to return in the future. I opted for The Brown Dog which had teriyaki sauce and sesame seed aioli. Can I just have this everyday of the week, please? The hotdog tasted juicy with noting flavors of sweet and salty. The combination between the two really hit it off as it was finished by caramelized onions. 

I also had Dirty Corn which consisted of dirty crema, cotija cheese, chili powder, cilantro and bacon bits. For me, it was a 4/5. I think they could've made it just a tad better but this didn't exactly wow me. The corn was perfectly cooked but the ingredients didn't seem to mixed well together. Something was definitely missing there. Perhaps, a flare of heat? 

My girlfriend and I also had the Dirty Chili Fries which was not bad! A bit on the salty side but I wouldn't mind getting it again. 

As for dessert, we were offered anything we wanted on the menu due to the long wait. So we chose the Horchata Ice Cream. Delicious to say the least, and if I had a choice, I wouldn't share. Sorry, girlfriend! 

The long service is what sort of puts me off from visiting again. The food is delicious but when you're ready to grub, there's no way I'm willing to wait as much as we did the first time around.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,3,2,4,SAqQh9lTD4__5tVTysp8ZQ
5996370,2017-12-14,0,q3oJ6bNRV3OoJrwc95GOwg,"Update: Went another time to try the elite dog and elite fries. Both were really good. The service was a bit slow since it was busy, but the food wasn't as salty as the first time. I still have yet to try any desserts as they run out of the ones I ask for. 

Was craving mexican corn one day and found out that this place had something similar. The service was good and the place is really nice inside. Haven't dined in yet, but I liked how they have their menu on the wall when you walk in. 

For gourmet got dogs the prices were fair. I got the house dog and the corn. The corn was a bit on the salty side for my taste. The hot dog was pretty good though. 

Next time I would like to try their desserts since they looked yummy!",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,1,4,Zk3sSbkJmBBgHG8GpZqQ-g
