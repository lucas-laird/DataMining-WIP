Great deli-style pizza, with tons of cheese and flavorful pepperoni. Despite being flung into the oven for under a minute, it was just the right temperature. Can't speak to anything else on their menu, though. 
Note that there is a credit card fee, and they do deliver.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,10,3,DYszAQ-56wIuZ2fsVXf36Q

They put ham instead of bacon. Pizza was still delicious down to the last piece of crust. We also got bbq wings and medium fingers. The wings were big and the sauce tasted delicious. They were cooked perfectly. The fingers were good. Had an order of jalepeno poppers too. Everything was tasty. I ordered from Eat24 app. Had it delivered. Food came earlier then predicted.

We called and spoke to Ana who said she would refund my money if I came back but we just want to get comp when we go back. I will update the review when we go back.

We got our free chicken fingers and fries after the bad experience. Nicole was very nice and we got the food in a timely. The fingers and fries were decent. We would go back again.",Ng_Wr-4txmsS0ucDXciGag,0,0,1,09v3zNxAAcVzDBSFwIIGLQ
4898735,2016-11-26,3,9li2xKBUybR_7JGiCwo6Gg,"I believe the cook was actually Italian, and did a really great job making my philly cheesesteak and my lady enjoyed her ""hawaiian"" pizza slice as well. 
Prices were reasonable.. My Philly cheesesteak came with fries and a drink, $6.99. Her big proportioned slice of pizza was about $4.99. 
All in all--- the food in my opinion rated 4.5 stars, no complaints there.
Our only complaint that gives this place a 2 star was the cashier lady who seemed to be the owner (from her being on the phone a few times, and stocking the drinks and such I'd assume). She didn't come off friendly right from the get-go (what do you expect ordering at a food court from a mall), but what got us was how we literally just got done ordering our food and she FORGETS to tell the cook  about my cheesesteak order.. 
I stand there for a good 2-3 minutes, while my girlfriend already had finished her slice of pizza.. 
Then deciding it's been too long so she ends up asking her about the cheesesteak to where she replies with a ""oh I forgot..."". **THAT'S NOT THE END**   After a few minutes of us waiting while she was busily on the phone, she asks my girlfriend, ""What are you waiting for?"" .. My girlfriend says, ""the cheesesteak"", and she happens to just hand it to her like it was a piece of sh**.. 
Eat here if you don't mind the attitude and possible long wait for anything else on the menu besides pizza. Good luck!",5eAYHVbAnXxhZTYM4x7UKw,0,0,2,FH2I35VGZvx4vK7kyJabXQ

5524452,2017-12-18,0,9li2xKBUybR_7JGiCwo6Gg,"Placed an order through the Yelp app.  Order was stuck on Confirming Order for 15 minutes. I called the location to confirm and the guy just kept going on and on about Eat24.  I told him I did not place it through that.  He kept saying he doesn't have a app device and can't get my order so Eat24 has to call him.  He did not ask my name or even attempt to take my order.  Completely incompetent.  Don't waste your time with this joke of a business.

Revised:  TWENTY minutes after ordering a guy from Eat24 calls to confirm my order.  He explained they serviced the Yelp orders.  I told him what happened and that I cancelled the order.  This took entirely too long for this service to call about the order.  So, 20 minutes after ordering technically the restaurant still did not have my order.  

If the owner reads this, do yourself a favor and either update to a modern device that has an app so you receive your orders or skip Yelp Ordering all together.  You lost my business.",5XxElS_QM90f7t3ap9vsag,0,0,1,eBqD8HXDRv46_H8i6OxiUg
