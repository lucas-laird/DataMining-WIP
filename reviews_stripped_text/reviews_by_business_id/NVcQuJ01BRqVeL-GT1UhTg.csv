219841,2017-04-18,0,NVcQuJ01BRqVeL-GT1UhTg,This place is horrible the women can barely understand English and then they said 25 minutes for delivery it been an hour and a half I had to call to ask where my stuff was they didn't call me. I have ordered before online here and they never delivery I called said they never got an online order from me. Maybe you should hire a staff who can do their job and call a customer back and let them know there are delays.,HQ-IlQxLEqlDhfqEcy-a8w,0,0,1,T_QavYNqIXsCef0WJ85kcA

This Port of Subs is great. I always joked with my co-workers about coming here because it's right across the street from the Spearmint Rhino, and one of my co-workers claims he has never been, or knows where it is. 

In any case, when it came time to visit this Port of Subs, he was too busy, so he gave my other co-worker and I his order.

The sandwiches are spot on here. All the meats and cheeses are freshly sliced, and the bread is hand sliced all the way through. 

They have this mustard/mayo combination that I absolutely love.

Great place for a sandwich.",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,3,1,4,PMdzTxZ9mNVQblUqzcBynQ

2231252,2015-11-30,0,NVcQuJ01BRqVeL-GT1UhTg,Service was absolutely terrible. Dirty looks every time I asked for somthing. The girl taking our order asked probably 5 times what our order was. I felt like I was NOT welcome in this store. The onions were old the lettuce was old bread was old. Skimped on everything. These people working in here could literally not care less. Asked for new onions said that's all they had. Was about ready to just walk out. For some reason didn't I didn't want to be rude but what would it matter to these people anyway,UyDZPWJXWQAXleDWfBJ7ZQ,1,0,1,3sZT3Uu8qaaQRS40g8xL7A

3154918,2016-03-01,0,NVcQuJ01BRqVeL-GT1UhTg,I ordered at 11:00 and didn't get my sandwich and macaroni salad until 12:50 the lady i called was really nice and called the driver within the 2 minutes of calling her the driver showed up so i don't think i was the restaurants  fault but the driver's . The store was only 1.1 mile away from my house so i really don't think traffic was a reasonable excuse. It was a Tuesday afternoon,dxCnhKFujYkH_Dstr1cpeg,0,0,3,NSHHOtjm6JJwhR_AaV8fMQ

It's insane and there are no other businesses in the area with restrooms so you're out of luck if you have to go.",Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g,0,0,1,tAPsu1_aR7y6mEWYdtfXfg

The ladies are nice that's not the issue for me. When you slice a dang piece of cheese so thin that it breaks and then put that on someone's sandwich like it's a full slice REALLY? And the meat too, I wanna ask them,Yo can you slice me a regular slice of meat and cheese wow let me get my moneys worth.",9KiNtZLO9Ay4s0Yt59Ompg,2,0,1,YSYIQLmaqpE9JwLespTB7w

5076014,2013-11-21,0,NVcQuJ01BRqVeL-GT1UhTg,"Only my second time having Port of Subs and I can say that I am not a fan of this location. The other location was much, much better. This one is really small and I ended up eating just the insides of my sandwich because my bread was overdone and tasted funny. Went in around lunchtime and there was a bit of a line. I don't mind the wait but don't like feeling rushed when it is my turn which is exactly how the people doing the toppings made me feel. The staff was hit or miss... two of them seemed nice and friendly and the other two didn't seem like they were having a good day. They also lack some organization and if I have to tell the person at the register what I ordered that's probably not good because I can just say I ordered the cheapest one. 

+1 for the chocolate chip cookies being delicious!",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,2,1,2,pRv9nRT_rsG1N8aMu_OMtA
