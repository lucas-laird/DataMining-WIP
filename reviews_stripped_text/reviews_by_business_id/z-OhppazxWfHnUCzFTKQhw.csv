272126,2017-09-01,0,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"It is appalling that this place feels like they have the right and excuse to bribe people to give 5-star reviews. Their none-apologetic attitude perfectly illustrates their blatant and proven disregard for the customers. It's not surprising at all. I gave this place one star for its Mango Snow since it reminds us of home. All the money spent on the decor and the tasteless ice can not take away the fact that people who work there don't know or care anything about food, service or customers. I have been there several times reluctantly for my daughter and never once felt like they even attempted at the word-service. You will actually feel better if you can order the items by punching some buttons and not have to deal with the human beings that look like you are bothering them by ordering. This is also an over priced place for the small quantity and the quality you receive. Therefore, there is never a wait, even on the hottest day. That tells you something. This business should be jamming in the summer. You can not underestimate the importance of business management and customer service. Just because you think you have a product people want doesn't mean you should neglect the most important element of your business - the customers.",GWT87dgKn0a-CQfrQ6GUlw,0,0,1,7OvZXHw6cpkFl0ZSlzOBmQ

So why 2 stars?  I didn't get any of that today.  Maybe they're having an off day, but the lady at the counter tonight all but ruined my experience this visit.  Instead of the usual coffee nirvana, I got a small plastic to go cup (didn't bother to fill to the top either).  Instead of the warm table service I was expecting, she called me behind the register across the room like I'm in a cheap Chinese take-out... no ""thank you"", no eye contact, nada.

1368038,2018-01-14,0,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"When I enter Snow White Café, I feel a nice warm environment. The place is definitely clean and spacious. It isn't busy at the time, so I have an opportunity to ask how they work. They offer specialty snow cakes which are shaved ice dessert that comes with a selection of toppings such as fresh fruits, nuts, cereal, cookies, brownies, boba, and more. In addition, they serve espresso, signature lattes, nitro cold brew, lemonade, slush, create your own tea, and they make hot lava cake, pizookie, and waffle deserts. 

I went for the Design Your Own Snow ($9.95). My order is serve in a large chilled bronze bowl with plain snow, caramelized apple, sweetened red bean, lychee jelly, green rice cake, and it's topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Also they give extra cream on the side. This dessert taste amazing. I do enjoy the velvety texture of shaved ice and I love some of the toppings recommended to me by Vianey. She is the person who gave me great suggestions on what toppings will complement nicely in my bowl. I find that the sweetened red beans and lychee jelly pair up beautifully together with plain snow. Also the caramelized apple with vanilla bean ice cream has always been a delightful treat for me. And I wouldn't mind coming back to try other items on the menu.

Now there is ONE specific topping that I most likely will not go for. It's the green rice cake, also known as green tea mochi. Personally, I don't feel that mochi goes well with shaved ice. It is hard to chew and there is an aftertaste flavor as though it has been in the freezer for a very long time.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,0,4,kn_ltrA6Wz9QZvI7kTesUg
1409430,2016-05-27,1,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"Came here on a Monday afternoon with a friend i had not seen in a while. Located between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn on Jones, it is a fairly popular area for food/drink/dessert. In the same shopping centre as the well known Q Karaoke and Icy Juicy, It is located on the northwest corner/end of the shopping centre. When I came here, parking was abundant, but from past experience, especially on a weekend, parking is much of an issue in this parking lot. 

It was occupied by only 1 table when we had came here, which soon left after we ordered (we didnt even notice they left... magic? ghost? Lol jk) 

Wide selection of beverages (that i didnt look into) and a small menu of Bingsoo (korean shaved ice dessert)

------------------------------------

Caramel Apple Bingoo ($11.95) - Homemade caramelized cinnamon apples, fresh apples, toasted pecans, ice cream

Fresh Strawberry Bingsoo ($10.95) - Homemade marinated strawberries, fresh strawberries, strawberry ice cream

Sweet Mango Bingsoo ($10.95) - Mango chunks, mango ice cream

Chocolate Brownie Bingsoo ($10.95) - Brownie chunks, french cocoa powder, chocolate swirl wafers, coconut flakes, chocolate ice cream

Roasted Soybean Bingsoo ($9.95) - Roasted soybean powder, sweetened red bean, sliced almonds, rice cake, vanilla ice cream

Redbean Bingsoo ($8.95) - Sweetened red bean, petite rice cakes, vanilla ice cream

Crunch Oreo Bingsoo ($8.95) - Oreo crumbs, vanilla ice cream

------------------------------------

Because i had recently came back from my trip to Korea, i have been craving for some korean bingsoo (specifically Sulbing). In korea at Sulbing, the roasted soybean bingsoo was their ""traditional version"". I remember recongizing the soybean powder from the korean drama series, The Heirs, and always wanted to try it. Lol (SHHH) 

We had picked the roasted soybean bingsoo to try. Apparently there was a pick up window but had not realized. One of the workers there had brought it to our table. Oops? XD Good service at least? Lol 

As mentioned previously, shaved ice topped with sweetened red bean, sliced almonds, rice cake, roasted soybean powder, and VANILLA? ice cream. Reason why i said VANILLA? was because it was definitely not the traditional vanilla. Though i couldn't really tell what flavor it was, it was a slight brownish color. I'd almost call it borderline soybean powder ice cream. Lol It was delicious at least? Rice cake was soft and chewy. Sweetened red bean was not mushy but fairly firm to the bite, which was surprising and nice. Oh, also a small pouring cup of condensed milk which was fun to drizzle over everything. Hehe :P Whats nice is its not just a pile of ice, but like a small pile, some powder, then more ice. Attention to detail right? Lol 

Unfortunately, unlike Sulbing in korea, the shaved ice was not shaved milk. :( sad face. Overall, it was still very tasty and would love to come and try the other ones! Mango and strawberry looks delicious. Hopefully the place will last and be more known. Noticed the hours, it doesnt open that late. Might be a bad thing but if their product is good, they'll still get the business (hopefully).",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,4,4,ZJM6OCgUF4SB0GghEUuudw

Usually there are tables we can push together to make a larger table for our fairly large groups. I'm sure they're usually busier at night so a large group would probably not be ideal, but you could probably hang out outside if anything. Most of their drinks and desserts can easily be taken to go.

I've had their green tea snow, and I have mixed reviews for it. The first time, the matcha or something was extremely bitter, and no matter how much of the condensed milk we put on it, it was still bitter. Bad first experience. But today, I had it again, and it tasted way better! Much more subtle, and not too sweet at all.

I've also had the lychee iced tea, which was... okay. From the overall consensus of my church people, it seems like most of the drinks seem pretty good. I think the cold brew is what they're known for, but I can't attest to it, since I've never personally tried it.",COO0J8CcfhU3SWPxqOBnPA,0,0,4,ZtSTe9t3NJY94dGZdjCZ8Q

Snow White is one of a growing number of local spots to use Stumptown coffee. They offer the brew every way you can imagine, from affogato to cold brew and even the nitro cold brew (holy caffeine overload!). Selection of flavored lattes includes options like rose (subtle but sweet!), matcha (non-espresso!), and they also offer a bunch of teas. Have yet to try the desserts, but portions are huge for sharing.

The decor is perfect- shades of white and grey on the walls, tables, and floor give subtle nod to the name, along with cute decorative touches. Lee is as sweet as the namesake princess, ask her for recommendations when you go!

My friend and I ordered a small strawberry ice and a lavender white latte to share since we were both still full. Before ordering the lavender White we were both curious to see what was the difference between the lavender white latte and lavender white mocha. We asked the person ringing us up however he couldn't tell us the difference because he was pretty clueless himself.
UM WHAT ? How do you not know your menu and you work there? 
The ice arrived super fast however they got our latte wrong. Instead of the lavender they made us a vanilla latte but since we weren't picky we decided to go with the vanilla. The worker said she could add lavender syrup to the coffee so we just went with that option.

The ice was unflavored and the topping was way too sweet for me ( strawberry jam). However it balanced nicely with the unflavored ice but I much rather preferred actual strawberry flavored ice.
Latte was disappointing, we barely tasted the lavender flavoring.

Overall I didn't have high hopes for this place and I'm glad I didn't or else I would be so disappointed. Perhaps I'll come here again if I really want unflavored ice.",B7e7gS9fPqKJ0o8hhhwG8Q,3,2,3,9t_N00axTHngRSwCcDUU7w

I was glad they had a small shaved snow option ($6) because we were all full from lunch. The small portion is a decent size. I think I would normally get a small portion. There's also a large portion that costs $10. If you want to customize your shaved snow, you have to order the large. 

I ordered the green tea while my friends ordered the tiramisu and the chocolate brownie. I really liked the red bean and the almond pieces on the green tea. I was actually really excited about the rice cake topping. I think the rice cake was covered in soy powder, and that made the rice cake really salty. That was jarring, and it didn't mesh well with the dessert. The shaved snow isn't really sweet, and the rice cake is too salty in comparison. The shaved snow itself was very light and airy. It actually resembles the texture of real snow.

I prefer my shaved ice to be creamier (similar to ice cream) and sweeter (where's the condense milk?), which makes me less likely to come here. On the otherhand, if you like your dessert to be less sweet and airy, Snow White is the place for you (my friends reaaaaalIy liked this place).",Md4Yb113ykjPasmWeg6r_A,1,0,3,-nmMyOTiCKDbpC1m97CKfQ

It not only the way they cut the ice but the presentation is truly artwork. Not only from eye appeal, details (the  bowl they serve the ice is chilled chilled) from the bowl served in, the tray, the sauce that pour over the top, and kind of scared break it all down. Not just the food I really like the interior got the whole snow white concept going on with the mirror, and the vibe of the place very laid back very chill spot. 

It was my first time but thankfully came with Suzy H not her first time. So explained me the way it all works. The size got the large bowl, It might look like lot recommended for two. You really could eat the whole thing. It only ice. Lol. The green tea ice cream on top!! Unreal good! I  could have had whole bowl of it. Then you add the shave ice then topped with some adzuki beans reminded me pounding mochi on new years and filled some with adzuki beans. Onolicous!!! The mochi rectangle or pieces around the top perfect compliment. If fan of all things green tea this bowl brings out the best and the color is green green more green. I really look forward trying more of the shaved ice. 

I also notice Lychee smoothie on the menu. Different or never had smoothie that flavor. I was impressed. It had nice strong fresh lychee flavor, nice blended slushy like smoothie, and not over sweet.

The girl who helped us wasn't actually listening to our questions and was looking at her phone while we looked at the menu. We asked what she thought about the tiramisu flavor and she instead went on to list the most popular toppings. What? It happened again when I asked whether my face had to be in the picture in order to get the free tea they were offering with the Yelp review. I didn't even bother doing it because I never got a straight answer. Something about how they check ID? And in that case, why do I need to have my face in the Yelp review? Idk. 

We got the large snow with strawberries, mangoes, and vanilla ice cream. It came with a side of condensed milk. I felt as though $10 was pretty pricey for just fruits, syrup, and snow with one ice cream scoop. The fruits were on the sour side too, with the mangoes being chewy (not ripe) rather than soft. We were told that the small size doesn't come with ice cream, but you could add it for $2. Again, really pricey imo for a single scoop of ice cream if you decide to get a small, since the small is $6 and after ice cream it's $8, so you might as well buy a large anyway. 

Presentation was nice but I honestly wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Snow is just meh and you can get Stumptown coffee at Whole Foods.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,1,1,2,wguOYz_Zp-DGthVuPggmTw
2420457,2017-05-14,1,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"EDIT: almost immediately after posting the owners addressed the issue and offered a free drink to try and compensate. I tried the matcha latte a little less sweet. They said it's a little difficult to alter the sweetness due to the powder being already pre-sweetened but would try making it with a little less powder.

The second drink was not bad, a lot better than my original, still slightly a little sweet but much better.
They said they would note the previous mentions in my first review. Although the sweetness was still a little more than I usually prefer, the service in addressing the issue makes up for it a lot.

Service is 80% of a business success imo, and the readdress was very much appreciated and gave me a change of heart.

They also gave us free ice cream as well, it really shows they care about their business and satisfaction for their customers.

**********************

You can taste heart, and my drink is as heart less as Kanye west to paparazzi.

I got the mint mojito, a favorite of mine but I just felt extremely disappointed.
First things first, I really dislike when people give you 3/4 ice in a coffee drink. Number one, it dilutes the drink, and number two it's just plain cheap.

The mint mojito here at Snow White is just mint pieces tossed in ice and plain watered down coffee.
The premature coffee beans made the brew taste super sour when I wanted an earthy and fruity sweet minty freshness. The mint was practically absent and chopped into large pieces.

If they had muddled the mint more instead of quickly a few careless chops, the mint flavor would be more present and complimentary. Also please please use coffee beans that aren't prematurely picked!!! I can't stand sour coffee, like unbearably sour coffee. I can handle lemons but this was just plain depressing.

Also maybe a little cream or half and half or anything would be nice, even if they could just put it over on the counter so I could pour it in self serve style would be nice. The only option I had available though was 4 options of sugar. I didn't even see napkins on the side counter, it felt like a waste of space.

The only redeeming quality though was the clean and tastefully themed Alice in wonder land theme, +1 star.
I may considering changing my review if I can find a redeeming drink, but this is the second time their item had disappointed me.

I just don't ever see myself saying ""hey let's get Snow White you guys!"" Which presents my 2 star rating.
Also lately, it would be nice to have a warm welcome in the cafe. They weren't rude but more like.. how should I say? ..uninterested.

No, ""hello"" or ""welcome.."" just ""what do you want to order?""

Uhh okay, straight to the point I guess. But still it also made me not want to ask for any recommendations for fear their suggestion might be as cold as their greeting. Maybe next time I come by again i'll see if they've improved any and change my review, but for now. It's a 2 of 5 for me.

I got a brownie sundae dish and really enjoyed it. The shaved ice was drizzled with sweetened condensed milk, dusted with cocoa powder and then topped with brownie pieces and cookies. The milk and cocoa powder made the shaved ice taste just like chocolate ice cream. The brownies tasted fresh and the cookies added a good crunch. I was very happy.

2596171,2017-09-05,3,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"The snow cakes are a perfect dessert if you're ever in the mood for something sweet. The snow cakes have a fluffy texture between shaved ice and shaved snow. It's soft and melts in your mouth. It's sweet and you can add your own toppings such as fruit syrup, fruits, and cereal. You can also add a scoop of ice cream if you decide to order the large size.

The prices are a bit more expensive than Snowflake. A small snow cake costs $5.95 and a large costs $9.95. For this price you can get a large size at Snowflake. The only difference is you will get shaved snow at Snowflake and here at Snow White Cafe you get ""bingsu"" (Korean shaved ice with condensed milk mixed in). There is a slight difference between the two, but you can always add condensed milk to your shaved snow as a topping and you essentially have the same thing.

Parking can be difficult especially if you're coming at peak hours because it's located in the same plaza as District One and the karaoke bar.

3114612,2017-02-04,1,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"I absolutely love this cafe! I'm so excited to be writing this review because of my visit here with my siblings. We were supposed to try a new dessert place after having dinner at the Chinatown Plaza, but that particular establishment only accepted cash. Not a good way to start earning business if you've just opened up. So, my siblings suggested going to Snow White Cafe. Plus, it was very close to where we were.

I'm glad they mentioned it! I really enjoyed their Tiramisu Snowflake dessert (Bingsoo), as well as the Oreo one. Both were not too sweet and had a great mix of light, sugary flavors. Especially the Tiramisu! I could have eaten the large one all by myself. That's how much I enjoyed it! Good till the last bite. They offer it in a small or large size, and you can even build your own bingsoo.

As for the drinks, my sis ordered a Taro Milk Tea with boba. She said it was really good and the boba was really soft. One of the girls working behind the counter said she added extra, since it was near closing time. So nice! I didn't get a drink, but I'm saving it for when I come back. :]

The decor and space of this establishment sets it apart from other small time cafes that I've been to. They have plenty of tables and chairs, and the decor throughout the entire place gives it a charming, clean look. There is also one seating area, towards the back, that is separated by a wall. This is where they keep a longer table, which is perfect for a big group of people. Plus, it's a more secluded spot. 

This business sits at the very corner of the Mountain View Plaza. Can't miss it. However, parking can be a problem when coming here at night or on the weekends. This plaza can get very busy, since many of the eateries around the area are open really late.

For sure, I will be a regular here. You might catch me chillin at this place when I'm on one of my dessert runs! lol Just wish they open a lil bit later for us night owls. :]",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,7,3,5,svLZ1JEOqgpZHuim7LrO7w

3700704,2017-09-13,0,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"Snow White is a 3-star cafe to me. I can list many pros about Snow White. However, I can list many cons too...

PROS: Snow White is a relatively spacious cafe that you can go to relax because they usually play some calming music. Though it is located in one of the most crowed malls in the area, Snow White stays pretty calm. Their shaved ice milk dessert is sooo good. I can finish the large bowl by myself. :D The interior is better than other cafes too. 

CONS: The other menu items are just too plain. Whenever I order their drinks, they taste like they were watered down. Also, they did not have enough employee to accommodate the customers. People had to wait in line for a long time to order and wait again to get what they have ordered. I think they should adjust their business hours too. I wish they extend their hours. 

Snow White is a great cafe to study and relax. It will be a much better place to visit if they can fix their drinks.",vsZy481c3AVrl1ht-qwMuA,0,0,3,qTkdOXUC-VKywBYdYULQTg

The fresh strawberries and jam was just right with the condensed milk when mixed with the snow like shave ice.

So for the food review. At first I was going in expecting shaved ice, like the ones I get in Hawaii. But this is way more sophisticated. It's a much finer shaved ice, it's more like eating fresh powder snow. They put it in a metal bowl to keep it cold, and it's flavored with whatever toppings you choose. So it's like a shaved ice sundae. It's so yummy and they give a good amount to share for two. If you like sweet desserts like I do, add the ice cream in there and the optional condensed milk. You won't be sorry lol

4107162,2016-07-28,6,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"I went for their shaved ice and I've heard about their coffees, but nobody told me about their teas. If the first impression wasn't a fluke, then their tea is also something to wax poetic about.

Snow White is a fairly new cafe and dessert shop at the corner of the busy plaza on Jones that contains stalwart restaurants such as District One, Chada Thai & WIne, (the original), and Asian BBQ & Noodles. That alone would guarantee them success if they were merely mediocre, but they're an excellent establishment.

The variant of shaved ice offered here is patbingsu (aka bingsoo, or spelling variants of those terms), a Korean style with toppings layered atop a bed of ice. It is distinct from the Taiwanese style (exemplified by Snowflake Shavery) where flavor is frozen into the milky ice, and the Hawaiian shave ice where syrups are applied. I ended up sharing a large ($9.95) mango ""snow dessert"" with my friend.

Not too long after our order (considering customers ahead in line), the ice arrived on a huge metal bowl with flared sides. I dug in to the much anticipated treat and found myself really enjoying it. The ice is shaved very finely, not like my favorite ribbony Taiwanese style or the coarser Hawaiian shave ice. The amount of mango with mango jelly on top of it was a lot more generous than I'd expected, and it was sweet but not overly so. The vanilla ice cream added a bit of creaminess to the bites more than anything, as did the condensed milk. I wasn't expecting much from something built atop unflavored ice, but it was surprisingly splendid.

With that out of the way, I've gotta talk about their tea. It was a tad late at night to try their coffee (which uses Stumptown beans and includes cold brew and nitro brew), but I was willing to take a smaller caffeine hit from one of their teas. Turns out that they do the same teas, flavored teas, and milk teas as everywhere else. Well, sorta. The jasmine tea ($3.75 for 24 oz) is the strongest jasmine tea that I've had in almost any of this sort of tea shop. It was sweetened to the perfect level as well. The sea salt cream (+$0.75) reminds me of another establishment not in town (perhaps Sharetea), and it's smooth and provides just the right saltiness that I've come to expect from that ingredient.

I decided to make one more visit a couple days afterward because I needed to see the quality of the boba ($0.50). The new shops have set a high bar for quality tapioca pearls. While this Snow White doesn't offer honey boba, their boba is close to the right texture, veering just a tad into ""hard"" territory. The drink that I tried this time, the toffee nut milk tea ($4.75 for 24 oz), was pretty good for a typical milk tea and not overly sweet. But moving forward, I'll probably stick to loose leaf teas like the jasmine for that powerful tea flavor.

The (men's) restroom was quite clean, so I have to credit their clean customers and their custodial care. And I really appreciate that they gave me a to-go cup when I couldn't handily down my drink after mistakenly not specifying to-go.

Based on what I've had so far, Snow White is really an awesome new business with a different take on shaved ice and some very competitive tea offerings. I'll be back soon to try their other bingsoo flavors and their coffee.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,9,5,-1ev1k0zAR5WyKRBCdfbYQ

""Review us on...yelp"". ""Show us your 5 star review and receive  a FREE 12oz Black/Green Tea with Sea Salt Cream""

""Snow White"" is the most popular Korean shave ice spot on Yelp in the Las Vegas area.  The fact that they rely on a system of bribing to obtain their ratings instead of relying on the quality of their products is dishonest and unprofessional. 

As a result, the Soybean Shaved Ice was no where near the quality expected of ""the best Shaved Ice/"" in Vegas. 

The condensed milk was watered down and runny
The ice cream was Kirkland Signature Classic Vanilla (which is good, but not what I go out to eat for)
The Korean rice cake () was lumpy, uncharacteristically large and sparse. For the Large we ordered (for four people) we each got to eat one piece...

All in all, it was a cool and refreshing retreat from a 110 degree Vegas afternoon, which in turn may have made frozen treat taste better than it is.

Blood orange lemonade was a bit too sweet for my taste. I will stick to my matcha lattes/frappes here instead until I figure out something new that I like. 

Bingsoos that i've tried so far: matcha, brownie, and watermelon/mango. The brownie one is good if you are a fan of chocolate indulgence. The matcha isnt overtly bitter however they add candy to it which makes it a little more sweeter than it should be. Watermelon/mango is seasonal only - its refreshing and fruity. The one thing that i liked in common with all the bingsoos is how their shaved ice had the appearance of actual snow, thus melts into your mouth like actually tasting a snowflake that falls onto your tongue lol! Although I honestly would come here more towards the spring as the vegas heat strangely melts the ice a lot faster... Either that or time went by way to fast while conversing with friends for me to notice haha.

The first few weeks this place opened though, it was nice being greeted by one of their overzealous employees. I forgot his name but he was very convivial and would wander to our table full of friends to engage in random conversation when the opportunity strikes haha! I liked that his unique sense of customer service wasn't robotic at all but moreso ethusiastic. Having a flamboyant personality definitely did help with the overall guest experience as well.

The shop's interior was lovely, but that's only because I'm biased with anything white marble. They had small accents and trinkets that emphasized on the Disney character Snow White which had a unique and surreal touch of ambiance. I do like the idea of this place and can imagine myself coming through randomly for a sweet craving with random conversation; I only wish that they extended their hours more (hint hint 2am please) as it would be a decent alternative to Icy Juicy since its in the same plaza.",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,3,3,4,RL7i0B-F9HqqMExJz7FyVg

2nd visit we tried the Mango Snowflake. It was so ""creamy"" and had a mild & mellow (non-acidic) taste and the  mango was fresh! Organic too! 
I will be definitely be coming back to try their other desserts and drinks!

The BF loves coffee and hates sugar. I love sugar and hate coffee. He yelped cold brew coffee, and I told him I'd order whatever I could find there bc I was not about to make multiple stops. So pleasantly surprised to find Snow White offers both coffee AND boba. While neither the cold brew nor the boba was 5-star worthy, both were decently good and exceeded expectations.

Did I just  seriously pay $8.65 for one small cup of shaved ice with nothing except chopped strawberries which I had to pay $1.00 extra for.  Even when I didn't have other stuff in it.  Plus they put it in a dinky Styrofoam cup.  Meanwhile I see everyone with the nice clay bowls.  Damn I must be a degenerate to deserve  this.  I am NOT giving this a one star because it would be unfair and the shaved ice is pretty good.  The place was clean.  But the price is crazy.  So we came in here after eating at the Asian BBQ next door because they do not have anything sweet.  I immediately Yelp to search for a spot and magically this Snow White hipster café appeared.  YES! So the lady in the counter (the receipt served by Man) was not really excited to see us.  I explained to her that my father-in-law was diabetic and I asked what do they have that's not too sweet or what can they offer.  She looks at me and says ""coffee"".  HA! I said to myself if I wanted coffee I would go to Starbucks.  I stayed calm and we tried to figure it out.  So at the end of it all I asked for the strawberry shaved ice.  She told me my total and I wasn't paying attention at first until I checked my receipt.  I didn't want to be rude thinking maybe the shaved dessert would be bomb and they would hook it up.  Uhm... No.  It's literally 4 strawberries chopped up and shaved ice.  I shouldn't have even tipped if this was the case.  This is nuts.  I recommend this to people who want to try it.  It's nice and warm inside.  It has a cool rustic feel and it's cute.  But I didn't have a good experience.  Upon leaving I even smiled and the counter lady didn't bother saying goodbye or thank you.  I am not coming back here.  I am not paying $7 for shaved ice.  The shaved ice was still good.  The place is still nice.  This was just from a bad experience.  Next time I'll just stick to boba and  call it a day.  If I want shaved ice I'll just get it from my refrigerator and throw in some strawberries and ice cream.

Although less aesthetically pleasing, the small shaved ice goes in a white paper cup but she still makes it very pretty. We got mango strawberry shaved ice and a tiramisu shaved ice, both were really good and the tiramisu was so pretty.

I like this whimsical window frames on the ceiling and there are little details in the store to make this place fairy tale like. I had the tiramisu shaved ice and the Oreo shaved ice. The tiramisu was better than the Oreo because it had cream in the cup and a side of espresso to pour over the ice. I felt that the added liquids made the ice more creamy.  The Oreo was ok. It was chewing on cold  marshmallows and cookie bits, but at least it matches the flavor description. 

It is worth noting that the shaved snow has a  fine fluffy texture so there is a lot of air in between the parts. So, no, it's not like shaved ice where the particles are densely packed together. It is much fluffier and less filling. I would recommend trying this place out as it is a unique dessert experience if you have not had snow dessert before.

The only way to describe the texture is like fresh powder just dropped on the slopes...it's not like a snowcone, or like fluff ice or even ice cream..it's much much lighter...literally like snow...hence the name!

Basically, it's cream snow shaved into a cup and you pick ur toppings or choose from their  menu of pre-selected flavors.

The BAD:
Not knowing or being in the place before was looking for pictures or something to get the taste buds going...but no luck...the menus and selections are easy to read...but hard to grasp the concept if you've never had it before...you gotta just pick one of their flavors and dive into it.

The snow: I've had snow many different ways and normally the snow (or finely shaved ice) is also flavored. What's unique about this place is that the snow is not flavored. They just pack it with a lot of different things. I'm not sure if anyone is familiar with what halo-halo is but it's the same except the ice is shaved very finely! It was amazing though! I really love the mango one because it isn't too sweet! I think that with the other flavored added on it might have been too sweet. I really enjoy the snow here! I love the fruit ones and next time o lab on having the Oreo one! 

The coffee and tea: I was excited and I think the coffee is made well! However when I ask questions about the drink I would like them to be knowledgable of the type of tea...or even the fact that they have sea salt cream. I feel like I knew more about tea and their menu then they did! 

The place: it is super cute and I love it! There theme is Snow White so the place is woods-y and has unique art pieces that relate to Snow White some of them are more dark and baroque and some of them are really cute! There flavor theme is caramel apple and I really enjoy that! The shop is very cutesy but not overly cutesy! It's not on a hello kitty level but it has its own unique cute-ness! 

Overall really enjoy this shop. Just wish that the flavored were not as artificial for the floral flavors and that the baristas were well versed in there products.",6KHEBDYDXGcsyIgYVAOL8A,2,2,4,Ozjs9BXYAm-H8LduErphMQ

Went here on a Sunday evening, 45 minutes before closing time and to my surprise, there were a lot of people inside. It was bad enough that there was only one person behind the counter and they have a lot of people coming in.

I couldn't give this a perfect score because they need to put more flavor into their shaved ice and not just milk shaved ice and about 5 spoonful of toppings.

5186361,2016-07-01,10,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"I've got a shocking confession.

Before coming to Snow White, I had never had anything Nutella-related. Not spread, not bread -- no cookie nor pastry. Luckily, I've got awesome Yelp friends, and Stefany V. took the time to make the UYE that introduced me to the world that is Nutella .... kinda.

I'm not a huge fan of coffee, to be honest. I normally order fraps when accompanying others to coffee houses. Today was a different day, however -- one of the first days of true Las Vegas Summers hit the day of the event, and I was already medium-rare by the time I arrived. I wanted something cold, and wanted to try something new. I ordered the Nutella Latte, and Rachel D. got the Vanilla Latte for contrast. That's exactly what we got after trying them both.

The Nutella Latte was pretty rich in coffee taste, and though you can definitely tell there's a good amount of chocolate goodness inside, it's pretty rich -- and ultimately tastes like a dark chocolate ice coffee. Pretty good, but a bit *too* rich for my taste. Still enjoyed it though, despite the Nutella being on the muted side of the flavor scale.

The Vanilla Latte was a much different story. With a creamy, sweet base that has a strong vanilla aftertaste. This was really nice, and lead me to switch with Rachel.

Service is really easy to sum up: Though at times the wait seemed to be a bit long, we realized that there was only one person working both the register and making the drinks. She was really nice, and did the very best she could and then some. I had no problem with a few extra minutes.

While the Nutella was like a dark, rich red wine, the Vanilla was like a sweet dessert white; offering a delish contrast. I highly recommend ordering both, and sharing with a pal.",9wCf_htfipOl80iljteukg,15,12,4,sAowJWOXnVa6K3uaj8Oe5g

5349137,2016-06-30,0,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"In April, I was in Seoul, Korea with my boyfriend and we discovered something phenomenal there. We discovered modern Korean shaved ice where they use milk. It was shaved milk topped with fruits and condensed milk. So it's always surprising when we find a place that holds a similar concept to that. 

I felt as though Snow White took forever to open. FOREVER. Now that I think about it, it seems like that's how it is with a lot of the establishments in Las Vegas. They take forever to open due to problems with their construction contract. Blah! 

Anyways, we talked with one of the girls in there and we found out that they pretty much are doing the same thing as Korean shaved ice where they use milk. Or at least that's what they said. The consistency is a bit rougher than what we're used to and if there is supposed to be milk in there, it's not a whole lot of it. 

We ended up ordering a strawberry bingsoo. It had shaved ice topped with strawberries with strawberry jam in between. Then they had condensed milk for you to pour onto your shaved ice. It was pretty good. It's great to be able to have some Korean shaved ice in this city that's not the usual patbingsoo. They have plenty of options -- they even have the tradition where they use the peanut powder. Most of their shaved ices are also topped with ice cream..

The only downside of it is the price. It costs about $10 average per bingsoo. But it's such a large portion that you can share it between 3-4 people so, in the end, the cost isn't that much. It may seem much if you're just coming here with a party of 2 though. 

Overall, it's pretty good. Very refreshing, especially during the summer. The bowls they use are ice cold when it's brought out to you, which is really nice! I would definitely come back and suggest people give it a try.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,1,4,8atI_9UKzLirEhjSJx412g

5918784,2016-09-28,4,z-OhppazxWfHnUCzFTKQhw,"Cute, but not so little, dessert spot on Jones (between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn Road, same plaza as District One). They serve their special ""shaved"" ice desserts, along with coffee and tea.

If you are not familiar with the plaza Snow White is located at, be warned that parking is always a problem for anyone visiting businesses in this plaza, especially at night. Carpooling is recommended if this is the after dinner dessert stop after a dinner outing with friends.

First of all Snow White did a fantastic job transforming that commercial space into a really delightful looking hanging out spot. The lighting in the evening is not too bright, which can even be considered romantic and completely suitable for extending the successful romantic dinner date at one of the many nearby restaurants.

Judging by their menu and promotional signage, their specialty is their selection of shaved ice (Bingsoo), which is prepared in a special machine which transformed a flavored liquid directly into tiny grains of ice chips that are fluffy, which is then topped of with their signature combination of toppings or the customer can elect to Design Your Own Snow. So instead of shaving previously frozen blocks of ice or flavored ice, their unique to all of Las Vegas MAGICAL machine conjures up fluffy snow to help stave back dangerous heat-related ailments in the perilous land of fire.

It would be so cool to see this MAGICAL transfiguration in action, but the young sorceress summoning my order of Tiramisu Shaved Ice guards their MAGICAL school's secret from us plain muggles and only expends her mana in the kitchen away from curious eyes.

It's okay though, the collective knowledge of the sages of Google extends even to the magic originating from the distant realm of Pusan (where Sung Hi Lee* and Girls Generation are from).  The wizards there have discovered, after thousands of hours of deep meditation, folding thousands of perfect paper cranes and mastery of Sudoku, how to turn any room temp or colder liquids (from beers, sodas, dairy, fruit juices) into tiny ice crystals in a matter of moments. It really is living up to their philosophy of ""Be MAGICAL"".

Although I have only had their MAGIC shaved ice, I plan to be back to give their Stumptown Cold Brew and Nitro Coffee a try.

Lastly beware of giants that may be roaming about, since even mystical dwarves are said to be the size of full grown muggles in this MAGICAL outpost of The Ice Queen.

I just had the roasted soy bean shaved ice. It was really good! But the menu was kind of disappointing. I have never had to pay $11 for shaved ice before, its really expensive for frozen water and a few toppings. I highly suggest that they change their menu to be more customize-able, with having a base and choose what toppings you want, and what sauce. Their set menu is good too, but that should be the ""suggested combos"" not the only choices we have. The service was nice. The ambiance is very nice. The shaved ice was big enough to share with another person. Hopefully they add more toppings soon because I love this kind of shaved ice.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,1,2,3,wytmhgnVGbcIzk0fcPiyEA

They have  different kinds of shaved ice desserts, coffee and tea drinks. I will definitely come back here to try their snow cakes and colorful drinks.",ZDYM_SjbwuYQhjXpfja5sg,1,0,5,VBWY56rs-1NyLQ9VzpFtDw

The place was pretty much empty so we found a table right away and ordered some drinks. I ordered the watermelon slush. It was not too sweet but I was regretting not getting the lychee because that's my go to after taro. They didn't offer a taro slush which I would've gotten but the watermelon slush was still good. 

I like how their whole theme was around snow white and they had different decor around the place with snow white characters. The place isn't open as late as we usually study so that's a downside for us. 

Overall, this place was clean and offered free wifi which attracted us to the establishment in the first place. I would come here again to do more studying in the future.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,3ICuLsqec7Oi2CenOS_RGw
