I tried one chicken meatball in the mushroom gravy (yum), and one classic with a mix of the parmesan cream and basic tomato sauce.  Both good!  A two meatball combo is only $4 and came with an asiago breadstick. 

I also got the cheese flatbread, which wasn't much to speak of.  Not bad, but not good either.  Not worth changing the rating though, since the meatballs were what I came for. 

Reasonable price, tasty meatballs and that cool 100 flavor come machine.  Is recommend it and I will likely be back. There's pasta and cheddar cheese sauce which I'd love to try.",B8fBaM7y96fcntBJv-nPUA,1,0,4,UADrkZQROPULuIPUuCnMCw

I am a local, and my mother in law was visiting which brought us naturally to the strip. They stood out to us because there was not a long line and we were starving. 
I walked up to the cash register and there was a group of three sitting on the other end having what apparently was an extremely in depth and important conversation. I assumed someone would come to take my order because one girl watched me walk to the register. Not one of them asked how I was doing, what could they get for me, or if I had even been there before. Lastly, no one even said Hello. 
Myself and my mother in law decided to leave and look at other food places, and found ourselves back at the Meatball Spot and had a question on the Flat Breads.
I asked "" Are the flatbreads cheaper if they are sliced smaller?"" I also had my 3 year old son with me, which is why I asked.
She said nothing and threw a very large flatbread in the oven and proceeded to continue her conversation with her other two rude friends. I said excuse me, because I wasn't sure if she actually understood what I was asking. I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page. Their conversation continues, so I literally wave my hands back and forth like I was trying to wave down a taxi, better yet, like I was helping to land a plane ( this place is tiny like a subway, so they had to see me) . They guy in the conversation looks me in my eyes, and looks away laughing and continuing his conversation.....well as soon as the oven beeped and she took the pizza out of the oven to turn around and ask me to pay I walked away. I refused to hand my money over to people who could care less that I was there or not. 

Hopefully none of those people were a manager. That would be horrible representation.",jyp9uO9y_Jn63LkSPjKFIg,0,0,2,DrERq8FVFB3YO431NbwxNg

We went there last year when it was in Union Square.  What a cool place, & the food was incredible.  Now, it gets bought out, they get rid of the master chef & turn it into total dog food.  My only regret besides trying this was that I didn't take a picture of the meatballs in the water.  Such a disappointment, & the sauces didn't taste fresh at all.

Anyhow, it's a stand located in the shopping area of PH. You can make Meatball subs, sliders, pasta, or just eat it from a cup. They serve bread sticks, salads, and even pizza. There are four types of meatballs they serve: Classic (beef, chicken and veal?); Pork; Chicken; and Turkey. You can choose the type of sauce you want over your meatballs.

I went with the Turkey and tomato sauce with my slider. It was pretty tasty. didn't have much of an appetite so one slider was enough for me. Give it a try.",xEfWrET-mCCeoN4dSOLwNQ,3,1,4,FofChBrvqUtvyPwauMyPbA

I recommend the classic meatballs with half meat sauce, half spicy marinara. I am so glad the guy offered this as I was torn! Both very good! I am not much of a cheese person but the option to add mozzarella was just too tempting so we did this and yum! (add $1 for cheese)
The meatball itself was very tender and there are also healthier options like turkey, many combinations with the sauces and cheeses.

One of their methods of serving balls are cup combos - choose either 2, 3 or 4 balls in a cup with sauce and a breadstick.  They have FOUR kinds of meatballs and a bunch sauces to choose from.  I got original balls and turkey balls and had chose the spicy meat sauce.  It was amazing.  Both kinds of balls were tender, flavorful and had great texture.  The spicy meat sauce lived up to its description.  The spice level was probably one step past italian going toward mexican.  The breadstick was quality too.  

Meatballs can also be served as sliders or a full sub.  They also feature flatbread pizza and a couple other sandwich options but......the focus is balls.

It seemed expensive and I figured it would be a small sandwich.  It was actually just right.  I got the classic meatballs and these are no tiny little Spaghetti-O's style meatballs.  These are balls with substance.  They tasted fresh and were quite juicy.  So often I get a meatball sandwich that tastes old and microwaved.  Not here.

Keeping it classic, I ordered classic sauce too.  It looked thin but was by no means watered down.  This was a full flavor marinara that was even a little bit spicy.  A very good compliment to the meatballs.

The bread of my sandwich was fine.  Nothing spectacular.  It was there mostly to catch the sauce.  It executed this task with some competancy but I still went through several napkins because of the dripping sauce.

This was a good sandwich.  My only complaint was the $1 price tag to add cheese.  I skipped the cheese for that reason.  I'm sorry but I think a meatball should come with cheese included.  Subway has jaded me.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,2,4,KXFzMpQiMQdkAiSeFVNG6Q

We first visited this spot when they had a restaurant in Town Square and thought it was okay. Saturday we decided to give them another try at this location and see if our feelings had changed about the food.

We went with meatball sliders, one traditional and one pork. The sauce was spicy Italian sauce. First, the slider rolls are just not hardy enough for the large meatball and the sauce. The buns were mush instantly and that wasn't the most appetizing. The meatball wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The meatballs have zero in the way of seasoning. They are essentially a giant hunk of meat (which usually is a good thing), but meatballs should be seasoned! Forgive me, I'm Italian so this seems like a sin against meatballs.

The line at this location was really slow as well. Everything was prepared in the assembly line and yet it took at least ten minutes for the three people in front of us to be served. None of the customers seemed to be doing anything that would delay service either. The people behind us in line were complaining about the wait as well.

I may seem really down on this place, but it would be okay for a quick lunch or dinner. It really isn't awful, but in my opinion there are too many good food options in Vegas to devote a meal to this spot.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,1,0,2,bC6UadfJ762__rQptEJk5Q

I have no idea what it was, but it had a most unpleasant texture.  I was too scared to take it out of my mouth and look at it, so I did the next best thing...I swallowed it.  The meat sauce that it came with was almost as bad - salty and no flavor.  But I did find it amazing that the vegetables I ordered tasted just like the ones served at my school cafeteria.  How do you take carrots, broccoli, and squash, and boil the shit out it so that they all taste the same? I tried to force myself to finish those, but was prevented from doing so by the pieces of broccoli bark.  Seriously, you are not supposed to cut up and serve the base of the broccoli.  It is too woody and fibrous.  I must look like a beaver.  They also had some pizzas on display, but ironically, they did not look as tasty as the meatballs.
