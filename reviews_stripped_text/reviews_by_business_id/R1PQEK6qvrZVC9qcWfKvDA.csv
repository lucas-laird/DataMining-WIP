I first spoke with Carmella, who was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, and made great suggestions for our order without being pushy at all.  I placed the order on Friday and gave a specific time to pick up on Monday.  When I arrived, the food was all packed and ready to go.  Carmella and another employee provided excellent service and even helped me take the items to the car.

As for the food, we ordered the steak and fish for 15 people. The fish was delicious and uniquely flavored with just the right amount of char, and the steak had a tasty sweet flavor as well.  Along with the meats, we also got all of the fixings, including generous portions of brown rice, brown seaweed rice, black beans, lettuce, bean sprouts, sour cream, cheese, and three types of salsa.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but it seemed like they literally gave us everything!  The food was a huge hit at my work, and I will definitely order here again.

It was FANTASTIC and my only complaint is I don't live locally to be able to come here every time a craving strikes, which is often. The Kalua Pig and grilled fish are family favorites, but everything is fresh and delicious. I love crispy tacos and to have an option that includes hand fried shells...it is indeed a moment of perfection in my day. Don't forget to take home a 1-lb box of Coconut Bark with you and make it last, because you will miss it when it is gone.

I literally downloaded the Yelp app on my phone again so I could specifically shout her out.

Second of all the food is ridiculously good. I had three of the biggest tacos for like seven bucks and ate all of them in one sitting. I'm a tiny human and these filled me up without making me feel sick. I think it's because their ingredients feel light weight and fresh. I don't get any fried food taste.

Braddah's functions similar to a chipotle with a burrito, bowl, salad, taco assembly line; however, Braddah's is not a knockoff chipotle. The rice, salsas, and meats all have an island flavor to them which gives Braddah's its delicious and unique identity. Both the steak and chicken taste amazing; still waiting to splurge on the kalua pig. Call me crazy, but my favorite thing about this place has to be that they carry cabbage as a topping option. Love it! And at last, dessert. If you're on the fence about the coconut bark, get off and buy it. Start with a 1/4 pound because you will probably eat the entire box no matter how big it is. Seriously, this stuff is dangerously good. To top everything off, they take care of students, and that goes a long way.

And they just expect you to know how their menu works. But anyways, I said no and she let me try pieces of the Kalua pig, steak, and chicken. The Kalua pig was so delicious. It was moist and juicy and tender. The steak had this special sauce that tasted kinda sweet and was thick but it was spot on. I got the 3 tacos and got Kalua pig on two tacos and the steak on the other one. I liked how I could change my choice of protein on my taco order. I got to choose what I wanted to add to the tacos and it was packaged securely. I did also get a fountain drink and total came out to around $10. Not bad.

Went to good old yelp and found Braddah's, being an avid wave rider and a lover of Hawaii as well as 4 1/2 star eats I knew it would be great!

All the people there were very friendly and immediately offered complete tasters of all the meats they serve to our party of 4. Super cool!

Well needless to say most of us went with the Kalua pig and the chicken was quite tasty as well.

Top that off with a little dessert of the coconut bark and all is good!

The idea of this place is kinda like chipotle and cafe rio. Where you pick out what you want whether it's a bowl, salad, burrito or tacos. Their toppings are SUPER different. But SUPER worth the try. You have the option of choosing whether you want brown rice (boring, but healthy) or seaweed rice (SO YUMMY, but not so healthy). They have different meats which consists of chicken, kahlua pig, shredded pork, or steak. The chicken is my favorite because it's seasoned just so right! Then you go on to the toppings, which they have so many to choose from! From lettuce, cheese, cabbage, jalapeños, banana peppers, etc! And then the sauces, which include mild, medium or hot, and THEN you have the option to put guacamole, and sour cream!! Oh man.

I ended up ordering a bowl with seaweed rice, chicken, cheese, lettuce and cabbage and a touch of guacamole! Sooo yummy I tell you. I love the homey feeling of coming to eat at a fast food-ish restaurant. My boyfriend got the burrito which included sea weed rice, chicken, jalapeños, sour cream and guacamole. 

But wait!! You MUST TRY the chocolate coconut bark! It's absolutely worth it! It's a desert that has chocolate, coconuts and a sugar that's hardened, but melts it your mouth. Be careful: it's Sooo addicting!

2553547,2015-02-11,0,R1PQEK6qvrZVC9qcWfKvDA,"So, I just tried this place for the first time. 

I tried a chicken bowl. It's basically the same kind of menu as a Chipotle, you just build your meal as you go. I was pretty excited to try this place since they advertise that the chicken is Huli Huli chicken, which is a super flavorful kind of rotisserie chicken. 

I have to say, I was really impressed with the flavor of the chicken. It tasted pretty authentic to what I've had before, so that was awesome. 

I decided to get the rice with seaweed. Unfortunately, they don't offer white rice here, which, I guess is cool if you're trying to be healthy but I'm really not a fan of brown rice. The seaweed rice really has an overpowering taste of seaweed (pretty good in my opinion) but if you have an aversion to it I would avoid it. and stick to the regular rice. 

To top it off, I also got the pineapple verde salsa, guacamole, and cheese. 

These all had nice flavors, but flavors I felt could have been pumped up a little bit. The salsa was a bit of a let down, it had some occasional heat which was nice but I expected the taste to have a little more of a punch to it. 

All in all, the food is good. Definitely a place worth trying.",mloua2rXvKQuayyY9KqEhg,0,0,4,aq2lO57vS6WWIQ9upWVKyw

Facility: 2 stars. I really hate how every time I come in the place is so smokey. If I get food I bring it back to UNLV or eat outside cause you CANNOT stay inside for an extended amount of time. Please fix this issue. Also, the seats outside are broken and need to be replaced. 

Staff: 3.5 stars. Friendliness is always great. Have big smiles and nice to customers. But the speed of the employees is slow. If you aren't first in line you could be waiting awhile.

We stopped in for a quick dinner after a long road trip from Denver. My Dad and I drove over and picked up 2 bowls for us and 2 for our girls. We all loved it so much that we ate here again before we left Vegas. 

As others have noted it's like a Hawaiian Chipotle.  The meats:Chicken, Beef and Pork all were great with a lot of flavor and a decent amount in the bowls and burritos.  They even gave us a quick sampling of each when we all came back. The salsa had good flavor but was not very hot. Maybe it's because we are fire eaters here at the home of Chipotle but it still was good. I liked the crunch of the cabbage and bean spouts, it added a nice texture to the bowls. The fresh lime wedge helped to create a nice pop of citrus in your mouth to go with the other quality ingredients.  

On our first visit it was near closing time and when my Dad ordered the standard rice the employee noticed it was looking stale in the bin, called for another batch to be brought out to fill his order. I know almost all other restaurants would have just given him the older rice and not seemed to care, thanks for making your customers orders top quality all the time.

I came here to try some Hawaiian Style Tacos which I haven't had in awhile.  I come in and a girl who looks like she was prepping something in the back earlier asked me what I wanted. She proceeds to grab gloves without washing her hands first. Her hands were clearly dirty and she grabbed the OUTSIDE OF THE GLOVES! Hello, the gloves are used for a reason!  I told the young lady to wash her hands and get a new pair of gloves which she did without question. 

Now she has gloves on, waiting for me to order, she is leaning against the counter with her gloves on the side of it and everything.  She then makes my taco Salad and straight grabs the salad with her hands. Maybe the counters are clean I said to myself as I kept picking my selections. She then grabs a tray which didn't seem clean as a bunch of water spilled over as she picked it up and put it back down.  Grabs my bowl and sticks her fingers in it.  At this point I'm over it and would rather starve a bit and find another option than getting sick from improper food handling and safety.

4006061,2016-02-17,4,R1PQEK6qvrZVC9qcWfKvDA,"I've been dying to try Braddah's after reading all the glowing reviews on Yelp. Hawaiian chipotle? Sounds delightful.  It's located right across from UNLV so it was convenient for me to drop by after my class to get some lunch.

Just think of Chipotle. Choice of bowl, tacos, nachos, burrito or salad. Choose your protein and toppings. What's unique is that your options of protein includes huli huli chicken (my fav!), kalua pig and pulehu steak to name a few. Choice of topping was similar to Chipotle: cheese, sour cream, lettuce, jalapeno, etc. 

I opted for their 3 tacos, all in crispy corn shell since their steamer (?) for soft flour tortilla was having some issues. My steak taco came out to be around $8 which I thought was a good deal for its serving size. 

The steak inside was super tender and juicy. Seemed to be marinated in some kind of sweet sauce. I liked my tacos overall. They were tasty and I couldn't stop eating it. ONO GRINDZ.

They have a lunch special which is two tacos plus a drink for around $6. I believe they offer discounts with a student ID also. I became a fan and will be back soon.

1.You pick what kind of food item - bowl, salad, burrito, nachos, and possibly tacos.
2. You choose your rice. They have seaweed brown rice or regular brown rice.
3. Pick if you want black beans. Don't remember if they had another option.
4. FINALLY you pick your meat: they have huli huli chicken, steak, Kalua pig, and grilled swai fish. This is the most important step. They let you taste the meats. The meat is seasoned well. The meat was actually my favorite part of the meal.
5. You can add grilled bell peppers and onions for a dollar more & you can add guacamole for extra also.
6. They have 3 salsas you can pick from: pineapple, mango corn, mango and Maui onion. 
7. They have a few other things you can choose to add like cabbage, lettuce, limes, cilantro.
8. I don't know how this works but they have 8 other sauces you can use. They weren't laying around and the meat was so good I didn't bother asking the staff.
9. The 2nd most important step is getting some of their coconut bark. Literally more crack than crack.

I got a bowl, seaweed brown rice, half chicken half Kalua pig, grilled veggies, lettuce, black beans, and a mix of all three salsas. The portion was pretty big. I was scared I wouldn't finish it.

The food was great and tasted fresh. Nothing was over salted, but everything was well seasoned and full of flavor. I have to say I loved their chicken and kalua pig. 

I will say the salsas were a bit of a let down. I definitely appreciate the natural flavors & the gentle hand when it comes to salt but they didn't pack a special punch I was hoping for. 

The girl working the counter alone was super sweet. She was definitely trained well and you could tell management cares about their reputation. The space was clean and the place is affordable. You can get a very filling meal that is truly unique for under $10 including a drink. 

My favorite part is I didn't feel gross after. I didn't feel sodium filled or a food coma'd. 

I can't wait to go back and might be taking a break from Chipotle for a little while.

I had put it at four stars but since I can't find anything bad to say I give this place a solid 5.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,3,2,5,lfel1j_5QJ_NDZzDT8qgTA
4085544,2015-06-11,0,R1PQEK6qvrZVC9qcWfKvDA,"Update:

DO get huli huli chicken tacos from this place. It has great flavor and wasn't dry.

DO NOT: Get a salad here. It's just sad. It's like when you go to PTs or some type of bar and they have pancakes on the menu. You could totally order pancakes, but you probably shouldn't. I understand that you want to give people options but when you serve a salad the way they do, it's best not to. 

The salad was on a bed of lettuce. Or so they said. I couldn't find much lettuce. I also got grilled veggies, trying to be a little healthier I suppose. Well technically, it is ""veggies"" as it was TWO types of pepper, green and red. They weren't grilled when I was there, so they were just cold and limp. It wasn't appetizing.

There was shredded cabbage and very light green and very light. I also got black beans, and when I did get a bite of black beans in it, it added flavor. I also got tortilla strips which I could barely find as well. Bean sprouts were in there. I also received guacamole (included in the price of the grilled veggies) and it was the biggest scoop of guacamole I've ever seen. Didn't help the salad at all, as guacamole is a transport or vessel for flavor, NOT flavor itself. 

I still like the place as their burrito bowls and tacos are very good. They have great salsas and the meats are very good. Stick with that. Other places like Cafe Rio and Chipotle do a decent job of salad. Those salads aren't your idea of the most healthy salads, but I can always recall seeing much more lettuce and greens in those salads than what I got today. 

Don't let this dissuade you from eating here at all, but just know that just because they offer salads, doesn't mean you should get it.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,0,0,4,Bg8ebJk-T6sMuWRWfez9zg

Braddah's Island Style, aka Hawaiian Chipotle. Big fan of the original location on Rainbow near Sahara, They haven't made it out to Henderson yet, but this outpost by UNLV is much more accessible to me. It's been open for quite a long time actually, but I only recently acquired a Groupon ($7.50 for $12, and maybe a Groupon code for additional discount).

I was considering the burritos or the nacos, but I had the three tacos with pricing possibly based on the most expensive protein ($7.95 I believe, a slight recent price hike, for pulehu steak). I also had the grilled fish and the kalua pig. Pretty much had them do all the tacos the same way: wheat tortillas, seaweed rice, black beans, corn and mango salsa (favorite from the first location), shredded cabbage, cheese, cilantro, sour cream, and a'a chips.

I found the steak to be a little sweet, the fish to be good if a little boring (maybe roasted vegetables w/ guac would be tastier for pescatarians), and kalua pork the tastiest of the three. I'm not sure if the a'a chips were around before, but the crunch was welcome. Probably had an oversight when I forgot to ask for lime, which would have brightened it up more.

I didn't see any of the sauce bottles out, so after the first taco, I ended up asking the employee about them because they were available at the original location as far as I knew. She said I could buy one, which I wasn't inclined to do. Then the manager walked in and I repeated my inquiry. He said that they'd have them tomorrow and that the original store was making them today, and he also offered them for sale. I said I wasn't interested for now.

When I sat back down, the manager asked out of the blue which sauce I wanted. The raspberry (with agave and jalapeño) was it of course. He then took a bottle from the fridge, opened it, and gave it to me on the house. Said that college students had been stealing them, and although he thought it was funny at first, it kept going and adding up. But I guess I either seemed like a loyal customer or I had some of my other purchases on the table. He even told me Merry Christmas. I don't know if the guy is Hawaiian, but I gotta give him props for treating me like ohana.

Finally, there's those aforementioned other purchases: coconut bark. It's one of my favorite desserts, so I had to grab a small box of that, as well a similarly sized box of the holiday bark ($4.95 each).Both are crunchy but not too hard, and ridiculously addictive. The holiday version comes with white chocolate instead of milk chocolate, as well as some peppermint. Keep them in the fridge because they seem to soften if you don't.

Braddah's has spread their version of Aloha spirit (and their yummy bark) throughout the Las Vegas Valley. Although I'm still waiting for them to show up on my side of town, this location should work for now. I was a little less impressed with the savory food, but much more wowed with the hospitality.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,10,5,HPLAiy5PGE2EdTCkbY_JRw

The staff is super friendly, and made me feel right at home! I didn't catch the first guy's name, but my receipt says its Elijah! He asked if I'd been there before, and when I said I hadn't, glorious food sample hook ups galore! I sampled the pulehu steak and huli huli chicken, and liked em both, so I decided on a burrito bowl! (I can't eat pork, but that one smelled super good too!)

I stuffed my bowl with...seaweed (brown) rice, huli huli chicken, pulehu steak, shredded cabbage, charred pineapple verde, mango & roasted corn, romaine lettuce, and bean sprouts. There were 4 different sauces that all sounded awesome, so I asked what he'd recommend and he suggested the papaya buttermilk ranch and raspberry with agave and jalapeño, and gave me both. (They were amazing, and I'm usually not even a fan of papaya. :o ) My ginormous bowl had generous portions, and cost just a tad over $8.50.

They (I say ""they"" because I also met Josh, who was the other guy working there!) also have a rather awesome flier with all sorts of wonderful deals, so I used one of the coupons to get a free side of guacamole with Hawaiian pink salt. I'm of the belief that guac makes everything in life better, and this was no exception. The music they play puts me in a good mood too. :D!

They also hooked me up with free samples of the coconut bark (milk chocolate & coconut with caramel, toffee and graham cracker) and their limited edition holiday bark (peppermint & white chocolate with caramel, toffee and graham cracker)! I bought a small box of the coconut bark to share with my friends, and will be sending em' this way!

We got there towards the end of the night, so besides us (party of 4) there were only 1-2 more groups in there; pretty empty. 

Walked in and was greeted warmly. I was told it was a ""Hawaiian style Chipotle"" and indeed, it was. That is basically the only way I can describe this eatery because that's exactly what it is. It's setup the exact same way as Chipotle... You either pick a bowl or a burrito and they have a line of meats/toppings to put inside or on top. 

The worker (wish I grabbed her name, she was awesome!) asked if it was our first time and without us asking, gave us a sample of the kalua pig and the steak before we ordered. I really appreciated that and it was a no brainer for me to go with the steak... It was really sweet! (I forgot the name but it's the only steak on the menu. Looks like Pipi Kaula but sweet not smokey.) She also offered us a sample of their famous ""Coconut Bark.""

I chose a bowl and went with the steak and furikake (nori/seaweed) rice. Then, went forward with all the toppings and sauces. If I remember correctly, it was cabbage, tomatoes, corn, bean sprouts, cilantro, salsa, lime, guac and sour cream. 

Let me put it this way.... SHE PACKED THE BOWL. Not stingy at all. She stacked my bowl HIGH with the various toppings. Such generous servings!!! This is a big plus. You definitely get MORE for your money and the bowls are not overpriced either. They even offer a discount for UNLV (not sure about CSN or if only this location offers student discount being that they're right across from UNLV) when you show your student ID. 

They have special homemade sauces and the signature Hawaiian Sun drinks. 

We dined in and when I took my first bite.... I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN. I don't know how I will ever eat Chipotle the same after eating here. Everyone back home in Hawaii wants a Chipotle, but I say, make a Braddah's!!! The owner needs to open one in Hawaii... Locals would go crazy. 

Anyone who loves Chipotle and who loves Hawaiian food, will definitely enjoy Braddah's. The customer service is awesome, definitely felt like I was back home, and the food is broke da mout status.

I came in and the girl working didn't even notice that I was there. I had to get her attention multiple times. When I finally got her attention, she looked annoyed that I was there.

This location is directly across from the student union at UNLV in a small shopping plaza.

Being a local boy, growing up in Hawaii, I always loved the cuisine. From Kalua pork cabbage, to Lomi Salmon I am very picky when it comes to the flavors of my food.

For starters, the decor in the restaurant was very Pacific Island-y. The appeal of the restaurant and the atmosphere created a great starting point as we eat with our eyes first.

The service style is exactly like a Chipotle or a Subway. You choose your base, your meats, your veggies, and go. Liked the concept that the restaurant was going for, but I feel as if it was lacking in the *umph* factor. In other words, it lacked the value that makes me want to return to it.

I myself had the steak bowl, and my girlfriend the Kalua pig bowl. The quantity that they put in the bowl was very inconsistent as I had a full bowl, and my girlfriend barely had a thing in hers. It's those little things that really ad up to the value of the food and restaurant.

Overall, I gave it a 2-Star for it's concept, it's ambiance, and the location from UNLV.",QVrLRR_Q-gPq4EinMochpw,0,0,2,EmM-PpxGKhdXighkt4Ud4g

After that, you can choose the added condiments such as tomato, cilantro, corn, avocado and etc. 

Josh helped us through the entire process since it was our first time there. He gave us the meat and poultry and fish samplers. The pork is delicious and soft.

I was torn because both were super succulent and heavy with flavor. 

I settled on the bowl option, which was piled with brown seaweed rice (flavorless but healthy) and pork. The mango corn salsa has a good kick in spice, which I would recommend. You have to notice what other options there are, i.e. guacamole, sour cream, limes, because they will not necessary list out what else you can put in your meal. The meat was STELLAR but the whole bowl itself was just a solid four stars.

Lastly, you MUST try the coconut bark.

Overall a good experience.",P1JqTh13dpAZ16U1ZPw_IA,7,7,5,KxpbYrbBP-UyOvsuY4cR4A

Overall:

Recommended if you are in the mood for a new style of chipotle. The food is not amazing but it is good. 

Parking: 

Decent amount of parking. *5 stars*

Establishment: 

Decor was hawaiian themed. Service was good nothing to complain about. *5 stars*

Food: 

Burrito: I had the hula hula chicken and the kalua pork. It was pretty tasty but nothing amazing. *4 stars*

Coconut bark: Good but only had the sample size with the check-in. Reminded me of a almond crispy almond joy. *4 stars*",nWS4xS4lAfi9xeW8uABx8g,0,0,4,DqjAPlLV_1Rma78Z-vtAYw
