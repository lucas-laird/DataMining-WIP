The noodle soup was fine, but Pad Thai was just bland. I got a Boba tea, which cost about $5 or so, but we ended up with a $38 bill with only 2 dishes that cost only $12 each at most, so I guess they actually charged for the water that we asked when we were waiting for our orders. This is the fun part: when we were ready to pay and leave, the owner actually demanded that we pay by cash. I know some small places can decline credit card or charge a small fee if a purchase is under $10, but common guys, it was almost $40.

It was practically empty except for some dudes that were in there giving the workers a hard time (they left shortly after my group walked in). 

First off their menu choices are small but you can always have them make your soup or noodles how you want. 

I had the tofu and mixed veggies (very delicious). The chicken soup with mixed veggies (perfect when you don't want to feel bloated). The general Tao chicken was by far what had us amazed (it was the first dish out). We had the fried dumplings (simple but a lot of flavor). My cousins got the chicken lo lein and the yang chow fried rice. 


Most importantly the staff was very attentive to us. It's like any other restaurant. If you're nice to the employees they're nice to you. Don't hesitate to ask them to make a dish in a different way than they have it on the menu.

WARNING! DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE! DISHONEST AND BAD SERVICE! ???????????
I usually do not rant on Yelp. But people should be alert of this kind of shitty service and not give your money away. 

We visited on Dec 20th evening, I wasn't even planning to eat here, just walking pass-by and saw the board outside says milk bubble tea in Chinese. It was late in the evening, and a bit chilly so I decided to get a cup of warm bubble tea. 

5 minutes after I ordered a hot milk tea with bubble, I couldn't believe I was still engaged in conversation with the owner. It goes like this: 
Me: I want a hot milk tea.
Owner: Do you want bubbles?
Me: Yes.
Owner: Do you want it hot or cold?
Me: Hot, do you serve hot?
Owner: Well, you know most people usually prefer cold milk tea, since it's better experience..
Me: (interrupts) so do you make it hot?
Owner: If you insist, I can make it hot..but most people want it cold you know. Do you want bubbles?
Me: Yes. How much is it?(taking my money out)
Owner: it's 75cents extra with bubbles, so 5.75 without bubble, and 6.5 with bubbles.
Me: (not happy with this overpriced tea, but it's tourism area, so i put my money on the table), ok, i want a hot milk tea with bubbles.
Owner: so you still want it hot?

Back to where we began!! And while conversing, some customers entered, so this owner just left in the middle of our conversation and turned to attend those new customers who apparently wanted to dine(so potentially worth more money than me), i've never experienced server this rude. Btw, the restaurant was pretty much empty. They had at least 3 servers out including the owner, so he didn't have to attend to those customers.

Meanwhile, another server who was pouring tea (yes they do have a hot teapot I saw that) behind the counter, asked the owner what I wanted in Chinese. I can understand them the whole time, it basically went ""ok, what does she want? she wants milk tea, hot""(very impatiently). I asked my last question: ""so will you serve hot milk tea or not??"", owner again murmured: ""Well, you know most people usually prefer cold milk tea, since it's better experience..but if you insist i can make hot"". OMFGGGG, it's a matter of 6 dollars, if you can not offer what you say you can, just DON'T SAY YOU OFFER IT! 

So 15 minutes of unpleasant conversations and wait later, I stormed out without milk tea.  And did I mention that on their milk tea menu on the wall, there was no price at all?? Obviously they like to charge whatever price they have for ya. It's a shame that they try to fool tourists especially Chinese tourists. I didn't pay anything in the end, but I believe other reviewers were right about them adding extra for tip. Of course they will.

That was not a correct assumption. While I ended up getting some pork dumplings (pot stickers) my friends were hungry and got eggrolls and soups. They said their soups were just whatever, but my dumplings were good. Just wish I had more verity to choose from. 

The boba however was quite unfortunate as it had more ice than anything else. Also our service was a little weird with dishes coming out very quickly and extremely late. We were asked for orders before we even got menus, and it took a while to get our missing silverware sets.

I'm not too fond of fast-food, and Vegas seems to be cluttered with those sort of options. I enjoy piping hot Asian food, and that is what I found in this little Chinese restaurant. It seems a bit lonely and run down. But once you enter, you're greeted warmly by the servers. Their werent that many people inside, but it didnt really matter to me. I went ahead and ordered the crispy scallion pancakes, hot milk tea, and pad thai with tofu.

The best item from my order was the scallion pancakes. They were crisp, hot and fresh. It's more of an appetizer item, but scallion pancakes have always been a favorite of mine so I was pleased by their appeal and flavor. I already knew that ordering pad thai at a Chinese restaurant was not the best idea, but luckily it wasnt too bad. The flavor was not authentic, but it still tasted fresh. The tofu was soft and crisp, and the noodles were tender. I would give it 3 stars. The Chinese style hot milk tea did not taste good at all! I would give that beverage a 1 star. I am a big fan of milk tea, but this drink did not deliver the taste that i was craving. They also have tapioca here, but im glad I did not order that. I'm not too sure if it would have been any good. 

Anyway, the menu is quite large. I was hoping their would be a vegetarian option for dumplings, but their wasnt. This place doesnt have the best food on the strip, but its not awful either.

Walking along the strip or even driving by it, you could easily miss it. It's in a marketplace of restaurants and vendors close to Polo Towers and the Travelodge.

After eating finely the two days prior on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided as a group to stroll the marketplace (which was steps away from our hotel --the Polo Towers) and see what we wanted to eat that wouldn't cost a lot, and couldn't drive anyway because none of us could legally do that at the time, if you catch my drift.

There weren't too many patrons inside so service wasn't slow for us. There's a good number of tables and seats here as well as a wall mural of photos depicting food around the world. The 6 of us sat down, ordered food, and received food in a timely fashion. We were out of there in 15mins and didn't feel rushed...except that it was almost time for the Walking Dead episode to come on..

I ordered the miso ramen. I've had better noodles in San Diego but the broth was nice. No MSG present (I'm sensitive to MSG so I'll know), and really satisfies me. Others in my group got a roasted duck and BBQ pork bowl (roasted duck has bones so beware), roasted duck and wontons soup,  as well as shrimp fried rice which had full shrimps tossed in.
