After being annoyed with the delay I decided to take their survey.  AND I CAN'T.  My receipt doesn't include the survey code, it says it's a reprint.  Probably given out like that to avvoid getting bad surveys due to taking forever on their drive thru time.  This Taco Bell is so awful!",OC-NvVaf1gS6b78GWFfPhg,0,0,1,B0ETLKahtfZpk1I183l2cw

If you enjoy a child screaming and yelling for 45 min while you try to eat your lunch then this is the place for you. Best of all is after asking not one not two but three employees to help aid in the situation and being ignored. The family decides to talk ill to me and mine. I finally had me and my family which includes a small child leave early. We where not even able to finish our lunch. Even better when i asked for the corporate office phone number not a single employee even acknowledged me. Never going back again!,WKX74bLceVFSVOeV8x_4vw,0,0,1,gFODO4nyykHl3JlrV5rcMQ

 First one last week, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a hard shell taco w/ chicken, cheese, and lettuce in it.   Bean and cheese burrito....I got a beef and cheese burrito. Maybe it's my east coast accent? I don't know.   Yesterday, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a gordita with chicken and cheese. Um hi, either you don't carry that one anymore, or the person reading the recipe does not know what they're doing?

Inside isn't much better. They ran out of napkins and just said ""sorry"", and offered no alternative . We used paper towels from the bathroom.  Are they not aware they serve finger food?

I understand they use this as a filler but when there is enough lettuce to actually make a salad between the two.. you might have used too much. I called and complained and was told to come back for a free meal but I'm from out of town and left before they were open.  

I'd still go here but more than likely wouldn't order a chalupa assuming that's how they make them here, everyone else's food was good except for mine.",yYP0JyAJer1IACaTBh9Ewg,0,0,3,_lbeT2sT4MFBazkSTsl2qw

I've supported you throughout the last 4 decades. I try everything you come up with, no matter how greasy, fatty, or un-mexican it has been. I even tried your burrito wrapped taco, which I should've suspected would taste like your taco wrapped burrito, which tastes like your crunchwrap, which tastes like your Diet Pepsi. 

I draw the line with these weird high-school-paper-study-hall-note-shaped chicken triangles(See photo). I want my dollar 99 back.
