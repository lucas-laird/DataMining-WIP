I had always known but got reminded exactly how much electronic bingo is .. According to my review in 2014, i used to play a blue packet for $4 with double action for extra $2. So $6... This most recent visit, i paid $19 for a 2 pack blue electronic with double action, bonus ball, and an electronic fee. Ouch? In comparison to how it was back then, many many more people play electronic now compared to paper. Paper is available still. More expensive packages seem to give a small $2 discount. 1 of us had gotten it.. He got a special A pack

Sigh... after all these years, i've gotten close !!! So close that my game beeps saying theres 1 number left ! ! ! but sigh... unfortunately its never me. 2 of the 5 of us actually hit bingo this time too ! So lucky ! 

2 drinks per visit complimentary from the ""bar"" in the back right corner per person. Some get beers. Some get simple drinks. I typically get cranberry vodkas and/or midori sours XD 

I actually kind of miss playing paper. Yes its a rush and mildly stressful but quite fun. I remember seeing grandma's doing multiple packs like it was nothing. XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,0,4,ZyPaJjlmDZ-aAduzQ0EecQ

I've been there previously,  it's spacious (usually, I can't speak for tournaments), well air conditioned and with a generally friendly staff.

Like the other station casinos, they make it easy to get started.  Once you pay for your cards at the desk, just pick a cozy little spot to sit and you're ready.  Now I always get the electronic board so I don't miss any numbers.  It's easy : just enter your number from the receipt, it automatically blots the numbers called, the board will ding when you are one number away.  If you prefer to dob, they can sell the paper bingo cards as well.  

They have several large number boards around the bingo hall to see what has been called.  There is also a waitress to bring you drinks from the bar located inside.

This started a chain reaction of issues to come. Every game someone's computer went down making the games last over 2 hours past the time.

On top of that they had the Raiders/Niner games going on in the room so there were several guys there playing with their wives yelling at the game during the session. It was absolutely too loud to hear caller.

Late night bingo- so just in case you can't find anything else to do in VEGAS at 1:00am you can always come an play bingo.

Good hot chocolate

Cons:
Staff were friendly to the locals but being newbies they weren't too helpful

Slot machines outside the hall were really old

People with the machines will make you grumble to yourself when you hear that ""beep beep beep"" of someone being one square away from bingo.  Bah!

2594237,2018-04-05,1,d6m_X827VcM6ZV5C4yTiHw,"We had a fun time playing Bingo at South Point, but there are a few improvements that could be made. 

First, the Bingo hall employees could be much friendlier. When we reached the window to purchase our packs, my husband mentioned with a smile this was our first time playing Bingo and we didn't know how the packs/card buying process worked. The employee cut him off and just signed us up for whatever she wanted without explaining anything to us. During our entire session we didn't see one employee smile, not even after I got Bingo and one had to come count my winnings out to me-no smile, congratulations, nothing. It doesn't take a lot of effort to be nice and friendly and can really make or break one's experience, and for us, it put a damper on our time here.

Second, there should be somewhere we can get information on the Bingo terms and options available here. As I mentioned, it was our first time playing Bingo and there was nowhere we could get information in laymen's terms that explained the packages and options (validated vs unvalidated, rainbow packs, cash ball, double action, the difference between packs you can buy, etc) available for the Bingo sessions. We asked the Bingo employee where we purchased our Bingo packs from to explain the packs so we'd know which ones we wanted to purchase but she just signed us up for ones and didn't take the time to explain anything. I understand if they don't want to take the time to do this, but feel there should be information somewhere (pamphlet in the Bingo hall, listed on their web page, explained on their tv channel that explains other things about the casino) for first-timers. 

Third, I would LOVE if they would stop allowing smoking during the sessions. Cigarette smoke causes issues with my contacts in addition to making me nauseous. We had to move seats twice before our session began just to avoid smokers who sat near us at our table and it wasn't easy lugging our machines, four drinks, and belongings to a new area twice just because of smokers.

Fourth, just an observation- I'm not sure if it's the same everywhere, but we found it weird they would switch callers out in the middle of a game. This happened often. 

Finally, the prices seem very high. Both my husband and I ended up getting Bingos during our session and our winnings didn't even cover the amount it costed us to play. It'd be nice if there were cheaper options for Bingo.

That all being said, the session we attended was pretty busy, but there are so many tables and places to sit it didn't feel cramped.We loved the huge Bingo hall and the number of places you can choose from to sit, along with the complimentary 2 drinks (although the employees working the bar area could have been more friendly). We also like that they have plenty of sessions, so you can fit it into your schedule pretty easily. We had fun playing (especially since we got Bingos) but don't think we will be back due to the high prices, smokers, and unfriendliness of the employees here.",y4aEhXdfKAX8klEvOszSCA,1,0,2,9L0HMuLB7sncMYldxo8V7g

The machines are quite easy to use and you really need do nothing but watch.  Everything else is automatic.  This leaves ample time for quiet (sometimes) talk and you can update your Facebook status as many times as you want.

South Point's Bingo was ranked ""Best Bingo in Las Vegas"" from 2011 to 2014.  And you know what?....I totally agree.  I agree because the room is spacious, clean, the price is right, and there's always a chance that I'm yelling BINGO.

I recommend to bring your South Point Card to get a discount and the electronic bingo is easier if your not one to dabber. Lol",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,1,0,4,q9hBYmRBWHahj_63uuSJSw

Today is my birthday,  I've been sick for the past 5 days straight but mustered up the energy to go play a game with my mom. 
After standing in a looong  line for 12 minutes,  with 5 minutes until the game starts,  I look through my wallet and realize I forgot my players card.  That means everything is more expensive and you cannot play for the same jackpots with the same cards for some games. 
Realizing I am far too Ill  to run downstairs for a new card and get back in time,  I ask the familiar face at the counter if she could look it up for me and she said no because they were too busy.  Then I politely said,  could you please do it for me as it's my birthday?  She still refused saying it would take too long and that she had a line.  Then a woman walks up behind me and she proceeds to assist her  while we stand there and wait.  Once she finished with the out of turn woman,  she cane back to us and still refused to look up my card number.   
I will never return to this ""locals"" bingo room.  If they don't care about a sick  regular on her birthday,  they don't care about anyone.",2BM4yGQX3dgsQ_QCoLJLZA,2,1,1,ZTOKxI_vlq1Lu6XsH7VQzw

Basically you have the electronic (a black box against the wall), a stationary (a monitor), and then paper bingo. I think the cheapest u can get in with an electronic is $15 but it's worth it. The drinks are complimentary and if lady luck is on your side then it could be an easy $50 or $500! Some people have even won $10,000! Plus you'll know if you've won because your machine tells you when you're one number away and sings if you get a bingo! I took off one star bc it can be pretty addictive and I didn't win squat!

Bingo here at South point is better than Stations and Other bongos halls in town because I've never won anything anywhere else besides South Point. It's a different feel here too. The bingo ha is huge so it seats many especially when they have the Bingo Gala Tournaments. Complimentary drinks are passed, and the staff is pretty friendly and helpful if you're not sure which pack to purchase. They post the numbers they've called on a huge screen so you can always double check your card. Just don't yell bingo until your sure you have it, you'll  be sure to piss people off.

You basically set up your electronic card and it plays the games automatically for you, sounding little alarms/songs  as you get closer or win.  We ordered drinks at the counter before we sat down and then the server came by for the next round.  You get one chance to order from the server while playing so I highly recommend getting the first round before getting seated.  The drinks are VERY WEAK!!! Just sayin...

I won $50 on one round of play.  Yay!!! They bring the cash to you so you don't have to get up from your play.

At the end, she made sure that I looked over the games once more and asked if any questions popped into mind. 

Even though I'm not big on gambling, this is a good way to pass an hour without spending too much money ($5 for blue pack). And, it's fun to dot the Bingo card. The complimentary drinks is a huge plus!",lNydqDYNT32uqOjjgwArJg,1,0,5,beJ8-y6PsaF1Dfy5LGgObQ

I got curious when my friend went so my husband and I tagged along. So far, I've played bingo maybe three times and all three times, it was at South Point. They have plenty of games through the days. We typically go to the 11 PM games -- the prizes aren't as big as the 9 PM games but there is a lot less people. 

They have a few packages that you can get. You can play on paper or on an electronic device. The electronic device comes with a $2 fee. If you have a South Point players card, some of the packages provide a small discount .. $3 or so. 

Sometimes I get the blue package with coverall, bonus ball, etc. It's $21. And one time I got the special A package which contains a small rainbow package with all the add ons, it'll come out to be like $36 or so? 

You get 2 drinks every time you play, which is pretty nice. I typically just get two beers. 

Unfortunately, I've never won but I've gotten close! Overall, pretty cool place to go and hang out with friends. Catch on some gossip while you drink beers and watch your cards not get close at all.

A few of some buddies visiting from Hawaii came down and asked my girl and I if we wanted to join them.  Why not.  So we head down and told that we missed the 9 o'clock buy in.  It appears that there are games held on every odd hour, but not sure if it is ran 24-hours all day.  That would be wild, imagine some old fogies duking it out by going crazy at some bingo joint.  That would be epic (as one as no one gets hurt of course).

It's simple really, you can either do it old school with a dauber (stamp pen) or but a machine and let it do all the work for you.  When the machine sings, ""I'm in the money!"" you win!  Two drink at a time per person and any group of friends can have a blast there.  

Mind you, there are some serious hardcore players that allow no talking, blinking or breathing if under the age of 50, and you must wear your AARP card laminated on your lanyard.  I am not being an age racist, since I am getting old my self, but life is too short (hardcore lady with a bedazzled dauber with 100 sheets laid out) j/k, not really.

My lady won $20, price of admission, her first time out too.  This only means that she got bit by the bug and you can expect us there often in the foreseeable future.

So, what had happened was we finally won at bingo.
After coming to this very bingo hall a few times and watching everyone around us win, our time had come.

It was the night before the b/f's birthday and we had just finished an early dinner with friends before rushing over for the 7:00pm game. Now, we've only been here for the 9:00pm games on Saturday nights and they were definitely not as crowded as this time slot was; the line was so long that the game started almost 10 minutes late. Our party of four sat at a non-smoking table near the bingo-caller lady. The b/f and I got the machines and our friends played the paper/dauber way, which is too much work for me; I can't take the pressure. After securing our complimentary adult beverages from the corner bar (don't forget to tip!), we settled in to play.

The session began like all the others: no bingo for us, not even close. The b/f and I figured this would be another losing night. But then, I was one number away from winning, according to my machine. And then my number was called! I was in shock (I guess) because I didn't immediately yell, ""bingo!"" like a winner is supposed to; I just stared at the screen in front of me while the b/f yelled for me.  It was so exciting!  No one else yelled, ""bingo!"" when I did so that meant I was going to have the winnings all to myself,  all $50 of it!  Yes, I won FIFTY DOLLARS!  Whoop!  It doesn't really matter how much you win at bingo because people get excited, including me, especially since it was my first time.  Simultaneously, everyone else in the bingo hall gets mad when someone else other than themselves wins; people groan and hiss.  We know because that's what we do, too.  TIP: bingo is serious business to the regulars.  Don't get noisy or talk too much when the game is going on or you will get the stink eye like no other.  That's why I don't like the paper/dauber method; you can't have any fun observing all the other people around you when you have to search for all the numbers yourself.

Still reading?  I'll get to the actual best part of the night.  On the last coverall of the night, the last game, the last number called....my boyfriend won the game and $1,000.  Yes, ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS!  And he didn't have to share it with any other winners, either. Stink eyes and boos rained down upon us, but it was a perfect early birthday gift for my guy.  5 stars for South Point! Then we went downstairs to Steak n Shake, but that's another story.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,12,11,5,oV-eZP393NgO_Z6oZ-6Wew

They have sessions from 9am-1am, 7 days a week.  The bingo agents are very helpful. So if you've never played, don't worry.  Just make sure you have a South Point player's club card because you get a discount on your packs.  If you tell the agents how much money you would like to spend, they will help you get the most for your money.  They have progressive cashball jackpots which get very large at times, and also draw big crowds.  They also offer progressive dual action coveralls for $2 and normal dual action coveralls for $1.  Some times the crowds get so big that the games go really fast, so be prepared.

The bar is located in the corner.  You can walk up before the session starts.  I believe that it is supposed to be 2 free drinks per person, but they are not really strict on that policy.  *Don't forget that, although the drinks are free, you should tip* The cocktail waitress also comes through the room once during the session.

Overall, this is one of the better rooms in town.  Not my favorite, because I end up spending more money, but the chance to win big is good as well.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,3,1,4,LIlrP-vvt_4b3e-_S-hBww

We waited in line for help and to purchase the games. But there was no one at the window until 15 to 20 minutes before it started.  Geez louis. Good thing my love for the game motivated me to stick through it. The woman at the counter really provided thorough instruction and information on the breakdown of the game,  which my friends and I all appreciated. So nice too :)

The game commenced and alas, we were not the lucky winners. But we did have fun concentrating in our game cards and the numbers being called. The free coffee and donuts that we were given in the beginning of the game was also a nice added touch.",MKZMBguHl8rwCop5qr1jtQ,2,1,5,x7r8z_UyB2-28Zy5OxwDJQ

On the electronic machine, it beeps when you are one away, and sings a lovely tune when you win.  One hand had ~15 winners.  Lots of singing machines.  Such a hoot.
