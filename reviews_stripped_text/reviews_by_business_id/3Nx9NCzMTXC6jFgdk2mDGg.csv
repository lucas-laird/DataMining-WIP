We were seated relatively quickly, however, our server came to see us once the entire time to find out what we wanted to drink and that was the last we saw of her. She didn't stop by to see if we wanted refills, if we needed new utensils, or just to see how we were doing. I didn't like that at all.",2KMzPsn6cTKPbmY3wRLa_g,3,1,3,3ckr58buYeCWadiYNLUPRQ

When we made our way from our room to the restaurant, we were greeted by a line of about 15 people waiting to get into the buffet.  Since we were not ordering buffet, we proceeded directly to the hostess stand.  We were seated and given menus and glasses of ice water.  I decided on the biscuits and gravy, and a glass of milk.  

While we were waiting for our food, come cranky old lady started to yell at the waiter in a deep Southern accent (about how no one had come to take her order.)  I don't know how long she had been there, but that wasn't the end of her outbursts.  She later started shouting about not having anything to drink.  In the background was the neverending racket of the slot machines.

My biscuits and gravy were really tasty, and the price was under $6.  My three star rating reflects the ambience of the place-- you never forget that you are in a casino.

I was asked to leave by a very rude cashier, when lunch started and breakfast stopped. 
What buffet asks you to leave because a new time of the day begins?
I came 30 minutes before the breakfast buffet ended.The food was very cold, tasteless, and I didn't eat anything; thinking I could have lunch in a few minutes.
The manager offered to take care of my meal, but I was totally disgusted and wanted my money returned.  Most Vegas places beg locals to visit; this place lost a customer in general.",6h_lNbur5AY8A8967q3adQ,1,0,1,9G7jS1HIsIsQDdLl1gz8TA

All new and clean and revamped with a made to order grill w burgers (grilled onion mushroom and Swiss), ham and cheese and hot fries just like your (my) short order cook grandma would make for me.  Plus a decent small buffet w things like stuffed cabbage and lots of cream pies.

I generally view buffets with an open mind. After all, there is a variety to choose from, and if you choose the wrong thing, you can always go get something else. And if worse comes to      worse, just make a nice big salad and then hit the dessert bar, right? Wrong. Unless you want a heapin' helpin' of wilted iceberg with shredded carrots and canned beans, topped off with a piece of week-old sheet cake or a plastic cup of chewy Jell-o in one of the less desirable flavors like orange or yellow).

We had actually been here a couple of times in the past. Enough to know that the only thing worth eating is the made to order cheeseburgers and fries, which you can get cheaper in the coffee shop. Everything else (and it's not that much) seems like it's either swimming in a pool of sticky brown gray made from a powdered mix, or halfway through the mummification process in some desiccated tomato-based sauce. No, thank you.

BUT, I received a mailer containing the news that they had remodeled AND a couple of free passes, so we decided to give it a go. Went early on a Sunday afternoon. The place as packed and there was a line - unheard of! I took it to mean that there had been some great improvements made. Nope. Just meant they sent out a lot of free mailers, and the staff was dreadful. 

We waited in line (VIP line, mind you) over 20 minutes, amazed by servers and bussers who were neither serving nor bussing, just kind of wandering. They were as adept at ignoring us as they were the empty, dirty tables. The only one clearing dishes and showing any hustle was a guy in a shirt and tie who I assume was the manager. Good for him for being involved, but bad on him for not doing his real job and lighting a fire under that listless staff.

Once we got inside, we could discern absolutely no sign of any remodeling. All the food selections looked exactly the same with one exception: there used to be a big bowl of cheap, store bought cookies on the end station (you know what I'm talking about - those 99 cent store Chips Ahoy). No one knew why it was there, but it had replaced by a giant plastic bag with cheap dinner rolls spilling put onto the counter.  I guess in their minds, that WAS the remodel.

Never again. Not for free. Not even if they pay me.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,2,1,1,zsLr8cn4oka2GaGwyBvW2w
4145021,2017-03-03,2,3Nx9NCzMTXC6jFgdk2mDGg,"Ok , this is one of those looking a gift horse in the mouth type of reviews .
We came here because my partner and I got free buffet coupons as we had recently played bingo here, so we decided to use them , we weren't really expecting much and this place did not exceed those expectations , lol . It is a rather small buffet but filled with a little something for everyone which is to say standard buffet fare , although most items were good , I did find most were already cold or barely warm and the buffet just opened for dinner service? This last comment is directed at the management and they can hopefully correct this issue. Their standout items were any of the carved meats , I did try a little bit of each and thoroughly enjoyed the brisket!! Each of the meats were flavorful, tender and juicy, the variety that day were brisket, ham,turkey, pork loin and sausage. The pork loin was a very close second and had an awesome spice rub on it, they also do make cooked to order burgers , hot dogs , grilled cheese and French fries . The burger was awesome and brought me back to an old school back yard BBQ & that was the only item I did eat every bite of!!! Desserts were standard fare and they also have a soft serve sundae station with a lot of different toppings. Service was good and we never felt ignored and beverages were refilled promptly, only service issue was the lady at the grill and carving section did seem to be bothered by being there and was a bit gruff . All in all it was a good visit and would definitely return if they correct their temperature issues because it was a decent meal for dinner 10.99 per  person and cheaper depending on your level of play with players card!",WfbJKGJWj2yQ50XRku-OzQ,4,1,3,SdHzGO-5Lj9Dgkr94traRA

5314409,2014-01-25,2,3Nx9NCzMTXC6jFgdk2mDGg,"We came here on a couple times on a Friday night and had their Prime rib AYCE for $12.96 (We used the Caisno Guide BOGO)

- The buffet is very simple. American, Mexican, Salad bar, pizza, soup and grill. 
- The best part about this buffet and the only reason why we come here is just for Friday nights for their Prime Rib.
- Great prime rib. They actually re-grill a somewhat rare slab and it is amazing! Very flavorful, and not dry. I love it. 
- They make fresh cheeseburgers. We order the cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms with freshly fried french fries. 
- For the price of about 6.50 per person, this buffet beats any fast food American restaurant. 
- Free sodas with buffet. 
- Always empty so service is always nice. 
- I don't touch much of the other stuff. It's more like AYCE prime rib and burgers haha. 
- Chicken soup is very salty. 
- Compared to Feast buffet, Feast is better. 
- 11.99 Fri Sat is for Blue Ace members. 
- Closes at 9pm Friday. They start cleaning the buffet at 9:15 and it closes at 9:30pm",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,10,5,3,TRqR8P9nC4AtPbrgV681jQ

5978321,2017-06-29,0,3Nx9NCzMTXC6jFgdk2mDGg,"Great place for people with no taste buds and no taste. :^)

Service is not welcoming, ordering drinks at the front is strange, and the most important feature of all - the food.

The selection is sad and the food is definitely not fresh. I think Costco's snack bar has a larger variety of food than this ""buffet"". I don't know about you, but room temperature or colder food that is typically hot and fresh doesn't sit right with me. On top of that, the food doesn't taste good to begin with.

It takes 20 minutes for one of the servers standing around the edges to notice you calling them for a refill. If you can't wait for your drink refill, just go to the soft-serve ice cream machine to get your liquids in; that ice cream ain't thick, anyway.

Don't even bother going to the desserts. Nothing sweet about them...",c8bXqrwwCgiV5E6D9pcWpw,0,0,1,rxr3ExDKNc3DetRX2N_guQ
