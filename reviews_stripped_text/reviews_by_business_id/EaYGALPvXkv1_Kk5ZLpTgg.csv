The fries I ordered were so delicious, even the staff members couldn't resist eating them while making my sandwich! (I saw two employees eating fries through the hole in the kitchen wall, as my sandwich was presumably being made). 

Maybe that's why the quantity of fries was so small.

The staff seemed inexperienced. Won't be back because I prefer thin bread, and I don't enjoy seeing employees eating my fries in the prep area while laughing and making awkward eye contact with me at the counter mid-chew.",TVTeHvvYwNm13YI1HqW87w,4,0,2,iWzvsDEHkGLIDpf-CR7EKA

Took 20 minutes for them to tell me they had to refund me because they ran out of avocado, etc. this is after telling me the sandwich was on the way (after asking where it was). There was one order ahead of mine. This is in a food court too.",UVf005e2ZyZYVM-wcHOJlg,0,0,1,3J-jkup-otwsw5lDI5emGg

3875049,2014-01-07,0,EaYGALPvXkv1_Kk5ZLpTgg,Had the egg and cheddar panini. Wow really good! Totally fresh with none of that fast food plasticity you find at so many other chains. Great coffee as well. Nice discovery!,AnpHNws99VWfPf7sv8qS8w,1,0,5,i3Jz-14YsjQkrA8jBCBvug

Today I was the 3rd in the window and it took 30 minutes. 30 MINUTES for a sandwich?! It's in a fast food court for petes sake. And my sandwich came out looking like a sloppy joe and wasn't even made how I asked. I ate it anyways in fear it would take another 30 to fix it. Now I'm suffering from a stomatch ache. Ps they eat while they work, sanitary? Never again!",onzojC4KX1L1wYvrRRQDCA,1,0,2,V0LGLxpSZDhhHNQxJ-hmzQ

Keep it going and the love that goes into the food. You can tell once you take your first bite! I enjoyed the sandwiches and had a nice cup of joe! Yum and will be returning!,3xT6by94wrLh-AKAdmV-fA,2,0,5,H3an6xEp-L4llNi5b30mZQ
