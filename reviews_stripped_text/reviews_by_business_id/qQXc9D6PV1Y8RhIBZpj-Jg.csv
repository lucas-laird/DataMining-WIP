My other favorite dish to order is GOY or larb seen( raw mince beef with some B in it haha) the lao folks know what im talking about.

     The owners are very nice people, very friendly and alwayse smiling thats why we love coming here. Besides the hot food, theres asian vegetables, jael bong(chilli paste) balut(baby duck egg) rice and many more.

It tastes just like home made Lao food, and I say that out of confidence because I'll always be bias about the Lao food I get at home. My friends and I actually came here twice, two days in a row (b/c it was that good). They have a menu in Lao, Thai, and English. However, there are some things that they serve that is not on the menu (referring to English one). For example, kao nam, ka poon, larb, deep fried fish, sticky rice, long bean thum mak hoong, ect. It would be a good idea to ask the cook what else they serve. This place is also a grocery store so everything that you order is fresh. There was not one complaint about the food from my friends and I, and we were highly satisfied after finishing our meals.",vjmaCzj6lR7H_4XQp-B9ew,1,0,4,EEH0Yf-2wTmn24TaaHl1dQ

2244832,2017-02-25,2,qQXc9D6PV1Y8RhIBZpj-Jg,"Came here with a bunch of Lao friends.  I have to admit I'm not really a fan of south east asian food, mostly because I'm not a fan of fish sauce.  I can eat it if its hidden, but if i can taste or smell it, then it's a bit of a turn off for me, but when you're in a group you just roll with it.  It's not that i dislike south east asian food, its just not my favorite.

This eatery is located inside an asian grocery store, mostly canned and frozen stuff, a few fresh veggies, some home made sauces and prepared refrigerated items.

My friends got papaya salad both Lao and Thai style, the Lao style is much more pungent and stronger fish sauce taste, i had a bite of both, too much fish sauce for me, but my friends loved it, you can specify the heat level too, they chose 2 chili peppers, they wished they had gone with 1 chili pepper! LOL

We also got the Laab, which i think Vietnamese call Larb, again good but i could taste the fish sauce, but i ate it with a bunch of sticky rice ($1).

We also got beef (meatball) noodle pho, it's probably the safest thing on the menu for me to eat because it was familiar with it and it didn't have fish sauce.  But since I'm adventurous my friend said i should try this other dish which was noodles in a coconut based broth, there was an option for fish or chicken.  I can't remember the name because it was not written on the menu, it was in the chafing dishes behind the counter, and they said it in Lao.  When it came out it looked like a lot of food, the bowl was filled to the top, but the bottom was filled with shredded cabbage, so there wasn't as much noodles as i thought.  The soup reminded me of some thai curry because of the coconut, i added some of the chili oil on the table and it was much better.

We also all got either a Thai iced tea or coffee, ($2) it was good and a very large size for $2 but not as strong as i would have liked it.

For me this type of cuisine is not my style, but my friends who are Lao, say its authentic, they were speaking Lao to the lady behind the counter, and they also offer Thai and Vietnamese type dishes.  Going there they suggested that i get the chicken noodle soup, but it was sold out when we got there, evidently it takes a long time to make and sells out all the time. So for me its 3 stars, but I'm sure if my friends did a review they'd give it 5 stars and i'd go back and try the chicken noodle soup.

They also have some authentic Lao sauces, i took a pic of one of the sauces that i like, i haven't tried the one from the store, but i have tried the one that my friends aunty makes, if its anything like that one, Oh man, that sauce is awesome, i eat it on steak or any grilled meat or even just rice!",0DnQxBz82tU--KsevUFCTw,4,2,3,vNgm_PLWTTLaZeM6qsE96g

The papaya salad which is $6, a good helping and for a dollar more they can add the crab.
Chicken Noodle soup- $7 also a good size helping. The noodles were perfectly cooked, chewy. Broth was super tasty.
We love their pork jerry too. That about $6 or $7 per pack. 
Larb- $10, it was ok
Sticky rice is $1 per bag.

The only thing I don't like is they kind of skimp out on you if your not Lao or Thai. As many times as I've gone here, they never give me all the extra items for either my larb, the soup or salad. I'm missing the cabage for the papaya salad, missing the extra veggies for the larb, missing the fried garlic or shallots for the soup. Some times they add no garnish to any of the dishes. I constantly have to ask for the items.

2851850,2014-08-27,16,qQXc9D6PV1Y8RhIBZpj-Jg,"Would not be surprised if some people's first impression of the existence of a Laotian grocery store in Las Vegas would play out like the following classic conversation from King of the Hill

Hank: So are you Chinese or Japanese?
Khan: No, we are Laotian.
Bill: The ocean? What ocean?
Khan: From Laos, stupid! It's a landlocked country in South East Asia between Vietnam and Thailand, population approximately 4.7 million!
Hank: So are you Chinese or Japanese?
Kahn: D'oh! 

There are hole in the walls, and then there are SECRET hole in the walls (the kind you would never stumble across unless you knew it was there), and Laos Asia Market falls under the latter.  Located in a strip mall a few miles off The Strip, one finds a strip of counter space in the back end of a mom/pop Asian grocery store serving up homemade Laotian classics stripped free of all pretense and artifice.  Had it not been for the menu with the handful of offerings displayed on handwritten poster board and a few benches in front of the counter space, one could easily mistake this as simply a work station for prepared foods and miss out on this little oasis of freshly prepared Laotian cuisine.

With two sweet ladies manning the kitchen and patiently taking down orders, my friend and I felt like we were crashing some Laotian grandma's house for a home-cooked meal.  

Green papaya salad comes in two styles, Thai and Lao, the latter being less sweet and sour and more savory and pungent due to heavier emphasis on the fish sauce and less on the lime juice/palm sugar.  With crisp yardlong beans, tomatoes, green papaya and peanuts, there is a slow escalation of spice that builds in the mouth due to the chilies but the cool temperature of the dish keeps it in check.  

Another notable specialty to get is the Nam Khao.  Not sure what that translates to, but I would surmise it would be something along the lines of ""party in one's mouth"", where the RSVP guest list includes chunks of crispy rice, fermented pork sausage, grated coconut, peanuts, cilantro, green onion, shallots, lime juice, fish sauce, hot chilies, and perhaps a few closely guarded mystery guests (who wouldn't want to host that party?) .  Grab a few spoonfuls and wrap them in lettuce, and your mouth will thank you over and over again.  
 
Another solid dish is the Khao Piek Sen (Lao version of chicken noodle soup), and it uses a chewy tapioca udon in a well-simmered chicken stock with crispy shallots, green onion, shredded chicken, and pork blood cubes upon request if you're feeling a little adventurous (having had it in various soups in Asia, it functions more like a morbid form of tofu when it's done properly although I wanted to prepare some of you for the ""bloodcurdling"" reaction some of you may have if they prompt you on this option). 

Having struck up some conversation with a few regulars, I learned that one of the owners relatives used to run Thai Food to Go a few blocks down the street, so solid cooking definitely runs in the family.  Observing their orders, it also appears that the larb served with sticky rice, deep fried fish, and the pho (slightly different seasoning in broth compared to the better known Vietnamese version) are on my list of things to try with future visits. 

Avoid being trapped between Chinese and Japanese fare.   This is an excellent primer on Laotian cuisine in a humble yet hospitable setting providing an authentic medley of flavors straddling between Thai and Vietnamese.  

P.S. The store itself also offers some excellent produce, prepackaged sweet confections, and other hard-to-find ingredients for the home cooks.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,15,14,4,r5eUVMei7WeAz9061O8dcg

My niece and I were craving Lao food because our visit to Ocha was quite dissatisfying this trip so we ventured out and found a Lao Market that actually serves up homemade Lao food in the back of the market.

When you drive out to this place, it kind of makes you wonder if anyone in this area even knows what Lao food is because you won't see very many Asian people around, but don't let that fool you.

The moment we walked into the market, we were greeted warmly as if we've known each other before.  The women at this place really treat you like their family/kids.  Really reminds me of the Lao hospitality back in our homeland.

I ordered 3 of the most commonly eaten dishes in Laos, since my niece is visiting from there and I told her to be the judge.

The kao piak (homemade chicken noodle soup) was on point.  The broth was flavorful and the noodle was the perfect consistency, slightly chewy just the way I like it.

The laab beef was also on point.  Very flavorful and cooked to less than medium--so the meat was not dry or chewy like some other places.

Unfortunately, the papaya salad was too sweet for my liking so I asked for some lime and it still didn't help much.  Next time I'll be sure to ask them to remake it for me so I don't have to adjust the flavor myself.

I even bought a few homemade dessert items from their market, which aren't too easy to find in our area either.  I took them back to Cali and my nephew told me that the desserts taste better than the ones at the Lao markets in the Bay Area and I had to agree with him.

I would've given a 5-star review had my papaya salad came out right, but I will definitely be back and give them another chance...",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,21,21,4,atOCtcqlspJO9VpnMhkdOQ

They have sort of a food court thing in there, it looks very sketchy cooking station with a nice older lady working. 

The food is great. I have never had laos food but I am Asian , the food here taste  very authentic Asian. Certainly looks like an authentic asian restaurant if you know what I mean... ..

Not sure what NAm kao was but tasted fresh, and the rice is crispy! Should try it if you are looking for some interesting Asian food. 

Their sticky rice comes in a bag, pretty good portion I think you can share that between two people.  We also got LAAB , I think nam kao is better . 

The yellow curry Thai chicken soup! Was better than any Thai restaurants!",tNgEWhq55tx3imSAmOkldQ,0,0,5,PQBZZRaCFlEeY4mGGxG85Q

Spoke to a pleasant gentleman on the phone.      Inquiring for their hours of operations  and curious about what type of Laos hot food they had ready made.  Couple hours later as I entered the store I was greeted ""hello, welcome"". by a gentleman at the register. The store is small had good selections of frozen meats/ fish/exotic bugs. Some of their vegetables are fresh and others are wilted. Ready made dipping sauces $6 a container. The two sweet lady working behind the hot deli section, what a gem, they are informative with my many questions. She recommend Laos beef/ beef balls/rice noodle soup, it was hot flavorful, salty/sweet /beefy . Dinning table lined with green plastic cover with utensils and varied selections of condiments salt,pepper, 4 different type of chilies pickled, fresh, in oil & dried and the usual soy sauce, fish sauce, hoisin sauce.  On the menu it had two different type of papaya salad Laos or Thai. Thai papaya I was told are sweet made with fish sauce, salty crab, peanuts. We opted for Laos papaya made with pahdek a fermented fish ( anchovies) with a pungent smell, its sweet, salty, sour with each bite of crunch of the fresh shredded papaya/longbean  goodness . FYI make sure to mention your preferred level of spicy. I ordered to go larb beef, a choice of raw or cooked beef salad. The cooked beef salad were delicious, enhance flavors with variety of herbs , cilantro, lemongrass, basil, mint, rice powder a hint of citrus juice. My dad mention the beef salad was good. 
On my next trip to Las Vegas I will stop in again to try their  ready made desserts  and other selections I  haven't yet tried.",uooptTo6xOXPTRuQ5gxL8g,3,3,4,XAuIMY7z42k_A_Lvw17uDA

I've always wanted to come here to pop in and have a looksee, and the perfect time came after our breakfast at The 50's Diner (Same Strip Mall). This is your smaller mom and pop type operation with not the hugest selection, but sufficient from cookware, to oodles of noodles, bottles of beverages, tons of tapioca cans of condiments and much much more.

 Some of the more unique items I came across is there pickled items-young grapes, gooseberries, tamarind leaves, but sadly, no pickled tea leaves which I was hoping to find so I could duplicate the Burmese Pickled Tea Leaf Salad, a dish which has been MIA for the last couple of years at the Chaiya Monastery Food Fair(Those who know about this tasty dish know what I'm talking about.) Unfortunately this item cannot be found in Vegas (yet.) I did however grab a bag of black sesame seeds for just $1.99 which will come in handy for Black Sesame Creme Brulee, Sesame Toffee, and Black Sesame Ice Cream if and when I get an ice cream maker!

There is also a table with grab and go prepared foods which I spied Sakoo (Steamed Tapioca Dumplings) and other tasty stuff too. I also learned that there is a third kind of taco, a Laotian coconut dessert... LAM also carries some fresh produce and also have a hot food station where you can order off the menu and sit down and dine in. Not too familiar with Laotian food, I'll just refer to fellow Yelpers Christopher S. and Debra W.'s
reviews and pictures before I decide to dine in. Plastic is accepted with a $15 dollar minimum, otherwise you get charged a buckaroo for it. ALOHA!!!

You will see a small kitchen with a menu, a steam table with today's specials and a long table, set up family style. When we went, the table was half full.

We got papaya salad - they do 2 versions - Thai (sweeter and done with fish sauce) and Lao (less sweet and done with anchovy sauce). We also got the Nam Kao (a Lao fried rice - made from a fried rice ball) and the laab (or larb). 

We got the laab extra spicy, since my spice loving brother was with us. He is a tall red-head and they kept asking ""are you sure"" - he was. Make it the way you would eat it he asked them. They did - and were amazed that he ate it all down with great joy! He had never had this dish before and it will be on his list.

The papaya salad was much more fishy than the Thai style - and I loved it! The fried rice is just such a different thing than any other fried rice that it is always a must eat for me.

The steam table had multiple soups, curries, and veggie dishes (alone with a couple of fish dishes) - I wish I had found this place at the beginning of my trip and I would have tried these. Next time for sure!",B0sBOQe-vRFG_T__Lrn4GA,4,2,5,NFzdngpUsC4UMqoDdsyadA

I was thankful to see I wouldn't have to trek across town to Chinatown and attempt to fight traffic on my way home.

I literally walked down every aisle smiling because all the items were familiar to me and that I could make my favorite Laos dish!

I ordered chicken kapoon ($7) and a side of Lao style papaya salad ($6) to dine in.

I would of gave them a 5 Star but the food was too spicy for us to finish the larb or the papaya salad. That was the only downside, it was too spicy. Other than that, I would recommend this restaurant.",GIkSZWvaGmYE-PcWJUowTw,0,0,3,tggPC6kE3e6ztjdIhkbwuw

This space is bigger than the other Laos Market, so it doesn't feel as cramped. They could add a lot more items if they chose to. Prices seemed a bit high, but not outrageous compared to other asian markets. My friend who I took was a happy camper, she came out with over a $100 worth of goodies. My one disappointment was that they didn't carry Coconut water. They had coconut juice but I prefer the water. They had a delicious marinated pork belly at the counter!",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,7,6,4,UzKDhULV30ezCygPpSIS-A

They sell quality curry paste (Mae Anong, Maesri) and have multiple selections for most products.  I can't say the folks who work there are very friendly/customer service oriented... however, when I did initiate a question about vegan options, one female employee that I approached was helpful and answered all of my questions.  She definitely knew her inventory.  Just an FYI - $15 minimum for credit card use (including debit cards) which for a local ethnic mom/pop business, I think is fine. Definitely worth a visit.",j9gW8fdij-ALDtMjEkg0eQ,1,0,4,gMGeopqMcN5Zuq5H7_yUvQ

This small & quaint market is always my go to spot. Especially, If I am in the food for some Thai or Laos food. You cannot go wrong with anything here, especially the papaya salad and larb. And if you love soo moo (fermented pork sausage), they have some of the best here. And their soups, from the chicken noodle to curry soup. 

Gael Kapi (fermented fish hot sauce) & Gael Bong (sweet & thick spicy paste) are two of my favorites sauces you can find here.

The quality and freshness of their prepared food & products is always consistent - fresh and superb. 

Their prices are hard to beat as well when it comes to their fresh produce and food. You might pay a slight premium on other items such as canned or dry good but since this is closer to me and I don't have to go to China town, I am okay with that. 

Again, I cannot stress enough how awesome the staff is here.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,7,8,5,ZKrhq_rmwBXN5P1vjEAkGg
