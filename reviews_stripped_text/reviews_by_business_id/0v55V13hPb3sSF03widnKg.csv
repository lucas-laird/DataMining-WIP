Not clear to the customer and tries to get us out of her face. I told her I want the 6 inch sub of the day and she grabbed a 12 inch sub, so I politely said, ""I wanted the 6 inch"" (Just to make sure) and she vulgarly looked up at me while rolling her eyes at me and said, ""I know"" It left me a bitter taste in my mouth being treated so rudely at a subway cafe on my campus.",6eP5LXCQ9_KQMTQuPEViTA,0,0,1,kZuNKzd076BUC4tDzBenUg

Service is fine, it's a sandwich not rocket science, it's not that bad. Store is clean, kinda small, but come on it is a kiosk shop.

The guy made my sandwich halfway, then left it on the counter to make the other five people's behind me. He finishes mine, then won't even ring it up, so he can go make more. Granted I know he was the only person working the line while the two ladies in the back just sat there and did nothing, it still shouldn't take 15 minutes to make my damn sandwich as well as five other peoples. If anything he's not at fault, the ladies who work there in the morning should be fired.",WQGiKbfq2NFbc8jXCOnUng,0,0,1,RnedndCyIln0f7pFHEdWQA

However, I like that this location is at the north end of campus near the engineering building. I'll snag a sandwich when they open at 9am so I can have it after my class at 11:15. Employees are okay, nothing special, and nothing to complain about.  I like that there's two sides to order at during busy times. I wish the building was bigger to accommodate the long lines, but that's alright. 

Another side note, their soda fountain is always in tip top shape. Never gotten anything flat or weird tasting from it, which is nice.",-YV1yESQXqR3vpIgBjKDsw,1,0,4,XYX4R8JCbiBapAOrrn5gbA
5054186,2013-11-13,0,0v55V13hPb3sSF03widnKg,"PROS: On the dark side of campus. one of the more healthier options. 

They have friendly staff and A clean atmosphere on the inside. 

there are also 2 places to order.

CONS: even with all this, they are still really inefficient. The line can get way too long to wait in. 

there many times that they are under stocked with food items. And some of the items don't taste as fresh as others!

sometimes customer service can get awkward lol, it's not very good.

OVERALL: I always come here because it's closest to my classes, but they could use major improvements!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,2,0,3,HL7zhxggh8varzfloHd8Aw

5386496,2014-08-02,1,0v55V13hPb3sSF03widnKg,"Subway! Market...fresh..every..day? 

Subway is a frequent go-to for me since it's close to my classes and research building, and the $5 foot longs are great for lunch and saving the other half for dinner. I would say this place is pretty standard, compared to others. The staff are usually nice and have gotten my back when I forgot my wallet, or when they just wanna give free cookies (yayy! Shout out to less-young Filipino lady working). The line at this location can be backed up like crazy though, so I try to avoid it as much as possible when 10a classes get out and especially when 1130a classes get out (ay caramba, foreal). Unfortunately, summer hours are limited here and this location is only open during session 3 until 2p. 

I appreciate they have regular iced tea options too! Makes staving off from soda a lot easier.",wxDM6hqyW5OPp5cXzn6F0w,0,0,3,VSWMrsspJsw_OCOz3vs6oQ

My sandwiches turn out fine in terms of taste. The construction of my sandwich is always questionable because of this Asian guy who seems like he has a hard time when he is working, which he is. I noticed he was there for about a year now, but it does not seem like he got better. My sandwiches are always overstuffed or they are falling apart when I eat it! Make sure to specify how much dressing or sauce you want or else you're sandwich will be drenched in it.",rTSBDuGLi3rKojaeEwzZ9w,0,0,3,ojz39hwxSHgaThZZVZntfw
