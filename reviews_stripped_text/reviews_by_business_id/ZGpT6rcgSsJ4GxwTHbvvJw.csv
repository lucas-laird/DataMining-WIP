And boy are they huge and good... It came with a drink and vege eggrolls.... All for under $20!!! I am giving it 5 stars because of quick service, big portions and great price... Only gripe would be... Not enough beef in the beef and broccoli and the orange chicken, although very good and meatier then others that I have had, the sauce needs more zip to it... Amazing chicken fried rice and chicken chow mien which came with the dinners.... We will definitely come back!!!! They also deliver up to 3 miles....

It was the worst! $35.00 I spent on a meal in a long time, and I did used their  $5.00 off coupon they provided (if you spend over $35, my bill came to $38, I included a small tip)

I ordered combination fried rice and it was tasteless, greasy and very blah....not good

I ordered lemon chicken and the ""chicken"" was too thin and over fried, I immediately noticed an odd taste to the ""chicken"" so I didn't finish it

The Curry Beef was ok for Chinese curry I guess, I wouldn't order it ever again though, if you like Thai Curry, this is nothing like it!

And lastly, the Mu Shu Shrimp, I still haven't decided if it was ok or not, one bite I would be ok, then the next I'd want to spit it out!

1837043,2015-08-25,8,ZGpT6rcgSsJ4GxwTHbvvJw,"New Chinese spot- they specialize in lunch specials and takeout, but food quality is better than your average mom-and-pop Panda Express. Food is fresh and menu has more options than expected, including boba drinks and spam musubi, but dishes are of the more Americanized style that is all too easy to find elsewhere.

Lunch specials are around $7, dinner specials are $9, but I opted to try the lettuce wraps- available in chicken, shrimp, vegetable, or combination. I found it odd this dish was listed in the ""Chef Specialties"" section, but the $9 chicken portion I received was enough for two meals with several lettuce leaves, more than enough filling, and a giant heap of rice.

Note that though they highlight their takeout and low prices, but food is cooked to order and it can take a bit longer than you might expect. Consider calling ahead if you're in a hurry.

EDIT: This is now my go-to boba stop in Summerlin, because it's always perfectly cooked. The huge NY style eggrolls are awesome and packed with bbq pork and shrimp, two easily make a meal!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,6,3,V4BcyVtTSlpRm2dorzZOpw

This is the 3rd restaurant I've tried and I have to say that it's by far the BEST. I had the New York egg rolls which were huge and delicious. Tons of filling with fresh vegetables. In my 36 years in Vegas (from Brooklyn) I have to say that the New York egg rolls were the best I have had.

I ordered the Hot and Sour soup. Very tasty. The broth was delicious and had some heat but not overpowering. It also had fresh ingredients that added to the soup but did not overpower it. Again, I highly recommend the soup.

The Orange Chicken and Beef with onions and peppers were fantastic.  Huge portions and great deals for the cost.

The only complaints I have are that the barbecue pork was a little dry and the chicken fried rice had dark meat chicken. I would have preferred white chicken in the rice.

I am so glad to have such a good restaurant in my neighborhood.  I did look over all the reviews before placing my order but was more confused because they're either really bad or really good.

Wait was not long.  Food cooked where I can see it being wok'd up.  It was fresh, hot, and smelled super appetizing to my nostrils.  Good flavor!  AND they prepared it in to go containers PLUS gave me a plate and utensils to dine in.  

Singapore curry noodles: has chicken, shrimp, BBQ pork.  I didn't expect this much ingredients but it was delish!
Chinese Eggplant with Tofu: can be ordered spicy.  I chose none since Sriracha was on the table.  Very nice sweetness to it.  Squirt some sriracha and taste buds are having a party!

Because I wanted egg rolls from Pho Rose, I ordered the NY style egg roll, $1.99 a roll. I was already full from my lunch, that I had to take it to go. The egg roll was larger than the box they gave me so I had to cut it in half to make it fit.

3644496,2016-01-07,0,ZGpT6rcgSsJ4GxwTHbvvJw,Maybe I'm spoiled from Chinese food from the northeast but this was awful. I ordered egg rolls and what I received were spring rolls. The orange chicken was made from tough dark meat and about half of it was inedible. The ginger beef had a bizarre sulfur taste to it. They claim to not use MSG but the use of my epi pen tonight states otherwise. Don't waste your time. Panda Express has better food than this.,_a7qIRvTFBH_BaliW7k23w,1,0,1,qBKO2dD_GwBzsGmYCFjYBw

3733605,2015-10-22,0,ZGpT6rcgSsJ4GxwTHbvvJw,"This china food restaurant opened recently near to my office. Actually, I live on the other side of the tow, but this is just close to my office. And I decided to check out what they are doing and what kind of food are cooking.

First step inside. The smell. It smells on food and vegetables but the smell is not so strong. In some places is so strong that stays as a perfume with your clothes. 

The place is not so big inside, however there is a lot of room for big groups. As you might guess the noise level is average to loud.

Fast. The guys from the staff are working very fast and seems they are concentrated in their work. Cashiers are working fast too. I mean the speed of the line is really good. I needed 4 - 5 minutes from choosing the order to the first bite.

Quality of food. Good the food is just good - fresh hot and tasty. But everyone has it own taste, so I am just evaluating the quality and the freshness. 5 stars for the food.

As a typical chines restaurant, the variety of dishes is great. Almost no matter what you chose, a decent meal will cost you between 6 and  9 dollars. Two portions are more than enough for 3 persons. Take off is allowed too.",sYTkM61YrjaIH46-grSkAA,1,0,4,KML5wCICG6ZaDE1CtaS3Dw

The waitress was not very friendly, almost seemed rushed and they weren't even busy at all.  One of my friends the Tsing Tao dinner plate, the other ordered the beef broccoli and my daughter and I shared the shrimp fried rice, salt and pepper shrimp and salt and pepper chicken.

For the better part of 10 years, my hands had been tied because I had only one Chinese restaurant that delivered to me.
Not that it was bad or anything, but it's always nice to have a choice.
Then, I got a flyer in my door for this place, so I was pretty much guaranteed that they would deliver to me.
The food was very good, and reasonably priced.
My only complaint was that they took over an hour to get the food to me, when I was used to getting it within 15 minutes.
It was Saturday night, and they were very apologetic, but I see from the other reviews, that they are slow in general.
The next time I order from them, I'll just prepare myself for the extra wait time.

Its your typical chinese restaurant with a few tables, and mostly food to go orders. They do deliver within 3 miles if you are so inclined.

I went with my standard crab rangoon, and this was a standard crab rangoon. Big crispy wonton wrapper with a mediocre amount of rangoon. Same as you get everywhere so probably pre-packaged. 3/5

Next was BBQ pork and vegetables. This was steaming hot when I got home 6 minutes later and it was good, but again, nothing out of the ordinary. Pork lacked a little of that BBQ flavor. Nice selection of veggies and a decent sauce. 3/5

Thai tea with boba - I liked this version because you get a strong tea flavor mixed in with the milky part. Boba was plentiful, I wasn't even able to finish all the boba in the drink. 4/5

Extensive menu with many options, broken down into pork, chicken, beef, etc. Chinese food lovers will find something they like. I'm not a huge Chinese food fan, so not sure if I'll return for anything other than a Boba tea.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,4,3,3,WJ6Z57Yr_emGUcsh-YDzGw
