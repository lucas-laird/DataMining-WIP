18046,2017-05-06,0,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,Excellent bbq.  The best meat were Harami Miso skirt steak and Premium rib eye.  Surprisingly Filet Mignon was not as tender.  The other popular dishes were Spicy Tuna Volcano and Chicken Garlic Noodle were very tasty.  This would be a must go eatery in Vegas.,vSvDwAnOD9G_HCrusAxOQg,0,0,5,RGSn-SEWcM_v86YWTB3Dnw

We (my husband and I) had the Surf and Turf option for two at $77.77  It included edamame, dumplings, broccoli and cheese fondue, miso soup, salad, ahi poke, salmon, garlic shrimp, bibimbap, marinated skirt steak (our favorite) and american style kobe beef along with veggies for grilling and to top it all off smores!  

Ryan our server was extra attentive!  The food came promptly and Ryan instructed us on exactly how long to cook the various food items as well as what sauce would complement them.  Before we cooked the kobe style beef, Ryan even came to switch out our grill so it would be fresh for that beautiful cut of meat.  

There was so much food, we were stuffed to the gills and still had leftovers to bring home.  

Both managers stopped by our table to ensure or experience was exceptional.  It was a nice touch.  We made a reservation in advance, but it was Monday night and we probably didn't need one.  It was nice not to have to wait for long amounts of time like other BBQ places.  We were definitely impressed and will be back again!",l0ib_TpZWaUj0m9S65S1lA,0,0,5,cvRjgt_0D9y7TnS9H74f5Q
32108,2015-02-26,3,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"I discovered this place while I was on vaca in Hawaii. I was so excited to find that there was one in vegas. Originally I was going to give a 4 star review, but the hostess was so bad, she cost them a star. As I walked in she was texting on her cellphone, openly. She rudely insisted that she could seat my party until they were all here, even tho I said they were parking the car and walking in. She showed us the table and literally dropped the menus at the table. When I made the reservation I specified I needed a hair chair so before she left I requested a highchair. She barely glanced back and said they don't have highchairs they have boosters.  My son cannot sit up by himself yet, so he could not use the booster. This is a Japanese BBQ place, so I could not assist with cooking, I had to hold my son throughout my dinner. 

Besides the useless hostess, the food is amazing here. The happy hour will only give you about a dollar off, but considering how many dishes you typically order, it's worth it. Don't be cheap with the meat! The hanger steak is about $7 but totally worth ordering at least 3 servings!


I went back in a few months later per the request of Aki, the VP. The ""manager"" Tracy was so resistant to help us. She only stopped by to review the bill embarrassingly in front of my guests. Tracy felt that a $12 discount compensating for my previous experience. That's ok. I won't have to waste anymore time or money at that place.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,4,0,1,VIyK71ggmLLkXk36H07DeA
54637,2017-04-12,0,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"The only thing this place has going for it is that it presents itself as a Japanese yakiniku restaurant, and not just another Korean BBQ place.  There is a subtle difference, and there are far too many of the latter, not enough of the former in America.  

But that's the only good thing I'll say about it.  Food was terrible.  I mean, I really don't know how you screw up raw meat and dipping sauce, but they managed.  Pork belly was inedible; had a funny taste, like it had been washed in soapy water or something.  Beef was flavorless and tough.  Only three dipping sauces, and not a one tasted decent (okay... the Ponzu was alright.  Nothing special, but not nearly as terrible as their Sweet or Spicy Shoyu).  Rice was mushy.  The night I went, they were also out of mixers for half their cocktails, which is inexcusable from a restaurant that's directly across the street from a grocery store.  

Maybe for locals who've never traveled, the dining experience would be different enough they might enjoy it.  But for someone who's had the real thing, and can make better at home, it's a waste of time and money.  Oh, and my stomach hurt for two hours after eating there; no clue what that was about, since I certainly didn't gorge myself.",tBq0yRNADmew3cdCzidBJg,0,0,2,zMMnyBzuSeEhgfSNx8N7Cw

I ordered chicken karage as a starter. To my surprise it came to the table poorly executed. Chicken was not fried properly to even look crisp and not to mention it was cold. Outter layer became mushy, made it seem it has been previously fried and was returned to kitchen to be brought out again for ordering guests. Food runner came to ask if everything was alright, quickly said the dish was cold and not hot. He immediately apologized and took the dish and walked away. Within 5 minutes the manager came by with the dish and called out chicken karage and set it on our table. It was the same... cold and not fried properly, there was not even a slight steam trail that I can see. Server finally approached table and asked if things were alright. I did not intend to be abrubt but two times I have complained and the same result has come to the table. I do not understand if it was cooked and just waiting to be served it was absolutely not freshly prepared. 
Ordered egg soup and it was warm to touch not hot. No steam!!! Same as miso soup nothing was hot nothing was cooked properly!
Meat was OK to taste, I have had better.
I will not be going to this restaurant for quite some time. I feel the servers and whoever runs the place have no experience in the food business of ensuring satisfied guests. No one was attentive enough. If I will be paying $145 for my meal I expect service and QUALITY.  Only takes one chance for a first impression.

A little bit disappoint on their beef tongue. It is $8.99 per dish with around 8 pieces. Tasteless and very thin slice. Happy hour beer only $2.99. Veggie dish is excellent too. We have mushroom medley and spinach garlic.  

Good service provided, our server Yoshi is very helpful and explain the menu and cooking time for each dishes. 

They also have 2 people set menu starting at $45 for happy hour period which is from 12 pm to 5 pm. Love this restaurant and Will come back again. Recommended!

I'm very used to eating undercooked meats and Japanese BBQ, so I don't know why my stomach is not taking it well. Other than that, the meat quality is pretty good, but the beef tongue was a big disappointment. I love beef tongue and I always order it when I have Japanese BBQ, but the quality just wasn't good. I didn't enjoy the Harami miso steak that was 1/2 off either. The butterfish was really good and so was the Kalbi beef. My favorite part of the dinner was the dessert, Lady M. Green tea Crepe cake. The service was good and the staff were all very friendly and helpful, but the meats were just OK to me and having such a terrible stomach ache doesn't help either.

My favorites are toro beef (beef bacon) and yaki-shabu (beef chuck). They are thin slices and take less than a minute on each side to cook. Part of the reason they are my fav is cuz they cook the fastest! Haha. Filet mignon and harami miso steak are also very good, of course. 

Try the buttered or cheese corn, bacon chips, garlic rice, and miso soup in between the grill changes ;)

1027853,2016-08-29,0,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"When I lived in Japan I was close to a Gyu-Kaku and I went there a couple of times every month for AYCE. The service, the quality of the meat and the overall experience were always top-notch. The prices were good too.

So when I found out they were opening a Gyu-Kaku here in Vegas I was pretty stoked. The Korean BBQ places are a good substitute but not the same. I've been a few times since the opening and have always found the food to be good and the service is on point too. I usually make reservations to be safe but I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes when I just walk in for dinner.

For whiskey fans they have a good selection of Japanese whiskys at the bar and the prices are good too. Bartender told me that their price on Hibiki is the lowest in the valley. I can't verify that but it was low enough for me to throw back a couple of glasses before dinner without thinking twice.

Gyu-Kaku doesn't do AYCE in Vegas (I don't think they do it in CA either) but they have some great meal plans that will bring out enough meat and veggies to where you will be full when you are done. Its more expensive than some of the Korean AYCE BBQ places, but you are paying for quality here.",vT4dgd0ufV_WUep6lUre1g,0,0,5,wBlggaXQsTV2A8LuQNQR-g

I see their ""B"" rating is posted.  Yipes.

Finally took our order and after waiting a little bit, our drinks and food start to arrive.
Wine glasses were not polished (water spots and lips on both glasses)... :-(

First item - calamari.  Cold but tasty for hungry people.  Appetizers and vegetables start arriving as well.  Edamame - ok, Broccoli with cheese - yum!, Garlic Fried Noodles - ok, Asparagus - ok, Garlic Chicken - yum!, Mushroom Medley - good, Cheese Wontons - ok, but where's the cheese?, Salad - good.

Meats start arriving and we start cooking.  Everything tasty but kind of gristly, at least on the pieces I ate.  We start getting full.  Lots of food for the Meat-Lovers Course.

Many items were forgotten that we needed to ask for...garlic sauce, miso soup, rice, refills on water.

Our last item was the S'mores which were delicious.  My sweet lovin' teeth concurs.

I like all different kinds of food. I had never done this style of table-top grilling before, and so decided to try it out. 

I started out with a ""Southern Mai Tai"". 
I should have read the menu a bit closer, because it is actually nothing at all like a Mai Tai. It tasted like cool aid with booze. (The ""Southern"" was Southern Comfort. Not a fan.)

We ordered several plates from beef to veggies. When they arrived, I asked the server for her recommendation on cook times. She casually listed them off, ""30 seconds each side for the scallops, 45 seconds total for the beef..."" Sadly, should could not have been more wrong. Either she was terribly misinformed or the grill was awfully cool. 

The scallops took about five minutes to become opaque. The beef took several minutes - even though the slices were very thin.

Folks here talk about the great prices. I suppose it depends on what you order. Four dollars for four stalks of asparagus? I'd say that's a bit steep. ...and then you have to cook it. 

... and it is all cooked on a smoke-free gas grill - which adds no flavor at all. I love smokey flavors - especially in a 'grill' or 'barbeque' meal. 
Give me a cast-iron skillet and a campfire any day.

Spices were modest to the point of being absent. Conversely, the sauces on the table were overpowering. Not recommended.

The Bibimbop was fine. The salmon was also fine once it cooked - but again, I can do better at home.

Good company and a friendly server made this a good hang.

Walking into this restaurant, I really liked how they decorated this place. The dark woods, and mellow atmosphere really gave it a sexy vibe. I was digging it.

Gyu-Kaku might have the best grills I have ever seen. What makes them so great are the little vents that surrounds the grill. This makes the smoke disappear quickly, rather than engulf your clothes in meat smoke, which tends to happen at k-bbqs.

The first thing I ordered were the cheese wontons. Out of everything that I had ordered, this proved to be my least favorite. When I was thinking of a cheese wonton, I expected there to be a full pocket of cheese. That was not to be the case. Instead, there was the tiniest sliver of cheese that could be known to mankind. I should have taken a picture of that.

Then my meats came. I thought they were alright. I thought it was good, but I guess I was expecting more. Even though I came in during happy hour, I ordered like three dishes and spent quite a bit on them. Afterwards, I had to go buy a cheeseburger at a take out joint nearby because I was still pretty hungry.

The service here was not very good. The guy taking our order was very nice and accommodating, but he seemed lost at times. I constantly had to flag him down. And, he did mess up our order at the end of the night, charging us for extra things that we didn't order, but we were quickly able to fix the situation.

Not disappointed at all most of the marinades we tried were miso based all of it were good. Filet Minon did not have a marinade still ended up pretty decent. Cheese Gyoza were OK, The salads we really liked. We finished dinner with Smore's which is a pleasant surprise since you are at a BBQ place why not smores right? Overall dinner was very good.

Location - Spring mountain and Decatur Cross Streets Asia Town, I prefer calling this place asia town instead of china town since it  is frequented by multiple Asian Ethnicity The parking is in the back and the entrance is facing the road.

  First off head down for Happy hour, Monday & Wednesday is all day! What crazy right, well its so worth it. Tuesday&Thursday-Sunday is 12pm -6:30pm and 9pm-12:30am. During these times hit up the appetizers and sides for the best deal.
   Now on the BBQ meat and seafood section just about the same great selection.  Hirami Miso and the Kalbi short rib are a must but don't be afraid to get the Angus beef rib. This might be the best kept secret on the menu! The mushrooms are a must the garlic mushroom is my favorite...

  If this is your first time, start with one of the Value BBQ course for 2. These will give you a great sample of what they have to offer. Just choose what works best you and your party. The best part is after your meal the dessert is they pull off the grill and bring you S'mores.

That's for a reason - here in the US beef is obtainable cheaper than in Japan, which makes it possible that Gyu-kaku offers higher quality beef without pricing really high like many other Japanese yakiniku-ya do.

Their execution is solid in fact - meat with decent quality, great service, cool ambience. I must admit that now I'm a fan. ;)",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,2,1,4,4Oog67ecWjgVi4KAkPc-WA

I love the concept of sitting around a table grilling your dinner and sharing with friends!  This place can easily be the scene of an intimate dinner for 2 or a large group which we happen to be on this occasion. 

Upon entering you are warmly greeted by the host and on this visit our large group was seated promptly. The place is nicely designed and the atmosphere is fresh and welcoming. 

There are so many choices and the pricing is very reasonable. You can do a la cart or enjoy their course menu.  We tried their special of the day which was Harami Skirt Steak, and we also ordered their Bistro Hanger Steak, Shishito peppers, bacon wrapped asparagus and their Shrimp Sukiyaki Bibimbap.   All were delicious but my favorite of the night was the Harami Steak which was so tender and made for the best grilled meat in my opinion. 

Our server was very attentive and informative.  She changed our grill a couple of times and she made her presence known to us throughout our time here ensuring all was good. She really added to the dining experience and had no problem splitting up our checks.   

They apparently hold a high standard here in both food and service as it shows, and just to make sure all is in order and they are in compliance they ask you to fill out a survey after your meal.

Service was well, but our waitress had many responsibility to other tables and took a while to oil or grill. We had to ask waiter to do it for us because she took too long. It's understandable, yet when she brought us our meats she did say she was coming back. 

This time I decided to get the meal plan because I would save a few bucks $$$, and get to try different appetizers and meats I haven't before. It's great and satisfies my belly! I SUGGEST getting a meal plan then adding more sides or meat, it's a better deal.

I've been here many time but finally found the time to review this place. Gyu-Kaku's meat selection is great and the prices aren't too bad. I like Japanese BBQ because the grills and vents are different from Korean BBQ. When you leave gyu-kaku you won't leave smelling like oily meats. Happy hour deals are awesome!

SERVICE
Their service was wonderful, they are knowledgable on the items on the menu. They check if you're doing well with the food and change your grill when needed. The servers also tell you how much time is needed to cook your meat and vegetables. 

FOOD
Good quality meat but portions not great. My favorite is beef tongue and it comes with small portions unfortunately. They offer spicy, sweet soy, and ponzu sauce. The ponzu sauce goes well with most of the meats (for my preference). Ponzu is citrusy and it's refreshing. The sweet soy seems familiar to Maggie's soy sauce but sweeter. The spicy is a mix of garlic and spices.

CONCLUSION
Will be back to try lunch deals!",SNHHpdXqxZFMBTTbKsBrAA,2,1,4,z-fcmiHDi5wErYZTR2WV9Q

The mushrooms medley were good but once again a bit too salty for my taste. There are 3 sauces to dip in so I think thy should have went lighter on the marinate. The dessert was suppose to be a green tea cake with ice cream but instead it came with whip cream which is in no way shape or form a good substitute for ice cream, I was very disappointed with that!

The entrance to this perceived Japanese   BBQ place is pretty amazing with its door framed lights, pretty befitting for it's placement in Las Vegas. 

However I would be stretching it by saying it should be categorized as a Japanese BBQ restaurant. There was definitely a DIY BBQ pit in the center of the table, which is always the expectation but the menu was not what we expected. The quality of the meats were good but very thick cuts for BBQ beefs and the lean meats. Also everything came pre-marinaded, which is something definitely not Japanese like plus the marinades were all very sweet for my taste. There were also lots of Korean dishes that also were on the menu, I felt this place was more of a Korean Japanese inspired BBQ restaurant and really should be categorized that way.

I think this place is definitely worth for its happy hour prices , their regular prices are pretty expensive and that sht adds up quickly. They have an AYCE option (although more expensive than KBBQ AYCE) and your whole table needs to be doing that option too.

I was afraid but the taste was amazing. The miso skirt steak and the garlic soy prime rib are to die for!

We stood at the host stand for 2 minutes wondering if anyone was working. Saw the bartender and a couple of servers from where we were standing, but still no greeting towards us. Finally, the manager came out nonchalantly with no apology for us waiting, and casually brought us to our table which was still not clean. By not clean, I mean that it looked like someone just wiped the tabletop quickly and called it a day. There was a used napkin under the table from the previous guests, a vent had fallen off the grill which was laying at my feet, not to mention food crumbs. For how empty the restaurant was, I was dumbfounded that the attention to detail was lacking. I could see the same situation with food crumbs underneath other tables from where I was seated. Looked like they haven't cleaned and mopped their floors in god knows how long. Also, the 3 glass bottles on the table which housed the sauces for the meats were sticky and hadn't been wiped down either. Super gross.

I know the meats are usually pre-marinated, but I felt they were over-marinated and too salty. Not many vegetable options either.

Our server was nice, but nice doesn't cut it. He would disappear for lengths of time, especially after we were done with the meats. I didn't even bother to order dessert, and the check took forever to hit our table.

Definitely start with the SPICY CABBAGE SALAD, skip the miso soup. The ""spicy tuna volcano"" (AKA spicy tuna crispy rice, $4 for 4 pieces during HH) was not as good as others in town, but the shrimp ponzu tacos were crispy and adventurous.

As for the meats: choose 3/person and add a bowl of the GARLIC RICE to share. I love that it's served in stone bowl to crisp up and tossed tableside. Definitely get the TONGUE WITH SCALLION SAUCE and the GARLIC SHRIMP ($4 for 4 shrimp, currently on special, regularly $7). If you don't like garlic and onions, maybe don't bother because those were the best dishes.

Other solid options were the spicy gochugang pork belly, bistro hangar steak, toro beef, and basil chicken- all good but not great, smaller portions than other similar style restaurants for similar prices. 

Seems to be more of a place to go with a group and drink while lingering over the food, rather than as a date.

We didn't get our waters refilled NOT ONCE. I ended up drinking my sons water in his kid cup because I didn't have water. We needed forks for the kids, asked for forks, he forgot.. we asked again... he forgot again. We ended up walking to the kitchen and asking for forks. 

It took about 15-20 min to bring our meats out... we were the only ones in the restaurant. It wasn't like they were busy. How is it gonna take long to bring out raw meat on plates? 

Then we asked for a second round of meat halfway through our meal, and they didn't come out until we were ready to leave. We ended up canceling the meat. 

Our edamame came to our table about 5 minutes before we left. Our food was eaten already. EDAMAME IS AN APPETIZER. How can you not even bring edamame on time??? 

We won't be back. At least not to this location.",WprLWLMfdlbstGuCQvUHJQ,0,0,1,TeZDqXv0ayndCMFp1NmQbg

We stopped on a sat afternoon on a road trip from Southern California and decided this was a good spot to refuel and have dinner. There was 1 older gentleman as our waiter, serving 4 tables (we were one of them). Our meat took much longer than we have ever had to wait..and it was HH portions. We were first served our veggies- corn and spinach. Consumed that and our meat was still not served. Finally our meat arrived. Just one 6 slices of garlic steak. Our next 2 orders did not arrive until let's put it this way- the grill was already burnt and charred.  Those next two orders of meat were hard to even flip over, again, obviously because the grill was burnt and charred! We alerted our waiter, asking if we can change grill, and he just lowered the temperature of the grill. That was pretty annoying, esp since we are regulars at this place and our waiters change our the grill even before we have to ask. To be honest, after sitting in the car for a road trip for 4 hours and not having the normal practice standards of this establishment was quite annoying! This waiter needs to keep up with this place or management will be (if not already) hearing ALOT of complaints since this place gets busy.",FFBG3zRi7u3szTIxiD6pHg,0,0,2,J_dXPzuSLfozIa7zQEjuLw
1851098,2016-04-19,5,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"I love the whole idea gyu kaku has, the cook your own meats but the meats are also a lot better quality than most Korean BBQ around in Vegas. In fact I think this is the only Japanese BBQ and the pricing id say is $-$$ so not bad!
Around 11 pm - close you best go in for their happy hour! A lot of the stuff is way cheaper and you can get way more appetizers or you can choose the combos where they come with all these picked meats for certain pricing. I love the ambience you never feel rushed to eat, but sometimes you feel the service is slow too. The customer service though has always been good everytime I eat here and at least they check up on us occasionally. I think the fact you take time to cook your food is what fills you up quicker. My favorite meats are the filet mignon, the Cajun shrimp, the butterfish, and the salmon (fish person much? I know lol.) anyways if you want dessert they also have macaron ice cream sandwiches! They're so cute haha and there's like 4 different flavors. I'd say you'd best take your date here or double date! It's the perfect place to go!",EYwvNonD5kUGGNRTGjAAHA,7,6,4,6X0pm7FtdAB_soKLBtrFew

I eat rare steaks pretty often, so my body can handle a little rareness, but after eating here, my stomach has been turning for the past few days.  After several reviews that mention food poisoning and hair found in their food...cleanliness doesn't seem to be one of their main priorities here.  I sincerely hope it doesn't turn out like another Firefly's fiasco.

Besides that, the special drinks they have looked like it was created by a 12 year old.  I'll stick to the Sapporo...which by the way was a bit on the warm side.  

The service was a bit ""meh.""  I understand its a new restaurant and all, but the servers were inattentive and some of them looked confused even.  Not a very well organized restaurant in my opinion, and definitely needs a LOT of improvement to live up to the Gyu Kaku namesake.  I've eaten at the ones in Japan and I was SO looking forward to this one popping up in Vegas.  This was a complete let down.

Don't walk in expecting to become super full unless you have a small stomach or are ready to shell out some money! I think around $20-25 per person would be good to adequately fill someone up. I always /have/ to get a bowl of rice in order to help fill me up when I usually don't get one,

For the appetizers, my favorites are the Ahi Tuna Poke, Spicy Tuna Volcano, & Wakame Seaweed Salad. It's been a while since I've had the Ahi Tuna and the Spicy Tuna, but I remember that I definitely enjoyed those the most. Out of all of the meats I've tried, the Toro Beef & the Harami Miso Skirt Steak are definitely my favorites. The Harami definitely has the most flavor out of the ones I've tried. Honestly, all the meats are packed with a lot of flavor; however, I remember the New York Steak not being too special for me. If I had to suggest meats for first timers, get the Harami, Toro Beef, Bistro Hanger Steak, & Filet Mignon.

The price is a little too high for me with the portions that are given for each item, but the quality is definitely there. They also provide sweet soy, spicy, and ponzu sauces for your meat, but you don't really need it since you don't have to worry about the meat not having any flavor.

I can't see myself going to Gyu-Kaku unless it's during Happy Hour since the price/portion ratio seems a little off to me. Kudos for having a Gyu-Kaku app to collect reward points to redeem for future visits! Definitely scan all of your receipts every time you go here since every little point counts. Every time I go back, I always get a free Toro Beef since I keep scanning my receipts from the last visit.",8RuySv_b1YVWVK_0mMqKOw,6,3,4,ya04qD7Rch49pzRaD2lWvQ

At a First,exteriors&interiors are awesome with the lights
Service was great but quality of meats are HORRIBLE.
Colors of meats are grossly dark.
No marblings at all. 
Tastes are gross.
So me&my friend decided to drink beer instead of eating that gross foods.
But there was an happy hour for beer allyoucandrink, the manager (he called his self manager) never tell us they have offers for drinks.
Cause he want us to pay double whenever we order beers. So stupid.
We sat about 30mins, they force us to pay and get  out the restaurant.(there was many tables include us,and it was only10pm) Even though my beers just got opened. If you guys gonna close soon and gonna let us kick out,then why you take the orders for beer?? not giving services and foods but wants money from customer?

The meats were very flavorful, tender and delicious. Now let's move on to the service. When we arrived, we literally stood there for 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged that we were there. Second our service at the table was horrible. Anyone that knows me, knows I value customer service. We had to ask for spoons, sweeteners, forks, and napkins repeatedly. It took 20 minutes before we actually saw those items. I had to ask a bus person finally. When the waiter spilled my drink on me, I blew it off. Accidents happen right? But from that moment on, everything went down hill. They took forever bringing the food out to us. Given the fact it was a little busy, we blew that off too. But the worst part of it all.... wait for it ... we had to wait 40 minutes for our checks to get right. And when I say get right, he came to us and asked how we were paying. We had to split it 3 ways. Our waiter literally acted as if we asked for something illegal. He went away to ""handle "" our check. He was gone for 25 minutes. 25 minutes!! It finally took a manager to go over there and help him with the check. Then they had the nerve to add on another $14 per group for gratuity.

Interior was nicely decorated with a fusion of traditional and modern Japanese elements throughout.  Music, on the other hand, can be overbearing as EDM blast through the speakers.  Nonetheless, ambiance is perfect for a date night or dinner with a group of friends.

Haven't really considered of going back to any KBBQ joints since dining at this restaurant for the first time!  Consider it some sort of awakening due to the array of items one can enjoy in such great quality.  No AYCE here but they do offer different full course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 that can easily feed 2-4 people.  They also have Happy Hour specials from 1700-1830 and 2100-closing with several discounted items from the menu.

One thing I'd like to point out is how awesome their grills are.  Small vents actually surround the cooking area which makes the smoke dissipate before it can even engulf guests so they don't end up smelling like grilled meat afterwards.

We usually opt for their meat lover's course which is a great way to sample different cuts of meat in various marinades.  The meal starts out with miso soup and house salad as well cheese wontons and garlic fried chicken.  The spread is then followed by the main entree comprised with six different meat items.  To top it all off, s'mores to end the dinner; grill comes off so guests can toast marshmallows straight on the heat.

Overall, Gyu-Kaku is definitely the better alternative to KBBQ...better yet, a great replacement if I must say.  Top notch food quality and superb customer service.  Can't wait for our next meal in this establishment!

The best thing I had all night was the spicy ahi volcano complete with crispy rice. Worst was the ahi poke. But of course nothing compares to the way poke is served in Hawaii.

The grill here is great! The air vent is in the grill so you won't leave smelling like BBQ. 

So ordered off the hour and regular menu. Most of the meats were overly marinaded and sweet. Which I didn't like. I really liked the harami and kalbi. The Kobe style flat iron steak was very dry. It was like a dried carne sada without the marinade. 

We also order a full house salad which was very small for the price $5.50. The cheese corn was good but SERIOUSLY felt skimped on corn. It was only like 2 tablespoons in the foil for $5? 

We got s'mores at the end and that was fun to eat! I would def recommend only ordering off happy hour

We went twice last week, once for dinner and a couple days later for lunch. For our first visit we did the all-you-can-eat menu (the most expensive one) which was great. My favorite thing about the AYCE menu is that the desserts are also AYCE. Yup, all you can eat macaron ice cream sandwiches. When we returned for lunch we each ordered a 3-4 item lunch. It was 1/3 the price of dinner but we ate the same amount of food. If you can really throw down, go for the ultimate AYCE. Otherwise, you might be better off going smaller. 

My faves: bone-in kalbi, harami miso skirt steak 
Hubby's faves: spicy yaki shabu beef, premium ny steak

Which comes with a better selection. Starting off the dumplings with chili oil and the karaage were an instant banger. We then kept ordering beef after beef and was highly impressed with the quality of the food. Already I was leaning towards Japanese bbq than Korean.

2178527,2016-06-23,4,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"The Skinny: the grilled meats are good quality but the side dishes are not that impressive (3) service: good and efficient. Not smoky/smelly for a yakiniku place - no changing table in the restroom.(4) value: recommend coming in for lunch on Wednesday (all day happy hour) as the lunch combinations are the things to get. 10% locals discount can be used with coupons offered through their app. (3.5 starred review)

Since Opentable.com now only offers rewards at limited restaurants in Vegas, we are more likely to hit this place more often (can be redeemed here and Buca Di beppo....I frankly prefer here).

Lunch is way better pricing than dinner so we hit them up for their lunch sets. I usually get their Meat lover's set for $10.95 which comes with 4 types of meat at 2oz each, a small salad, gyoza, soup and rice. It's a good portion of food and quite filling. They also have a create your own options are well at $9.95 for 2 BBQ items and $12.95 for 3 items which comes with soup, salad and rice. They also have non-grilled lunch sets like to the hamburger steak or bibimbap bowl for less than $13.

The meats are the highlights here.  The quality here is pretty good.The marinated meats are slightly on the sweeter side and very tender. Cooking over the grill is nice due to the great ventilation system (i.e. not smelly or too smokey). 

The miso soup is pretty standard. The salad is largely made of daikon and kind of heavy on the mayo. Gyoza also ho-hum and I probably would not order it unless it was in a set.

For dessert, they have Lady M green tea crepe cake brought in... probably from LA. Ours was served with ice cream even though the signs in the restaurant says that it doesn't. (Maybe it's just me but I don't know what all the fuss is about.) They also have macaroon ice cream sandwiches from Brick (it's an LA thing) which I haven't tried but am pretty intrigued.

Service is good and fast generally. Ambience is modern with loud dance music playing. As for bringing kids here, I guess kids and grills don't mix well - hence the lack of changing tables in the bathroom. Just saying.

The value here is when you apply the discounts here on top of coming in for lunch. Locals get 10% off, dinner sets for 2 are 20% off on Saturday and Sunday. Get their app for additional coupons towards dining.

We started with some fried potstickers and ahi tuna poke, which were both pretty good.  We order the lots of beef and pork belly.  We cooked our seafood at the end, which were scallops and garlic shrimp.  Also, ordered miso ramen and it was pretty good.  My favorite was the sukiyaki bibimbap in a hot stone bowl.  That was super yummy.  It ended up costing us about $30 a person with all the food we ordered.  The only thing that I was suprised with is that they did an automatic 18% gratuity on our bill and also taxed the gratuity.  I just thought it was odd.

Came here with my parents to enjoy a Christmas Eve dinner. Upon walking in, I first took note of the beautiful exterior. Walking in, the same enjoyable look followed inside. There were partitions between areas of the room and tables, making each party's experience more private.

Between us three, we picked the Meat Lover's combo that is meant for two people and a few side dishes of vegetables. It was totally enough for all of us, so I'd suggest doing something like this unless you're super hungry. It comes with miso soup, salad, an fried bread/cheese appetizer, fried chicken, and a handful of meats to cook on the grill. I didn't really care for the fried chicken or fried bread, but otherwise the grilled meats were all solid. My parents also both got beers because there was a deal where each beer (Sapporo) was $1.50. We were stunned!! Such a great price.

Service was just wonderful. Steven was an awesome server and exactly how I wish all my servers would be like. He was friendly and approachable, without ever seeming fake. He was always attentive, but didn't ever checking in too often which can also be annoying. Refilled our drinks without us ever having to ask. I've been a server in the past, so I guess I expect a lot, but Steven was just a natural. Seriously made our experience all the better. If you read this, thanks Steven!!! We're definitely going to ask for you next time we come.

All in all, Gyu-Kaku was rad. I think the pre-decided combinations are the most worth it, but a la carte is just as good too if you're picky and know exactly what you want.

They have a huge variety of marinated meats and each one taste amazing.  The flavors are strong but surprisingly not too salty.  We got one of the combos for two people and liked everything except the chicken.  We also upgraded to the hot stone bowl beef rice instead of white rice and it was amazing and perfect for my toddler.  It also included ingredients for you to toast your own s'mores for dessert.

The appetizers were just okay, not good or bad. We would probably just order the meats separately without the appetizers. The dessert s'mores were pretty good.

I have felt a bit rushed at times even though the restaurant was almost empty.  I'll put up with average service for $4 drinks.  

They have good lunch specials too.",XXKjsdglgwSs9kWtK6ZWUQ,6,3,4,5s9YogaFbla0Rg4JGO9oog
2641280,2015-01-10,5,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"Not the best tabletop grilling style Japanese BBQ I've ever tried, (especially if you have ever had the luxury to try Anjin in Costa Mesa, CA) but there were some redeeming dishes of the evening. They also offer some decent deals during happy hour; plus they have pre fixe dinner combos that seem like they would be a good option for some: ranging from $55, $66, $77.77 and in addition to 20% off those set prices during happy hour. Happy hour is daily 5-6:30pm & 9-close.

We prefer selecting our few favorites from the menu so we went the a la carte route. Here's our favorites of the evening:

Garlic herb Filet mignon $7.95 - it was tender and grilled nicely on the tabletop grill.

Bacon asparagus $4.95 - bacon makes everything better.

Spicy pork $3.95 - classic Korean style spicy pork - mild, but cooked well on the grill and a great cheap meat dish to get your fill.

Angus ribs $4.95 - tender, juicy and seasoned well.

Miso $1.95 - traditional style, comforting, came out piping hot, and a plus it's not watered down!

Spicy tuna volcano $5.95 - it's packed up with a load of crispy fried rice, but if you eat it carefully, you can reserve some of that extra crispy rice and enjoy it with your grilled meats. I highly recommend that!

Beef tongue $7.95 - very tender and you can't go wrong! I love it.

Scallion sauce $1 - order this sauce. Order lots of it!!! The beef tongue and the rest of the grilled meats paired perfectly with this sauce.

Crunchy garlic sauce $1 - an oily bomb, but don't fret, the crispy charred garlic and spice bits are actually really tasty with the grilled meats- so scoop away!

Rice $1.95 - we really didn't need to order the rice, but one order was more than enough to share between 2 adults (just make sure you took my tip about the spicy tuna volcano's crispy rice above and you'd be set for success!) 

Pass on these:
Toro beef $3.95 - dried out, chewy 
Yakishabu $3.95 - dried out, very chewy
Corn butter $2.95 - skip! Canned corn and not special in any way
Garlic mushroom $2.95 - it was also very basic, so it's worth passing on, but if you're a mushroom lover like us, it may be worth a try 

What made this place just OK to me, was their sauces. The sauce makes or breaks Japanese BBQ and theirs were lacking authenticity. They offer 3 tabletop sauces: ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy, which are are mediocre and could use some extra love. They each tasted basic as if they were purchased bottled from the asian section at the grocery store. Leaves a lot to be desired, you feel me? Well, if I had to choose a favorite it would definitely be the spicy one. Had a nice tang and slight sweetness to it; not spicy in the slightest.

2646892,2015-02-02,1,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"This was my first time at a Japanese BBQ, so I have no prior experiences to base this off of.

Basically, you order your foods, then cook them on the grill built into the table. This is similar to the Korean BBQ places near it, and in that sense, the meat was so much better quality here. Every cut of beef, the duck breast, even the shrimp was delicious. The bibimbap was tasty, as were the rest of our food.

We opted to get the $77 course menu for two, but split it 3 ways and ordered a little extra, since their happy hour is before 6:30 or after 9:00.

The restaurant itself was nice, clean, attractive, and the noise level was great. Our waitress was very attentive, always checking on how our cooking was going or if any of us needed refills.

The prices during reverse happy hour are a steal to me. I got cabbage kimchi and hanger beef with a drink for only $9. The kimchi was amazing and so was the meat!

I changed the number of people so many times throughout the day and they still accommodated to it. Big plus. 

I am a HUGE meat eater. I love eating beef so this place was totally made for me. Everything we have ever ordered was all delicious. My boyfriend and I always order from their 2 for whatever meals. It is a ton of food. It's more than enough for two. It comes with an array of different appetizers and marinated meats. AND with s'mores to end the meal. Recently they started serving macaron ice cream sandwiches. Uh hello yes please! 

The only con about this place would probably be slow service sometimes. It's like why is it taking so long for raw meat to get to our table. Are they slaughtering the cow fresh to order or what?

We came here for their Monday all day happy hour. One of the best happy hours all around in my opinion. Not just for alcohol, but the few dollars that you save on plates adds up in the end if you have an appetite like me.

They have 30 ounce Sapporo and Asahi drafts. Literally the mugs are as big as my head. Also other favorites like a lychee martini. This really isn't a place you come to drink like one of the local bars but the mixed drinks always hit the spot.

We started off with the cheese wontons. Always a good choice but remember to eat them fast. You don't want them sitting around too long for the cheese inside goes from gooey goodness to cardboard. 5/5

We also went with the fillet. You save about two dollars during happy hour. And the New York steak. Both extremely good quality. 5/5

We also had the sukiyaki bimbimbap (I think that's how you spell it. Comes in a large cattle looking bowl. Extremely hot so be careful. For a crispier rice, let it sit in the bowl for a while before you stir and serve. Also a 5/5.

My favorite items on their menu are the duck breast and Japanese pork sausages. I'm not a huge fan of their beef items because they put some sort of sauce on them. I prefer the beef plain for grilling. I would suggest skipping the course menus and just getting exactly what you want a-la-carte. The course meals, for me, had too many items I wouldn't normally order. There's plenty of seating and the space reminds me of a mainstream yakiniku(grilled meat) restaurant in Tokyo.

We ordered a bunch of the ""hot apps"" - honestly, was not that impressed with this part of the menu. Calamari was kind of blah, the salad was nothing impressive. We had high hopes for the fried bacon chips. And they were fine, not amazing. 

Do not be discouraged- This was a small speed bump in an over-all great night.
The fun really began when we started getting the food that we cook at the small gas grill in the middle of the table! The marinades are awesome, the process is perfect for interactions, conversation, and nibbling! LOVED the Pork Belly and short ribs! The Garlic shrimp was great too- Order a couple, there are only 4.

I always go to Magal, it's my usual spot but today I figured hey why not try something new? Gyu has a great rep in the Los Angeles area so I figured this would be great too. BOY WAS I WRONG.

First off, it was completely empty. Nobody in the dinning area not even a busy night. Took atleast 20 mins to even get a hostess to come greet us. That's a no for me. 

Secondly, the server was trash. By trash I mean, a trash can could probably serve me better! Takes our order but isn't even welcoming? Stared at me as I asked for one of the combos and wasn't really personable. Also, he never even came by to check on my table. The only times I saw him was when he brought out the meats and vegetables and that was it. I saw him SO LITTLE I couldn't even point him out in a lineup if I had to. That's a HUGE NO. And lost all my points of ever coming back here.

Thirdly, it took almost 45 mins to even receive the fucking check! My mom was dying of thirst as her cup of tea always empty the entire meal. Unacceptable.
 
I will NOT be coming here again. I'd rather eat elsewhere where my service and hospitality is valued and not neglected just because it's DIY Korean BBQ. Smfh. I am absolutely disgusted lol.

Japanese style BBQ cook your own food makes for great dining experience. 

We ordered the ""jackpot surf and turf"" course meal. $77.77 altogether for 2 people,  exclusive to Las Vegas. 3 course meal included starters such as a spicy tuna salad, fried calamari, miso and much more.. 
Main entree included 3-4 styles of steaks: wagyu, skirt steak, and a few more I forgot? Salmon, garlic shrimp. 
And dessert we had s'mores. 

I wouldn't order the 3 course meal again just because I felt it was a bit over priced. You can definitely order ala carte which is better.

The service was good at first but through the middle to end waitress was hard to track down and this young man by the name of Andrew? catered to us and he wasn't even our server.

We were informed that Monday's were happy hour and we each got delicious drinks. We ordered some appetizers. Although we didn't need to. Our meal for 2 fed all three of us easily. I ordered the cabbage salad. It was light and delicious. I liked the sauce they used. We also ordered some calamari. It was ok. I didn't care for the breading or the sauce that came with it.

We ordered the ""meats"" dinner for 2 I believe. It came with Miso soup, a salad, a ton of meat, and dessert. We ordered extra sides of spinach, broccoli, and shrimp. Our server was very sweet. With each dish he brought out, he told us how to cook it and for how long. The cool thing is you can vary your cook time depending on your taste. I like my red meat a little more rare so I cooked it for less time. 

The only meat I didn't care for, was the pesto chicken. The garlic shrimp was particularly good. Overall, the experience was great. The smores at the end were a nice touch. I would like to go back the next time I'm in town.",Meial_i9QO7SFK_d05u2SA,0,0,4,7jZrXrjxEYdn2OhTRKAQtw

3236189,2016-12-17,0,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"Two of my coworkers were celebrating their birthdays and decided to choose this place.

Growing up in Hawaii where we have many yakiniku places, I've yet to have tried one here in Las Vegas.

I gave this place a 3 star review - I normally don't give such low scores but this restaurant really needs to fine tune their customer service and wait staff skills.

The beginning of our evening was a rough start, but Lily and Anthony did their best to make sure we left with smiles on our faces.

When we entered in the place there was no one to greet us at the host station, so we waited...

I wandered around and it seemed there were only two or three people actually working. This was at 6pm, usual time for dinner, I reached out to one of the employees and we were seated immediately.

We sat and perused the menu and had random conversation, during which time we noticed another table was being seated.

While we waited for our server we noticed the new table that was seated was having their drinks delivered to their table yet no one has even bothered to come to our table to get our drink order...and we're a pretty thirsty bunch!

Irritated, one of my coworkers ask a worker to please take our drink order pointing out another table was seated way after we had already been sat.

Again, not a good start. We ordered everything, drinks and food. [Thank you Anthony who let us know he wasn't a server but took our order anyways.]

Our waitress Lily, as pleasant as she was, started delivering food and some of our drinks. It should've been drinks first and not random food dish items at the same time. What happens there is, my coworkers received their starter dish and no drinks while I received my drinks and no starters. This causes a very awkward and unpleasant experience.

Overall, the food was good. Nothing spectacular, the gyoza is of the pre-made family - I hate that in any Asian restaurant I go to, and I can tell frozen from a fresh handmade dumpling.

The meats were delicious, the poké was good that we order two dishes of it. 

This place may have a good chance if they tidied up the experience and fine tuned their waitstaff' customer service. The one thing I did like was it seems the employees were happy to work there and that stands for something!

First thing I noticed right when I walked in was that they have a full bar here. From what I remember, the Gyus I've been to in LA served just beer and sake. This would be a great place to come and watch a game while sippin on an Old Fashioned or havin a couple beers and some finger food. 

Menu hasn't changed much. They still have happy hour all day except from 6PM-8PM. Their lunch sets are great. Rice, salad, miso soup, and two types of selected meats for just $10 is a great deal, and the lunch sets are available from 12PM-4PM. They still have the big sets if you wanna bring a large group and get down and rowdy. I feel like they go overboard with the marinade sometimes, but I'll just ask for the meats plain next time. The sukiyaki bibimbap is as good as I remember it to be.

Vegas has definitely upped its BBQ game, bringing in Gyu-kaku and an abundance of other Korean bbq spots. I've been to Gyu-kaku so many times in SoCal that I feel like I've been Gyu-Kaku'd out.

I always get a variety of meats one of which is the Toro beef. That specific meat cooks from 45 seconds a side. Well guess what, all the meat were taking more than 3 minutes to brown. Everything we had on the table cooked for such a long time. I was so mad, to top it off the garlic noodle served on that day was bland. 

After the meal I asked a different server if our grill was faulty (usually they change the burnt grills at least two times whenever we dine here).  We finished and the grill top wasn't even burnt. He said,  yeah this booth specifically had trouble heating. 

The fact that we could've relocated to a different table when you knew that the one we were sitting at was faulty. I would normally give a 5 Star rating.

This isn't an AYCE, but during happy hour the food more than justifies the price. They have pre-set dining options or you can go ahead and pick out different meats as you go with your meal. 

One of the things I hate about doing yakaniku is how long the smell lingers on your clothes afterwards. Here it isn't an issue. Right above the flames/grill is a circle of vents that vacuum out any smoke meeting you enjoy your meal without smelling like cooked meats. 

In all I will most definatly be coming back. The prices on meats and drinks are too good to pass up",Z3WjgplGGKoWfA8aTbYqYg,0,0,5,7qDryGcKQ6SF6413CrrGmQ

My friend spilled his miso soup and they quickly cleaned it up and gave him another one, no charge. It was great and everything. The only thing I can complain about is the fact that they don't specifically let you know what is SUPER HAPPY HOUR and what is REGULAR HAPPY HOUR. 
My friends and I went in specifically for the miso soup during happy hour, because I saw it was going to be 99 cents. What I didn't understand was that I guess it was for SUPER HAPPY HOUR which is all day monday and wednesday but tuesday its after 11 - last call. I just wish they were more specific about that. Other than that tho the deals are a steal, especially the 3 dollar BOGO shot of vodka. That shot is like 2 shots worth ALONE.

But I was disappointed this Gyukaku.
We ordered beef tongue.Normally the rule in Japan when someone order beef tongue, We eat first before another meat.while the pan is still clean.so,we can enjoy them with juice of lemon.
We went to there twice. 
Both time, they brought another meats before the beef tongue. Even last time who served us was Japanese server.
He didn't bring tongue first.That Japanese server was always talking with another customer who looks his friend and busy talking and we couldn't be served when we needed to ask something .
The rice was sooooooo hard.I usually want to enjoy the bbq with rice.So we don't need to order a lots of meat and we can stay healthy.
But with that hard rice we had hard time.
I Also have 1 year baby she can't eat super hard rice. 
So I asked if i can change to the another  rice but he told me he can't. But he told me he can put the microwave again.
I didn't know that first rice was microwaved.I don't like microwaved rice. 
Also he microwaved till hard rice.It makes rice more dry.
I finally asked hot water to put on the rice to make soft.
That was not totally my way to eat bbq.I couldn't enjoy this Yakiniku at all.
Finally he didn't charge the rice when I explain that I couldn't enjoy without rice. And I said it wasn't his fault. That is the owner's fault who doesn't know what is the rule for yakiniku(bbq).They just want to make money with pricy price.I feel this owner is not honest.
I will not come back there until owner change completely his or her mind.I want to tell you Gyukaku in Japan is totally different so please go to Gyukaku in Japan or another franchise Gyukaku.I don't recommend this Gyukaku.Thank you!!!!",ZxUudy2Vn4hfw5YNxRLO7w,0,0,1,D4pFiUl1zw6imr5-P12Q2g

The Vegas location is fairly large with plenty of tables and a long bar area, good for date nights or gatherings with friends and family. It's better to order a la carte instead of going with the meal deals, in my opinion, and skip stuff you may not really want like salad, soup and edamame. Proteins like the harm miso skirt steak and kale short rib don't take long to cook but can benefit from leaving them on the grill to get a little crispy around the edges. Other items we tried were seasoned well like the garlic shrimp and vegetables. The garlic rice, arriving in a stone pot, will get crispy when left in there.

Brought my mom in for the experience but the grill ended up being messed up and only half of it was hot to cook anything. It took forever for our meats to not even cook evenly. Waitress was well aware that that our stove wasn't working, was nice enough to offer to switch us tables until she found a solution of taking the inside piece of the grill off so that it was just the bare flame. Again, it worked for a bit but it was only a small flame on one side of the grill. There was no point to move tables at that point since we've already eaten most of our meats. For the price that you pay for the meats here, you should be able to enjoy every piece, unlike AYCE kbbq where you just force eat every meat in sight. Imagine eating a soggy piece of beef with no char at all or even having a meat take 5 minutes to even get to medium rare when it's supposed to take 2 minutes or less. The flame was so low that it took the whole visit for our broccoli to cook and by that time our cheese fondue had evaporated. Annoyed at the experience and will not be coming back again.

Pretty much tried all the meats w/ the exception of the ones w/ any sweet sauces. Favorite cut? Bistro Hanger Steak Miso (21-Day aged angus beef). During this experience, I learned that I don't particularly care for super thinly sliced meat.

I definitely got the Japanese vibe on my first time visiting.  They have cool samurai decorations and art.  The tables also look like ones in Japan minus the sitting on the floor part.

Both times I came here I went during their Happy Hour later in the evening.  They have a great variety of meats in small portions so it's best to order a few because one order will not fill you up.  

All the different meats were really good.  I tried to Kalbi,  New York Steak, and the filet mignon.  All cooked perfectly (because I grilled it duh)

The sides were kind of A mixed between American and Korean dishes.  I ordered the corn and both times they were kinda burned with the directions they gave me.  Also ordered the broccoli and velveta cheese(fondue style) which was great.  

The complaints I have about this was the service.  They only had 1 server working for 7-8 tables.  The music was really loud which I usually like loud but not when I'm out having dinner trying to have a conversation with.

Overall it's a cool concept with cooking your own food and the staff giving you directions.  I'd like to recommend making having a timer at the table for customers.

3776258,2015-03-05,4,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"Sigh... another place that seems like a tourist trap that lures people in with a snazzy outside and atmosphere. Its japanese barbecue I can tell you that, but it aint that good. Place is dirty too. Its unnoticeable, but its there. The food there is expensive and extremely unsatisfying. Service isnt good either.

Ill start off what matters to me: food because we all love it. The meat is barely okay and priced at a plate of 6 pieces of tuna sashimi from Las Vegas. Its just not good. I got a decent variety of things there that I cant remember the names of and all I know it wasnt good.

The service seemed like a joke. I waved a dozen times and even spoke up to the waiters with common phrases like ""excuse me"" which escalated to ""hey, man cmon"", but nothing came up after 10 minutes. After 10 minutes of stuggling to get attention from a waiter thats walking up in down with nothing in his hand everytime, he made eye contact with me as I raised my tired hand like an attaenna reaching for the heavens. EYE CONTACT WITH ME WAVING AT HIM. Even then I got no service. 5 minutes later I got their attention after leaning out of my booth raising my hand.

The environment is dim, so thats nice and relaxing, but looks can be deceiving. I was just sitting there forcing myself into thinking the expensive meat I had ordered was good and I noticed someone cleaning a table. Nothing to look at really, but as I eat my bbq I catch something in my peripheral vision. The person cleans the bottom the table first and uses the same rag, without any rinsing, to clean the top. The place has tabletop grills, so the bottom is naturally going to be dirtier than the top. Then I drop a peice of over priced meat on the table and was forced into throwing it away after seeing such a thing. Finally, they had music playing. Not any other music, but music youd hear from the first two DDRS. I think I even heard Butterfly play. Its humorous for a place that tries to be elegant with dim lighting and a lot of partitions.

As I sip my cup of refreshing water, I gazed upon something I wish I hadnt noticed. There was dirt floating to the top of my water. ""Oh. Just don't get water here then"" is what I thought, but then I looked more closely into the cup. What i thought made my drink filthy was the ice. I almost puked thinking of the idea of literally everyone in the place with ice in their drinks having a chance of getting ill from a restaurants carelessness. So I decided to get a drink without ice, but woah... dirt was still there. So it mustve been the dishes being carelessly cleaned. I genuinely wonder how clean the back of the house is now.

Pros: they sure know how to hide dirt with dim lighting, and a neat enterance.

Cons: dirty place, bad service, and mediocre food.

Advice: bring your dance pants to get jiggy with the music, reach out of your booth to get someones attention, and try to inspect your cup or plates for any filth.

Im not much of a complainer at all, but I feel like Ashton Kutcher was waiting for me to leave so he can pop out telling me I got Punkd as he points to various plants claiming there was a camera in it.

We were quite please with the quality of the meats and the different sauces which created a different palate of flavor combination with all the different meats we ordered. Some of the items that were stellar for us was the Beef Tongue and Beef Angus Rib Eye. Some of the side dishes that caught our attention was garlic flavor mushrooms, seaweed salad & garlic rice was flavorful and consistent. The miso soup was a bit on the salty side. Overall we enjoyed our meal especially the Macaroon Ice Cream and S'mores. 

The only downside was our server was a bit slow and rarely check on us if we wanted anything else especially for something like making sure if wanted more water. However it's rare that service is not at par because most times I've been here in the past, Service was great. Will be back when I or we have a craving for Japanese BBQ.",6pzA8EDhHgW3A5-rBObhBA,1,1,4,Cwwh8lo8xmI05QR_F0u5Vg

The prices ended up being pretty comparable. Roughly $30-$40pp spent. Favorite items were the Kobe steak, and beef tongue. Garlic rice was good, but would prefer white rice since the meat items you're eating it with is already salty. The garlic rice was too much flavor to eat with seasoned meat. They also sell Lady M green tea cake here shipped from NYC. The fresh NYC version is better, but this is not bad.

The garlic fried chicken comes with this spicy sauce that honestly should just be put on everything.

I had Kalbi like in the Korean joints, but I also had butterfish and duck as well.  They had this Spicy Tuna Volcano, which is basically spicy tuna on top of a cooked rice ball.  Needless to say, but this place brought my appetite back (stomach virus killed my appetite...).  

Their size of their traditional grills was smaller than I would've liked, but it got the job done.  My party was small, so it didn't really make a difference.  I was just a little impatient because I wanted all that food inside me as soon as I saw it.  (Yes, my dream girl would say something similar to this).

I came here on a Monday night for their happy hour where selected meat/veggies are $1-2 cheaper than its original price. 

ATMOSPHERE
Very impressed with the atmosphere and interior. As opposed to the wooden benches/table and casual vibe of Gyu-Kaku in Japan, this place seemed more luxurious/fancy/modern. It made me wonder if Gyu-Kaku here incorporated Vegas's nightclub/flashy vibe to it. They have this cool lit entrance that makes you feel like you are walking on a red carpet for Grammy Awards. Interesting that they even have a bar..atmosphere here is way too cool for a BBQ restaurant. 

SERVICE
Service was excellent here. All the staffs here are energetic and attentive. Our server named Ryan was beyond fantastic. Since it was my first time at this location, he gave us suggestions, explained different sauces and the cooking time for specific meat. I was impressed with his enthusiasm and knowledge.

FOOD
Good quality meat but kinda pricey for such a small portion in my opinion. I guess it's more about the quality over quantity here because meat was actually really good. I believe I got a Toro Shabu  which was thinly sliced beef and horumon which was my first time trying. 3 sauces they had were ponzu, spicy and sweet soy (?), I personally enjoyed dipping in the ponzu. Ponzu was citrusy and very refreshing, complimented the meat well. 

CONCLUSION
Will be back again for their happy hours!

[Edited to add]
Second time around, completely ignored. Even though we had 3 servers walking by us/making eye contact, they acted as if we were not there. Finally after a good 10-20 mins, one of the servers came up to us only to tell us that kitchen is closed. First of all, why do you even have a poster around the entire restaurant which states happy hour is until 1AM. We were there around 12:30AM.. Yeah, if you guys didn't ignore us, maybe the kitchen wouldn't have been closed? Taking a star off. Extremely disappointed in you, Gyukaku.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,4,2,3,XnOXTTfZowsbuAzhTrc-cA

I don't mind because I think that I'm the best cook ever. Everything cooks in about 1.5 minutes per side.  I've tried all the red meats, the shrimp, the salmon, and even the chicken.  Take my advice and skip the chicken.  The rest is pretty good and my favorite is their hanger steak.  Each serving of their hanger steak is about 3 oz., it's a little thin, but marinated just right for my taste.  Price for dinner is comparable to the rest of the Asian BBQ places out here.  Happy Hour is a couple bucks off their dinner prices.  In my opinion, you get the most out of your money during lunch when the prices are almost half off.  9 oz. of meat for around $10??  Sold!!

This was not my first time here, but last weekend, I visited Gyu with 2 other of my friends to only find out that our favorite bbq spot has definitely gone downhill. We do not want to complain about our server, he was great-Dalvin. However, the food was not so good, the marinades were not evenly distributed, and the fried appetizers were just not cooked right- they were either too hard or cold. The experience was not so good as it used to be as soon as we walked in. We were seated by a female staff who did not greet us or smile at us. She just had a cold look, and when we were seated, our table was dirty. The booth had food debris all over, and tongs were dirty as well- make sure you check their tongs to see there are no food left on the inside of them- 2 out of 3 on our table were dirty. Their sauce pans did not seem too clean either. Later, our server was busy with another table, so we grabbed a person who seemed like a manager, who turns out to be the staff who seated us- her name was JJ, and shew as the manager on duty, she said. She had an attitude this whole time she was handling our need. We simply wanted to order couple more items, but she said that our server will be at the table soon, and that she is just a manager.

Does it really matter who takes the order? Specially, when you are a manager? I would understand if she was a hostess or something else that does not associate with menus, but isn't she the manager? We felt like she said something very irresponsible.  I wanted to complain about all these comments I am jotting down here right now, but my friends said that it is probably not even worth it to someone who definitely does not seem to care, so we did not. 

If the food was still the same and the environment, I would not mind coming back. However, so far, the experience was just so absurd, that I doubt if I would come back. There are so many new spots opening up for great barbeque at reasonable price, not to mention that they are gyu kaku copycats.

4107112,2015-11-14,4,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"Well, here comes an atypically fuzzy review from me...

I haven't tried Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ until now. It's available back in California and has been open here in Vegas for over a year now, but it never drew my attention until some friends agreed on it as a dinner destination.

We waited until 9:00pm for the start of happy hour (also available all day Mondays and Wednesdays and daily noon-6:30pm) to go. We had a reservation, although it didn't look very busy. The decor is welcoming and the place was very clean, perhaps owing somewhat to self-vacuuming grill helping to keep the restaurant and patrons' clothing free of residual meat smells. I have to confess that I was super tired during the meal in the ""I can't focus on more than one thing"" kinda way, but I really don't remember hearing any music whatsoever being played. Maybe it was soft and drowned out by conversation?

I deferred to someone else for the orders (a la carte of course), and I didn't get so much as a whiff at the receipt, so I won't be able to comment as much on specific dishes as I would like. Our approach ended up being like a ""tasting"" because we shared their portions with five instead of just two or three, so definitely don't be afraid to duplicate orders in larger groups.

Miso soup ($0.99 happy hour, $1.95 regular): it's a standard miso soup, but even in the small bowl, it's a relative bargain during happy hour. Get it if you don't flat out hate miso soup.

Gyu-Kaku Salad ($5.50 HH, $6.50 reg): I don't even wanna know what the half order looks like. Even considering our modest split, the portion seems small, and the dish isn't especially memorable even though it was good at the time. Skip this.

Fried Chicken Karaage ($3.95/$4.95): this is actually one of several dishes that are even more deeply discounted during ""Super Happy Hour"" after 11pm, but no way were we waiting that long. It was the best appetizer that I sampled tonight, and the rich creamy sauce is balanced out by a squeeze of lemon.

Fried Calamari ($4.95/$5.95): skip this. The squid was boring and slightly rubbery. There is absolutely nothing special about it. It's like a pricier, less impressive version of the karaage since it comes with the same sauce and lemon.

Pork Gyoza Dumplings ($3.50/$4.95): also a skip. It's good but unmemorable to a similar extent as the salad.

Corn w/ cheese ($3.95): pretty good, maybe not worth the price. I love corn, but you start to question your sanity with these prices for veggies. That's part of the appeal of AYCE joints, which this is not an example of - you feel like you can still get your veggies while maintaining value. But on that note, I would get the zucchini ($2.95) again, and if I go for Super Happy Hour, I'll most likely get the normal corn at $1.99.

I won't pretend to know all of the meats that I had, especially considering that my friend ended up cooking and distributing everything (on that note, not posting any grill meats photos), but I'm absolutely certain that the Toro Beef (""beef bacon"" for $3.95/$4.95) was a rockstar dish, and I'm sure the Yaki-Shabu (beef chuck roll, same price as the previous item) and Angus Beef Ribs (ditto on price) were also delicious. Although ponzu and spicy sauce (separately or in combination) will probably be your mainstays, I believe the beef ribs were the one that somehow worked especially well with the sweet soy sauce. Just be sure to rely on the sauces to fill out the flavor because this ain't no Korean BBQ joint.

It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows though. Duck breast ($6.95/$7.95) and beef tongue w/ scallion sauce ($8.95) were both notably underwhelming. Actually, I don't even remember amidst the confusion which piece was the duck breast. As for the beef tongue, the meat itself was fine, but the scallion sauce didn't do much for me. Maybe I expected it to be a little more cooked and buttery, but it just seemed raw (but how do you cook it on a wire mesh?) and therefore out of place.

Lastly, dessert was a bit of a downer. The macaron ice creams were decent but not worth the $5. I liked the green tea ice cream inside a strawberry shell, and also the mango. I didn't enjoy the taro shell w/ vanilla as much.

All in all, I enjoyed most of the meats, and happy hour pricing was pretty nice, so I would consider trying Gyu-Kaku again. It's a change of carnivorous pace from the KBBQ places.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,4,4,kmKYKVeD1dhG67irPq66eA

You end up wondering just how good the next course will be. Photos are attached, but tbh, I was too excited to eat that I did not take as many as I had wanted to in the beginning.

As for service, I believe I counted around 5 that came to us, asking if we needed anything in the most polite manner. 

The interior was beautiful, extracting older Japanese themes with a modern touch. My experience here seems very worthy of the 5 star rating I've given.

Having been to multiple Gyu-Kakus before this, I had high expectations of this restaurant. The staff and restaurant itself were great, however the food didn't live up to the hype. 

Both Bibimbap bowls: I think it would be more appropriate to call them stone cooked fried rice bowls, rather than bibimbap. There were no vegetables, gochujang or egg in the bowl. It was just rice and some meat! 

Kimchi: Disappointing :(

Meat: Ordered the skirt steak and kalbi short rib. Good, but not special enough for me to go back to Gyu-Kaku for.

4315034,2016-09-02,1,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"On my usual rounds of scrolling through facebook, I saw that my friend was at his favorite place in Vegas to eat (gyukaku) and immediately wondered why I haven't been back in a year. I realized why which i'll get to later in the review.

Setting: In a fairly large and quiet plaza by the vietnamese market and near the smokin crawfish restaurant. When you see this place you almost get the feeling why something that looks so nice be located here? Bright white lights and modern decor make it out to be a high class establishment so taking a date here would definitely give the impression of quality. 

Choosing your food: You can go a la carte or choose the set meals they offer. Personally I think choosing the set is your best bet for the first time and choosing a la carte the second visit when you know which meats are right for you. 

Meats: They offer several cuts of meat and prepared with different types of marinades which is a big problem for me. All of the meat is in some type of sauce and seasoning which overburdens the meat and ruins its true flavors. Yeah I know some meats are suppose to be marinated (kalbi, bulgogi, etc) but all of their meats seem to be soaking in sauce. I think we can all agree that marbled meat is the best meat. The beef items that we got on the meat lovers seemed pretty tough and chewy which is a big disappointment. 

Happy Hour: All day monday and wednesday is pretty sweet! A good amount of the items on the menu are about $1 some $2 off. A mug of sapporo during the summer happy hour was only $1.50. 

Overall: I think it's a cool place to go for a nice evening of drinking, grilling, and chatting with a group of people, but all the meat being marinated and pretty tough fails to want me to come again for food.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,4,2,3,98SSSEYoEbH1c172to-26w

Recently though, came to have dinner with my mom on 5/3/15, and was seated at a table with an obnoxious party next to us separated by one of their dividers.

Gyu-Kaku welcomes you with a grand entry way lit with lights, it definitely doesn't feel like I'm still in Vegas while walking in.  We were seated right away and our server explained the menu to us and suggested ordering off their course menus ($55-$77).  We opted for a la carte because we thought we'd save more money and be able to eat what we wanted, but our bill came out to $60 anyway.  

We started off with the Asian Sangria in Apple.  It's made with Hana Sake, fruits, mandarin, orange, mint and sprite.  The sangria was fruity, refreshing, and delicious!  If you're looking for something to sip on that doesn't burn your throat, this is the winner! 

Spicy Tuna Volcano: a block of rice that's fried with spicy tuna on top.  Although it's a best seller, I wouldn't order it again.  The rice was too fried and hard to chew. I've seen it executed better at ayce sushi.

Our server recommended 2 plates of meat and 2 plates of vegetables per person and an appetizer to be full.  I initially thought it was a lot of food, but I didn't realize how small the portions would be.  

We ordered the Bistro Hanger Steak, Duck, and Angus Beef Ribs with the sauces that were recommended for each on the menu.  When we got our meats, I couldn't believe how fresh they looked, each plate came with 5-6 pieces of meat, so don't expect to get ayce full. It's more about the quality than quantity here.  I also enjoyed the 3 different sauces on the table that you could dip your meats in!  They also have additional sauces you can pay for to enhance the flavor of the meats, we decided to go with the Crunchy Garlic Sauce.  It's crunchy garlic in red chili oil, but with all the sauces at the table, I didn't find it necessary.  Everything had so much flavor already so no need to pay extra.  

For vegetables, we got the Mushroom Medley, which came with Enoki, King Oyster, and Garlic Mushroom and Spinach Garlic.  Both were good additions to the meat.  They come in foil and you steam it on your grill alongside with the meat.  
 
Rice isn't included in a la carte, so we ordered 2 bowls at $1.95 each.  

I love how you don't smell like bbq afterwards and the service is beyond amazing!  I'll definitely be back to try their course menu and their HH menu which is from 5-6 pm and 10 pm-12 am.

First time on my birthday 11/19: got the premium HH $55 Special which came with harami skirt, filet mignon, shrimp, pork belly, short rib and chicken. Of course it came with the app of soup, salad, edamame, and a few others as well like tofu nugget, gyoza, and an unknown lol. Top favorite were the skirt, filet and chicken. Service was good, the server at the time was starting his first day but did very well. 

Second time was Friday night 1/22: came in with mom, this time got the same special, adding in beef tacos, cheese wonton, sweet potato fries. Before we could taste any of it my mom felt ill and wanted to go home, so I asked for my check and paid the bill and unfortunately had to cancel the meal. Tim the manager immediately responded with helping me out the next time we come in which lead to tonight. 

Monday 1/25: Pretty busy for a Monday night, had to get a reservation first, spoke to Tim the manager and immediately helped us right away and got to continue with our last server, which was Steven, super cool dude! We ordered everything from last time that we didn't get to enjoy and got to taste everything and it was great! Service was excellent and frequent, food was cooked to right temperatures (appetizers). Total check was $88.00 with the extra filet mignon I ordered with drinks and tipped $25.00. Couldn't help but was impressed with the hospitality from this joint, thank you Tim and Steven for making a great experience!

Managers (at the time dined in) were very genuine about customer satisfaction, and you could clearly see they cared about this establishment. They talked to each table and spent time to actually have a conversation weather that be in relation to the restaurant or of just random topics, they made everyone laugh and assured no one left disappointed- Even the staff seemed to be happy with Managers who were(at the time): Karsten, and Shayna-Marie. Servers were quick with refills, knowledgable with menu, and did not wait long to have our food out and even explained proper cook times as well as sanitation advice. 

Great food should you choose the right marinade for your meat, along with the right choice of appetizers/sides ect. togo with it. 

Try getting a few Sake Bombs with you and your date/or group of friends when Bella is tending the Bar- She'll make it one to remember !!!!!

All though this is a good review, don't think I will be returning based off of a few things I have seen and heard of about this place. I mean, looks can be appealing to the naked eye, but what goes on behind those curtains/doors(at any establishment) we will never know...unless we have be an employee there...

For starters I ordered the fried bacon chips, good but a bit salty. I also ordered garlic bimbimbap to share. It was so delicious that we had to order another one. For the side veggies, broccoli and mushroom medley which are served with butter wrapped in tin foil to grill. The kimchee was pretty standard. 

For the meat selections, I ordered the Japanese sausages served with whole grain mustard for dipping which were pretty good. Also Kalbi short ribs, filet mignon, yaki-shabu and the spicy pork were delicious. The garlic shrimp was way too salty, too much garlic salt! There are also 3 different dipping sauces for your meat to choose from - sweet soy, ponzu and spicy.

We tried the filet mignon and yaki shabu. Both had tremendous flavors that we liked! For dessert, we had s'mores.

The set up, decorations and style was really eye catching as well. The entrance is lit up by rows of lights and the inside reflects how restaurants in Japan are set up like. This definitely is a great place to socialize, cook and eat at the same time. 

It did take a little long for someone to come start serving us but it could have been due to how busy they were that night. The servers were friendly and educated us about each meat and entree, they were also very polite. 

We ordered 2 courses, since we had a party for 4. One being the Surf Turf Jackpot Course and the Meat Lover's Course. There is a variety of meat that is included. (Filet mignon, Kobe style flat iron steak) and seafood as well (shrimp, salmon). We were able to cook these the way we like it! 

The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star is because (1) it did take us awhile to get served and there was no inform of sympathy. (2) it was my brother and I birthday, and we were given one birthday hat but no singing ceremony like the others and (3) our check $50 extra due to charging of every single appetizer item when it was suppose to be included in the courses.

We walk in....pretty setting. Totally wanted to eat on the floor tables. 

We get a booth and we were game. I was looking forward to coming here, but after I tried getting a few people's attention and them just looking away acting like I don't exist, i got a bit annoyed. I get it, our table isn't there's, but when my hands in your face and I say excuse me, at least acknowledge it. It took a good 15-20 mins for someone to ask if we've been helped. It just sucks it took someone to wail there hands around like those blow up guys in front of car dealerships to get their attention.

We got Andrew, and he was phenomenal. Great customer service. He told us what the menus about, but since we waited so long, we already knew what we wanted. Get a la carte! No point on getting the combo. Too expensive, and you might not get everything you may want to try. 

The meat was OK, but not to die for. Small portion for each meat you order. They range from $5-$8. Not unless you get the Kobe, then that's about $20. We also got a couple appetizers. The garlic chicken and the calamari. Again, not to die for. Also, those were the worlds smallest fried calamari I've ever had from any restaurants I've ever been in. 

Crunchy garlic sauce ppl were raging about...ehh. 

The real reason I gave this 3 stars, which I think I'm being generous, is because from the corner of my eye I saw one of the ladies cleaning the table top with a dirty rag. I saw her wipe the grill from underneath and saw just dust and black muck on the rag. She then folds the rag, which is thin, and wipes the tables down with it. Then the booth and chairs. Soooo, ew. At least wipe the table top first, yanno? 

Oh! And that playlist they played, I swear all the songs were from the 90's. They got that DDR music playing and made me wanna play it. Hah!

Happy hours - All Day on Mondays and Wednesdays!  That alone makes this a great place to visit! They also have early happy hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays through Sundays from 12 pm to 6:30 pm and late happy hour (reverse happy hour) on Tuesdays and Thursdays through Sundays from 9 pm to 12:30 am.  Even with happy hour, you can still drop a pretty penny because there's a lot to order.  I love their cocktails and the beer is a great price too!

My go to items are (give or take): Edamame (free with FB like), Fried Calamari, Kim-Chee Tofu, Spicy Tuna Volcano, Steamed Chili Dumplings, Fried Bacon Bits, Fried Japanese Tofu, Pork Gyoza Dumplings, Toro Beef, Horumon Intestine, Beef Tongue, Pork Belly, Pork Toro, Shrimp Garlic, and Mushroom Medley.

Their rewards program is pretty awesome!  If I'm not getting free food, I'm getting money off the bill. Who is going to complain about that?

They recently added an all-you-can-eat option: $15-$20/pp children (ages 6-12); $30-$40/pp adults and $20-$27 seniors (age 60 and up). 

This is a fun place for groups, although you can easily run out of space at your table.  I like that they make a big deal out of birthdays!  Love places that put that little effort in!  (Hence, that's why I'm going tonight!)

Service is pretty good for the most part.  You have energetic individuals coming around to get your orders in and food out.  It's a bit frustrating to have reservations every time I go, but still have to wait an additional 10-15 minutes since the table is never ready.  (Not ideal when you have kids in tow.) Surprisingly, I didn't have to wait the last time but I have had to in the past.

4991127,2017-04-09,0,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"Gyu-Kaku is an classy Japanese BBQ restaurant with great service, a fantastic happy hour, and mid range prices.  For those of you who have not been to a Japanese BBQ, think of those AYCE Korean BBQ places, but with better cuts of meats that are individually laid out on a tray rather than plopped in a bowl.  

I arrived earlier than my group, so I sat at the bar for a beer.  The happy hour was $2.50 draft beers and I took full advantage of it!  Our group sat at a booth - they've designed the restaurant to maximize booth space, cause you know, no one likes to sit close to a stranger.  They also air vents built right into the grill, so all the smoke gets sucked out before it even floats upwards.  Now, while you won't go home reeking of smoke, you also won't get the delightful smells of BBQ here as well.  

We ordered two of their group sets, which I love.  It takes the work of picking the individual meats and sides out of my hands.  Food just magically appears!

Overall, I highly recommend Gyu-Kaku if you're looking for a nice place to have a BBQ dinner.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,1,2,5,cV9qGVYqOQ-op76T30m4jw

- Sunday: At the bar we were the only customers but the bartender was unfriendly and maybe even irritated that she had to serve us.  Once seated at our booth, taitress said it was her second day on the job and she was terrible.  I wasn't able to use my LivingSocial (all I had to do was order 2 more items to reach the $30 spending requirement) voucher but she kept ignoring our table (she would speed past us on her way to/from the kitchen).  I had to flag another waiter to get our water glasses refilled.
- Monday: Andrew was a great waiter.  Finally able to use the LivingSocial voucher and it was happy hour.
- I would only come back if: 1) it was happy hour and 2) I don't have that same first waitress.  
- For now the place gets 1-star as it is pricey bbq (even during happy hour) but will adjust my rating up if future visit(s) are on par with waiter Andrew's service.

It's so hard to NOT get good food in Chinatown. We go down there pretty often now because it really is some of the best food you're going to get in Vegas. 

We got the Gyu-Kaku Course. Good god, it's a lot of food and it's very reasonably priced for 2 people. 

The two best things we had: Kalbi Short Ribs & Filet

It comes with so many things, so prepare to be way too full. 

The only downside as to why I didn't give it 5 stars: we had horrible service. 
They put a guy that was very new on the group. And he was forgetting everything. Everyone kept having to ask him for a lot of the food and drinks over and over. 
He was still really nice--he just seemed super stressed out. Which I can imagine why. They shouldn't have had someone so new helping a large group of people with little to no help. So it took over 3 hours of dining. Which is to be expected with a large group. But fair warning--this may not be a good place to have a very large group for dining.

The food did take a little long to come out and we did have to remind our server. We ordered off the happy hour menu and we had ordered the shio ramen as well. 
The shio ramen was incredibly bland; I used to work in a ramen restaurant for two years and I have been to countless other restaurants that serve ramen but this ramen was by far the worse ramen I've ever had. Save your 7 dollars or so and get some more BBQ that's for sure...

The meat itself for the BBQ was quite delicious. Some pieces of the toro beef were incredibly dry and hard to chew. I'd say try the other meats they offer instead (I can't remember their names right now).

My friend and I had the s'mores for dessert and it was delicious and a great experience.

Our total bill came out to be around 70 dollars for dinner for two hungry girls. Neither one of us had drinks, but we did get ramen along with the BBQ.

Environment: The outside of the restaurant can be a little misleading in the sense that the area isn't that great and the building looks kind of small on the outside, however, upon entering it is totally different. The interior is clean and trendy, with a lot of walls breaking up the restaurant which is nice in the sense that it makes wherever you are seating feel a little more private without being cramped. They also do have seating on the lower level of the restaurant which is part of the reason that it looks so small from the outside. Additionally, the music they play is very trendy and current which I appreciated.

Food: First off, their happy hour is great. They have it every day at reasonable times and deals on basically everything from appetizers, to meat, and to the drinks. For drinks, they have various beers on draft, both Japanese and domestic, and their jumbo hot sake are great and HUGE. Food-wise I got a couple small appetizers, namely the spicy tuna volcano and the fried calamari. When ordering the meats, they usually come in small portions which allows you to try everything you want before you get full. A couple of my favorites were the miso steak, beef tongue, and bacon-wrapped scallops. Everything was very favorable. 

Service: Service was very good as well. Our server Haena was very nice and informative and was very good about checking up on us. She was consistently getting us refills on drinks, changing our grill for us, and letting us know about how much time each item we were grilling would take before it was ready to eat.

Spicy Tuna Volcano - Bomb.com
Fried Calamari - Decent
Miso Chili Wings - Pretty Good
Steamed Chili Dumplings - Basically gyoza with chili sauce and this crunchy but sticky garlic chili paste. Bomb

Vegetables:
Shishito Peppers - Can't go to a Japanese BBQ joint and not order shishito peppers...that's like declining chips & salsa at a mexican joint.
Asparagus - There's gotta be veggies somewhere..

BBQ Beef:
Filet Mignon - Cut was good, very juicy
New York Steak - One of the tables favorite choice
Bistro Hanger Steak - Not bad very simple
Angus Beef Ribs - It was cool
Harami Skirt Steak - One of the tables favorite choice
Kalbi Short Ribs - Pretty good

I'm glad I did.  
Inside is a new concept of modern architecture and old Japanese.
There's an art collection of authentic Shogun warriors.
The main entrance door is of real Japanese antique door.  Shogun costumes, etc.

The bar is shining with modern LED lights and a good collection of wines and spirits.
Bartender is super fun and friendly.  The SAKE Bomb is the highlight of the night!

Our server ""Yoshi"" is Uber friendly as well.  
Good recommendation of meat selection is really great.  I love the Harami skirt steak and the newly added Fried chicken wonton with Shiracha sauce. 
All the other meats are flavorful and tender.
Spicy tuna volcano is a big hit as well.

5517456,2016-02-07,0,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"We wanted to love it. We wanted to be excited. Perhaps, I wanted to love it and was overly excited to try somewhere new? Well, whichever it was...it was anticlimatic for me. My husband's review, ""it wasn't so bad"". They offered internal organs, of course he'll have such of an opinion. 

We came in on a Tuesday not too long after they opened. Immediately greeted...check. Seated...check. I was completely excited to look over their menu, especially since we happen to arrive during Happy Hour. For some reason I still can't figure out, their happy hour menu wasn't as impressive. I suppose it was because the food itself wasn't. 

ME: 
Fusion edamame (garlic seasoned edamame)
Spicy Tuna Volcano (crispy rice with spicy tuna on top)
Beef tacos (won ton wrapper fried into a taco shape with bulgogi squeezed in)
Miso Butterfish (butterfish in miso sauce with a pepper wrapped in foil to simply toss onto the grill)

HUSBAND:
Tako wasabi 
Liver (waiter said it was pork liver)
Beef Toro
Spicy Tuna Volcano
Miso Butterfish

US:
2 Kirin beer

There was nothing spicy or even tuna about this dish. The crispy rice seemed to have more.flavor than the spicy tuna. To jazz it up I made it rain with a bottle of some sauce they have on the table labeled as spicy. But that wasn't spicy at all. 

I do love they offer sweet potatoe FRIES. Having some kind of finger food for a 9months old to grasp and keep occupied is an immediate thumber-upper from me.

Miso Butterfish was alright. The sauce it steams in is very light in taste, which is a good thing for such a fish.  You get a small piece of fish, thankfully, it wasn't a small and thin piece.  Nothing spectacular. Since I do love eating fish, I still appreciated it. 

The beef tacos weren't anything spectacular either. Maybe if they slid in 2 more pcs I wouldve said they were deeelish! Just wasnt enough bite for me to thoroughly assess. A little expensive for what you get happy hour or not. Man, I'm starting to think I came in way too hungry. 

Can't review on the liver, I don't eat that stuff. Husband said twas alright. He did note that the Tako wasabi was his favorite and thought twas pretty good. So if you are into the raw stuff, that just may be your deal.

The beef Toro to me didn't look too fresh...freshly frozen...freshly defrosted frozen...freshly flashed frozen? Whichever...just didn't have that nice color to the meat the way I'm accustomed to seeing at Gangnam. It was marinated in something but upon eating it, I couldn't even taste it out. 

Prices were alright considering it was happy hour. I think I was overly excited in my head so perhaps I was expecting more. I would probably come again just to give it another shot. Maybe during a time when they didnt just open...maybe the food needed time to marinate longer? 

The best part about our meal was our 1.99 kirin beer, my fusion edamame (which was a small bowl for almost 4bucks), and my husband's Tako (small bowl.for almost 4 bucks). We spent 55 bucks, which I walked out wishing we had just went to an AYCE sushi for even less.

 I enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant, and it being well ventilated. There were a couple times our waiter lagged in service. We were nearly done eating by the time he brought our beer out. I suppose since this was noon on a weekday, we had nowhere to go...we didn't really care much. Sometimes just laying back and not having the urgency for anything is soothing to the nerves. Aside from that, overall, service was great and super friendly.

Again, I'd have to come back.. maybe less hungry too. Sometimes hunger can change your palate for sure. But for now, I don't feel like I'm missing out on life if I never did return.

The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the ""Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap"".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.

She then apologized and brought out the missing dishes. Asked for a refill for hot tea but had to wait at least 10 mins for a refill. Rice was under cook.

The side dishes are nice, but I recommend getting mostly meat if you want a fuller meal. Even with happy hour, these dishes are pretty small and they do add up. 

Our waiter wasn't that great, he put the stove up too high and didn't check up on us if we needed refills or wanted to order more. We had to wait for another waiter to come around.

5620590,2014-09-28,4,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"We had a fun and flavorful meal at the new Las Vegas location of Gyu-Kaku on Decatur and Spring Mountain last night.  Eight of us came for dinner and were seated quickly without needing a reservation.  The staff is very friendly here and our waitress explained the menu and all of the options available for our meal.  The Harami Skirt Steak is currently a promotional item at 50% off the regular price per order.  We shared several different items including the skirt steak special, Bistro Hanger Steak, Garlic Shrimp, Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus, Spinach Garlic, Shisito Peppers, Fried Bacon Chips, Edamame, and Shrimp Sukiyaki Bibimbap. There were two charcoal grills for our party, one for four people each, and the guys did the bbq'ing for the gals.  I really enjoyed the Harami Skirt Steak as it had a great miso flavor and no extra sauce was necessary for seasoning.  It was also my first time having bibimbap and I loved it. Those two dishes are ones that I'd definitely have again.
This is a great place to come with your friends so you can share lots of different menu items and socialize over some good food.  Gyu-Kaku also offers ""BBQ Courses,"" specials for two people that start at $55 and include many menu items from appetizers to entrees to dessert, a value over ordering a la carte; I think we may try that the next time around when we're hungrier.

5627098,2014-09-20,3,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"Just came back from the restaurant tonight.  feel like sharing my experience with people.  The environment was very good.  Its hard to see such scale of restaurant locally.  The server told me that this restaurant cost about 2 million.  Each stove cost about 10 grand.  The smoke was sucked under neath, so your cloth will not smell after the meal. The menu looks pleasant. beautiful pictures.  Service was good.  He changed my grill 4 times during the meal.  These are all the good parts.  Now here comes the food.  the appetizer we ordered was spicy tuna volcano.  of 1 to 5, I will give it a one.  tuna has no flavor, the deep fried rice ball was hard.  two very different textures did not match well at all.  For the BBQ, I ordered scallop, Kalbi, Harami, Tongue, Chicken fondue.  They have 3 kinds of sauce, Ponzu, Sweet Soy, Spicy sauce.  The Ponzu was blend with out a kick or freshness.  The Sweet soy is too sweet that over powers the meat flavor easily, and you can just tell it was thickened by corn starch.  spicy sauce was Korean style base which was still on the sweet side.  So I am not impress with the sauce.  The scallop was fresh and I have no complaint.  But the meat is really just so so.  The reason is that the cut was bad.  some thick, some thin, some stringy, some wide.  they just want to make it to the weight, (which is only 4 to 5 oz. per order) for $9.00!  And they cut the meat along the grain.  which is a huge no no for bbq.  I feel like they want to cut cost by using the end parts and cut the meat any way they can to make the portion.  The marinate was too sweet and overpowering the meat flavor.  However the marinate flavor was not too bad, So if you like Korean bbq style, you will like it but If you like real Japanese BBQ, you should go try Yagyu( the 2 story building by the China town) They do it right.  The chicken, they use breast, which is very dry, and the fondue is just not what I am expecting when I am trying to eat bbq.  The cheese was overpowering.  The chicken was sticking on the grill.  The grill they use is metal, really easy to get blacken by the sweet sauce.  thats why the server has to change it so often(in the middle of your cooking)  I prefer Yagyu's.  They use cast iron grill, you can put a block of beef fat on it to enhance the flavor.  And the chicken will not stick.  Because yagyu is the first ""Japanese"" bbq place in town, so I compare between the two a lot.  For the draft beer, hands down yagyu is far better.  The mug was stored below freezing.  So when the beer comes, the whole mug is covered with frost and the beer was frozen in side the mug and float to the top.  If you are beer lover, you really have to go try Yagyu's draft beer.  Tonight's beer just looks sad.  And I don't like their rice.  To me, a perfectly cooked rice is just as important as the meat.  because you eat them together.  Rice brand or the type of grain of the rice was not good.  For $1.95 a bowl, they should put out something better.  Over all, for the environment, and if you want to impress some people, they will do the job.  The food is acceptable.  But for the bbq, Yagyu is the way to go.",X339TgJNbDrB-SuMqcnc5Q,5,1,2,IDuYnv2rOh2sLGAqTqocmw

The meat is marinated well and they have ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy sauces at each table (the spicy sauce was my favorite, it's more sweet than spicy). You have to cook your own food and I recommend someone to keep an eye on the food because most meats cook faster than you think.

Their HH is not the best value ever as most items were only $1-2 dollars off (not half off like most places).  As soon as we were seated our server brought waters and turned on the grill.  Our server was absolutely wonderful, helpful, friendly, and every time he dropped off a raw item he gave us advice on how to cook it.  
.
$57.40 got us a gyu salad (half portion), an order of spring rolls, infusion edamame, chicken karaage, garlic rice, white rice, cheesy corn, duck breast, kobe beef, shrimp, and filet mignon.  
. 
Gyu-Kaku Salad (half portion is $3.95)- Romaine I think with hard-boiled egg, some sort of radish on top (maybe daikon?), red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, and a dressing sort of like thousand island.  It was fresh and crispy and I liked it. 
. 
Vegetable Spring Rolls ($2.99)-Lovely crispy thin wonton wrapper and was served piping hot but unfortunately the inside was total mush.  I would pass on these.  
. 
Infusion edamame ($3.50)- Cooked well but was swimming in an orange fat and garlic which I was burping up all day.  Although it was tasty, I do not recommend it if you have a sensitive tummy. 
. 
Chicken Karaage ($2.99) Delicious slivers of dark meat chicken fried to a perfect crisp with an orange mayo-based sauce.  Just get five orders of this and don't share.  
.
Garlic rice ($3.99) Very large portion but tasted awful to me.  Rice was overcooked and mushy but it was full of raw garlic and piles of sauteed onions.  I would pass on this.  Definitely don't eat this if you have a date because you will not be called for a second date.   
.
Cheesy corn ($3.95) Maybe 4 spoon-fuls of canned corn and the cheese was missing.  Not impressed. 
.
Duck breast ($6.95) I wasn't expecting duck at a yakiniku place but it was very fresh and each piece had a nice strip of fat.  It was delicious.  
. 
Kobe flat-iron steak ($12.95) So tender and delicious.  Nice marbling of fat.  Didn't even need sauce with this one.  Highly recommend.  
. 
Garlic Shrimp ($5.95) Shrimp were huge and succulent but the garlic marinade was somewhat chemical-tasting.  Did not enjoy.  
.
Filet mignon ($6.95) 21 day dry aged chunks of filet mignon.  Incredibly tender and delicious, although they really needed some salt or dipping sauce.

5745699,2015-01-01,0,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"We've been here several times in 2014, and continued on into New Years Day lunch. FYI- They are normally not open for lunch. 

Normally you go to a restaurant for service, food taste and quality, and lastly price. At least that's what I look for in a restaurant that we frequent.

Service: When we first discovered Gyu-Kaku, the service was prompt, attentive ad courteous.  Fast forward 3-4 months later, we waited for seats in a half empty restaurant.  Our meats were not served at the same time.  As in we went through 6 different meats and then the 7th showed up.  This was after we ate the first 6.  And this was just my husband and I dining.  Not to mention the disappearing soda refill that appeared 10 minutes later. Not happy since he was now a grumpy lunch date.

Food Taste: We love the taste of the food here. Simple. Easy. Delicious. It helps when you're the chef! I haven't purchased any pre-cooked items from the kitchen.

Food Quality: I have to admit that Gyu-Kaku is highly consistent with their cuts of meat and seasonings. Tender Filet Mignon! Beefy Angus Beef Ribs. Chicken seasoned impeccably.  

Price: Happy Hour is a steal!  And there are two time periods 5-6:30 and after 9pm. 

The customer service will deter us from returning, but the food taste and quality makes me want to come back.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,1,0,2,VtoNG8EYyIvp2RGhjUE1OA
5752502,2015-12-30,0,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"We had the most terrible experience in a Gyu-Kaku. First the cooktop didn't work. The server came by trying to work it. It didn't work. The host came by trying to work it, he insisted to come by after 2 minutes despite us telling him it's been ten minutes and it didn't work!! So he had to move us after that. A ramen noodle came after EVERYTHING was finished. By the time the check comes, we were charged 2 miso soups that were part of the lunch combos we ordered, an extra meat, and a more expensive combo for a total difference of $15. The waiter looked as if he's surprised that he's caught. Carefully inspect your check before you pay. We've been to other Gyu-Kaku before, and we were here solely because we had good experiences in other locations, and it turned out so disappointing. As we were straightening out the check, the table to the left of our new table had a cooktop/grill malfunction, and they had to move those customers. Then as we were leaving, a new group of guest were placed on that very same table. It made me think they knew what grills don't work, but they place the costumer there regardless.

The food was alright. Some were the same like the ones back home but some tasted really different. For one, the cheese wontons had a weird cheese dip for it when usually it would come with japanese mayo. This made me sad because it was one of my favorites at gyukaku. But overall, nothing beats the gyukaku back in Hawaii. I would still try this place again.

We got the meat-lovers platter and the happy hour platter, so we really got to sample most of the meat offered, even tongue and liver, and a ton of drinks. I think the whole idea is fun, cooking your own perfectly seasoned food, but I did find it a bit pricey. 

There are plenty of other Korean BBQ places that give you all you can eat for cheaper prices.

Gyu-Kaku is a wonderful place to eat but dirty and grimy. I knew nothing of this place other than Yelp reviews. As I pulled up to the restaurant I realized that I had seen this place a 100 times or more as I drove by it. It's unassuming, not a hole in the wall, but nothing that ever jumped out to me to pique my interest.

Walking in, I realized this place had been there for a while or at least appears to have. Sitting down at the table I noticed stains on my wife's napkin. This quickly set off all in the party looking at silverware, napkins, table, surroundings. It was dirty, not a place I like to eat at. We were there though and I had a gift card from a Christmas present so we decided to hold our noses and push on. (It didn't smell bad, just using as an expression)

To my delight, the food was all very good. All the meats tasted well and since you cook your own food I would like to give compliments to the chef! We ordered a large array of meats with different seasonings and marinade. I couldn't tell you which one I like the most because they were all truly wonderful. The only thing we didn't enjoy were the garlic mushrooms, they lacked flavor, not what we expected. 

The service was okay, we waited at least 25 minutes to get our check and another 10 once she took our cards to pay. This is mostly overlooked because my wife and I enjoyed our friends company. Our waitress did take time to explain menu items and was pleasant. 

Overall I would go back, the food was very good. I hope it was a one off with the service and that ownership will take this as a hint that maybe they need to go through their building and do a nice deep cleaning. Serious though how easy is it to not place dirty napkins back on the tables, lazy!

5915246,2015-11-23,3,NblDoJBEwhkJyvAuxzh4rg,"Gyu kaku is the largest yakiniku chain to arrive in americaland and they set a pretty decent standard of what a yakiniku experience would look and feel like in Japan. 

A tip for the Noobs: 
You can have the meat marinated and prepared any way you want. I you just say I want the Kalbi. they will just bring you whatever they have done or just the plain cut. I think that most ot the people with marginal reviews here are because the reviewer did not know how to pick the meat.

My favorite meat/sauce combinations are:
Kalbi miso
Harami miso
Garlic sirloin
Toro beef gochujang
Kalbi gochujang

If you aren't sure on the meat/sauce combo, then the best course is to order a set.
I will be honest and say I'm not a fan of the prepared foods that come with the meal sets. The chicken karaage and cheese gyoza are just meh: fried fillers. The sushi is not anything special and I have to keep reminding myself that I'm here for meat not sushi. I don't expect Jiro level sushi but it's still mediocre even for American west coast standards. 

Their happy hour is probably one of the best in town especially the late night super happy hour (red prices on the menu).

Gyu-Kaku is now the de facto place to go for Japanese yakiniku in Vegas. Go for the meat and beer and nothing else.

Nevertheless we decided to just put the dirty dishes off to the side of the bar. The bartender then comes to us and wipes the bar. I greeted her and she greeted me back with the same exact greeting I gave her and started laughing( seemed like she was mocking me.) My car keys were on the bar. She took them, wiped the bar then threw my keys on the bar. She just laughed. I didn't think it was funny. She seemed intoxicated because she was taking shots with the customers. Then we were deciding to get something to eat from the bar. She over heard mr and said ""If you guys wanna order food just wait  be seated coz I'm closing the bar soon."" Only to find out the bat doesn't close till 12?! Then a couple sat at the bar and I could see her rolling her eyes coz she got new customers.

The drinks were tasty and cheap, so I give them three stars for that. I'd be back for that alone. 

As far as the food, I would skip most of the items we ordered including the ramen, crispy rice with tuna and even the pork belly. They were pretty stingy with the meat dishes and the flavor on the rest of the food was just disappointing overall. The ramen had an unpleasant flavor to it that I can't quite identity and the tuna was not particularly fresh and the rice wasn't crispy enough. It had a very fishy smell and taste that I found unappealing. The pork belly wasn't fatty enough and kept sticking to the grill. The only items I would order again on the food front was the kalbi

Service: Could improve 
Overall Opinion: Go somewhere else

Been to Gyu-Kaku many times before in Southern-California. Always had a great experience but the Las Vegas location was very disappointing. Came here to celebrate my birthday with my friends and got the Premium AYCE price for $42. Our server, Erik, was very professional and kind but the overall experience would not bring me back to this location.

As a party of 6, it took the kitchen awhile to get our meat order out. We were in no rush, so it wasn't a big deal. When the food came, they were overly salted. This included salads being drenched in dressing and beef tongue having a white layer of salt. It was so bad that we asked them to take it back. I had to eat a good chuck of rice to balance out the saltiness. I guess this is how they make their customer's eat more rice instead of meat. 

Felt bad for Erik. He was working many tables and the kitchen wasn't helping his cause. Needed to get a grill change and it took us about 10 minutes to get his attention. Wasn't the best service but it wasn't his fault that the restaurant was under-staffed. Thanks Erik!

Got the bill and of course there was gratuity since we had a party of six. The thing that irked me was that they taxed gratuity. Not sure if it was legal to tax gratuity but they did.",vf0lDyVwhzDH9G3nv3Hu4g,0,0,1,m75va21X93DgmLjBdxVjLA

Then we asked about the all you can eat, we could do that too. We were told that we had to sit down and order it, and we get the 90 min for our $30 all you can eat. Nice! So we wait, patiently. Get seated and ask for a booster, 20 min go by and my toddler is swinging around in the restaurant making me not even want to eat there anymore!!! But i stay patient. No booster, no waters, no server! Then, when our server does come we get told 1. There are NO KID MENUS!!! I have 5 kids so this is important to me. I was getting up to leave. And i ask to speak to a manager who by the way still did not approach me to apologize for any confusion or clarification. 

But my server comes back and tells me that we can do the kid menu. cool, we can do that. So we start ordering again. 

Only to find out that we still couldn't do the dang kid menus if we wanted to do the damn $30 all you can eat?!

I left and CALLED this time to speak to a manager. Still NO answer NO CLARIFICATION!

This is by far the worst experience ive ever had. Honestly i don't care if its Christmas -- and that you're busy. You are a restaurant establishment! That is expected to be professional!! And this was nothing of that sort! My family of 7 walked out and left. 

This is upsetting on the miscommunication and lack of effort on their side who ended up putting the server in the middle!!! The server is not at fault, to me its the damn manager!!!
