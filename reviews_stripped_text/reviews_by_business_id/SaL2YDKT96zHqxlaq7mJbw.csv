74733,2010-08-20,0,SaL2YDKT96zHqxlaq7mJbw,I'm a little reluctant to let people in on this secret. I eat here several times or more each week. The quality of food is exceptional for a local bar. They run excellent half price specials. The service is always great for me. The staff is friendly.

Came in with my kids and went to the dining room separated from the bar because the kids aren't allowed in the bar area. That's when I remembered why I hadn't been back for so long. Due to the separation of the two rooms, no one ever checks to see if there is anyone in the dining room.
I glanced around to see if they had any cameras so people could see if anyone was there. Nope. The windows to the bar were just about a couple feet above the back of the bench seating so nobody can visually see if anyone was in there.
3 minutes went by. Kitchen staff employee #1 walked from the kitchen to the bathroom. That's a good sign. He'll alert the wait staff that there was a dude with 2 kids waiting in the dining room.
4 minutes pass. Kitchen staff employee #2 walked from the kitchen to the bathroom. Seems he changed and was leaving for the day. He exited out the bar entrance. Maybe he would tell someone that there were people there. Nada.
5 minutes later we leave.

Please continue to come here for awesome food. But if you are like me no matter how good the food is, if you don't pay attention to the people who walk in the door when they are hungry it makes no damn difference.",4LPc0QJE3cJpy1wy6e4Rig,1,0,1,V5YKKuwgGDOxDDRzGK2-jQ

The bartender is fun, upbeat, and attentive. The beer is fresh and cold.  The burgers are the best I've had in this city. Huge, perfectly seasoned, cooked to the requested doneness, and consistently wonderful from one visit to the next.  They always make me swoon.  The sweet potato fries (I haven't tried the regular ones) are cris[p and obviously homemade.  They are served with a delicious dipping sauce.  And  the star of the show is the server, Jackie.   She is so pleasant and professional. Although she works the whole room by herself, she is always there when we need her.  She anticipates our needs, and does  thoughtful little extra things,  like bringing extra napkins and water  ""just in case you might need it"".  She even made an extra trip to our table just to thank us for the tip.  

If you live anywhere near Durango and Desert Inn and want a pleasant, laid back experience with delicious food, this is the place to go.",VS0GAtsa3CdoQ11fkz8JpA,1,0,5,SDjA_q1bY01WYcgk6amckQ

My beer was fine, but selection could be better. There was a ton of food options, but nothing really jumped out at me. My friend enjoyed a burger, but said it was just a burger. Nothing special or spectacular for his taste-buds. 

The atmosphere was very nerving. The bartender didnt really seem to partake much in his customers. Sat and watched tv if no one needed anything. Even when I had this very intoxicated old man who almost fell on me twice, the bartender still did nothing. He was clearly too drunk for his own good. His friends were just as obnoxious and did nothing.

My buddy said they had good burgers so I had to form my own opinion.  I went with the ""Philly Burger"" topped with sauteed red and green peppers, provolone cheese plus all your burger fixins LTO. The 1/2 lb patty was no joke! and came out seasoned well on a toasted artisan sesame seed bun.  Burger was thick, juicy and very filling.  Well done Porchlight!  The sweet potato fries were also good.  Topped with powdered sugar and a side of syrup, the 
portion was generous.  Overall good burger but of course I have not met a cheeseburger I did not like. 

Other entertainment can be had at Porchlight.  They have a pool table, dart board, Golden tee and some sofa seating to chill.

We stopped in the Porchlight Grill for some appetizers before heading to the park. This place is pretty nice, once side is the bar and the other is the restaurant side which is dived by a glass wall.

Our server was very friendly and helpful. I got simple mozzarella sticks, one thing I will say is their marinara sauce is delicious, it wasn't bland, and you could tell it was fresh which tied those mozzarella sticks together.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,3,1,5,KbgJcuhgNpXYecjQONNB7g

This is the best late night burger and I would come during regular hours but might as well wait till midnight when it's half off.

The gaucho wings's flavor is definitely one of a kind.  They are buttery, full of cilantro and garlic and is a perfect compliment to a nice ice cold brew.

Upon arriving in the late evening there were only two other people in the bar other then the Bartender and Waitress.  The bartender never once looked up from texting on his phone nor did he even acknowledge our presence.  We sat in a booth near the bar, when the waitress finally came over she was also of the same mindset. No friendliness or small talk with us. After we decided we just wanted some wine, we asked if the bottles were available to purchase (to save some money, there were 3 of us). She laughed and said no. Then the Bartender finally looked up from his phone and told her we could get a bottle.  We asked for a bottle with 3 glasses of ice.  When she brought us the bottle we again asked for the ice, but no luck.  Once the bottle was opened  we never saw her again.  Never got our Ice, we got up and got our own. Sat there for roughly 2 hrs and she walked by 1 time to check on us, mind you there were about 4 people in the place so it wasn't like it was busy.  After our bottle was empty we waited for her to come back by so we could order some more drinks, she never did. Bartender was busy doing his own thing.  Finally after a while we  saw her sitting at the bar with some male customers that had just come in, so we thought she was off duty.  No she just sat there laughing and joking around with them all the while the rest of the bar was ignored. We finally got up and asked for our check, and she got up and went back to work.  (well if you can call it that) we cashed out, they made up some ridiculous price for the bottle of cheap red wine we had ( $30.00 they serve the same at Olive Garden for 22 a bottle) (our mistake I guess we should have asked how much it would be) and left.  I have never see worse service or a more UNFRIENDLY staff at a bar. Will never go back and will spread the word this place is not for anyone who expects a drink or service.  Too bad, we never even got a chance to order a bite to eat. If i were the owner I would spend some time there without their knowledge  to see his staff in action.  My rating....poor poor poor.

I had a turkey melt with avocado and it was great.  But the best part is that apparently from 12am-3am, everything on the menu is 50% off.  So what was normally a $9 sandwich cost me under $5.

I've been looking for a great local hangout for months now, and although I don't go out every weekend, I've been slowly crossing off options. Some friends and I literally stumbled upon Porchlight after pulling in to investigate the brew pub signage and looking to see if it was open. 

After a quick Yelp search and mention of comfy couches, we figured why not have a drink here! Wow what a surprise it was!

The inside of this place is beautiful, and there is plentiful, modern, and comfortable seating all around. They had a big display with alcohol and other items that was really cool as well. They also had a pool table, darts, and golden tee! What else could you need?!

Here's what I look for in a bar:

1) nice atmosphere 
2) good beer
3) good prices
4) some games to play
5) great service 

This place hit the first 4 in stride, but the great service is what will make this my favorite bar going forward. We had Bridgette as a server, and she was positively wonderful! She was attentive, friendly, very honest and helpful. 

We put money in the pool table, and it didn't give us all the balls, when I was only asking about if this is common and if there's some trick to get them out, the manager was so apologetic and said they were supposed to put up an out of order sign... He said he would take a drink off the bill! Without me saying anything extra! Wow!

The drinks were also insanely well priced. 6.50 for a huge Guinness, yes please.  

I won't be bringing my business anywhere else for awhile, and I can't wait to come watch some basketball games on their huge projector screen! The dart machine was also a serious amount of fun, who knew?",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,2,1,5,5Ej-Jrlp4M5SPwRbgMIoFQ

The Porchlight Grille offers this Bloody Mary only on the last Sunday of the month. It's $20, but it's so worth it. Not only does it come with enough garnish for a whole meal, but it comes in a huge beer mug with 4 shots of Kettle One Vodka. They have a house made Bloody Mary mix. I really enjoyed it. Very tangy, but had a perfect spice. Now the garnish. It has a lobster tail. Yes, you read right a lobster tail, but that's not all. It also had a cherry pepper, spicy pickles, pepperoni, cheese, a slice of cucumber and tomato, a piece of steak and a shrimp. Wow! It really was the best Bloody Mary ever. 
So they also have a full menu. Everything sounded so good. Joel ended up ordering a Mushroom Burger and it actually came out medium like he asked for. I totally wanted what Carrie got which was an Avocado Turkey Melt. She also shared her Fried Artichoke Hearts with me. Yum! Perfectly crisp and not greasy at all. 

Our waitress was friendly and could have been a little more on point. But I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. It was busy and she didn't have much help. She forgot Carrie's drink, but when she brought it she said it was on her. Mistakes happen!

The ambiance was nice and the drinks were actually really good.  There is nothing I hate more than when you are served your cocktail and it has been over poured with your vodka.  I want my drink to taste good like a drink not some super strong shot.

Where we arrived at shift change we got the service of both bartenders.  They were both chatty and friendly.  They didn't act put out where one was leaving while the other was coming.  I will mention that I do find it interesting that many establishments allow there staff to stay after and drink/gamble.  Not sure I agree with it but who am I to say anything.  I don't own the place.  They have a midnight to 3am happy hour and the food being served looked pretty good.  I don't like walking out of a bar and smelling like an ash tray but in Vegas you really don't have much of an option.",9KCoXFS7alSJsGfFsZANFQ,3,2,4,8n5K1icY-4xuiALRFvfjuA

Our bartender remembers us and our preferences. He even created me a delicious drink based on me asking for something delicious! Happy hour is amazing and their food is excellent! I love getting a pepperoni and garlic pizza!!! Definitely my favorite local bar !!,zb91FkpRD_RtutKPg08WRQ,0,0,5,TnDr1yXlTHhb5YhYriLhhA

Great place to watch a game (plenty of TVs) or just hang out.  I'm not really a video poker guy, but they have that too if you are interested.  Overall, always enjoy the food and time hanging out with family here.  Would definitely recommend to friends.",lpnn6dQKO2shB7RjBQ2a8Q,0,0,5,9ZzaBJWpVthOZileNJh8ZA

They are open 24 hours with quality food and specials all the time!
We ordered 1/2 Turkey Avocado Bacon sandwich with 1/2 Prime Rib French dip sandwich with side salad. Delicious!
They offer a non-smoking section, in addition to a fun filled bar - gaming area with plenty of room in both areas.  There is something for everyone. 
This is a MUST try business.
We are already planning our next trip to include our whole family!",FCg8iEZeg6VOMncIMU2GzA,3,0,5,957UOdSoMFO7CIQulRGzsg
5583263,2011-09-11,0,SaL2YDKT96zHqxlaq7mJbw,"Wanted to try a new place on a Saturday Night but didn't want to pay strip prices for good food.  Saw the photos of the food at Porchlight on their website and knew it was the place to try.  We got there and the dining area was deserted.  Poked my head into the connected bar which was about half filled with patrons.  The Waitress said she would be right over and sure enough came quickly.  I asked her if the food was good and she told me it was very good and she would buy my dinner if I didn't like it.  Whether she mean't it or not, I intended to hold her to it if the food was horrible.  Luckily for her and for me and the fam, it wasn't horrible.  In fact it was pretty good especially for the reasonable price.  I am surprised that the dining area was deserted the entire time we ate there which, on a saturday night around 7 there should have been someone else there.  We started with the fried artichoke hearts which were good but could have used a garlic mayo based sauce instead of, or in addition to, the marinara and butter sauce they provided.  I had the French Country Chicken which was in a nice brie sauce with lots of flavor.  My wife had the Turkey Club which was very good.  The daughter had the pizza which I thought was very well crafted for a kids pizza.    I have a feeling this place would be better if they had a regular dining crowd instead of the occasional diner as the food, although good, was a bit off.  There were a lot of other interesting dishes to try next time, and there will be a next time.
Give it a try! Expect good, hearty food at a great price and you won't be disappointed.

9/16/2012 update: They are really making an effort to increase business and track Yelp reviews!  The food is excellent.  Give it a try!  The staff is very friendly!",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,0,0,4,edWdo0DTacIH10zxqMblrg

Well this place solves it all, their menu is half off 12am-3am. Literally everything !!!! I order a 10 piece chicken wing which comes with celery, carrots, and sauces of your choice for only $5.39. Not bad if you ask me, luckily this place is just less then a minute from me. Would go back to this place for my drunk nights. Ahahaha",w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,2,1,4,ADguNK4kmba02XZJy_O_vw

Otherwise I would give this place a negative star if I could. 

Looking for a bar close to home, maybe become a regular even... 

I come into this place for the first time, to watch and enjoy the ALABAMA/MICH ST game (ROLL TIDE BTW), and the place is pretty empty. We sit at the bar to order a bunch of food, beer, and some shots. 

About an hour later some guy with long hair (the owner from my understanding) comes in stares daggers at me and my friend.  A couple minutes later he has the bartender, who in turn has the waitress kick us off the poker machine bar area if we aren't playing. 

Ok np I stick $20 in the machine and start playing. So as I start playing... this guy continues to stare daggers at me as he's leaving the bar, while I'm playing! At this point I'm getting ticked off. I don't know if it's because we look young, but were well into our 30s. 

Idk whatever the reason may have been, it was not right... He made us feel very uncomfortable, uneasy, and not to mention pissed off now. Needless to say we hung around for a little bit longer even bought some more shots, but we will never ever return to this *5hit hole* 

If some douche bag owner doesn't care that we're in his bar buying a ton of food and shots and only cares about the machine play, then he should just load the dam place with slot machines, so no one can eat in front of the tv, watching a game, while drinking and utilizing the bar as intended.

*end rant!* 

Have a wonderful day yelpers but NOT at this awful PORCHLIGHT FAIL.         ^.^v",Z7V_9siP_WxsTvYeZj2xfQ,13,2,1,dRRQ2QydoOYOLqyeLaZ_Kg

5928915,2013-07-18,1,SaL2YDKT96zHqxlaq7mJbw,"When we first moved to Vegas, a family friend took us here for lunch. It is a bit smokey inside, which is surprising because I never really see many people here. So far, most of the food I have ordered was pretty good. My favorite has been the Turkey Melt. Sounds boring, I know, but it was delicious with avocado and sourdough bread. The one thing I would not recommend is their Tri-Tip Sliders. The bread was too crunchy, making them difficult to eat and leaving a mess.

The bar area is very clean. They have couches in front of their huge flat screen TV where you can relax and watch sports. If there is a specific game you want to watch, just ask and they will happily put it on for you. Service has always been friendly and attentive.

Sometimes I wonder how this place stays in business, since its not crowded at all. Maybe business picks up during football season? I don't drink alcohol, so I usually don't hang out at bars. However, because of the good food, calm environment and location, I don't mind coming here at all.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,5,4,4,Q4jhz25p3emGef_bMSjwxg
