If you like spicy and sour food, this is the place to come to.

The cold noodle dish is prepared with hot chili oil and vinegar. There appears to be random bits of spongy soy product around. Not an issue, especially since they soak up a lot of flavor.

The ""Chinese burger"" is basically slightly salted pulled/shredded beef placed between two pan seared round flat bread. Highly recommended. Add a little bit of the leftover sauce from the cold noodle dish for a little kick.

BBQ: tried the lamb and beef tongue
lamb is highly seasoned, very spicy. There's a hint of game typical of lamb that you can notice, but only if you taste for it.
beef tongue is not as spicy, but definitely a bit chewy. 

Another dish, noodle based, is seasoned like their cold noodle dish, except everything is hot (temp wise), and the noodles are long and thick, with some green onion and bean sprouts. Again, spicy and sour, just the way I like it. Noodles are nice and appropriately chewy. Just the right amount of ""QQ.""

The Service:
it's a chinese restaurant. what more could you possibly expect?

The Ambiance:
See above.

Conclusion:
Sour and spicy food. BBQ is tasty (but spicy!) and not terribly overpriced for what you get. Will return in the future.",zAqfO6-rw1Bjsxu1zmXspQ,1,0,4,iqvkp09tgM7KQv7e8c-nrQ

Service:
When we went here, it was Monday night and there were only 3 or 4 tables occupied.  Two waiters, both young 20 somethings.  For some reason our waitress decided to clear and clean all of the tables in the restaurant instead of coming to our table to see if we were ready to order.  We were waiting, puzzled, for at least 15 minutes.  I think you just have to be more assertive and shout for service when you need it here.  

Food:
We ordered the lamb soup with clear noodles (shui pen yang).  This was delicious and warming, with thick slices of lamb and thick, round clear noodles.

Cumin Lamb- tiny fatty lamb pieces stir fried with chile, cumin, onions and red bell peppers.  Nice dish, but we probably would have been better off just getting lamb skewers since the flavor profile is pretty similar.

Eggplant, potato, and bell pepper stir fry (Di san xian)- really awesome dish!  The potato and eggplant pieces were perfectly crisped up to receive the sauce.  This is a large dish and can easily by itself be a meal for 2 people.",IjxJiSab2aQ7gP35jAMh3w,1,0,4,cWt3S-AB5SMS0wZBVwxkvg
1566887,2012-12-31,6,ySHeT6Y6HuCxYoe27swKrw,"Lambs beware! This place serves up tasty lamb in so many ways, grilled, stewed, boiled, fried you name they got it! Bad for lambs but good for us. I typically hate lamb for its gamey taste however this place does lamb right. I'm also assuming this place came from California since their website says Rosemead so I'm glad that Cali food is coming over. 

Lamb skewers are THE thing to get here. The lamb is very tender and fatty. They then pile on authentic spices which covers up the gamey taste. This is pretty much as close as you can get to authentic chinese lamb skewers in Vegas so definitely try this. 5 pieces for $6.

Another thing to try are the cold noodles with sesame sauce. The noodles are thick and chewy which I like and drenched in a chili oil/seasame sauce with small chunks of bean curd. Very tasty! and only $3.50

Service was good enough.  Server stopped by and checked on us and don't be afraid if you don't speak chinese cuz they do!

2002543,2013-12-30,1,ySHeT6Y6HuCxYoe27swKrw,"My heart breaks to write this as so many reviews lead me to believe this was another Booming Hot-Pot discovery of Chinese bliss - a unique Chinese cuisine experience waiting for me to dive in head first.  Sadly, not so much.

After fighting a cold for the last couple of weeks, seeing check-in's for Shaanxi Gourmet coupled with mentions of an epic ""lamb with noodle"" soup as well as appetizing photos drew me to arrive at said restaurant for dinner on a Saturday night around six.  Shaanxi specializes in the titular region of Chinese known for pork and lamb meat.  That's fantastic - I'm a big fan of both, particularly lamb.  

I read up on the reviews and understood that this was hole-in-the-wall drab decor with friendly service and great food that had rather blah decor and sometimes required paging the staff for refills.  Okay, that's manageable.  

However.  The server couldn't understand ANY English.  I had to point at what I wanted.  I had to point at a pot of tea to show I wanted hot tea.  I asked for another serving of soup, he brought a bowl.  Beyond the language barrier, our server forgot half of our order!  I had to remind him after chasing him down for another menu to point at this.  I eat at a lot of foreign restaurants that I can get past the language barrier but it was poor, overwhelmed service coupled with a lack of comprehension.  

The epic soup?  Completely devoid of any and all flavor.  Even ramen and pho that has strong condiments at the table to flavor the soup to your liking has a strong flavor to begin with that is only complimented by the table fixings.  This was just... beyond me.  Super thick noodles and giant chunks of lamb, awesome.  Flavorless soup?  Bland?!  I was so just disappointed with all of this.  The lamb skewers were tiny for what I expected and slightly over-seasoned.  

So frustrating.  And 25 dollar credit card minimum?  Forget this place.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,2,3,2,WOYLE98cLY4FdxYUm-jDPQ
2837540,2013-02-10,1,ySHeT6Y6HuCxYoe27swKrw,"I was recently introduced to this new kid on the Spring Mountain block by a friend visiting from out of town since he noticed an ad in a local Asian publication for this place specializing in Shaanxi cuisine and he had done a study abroad in the Shaanxi province back in college.  There were a few dishes he was yearning to have since then and we thought to check this place out to see how they measured up.  

For those unfamiliar with Shaanxi cuisine, it is a underpopulated northwestern Chinese province with heavy use of pork and lamb in their dishes and they also have specialized dishes with regards to thick breads and noodles.  The profile for most dishes emphasizes combining sour and spicy with strong and heavy flavors.

We began the meal with their lamb sandwiches.  Spicy lamb cooked enclosed by a Chinese pita, the crunchy exterior provides a starchy contrast to the tender lamb with a carnitas like consistency.  

Lamb skewers- served along long metal rods, the lamb was aggressively seasoned with a dry rub of chili and cumin yet the meat itself is tender and fatty like a good ribeye.

The dish that prompted this visit was the lamb ""pao mo"" since my friend waxed poetic about his time abroad being served a spicy lamb stew and a side of thick crusty pita-like bread that he had to tear into bite-size pieces by hand much like one would place oyster crackers into a chowder and allow the bread to soak in the broth for 10 minutes to absorb the flavor and soften up into a chewy noodle-like texture.  Here the dish is served with the bread pre-soaked and it is accompanied by garnishes of red chili-paste, cilantro, and pickled garlic cloves.  I thought the dish was tasty, but I'm curious how this compares to the read deal since the bread pieces essentially tasted like a well-cooked handpulled noodle diced into little cubes (I'm wondering if they cheated and actually used pre-boiled noodle bits) and it's one of those dishes that diminishes in quality the longer you eat it since each bite gets heavier and more cloying on the tongue.  My theory is that either the liquid gets soaked up by the bread or the starches are gradually released into the broth.  I recommend splitting one bowl to share so that it is consumed quickly for maximum quality and there is also a ""supreme"" version that sounds more promising since it has additional condiments of bean curd, wood-eared mushrooms, and other veggies to lighten this dish a bit more.  

There are also several options for the adventurous eater such as lamb haggis stew and other forms of offal (pig's ear, ox tongue, chicken gizzards) and I'm looking forward to trying some of their handmade noodle dishes the region is famous for on my next visit.  My advice would be to go for the lamb and noodle dishes (as Ron Burgundy would say, ""When in Shaanxi..."") and allow your tastebuds to go into baa-baa booey overdrive.

3.5 stars but with a half star bump due to originality and authenticity and I feel confident there are some standout dishes I have yet to try that other trusty yelpers will soon elucidate to me in time.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,5,3,4,MdAMxlgPG9Wqkl_68u7Rgw

We started with the cold noodles in sesame sauce, as well as the Ox tongue/tripe in chili sauce. The cold noodles are handmade, thick and chewy. Delicious. The Ox tongue was dry and had the consistency of hard salami. The dish is served cold, and the chili sauce is so overwhelming that I was not able to taste the meat thought the heat.

We moved onto the lamb sandwich. Delicious little chucks of lamb, diced and served with an abundance of fresh/chopped jalapenos served in a Chinese pita. We also ordered lamb skewers as well as chicken gizzard skewers. Both meats were encrusted after cooking in a pungent spice mix. The pieces of meat, no bigger than a sugar cube, crunched from the over abundance of spice mix. The taste of the meat was once again lost.

The wife and I finished by splitting a bowl of the lamb stew with bits of pita added to the stew to serve as a form of noodle. The broth was rich and tasty, a few tender  slices of lamb lay across the top of the bowl. Overall rich and satisfying. 

No one dish stood out as excellent. I'm not sure if we will be back, not with so many other interesting restaurants still to try. But service was good and the staff helpful with recommendations.",wQCiczL6MRfBNeW1lCGCiw,1,1,3,JLrVLVpMCKCqY5ilmaaiQw

3638256,2013-04-27,0,ySHeT6Y6HuCxYoe27swKrw,"I was drawn here by an article in SEVEN Magazine called ""4th Annual Deals on Meals: Our restaurant crew eats their way across the Valley and comes back with 30 dishes that are heavy on flavor and light on your wallet.""  And I'm so glad I was as Max Jacobson and Graci Bascos definitely delivered on their promise.

This restaurant's Lamb Noodle Soup was featured in the article, by description and photograph.  Add to that, I haven't had lamb since my first time trying it 5-7 years ago and I've been on a soup kick for the last month,  so I was eager to try this dish for myself.  It was absolutely delicious.  It took a while to reach my table, but I have come to appreciate slightly longer wait times if the result is hot and freshly prepared food.  The server brought me complimentary hot tea while I waited which I thoroughly enjoyed (even without being brought sugar lol)  

The Lamb Noodle Soup was a heaping portion of... well, lamb, noodles, and soup.  It also had cabbage in it that I found irresistible... like cabbage I've never had before.  The noodles were long and thin and hearty; the lamb was well cooked and lasted as long as the noodles did.  The ratio of noodles to meat to broth was perfect.  The service was great as well.  I was having difficulty eating this meal with chopsticks and my server noticed.  He politely and tactfully came to my table and asked if I would like a fork, without making me feel awkward or inadequate.  I hadn't realized how strong my pride was that night, as I would have suffered for an hour and a half with those sticks, desparate to make it work.  Once he brought me a fork, my dining experience was instantly elevated and I enjoyed my food 3x more than I had been already.  Him noticing my need for assistance and promptly providing that assistance without making me feel silly was the highlight of my experience.

The only thing I didn't like is the restaurant was really bright (making it a tad cold) and there was no background music which I almost always enjoy.  Also, parking was horrendous.

3993307,2014-04-21,1,ySHeT6Y6HuCxYoe27swKrw,"Terrible, simply terrible. Without a doubt, some of the worst service ever.

We stopped in on a Saturday a little before noon for lunch. Upon entering, there were only two other tables occupied, a party of three and a party of two. No one else was around, after a minute someone stepped out of the kitchen and told us we could sit anywhere. After sitting down we waited a minute before we decided to get up and get some menus. At that point, one of the two workers (I use that term loosely) decide from behind the counter we needed some menus and hand them to us just as we reach the counter. As we return to our seats, the worker also puts some dinnerware on our table. Unfortunately, the meal and experience only went downhill from there. 

We order two cold noodle dishes, two ""hamburgers"", and two cold appetizers from behind the counter. The marinated cucumber and the seaweed appetizers were both really salty. Normally, that's not a problem unless the staff doesn't bring you any tea or water! So after eating the appetizers for a few minutes I can't stand it anymore and ask for water. The two workers stop talking, one of them grabs two, out of many, prefilled glasses of water from off the counter and brings it over to our table. Our cold sesame noodles come next after another few minutes. The workers got tired of talking and one of them decided to assemble out noodle dishes from behind the counter. The noodles are narrower and much thicker than other shaanxi style noodles I've had. Later, we found out the flour used to make the noodles still had the gluten in it. Normally, the gluten is separated from the flour and used to make other dishes, but at this shaanxi restaurant they don't bother, the employee seemed rather proud of this fact.

So after finishing our appetizers and noodles, we waited for our ""hamburgers."" After several minutes of waiting, I got tired of watching the two workers talk and mess with their cell phones behind the counter, so I ask about the last items on our order. With a surprised expression, one of the employees walks over to a toaster oven and pulls out the buns he was toasting. Seeing that they are clearly burnt, he tosses them in the trash, puts two more in, and goes back to talking. I am really excited when we finally receive our pork sandwiches, mostly because I know this crummy ordeal is almost over. The sandwiches were unbelievably dry. I think the idea is for the meat, dripping with juices to moisten the bun and make it similar to a French dip. In reality, I think there was a big heap of shredded pork, all the juices had flowed down to the bottom, and the dried out stuff from the top of the heap was used to make our order. Thank goodness we at least had water to wash these things down.

Bad food and horrible service from employees who seem to hate their job. Definitely will not be returning to this location, unless it goes out business and something else takes over the spot, which by all indications will be soon.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,4,1,1,WwDg7gDftFNez4EmWbmoHg
