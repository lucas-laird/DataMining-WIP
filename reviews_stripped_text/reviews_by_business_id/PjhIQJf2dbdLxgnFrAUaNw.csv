35593,2013-02-26,1,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"I wanted to like Chinita so badly, but just couldn't do it.  I live right around the corner and when I saw the signage going up I initially thought they were going for a Mexican/Chinese concept, similar to Chino Bandito in Phoenix (which btw is amazing if you're ever down in that area).  Hmmm maybe they should have gone that direction.

I arrived about 6 on a Friday night to a half way full restaurant with about three other groups waiting to be seated.  There were plenty of open tables, but for whatever reason we waited 15-20 minutes before being seated.  I understand not wanting to overwhelm the kitchen with the 6pm rush, but seeing all of the open tables while we waited definitely didn't help.

The waiter was very attentive and overall provided very good service.  Chips and salsa were brought to the table pretty quickly and we dove in immediately,  Unfortunately, the salsa was very bland and tasted like it came out of a jar (La Victoria sounds about right).  I asked for something spicier and the waiter brought out something that was even worse.  My dinner date and I opted for the fish tacos and the chimichanga (traditional American Mexican of course).  The fish tacos were pretty good overall, but I couldn't get past the rice and beans.  They were terrible!  Again, the beans tasted like they came out of a can and the rice was very bland.  For a Mexican restaurant, the rice and beans should be your bread and butter, but not here.  The chimichanga was decent, but you could certainly find a better one a Roberto's or other similar places.  To top it all off, the prices were a bit steep in my opinion.  Fish tacos and a chimichanga without drinks just about used up my $30 groupon. :(

The only things saving this restaurant were our server and the decor.  Inside, the place was very nicely decorated and had a good feel to it.  Too bad the food didn't live up to these things.  I would probably try again in the future if the menu was revamped.  Seeing as how they just opened, I don't think it's too late, but until then I'm staying away.",wl3BnGZs0KnOts4M5YLBjw,4,2,2,6ApYFsAcpufiQydXERcO6g

We waited. 15 minutes after our initial  arrival, a waitress asked if we would like to order drinks. It was not busy, at least 85% empty.

Don't be fooled by the humble exterior, this place is huge inside! The bar manager Venny will make you feel right at home as soon as you walk in. 

Bar:
A nice sized bar area with about a dozen stools + casual table seating.
Great Sangria, a good selection of Draft beer & some great happy hour prices
$2-3 Beers, $3 Wells, $5 Sangria or Mexican Bulldogs (+/- $1)

Food:
-House made guacamole was perfect & as fresh as it gets.
-I suggest grabbing a 3 taco plate and trying out a few kinds ($13)
-Carne Asada tacos were the best I've ever had.
-The pulled chicken was good but a little overshadowed by how awesome the Carnitas and Carne Asada were.
-$2 Street Tacos during happy hour.... enough said

Atmosphere:
Chinita's had a great balance of class/style while still retaining a light atmosphere. This place doubles as a great date spot or a place to unwind after a long day. The night I was there they had live music by Toto Zara which was a nice touch.

This place will no doubt become a regular destination for the happy-hour / dinner seekers in the area. Locals need to get in there before the HYPE sets in. derp",aAJwfOCVtORi0nOsZQnX4Q,4,3,5,aLZHNlT-EI3UHam78p17Lg

Wife had the pork chimi, if the dogs could sit at the table they'd probably cock their heads to the side and think ""alpo?"" It was disgusting looking and tasting.
I had the hambergesa, all I tasted was a hamburger with corn salsa on it and no chorizo. The mushy fries were the highlight of my plate.

Food = worst mexican I've probably ever had
Service = excellent, staff was very nice and attentive, and for that, you get one star. Sorry I drew such a look of shock and ""oh shit how do I react"" look from the staff when they asked for everything was, I've never been so compelled to give my opinion because they were very nice.

The best item was my daughter's quesadilla, which was tasty, but is just cheese and tortilla that can't be messed up. My wife ordered a chicken burrito that she said was bland, and didn't care for the sauce on it. I got the Mahi tacos, which were just ok. The fish was fried crisp but still felt mushy, difficult to explain. The best item on my plate was the chipotle aioli.

The $5 sangria was tasty and potent.

1044754,2013-07-22,0,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"I've been to Chinita twice.  The reviews for it on this site are not necessarily inaccurate, but i was impressed enough by the service here that I wanted to sign up and add in my own two cents.

Until recently I've found it difficult to find good Mexican food in Las Vegas.  Chinita fills that void.  The various tacos it offers have been flavorful, the ingredients for other dishes (shrimp ceviche, guacamole) have been fresh, and I haven't found anything wanting.  The service is prompt, friendly, and attentive.  Numerous other restaurants in town should take note.  Even if you don't like Mexican food, it would be worth going here for the refreshing surprise of excellent service.  As a value proposition, I thought the Chinita was very reasonably priced for what I received.

The only issue I can see with the restaurant is the space, being tucked away in a corner in Village Square.  The restaurant does a lot to try to overcome that, with bright signage and outdoor seating, but I have not seen anyone dining outside yet.  The restaurant's interior is very nice and more modern than one would expect.  However, because of the floor plan, there's a lot of open space in the front before the dining area.  As a result one has to venture a good distance into the restaurant before being flagged down by a hostess and seated.  This seems like a small issue, but having a hostess present sends an important message right as someone walks into a restaurant.  Without one, it creates the impression that chaos reigns and that the dining experience will be disorganized (which, again, was not the case at all here, and the great service was even more surprising when we were effectively allowed to seat ourselves).

I'm not going to deny that there's better Mexican food in LA and elsewhere in the country, too, but this is pretty close.  It's certainly good enough that I'm happy to have it within a reasonable driving distance.  I would consider using the room in the back of the restaurant to hold a small event in the future.",VYS2Cn4BhdiOOYuVvmPWIg,0,0,4,FTXUTa8cG6PkzQZHCM7qjQ

The inside is a lot bigger than I expected and the decor is lovely. The service was really good too!

But the most important part, the food, just lacked. The chips and salsa/guacamole were good. Oh and the sangria.

We started off with the crispy quesadilla which was good. Maybe serve it with a side of sour cream?

I had the lunch special with chicken flautas and a pulled chicken taco. I didn't like the flautas, plus I expected them to be crispy... Didn't care for the rice and usually I love Mexican rice. The taco was alright. My boyfriend had the enchiladas. He thought they were alright, nothing special.

I chose combo #3 and selected a cheese enchilada, chicken flauta & a beef taco. It also came with a choice of the soup of the day, salad or rice & beans. We both decided to give the fideo soup a try since it was the soup of the day. While we waited we were given chips and salsa which were tasty. We also ordered the guacamole which was also pretty good.  I have to say though that I was very disappointed in the fideo soup. I love soup, and it didn't taste like any fideo soup I've ever had before. I don't understand how you can mess up fideo soup?? a I'm usually forgiving, it's just to bad my taste buds aren't.",ATFzwgtWq5Z_WiQkE9J4LQ,0,0,3,e3FkFFrIExgiClH1f28uXw

2223154,2013-02-06,0,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"First let me say that I am particular about Mexican food, but I can appreciate different variations from gourmet to street tacos.
Upon entering the restaurant, we received a delayed welcome. We were quickly seated and I immediately noticed the seat was soiled with food. I wiped the mess up with a napkin. The menu has calamari, which instantly makes me question the authenticity. Upon receiving chips n salsa my suspicions were confirmed. The chips were warm and festive red, green, and regular. The salsa was strikingly similar to La Victoria. I ordered tacos with carne asada and carnitas. My date ordered chicken enchiladas. When the plates were delivered, the enchiladas lacked the crema described on the menu. He requested sour cream and was charged $1.50. My carne was good, but had too much fat for my liking. The carnitas were average. Rice and beans tasted like they came from a box and can. Again, I am aware that I am especially hard to please when it comes to rice and beans. Maybe because there isn't much nutritional value, therefore it has to be worth the calories, right? We ordered a sangria and agreed it was more like a cocktail made with Tropicana fruit punch. It wasn't bad, but it didn't seem to contain any wine. 
In a nut shell, the ambiance was fine, service good for a newly opened establishment. The prices are a bit high for the quality. Were it not for the Groupon, it would have received 2 stars.",32YgqDZjqijDz7k8n9G7sQ,1,0,3,9MKPtsGN4gUXd8Al9NzGdg

2496902,2013-01-30,1,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"A delightful Mexican Eatery has opened in Village Square, and I'm shelling out a strong 3 stars (or a weak 4 stars if your glass is half full of tequila!)

Chinita is a full-service, sit-down Mexican Restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere on the inside.  We came in for lunch and shared several items in order to report back to you as thoroughly as possible.

In general, everything we had here was good, but nothing really amazed us.  Our favorite was the carnitas.  We enjoyed them in some tacos, but it was the meat's flavor and preparation that impressed, and I would feel confident ordering carnitas in any option that you fancy.  We also really liked the order of Chinita's en Cazuela (fajitas,) we had the asada variation.  The lunch order is a  1/2 order and is ample to fill you up, as all lunch items come with soup or salad.  We tried both of their soups...a corn tortilla and an albondigas.  The soups were both right on the mark and enjoyable...I shy away from soups a lot in Mexican places because they are often overly salty...these were both tasty and balanced.  We also shared an enchilada, which was good.

Our least favorite aspect of the Chinitas was the salsa.  We are both fans of salsa...especially hot & flavorful ones.  The normal salsa is mild, and not particularly strong in flavor...we quickly asked if they had a hotter salsa.  The salsa they brought out next was a habanero based salsa.  This one had good heat, but was pasty, and vinegary...not too enjoyable, but leaning towards a thick Cholula sauce.  Finally we asked if they had a green salsa.  They brought out a fresh, sweat salsa that lacked the heat normally associated with a tomatillo salsa.  This salsa was my favorite of the lackluster bunch, but left me wanting some heat and boldness...I think my little niece may very well enjoy it though.  

It was lunch...on a workday...so we didn't partake in any specialty beverages, but they seemed to have the normal array of margaritas, tequilas, beers, etc. that you would find at any decent Mexican Restaurant.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but I would stop in again if I was in the area and wanting some Mexican food.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,5,4,3,BXXLwg0a4oUEber-B4kOAw

Answer is....dead wrong.  My wife and I both got incredibly sick...diarrhea and vomiting.  I am almost positive that the cooks put something in the food to make us sick.  Our 2 yr old was severely dehydrated for days

It suggest some Chinese fusion but there is no evidence of such on the menu,  There is some bamboo sticking out of the planters??  They have a very nice patio.  

We tried the queso with shrimp.  Not a win.  It was like the pale cheese goop and not the real stretchy cheese I had hoped for.  In addition, they do not serve it with tortillas, just the chips you already have.  Since it is more of a dip than a queso fundido, I guess that makes sense.  

We also had carnitas tacos.  They were A-OK.  Tender and crispy all at once.  Not bad, not great...just A-OK.  My sister in law was very pleased with her chilaquiles.  My husband was less than impressed with his steak.  He said it was flavorless.  

The chips were yummy, the sangria was tasty and the service was friendly. Prices were fair.  The ambiance is very nice.  However, I am not sure we will go again.  Maybe for a drink.  There is much better Mexican food to be had.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,2,1,3,81ZumomFtPmMXP9YTQUHOQ
4185139,2013-06-12,0,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"We were here on a Thursday at 6 PM and we were one of two seated tables - the place is empty!  Happy hour runs 3-6 and the bar area was pretty full because of that.  There is a nice party room in the back for a smallish party which is kind of a nice feature.  Groupon brought me here or I would've never known this place existed!  There is some outdoor seating out front if you're looking for that.  Inside is pretty, modern and nicely decorated.  I could've sat for hours . . . maybe.

The menu is good size, lots of options -- lots to choose from, like many Mexican restaurants.  Chips and salsa here were yummy - no complaints there.  Average spicy, but that's ok as the kids were able to eat it comfortably. 

I ordered the carnitas burrito - it was good, it wasn't awesomely good, but it wasn't bad.  The rice and beans were microwave quality or canned quality, so I skipped anything more than a bite of those.  Hubby had the chicken & carne asada enchiladas and he too reported, ""good, but not amazing"".  

Service - this is my pet peeve, why are you in a service position if you are inconvenienced by people?  Service was slow and sporadic.",evS0cCehNU_EiDiD3286Jw,0,0,3,ej38UILpnQSPnM8CRcSGHg
4264929,2013-04-18,2,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"I was kinda confused when my husband asked me if I wanted to eat here... It says Chinita (doesn't that mean little Chinese girl?) on the sign, but directly under that, it says ""Mexican Bar & Grill"", intrigued, I am...

A red colored bleu cheese sauce for calamari which was doused in sweet chili sauce... Oh, there's the Chinese. Guacamole lacked seasonings, quesadilla plater was missing the usual salsa, guac and sour cream :(

Unfortunately, the only part of of the night that I enjoyed was the live music. I didn't catch his name but I remember him from the Onyx Bar at Red Rock, uhm, no I don't drink a lot. I love that he plays different instruments and sings! 

I didn't enjoy the food, I get that they're trying to go for a fusion type of restaurant-- sorry, doesn't work.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,3,2,2,tDsZ7TkZiJYZpCTRYqwtcA
4491306,2013-03-05,4,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"I had high hopes for Chinita and I really wanted to like it. The service is top notch but the food is another story. Please keep in mind this is only for the three items I ordered maybe the rest of the menu is great. 

The guacamole was a little expensive and small. They don't even make it in front of you. It was also less chunky than I would expect hand made guacamole to be. It tasted store bought. 

I had the white cheese dip appetizer which was slightly bigger than the guacamole . It was good and my favorite out of the three things I ordered. 

The calamari was my biggest disappointment. They were cut in rings which kind of reminded me of fish bait. It was chewy and rubbery and smelled a bit off. I didn't like the idea that after they breaded the calamari they put some type of sweet sauce on it. It made the breading soggy. The sauce on the side would have been fine there is no need to over sauce the dish. I only ate two bites and the rest I couldn't stomach. The waitress asked if everything was alright but I didn't have heart to say the food was lousy because everyone was really nice.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,4,3,2,FsYCeFOAujpIE3_9MasCRg
4533466,2013-02-07,0,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"Food is tasty but on the pricy side. Had a $30 Groupon and after deductions the bill still came to $29. House wine decent, happy hour prices are good. Ceviche is delish but expected a little larger of a serving.  It comes out on two small tostada shells but again the ceviche is really good. 

I ordered vegetarian enchiladas and boyfriend got one each of the all you ca eat taco special $10. He said they were good, decent sized portions. My enchiladas were tasty - didn't like the beans or Spanish rice but I don't usually like restaurant rice and beans anyway. The plus was they had a live flamenco guitarist playing some wonderful music, he was really good. 

I would only go back to this place if I had another Groupon or if it was happy hour. It's a nice place and all but I don't think you get enough food for your money.",TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ,2,0,4,6CP7tUEuGwErjoEJ6P4qQg

5339857,2013-02-03,1,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"Okay so we went in and I totally thought we were heading for a 5 star meal. It was around 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and the place had like 1 other couple in the whole place. The bartender was also the server and he was really nice... On a side note he looked like a cross between BJ Penn and the chairman guy on Iron Chef America...

The hubby ordered the signature margarita and I ordered Manager's Choice margarita... It was a spicy cucumber margarita and it was delicious. The tri-colored chips and salsa were to my liking... I'm fine with unspicy salsa the BF kinda wasn't. 

We ordered the appetizer sampler and EVERYTHING on the plate was so good. The avocado egg rolls were awesome but the flautas were delish!!!!

The hubby ordered the hambugesa and I ordered the mahi mahi tacos.
We were really excited!! but well...we were disappointed. Their burger looked like a slider patty on a bun (I took pictures) and the hubby said it wasn't that great...especially for the price.

When my tacos came out they looked GREAT!! it came with a baby handful of rice and beans. The rice tasted old and mushy..not a fan. The tacos were just okay. It was fish sticks in a flour tortilla.. They were dying for some flavor though. I wish the table had salt and pepper. They were just okay. I was a bit disappointed. With how great the appetizer was, I had expected the entrees to wow us - I was mistaken.

Even with our 30 dollar groupon, all of the above came to 40 bucks. This was when I realized that we probably won't be back. Everything was a bit over priced. 16 bucks for the tacos and 15 for the slider...er. i mean burger (I mean they came out with ketchup packets) is a little too pricey.

If I could do it all over again, I would have come just for drinks and appetizers.

3 stars for the ambiance, service, and the appetizers.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,3,1,3,N3vbFQdN097_aDFtUKz1EQ

Excellent combination of taste, service and atmosphere. I tried the Carne Asada Steak Chimi and their spicy salsa was to die for. You must ask for it though!

The staff is extremely courteous and small details like keeping my glass full of water at all times really impressed me.

Live Music by Toto was really pleasant while we had our dinner. We were told that he is there every Tuesday for their taco Tues. What more can I say....love the colored chips, I think it was very festive and flows with the Mexican them. There house salsa was perfectly balance.",S2ygaci0w6EM0tuQU_erwQ,0,0,5,dgN17LAAnNtdsyNrX7kPKA

5583262,2013-09-22,0,PjhIQJf2dbdLxgnFrAUaNw,"This is a place I can't imagine will still be here. First, horrible location. Second it is a large seating area which is almost always nearly empty everytime I pass by or go in.  Third, even though there was only 2 other customers in the place, not a single person approached us as we stood at the front desk waiting to be seated.  15 minutes we stood there waiting for someone to even notice us.  When we finally did sit down, we were again ignored for long periods of time.  Finally left because no one took our order.  

In my humble opinion, you can't succeed with a Mexican Bar and Grill that has high prices for the same food you can get at the corner taco shop, especially in such a location with little foot traffic, poor visibility and bad customer service.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,5,1,2,VFnJuR3VQUhZvTO75opaCQ

We had read that the service could be lacking so we didn't expect four star service. We ordered a pitcher of the house special margarita's which was good but nothing special. You could do better with Jose Cuervo mix. We all enjoyed the warm tortilla chips in three colors which were very good as was the spicy salsa. The entree's were disappointing and not very appetizing in appearance. Our two friends ordered the carnitas tacos, I had the steak and chicken fajita combo and my wife had a tostada salad. The carnitas were made with cubed meat that resembled dog kibble. The fajitas were tasteless. All three came with dried out rice and crusty beans. My wife thought her salad was good but mostly cut up lettuce. The four of us shared an order of sopaipillas which were tasty. The service was pretty inattentive given that there were only three tables of guests including us. Overall the food was bland and tasteless, the service poor to fair. None of us will return nor will we be asking the recommending couple for more dining suggestions.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,2,1,2,Hc1zB169XRYIaotHwPpTOw

We came here about 10:30 last Saturday and brought my mom along. I was pleasantly surprised that they were open for breakfast. The restaurant is located in Village Square, across from the theater. They were completely empty when we entered the restaurant, but we were greeted warmly and taken to our seats. Our drink orders were taken immediately and then we perused the menu. 

Their chips and salsa were standard and so was their food. I had the carnitas tacos, my fella ordered chicken enchiladas and my mom went with the chilaquilles. The food was just ok. Nothing amazing, but it was standard Mexican fair. It didn't really stand out to me and now that I'm writing my review a week after our meal there I actually had to review the pictures I took to remind me what I ate. 

The restaurant is really pretty and there is plenty of space for bigger parties. They also have $10 all you can eat taco Tuesdays and they also seem to host quite a few sport and happy hour specials, so look out for these. All in all, this place is a nice little spot if you're in the area or have a coupon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,3,NXlgm8zhd7otBNh4npY3HA
