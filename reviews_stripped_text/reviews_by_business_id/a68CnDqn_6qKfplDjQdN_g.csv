Given where I live and how often we can eat middle eastern food as well as home cooking, Royal Persis is like my grandmothers cooking and that's hard to beat.  I hate to admit it, but its much better and I'm so grateful that such great food is available in a city with such hustle and bustle.",tXQlvkN6XccyMGZ93eJmtQ,0,0,5,NOP39b3dgzMzC5T0OwOZEA
992369,2011-08-12,0,a68CnDqn_6qKfplDjQdN_g,"Our Iranian friend bought us here to try Persian cuisine. Generally, he tends to stick to restaurants in the LA area, but found that Royal Persis delivers authentic eats.

We shared a couple dips to start. Maust' Moosier is yogurt with shallots. It was creamy, cool and savory. Kashk-E-Bademjan is loaded with bold flavors from eggplant with whey, onion and mint. Both are spread on lavash. I had Chelo Kebab Soltani, which is a combo of filet and ground beef. The husband had stew with beef, kidney beans and a bunch of seasonings called Ghormeh Sabzi. Our friend's favorite dish is the Chelo Kebab Barg which is the filet kebab. He said the secret to the side of rice was to add lots of butter. I still enjoyed it without. We finished our dinner in the traditional way by enjoying a cup of hot tea. 

I've had kebab before at various Mediteranean and Middle Eastern restaurants and none have been as tender or tasty. I loved the marinade for the Barg. I definitely recommend it.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,0,4,08cZW0A3SX_nWnKWFmwS0A

lol Carlys review is so true it is the spot to find old persian men drinking tea. 
the staff here is always at their 100%. even knowing my parents by name. (i assume they kick it here without me)
we always get the family platter which comes with beef kobideh (ground beef), beef pieces, grounded chicken kabobs as well as pieces of chicken. 

i especially love the ground beef and pieces of chicken. 

my little sissy always gets the yogurt with mint and cucumbers.
a lovely place",WvgJqOHxM0LESJrPZIoXWg,1,1,5,eCbFf3xf13ENcBKZ1xdyuQ

I ordered this to-go and was pleasantly surprised to find a WHOLE bag of pita bread for my hummus! The hummus was even better the next day. I WILL be eating here again.",QZa1yDj1vM-o94x5r3odBw,1,0,4,m-Sf2K13WqAC1wXPtyLehg
1914063,2010-02-23,0,a68CnDqn_6qKfplDjQdN_g,Really not great. Went with 3 other people and none of us really liked any of the dishes. It was like all of the dishes lacked any depth to the flavors to make them interesting. I thought a long time about just ignoring this place and not reviewing it because its independently owned and others seem to like it so much however I just wanted to put it out there what we ate was blah.,qnoXQsDOTOFwJEYXSCnHEQ,0,0,2,500vbsUcwnJToVdWnhZ7eg
1918381,2009-07-17,0,a68CnDqn_6qKfplDjQdN_g,"Pretty authentic Persian food. I got their chicken koobadeh and hubby got their beef shish kabob. The meats were moist and tender, cooked just right. I wish the rice had more flavoring, it tasted just a little bit dry.
I am not sure how this place is like during lunch hours or the weekend. We were there on a Thursday night and we were the only 2 there. 
I recommend this restaurant if you are in the mood for some Persian food while in Vegas.",2vG-d4adgfNj0s7iUUCL7A,1,1,4,5yPBq-6ghtUqYKFcc0bQlQ
2742387,2012-05-21,0,a68CnDqn_6qKfplDjQdN_g,"Descent persian food, came here on the recommendation from a Persian friend, who knows I love Paymon's, so he told me I would like this place better, do I, uh well I think they are two different tastes. For starters we shared the Maust Khiar, which is always my favorite app (yogurt cucumber dish) and the Kashk e Bademjan, which is the eggplant app that was the table favorite, it was very different and savory. We all tried something different, I went with the Chelo kebab koobideh which is the ground beef kebab, one friend had the shish kebab and the other the chicken kebab. I wasn't a huge fan of the ground beef kebab, it reminds me of sausage and I don't love sausage, I liked the shish kebab the best. The basmati rice is ok, I've had better, but if you spend an extra $2.95 you can choose a different rice, and my friend got the Adas polo which is basmati rice with raisins, lentils, dates and saffron and it was delicious. Almost like dessert. Prices were reasonable, and the dishes were large, I had enough for dinner and lunch the next day. The iced tea was so good, I drank half a pitcher. They also have what they call a full bar, but it's pretty limited, and the wine is limited to, merlot, cabernet and chardonnay. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a place to check out for sure.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,4,0,4,DZAQR1XSiMgYG2ql2xaKfw
4693269,2010-12-25,2,a68CnDqn_6qKfplDjQdN_g,"This restaurant is very basic, serving as both a restaurant and banquet hall.  On this Saturday evening a large group from Nellis Airforce base occupied 2 long banquet tables with the remaining diners scattered around the large room.   

We shared a delicious appetizer of Kashk-E-Bademjan, fried eggplant mixed with Kashk (whey) flavored with sauteed garlic and mint. We also shared an order of Shiraz, a Persian salad of fresh chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, parsley, onion and house dressing that was less satisfying.  Ann's entrée was Fesenjon, fried walnut pomegranate sauce, mixed with boiled chicken and a side of Basmati rice.  My entrée was another stew, Baghali Polo, basmati rice mixed with fresh dill and lima beans served with a cooked lamb shank in tomato sauce.  The amount of rice served was almost overwhelming.    

The owner, Amy, stopped by our table to inquire how we enjoyed our meal and ended up sitting with us for a half hour while we enjoyed complimentary orders of baklava and tea.  

I would rate this restaurant 2.5 Stars.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,3,0,2,_-s9I5okTyJGd_agJF4Iew
