88064,2007-10-08,1,3fPIRTnBhd81MixgS9YoMQ,"If you're at the Fashion Show Mall (most likely there for the Apple Store) and start to feel hunger pains, try this CPK.  You can't go wrong with almost any one of their pizza dishes and you should definitely order it with the honey wheat crust.  They have a pretty decent selection of salads so if you're lame and anti-carb, you'll still leave with a full stomach.  I'm not a particularly huge humus fan, actually I think the stuff is pretty gross, but I was forced to try their warm humus appetizer and my taste buds didn't completely hate me for it.  I don't know if I would order it on my own, but if you like humus to begin with, you'd probably totally dig theirs.  The only thing to be wary of at this CPK is other patrons.  Remember, you are in Las Vegas on the strip so you will encounter both tourists and residents.  People who live there are too cool to bother you, but some out of town tourists may interrupt an otherwise delightful meal.  For example, myself and two other girls were sitting there enjoying some conversation with our meal and a nicely dressed older Asian woman approached the table, basically standing right on top of me.  She then proceeded to stick her face about a foot from each of our dishes as though examining them, for what, I don't know.  After about a minute (which doesn't seem long but when you have no idea who the person is and you can feel them breathing on you, it's close to eternity) she proceeded to another table and did the same thing.  No words, no smile, no nod, no nothing.  So while you can expect some good food from this CPK, I can't tell you what to expect from the crazies.",bwRbJjmYU052e1KfTRjDgA,1,1,4,wVJiOWf9r4vcEk5BSd6QKg

But the reason why I truly gave this place 5 stars (and I wish I could give more than 5) was because of the employees and customer service. I ordered take out from this place ($220 worth of food) and they had forgotten one item. I called CPK after unloading everything at home and the manager picked up and was extremely sorry about the situation. I went back to CPK to get the food, and the manager gave me a gift card for the inconvenience.

We had originally planned to dine at Nordstrom Cafe (a fave) but they closed earlier than CPK, which delivered beautifully.  Nice atmosphere and OK service, although I had to stalk our server a bit for H20.  The miso salad (I do the half with shrimp, dressing on side, no crispy rice sticks) is my fave of the salads here. It's fabulous and inventive.  The $5-ish small bite appetizers aren't much of a ""deal"" because the portions are so tiny - but while I usually get scandalized when something that seems like a value isn't, I was OK in this case.

1815686,2012-08-18,0,3fPIRTnBhd81MixgS9YoMQ,"this review is for the california pizza kitchen inside the fashion show mall.  

first of all.. out of all the california pizza kitchens i've been to, this one has the worst service.  i work inside of the mall so i consider myself a regular here and bad service is something that i find on most of my visits.  when you first walk in, you'll find the chatty hostesses who will talk to their friends in front of you while you stare at them and wait for them to seat you.  most of the waiters/waitresses will take their sweet ass time to get to you and help you with what you need, especially if what you needed was a refill of your drink.  on one occasion, they charged me the wrong amount to my credit card and i had to drive back to CPK just to get it fixed.  on a second occasion, i came with friends and we paid for the bill in twenty dollar bills.. well you know how you're supposed to get change back right? the waiter took our money and DISAPPEARED.  we sat there waiting for 30 minutes for him to return and no one came around.  since it was late and the rest of the mall was closing, we just gave up and left.  even though i got compensated for it by the manager (she's a real sweetheart) when i came around a second time, i gotta warn you guys to be careful when you're paying for your meal.. whether you pay with cash or card. 

anyways, as for everything else, the restaurant is clean, the seats aren't cramped, and the portions are a little below average compared to other CPKs (i guess i expect that when i'm dining at the fashion show mall).

the food is standard and consistent.  one thing i really recommend is the garlic cream fettuccine.. like seriously its the only thing i order every time i come.  if you've never had it before, its a nice big plate of noodles with a thick white sauce that fills you up good for 10 dollars.  you can add chicken and mushrooms to it for an extra cost, but i don't.  one plate of noodles can be shared between two people for a meal that won't make you feel bloated despite the heavyness of the sauce.  the spaghetti bolognese is good too if you want something tomato-y.  theres a garlic tomato-y spaghetti that they sell that i don't recommend anyone to eat.. unless they enjoy a mouth full of garlic flavor that super minty gum can't remove. the pesto is not my favorite.  the salads here are on the ehh side. for appetizers, the fried macaroni and cheese (it has a fancier name.. but i forgot it) is delicious! but it's on the small side.  it comes with four pieces (my picture only shows two because i have a bad habit of eating my food and then remembering to take a picture) on a plate with cheesy sauce.  as for the pizzas.. i can't say anything about them.  i don't like pizza ): 

overall, the food here is just as good as any other california pizza kitchen but i'd rather go to town square or the mirage because the service would be better there.

p.s. when they ask you if you want to sit inside or outside, choose INSIDE! from my experience, the service is faster. oh and ask for free bread.  yum!

p.p.s i've recently discovered that you get more food with take out!",Iqm6Ig0NcKXkwPsT2RyRwQ,1,0,2,cJORWDpzbWqQlqzqSsCKDA

cpk, fulfills my pizza expectations as far as options.  
my absolute favorite from this joint: carne asada on pesto pizza is my number one forever.. [especially from cpk]  others: bbq chicken and the tri colore.  

there's usually a wait, but any restaurant at town square is the same.  a place located in a busy shopping mall will do that.
on a sidenote: it's not rare that we've had to go somewhere else because of a really long wait.

service has always been good at the townsquare location.. they're usually very patient and on point with recommendations and explanations of the menu which is good.   never seem frustrated with a million questions which is doubly good. 

'to go' is also a great thing.  ordering to go from CPK and enjoying your food at one of the tables provided throughout town square makes the dining and people watching experience pretty dope.

2052668,2010-12-01,1,3fPIRTnBhd81MixgS9YoMQ,"Inside the fabulous Fashion Show Mall on the corner of Spring Mountain and Las Vegas Boulevard, the CPK here keeps you safe from the outdoor wind chills and cools you down from the blazing hot summer days. One of my favorite parts about this particular one is that you get to people watch while you eat. When I was working inside the Fashion Show mall, I would order lunch ahead of time by calling it in and picking it up (fast, great service!) and some days, I would order it ahead of time and lounge on a table and people while enjoying lunch.

It's kind of redundant to place in a review for a pizza chain like CPK, but the reason why I chose to review this place was not only to share my own experiences, but to let out-of-towners know WHY they should eat at this particular one. It's like decyphering the business owner's reasons why (not counting the placement for revenue inside one of the busier malls in Las Vegas, haha!). So here's what I love to order from here:

CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD: is my favorite salad of all time and I like to order it when I got to different places. Hard to say that CPK is the best one (I make the best one :P) but it's my favorite from the menu. Sometimes the lettuce could be a bit fresher, but when it is fresh? YUM!

TUSCAN HUMMUS: deh-lish-isssss! I can eat an entire bucket of this hummus! It's soo addicting! I usually order this and a salad and I'm good to go for a few hours. This is the reason why I ventured out to try different hummuses outside of CPK!

ITALIAN PIZZA (discontinued pizza, wahh!): I remember speaking to one of the servers and they broke the heartbreaking news to me! :'( My girlfriend's sister is the one who introduced me to this one and it became my favorite! The ingredients missing from the replacement pizza (Mushroom, Pepperoni, Sausage pizza) is the peppers that lit up the pizza. If I remember correctly, they changed the sausages too! :( Major disappointment! I'm a semi-health nut so I order on the honey wheat with whole grain crust!

3 stars because it isn't super different from the others, deducted for the change of menu and average service from the staff but cool points for having ordered from the phone and never having to wait ridiculous amounts of time. Would I come back? Yeah, I'm actually thinking about it right now! NEW ITEMS ON THE MENU TOO!

The service here is on point!! I forgot what our waiter's name was now, but he was friendly, helpful, and extremely attentive to our needs. I saw him behind the bar area (or what ever that was) talking to another customer, but somehow he knew we needed refills. He brought our refills right over to us before our drinks were completely empty. I'm truly impressed with the service we received here.

I honestly wasn't impressed with the food. I live in California and I always avoided eating at this place because I had a feeling that the pizza wouldn't be that great. I was right. My pizza was on the bland side, even after adding parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. My boyfriend's pizza tasted a lot better than mine. My sister's dish, I think she ordered a sandwich or something, but her's was delicious. I'm just a bit disappointed that a pizza restaurant would have a hit or miss menu when it comes to their pizza (which they are allegedly known for).

I would give this place 3 out of 5 stars, but since the service was so great I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars. Although my pizza was a disappointment, there are other items on their menu that tasted pretty good. I wouldn't mind trying this place out again.",g8HZLiCSgWVkIMvcMHtRjA,1,1,4,0sbuB5E9Rb2Bk2eEZFrkmA

When she returned the change, I received only $19, no coins.  Although it was only
$.27 I thought it has fallen out of the folder she placed on the table.  I couldn't get her attention but did reach another server.  When I told her about the coin, her response was, ""Oh, we don't give change; we always round up.""  WHAT???? 
I said I had never heard of that before and she offered to get our waitress.  When she came over, she reiterated the same message and proceeded to tell me, ""I have worked in 7 different restaurants in Las Vegas.  They are do that.""  I told her also that I had never heard of that.  Her next comment was, ""Most Las Vegas restaurants do it and since you aren't from here, you didn't know.""
I have lived in this town for 33 years - about 10 more than she'd been born.
I am appalled at this practice.  Do you know how much extra money that rip off from patrons?  No wonder that young lady has been at 7 restaurants - she has probably ripped off a lot of people and got caught.

Their flatbreads are a good value for two people. However, I wouldn't order the fish tacos again.

The Thai chicken was okay but not nearly as good as other times I have had it, and the chicken dumplings basically were just once mass of dumpling in the container so we just ate it like a casserole, and it wasn't too good, just tasted like grocery store variety pot-stickers.

After walking around the Fashion show mall, we decided to eat at the highly acclaimed CPK. Expecting large portions, we decided to get one salad and two pizzas (""The Works"" and ""California Club"" pizzas). As we waited for order, the waiter gave us bread. I was kind of thrown off when we got out bread because the ""sauce"" was simply olive oil and pepper. It's probably nothing because I not usually a ""fancy"" person ... But oh well, it was free so I couldn't really complain. As our food came, I honestly thought that they gave us random appetizers, but no it was our pizza (it was very ... Small). The salad was better than I thought it would be, so that's a plus. Anyway, it wasn't a traditional ""Pizza Hut"" pizza, so I liked how original it was.

We decided to eat in and with this being a touristy area we did not have to wait but the dining area was busy. The smell coming from the kitchen was intoxicating and with all the pizza odors mixed up it was heavenly smelling. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so laid back and cool too.

Decided to order off the lunch menu duos a personal type size 7 inch pepperoni pizza with the super spinach plus quinoa salad. It paired so well together and the salad was awesome so was the champagne vinaigrette dressing. The salad was filled with pecans and apples so delicious with spinach too. For an appetizer I had the Mexican Street Corn until the pizza got here. It's so good. Ultimately for dessert decided to try their Butter cake and was so happy that I did.

Pear and Gorgonzola pizza ($14?) is back! They discontinued it for a little while, but like Christ, it was resurrected. One of my favorite things to eat anywhere. And that is a lofty effing statement because I eat a lot. Like your mom.

Anyways. 

CPK is just one of my favorite eateries. They have a generously delicious menu of pizzas and pastas. I know, you're like, ""What does that sentence even mean?"" I mean: not only do they have a lot of items, but they have a lot of items that are GOOD. Dare I say great, even? I always come here, and although I know the menu like the back of my freakin' hand, it takes we a while to ponder over my favorite items and pick just one. So unfair. I want all! And a pony. 

The ingredients they use are like the quintessential ingredients of early 90's California. Stuff like sun-dried tomatoes and broccolini. Like, oh my god! And like California, the menu items are an amalgam of lots of cultures. Its like totally an extended metaphor! Totally! 

My favorites, besides the impeccable afore mentioned uber pizza, are the Sun-dried tomato and Broccolini Fusilli($13), Tomato Basil Spaghettini ($13; I swear it smells like ganja), and Tuscan Hummus ($8). 

The service is normally timely and friendly. 

I always leave with leftovers. Come hungry. Don't waste your time with the over-priced beers or froo froo specialty drinks. They only take up valuable space where you can be cramming more food.

For a informal business lunch, it works just fine here. The tortilla soup has a bit of bit, and a good deal of flavor. CPK has always been a soup-place for some, and I was happy to dive in myself.  A Cobb salad, I think, is what I had next. Perfectly fine, if not terribly robust. The chunks of turkey/chicken were a presence in the salad, but really didn't stand out.

Every experience here brings in an aura of nostalgia. The food tasted exactly the same as it did back in Hong Kong around 2008, down to the very last detail. And by that, I mean the food is very flavorful and rich. Mind you, the garlic fettucine tends to get a little oily so with my mom's gallstone concerns, I had to limit the amount she was taking in or else it would cause a stomach upset (bilary cholic is what they call it if memory serves me well)

It's a good thing because the quality of the food at Sammy's has gone down, and the quality of service/food/overall dining at CPK has gone up!) I like to credit some of that to the amazing server, Casey, that always knows how to have a party! That guy always asks about our kids, how we are doing, how life is going, and how the food is tasting! 

Jamie, his boss, is the coolest gal around! Casey ran to his boss and introduced us to her, gave her the whole story how we basically stalked him, and now we run into him 2x/month. She is always so excited to see us come in, which makes each visit worth while. I absolutely love being welcomed with open arms, makes this place feel like a home away from home.

The Korean BBQ tacos were the highlight of the meal! The sweet chili sauce perfectly complemented the chunks of meat and greens. The sweet sauce would leave a little kick of spicy after every bite. 

The mushroom pizza was average. It satisfied my craving for pizza, but I was not wow-ed by it. Half way through the meal the cheese  wasn't as soft and  had a weird consistency. Half way through the meal I found myself wishing I had tried Grimaldi's next door. 

The works pizza definitely was a little bit of everything. It had so many colorful toppings that made it look very appetizing. I was not too big of a fan though, since I don't care for meat on my pizza (veggies all the way!).

They have such a fun creative array of options and toppings, like this one: 

Moroccan-spiced chicken breast with crisp Romaine lettuce, roasted butternut squash, Medjool dates, fresh avocado, toasted almonds, fresh beets, chopped egg, carrots, dried cranberries and red bell peppers. Tossed with our champagne vinaigrette. DELISH!

I typically get the Cobb these days (it's low carb) and they have one of the best Cobbs in town. The avocado is always fresh and it's always loaded with meat and cheesey goodness.

Every 6 months when we're going to Fashion Show Mall I enthusiastically exclaim, ""CPK!"" 
And I truly cannot wait to eat at you...
But then once my pizza has arrived I remember why I make no effort to get down here more than every 6 months...
Your pizza is just not that good. (I'm so sorry, I had to say it!) And I feel badly saying it, really I do....because I like your salads, small plates and appetizers. And because the service here is good! Very friendly and welcoming, no matter how big or small my group. But with a name like ""California Pizza Kitchen"" I forget to just stick with the yummy salads and appetizers and I inevitably venture off into the pizza danger zone. Probably it's my fault...
I'm sorry California Pizza Kitchen. But I'm sure to be back again in 6 months with fully renewed enthusiasm. ""CPK!"" I will shout. And we'll laugh and laugh, you and I. Until then...",WpLDTv1dx5419PDHI1VpeQ,3,2,3,2FCBtmM4D3mXkSEApKQ5HQ

I love CPK mostly, ironically, for its salads, although its pizzas are fine, but the salads are of great variety, always fresh, and always welcome. Moroccan-spiced chicken has long been a favorite. The avocado egg rolls are also a classic they do quite well. The menu here is the standard CPK the world over...but come here to put your feet up and get some VIP treatment after a long day or shopping or trekking the Strip. 

This particular CPK has a wonderful staff, in particular the assistant GM, Jamie, who went above and beyond to ensure a quality crew meal for my large party on our work break recently. We called ahead to have food ready for us since we were on a tight schedule and everything was served correctly and fresh. Jamie made fresh coffees and served our every miniscule whim and request, boxing leftovers up herself, running pitchers of water back and forth, and completely winning us over with the ""life-changing"" dessert: warm brown butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. AN ABSOLUTE MUST-ORDER!

The seating here is open to the mall (not in the food court) but comfortable and not exceedingly loud. Very clean.

Highly recommended. Thanks for a wonderful CPK experience.",bpTMsVz-mLl8-0QOcT8gpg,0,1,4,I8FAkmB92auyjDmZvdQ16Q

I split the shrimp scampi zucchini pasta with my mom and it was a perfect size to split with someone. We ordered a socialite cosmo and it took 20 minutes to receive it which was really strange because the restaurant was not busy at all. Our waitress was so so nice, so that was definitely a plus. In the future, I would probably go somewhere else to eat in the mall because there are a lot of good options that are probably better than CPK.

They also served sourdough bread with a herb oil.  They were both tasty and hard to stay away from me.  The bread was fresh.  The herb oil was tasty, spicy at times.  Yum.

What I like about CPK is that they are always consistent. I walk in knowing that I will eat good food and leave happy. Here are some of my favorites:

-The original BBQ Chicken Pizza: gotta love this classic. Always comes out hot and delicious! 
-Spinach Artichoke Dip: I have ordered this dish at many restaurants, but CPK has the best one. Its very smooth, creamy, and easy to dip!
-Garlic Cream Fettuccine with Chicken: another classic that I love. The sauce is thick and full of flavor, which is how I like my pastas!
-California Club Sandwich: I ordered this a couple of times when I lived in California and I remember it being surprisingly good. I think the herb cheese focaccia bread was very tasty.
-Avocado Club Egg Rolls: I have never tried this, but my husband loves them.

One dish you might want to stay away from is the Crispy Mac N' Cheese. We ordered it when the new small plates menu came out. It sounded interesting because they use Panko, but it was very cold and the cheese was flavorless.
