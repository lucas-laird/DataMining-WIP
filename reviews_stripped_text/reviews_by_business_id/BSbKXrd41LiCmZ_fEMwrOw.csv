My boyfriend had the 4oz Grilled Steak with steamed rice and mixed greens and I had the 4oz Grilled Chicken with brown rice and asparagus, we both enjoyed it! The guy working also was very nice and asked us how everything was, even offered some Korean BBQ sauce that came straight from Hawaii to try with our protein. Delicious. We'll definitely come back!",5MqEUHOwGuGqQtTQvCZFYA,1,1,4,-DWzUnJVNHR-bp_Lics9Fw

At first when I drove past I didn't fully understand what exactly a ""fitness cafe"" was then I saw a groupon for Fix8 and I bought it so I could test it out.

Well worth it!  Entire portioned out meal for $14! and HEALTHY, I have been looking for a place like this.

Garlic steak is a must try, I will return!",tf6856vXdErRoz6Ew7wcvQ,3,1,5,TR8UtFtO2GY8prYU8c6Ycg
