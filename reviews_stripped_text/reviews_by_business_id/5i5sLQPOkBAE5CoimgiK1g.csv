The course plays pretty tight, so you need to drive the ball fairly straight to stay out of traps, or out of the desert areas.  Mid-week traffic is not bad, but prime-time rounds can go 4.5 hours. This course needs a marshal to keep everyone moving. All staff members have been very nice and accommodating each time I have played here (maybe 10 rounds).

We went out at our 8:08 start time, although there was no starter or announcement and the other 2 that we were suppose to join us were late, so we started ourselves on time.  We paid twice what we normally would have so that was a real bummer but golfing in the winter for Midwesterners is worth the inflated price.

I pull up to the first hole in the golf cart and I was blown away. This course is very nice and the greens are in great condition. Every hole seemed to be perfect and I managed to play 18 holes without hitting a house. One of my favorite holes on the course was hole 16 I believe that to be a Par 3 where you must avoid the water. Let's just say I lost a ball or two on that hole. I would definitely play this course again very fair priced courses and friendly staff.,nOJl2Hsyhnun1o98uRUtzg,3,1,4,aI1hbgTL3gVhvXCmLztXhA

I had a 10:38 tee time , at 10:50 I went into the clubhouse and asked the starter how long the delay was going to be , he asked my name and than told me that we were the next group [ I was polite ]. I waited right outside the clubhouse for my name to be called as I was done warming up . No names were called for 22 minutes as I waited and watched 2 more groups go to the tee box , I went into the clubhouse and asked the same young man why we were not called as promised and that 2 groups had went ahead of us since he had told me we were next up. He proceeded to tell me that he had called us to the tee and we did not show up, I explained to him that for the last 22 minutes that I sat in the cart in front of the clubhouse under the speaker and that he did not call anybody during that time. He lied right to my face, I asked for the GM's card and in an arrogant tone told me the GM Ed was right at the end of the counter , I spoke to Ed and told him what happened and that I didn't appreciate being lied to and I was an long time OB card holder and Ed's response was in a sarcastic tone "" Do you want a refund on your cards?"",There was no attempt to explain what had happened or to remedy the situation, just basically telling my friends and I that if you don't like it, Don't come back, like he was doing us a favor letting us play on his golf course. When we spoke to him we were perturbed and upset but there was no yelling or profanity . when we left it became obvious that the 2 groups ahead of us were Ed's buddies and he was probably responsible for the whole situation otherwise the young man at the desk never would have spoken to us in the tone that he used in front of the boss and that his boss never would have allowed it if he wasn't the reason for this situation.

When we got our cart the cooler was literally hanging off. The starter told us to leave it at a hole when it falls off. Ok back to the game. We went back to the starter about 10-15 minutes before our start time and he told us to go see the kid handling the carts because he was taking over. As the starter continued to socialize with his buddies. Then he jumped back in and started sending golfers out. We asked a 2sum what time their tee time was and it was 15 minutes after us, yet the starter (not the kid) was going to send them before us. That was until we challenged him. That's when we got our dilapidated cart with dangling cooler and then he paired us with another couple. Off we go to hole #1. 3 groups backed up. Perhaps the starter should be at hole #1 to see the pace. It took us 5+ hours that day. Course conditions were awful. Greens were bumpy. The ball bounced it's way to the hole.

I expected this golf club to be out north of Las Vegas, near the Piute Counrty club - in the desert.
Even the pictures on their website are a bit deceiving.

It is a nice course, a bit narrow at times, but there are touches of the desert to be found on most every hole.
It is one of the shorter courses in Las Vegas.
It is gentle on the scorecard for the higher handicap players.
..... unless you hit the ball into the houses bordering the course.....
It is also a bit gentle on the wallet ... they have some good rates for afternoon tee times.
There is water on most of the par threes, making them scenic as well as challenging.

3830716,2010-10-19,1,5i5sLQPOkBAE5CoimgiK1g,"Another Golf Course tucked away in a neighborhood.....this one is located in the Northwest off of Ann Rd & US 95 North.  I enjoy coming here during the Summer months and can usually get on the course easily mid-week.  On the weekends it tends to get crowded because their green fees are lower than most courses in town.  Here's my breakdown of the course:

PROS
- Nice practice facility.  Mats & Grass options, which are nice.

- It's a nice course for a mid to high level handicap player (15+)....because it's a short course (see CONS).

- There are a few challenging holes, (#14, 292 yds, par 4) has water on the right side of the fairway and is a slight dogleg right....if you hit the ball long enough, you could cut the water and come close to driving the hole.

CONS
- Short course.  6,781 yds from the tips, 6,269 from the black tees, ladies tees are at 5,647.

- No lights on the practice facility and the range is pretty small.....can get crowded when it's busy.

- The greens are slow.  They're not too challenging.

I've been coming to this golf course for over 17 yrs, since I moved here in '93.....it's like an old friend.  It's a great course to sharpen up your wedge play and 3 wood (off the tee instead of driver).  Or if you're a beginner, it's pretty forgiving.

Either people who like those teams really buy their bags from this pro shop or somebody got stuck with a bad order. The Steelers? Go Cowboys! :)

On to the course oh did I mention a cart came with this price I felt like I was robbing the place. Tee off was about 10 min early no complaints and at the end of the 1st hole I shot a +1 hey for a duffer like me I was happy now we won't talk about the rest of my game.

The course is very nice and can't be beat for this price. Wide open fairways although I seemed to somehow find the edges. Every up and down was pretty straight forward and no real major dog legs to speak of or challenging traps/hazards. Short course well maintained and fun for beginners and intermediate players...i.e. most of the general golfing public. 

I was a little disappointed with the slow pace of play we ran into people ahead of us a few times and kinda slowed us down. Not a huge problem for me as my golf rhythm is so erratic it doesn't effect my game. Why I should question if you should even call what I do game LOL.

I also dislike the conditions of the arroyos, which seems to lack any landscaping thought behind them and many patches look like your everyday vacant lot in Clark County. I hope OB Sports will put some effort to improving the visual appeal of these areas.

On the positive side, this clubhouse serves some of the best hot dogs in town. Comes with all of the condiments and fixings. I highly recommend it.

While its shorter than many golf courses, tight fairways, difficult bunkers and lightning fast greens make it challenging nonetheless.  Painted Desert is a classic ""target golf"" type course.

Course management is at a premium.  If you just like to rare back and whale away for distance, you'll find yourself in trouble more often than not.  Many times a considerably shorter drive will place you in a better position to make the green in regulation.

Oh, those greens.  Fast, fast, FAST.  On top of that they undulate in unexpected ways.  On some holes (notably the 7th) an unforgiving pin placement and a ""too long"" putt will find your ball in the water hazard.  (P.S. Try not to hit the ""coot herd"" on the 7th in the winter)

The major problem with all but one time I played here, probably 8-10 now, is there's no pace of play maintained.  Groups waaaaay to slow, way beyond what's acceptable for anyone who remotely knows golf etiquette.  Marshals would be great, too bad really cuz I won't return, don't have 5-6 hrs to play as a single.",67Acv1c_14-eA7uaBtjYag,0,0,2,RdXK0zr2M8YoA-5j_rQFLA

For the greens fee here...it's a great value and at the top of my list. Joe Q is the man as he made my experience excellent. He pays attention to detail and shows he cares about people. With his above average people skills, I expect he will be managing this course by the next time I come back. Thanks Joe Q!",seh7s25xeKGs4ky3gGhKvA,0,0,5,ZLoFHr0zemTIJSSdM8vLiA
