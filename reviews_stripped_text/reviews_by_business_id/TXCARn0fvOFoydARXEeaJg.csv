They are also very hospitable, they make you feel very welcome and go a little beyond the 'how are you' which goes miles for customers.  They genuinely want your business. All round a great place to grab a snack or coffee.  Not a large selection but what they have is done well.  Going to be a go to from now on.",TeyksePTlA2SXr8XYf_2IA,2,1,5,WIwYNhK-UuvN1KbcoA-P0w

1999525,2015-11-13,10,TXCARn0fvOFoydARXEeaJg,"Located at the new Pawn Plaza, this coffee and donut spot is TINY! Required city signage on the wall states the maximum occupancy is THREE. Grab and go or at least take your goods outside to the provided seating. Don't forget your wallet on the counter, which will probably be empty after the prices here...

Shop offers a case of fresh-made donuts in traditional flavors (sprinkle, chocolate cake, glazed), seasonal options and specialties (such as an Elvis-themed chocolate-PB-banana option, maple-bacon bars, cronuts), as well as ""holey moley!"" donut holes, and apple fritters- the latter of which seems to be a hit, seeing as how the three men ahead of me in line ordered them in quick succession, rendering me unable to sample them myself.

Opted for a cronut, which had great texture, though unevenly-applied glaze flaked off like dandruff all over the table rather than inside each bite. I did enjoy the light sweetness. Sprinkled donut ($1.50) was very average, did not seem the freshest despite my 10AM arrival, less than 3 hours after opening. There were two flavors of donut holes available (5/$3): the chocolate was dry and flat sans any glaze (arguably the best part!), but the red velvet was nicely glazed and seemed the freshest of my sampled items, though light on the chocolate flavors.

Service was friendly- my soy latte was made quickly and correctly, and they had no problem accommodating my last-minute check-in offer (2 free donut holes). Don't forget to redeem yours!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,11,3,inFOZogShvB1ihLHEERueQ

2970914,2016-01-26,14,TXCARn0fvOFoydARXEeaJg,"The best part about this place is the two free donut holes you get with a Yelp check-in. 

You'll find all the basics here, glazed, sprinkled and cake doughnuts along with a few more ""modern"" flavors, a Crouxnut, PB&J Donut, Matcha donut, plus a smattering of other unique flavors. The shop is very small with the only seating available outside on the communal patio area. The coffee option here is ""Illy"" brand, which isn't anything really spectacular, but good enough for donut dunking.

I sampled the PB&J, the S'more, and a Crouxnut. The PB&J was like a trip back down memory lane, full of recess and lunchtime memories. This donut is comically loaded with jelly, with every bite literally squirting out jelly in every which way. It was like the Peter North of jelly donuts. 

The S'more was my favorite. Great chocolate flavor, a nice roasted marshmallow crunch on top and filled with an east coast favorite, Marshmallow Fluff. This donut is pretty big and worth it to share.

The Crouxnut, was good, but nothing like an actual, ""Cronut"" which make sense, because the original recipe and name has since been trademarked. This deep fried dream was more like a flaky cinnamon roll, than a ""Cronut"". That being said it was still pretty good. 

Pawn Donut and Coffee is good, but not great. I would have to pass four other solid donuts shops before I even arrived to the front of door of this place. It's just not worth the trip for me. 


The next time I'm here will most likely be when nana is in town and she wants a, ""unique Vegas experience"".",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,23,21,3,HU5xyC37ANnNeF66rDCW4g
3003965,2016-01-25,1,TXCARn0fvOFoydARXEeaJg,"I was tricked into going to PDC by photos featured on Eater.  I say tricked because when we arrived, none of the playful, creative donuts are featured there.  Yes, there was a cronut knockoff (long live Chef Dominique Ansel!), a smores donut, a PBJ donut. But there was only one dount that appealed to children - a panda shaped donut made with Oreo's.  

The donuts were decent, if a bit pricey, but if you are not the only person in line you should expect to wait a while.  Service is slow... sloth paced.  I don't know exactly why it takes so long to place a pre-made donut into a paper bag, but apparently it is a long process.  I have been known to wait a long time for a good donut (Gourdough's in Austin comes to mind), but these donuts are not made to order.  And if you want a coffee, prepare to get a seat outside while you wait.  As a bonus, while you are sitting outside you can soak in all the great BBQ smells coming from Rick's BBQ joint located right next door.

The coffee shop is part of the Pawn Stars shopping center/container park located in the parking lot of the pawn shop, and this makes parking a challenge.  ON busy days you might want to park somewhere nearby and take a short walk to the mall.",NZ_MNakh_nK6zmxNmYg5Gw,4,0,2,PwjGgbcG4b5NT-e2jz10Aw

I have a donut, doughnut, deep fried anything problem, and I found the donuts here solid. We ordered the crouxnut (croissant and donut) and maple bar.  We used that pretty sweet check in offer to get some donut holes.  The crouxnut was my favorite-flaky, rich dough, sweet and just nice to sink your teeth into.  Definitely would have been better warmed, damn, forgot to ask for a microwave- d'oh! 

I only sampled the maple bar, and I didn't feel like there was enough maple- see the aforementioned donut problem.  Solid donut again.

I didn't really like the donut holes.  Not enough chocolate.  I wish they had their regular donut in the donut holes.

Hungry AF after a night shift, I was scarfing this green glazed donut on my drive home. It honestly did not hit the spot. Sad to say that I was not impressed. With plenty of sweet matcha treats around town, this one had the least matcha flavor, if any. I actually ordered two of these just in case I loved it. My husband tried it at home without any clue what it was. His commentary, ""what is this supposed to taste like?"" Maybe I got a bad batch, but I am definitely in no rush to try it again.

The panda face one with oreo cookies, I assumed was a cookies and cream flavor. The oreos on top for the eyes was the extent of the cookies and cream flavor. The cream inside the donut was just cream. Just a sweet, but boring donut.  I feel that the cream inside should have some crushed oreos mixed in.

The Samoa, like the Girl Scouts cookie is loaded with chocolate, coconut, and caramel. Very rich, but not too sweet.

The apple fritter was okay. No complaints.

Honorable mentions: donut holes are pretty good and FREE (with Yelp check in). Selected red velvet and chocolate. 

For the amount that I paid, I wasn't too satisfied.  It's a tiny spot in the Pawn Plaza, that you can enjoy your donuts and coffee in the outdoor seating area or taken to go.

Holey Moley! Donut Holes (Red Velvet and Classic)

Located in the recently opened Pawn Plaza, a sort-off ""Container Park"" concept on South Las Vegas Boulevard near to the Shop that spawned the Show that launched the musical (that bombed) and countless other concepts comprising the Brand, it was midday Friday that a stop was made at Pawn Donut and Coffee, and with friendly attendants offering contests and coupons in the free lot a quick perusal of other eateries showed a number of familiar faces, a familiarity that actually spills over to both the fried carbohydrates and coffee roasted by Illy.

Admitting a bit of predilection to the pastry our country has always defined as a breakfast treat but only  recently rediscovered as something worthy of more artistry and attention to detail, it does not take more than a quick perusal of the PD&C website to realize the work is eerily similar to Pink Box or Donut Mania, the later actually producing the goods at owner Ralph Cautela's request as he feels their donuts are the best in The Valley.

Not particularly wowed by my lone visit to Donut Mania, the pastries themselves good enough but off-put by the owner accosting me at the door for simply snapping an exterior photo before explaining himself and telling his story, suffice it to say that options are a bit more limited at the Pawn Plaza outlet while the nod definitely goes their way for smiling service and outdoor seating, though certainly not for  pricing.

Acknowledging the address + fame-based up-sell, though still not thrilled to spend nearly $15 for six selections ranging from $1.50 Classics to $3 for 5 Donut Holes and a $2.50 Special, it was with each item bagged individually that way was made to the patio for indulgence, first bites of the cake-style red velvet a bit light in cocoa while the white version tasted like a top-tier old fashioned with great texture to the dough.

Onward to the brioche style of yeasted donuts made popular at Pink Box, though supposedly developed by Wayne at Donut Mania, a Raised and Glazed ring next proved pillowy and delicious while the layers of lamination beneath a sugary lacquer placed the much improved alt-named hybrid on par with ACE on Tropicana or Press at The Four Seasons amongst the best textured in the country.

Unfortunately finding the seasonal filled donut to be far too much cream cheese and not enough spice or pumpkin puree, it was in two more successful selections that the not-so-modest snack concluded, the fritter well constructed with lots of apples and crispy edges in the soft-centered East Coast style while The King somehow managed to balance what must have been nearly a quarter cup of peanut butter with bruleed banana and plenty of crispy bacon stuck to a dark chocolate layer on top.

***Having now visited every independent doughnuttery in Las Vegas and Henderson, the results ranging from dreadful KD's to world class ACE, Pawn Donut and Coffee is a good choice for tourists and those who happen to be in the area, though locals would be better served to experience the goods from their South Durango source where each is freshy made and a quarter or two cheaper, as well.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,16,11,3,PihJMvPN6QPSpV32szyENQ

5664206,2016-05-06,1,TXCARn0fvOFoydARXEeaJg,They contract with a chain to make their donuts.  Nothing special or fresh here!  Not worth the calories or trouble to get parked.,aFy5BCN-ZOggf8UASTZUkA,1,0,1,0br0KPvuYMZcwlPSqsEI5g

The peanut butter and jelly donut was the best out of what we got which included lemon Bavarian cream and maple bacon plus some donut holes. Bacon maple was probably my second choice, and it wasn't anything to rave about. Coffee was the worst out of everything. At least the servers were kind.",hbu71EEk4rlccQQuAWERNw,0,0,3,i63WK_UANixiil4VP-a-BQ
5906208,2015-10-25,2,TXCARn0fvOFoydARXEeaJg,The staff was very friendly and the prices were very reasonable considering everything here in Vegas is stupid expensive (native Houstonian here). Donuts are good too. I have nothing else to say but eat here.,jiRDk51y6Y2-KutMRilnXA,3,2,5,j1gZaAZP8MD9Bo3NYARZtQ
5930870,2016-04-10,0,TXCARn0fvOFoydARXEeaJg,Just went to this donut shop. So delicious! My husband and I travel a lot and this was one of our favorite donut shops. The Samoa was ridiculously amazing. The Cronut was my favorite. So buttery and delicious. The girl working there was so friendly and sweet.,6UnvuN6mglxBszrx8IuU_A,0,0,5,DQZz2i0QShVu4b7NNT3V_A
5933867,2016-02-04,1,TXCARn0fvOFoydARXEeaJg,Walked in and walked back out. Lame excuse for a doughnut shop - there wasn't any selection at all and we came early morning. What kind of a doughnut shop doesn't have chocolate doughnuts??!,bvPS4vrfiO7ZZ4KAo8KBTw,1,0,1,He_3S69P7pkv6bkPRCVysg
