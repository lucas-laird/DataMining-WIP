It's only been open for a few months so it was a little slower, but it was a better experience than most of the other bars we stopped in.",92_SmCt-ZUO--fTuMpwaIg,1,0,5,1Id-mTRwh5Obpq_HuXpY8Q

We enjoyed our lunch so much that we returned for dinner. And as for the staff I cannot say enough wonderful things. They were friendly and knowledgeable - refilling our drinks, explaining dishes and clearing plates. We will definitely be back again!",uLp3IeDMnTLWZhip3wKFHQ,3,0,5,VmHvhLRpq6zQpKfDGm59bg
1244582,2015-07-27,1,Gk_KLfwb0GMgKDrP8_0kqg,"Extremely small portions, overpriced food, mediocre flavors. Beers were horribly overpriced despite having a good selection. I got a ceasar salad with steak on top. The steak was way overcooked and they did not ask me how I wanted it cooked. It was also about 4 bites of meat which they're charging a big up charge for. The salad was tiny considering it was meant to be a meal,  about the size of a side salad. The dressing was pretty bland. My friend had the pork sliders which were also underwhelming and small portions.

 Would not recommend.",Ol44aMLv0s3EY9hkIW1EYw,3,1,2,0sH_EDQrZgjoz_BXfi6wjQ

It started out well because we were greeted by a host right away and directed to great seats with a great view. Another server brought menus and said ""your server will be over in a a few minutes""- no problem, we could wait. After a few minutes  another host came over and said "" you should probably just go to the bar and get your drinks, its going to be a long wait..."". Seriously? We picked our stuff up and moved on because there only a million other places we could go and not be asked to serve ourselves.

2970765,2015-07-31,8,Gk_KLfwb0GMgKDrP8_0kqg,"I walked-in and wanted to hate this place, but it wasn't really that bad. 

I was searching for a hot and new spot via the Yelp app and the People's Republic came up. This place is located next to the Harley Davidson Cafe and Chili's. I know, I know, how many red flags must I ignore before the ultimate demise of my palate.

During my search I noticed a check-in offer for a free soft pretzel with the purchase of 20oz Porterhouse steak, really? I'm going to buy a thirty-two dollar steak in hopes of getting a soft pretzel, c'mon guys! Here's the kicker they don't even offer the 20oz anymore, now it's a 16oz Porterhouse. 

The style of this place is a tad confusing, it looks like sports bar, but with stained glass windows and a lot of brick, it could maybe pass for an English pub? My server (Jason) came by and was very personable and fast. He took our orders promptly and even gave us some recommendations and info about the menu.  Still nothing on the menu really intrigued me except for the loco moco balls. I also ordered deep fried artichoke and a breakfast pizza. 

The Loco Moco balls were interesting. Hand shaped rice balls with spam inside instead of hamburger meat, then deep-fried and served with a side of gravy. These were probably the best the thing of the night and that's not saying much. Way too much rice and hardly any spam inside, plus the side of gravy was clearly from a packet. 

The Fried artichoke was ok, but the dipping sauce that it came with completely overpowered any artichoke flavor. 

The Breakfast Pizza... Oh, the Breakfast Pizza. It was processed cubed ham, bagged cheese and sauce from a can, all on flat bread with a fried egg. Guys, when you have people scrutinizing every bite of every meal now-a-days it would really behoove you to not cut corners and get real products on the menu.

This place could be good, but the food fell so flat that Wile E. Coyote even winced. The service was on point and the view from the patio was great, just not great enough to save my experience.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,12,6,2,eDyo9vGajPE-sAbhRxmftw

3652042,2015-09-05,0,Gk_KLfwb0GMgKDrP8_0kqg,"We were craving a snack and cocktail and drawn to People's  Republic because of outdoor seating.  It was a little windy, but refreshing.  We ordered appetizers:  fried calamari , which were cold, soggy, and a measly serving size; fried artichoke hearts, which were good, wings, 8 in the order for $13.99 (just under $2 per one wing joint), and delicious cheesy puffs.  The drinks were average.  Ordered a Moscow Mule, but no mint.  Asked for water refill, which came 15 minutes later. All the servers looked busy but didn't feel the service for the $100 we spent on 4 appetizers  and 4 drinks.",LyS23gEHkhmOaBYSahNQSw,0,0,2,rMo-5uus2gmHDHEdSw08bg
4070703,2015-09-13,0,Gk_KLfwb0GMgKDrP8_0kqg,"Very disappointed. We got here about 10 minutes before they opened. We waited outside on the deck  and a server still approached us and initiated conversation so my immediate hopes were high. We sat down when they were officially open, and it took about 10 minutes to be greeted. 10 MINUTES! There was nobody in here! Had to wait another 10 to get water. I'm not sure if the staff was having an off day, or had no sense of customer service. We ordered the pretzel appetizer. It came out in good time. Unfortunately there were 4 of us and our server didn't bring us plates, so we had to stare at the pretzel until she came over. The pretzel was delicious so that's the only reason this place gets one star. 3 of us received our entrees, the 4th had to wait another 10 minutes. If you want good service i suggest not coming here.",nlR_4CDEzHcuXfqF8rKpLA,1,0,1,bcfPKhFkm7O7oM1hqGzqcA
4082905,2015-07-15,0,Gk_KLfwb0GMgKDrP8_0kqg,"This is my new spot for lunch. Right on the Las Vegas strip. Big space, fast service, a diverse menu of quality eats at a affordable price. 
I started with  the cheesy puffs, two orders of lollipop  wings, salt and pepper and buffalo.  Buffalo wings were my favorite of all the appetizers. The cheesy puffs were like a mozzarella cheesy puff fried then rolled in hot Cheeto crumbs. 
 
The beer menu is legit too. They have a huge selection. I tried the innis and gunn rare oak. Def one of the best beers I have had. The hazelnut beer I tried was really good too kinda like a Nutella beer.",WZANPBUlzpieAtygw67mZg,4,1,5,f4nWtThVC2w6gMw2LGRgBg
4261531,2015-08-15,1,Gk_KLfwb0GMgKDrP8_0kqg,"The two best things about this place were the view (see the picture I posted) and the customer service. My honey and I rarely venture to the Strip especially to eat, bit we happened to be in the area and decided to give it a try. The ambience is nice with big open windows that give great ventilation. The actual restaurant was really clean as well!!

Let's start with their confusing check in offer, which is more like a false advertisement. It claims to offer a free 16oz. beer with your check in, but its really a free 16oz. beer with the purchase of a gigantic steak and a check in. Lame. As expected, the beer prices were the standard high. 

The food was pretty basic bar food. In my opinion the appetizers were more appealing than the entrees. We ended up ordering several different apps. The Loco Moco could use more spam, I didn't really taste it. The
Artichoke hearts were yummy; I especially enjoyed the lemoney sauce. We also tried the breakfast flatbread which unfortunately wasn't as sun shiny as it was described. The 
flatbread didn't evoke breakfast at all. It was more of a meat lovers' pizza.",cglyQq_IWXEuAFKXYhNXgg,6,2,3,seEt5Huqq71sN1NsDevsWw

The server, Brandon, was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and quick. He gave us great recommendations and never left us wanting. 

The food was delicious. Started with the pepperoni flat bread which was perfectly cooked with a nice crust. Perfect appetizer or light meal. The cod tacos were fresh and cooked just right. You can just tell that the fish they used for the tacos was top notch. It was tender, flavorful and not overcooked like most restaurants do. I also had a taste of my husband's classic burger with cheese. Yum! I'm not a burger fan at all but I was tempted to devour his burger. I usually don't order burgers because the meat is either tough or flavorless. This was not the case at People's Republic. Good quality meat and great flavor!  

I can't wait to go back and try out the other items they have on their menu. I have my eye on their ribeye but figured a ribeye would be a bit much for lunch. No worries, I'll be back real soon! Good food, good service? How can I resist?!",BpJWttiu9h5cgxtVkQZGXw,1,2,5,Jst90a961RxuvJDRlRtErA

Check in process was a bit confusing - multiple entrances, but confusing where to go to be seated.  Seemed to be a common issue for many I watched walk in.

Had a traditional Moscow Mule which was good.  They offer several varieties adding various flavors for those who are more adventurous.

Pulled pork flatbread was just ok.  Not much pulled pork and a lot of sweet (maybe a bit too sweet) BBQ sauce.  Calamari was also just ok - nothing exceptional.",PElSghzFMxkzdr0AAkSwRQ,1,0,3,8P8W7riE5YraS_xiwX9-3g
