The counter staff is super friendly, greeting you when you walk in and leave. The pizza variety is awesome, esp cheeseburger and this deep dish ranch sauce pepperoni :d there is also a streusel Pizza akin to cake and pudding that is just divine.
They have a jukebox, a tv that always has on icarly, and a small arcade for kids.
Will definitely be back for more because I love variety!",q5afJ8gTV5TPEOkzyeJ_WQ,0,0,4,RtkMqBJhdrBWW0iF4QXzCw

Asked for a veg pizza and it was at our table a few minutes later. Our table was always clean also.,8O6YdO7ZntA8nQhlUDubsw,0,0,5,pzg-LjyeCKMQmyrEmqvByg

3306204,2012-02-02,18,v2UKNMDqWN1UaWlK2Ugx2Q,"So, don't hate me but I love Cici's Pizza.  Period.  Now, let me say upfront that I grew up on East Coast pizza.  All styles and all quality.  I also have to say, pizza would be my last meal on earth (probably).  With that said, some people might turn their nose down at Cici's.  But not me.  I love the crust, the cheese isn't gooey and the toppings work.  We're talking buffet here folks, so gluttony is the word of the day.  Well, okay, you don't have to fill yourself to the rim, but you can enjoy good pizza, salad, bread sticks and more, for less than some cups of coffee.  And I don't feel bloated when I'm finished like some pizza can do.

This Cici's location is nice.  Large space inside and it seats a bunch.  Have a large party for kids?  This is the place to go.  The staff is friendly, as you should find at all locations.  This staff seemed extra attentive.  Don't see the pizza you had in mind on the buffet line?  Ask and they will have one for you quicker than you'd expect.  Tell them the number of slices you'd like or just ask for the whole thing.  The tables were clean.  They do a good job of cleaning up used plates and such, as you use them.  So, yeah, that's about it.",EZmocAborM6z66rTzeZxzQ,20,19,4,zfc6cGKmEfSpVGvQh0k73w

It doesn't busy here, so you don't have to worry about waiting for a table.",_imBnfuXo7eNYphhR2GT5Q,0,0,3,VfE6IBMLJfvBxrz7xPzZ6A

My first experience here a year ago at a different location was not good at all. I seen a 3.99$ price and was sad since they closed down the Pizza Hut Buffet by my house so opted for this place. 

When you first walk in theyre very nice with their standard ""Welcome to Cici's!!"" welcome. Our cashier was very friendly and we paid. For drinks its 1.89$ for a small and 2.29$ for a large, childrens drinks are .99$. We got a seat and proceeded to the buffet, Im not a fan of pre-made salads and here they offer only 2 choices, a blt ranch, and some Italian one. I opted for the blt. I went on to get breadsticks and was excited when I seen the deep dish and macaroni pizza. I sat down to try all my yummies. The salad was meh and the macaroni pizza was ok. The deep dish was def yum, and I was surprised I liked it bc it had white sauce on it.

They also special make slices for you! I get the deep dish with pepperoni and jalapeno, super yummy!!

Come here for cheap eats and pizza! Right now the buffet is only 3.99$ which is a killer deal for pizza!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,0,0,4,l_SFlQNEOCoZnRttvy7ydA

Their brownies and cinnamon rolls are FANTASTIC though.  

I'd go back.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,0,0,3,1uCybP3NoDqe2r9CDDejmQ
5129733,2012-09-16,1,v2UKNMDqWN1UaWlK2Ugx2Q,"Ok so this may be partly my fault...I had never been to a Cici's Pizza before and had expected a lot more out of the experience. 

The only thing I thought was good was the cinnamon roll things. Everything else was not great...or not available. There was no salad or pasta available the entire time we were eating (we were there for about 25 minutes).

I guess you get what you pay for here. It's cheap.",bKhfZoTppbT2cnnP38wiUw,0,0,2,PHC_nmchK2QJyncew94Nbg
