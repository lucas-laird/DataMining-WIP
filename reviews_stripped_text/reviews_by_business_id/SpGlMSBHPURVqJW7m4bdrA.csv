448909,2017-01-24,0,SpGlMSBHPURVqJW7m4bdrA,Hands Down I Loved This Place I Went Last Night For My Birthday Amazing Staff!! Well Coordinated And They Pleased Me Well. Workers Were Professional But Yet Chill! Excellent Service I Will Definitely Come Again And Tell Friends About This Place! New Spot To Smoke Hookah And Drink. 15$ Per Person All You Can Smoke.,EuJCgFM3NpST77yGTczvLQ,2,0,5,WLAAlH95Cbli4h2JcCjtWQ

The place is on Charleston in between Decatur and Jones so it's basically in the center of everything. Now Karma has had two other locations before. I went to their centennial one often for a while until they didn't make enough to keep it open. Service was always great here. Flavors we're pretty decent as well. Good coals. Okay hookah. Now, I understand that you have to make your money back from what you've put into the business, but ripping people off is going to get no one to come in. 

My friend and I brought in our own shisha because we like a shisha brand that they don't carry. Yet they're still charging us $15 per person for that? I'm not smoking because that's just ridiculous and STUPID. This owner obviously doesn't appreciate his customers. $5, understandable. But to not discount anything at all for just using the hookah. Really? We're paying $15 to use our own things? We even brought our own bowl and lotus for the hookah. A knock off Khalil Mamoon with a cheap $2 hose isn't worth $15. At all. And yes I know for a fact that these are only $2 because I see them in gas stations and some smoke shops for $2. This is a slap in the face. No wonder there's not a person here besides us!!!! That's why you're not making money. Because you're selfish. Good luck losing your business.",Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,10,7,1,vUoCIEaY96JlJeRto--kEw

They also have beer pong tables which we really enjoyed! Customer service was some of the best service I've ever came across. One of the managers I believe his name was Dave or David came over to check on us and told us about all the unique hookahs they have available. This place is definitely one of a kind that I recommend to everyone who wants a chill hookah spot. They are also a restaurant, we didn't try the food but it is probably really good as well. They have specials going on so call and ask!",0aGzxl0e1uxj_qrb82Hhtw,1,0,5,UPI4GHx0_UwGWwoQiMDkrw
3973465,2016-12-04,2,SpGlMSBHPURVqJW7m4bdrA,"Man, I tried and tried to like this place! It's one of the few hookah LOUNGES that serve alcohol. I'm a huge fan of hookah and have been to a lot of different hookah lounges here and in Los Angeles. I own several hookahs and would like to believe I know a thing or two about hookah haha. 

-1 star for music:
Man, I know they're just playing a playlist, but do they not know what TOP 50 is?? They go from playing Latin music to Eminem to early 2000s hip hop. -____- You can't attract a crowd if you're playing whack music. I can't comprehend if you have a liquor license, play the right music, keep people dancing and having fun, keep making money. Set the tone! 

-1 star for lack of product:
I've been here three times and every time I've been here, I've always been told ""we're all out of that flavor"" for different flavors. Take it off the menu if you're out of it! Keep your inventory stocked! Smh. 

-1 star for product quality:
I taste soap. I don't taste flavor. My smoke isn't thick. I asked for a ""pinch of mint"" and every single time it tasted like they did an equal amount of mint. Unless they have Shaquille O'Neal back there with his big hands doing their ""pinch"". 

-1 star for service:
We waited 15minutes for our table to get cleared, 30minutes for our hookah, and another 40minutes for a bowl change. They told me that they were really backed up and busy. But when I went to the bathroom, there were 2 guys and 1 girl sitting in the back room just smoking hookah and sitting on the counter. But, there's 1 waiter who is amazing, I forget his name but he's a tall, skinny guy with a little man bun. That kid is A-1. But the hostess is condescending and clearly everyone else who works there is busy. 

The owner seemed like a really cool guy, this place seems like it has a lot of potential. I'll probably go back in a couple of months once they work out their kinks....",e9nlgxYgKrhE4VkwOo0LyQ,4,2,1,YXEfACN6A_0KvU6o5UQNfw

5756106,2016-11-05,0,SpGlMSBHPURVqJW7m4bdrA,This place is super awesome! Everyone is very very helpful. Our waiter Kahlil is amazing! He is super attentive and totes adorbs. Absolutely recommend sitting in his section. The food was great. #getthecheesecake. Hookah experience was amazing. Music wasn't too loud so we can still carry on a conversation. Will come back for sure.,KR97iklBCxutx4vaufoj0Q,0,0,5,TgUbTyl1l_C_pEnlyot9VA
