Not cheapie take-out chains, not little specialty places, and not restaurants that need you to be tipsy before you taste. We've had very good sit-down meals in CA, AZ, UT and CO, but NV has let us down pretty consistently over the past ten years.

El Mescal lives up, though. We'll be back again and again.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,2,1,5,ku3hYUm6lhrdssVHtXYOPQ

They spoke in Spanish most of the time, and then clarified in English right after). Paublo, the owner, made sure you were happy with the salsa and chips. I could not get enough of the marinated cabbage, it was so tasty! Full service bar but I had a coke, a real Mexican coke! They also had Pepsi products too. My husband had the pork shank in the sweet mole sauce, which wasn't candy sweet... but delicate and smokey. It was so good I was dipping chips in it before I added more cabbage on my chips! The tortillas were in a warmer with a hinge lid, which I think is fantastic because I always forget to put the lid back on and they get cold or gummy (fresh corn or flour tortillas). The rice and beans are really good, plates came out hot (we were warned! I just like hot food to be hot). I had shrimp fajitas, with whole mushrooms, onions and green peppers. It has the most amazing glaze type sauce. Nothing was too spicy, everything was really quality and they make you feel like family. Less then 40 bucks for an amazing dinner. I regret not having the fried ice cream, make sure you clear a good 2 hours because the portions are huge and the dessert is beautiful.",XHcdiEfj9ovgTtnvmdgnvw,1,1,5,Z9K5O_iqdltvjgNIXGAuog

We gone there a few times and try to try something new. But some items like I mentioned before are not so traditional. 
Wait staff very very nice always try to see how they can make the experience better.

As far as the food, started with cheese dip and it tasted like white Velveeta.  Poured my salsa in to break up the richness.  

Ordered the jalape√±o margarita which was good (fresh lime flavor and strong).

The chicken suiza enchiladas were the main course.   Everything tasted fine, but all elements were on the bland side: beans, rice and suiza sauce.  The sauce could have definitely been more vibrant!  It all tasted homemade, but a bump of salt would have went a long way.

I asked the girl if they had chimichangas she said yes and said they are a good size so in my mind it will take almost the whole plate because that's what I'm use to at other Mexican restaurants when it came it looked like a frozen burrito from the store that they heated up. The prices for the food they serve you is not worth paying full price for. Plus side of this place is they are family owned and the family is very nice.

I went back to retrieve it they promptly had it for us waiting,  for great food and the honesty of the staff I say we'll done :)",MDfOe56Bb67TXSBE8cm6lA,2,0,5,IrP-M8klQakXVlYvOJcK1w

The shredded beef burrito tasted exactly like the salsa, which did not work.  Should have stuck to traditional seasonings.

Rice and beans were tasteful, but so was the guacamole. 

Staff is friendly and prompt in attention, but we were the only ones eating.

I had the combo plate - tamale was excellent, sopita was okay.  Didn't love the base, but the picadillo was top notch.  My soft chile relleno (egg battered, very traditional) was awesome!

My husband, who is from the northeast, cleaned his plate of cheese enchilada and ground beef/cheese tacos.

The best part of the meal was the house margaritas.  Large, strong, and great flavor.  $9.99 for 32 oz.  would come back for this alone.

3560994,2016-10-29,0,p-w6g8cuQq5PU_4U1XNCzQ,"Really great restaurant, but it's a little on the pricey side.  We initially came for happy hour (which is only on beers and margaritas), so we ended up ordering regular entrees as suppose to discounted dishes we thought would be available.  Not much wrong with that, as the margaritas were on point, but I'm just saying that it had the potential to become a nice post-work outing type of place.

As you sit, you're served chips and salsa - the good kind!  Chips were warm and definitely done in-house.  With the salsa, the combo is addicting.  For our lunch/dinner, we ordered some of my favorites; chicken mole and ceviche tostadas.  The plates were large and really yummy!  It kind of reminded me of places in Old Town San Diego. The tostadas had an extremely generous portion of shrimp.. it was so fresh! 

While I was more than full and satisfied from this order, I would recommend to go during their lunch special (until 3pm).  Most things on that menu are about $10.  The mole is there, but I didn't see the ceviche. The restaurant itself is nicely sized inside AND outside.  Looks like it could be great for large parties.  Also, the staff/family who runs it do a good job welcoming you here.  If I had the authority to claim this place authentic, I would.

TBH, I'm conflicted because it's delicious food in a place ran with love by a caring family, but then the price hits and it's not that the food isn't worth it, but it's just not fitting.  I feel like a family-friendly restaurant like this should be a bit more affordable.  With it's price point, I would claim this as an occasion type place, but it's really more of a frequent go-to spot.  The $$$ and lack of a happy hour food menu are my only concerns with this restaurant.",T1ECVGXE_vwCoCOY5s4esg,1,3,4,lri2vaNN5PiV2iSd7yCvJg
3604736,2016-06-09,0,p-w6g8cuQq5PU_4U1XNCzQ,"My search for good Mexican food in Las Vegas continues. I wanted to like this place. Reviews seemed good, pictures looked nice, love finding hole in the wall places... But unfortunately I was disappointed. 

The service was pretty good. Waitress wasn't overly friendly and though she didn't check on us often, her fellow waitstaff did check up on us every once in a while to make sure we were okay. The restaurant was really empty on a Monday night at 6:30pm. Besides the birthday party they had of approximately 20 people they had maybe 3 other tables including us. 

The food was not my favorite. I'm from San Antonio and know good Mexican food. I was raised on Authentic homemade Mexican food so yes, my standards are a little high. When I saw menudo on the menu I was super excited and a fellow yelper's photo of the menudo looked to die for. So I asked if they had it on a weekday and to my surprise they did (for those of you that don't know, menudo is usually served on weekends. Kind of a brunch thing). I thought $13 for a bowl of menudo was pretty pricey but I just had to give it a try. Well, maybe I was too excited because when I tried it my smile went to a frown. First off it didn't look right and looked nothing like my fellow yelper's picture. The broth was thin and brown. Usually when menudo is cooked right the broth has a nice thick, orange-reddish color. That's when you know the flavor is there. The flavor was lacking in their menudo, I tried adding the onions, cilantro, seasoning, hot peppers and lime to the soup to get it to where I wanted it but nothing helped. I ended up eating a couple spoonfuls before deciding to just push it aside. $13 down the drain... I decided to try my man's chicken poblano. That too was nothing spectacular and for about $15 a plate, I'd expect better. The chicken was a super thin cut of meat. The rice was okay though, it had good flavor and was moist. But honestly for an average of $15 a plate and not even being on the strip, I'd expect phenomenal food. Oh and when they brought out salad they brought packets of ranch and blue cheese dressing to the table. They didn't even ask what kind of dressing he wanted for his salad and besides packet dressing at a restaurant that charges $15 or more for a dinner plate? That's questionable. 

Yeah we had a groupon for $20 but our bill still came out to a total of $44 plus a $7 tip for 2 people. That's kind of pricey in my book for the quality of food we received.

I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were good. However, my friend's shrimp was delicious.

This is a family owned and run place. Dad is your host, Mom usually takes your order, and their daughters try and anticipate your needs for refreshment and other services that make dinning enjoyable.

The food is almost ""authenitic Mexican"". It's a little bit Gringo, and I attribute that to the area. They don't want to scare off the Gringos in the area, and orient themselves to Mexican Beers and a Margarita, that they try and talk you into ordering. After all, there lies the profit in this business. 

I did find the food good, and I have visited it some six times. I finally had to give them up. Not because of the food or the service. It is certainly better than Pancho's, Macyos, or any of the other Gringo oriented chains, but it is very pricey. 

I find for the price of a decent house special burrito, I can go to other places and get a higher quality meal. If you can stick to the Daily Lunch specials priced around $8, and fill up on the chips, this is a good find. 

I wish the family well and hope they succeed. I just wish they would bring their prices more in line with other Gringo Oriented Mexican places, so I could afford to take others there, not simply eat alone, and look like a loser who just got dumped by his girlfriend.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,4,2,3,2KGqYTJXvX4xPI_RO6PgBA

Ordered the house margarita which I was pleasently surprised has hand juice lime/lemon, because I saw and heard the bartender, who was also a server that night.  it was tasty and huge!

They serve chips and a ""pace"" salsa, which was still tasty and pickled cabbage which we weren't really fans.

Kids shared the 3 taco plate with rice and beans, and the hubby and I shared the Molcajete.  Both were delicious. 

The mocajete is a big bowl of carne asada strips, grilled chicken strips, a thin pork chop, 2 fried pieces of tilapia fish and a few pieces of grilled shrimp plus at the very bottom of the bowl was some very tasty chorizo and white cheese with green chile strips.  Each of us got a plate of rice and beans and a side of tortillas.  The meat was tender and very flavorful, you could tell they marinated it and grilled the meats.

We were so full and so satisfied, definetely worth the drive.",4W-ZU-E82HWWUNNk9tfN6g,0,0,5,bsctWuzwh15u0fN-0ADOTA

We both asked for extra sauce because we loved it so much. The service was good but the host and waitress did really should interest. I was the waitress go to the table in front of us and the gentleman sitting down complained because his plate was extremely hot and he was very polite about it, even said a joke or 2 and tried to engage in conversation but the waitress just seemed disinterested.

An hour before closing we were almost the only customers there, and five minutes later, we were just that.  Our waiter, Pablo, was friendly and attentive, but a little bit absent-minded.  

My margarita was filled almost to overflowing, and that one drink was enough to keep me worried on the drive home.  Granted, I have a very limited capacity for alcohol, but this one was a heavy hitter.  Maybe it's just me, vertically-challenged as I am.  

We both ordered chicken:  Pollo Asado for me and Carnitas de Pollo for Herb.  We also ordered a dinner salad to share, but that never arrived.  I was afraid that the very thin slices of chicken in my dish would render them tough and dry, but they were moist and obviously well-marinated.  Very tasty.  I didn't try Herb's Carnitas, but he said they were good.  But the guacamole that was supposed to be added to both dishes was one lonely teaspoonful on mine, and completely absent on his.  The waiter obligingly brought us a small dish of the stuff, and it was quite unlike any other guacamole we've ever had:  some light-colored binder was holding the avocado together.  It wasn't mayo.  It wasn't sour cream.  It was unidentifiable (and I didn't ask).  It did nothing to enhance the very bland avocado creation I normally adore.

Normally I leave a Mexican joint with enough food to have a second meal.  Not in this case.  I cried uncle at the very last small piece of chicken.  It wasn't enough for a carry-out box, but luckily the Herb I'm married to often has the surname Hoover, so he sucked it up.

Was it good?  Yes.  Was it great? No.  Enough said.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,10,5,3,hd_bu6N40Aod5VNanKOt3A

My boo and I were quickly seated at a booth and told our waiter would be right with us. Soon enough our waiter came to take our drink order and ask if we had any questions. He also brought out some heaven in a bowl aka salsa which was to die for. He was very friendly and welcoming during the whole meal and even helped us with our questions we had on using a groupon.

We initially didn't order any drinks but after seeing how everyone else raved about the margaritas I had to try one. I was certainly not disappointed. I had he mango marg which was super fresh and delicious. My boo had the 1800 which he said was great too.

For food we shared the fajitas for two. I thought it was very good but felt there could have been more meat than peppers. I did enjoy that we each got our own tortillas, rice and beans though.

Appetizer: Carne asada cassadilla, generous portion of meet (beef tips) with barely any cheese, flavorless & very dry..

Fajita for 2, steak and chicken (very small portion)
Steak was (very low quality) overly  marinated with odd flavors and vinegar, couldn't eat it.
Chicken was dry and overcooked. 
A lot of bell peppers and some burnt onions. 
Came with rice (dry and flavorless) ,beans (ok), sour cream, guacamole and lettuce.
