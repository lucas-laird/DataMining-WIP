I've been to the bar twice and both times Donna Jo was working the bar. She's nice enough but her service is poor. First time I was there the bar was busy. I get it. I sat there with an empty drink for awhile but she had plenty of other customers so she gets a pass. Still gave a decent tip because I won.

I come in again during happy hour. The bar is practically empty, only 3 other patrons. Again I'm sitting there with empty drinks. Ok so she's busy, nope, she is sitting there smoking a cigarette. We finally walked over to her and asked for another round. Apparently, if you're not a regular, you don't matter.

I am giving this place 2 stars because the food is yummy. If only the service was great it would get 5 stars.",EGyviJZEdsmYfcQdA9oKEQ,0,0,2,z_0-XzWcX4rSMNf-mTXDOA

Obviously you're not going to get a steakhouse quality but for $6, it was not bad at all. Potatoes are not dry. Service is also pretty good. Attentive and quick. Went here around 11AM and the place was empty so it was pretty nice not having to deal with a lot of people. I also like how I didn't have the hassle the waiter for hot sauces as they were already available on each table. The only thing that was a bit bothersome to me was that the whole establishment smelled like cigarettes but I suppose that's understandable since it is a pub.

2217141,2012-08-20,0,b48IZPvY6MQO8MXK3uCNCQ,"I dont live too far from The Village Pub.  It's nestled in between a 24-hour taco shop and a storage facility.  It promises video poker jackpots and a friendly atmosphere.  Needless to say it's not overly inviting from the outside - but proximity as well as the opinions of fellow Yelpers finally convinced me to try out this nearby restaurant.

As with most local bars, you can choose to go into a restaurant portion or the bar portion of the building.  The restaurant is smoke free, and although this location is relatively new, the restaurant interior suggests otherwise.  Everything is clean and in good condition - it just looks much older.

We went for dinner on Saturday night and there were only a few other patrons seated inside.  There was no hostess stand or any sign directing us to seat ourselves.  The waitress walked by where we were standing, even said hello, but never told us to seat ourselves.  Not a big deal, just a weird interaction.

Having read the reviews on Yelp I knew what kind of menu to expect.  I knew I wanted a burger and I knew DC was going to get the fish and chips.  We also decided on a pint of EI beer and the sweet potato tots.  The waitress was very pleased with our tots selection and really started raving about them.  When they came out, they were served with plastic tub of syrup - our waitress said the syrup took the tots to a whole different level.

She was right.  Seriously.  sweet potato tots may hold the key to world peace.  They were hot and sweet and savory all at the same time.  They had the right amount of crunch and were not greasy at all.  These would be great for breakfast, great for kids as a side dish, and definitely great at 3am after having a couple beers at the bar next door.  

DC loved his fish and chips.  Three giant pieces of cod that were seriously fresh.  DC marveled at how good it was, and he was disappointed that he was served more food than he could comfortably fit into his belly.

I ordered the Southwest burger, which was topped with sauteed onions and jalapenos, cheese, and guacamole (also chipotle mayo, but I opted out).  This burger was massive, hot, and delicious.  Mine was cooked a little more well done than I asked for, but I'm not overly picky about that.  The burger had serious spice from the jalapenos, but it was fantastic.

Overall, the food was far better than the exterior of the building suggests.  The price was ridiculously low for what we got.  Our waitress was very friendly, even though a little awkward at times.  

I can't speak to the rest of the Village Pub locations and the quality of their food, but if you're ever down in this part of the Valley, stop in and get some exceptional food at a fantastic price.",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,1,0,4,llCrzs3VKrdHsKRQxWDHVQ
2290014,2013-03-25,0,b48IZPvY6MQO8MXK3uCNCQ,"I love coming here for their breakfast. Their menus won't show it, but they offer ""Steak & Eggs"" which consists of two eggs, steak, choice of toast, and potatoes, all for $6.99. Your wallet and stomach will be happy, trust.

Pros:
- Steak & Eggs*. Great value for your money.
- Video poker machines at the bar.

Cons:
- Ambiance can be a bit depressing in the breakfast hours. I don't know about their lunch and dinner hours though.
- A few miles away from the Las Vegas strip.

I went on a weeknight with a girlfriend and the place was empty aside from a few people at the bar.  I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy (my favorite breakfast food) because I would like to know where I could satisfy the craving close to home and it was HELLA cheap.  

Although it was cheap, I just couldn't stomach it.  It had a weird flavor and weird texture.  I really enjoy a thick and creamy gravy with a TON of sausage (there was barely any sausage in the gravy, but that's a norm for most restaurants- I'm not giving 3 stars for that) and this gravy certainly is thick and creamy, so I was excited when it arrived at the table.  I cannot describe the flavor, it just wasn't like any sausage gravy I've ever eaten (restaurant or at home) and it was a little gritty- almost like there was too much flour or something?

I also ordered the Root Beer (whatever is on the menu- I have no idea about it's name), which was pretty delicious!

Service is pretty friendly and quick (except the waitress seemed a little annoyed that we took so long to decide what we wanted to order...).  My only real problem with this place is the smoke.  When you walk in, you practically walk into an ashtray.  The stench of stale cigarettes is strong, even when there aren't any smokers.  Is this a ventilation issue or just life in Las Vegas?",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,0,0,3,CY8SfblUKkp3H9YGyegAXw

The food here is great - MUCH better than you'd expect from a pub.  It's always plated very nicely, with garnishes and finishing touches that you wouldn't expect at this price.

This place is famous for their fish and chips, and with good reason.  Three HUGE pieces of fish with a mound of fries that's easily big enough to share.

They always seem to have a couple of steak specials in addition to their daily specials.  I've never had a bad steak (or even a mediocre one) here - always tender and juicy, and cooked just perfectly!  On our last visit, my husband tried the Pub Pot Pie - a hulking puff pastry covered crock of chicken-y goodness and vegetables.  It was absolutely amazing.  According to their website, they're introducing new menu items at this location, but the regular menu is still fabulous.

This is the kind of place where you'll get to know your server over the course of the meal and probably the folks next to your table as well.  The food is better and the prices lower than other pubs in this area and the atmosphere is more like a restaurant than a bar.  The service is always attentive and friendly, and I doubt that will change much once the word gets out and this location gets busier.

So i kept telling myself i would go check it out. So last night we decided to go out to dinner and a drink and I figured what better way to do it than going to the village pub. 

As soon as you walk in there is a restaurant type dining area to the right and the bar seating to your left. We walked in at about 6:50 and happy hour apparently ends at 7:00 but the bar tender gave us all happy hour prices on our drinks which is $2 beer and $2 well drinks as well as $2 off all appetizers, which is a sweet deal when the most expensive app is like $6. We tried the stuffed potato wedges which are delicious, my wife ordered the Fish and Chips and I ordered the Pub burger...

As for the fish and chips..... "" WOW""  absolutely amazing. Definitely not the type of fish and chips you expect in the middle of the desert. 
The Burger was also Very Very good, cooked exactly how I asked and it was very tasty.  This is now a go to place, we had 2 drinks an appetizer and 2 meals for $26 and won $25 on the keno machine at the bar so in all reality we payed $1 for an amazing meal.

We had no idea until we sat down that whoever owns Ellis Island, seems to own the Village Pub chain as well.  The food was fairly similar, except without the 6.99 steak special of course.  They do have their own specials such as ribs, fish and chips, etc.  The best part was they served the wonderful Ellis Island Beer, for just 3 bucks.  While not as cheap as getting it from Ellis Island, it was a hell of a lot closer to drive to.  Not to mention, it was a lot colder.  We came here on a seriously hot day, and I ordered the Hefeweisen with lemon.  Not only was the beer severely cold, but the glasses were too.  It really hit the spot on such a humid day.

For food, we tried the hot wings, which were big, and very hot and crispy.  They served them fresh out of the fryer.  Not the best tasting I have ever had but prepared very well.  I had the fish and chips platter.  Again, not the best I have had compared to fish and chips in Seattle, but for Vegas they were delicious.  The fries could have been better but for the cheap 8.99 price, I honestly didn't care.  My husband got the chicken parmesan pannini.  This sandwich had one of the biggest, thickest chicken breast I have ever seen served in a restaurant.  Very heavy but delicious.  

We ended up having lots of leftovers, and the waitress was so cool that she gave me fresh tartar sauce and lemon to go with my fish to go, and malt vinegar.  She was so good that we ended up tipping her over the 18% the restaurants usually add for usually a restaurant.com certificate.

This meal only cost us $18 for the two of us, which included beer with the certificate, making it an incredible bargain.  While not a beacon of gastronomy, for the price it was pretty damn incredible and deserves 5 stars.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,2,5,XjvPY6RNzml_fpW7qLQA9w
