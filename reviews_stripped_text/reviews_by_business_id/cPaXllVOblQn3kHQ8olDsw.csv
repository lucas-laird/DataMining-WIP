I heard of them because they sent me a flyer of their lunch specials which is only $5.95, from 11am to 5pm. It includes an egg roll and drink if you stay to eat there however they were nice enough to give us both the egg roll when it was take-out, they didn't have to. Coming in there, it was empty, this lady immediately greeted us and we told her we would be taking out and she gave us a menu. Idk if they had the heater on but it was so cold inside, just as cold as outside. My bf and I both opted for the chicken pad sew lunch special. When giving the lady the order, she had a hard time understanding us and vice-versa. It was really hard to tell her I didn't want onions in my food but within 3 minutes she understood. This was the only bad part but her great service and food made up for it definitely.  The food came out in less than 10 minutes. The lady had labeled which one had onion and which one didn't, and she gave us egg rolls which we weren't expecting. The portions where a good size enough to fill me and my bf up for only $5.95! I didn't even finish it all of it, i almost did but I was so full. And OMG it was delicious! I was impressed and we both thought it tasted better than other pad sew and for the price I am so happy we discovered this place. It is about 10 minutes away from my house but it is so worth it, I would recommend it to anyone, and we will definitely be back.",fu2hoswfjPQ6wV-YP-p_tA,1,0,5,DAEcYdAKGLU3lDz8WZtEdw

Every time i order on grub hub , they always make it a point to read the instructions on when i ask to make the dishes as "" AUTHENTIC "" as possible down to the last detail . I notice that whenever they exceed the hour mark of delivery it's because it's during rush hour when people order late night and for dinner . HOWEVER the food ALWAYS comes fresh. Never once have i had an order that tasted like i was sitting there for a day or two . This is my go to , most authentic and fresh food in Vegas. Reminds me of my parents / grandparents cooking from back home in San Diego .


If you order  make sure you try the Sai Our , and the Thai style chicken and papaya salad . Ask for it to be made authentic . Egg rolls are always fresh . And their Thai tea is PERFECT .

1527055,2016-12-27,4,cPaXllVOblQn3kHQ8olDsw,"This place is fairly hard to find. It is next to Rent A Wheel.

For the hour we were there, we were the only customers in the building. We were the dinner crowd I think. The ambiance inside has the feeling they do 99% take-out, although there is ample seating.

This place seems to be a comedy of errors. Tons of errors and typos on the menu.

Tried to order the Combo Fried Rice - was in the picture - and they said they never heard of such a thing and do not sell it. 

We had the flyer and showed to them the ""All you can eat"". They never heard of that either.

Ordered the Tom Ka Gai. It had all the required ingredients. I would rate it a solid B.

Pineapple fried rice - I am not a yellow curry fan. With that being said we ate our fair share of it.

My wife liked the cucumber salad (after it was taken back to fix after the hair in it).

She also ordered the Thai broccoli. It did not say chinese broccoli, but not complaining.

The whole experience felt as though I had an Asian mother cooking for me. Maybe not a chef, but Mom was feeding me a decent meal. Was the food authentic Thai? I am guessing the owner is from Thailand. Was it tasty? Passable. 

I would not say I hated the experience. It was quite funny how the restaurants' mannerisms are, and I think everyone should experience this. I would not actively seek going here again on purpose.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,6,2,2,uPV9sBI13a7YaWltsIQxdA

I cannot believe how disgusting this was. The crab rangoon was:  
(a) not cooked properly, terribly undercooked
(b) *literally* the greasiest food I have ever, no joke, EVER had in my entire life--I held up one of them and it drip drip dripped!
(c) fried in oil that was absolutely grotesque tasting
(d) filled with ""stuff"" beyond description---in a really bad way--like cottage cheese with fishy tasting slimy fake fish.  

The fried wontons were also absurdly oily, and only a tiny tidbit of chicken filling inside, which was was dryer than a day in June, and more tasteless than a tramp stamp.

The Tom Kha Gai soup was that only in name. I don't know what it was in reality. Some kind of coconut sludge chock to the brim with -again- grotesquely fried tofu. What the heck?

4046847,2014-11-17,1,cPaXllVOblQn3kHQ8olDsw,"I was handed a flier a week back at my other job. It stated ""all you can eat wings"" lunch $6.95 11 am - 3 pm and dinner $8.95 3pm - 9 pm dine in only. Both included steam rice, salad & soup. It also didn't state an expiration date!

We came from the I95 from the Stratosphere since we couldn't criss Las Vegas Blvd due to the marathon.  Passed it since we were expecting their lit up sign but luckily my partner has really good eye sight. Their signage was a 4 foot banner. 

Place looked closed but the sign was flashing ""open"". Once we stepped in, the older Thai gentleman approached and greeted us. He also turned on a set of lights.  Not a very busy place. Now we know why! 

My partner and I ordered two Thai teas with boba! Came back with no boba, gentleman did mention there wasn't any more boba when he served us the drink. Now I'm a firm believer,  if you have items on the menu, you need to have a steady supply in the establishment. It was in a tall glass, too bad it was too sweet!

I ordered a combination shrimp & chicken pad Thai,  no onions, since my partner is allergic. Flavor and portion size were just right for the price. It's creamier than most pad Thai I've ever had though.

Soyp or salad never made it to the table. Then the chicken wings came. I ordered a sweet chili sauce and my partner a spicy sweet basil. A heat level of seven. Chicken wings were dry. I had to double dip mine in the sauce just to swallow the meat jerky. My partners wings were flavoured perfectly but still on the dry side.  You get 7 wing sections tossed in the sauce (sweet chili, drunken chili, sweet basil) and a cup of rice. Thr flier I was given had garlic pepper as another sauce that I didn't see on the store menu. Ten minutes go by, sat for another 3, and finally the older gentleman came and handed our check!  What? So I asked if we can get another order, thinking it was all you can eat! Boy was I shocked when they said that flier expired. So I pretty much paid $9.95 for 7 wings and a cup of rice? It was $7.95 on the store menu but you add $2 more for tofu or chicken and $3 more for shrimp. Who does that? So if I'd pay $7.95, what would we have served, a cup of rice, the sauce on top of shredded cabbage? If I would have known I'd just went to hamburger hut! I do live in North Vegas so it wouldn't have been any inconvenience. I would have got 10 wings for $8.99 and half a to go container full of fries, soaked in sauce & juicy. Guess that's why I get for trying to support local businesses!  Never trust a restaurant with no customers!  If it weren't for the older Thai gentleman I'd gave this place 1 star!

Someone mentioned the shrimp in the pad Thai was a ""jumbo"" size, let's not fool anyone else, it's only a 31/40 peeled, deveined & tail on. ""Jumbo"" would be considered as the langostine size and it would have cost more than $15 for the dish, not $7.95! Just saying!

We found this place on seamless and I can say this was the worst Thai food we've ever had.

Big mistake. We ordered 3 shrimp Pad Thai plates and couldn't get past 2 bites. The shrimp tasted like it was microwaved, the food was cold, the noodles were hard and they only gave us 2 soy sauce packets. We contacted the owner and he refused to gives us any type of refund or compensation. Our total was $56 according to the restaurant yet my bank statement says I was charged $68.

The delivery was much quicker than the quoted time And when I left delivery instructions they followed them exactly... that doesn't always happen...

I ordered pad Thai and pad see ew.. One with shrimp and the other was combo... This is the first combo that had more than two pieces of shrimp and this is the biggest shrimp I had ever seen in a Thai dish..

This is the best pad Thai I have ever tasted... And it used to be my go to until I moved to pad see ew... because the pad Thai was so good I might be moving back when I order from here...

Also ordered was chicken Tom Yum noodle soup and although it sometimes comes in the white looking coloring because of the coconut... This came and we originally thought it might've been a mistake when you tasted it taste exactly as you expected to... A lot of ingredients and very good...


One order was at an eight of 10 spiciness and it delivered as I expected... The five out of 10 was in line as well... If you like spicy you're going to get it with this place...
