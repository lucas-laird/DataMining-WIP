1169768,2017-12-31,1,orjSfu6Gcv2SQlXVsXdVBg,"I have been counting down the days until this new Mexican restaurant opened in my 'hood. As soon as I read that it opened, I made the trip in. 

The service is really great. The staff have been well-trained. They're kind and incredibly fast. My food for 4 was ready within 6 minutes. 

The salsa bar is perfect. There is a smoky option, a citrus-focused option, and a spicy option. I really enjoyed the spicy green salsa. 

As for the food, it was decent. I can't say I was blown away. The quesadilla needed a lot more cheese, and the carne asada needed seasoning. I would eat it again, but it would not be my first choice. Same with the carne asada fries. 

This could be a really great place if they make a few tweaks.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,3,3,3,PQIbwUM2qu5tB-EdE6yOCQ

This place reminds me of Roberto's. . .not a bad experience just not enough wow! I was expecting more spice and seasonings, hence the name Habanernos. Slightly disappointed, maybe you have to request spicy items. However,  I will say, as a bonus; an order of fries is enough for at least 3 people!

I ordered a breakfast burrito and asked to add avocado. They charged me for it but only gave me a thin slice of avocado. The breakfast burrito itself was put together pretty lazily, but more importantly tasted awful.",TlOd51CmoA55DIf6HLUkJA,0,0,1,7TiML_ZFExezKQBa-xEOQg

1848005,2018-02-19,0,orjSfu6Gcv2SQlXVsXdVBg,"I'm not sure if I'm eating at the same place as the rest of these yelp reviews, because the food sucks.

People are friendly enough but the quality of the food is less than desirable. 

This is my second time trying them out after a long awaited opening. My first order was for a Carnitas Torta. The carnitas has zero seasoning and the bread base was literally soaked in liquid (I'm assuming juice from the meat) and soggy falling apart. How you can even call that a Torta is beyond me.

My second visit today the food was just as terrible. Ordered the Chili Rellenos/Cheese Enchilada combo plate. The breading on the CR was spongy and had a slight bite to it, the chili and cheese inside were molten hot, like this was not a freshly made item but something that had been cooked up a day ago and popped in the microwave. Then you get the enchilada which was a plain corn tortilla stuffed with un-melted cheddar cheese. This was all drenched in what tasted like a canned red sauce, topped with cheese and lettuce (which wilted from the heat of the food). 

I was so looking forward to a qsr mexican restaurant in the area, but I was disappointed to get something with such horrible food quality.

After these two experiences I'd rather go to Taco Bell before I'd venture back here.",gHPondOlRoeerorwe51M3w,0,0,1,hZeGQnFcl5W8yVRMAhq-Dw

2854484,2017-12-28,2,orjSfu6Gcv2SQlXVsXdVBg,"Greatly appreciate the courtesy and light hearted attitude of the cashier. Dealing with a new menu is not easy as a customer. Patience is definitely needed, along with suggestions from someone familiar (ie. the cashier). Colorful and very pictorial field menus make selection of lunch (breakfast options too) options easy. No guessing is needed, unlike some restaurants in the city where the names are not recognizable. Leaving you wishing the whole time if you could ask Alexa ""what does this mean""? Selected the green chicken chili fries, but only because the cashier sold me on the juices from the green chicken chili sealing into the fries. Her recommendation was valid, and on the fries where there wasn't a mountain of cheese, sour cream, onions, cilantro, and green chicken chili, the juices helped to prevent a mouth full of dry potatoes. The menu and food combinations is so plentiful, I can see spending multiple lunch ones here within the next couple months and never have the same thing twice.",YzXQQX0Fb3YfFEQ22tQh8g,4,2,5,ZGUFH_oeeh-A4iATV3MK5Q

Ordered a Las Vegas burrito.  It is your standard ""California burrito"" at most other locations.  The burrito was good, pretty much what I expected.  A big burrito filled with meat, fries, cheese, and pico.  Prices are reasonable and portions are filling.  You get good value for your money.  Only complaint was it took a while to get our food.  The lunch rush is pretty brutal and the kitchen isn't really able to handle a lunch rush.

They had ground beef taco's for $1.00 Perfect!  I was going to just get 1 but I decided to get 2.  So while I was waiting for my order, I went over to the salsa bar.  I don't care for the carrots they have, they seem to be soggy, or not raw and marinated.  I like mine raw and marinated.  The Jalapeno's were ok, but......after I put that hot salsa on my taco, (Yes I choose the hot one) Jalapeno's weren't needed!  These taco's were so good!  The meat was seasoned to perfection.  I pushed the other 2 sauces to the side!  But let me tell ya'll!  My mouth was burning for the next 20 min.  It was hot while I was eating it, but once I was done, it seemed like it was getting hotter! and hotter!  I was whistling inward to try and cool off my mouth!  I was drinking ice cold water to try and cool down my mouth!  Even though it was that hot, it was really good!  I would choose that sauce again.",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,1,3,5,5UdB5eJ22rL0qozNYUM6HQ

The space is very similar to the previous tenant, so I'm not sure what took them so long. The interior is spacious with plenty of seating.

After a quick scan of their large menu, I went with the Green Chile Fries, which I guess I enjoyed since I ate the whole damn thing. I look forward to trying more of their menu in the coming weeks. Hopefully they stick around for a while.

EDIT: Quick update having visited a couple of times now. My rating should really be a 3. The food is decent. Nothing spectacular, but quick and friendly service and still a convenient work lunch option.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,6,8,3,6R8H630B6-v_hMYwfAYvww

This happened a bunch of times until someone finally put something between the glass and door so the glass wouldn't eventually end up in a million pieces. My friend and I ordered separately. My chile relleno and taco plate took a while, but her breakfast burrito came at least 15 minutes after mine. My taco was pretty greasy, but tasted okay. My chile relleno was still cold inside where the cheese was still a solid slice. The beans and the rice on the side was good. The salsa bar had fresh radishes which I love, but the pickled carrot/jalapeno mixture used cooked carrots which were no longer crunchy. Maybe because it was busy, the place was not cleaned up and people left messes on the tables that no one cleaned. When exiting, they only use one of the doors so now you get to manuever between the line and the glass wall trying to get out where people are coming in for the mad dash at lunch.
