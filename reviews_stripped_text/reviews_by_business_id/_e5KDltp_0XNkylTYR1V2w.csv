But now that they have new owners and have remodeled the place and changed up the menu a little, I can honestly say I am actually looking forward to going back.  They have added two big screen televisions.  They now have wooden bench style tables and they play hip hop music.  When we arrived a couple of the waiters were dancing and one even danced us on in to our table (he was feeling it).  I ordered the roasted hen with a side of egg noodles the noodles had a sweet brown sauce on them with a kick to it, and a small bowl of soup.  To my surprise it was rather tasty the roasted hen was seasoned perfectly and crispy but the inside was not dry.  My kids shared the roasted hen and tomato rice place and enjoyed it as well.  My other daughter got steamed rice and beef and broccoli, that was enough to feed two people easy.  My husband got steamed rice with pork and egg loaf.  It was all good.  I also had, well my kids actually had the three bean drink, so good.  Next time I will make sure to order two.",JNBCCsPLEwiyR13xbIviIQ,1,1,4,Oa7c7-P9Eny8HA2AeYNHWQ

This place has been renovated and I do like the new decor and look of the place. It feels much cleaner. 

I usually get the combination pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, or the pork chop rice dish. The last time I was here I got the oxtail pho. While the broth was perfect, I wished they had added more oxtail. I was really hungry!

Order was taken and got asked by 2 others if I was ready to order so apparebtly no table assignment can make things confusing.

Ordered combo pho... no meat balls wtf, dissapointing.

$10.95, also very pricey for no meat balls.

Broth was ok but it wasnt hot enough to wilt the veggies. A big thumbs down for any Vietnamese restaurant.

Did not get any service after getting my food. I had to walk up to the counter to pay.

It's a little further down on Spring Mountain, but not too far, and definitely worth the extra minutes. My son had their pho, I had the bun bu hue, hubby had the pork chop. Pho was good, but not the best he's had. Bun bu hue had good flavor and was hearty. Pork chops were ok and a tad bit small. The nam neuang was the best thing we ate.

They took a bit longer to bring out the bun bo hue.

I tell the waitress I don't want the soup any more since the whole point of that soup is for the pork blood and hat they should have let me know before they made it that they were out of pork blood, and she said it's here now and they put extra ham and to eat it or take it to go.

Sure they remodeled and everything looks a bit more modernized but upon sitting down and looking at their new menu, It was immediately disheartening to see not only did they jack their prices up, they decided to go the Ala Carte route with some of the Vietnamese dishes which is so ridiculous especially with rice dishes that used to cost $9.95 are now up to $14.95. 

Our waiter told us they fired all the old staff/cooks/servers and are starting on a fresh new leaf. If this is what they call a fresh start count me out, especially when there are such good and reasonably priced Vietnamese restaurants literally around the corner like Pho 90 and Kim Long.

Love the fish sauce. The Gua Cuon, aka non-fried shrimp spring roll was good, too. Fast, efficient service. Definitely a keeper in our local book. Hence my review and Yelp bookmark! Highly recommend and we're coming back soon!
(One criticism to owners- pls fix the women's bathroom stalls. Very awkwardly configured. My knees touched the stall door and there's room behind the toilet to move it back. Or even perhaps move the stall door out more. After eating, no one wants a bathroom door that close to her face and knees. Lol)",5jaDl2BkXScojOkl1qQ9ww,1,0,4,yzEdZNYRBpTfuzXktyTjZQ

4352257,2018-03-19,3,_e5KDltp_0XNkylTYR1V2w,"I went here when I first moved to Vegas when it was under its old management and it was good in its own right. It's now changed mostly in terms of menu items, and it's still very good. 

We got the beef with woven rice noodles, raw beef salad, egg rolls, charbroiled pork, salted lemonade, salted plum drink, and che ba mau.

The beef with grilled nicely with some char markings and you wrap it in the lettuce, pickled carrots/daikon radishes, mint, and woven rice noodles. The flavor was on point, a little salty from the meat but you get a nice freshness from all the veggies. They have the hot water and spring wraps in a little unit which makes it so much easier to hydrate it. 

The egg rolls were pretty standard but had a nice crunch to it. It kind of reminds me of when my mom used to fry it up at home. You know, **~*nostalgia~*~*


The raw beef salad was probably my favorite thing we got there. It's fresh, vibrant, and you get this subtle acidity from the lime. All in all, a very solid dish and it's a plus because this dish is so hard to find in Vegas. Most places do your typical viet pho, rice, noodle soups, etc, but the new changes to the menu try to give more variety than your usual pho joint. It's trying to introduce you to more Vietnamese food that you may not know about, and for that, I'm so glad. As someone who was raised on Vietnamese food but sucks at cooking it, I'm thankful for Pho So 1 for expanding the menu.


Overall, it doesn't taste exactly like the old pho so1, but it definitely is good in its own different way. Don't knock it down because it's not exactly like the old joint. After all, things change and sometimes it's for the better.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,5,4,5,QeB3o6pcGZWYTEQbhjmNCw

That's a 180 degree turn from what I been used to at these establishments. 

So since service was on point, you all probably want to know how was the food.  Well, let me describe each with a small description.

Roasted hen with noodles - all I need to say is the flavor was non stop! A winner.

Roasted hen with tomato rice - kids loved it and it came with pickled daikon and carrots - YES!

Beef and broccoli with steam rice - healthy choice. Ok....

Rice plate with two items - egg meatloaf delish. Pork had alot of fat; bummer, planning to get the beef next time instead of pork.

4848560,2018-05-09,3,_e5KDltp_0XNkylTYR1V2w,"Quick & Dirty: I would confidently bring my parents to eat at Pho So 1 because they hit on how a restaurant should represent our people's food. (I don't say that very often about Vietnamese restaurants, too.) And other peeps feel the same way because I saw mad Viet families up in there, yo. lol. Asian to non-Asian ratio was like 15 to 1.

Things to know:
*****
I. LOCATION & PARKING: Find Pho So 1 in the center of a strip mall off the intersection of West Spring Mountain Road and South Decatur Boulevard (Chinatown). They have plenty of parking.

II. FOOD & DRINK: Sure, they have your rice plates, bowls of soup, and noodle dishes, but they have multiple iterations of each kind (something I've only seen in Cali and Houston). I tasted the following:

*Goi Cuon ($5.95): Pricey, but worth it. I tried both their bo nuong (charbroiled beef) and tom thit (traditional with pork and shrimps) and loved their on-point flavors. More importantly, though, their sauce had an ideal consistency and peanut buttery taste. 

*Oxtail Pho ($13.95): I don't prefer oxtail pho because I don't like the smell as much as shoulder or femur, but I tried theirs. And I liked it! They scoop the scum from the pot, which results in a clean, translucent broth.

I also like how one can order different sides. I asked for gan (tendon) and nam (flank). They cooked both very well. 

*Cafe Sua Da ($3.75): I would probably dock them a star for not bringing it out with the coffee drip and glass of ice, but I can't hate. It tasted both bold and sweet. Kiss me.

III. SERVICE: Fast. No problems there.

IV. AMBIANCE & DECOR: The newly renovated restaurant feels clean and modern, without losing its Vietnamese roots. Also, they have three different sections, and it seems like most of the tables can accommodate large families. 

V. PRICES: Most dishes cost less than $10. And for the amount of food one can get that's a lot of value.

VI. OVERALL: I think Pho So 1 gave me the best meal during my most recent Vegas trip. Thanks for steering me in the right direction, Yelp!",pnTiEaqM4slogpY97n9Kvg,7,7,5,kAp4v9lpHqfuFyidWDkUyQ

Wife wanted to try Las Vegas pho. I told her not to get her expectations up, because it wasn't likely that Las Vegas pho would be any better than Little Saigon pho, or real Saigon pho, for that matter. Probably better than Fargo pho, though. 

Pho So is in Las Vegas' Chinatown area, a little to the west of The Strip on Spring Mountain Road. It's in a crowded strip mall, and depending on where you enter or leave, what day and time it is, it can be a nightmare!! Took 10 minutes to back up and get out of the parking lot: about a total of 30 feet!! 10 freaking minutes!! Hell, real Saigon pho isn't worth that!!! Well, maybe if the waitress was naked....., but I digress!!

So we had a few spring rolls and some pho. The pho was so...so. Pho So had so so pho!! Get it? Bwahahahaha! Hold on, let me catch my breath! 

It's much like any Vietnamese pho restaurant, and I've been to a few dozen, in Little Saigon and real Saigon. And Phan Thiet also. About $27.50 went into decor, and maybe double that for furnishings. The food's decent, but seriously, it's not worth 10 minutes to move my car 30 feet. Treasure Island opened some pho place, and next time I told my wife we'd go there. The pho is probably half the quality at twice the price, and yes, it'll take 10 minutes to get there from the parking lot, but at least we're moving!!! Yes, some In-N-Out drive thrus take 20-30 minutes to get through, but dude!! In-N-Out!! It's worth it!! Pho So isn't.
