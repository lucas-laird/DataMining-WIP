Their food is pretty great, prices very reasonable. Open late too. But more than once I've been let down by the lack of communication between staff, and inattention to me, the customer.  

Tonight I was flying solo, and sat at the counter. I figured that would be a high-visibility location, but I guessed wrong. Took me 20 minutes to get my soda (after paying while ordering). The soda and pizza came at same time, and that was the only time I saw a server before asking for a box, which I had to flag someone to get. I felt like they were deliberately avoiding me which doesn't make for a great dining experience.  Get it to go, you'll be thankful.",abw6bqZccf9C_mT1_nqe2g,0,0,3,o0HZqyU_BFqqJjpojlZUFA

I asked if they could guarantee the food here by that time because it had almost been 3 hours and then couldnt guarantee anything so I canceled the order. I decided to give it another shot last night and ordered a well done pizza. The pizza was falling apart and was very sloppy. I also had tipped the delivery driver over $20. The manager refused to come get the pizza, or even replace it. I hadnt even eaten the pizza because it was that bad, I only had 1 slice.

260614,2017-08-12,0,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"So, this is our go-to place for pizza delivery. Sad that it's three stars. It would actually be four, but for the lack of consistency. Once, the pizza comes undercooked (which is awesome for leftovers) but a bit of a pain if you have to bake it further when your delivery arrives); the next time, it comes just under overcooked. Just. Almost perfect that day, but a little dried out as leftovers. 

The quality of the pizza has been good every time. Can't complain about that. Just the lack of consistency in prep. The quality of other things... meh. But that's why pizza is the most delivered food in the US. It travels well. 

Speaking of traveling, the delivery is excellent. Could be because I add the tip ahead of time and it's always 20 percent or at least $10. I don't think it's too much to compensate for my laziness for not going to pick it up myself. And I want to make sure the driver is paid well. Would you want to deliver food for a living? I know I wouldn't. 

Napoli, work on your consistency and on the quality of your Philly cheese steak sandwiches and we'll likely be customers for life. Good pizza at the end of it all. I'll up your stars if I can get three pizzas in a row cooked consistently. ;-)",JB0CFbFKWSZd9_O1DClK9w,1,0,3,U_eqRq85Vt8MiC9pDJ3O-w

413178,2011-08-25,1,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"First let me preface this review, I do not like giving bad reviews.

Napoli Pizza & Restaurant has Dine-in, take out and delivery. 
Their menu has soups, appetizers, salads, chicken wings & fingers, chicken dinners, ribs, hot & cold sandwiches, hamburgers, pasta, veal, desserts, a children's menu and Pizza. 

their pricing is about average for what they serve.

I like Pizza, I have had a number of different types of pizza, different places around the world and there are a few things that I expect when I order a pizza for delivery. First the pizza be there when I am told it would arrive, Napoli Pizza was in the time frame that they say they would arrive. That was the best part of the experience.

The Pizza I ordered was a 24"" Alfredo Pizza with Canadian Bacon. The pizza toppings was in the center of the pizza, about what you would expect on a 14"" or 16"" pizza. The Canadian Bacon was cut up deli ham (I love Canadian Bacon on my pizza, when I order Canadian Bacon I expect Canadian Bacon). The center of the pizza was soggy, and the dough did not appear to be cooked all the way. I am not sure if it was because they cooked it and let it sit in the box awhile or if it was just under cooked. The outside edge of the pizza was brown. Instead of the traditional wedge cut slices the pizza was cross cut into small squares, and most of the time it was not cut all the way through. That could have been because it was such a large pizza.

Overall I can give them 1 star for being on time, however, the pizza although barely edible, it is not a pizza I would ever order from them again, so I give 1 star for the pizza. 

They have a very large selection on their menu, unfortunately, because of the experience I had with the pizza I will not sample any other items, This is one delivery menu I will be throwing away.",J16PltC-ta3pmJ-cZVGJqg,0,0,2,eONKmrsn26BwNPJqfjm94g

If you want a genuine pizza and not a corporate pie, try the take out special. 

Delivery service for any pizza place has too many variables. Busy, lame unreliable drivers, traffic, other deliveries fouling things up. I never review a place based on delivery. One day you get it in 20, another day the same thing in 80. Restaurants can't control delivery like Americans expect.

The guy that took the order was very professional, he repeated the order back to make sure nothing was missed, gave us the  dollar amount and told us 1 hour..  Sure enough 1 hour later the bell rang.  The delivery guy was very nice, he set the food on the table and left.

We picked up the pizza and drove back to our motel. 

 Back in the room we settled in and opened our pizza and our beers. The pizza was fantastic. I don't recall exactly what we got, but half was just cheese (possibly four of them?) and the other half a pretty standard pepperoni and sausage. White sauce. It really was a great pizza. The beer was less than great, but I can hardly blame Napoli for that. The room was also only so-so, as was the Discovery Channel's show about giant catfish. But the vacation sex was hot, so all-in-all, a pretty good night.

I told him I wanted a refund for the drink since I did not consume it. He walked away and never came back. As were finishing dinner I asked about my refund of $2.25 again the owner/manager came over now he was pretty mad at me and told us to never come back.

I have only continued to reorder because every once in a while, they make the best pizza and other amazing food. Unfortunately, more often than not, the pizza comes cold, undercooked, with only a small amount of toppings. There have been times to where I could swear they were serving manufactured dough/cardboard. I literally started ordering online so that I didn't have to deal with the person answering the phone due to broken english. 

I also love their potato skins...when done properly. Most of the time they come severely over or under cooked with two shreds of cheese and one piece of bacon. 

I've had better luck ordering during the day and with their really big pizzas.

The wait time for delivery has lessened a bit, but more importantly, everything is always done right. Every order has been correct, nothing missing, all condiments and 'extras' present, and everything is fresh and delicious. I swear even the fries have gotten better (though I can't speak for the chili).

While this store's menu is still comparable to a hundred others in the city, they do it noticeably better than most. The food is good and the service has improved. Hopefully I won't ever need to contact them about a complaint again, but I imagine it would be handled well at this point.

Napoli burgers are some of the best you can have delivered to your door. Seriously, they are legit, as are the chicken wings. I'm at a point now where I will recommend Napoli to friends.

The pizza is decent.  It was delivered fresh and hot, but the quality of the topping ingredients weren't the best.  The crust is probably the highlight for me, with a good amount of chewiness and not at all burnt or limp.  The pizza I *may* order again, but nothing else.

No matter how desperate your craving, do not order the ""Childrens Macaroni & Cheese.""  The portion size was good, but it was dry and some noodles still crunchy.  Cheese not quality.

Also stay away from the dessert... the ""strawberry shortcake"" was really a slice of cake, which looked and felt like it had been left out for a week.  Spongy and disgusting.  The same goes for the zeppolis which were hard and seemed old.",4NfIpag40h-YuBz461eGFg,0,0,2,QEXyrhje_czD17RbYH9Tpg

All acting as if they are doing something in an empty restaurant on a Wednesday around 5pm. I walk up to the guy after he signaled me and ask for a slice of pizza. He tells me they stop serving slices at 3pm. He did not offer anything to me. I looked at him with great disappointment. As I turned away and walked down the way to the Chamango establishment, who appreciated me coming in. Neither of the employees offered me something else. Neither employee asked or even compromised with me to make me a happy customer that would return. I could have been talked into buying a full pizza with wings, and garlic knots; on how hungry I was. Granted I would have shared the food with others, and recommended this place to eat. Because of the shitty service and how I felt. I will never step foot into this place again.

Sure, they may have a long wait time, be a bit privy, and have forgotten part of my order at the store before, but I've always dealt with it because frankly, they're accommodating and give you a LOT of food.  However, tonight showed me just how little they care about their customers.  I have never had a problem ordering multiple flavors on my chicken fingers or upgrading (for a hefty fee) regular fries to curly fries, but tonight I was flat out told ""no"" and that it was ""company policy.""  Upon calling back to cancel my order, I didn't even get an apology.  I work face-to-face with customers at a fortune-500 company and know that a good rule of thumb is that even if you can't accommodate a customer,  to at LEAST apologize for it.  I am seriously sad to say I can no longer be a Napoli customer due to their severely poor customer service skills, and I hope others will stand to not put up with it either.",IoC2t71vaXBMUIe7pI98jQ,4,0,1,Q39ds99vY0ypsT7Uh4wxXg

I uncomfortably read out pretty much all my card info to them (and rest assured, i will be checking my charges), and it was then that I found out it would take an hour and 25 minutes to deliver. I have no idea what you need an hour for, but late night delivery should be faster with less customers. The worst part was I found this out after they had all my credit card info, if I'd known the time first, I would've canceled, but with my info, you might as well have called it a hostage situation, When the food arrived 1 hour and 45 minutes later, i was alone and annoyed, so you can imagine my annoyance when i had to direct the driver to my address, even though I had given it over the phone, When he finally got to me, he imprinted my card (now they have image and all its info) and gave me the pizza, which was hot and delicious. I won't harp on the food, but they reallly have to up their service to get me to order again, No matter how good the food is, I'm not risking random charges and waiting 2 hours for a single pizza.

The pizza is thin crust and can be greasy. When delivery takes too long, the bottom tends to get soggy which is gross. So it's definitely better to dine in or pick up.  Also, they have a ridiculously large 30"" square pizza that barely fit through the front door!

We've ordered other misc items such as zeppolis and the buffalo chicken salad, which are both delicious.  The pasta was okay, but not exceptional, but it tends to be a better option for delivery. The Strombolis and calzones are  super cheesy and don't seem to get soggy like the pizza when delivered. 

I've ordered via phone and eat24. Usually get put on hold when calling in. And delivery takes a while when delivered both ways. It usually takes then 45min-1hr+ (usually more) to deliver. 

Bottom line: I like their food, but it's greasy pizza that can backfire (soggy crust) if you're getting it delivered, which can take 1hr+.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,3,1,4,Hhy5se6OCNz3cruRa9KUJw

She said she KNEW we ordered pepperoni but they would deliver a new pizza to us for free! Great, right?  Well, a minute later our phone rang and Angela was calling to argue again that we've always ordered pepperoni and did this time too! She insisted that we ordered the wrong pizza but she would deliver us a new pizza, as if we were idiots and she never made a mistake. Her bad attitude was unbelievable and confrontational!! My husband was as nice as can be to her and was not expecting to argue over a pizza topping.  And other reviewers are correct. You get alot of stares from employees when you walk in and are ignored for quite awhle before you are even spoken to. There are too many good pizza places in town to deal with such rudeness.

I had to wait over an hour for such a small order and the delivery driver couldn't even make it to my door. I had to meet him at my gate which isn't close to my house at all. When I finally received my food it was cold and tasteless. The zeppoles aren't even zeppoles, they were like pancake balls that were set to the side too long. They were extremely chewy and stale! The curly fries weren't even curly anymore, seriously cold and soggy. I don't even want to describe my pizza, the majority of people know once a pizza gets cold the cheese is disgusting and it's like eating a piece of cardboard. 
When I asked for a refund the manager refused and said they delivered on time. The customer service was horrible and I even spoke to the manager and general manager Aleks and Victor and they were both bad at their jobs. Victor even told me that ""if the food is edible then I should just keep it."" 
Never again will I order from here or any of my friends and family. 
This review was completely honest and will be posted on every site just so everyone can know, with the prices it's definitely not worth it. 

I do recommend Verrazano's, great pizza nice and thin with a great amount of cheese!
I also recommend not ordering from Eat24 as well because their customer service is horrible.. they always choose the restaraunt sides. Don't waste your time. Use Postmates, Grubhub or any other delivery app besides Eat24.

2656976,2017-01-21,6,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"Still my favorite pizza place in Vegas. The workers are so amazing. They're always so welcoming and they have fun with it! Amazing service and know how to get stuff done. You can eat there, pick up, or have it delivered! I come here a lot since it's across the street from my work. It's in the parking lot on Sahara and Decatur next to Dotty's! They have an awesome set up inside. I love how spacious it is and how you're not super cramped in there. It's nice and bright in there so it puts you in a good mood just walking in. They have a wide selection of food. You can get anything from a cheese steak (chicken and beef), ham and cheese sandwiches, fried calamari sticks, salads, soup, meatball subs, burgers, wings, and even pasta. And obviously pizza!! THEY HAVE A GLUTEN FREE MENU AS WELL. As if they didn't have enough options. It's so cool to me! Also a kids menu. 

For me, a pizza isn't good unless you can pick it up and it sags over. You get that here. It's really delicious. It is greasy, but if you don't like greasy pizza, it's hard enough to trust you. I can't stand that deep dish thing people do. That's pie. Not a pizza. This is real pizza. Here if you pickup a one topping 16 inch pizza for only 8.99.. It's literally cheaper than getting a small. Might as well get a 16 inch!!! It's for all 3 locations as well. 

The desserts alone kill me every time. Nutella cheesecake, baklava, tiramisu, rice pudding, and more! I am always scared of trying baklava any where else because mother makes it best. It tasted just like my moms though and I was sooo happy!! Nutella or caramel cheesecake is straight up my favorite though. 

The burgers are too big to even fit in my mouth. You can pick from half a pound or a full pound. And it's real meat! Large selection of burgers. I finally tried it earlier today and I was so pleased with it. It comes with fries but you can substitute it for onion rings and more. The 1000 island burger is really delicious! 

Amazing food, amazing service, huge portions, great prices. I will always recommend this place and I respect the owner/workers here so much!!",Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,12,13,5,e6Y2QZkb1f0LZ4tCKykazg

The crust was white and doughy, there was almost no sauce on it, it appears that the driver put it on his passenger seat and two-thirds of the pizza had slid to one side of the box.

Steak salad was good - nothing really stood out that would make me HAVE to have it again, but there wasn't anything to complain about. The pizza was delicious though! The crust was just the right amount of crisp, chew, grease, and flavor :-) I will definitely order again to try out all the other fun pizza on the menu (I'm lookin' at you Taco pizza).

I looked at their menu and saw there was only a $1 difference so I instead asked for a $1 refund, the difference between what I paid for and what I received.

3083313,2009-10-22,0,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"As someone who spent the last four years living in NYC, I'm very familiar with ""New York style"" pizza. In fact, I lived above Rosario's on the Lower East Side, where I'd grab a *perfect* pepperoni slice four times a week. So naturally I was excited to read about Napoli.

Expecting to be wowed, I dialed in a delivery order for an 18"" pie with pepperoni and onions for about $18. When it arrived an hour later, the results were immediately disappointing. 

First of all, let's make something clear. ""New York style"" pizza is not rocket science. It's defining quality is simplicity--a thin, floppy slice with fresh tomato sauce. When it's really good, there's a pool of grease on the surface that rolls down your arm. Shake some pepper flakes and powdered garlic on it and you're done. It should never be crispy, ""doughy"" or covered with pretentious crap. Anything beyond pepperoni is pushing it. 

This pizza, on the other hand, was bready and sweet. The cheese formed a film which slid off in your mouth. I didn't find the ingredients especially flavorful, fresh or abundant. Adding insult to injury, there was a $3.50 delivery charge and the driver gave me lip for going ""out of his way."" In sum, it was typical suburban pizza, marginally better than the major chains but thoroughly pedestrian. 

Now, I'll concede that the debate on what constitutes a true ""New York style"" pizza will undoubtedly continue raging for centuries. But here's two things to consider: 1) Not all pizza in New York is good. 2) Not all New Yorkers have good taste. In fact, many are perfectly happy with Sbarro and Domino's. I am not one of them. Indeed, I feel a certain responsibility to defend the ""New York"" monicker from those who would profit from its misuse. If my critique of Napoli seems harsh, I beg you to keep this in mind.",tfDKZHUUb4SnAWuPOPqw5Q,3,0,2,iUEQq7vtlB7vTO6FHanPow

Besides the pizza being amazing, the wings and chicken fingers are really good too! 

As for the pasta I wouldn't vouch for it. My sister tried the fettuccini Alfredo, and I felt it was flavorless. The chicken that goes with the pasta is just as flavorless and has an odd look to it. It's clearly frozen and looks like it was put in the microwave to defrost than thrown on the pasta. Def didn't like it, but not every restaurant can perfect every entree. 

Now, lets discuss pizza! Their Southwestern Chicken Pizza is hands down my favorite! Its like having nachos but on a pizza! I know the nachos vision on pizza doesn't sound great but I can assure you, it's great! It has so much flavor to it - guaranteed to fall in love with every flavorful bite! Their pizza comes with a nice, thick, crunchy crust which makes the bite 10x more enjoyable! If a pizza with a lot of toppings is this great, I'm sure any other pizza they offer is just as good! 

The wings and chicken fingers are really good here! On the wings if you request them crunchy/extra cooking they'll have a real good crunch to them! Not many places are willing to cook a chicken wing for an extra minute, but Napolis doesn't mind it.
They're all about the customer experience, or so it seems! I have yet to have a bad experience with the restaurant. 

If you're someone that enjoys spicy food be sure to try their ""Hot"" flavored chicken fingers! They're dipping in a buffalo sauce with chili peppers, super spicy! I def can't handle all that heat but I still have one just to satisfy the spicy craving. 

Hope everyone has a satisfying experience as I've had every time I order from Napolis.",TuiE29h_b7P5zOqi2DRbpA,0,0,4,Hl2OD2izO8C9k-fKUjqK7A

If only I was able to give no stars, because this place does not deserve a single one. I called this place based on a suggestion of a very good friend of mine who said that they had great food. Unfortunately they were unable able to cater to my allergy so I had to order pizza elsewhere. I did order garlic balls and three Italian sodas. I called and put in my order to this location first prior to putting my pizza order in somewhere else.

 I was told that our order will arrive in 45 minutes to an hour. After an hour had passed I called back and spoke to the same woman I put my initial order with and she told me that it was not an hour yet it had only been 50 minutes, plus she argued with me!! I checked the phone and the call time on my cell phone and it had been an hour. She said that the driver had just left and would be here in a few minutes. When I told her that the pizza had arrived long before their driver had she told me that they were three times busier than everyone else and that was why. Why would you ever tell a client that?

 I got off the phone we waited ten more minutes the driver had still not arrived , so I called them again and asked for a manager. The manager, named Bob came on the phone I explained the situation very nicely without getting angry or loud and was trying to find out where are sodas and are garlic balls were because we had already received our pizza from the place we called after them. So the manager fight with me and argue with me and what time it was I told him that the time was 11:15 and had already been well over an hour since we ordered he insisted that the time was only 11:04 and it was only an hour since we put in our order. No I called your person an hour ago and talked to them and told them that the driver had not arrived yet. He told me that I was yelling at him, so I put him on speakerphone so my friends could hear the way that he spoke to me. You've got to be kidding me that you speak to clients like that. When I told him that their place had been suggested by a very good friend of mine he said he really didn't care. I asked him to cancel my order three times before he said he would and he said he would refund my money in 24 to 48 hours. He told me that he would cancel the driver.

I think the best part of the night was when 10 minutes after I got off the phone with the manager his staff member called me and asked me what flavor I wanted for the wings. When I sounded confused and said we actually just cancelled our order with you and I spoke to the manager she said oh so you actually have the same telephone number that's similar to the person that I was trying to reach.

Ordered a small calzone(pictured & half eaten, it was double its size & to them is considered ""small"" portion."" Also ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries, a philly cheesesteak & some curly cheese bacon fries. Having eaten their food before i was expecting goodness. Please note that i paid with card on yelp. I was 4 miles from them.. the order took about 50 mins. So delivery guy comes, my fiance answers & hes telling my fiance that he needs to pay cash. Im looking at the reciept that says $47.88. So he asks me what happened.. i double check to see if i messed up & my fiance looks at his card statement online to show proof of purchase & to our surprise we are charged THREE times. NONE of which were the amount on the reciept at the door. We expected the bill to be $1 more than yelp said due to sauce charge. We didn't know they would charge us 3 times then argue when his restaurant under charged me TWO CENTS. They charged me 3 times.. each bill was $46-$47 EACH. The delivery guy wanted to say that none of the amounts were right because the last charge was $47.86 (which was the highest charge) I was upset & said ""If you would like the 2 cents i willl gladly get it for you"" & he declined, asking for a signature. Needless to say BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

But on a lighter note :) my bacon cheeseburger was AMAZING! Not dry, or soggy like most i order! The curly bacon cheese fries were gross. They tasted stale and undercooked. The calzone was amazing! & huge. When i saw the pizza box, i thought he had the wrong order. & i was told the philly was really good!

The next time we ordered we ended up getting a smaller size pizza and a combo platter. The combo platter comes with mozzarella sticks, fried mushrooms, zucchini sticks, jalapeno poppers, and onion rings. The pizza was consistent to the good quality of the first time we ordered. The combo platter was hot when it arrived. Everything was tasty but I wasn't a fan of the zucchini sticks.

3602196,2011-08-30,1,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"Second time here; my first experience would have been...probably a 3.5 star, but I'm glad I came back to get a better picture.

It's around 730pm on a Monday night. My best friend wanted pizza and I wanted fries, so we go to dine-in at Napoli's. Their extensive menu is convenient as he can get his pizza fix and I can get my frenchy fry on.

Now here is where we go on a roller coaster ride...
Walking in: no greeting whatsoever. Lots of staring, no smiling. Both girls at the counter are on the phone. Seems standard enough.
Ordering: One girl at the counter was on the phone and although I can never be too sure, she did not look like she was taking an order at all. She was leaning back against the counter and just casually chatting into the phone. She looks at me and I smile at her, waiting patiently. She stares and keeps talking. A few moments pass, she's still on the phone, and I'm getting looks from the cooks in the back. Finally, she yells out for the other girl to come out and take my order while she resumes talking on the phone. I don't know who takes that long to order food from a restaurant but they really had this chick occupied. Finally, the other lady comes out and I put my order in.
Food/Service: The other lady is actually really nice, and she made our experience a lot better. She was friendly, talked and joked with us, which is nice since we didn't really feel like we were getting any attention at this place (did I mention we were the only patrons here?). We had ordered calamari, pasta (came with garlic bread and a side salad), a small supreme pizza, chicken alfredo, and curly cheese fries with bacon bits. Everything was good except the fries. Ready to quench my thirst for greasy, fried potato goodness, I stabbed my fork into the fries, only to find the combination of fries, cheese, and bacon had melded into a solid brick of lukewarm lard. I am beginning to get the idea that this basket has been sitting for a while, as it was also the last thing to come from the kitchen (when it should have been one of the first). Hmm. I take it back to the front, asking if I can return it. I didn't even want them to make another. Nice Lady says she'll have to ask her manager and tells me to give her a few moments. She comes back out to say her manager is busy and to give her about five minutes. I go back to sit down. 

By the time we were done with our meal, we still haven't heard from the manager. Best Friend tells me to forget about it. So we do. Consider it their tip.

Bottom line is, the food is mostly good, but the service is terrible. 90% of the time, the girls at the counter were on the phone. I'm pretty sure they were answering phone orders, but that one extremely rude girl was pretty much on the phone the ENTIRE TIME we were there, except to give us our pizza. Staff seemed to stare a lot...but that might be because we were the only ones in the restaurant.",LYRFBeNtOjvze_h4gjTIUA,1,0,2,Dq1142XjPOxkC-273nUidQ

I called in an order and made sure to say I needed it as fast as possible, assuming it would be 45 minutes for a pizza and a salad, it's been an hour and a half, when I called in the guy on the phone said I told you on the phone it would take an hour, yet the driver hadn't even left the building yet and he hung up on me. At this point I don't even care if the food is the best food I've ever had, I'll never buy food here again and I'll make sure none of my family here does as well. They don't deserve business if they can't handle the customer service side of it.

So it's now been 2 hours that I've been waiting for my food, I called in and asked how much longer it would be and the guy said 10 minutes, this was 30 minutes ago.

Edit--
Adding in that the food was ALL cold, the pizza cheese was almost frozen, the curly fries were soggy as well as the salad. And to top it off they forgot my sons breadsticks which I clearly said twice and he confirmed on the phone and repeated back breadsticks to me.

This is the email I sent to them about my experience last night. After what I delt with when I called to complain this morning I doubt whom ever reads it will care so I am sharing it with ya'all as a head's up.

To whom it may concern:

We ordered a pizza, BLT and a side of fries and had it delivered to our room at the Rio last night at 9:30 PM.

Let me start with the ordering process...
After repeating myself over and over again to the not so pleasant women on the other end of the phone whom was have just as hard of a time understanding me as I was her I finally got our order in. (This process was enough to make me not want to order from here again.)

At 10:50 PM our order finally arrived. Your driver was polite to my surprise after what I delt with on the phone. I was however very uncomfortable with the fact that he made an imprint of my card and took it with him...

Awww finally now we get to eat...  Nope!! The pizza was burnt and tasted aweful the BLT was lettuce and A LOT of mayo with a little piece of tomato and a pice of burnt bacon. Now on to the fries completely soggy and they tast like pickles because for some reason someone thought putting pickles ontop of the fies was a good idea.

I spent $50 on a meal my family and I couldn't even eat.

After getting into it with your manager just now  whom evidently is also the same women I talked to last night. It is clear to me that you don't care about your customers and you go by the manager is always right because she has to come in and work at 9AM after working until 1 AM the night before motto.",pFROGfAQppS4DjESN5q16A,5,1,1,-3nwi4dwEy0Zqq5ZfNM7Nw

I moved to Las Vegas 6 years ago and found Napoli through a friend who knows how much I love pizza. I've lived all over the valley and chose Napoli over other places all the time. I convinced coworkers of mine to refer Napoli to guests over other pizza places that provided kickbacks to staff. They were amazing. I've converted households into Napoli pizza only houses. I had only one time where the pizza wasn't right and the manager said no problem, keep that pizza and I'll make you a better one! All of this started to change over the last few months. Delivery would take 2 hours when I was told 1 hour and 15 min. The pizza would come sliced like a kindergartner was playing in the kitchen. I like margarita pizza and they started arriving mushy, only to be told that because there were tomatoes on it, it was mushy. This was never the case before but somehow this time it was my fault. I asked the lady to fix the issue and she was kind enough to bring it back to the chef and bring it back to my table, only to find it was over cooked and burnt in some places. I realized recently the the young lady who used to be the cashier was no longer there. She was sweet as pie but probably had experienced crap changes or new crap management. Other friends of mine mentioned their recent lack of satisfaction with Napoli and I started to realize it wasn't just me...it was Napoli. Very sad and frustrated I gave them another chance. Surprise surprise, my order of one pizza and wings took two hours to arrive. I called to ask for part of my order to be refunded but some incompetent and rude manager who said his name was Bob, said no because they were busy. I told Bob that I expected a call the following day from Victor, the owner, manager or GM but he must not understand how to work a telephone because I never received a call back. The other evening I was going to a friends and said I'd bring some food. My first thought was always Napoli but I had a very bitter taste in my mouth so I decided to call and see if I could get Victor on the phone and possibly give them one last chance. I did and it was the most pointless and sickening phone conversation I've ever had which ended with victor telling me he hopes mine and my moms apartments burn down. Cool, Victor. There's a reason why Napoli sucks so bad now and I see it. You. Oh and by the way, I don't live in an apartment and nor does my mother but you never would have known that because I'd never welcome your trash establishment back to my front doorstep.

I don't know how he does it. But he really cares about what he's doing.

It's the crust; it's the ingredients.

They offer a great variety of food but the reason I keep going back is for the pizza. It's just addicting. The hardest part of going to Napoli is deciding how big of a pizza you want. They have an awesome pick up special for $7.99 where you get a 16 inch 1 topping pizza. I'm saving the 30 inch pizza for a special occasion. They also have Italian soda and homemade lemonade. They are open until 2am and Thursday through Saturday they are open until 3am. The restaurant is kind of small but they have really great lunch specials. Actually....

First of all this place is NOT owned by Italians, they are either Russian or Ukrainian or something.

I ordered the following:

1. Veal Marsala - no taste, they don't know they are doing, it was tough & at $17.99, a rip off.

2. They have no beef ravioli, so I had to order the pastrami sandwich which I read had 1000 Island dressing on it. I got French on mine instead (what?) I haven't tried it yet, although I tried to take a bite & it was mostly all bread as it was like thick sub bread.

3. I asked for lemons with my salad, I got none so I can't eat it.

4. I asked for angel hair pasta as my pasta side & I got NO SAUCE. They just poured oil & probably threw a bit of garlic salt on top. It was like eating plain pasta.

5. I asked if their tomatoes were ripe so I could get the salad caprese & they said no, the girl didn't even know what the word ripe meant. I had to ask 3 times & even the guy, who I assume is the owner, said no, they aren't ripe, they are fresh. 

What does that mean? LOL Ripe IS fresh. 

Forget it, they don't even understand English & for a restaurant to admit their produce isn't ripe is (well fill in the blank)

6. I was told $3.50 for delivery, he tried to charge me $4.50 when I called back. While he gave it to me for $3.50, I shouldn't have had to insist.

7. I was charged $1 for using my credit card which is illegal to do, but they all do it here in Vegas.

8. While they weren't mean or anything, they weren't outright friendly either.

I lost $40 (that includes tip) for the 2 items above & the tiramisu (I haven't tried it yet). It probably  isn't real tiramisu.",0LHevpOrufWaU8pBiTc4gQ,4,1,1,ju-AbR_LEjMdL6HdpPuq7w

We went here for lunch yesterday, and there are so many mon-fri lunch specials for $7.99 (entrée & drink). One of our friends is a regular here, as her day job is around the corner.

It was nice outside so we opted for al fresco dining. One of our friends got a calzone, the other got the blackened chicken salad (came with garlic bread), my husband got the philly (came with fries), and I got the ravioli (came with garlic bread). I really liked the pasta- was good size, cheesy, and al dente, I don't get that too much, because we really don't go to Italian restaurants much, except for maybe, Buca Di Beppo or Strings. Our friend says she's tried many of their menu items because her coworkers order from here all the time.  

I didn't know what to order, because there were so many lunch special choices. After seeing what we all got (and everyone liked it too), I want to try some other things on the menu. Free refills on the drinks, too.

The staff was all very nice. Service was quick. As we were sitting out there, noticed four delivery men walking back to the restaurant. It's a busy place for lunch; it's obvious there is a ton of repeat business. Inside ambiance is very nice. Red checkered table cloths, and looks very Italian-restaurant themed, too.

Well i called back to let her know it was done and inform her that my review was up and screen shotted my coupon. She said i couldnt have my boss pick up the order cause she needs my phone to be there. So i couldnt use it. I said to cancel the garlic balls because she was just asking me to do way too much for what's advertised and that we would be there to pick up the rest of the order... and i just called back to change my order to from pick up to delivery and found out that my ENTIRE order was cancelled, more or less because I said they are being ridiculous for making me jump through hurdles due to their app being malfunctioned.

The gyro is pretty tasty, but I wish it had more meat. (That's what she said.)

My biggest complaint is how long it takes to deliver the food. They routinely take 45+ mins. One time I ordered and it took so long that I forgot I placed an order until the driver showed up an hour and a half later with a little bit of an attitude.

4346080,2016-04-16,2,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"This rating reflects Napoli's wings and fries. Big, juicy wings offered in several flavors. Like, garlic parmesan, teriyaki, lemon pepper, bbq, hot, mild, medium, possibly others. I'm not a fan of hot wings so I get garlic parm and lemon pepper. I love that they come in a white sauce instead of oil (eek). 
Napoli also has great fries. I hate to order fries to go because by the time I get home it usually get's soggy. Napoli fries surprisingly did not! It's made with some sort of coting which makes it pretty yum. My friend things it's fried in flour and I think it's fried in the same oil as curly fries (YES THEY GOT CURLY FRIES!) and the residue from the curly fries sticks to regular. Either way, the fries is pretty good. 
I am personally not a fan of their pizza, I find it to be soggy and flavorless. I may give it another try at some point but for now, I will stick to the wings. They are DAMN good!
This location gets pretty busy. If you are ordering to go and they tell you 30-40 min, it'll probably mean 1 hour. You can give your phone number and they will call you when it's ready.

I was working at the Barrett Joackson Car Auction at Mandalay Bay and we had a lot of hungry workers to feed. Of course pizza is a go to in a situation like that. We called up Napoli's and ordered three 30-inch pizzas. One with half plain cheese, and half veggies. The other two we got the meat lovers. 

First off - awesome they could deliver to us at the Auction as it was a busy event and the pizza delivery person had to call us and park in a parking lot not on the property. He waited for us to walk out to get the pizzas.

Everyone who was eating the pizza said the same thing: GREAT PIZZA! I personally thought the cheese was the best part. The meat was plentiful, as were the veggies. The meat pizza was a bit too greasy for me, but it was still good. But the veggie one was amazing! So many vegetables! They did not skimp. Although, I do think there were a bit too many onions. I picked a bunch off my slice, but hey, some people may like that many. *shrug*

The employees continually yelled back at the kitchen wondering where our order was. Several times we were told it would be out on just a minute. One time we heard the guy in back say we had to put another one in. After an hour, our pizza finally came out.

The lady behind the counter answered me saying that with the rain, they just get busy.  I just love being lied to and pushed away.  I love people who cannot be accountable, especially when those people are business owners.

The service is awful, there are like 4 waitress and waiters doing pretty much nothing, they don't ask you if you need anything else, even when they see that you run out of drinks and all the cups are empty, they didn't even tell us to ""Enjoy the Pizza"" or anything like that...

The pizza was pretty good. They didn't skimp on the toppings which is nice but it wasn't my favorite. The crust was a little soggy for my liking and they put the brocolli stems as a topping as  well. Usually you have just the florets but they chopped up the stems and put them on their like soggy bell pepper. Kind of weird. 

We also ordered fried mozzarella sticks which were okay, they tasted like the frozen kind you buy at the grocery store. The fried mushrooms weren't very good, half were overcooked/burnt. The potato skins were dried out and lacked flavor. I did enjoy the Italian wedding soup though. It has good flavor and tons of pasta and meatballs. 

Probably wouldn't order delivery from them again considering that the only thing I enjoyed was the soup.",BpJWttiu9h5cgxtVkQZGXw,5,3,2,P6db_SLilmuxFTcnyRMqDg

I called in the morning to confirm my order and they said that they were making it. When I got there at 11 AM I stood at the front counter for 15 minutes before somebody even acknowledge that I was there. Finally when the cashier asked if she can help me, I asked for my order and it wasn't ready. She then asked me if I could wait 30 minutes so that they can complete the order. I explained to her that the food was for a business meeting and that I have been bragging about Napolis pizza. I had no other choice but to wait 30 minutes and have my fellow colleagues and boss wait for me. On top of that my boss would call me every two minutes to check and see where I was.

Thanks to my scooby doo crew down the street giving me the best referral a girl could ask for, aka this pizza spot, my mouth just had the priviledge of having a series of orgasms, one after another, all over my mouth and tongue!! The funny thing is... our local friend already knew this place and had ordered from them several times for one delicious pizza after another, just didn't know the name off hand, nor had he been to their location. 

Wooo! Yeah! So... there was three of us to feed and I didn't want there to be a shortage of pizza and/or us to be scavenging through the cupboards of our beloved friend's house late night tonight, so I wanted to go big, real big. I ordered the extra large pizza, aka 24 inches of pure pleasure (half pesto, half italian sausage) and a greek salad for the road. The salad was anything short of toppings and the pizza was so monsterous, we had to put it in the trunk of my SUV! We barely chipped away at half of it between the three of us. Crazy! 

Whoa-- the pie itself was ahhhhmazing. Dough made fresh, in-house and completely soft with a touch of browned/burntness around the edges. Another yelper said epic, I will have to second that notion. EPIC PIZZA to start off an EPIC HALLOWEEN. 

Their pizzas here are consistantly good (based on our temporary roomates reports) and never fall short of perfect. There was no shortage of staff to help the patrons and answer the phones as well.

The dining area was small and casual, with lots of eye candy to browse around and look at. In other words there was nothing fancy about it, except the orgasmic pizza and the screamin' Greek Salad! :) The staff was exceptionally nice as well!",UqkrP5O2ToeXRcYbp7okIA,8,6,5,4L299fkEajKu5_VgIHqYQQ

4826410,2017-11-27,2,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"This place advertises it is the ""Home of the 30"" pizza"".  Although it will feed a hungry family, and does taste really, really, REALLY good, I'd hope the owner reads this review and decides to market this place on something other than a giant pizza: the ""Chicago Deep Dish Stuffed"" Pizza.

It's on the menu, buried at the bottom of the pizza menu, just above the cold sandwich menu.  It's slightly highlighted, stating ""14"" for $21.99!"", but you'd miss it if you weren't looking for it.

But you won't miss it my trusty Yelp follower, because I'm here to tell you it is on the menu, and you should try it. Wait, change that, you MUST try it.

Take it from someone who's eaten at Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, Uno's and Gino's in Chicago (I'm pretty sure that's the ""Big 4"" and those who all claim to have invented the Chicago Deep Dish); this is the BEST DEEP DISH you can get outside the Chicago area.  Since we're in Vegas, I'd even say I'd put money on that statement.  Go ahead and try it, then come back here and disagree with me.

Since I was here, feeding a family of 13, I also ordered the #10 $30.99 (16"" Pizza with 1 topping, 10 Chicken Fingers, 2 liter soda and added fries for $1.00 more).  The ""regular"" pizza was a little better than any pizza you can get, anywhere else.  The garlic Parmesan chicken fingers were really good (crunchy on the outside, juicy in the inside, with just the right amount of seasoning).  The kids devoured the plate of fries, which had a batter or seasoning on them which gave them a flourly texture (very good).  

The service was top notch!  Our waitress was so kind and understanding.  She took care of a table which primarily consisted of children under age 6 like a pro.  

I rarely do this, but I went up to the counter to tell our waitress this was the BEST Chicago Deep Dish pizza I've had outside Chicago, and she humbly accepted the compliment.  She thanked me over and over again for saying so and asked me to please, make sure I told everyone I knew about it.  I intend to keep that promise, starting here.

So if you're in Vegas, stop by Napoli's (they've got three locations and another coming soon), and try the deep dish.  You'll be glad you did, and you'll feel cool about saying ""Yeah, I've been eating the deep dish since before they were famous for it"".",bmOuwh_dy0n3GIccYJpZ5g,4,3,5,b1WVf0spYFoSclL5W9TK2w

5033844,2010-09-26,0,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"I've been living in Las Vegas for a little over three years, but am originally from NYC (born and bred). I had tried to find pizza that I liked out here and had no luck. Dominos, Pizza Hut, etc. are what they are, but it isn't ""real"" pizza. The independent pizzerias in my neighborhood are crap too; I had given up on finding the perfect pie and began focusing on all the other good food out here (In-n-Out, anyone?) that I couldn't get back East. 

One day a coworker bought lunch for the office. Lo and behold, the perfect sausage (real, Italian sausage in slices, not that crumbled garbage) and mushroom NY-style pie! I found out it came from Napoli's and have been hooked ever since. 

Take it from a real, live NYC pizza snob--this is the best you will find in Las Vegas. It isn't perfect, but if you've lived here long enough, you've probably forgotten what good pizza tastes like anyway. Give it a shot; go pick up a 16"" pepperoni for just $7.99. The best part is that they recently opened a third store on Nellis, right near me. This is important; now I don't have to drive all the way to the West side and get home with a lukewarm pizza. Score! 

Napoli's has an extensive menu. I have not tried even a fraction of their offerings, but aside from their delicious pizza, they have great eggplant parm and amazing, fresh-made cannoli (they make them to order--no soggy shell). I could live with or without their chicken fingers, but they're not half bad. They make a damn good Stromboli too. The pizza is definitely the star of the show, but it's worth checking out some of their other offerings if you're in the mood for something different.

5090440,2011-02-06,1,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"This was my first and last time ordering from Napoli's pizza.  We ordered Mozz Sticks, Eggplant Parm Sandwich w/ Fries, and Chocolate Cake.  

Pros - It WAS Super Bowl Sunday and we still received our order in under an hour.

Cons - everything else.  Even though my order was delivered within an hour, it tasted like it had probably been done a good 45mins before I got it (I live no more than 15mins away).  The Mozz sticks were solid...like they were cooked and sat for so long they got cold and were just solid sticks of cheese covered in breading.  When I ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich I asked them to add Ricotta cheese, I didn't see or taste any.  While the sauce was good, there wasn't nearly enough of it.  There was no sauce on the bread, so the eggplant was very dry, only a thin layer of sauce on top.  In addition to that, the eggplant wasn't cooked very well, I couldn't chew through most of it.  Then the chocolate cake - it was terrible.  It was dry and just didn't taste very good.

Like I said, my FIRST AND LAST time ordering from this pizzeria.",rg9BnWtWbEusg8GBnS8JsQ,1,0,2,sPEm5VLJbVC_b22jW5U5WQ

5127013,2011-07-02,0,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"So I ordered a Sicilian pie from Napoli. My advice is to avoid it. You're better off with a regular pie. I also discovered if you want it to be a good pie, you need to order it slightly well or well. I don't know if it's the ovens Napoli uses or the crappy dough, but ordering it Well makes it better. Traditional pizza dough in a traditional brick oven doesn't need to be ordered well to be good, but this pizza does. When you order their pizza regular, the crust is mush and the bottom of the slice is white as can be. For the uninformed, pizza is supposed to be golden brown to brown on the bottom. Anything less and it's undercooked or practically raw. I kinda find it ridiculous that so many pizzerias find that concept so difficult. Usually, inferior Conveyor Air Ovens are the culprit. They may cook a pizza quicker, but they will never compare to a brick oven. Hope this helps some of you.  After a few more times ordering, I still in good conscience can only rate this place 3 stars.",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,3,1,3,lXHlayCizLc5vZXtjmz5xw

5251321,2014-06-04,0,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"OK, I've been ordering regularly from Napoli for a few years now, and it's about time everyone knew about this place. 

Starting with the pizza...quite good, not great. Maybe a 7 out of 10, but well worth the carryout special price of $7.99 for a large 1-topping. Fed 3 generations with 3 of them last night for just a shade over $25.

So why should you go here? Allow me to continue...

I work in a local hospital. We have a pizzeria a block away, and we order lunch from this place, about 1.5 miles away. They have a ton of lunch specials at $7.99 (M-F 9am-3pm) that blow away anyone else's alleged specials. In particular: a hot pastrami and cheese hoagie with lots of both and dee-licious! And did I mention a ton of fries and a drink as well? Don't want a sandwich? They have 7 different HUGE salads in their specials. My favorite is the blackened chicken. I like the vinaigrette dressing with it.

Now, for the best part...the WINGS! I'm from the east coast and am very particular about my chicken wings. My opinion: this is the only place in town that gets it right! Huge wings, not those little pigeon wings most places serve. My choice is the hot, and they're perfect! Best combo of fire and flavor I've had since coming out west. We split a half-bucket (20 wings), add fries for a buck, and it comes to $14.99! Best wing deal in town! Look, you wanna split a pitcher and watch 6 games at once in a crowded bar, by all means go to BW3. You want wings, you get them here!

Small place, limited seating (at least at the Sahara/Decatur store), pretty much like a classic small family operation. And a correction to a previous review: they're not Russian, they're from Moldova.

To sum up: GO, GO, GO!!!",5gGMfEiTpZaAGlpRcvCM4w,0,0,4,4fIqFVTSOb334-36mbv8gg

Besides the food being mediocre, their customer service could really use some work. The woman who took my order over the phone was not helpful, difficult to understand as well as having a hard time understanding me, and to be honest she was kind of rude. We ordered a Chicken Parm sub and a Chicken Cacciatore dinner. She said our order wouldn't be here for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, which is absurd since their menu states ""fast delivery."" We almost cancelled but decided to give them a try anyway. Well the delivery man had the most difficult time EVER finding my apartment, I understand that complexes can be confusing, but he called me multiple times and I kept telling him to just go back to the front and I would direct him to my apartment but he like refused to do that, I don't know if he couldn't understand me or what, he was difficult to understand as well. I put it on speaker and my boyfriend thought he heard him tell me to come meet him at the leasing office, lol. I'm pretty sure the whole point of paying extra for delivery is to have the food come to me. Anyway! When he finally arrived I handed him a tip and he didn't say thank you and told me he needed my credit card and ID, but I had already payed the woman with my card over the phone. So I got it and he took an IMPRINT of my card which is totally not ok! Anyway, our bill was much more than expected because we must have an old menu or something, the prices we were charged were way higher than the prices on the delivery menu. Boyfriend said his sub was ok, but I tried his fries and they were horrible, rubbery and we didn't even eat all of them. My chicken was pretty good although it was basically just chicken in a pool of marinara with pretty much NO veggies at all. Pasta was decent and garlic bread was horrible.

5683282,2017-08-25,0,xB7bsOpJbnK9nHEZw1ARDg,"This place has such mixed reviews.  They seem to have some consistency and customer service issues.  My experience was pretty indicative of that.  We walked in late afternoon on a Friday.  They weren't too busy.  Staff was very friendly and welcoming.  The girl who took our order was nice.  Told her about my allergies and ordered a tuna avocado sandwich on wheat bread (pending there were no nuts or seeds in it) with a side salad. Subbed out the chicken on our Delux pizza for jalapenos instead.  She checked with the kitchen about the wheat bread and said it had oats. I said oats are fine so we will get the wheat bread.

Side salad came out first.  It was fresh and the house vinaigrette is delicious. After that is when the problems started.

Sandwich came out next.  On a WHITE roll. The guy who brought it out offered to take it back but no biggie, we will eat it as is. 

Pizza was delivered to the table. Covered in chicken. NO jalapenos. Sigh. Am I taking crazy pills? Was she just pretending to write down our order the whole time? 

Overall, the food was fresh and delicious so I can't really complain there. The young lady who messed up our order never came back to the table, but the guy who served us the rest of the time was super attentive. Based on my experience and after reading some of these negative reviews, I think they just need to train their staff a little better.",JY8zWgPoaQiFZD5B-0gIfQ,0,0,4,LxmajOkS3bxnorpnX9vmnw

Everyone was asleep, so it went straight to the fridge. The next morning we discover that they didn't even provide the food we ordered (somehow ""Turkey Club with no tomato"" sounds like ""Bruschetta""?!). After complaining and having the customer service person not only interrupt me, but shout OVER me on the phone, they send the driver to pick up the incorrect order and credit my account. We had to wait 30 minutes to check out for the driver to arrive because he demanded that we not leave it at the door for him. Then they don't even credit my account. What a disaster!

I usually order the pick up special, large pizza.

I don't have to go into detail, it was a mild case of food poisoning. I don't like to point fingers and throw the term ""food poisoning"" around lightly, however it had to have come from the pizza I ordered.  It was the only thing I had eaten that evening.  I remember someone pointing out to me a few months ago that they thought they saw this pizza place on an episode of ""Dirty Dining"" on one of the news channels.

I had the pleasure of trying their delicious pizza years back. They used to cater at my college events. I mean c'mon they are known for their 30"" pizza! More than enough to go around and reasonably priced.

You can dine in, order take out or have it delivered. It's not a huge establishment but it's spacious and always clean. They are always courteous and they provide great customer service. They have a wide selection and they have a GLUTEN FREE menu as well.
When you order delivery they are exact with the time! It's great that they don't take as long as other places. The owners/workers actually care!

You must try their bone in wings! I'm not sure how they do it, but they are delicious! Right amount of sauce, spicy but not too spicy, just right. Let's not forget about their garlic balls, mmm.. which you can get for free if you check in!

They have a carry out special, a one topping 16 inch for 8.99, it's actually cheaper than getting a small. It's available at all three locations.

The location is very convenient, it's in a small shopping plaza. If you're out and about near this area and you're hungry.. definitely stop in for a bite!",3ajSADFnm71e_Zcip_igWQ,4,2,4,2nqPFmgsru1N6hU-a9ppkQ
