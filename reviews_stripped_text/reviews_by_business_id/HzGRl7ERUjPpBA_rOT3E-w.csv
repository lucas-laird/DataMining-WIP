Ran by these Chinese guys who don't know how to cook any Hawaiian food at all, barely know any English, and have the worst attitudes. Ordered garlic chicken and they gave me Chicken from a fast food Chinese place. THIS IS NOT HOW GARLIC CHICKEN IS MADE FROM ANY OTHER L&L OR EVEN A SINGLE HAWAIIAN PLACE AT ALL!! the chicken was undercooked, not even crispy. Pretty much close to raw. Flavorless 

Anyways. I was trying to be nice. Tasted the food, tasted like pure garbage. I literally had a small bite of a piece of chicken and it almost made me wanna spit it out right away. Finally. Asked the workers to give me a refund and HAD TO GO THROUGH AN ARGUMENT JUST TO GET 5 or 6 dollars back. He gave me the nastiest face And guess what? To top that off, the guy threw the money at me. Complete garbage food and garbage employees who work there. Would wish this place gets closed down so no one else has to suffer.",netMp6zLGfu1jevTivoaTQ,1,1,1,1fjRa0uYzsxHKnfaPDm8kg

I ordered the short ribs regular size. First off the short rib was disgustingly fatty and normally in short rib there is separation between the meat. Here there was none. The meat I did manage to find was extremely rubbery and I had to chew for a very long time to be able to swallow it. For $15 with no drink I would expect a decent meal as I could get a good meal anywhere else for that price. I only ate half the meal before I was too disgusted to continue. The rice was decent as was the mac salad, also the cashier was somewhat nice and thats the only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one.

It can also be quick, if you order something easy to prep like the mini laulau plate. Probably just a quick toss in the steamer or microwave and that ti leaf bundle of luau leaves, pork and salted fish is hot and ready to roll (I got my order in minutes, ahead of the group that ordered in front of me).  

I usually forget to ask for substitutions of brown rice and green salad, so I end up picking at the glutinous white rice and mac salad, but anyway it's primarily the protein I'm after.  Plus, the laulau satisfies my dietary need.

The day I visited, there were a couple of tables open in the modest dining area and as far as cleanliness goes, it was okay.  I would love to have received some genuinely friendly counter service, but didn't.  In reality, the cashiers at L&L locations are usually more accustomed to obtaining a quick food order and ringing it up, than providing patrons with a stellar customer experience--that's just how it goes.

That being said, it's an average kind of plate lunch place--adequate for a quick meal, selected from a diverse menu.

Food ordered was unavailable, they substituted it with another item. That's fine. However, it was assumed I wanted white rice and macaroni salad. I asked later about it and he sighs and tells me it's extra for brown rice and salad instead of macaroni. Although, I heard him giving others after me the option, and the menu states you have a choice with no other explanation of price difference.

This one is located in the same plaza at the South Premium Outlets outside where all the other food establishments are. It's located next to Five Guys Burgers and Tropical Smoothie Cafe. There are only about 10 tables so seating can get limited. The restaurant was clean despite all the people that were there. I ordered my food to go since I was going to eat it at work. I noticed other people were waiting for their food as well, but I ended up getting my food before theirs. Maybe they made mine first since it was a to-go order? Who knows, but I hate when I go to a restaurant and I see other people getting their food before me when I ordered first. 

Food wise, not so good. I ordered the mini kalbi rib plate. It was a lot of food for a mini plate. It came with 3 ribs, one scoop of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. The meat was so flavorless. Good kalbi ribs don't need to be dipped in any sauce. I had to pour the sauce all over the meat for it to taste like something. The meat was super tough as well. I had to chew it for a good minute for me to be able to swallow it down. The macaroni salad had so much mayonnaise that I couldn't finish that either.

#1 we had 3 kids with us and they were playing music talking about f@cking. Wth? Ghetto! I thought L&L plays hawaiian music. I dont mind different music but to play explicit music in a family restaurant is unacceptable. 
#2 i dont mind that he needed a smoke break but to come back inside mid smoking to pass out food to customers not washing hands. Eww grose.  Not once but twice.
#3 again with scratching his head, not washing hands going back to hand food to customers.
#4 i think the old guys knew we were pissed cuz they made us free malasadas. The cashier brought it out to us but practically threw it at my brother saying, ""here it's free"" and walked away.

Dont think we will be going back. This guy is unsanitary with really bad customer service. By the other reviews I've read... You shouldn't go to this place either.

I got the BBQ combo plate with beef, short ribs, and I substituted the BBQ chicken with chicken katsu curry. The meal was huge and everything was cooked well. After living in Hawaii for close to four years, this place brought back memories of all of the good local food you used to eat back in the day.

I like that they had the usual, as well as the healthier options! I had the grilled chicken plate with brown rice + greens. It came with 2 packets of ranch dressing + a container of sauce on the side.

We ordered the following:
- Healthy Garlic Shrimp

Their tables haven't been wiped out , they're dirty probably since they opened. The trash bin on the floor is over filled with trash , the chairs all out of place.
