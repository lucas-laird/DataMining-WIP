I have had two bad experiences in a row, last time I ordered an all American burger but  they rang me up for the ""havarti"" burger. When I told her that was incorrect she told me she would fix it at the window which makes no sense cuz by the time I get to the window it's probably already made after at the window to please make sure it was correct because I do not like grilled onions and instead she gave me an All-American with no onions!


Now let's get to this visit, I get to the speaker she took my order correctly, then tells me she'll have my total at the window (completely understandable) until I get up there and she makes no eye contact with me, barks out the total to me, doesn't say hello, doesnt ask me how my day was, nothing. Once I give her the money she hands me my food doesn't say another word to me even when she was giving me my change she didn't count it back she just threw it in my hand! You guys have to do better with hiring because your day crew is going to ruin your business ! 
you're night crew on the other hand is awesome!
2 stars for getting my order right

4086847,2015-05-06,1,-LMycE26AortJDsbc8oXOg,"Having lived nearby for nearly 15 years - I have obviously been to this location numerous times. In the past, sure there has been the occasional error on an order or whatever but i have never felt the inspiration to review this place as it was as expected.  

However, current events cause for a current review.  I'm a drive-thru person when it comes to my dynamic of patronage here. Lately, I have discovered smoothies and last week, I order a smoothie and after waiting three cars for my turn to the window they tell me the smoothie machine is down.  Man, that sucks.  Tell me when I'm ordering and not after waiting 10 minutes and then informing me and sending me on my way empty stomached. Ok, so I try again Monday and viola, scored one it was good and left me feeling positive about my smoothie groove.  Tried again today, trying to squeeze it in but running late for work and what happens?  I place my order and wait in the line for ten minutes and when I get to the window, I am informed the machine is not ready for smoothies and again am sent on my way. I'm late for work with no smoothie to comfort me!  

Now, I would have been late due to my stopping in had the smoothie transaction been successful - but I would have a smoothie to counterbalance the effect.  All we need here is a little training at order taking to know smoothie status. If you don't have smoothies available, then say sonar time of order so I can back out before I am trapped and spend ten minutes waiting in the drive thru and nothing to profit from it.

My husband was amazed at how good his burger was. The bacon was really crispy, and the vegetables were nice and cold. 
I should have paid more attention to the names of the young men who took our orders. I believe that on both visits the shift manager/supervisor took our order. One man had dark hair, and the second was Justin(Dustin?...sorry). Both men were extremely polite and genuinely happy people. The food was presented nicely, and tasted great.

4287386,2014-01-05,3,-LMycE26AortJDsbc8oXOg,"Sooo I really am not a huge fan of the food here, maybe their breakfast sandwich on sourdough is ok, but other than that its whatevs. What I come here for is their ICED COFFEE!!! It is seriously some of the best iced coffee I have ever had! I'm a frequent Starbucks, Mcd's, and even BK iced coffee drinker, but the one here is seriously the tits!

The Original flavor of coffee is vanilla they also have Mocha, but I've only have orig. They have a sweetened cream, which hands down blows this coffee out the park. Starbucks adds cream, but its super lacking. I like my coffee to be super light and creamy looking at boy they do it here.

They have your typical fast food, but here they pepper their meat a little too much imo. I like my meat juicy and thick sans pepper!

Their curly fries are decent, and regular fries arent hella greasy.

If I was only rating the iced coffee that would hands down get 5 stars. The price is a little steep, well, for IC. 1.99 for a 16oz and 2.89 for 24oz.
