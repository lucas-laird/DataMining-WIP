I am a simple guy when it comes to food and the food I've eaten there has always been excellient.  I love it.  Honestly, probably my favorite place to go in Vegas for food.  I love the enchilladas, they are simple and delicious.  Not full of random ingredients where the cooks are just trying to make them more exotic.  Simple, and great.  

I think with Mexican food, people probably would think it is too simple, so that's why I say I'm bias.  

I give it a 4 because I don't know if I have ever come across a good server there, waitress, waiter, anything.  They are normally pretty bad.  And I And I know how bias I am to the food, so I automatically took down the 1 star to be fair.",utEbZHYFHWCSM3_-9K7Smw,0,0,4,VGESiMXfy0-amLEUBfTlaA

I've gone here for my craving of Made to Order Guacamole. They are very inconsistant.  Sometimes, the diced tomatoes and avocado look old, so I'm always taking a chance.  They're very cincy with the tortilla chips that come with the guac, so don't be afraid to ask for more.  I've tried their Tequila Shrimp and thought it had a weird after taste and the shrimp was too rubbery.  I've had the 3 item combo, try to order something other than the taquitos with your combo because they are small.  Chips and salsa with refried beans are tasty. When ordering the nachos, ask for the refried beans on the side because they put a big heap of it.  You want to taste the cheese and meat but they smother it with beans to be cheap.  

Their breakfast specials are inexpensive and I liked the breakfast quesadilla without the egg.",f5IFcFHro5_fgXDFTs6khg,0,1,3,C5mNYvBjZN4N_fZVYVd1dQ

Ordered some Margaritas for the wife and myself. Frozen Raz for her and On the rocks for me. Those both came out good. (though i had to pour my shot in myself which i thought was weird)

For Food she wanted to order 3 different Tamales, which led to a bit of disappointment as the server said the only ones they had tonight were shredded beef. She got 3 of those then. I ordered the Tacos Tijuana off the specialty plate. Taste wise both were good, though both of us liked mine better. For the kids we ordered one grilled cheese, which was pretty sad actually for $5.99. Decent size, just cheese was barely melted and hardly toasted for the bread. (though i dunno how much i can fault a Mexican place for a poor grilled cheese). 

The kids menu also came with an ice cream, which server was nice enough to bring out one for each kid even though we only ordered one. That upped her tip a bit for sure. 

All in all this place would have gotten a solid four stars for taste and service, but had to deduct one for only one choice of Tamale.",x16Fl_5h9aX4tn38kKSGHw,0,0,3,z1rm9HHCU4qU09WeCFxMPg

SuperMex is a reliable standard of good food quality.  If you're hunting for really authentic wonderful Mexican cuisine, this might not be the spot, but for a great guacamole and Mexican pizza, they always deliver.  And several other menu items are just good 'ol SW Mexican dishes.

The place is open 24hr and the food is consistently decent for the price and the portion. They also serve fresh in house made tortillas like most Mexican places do these days.

I visited this location on a friends recommendation and because I had a coupon and I also wanted some home style Mexican food and not some del taco. The location was semi hard to find since its kinda of not visible from the 215 exit but once you know its right next to the gas station you cant miss it.

The restaurant itself is clean and very roomy they offer booths and table seating. Their menu offers some pretty standard Mexican dish's with good explications of what you will receive. If you are unsure about portions ask the server and they will be happy to tell you portion sizes. Once we took out booth and ordered our drinks the complimentary chips and salsa came out fresh and tasty. After a short wait of maybe 5-10 minutes all of our food came out. The portions where exactly as explained by the server so it was no surprise there. Overall the food here is good and not overly greasy like a lot of Mexican food can be. I would recommend it to anyone craving some sit down food any time of the day. Last time I visited I noticed they have a lunch special menu as well which is very reasonably priced.

I usually end up orders the SuperMex Burrito covered in read sauce. Its a kinda big burrito but if you can eat a lot like me I would give it a go!",LrqHY2HzP9yAFrbR__vi4w,2,1,4,prSi1nDMVtu6lkaIQI8w8g

I stopped in for dinner last week with my Dad, and we sat down in the dining area (non-smoking). Very quickly, the room started to smell like someone was smoking weed. Of course, I pretended to not know what the smell was, but my Dad caught my lie. That turned into an awkward dinner conversation. Oh well.

The server was very kind and offered to move us to the bar area, without us asking.

In any case....when you are seated, you get a nice plate of chips, salsa, and bean dip.

The food is quite good. Lots of options. There is a ""healthy"" menu, as well as a ""seniors"" menu. 

I opted for the Chicken Sarandeado. A grilled chicken breast that was nicely seasoned, served with tortillas, rice, beans and pico. 

Nothing about this place stands out as life-changing, but this place is A-Ok and I would come back because the service was good, the food was good, and atmosphere was fun.

Chips and salsa never disappoint and they are served with some yummy beans as well. I did noticed, however, that they updated their menu (not updated on their website yet) and I decided to try one of the new items. They have a new taco platter that you can get either as an appetizer or as an entree. Getting it as an entree means you get a side of rice and beans and two tacos. HOLY CRAP THESE TACOS WERE AWESOME! They give you a choice of either chicken or steak and I asked if I could do one chicken and one steak and they said yes. So out comes our tacos and they were topped with chorizo and some crumbled queso fresco. Was I in the same place I came before?? The quality of the food was great and nothing like the rubbery little pieces I was served before. Rice and beans were good too. I want to come back and try the other new menu items they have.

I like the green rice and boiled whole pinto beans. It's a lighter option to the standard sides of beans and rice offered at most Mexican restaurants. I don't usually order appetizers here. The entree portions are large and they bring out some really yummy chips and salsa to start making the apps unnecessary. The fajitas are large enough to share or take home and reheat for lunch the next day. They offer a nice selection of Mexican beers on tap.

2613975,2012-08-26,0,GKCX2DlxkbwY2DUu44u4rA,"I was so excited to try this place because of its close proximity to my casa & they have a Groupon this week! Duh. When I saw someone's picture of a Mexican Pizza, I was sold. The chips & salsa were decent (especially considering their free-ness), but everything else was very sub-par compared to other Mexican restaurants. I let my husband handle the ordering because he always complains about the ""weird"" stuff I order, so we got the Mexican pizza & surprisingly, you can choose the protein that goes inside! He chose the shredded beef since I've seen many good reviews for it, as well as the huge Super Mex carnitas burrito. 

When I was a kid, I used to LOVE the Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell. I thought it was the best thing ever, so crispy & fatty & what not. The Mexican pizza looked great, until I tried to get a piece. It was so soggy I had to use two forks to pick it up and we all had to eat it with a knife & fork because we couldn't pick it up like the Mexican pizza of my childhood. In hind sight, I think that the shredded beef may not have been the best choice to go on a Mexican pizza because it's usually swimming in juice right before they ladel it. I MAY try this again with steak next time (if there is one), or just something that's not so watery. Another problem I had with it was that some of the chunks of shredded beef were WAY too big. I had one that was 2in. x 2in. Who wants a piece of beef that huge in a fallen apart Mexican pizza? Not me! I want my beef actually shredded thanks, not the cow delivered to me to shred. 

The carnitas burrito was pretty gross. My favorite carnitas is from the Amigos Tacos, not far from here, but this carnitas was shredded, dry, and chewy. Wamp. They also put crappy iceberg lettuce in their burritos which I should have read and asked for them to exclude. I think iceberg lettuce has a crappy flavor when combined with Mexican food because it tastes so bitter. They just don't go together. So, bill pre-Groupon was $22. Not bad considering the amount of food we got. We actually brought home the majority of the burrito which is surprising because I'm usually a food disposal and I never had left overs, but unfortunately, I didn't think any of this food was worth the calories so I didn't do my standard over-eating. Hey, I guess this place is great if you're on a diet, because you won't have too much that's edible and enjoyable.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,1,0,2,DdxsAya1I_EvN2V5HqTWBw

Lettuce Wraps with Chicken
Shredded dark meat chicken and leafs of lettuce. That is it. The chicken wasn't that bad but it definitely wasn't healthy. The lettuce was old and wilted, I had to throw it out.

Whole Wheat Quesadilla with Chicken
Whole wheat tortilla with shredded chicken and low fat cheese. It didn't taste healthy, but it didn't taste good either. Really greasy. Probably the best out of what we ordered.

2 Low Carb Tacos-1 Chicken and 1 Beef
Same chicken as before. The tortilla was supposedly low carb, it was hard to tell how it tasted because it was soaked in grease.
The beef was inedible! Mushy, super salty, I couldn't put my finger on the taste, but I almost threw up. We threw it away. 

The lettuce wraps and taco combo came with a side of veggies of mushrooms, onions, and zucchini. The onions were pretty good, like they were pickled in vinegar. We didn't eat the other veggies because they had been cooked in either oil or butter.

We ended up with something that looked like a tostada, we didn't order it. The chicken on it was chunks of white breast meat, it tasted pretty good. That chicken seemed healthier than the shredded.

Instead of chips and salsa, they bring you a nice basket of fried tortillas and bean dip with a small bowl of a little spicy salsa.  You break the tortillas as you want and dip.  

I ordered the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla soup.  It was a tomato based soup with lots of cheese and real chicken with nice tortilla strips.  It was a thicker soup-quite flavorful and something I'd get again.  A bowl of this soup in the winter would be great!

For my main course, I got the Chicken Sarandeado, a grilled chicken breast with their ""special spices.""  With the platter came rice, pico, some guacamole, and refried beans.  This was another tasty dish for Super Mex.  

For dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  It didn't appear as if this ice cream had ever been near a fryer but it was good.  It was simply a ball of vanilla ice cream that had been rolled in a small amount of coating and then frozen.  It was placed in a sweetened tortilla basket and decorated with whipped cream, and some strawberry and chocolate syrup.  Mind you, it was a decadent ending to my meal, but it was not fried as far as I could tell.

I was tempted to give the place 4 stars but I had one BIG hangup with the service.  For the most part, it was very good.  However, I had just started to eat my soup when a server appeared with my main course and set it down.  Why do you do this?  It seems to happen more in Tex-Mex places than anywhere else.  Cabo at Red Rock was notorious for this.  Can't they do courses like a normal restaurant?",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,2,3,7Sm57ocMbzvI3qcGtf_86g

Two big Wows,  really delicious and a take-home bag of left-overs. Be warned though,  if you sit in the bar you may encounter smokers.

I claimed that no 24 hour establishment could possibly serve good mexican food.  And I was totally ignorant of your Super Super happy hour.

I have seen the error of my ways.

Happy hour is 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. (Think it's only good in the bar area)  We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and friendly.  I ordered the Tacos Tijuana appetizer.  Three tacos with char-grilled chicken and spicy chorizo.  Very good and well worth the $3.95 happy hour price.

The chips and salsa was just okay.  Usually mediocre chips and salsa would cause me to look elsewhere for my mexican fix.  But $2 margaritas and 1/2 appetizers will keep me coming back for more Super Mex happy hour.

Service was OK. Nothing to rave about. 

My son and I shared the Flautas & Chimichangas. I wish there was more meat than wrap on the Chimichangas. The wrap was so thick that it didn't cook all the way through and became uber chewy and to top it off it was GREASY. I don't really know anyone that likes to have to tilt their plate so to gather the grease on one side so not to make my food soggy... Anyone out there? 

My husband enjoyed his Fajitas and even mentioned that the price was pretty good considering what the norm for the dish is.

The restaurant is split up into two sections - dining in establishment on the left, bar area o the right.  

They start you off with tortilla chips, salsa, and a bean dip while they get your drink orders in.

The Husband ordered the Mexican Pizza (Large $10.45).  It's your choice of protein with all the standard fixings of Mexican food piled onto a crispy tortilla.  

I went for the Combination Plate (3 Items for $9.95), and chose an 
enchilada, tamale, and soft taco.  For the most part, you can choose your own filling (a few cost extra) and sauce on them.  With it, you get rice and beans.  

When the order came out, we thought they were both pretty generous.  Unfortunately for me, the requested low-fat green cilantro rice and low-fat boiled pinto beans were not replacing the red rice and refried beans I had asked for.  The waiter immediately took it back and they fixed the problem.  (Not sure if it was the waiter's fault or the kitchen's fault, but it was done quickly without too much drama.)

My enchilada and tamale were both tasty, although the chicken soft taco was a bit dry.  That was probably my least favorite part of the dish.  It made for good leftovers the next day.

They also have a Lite Menu, specials for those 60 years and older, gaming promos, and more.

Service was fine. It wasn't too busy on a weekday for lunch, so no real problems there.

Overall, it's a decent place for lunch when you want some Mexican food.  It helps when you find those BOGO coupons that come along though!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,6,3,JYP2Wzi5R0q5no5Ah_VryA

When I got the bill I saw they charged  .70 cents for extra tortillas.  They said it was the Managers decision to charge for additional tortillas. I know .70 cents but it's the principal.  The guacamole that came with condiment plate for the fajitas was tasteless. Processed store bought slime,  Makes my stomach queasy just thinking about it.   The chicken rice bowl was decent.  Had to flag a waitress down every time we needed something and they were not short on help and were not busy.  Overall unfriendly service.

The people in the booth next to us arrived after us and got their food first.  They had 5 people and we had 2.

But man - the food actually seems like it is homemade and by someone that cares.  I'm not an expert on authentic Mexican, but I know what tastes good.  Normally the chips and salsa are the worst part of the meal, but they fry up entire corn tortillas and serve them to you as chips that way, as it makes it easier to keep track how many massive calories you ingested before your actual meal.  And the salsa - we literally inhaled it.  

Tried a variety of dishes (we had 4 people eating) and everything was solid - my only complaint was the tamales - they are beef only and the masa on the outside wasn't my favorite.  But because they are so close to my house, open 24/7 and it was a severely cheap dinner (about 40 bucks for 4 people) makes it a 5 star establishment to me.

Props go to the carnitas here -  these were so flavorful with crispy ends that I prefer it to Phat Phranks.  Double props goes to their huge ""lite"" menu.  Lots of offerings with whole wheat tortillas, low fat cheese, low calorie pinto beans and low calorie cilantro rice.  And for the low carbers, they will pretty much lettuce wrap anything you want and have a lot of ""burrito bowls"" with pretty much any protein and sauce and veggies you want.

I ordered my combination plate and chose three shredded beef tacos rice and beans as they have the best tacos in town...PERIOD!

The ex-hubsters ordered one of their famous burritos, so full of flavor and delicious marinated meat. HUGE! For the first time in his life he could not clean his plate! Amazing all in itself!

Mom ordered one of their new specials enchilada, rice and beans.

My precious nephew had the children's menu selection, chicken strips/fries.  Nothing special just frozen and fried up, I sure hope he acquires his flavor for Mexican soon! Then he can really enjoy this restaurant! Children's menu items include drink and dessert.

As always the food was hot and delicious as well as reasonable!

I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, but was appalled at the sad wilted lettuce that they had the nerve to put on my plate. I didn't bother asking for a replacement of the lettuce, since I was already grossed out by the soggy greens that were there. I'm shocked that anyone would even bother placing them there to begin with. I'd rather they just tell me they ran out of lettuce than putting that gross stuff on my place. I pushed them to the side and concentrated on the shredded chicken and salsa. The chicken was beyond dry and flavorless. The salsa did little to help that either. My fella got the carne asada meal and although he was relatively happy with his meal, he found the meat to be a little flavorless as well. He thoroughly enjoyed their salsa, so that was the only plus of the meal.
