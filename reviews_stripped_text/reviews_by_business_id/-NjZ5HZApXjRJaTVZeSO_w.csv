The server, .a female that's always there, wasn't very attentive either. If you're looking for some good authentic food, and are patient then you will like the place. Their food was delicious.

Try to have the patience to let them cool so you can consume them without burning your fingertips and tongue, but if you can't, I understand.

Tiny restaurant is situated in a busy lot, but the cozy interior and friendly staff more than make up for any minor parking inconveniences. Prices are low, food is fresh. Fellow diners recommend the soups and grilled meats (specifically the steak/shrimp plates?), similar to other centro-Americo style spots.

But the pupusas are the best thing here, and the revueltas are the best of them. A tiny bit greasy, but thick with filling and such great flavor. I'm tempted to go get some right now...",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,12,4,6vx28G5Ch2fkxUvR1pkNHQ

A very humble waiter walks up and greets us with a direct smile as if he knows this is our first time but will not be our last. We are seating in the booth in this small family owned business. We order a modeling and Budweiser which feels stronger than usual. I order caldo de pata ( cow foot soup) empanadas de carne and empanadas de platano. 

Whilst we sit and wait you can smell the spices boiling and the cooks singing. Any place there's singing and stirring there's love on each bowl. The waiter comes with the food... excuse me while I wipe my tears. Firstly the food is placed well with perfect serving amounts. Piping hot soup when it's 112 outside! Why not!! 


Well the carrots are beautiful corn yellow/good and cabbage steamed lovely. The broth on this soup opening every organ in my entire body.  As I take some of the gelatinous fat if the cow foot with the broth and put in my mouth..........I believe my husband has never made me fell this good! No I mean it!!  They are cooking their ass off in this place!! There should be a law against the feeling I'm getting from this bowl of cow foot soup!! 


You know what I can't take it.. I need to eat this is seclusion! Waiter bag me up and let me out of here!! We need to be alone!!!

2228489,2018-06-29,1,-NjZ5HZApXjRJaTVZeSO_w,"I still love this dive of a restaurant. It was one of me and my husband's first dates when we were still just friends. Cheap eats, lots of carbs and cheese, what's not to like? We always get the pupusas. At about $2 each, i usually get 2 or 3 depending on how hungry i am. I'm a piggy, and they are big, plan accordingly. I always ask for extra curtido too and they don't charge extra for it.

The staff is friendly, but their English is hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get one that speaks perfect English, other times they speak less English than i speak Spanish. I know enough to get by; they've not messed up my order yet. If all else fails, point and smile.

Pupusas do take a while to cook tho, so be patient. And sometimes they run out of certain fillings. They are all yummy. I still can't decide which is my favorite between the chicharone/cheese, pork/cheese, loroco, flor de calabaza, or pork/beans.

The hot sauce they serve in the red bottle isn't hot at all, so if you want hot, there's Tapatio or Cholula (my fave) on the table.

Hours posted say they are open till 8pm but i was there once and they locked the doors at 7:30 so don't be late.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,2,2,5,RmdpMmfOOXYI0lf_XEVq9Q
2282197,2016-03-21,0,-NjZ5HZApXjRJaTVZeSO_w,"Disappointing. While authentic Salvadorian food, this place does not provide any unique flavors, taste or even good quality food. Tamales are fried instead of boiled and have a weird aftertaste of old food (definitely not what you'd expect from fresh Elote). Pupusas while filled generously are way too thick and the dough is not fully cooked. Way too oily. Perhaps because the pan wasn't hot enough.

Walked in and it looked like they were preparing a catering order in kitchen.  Uuuuh hello?  anybody there?  I'm hungerz....

Restaurant feel reminds me of my grandparents' old kitchen in Oakland with the kitchen sounds, some kind of fan blowing, sounds of people talking, TV on 
(except in my grandparents house they didn't speak Spanish).  It's a comfy food environment.

Cool stuff: TVs, super mini grocery and snacks on corner shelves.  Pupusas are only $0.99 !!! But ask which ones.  Also their Tamarind agua fresca is really good; not sour.

Didn't see sopas de pollo on the menu.  I was hoping to have some.  There is seafood, beef and pata sopas.  

I went with the Pollo de Crema plate.  It came with 2 cheese pupusas.  But my food plate wasn't exactly hot, especially the chicken.  The flavor was still good, and I liked the cream sauce.  It had green bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes.  Comes with salad, rice, and beans.  My only wish was the food - chicken and all - was hot.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,25,21,3,gPJ5SM7Y78k29hAsnJmgyw

I love hole in the wall authentic places and this was one of them. Lots of choices to choose from on a easy to read menu (translations for each item). The interior of the small restaurant has a shelf filled with snacks for sale.
 
We ordered Mix Seafood soup $12.95, Pupusas with pork and cheese and 
Churrasco with eggs and shrimps $13.95. They were very flavorful and broth of the seafood soup is amazing. A plate of pupusa came with the meal.

The pupusa, a cornmeal patty that is a Salvadorian standard was quite tasty. There is also a cup of slaw and red sauce which is traditionally used as a topping for the pupusa. Pupusas had also a slightly charred exterior that created a delicious caramelized effect. 

We ordered at the counter, we were not sure if we should grab a table. The food came out in 15 mins and the lady was very nice and attentive. We will surely be back.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,3,1,5,8RTEE7qZaNjWDch3diZt7g

5127634,2014-03-11,2,-NjZ5HZApXjRJaTVZeSO_w,"My husband and I are having a debate about who has better burritos at the corner of Smoke Ranch and Rainbow, he prefers the truck. My vote is San Salvador. I love their chicken burrito without frijoles. I hate beans but their chicken is impeccable. It's slowly stewed and very flavorful with a nice amount of spice. When I get take out here it is always piping hot to the point of almost burning my hands. 

I love their cheese and pork pupusas. San Salvador believes in cheese. I say this because some places give a small sprinkling of cheese, not so here. Everything has plenty of cheese and creme. I don't prefer their carne asada. It lacks a bit of lime and some other qualities but their chicken is spot on. Even their super cheesy chicken quesadilla is a hit with the younger set. 

I wanted to try a torta but I think the server misunderstood me because I received 2 tacos instead. That fine, I was so full from the pupusas and other items that a torta would have been too heavy. I will try one some day. 

Although this place is a hole in the wall they do have good food at a good value. I prefer to walk in and take my food home. Their air conditioning could use a service because it was kind of warm in there and it was only 80 degrees outside. 

San Salvador offers a good selection of beers from domestics like Budweiser to Dos X's.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,2,0,4,scpFc7nFiR2psM4_IpdWMg

I could hear the chefs patting the pupusas together as I sat at my table enjoying my glass bottle of coke. It's true that the staff doesn't really speak English but they are polite, and they make an effort. (I usually find that the food is great at places you have to point at a menu to order.)

In addition to delicious food made to order, you can get random frozen fruits like cashew fruit or nonce from the freezer cabinet next to the cash register. On the other side of the register there is a separate shelving area for interesting snacks and dried goods. But there are 11 booths and 4 tables you can sit at to enjoy your food. My pupusas were delicious! My only criticism is that the slaw wasn't as spicy as I like because there was only 3 rings of jalapeños in it, and I prefer the long cut Serranos...
