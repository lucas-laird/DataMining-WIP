1734,2016-05-04,3,HmsCerK_rub0Ulo0aC0f9A,"Sashimi Salad: OVERPRICED & UNDERWHELMING!!!  I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. 
 After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. 
Most sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10"" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4""x6"". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.",VuQug_nhR6T_kiVIBT2xaA,2,0,1,EpnVOdjDJ_yW5LViaUYC1Q

Probably my favorite place for sushi in the Summerlin area. I've tried them all. As other places tend to lose quality over time, Hanabi has stayed consistent. 

I first came with a large party with coworkers, and the owner was very friendly, hospitable, and available for our questions. The food was so fresh, we couldn't stop eating. They were also very accommodating for vegetarian dietary preferences for some of our group. 

Since then, I've come multiple times and always had a great time. Service has been friendly and fast, and the food has always been perfect.

There were even a few new rolls that I've never heard of like the Coco Shrimp Roll (I believe that's what it's called). 

The Coco Shrimp Roll was super creative (in my opinion), and I would've never thought of having coconut shrimp in a sushi roll (it was a great combination by the way).

The waitress was really nice too. She was really helpful on informing my family and I about the menu. 

Plus the honey toast and green tea ice cream mochi was really awesome.

The only reason this was a four instead of a five star was because a few dishes were just 'okay' in a sense. The sushi, sweets, and service was amazing. But just a FEW of the dishes (hot dishes) were 'okay' nothing too outstanding about them.

Here at Hanabi you can taste the freshness and how exotic there sushi is. It will leave a taste on your taste buds wanting more.

My favorite has become the Coco Salmon roll. Coconut shrimp tempura, cream cheese and cucumber wrapped up in sushi rice and seaweed. They top it with fresh salmon sashimi and that wonderful spicy Japanese mayo. Finally it is topped off with shredded coconut. Can't get enough of this one! The staff is beyond friendly and Andy, the owner takes his time to greet all the customers and take personal pride in the dishes being served. He, himself, was Nobu trained. Any sushi lover knows the quality that entails. Don't forget to try something different here, like the seared pork belly appetizer, or the honey toast dessert. Your palette will thank you over and over again.

The personable owner, Andy, always welcomes and greets the customers and makes sure everything is fine.  The quality and presentation of the food is top notch.

Update 07/27/17

Hey Summerlin Residents. I've been a regular customer at Hanabi for over a year and I have to say the sushi is still super fresh and of high quality. 

The owner, Andy, still takes time to greet all of the customers and is a very friendly guy, as is his entire staff. The restaurant has been updated with the addition of chairs to the wooden benches, making for a comfortable and pleasant dining experience. 

As an added bonus, Hanabi is celebrating its second anniversary with some drink promotions, including buy 1, get 1 House sake and buy 2 beers  and get one free. 

This hidden gem in Summerlin is definitely worth the trip for anyone who likes sushi. There are also many cooked dishes for those not as adventurous. 

Trust me, once you try the food, you will return. Enjoy!",5kQ5OIfwZXvp6YYgZlucRQ,0,0,5,vrcWRt3Y25VkKzrDzNgF9A

1076518,2015-08-02,4,HmsCerK_rub0Ulo0aC0f9A,"Dined on a Saturday evening and this place was dead with only one table occupied. Came based on the very positive reviews and location at Village Square on Sahara is near home.

Service was attentive but wouldn't categorize it as warm and friendly.  We didn't get water refills until the end of the meal and when we finally asked.  Food came out quickly - hot foods hot.

Adults got the AYCE option. Kids opted for a chicken katsu kids meal and ala carte shrimp tempura and salmon sashimi. Sashimi was $11 and seemed spendy for the three pieces. 

Most of the sushi here is pretty mediocre. Not bad, but it's not knock your socks off.  The ""creative"" rolls like The Sunset were unimaginative and just alright.  We got an order of spicy tuna nachos. Guess we should've known based on the menu (see picture), but it was literally a heaping mound of spicy tuna served with something like sriracha mayo and Tostitos Scoops (yes, straight from the bag of Scoops that you would eat with jarred salsa). The spicy in the tuna wasn't even mixed evenly as the bottom of the lump was spicier than the top.

The honey toast is a poor representation of this great Japanese dessert. It was not Japanese bakery bread but a piece of King's Hawaiian sweet roll. The ice cream wasn't vanilla like described. It was more like a yuzu sorbet, but I thought it was better than vanilla ice cream. The sorbet was the best thing we had that night.

One of the tips mentioned the bench seating for each table. Not ideal but it wasn't too bad.

Doubt we'll be back here despite the convenience. There are many other AYCE joints in town to choose from which you'll leave much more satisfied.",ld6Y4P4lntLEgMvVe81-2A,4,3,3,vOVfUvhYgS2Bz_l7g5hRZg

The sweet shrimp was probably old because it was cooked. Usually par cooking is a technique to somewhat hide the fishiness of seafood as it gets old. The sea urchin was horrible. It looked dark and tasted off. Usually it will taste creamy with a lil briney flavor but this was of bad quality. Appetizers were good. They were hot and crispy when expected.

Our server was a young, bubbly woman who despite trying to be pleasant and helpful, rushed us through our AYCE lunches. She kept taking plates away before we were finished and threatening the ""leftover food gets charged"" policy (we had zero leftovers and I was still working on a plate with a couple pieces of sushi that she tried to take away before I was done!!). If you want details or her name please DM me.

The food was mediocre at best. Definitely not sushi to write home about. The tempura squid was not fresh, really the only thing I liked was the tempura shrimp!! I ordered as much sushi as possible (I love raw fish), but it wasn't that fresh. The ikura/salmon roe was a bit slimy in texture and tasted like it had been marinated in some sake or wine to disguise a lack of freshness. For sushi aficionados, any really quality item was off limits according to the menu (uni, amaebi, bluefin tuna, toro, oysters, etc). Dessert was decent (Mochi ice cream and regular ice cream), but there's a one item per person limit. There are plenty of AYCE places in town so I'll keep looking. I wanted to like this place but felt rushed through the meal and had to worry about so many restrictions (one item per person, off limit items, dinner only, etc) and the leftover policy that it did not make the experience enjoyable.

Price: This place is pretty pricey which is expected with sushi, but I paid 16.50 for 6 pieces of sushi it that gives you an example. They do have an all you can eat for 25$

Quality of food: I've been to 16 countries and eaten sushi in about all of them, ifs there's something I know and love its sushi. The sushi here was really sub-par it the rice did not stick at all causing the sushi to fall apart as it's picked up, not allowing you to eat it all together and enjoy it. Both of my orders had this issue. The flavor was as usual but nothing I'd expect with the price. 

Service: The service here is actually really good, its not a big place but still the servers are very attentive and always check in. I believe one of the chefs made a round as well. 

Atmosphere: The atmosphere is is nice, not crowded and has nice design a few TVs up playing sports channels, and seems like a nice friendly place to take the family.

Overall: The place isn't bad it's in a good location and has good service. The price vs the quality is what brings me to 2 stars overall when you go somewhere to eat those are my biggest factors. I'd recommend trying some other sushi place, you're in Vegas and can find amazing sushi anywhere so keep looking and save a few bucks for some good quality sushi!",7WxYsohI8IejEjrlqT011g,0,0,2,MXWi9jIHhxICbxHIgWiY7A

The service was good, it is one of those restaurants with a team serving mentality. All of the servers would check on us and we could order from whomever walked by which was nice. The decor of the restaurant was cute as well.

I had to knock of stars based on the food. I am an avid sushi eater and the quality of the nigiri was mediocre. The salmon nigiri was especially small and thin. The rolls were okay but had limited fish and an abundance of cucumber in them, nothing too great. I do have to say that their unagi was delicious and crispy, but once again small. I ordered honey toast which was an exciting addition to the menu since I've never been to an AYCE that serves that. It was just okay also - it seemed like a hawaiian roll from the market that they drizzled with honey and plopped a vanilla ice cream scoop on.",GMm6VR69VTuFtTVteJkcOg,0,0,2,s-BI0MmGydqKUsuPbarAuw

Ambiance: Great quiet place although if dining with a big party it would not be advisable the area is small so the noise might affect other diners. Definitely a great neighborhood Japanese restaurant.

My previous review from nearly a year ago gave this place 5 stars and in my opinion it was well deserved over several visits. 

I noticed that since last month (October 2016) they began an all day promo for only $19.99 for ayce which is good for lunch and dinner. This promo was extended until Nov so I took a friend here and was hoping it was just as great as it used to be. Unfortunately it wasn't. 

The rice was hard & undercooked. The fish slices were all significantly thinner. The fun Japanese music no longer played and service wasn't as good as it had been before. My favorite item of all is no longer included for ayce (uni) there's now an extra fee of $1 per piece. 

It just isn't the place I remember. Maybe business isn't as good as they expected but with the changes implemented it can't get better for them. I hope they make some changes soon so more people aren't disappointed.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,43,35,3,Vwr39cg-IN-tPoXuBXrdOA

1729407,2015-11-14,11,HmsCerK_rub0Ulo0aC0f9A,"Great AYCE deal! Fish is fresh, dishes are fun, service at the bar was attentive. As other reviews state, the AYCE dinner price is $28, which is slightly higher than the local average. However, quality here is among the best AYCE I've had and the majority of lower-priced businesses in town have significantly lower quality to match.

APPETIZERS: This was our favorite section of the menu. The Jalapeno Popper dish that is commonly found around town was nicely presented here and actually had a good kick of spice for once! Salmon poke had a great spicy chili sauce, both were offset by the seaweed salad. We really enjoyed the grilled mackerel and the soft shell crab, but I did not care for the oysters. The real standout was the Rock N Roll appetizer, which is a riceless roll! 
NIGIRI: Nigiri selection was ample, and fish was typically pretty fresh. The super white tuna, scallop, golden eel, and squid were good options, but I felt the salmon and yellowtail weren't that great and lacked flavor. Rice was an average portion, fish was cut on the thin side.
ROLLS: We tried the Twilight roll and the White Dragon roll, both had several sauces and fishes, both were tempura-shrimp based. I generally try to be more adventurous with my roll picks but by this point I was too full to care. Rolls were solid and they had a lot of new specialty options, but I wish they had more riceless options.

The space was another sushi spot before Hanabi took over, but the modern, clean dÃ©cor and chalkboard specials menu are a bit different. Service at the bar was attentive and we were frequently checked on by both chefs and management, though our empty dishes stacked up- this didn't really bother me, as they were pretty busy.

For those who are outraged by the higher AYCE price here- if $3 is really a deal breaker for you to drop your rating over, you have no business coming here. Stick to the Dollar Menu. The quality of dishes, freshness of fishes, and variety on the menu are more than enough to warrant the difference in cost.

TIP: Follow them on social media for a 50% off coupon for November & December for a la carte orders (good lunch option).",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,14,4,vO9gPTylkBjOYRRJbags7A

2086186,2016-04-03,1,HmsCerK_rub0Ulo0aC0f9A,"First let me just say that I've been to my fair share of AYCE Sushi restaurants, and this one just did not make the cut, i actually made this Yelp account because i was so disappointed!

Overall presentation of the place is decent, looks clean etc.  

We ate here on a Saturday night around 7pm.  Place was a ghost town, so we were seated quickly.

Menu looked promising so we were anxious to try out some of their stuff!

Let me add real quick, that when i go out to eat, i take my 4 year old son with me as well, and EVERY other sushi place i have been to has AYCE options for children, whether its children's pricing or just half off the adult price. They have no such option here, and my son, who LOVES sushi and seafood, was extremely disappointed that he was not allowed any of the things that he enjoys !  It was pay full $30 (adult dinner price) for him, when he doesn't eat that much anyway or order one of the few meals they had designated only for children. He got stuck eating a very plain Kids Meal option. (California roll, miso soup, and 2 pieces of tempura for 8-$10) While i applaud that they have Kid's Meals at all, i wish they would've had an AYCE option for him as well. Some kids enjoy the flavors and variety.

We had some difficulty ordering from the staff/waiter who didn't seem like they spoke very much english, which happens in quite a few sushi restaurants around town, so we didn't think much of it. UNTIL After ordering appetizers and rolls to get us (ADULTS) started,
i tried to order Edamame for my son. i asked the waitress if i can get the Edamame A La Carte so my son could eat them.  i told her i would pay for it separately and everything ( Since he was not an AYCE ) and she said no, at which point i was confused and didn't understand why, so i tried asking again. To which she just kind of shook her head and winked at me and said ""shhh"" with her finger up to her mouth.  Either this place is just not KID friendly or the waitress REALLY does not speak English and had no idea what i was saying.  So at this point, before we even got any food i was already really disappointed with the way dinner was going. (we never got edamame for him)

Once food arrived, i can say that it was ""fresh"" in the sense that it was hot and seemed freshly cooked/made.  But the flavors on most of the rolls was quite bland and nothing amazing.  Even the appetizers were disappointing. Its not the worst sushi i've tasted, but it wasn't anything worth commending.  Also, we ordered my sons ""Kid's Meal"" first and his plain California roll came out AFTER almost all of our rolls did! Which just bothered me more... 

I think one of the biggest things that irritated us the most was at the end of the meal, we were left sitting there for about 15-20 minutes. They had cleared our table and still had not brought us our check which isn't necessarily bad, but once we did get the bills,  We noticed an added Gratuity. Which most sushi restaurants will add on for big parties. (We had a party of 5 plus the child who did not eat AYCE)  usually 12%-15%, NOPE! this place took an automatic 19%-20% Gratuity out of all our bills, totaling up to about $50-$60 in tips alone.  This irked us quite a bit, especially because we did not think the service or the food was up to par with such a generous TIP!   

I will not be dining here again.

Their shrimp tempura to die for. Hot and crunchy. Lunch is only 19.99!! They even have skewers which are my fave. I got the scallop and bacon which was SO scrumptious. Also ordered the salmon and white tuna nigiri. The salmon was okay. But the white tuna was super good and melts in your mouth. Decent sushi to rice ratio. Also ordered miso soup which was yummy and flavorful. And a spicy tuna hand roll which was also good. But if u want like avo or cucumber with it, u gotta ask for it. 
Then for dessert, I ordered of course the green tea ice cream which wasn't too frozen. It was good and tasted authentic. 

Service was nice. They never rushed us or bothered us while me and my girl were chatting away. They always came at the right time to ask if we wanted anything else to order. Also I think the manager would ask us randomly if we were doing okay during our time there which was nice. 

The environment is simple with tables and a sushi bar. But I do like the type of tables they had. It was wooden benches and wooden tables which felt kind of Japanese traditional.

However today I experienced something no one should have to ever go through. One of the server's ( small lady with glasses) was really rude and embarrassed me in front of my friends that I haven't seen in a real long time today. The situation started because I was taking the rice off of the sushi because Lord knows it was just to much rice on the sushi role.. lol Sorry( I had no idea ..I had to eat all the rice on an all you can eat menu lol! ) She came over to our table super aggressively and told us she was getting us our check with her hands in the air looking exacerbated..I became defensive and replied we are not finished eating and can you please prepare another sushi role. She replied back saying no.. and if I do I will grab you a half a role. I said why?.. she went back in the kitchen where our plates were.. brought it to the front of our table around my friends and other customers!   Saying(you didn't eat all of the rice on your plate!!!!) at this point I was just mortified!!!
I replied by saying  if i violated your policy.. pull me aside or you explain that I will be charged more and I would have totally understood! I immediately went over to the chef and asked is this how you treat your customers. He quickly apologizes for her action! He came over to the table to defuse the situation and the bad experience from his employee.
Please understand my rant.. This is one of my favorite places in the city to eat!! I tell all of my co-workers, friends, and family to go there. So to get treated like this was horrible! As we signed our checks I guess he sent her to tell us sorry.. but I refused to accept the apology because I knew it wasn't coming from a genuine place ( the boss told her to do it)

I would equate this place to the Chinese buffet of sushi restaurants. The only reason I'm even okay with it is because it was only $20. If I had paid their ""standard"" $28 a person, I might have been pretty upset. The food just was not good; it wasn't well made, and the quality was subpar.

The service was fine and our drinks were refilled in standard time intervals. The atmosphere is slightly hipster with wood benches and thin cushions. Honestly, I liked everything but the food here.

The restaurant is clean but that's not a surprise for a brand new spot. The most prominent thing in the restaurant is a chalk board that runs along the entire right wall and is covered with All You Can Eat rules (or All You Cannot Eat rules):

-No sharing
-No sashimi
-No customized rolls
-No a la carte then switching to AYCE

I don't eat shellfish and my wife can't eat avocado. This sounds like a very limiting situation for us. We eat tons of sushi, so it's not normally an issue. I won't list other sushi places on this review, as that's pretty mean. But it doesn't cost much for a restaurant  to accommodate a guest, especially if it's not busy. 

Note to owner:  I understand that you're running a business, but it's a hospitality business. Before you worry about your money, I recommend making your guests feel welcomed. I strongly urge you to erase the chalk board on the wall and put up a pretty picture of something that makes your guests feel happy.

1. The all you can eat option has far too many restrictions, just raise the price and limit the restrictions to a few things. Or put those on a separate page of the menu.

2. Stop threatening to charge for uneaten portions under the all you can eat. Portions are so small I doubt it's a cost issue.

We ordered four different specialty rolls of which I recall the Mad Caterpillar (eel/tuna) was the best one. The service was on point and the cherry on the top was that the bill was 50% off (assuming to bring in more traffic on Wednesdays).

I usually don't care about the level of service I'm receiving as long as the food is good, but in all seriousness, the waiters and waitresses were extremely attentive on my visit, which I was really appreciative about. I especially appreciated how the owner was really friendly!

But on to the more important topic, food:

The appetizers here were sooooo good. I forgot the names of them, but one of them had like a spicy salmon that you mix with seaweed. You mix it up and then eat together. The flavor was so good! I believe it was called Salmon Poke. Who knew mixing the two would taste so good together?

I went with a group of sushi eaters, so I can't comment much about the rolls since our meal mostly consisted of sushi. I really enjoyed the tuna, which after having visited Japan, I get really weird about eating tuna here in the States because nothing tastes as the real deal. But the tuna here was surprisingly good! My favorite was the mackerel though I believe it was. It tasted extremely fresh and had the nice flavor you expect out of piece of sushi.

My group also ordered a yellowtail collar that was SO GOOD. The meat was soft. It had really good flavor, and I seriously wished I ordered more of it.

We also had kobe beef here, and it was sooo good. It shocked me to see that they had real kobe beef, but they even had an official certification for how legit the beef was.",QHi10JYpn27otgp1gmyXaA,0,2,5,JV86JpynMoM7TVmn1z3Q0A

This place actually took over where 808 tapas used to be. I didn't know they closed down! Everything looked the same when we walked in though. Maybe different stuff on the walls.

It wasn't too busy so we sat down right away, AYCE dinner was 28$. A little more pricer than the usual. Once you check in you can get BOGO free house sake so I took advantage of that. But I decided plain sake isn't for me. 

The fish was pretty fresh. The rice/fish ratio was pretty even. That's always a pet peeve of mine at sushi restaurants. The menu had some amazing new items that you don't usually see BUT they weren't part of the AYCE which was a bummer. They did have oysters on the menu 1 order per person but they didn't have tabasco or the cocktail sauce you usually put on oysters. 

The jalapeÃ±o poppers were amazing and also the rock n roll was bomb. It's a rice less roll which I love love those! Looking over the menu again I forgot to try the Monkey brains. Dang it. 

I ordered seaweed salad, it had a really distinct Taste to it that I didn't really like. I got the green tea cheese cake and it was so small! I had to laugh because I saw pictures of it but didn't think it really was as small as it looked in pictures until it was in front of me. 

The service was quick and efficient so no complaints there. 3 stars because it really wasn't mind blowing but overall we had a nice dinner there.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,11,6,3,e-jpehSnOYEukfn4WQc7QA

On both occasions the quality of the fish was excellent, extremely fresh. I know in Japan it's customary to judge a sushi restaurant on the Tomago, my litmus test is typically the yellow tail and it was as good as I have eaten anywhere.   It's not just the fish though, they have a great menu which brings together many different styles of cuisine from Japan.

I have been to quite a few all you can eat sushi places in Las Vegas, they usually bloat you up with a bunch of rice and overdone rolls. Not here, the all you can eat option includes regular sushi as well as rolls (including almost all of the special rolls) and other options like Japanese curry and Korean BBQ beef (which we didn't get to eat because our 1 year old devoured it, the guys were cool about that which was another plus in my book).

I go by my gut when it comes to most decisions in life. My gut told me these are guys who have integrity and they care about what they do. We will be back here at least once each week.

BUT.....  I expect a lot more from a restaurant -- especially a new one listed as ""hot and new"" (at the time).   Yep, I will go on about this, anyone who reads my reviews will hopefully get it.

1. MUSIC.  Im not just saying I didn't like the music.  there was something  REALLY wrong with the sound system like someone disconnected a wire and only half of the frequencies were coming out of some fried wire behind the furnace(??).  I swear it wasn't just me.  My friend who was with me works in music and even offered to go fix the system for them.  It was SO bad i felt kind of queasy or bad trip or something. Completely distracting, especially combined with........
2) YELLING! Every time anyone would walk in the door there was some sort of yelling they did.
I understand if it was one of those places that had games or an mc or whatever (they have this crap in north hollywood but this is like the outskirts of las vegas)  and also florescent lighting,  Totally please NO.   
3) the ""all you can eat"" rules and regulations.  Im not an ""all you can eat"" person.  First of all, i can't eat very much and second because i don't like rules!   These rules were so confusing and restrictive.  They could not totally explain them (maybe because its a new place?) yet, anything we asked for seemed to be impossible. Also, there were all these stipulations written in chalk on some blackboards near the ceiling.  I just wanted a tuna roll with avocado, but that turned into a humongous discussion i finally gave up and got shrimp hibachi.  Then I spent a long time looking for a shrimp within a sea of diced zucchini.  
On the more positive side, its 2 for 1 saki and  there was some sort of shrimp ROLL that everyone in the entire place was going crazy for.  I just don't order shrimp rolls.  So maybe IM the problem!!!?

I feel a little bad saying all this, hence the 3 stars rather than 2, mainly because the staff was super nice and obviously trying very hard to please everyone.  I hope they can work out the sound system thing.  Also, its right next to a big movie theater so its technically a good dinner and a movie place!   

follow chalk instructions, wear earplugs, the theater is 2nd run movies so tix are cheap.  
I would go again, but not on purpose...... or get take out.  truth be told, we were aiming to go to the thai place next door which is for some reason closed on tuesdays.  wow.",Lyf2FkH4AnD5dz2cG668iw,4,2,3,FmrljtxksbXvI8qvszX9Dg

Oh, and he also has an awesome personality and will always make you smile. #KillerSushi #HanabiSushi",csS-oOzKEEUL13NFvNPpuQ,1,1,5,kZa736poL1xRh2fPd6shEA

I've never had any restaurant that continuously yells at customers.  Maybe the owner should give the employees customer service training.  Although my server today didn't even speak English.  I asked her if the restaurant served alcohol she replied I don't know!  I would think that that is something you would train your employees on.  The sushi is usually mediocre.  The all you can eat is limited, and they constantly yell at you throughout the entire meal that you cannot share.  I haven't even picked up the fork yet, and I'm already getting yelled at!  Secondly, I was given a wrong roll and then yelled at me again, saying I ordered it when I did not.  I ordered something completely different.  A second waitress came up to the table and called me a liar basically... she continued yelling at me when there was a very easy resolution...  she could've just brought the correct item.  Also when it is all you can eat, why are you coming back at me and yelling at me?  This place sucks. Don't waist your money!",lDwe4S7L_j_ynvQHhJHnSg,0,0,1,v21C9Cv7QnlaPu9qyY8rnA

.
**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge LV #3**
.
This place LOOKED NICE so hubby & I thought we would make a quick stop & have a little bite... the interior was clean & small. The staff was nice. 

We did not get the AYCE because we had already ate & just wanted some UNI & SALMON for dessert.... we made the wrong decision... we went in and sat down at the bar since we would be quick.  We might as well have gotten AYCE instead of A LA CARTE since our bill ended up being $45 which $7 short of the AYCE total.... then we could have at least tried some of the hot food to give the place some justice.

UNI $7 - tasted like the scrap part of the uni... the parts of the UNI you can't even tell it is uni... I REALLY don't want to say this but I thought I was eating in a SEWER when I put it into my mouth.  So I had to force down the other piece with a WHOLE bunch of kizame wasabi & soy sauce.

SALMON BELLY - this was their special for the day... hubby said it was super fishy.... this I'd coming from a man that critiques every sushi JOINT solely based on their salmon.... the most common fish that sells the most....

I wish I could go back but if you ruin someone's palate w/ bad uni.... it's hard to go back... the quality was BEYOND hiding behind the excuse of AYCE",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,5,3,2,S1oQFRzEoPIflJa8E7Z3yg

Great selection for AYCE.
Met Chef Andy, who was a delight and also provided complimentary champagne for my birthday.

Took a while to take our orders, and for some reason took only the AYCE orders first (majority), and didn't come back to get the a la carte people until much later.
One of our party did not get even half of their AYCE order brought to his table, nor was any apology given or ammends made when he brought it to their attention.
We did not get all of the AYCE items the waitress wrote down that we ordered.
I didn't appreciate being asked who in my party left a poor Yelp review, and nothing done to encourage that person to return. A comp'd meal? A gift card/certificate? Dessert on the house?

3239857,2018-06-10,0,HmsCerK_rub0Ulo0aC0f9A,"Alright, so overall, a great place for AYCE sushi. Awesome price.

Sushi- so they call the ngiri sushi, so I will too. The sushi is always great- two tiny pieces (NOT WORTH IT UNLESS YOURE DOING AYCE) I always get 1 bluefin, 2 tuna, 2 salmon, 2 superwhite, and a yellowtail. In my opinion, solid food. Decent quality- for 25.99 AYCE, worth it.

Rolls- be careful. If it says habeÃ±ero, it's not a good roll. The habanero rolls literally have no flavor. They don't put any good sauce, just dumb horrifyingly hot sauce on it. Rock and roll is good, as are the dragons. If it's spicy, be wary.

Other stuff- oysters not good, but what can you expect, pork belly AWESOME, chicken good, jalapeno poppers delicious, shrimp poppers good, ice cream good. 

Again, it's crazy that they can sell all that ^ for 25.99 for everything total. That's ridiculously good prices for good quality food. The service is nice and the food comes out SUPER FAST.

Update: when I went here with someone they ordered the shoyu ramen. I tried the broth and it had a really nice, clean flavor, so when I came back, I decided to try the tonkotsu ramen. It came hot, like it should be, and the broth was nice. Noodles were cooked well and tasted like they had just been cooked. I personally prefer thin noodles instead of these thick ones, but whatever. I do have a few criticisms: first, usually they have an egg with a liquid yolk, which is always nice to mix into the broth. Also, the ramen literally had broth, meat, and green onions. Nothing else that I could see. Lots of pork meat, however for some reason it wasn't seared? Normally it has a crispy skin and then soaks in the broth to a crispy outside super soft inside that melts into the broth. Instead, it was just soft.

Now onto the important part: the broth. At first taste I loved the broth. It wasn't a clean flavor like the shoyu- instead it was a thick, flavorful broth. Both broths seem good and different. The broth was pretty awesome. Once it cooled I got a clearer taste of the broth. It wasn't as porky, though... it tasted a lot more chickeny. Personal preference, a thick porky broth is Best, but a thick chickeny broth was good too (it is tonkotsu though... maybe I'm wrong and there was no chicken flavor)? It almost tasted like a super high quality top ramen in a way, very chickeny. Anyway, I enjoyed the broth, just needs a little more. Please sear the pork skin to make it a crispy outside!!! Add a little more into the broth, like some bamboo, to make it more interesting in my opinion.",DVNPdJKMwS7-OXSYabIE9g,0,0,4,QAyN-d09gNb6iZUJZh5xWw

Cleanliness 1 star

Ambiance/decor 1 star

Food quality 1 star

Customer service 1 of 2 stars

Over all this is a good place for those who love AYCE sushi. The modern look and family style seating are very welcoming when you first walk in. At a glance of the whole restaurant the level of cleanliness was more than acceptable. Quality of fish used for the sushi was hit and miss. I was served on a couple of occasions some sushi that didn't look fresh and didn't taste fresh either. Food quality for the rolls was good. Now for the customer service I experienced wasn't the best. To give some background I worked in the restaurant industry for 3 years. I know when the major rush of customers come in to restaurants. To avoid the rush and enjoy the experience of eating sushi I chose to come in on a Saturday mid afternoon. I was literally the ONLY person there at the restaurant. I was greeted by a waitress almost immediately which was great. I enjoy sitting at the sushi bar to interact with the sushi chefs as they are the experts. Unfortunately this is where my experience went south. The sushi chef catering to me was not as friendly and very short with the conversations I would try having with him. I felt rushed with ordering sushi when I just started eating a roll in front of me. I kept getting rushed and kept getting asked what else I wanted when I wasn't even finished with what was in front of me. It became somewhat uncomfortable. I heard someone say hello and it seemed to be the manager or owner as their communication/people skills were very good. Unfortunately due to the poor service I felt I was receiving from the sushi chef I was too poor in a mood to really interact with this gentleman. The waitress definitely was kind and made sure everything was ok with me. Aside from that, my personal opinion on the sushi chef attire was very poor. Using baseball caps and inconsistent attire reflected in the attitude. The worst part of this experience is that I was the ONLY person there. Never have I felt so rushed when eating sushi. To make matters worse I got tired of getting rushed so I told the sushi chef I was done ordering. Next thing I know the chef pulls out his phone takes off his cap and goes sits in a corner. I have to give a real review of the restaurant so it will stay at 4/5 star ratings. If I was rating on customer service alone. This review would have been a 2/5 star rating.",VwhYoqvOS91JBZAqLjcUFQ,0,0,4,1ILq5QaMPoOrTFwGWRTgVQ

Hanabi has a fairly large menu with some items only available a la carte. Nigiri is the way to go here. The quality is pretty good for an AYCE place. Rolls on the other hand weren't my favorite. Some, like the yellowtail special with cooked shrimp, jalapeÃ±o, cilantro, cucumber topped with yellowtail, ponzu, habanero, were too hot for my tastes. The Tiger roll (shrimp tempura, crab topped with spicy tuna with eel sauce) was the best of the bunch, the Mad Caterpillar (fresh water eel and cucumber topped with spicy tuna, spicy eel sauce) was decent, and the Crispy tuna scallion was not good with tuna that looked and tasted liked canned tuna. As a whole, the rolls seemed hastily crafted and lacked the precision of superior rolls found elsewhere.

There are just a couple of rules you are going to have to follow if you want to roll out a new AYCE sushi bar in Las Vegas:

1 - Keep your prices competitive ($3+ more than everywhere else? Why?)
2 - Keep your fish fresh (if you cant sell it before it starts to turn, don't try to pass it on to unsuspecting customers)
3 - Don;t be cheap (buy sushi quality fish - believe me, we can tell the difference)
3 - Offer what everyone else does (if you wont serve me sashimi with AYCE, why should I come here?)
4 - Don't skimp on portions (look, stop being cheap, your fish is going rank, use it before it goes)

I will say it not the worst place I have tried in Vegas, but if I am paying piece meal instead of going AYCE, I expect you not to give my tiny little sliver of fish.

I'll be honest, the salmon tasted like crap. Sushi grade salmon doesn't taste like the cheap, color added, farmed raised crap you buy at Vons.

The food itself is great. I am no sushi connoisseur, but have enjoyed everything that I have eaten from here. I mostly eat rolls (being pretty new to the sushi game) and the waitstaff has recommended some great options for me to order based on things I liked previously. My husband loves sushi, knows a lot more about it, and maintains that the quality of the food is great. He has taken advantage of the 28$ all you can eat offer, and it was a great deal for him. If you're hungry, it's the way to go! The staff brought the food out very quickly, I don't think they put any limit on how many items he could order at one time, and he ended up really pleased with the all you can eat deal. 

On two separate occasions the kitchen comped us appetizers, the spicy garlic edamame and a seaweed salad. Both were very good - I would expect a sushi place to slack a little on appetizer quality, but they did not. The cook also came out personally to talk to us once about our food, and he generally seems to care a great deal about the restaurant and quality of his food.

There is an extensive list of rolls, soups, salads, entrees and appetizers. Did I mention the miso soup? If you like miso get it here -you won't regret it.

4043789,2015-09-06,1,HmsCerK_rub0Ulo0aC0f9A,"Overall the place was pretty average. Long story short, the appetizers were awesome, the sushi was subpar, and the desert was horrible. The place was really loud too. The prices are also more expensive than other all you can eats and too many items are a la carte only.

Long story long, read on.

First, the restaurant itself. It has a nice, modern, clean vibe and look to it. The staff were friendly. One complaint was the music was way too loud. It was hard to have a normal conversation without raising our voices, so we kindly asked if they could turn the volume down. Instead, the waitress asked if we wanted to move to a different table. Since the volume level is pretty much the same no matter where you are there, that perplexed us and we stayed put. 

Prices are steeper here. Lunch is $22 and dinner is $28. That's $3 more than average. Several items are a la carte only that are typically included at other all-you-can-eat places (albiet often one order only), though that have some special items that justify it like real kobe beef. House sake was also $6 for a small and $9 for a large, which is also about $3 more expensive than other places. Note that there is a 2 for 1 deal for sake or beer if you check in on Yelp, so that helps.

Onto the food. They have a decent variety of appetizers, including some with enoki mushrooms which you don't usually see. We tried a wide variety of them and everything was well prepared, well portioned, and delicious. The tempura based items were particularly tasty. We were happy campers so far.

Our nigiri sushi orders came out and our enthusiasm dropped. The quality of the fish was fairly good, but the pieces were fairly small, and the fish was cut very thin. They were about 90% rice and 10% fish. The rolls we received were also pretty stingy with the fish as the cuts on top were equally thin, and the fish inside was small compared to the other filler items. When compared to places like Sakana or Sasa who are very generous with their fish portions, it was very disappointing.

After getting full on mostly rice, we asked for dessert. This is when things got pretty dire. I got the vanilla ice cream with macaroons, and my friends got green tea and strawberry mochi. My ice cream was partially translucent and looked more like a sorbet, like it was dairy free. Worst vanilla ice cream ever. The macaroon also tasted kind of like garlic, which was really strange. I'm guessing it had been stored next to it and the garlic flavor creeped in. The green tea mochi was horrid. The rice covering was crumbly and had a rough texture. The ice cream was neon yellowish green, had a weird texture, and tasted funny. The strawberry mochi was better at least, but not great.

One other minor gripe was with the men's bathroom. The urinal wouldn't flush, and the toilet paper felt like it was from 1970's Soviet Russia. At least it was clean.

The staff were friendly and attentive outside of the issue with the loud music, and one of the chefs personally said goodbye to us as we were walking out.

We give it a 2 1/2 out of 5. Definitely not the worst place I've been to, but there's definitely room to improve, and there much better places like Sasa and Sakana, which are also cheaper. If they do a better job with fish portions, desserts, bring the prices down a bit, and turn the music down, we'll be keen to return. Until then we'll stick with Sasa and Sakana as our main places.",v0QQFY3i8IkCMHtGik4rTw,0,0,3,RVy77WJ9a918IiquO-xMAA

Easily my worst sushi experience in Las Vegas. The space itself isn't bad with a clean decor and friendly service. The fail all comes with the quality of the sushi and the combinations in the rolls here. Typically when i do AYCE sushi i am 90% nigiri and 10% rolls. After placing my traditional 90/10 order for the first round, the quality made me want to order rolls to cover up the sub par quality of the fish. I found myself not even wanting to eat some of the nigiri but i felt as if i had to as to not get charged extra for it in the end. Second round was more rolls than anything was also a disappointment because there was just so much sauce, a mess of combinations, and flavor that didn't resemble anything delicious. After paying the bill i felt cheated to be honest, as i felt like i was fed something i didn't want and was forced to pay for it. A terrible feeling if you were hoping to go out for a nice dinner.

I saw him write down salmon roll but thought it's just how he remembers it..the waitress brought out the order and immediately asked if I ordered the salmon roe (I had done the same order like 4x with her before this) and she immediately took it back and came back with the right order. The dude who made the mistake kept saying in his language which I interpret it to mean ""oh salmon roe not salmon roll, ikura not salmon roll). Wasn't even the least bit apologetic and when he came back with the order he low key snidely said ""salmon and IKURA"". Like bro 1. it says on your own menu salmon roe. 2.

Last Saturday, my friend and I were meeting in that area of town for lunch and to get piercings. We were both ravenous, so AYCE sushi was the obvious answer. I checked Yelp and Hanabi had fabulous reviews. We are around 4:30 in the afternoon, and the place was empty. But that just lead to an amazing experience. We chose to sit at the bar and the ladies who manage the bar were prompt, polite, and gave great recommendations. When I went for myself second visit, we sat at a table, but our experience was just as good. Our waiter was so nice, gave great recommendations, and even let us get away with using our one per person to order two of the same thing for one person. 

When it comes to food, everything was so fresh, creative, and the presentation was amazing. Their sashimi was the perfect portions and they have lots of non sushi items too, so this place is great if you want to check it out with a non raw fish eater. You have to try the Sushi Bomb roll, the Sunset roll, Animal Style roll, and the Mona Lisa Roll. The CocoSalmon roll was also very creative and good.

Luckily we were passing by on their first day of business so we decided to give it a try! I was originally just looking for some appetizers to snack on but the all you can eat dinner for 28.00 seemed pretty reasonable so I went with the all you can eat. 

I started with the Kobe beef sushi roll. It had Kobe beef, avocado and a sweet type of sauce drizzled on the top. It was delicious! 

The crispy buffalo shrimp was tangy . They were bite sized shrimp with buffalo flavoring. 

The 007 was like a California roll but with big pieces of shrimp and avocado draped over the rolls. I enjoyed these as well!

Bacon and scallop skewers were mostly bacon with tiny pieces of scallops inside. They had different skewers available . I would like to try the bacon and mushroom skewers next time. 

Chicken Katsu wraps were good especially for people like my husband who don't eat sushi. He was happy with the wrap and his cucumber salad .

We ended the meal with some honey toast. It reminded me of hawaiian rolls with ice cream and honey on the top. It  was my first time having this dessert be prepared for sweetness overload!

I liked the variety on the menu and that there wasn't a lot that was left out of the all you can eat. Except for the sashimi but it was okay with me because I don't eat sashimi.

The only dish I did not care for was the honey toast. They served us a roll with ice cream and honey. If you want good honey toast, go to Ichiza in China Town.

4676646,2015-12-15,5,HmsCerK_rub0Ulo0aC0f9A,"They say the Japanese eat with their eyes.  A lot of that comes through in sushi preparation and service.  You want your nigiri to be sharply prepared, with tight rice and well cut and presented fish.  When you take the piece in your hand or your sticks, the entire nigiri should be as one piece - a combination of visual flavor and delicious colors.

This was a second choice for us tonight, since our usual sushi joint was overflowing with customers and had a 1 hour wait.  There is a reason for that.

When we arrived at Hanabi, there was no wait.  Indeed, this is usually a positive, but in a foodie town like Vegas, this sometimes means that the fare simply does not match up to a discerning palate, and the punters go elsewhere.

I wish the presentation was better, but I can deal with that as long as the food is good.  Unfortunately the sushi tasted less than fresh, and this was especially apparent in the mackerel, the tuna and the salmon nigiri - all of which are especially unforgiving of poor preparation and in which freshness is paramount.  You can understand why I did not want to try any of the rolls, which are usually designed to mask bad fish behind heavy sauces and creamy bases.  The nigiri had a paucity of quality fish, overwhelmed by too much under-seasoned rice underneath.

The servers were attentive but frequently intrusive - standing around very close by while we tried to enjoy the meal.  Unfortunately, they had to go back to the chef's station multiple times to check on overdue orders that I asked for but only sometimes received.  It did not help that the chef seemed to be more focused on supervising and guiding a trainee or novice chef instead of getting orders out promptly.

Hanabi is a laudable effort but it doesn't work in this part of town.  Unfortunately, all the empty chairs on a normally busy night bodes poorly for this spot.  808 Tapas also did not fare well for the same reason - it could be the unforgiving location with high rents, but also the picky customers in Summerlin.  The Grand Opening sign in December when the restaurant has been open since June also is topic for a laugh.

I wish them well but there's a long way to go to be successful.

My recommendations:

1. Lower your AYCE prices by 10-15% immediately in order to stay competitive.
2. Add Happy Hour specials to include generous drinks along with the food - they don't have to be expensive drinks, well-grade sake is more than enough.
3. Groupon all day every day.
4. You need to get a better sushi fish purveyor.  Something is not right about the nigiri and the sashimi.
5. Include sashimi in the AYCE.
6. Loyalty program to keep the locals coming - buy 4 AYCE and get next one free.",i_gbQdvN135NZbSn9oMS8w,2,0,2,PVN297f12O28a6Op8jj6Xw

Sushi rice should be blended with chef's special vinegar mix, instead just stander cal-rose rice which fall apart when pick up every time. Tempura batter bit thick and not really crunchy.

Sunset roll: 3.5/5 spicy tuna roll with salmon on top drizzled with a sauce that tasted like spicy mayo. They used too much sauce in my opinion and the salmon on top was skimpy. But each piece was a perfect bite size which I liked. $12

Hamachi Kama: 4.5/5 smelled a little fishy but it was soft and tender! $9

Gyoza: 4.5/5 

Habachi steak: 3.5/5 had an interesting sauce that I cannot describe. But I smelled butter and I'm not a fan of that. The steak itself was ok, not that tender. It was a good portion though.",cLFOKo3WRtsK4oB6yAPw8A,0,2,5,6x-Zws7nZMVgFCfNMrrCBA

Especially since the service seems to be great at the very beginning.  The waitresses were very kind.  But it was like a train wreck.  Through the entire experience, they forgot what we order, gave it to the wrong table, we had to re-order.  It was a hot mess.  My brother and I honestly gave up.  We did the AYCE special for $20.  We were there for about an hour and a half, literally an hour was us waiting for our food that never came.  Which honestly was REALLY annoying.  There were even times when the entire staff was arguing because a to-go order was misplaced.  Honestly, the entire experience was so bad, I would NEVER come again.  The reason why I gave it a two instead of a one is because the waitress were honestly nice people.  The entire overall experience was TERRIBLE.  

I would comment on the food, but I can't even remember eating anything because they barely gave us anything.  

Spent $50 on sushi, ended up getting a front-row seat to a live reality TV on Korean workers' drama at a sushi restaurant.  I usually go to Drama Fever for me Korean drama, but I guess not this time.",T52SQsL2K8MZ00Bq7NK8eA,0,0,2,yT3PahlHKY2kdj4WSG1-Mg

First night was Wife, 4 year old, toddler, uncle, aunt, and I for dinner after the indoor playground across the parking lot around 6 on the Saturday of memorial weekend. There were about 4 open tables and a few seats at the bar, so we were seated immediately. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and attentive and knew we were there to feast on some AYCE. 

My kids love Udon noodles so we ordered them with the drink order and they were very content slurping them up off their plates while the grown ups enjoyed a buffet of nigiri and rolls. The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri is slightly more than what you would expect to get for $25 AYCE. 

On the Sunday night of memorial weekend, we made reservations for 10 people around 6 and met up for another round of ""stuff yourself silly with sushi."" This time around we tried a bunch of appetizers in addition to nigiri and rolls. The staff was excellent again.

The staff and chefs were happy to greet you at first glance and say goodbye once you were all ready to leave. Though they did have an all you can eat for a time limit deal, we opted in for single rolls as we werent as hungry to destroy as much after a movie and popcorn that hour prior. We started off with the 007 and loved it, fresh, creamy. Then did something a little more spicy with our favorite ingrediant; avocado and what seemed like a tobasco/hot wing sauce appropriately named the 911. I'm a spice guy myself so it was well received.

After that, we enjoyed the heated Snow White roll that melted in our mouth and was clearly our favorite. The service was top notch and they were quick on the drink refills without a single issue. We stayed talking for a bit and although most places seemed pushy after a meal, they were happy enough to keep asking to refill our drinks, which was refreshing. We give this grand opening a great review because it was great service, great food and not too bad on the price for great atmosphere and a clean establishment.

Although I was quite cold because they kept the place pretty chilly. We opted for the AYCE option which was more than worth it. They have a couple of interesting appetizers that we tried. One of the was the monkey brain or something to that effect. It was like tempura fried avocado but it was tasty. Sushi was unique and fresh. I had the red tiger roll and the baja roll. Red tiger was a spicier version of a typical tiger roll. The baja was a play on a special roll with addition of cilantro. Also tried the coco salmon roll which was interesting and almost sweet. Ended with a dish they called honey toast. It was tasty but only if it was warm because that's what I expected. Service was good granted we were the only ones in the place at a point.

4947983,2018-01-04,0,HmsCerK_rub0Ulo0aC0f9A,"Checked it out for dinner with friends since it was the closest AYCE sushi spot. I'm on the fence about this place. For now, I will give this place a 3. It wasn't the best, nor was it the worst. Just meh.

We were acknowledged and greeted promptly as we walked through the door.  The restaurant was loud, lively,  and was about at 50% capacity for a dinner time. Not too bad. We informed the hostess there was three in our party and lead quickly to a 4-top. I went to the restroom to wash my hands and came back to my party with only place settings and menus for two..  I corrected it myself by grabbing from the table next to us. Aside from that little hiccup,  service was quick and they were attentive. I never had to ask for a refill on my beverages. 

Pricing was good for an AYCE. $24.99. But very confusing. Why put on Yelp! that to check in the price is $24.99 when the price is already that to begin with? I thought the draw for businesses using Yelp! was to for an incentive for visiting their establishment?

My qualifications for an AYCE restaurant are very minimal: 
- fresh ingredients, mainly their uni and amaebi
- is their salmon skin hand roll actually crispy and mostly salmon skin?
- do they have natto?
- do they carry fresh wasabi?

Their uni was very fresh. Firm and no bad aftertaste. Same with amaebi. The downside to their amaebi is the puny size and no tempura heads to accompany the nigiri. 

Their salmon skin hand roll should really be considered a salmon handroll as there was more salmon than fried skin. Taste was fine and as always I forget to ask no eel sauce. I'm very picky to menu items; don't list something if it's not what you are presenting the guest. While we are on this topic, please don't say that you have soft shell crab on the menu and only give half of the soft shell crab. I understand it is only 1 per guest on AYCE, but at least specify it's half of the soft shell. I'll gladly pay for a full crab.

Natto was not on the menu from what I saw, but they did carry it. Down side, they were out! I get that it is a Tuesday and they were closed Monday, but it's a Tuesday... deliveries should have been made to compensate for a busy weekend if they were running low, so that was a let down.

Seeing as they were not up to par with my necessities for sushi, I opted to not inquire about fresh wasabi.

Dessert menu offered the nornal sushi staple: tempura ice cream and mochi ice cream. Nothing made the desserts stand out or scream out.

But definitely willing to give them a chance again.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,1,0,3,mVd0XjutF42UlnMQzRBUOg

Most all you can eat sushi places are middle of the road quality wise but NOT Hanabi. The fish is so fresh and tender it melts in your mouth. The variety and quality of rolls availabe will make even the most picky of diners happy. One thing we loved was how Hanabi doesn't skimp on the fish in their rolls the way many all you can eat places do. 

Big John and the owner Andy were the chefs for our visit and they were so friendly and accommodating. The entire staff for that matter were so genuine they made us feel like old friends. 

Make sure you try the Andy's roll and the Hanabi roll. And if big John or Andy are behind the counter ask them to make you something special thats not on the menu and prepare your taste buds for perfection.

This might be my new west side sushi spot when I don't feel like driving across the strip to Sakana.

Pros:
-Small nigiri cuts, but also small rice portion...fair balance
-Halibut on the nigiri menu...YES!
-Shrimp appetizers done 3-4 different ways
-Overall good quality of fish
-They have a loyalty card where your 11th is free 
-Honey toast tasted better here than at Sakana and the ice cream wasn't rock hard
-Friendly owner, Andy, came to ask how everything was...also friendly servers

Cons: 
-I miss all the no rice sushi options that Jjanga and Sakana offer, they only had one on the menu and you can order it once as opposed to other places that give you 5-6 options to order (and I order them all)
-They had two specials written on the board of which you could have one of each...they were out of one, so I figured they'd make up for it by allowing me to order two of the other. Nope.
-Haven't found my favorite roll yet of the comparatively limited choices offered, but I'm a nigiri guy anyway...
-The raw oysters need a small dab of cocktail sauce or sirarcha or something for flavor ...someone else pointed this out in their review...gotta make that happen

Anyone moaning about the $28 price tag for dinner...if you do the math (and you like the place) it comes back into the $25-$26 AYCE dinner price range...completely in line with the rest of the AYCE sushi joints in Vegas.

The wait staff are very polite and helpful in telling about each roll or about their specials. I really like the benches they have as tables, like an old camping table on a hiking trail. It's funny!. The food itself is pretty fresh, and the wait isn't too long from ordering to receiving. They are also pretty hidden, I literally stumbled across them by sheer coincidence a couple weeks ago and had to search yelp for over an hour to find the restaurant. Hidden gem? Definitely! The 1 bad mark I have is that this last time I came in, they were actually very slow, so we had multiple waiters dealing with us, so we would order from 1 person, he would leave, and 30 seconds later another guy came up asking if we needed anything else. But they didn't talk to each other. We put in 1 order, and both waiters brought us that roll. It was funny, but was also mildly annoying. I won't let it stand in the way of coming back though.

5636428,2017-07-09,0,HmsCerK_rub0Ulo0aC0f9A,"I ordered delivery from Hanabi through Yelp; I've never been to the restaurant.

Generally, I don't think that sushi lends itself well to grocery stores or delivery. Take out is only minimally better. Sushi is not just about the food, it's about the experience.

I also learned to appreciate sushi in Japan, where I lived for 17 years. It follows that I'm unfamiliar with what has become sushi in America. All the different rolls, the decidedly un-sushi flavors, like jalapeÃ±o, confuse me! So we only ordered traditional nigiri, no rolls or specialties.

That said, one expects a restaurant to do its best to overcome the inherent difficulties in offering sushi for delivery. Presentation is important, maybe not for showy spider rolls, but for traditional sushi. Ours arrived in typical styro boxes, with no garnish or decoration, no eye to arrangement. Our order looked so unappetizing, I was tempted to throw the whole thing away.

So, on to the actual product. Sushi is not about fish. Although fish plays an important role, undeniably, there are many varieties of sushi that have no fish at all. Sushi is about the rice. It should be very sticky, slightly sweet, shiny, and just about room temperature; neither too hot nor too cool.

The rice that Hanabi served seemed to be nothing more than steamed white rice. It had no cohesion, so the pieces were difficult to pick up. Chopsticks, fork, and bare hands were equally ineffective. And the rice was tasteless.

Any ""itamae"" worth his ginger will tell you that he spent upwards of ten years perfecting his knife skills, and still practices regularly. The slivers of fish we received were poorly cut with ragged edges that made us wonder if the chef's knife maybe needed sharpening. I am by no means a sushi chef, but I could probably have done better with a sharp chef's knife.

Finally, the order came out wrong. Sushi I ordered wasn't there, and sushi I didn't order was.

For the price, which was not in the realm of ""inexpensive,"" this restaurant disappointed with its delivery. But I must again state that this review is for delivery only, and in-house quality may be vastly different. Based on the other reviews here, I may visit the restaurant, but I won't be ordering delivery from them again.",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,0,0,2,pTWrAxx5nV4imDILYP5SVQ

** Important ** Before I give my reviews, I must say sushi or sashimi (i.e. raw fish) is something we have not tried. We just could not have them, because my wife was pregnant.

Ambience
Nice and clean restaurant with a lot of screens, maybe little too many.
****

Service
Generally pay attention to our table good. We were in at 3pm so with very few tables to serve, that is expected, but still nice. However, I was shock with what server said. One of the food that we ordered was Cold Soba, after 5 minutes, the server comes back and says ""sorry we are short on cold soup so we will not be able to make Cold Soba"" this was something that my wife really wanted or the baby inside really wanted lol she then continued by saying ""the one on desert inn is good for this"" To me it sounded like ""no one order those and you should go to that one, if you want Cold Soba"" Just sounded very rude.
**

Food
We ordered Cold Soba, Japanese Hamburger Steak and Baked Salmon Roll.
As I mentioned above we ordered Cold Soba, but it wasn't available so we cancelled the order. Japanese Hamburger Steak, we ordered well-done because of pregnant wife. The food came out burnt on the outside and very salty. What does this mean? Instead of cooking in the medium heat for more well-done inside and not burnt outside, they cooked in full flame. Salty means, they just cooked it for longer period of time to get it more cooked without changing any level of sodium or adding water. Hence mushroom and onion that were with the meat was also salty.
Baked Salmon Roll had some more expensive ingredients in it, such as cream cheese, salmon and some more cheese on top, but again they could not balanced the flavours.
Other side dishes were not best either. Wasabi was pretty low quality or was not stored in right temperature. Iced green tea was green coloured iced water instead of tasting green tea. Salad was fresh, but too much dressing.
Overall, the food here is a kind of food that you would find in a mall food court, no expertise or love in cooking.
*

Price
Japanese Hamburger Steak should be sufficient for $4
Baked Salmon Roll should be sufficient for $6 just because there are some higher priced ingredient in it.
So total bill with tip should have been about $14, but instead the bill was over $30
