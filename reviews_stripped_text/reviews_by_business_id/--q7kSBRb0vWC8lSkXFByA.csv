This is a Villa Pizza outlet inside a nice, huge Sports Bar. Highly recommended.",yRpS19ckVDxkBFY_h1RxHA,2,0,5,Nr2PWPdwfhhtZsI8HIHPrQ
1839449,2012-01-27,0,--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA,Great place to watch football games in Vegas. Great staff with a great menu. A bit off of the strip but its worth the 5 minute drive south on Vegas Blvd.,7JqEV0teqjvrw26f9AqGKA,0,0,5,yvZFjh4bQWtn6OOeuhfGEg

They usually have some kind of raffle giveaway during big games too, which I've won a couple times :) ! I come here for the burger though! I swear it is the best I've had in Vegas..... very random, I know. You can ""create your own"" with type of cheese, sauce, bun, etc. I always get a burger cooked medium with swiss cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and hickory smoked bbq sauce on toasted sourdough. It is soooo good!!! with a heaping amount of fries! 
My boyfriend swears by their pizzas, which are also delicious! 
Overall this is a good spot to play video poker, get good drinks by a very friendly staff, watch a game, eat a great burger, and play elvis pinball!",J2sXNzMZQpnAtqAgIqVVIw,3,1,4,WKQ9fAtoX6uZpb01eK6m3A

3263885,2012-01-15,0,--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA,Another neighborhood watering hole of mine - I love that they have a mini game room and a shuffle board table.  Try the pizza and catch a game or two.. they have a ton of screens.  I also think they have quiz nights on Tuesday nights.. but don't quote me on that.,7o2ZPijGOxaUncf5FEkCRA,0,0,4,uzvypohsdjSTgYG9ABOnlA
3695531,2012-05-01,0,--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA,"This is my favorite ""local"" bar! stiff cheap drinks, great food for if i don't feel like cooking, trying to avoid fast food, and especially for after a late night. I can come here anytime of day and be entertained, enjoy a drink, and a good meal. My faves here: wings, pizza, any of the sandwiches (including the burgers), breakfast, Josh and steed. but dont go. it's my personal oasis.",DecO2L7P6qsP5dWSizMevw,0,0,4,3mp-7cIBI4-qm7ZG5H3E5Q

We always order dinner and play the video machines at the bar. This was our first Friday evening at Double Play and the service was horrible! The quality of the food was very good, as always. The two bartenders seemed oblivious to our presence and made no eye contact with us or other patrons until engaged in a transaction. In short...the only thing lacking here is the staff's attention to the patrons. Game-up people!",dwaerfZlyrlEFoWK2V2New,0,0,2,Neyrw_3OLq5tVgWXWTFXTQ
