For our normal order, we ask for it be lightly baked, basically meaning, don't burn our pizza/twists. Normally their employees understand and we get a great meal worth driving across town for.....



However it's been completely random the level of service for everything else about the restaurant though.


There's been times where the employees are just lackadaisical, the food eventually gets to us, and with no flair or care about anything we've ordered.

Sometimes employees just seem to be lacking a work ethic, tables needing a quick scrub down, salad bar needing to be cleaned up, etc

And once we were directly insulted for our order lied to about our order just having shown up in their system, even though we had ordered it 20 minutes prior, and claiming they could never make our order how we've ordered it from years from multiple locations.

The lady snarked at us that they could only do it if we wanted to get sick.

Round Table is from the Bay area and its fairly hard to find here. Boy did I feel like a doofus to realize there was one just five miles away from me. To be fair, it's kind of hidden in the back corner of a plaza...

I don't eat pizza too often, but when I do I want good crust and tons of toppings- Round Table is great for both of these things, which justifies their higher-than-average pricing (around $15 for a medium). Their sauce is nicely zesty without being too acidic, and their cheese is loaded on and real- not that tastless crap other places use. At 8 slices, a medium can easily feed two with leftovers, and I highly recommend the KING ARTHUR, with bell peppers, linguica, salami, Italian sausage, and more. It's like a classier version of your standard supreme pizza. 

Just a heads up, the pizza here is made fresh. If you come in and order, youll be waiting about 15 minutes for your pie- which is plenty of time to soak up their great music, featuring hits from the 90s, back when Round Table was originally popular! 

TIP: Join their e-club using the tablet at the register, confirm your phone number by text, and you'll get a code to use (immediately) for a free order of garlic cheese twists.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,7,4,Hx_89KZgn_TEhjqjcsWC-Q

I also added pineapple on mine. The 6 twists come with one tiny cup of ranch and when I asked for more, it was an up charge which is extremely disappointing.

Overall, the pizza tasted pretty nice--extremely cheesy! Their garlic twists were absolutely amazing, though I didn't particularly like their marinara sauce. There's a decent amount of options for drinks as well and I enjoyed my time here.",G3Gl01AULjn2XqfcR1cthg,1,0,4,5chWI29ka7gOAcmUQnnfEg
3290981,2015-09-06,1,LrO_Xy6lfpbTgFoJcOjY4w,"Hands down the best pizza you'll find.  I've been going to these chains since I was a kid from AZ, WA, Cali and now Nevada.  They Round Table has a large variety of specialty pizzas which are amazing.  My personal favorite is the Italian Garlic. If you are not looking for anything fancy they have the regular stuff to which is just as good. Their sauce is very unique and fresh toppings makes it a great experience, not your typical pizza. I also recommend their garlic Parmesan twists. The chain and food is five stars. 

This location though there are some complaints.  The last few times
I've gone the AC is never turned on making it feel like a jungle inside. I probably will never dine in here again given it was not a one time fluke. Their buffet is very small.  They have a couple medium pizzas out at a time. You can not get full bread sticks. They cut each stick into fourths so you can't take as much. They also do not put wings on the buffet which stinks.  On top of all this you have to eat in the sweltering heat of the dining room. 

They have a great product so it's worth eating but i suggest you take it to go and avoid the buffet. I also hate how places like this charge for ranch when you spend 15 bucks on a pizza. I can see if Pizza Hut charges but expensive gourmet pizza this is a insulting charge.  RTP is five stars but I have to give this location 3.

 I also have not experienced any ""mediocre"" service for a long time and they are always pleasant at the location and always get my order correct.

If there was one knock, it's Tuesday buffet night where they sometimes have a hard time keeping up with the demand of consumers (pun intended)!

So- going back to the date in question, April 6th, as  requested on the sides of the napkin dispensers in the restaurant that as a customer you may text or email the owner of any complaints, concerns or any feedback. I composed a text, frustrated but polite as I waited for my money back. My phone has it at 5:03 pm Friday April 6th, the receipt of the void return is also 5:03 pm Friday April 6th so it should be rather obvious I text at the time of the complaint. I heard back from the owner at 11:07 pm Sunday night, April 9th. No apology, only asking how the order was placed. 

Monday I had not been given a resolution, in the mean time I posted on yelp and called the corporate office. This owner had the freakin nerve to text me Tuesday with a completely inaccurate time line ""from the manager"" ( dealt with an assistant manager when I asked for my money back). Calling me a liar and still held the same rude tone. The saying is ""the customer is always right"", which usually is BS. In this case I told them to check any cameras to prove the time I was there along with a brief description of my clothing, where I was sitting and events that happened in the time I claim to have been there vrs the completely made up version of their management. Also took pictures of the receipt that discredited the story from the manager. Haven't heard back from the owner. They must either not believe their own receipt or fail to admit failure in the store/ in communication/ in honesty. 

They also asked for what I want from this. A better way with dealing with customers for a start, more ways than one. An apology would be nice. For the franchise, and people within to learn and grow from mistakes. Other than that... F that, we have many pizza options around here without the BS.

TLDR:
1. If someone orders a pizza for pick up, have it ready on time
2. Failing that make it ASAP as they wait'
3. Failing that don't lie to the owner of the franchise store to save your ass when the customer can easily prove otherwise with receipt/ video 
5. As an owner- don't be a jerk to a customer, answer concerns prompt and don't be so quick to dismiss them as a liar

Our first visit to this one's lunch buffet- mon- fri $7.49 for adults, while children over 4, @ $4.99 (pizza, twists, complete salad bar; drinks are extra) so we are familiar with it (we went to the one on Eastern a few times but they stopped having the lunch buffet on saturdays, sad face). Family night is tuesday night, same prices. (I've been wanting to come here for a while now, especially since we moved to this side of town.)

The counter is not far from the entrance, left middle. The fountain drink machine is along the wall after the counter. In the middle is the food (hot pizza and salad bar). To the right (on the other side of the food) is booth seating. The right back is the party room, semi-private seating. The middle back is the small arcade. The left back is where the bathrooms are located. The front of the restaurant, the same side of the entrance are table/ chair seating.

The customer service is very good. We got greeted right away by friendly voices and we paid after a few minutes of waiting. There were very few customers, maybe 5 or 6 parties. It seems like this buffet is a secret. Empty plates were taken away several times from the table. Hot fresh pizza and hot fresh twists were periodically added to the food station. The salad bar was neat. I also noticed that the tables were all very clean. The bathroom was pretty clean too. 

The pizza (smaller cuts) was yummy. I liked the cheese, king arthur's supreme, hawaiian, & veggie. Romaine lettuce, mushrooms, cucumbers, sliced green peppers, blue cheese dressing, sunflower seeds, and croutons. I also had a cinnamon twist. There's much more than I'm mentioning. Nostalgia: this was one of the popular pizza chains in SF, CA. 

I would say this is better than Cici's, better than a casino buffet although it is smaller, it's more quality, and I'm sure we'll be coming back again too.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,2,4,h5FVNsaMgoqR585e63i1Zg

4721590,2016-06-15,2,LrO_Xy6lfpbTgFoJcOjY4w,"This review actually has nothing to do with the pizza and everything to do with with what I consider poor policies and management. The pizza is typical Round Table. If you like Round Table, this franchise does a good job with the pizza.

For delivery if you use a credit card, these guys require identification (which is great) and a physical copy of your credit card. Yes, a physical copy of your card is carried around with an unbonded, probably non-background-checked delivery driver in a probably unlocked car for who knows how long. This practice may have resulted in $325 stolen from my bank account (identity theft). (((I am adding this last part at the request of the owner of this Round Table franchise, who responded privately to my Yelp review but would not otherwise respond to my attempts to contact him (or her - I don't have a name). I attempted to contact the owner TWICE before I posted this review, by the way. I cannot prove that the fraudulent transaction on my card was due to Round Table, its policies, or its employees. What I can prove is that the timing was awfully coincidental and that no other company has ever taken a copy of my card. That card was also not out of my control for any extended period of time prior to the Round Table incident. Everything in this review is completely factual and accurately reflects my experience with this company. It also reflects my personal opinion of the company and its policies.)))  

The manager is, I'm afraid, completely clueless and trapped in her ""it's the company policy"" mindset. The owner never responded to my messages at the ""text the owner"" number.

When a company has this kind of irresponsible behavior and reckless disregard for the financial safety of its customers, they can keep their pizza. I don't support this kind of business.

As I said, the quality is typical Round Table. If you don't care about customer service and what the company does with your personal information, give them a shot.",sOPmVW0bmbb8vwEH5C7FzA,5,2,1,wUL1za74BkQ4-Ns5JG99Uw

5170465,2014-06-06,0,LrO_Xy6lfpbTgFoJcOjY4w,I can't believe I never wrote a review of this location! The lady manager is really nice and the food is always fresh and hot. I've been here so many times I've lost count. I grew up on round tables in California since I was a little girl and now I bring my daughter to round tables. Best pizza ever!!!,LdS7cDvOoCml4U_W5ASBkw,1,0,5,i_tkvbLtY4f5Njc3AP-MOg
5184876,2017-06-14,0,LrO_Xy6lfpbTgFoJcOjY4w,"My wife and I went in to eat the Tuesday night buffet. After paying for the food we went into the larger room to sit and eat. After a few minutes one of the employees comes in to the room, puts a DVD into a player and turns on a children's movie. My wife and I are the only two people in that room. When I ask this employee if, perhaps, we could change the channel to something else, maybe the news. I was told, in no uncertain terms ""NO!!"". ""It's family night and we are REQUIRED to play a children's movie. When I point out that there are NO children in the entire restaurant and, perhaps, we can change the channel and if a child does come in we can, at that point, turn the movie on. That was greeted by rolling of the eyes and another ""NO!!"". Guess the customer is not right at this Round Table Pizza. Oh, BTW, the pizza was not fresh or close to being tasty. The same pizzas that were there when my wife and i came in were still there an hour later. Nothing fresh ever came out of the oven. Looks like I'm going to cross this restaurant off of my dining list.",RBIXQRg9BcPttJ5p-fc31A,0,0,2,Kz-BiDTDZKbQ8JzhwdvNKA

5310967,2014-07-15,0,LrO_Xy6lfpbTgFoJcOjY4w,"I called in for delivery last night because I had no desire to cook. I ordered a large pizza with mushrooms and grilled chicken, some wings, and a flat bread. I was surprised when my door bell rang just 30 mins later. The pizza was good, very generous on the toppings. The flat bread was also good. The fresh mozzarella balls on top were to die for. But I have to admit the wings were the highlight of my meal. I ordered BBQ wings and they were crispy and saucy and everything a chicken wing should be. Ask for specials when you call, if not it can be a little pricey. I found coupons on the website. Definitely worth the extra money though. The quality is much better then any chain pizza restaurant.",lJPJdayggYhqv6jmAdLMBQ,0,0,5,aXGWzdgSff724Eu42Nyrww
5313601,2017-07-02,0,LrO_Xy6lfpbTgFoJcOjY4w,Ordered and paid by credit card over the internet for convenience and security. When pizza arrived the driver demanded my credit card to make an imprint copy. No I'm not handing over my credit card to a pizza kid after I've already paid. Keep your pizza. Drove to the restaurant the next day for a cash refund.,gWefMkkLKh2dXlSigZHnnQ,1,0,1,egIRQg4eL9pqyqd-8LGMuQ
5336995,2016-01-13,0,LrO_Xy6lfpbTgFoJcOjY4w,"Round Table is hands down my fave pizza in town.  I've tried various pies from different places, from chains to independent family joints, and always come back to Round Table. Why?  Because it's just great pizza.  It is a bit pricier than some, although not by much. You get quality pizza.  I love the garlic supreme pizza.  This location is in a shopping plaza in a fairly okay part of town somewhat near Summerlin, it's  always clean and the customer service is  friendly.  If you've never tried Round Table, you really should, you'll be surprised at what a quality pizza this is - the cheese, the crust, the sauce, it's all good.  I even take out of town relatives here who don't have Round Table in their areas and they RAVE about how good this pizza is and always say they wish they had a Round Table.  I'd rather go here than to some no name place where it's a crapshoot as to what the quality will be or some over-hyped ""trendy"" pizza place that overcharges but under-delivers!  I know I'll get my money's worth  and won't be dumping a pizza in the trash or be embarrassed that I brought a friend or relative to eat here.  There's not a huge amount of dining area, but it's been fine any time I've been there.",r1Z8dxSnd7T4XEAhVUoA0Q,0,0,4,gchwbcaU4j7IGdj5e24yxQ

Without thinking much about it, we started going there more and more. And then it dawned on us! We were laughing and saying we're not even supposed to be eating this much pizza, we have to slow down!
The pizza has the right amount of sauce, and topping, and it's always hot when it come to the table.
Thank you to the manager and staff!
You're doing an awesome job!",oQh0pzQpD-b9HO6otOoLog,0,0,5,WHQB9XLYUG8tFJ29bTfuPA

No smile on anyone's face. They simply don't care. There lunch should end at 2.30pm and not 2 pm. If you are one minute late it's not honored. Who does that to a regular customer. They don't even apologize. The management sucks!!!!
Bad customer service.... has happened to me few times. My family has already stopped going there. Now I will tell my friends too.",_cKoWo1BFI7kjAj_opEgmQ,2,0,1,OYwKhp0Odeg1cSmtXyZ5nA
5944960,2014-07-29,0,LrO_Xy6lfpbTgFoJcOjY4w,"First off I was shocked how good there pizza is. Yes it is a zestier pizza sauce, non traditional form of pizza sauce. I was thinking it would of been more like chucky cheese pizza. However I really did like the this style crust alot better then dominos pizza and flavor wise taste better/ fresher. 


However my gripe is the chicken bits and the Polynesian wing sauce, little to no sauce and at times felt like you where eating gristle etc. Recommendation  try chicken wings. 

Pizza was there meat special, and was quite nice. 

They do deliver to 89108 area code if you where looking at places.",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,0,0,4,h1BmZfwadxBAAX7_O4fxhg
