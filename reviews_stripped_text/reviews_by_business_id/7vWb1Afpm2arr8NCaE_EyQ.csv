Bottom line, if you live downtown you should be shopping there. Friendly family service with care and food made with love.",GDrpg98PJMiAMQyvuUEEnQ,0,1,5,Ejf6VAX0SN5pmSz3V7YgvA

Located on the corner of 8th and Ogden Ave.  I am always greeted with a smaile from the employees of the Mart.  They really appreciate the business from all there patrons and it shows.  A friendly staff always makes for a pleasant shopping experience. 

Ogden Mart is my go to starting point for fun festivites in DTLV.  They have a great beer selection and the prices are very reasonable.  The craft beer selection is awesome but they also have the big three choices and a small wine selection available.  They also carry several flavors of my favorite beverage of choice in High School Mad Dog 20/20.  

What makes Ogden Mart special is that they have a sandwich area during lunch.  The bread choices are always fresh and you can get wheat or white sub rolls.  The meats and veggies ares sliced fresh daily and they will make the sandwich just they way you like it.  Seriously I am hooked on these tasty subs.  A great little spot for a quick lunch.  The prices are very reasonable.  I would much rather walk and extra two blocks to go to Ogden Mart instead of the downtown Subway anyday.  

I am reluctant to post this review because now I might have to wait in line for lunch or they might be out of my favorite beer next time I come down to party in DTLV.  I always BYOB when partying.  Why pay more than you have to for a good time.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,3,2,5,21238gpE9IOPbhuOwZZ56Q

Since it is in a part of town that used to be considered ""bad,"" you might initially be swayed to not want to stop here... But you must resist those wussy urges!

This is the BEST place to come for a sandwich! The deli here is so legit. I would even venture to say it's just as good if not better than Subway, and it's a bit cheaper too.

The staff has always joked with me while I was at the counter, and have always been really nice. Lots of crazy characters tend to stop by this place, but everyone is pretty cool. Good people watching LOL.

There are also some random things in here you didn't even realize you needed, like a fedora for the fellas or a straw hat for the ladies.

I came here to buy a foot long sub to split before a trip to Hoover Dam, and it was one of the best I have ever had, no lie.

Cheap prices, quick goods, yummy deli, and friendly service. This place can't be beat!",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,7,5,5,JYqGFpLM2LcnGJbVDjI1dA

Definitely a great neighborhood mart",R8cvfUPw62YykBsJbEeodQ,0,0,5,X3IFWXSy1CMKkX-v1VpZhg
4293837,2015-08-16,0,7vWb1Afpm2arr8NCaE_EyQ,"This place is the best. I work right next door, so I regularly come here for sandwiches/pizza/drinks. The employees here are unbelievably nice, and their sandwiches are always super fresh and well made.

The pizza isn't amazing, but it is the cheapest pizza ever. For 2.99 you get 2 slices, a drink, and a small bag of chips. At that price, it tastes incredible!

I'm so relieved to have a place like this nearby. Whenever I want a reasonable priced sandwich that's better than the overpriced ones, I come here. They're always considerate too, and even make sure to wrap napkins in your sandwich wrap so you have one handy when you unravel the sandwich. They also remember you and pick up conversations you had previously. It's the little things, but this is my favorite local store because of it!",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,1,0,5,opIprSXl1NnXVQzQgUAnhg
5033852,2014-04-25,0,7vWb1Afpm2arr8NCaE_EyQ,"I wish there were more places like Ogden Mart here in Vegas. One of the things I miss about NY is the damn delis (or bodegas, even). I have yet to actually step inside this store, but I've ordered delivery a few times and the deli is solid. Well priced, too. I resort to Subway and its ilk out of pure necessity living here, but I just don't really get why people like those chain sandwich shops. Where I come from, they're for n00b transplants and tourists. Support your local businesses and enjoy your cold cuts freshly sliced! Ogden Deli beats Subway (Quiznos, Port of Subs, etc...) any day of the week.",Uz_0Tcvq5KcF4XQltYKjnw,3,2,5,0LXGawS4oUP_73VdieIOHw
5466766,2014-08-09,1,7vWb1Afpm2arr8NCaE_EyQ,"I am not going to lie, the food is fresh. I ordered a build your own sandwich. I did not get what I wanted. I order meat and cheese with pickles, mayo, salt n pepper. I got meat and check with pickles, tomatoes, onions, salt and pepper. I HATE tomatoes and onions which is why I did not ask for them on there. I am not sure what they were reading cause I did not ask for those. My friend ordered one of their specialty sandwiches, hoping that she would get what was listed on there... nope, she definitely did not. We ordered together to get the free delivery. I would have rather paid for delivery then deal with what we dealt with. We ordered to our work, they said between 1255-105, they showed up early, which normally would be fine if we weren't working. The delivery woman was SOOOOOOO rude, huffing and puffing for having to wait, left and when I called back she was all ""I called 6 times."" um no you didn't. I tipped her too and she was still so rude. Told everyone and their moms how much she hates delivering to where we work. I just was so flabbergasted by their customer service. Not only was our food wrong, but rude people too. No thanks.",2_2fOLZJ8F-wdyKagRRS_Q,0,1,2,zkIMjhnPmqas9386y9P0SQ
