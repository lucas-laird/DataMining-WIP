The food was fresh enough, that was it's primary benefit. I realized it had beans a couple minutes after it was ordered and asked if I could get it without beans. I told them if they'd already made it, that was fine. They told me it was already made. If it was already made though, why did I wait five more minutes for it to come out of the kitchen. The barbacoa leaked grease through its foil wrapper and puddled on the table (no plate was provided).  Despite all that grease, it was oddly flavorless for barbacoa. None of the complex flavors I would hope it would have. The burrito was also poorly constructed so that all the barbacoa was at one end, all the eggs at the other, be in the middle a mash up of a smattering of crema, pico, and beans. In the end, I gave up trying to eat it as a burrito halfway through and ate the filling with a fork.

2564624,2018-03-08,2,Q6kZqLHy-ikjMW-lBCXnKA,"Two stars in the outside world, but three for airport food, and that has to be on a different scale because it's airport food and we all know it's going to be terrible. That said, wow did this place bother me. First let me tell you how much I hate it when people attach themselves to some random word in another language and then use it as a plaything because for anyone who speaks English, all other languages are not real and therefore available for slinging and throwing around, even though it makes you sound like you have Tourette's if you just randomly shout out a word that actually means something to speakers of the other language.

Anyway, that complaint up there is linked to my first photo here, which is of the overhang above their to-go counter: ""to-golé!"" First, get out of here. Second, since I am expert at translating inanities, that is obviously a play on the Spanish expression ""¡Olé!"" Funny enough, though, there is a difference between Spanish the language and Spanish the adjective referring to the nation of Spain, and ""olé"" is a Spanish expression USED IN SPAIN. 

Not in Mexico.

Just to clarify, Mexico is a country in North America whence come tacos, while Spain is a country in Europe whence came conquistadors who created Mexico.

Clear?

Obviously not to the HMSHost family of restaurants (or, like, tons of other people outside the restaurant industry, to be fair), who tried to make a fun, cute play on words that relies on having less of an understanding of Mexican Things 101 than Trump.

I guess I am not surprised by that, because when I sat down and ordered food (hello, I CAN'T choose not to eat somewhere if it's vaguely edible, I'm a celiac in an AIRPORT, for pete's sake), the waiter asked if I wanted it ""Mexican style or American style?"" Seeing my expression, which was a mix of shock and horror, he pointed to the menu, which I unfortunately forgot to photograph, and pointed to a line that explains that you can order your tacos ""Mexican style"" - pickled veggies and pico - or ""American style"" - lettuce and cheese. Obviously I can't see my own face, but I'm pretty sure that after my shock and horror expression, my next one was some kind of mix of ""I hate everything about this"" and ""I'm judging you"" and ""I'm sorry that this is your job."" 

Now the kicker: So as I said, I ordered some ""Mexican-style"" chicken tacos, because those are pretty impossible to screw up. Now, not 90 seconds later--

That's right, FEWER THAN 90 SECONDS LATER, maybe even fewer than 60--

my plate of tacos is handed to me.

And by ""my plate of tacos"" what I obviously mean is ""a plate that was already made and then had my 'Mexican-style' toppings tossed on.""

I am willing to debase myself with cheap food when times call for it, and airport times do call for it, and I'm not too demanding a foodie, but I have never eaten chicken so dry that I actually had to call it that. Like, not ""this chicken was cooked a bit over"" or ""this chicken could stand to be moister"" but actually ""I am a person who ALWAYS cleans her plate and I literally cannot tonight because this dry chicken is stabbing my throat.""

And that is the story of my experience at Tequileria.",ZV5YqHrS0PktUTLT-F0s4w,2,1,3,XGGu68chmm7wF9ZeiOlEVw

$50 for this meal. I would have rather ate fast food.

They did have an extensive bar selection and Pokestops for our nerdy entertainment haha so add one star.",NOq2SPYWZ35EvzxzwVt-kw,0,0,2,I0hshIW1a6CQ4jhDcZlqAg
5255827,2017-10-19,0,Q6kZqLHy-ikjMW-lBCXnKA,This place was terrible and tasted like everything was out of a can. I could have made better food at home. The chips are very salty and have to be straight out the bag. Our waiter was very unfocused. The cheese was not even melted in the burrito. Nothing special about this place at all.,V-izfOO9Pyh_zNLsn7JASg,0,0,1,fdHfJDZgbQb9fz6vOIIffQ
5287276,2017-09-28,0,Q6kZqLHy-ikjMW-lBCXnKA,Food here is awfulness served with death. The beans taste like dirt and spice. The huevos rancheros we're watered down salsa with old tortilla and potatoes. Don't waste your time or money.,fo5pBMMEmeXQtwPb5vXcDw,0,0,1,Ziao489VK7z3U_D2TjVBcw
5499224,2018-02-10,1,Q6kZqLHy-ikjMW-lBCXnKA,I had a really good experience here and thought the burrito was really good. I got the vegan burrito Mexican style and it taste really fresh and tasty. Along with a beer or filled me up and hit the spot. The waitress was really nice and checked I. On me several times. Yeah it wasn't cheap but it is at an airport what do you expect... also it was really good for airport food..,FA4Pgqv4AjeEOp0vZFfbEA,1,2,5,Bcb1IVCm_Q-vqrHW7ELCIw
5568397,2016-06-26,0,Q6kZqLHy-ikjMW-lBCXnKA,"I had a long wait at the airport so I decided to have dinner here instead of doing something fast.  You seat yourself and then the waitress comes over.  I only waited for a few minutes for someone to come by. She took my drink order and then came back with the drink and took my dinner order.  I had the fish tacos.  They had a nice breaded fish in them, lots of cabbages and other toppings.  Nice chips and salsa too.  Not too bad for an airport restaurant.  I definitely will be back if I have time during another airport visit.",VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ,0,0,4,jfQbtAQS6BMRyU-Fe3bJiw
