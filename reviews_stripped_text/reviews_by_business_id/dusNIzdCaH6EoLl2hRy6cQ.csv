I love the chicken bowl which has rice, beans ( I usually get it without beans because I hate beans), your choice of salsa, sour cream and lots of lettuce. I also love their chicken salad with the sauce they give you makes it just right.
They do offer other meat besides chicken like steak, carnitas, Barbacoa. No worries if your vegetarian they have the veggie burrito or bowl.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,1,4,hhoyV9Kw4i5SeT5EwvQrXA

Other than that food is still great, price is reasonable. I'm glad you can order online now too.  
Unfortunately,  I would agree with some of the remarks about customer service yes it needs to be improved.  One lady rushed me at the register she didn't apply my coupon and said ""sorry no one can fix it, come next time"". I was not happy with her carelessness and response- and yes I did tell her to her face- what's up with the rush it wasn't like there was any line of customers behind me, so I had to pay full price for her lousy service!  That coupon was the reason I came twice in a week and no I did not come back to use it again.   Another incident, they stated their steak was well cooked when visually anyone with eyes can see it was bloody red.   I told them I have ordered the steak a hundred times before and never seen it THAT rare, red but they insisted! They did not offer to recook it out of laziness or lying about how the steak is usually ""cooked""  so I had to make another choice for myself.  Another incident is ordering something with or without and they give you an attitude so it's like hey wth it's my food lol!  Really not impressed with the attitudes of the staff that I've encountered in the Vegas Chipotles.  Improve please!  Cuz I've got an eye opener there are many mexican fast food grills out there.

As an avid Chipotle fan who has tried Chipotle just about everywhere (and believe me, ingredients and quality vary greatly), I've picked four of my favorite ones. This is number 3.


Chipotle - Las Vegas Strip next to Harrah's

You wouldn't go to Las Vegas to eat Chipotle. However, I must say after a day of buffets, steaks, seafood, and an impressive gambling debt, Chipotle seems mighty good.

This Chipotle is located toward the middle of the strip, and I'm very impressed by the quality of the ingredients given their location. The peppers/onions combo in the fajita mix is very fresh and actually tastes like they just cut it up and put it into your food. The prices are reasonable even though they have the opportunity to raise it, and there's nothing like getting Chipotle late into the evening when you want to satisfy those midnight Las Vegas munchies.

This location shares the floor space with other restaurants (like a mini food court). Don't try the other places. The opportunity cost is too great.",GXsP8SZ_IDvZiu32kNMi0A,2,1,4,aaUTHraaLA8MdycN6np7_g

When I went there there were signs saying that they don't have their normal chicken due to shortages and that they didn't have any more corn salsa because of another problem. Sucked but didn't change much in terms of taste.

Prices were a bit more than I was used to paying at Chipotle but I'm totally fine paying that in Vegas.

I was looking forward to my second visit to Chipotle in my life and it happened to appear like a message from God after a long walk on the strip. The workers on the ""burrito"" line were great...except for the last two. One girl wrapped up your burrito in foil and the other wrote on them and prepared them for the cashier. The girl wrapping the burritos seemed like a robot and therefore didn't notice that every piece of pre-cut foil was a little too small to wrap the full burrito. This left a small 1/2 inch by 2 inch exposed area on the burrito. That's OK (I thought) as she finished wrapping, but then the retard flipped the burritio upside down and the next employee in line just slid the burrito down the counter to the cashier! SOOOO GROSS. You could tell they had a ""rhythm"" going as it was busy (as I'm sure it always is since it's on the strip). So once I told her there was no way in hell i was eating a burrito that had been slid on a counter all the way to the cashier, she seemed upset but ordered another burrito to be made right away. Then, I get to the cashier and order myself a Corona with my burrito. Corona pops on the counter but with a disgusting lime. It wasn't even a faint shade of green, it was brown and way squishy. Almost the consistency of playdoh. I'm not about to drink herpes in a bottle so I explained that the lime was near compost quality and the same lady that I complained about the burrito to went fishing in the lime bin. She came out with another lime that had a brown bruise on the skin and said ""They all look like that"" and I took it, because I am well aware of the bruising habits of limes in particular since Coronas are like water in my life. I could have debated on the difference between the first lime I received and the second, but I was hungry and really needed to start chugging the beer after my experience.

Looking for a pre-show meal, we saw the nearby choices of A)McDonald's, B)Panda Express or C)Chipotle.  Considering I don't like McDonald's, Panda Express is on my usual restaurant rotation & I haven't had Chipotle in a few years, the time was ripe to give Chipotle another go.

My choice - the barbacoa bowl.  

My 2 cents - It was..........how do I put this?  Boring.  Boring like the scene in ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"" where Ben Stein is going ""Anyone..........?  Anyone.........? Beuller........?Beuller.........?""  Boring like having a CSPAN viewing party on Valentine's Day.  Nothing says ""sexytime"" than Senate hearings in HD;p

Now, it wasn't bad, per se.  It's just, as I get older, I want my tastebuds to be titillated!  (I just said ""titillated"" *giggle*)  The portions were good.  The price was reasonable.  Also, kudos to the staff for efficiently moving the big Las Vegas line along.  Wait was minimal.  To me, I'd rather go to a local taqueria for some authentic and cheap fare, w/o the line of hipsters, Beliebers and Twi-hards.  

Chipotle is situated in a primo location to lure in the tourists.  The restaurant was clean and the staff knows how to handle the crowds coming in for sustenance, like me.  

Chipotle has it's fans, and more power to them for liking what they like.  I may return if I'm walking by, the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's convenient and the prices are reasonable, considering the dining options in the casinos.

Its good that you can have the same tasty food rite on the vegas strip. for a veggie burrito its the same price as you get anywhere and just 25c more for the chicken fajita one ..yummy. Dont expect the same sitting place and like the normal chipotle ..but quality is same so enjoy the burrito in heart of vegas strip :) ...,t5dfwPEdTd64lyKf-ivw-g,0,0,4,N4ACW_sPXu9-K0TBQU6o-w

I am not one to make a scene and the workers looked pissed off as hell from dealing with tourist all day so I didn't complain and just picked some other toppings. 

I found a seat thank goodness to sit down. I tried the rice and of course hated it so I ate only partly one side of my burrito. What a waste

Unlike what other Yelpers have said, I thought the portion size was fine. Not super generous but I got solid 2 scoops of meat and they didn't hesitate to give me more grilled veggies when I asked. The chicken I got was flavorful and tender, and everything tasted pretty fresh.

Location isn't the best though. It's in the food court in the Venetian canal shops, which is kind of tucked in a back area that my friend and I completely missed.

There must be new management or the staff that was working on my most recent visit were just plain stingy.

So PLEASE do explain how it is that you think it is okay not to provide guests with extra ingredients when this is a standard courtesy throughout the other locations. 

Say hello to the SMALLEST and stingiest plate of food I have ever ordered. I am honestly so shocked that they had the audacity to try and charge people for that.
