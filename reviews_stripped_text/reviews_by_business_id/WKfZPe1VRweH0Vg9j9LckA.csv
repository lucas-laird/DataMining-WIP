897124,2014-08-25,0,WKfZPe1VRweH0Vg9j9LckA,"I went to this location today.    I spotted 2 major problems with this location.     I ordered an 8 piece family meal, with 2 sides.    I paid for my order,  when I looked over the bill,  I saw a .39 charge.  When inquired about it,  I was told by the lady behind the counter that is a SERVICE CHARGE for using a DEBT CARD.   I told her my card was a VISA / DEBT card.   she continues and say's when the card is swiped the machine automatically takes these types of cards as DEBT cards.  I told her that is because you didn't press the correct button on the POS system to take the charge as as CREDIT charge.    She said NO she CANNOT CHANGE IT BECAUSE THE CARD SCANNER READS IT AUTOMATICALLY, and she cannot change it.      I never in my life heard of this.   After writing this review I will be writing to the KFC franchise and address this issue.      My 2nd problem MY ORDER WAS WRONG.     No manager on duty.

 There was a new employee being trained by another and I was completely blown away! I was originally going to get my food to go but wanted to see if the service from this trainer was consistent. I sat around the corner to be out of site & out of mind. This was true for the rest of the staff as they eventually got loud and seemed like they forgot there was a guest in the restaurant. The trainer was on top of things and even notified the drive thru worker whenever someone pulled up. 

Training is the time to be over-the-top and he did phenomenal. Great job!!!",kUWSyr7NuHCzLYr8OImSCg,0,0,5,CVtt_xUeJMYrEFWwzbctIw

So I ask her if I could place an order, and her lover who doesn't work there tells me, the girl that will take my order went to throw the trash. She should have taken him with her and thrown him in there too. So lover girl calls another guy, who comes up with an attitude, and just stared at me for a second then asks me what I would like. Two chicken pot pies please, he looks at me with a blank stare, then asks me if I want to wait, we don't have any right now, it'll take about twenty five minutes.

1948985,2016-07-28,1,WKfZPe1VRweH0Vg9j9LckA,"This was by far the worst experience I've had with fast food EVER! I rarely eat fast food but in this particular day I was in a hurry and I stopped here on my way back to work. The drive-thru was pretty standard no concerns with the customer service. 

When I returned back to work I pulled a hot wing out of my box and proceeded to eat. After about to chews I felt something by my chin and I assumed it was a piece of lent or something. I wiped my chin and felt something going across it. I immediately noticed it was a hair. I instantly spit the food in my hand and pulled out the longest piece of hair I've ever seen in anyone's food. I was sooooo disgusted! I left the hair in the box and called the store location. I spoke with a manager by the name of Kevin. I explained to him what I discovered and he went on to say that the hot wings are frozen. I told him that doesn't stop hair from.landing on them and being fried. He offered to replace the meal and I told him it wouldn't be today but I'd definitely return. 

I returned 3 days later (today) in lunch and pulled in the drive thru and told another manager what the situation was. He asked me for the managers name and I didn't have it on me. I went back to my job (right behind KFC) retrieved the information from my desk and returned, this time going inside. 

The inside wasn't clean at all and the soda machine was not working. I brought to the workers attention you may need to change the filter bc it was really flat and she said yea I know. Well don't you think you should have a sign up stating out of order? Any who, after showing the other supervisor my proof and also my call log my meal was finally replaced. He told me Kevin didn't write me name down as he told me he did. 

After waiting over 10 minutes I finally got my meal and vowed to myself I would take time out to share this review.",PSKqBmr5xgnRBvFR5dO09A,0,0,1,9UiOltXjKutoDnA_mRk4aA

They keep forgetting the biscuit in the meals or not asking me which dipping sauce I'd like with what I order, so that's a big bump down.  I usually find out after I get home, and since it's not the main part of the meal I don't bother going back.

Checked the bag as my husband was driving and they forgot one of our sides and all of our sauces :( I thought maybe she just forgot to enter one of them as a meal, so I checked the receipt but we were charged for them. Also, as I was looking at the receipt I noticed that the bottom half of it was ripped off. The part where they give you a code to fill out a review of the service in exchange for a free go cup. Kinda sketchy but it could have just been an honest mistake. 

Since we were stopped at the red light we just made a U-turn and came inside to ask for our missing food. The dude up front just handed it to us without a word--no apology or anything for that matter lol.

And I'm pretty sure they gave us a smaller size popcorn chicken than we paid for, but it's a fast food restaurant so I won't give too harsh of a rating.. :P",nbLYmUvi9uYIZy64TvcRyw,2,0,3,hd0yUY23tsuLu853URnDsw

Employees look slovenly and unkept. It is apparent that employees have no interest in providing any sort of customer service.

5801126,2009-05-19,3,WKfZPe1VRweH0Vg9j9LckA,"KFC. What I thought was always a dependable source of decent, quick and tasty fried chicken has lost some of its pull when they decided to offer the grilled chicken alternative. 

I can understand in a business stand-point on why they started to offer the grilled selection. I don't see how they are actually cooking the chicken itself and if it is truly grilled as they claim. 

When I bit into one of these ""grilled"" chickens, it was almost the texture of a rubber tire and as greasy as their fried counter-parts. The portion was quite small and the taste was far from anything grilled that I have tasted before. It did have some fake grill lines as to promote that they are actually grilled. I beg to differ.

I remember when they used to serve a roasted chicken selection which was a huge favorite for myself and some of my friends, however, they discontinued it a long time ago and never brought it back. I really miss it. 

So what is KFC doing exactly? I have no clue. The executive team probably thought it was a brilliant idea to bring grilled chicken to compete with El Pollo Loco or some other similar grilled chicken joint. They need to stick to what they know best and continue to make a good product. KFC also seemed to have modernized their stores a bit. I find it a little odd, but ok I will take it. 

As for a fried chicken fast food joint, KFC still takes the cake as far as taste goes. I just hope they don't make stupid blunders like this whole marketing campaign to try their rubbery, tasteless, heaping pile of crap they decided was their ""hot"" new product.",VUrTgQhEB4Vo04xbnNiNyQ,3,2,2,2gltmr1GE2C1X_61bF9ygQ
