I payed for a table and when got there he told me that the tables were not purchased online. I even showed him my ticket. If you know you do not have the equipment, professionalism to deal with your guest and the space; you obviously have to go to a business school like I am that can help you develop that skill.

Los boletos del concierto claramente dice que el SHOW EMPIEZA a las 9pm - llegamos y resulta que el show no va a empezar si no hasta la 1am. Como es permitido engañar así????  Como se permite este tipo de engaño?!

Solo estoy en este lugar por la banda musical. Nunca mas vendré aquí.",MZtszJZtdzCZ9E4Fk7DmKw,1,1,1,DqF8MZ08u0e8RhYavSBIAg

It is a bit far from the Strip but has plenty of great security staff and free parking available. I have never seen fights or disrespect at this place. It may look a little run down but you will enjoy the atmosphere. Go for it!,0veuc7F8faTvxIOpfJhhDQ,0,0,4,IhAoPoQZko1muu0DjQ-VLg

Music was good but that's about it hole in a wall in another words!!! The guy bartender will try to play you and give you different prices for the same drink. He TRIED doing that 3 times with me and my friends. Never again. Go to the Spanish spot on the strip by the Linq.,bFtJiEkvSclMHjIVfJCoZg,1,2,1,_hgAzLK2mOd1764DgtqXTg

Music sucked, place was dirty, and security guards were total assholes making fun of my weight. To be completely honest, they have no room commenting on other people's appearance when they themselves should lay off the beer and all the rest of the crap they ingest.

Also this is a Latin venue playing all types of dance music so of course people are going to want to dance and my group got told not to dance! What?!?!

When I called earlier they said frank would come out 12-12:30. The man did not come out until 2:20am by then I didn't even care about seeing him anymore but stayed until about 3:15. 

Bad service too. Saw someone with a table have to come to the bar to grab ice because they didn't have a server.",XOCyTfXy26xi4gZeun9v9w,5,2,1,7vsP1bRSvB5GrvxgzG8oTA
