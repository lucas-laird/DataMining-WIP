23663,2013-11-16,0,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"1 star is too much for this place. No flavor, lack of seasoning, & low quality ingredients are the reoccurring theme at this overpriced Resturant .  First off , They charge you for chips n salsa which is free at virtually every Mexican Resturant . The salsa is bland & no flavor.  
The ceviche trio was NOT fresh n we had to send back. The Chef try's to get too creative with his ceviche recipes as one is more disgusting n lacking flavor or seasoning as the next.  Way overpriced fajitas , which once again had zero flavor , no seasoning and very low quality meat (steak). They basically give u about 7-8 pieces of very fatty meat and load up on the vegetables and get u for $18. The chicken quesadilla literally smelled like that stuff u find between ur toes. We basically ate almost nothing and they credited us for most of the food. When the waitress agrees that the quality had gone done hill fast , it's never a good sign. Would never go back even if they comped the entire meal . I'm embarrassed for this place and the Mgr. seems so aloof to the problems . There are way better places to eat in Las Vegas for the same $$ , don't waste ur time n money at this place.",aahxmN1tsvlufuU_y4OT1A,3,0,1,BTLaEpI29sOiaNinq7cBcg

She was great and on top of everything. Her leadership was impressive. She greeted my colleagues and I with a great smile and attitude. 
We were a party of 5 and while she was trying to get someone to do it nobody did it, so she said give me a minute let me set up your table. The hostess had it ready in no time. She got the menus, explained it to us as well as the happy hour menu and gave us a few suggestions on dishes. She always had a smile on, even when it was really busy.  
We decided to go again the next day and the hostess was there again.  We requested the same table and she set it up for us and welcomed us back. Even though we took up the table for quite a while.

I ordered the Watermelon Margarita and it was extremely good!  Most margarita's I had in Vegas were way too sweet, but this one was perfect.  
We also ordered chips and salsa - again, very good.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was spicy!

Our meals (beef & chicken enchiladas) were very very bland.  After the spicy salsa with the chips and our server's warning of some spice in the meal, we were expecting something...but seriously - nope.  No spice, no flavor, bland, bland, bland.

We had the $5 prickly pear margaritas, which were actually pretty good as well as chips and guacamole.  The guac was nothing to write home about but was decent.

That's the only rational explanation 

Because its not the chips, I've had better, and looking at the salsa its nothing special, looks like some regular old fire roasted fare. 

But then you taste it, damnnnnn, before you know it you're on your third cup of it. 

I've been coming here every Vegas trip for years, they must have a high turnover as far as staff goes becuase I don't recognize one person each time. Its a little cheesy watching the singing gondolas go by while you're drinking overpriced Don Juilio Real and munching on the chips and salsa, but hey its Vegas. 

Back to the salsa, because as far as the food goes, we're spolied in L.A., we get better mexican food at little holes in the wall and at home than we do in these high end joints.

I realized by coming here why I didn't like mussels before.  It's because most places don't use fresh mussels.  This place does.  There is absolutely no fishiness at all.  Just sweet tasty morsels.  I know they use fresh mussels because on a recent trip there I wasn't able to order them because the supplier didn't have any that day.  The main course are ok.  Nothing to write home about.

They open from 8 - 11:30 am daily. The location of the restaurant is also very nice as it's next to the canal so you could pretend that you're in Venice. Some tables even have umbrellas shading the customers from the fake blue sky to give it that extra appeal. 

I felt like the menu contained a good variety for breakfast. There were pancakes, steak and eggs, and the traditional eggs, bacon, and potatoes. But there were also traditional Mexican staples as well. I got an order of the Huevos Rancheros ($13). The rest of the party got the Canonita BLT ($10), which came with eggs, poblano peppers, bacon, black beans, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, chiptole aoili, and Texas toast; the Steak and Eggs ($20); and the Canonita Omelette ($12), which came with Monterey Jack, peppers, poblano chiles, and red onions. 

The huevos rancheros were alright but nothing special. My food did not seem to be hot when it came to me. It made the tortilla a bit more difficult to eat because it hardened more. Perhaps it was sitting at the window for a little bit longer, as the waiter for all the entrees to come out? Also, the waiter did not ask for preference when it came to the steak and eggs. The steak was a little more well done than liked.

Overall, service was slow. We were one of four other parties there for breakfast and we got there at 9, a good hour after they have opened. Our waiter was not very attentive and seemed to be out of sight most of the time. Took us a while to get the check as well. The food was decent but nothing super spectacular. I've had better.

This time food wasn't great, it was okay, and service was bad.

We made a reservation for 6 at 8:15.  I was really hungry, so I suggested to the group that we go a little early to see if we could get in.  I know that on some occasions ( i.e. when restaurants are busy) that just doesn't work, which would have been fine.  However, there were a total of 3 tables occupied in the restaurant and when we walked up to say we were a little early, they looked at us like, ""how dare you!""

It then took about ten minutes for one man to set up 6 sets of utensils, while three other servers stood around. Also, the hosts didn't smile at all. 

Our server was nice and helpful about the menu, but the food and drinks still came out slower than we would have hoped.

Finally, the reason I only give this place one star is because when I checked my checking account balance, my debit card was charged $16 more than it should have been!

Highlight 1: Their guacamole. It's the best I've ever had. Granted, I don't have an especially extensive knowledge/experience with guac, but I found it to be extremely tasty. Definitely worth it to spend the small added cost to have it with your chips & salsa.

Highlight 2: Cheese fundido. I'd never had this before dining at Cañonita so I have no basis of comparison, but it is definitely delicious. You can add a meat to the cheese (we did chicken once), but I thought it tasted just as good plain, with no meat added.

Highlight 3: Service. This is a casual dining restaurant at the Venetian, but the service is still top notch. Every server I've had has been very polite, friendly, and helpful.

I've never had any of the alcoholic beverages here, so I can't vouch for Cañonita in that department, but I've liked everything I've ordered here. This place has become one of my go-to restaurants for Mexican food in Las Vegas.",geefcHVSPHVdBsquWJJsbQ,0,0,4,qX1FXd5Zv6GNevr0J5MPNg

He also gave us a free pitcher of beer from an order mistake so that was cool. We only tried the chips and salsa.

I had the carne asada, which was delicious. Did I have a lobster tail with it? ...I'm sure it was delicious if I did.

633333,2013-12-30,0,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"Don't be deceived anymore. This place just isn't what it used to be. Not by a long shot. I've been coming here for the last 9 years or so. It had been about 2-3 years since I had been to vegas (moved to Macau) I visited last night and I cant explain how disappointed I was in the quality and taste of food now compared to before. 

Flying in from Macau, I thought the first place I will stop at seeing how my hotel is in the Venetian will be Canonita, I had been craving the Chili Relleno for years. Our server asked if we had been here before we said yes. We placed our orders, got a taco platter for appetizer, margaritas, chille relleno, and the barbacoa. The barbacoa and margaritas were pretty much the same, but the taco platter was changed for the worse. And the relleno was just plain disgusting now. It went from being their best dish in my opinion to the worst. I'm really not sure what happened to this place, it looks a lot more corporate now and just was lacking these authentic flavors that it possessed in previous years. 

The quality has gone down a lot and we dont know if thats because there is some new chefs or if the chefs just stopped trying. The taco platter took off at least one taco from the previous years and replaced it with ""carnitas."" The carnitas tasted like plastic and had the texture of it as well. I took one bite and its obvious they load it with that salsa on top to give it all the flavor because the meat was lacking taste. 

Overall im giving it a 2 star rating now because the margaritas were fine (hard to mess up a margarita) and the barbacoa for keeping the same recipe. But honestly, we wont be dining here again until they bring back the delicious relleno with nuts and fruits inside. I cant be the only one who thinks this new rendition is disgusting.

As many other reviewers commented, if you go, it can be nice to sit in the fake ""outside"" by the canal.  And my meal started in a pleasant enough fashion, with the previously-mentioned good margarita and chips and salsa.

But everything fell apart when my entree came out.  Chicken enchiladas are pretty difficult to screw up, but they somehow found a way to do so.  This was the most bland Mexican food I ever tasted in my life.  Diner meatloaf in southern Indiana is more interesting.  The black beans tasted like water.  I'm not joking.  Water.  The ""cilantro rice"" tasted like it just came out of the boil-in-a-bag.  The ""queso fresco"" on top of the enchiladas certainly didn't taste like any kind of real cheese.  And the enchiladas themselves were skimpy on the chicken and heavy on the lettuce (a clear cost-saving measure).  Oh, and yes, the chicken also didn't even taste like anything. 

And of course, if you just want the 'rita, save yourself having to tip your sever and get your drink in the food court location of this restaurant that's steps away from the location by the ""canal"".",CAJi-qGaLZ2Wz8SkZt5GHQ,0,0,1,bzcqU04wYXbzbyYMsWhX5w
865663,2009-03-31,0,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"Freshly off the plane and having checked in at the Palazzo, we headed over here for some lunch. I had read this place boasts of a nice view, so we walked over from the Palazzo. First off, it was quite confusing to get here, we asked for directions several times, since the path from Palazzo to Venetian is a bit of a maze. But once we walked into this beautiful fake piazza looking area, with bridges and gondolas we were in awe. 

We wished we could have sat right next to the canal at this place but they reserve the canal view for tables for two. We were still able to enjoy the ""fake"" sights ""outside"". We ordered a pitcher of margaritas that our waiter had recommended which had Grand Manier, and boy was that strong! 

We each got the taco platter which comes with three tacos you can choose from (you can mix and matches them too), and also comes with cillantro rice and beans. 

I got the pork, beef and fish tacos. The pork was a bit dry, but the mango salsa on top was to die for! The beef tacos were my favorite- moist and flavorful. The fish ones had the mango salsa as well and were also very good. You could also choose the kind of tortilla, but unfortunately, I don't think they serve hard shell tacos which I personally love.

Their tomato salsa was also very delicious (and cheap) so I would recommend putting in an order of those. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful for the most part, though they were reluctant to allow us to charge our bill on 6 credit cards even though we were splittling the bill evenly. Eventually the informed us they would accomodate our request ""just this once"", but that it might take them a while to do so.",4ZPxHxEfLcVFJoFhGAuc2w,0,0,3,LWMoj25u1qq9yIvAwoPNLw

Everything on the menu looked good and so did all the plates we saw. We did choose to get their $29.99 app, entree, and dessert. Good value there. Salads were big and very fresh, the tortilla-esque  soup had good kick to it, enchiladas were perfect, and the desserts were perfectly portioned and tasty.

Drinks were actually pretty well priced for Vegas...obviously not considering all the free ones you can get on the casino floor. Mojitos are good and well sized for $9 and their sangrias, especially the white, are top notch.

Great casual restaurant but nothing in paticular stood out to me to make it a 5 star. Great casual place to stop for a walking break and snack. 

Spend-o-meter: We spent $80 with drinks but really the 2 full 3 course meals were $29ea.
Value: If you pass on alcohol than it's a great value...alcohol probably takes it just outside of good value. 
Will I go back: Yes...too many good looking dishes I wanted to try. Their salsas and guac seem to make a good impression on everyone.

Definitely not my favorite of my time in Vegas, but a decent meal. Not quite sure I'd give it only 2 stars, but it's not truly a 3, though their Cilantro Rice made me feeling generous. 

We started our meal with the following apps:
Chips, Salsa and Guacamole. Salsa was good- fresh, hint of spice, tomato based salsa. The Guacamole...ok. I'm not too keen of tomatoes in my guac. I prefer it to be simple- garlic, lime, cilantro & onion, it was just ok.
Queso Fundido w/ Chorizo- My fave of the apps- Slightly spiced, ooey, gooey cheesy dip mixed with crumbled chorizo sausage and served with warm tortillas. Yum!
Pork Empanadas- Crisp pockets of shredded seasoned pork

For my main dish I chose the Tres Tacos with the Grilled Chicken, Grilled Fish and Crispy Pork Belly. The chicken was pretty basic- grilled citrus flavored chicken amply piled into the soft taco shell. The Grilled Fish- my least favorite- had an odd overly fishy taste. I didn't get sick from it, so I don't think it was bad, but it was poorly flavored. I'm not sure what they put on it, but perhaps they should just stick to some S&P and grill, leave it simple. The Crispy Pork Belly- well...it wasn't very crispy. I was definitely expecting something different. Something closer to a bacon texture? The Pork, with a nice smoky flavor, was tender but didn't have that crisp sear I was hoping for especially given the description, but still tasty. 
The highlight of this dish? The Cilantro Rice! WOW! I loved this stuff! What a great fresh, light taste! It had the familiar light and fluffy texture of mexican rice, but was tinged green from the cilantro and had this great herbaceous, savory cilantro flavor! Had I known about this rice, I would have nixed the beans for sure! This rice along earned it the additional 3rd star :) 

The service was friendly and the food came out timely though we did have to flag down our server to get refills. 

With a plethora of options in Vegas, I'll definitely pass on this one on my future visits, overall a 2.5 star review, but that rice! So delish, for me earned that extra 1/2 star.",fF96J8EaHKFoIecd2MHmnA,0,0,3,NWz6Bt-MMPvt2er4l15K-w

1211334,2012-03-08,2,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"I'm somewhat shocked that this place averaged 3 1/2 stars.  Coming from Los Angeles, I've had my fair share of Mexican food.  From the hole in the one senora style to even the finer dining version of Mexican restaurants, this place was not too shabby. 
First of all, the location is a hit. Right by the canal for viewers to watch gandolas go by, it's a perfect setting. 
Then, munch on some nachos with their salsa and guacamole while sipping on some fruity margarita, dinner seemingly sounds better.
We feel the buzz from our delicioso margaritas so we go the high route and order the most expensive dish on the menu - the AZTEC BONE IN NY STEAK.  It came with the the crab cornbread with truffle butter.  Lets just say that the crab cornbread with the truffle bread saved this order because this side dish was worth going home to write about.  As for the steak, if you love overdosing on sodium or you just came out of a sweaty and exhausting basketball game, then this over salty steak is just for you!  For folks who don't crave that saltiness (that's me), I would not recommend this dish.  We had to ask for it to be redone and the waitress was extremely nice about it.  I can tell the chef or cook was snooty about this because the 2nd steak we got back had absolutely no flavor, just the meat itself.  You can tell easily what the chef was thinking when he was told that the customer didn't like his steak.
I was a big fan of the cornbread.  If you think the cornbread is worth $37 and you have money to dispose, I would give this order a shot.
And so what the steak came out overly salty and then the second one came out tame.  We had the salt from our margarita glasses that we used to pick and press onto our flavorless steak and made the most out of it.

All in all, the cornbread, the margarita, chips and salsa and the setting was good.  Just not the salty and unsalty steaks.  If you're looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas, try Border Grill at The Mirage.",cMgGj2FXHEbzdNZdLN_EwA,2,1,2,S0cZxM9CmQorsiYZgeOBuw

Not wanting to spend an arm and leg for the lamb brains served at Mario Batali's (ew!) we decided to go to Taqueria Canonita instead.

I see this as a sort of fusion restaurant - mixing Mexican traditions with  European and American cooking techniques to make something that is new and affordable while still being special. It made me think of what might be eaten in Mexico City for  a normal (and maybe a bit bourgeois) night out. Instead of covering everything in greasy cheeses and diced tomatoes, the Taqueria Canonita emphasizes different tastes of Mexican cuisine put together in unique ways.

We had:
Queso Fundido con Raja - a favorite of ours, we always get it at Lindo Michoacan. The tortillas were handmade and divine. The cheese was top-notch, but not too stringy.

Enselada de Cangrejo - salad with lump blue crab meat and a creamy jalapeno dressing. Honestly, what's not to like?

Michoacan Pork Chop - Wow! Just... wow. The pork chop was juicy, tender, and delicious. The reduction over the mushroom hominy (polenta/grits) was magical. 

Tequila - served in a beautiful glass and a full selection of blancos, repasados and anejos. 

Mojito - admittedly, not a Mexican drink. But I don't care. It rocked my socks.

Also, the service was excellent and very friendly. We sat on the ""patio"" which gave us a nice view of the ""canal"" and the singing gondola folks.",Uw-v0UN_g_oFvldC7HWXMg,0,0,5,h7xnQ9cFXO3UKpaP6XeF0g

After Phantom of the Opera, we decided to stop and have a drink. We decided to go to Taqueria Canonita because we can sit next to the canals and watch the gondaliers. We have also eaten here in the past and the food was very good.

The hostess was very friendly and promptly seated us next to the canal. We waited for quite awhile before the waiter came over to bring water, it went south from here. He took the drink order and we never saw him again. The manager delivered our drinks, brought the water we had originally requested and that was the extent of our service.

This was very disappointing as the restaurant was by no means full. The waiter never checked back in nor did the manager. He dropped the check on the table without even stopping and was observed chit chatting over off to the side while tables were being ignored. We left cash to cover the drinks, no tip.

Although the food is good, and the ambiance of being next to the canal is nice, the service of an eatery speaks volumes to me. I doubt I will ever go back. If I treated my clients with that same type of service I would be out of business. Maybe they ought to think of that, my bill pays your wages, without a client you won't have a job. Enough preaching.

Canonita describes itself as Mexican soul food and I just didnt taste it. Whenever I try a place for the first time I like to stick with the basics- if a Mexican restaurant can impress me with great tasting tacos then I'll venture out and try the mole, sopes and enchiladas. Well they didn't impress me with the Tres Tacos. I think when the server told me they came with salsa already on them I knew something was amiss. I asked for the salsa on the side because often times the salsa will hide the flavor of the whole taco and to be honest I've never had a taco come with salsa on it. Thats like covering a flat iron steak in A1. 

 The entree arrived with 3 tacos and one hot, dried out lime, rice, beans and salsas on the side and to my surprise the cilantro and red onions were on the side as well! Yes, red onions on a taco. The beans were awful- lacked flavor and were hard. The cilantro rice was good but seemed like a waste to even bother eating it. The chicken taco was dry- dear god- was it a dry taco. The corn tortillas are made in house, but I'd never had a tortilla like that. It had the sturdiness and dryness of a corn tortilla and the softness of a flour tortilla. My mouth was perplexed. The carne asada taco was just as dry, but their saving grace was the pork taco. Its hard to find dry pork so they get a pass on that one. I expected more flavors for a $4 dollar taco at such a nice restaurant. 

The margarita was good but short on ice and a bit too sweet and I drink the same margarita everywhere I go- on the rocks, no salt. Perhaps that's just personal preference. In closing, I'll never understand how a server disappears when it comes time to present a check, pick up the check and return with the change. This place was no different but I wasn't on a schedule so I was fine waiting and waiting and waiting.

I don't like soggy food - ever. The sangria margarita is not good (Sangria is supposed to be sweet which is a nice counterbalance to your margarita.

The manager saw us staring at the chef and brought us two fresh hot tortillas to have. That sold us! They were so delicious and the people were so nice we decided to sit down. 

They have a great happy hour! $5 drinks! We got two each of the RumChata and the PassionFuit Margarita. Both delicious drinks!! You have to like Horchata to like the Rumchata.

Annaliza reached out to me after learning of my experience dining at the restaurant. I was very impressed by her genuine concern over the issues I had experienced while dining there and her overall commitment and enthusiasm for the restaurant, as well as her assurance in setting the highest standards of service. She changed my views and opinions of the restaurant for the better. I'm just very pleased with how she directly dealt with the problem herself, as well as her high level of professionalism, which she maintained throughout. I wish more managers possessed the same integrity and passion for their business and genuine care and concern for clients as Annaliza does. There is a great deal of assurance in knowing that a highly respectable and hard-working person is managing a business. Should something fall short or anything be less than perfect, I believe that Annaliza will take up the task herself and resolve the issue immediately, as she has done so with me. That is just the type of person she is. How she runs the restaurant is very reassuring to a customer such as myself because she seems to listen and truly values and respects the views and experience of all dining guests. It is something I both appreciate and admire about this manager. I am certain that she lets nothing slip by because of the way in which she oversaw and personally handled my issue. It leaves me to wonder how I had an issue in the first place, as Annaliza seems very involved in ensuring that every aspect of the business runs smoothly. I am glad that such a caring, dedicated, and competent person is the one behind all operations at Canonita. She has proven to be an effective GM and is quick to act against problems and resolves all issues almost immediately. I am convinced that she and her team work hard and tirelessly on all trajectories in order to make the restaurant what it is and are very eager to please their patrons and meet the expectations of every customer. I can also now say with a certain level of confidence, that Canonita is a fine restaurant under the good care of a manager who genuinely values each one of her customers and who carries a deep respect for her business. She has certainly earned my appreciation and respect. I felt it appropriate to express my gratitude in the same professional and caring manner that Annaliza had shown me. I only hope that this amended review matches up to the degree of respect and kindness with which she had extended to me. I now have a very different and positive impression of the restaurant and would love to dine there again on my next stay at the resort. She has turned my entire experience around for the better. It still astounds me that a GM would go to such lengths to ensure that all guests receive excellent service and treatment. I have never had anyone write such a thoughtful letter to me. It was rare. That was the first time I've had a manger follow up with me, and it just shows how much she cares about the guests, and I truly respect her for that.

Slowing down with the boys!

So a night to ourselves and we really don't know what to do with ourselves.  Hmmmmmmmmm why don't we walk around to see what we can find. 

Low and behold we find this spot that I know i've been to in years past.  And if my memory serves me well, there should be some sangria here. Bear in mind this place closes relatively early on a Sunday... well what do you expect on a Sunday?? It is still nice as I recall overlooking the canals and a great spot to people watch if there were still people walking around. 

Let me tell you this... your favored three SBC bros. did not let you down. We drank our asses off on sangria in the last hour that place was open. Everything, from discussions of where to go next, to inside politics, to the cute girl that walked on by took on a very alcoholic slant that induced laughter till the wee hours of the morning. I love sangria. 

And that is basically how our night started on our last night on the strip.... the beginning of the end of SBC in Las Vegas trip.

Seriously it would've been a great deal if it had a lot of alcohol in it, but it just tasted like bland watermelon juice. 
I'm glad that we didn't wait 30mins for dinner because it doesn't seem like the food would've been good. We headed to Dos Caminos @ the Palazzo which has better ratings. Drinks were great over there.",bZFETqQ0reXJcAf1a8eEog,1,1,1,CjFxMmnu-F7yHaIoBELsVQ

We ordered flautas and received taquitos (the smallest flautas I've ever seen in my life!), we ordered tres tacos but the menu failed to mention these are actually street tacos (extremely small tres bite tacos) and they only came in one small corn tortilla each instead of 2. We were told the tres tacos were all white meat but it as mixed (no problem with but it would've been nice to know...the manager said it's supposed to be all white so I have no idea what happened there). We asked if we could special order some nachos and we were told the chef has ""attempted many times to make nachos but keeps failing"" - at first we didn't understand exactly what that meant, the manger later told me they don't have the proper cheese and they cheese they use doesn't melt well and the chef wouldn't send it out with her name on it and doesn't see it as presentable - but that's what we wanted melted cheese or not and frankly, the chef sent out our other food seemingly not caring if her name was on that and it wasn't that great. The refried beans with chroizo is defintely worth it. Overall it was a waste - $55 for okay service, one order of ""street"" tacos, 2 orders of ""flautas"" and the chips and salsa we had to pay for. When I addressed my concerns with the manager she didn't really seem to care and stood by the food (absolutely great and a quality I admire in a manager but I really feel she should've bent a little as we left feeling like she didn't care about our experience) we are locals and will never go back to this restaurant.

Guacamole, I get that, that's always extra (amirite Chipotle?). Any sit-down Mexican restaurant should give you chips and salsa at the table, ESPECIALLY nicer ones like Canonita is trying to be. I payed for the chips and salsa because it's pretty necessary ($5 in case you were wondering), and they were just alright. The chips were great, but the salsa lacks heat completely. 

It's the kind of salsa that is afraid to be salsa, afraid to offend the palates of as many people as possible. But brah, it's a Mexican restaurant, we need spicy salsa. At least like, kind of spicy?? If you can't hang with some heat, you shouldn't be at a Mexican place. I don't really get it. Canonita, please raise the damn heat above level 0 on the salsa. Also it should be free at the table. Pls.

I also ordered the chicken burrito. Was it $18? Yes. Did it taste like an $18 burrito? Meh. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but for that price that burrito should have everything and the kitchen sink in it. I wasn't wowed by the cilantro rice on the side either, that wasn't terribly flavorful. Chipotle does better rice, I probably should have just gone there instead.

I was very embarrassed by this as I was put in a very awkward and uncomfortable position of deciding whether or not to address it or ignore it. I was embarrassed as the company I was with definitely noticed and heard the comments.

Our group of six was on the hunt for a brunch spot and didn't want to spend upwards of an hour waiting for a table. We also didn't want to admit defeat and eat at Denny's. We started looking for lunch instead of brunch, saw that Canonita was nearly empty on a Saturday a little after 11 am, and decided to look no further. I had no great expectations regarding authenticity (I would have gone to Tacos El Gordo for that) but I was optimistic that our meal would be reasonably tasty. I was right.

As luck would have it, the special that day was a chorizo and egg burrito, so I got to have brunch after all. The massive, fork-and-knife burrito was served with cilantro rice and black beans. The beans were nice--mild and lightly sweet--and the rice had a refreshing quality about it. The burrito itself was very tasty (I mean, chorizo and egg, how can you go wrong?). My cactus margarita (made with puree of the fruit, not the paddle) was kind of dull . . . it could have been any margarita, really. My friends ordered a pitcher of some sort of pineapple infused margarita and that was a great choice. Incredibly sweet, but really good. No free table chips/salsa here, but it's Vegas so everything has a price. We ordered chips, salsa and guacamole and it was all very worthy.

We opted to sit right next to the waterway and were not disappointed with our view and dining experience. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and quick to refill my husband's ice tea numerous times; thanks Juliette! The food was delish and the picky eater in our group was happily fed. I'm still craving the Queso Fundido and I have to go back and order the Taco Sampler again so I can have more of that Mushroom Taco. Would not have typically ordered that but it was packed full of flavor and had I not already been stuffed, I would've surprisingly finished that too! Unfortunately our tabletop was a little small for containing our order but it was definitely worth shuffling plates around a bit and the servers were very accommodating.

If you have ever ate flautas, you know that they are fried which makes them crunchy on the outside with different filings on the inside-almost like a taquito. Anyway, the faults here are perfectly fried with not too much crunch-it doesn't hurt the rook of you mouth when you bite into it AND the filling inside with the different dipping sauces are amazing. 
The food is very reasonably priced for Vegas and being in the Canal Shops. 
Our server was very nice and attentive.

Lastly, the BEST part about this restaurant is the location. Should you decide to try this yummy establishment, be sure to request a table alongside the actual canal where they are performing the gondola rides. Huge plus is you get to hear the gondola singers while you enjoy your mexican food.

One of my favorite dishes here is the quesadilla (see attached photo). We've also tried the Mexico City Enchiladas and a few other dishes, and always the sauce and the freshness of the ingredients made it tasty and delicious.

The margaritas are a little small, but that's okay if you're a light drinker.

-Raspberry mojito, I love that my husband has no shame and says proudly that mojitos are his fave drink
-Sangria margarita, just skip this drink it was disgusting, I don't even want to get into the grueling details

We asked for chips and salsa and find out later that it's $2 for the first batch and $1.00 for each chip refill and $.50 for salsa refills. WTF, that's why I docked a point. 

We sit down at the table and order the chile relleno and the mushroom enchiladas. 

No joke, this is one of the best non-traditional chile rellenos I have ever had.  It had goat cheese, nuts and dried fruits inside the pepper and then it was breaded and flash fried.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

It's a great setting, right on the canal in the Venetian.  Fun to watch all the boats and people go by.  We had a reservation, were seated immediately and had a nice table right by the canal.  It took probably 10 minutes for any server or bus person to come near our table and even offer water.  Finally the server showed up to take our drink orders.  By that time we were ready to order but he disappeared without us having a chance to do so.  

We each had a margarita, I've had better and hubs had enchiladas and I had fish tacos.  He said he was pretty good, mine was not.  We also ordered chips and salsa and they have nerve charging $14 for the chips that we were served, stale, cold and the salsa was just average.

The price wasn't bad but for that food we wouldn't go back.

The guacamole was okay.  Not great... it was missing some lime and salt, but it was good.

I had the chile relleno, and was no too impressed.  The pepper and cheese filling were good, but the breading was way too thick and oily.  There was very little sauce, and it did nothing to curb the thick crisp breading on the chile, so it was kind of like biting into an airy cracker or cookie with every bite.  Taste was there, but just an odd experience.

The tres leches was pretty good too... but I remember trying it last time I was here two years ago and loving it.  I don't know if my tastes changed or the tres leches changed, but it was a bit disappointing having built it up in my mind only to be presented with an average dessert.

If you're dining in a Venetian/Palazzo canal shop restaurant, you shouldn't be concerned about the price, you know it's going to be expensive.  But I was fairly surprised the bill was so low for a couple drinks, guac, entree, and dessert.

Cabo Ahi - delicious!  Will be back for this again.

We had a table on the patio overlooking the canal as the gondolas slid by, the gondoliers singing beautifully, their songs echoing off the sky painted on the ceiling.  Everything in Vegas is fake something else and this is one of the better cases.

Anyway, I love Mexican food and the food here was quite good.  I had the chicken fajitas and my friend had the chicken mole.  It wasn't the chocolately style of mole he likes but it was good all the same.  My fajitas were tasty and plentiful but nothing exceptional.  The margaritas were very good.

If you compare prices to other Mexican restaurants you know, this is pretty expensive.  (The charge for chips and salsa.). But if you compare the cost of a decent meal in a beautiful setting anywhere else in Vegas, it's a bargain.

Pros:  good food, good service, reasonable prices, wonderful setting

Their shrimp burrito is phenomenal - loaded with shrimp in every bite, no exaggeration. The cilantro rice was the perfect touch.

I asked for a veggie quesadilla-simple request-take your cheese one and add some peppers and onions. The server literally said ""We won't have any veggies up any time soon other than potatoes.""

We imbibed carafe after carafe of a delicious sangria. I took note.

This year, at the end of a traditional/annual BFF/coworker trip, Sarah E, Sarah M, KarKar, and I spent an extra day in Vegas, the start of which led us to this same spot for lunch, touting it's sangria. It did not disappoint my hazy recollection.

We were quickly seated by the hostess, the restaurant/""patio"" on the waterfront being sparsely occupied on a Tuesday afternoon. Julio, our server - an elder but spirited gentleman - came over with menus, introduced himself, and immediately prompted us for drinks to start...
""A pitcher of sangria, please?""
""Excellente. Four glasses?
""Yes, please. Thank you.""

With drinks on their way and requisite chips & salsa on the table, lunch/sustenance was in order. Both Sarahs ordered the Tres Tacos plates while KarKar went with lighter fare, having a bowl of the Corn & Green Chile Soup. I ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, thinking it would be like... um, one big quesadilla, but they (3) were [pleasantly] more akin to grill flattened/pressed tacos.

The Corn & Green Chile soup was flavorful! A bit of sweet from the corn, heat from the green chile, a hearty fullness of potato, and depth/salt from smoked bacon.

The taco combination platters and the smoked chicken quesadilla plate satisfying and freshly flavored. Each taco was dressed with toppings complimentary to their filling - shredded chicken salpicon, mushrooms with queso blanco/fresco, and [grilled] fish with a pineapple salsa. The three palm-sized smoked chicken quesadillas are heavy with chicken and cheese. Both platters come garnished with a sharp and tangy serano slaw, black beans, and fresh flavorful cilantro rice.

Back to what brought us here... the Sangria.

Now its hard to tell (especially in Vegas) just how good/effective a sangria can be. It's *meant* to creep, right? (JM, Cobes, and I went 2-3 carafes not realizing the fade!) But I must say, the sangria here is good. Not too tart, not too sweet. Retains the silken feel of red wine and the warm flush of brandy is subtle. It's a slow ride into troubled waters. What a perfect way to ease into the crazy. Gimme more!

Safe to say, for casual dining, good people watching, and a creeper of a drink, I'd gladly add Canonita to the yearly tradition.

This made my choice very easy as I was trying to decide between the mushroom and chicken enchiladas.  They were A-MAZING.  I ate up every bite until my stomach hurt (not such great self-control this evening).  

On another note, there are two different kinds of rice that could possibly come with your order- mine came with a plain white rice with some veggies and some of the entrees came with a cilantro rice.  i was a bit jealous that mine didn't have cilantro rice. So, if you might care about such a thing, you may want to specify which kind of rice you want. 

I'm only not giving it 5 stars because of the service/timing of the food delivery.  We sat down and waited a good ten minutes before our waiter came over for our drink order.  When he came, he was wonderful and talkative.  We waited another good 5-8 minutes before we got our drinks, and salsa and chips.

The service is always superb. I usually sit at the bar, just to kind of avoid that kitschy Venetian feel. All of the bartenders are attentive and friendly. The overall vibe of the place is welcoming and warm - disregarding the ""mall atmosphere"" happening around the place. 

If you like the feel of the Venetian, this would be the place to relax and enjoy a very good meal - the Canal flows right past the restaurant as you hear the gondola singer's serenading echoes. 

There's an open kitchen where you can see fresh tortillas being made and dishes being cooked to order. I absolutely love it. Excellent execution of service, very well organized, clean and customer oriented. I'm definitely a fan of this place.",KhD6ip17SPOusQp_jQOPiA,8,8,5,dr601M6C-D7qtRpD88fa5Q

I mean, I'd go rockclimbing at the world famous Red Rock Canyon (20 miles outside of LV), but always stay away from the seedy strip, despite its glitz and glam exterior. That is, until I discovered Taqueria Canonita. 

It was by force of circumstance that I was stuck in the Venetian, and being always hungry, I stumbled into the taqueria. Immediately, the place made this Texas girl feel right at home, the waiters and the chef were all hispanic and you can tell it was a tight knit group- like a little family. Everyone was incredibly nice, and their passion for food, and particularly Mexican food, showed. 

My waiter, Ricardo, recommended a number of his favorite dishes, just like (or as the case may be, better than) his father would make, he said.  I settled on the tasty Sietes Mares, and was very impressed.  When I finally met up with my party, we came back (just 4 hours later) for a second dinner. 

I specifically requested the same waiter, and he recommended more tasty options. My next dish (and arguably my last) was the Santa Rosa Barbacoa de Puerco. The pork was so fantastic, slow cooked so that it melts in your mouth when it hits your pallet, that I had a total food-gasm. The pork's complex, perfectly balanced flavors mixed with the cilantro rice, made me think I had died and gone to heaven. 

In the span of just over a day, I ate there 4 times (including three servings of the Santa Rosa Barbacoa de Puerco). The staff was so amused by my reaction, that they gave me the recipe and the chef's e-mail address in case I ran into problems cooking it at home. 

Of course, I've never actually done it 'cause it takes 48 hours, and I lack the patience. Still... fabulous food, fabulous service, and they have ""river side"" dining. I surprised myself by saying... ""it doesn't really get better than this.""",aqXY7pN0nIHfyrusGA71pw,1,2,5,Vu7tGbhuIjLirkJ1LNB3Ig

Started off with signature margaritas, and mussels.
Both were great, my boyfriend doesn't eat mussels but was exceptionally wowed by the broth that they sit in (weird, I know).

I had the platter of tacos, which was excellent.
My boyfriend has enchiladas which he said were seasoned great.

We like to go to restaurants and eat a few bites here and there, plus a good signature cocktail, wine or beer. Taqueria Canonita satisfied every taste bud possible.

We ordered: Sake to Me (Sake, Tequila, Horchata and Cinnamon), Chips, guacamole and salsa, and then two chicken tacos, one beef taco, one pork taco and one fish taco. Before I told the waiter, Ishmael, that I was gluten free, I asked if the tacos came with corn tortillas. This one comment lit a lightbulb and he knew I was gluten free and just a list of knowledge came from his mouth. He told me I couldn't have this or that meat because it is marinaded in beer or soy sauce (without checking with his chef/manager), that I can have the flautas, but they're fried with glutenous items, that the chips were safe because they were corn and that we must have the guacamole. WOW. 

Normally I love guacamole that burns and cools all at the same time. Taqueria's guacamole was excellent, and that's without them asking if we would like it mild, medium or spicy. I didn't care that it didn't burn, it was fresh and delicious. The salsa had a healthy kick but the lime and cilantro added great flavor to the chips and tacos. 

The drink? Wowzers. Not too sweet, not too savory, not a strong taste of alcohol but it definitely had a punch. Creamy but still silky without being too rich. I will try to replicate this drink at home until my dying day.

The tacos. Ohhhhh, the tacos. I wish I had ordered five of the fish tacos with a beautiful mango salsa, grilled and blackened and oh so happy. The chicken tacos were made of white AND dark meat (necessary)and were tender and flavorful and were topped with cilantro and onions. My husband could have eaten the beef tacos all night (not gluten free), and he said they were some of the top beef tacos he's ever had (and we eat far too many tacos). The pork tacos did not ignite as much excitement, but he still enjoyed them just the same. All of them were wrapped in homemade, thick, warm corn tortillas which made my world go round that night. 

All in all, we will be back. If you're gluten free, get over here now. Great environment, try to sit on the patio which rests alongside the canals in the canal shoppes so you can hear the beautiful singing of the gondoliers and relax under the beautiful Venetian skies.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,2,0,5,zDTjxstFIoO_1M7SUeoYkw

We also ordered the chicken quesadillas. Much to my surprise and pleasure it did not come hidden underneath cheese. It was perfectly cooked in yummy tortillas and came with guacamole and beans and cilantro rice (I can still taste the rice btw). 
You should definitely go and order more food here.

Fortunately my daughter's fajitas came with extra corn tortillas, so I could cobble together something salvageable with the innards of the BBQ burrito.

My boyfriend and I ordered the chile relleno, served with roasted vegetables and jicama salad, and the wild mushroom enchiladas served with borracho beans and rice.  The chile relleno was stuffed with a mixture of dried fruit, almonds, and cheese, and the contrast between sweet and savory was a party in my mouth.  The salad was light and the orange dressing was a refreshing surprise.  The enchiladas were drenched with a velvety poblano sauce, and combined with the mushrooms, the enchiladas just slid down my throat.  The borracho beans were a smoky kidney beans with a hint of chili powder.  Oh, and don't skip the chips and fire roasted salsa; it's so good that you'll want to drink it straight from the bowl.

For dessert, we shared the Ancho Brownie, garnished with pepita ice cream.  This ancho infused brownie was ooey, gooey, and very fudgy.

At first I wanted a simple dinner, no extra requests. But after speaking with our photographer from the Wynn hotel where we had our ceremony, she suggested we could do a cake cutting at the restaurant which I brought up to Valerie. I was able to order a cake through the AquaKnox bakery -Valerie allowed me to customize it with flowers, my own cake topper, cutter and server. I sent her a pinterest inspiration image which she gave to the bakery and it turned out  A M A Z I N G!!! The bakery totally nailed it and it was so delicious too!
The staff at Canonita were awesome as well! We requested our own sweetheart table when we got there -my dress was pretty fluffy with the long train so it was difficult to sit amongst everyone else with the chairs being so close. I asked one of the servers and they brought out a table and two chairs for us right away and took our drink orders as well. They definitely made sure we had everything we needed.

Oh what a difference 3 years make.

I was looking at the menu online and it seemed like a good idea to revisit this place since the entrees are between $14 - $23, which is affordable for a place located in the Venetian. The drinks were WEAK (we ordered a carafe of white sangria and two mojitos), seriously when I'm in Vegas, I want to be at least tipsy! (if not passed out!)

My pork al pastor with pineapple salsa was salty and dry. Same thing with my sis' chicken quesadilla. My bros said their burritos were okay, but then again, those two will eat anything. (yup. they don't Yelp either!) On the other hand, the cilantro rice was actually pretty good. 

Oh, did you know that this place charges $2 for chips n salsa?!? That's a crime -- even for a Mexican restaurant on the strip! What's even worse is, there's an additional 50 cents charge for refills! 

The service. Holy effin guacamole.  I couldn't tell you how BAD it was. (okay, you insist so let me tell you) Let me start by saying, my sis and I both used to work in the restaurant business. My bros still work in the food industry.  Bad service means less than 15% tip or no tip at all. Our server does NOT deserve the automatic 18% charge on our bill (we were a party of 6).  We waited awhile for our dishes to come out, we had to keep asking for water refills, napkins, utensils and it took FOREVER to get the check.  

Canonita, get your act together! the only decent part of this experience was the nice ambiance sitting next to the grand canal. Kudos to the smiling hostess as well. I know parting is SUCH sweet sorrow....

Their drink list is full of custom cocktails and margaritas. The pineapple infusion margarita ($11) was excellent with tropical flavors and hints of vanilla. For those that can't decide, they've got a margarita flight ($15) with a classic,  jalapeño, and pineapple version.

Plenty of popular dishes can be found on the menu like flautas ($12), three per order, all crispy and tightly rolled with ample amount of ground beef inside topped with an avocado-tomatillo sauce, lettuce and quest fresco. The entrees were quite good. The wild mushroom enchiladas ($21), covered in a poblano cream sauce, were an excellent vegetarian option.

3602290,2018-06-11,1,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"This place has been here for 19 years.  It's right by the Venetian lake where you can be serenaded by the gondoliers and tourists floating by you on gondolas.  The renovated decor here is quite nice, and colorful, as though it were a street corner in Mexico.  (A nice touch is the bright robin's egg blue Citroen truck parked on one side of the restaurant where tacos are sold--smart!)

The crab cakes ARE quite good (as others have said), but ""muy picante"" (very spicy).  It would have been nice for the server to let us know that.  Thankfully, I enjoy spicy, and it was delicious.  But my husband did not fare as well, and could only take a bite.  He also ordered a steak dish with beans that had really spicy onion and jalapeños on it that made his eyes immediately water and his hands reach out for water (which was almost gone).  Needless to say, he did not enjoy his meal.  And at $36, it was a waste.  Again, this is something the server should have given a heads-up about!  I took some of his onions/jalapeños and placed them in my pozole soup, and MAN ALIVE, it was HOT! I had to immediately take them out, but the contact with the soup, made it irredeemably spicy thereafter, even for me.  (Though I did nearly finish it, anyway).  I think the server should have given a heads up, as I said. I even ASKED about the spiciness level, and he said not to worry.  The menu should probably give a better heads-up, too.  Not everyone is a spicy food person; some of us are gringos, remember! This is a tourist place, after all.   And it took a long time to get re-fills on drinks, and our server kept forgetting our corn tortillas, etc.  I was trying to get him to get me the enchiladas to try, but he didn't catch on. Maybe he was given too many tables?  It's a busy location. 

Aside from the crab cakes, the Queso fundido is a safe bet, too. (Cheesy, rich, and not spicy). The pork pozole had a nice, mild flavor.  I would avoid the chocolate dessert.  (Though I am a chocolate fanatic!)  It was way too dense.  But the tres leches cake was better.

Overall, the food was tasty (though I suspect loaded with salt and/or MSG, or artificial sugar or something--we were really quite bloated that night--first time in a long while, despite eating out a LOT), but the service was lacking.  

Aside from not providing good information about the spice level of the food (despite asking), and not getting drinks filled, the server failed to give us the 10% discount that the manager suggested that we get for being locals.  Even though we asked, and he said he would, he didn't do it.  I didn't notice until I reviewed the bill walking away from the restaurant.  And we called about it, and were told that they would take it off the bill and get back to us...but no one got back to us.  Bummer.",NrpzAH3EoNhWUR8OysUhBQ,2,1,3,-pgiecmdQbtrYa8fPqbH2Q

We were seated immediately, right on the water. It was so lovely to watch the gondolas pass throughout the meal. This restaurant is in a prime location, right where the boats stop for a brief serenade. We heard numerous versions, from the traditional to the light hearted for the kids.

The rice was light, pillowy, fresh and full of that deep stock flavor that a good Mexican rice deserves. The beans were also fresh, seasoned perfectly, and had a hearty texture. Each side of the plate featured a sauce, red to the right and green to the left. The red sauce was slightly sweet and complimented everything on the plate.

The cocktails were very good, the classic margarita and the michelada were ordered several times at our table with no complaints. NOTE: they do a happy hour until 7pm on most nights, but only at the bar!! The happy hour price is nearly 50% off on the margaritas, if your looking to save a buck. If your not eating dinner, they serve drinks in TO-GO cups even at happy hour prices.....very nice!

The best thing about this place is the location inside the Venetian, if you get a table on the ""patio""(which means its not the bar area, hence not included in happy hour) you can sit right next to the water for the Gondola rides and listen to them sing(and watch the couples awkwardly stare at each other.... whilst taking their romantic trip in a circle..... through a hotel made to look like Venice, Italy) . It makes for a bit of a romantic dinner if your into that sort of thing, or at the very least some awesome people watching(im a fan).

Most dishes aren't what people would traditionally imagine. One of my favorite dishes is the wild mushroom enchiladas. They are super tender and come covered with a light green colored sauce. Very mellow flavors. They have a vegetarian torta with a thick slice of grilled tofu, and typically I'll only eat tofu if it's in miso soup. One of my absolute favorites is the pezcado veracruz. It's the 'catch of the day' in a marisco (red) sauce with rice. Imagine a fish stew, with a large cut of fish in the middle. The Vaquero beef rib is also excellent. It's a well prepared short rib in mildly spicy mashed potatoes. This restaurant is the ONLY restaurant in The Venetian that is located directly on the canal. Whenever we went, we always were seated directly next to the canal. The wait staff is always super friendly. Although the hostesses have often been unfriendly and will take forever to acknowledge your presence. Their drinks are pretty good. I recommend the sangria by the bottle. It's fairly inexpensive and very good. Not a bad way to pass an hour or so, sitting with your sangria at the canal. I think a lot of people are expecting a different style of food here. It's more of a gourmet style, with interesting interpretations. Don't expect a big sloppy wet burrito. For the amount and quality of food, I consider this place to be cheap. Entrees are around the $20 mark and they charge for chips and salsa. But the portions are generous (not gigantic) and the food and atmosphere are second to none. You would be hard pressed to find a better location than this, in Vegas. I highly recommend for a late breakfast/early lunch, when they open around 11a.

3967571,2018-06-22,2,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"Two of us had lunch here with a menu selected by the chef.

Here's a list of items served the two of us.

Chips with rustic salsa and spicy chile salsa and guacamole
Roasted mussels and shrimp skillet.
Jalapeño queso fundido with tortillas.
Appetizer trio sampler--tuna ceviche tostada, posole verde, and chorizo gordito.
Patzcuaro duck relleno.
Toluca portobello mushroom.
Wild mushroom enchildas.
Santa Rosa pork barbacoa.
Shrimp and mussels Moqueca.
Carne asada.
Trio of desserts--coffee flan, tres leches cake, warm chocolate brownie.

My dining mate was brought a trio of margaritas to sample in the beginning and later we each were brought a trio of aqua fresca drinks--horchata, prickly pear cactus with lemonade, and watermelon.

I have rarely had a meal when I left without having some comment about something being able to be done better or spiced more or something along those lines. Everything I tasted yesterday was perfectly executed and beautifully plated. Some standouts were the posole verde. Prepared differently than I've ever seen, there was hominy, diced pork, green chile, tomatillos, Mexican oregano, shredded cabbage, and shredded red radish. What a great take on a classic soup! Another was the shrimp and mussel moquec--a Brazilian dish done here with a Mexican flair. The coconut aji amarillo sauce, looking like a curry but tasting nothing like it, gave the shrimp, rice, and mussels a great flavor. Last, the Patzcuaro duck relleno, a Michoacán dish, was superb! The duck confit was excellent. The dish is normally made with smaller poblano chiles, but Chef Willey made two larger ancho chile versions yesterday.

Service throughout lunch was top notch. The ingredients of every dish were explained and we were alerted when we were being served something that was spicy but there was nothing that would raise any spice alarms for me. The green salsa made with several chiles including habanero was spicy hot and I liked it.

Executive chef Willey came by several times to check on us, answer questions, and explain how some of the dishes came about. The General Manager, Annaliza McKinney, also came by to check up on us.

Two hours after being seated I left, very full and very satisfied. Every dish was really well done and I was pleased to have had the chance to try Cañonita--a restaurant that I've walked by many times and always wanted to try but somehow never did.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,5,4,tPtdeJjp8hgWxuVDw_8L1A

They were serving ahi tuna on plaintain chips; the tuna was fresh and delicious. The pork empanadas, short rib on tortilla chip and the albondigas con papa were all very good, and very addictive. There was also a fried avocado with sesame seed (I think sesame seed) that was kind of like a Mexican tempura. The shrimp skewers were kind of difficult to eat the way they were placed on the stick, but were good also. They were served very interesting though, stuck into a big piece of pineapple. Cool presentation. 

At the far end of the restaurant they had a couple of people preparing tacos to your liking; they offered carne asada, chicken, carnitas and a couple of different meats. I went with the carnitas, they were very good. They also had different toppings and salsas to add on as well. Oh and for dessert they had pastel de tres leches. Now, any of my friends will tell you that when it comes to dessert, although I have a tremendous sweet tooth, I am still kind of picky. I don't like flan, jello or anything that's too moist, like pastel de tres leches. However, I had been snacking on salty food (and plenty or margaritas) for two hours straight (thanks Alex!) and was open to try a bite for the sugar rush. I must say it was quite good, what won me over was the strawberry jelly. I would recommend you try it. 

The food is is supposed to be Mexico City soul food, I don't know if the mean like cocinas economicas or what. I'm not sure if it's particularly chilango food per se, maybe they should add some huitlacoche, flor de calabaza, etc. But all in all the food is very good and quite affordable if you consider where the restaurant is located.

I am from LA and I know Mexican. And this place is not Mexican. It's something like what Midwesterners want Mexican to be. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that the the Fish tacos were served with a Chipotle Mayo type thing. Yuck. That is not authentic. 

So I ordered the Sopa de Tortilla. A dish I love to order in Mexican restaurants. Not terrible, but not balanced and it really tasted only like a bowl of chili. Eh.

Then my friend ordered the 6 taco platter and I tried the Rajas and Mushroom tacos. Blech. No flavor. Plus (and I hate when restaurants do this) although the menu stated the Rajas Tacos came with Queso Fresco (versus just queso), when it came it was melted Jack Cheese.   That is not Queso Fresco. I guess they don't expect people to know the difference!

___________________________

Where to begin? How about the service? As mentioned before, it was the service on follow-up that convinced me to come back to Cañonita and give them another chance. And it's generally more about the service than anything else when I consider how I feel about my experience at a restaurant. 

Rarely if ever have I been so pleased to be turned around on my opinion of a restaurant.  To say that Alejandro and his staff treated my guests and me like treasured friends would be an understatement. Now I know full well that they were looking to make up for a previous poor experience but I was watching the scene throughout the restaurant and, well, it wasn't just us. The staff was attentive and welcoming to everybody, and I could see lots of smiles and hear lots of laughter throughout the restaurant. This was what had been lacking the first time. Yes, the food was a major FAIL then, but it was the service that caused much of the problem. And it was the follow-up by Alejandro that had started to turn me around. This was five star, white glove service. Perfection.

As for the food, it was nothing short of spectacular. I can be a bit of a food snob at times. Okay, maybe more than a bit. But my daughter still talks about her fish from that night. High praise from a picky pescatarian about the fish she essentially HAD to order because there weren't exactly a lot of choices available to her. It made her old man smile from ear to ear. Her attitude went from ""do we really have to go back there?"" to ""when can we go back there again?"" I tasted it. It melted like butter in my mouth. My steak was heavenly but her fish was truly incredible. I wanted to steal it from her. All of the dishes were brilliantly prepared and beautifully presented. Everything about our meal was close to perfect - the atmosphere, the service, the food, the drinks. I even enjoyed the desserts - and I'm not really a huge desserts guy.  

Alejandro, thank you. You and your staff have restored my faith and we WILL be back.

Okay, so that's what has been unwittingly stuck as a draft since the end of November.   And if you want to know if we're still thinking about that meal, well.... My birthday's coming up and my kids asked to go back to Vegas to celebrate. (In the summer. Yeah, I know!) My daughter was quick to insist that we go to Cañonita for my birthday dinner. She still talks about that fish seven months later. My son suggested Cañonita too, and he wasn't even with us in November. He's been listening to his sister rave about her meal for months.

Came here for a party and was delighted from the word 'Go'. Mind you, I kinda stopped with the Mexican food thing because it's so often so mediocre (and that's in any city). And, truly, not the healthiest. But Canonita blew up both of my prejudices.

* Margaritas. Yes, very tasty and potent without knocking me over. Enjoyed the balance of sweetness to citrusy tartness. Mmm. (And they gave us cups for when we later taxi'd off to Karaoke.)
* Chips and guac. The chips were tasty, with just enough crisp and just enough salt, and certainly no oily residue. The guacamole was damn good -- thick and tasty, without a lot of mysterious ingredients. Straightforward and delish. 
*Filet Mignon was my choice (could have also gone for Salmon or a chicken dish). Lovely 8 oz I think was the weight. Don't bother requesting a temp for your meat, because the kitchen really doesn't think know what's best. Happily, we were of the same mind in term of heat: Medium Rare and loving it. Wonderful flavors that I frankly can't recall (I mentioned the margaritas, right?). If you at all interested in steak, this is a worthy choice for your entree.

I must say the dessert was fine, but anticlimactic. Really not necessary. However, I did have a brownie sundae which definitely didn't hurt anything - except maybe my waistline.

Service was pleasant and attentive without being all over us. Water was refilled as necessary, which for me, is fairly often. 

Overall, I was most surprised that the Yelp reviews seemed so unenthusiastic. I would absolutely recommend Canonita, and if you do sit 'outside' by the gondolas, you don't even notice them. Gracias! Muchas gracias!",yvXEJcXRtffR2GuWULbRjg,1,0,4,ykZ_K0Zmv_J2Yf_MK9vlyg

Q: Mexican food inside the Venetian. Doesn't that strike you as odd?
A: A city built in the middle of the desert that thrives on gambling and entertainment (adult and otherwise)? A fake Champs Elysees on Las Vegas Blvd.? A city where public intoxication on the main street is okay as long as you're not stumbling and puking? Doesn't that strike you as odd?

No. Of course not. It's Vegas (obligatory: baby)!

Q: How is the sangria here?
A: Oh! I'm glad you asked. It is absolutely delicious. Chilled to perfection. Nice large chunks of fruit in there. Get a pitcher. Get two! Thank me later! I don't have sangria often but this is the benchmark on which all other sangria pitchers will be judged.

Q: Woah, this looks like it's right next to the canal, right?

The happy hour is from 3-6pm and 9pm-close. $3 wells and beers and $5 margaritas and specialty drinks, one of which was a Long Island Iced Tea! 

There is a bartender who is there almost daily and while he is seemingly polite and friendly he is absolutely buried all the time. Hire this guy some help! And be nice to him, he works hard.

The margaritas are pretty good, not quite as artisinal as some places but good ingredients and a nice amount of the strong stuff. The long islands are served in a short glass but have plenty of kick for the price. Just a great spot to start the day-drinking off right.

The food I was lucky enough to try was awesome. The salsa is made with roasted chilis and has an amazing depth of flavor. Some of my favorite ever. The queso is ridiculous. Get it with the jalapenos and bask in a bowl of awesome cheese. I do wish they gave you more tortillas with it. If you combine it with the salsa you will not be disappointed.

Everything else on the menu sounded really awesome and I will have to eat an actual meal here on my next trip out. It's a favorite.",bg41jhOxbknzzxgIbWFW1g,2,0,5,-siSMRy3SGcbexQLWtX2Hw

I mean the atmosphere is supposed to be of Venice, Italy but you are eating tacos with a Sketchers in the background lol.  

We started off with the guac and chips.  They do not do the whole free chips and salsa thing.  The guacamole was fresh and had a little spicy kick to it.  I also decided to order a flight of margaritas. Did you read that?  A FLIGHT OF MARGARITAS!!!  It comes with 3 margaritas: a classic on the rocks, a pineapple and a jalapeno.  The jalapeno was very spicy and harder to get down than the other 2.  The classic was very heavy on lime.  For an entrée I got the Pollo Mole Poblano.  I love chicken with mole sauce and get it anytime I see it.  This one had poblano peppers in the sauce so it tasted spicier than usual.  It came with a seasoned rice and mixed veggies.

We weren't in the ""patio"" (along the canal), but were beneath a graceful arch and close enough to see the gondolas drifting by - actually they were maneuvering quite a bit because it's near the embarkation point.  In fact, the only thing separating us was a small group celebrating a wedding - I thought it a very suitable venue for a Vegas reception....more of a choice to forego the big church wedding and Italian honeymoon instead of a we-can't-afford-it substitute.  Well, that's the vibe I got since they had obviously put in a lot of attention to detail with the nicest spot, table set up, cake table, etc.  Well, it lent some romance to our dinner since we weren't a menage a trois, but there with our teenage son.  The menu was very tempting - there were a few things we couldn't decide between.  Looking over at the next table, I recommended that my son order a dish full of shell fish, chicken skewers, and delicious looking bread; it turned out not to be quite enough for him.  The ceviche appetizer was sufficient as an entree for me though - the tuna was good, the shrimp and olive too salty, and the third not memorable.  Oh, another diner came over and asked me what I thought of it, so the dishes match the menu description very accurately!  My husband had the succulent pork, and we shared a carafe of strong (I felt) sangria.  It would have been nice if chips and salsa were included instead of being offered separately on the menu (duh, restaurateurs, I probably could have handled more sangria then).  I'm recommending it for kids also because watching the boats is pretty entertaining, it's noisy anyway, and I imagine the railings are close enough that they can't slip through.

Not horrid, but definitely not wow. The fajitas were just there. You're tasting the steak the peppers the onions, but where's the wow ? Where's the melting in your mouth? Where's the mmm? Perhaps the waiter took it along with the what seems to look like a place with awesome service on the outside. Not too attentive despite a not so busy day. When asked for lemon or anything else to be brought at the table it took a good 10 minutes for the waiter to come around again. All in all was checked up on once.

- Wild Mushroom Enchiladas with poblano chili sauce, cilantro rice, borracho beans (pintos and corn).
- Carne Asada Nortena with black beans, roasted cerranos and garlic, and sweet corn tamales.

We had a reservation for lunch at 3pm on the patio to enjoy the ambiance, people watching and gondola rides. We were told it was happy hour. We tried to place an order for a drink that was on the happy hour menu, but were told it was only available in the main dining area, not on the patio. We asked if we could order our drinks in the bar and bring it to our table and our waitress highly discouraged it. We asked if there was something she could do and she said she didn't know. Ok, whatever. We ended up just ordering our drinks through our waitress. We got chips and salsa for the table, but they charge for that. It's not complimentary, like most standard mexican restaurants. 

When placing an order, our waitress kept leaving to go ask questions to the manager. She obviously had no knowledge of the menu. We asked her for a cheese quesadilla with beans on the side and she said they couldn't do that. Huh? Seriously?!? 

We ordered the mushroom enchiladas. 10 minutes later our waitress comes back and says they're out of mushroom enchiladas. So we order a bean burrito with beans and veggies inside. 10 minutes later, a different waitress comes by to tell us they can't do a bean burrito with beans inside because the flour tortilla would become soggy. Ok. So, we asked her what else she had to offer that was vegetarian? She replied mushroom enchiladas. We told her that our previous waitress just told us your kitchen was out of mushroom enchiladas. She simply replied, no, we have it. Ummm....ok. Communication issues much? 

We finally get our food almost an hour and a half after initially being seated. The mushroom enchiladas were good, but nothing to write home about. Guacamole was also tasty, but after dealing with all of the headaches of our waitress and slow service, I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone. Go to Dos Caminos inside The Palazzo instead. You won't get the ambiance, but at least you'll get delicious Mexican food with good service and capable waiters/waitresses.",VPzbCGojG9z4GGR-cDQsYA,0,0,1,xVr_yzlqtMM5egtO1IcJzQ

One person in our group is a vegetarian so as part of the 3 dishes he ordered, one was a Cobb salad minus the bacon. Their version is spinach with some shaved cheese and dressing. Last time I ordered a Cobb salad it has tomatoes, eggs, cheese, and a few other thing. We did order the flautas and empanadas as an appetizers.  The flautas were probably the best out of all of our dishes. The empanadas were ok but they had so much sauce in the serving bowl that they were soggy on the bottom. The stuffed chicken was oddly flavored with half the dish being very sweet and have more savory. Very odd.

4881537,2016-03-17,0,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"Stopped in tonight (Wednesday) at about 8:30 pm and was dining solo.  The hostess asked if I wanted a place at their shared tables - I expect this was because they had some type of private event going on taking up a lot of spots that are ""canal"" side. I decided I'd rather sit at the bar and was immediately helped by multiple bartenders offering me Margaritas and the like.  I was looking for a lighter and less calorie stuffed meal, so ordered a large Pellegrino w/Lime.  

The bartenders seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and practically congratulated me for my decision to order the Pozole Verde.... which... was.... delicious! The flavor was fantastic! I was a little bit disheartened to see the size of the pork -- not that they were skimpy on the pork overall, just the size of the pieces seemed awfully tiny compared to other Pozoles I've had. I probably could have stopped there as I wasn't ravenous -- the Pozole was probably about a cup and a half. Not too big and not too small. 

I ended up deciding I was hungry enough to get something else and tried their Tuna Ceviche Tostada.  The presentation was simple -- one corn tortilla, tostada style, secured on the plate by some guacamole (underneath) to prevent slipping around the plate during transport and topped with a Tuna ceviche that had a cilantro and serrano pesto with onions and jalapeno.  The bartender had warned me that it was spicy, but I guess I didn't get a very spicy jalapeno because I could have handled more heat.  On top of the well portioned ceviche was about a 1/4 avocado which was ripe and tasty.  

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal with Canonita and will likely visit again sometime this week to try another dish as many of my bar neighbors seemed to have some delicious dishes in front of them.",dYC5CiL1fXjVnj45aGCneQ,0,0,4,jPu0qnskFT89WtjZ60ICzA

And though I cant say the dishes were 100% traditional, everything my party tried was delicious. Im not sure if the twist they put on their dishes is just to make them unique or if they are fused with a different culture, all I know is that the flavors blended well and left me wanting to go back! I ordered the Chiapaneco citrus glazed salmon, which was marinated in a delicious tamarind sauce, topped with mandarins and served with a sweet potato hash. Honestly,  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it! My boyfriend ordered the Mazatin seared ahi with quinoa salad and that was also really good. The ahi was seared with this really tasty chile sauce... best seared tuna ive ever had! He also ordered the shrimp calamari cocktail, which I expected to be a bland American version, but was actually very close to the authentic Mexican style... also very good. My sister and her girlfriend tried the chicken enchiladas and a Tarascan chicken soup, which I did not try but they loved. And last but not least, my absolute favorite thing was the sangria de rojo, which is a blend of sangria and margarita. Now I want to go back to try every other drink on the menu!

It happened to be happy hour when we were passing by.  The big happy hour menu is what caught our attention and from there we were drawn in like moths to a flame. 

We were seated very quickly and the setting overlooked the Venetian's waterway. A nice romantic scene for you and your loved one. The waiter Alejandro who's name brought Lady GaGa's song to mind immediately. Alejandro, Alejandro, Ale, Ale, Ale, Ale, Alejandro... however many times she repeats it. He was awesome.

I was in a chicken taco kind of mood as usual, but I quickly changed my mind after I saw the chicken enchiladas. You had your choice of toppings but I can only remember the molé poblano for whatever reason. My wife opted for the chicken tacos surprisingly. 

Of course I ordered a Modelo (it was fitting at the time) and my wife ordered the cape cod. We should have ordered chips and salsa because the drinks came right away which was cool, but since we haven't really eaten anything prior to, our buzz started to kick in after a few rounds. The cape cod was very strong as you can taste more vodka then cranberry juice, but we were in Vegas so who cared. The stronger the better.  

When the food arrived we were slightly tipsy and before my wife got the opportunity top dig in I reached for my fork and blocked her from grabbing the chicken tacos. I wanted to take a few snaps of them as they were. It's what I do. 

The chicken tacos according to my wife were very flavorful and juicy. My chicken enchiladas were excellent and I would highly recommend them topped with the molé poblano sauce as it adds a wonderful kick. The black beans and cilantro rice were the perfect sides. 

If you get the opportunity give it a try and if possible see if you can get seated in Alejandro's section. He was very attentive. We had an awesome experience!",OYJ61TgWLeqi6uM24wim5Q,1,0,5,pM79Fb6AOaapHalXp4niXg

When you first get there, they ask you if you want a table ""outside"" or ""inside"" which is funny because its actually all the same, but if you want the fake clouds and view of the gondolas going by, say ""outside"". The ambiance is perfect for either an intimate date, but its also ideal for large groups because of their huge tables. We had a group of 12 and were seated on Saturday afternoon within minutes. 

The make-your-own Bloody Mary station ended up confusing my friends with all the options...one of them basically ended up with an entire salad in her drink, since the vegetables were unlimited. But hey, if you like blue-cheese stuffed olives and green beans galore, you will be happy! 

If you're vegan, the options here are a bit limited. The rice has butter, but you can ask for the seasoned potatoes which were really good! The manager specifically came out to deliver the item to assure everything was okay with everyone's specific dietary restrictions. 

I got the breakfast burrito which is served with a little salsa on top and one chip. LITERALLY ONE CHIP. I guess they did it to make it look pretty, but it was a very interesting sight. I love that the cheese was melted onto the entire surface of the tortilla instead of being thrown in the middle and disregarded...it was almost like a quesadilla-turned-burrito. Maybe I'll order a separate side of chips next time I come, so I'm not disappointed by the one lonely chip accompanying my burrito.

5278965,2015-03-24,3,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"Invited Chef's Tasting, Not Billed but tipped appropritately:

Told that the Chef would be cooking for us, but offering up menus in case something specific struck our eye, it was with gracious tableside service from a middle-aged Hispanic gentleman that the afternoon commenced and with a jokey sort of professionalism guiding us through the afternoon one really could not have asked for better, Northeastern-born but Border Grill educated Chef Donna Willey also stopping by frequently to discuss her inspiration and training, as well as techniques implemented in more than a dozen plates plus two trios of drinks.

Undoubtedly a 'touristy' setting, the views of artificial sky alongside the canal juxtaposing traditional Mexican decorations within the restaurant's confines, it was with a trio of Margaritas and chips rewarmed from an outside source that the dining began and finding both the green salsa and Jalapeno Infusion far too poignant for my tastes it was on the Vanilla tinged pineapple cocktail and guacamole that I focused, the former a formidable refresher with alcohol well balanced by the fruit while the later was rather dull without a bit of the chipotle salsa added to taste.

At this point ready to see what the kitchen could do, tables around us receiving all sorts of divine looking plates, it was perhaps ten minutes later that a sizzling cast-iron skillet arrived and with the smell of smoke quickly filling the air it was only once things finally cooled down that we finally had a chance to indulge in the snappy butterflied shrimp, meaty mussels, and housemade chorizo teaming with spice, each taste as good as the last with a second dish of queso fundido proving most fortuitous in timing as the still-bubbling cheese topped in jalapenos was a bit timid on its own, but a near-perfect addition when spread on  flour tortillas with some of the seafood piled on top.

At this point requesting service be slowed as our sizable two-top was already filled to capacity with plates, glasses, and utensils it was next to a trio of the Chef's signature appetizers that we were treated and progressing left to right one would be hard pressed to cite a single bite as less than superlative - the ceviche showing clean acidity alongside its accoutrements while the Pozole was equally well balanced and intensely vegetal, the 'gordita' a lightly fried set of bites that was at once bold yet nuanced, creamy but acidic, and entirely greaseless with just the right amount of heat.

Obviously unable to forgo anything stuffed with duck, plus generally fancying most things featuring mushrooms, the next three plates were served in slow succession and although the cinnamon tinged fowl stuffed inside a smoky pepper was indeed quite good it was in fact the fungus that saw me swoon, both the black bean laminated Portobello bathed in fennel tomato sauce and the signature enchiladas showing a deft hand with quality produce, Chef Willey's time at Border Grill undoubtedly well spent.

At this point progressing towards heavier proteins, plus an entirely unexpected Brazilian fish stew, suffice it to say that while the Carne Asada struck me as something I could have just as easily had anywhere both the Barbacoa and Moqueca were amongst the very best bites of the meal, the former brightly spiced and easily cut with a spoon before being added to corn tortillas to form makeshift tacos while the later was a seamless marriage of sea and sweet with coconut milk playing foil to notes of spice that only became evident after a satisfied breath between bites.

Moving onward to desserts, originally offered two but eventually seeing three, it was with a double espresso over ice that the meal would come to an end and although personal preferences obviously have much to do with all things in dining one would be challenged to find a better tres leches in town, the fully saturated sponge entirely sweet yet finding levity in strawberries and meringue, while both the brownie and the flan were also quite good - the former obviously quite hefty while the latter proved far lighter than other versions offered in town, the XO just boozy enough to give it some kick while the unrefined sugar syrup helped soften the blow.

Clearly given the VIP treatment, and as such sampling a far greater swath of the menu than the average duo possibly could, the food that Chef Willey is creating at Canonita is at once almost universally approachable yet at the same time bold and complicated in a way that few other Casino-based ethnic restaurants would dare.  Admittedly underwhelmed by more routine plates like guacamole, queso fundido, as well as carne asada and still perplexed as to why the restaurant would outsource something like tortilla chips when executing more complex items so well there is no doubt that a great meal can be had at Canonita by those willing to venture away from the tried and true, particularly when taking into account the vibe and the view.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,9,4,ZCgyDnOKS0t0YvILJCwPOQ

Canonita's food is right up there with the best Mexican I've had in LA, San Diego, and even Mexico City.  Since it opened, I have not gone to Vegas without eating there.

Everything is delicious without exception - right down to the salsa and chips that are hard not to fill up on.  Even the rice, which comes as a side with just about everything, is not to be missed.  The star of the meal, however, is always their salsa verde - hands down the best salsa verde I've ever had.  Ask for a side of it (they will charge you $1 or so but it's worth it) and pour it onto whatever you end up eating.

Don't expect a taqueria in the conventional sense because Canonita has little in common with the holes-in-the-wall where you often find the best Mexican food.

Seating was a bit weird as they had several open tables and instantly seated the person who walked up seconds before I did and was also solo, yet I was asked to wait for 30 minutes. Oh well. I walked around browsing shops and sampling gelato.

When I was seated service was pleasant and helpful. I seemed to have to waiters but the gentleman who helped me was very pleasant and suggested the pork barbacoa, even when he knew I was considering a more expensive dish. Plus one star for integrity!

I ordered chips and salsa. A very inexpensive appetizer and I devoured them with joy. Chips were ultra fresh and the salsa had a gentle spice and was tasty.

When the pork arrived it came with warm and supple corn tortilla, sides of rice and black beans. The rice had plenty of flavor but was a hair drier than I prefer. The beans were simple and perfectly cooked. I loathe an undercooked bean and black beans are almost always served that way so I was very pleased.

I urge anyone to ask for a couple lime wedges with this meal. The pork was amazingly falling apart tender and the chipotle BBQ was satisfyingly complex. The squeeze of lime over it offset the ""dry"" spice pallet of the BBQ sauce and made the pork flawless. 

My only regret was my dinner was so delectable that I no longer have room for the gelato I was eyeing. Ah well. There's always tomorrow! ;)",noY3yU_h40qeo-hkXGb4CA,1,0,5,qgAR1rwrjXBR0EEwFPtmeg

When I'm in Las Vegas I don't care to spend time wandering around a mall, especially one so big that I've gotten lost more than once (sad but true).  There's only one thing that keeps me visiting the Grand Canal Shoppes, and that's Taqueria Cañonita.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, so I seek them out whenever I can.  I've never had a bad dish on the menu, though my favorite is the Tres Tacos.   Served with black beans and cilantro rice, you just cannot go wrong with any of their taco varieties.  I can't even pick a favorite, they are all good.  

Taqueria Cañonita also makes some tasty, tasty margaritas.   For Cinco de Mayo they had a special margarita that involved Serrano peppers that was amazing.  If there isn't a good special going on, The Cañonita Margarita, made with Patron, is also a favorite.  You just cannot go wrong with Patron!  Just watch out because those suckers will sneak up on you!

Whether you sit on the ""patio"" along the canal or in the bar, this place is always fun.  The one and only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the restroom is located outside the restaurant in the Grand Canal Shoppes food court, which after a few shots of Patron is not exactly ideal.  Still, I'll let it slide and I look forward to visiting them again next time I'm in Las Vegas!",A7cQHNbzn6h6JuptiekH3g,0,2,4,5ah5fyCgpkQ-a2HnVGGicA

Now, my opinion of the tacos may be colored by knowing in a mere 4 hours I'd be stepping off the plane in Los Angeles, soon to fill my mouth and belly with all sorts of delightful Mexican goodies (thinking of it now, I'm not sure why we chose a taqueria in Vegas anyway), so let me tell you about this margarita. 

First, it was 5 bucks--now, 5 bucks is a decent happy hour price in D.C., but in Vegas? Insane. This was called a ""Blackberry Fresca Margarita."" I'm normally a blended margarita girl, but this delight on ice may have changed my mind. It was fresh blackberries with triple sec and silver tequila, a perfectly refreshing blend of sweet and the 1-2 punch of tequila. Most interestingly, but still wholly enjoyable, was that the glass was rimmed with both salt and sugar, which I've never had. 

I genuinely hope this margarita wasn't a special, because everyone who can should try it! I'm planning an attempt at my own as part of a red-white-and-blue drink spread for July 4 this summer.

We ordered a variety of things. All yummy. I personally got the taco sampler. It came with pork, fish, chicken, mushroom, and steak tacos. All yummy, although the steak was prob the winner. The mushroom was something different though. Also a good option were the Ahi tuna tacos. They come with some king of polenta which is spicy. 

The only thing we weren't too crazy about was the cilantro lime rice. For me, it was a little toooo much cilantro. And i even love it. Its bright green if you don't believe me.

I want to quote About.com's review on Taqueria Canonita (because this is exactly how I feel and couldn't describe it better):
""This inspired eatery takes the flavors of Old Mexico and serves them with an exciting, New American ambiance- all beside the gracefully flowing Grand Canal. Experience true ""south of the border"" taste and tradition with authentic Mexican offerings like chile rellenos, tacos al carbon or shrimp quesadillas. The taste of their hand-made corn tortillas alone is enough to transport you to another world. The dcor is as vivid as the menu with casual ambiance, high ceilings and bright, bold colors. Taqueria Caonita's lively exhibition kitchen is the restaurant's centerpiece. Enjoy your meal amidst the sculpted steel and wrought-iron gates, colorful Mexican tiles and authentic Mexican folk art. Even better, Taqueria Caonita's patio is set beside the Grand Canal, offering terrific views of our Venetian streetscapes and passing gondolas.""

It was hilarious watching this extremely polite man's reactions as we tried to explain what a burrito is or why anyone would slow-roast pork on a banana leaf.

He eventually settled on three soft tacos with rice but was perplexed with the color of the restaurant's cilantro rice.  ""Now, I hope you don't mind me asking but is green a normal color for rice?""

I really liked Taqueria Canonita.  I tried the Pepita Crab Cakes and the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla as appetizers.  Both were very flavorful.  I was actually surprised with the crab cakes because I usually compare them against those found in New England.  They were solid, especially given that we were sitting in the middle of the desert.

The chips were just okay but the salsa was good.  And the guacamole was excellent and they give you a ton of it.

For my entree, I ordered the Mexico City Chicken Enchiladas.  It was good but nothing spectacular.

I always order the Queso Fundido as my appetizer.  Their homemade Guacamole is in a league of its own.  My favorite entree is the Pork Barbacoa tacos.  The pork is slow cooked inside a banana leaf.  The rice and beans are excellent.  Canonita also makes excellent margaritas.  They have a $5 margarita special around happy hour.

They don't mind if you just sit and watch the canal after your meal is done.  It's a great place to stop for lunch during a day of shopping!",PtV45pQ1JpGVp6EeGyqS3g,2,0,4,x0i9ETEpkL3VgzxIfP4Vbg

I really enjoy this place.  Sitting at the bar and relaxing after a crazy convention day is just what I needed.  The bartender provided good drinks and conversation.  I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.",wPif9x51jxzO8DS6h-ZY4g,0,1,4,FMH_suzk9JlChQK-7fxBHQ

Canonita Express is located in the mall-like eatery in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. Apparently it's the little sister restaurant of Taqueria Canonita, also located in the vicinity. Despite Taqueria Canonita having better reviews, I don't see Canonita Express living up to the standards of its elder sibling.

Like with most mall-like eateries, the food won't exactly be stellar, but it's quick, convenient, and relatively cheap. I decided to try the steak taco platter for $7.50 and it came with 2 crispy tacos, rice, and beans . The chicken version went for $0.50 cheaper.

The tacos had a nice crisp and the Pico de Gallo on the side was fresh. The steak itself didn't have much flavor, but the hot sauce packets did help. The beans and rice were mediocre at best.

My food came out relatively fast and our server was friendly enough to provide refills on my water. Aside from these factors, I feel there are better options in the food court to try like ""Awesome Panda"".",6Ct6xwJt7AJD9amnMkNckA,0,0,2,UN2xuFJgMTx81kLnJfP1xw

5918583,2009-09-22,0,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"My Uncle and Cousin were in town for a trade-show, and I met up with them to give a quick tour and grab some late lunch before their flight back to California.  I was going to take them to Bouchon, but only the Oyster Bar was opened at that time of the day.

Anyway, I enjoyed the appetizer we ordered: Queso Fundido - their exclusive blend of cheeses, manchego, asadero, monterrey jack & cilantro, melted in a cazuela (cast iron dish) & served w/ fresh hand made flour tortillas.  The cheese blend was alright (not great and not terrible) but the homemade flour tortillas were really good (which was almost like a fresh out of the oven pita bread-ish thin puck of yumminess).

I also ordered their ""Santa Rosa Barbacoa de Puerco"" - Marinated pork slowly roasted in a banana leaf, served with cilantro rice, black beans & a chipotle barbecue sauce.  
The pork was definitely very tender and went well with the chipotle sauce. The combination of the beans, pork, sauce and cilantro rice in one bite was superb. 

Only thing that can make this better is the plate presentation, because it looks like the presentation style of your average Mexican fare (from taco trucks to mom & pop diners).

Would I order this again? Yes.

What didn't impressed me was the dessert that my cousin ordered, which was the ""Corn Crème Brûlée"" - sweet corn custard with seasonal fruits. It was your average crème brûlée that pretty much any pastry arts student can prepare after taking a Baking class in any of the local culinary programs.  And the ""seasonal fruits"" is one single solitary raspberry covered up by a sprig of mint. (A+ for driving down your food cost on this item)

In summary, the food we ordered for the most part were tasty (of course I didn't tried their tacos, which seems to have a few negative reviews), the service we received was good, plate presentation is definitely not going to win any medals or awards, perceived value for the meal and experience is average.

Would I come back for more?  Yes. But I will for sure skip their dessert offerings and head over to Bouchon Bakery.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,0,0,3,TTU6WYSWZo2ZZXd1Ro0SmA

Chips and guac: Bf wanted side of guac for his burrito, and waitress suggested getting this ($8) as it comes with chips, salsa, and a big tub of guac rather than $6 for a tiny dish of it. She was right...salsa is AMAZING! Guac was plenty flavorful with a slight kick, and the chips were light, fresh, and salty yum! Not oily or heavy at all :)

Chicken burrito: Yum. Came in a big plate with rice, lettuce/tomatoes, and black beans. Wet burrito...very filling and flavorful. It was a wonderful dish.

Ceviche sampler: Came with a different type of tortilla chips...thicker and flaky with some seasoning. The crab-shrimp ceviche was AMAZING and the lemon added a zing to it. Ahi tuna/mango was very good as well, but you really need to mix it in the sauce otherwise it has a slightly fishy smell. The fish ceviche was okay, but rather plain and the oil really threw me off. The sampler as a whole was not bad though.

I think the bf and I found a new restaurant for us to be regulars at! Very relaxing atmosphere, good food at a decent Vegas price....what more can we want? Only thing is that for happy hour, the well drinks (whiskey and coke for instance) comes in a super tiny cup...may not be worth it.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,0,0,4,ce6iJP4t0-suSgqpplMKDQ

Our server was pleasant but there were gaps in delivery. For instance we asked for onions and tomatoes on the side and the tacos were delivered with them right on top. Luckily, the onions were big chunks that could be easily removed. We ordered an avocado, since there guacamole is made in the morning, not fresh to order. The avocado was delivered late and keep in mind this is just avocado in a bowl not a fancy presentation.
The salsa was salty and not that interesting.
With all of the above why am I rating a 4 ... because the tacos were delicious! We ordered a trio: pork, chicken, and beef. Good stuff.

5990826,2008-05-27,1,BEplfZTUzYwApjMUaOA12w,"In order to fairly review Taqueria Canonita, I have to tell a story to that will highlight our interesting, but wonderful experience. Here goes:

I was dining here with 2 friends and their mother. We were craving for Mexican food and decided to give Taqueria Canonita a try in the Venetian Canal Shoppes. We were greeted and only waited for about 3-5 minutes, which was remarkable given that this was on Sunday afternoon on a holiday weekend. The place was plenty big and had very pleasant seating right on the canal as well as inside. We eventually found a table right on the canal and it really felt like we were seated outdoors. Anyway, our waiter was a very kind and professional gentleman. He immediately offered to bring us some drinks and chips/salsa. So, to fast forward a bit, here's the INTERESTING part. My friend's mother (who is 65 years old) accidentally knocked over her glass of sangria. Some of the sangria happened to splash on some European tourists sitting right behind her. We jumped in immediately and offered help clean up the mess, and we apologized for the incident. My friend's mother felt just terrible! It was obviously purely an accident by an old lady who is on the verge of losing her senses. However, the European tourists were completely and totally unforgiving and ruthless towards us. I believe they were from Yugoslavia, Croatia, France, or maybe Russia (I'm going to be careful here), but they were definitely European of some sort. Immediately the European woman at the opposing table accused my friend's mother (who can't speak or understand English may I add) in a scornful and direct manor. She bluntly told us (pointing finger), ""You have to pay for that! That's my son's new t-shirt!""  Next, the wait staff rushed out and cleaned up the mess. Our waiter told us to just relax and not let it ruin our day. The waiter brought out my friend's mother a replacement glass of sangria and assured us that the restaurant will take care of any cleaning expenses for the shirt, because ""accidents happen."" He was a gentleman about it. Meanwhile, at the opposing table, the European tourists were throwing a hissy fit towards the restaurant manager and wait staff, demanding that they pay for the shirt and waive the bill that ""they"" (we) caused. The manager patiently listened to the demands and offered to pay for the cleaning expenses. That wasn't enough, however. They wanted the reimbursement of a brand new shirt (which looked like just a plain white t-shirt may I add) as well as to waive the bill. It seemed to me that they were taking advantage of the situation. The European woman then pointed her finger at my friend and told her to come over, and once again she asked us how we were going to pay for the shirt and/or cleaning expenses. At this point, all of us are pretty much in shock and awe, and we all just completely lost our appetite. Eventually, the European tourists and the manager came to a compromise and gave them one half off the bill and they offered to pay for the cleaning expenses for the t-shirt. Obviously the European tourists believed this compromise was unreasonable and they were not happy about it at all. Why he (the manager) didn't give into their full demands, his reasoning was once again, ""Accidents happen.""  As the European tourists were leaving their tables, the woman confronted our table and said in a snobby way, ""If the restaurant wants us to pay for our entire bill, then you pay for it!""  She walked off before my friend got the chance to say anything back. Apparently they walked away from the table without paying for any of the bill, even after the deduction.

Before I conclude, I'd like to make a note that the food was truly excellent and even if the incident didn't happen, I would still rant and rave about the service I received. Oh yeah, did I mention the food here is excellent?

Why do I go through this long story? Because it highlights not only wonderful customer service, but also human understanding. The wait staff and management at Taqueria Canonita clearly went above and beyond expectations towards their customers. They were extremely accommodating and did everything in their power to make a rigid situation smooth, in spite of some bitchy customers... and they did it like gentlemen. We ended up giving them a $50 tip on a $90 dollar bill.  Thank you, Taqueria Canonita, for truly exceeding expectations and delivering outstanding customer service.",hGpyShURS3PXOAvR5lFL2w,1,2,5,MVZVcXW7g9kN-obtStCjVw
