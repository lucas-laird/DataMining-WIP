Went here just to try it out and I have to say I like this place. It's not too crowded, delicious food, and the staff is really friendly. I ordered the Chocolate Love drink, which is my favorite so far. Oysters are delicious and even more delicious during happy hour because you get 10 oysters for $5.50. Spicy Ahi ($12.95 not included during happy hour) is probably my favorite, I highly recommend trying it! Nachos with ground beef is a big portion, good to share, as for taste I have to say it was pretty good. Wings was a bit dry and over cooked.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,1,4,KiSuRkzxAulCdns62TldYA

The bar service on the first visit was the worst I have ever experienced. They have this Jersey Shore reject with NO SKILL as a bartender- she is slow, lazy, forgetful, easily confused and down right rude. No joke, I cannot think of one redeeming quality she exhibits. We had intended on ordering some food but just couldn't stand to be in her presence any longer. 

The second visit was better- the bartender was decent and the service was moderately better (but it was also an exceptionally slow night). Of the 3 dishes we ordered the spicy Ahi tuna is the only one worth mentioning- the tuna was decent quality and prepared very well.

At the end of the day you have to ask- there are 5 other bars in the area with the same type of food and atmosphere- why bother with this place?",kZXg8y7GVvGGKT4jVeSs8w,1,0,2,IQgQD-c0POvm9UlHLSUkJA

The good, 
The food is delicious. All of the burgers are amazing. Happy Hour.

The bad
You never really know what your gonna get. The food takes FOREVER sometimes.

Incident 1
I ordered a Tex Mex burger on a previous visit. It was one of my favorite burgers I've had. It had spicy sauce on it and large peppers. I ordered it again and it was a totally different burger. No sauce at all, a few little peppers, but thats it. Lettuce tomato and a few little peppers. Both times the burger took over 40 mins.


Incident 2
Me and my girlfriend stopped in. She ordered a parfait and I ordered a burger. About 15 minutes later the bartender asks if cereal is ok for the parfait. They ran out of granola. My girlfriend says yes. 15 minutes after that, my burger comes out. It takes another 10 minutes for the parfait. The parfait is not a parfait. It's frosted flakes, with a little fruit and whipped cream instead of yogurt. This took over 30 minutes to make? We received a free appetizer card for the trouble. But, they did not even take the ""parfait"" off the bill.

Incident 3
Me and a couple friends decided to go for beers and food. One of my friends couldn't decide what he wanted. The bartender told him about a pollenta dish that was good. He ordered it. 15 minutes later he notified him they were out of pollenta.

I don't know if the kitchen is always short stocked, or if the chefs don't care.
Even after all of this, I would still recommend the food. It's great for bar food.  Really good. I just might not be going back for a while.",z4tVDFAUQYC7WS2zV2fPBw,1,1,3,G42qLb0HPi3yix6tVluWTg

Ok, I'll admit that it's pretty horrible for a 28 year old man to be quoting Paula Abdul songs, but come on, you thought of it too right?  Right?

I came here for lunch the other day, here are a few random ratings:

Gia (bartender) - 4 stars  Nice, friendly, and made me a delicious cocktail.  I was drinking vodka lemonade, which I don't normally mess with, but it was wicked hot out.  Gia kept it strong, and not too sweet, like the governator.  

Poker Machines - 0 stars It took my money.  

Hawaiian Burger - 3 stars  This burger was cooked to my specifications, had  a delicious pineapple slaw, melted cheese, and jalapenos.  The jalapenos were canned and had that salty, pickled flavor.  It would be immensly more tasty using fresh peppers.  

Sweet Potato Fries - 5 Stars  Perfectly crispy, light, and tasty.  Maybe the best sweet potato fries in town.

I came here with my boyfriend yesterday at 7:30am for breakfast. We decided to come here because they have some island style dishes on their breakfast menu, like Hawaiian French Toast,  Loco-Moco, and Island Breakfast. Unfortunately we never got to try ANY of that because when we got there, the door was locked. There was a buzzer to press to get someone's attention, but they never came, despite the fact that we buzzed FOUR times and waited for 10 minutes just standing there. As we waited, we peered through the windows. There was loud music playing and the lights were all on, but we didn't see a single person. We knew their had to be at least two employees in there though because there was a motorcycle and a silver suv parked right out front and those were the only other cars in the parking lot besides ours. We even went as far as looking up their phone number so we could call them two times, but still, NO ONE ANSWERED. I don't know if the people were sleeping or doing something else, but I really don't think this place should be ""open 24 hours"" if they won't even open their doors for breakfast!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,2,0,1,aofPXN0ggtTwLnbyAsnteQ

So on my first visit back I had a Restaurant.com coupon for this place and was very excited to try it again. Unfortunately, their kitchen was closed and they were out of almost everything at the bar. But the bartender was nice enough about it explaining that they had just had two big parties over the weekend. No big deal, we'd be back.
On our return visit, the kitchen was open, but they were out of a lot of stuff, so we decided to just get their tapas. The tacos, both chicken and steak, were bland and the poke was not poke but 3 big chunks of tuna with soy sauce on it, I was also given the wrong drink. . . with not so much as an ""I'm sorry"" or ""I'll make you another one"". 
When we were asked how the meal was, my dining companion answered truthfully, and the bartenders response was ""Well you ate everything."" The cook was standing nearby and asked the bartender if he should remake or comp the food, his response ""No, they have a coupon anyway"" And to top it all off, when I went to pay, the bartender made a comment about the fact that I was paying, so why should my friend complain about the food. 
The meal might have only been $10, but I'd rather pay full price to get decent service, good food and not be insulted.",B6ywe-1bgxV4geJY2zh-mQ,0,1,1,ApMRYcrw-Y5c6RKGktpDrQ

We sat at the bar, per the bartenders request.  He said he could serve us better there.  And, boy did he! He was so friendly and funny.  Really nice throughout.  

We agreed on sharing three apps.  It was 1/2 price wings so we couldn't resist a bargain. We also ordered the queso de camarones and irish potato fritters.  The wings were good.  No complaints there.  The queso de camarones was described as melted cheeses with shrimp, artichokes and spinach, served with chips.  Words cannot describe the sludge we were served.  The consistency was so odd.  It was almost like mashed potatoes??  Furthermore, it wasn't cheesy or flavorful as anticipated.  The irish potato fritters were not fritters at all.  There were a bland, boring potato cake.  Not the light fluffy ""fritter"" I imagined.

The bar side had several people who sounded like they were having lots of fun, but we went to the empty dining room side.  They were low on staff, so the bartender/perhaps manager/owner was serving us and you could tell it wasn't his normal area.  
Service was slow and we ordered crab cakes, seared ahi tuna and a burger.
The crab cakes were ok, the ahi tuna was bleh and the burger seemed pretty good.
We ordered two drinks, and they were the highlight of the meal!  So if I were to go back, I'd go back for drinks!",P8zNvht_iXkpkv74yrNUEA,3,0,3,C01CB8NQAMmOmrC7v5zJ9A

Soup of the day--some sort of tomato and pasta soup.  The pasta was beyond mush, not edible.  I got the pecan crusted salmon with sauteed spinach and red potatoes.  The salmon was abnormally fishy--perhaps not the freshest?  But the pecan crust and balsamic drizzle were tasty.  The spinach was sauteed in (what seemed like) the equivalent of an entire tub of margarine.  I had to put a paper drink napkin under the spinach to try to soak up some of the margarine...a completely drenched napkin later, I sill had margarine spinach.  For the cost of the amount of margarine used they could have used a teaspoon of REAL butter.  The red potatoes I was expecting were home fries (breakfast potatoes).  My husband's Cajun chicken sandwich was as he described, they driest sandwich he'd ever eaten.  The potato salad that came with the sandwich was amazing, however.  For dessert, creme brulee, which the menu indicated as a restaurant favorite.  Hmm, it was more eggy than creme brulee should be, and was left unfinished--a rare occurrence in our history of encounters with this tasty dessert!  The service was also very slow and inconsistent.  The table next to us ordered a cup of soup right after us and got it 10 minuets before us.

From the other Yelp reviews it seems better to stick to traditional bar food--basically stay away from the second half of the dinner menu.",ShmXY90SPzBXUoQMGOQLUA,0,0,2,MFmN_cp8dmV9NNJ7XROeXQ

We had so much food we took half home and had lunch the next day.  We also took dessert home, which was awesome.

Our server was wonderful and one of the owners stopped by to say hi, when we mentioned we were from his home state of Ohio.

4974724,2010-10-08,7,BN_GVKaX0jnaVI4Ar1iV2w,"Since the takeover of Red Stone Grill, we've been meaning to visit Straight Up Gaming and Martini Lounge.  A recent  Yelp event gave us a taste, which was a good thing since we found ourselves in the neighborhood earlier this week.

I remember they were offering Happy Hour from 4 pm to 7 pm, so we scooted our butts in for some Monday night football.

Happy Hour means half all appetizers (except the Spicy Ahi) and $2 off drinks.

After walking in and the bartender greeting us, we took a seat in the dining room in front of the large screen.  With a pretty decent selection of apps to choose from, we decided on four:

* Potato Pancakes ""Ham, potato and chive pancakes with applesauce and your choice of horseradish or sour cream."" ($7.99)  Four pancakes that are lightly fried and tasty.  We automatically got sour cream with ours, which was no biggie since we didn't even remember horseradish was an option.

* Crab Cakes ""Crab cakes drizzled with our creamy mustard sauce and pineapple relish."" ($10.95) - You actually get crab cakes, as in the plural, when you order this.  Three to be exact.  And the creamy sauce added to this dish very nicely.  You can tell there's definitely a decent amount of crab and not just filler in these cakes.

* Chicken Wings ""Ten wings served with celery, carrots and your choice of ranch or bleu cheese dressing.  Available in BBQ, Honey Mustard, Teriyaki, or Buffalo style."" (Boneless $11.95 / Traditional $10.95)  The Husband remembers seeing other yelpers order this from before, so he was game to get his own share.  I was surprised when the order of 11 wings showed  up.  He chose boneless and buffalo style.  They were meaty pieces of poultry and what a steal at half off! 

* Queso Cammarones ""Shrimp, artichoke hearts and sauteed spinach, melted together in a blend of provolone, romano and parmesan cheeses.  Served with tortilla chips."" ($8.95) - Your basic artichoke and spinach dip, but taken to a new level with shrimp hidden underneath.  It's a heavy dish and you definitely need to share this one for sure! 

Service - what can I say?  Our waitress was friendly, the owner said hello when he passed by, and someone from the kitchen came by to chat with us not once, but twice!  And the bartender thanked us for coming in when we left!  They are a friendly bunch here!  We even got little martini shakers as gifts during out visit! 

Other appetizers worth checking out would be their oysters on a half shell, bleu cheese tomatoes, and red pepper hummus! Next time!

Overall, I'm always pleased when I find a restaurant with great happy hour specials and Straight Up definitely offers some good ones! 

They also have different events for each day...better call ahead to double check if they are still going on though!

Mondays: Buy One Get One Specialty Martini 1/2 off 7 pm to close; karaoke at 10 pm with Karate Karaoke

Tuesdays: 2 for 1 Tacos, 2 for 1 Coronas, $4 Margaritas

Wednesdays: Live Jazz at 9 pm

Thursdays: 50% Off Specialty Martinis for Ladies from 7 pm to midnight

Fridays: Live Hawaiian and Reggae Bands at 11 pm

Saturdays: Beauty Industry receive $3 off Specialty Martinis and 50% Appetizers

Sundays: Sunday Brunch at 10 am to 2 pm; Hospitality Industry receive 50% food and drinks all day; Wii Games from 6 pm to closing with a winner getting a free well drink!

Update!  We returned the following week...

* Roasted Red Pepper Hummus ""Served with crispy tortilla chips."" ($6.95) - It's served with pita chips, not tortilla chips.  But that wasn't the problem, the hummus was really dried out.  Not sure if they make their own, but it was definitely lacking in olive oil.  I thought I had tried it before at an event, but I guess not.  Nonetheless, I brought home the leftovers and added some EVOO to help bring it back to life.  It still was lacking.

We also ordered the chicken wings again and attempted to order their ""Spicy Garlic"" style, which was something off the menu.  Unfortunately, the day we went, that chef working wasn't familiar with that style.  He did offer to make it for us, but we decided to stick with what was on the menu.  They also ran out of ranch dressing.  We were told they make it fresh, and the waitress was able to scrape up a little bit of what was left.  But by the time she asked if I needed more, the wings were done. Oh well.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,14,11,4,c0N20GsjcbfAPsfXJr1l2A

We ordered a cheesesteak and the nachos. Let's sum it up. All were measly and pathetic. Seems to be the theme they're  striving for here. You've seen the scenes in movies where everyone is sitting down at thanksgiving dinner awaiting the glorious carving of the turkey and with one stab the turkey bursts open hollow and dry as a bone? That's their fries....but at least the turkey is hot. Nachos were made with, again, cheap ingredients and with some serious portion control. Icing on the cake?
