12655,2014-02-12,2,BQKPbuILIAG53XtIZ51s5Q,"Ah Tommy's, you either love it or hate it. If you like greasy, calorie-packed, delicious fast food and like reflecting poorly on your diet plan, then Tommy's is the place to go. You can't go wrong with a double-cheeseburger with chili-cheese fries! Tommy's is by far one of the best burger joints on the west coast, easily up there with in-n-out, possibly better. The chili resembles something that you can buy in a pet aisle, but it makes up for it's awful looks in it's personality (like that one girl in college that always wondered why you never wanted to hang out in public with her). Not too spicy, not too mild, a perfect taste and an ultimate addition to any of their meals. 

     If you aren't that thirsty don't buy a large drink, it's big enough to get you five years in prison if you walked outside with it in New York. But if you're willing to take on the bucket of carbonated sugar-syrup than by all means go to town. Don't pay too much attention to the bad reviews on here, some people just don't appreciate a tantalizing meal like Tommy's can serve up! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of location. VERY eye-catching, but the parking lot holds only a handful of cars, so you'll have to park a little ways away, but you'll need to burn the calories anyways. So whether you're heading home from work or taking your prom date out for the fancy meal she's waited her whole high-school career for, Tommy's is most definitely the place to go, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",pTeDkzMDPeYmj_f1Z8Y8fw,3,0,4,6k9l-z59uqfZkgL-_aVVtQ

The grease has made me feel sick a number of times but somehow I keep coming back here - it is addicting. Until they posted the calories then I took a hiatus out of guilt but I still love it. Yes, it is horribly unhealthy and greasy but somehow it is just so good. You have to get chili though - I recently went here with someone who ordered the California burger with no chili - and this is just a no no, if you are not going to get chili then the burger in itself is much better elsewhere. 

The chili makes it, some sort of beanless chili. I usually get the cheeseburger and if it is really a splurge then chili cheese fries.  Also, they have brewed ice tea - another plus and you can ask for sport peppers on the side.

The chili is a weird sticky/greasy concoction that they dump on everything. It barely tastes like anything... They give samples to everyone before they order, I think because they KNOW it's horrible and most people will hate it.

I've been going to Tommy's locations my whole life and so when I saw all the negative reviews about this one I figured this one just wasn't on their game, maybe bad owners, but nonetheless I obviously took a gamble.

No. This Tommy's is exactly how I've experienced Tommy's my whole life.

Yes, it's greasy. Yes, the chili is thick and it's certainly questionable what's in it...but it's always been like that!!!!! Pink's Hotdogs chili is the same way...but people love that stuff.

I enjoyed my meal... I got a chili cheese dog and chili cheese fries, and it was my boyfriend's first time there, someone with no preconceived expectations, and he loved it.

If you're expecting something gourmet, you need to take your prissy self somewhere else. 

Other reviewers were saying it was too expensive for them. For us, 2 chili cheese dogs, chili fries and a medium drink cost us like 12 bucks. .....So.....

The employees were also super nice. It's a fast food place, don't expect them to kiss your ass.

It didn't take long for our food to arrive and it looked so damn good. I ordered the caliente burger combo. The caliente burger is their original chili burger, but it has chipotle cheese and sliced cascabella chilies on it. I wanted an extra beef patty on it which cost $1.40 and was worth it. I like how you can ask for extra chili on your burger for no extra charge. My burger was great, my fries were great, I was happy. The side of chilies really hit the spot too. It is nice that the food tastes consistent and just like I remember from eating at Tommy's when I lived in southern California. 

Not much parking out front, but This location is really tucked into a corner so you will need to most likely park in the strip mall parking which isn't far away.

What sets them apart is their chili, so order that (not a plain burger). A chili burger, cheese fries and a side of chili. Because I love crispy fries, adding chili on top makes it too mushy for my liking. They serve breakfast too. Egg & sausage sandwiches or burritos. Always hits the spot.

The only downfall was it was all the way on the other side of town by St. Rose Hospital. I live in the northwest and am rarely on that side of town so I only had it once.

I just love their chili. It does not have any beans in it and its spiced perfectly. I like it so much sometimes I go there just for the chili which they sell in to-go cups.

Their food isn't the knock off chili like weinersnitzel . It's good stuff. I definitely suggest the chili cheese burgers with pickles.

As far as the service here, it's always hit or miss... I'm always worried about if they are going to get my order right or not because it has been wrong before (onions when there wasn't suppose to be) that's why I took away a star . 

I love the fact that they have a drive thru and the fact that they are open 24 hours and their prices are pretty reasonable and so are their portions!",uvkN1gf9VyVArxB-8qAaoQ,5,2,4,iJ--Z9ZIG4F7tBLIP533cg

I spotted the 2.99 meal deal for Tommy's and I had to go. 2.99 for a Chili topped cheese burger, fries and a drink ? I'm down. As soon as you walk in, you feel like you've just walked into a in n out burger. The same tile, merch for sale on the wall, the historic photos on the walk, you just get that vibe. The menu is much bigger than in n out, so the choices are harder to make. I ordered my meal and sat down waiting to get my name called but I looked up to be surprised that it was delivered to me. She asked if I wanted banana peepers, I said yes and turned around to see she placed them on my table instantly. I wish I had cash to tip her but all I could of really done is smile and wave. Well actually I could of left her my number but let's stick with food here. The fries were extremely hot aka fresh fries. They weren't thin or steak fry thick, more of a Chilis, TGI Friday, Applebee style feel to them if I was compared. Chili and cheese should of been an idea for me but it slipped my mind. Animal style would of been perfect for them as well. The burger, THE BURGER, well want to talk about heavy and messy. Peppers, onion, tomato, cheese burger, bun and SO MUCH CHILI. You don't really taste the burger but the Chili with the veggies taste great. The Chili oozes it everywhere so don't eat this and drive because I would feel safer if you drank then drive then try to eat this messy burger. Personally, I love messy foods so I had a spoon ready to go. The food was great, the coca cola was SO fresh and the place was clean. The employees were super nice too.

Got home abd ate dinner. The burger wasn't anything special but it was pretty good. The chili is a very simple chili with no spice to it but a decent flavor. 

The fries were standard steak fries with very little salt. 

What made the meal was the yellow peppers that I was offered with my meal. Those are what give the burger some spice and really made the food perfect.",zrHCaBd4jMWgI2QrfTwfEw,2,1,4,F6zIce1oiqnEXSG2BOiqAQ

I would give it 5 stars based on cleanliness, but I wasn't there to check for roaches. It reminded me of In-N-Out... Same set up, same colors, they even sell t-shirts and other ""souvenirs"" and such (same parent company, maybe?).

I'm giving it a one because the chili may as well have been (and probably was) grease. It was totally flavorless (I'm not sure which brand of canned chili they were using, but they need to switch brands, or add something to the mix), and probably needed to be stirred in the pot a little before it was served. I wound up with an upset stomach for a couple of hours, and felt like vomiting until I got home and passed out on the couch... And even after I woke up, I still wasn't right. 
The burger and fries were pretty greasy, to the point that I could see the grease dripping off the burger, and the fries turning the paper they were on road-worker Orange. I ate the burger, but left about 3/4 of the fries (at about $11 for the meal, I'm at least going to eat the main part of it).
And what's with the two and a half cans of chili on each, the burger AND fries? Don't get me wrong--I like chili cheese burgers just as much as the next guy, but with all that greasy chili, it seems like all I got was CHILI... And not good chili, but greasy, flavorless, heartburn-inducing, stomach-upsetting chili.

As we got in the car to leave, I decided that I would never eat at this restaurant again... At least not the one at this location.",SzxumFo0hWgdLh1kauCdzA,3,1,1,VCO-muWRVDp9xtNe9-PRwg

The location sucks, being tucked in the corner of an afterthought of  a parking lot. There is practically no parking near the front door. You have the empty  location of the previous BUZZ BBQ where people can actually see you and park close to the door that would have been a better choice.

There's got to be something wrong with anyone who doesn't flip over these cheeseburgers.  

One way to order them: Chili and cheese only, extra chili.  And, if you're in the mood, extra cheese.  It's American cheese which is perfect.  For those of you who've never had the fortune to try a burger, know ahead that the chili is not the kind you'd eat with a fork, or spoon.  Well, I would......but....  It's very blended and yes has some bright orange oil from the ingredients, and so be it I say!  

A little embarrassing, but do admit, I actually make noises reflecting my appreciation with each delectable bite.  This place should be far more crowded all the time, as it is in Los Angeles.  I wish they would advertise and show video clips of the line at the Los Angeles east L.A., maybe get some fans to rave.

The burger patties are super thin and when I tried to taste the meat by itself, all I could taste was the toppings. On the Caliente, it only comes with one patty so I felt like I was eating a chili sandwich with onions and peppers. They do have really good buns though so that's a plus. 

Maybe my mistake was not getting a double or maybe even a triple burger. It may sound like a lot but the patties are so thin and I just couldn't taste the meat at all.

There isn't much parking directly out front of this Tommy's (there is handicapped parking) however this Tommy's shares the whole parking lot with the rest of the shopping center and it isn't a far walk at all. If you are a true Tommy's fan the few extra steps wont kill you and since you are likely to be eating chili here you can use those few extra steps! There is also a drive-thru. It appears that because the drive-thru has little space that they only put in the few spots up front to detour accidents and want customers to park in the shared shopping center spaces.

It didn't surprise me to see this place packed when I walked in. There was a long line of hungry customers. I got in line while hubby kept an eye out to snag a table. The girl who took my order was very friendly and repeated my order to make sure it was right. I then made my way to fill up our drinks while the order was being made and grab some good ole Tommy's napkins. The napkins here are more like paper towels and necessary when eating here! 

The food was ready and I was ready to dig in! I ordered a #4 ""Chili Cheese Dog, Fries and drink"" priced at $8.55 after requesting my drink be a large and adding chili, cheese, mustard and onion to the fries. Yum! I had to cut the chili dog in half and share it because it was hearty. The fries were delicious and held up the chili and other toppings perfectly. Hubby ordered the ""Caliente Burger Combo"" and gobbled it up. Our friend ordered a ""Chili Tamale"" priced at $3.25 and he really enjoyed it. We left very full and satisfied! 

Anybody who has been to the original location at Beverly and Rampart knows the nostalgia that goes with that location. There will never be another like it, but we can certainly be thankful to have a location right here in Las Vegas to go to and make memories.

4014452,2014-02-07,2,BQKPbuILIAG53XtIZ51s5Q,"College nostalgia has set in!  Remember back at UNLV when we used to drive to Cali for the weekend one of our stops would be Tommy's Hamburgers along the way.  The chili!  The grease!  The calories!  The tummy ache!  Crazy tasty!

I've been waiting for this Original Tommy's to open for months!  It is literally only minutes away from my humble abode.  Even though I am close, I choose to visit Tommy's on a non-regular basis.  Maybe only once or twice a month.  Read the board at Tommy's and you'll see why!  Yes, they post the caloric contents for their items...just like the ones in Cali.  So, so bad.  

Yes, Tommy's is hit and miss with many folks.  Some swear by it, the meat, the cheese, the fries.  Others are totally lost on the concept.  Why is there chili on everything?  Why you ask?  Because without it it's not a Tommy's burger.  The chili is what sets them apart.  Come on, you go to McDonald's and wonder what to eat?  Most times you'll end up with fries or chicken 'McNuggets'.  You just do.  Same at Tommy's.  Just do.

By itself the chili is just OK.  It's got some spice and taste, but it ain't pretty.  Oh no, not pretty chili at all.  It is akin to something you might feed your beloved family pet, I'll give you that.  But it's subtle enough that it works on almost everything on Tommy's menu.  Burger with chili.  Yep.  Fries with chili.  Yep.  Hot dog with chili.  Yep.  Breakfast burrito with chili.  Yep!  It adds some substance to an already greasy meal!  Please folks, don't come to Tommy's if:

1)  You don't want chili on your items
2)  You are on the HCG diet, or the Slim Fast diet, or the ""I don't eat anything with a face"" diet (you folks have obviously never had a rare ribeye before)

Do so and you will be greatly lead astray.  Tommy's is oily!  Greasy!  Will stick to your ribs!  And any other limb you are trying to tone up for that matter.  But hey, it's supposed to be!  Sometimes folks just wanna be fat, and enjoy eating that way.  I myself try to find a 'normal' balance somewhere in the middle.  I love fancy meals, sure, but I also love down-home cheap eats too.  I'll give almost all of it a whirl just to broaden my food perspective.  It's what good Yelpers should do!  

So, if you are a beginner here at Tommy's I suggest you tread lightly.  If you do a burger or chili here (you don't have to say ""with chili"" because it's basically automatic), don't do chili on your fries.  If you do the fries with chili, don't do a  burger or hot dog with chili (which you will have to say ""no chili"" because it's not automatic).  Do too much chili at one time and you don't have an iron gut?  Be prepared to hit the throne.  Hard.  It's a lot of food for one person!  Initiate yourself into the chili concept gradually.  

""I rarely have a chili burger, but when I do...I prefer Original Tommy's...""

Stay healthy, my friends!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,1,4,n5jMqfL07xB4ty3qdrT4xg

4142683,2013-09-25,9,BQKPbuILIAG53XtIZ51s5Q,"Oh Tommy, oh Tommy, you have let me down!

I have been patiently waiting and waiting for a Tommy's up on my side of town.  I have been watching the countdown for the new store on Craig to open for months now.  I was so happy today when I saw on Facebook you were finally open.  My heart was all aflutter and I couldn't get over there fast enough to grab a ridiculously messy and oh so good chili cheese burger and fries.  And then it went downhill...

First, the location itself is tucked into a corner of a big shopping center.  There are only 3 parking spots near the restaurant.  Otherwise you have to park and walk across the entrance to the drive thru side which had a lot of cross traffic.  People were driving all sorts of crazy in this area, so be careful walking around here since there really isn't a clear path to walk on.

I actually had to do drive thru today because my kiddo had fallen asleep on the way over.  It is easy to get into the drive thru, but really tricky once you have picked up your food.  The driveway is very narrow and quite close to the building.  I drive a mid-size sedan and it was tight.  I feel bad for anyone is a big SUV or full size truck.  Pay attention or you might hit the wall.

Next, the order taker.  She was really quite friendly, but was on the pushy side.  I needed a second to review the board to know what to order for my daughter to eat later.  I asked to have a minute to check the board.  I think I got maybe 15 seconds before she was asking if I was ready to order yet.  There wasn't a line, so I am not sure why she was in such a rush.  

I went ahead and ordered and then she asked if I wanted to upsize my drink for an extra $.50.  I said very clearly, ""No thanks"" to which she said ""Ok.""  I assumed that meant I would getting a regular sized drink, silly me!  I get up to the window and she hands me a large soda, which I was totally charged for, so it wasn't just a mistake by whoever was serving up the sodas.  I told her I said a regular and she said she thought I said to upsize it.  I wasn't in the mood to argue, so I just took the drink.  I mean I love soda and can easy drink 2 liters in no time, but I am trying to be good and cut back on my soda addiction.  So much for that!  It was just fishy, in my opinion.  I don't know if the girl really made a mistake or wanted to improve her up-sell totals.  So watch out for that trap.

Next was my burger order.  I ordered a regular chili cheese burger.  I specifically asked to have no onions because they are yucky.  The girl told me that they only put onions on burgers if you request them.  I said great and to please keep them off of my burger.  So you can imagine my surprise when I got home, having been drooling over the burger next to me for the last 3 miles, and then took a big bite into my burger that was covered with ONIONS.  Ugh.  I have never seen so many onions, it was almost like i got an extra helping of them.  Fun times for sure.

So after I took a bite into my onion infested burger, I had to take a big swig of my giant soda to wash the onions down.  Guess what?  The soda mix was totally off.  I mean the place had been open for 2.5 hours by the time I was there.  How was the soda to syrup mix already goofed up?  So yes, I paid extra for gross soda.  

On the positive side, the burger was super tasty (once I picked all of the onions off) and smothered in delicious Tommy's chili and cheese.  The fries were simply amazing! I have no shame, so I scrapped all of the extra chili cheese off of the paper they were wrapped in. Yummmm, cheese paper.... If you haven't tried a Tommy burger, you really need too!

I still love Tommy's, even after all of the messes listed above.  I am giving this location the benefit of the doubt and giving them 3 stars.  It is their opening day, so maybe everyone is working out the kinks.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,9,6,3,Qlk2raxwJGiDERyzQgXaWw
4147088,2013-10-07,0,BQKPbuILIAG53XtIZ51s5Q,"I am thrilled this Tommy's location is finally open.  It has been a long time coming.  Despite a rather crappy location being behind the rest of a shopping center and visible from the street after driving past, people who are in the know and support such an historic piece of SoCal culture will keep this burger joint open hopefully for years to come.  It is a little strange driving under a low lying and quite large billboard when going through the drive-thru.  And it is equally strange being in a long and narrow drive-thru along side a flood channel.  But the product within this strange complex is what I know and love as the Original Tommy's.  

I usally get the same order when I go.  I get a double cheese burger with everything.  That is a burger with two meat patties, cheese, rib sticking chili, a thick slice of tomato, diced onion, pickles and mustard.  Add some regular fries to scoop the chili drippings off the paper and you are set.

Some times I switch up my order a bit and get a chili tamale.  This is a tamale with chili and all the other fixin's from the burger.  It is almost every bit as good.  Worth a try.  If you are a breakfast person, try their burrito.  The last time I had one I had a BOGO coupon.  I ate the first burrito and had to save the other for lunch.

I got a burger but since I had chili cheese fries already, I got just a classic california one. It was ""meh"".

When we ordered they messed it up and rang us 3 burgers, two classics and the clientele. When we told them, they refunded our money for the extra burger, but told us to keep it. I took it home and the pugs and cat split the cheese and meat patty.

Meat, chili, and carbs... this is the place if you're into that kind of indulgence.  Giddy up! 

4 stars for the food, minus 1 star for the health factor.",Mv55A30nEcAl3vk4qow5dA,1,0,3,OjAF3eSi95GI_zLTPDX7sg

Also during peak summer this place actually has the ac on a comfortable level when many other businesses try and save money having their customers sweat in 85 degree indoor temps.",LrMmtYJa6XmHG37LJNFtPw,0,0,5,rT-Pz_E1ohdYJjEJHslgAg

A worker came out swept it up and threw it outside like if nothing happened. I've been here a couple times in the past but won't be returning. I don't need to wonder if that's only chili on my food, or if it's roaches.",-SOSiI1EWAaHfMqIIFljeg,0,0,1,qoau9XU55sOp4PS-9-rRGw

I have been eating them since the 1970's in Los Angeles and am happy that there is a Tommy's close to home. They have had a consistently good burger for all these years and I'm happy I've been a customer of theirs. The store on Craig is a good one with kind and personable staff with a clean dining room.

It's like a tasteless greasy orange bean paste similar to Jack in the box tacos , only they have flavor. An orange grease come running out of the chili..and if you're not really crazy about the chili..well guess what they smother all your food on it. It is heartburn inducing stomach churning slop. The burgers themselves are the thinnest patties of frozen texture meat. Real cheap. I will never eat at another Tommy's again.",-Ia1lWvBNdgGySyB2VSgNQ,2,1,1,r0i5P6Hf3IEJgadQVkTZPw

To be honest the food wasn't good. The chili didn't have a taste at all and I'd rather of got chili out of a can from a store and put i on my burger and fries. Sitting there with my girlfriend l, as we both ate we looked at each other and pretty much both said Wiener schnitzel had better chili. I'm giving it a 3 only because the service was good and place was clean but it would of got a 2 star if the service was also bad.",TQifqbmeO0Zc0Pg6jqZdsg,2,1,3,J_uu3bJjx7QXdTIy2p6Chg
