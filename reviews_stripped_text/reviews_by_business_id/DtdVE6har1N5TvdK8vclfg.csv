569590,2012-03-12,0,DtdVE6har1N5TvdK8vclfg,Friendly staff and remarkable pizza!!! They have great prices and the food is delicious. We went there with our Groupon coupon and ended up buying more food because they all tasted awesome. Pizza crust itself is enough to go there. My children loved the buffalo wings and the Garlic-con-Queso wings. It was our first time there but we will definitely be regular customer after now on.,1mxHqM2ChTDI-mc10M_ojw,0,0,5,Oe0pNbrshnNW6qpeBmDCkw

No frills place, but who cares. Tasty!",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,1,1,5,9c-biCMK-imRxLHRCzwfYw

Shop purposely cut back on toppings for whatever reasons. It's silly because if pizza is bad, at least the toppings can save it. Learned my lesson. Don't waste your time here.",fcWwf97oGGDvZj_OrpAfKA,2,0,1,c_b5WFl6G4yx7Xdnm3oGbw
