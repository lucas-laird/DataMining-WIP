My daughter is allergic to pork, yet we wanted breakfast. Our server, Cathy, was very accommodating, and let us sub the chicken sausage pon the side with their special. Cathy let the kitchen know, and she says it would be a little longer because they needed to clean a grill (they cook the potatoes with the pork) 
We were fine with that!  Then the food came... My veggie frittata was flavorful, but the clear winner was the Coronado Special my kid & mom split was amazing! My kid doesn't eat even chicken sausage normally, but tried it. Her smile & face was wow! (Usually even chicken sausage has pork casings, patty has no casing).

I ordered the steak and eggs and it was just ok.  The steak didn't taste like much I had to add salt which was weird enough because I don't think I ever salt my meat lol.
The eggs were good and everyone else enjoyed their meals.  One person got a breakfast burrito and it was huge...better be for $9.99!  Someone else ordered a ham steak and eggs and he said it was delicious.  Really, really weird though, we had two people order steak and eggs the steaks were two very different cuts and the one that was to be well done seemed a lot juicier and tender then the medium rare one.  

Service was quick and the staff was decent and somewhat friendly.  IT WAS 4 AM I think I would be annoyed and irritated with just about everyone at that hour.  But I wasn't...I was hungry lol.

Overall ok not too bad for the price.  Will come again because it is 24/7 a bit away from the strip and still good enough to eat when you are hungover or just hungry for breakfast after a long night.

This so called manager rudely told my brother to sit up from the booth or she will call security on them ( my brother laid down to stretch his back because he have some lower back problem, but that besides the point).

 My brother sat up like he was told and told the manager that she didn't have to be so rude about it. That's were she lost it and called the security to kick my brother and his group out. They were not drunk nor they were loud or out of control. When I found out what happened, this manager started to lie about what had happened and was also giving me an attitude for asking her what had happened.

The porterhouse steak special is a HUGE let-down! It was tough and gristly, and just not good.

What makes this place special is 2 things.

1) they serve Chinese food.  Don't get me wrong its not the best ever but for this style of cafe, its great. (rice is a little dry sometimes)

2) the late night menu is the best!  From midnight til i think 5am you can get a maybe 8 or 9 different things dirt cheap.

Granted a lot of cafe's do some sort of late night menu.  I think the overall quality for what you are paying for is better here.  I may be off in my prices below but not by much.

biscuits and gravy for 1.45, a cheeseburger for 2.95 and the best, steak and eggs for 3.95.  I can't remember what the other items are.

My friends and I have gone here many a late night and the quality is always the same.  I think its hard to say that for regular restaurants let alone a 24hr cafe.

Sadly the word is out on this place and it has started to get a decent line were a year ago you could go right in.  Its still worth it as the wait is never too long.",OIvNpfJyF9mXoKcDSOocMA,0,0,4,G_rgFsCcVud6oILCglUsPg

I haven't eaten at this place before midnight but from browsing the menu, they have pretty high price points for a cafe. Their after midnight selections, though, are a totally different story. Steak and eggs for under $5, a cheeseburger and fries for under $3, and quite a few other options all under $5. They also offer Chinese food, which I have not tried either but have been told by a friend that the quality is quite tasty. 

On each of my visits after midnight, there has always been a line to be seated but never fear, the wait is never long, maybe 5 minutes tops. Once you are seated, the service is not the best but nowhere close to bad. All the employees, especially the ones who first greet you once you are seated, are very friendly and make it an effort to ensure that you are taken care of.

The Sweet & Sour Pork was way too sweet so we had to return it.  The Buddha Feast was not: it was a lot of non-Asian vegs of the rooty variety (carrots, brocolli, asparagus) instead of the tastier cruciferous Asian vegs such as bean sprouts, snow peas, onions, bell peppers, nappa cabbage, mustard greens, etc. Already sent a complaint to the buffet manager months ago about their bad service, but got no response so I don't expect to get 1 here either so I'm leaving my review here instead.

 I'm a a local and I work in the restaurant industry as well, so I know how service works. I came after watching a movie with my family and since I've only been here once with my husband for a late night dinner, we enjoyed it. As soon as we come in the door the host just points his finger to the host at the end of the restaurant meaning ""go to her she will sit you"" or so I think. We go and the hosts takes us to the booth . As we sat down he took our drink selections right away with a pretty emotionless face no smile no ""hello, how are we today"", nothing. So we did take about 5 minutes to order since it is a rather big menu selection, so we let the server know we still needed a few. more minutes to decide. I guess the server Marlon decided to take quite a long time to come back to us since we ended up waiting about 10-15minutes. When he finally did, we ordered and he acted with a careless attitude and said ""OK"" and left. OK, that's fine I guess. Then the food took quite a  long time, we were planning on leaving since the server was careless and everything seemed to be taking ages to come. But we didn't, we gave it another shot. My mother really didn't like the water soo much so she wanted a raspberry ice-t so when Marlon came walking by we asked him for one. Never came with one so we asked the young lady who refills the drinks to bring us one. She finally did with a smile as well.  Finally when the food came  at last, we eagerly ate with satisfaction that made me a litter happier. So then we don't find the server Marlon for about 20 minutes and my nephew and brother wanted ketchup and soy sauce ,we waited to see if he was ever going to show up again, he didn't,.. what a surprise. So I saw the manager and waved her down to see if SHE can bring the condiments to us she said ""Of course"" with a smile. I thank her for that ! we finally ate in peace and Marlon came at the end of it all and we asked for boxes, he came quickly with those! And we got the check and went to go pay. Thinking that was the worst ever, I was wrong!! The cashier was the rudest. When I asked her politely if she can split the check, she said 'yeah"" with a rude attitude. WHATEVER I thought!! Then as we signed the receipts I thought why tip, but MARLON was lucky to EVEN get a penny FROM ME,  but I gave him a dollar ANYWAYS because his quality of service was just that of a dollar. So as the cashier asked if we wanted our copies we said yes. And she gave me mine, then My mom didn't see her copy so she went back to her to ask for it POLITELY the rude ass lady slammed her hand on the copy and said ""HERE"". I'm sorry but if you don't have time to have a smile and manners to be in the service industry no matter how old you are you should QUIT and go elsewhere. I put up with the rudest people at my job but yet I have respect for anyone who has the decency to smile and act polite!! My family and I didn't deserve such shitty service, no one does!

This was hands down the WORST prime rib I have ever had. We came here on the recommendation of Anthony Curtis' Las Vegas Advisor website where it was described as a ""the big slab prime rib"". That was hardly a fitting description. The slice of prime rib I received was cut in a wedge shape. The wide edge was about  1/2"" thick and the opposite edge tapered down to zero. Nearly half of that was fat and gristle. What remained was simply flavorless. It came with a baked potato which was served lukewarm. The salad and rolls were okay but rather ordinary.

The service: The line is long. This is a popular steggs location. The service is friendly, but a bit disorganized. So 4 stars for service.

The food: Bleh. There were 6 of us. 6 orders of stegg medium rare. Steggs is 7oz new york steak, 2 eggs, a side of hash and toast. We received 6 different quality of steaks. 1 medium rare, 4 medium, 1 well, 1 almost rare. My steak was well and very dry. The eggs: I asked for scrambled and the waiter asked "" Do you want real eggs"". What there are fake eggs (probably egg substitutes and the like)?
Real eggs scrambled = country scramble. The hash: very typical. A little bit crispy on top, but mostly mushy. The toast: I got sour dough and I thought it was the best part of the entree. I liked my coffee though, but I was just happy to have decent coffee.

During a South Point stay in early May, we ended up at the Coronado three times.  Not because the quality of food was great, but rather because it was the path of least resistance whenever we wanted to eat quickly and somewhat inexpensive but still a sit-down meal.   For our three visits, while we were usually seated quickly, service thereafter was a mixed bag.   Sometimes our orders were taken promptly and the food soon came out, while another time we seemed to wait longer even though the place wasn't as crowded.    The dishes we chose did not all have the same level of quality to them.   A half Ham & Swiss sandwich was piled high with meat and was fairly tasty.   The ""George"" salad, however, was not good.   The choice of ingredients that comprised it did not seem to go well together, but worse would be the hard and unripe avocado slices that the evening's chef chose to serve it with.    For a breakfast meal, we split a Creole omelet, and that seemed OK.    Then on another dinner we tried the nightly special, which that evening was Salisbury Steak, and the Chicken Roma dish off the regular menu.   Both were decent.   The soups we had with the dinners were OK.   Nothing fantastic, but with exception of the salad we got, nothing horrible either.

I don't live far from SouthPoint so it's nice to have a cheap place to go to late at night after the gym when you realize that your fridge is completely empty. Thus is the life of a bachelor. This place has by far some of the best late night specials in Vegas, and believe me, I have frequented several others and they can't really hold a candle at 2am to Coronado Cafe.

The wait staff is hit or miss, but with hefty portions at $1.45-$3.95, how can you really complain?

Here's a couple of tips: 
1. If you order steak and eggs (and I really believe you should), be aware that they overcook the steak, so order it one degree more rare than you are accustomed to. Unless you like it overcooked.

2. There are no substitutions. Period, end of story. Fries instead of hash browns? Not going to happen. But thats okay, Just order the cheeseburger that comes with fries in addition to your steak in eggs. It's only $3! I tend to do this when I go with my bro and we split the burger and fries while each ordering steak and eggs.

3. Arrive between hours, like at the half. Avoid arriving at the top of the hour, for some reason the line tends to grow exponentially at 12, 1, and 2am. But if you arrive around 12:30, the line diminishes.  (I don't know why, but I am going to speculate that drunk people like to arrive closer to the top of the hour. Overcompensating )",UZd_TFUcSgO0gRzLPZ8eIg,8,2,5,9_KSVb7chqjc63SYwQiukA

Sometimes they are super busy, resulting in a long wait line. Sometimes you walk straight in. Depends on if there are any events or holidays or even weekends. I even had one experience where we came here late at night/early in the morning around 4-5am, on a memorial day weekend, and they ran out of steaks ! 

Due to their huge popularity of their midnight menu, their consistency ranges widely. If theres a lot of people, you have a fairly low chance in getting the correct cook temp on your steak. Being a guy who loves his medium rare steaks, you can't cook it for too long otherwise you'd go into the medium to medium well territory fairly easily. Huge cafe, tons of people, im pretty sure they don't have that many cooks doing the orders. Not easy to keep an eye on every single steak and pay attention to how through it has been cooked. 

Aside from the 3.95 steak n eggs, there's also other items on the menu like biscuits & gravy, ham steak & eggs, eggs & bacon/sausage, for different prices (lower than steak n eggs i believe) 

Steak & Eggs - $3.95 - 6 - 8oz ny strip with 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast. 

Meat quality isnt the greatest. Definitely you get for what you pay but at 12am, there's almost no other deal that you can get. 

As i had said before, i like my steaks medium rare, but also don't mind it being less than medium rare. So as one of my friends has taught me, i order RARE. Rare typically is a heat kissed steak with a cold, red center. Once in a while, i do get that, but usually the ""rare"" will end up in medium rare (pink, warm center) to medium (minimal pink) territory. 

Aside from the steak, i order over-easy eggs and toast. Egg's are usually pretty spot on, in terms of cook, which is a good thing. I love a nice rich runny yolk with my toast. 

Service wise, you'll have two people. One who takes your order, brings your food, and your receipt to take up to pay, then never see again.... Then the other, who does your drink orders and refills. You'll see the drink guy much more often than the actual waiter/waitress. 

Overall, great place to get a midnight meal. 

Note: you aren't limited to 1 order per person. if you ARE definitely hungry, you can order two and share or just eat both your self :P om nom nom !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,2,4,J5NX-9IOTpTO1jKkMsBspQ

Blueberry pie a la mode was delish, as was the New York and the hash browns (something I usually have no problem leaving on the plate).

But the real reason I want to write this review is for the service! It was outstanding.

I went with a large group 10+ people, and we waited in line outside to get seated. We played games so time passed by quickly (although in reality I think we waited around 30 minutes). After getting seated we ordered our drinks. I had a shirley temple. It didn't really taste like a shirley temple (not enough grenadine) but whatever I dealt with it because I knew that soon I would be eating fries!

I split a cheeseburger and fries with one of my friends.  The burger meat tasted a little off. It wasn't gamey but it tasted sort of like paper? I didn't finish my half of the burger because the texture and taste was so off that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The fries were alright, definitely not crispy enough but at least they provided us with ketchup, mayo, and some sort of thousand island dip!

Yeah, yeah call that a ""tina-moment"" but you know you're still thinking about it.

I've heard some say that the steak is alright... Well, if you haven't yet, I suggest ordering it MEDIUM. Not medium rare or medium well. just straight MEDIUM and it should be perfect. Perfect for $3.95.

I'd say the vibe is much better than any other place I've gone for some graveyard specials. It's crazy how people are still up at 3am craving some steaks! It's definitely safer than sleeping pills, I think.

Anyway, take my word. And when you get the steak&eggs.. mix it all up. I usually don't like my food mixing, but breakfast is the only exception, like paramore.

I'll get straight to the point, the waiter/waitress service here is TERRIBLE! My boyfriend and I saw our waitress a grand total of 3 times during our entire dining experience there. When she initially approached us to take our orders, she was giving us attitude and actively rolling her eyes at us while we ordered. I can understand if you're having a bad day, but why take it out on customers (who will give you the opportunity to make some extra cash through tips)? After she dropped off our food, she returned shortly after to hand us the bill and left. Luckily the restaurant's busboy was there to help take care of us. He was actually the one that brought us our drinks and checked up on us periodically if we needed refills or anything else. We ended up giving him a tip instead of our waitress, for obvious reasons.

For $3.95 (or $4.95 for the steak breakfast) they do give you a good amount of food. I was honestly anticipating smaller portions since the price was so cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised. As for the taste factor, the food was fairly average to me. My fries were cold and limp and my cheeseburger was very bland. I didn't have any of my boyfriend's steak breakfast, but he said his was pretty good.

Overall, the food here is average and the service is horrible. I'm sure other waiters and waitress that work here aren't terrible as the one we had, but lucky for us we got the queen of terrible.

First of all I was not able to eat here and take advantage of their 12am- 6am dirt cheap food. I really wanted to too! the line was ridiculously long, it was literally down the hall and around the corner! I stood there for about 15 minutes and we never moved, so I decided that my time was costing me money as well.

The next day (Monday, 08/15/2011) we were heading out and decided to stop by for brunch, it was a shorter line this time but it still took about 10 minutes before we were seated.

Once we sat down we waited about 20 minutes before the waitress finally took our order, then it took 50 minutes before we got our food, I know many people like to eat breakfast at lunch time or dinner, but I think we should be allowed to make that choice not have it forced upon you. I ordered breakfast and didn't get it 'til lunch!

The pancakes had a hint of fish flavor to it, the fries were rubbery, the Chicken wrap was over salted. A friend of mine got a bagel, fruit cup & Coffee had to pay more than the person who got pancakes, eggs, bacon & Mimosa, how does that make any sense? I personally got the two eggs, hash brown, country fried steak with a side of corned beef hash with glass of water and only had to pay $2 more. Someone needs to redo their menu pricing!!!

We were not the only one who had a problem with the slow service because the table around us all had the same problem and people were getting up left and right looking for some explanation on why our waitress disappeared and that no food was coming out. After it finally came out, the waitress explained to us that the hostess sat us wrong and instead of distributing/spreading new customers  across the room, they sat us all down one after the other making it hard to get all our orders in and getting them out at the same time. 

Although I understand her frustration, I've seen many wait staff handle a lot more than this and have done it well. Naturally we (all the tables affected) asked to speak with the manager abut the situation. The manager we spoke to (forgot to look at her name tag) was a skinny young Black woman, mid 20's, early 30's. She seemed way to young and soft spoken to be a manager which explains her stupidity. She just apologized to use and instead of blaming the operation failure, she blamed it on the waitress. Then attempted to walk away. One of us asked if our bill would be reduced because how the ridiculous wait time, it took her by surprise and she said she would. 

When the adjusted check came (we were paying separately) this is what the manager took off of the bill, ONE COFFEE, ONE MIMOSA. are you freaken kidding me?????, if you know that we all had separate bills, we ALL had to wait over an hour, EACH one of us should have something written off!

My advise to you if you come here, ask for someone, anyone to check on your order every 5 minutes, you never know if you are gonna have this situation!",O70j6FC1Bq09T0xkVNsstA,1,0,1,opf7pnsmVzOqSMQQZoZKCQ

This was my third time in Vegas, and there was one Vegas tradition that I had not checked off my list yet - grabbing a late night special from a casino diner. So off I went to the Coronado Cafe!

Not surprisingly, the place was about half full at 3:30 AM. I opted for the ""Pancake Sandwich"" late night special - 2 pancakes with a slice of ham stuck in-between, and a fried egg on top. Egg was cooked perfectly, and I broke the yolk to make a runny mess on the plate, then added syrup. Pancakes were OK, a bit dense. Coffee was, well, late night diner coffee. Go to Seattle's Best near the casino entrance for a good cup during the day ... at the late night, this was acceptable. 

Coronado Cafe is nothing mind-blowing ... it's just basic late night casino/diner food prepared fairly well.

Breakfast & lunch items in the $9-13 range.  Coffee was on the spendy side $3.25.

Wifes corned beef arrives as two dry slices of rye with corned beef.  Thats it.  No dressing, cheese, mayo, etc. Nothing very good about it, especially for $13.99.

The cafe was full of patrons with a line to get seated but we managed to be seated within 10-15 mins, so that wasn't too bad. Once we were seated it was bad news. 15 more minutes to be noticed in the corner where they sat us. We made our food order, Chicken Salad and Lox and Cream Cheese Bagel. Nothing needing to be cooked and 2 glasses of water. It took 45mins to be served! The waitress forgot the bagel and at first was going to argue that it didn't come with one until she read the ticket, abruptly stopped her sentence and walked away bringing a bagel 5mins later. My wife's Chicken Salad was dry and tasted like the chicken had been sitting a while. Then they never refilled our water glasses. I asked the waitress on 2 occasions for a water refill and it never came. Then as we left and I told her we never got our water, she just smiled and said ""Have a nice day.""
I know things can get pretty busy for waitresses and their staff but they do have busers to help them and we only saw ours once.
Needless to say, we won't be going back to that restaurant for while if ever again. Too many other places to go and be taken care of in Vegas to go back to that mess.",jFstakj1H7l3zuVESp0Ygw,1,0,2,oDSW0TtHCXgLySeQzHLotg

I think it was worth it though.

I just may add this to my list of my after-clubbing dining options.  They had a kind of ""cab-drivers-specials"" menu available midnight to 6-ish I think.  Nothing was over $4.  The majority of our 12-person party ordered the $3.95 steak and eggs.

They also had a full menu as well as Chinese food.

Drink orders were taken promptly after we were seated as were our food orders.  We waited a reasonable amount of time considering the size of our party and how busy the Cafe actually was.  Our servers brought some crunchy chow mein noodle things with 4 different dipping sauces for us to munch on while we waited... 

Bottom Line:
Cheap eats after midnight.  Courteous and accomodating staff.  Just make sure you have a DD or cab fare because South Point is a bit of a drive from the Strip.",ahj9FxM6MQBU501LGypcCQ,1,1,4,CyB2eX34BFItS1LkkebWmA

There are signs all over advertising super cheap specials, but those are only available late at night. Pretty much everything is the $10-12 range and there is a $12.99 special for a porterhouse or prime rib. There is also a menu of Chinese food, which seems, um, interesting. I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. The chicken fried steak itself was really tough and the batter was soggy and greasy. I liked the crispy hashbrowns and the generous amount of gravy, though. Service was just okay, pretty much in line with what Raul T. said below.

The highlight of my meal had to be that a table near us had apparently dined and dashed. It was really weird because it was a pretty big group and it looked like a family. Even security guards came to scope out the scene, although I'm not entirely sure what clues they were looking for.

The thing that I remember the most is that nobody said thank you the entire time I was there. I said hello to the host and all he said back was how many. The guy who took our drink order just stood there and said drinks? Our waiter said what would you like to order. So I am definitely not overexaggerating when I say there was no hellos, no pleasantries, nothing. 

It wasn't to just me either. Everyone was equally rude to everybody. Maybe because it was a little before 6 and they were tired. Maybe the smoking gets to you and you become mad at everyone. Whatever the case this place needs a customer service overhaul. 

Now I've got that out of the way, the food is decent. The steak was a nice size. I was very pleased for $4. I got it well done and it wasn't burnt. It had a nice charbroiled flavor. I needed to add salt and pepper, but I was very satisfied. The toast was good as well. They came lightly buttered and you can add jelly. I liked them with or without the jelly. 

The hashbrowns were amazing! They tasted like they were cooked in butter! I have never had hashbrowns out this good. I traded my eggs for hashbrowns with someone at my table and I was in hashbrown heaven!

So in the interests of full-disclosure, I have never ordered anything outside of the late-night $1.95 - $5.95 menu. Maybe the food quality and service is different if you order of the complete menu, maybe its not, I wouldn't know. Suffice to say, about 90% of the people who are here after midnight are here for the steak and eggs and other specials and the servers know it.

This place is all about turn over. When the average diner is spending less than bucks on their meal, the servers try as hard as they can to get you seated, fed, and out the door. With that being said, if you are looking for actual service that you find at most hotel cafes, look somewhere else. Your server will automatically bring you waters for everyone, and your check before you are even done eating. Once the food has arrived at the table, you are highly unlikely to see your waiter again. To be honest, this doesn't surprise or irk me in the slightest. Every time I come here, I know exactly what to expect. Ok food, cheap prices, and no service. But you do get what you pay for.

The food itself is not spectacular, but its good for the price. Its a perfect place for cheap late night eats. Many of the diners are usually drunk from the dollar drinks at the bowling alley or just got back from a club.

We got seated after around 10 minutes. So steak and eggs. Steak is 7oz and probably not going to be cooked the way you want it. I asked for medium rare and got like a medium well. Kind of total opposite of the spectrum but I am not going to complain because I saw this coming for the price. Overall though, even though it wasn't cooked right, the value for what you get is something you can't complain about. You get eggs, steak, hash browns, and toasts. On top of that, the service was pretty good. The server came by several times to ask us if we needed anything. She was kind and I couldn't have asked her to redo the steak.

Other deals also available at night. Would probably not come at other times but maybe the food might be a bit better during non-peak times and not with these value prices.

They always made up for the long waits with the deliciousness! But recently. Coronado cafe has dramatically taken a turn for the worst. Their steak is no longer a decent size nor does it hold the flavor a steak should, the hash browns are smashed potatoes that a baby would think is play food, and the eggs are still soggy with yolk? (I thought scrambled meant no yolk?) BUT the ultimate deal breaker was how disrespectful the cashier was. Since I get the same order every time I was baffled by them charging me 4 dollars for a ""hot tea"" (I OBVIOUSLY had my own vibrant tea package). & when I addressed the issue with the cashier she blamed me for the ""miscommunication"" due to not discussing the issue with the waitress who only delivered my food once, never hearing from her again (Dora was her name).  Correct me if I'm wrong but charging me for an item that I brought is unrealistic. & ever since when was the customer wrong? Customer service was bafflingly pathetic and inexcusable.

As a native of Vegas, I've always wanted to experience late night steak and eggs but never got the opportunity to do so until one fateful night in June. I rallied up the troops, some of which were reluctant to get food at 12 am. But who can beat $4.95 N.Y. Steak with two eggs, hash browns, and toast? Graveyard specials like this are what make Vegas so iconic. 

It's not easy to serve a large and rowdy party of 7 at 12 am but Sherita did it with humor and finesse. Pretty sure we got some looks from other patrons for being overly giggly, energetic, and waaaay too excited over everything. My brother was trying hard to sweet talk Sherita into letting the under 21 members of our party get the steak and egg special but Sherita held strong and had a good laugh at my bro's feeble attempts to convince her. Food quality exceeded my expectations. To be honest, I wasn't expecting a very flavorful steak given the price tag of our meal, but the steak was seasoned well and cooked to my liking. And nothing beats dipping some sourdough toast into sunny side up egg yolk. Add some crispy hash browns and some ketchup+tapatio and I am one happy camper.

Given our experience, this may become an annual tradition for my family. We can't always be together due to distance, but when we are, it's always a hoot. Coronado Cafe made our time together even more special.",yIxsQUbOij3dILfOnm-W3w,2,2,4,SzzxqpPpak_7yncjEDuh4w

All of these meals are fairly priced, good tasting and a life saver restaurant to go to while staying at South Point because it can fulfill everyone's cravings with all the choices. 

They also have a ""Chinese"" section. Looking at the menu even I agree that its very expensive but I have tried some of the Dishes.  
-The wonton soup is $6 for a little cup, it was bland and not worth it. 
-The Shrimp w/Lobster sauce was $20 but the shrimp were HUGE and it was quite tasty.. but I don't think it's still worth the hefty price tag. 
-The Pan Fried Noodles deluxe, however, is my most favorite dish to order off their Chinese Menu. Its under 13 and very delicious.

I have a younger cousin who is allergic to shellfish and when my Aunt was trying to order him chicken fingers, he kindly warned us against it because apparently they cook/fry the seafood and everything deep-fried on the same grill/fryer. He gave them plenty of other alternative options and was very knowledgable. He also double-checked on a lot of the foods to make sure it was safe for my cousin to eat. Later on the manager approached us and I'm guessing he told her about our situation and apologized for the inconvenience and pretty much repeated what our waiter had already mentioned about the grill. 

At first I was kind of upset that they couldn't maybe just get a separate pan or something to cook his chicken fingers in but our waiter was really informative and nice about everything, I was just glad he mentioned this rather than my cousin have a terrible reaction.

It was just ""ok"", I certainly would not make a special trip here again for it.  I ordered the steak medium rare and can't say it was juicy.  Was dry and chewy.  But for the price...

Comparing this place to Ellis Island or any of the Village Pubs, they charge $7.56 for their steak and eggs, and the steak there is considerably better.

So what does Suge Knight, bad service and awesome hot buffalo sauce have in common?  Well they were all at the Coronado Cafe late last night.  As we are seated by the grumpy host who tossed the menus on the table and walked away a man behind us gets up with two chicken heads.  He's tall, stocky etc.  I playfully say to the hubby that guy looks like Suge Knight and he says that is him.  So weird, I wanted to ask him if he had anything to do with Tupac and/or Biggies deaths, too surreal.  Only in Vegas I suppose.
So the service here was awful, I do not believe I have never not left a tip before.  First the waitress, an older Asian lady came and asked us, 'what u want,' then we proceeded to wait and wait for our buffalo wings, we had no drinks, no napkins and when we asked for dressing she came and threw the dish on the table.  I was just shocked because she was do bad, she was obsessing over her big table and could care less of the rest.

It's open 24/7 which is good.  I mean, this is Vegas after all!  

There was a moderate line when I visited on a weekday evening around 6pm.  Waiting time was about 15-20 minutes.  The restaurant is basically just a large, permanently sectioned off area off the lobby rather than a discrete, enclosed restaurant.  This gives it a very open, airy feeling.  But, if you're sitting near the edge you'll basically be right next to people walking through the lobby.

Our server had a very surly demeanor initially (I think she meant this to be part of her charm maybe) though she warmed up a bit as the evening progressed.  They do have a number of very good specials for late night dining (see photo), but we were not there during the wee hours.  

We tried the spicy wings to start which were basic but definitely very spicy.  Not bad.  Then I had the schnitzel.  The meat itself was quite good and was juicy with a light and crispy coating, but it was doused in a very heavy sauce which I wasn't expecting based on the description on the menu.

4052827,2013-12-01,7,ruPFtD9dU6Cv9_wpzIR4UQ,"If I was Yelping 3 years ago, I'd be the Duke by a long shot.  When I first moved to Las Vegas in 2011, South Point was my home for the first couple of months.  So that meant a lot of breakfast, lunch, and dinners at the Coronado Cafe.  Now that doesn't mean that the Coronado Cafe is a ""Must"" stop.  It just means that I was too lazy to leave the casino when the belly was calling.  

So here's my review...

Service:  This really depends on the day, the time, and how busy they are.  I've gotten service as bad as 2 stars and as good as 5 stars.  Ironically, the service is actually better during the weekend nights when they are busy.  Busy here also means a lot more employees working, which means pretty good service. I found longer waits during the quiet morning/afternoons. 

The Food:  There's something for everyone here. The menu is extensive and there's even Chinese Food.  

My Suggestions:  
-Eggs:  No one messes up eggs, Coronado doesn't either
-Clam Chowder:  Pretty good stuff.  Not New England or Morro Bay good, but good enough that you'll be wanting more.
-Porterhouse for $12.99:  Bang for your buck!  This is somewhat dry, so if you're use to a Medium-Well, get a Medium Plus.  
-Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Surprisingly, not too bad.  
-Asparagus:  Not on the menu, but they'll make it if you request it.  Good stuff!
-Salmon:  I've had good and bad salmon here.  But I've had more good than bad.  Nothing really special.  Taste wise it's okay, protein wise it's worth it. 
-Chicken Parmesan:  Just okay, but worth the try if you're in the mood.  

Take my advice, avoid these:
-Grilled Halibut Steak:  Flaky just how I like my fish, but it's too dry and really fishy. 
-Prime Rib:  Taste like cardboard 
-Any of their salads.  I've never had a fresh one here


Overall, I have to say that the food is just average at best.  However, Coronado fits everyone's budget.  The food is inexpensive and if you're in the casino, the restaurant is convenient.

When I asked a server to please zap it in a microwave, she returned with ALL NEW FOOD!  What a pleasant surprise.  I'd recommend the Coronado Cafe to anyone who's looking for a great late-night value.  Unfortunately, the only complaints I would have are that 1) the place is so large it can be quite noisy and 2) their late-night specials menu could include a flat pancake & egg dish.

Lines can be long, but it moves extremely quickly as the cafe is really spacious. Food comes out at a decent speed and the quality is actually better than what you would expect for only 3.95! You get steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, AND toast.

I would recommend going ""one down"" on your steak preference (ie if you like medium, go medium rare) because they crank them out and usually aren't the best at keeping track of all the temperatures. But other than that, it's a solid steak. Hash browns are crisp on the outside and a little soft in the middle. Eggs are cooked nicely and the toast comes buttered for you. Besides the steak/eggs, if you're extra hungry - the biscuits and gravy are a great pick to share. Decent biscuits and the gravy packs a good amount of flavor. 

Overall, really solid place to eat at when you've had some adult beverages and need something cheap and (somewhat) fast to eat. This is one of those rare occasions where the quality is actually better than what you pay for.",nw-xhnHsse5BHZK886laKQ,0,0,4,YtT5FNkIHhmPwLZj8OOKjQ

I have been eating the Chinese food at the coffee shop for years and have never had a problem. I asked my server (who had been extremely rude from the get go) if the spring rolls have any shrimp in them. He asked if I was allergic. I said no, but shrimp makes me queasy. We waited for 15 minutes. Nothing. Next, the female manager of the restaurant approached my husband and I said she could not serve us due to my allergy. I repeated that I do not have an allergy and that I eat here frequently. She said that it did not matter as the chefs do not clean the woks and utensils. Now, I understand not wanting to have an liabilty on your hands, however, she was extremely rude and didn't even offer for us to order something different. I am so upset I didn't get her name (heavy set lady with shorter dirty blonde hair). Instead just repeated that she could not serve us. When I asked to speak to someone above her, she refused.

The hashbrowns tasted like clay and my eggs were very watery and I'm pretty sure they were still somewhat raw (I got them scrambled). The sourdough bread was alright.

I had the daily special which was the Swiss steak.  Three people in our party ordered the special and all of our steaks were tough and not edible.  We all sent it back and switched to the prime rib which was actually pretty good.  This experience tells me to stick to the menu items that are regular items and avoid the specials that are once a week items that limits the restaurant's prep experience.  

Service was fantastic and the dining room is big so waiting times were reasonable.  I think it's funny that they have two menus: a regular traditional café menu and a separate Chinese/Asian menu.  From the outside you wouldn't know that there was a secret Chinese restaurant in this unassuming cafe.  There were several tables ordering from the Chinese menu and the dishes were served in distinct looking stainless steel platters.  From the looks of the food it seemed pretty good. 

Give this place a try. If you don't like your order send it back and they will cheerfully replace it with something else and hopefully better for you.

Starting off with the complimentary dry fried noodles....Haven't had these in years lol. Comes with the standard dipping sauces, and brought back more memories than enjoyment.

As for the GOOD, Salt & Pepper Sea Bass w/ Roasted Garlic ($23.95). EXCELLENT sea bass! Moist insides, light breading on the outside w/ strong garlic and salt & pepper finish!  The consistency of the fish was spot on, and the flavor was even better...highly recommended!

But for the BAD, Whole Imperial Peking Duck ($35.95). VERY disappointing, cooked way too long, with most pieces becoming dry and flavorless. Very LEAN duck as well...not much meat on these bones.  When the plate arrived to the table, I actually told the server that we didn't want the HALF portion...but was told we received the WHOLE duck!  Definitely NOT worth the money here.

I took one bite but the Fries were good the waiter was excellent and his assistant too, they refilled water and follow up with us.  He ran around crazy for his tables.

It honestly makes me question half of the reviews on yelp as this place has the worst service I have EVER had anywhere in my LIFE. At my three day stay at the South Point Hotel (which is actually pretty decent), I unfortunately ate here three times. 

During all three times, I boxed  my food at the end of the meal to be eaten later but not once did I ever receive any utensils to use. Do I really need to ask for plastic to-go utensils when eating pasta, rice, or a steak? I think so.

Food here is AVERAGE at best but service here is honestly HORRIBLE. On the last night when my friends and I came back from EDC on Sunday at 5 AM, it honestly look the waitress 10 minutes just to get water to our table and then another 10 minutes to get our order. I asked MULTIPLE staff members as well as managers to send our waitress to us and yet we still waited. There were numerous amounts of other members on staff that could have taken my order but they wanted me to wait for this one specific waitress to take our order even though there were a ton of people standing around, LITERALLY doing nothing. 

While the steal & eggs deal may sound appealing, the NY steak was honestly a  joke. I couldn't cut it with a chainsaw if I had one. I guess I shouldn't expect much for $5 but c'mon. I basically ate half of the steak and paid for some over-easy eggs with hash browns and toast. This place is a complete joke. My friends agreed that their food was HORRIBLE and that they would never come back.

I ordered the country fried steak and eggs from the breakfast menu. It came with hash browns, biscuit, and toast. The country fried steak was TERRIBLE. It felt like the batter was made of eggs and flour and the meat was tough as well. I ordered the eggs poached, but they were completely overcooked. The worst poached eggs I've had, worse than those cooked in bulk at breakfast buffets. I ended up eating mostly biscuit and toast with jam and butter. The gravy itself was really good. The only highlight of the meal.

My boyfriend ordered the nachos. They were horrible. I don't even know what to say... He also ordered the steak meal and ordered it medium rare, as usual. The meat came back closer to a well done. It was terrible.

Today when I went with my cousins ive never seen the worst customer service EVER. My cousin texted his gf when we arrived at 3:11am and it took them long to give our drinks and take our orders. This is where the problem started occuring. Three different groups sat after us and was waiting as well. The couple next to us who sat after us got their food before we even had ours (1st complaint). Then we get our food and my cousin ordered buttered mushrooms on the side, well my other cousin got his steak and eggs did not order mushrooms but the mushrooms that were supposed to be on the side was the ones on his steak. We called the server to notify them what had happened. They took the food and maybe about 8 minutes brang back the same steak and egg plate with a bowl with a small portion of mushroom and my cousin finds a peice of egg and ham inside. Probably the cook just scraped the mushrooms off the steak and put it in a bowl. They then take it back put it on a new plate what do we find an egg. This is where we called the manager. Ive got to say with me myself being a manager in any business if there is a complaint you do your best to handle the situation. The manager on duty at the time had the nerve to say if we were sitting longer than 20 minutes waiting for our food she would have noticed. We tell her we got there at 3:11AM she says no that is not possible let me get the ticket that shows when you folks arrived. She points out you guys ordered at 3:29Am, sooo basically we sat for over 10 minutes before we were even helped. She then has the nerve to tell my cousin well they cook the mushroom on the same stove as the eggs. Like WTH kind of excuse is that. She said she will not charge us for the mushroom and drink from there it was like okay whatevers. I go to order another steak and egg plate medium. This is where I got pissed off. When I get the order about 15 20 minutes later and I go to cut the steak, it is warm and hard to cut. The steak was nowhere near medium in fact it was just rare. I cut it in half to verify it showing blood and strands. I call the manager over and she does apologize but worst thing ive ever had happened in a restaurant was she asked if it was okay if they put the same exact steak I cut back on the grill. NO that is not how you fix a problem with someones food. She then asks if its okay if they make a new one and already fed up with this dinner I just said take it off my bill and im leaving. Now is when we seemed to care that the chef was messing up because before I had the chance to leave she says I will show this to my chef. Like really guys come on no matter how bad of a day you are having you never treat customers like that. For that I will not return to this place for a long while.

The café itself has what I call ""café service"". This means that the servers might ignore you, they might take forever to bring your food but your busser will be on top of everything making you wonder ""why the hell am I tipping the server for"" . Its pretty universal throuout the cafes , so I learnt to live with it and not get mad. It also includes an ok level on cleanliness . sometimes there is a mountain of plates right next to your other times its pristine

But the lines...ay dios mio!. The waiting line can be horrendous.When I see this line I seriously wonder if Depeche mode is signing authographs inside. By default the southpoint is always packed..and most of its clientel are café people (specially after all the restaurants close) so this can make your eating experience a little miserable. I stay away from it on the weekends because of this. If you are ok with lines, be my
guest; but don't complain as you've been warned

Food..YUM! when I go I get two menus. The regular one and then the Chinese menu..everytime I open that menu little querubins come down and start singing in my ears. Yes its paradise.

I can tell by own experience . EVERYTHING on the Chinese menu is great. Yes everything .Ive tried it all so pick your favorite dish and love it. Specially if you like Ney York style kinda Chinese food.DONT expect the Chinese experience, but more of the east coast Chinese one

Lets don't assume that the other menu is bad. The portions and the choices are great. I am always pleased with the orders and most of the times are cooked right. You can get from breakfast to a full dinner here . Everything is ""café"" quality so don't expect a Joel robuchon meal when you are clearly not there nor paying the price tag .

Now, time to go to their sportsbook and make a quick pit stop at the café.. Lets hope there is no line!",G_bJdUPCnL1x6dvRhyHNyw,3,3,4,Hb-VzWBKvwRv0kHhIqf42A

5837464,2011-09-23,0,ruPFtD9dU6Cv9_wpzIR4UQ,"This is a review of the Coronado Cafe's Chinese menu offerings only. 

We opened with an order of Crispy Spring Roll. Note that while the menu term is singular, this appetizer is actually composed of 4 spring rolls filled with both pork and shrimp. Cabbage and other vegetation was also stuffed into these medium-sized rolls, which were fresh, delicate, and crunchy as advertised. They were a bit springy, too, but not flaky--which is a good thing. Another enjoyable beginning to our meal were the complimentary deep-fried noodles that were brought to the table with Sweet & Sour Sauce, Plum Sauce, Hot Mustard Sauce, and Hot Chili Oil. The Plum Sauce was sweet, the Sweet & Sour Sauce was okay but not very sweet, and just a dab of the Mustard Sauce almost took my breath away. It was more intense than the Chili Oil, which carried plenty of heat in its own right. 

The centerpiece of this dinner was the Wor Won Ton Soup. This was at least the fourth time I have had it, and it surely won't be the last. It featured abundant amounts of very large, succulent shrimp that one could crunch down on and enjoy a juicy flavor burst in response, white chicken meat, very good tasting wontons filled with pork and shrimp, some bok choy, thin lo mein noodles, and pork that was actually tender and very tasty. The chicken-based broth brought all ingredients into nice harmony. I also like that extra broth can be requested, and will be served without charge. This protein-rich soup is a meal in itself for two to four diners to share, but Diane and I somewhat foolishly each ordered another entree to go with it. 

Her Honey Walnut Shrimp in Walnut Sauce actually featured large stir-fried prawns and nicely glazed walnuts in a mayonnaisey, tropical-tasting sauce that was accompanied by grapes and chunks of pineapple, honeydew melon, and cantaloupe. It was quite tasty except one prawn had a fairly large black spot where the crustacean had clearly not been properly deveined. Besides an unwelcome fly that arrived above our table just as we were finishing all we could eat, this was the only sour note of the evening. 

My Beef with Snow Peas looked a bit dark and foreboding when it arrived, compared with most other entrees of this sort that I have eaten.  But covered by a very light Oyster Sauce, it was pretty tasty. The small snow peas were more flavorful than most longer-sized snow peas tend to be. The beef was not overcooked, and onion, carrot, corn, and mushroom included in the dish were not too soft and not too hard. Steamed rice was not particularly remarkable but a little sticky and a good side. I washed everything down with Chinese Black Tea, which I also enjoyed once I realized that it was neither Green Tea nor Jasmine Tea. The biggest shame is that, because we were about to see the Bronx Wanderers in the South Point's showroom following our meal, we couldn't take any leftovers home. I really hated to leave half of the Beef with Snow Peas, and a good deal of the Honey Walnut Shrimp as well, but we reluctantly did so out of necessity. The entree portions served here easily accommodate at least two diners. So, come hungry or else order less than you usually might at a Chinese restaurant. 

Yes, the Cantonese food served at the Coronado Cafe is oriented toward American tastes. But, it is oh so very good. As was the service on this occasion. Overall, this was another scrumptious Cantonese meal at the Coronado Cafe! 

The show afterward was great, too!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,2,0,4,3f8tHlzAaxqcskkCBCBpUg

Counter service available

This humble dining room sets the standard for good service. I was awestruck by the great attitude, work ethic, and skill of these amazing servers. How they manage to be cheerful on top of all that work is beyond me. This restaurant must have a world-class manager to assemble such a great team. They've forgotten more about good service than most culinary employees will ever know.

The high point: They clear the used dishes without making a sound! No passive aggressive busboys slamming dishes into a tub.  The servers bus their own tables and they clearly make diner comfort a top priority. 

I wish I could say the food was better, but it wasn't bad.  Among three critics, there was one thumbs up and two thumbs sideways. 

My Ruben sandwich was pretty good except it was soggy.  I guess they slopped on the sauerkraut without draining it.  When I picked the potato salad I had a hunch it wouldn't be good and I was right. Potato salad seems to be a great challenge for most eateries. (The dab I sampled at Jerry's Famous is an exception.) The pickle was just an ordinary one from the restaurant supply. 

Another critic had spaghetti with meat sauce, which he described a pretty bland. It came with garlic toast that was more like French toast, he said.

Our third critic had beef broccoli from the Chinese menu.  She was very happy with it, saying ""The broccoli was just right.""  I tried a sample but didn't care for it. It wasn't even as good as Panda.  Her vote moved the food rating up to three stars.

Judging by the steady stream of customers (including families with kids), I would say that the food here must be good enough.

It's a spacious, well-lighted restaurant. I guess the new smoking laws make it smoke-free.  Ventilation is good enough that you don't suffer from fumes drifting over from the casino.

I'm not a frequenter of casinos, so I could be wrong, but South Point seemed packed for a Monday evening. Are these neighborhood casinos usually this busy?  

South Point offers some very good people watching. The crowd seemed more diverse and interesting. There was a tasteful selection of sizes, shapes, ages, physiques, ethnicities, and stereotypes.

There is quite a racket from the stun tunes and the slots, but it isn't unbearable like Red Rock.",PYnnzS_3-0oDAT3cmcfs9Q,2,1,4,Vn8KMfpWd88eMENUrkLu3g

2. Prices are low, but for the bad service and food quality, this doesn't really get any props or anything.

3.  Food items are bland, but for paying $3, I guess you get what you paid for.  I rather pay $7 for the same stuff it is prepared correctly with service that actually mattered.
