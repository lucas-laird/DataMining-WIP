Pros: Hands down, the BEST mochiko chicken in Las Vegas.   The girls are always friendly, no matter how many things are off the menu that day.

Cons: Every time I walk in to this establishment, something is ""out.""  Be it the pork for fried rice, or the macaroni salad...there is no excuse for anything to be ""out"" at a ""Hawaiian Food"" establishment. 

Also, their fried rice seasoning blend has 'dashi' in it, which has MSG.  No wonder it's so yummy! It doesn't bother me, but for some it might.  

Items being out is definitely an issue of poor prep.  If you want char siu in your fried rice, go down the street where they are never out of pork.  Also, a  claimed 'Hawaiian Food' establishment should NEVER be out of mac salad.  I'm not even sure if you can call this place a Hawaiian Food establishment.  

I'm not denying this place has good food...when they have everything in stock that is.",l0ib_TpZWaUj0m9S65S1lA,0,0,2,YQrSl7XGb2nYQnP8HgD4DA

It's a pretty small place but I'm sure it's more of a take-out place since the food was served in take-out containers.  It was empty when I went but don't be afraid! The food is good, and I normally don't like this kind of food.  I ordered the garlic bento box and there was a LOT of food for the price.  Enough for a second meal, easy.

My girlfriend and I always passed Rice Trax, and finally gave it a whirl after coming across a coupon.  We weren't too sure what to expect, as other Asian grill-style places in the area have been ""so-so."" But we were pleasantly surprised - we were starving and Rice Trax def delivered!!! First of all the place was super-clean, staff was helpful in explaining the menu options, and the food was AWESOME!  
The fact that you get to design your own rice bowl - with meat, 3 veggies, rice style, and sauce- is fantastic!!!  The skewered grilled chicken and grilled beef are awesome - lean but tender!  Rice is great and veggies look bright and fresh!!!

I decided to pick up a Garlic Bento and a Mochiko Bento ($8.95) so that my bf could choose which one he wanted.  The Garlic Bentro came with 3 pieces of garlic chicken (deep fried chicken in sauce), 2 beef skewers, 1 hot dog, 2 slices of spam, 2 pieces of sweet potato tempura, green salad and furikake rice.  The Mochiko bento came with little pieces of mochiko chicken, 2 skewers of chicken katsu, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura, green salad and furikake rice.  Very yummy.

445427,2012-04-27,1,ubt9YKL8nT-1WMu2QLxuNg,"This is my second experience with this place and it seems like it's just getting better every time I go.

I ordered the Furikake Bento today (1st time was the Mochiko). Service was A+. The cashier was very friendly and even reminded me about my nifty little punch card I had received the first time. Had she not done that, I have such a bad memory, I would have forgotten to take advantage of it. I placed my order ""to go"" and waited patiently for my food. It didn't take too long before I was heading out the door with my bag of goodies.

On to the food... it was delightfully delicious! The Furikake Bento came with fried rice (3 toppings of your choice - I chose red onions, green onions, and peas), furikake shrimp skewers, teriyaki beef skewers, teriyaki chicken and salad. The shrimp was crunchy and slightly seasoned. Every bite was addicting. The teriyaki beef reminded me of my family's marinade recipe, lightly seasoned with a nice kick of pepper and a sweet touch to it. What a wonderful throwback of a memory! The chicken teriyaki didn't seem like it had much flavor but they throw in a cup of some spicy cream based sauce and once you dip it in there, it definitely gives it a nice tangy bite. Again, the fried rice was perfect. I tasted the garlic, onions, and the sweetness of the peas. Mmm, even now I'm reliving on these splendid flavors on my taste buds as I write this review. Excuse me while I clean the drool of my keyboard...

The most wonderful part about going there is that they give you a ton of food. I can eat one bento box for two meals and feel full each time. It's about $12 for a box, but I see myself being a regular there at least once a week, contributing my hard earned money to this fine establishment. On top of that, I still have two more bento boxes to try so you will definitely be reading my reviews on those soon.",53hTHxGUy7AC8Oz7BE7-3g,2,1,5,AZBDDxvmBWhNSjNCrTd95g
449107,2012-02-27,0,ubt9YKL8nT-1WMu2QLxuNg,"Two words: Chicken Katsu! 

Wow after reading all the reviews on this place I finally decided to check it out. If you like local grindz (Hawaiian food), definitely give this place a try. I ordered the mochiko chicken bento with kimchi fried rice, and whew I was struggling to get through it but I didn't want to stop eating. You definitely get what you pay for! 

I enjoyed the bento because you pretty much got to sample all the meats and had a choice of what type of rice you wanted. I will say that the chicken katsu was awesome. It had a crispy batter and moist inside so the chicken was not dry. Screw Raising Cane's, I think I'll go to Rice Trax when I have a craving for chicken fingers! The kimichi fried rice was also enjoyable but not as spicy as I would have liked, thank goodness for Sriracha! The teri beef skewer was tender and easy to eat! Sorry Mochiko but you were overpowered by Katsu!

I would definitely be back to try some other combos. I do like the fact that it is a create your own fried rice. Yes you get charged for additional toppings outside of the 4 meat skewers & 3 veggies, and your own sauce but really who needs that many toppings? Plus for those that are health conscious, they do offer white or brown rice so that's always a plus! The decor isn't anything fancy or amazing so I would suggest take-out.

      Garlic bento -garlic chix, teri beef, spam , hot dog ,sweet potato tempura and mac salad.
       The garlic chix was crispy and flavorful as was the  teri beef sticks. 
        Mochiko bento- mochiko chix , teri beef , chicken katsu, shrimp tempura and mac salad  - This is my favorite the mochiko chix was cut into little pieces so the marinade soaked through.

847608,2011-10-03,1,ubt9YKL8nT-1WMu2QLxuNg,"This place is going to make me fat.  SO GOOD.

Rice Trax seems to specialize in the Hawaiian plate and damn do they have some good ones.  I ordered the katsu curry plate while my boyfriend tried the mochiko.  The katsu curry plate includes a huge glob of white rice, a large helping of katsu chicken pieces, macaroni salad, and salad.  The katsu was crispy and the curry had a nice kick.  The macaroni salad was flavored nicely-- meaning it didn't just taste like mayonnaise.  Brown rice is an option...so...that'll make it healthier, right? Right?

The mochiko bento, however, is my favorite so far. It includes tasty, crispy nuggets of unbreaded chicken along with beef Teriyaki, chicken katsu on a stick, rice and two large pieces of shrimp tempura.  Yes, the mochiko bento should be included in ""This is Why Your Fat.""   So greasy and om nom.

The food is fresh, tasty, plentiful and inexpensive.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, on the menu is delicious and flavorful.  It is not a huge menu and they are better off for that because whatever they make is good.  The seating and decor is clean and nondescript.  The counter service is friendly and efficient.

The beef is really tender and the marinade comes across like Korean bugogi. They also serve a ""Korean"" sauce option that sweet and savory and is my current favorite. The main event here at rice traxx though is the fried rice. You start by selecting from a wide range of veggies then choose your rice (they have brown for us health nuts), next up what sort of protein and how you want it prepared and then finally the sauce. It's fun experimenting with new combos and different flavors. I have gotten the grilled items and they are always tender and a little smoky. The best dish for me was the garlic chicken. These are huge pieces of fried chicken coated in a sweet salty garlic sauce and are best described ad fried chicken boulders. I love em!

The joint is small and nondescript, situated in a little strip mall on Jones.  While the food was very good, the floors and tables were a bit sticky, which distracted me a bit from the yummy food.  

I may not choose to eat in next time, but would definitely consider takeaway, next time I want fried rice.",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,0,0,4,ZIYlVjGOHcqchoApo12kEg

I ordered a couple of Mochiko and Furikake bentos. I know I just ate but it smelt so good on the ride home that I had to sample some. The best part of the Mochiko bento were the big pieces of chicken katsu and shrimp tempera.  The best part Furikake bento were the furikake shrimp and dipping sauce.

I probably would've checked it out a lot sooner had it not been for the fact that it's kind of out of the way from my house, but better late than never! I came here with my parents and ordered the Furikake Bento and the Mochiko Bento. I was first surprised by the inexpensiveness of their bentos (8.95) and the variety of the items included in each. When our order arrived, I was again pleasantly surprised by the amount of food! Their portions are pretty big! 

Being that it was my first time, I didn't stray too far with the substitution options they had. While the substitutions have an additional price, (i.e. kimchi fried rice, macaroni salad) it is good to note that they have options--Especially for the health conscious individuals. 

One downside I did find was that I left the place smelling of food. While I'm sure it is hard to ventilate a small place with an open kitchen that prepares their food the way they do, you might not want to dine in unless you plan for others to smell everything you ate on your clothes.

Rice Trax offers up a DIY bento-box menu where you pick a meat (vegetable, chicken, beef, or shrimp), a cooking style (battered, katsu, grilled, or mixed), pick your veggies for your fried rice (or choose steamed rice if you'd like), and then your sauce for dipping (teriyaki, katsu, garlic, sweet chili, korean). OR you can just choose one of their at-the-ready bentos such as the Garlic Bento, Mochiko Bento, Fuikake Bento, or Katsu Curry Bento. 

I chose the mochiko bento, while my dining partner chose to make one himself. My bento came out with 4different kinds of meat and enough rice to be able to split with another person and still feel satisfied afterward. The cooler thing that I'm jonesing to try next time I visit? Their kimchee fried rice, which you can have instead of the regular rice options for an additional $2.25. You can also sub macaroni salad for $1.50, but I think I might just try that on the side one day since I really love my rice. 

My bento was yummy, and I love that they offer brown rice as an option. My beef teriyaki was delicious, tender, and moist, which is not something that's easy to find in places that sell teriyaki anything. My dining partner got the teriyaki dipping sauce, which tasted homemade. That alone is something I'd come back for, as I haven't been able to find a teriyaki sauce I've found tolerable since I was a little girl in Hawaii. It was awesome: not too sweet or thick, and just the right balance of salty. 

The other thing I have to try next time are yakitori sticks. They're about $1.50 each. For $8.95 for any of the at-the-ready bentos, this place is priced pretty amazingly for some damn good, down home Hawaiian food.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,0,0,4,T5tBMYUqdlaT1-Phseh7aQ

We loaded up the family and went on our mission.  

We walked in and the girl at the counter was friendly.  I didn't know what to order but I actually knew what to order.  (Does that make sense?)  I had to order the Mochiko Bento.  There are about 35 pics of this box on Yelp.  So I ordered the infamous Mochiko with kimchi fried rice.  I absolutely love KIMCHI!  I was very excited to try it.  They ask you what vegetables you want and put it on your plate.  My wife ordered the tempura plate with regular fried rice.  

After we ordered we immediately noticed that they didn't have any high chairs.  This was tough because we have a 1 year old.  We ended having her sit on our laps and we rotated so each of us could eat.  The portions were huge! especially with the Mochiko bento.  

This place was awesome.  I would of given it 5 stars if they had high chairs.  We also waited a long time for the food.

I spotted Rice Trax at the back of the complex; it was behind a gas station as well as Outside Inn. I was a little wary so I did a quick google search and all the great Yelp reviews came up so I decided it was worth a shot.

I walked in and not sure what to order I asked the girl behind the counter for help. I really didn't want anything deep fried, so she suggested I try the fried rice.

The fried rice is build your own. You get 4 skewers of meat, chicken shrimp or beef, as well. After you have picked the meat, you choose 3 vegetables (I chose peas, green onions, and broccoli) and a sauce. She suggested the garlic sauce as their house special.

They make everything to order so I sat to wait. In under 10 minutes my food was ready to go. I took home eat as I watched a movie and was thrilled at my meal.. I have taken a bunch of people there with me since, and others have gone as a result of my tweets and pictures...

So... You pick your sticks, you pick which way your sticks are prepared (grilled, katsu'd or battered), you pick the veggies for your fried rice, they have a choice of brown or white rice! Or a mixture of both... then, you pick what dipping sauces you want. I am EXTREMELY indecisive, so i requested a bit of each (teriyaki, garlic, katsu, korean, sweet chili).

Maybe you've even considered the Paleo Diet so you can use it as your scapegoat for ignoring grains. Wait, what do you mean no? Ah, guess it may just be me. Rice Trax is kind of an deep fried savior that came to remind me the glory of rice and its companions. 

You start off with deciding if you want a plate (for the hungry) or a bento (for the REALLY hungry, or two somewhat hungry couple that likes to split). After you get the choice of upgrading to fried rice (do it) and pick your ingredients from their ""fried rice bar"". Wait what? I didn't tell you which bento/plate to get? Get them all of course! Just kidding my favorite would have to be the Mochiko, wait no the Katsu Curry, wait actually the Garlic Bento. Hmmm! There are no wrong choices!

You can choose ur veggies for the tempura which got me all flustered because I wanted alllllll the veggies tempura'd.....was hoping for one of everything tempura'd but, since they were out of brocolli, I had to go with onion tempura (onion rings/not really/almost). 
Swear, I love their garlic chicken but, I shoulda went with my friends order.
He got the mochiko bento with a side of curry. And in looking at his meal, I think that's the best bet of a meal.

The format of the place is build your own Fried Rice. You choose your vegetables (up to 3), protein, rice and sauce. They also have robata and tempura made to order. 

1st time - ordered the Kim Chi Fried Rice, and 2 Robata sticks. I really liked the Kim Chi Fried Rice and thought the robata was ok. 

2nd time - ordered the Vege Fried Rice. It was a bit too salty for me and they didn't ask me which sauce. I think they defaulted to the teriyaki. 

Overall, I this place is ok and I would come back because of the variety of veges you can put in your order, such as edamame, green beans, broccoli, etc. You can also have the order with brown rice or a half and half mix.

 Rice Trax has become a favorite of ours when we want some serious grub. I love that they have a fried rice bar in which you can pick 3 indredients that your want in your own personal fried rice - you can add more for a small price.

All the meat options are on shish kabob sticks except for the mochico chicken. The chicken and beef are so tender and when dipped in one of their several sauces - Ohh Baby.... THEY USE WHITE MEAT CHICKEN - more healthier and my fav!!!

The Furikake Shrimp dipped in the special sauce is so ono!!!
The salad dressing is good too - to tell you the truth I never ate anything here that I didn't like/enjoy.

Some people don't like when they are dining inside and the food is served in to-go containers but on the flip side I really like it that way, cause when it's time to go your leftovers are packed already and guess what ? No one has to wash any dishes....

Breaking down trax fried rice, you basically choose 3 veggies to be mixed into your fried rice, which you can also choose white or brown rice (how awesome!). Then you get your choice of shrimp, beef, chicken, which can be prepared: grilled, battered, or katsu.
 
Oh man...the options! 

So I decided on shrimp & chicken all grilled. They serve your food in a black to-go container whether you're having it there or to go.  So, it did take a bit of time to get the food, but it was understandable since there were no empty seats in the house when I got there.  Anyhow, the food was great. The fried riced was a great portion & soo yummy. Totally hit the spot. I did like the shrimp & chicken skewer, which you get 4 of, but unfortunately it wasn't enough meat to go along with the rice. That made me kind of sad, but for the price and the left over fried rice I had, I didn't mind so much.  OH! I also forgot that they have yummy dipping sauces you can chose to dip your tasty proteins in too. I got the sweet chili & garlic sauce. Both were good.",zpnDr3EBaVU8QPNHE3eDbg,1,0,4,lGxkNJ0oS7h63y1BDmTqfQ

I've been on a craving for Hawaiian plate lunches, and believe me when I tell you that this place put those cravings to rest.  Although it's kind of in a hidden area, where not much things are going on, the food has really got it going on.  The decor has been the same with most fast food Hawaiian joints, like back home they stuck to keeping it plain and simple.  Hopefully the ambiance does improve but for now I'm not complaining.  With no line to my food, I order with one thing on my mind. GARLIC CHICKEN, say it with me OHHHHHH YEAH!

The Garlic Bento consisted of 2 teri beef sticks, 2 spams, 2 hot dogs, 2 garlic chicken, your choice of fried/kimchi/brown/steamed rice, salad, and tempura sweet potatoes.  I could careless about the salad and the potato, but the amazing part of this dish was the kimchi fried rice and the garlic chicken. Crispy juicy, tender, amazing....say it with me again, OHHHHH YEAHHH! Each bite was a mind blowing experience, I admit I am hooked and addicted.  The menu has more choices of bento boxes already premade and I think there's an option to make your own plate.  I also see other hawaiian delicacies apart of the menu.

came here around 8pm for dinner to go. i absolutely agree with other reviews when they say the ventilation system needs to be replaced/upgraded. just standing there while the food was being made you could sense the smell of the food saturating your clothes. leaving the front door open could possibly help but since it was so effing cold outside that wasn't an option.

took Vince L's recommendation and got the ""make your own"" plate. tried to get the exact same plate but they were out of grilled shrimp. they had shrimp tempura as an alternative. for my veggies i got corn, peas, and green onion.

my favorite of all the skewers has to be the chicken katsu. totally fresh and crispy... the chicken was juicy inside... and it wasn't too greasy. next was the battered chicken. i liked the tempura batter they used on it. it gave it a nice texture. the shrimp and beef teryaki were last. still good.. but it didn't wow me like the chicken skewers.

the rice let me down. if it's sesame oil they use in the rice... they used too much. it made the rice a little mushy. the garlic flavor was super strong and it was just overall.. too overwhelming. the portion is huge but since the flavors were so strong it was hard to finish.

i got the sweet chili sauce which was pretty much mae ploy sauce. lol. next time i will get the garlic sauce. i highly recommend it. 

will i be back? probably. maybe i will just stick to the skewers and just plain white rice or just brown rice.

my fav is the mochiko bento with substituted kimchi fried rice.  LOVE the rice.  its such a great price - i've paid much more for worse tasting food.    the bento is pretty big... it comes with 2 shrimp tempura, two chicken katsu's on a stick, 2 sticks of beef teriyaki, and some salad.  the fried food here is just so damn crispy and the teriyaki sticks are so flavorful.  it reminds me of filipino bbq sticks, just not as fatty.  it also comes with these little crispy pieces of kind of a teriyaki flavored chicken (not sure of the exact name of it).  the food doesn't get soggy at all if your doing take out.  rice trax is NOT healthy - thats why its tastes so good.

they cook your food to order i think.  thats a good thing (the food is fresh!) but also a bad thing if your in a hurry.  food does kind of take long to get, so i would recommend placing your order in advance.  place is nice and clean too.  (one thing - you leave there smelling like food for sure!).  one thing though - its kind of hard to miss so be on the look out on the corner of jones and robindale.

I walked in and looked at the menu and just stared.........I couldn't figure out what I wanted, because really, I wanted one of everything.  Unfortunately I don't have a bovine stomach, so I had to choose just one.  The Mochiko bento box!  The bento boxes come in a partitioned styrofoam box with salad on one of the small sections, sauces in covered cups in the other side, and on the big half of the box, rice seasoned with furikake topped with all the meat.  Get this.  2 skewers of Mochiko battered white meat chicken, 2 skewers of teriyaki beef, and a pile of chicken katsu.  Mochiko chicken?!?!  What are you?  Why have I never seen you before?  Chewy and crispy at the same time, you're like a culinary paradox of deliciousness!  The chicken katsu is small pieces of chicken versus individual tenders battered and fried, and it makes so much sense to do that that way, because you get more crispiness per square inch that way. The teriyaki beef was on the dry side, so not soaked in sauce, and that was a good thing.  Just slightly more well done than I usually like, otherwise still good.  Oh, I almost forgot the salad, it was iceberg covered in a ginger dressing.  I ate the whole thing of salad.  Rice with furikake?  Thumbs upskis!

I couldn't finish my food in one shot.  So I gladly took it home and had it for lunch the next day.  

So come to Rice Trax if you want to make yourself a food baby for not a lot of money!  I did, and I'm planning to come back for either the Garlic bento or the make your own fried rice.

I can't express how BOMB it is... crispy outside, soft juicy inside, and an amazing garlic glaze. The bento also comes with teriyaki beef, spam, a hot dog, and sweet potato tempura.  The mochiko bento had mochiko chicken, chicken katsu, teriyaki beef, and shrimp tempura (yes -- portions are generous so I usually will take home leftovers).

Now, the bentos normally come with white rice, however, please take advantage of the opportunity to sub one of their fried rices (which are also deeelish).  I have tried the pork fried rice and the kim chee fried rice. I loved both it just depends on my mood.

So for all you out there who appreciate a good plate lunch like I do, this place definitely beats out Aloha Kitchen, Island Flavor, etc etc.  Their selection isn't as vast, but for what they do serve, the food definitely beats out all the competition in my opinion.

The garlic chicken bento is just a box of salt, nitrates, grease and deliciousness - we're talking about breaded chicken with garlic sauce, a hot dog, a slice of spam and a teriyaki beef skewer. Brown rice and a nominal portion of salad are just the recipe to give you the illusion of health as you wolf all this down.

Also of note is Rice Trax' build-your-own fried rice bar. It's a brilliant concept whose time has come. You choose your own ingredients and your rice is made to order. It's fresher and more flavorful than any fried rice I've eaten before.

Is this Hawaiian? Is it Japanese? Is it a grotesque orgy of excess and choice that is uniquely Las Vegas?

This place is the best Hawaiian BBQ plate lunch-style restaurant in the Las Vegas Valley.  The food is spectacular and the price is jaw dropping.  I've ordered a few things off of their menu, and haven't been disappointed.  

The first time here was with my girlfriend, I ordered the Garlic Bento and she ordered the Furikake Bento.  We both went with different options on the fried rice, pork fried rice for me and Kim Chee fried rice for her.  

Both dishes came out magnificent.  Everything was hot, the garlic chicken had an excellent crisp.  The beef was tender and very flavorful.  Her shrimp was breaded to perfection, and it came with a well balanced tartar sauce which gave the dish a good contrast in tastes.  The fried rice was no where near soggy, and the spice from the Kim Chee was just right.
I've eaten Kim Chee fried rice at Korean restaurants, and those fried rices have not measured to what you can get at Rice Trax.

Try the Mochiko bento too, the Katsu is awesome and the Mochiko chicken is amazing.

Reminder: Great food takes a little while to prepare, you must allow these wonderful people the proper time frame to make your food.  Wait times on plates are 20-25 minutes, call ahead if you can't wait that long.  Believe me, the wait and the price is WELL worth the product.  You should not criticize if your order takes a while to produce, go to McDonalds if you want something in 30 seconds.",sdXss-rttsL7QNupJcawSQ,0,2,5,HOW-pDmysVkexc7P4uytrg

I ordered the Garlic Bento, which came with:

-Garlic Chicken: crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Great sauce!
-Teriyaki Beef (on skewers): same as the last time. I still think it needs more Teriyaki flavor, then it would be perfect!
-Spam: well, I am from Hawaii, so of course I love Spam!
-Hot Dog: just a regular hot dog, but a nice addition to the bento.
-Sweet Potato Tempura: I don't really like sweet potato, so I gave it to my husband. 
-House Salad: lettuce is thinly sliced and easy to eat. Good dressing!  

This place is a little far from where I live, but definitely worth the drive whenever I happen to be really hungry and in the mood for a good bento. Friendly service, clean restaurant and generous portions that will make your tummy happy! I'm glad I finally found something very good and tasty! 

Next time I will try the Katsu Curry Bento!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,0,0,4,DWhRepmT4oSiPaKJJp3R2g

We ordered a little of everything to try as much as possible. The service was friendly and I was extremely impressed the make your own fried rice option. You pick the ingredients you want, which I love, kim chee or jalapeno are a must!

My mom and fella were huge fans of the garlic chicken. It was quite tasty, but I enjoyed the katsu with curry. I can't wait to try the Mochiko chicken bento that everyone raves about. For the amount of food you get and how fresh and made to order it is, I think it's a pretty good value. My meal was enough for two meals. 

Definitely delicious, I'll be back soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,6,5,H7YXU9g83MmkitXebGGYww
