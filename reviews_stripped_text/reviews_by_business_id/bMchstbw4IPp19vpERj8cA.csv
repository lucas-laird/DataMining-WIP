There were only 3 empty booths that were open for renting and the rest were overflowing with art work, figures, toys from the past, furniture, coins, old vending machines this place has it all. Beware you can realy loose track of time in here. 

Now this type of shoping experince is not for everyone. Honeslty if you are not into antiques or reto items then I do not recomed you stoping in and bringing your kids may be difficult as there are a lot of item sthey are going to want to touch and half of them could break easy.

This is a fairly large establishment, but the amount of real antiques is less than its name lets on. And the antiques I did see were priced accordingly (aka not a steal). There is everything from creepy dolls to overpriced shabby chic furniture to vintage clothes and trinkets. If you are in the mood to treasure hunt or have a love for coca cola collectables or something along those lines, then this is a place you should check out.

I was interested in a mid-century drop leaf table with 6 chairs.  I knew the middle piece/extension was missing.  I didn't care because I would never really need it.   

However, I was concerned the drop leaf wouldn't stay up. I looked underneath and couldn't see how it was done.  The staff member assisting me said ""I know it does because we had it up the other day"".  I said oh okay and that I'd figure out when i got home.

Unfortunately they do not fold up and I'll have to try and find the missing parts.  I'm guessing a low cost drop leaf hinges can be found at the local home depot if I can't find the original pieces online.

My point of the review is to let other buyers beware to make sure something is correct and not rely on staff members telling you the truth.",VX5tBNQFTa9RbR5pR-VeMA,1,1,2,UDBoZy4Lbo7M6BPqKhTteA

I bought a chair the first time. The price tag said $125. It did not say ""firm"" anywhere on it. I brought it up front and asked if I could make an offer for $75. The blonde woman says rather derisively, ""I don't know, that's kind of low."" Lady, YOU'RE not the dealer. She rings up the dealer and when she hangs up, says nastily, ""She'll take it for $75."" I brushed it off as an off day for her, perhaps, and left.

On my second visit a few months later, I was waiting behind an elderly woman buying a ceramic figurine. There was a woman sitting in the back with her head down and does not see me at all for five minutes. Meanwhile, the older brunette cashier helping the elderly customer was being really curt with her just because she was asked a question.

Some have prices that truly reflects the real value of items and others seem to have no clue what they are selling. I am a shopper who likes to be left alone to browse and some dealers hover, reminding us constantly that they will make a great deal. Offer once and walk away. 
Recently though I was most disturbed by something for sell in one of the booths and how it was listed. I cannot know if the seller is ignorant or greedy or just simply unaware. But I hope someone informs Judy's Junk that the American flag they have for sale in a funeral home zipped case is not "" never used "" . It was given to the family of a veteran and as such should not be sold the way it is. They should call the veterans cemetery and ask where they can donate it. It is the right thing to do. If I could afford to buy it, I would do it myself, but that would defeat the point of this review.

1812232,2014-02-03,0,bMchstbw4IPp19vpERj8cA,"The last time I visited this antique mall was maybe 3-4 years ago. It was certainly lacking in terms of staging of the items. I was really put off by some lady trying to sell some trinket for $30 she found at the dollar store (The sticker was on the bottom, I didn't have the heart to tell her). This time was much better but I'm only giving it 3 stars because unfortunately it still just like any other antique malls in Las Vegas.
   
Most antique malls are always filled with overpriced (setting their price to ebay prices) small junk. Theirs is no different. Though the saving grace is I think they are under new management. They seem much friendlier and the staff definitely not too invasive when we are browsing.

For the quality of items it is hit or miss. Some booths had sellers who priced their items to move quickly enough and others are just so ridiculous especially when they are dirty. My husband wasn't too happy with the prices but I still walked out with a decently priced jewelry box. 

Would I visit again? Sure. The drive isn't too far and I know sellers frequently come in to change product.",vrjI_urdez08BO-3a6MuMg,2,0,3,zqVlSPe83bkvMuQhOnGR9A

Even old t shirts were priced as if new.
My husband looked at 2 traffic lights-which he saw 2 years ago. 
Some vendors advertised 20% discounts but upon closer inspection the prices appeared to have been boosted prior to the so called discount.
On top if all this the employees ""patrol"" the place as if to make sure no one takes an item. When I find something I like I am capable of paying hundreds and even thousands.
So the patrolling and high prices were a turn off for me.
I will lose interest in a shop that exhibits the hypervigilance and high prices such  present at this place. I buy at antique shows. I don't even live in Las Vegas. I doubt I am the only person noticing how bad the customer service and prices are here. News flash! This is not the only antique store in Las Vegas!!

On our last day here we decided to go to a vintage store. We found this place on yelp and decided to come. We were so excited, even knowing that they were closing in 25 mins. So we walked through the door and with a very unpleasant voice she was quick to say they were closing soon and extacly how much time we had left. 
It was very rude! 
We already knew the time and were ready to rush through the store just to see if we saw anything to add to our new growing collections of vintage and antique items. 
Workers there were also kinda folling us to see what we were doing. It made us very uncomfortable and rush out faster.
They did have tons of things too look at but their attitude just ruined it for us.

Also they lost business; we were ready to buy something. 
So my point is, bad customer service is not nice. Treat people how you would want to be treated and don't judge a book by its cover.

I can remember needing hours to get through this home of all things vintage, tacky, and just plain interesting; but alas, they have cut the space in half I'm guessing due to the  pesky economy. : /

There's just something about that musty smell of old..not people old, that's an entirely different odor and not nearly as pleasant. I'm not talking about moth balls either, I am speaking of the scent the memories these quirky gadgets, sturdy pieces of furniture, and miscellaneous decor possess. The history behind each piece collected here at the Antique Mall (and any antique shop to be quite honest) intrigues me. 

From vintage glassware, to collectible memorabilia, I quiet fancy the old box and Polaroid camera's myself (shocker, I'm sure). 

Visiting this home of all things antique brings back memories, and that thing that happens as we get older..I think they call it nostalgia?  Memories-shmemories, though, I'll admit to you that I find it a little disturbing that things from my childhood (I'm a product of the 80's) are surfacing in an ANTIQUE store now, haha.

It is smartly located in a well-established shopping area with the premium outlet shopping center and town square nearby which makes it convenient for tourists and locals alike to visit.  This place is rapidly expanding with very few vacant booths at any given time.  Management seems very open to customer suggestions for improvements.  Prices on merchandise can vary greatly but this mall, like most, will help you negotiate with dealers; you need only ask the front.

Out of the hour I spent in here I saw, maybe 10 things worth taking a look at other than to laugh hysterically at how awful the item was. For example - Duck Dynasty bobble heads? The place almost seemed like everyone gathered old and used junk from Spencer's gag gift stores or items they bought for $1 at a yard sale and are marking up at insane rates.

There were some nice items sprinkled in but for the most part, you can just automatically skip most booths. The antique furniture is about the only thing I found interesting. There was literally an empty bottle of Parrot Bay rum for sale for $8.50 if that tells y'all anything.

The entire shopping center is vacant for the most part. They've got signs up all over the place begging vendors to move in and open up restaurants and such, but no one seems to want to... (can you blame them?)

The actual Antique ""Mall"" portion is nothing more than a few stalls with no one in them. A lot of vacant spaces dot the remaining space they're actually using. Looks like the Antique Mall portion used to be a lot bigger, judging from the windows and such, but they're shrunk down to a much smaller space now. 

Oh well. Unfortunate. There's very few actual antiques here, and nothing of real interest. I won't be surprised if this portion closes soon too and there's nothing left in the entire mall.",mySDXsBhY3u0yI-G2oVDkA,5,3,1,sUj2das3jJ9tF2ZU4jGfUw

4810481,2009-11-23,3,bMchstbw4IPp19vpERj8cA,"I was kind of torn between two and three stars. I'd really give this place two and a half, if that was an option. On one hand, I was kind of disappointed. 'Antique' is used very liberally here to describe things that are moderately old. I don't consider VHS tapes or toys from the mid 90's  to be antiques but this place isn't so picky. Therefore, you'll have to wade through lots of things to find anything of value. I'd really prefer if this place was classified as a thrift shop more than an antique shop. 

Anyway, most things were very overpriced. All the items are cosigned and resold by the people working at the Antique Mall, and the owners who priced the items are generally not very accurate. I don't see a Happy Meal toy from 1994 outside the original package selling for $20 or a book of matches from a closed casino, like the Stardust, selling for $10. However, most booths have signs saying the prices are negotiable.

On the positive side, some really interesting things can be found with a bit of digging. Also, the selection is quite large, but you're not dealing with 'antiques' as most people would define them. 

All in all, I think it's worth taking a look at one Saturday morning for an hour or so, but if you miss it, don't beat yourself up too much.",LJPlDsqBS-TvR4LKnhRvLg,4,2,3,XptuStynlJh6Vtaj007wVQ

We brought friends from out of state who had just purchased a vacation condo in Summerlin and as we entered the door one of the ladies started yelling that bags and backpacks need to be locked in their school like lockers and could be picked up on the way out. My wife was not interested in leaving her purse in a locker and our friends wife who had a small backpack purse decided that made her uncomfortable as well so we left. I could understand if it was young kids with big backpacks but come on the average age between the four of us is 47 and her backpack purse was large enough for her wallet and a bottle of water.

There is a mixture of some wonderful & priceless antiques as well as a lot of junk. But you know what they say... Ones mans junk is another mans treasure. 
With that said there is truly something for everyone. I have been scooping up my own treasures here for years. Aprons, picture frames, plates, bowls, chairs and most recently a beautiful punch bowl set and kitchen canisters from the 19030's. 

My one complaint is that they are understaffed, and not that helpful sometimes. 

The other day it took FOREVER to be helped. I made a very large purchase which required over 30 items to be individually wrapped. So I decided to let them take their time, wrap it all up and I would return in a hour. So when I came back I asked for my items (3 big boxes and a solid oak chair.) they placed them on the counter and that was it. 
So I made 4 trips to my car and never said a word. I just wanted to see if ANYONE would offer to help. But NO! Not a single person, and the guy wasn't doing anything behind the counter nor were there any other customers. Now I will admit that for me it was no problem at all to carry it all myself, but It was disappointing that no one offered.
