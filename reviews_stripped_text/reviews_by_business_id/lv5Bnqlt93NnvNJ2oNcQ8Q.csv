I was finally able to go last night and I was so disappointed!   When we sat down at our table it took 10 mins for the waitress to come over for our drink order then another 10 for the girl to come and bring us some chips and salsa.  She brought us a basket of chip crumbs.   Once the waitress came back with our drink order I asked if we could bring us some chips so we could try the salsa.  She brought us more crumbs.  Disappointing!   You need to have chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant!!!  Ok now comes the food, there isn't much to select on the menu so I tried the cheese enchiladas.  You really can't mess that up!   Well they bring me something that looks like a corn tortilla topped with salsa.  It was so gross and the beans on the plate looked like they scraped a baby's diaper!    The only thing I could eat was the rice and that was not cooked all they way!   My friend did not complain too much about the Pollo Delmar, but wouldn't recommend it.  Very pricey for the meal.  Needless to say I was very disappointed and would not recommend this place.  The only reason I gave it a 1 cause you have to in order to write a review!!!   Save your money and cook at home!",Qr34N2JlkYhnZ1jGiGdgfA,0,0,1,xegbJn3HmatMGipQQm3SZw
50440,2017-06-11,0,lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q,"My Yelp app said this place received  3.5 stars, so I was curious...  

How it ever received 3.5 stars is beyond me...  This was my first time there and I will NEVER go back.  They were not horribly busy, so I went in and sat at the bar.  The bartender greeted me quickly and asked if id like a drink and a menu..  I ordered a drink, she brought it, then I ordered something off the lunch menu.  They brought the usual chips and salsa.  Warm Salsa????  I thought it was strange to have the salsa be warm, but I tried it anyway...it was somewhat tasteless, so I switched to the next dip.. this was better than the first but still lacked something.  I was only 5 chips in and scooped what looked like a hair out of the 2nd dip...  I looked around to see if the bartender would look at it but she completely disappeared. I told myself I could be wrong... I wanted to believe I was wrong...  My first mistake was not leaving right then and there.. After 20 minutes the bartender reappeared with my food.  She warned me the plate was hot, but what she should have said was the plate is hot but the food is NOT..

I ordered the lunch taco plate..  The menu read 1 flour tortilla taco, served with pico, etc..  a bowl of tortilla soup, rice & beans. (the beans had cheese on them in the picture)..  I tried to eat the soup, but quickly discovered I had to use my knife to cut the completely oversized, undone vegetables in the bowl. After 3 bites I gave up and slid that aside.  I moved on to the beans, which was cold, tasted sour and had no cheese on them it all. I slid that aside as well...At this point I'm famished, so instead of leaving, I proceeded to try the taco.. . I realized there was no pico or cheese on the little side plate they brought.  I ended up with lettuce and 2 slices of avocado. I look up to find again the bartender/waitress disappeared. I can't even ask for any.. I opened the tortilla to discover dried up steak...  That was it... I pushed that aside and waited for the bartender to get back...  so she comes back and ask if I needed anything else.. I looked down at the plate, then back up to her and said ""just a check""   She looked at my plate turned around and proceeded to bring me the check and asked if I wanted a box..  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  In what world would someone not ask if there was a problem with the food, especially if you seen your customer barely touched the food.  That was my breaking point... I asked for the manager and low and behold he finally appears 10 minutes later...  I communicated what I experienced, explained the food was inedible, told him I was going to pay the check, leave and never return.  He half acted like he was concerned, offered to get the check only once, then proceeded to clear my plate and walked away.. He should have  insisted and tore the check up....  WOW..... the restaurant industry is so competitive, especially here. even more so with the ability to post.  The owner would be saving himself a lot of bad reviews if he took action right away.... If I owned that place, the cook, waitress and manager would be gone today.....     I've had better service and food from Del Taco.... UGH!!!",VLjSSm6v3cR4lp3R3GJsIA,0,0,1,6U2cd460UzjeRfX1unLJ6Q

The service was great, waiters and waitresses were very friendly however the food left much to be desired. Coming from a Latino family I have high expectations for Mexican/Latino establishments and I would rate this place on the same level as Taco Bell. The refried beans definitely came from a can, had the consistency of cement and had no flavor whatsoever, not even any cheese and the rice was severely dry and under-seasoned. The dishes that were supposed to have cheese in them either had no cheese or were smothered velveeta, GROSS. All food the food was bland and to be quite honest, all 7 in attendance for dinner there last night feel sick afterwards.

396819,2017-03-15,0,lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q,"First, this is NOT a Mexican restaurant. Second, it is not Tex-Mex. It is their own version of what that means. Having had friends from Mexico (Chihuahua) who owned a Mexican restaurant, this food is not consistent with my normal experience with Mexican food in the USA or Mexico.

For example the red sauce has ground BEEF in it. If I order a Chicken product, I really do NOT want beef on it. They call this red sauce their 'gravy.' I asked for just a plain red sauce instead, expecting a red taco sauce, and what they put on the food was not a red chili sauce, it was more orange and not spicy or flavorful in anyway.

The chicken was not breast meat. It was the cheaper thigh and leg dark meat. They have Filet Minion on the menu, but they give you cheap chicken parts for the chicken meals.

You could order the shredded chicken. A fellow dinner did order that and it was just a plain shredded chicken breast. No spicing, no flavoring.

They do not have normal salsa. They give you a HEATED spicy/flavorful/red dipping sauce. As well they have a guacamole/green/creamy dipping sauce as well. It was tasty but not anything I had seen before.

If you object to garlic, beware. It is in EVERYTHING. I consider garlic a cheap flavor enhancer. Restaurants that rely on it for the flavor rate LOW in my opinion. With all the REAL spices and flavors, don't cheap out with garlic.

I was excited to see a new restaurant open in this location, but sadly, it is not my style. I wish I had known this before having my Birthday dinner there. It kind of ruined it for me.",RoJeErivU6c4tr_vba_cHw,0,0,2,7v_HayYZizR9zmj9b3XZHQ
465103,2017-10-23,0,lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant and when I received a coupon in the mail for buy one entree get a 2nd entree for 50% off I was excited. When I showed them the coupon they said it was for brunch only. This makes zero sense because it says in fine print on the coupon it's for an entree of equal or lesser value and the brunch is a set price. The coupon says NO WHERE that it is for brunch only. They mention their brunch in the ad, but it is no where on the coupon. If they intended it to be for brunch only then they need to fire their designer or marketing person. They put out a coupon to get people in and then don't accept it?! Not a good business practice.

The menu was full of colorful Mexican food with some unique flavors that I hadn't seen before, but it was poorly organized and slightly overwhelming. Plus the food was priced too high for my liking.

The food was decent but the service was awful. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant and it took us like 20 minutes to get the check after we finished and no one cleared our plates.

I was ok with this, but then I received my shrimp cocktail that was mixed with octopus and there was no octopus. Finally the manager came over and gave us the whole excuse about another large party taking up their time and he apologized. I told him about my missing octopus and he said we don't have octopus its shrimp and fish. I said no look at your menu. It said octopus and he said sorry this is an old menu from Texas.

For those of you that review restaurants, spend some time in a kitchen or work the floor to give your review any sort of merit. 

We've all had out bad nights, speak with the manager first before you bash them on social media or yelp. Give them the opportunity to fix it, then again we live in a passive aggressive society. If you don't have the guts to speak to a manager, send them an email.

This time we ordered the stuffed avocado with shrimp as our appetizer, which was perfectly crisped. And the avocado on the inside wasn't warm (I dislike warm avocados). Once again we ordered the shrimp poblano and fajitas a la poblano as our enteee. Both so delicious! We both agreed that the shrimp poblano was better than the previous times. 

The service was great! Our server, Antonio, made sure our waters were always full to the brim and never empty. Very attentive and helpful! The manager came out twice, making sure we were taken care of and making sure everything was good! Very much appreciated!!

We try to go to different restaurants around town, but we do have our favorites that we frequent more than once. This place is one of them. Tonight was our 4th visit and we are still impressed. Each time we've come we have had amazing food, fresh ingredients, large portions, friendly service, attentive staff and fast delivery. The restaurant itself is always clean, fun decor, great music and a comfortable atmosphere. 

Tonight we had a genuinely happy waitress named Elizabeth who was pleasant and cheerful, just a pleasure. We assumed the man that came after her to make sure we were enjoying our meal was the manager, which we always love seeing management interacting with customers. He recognized my dish, Pollo Del Mar (outstanding by the way, I highly recommend) and said it was one of their signature dishes. He seemed proud of the product and I could see why.

The 3 stars is a little generous. The food was not bad. Like most of the other reviews on here the guacamole given with the chips and salsa is not guacamole. The food was ready in a good amount of time. Everything arrived as we ordered it. 

My biggest complaint would be the customer service. My server took our order and did not return until we were ready to leave. In the meantime, our drinks were empty and the flour tortilla that was brought to my table was still covered in flour. It was not fully cooked. When he came over to give us the bill I asked him if the tortillas are suppose to be that way. He told me ""no"" and just took the tortillas away. 

We will give them another try. It won't be any time soon. I think it might be too early to judge them. I hope they get things fixed.",XGVO_FSOOr0O7BS3pOh4Jg,0,0,3,kC70GMOAlRXzneXGRl5Y2w

The chicken was bland but the breading was good. I also ordered a side of flour tortillas because I love homemade flour tortillas.  Those were not fully cooked. My husband ordered the ranchero style burrito with red sauce on top. The sauce looked delicious so it took a piece of my half cooked tortilla and dipped it into the sauce. Boy I thought I was in for a real treat that was my reaction.  The sauce tasted like ragu meat sauce oh I was dumbfounded. Really spaghetti sauce??? I thought maybe it was just the sauce on my husband's burrito so I tried the sauce from my daughter's enchilada  same  sauce.   We asked about the sauce and we were told that it was Texas style hmmmm.  I am Mexican and from California not from Texas therefore I obviously prefer a different style of Mexican food.  Our waitress was great though and the service was good.  The manager did come and ask how we liked our food and my husband told him the sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce?

Things we don't personally like:
Chips don't seem homemade. They were not hot. 
However the salsas we do enjoy. 
We ordered the fajitas which the chicken and shrimp were tasty... but little disappointed with the number of tortillas... only 2 per person for the fajitas for 2. Sour cream should be a normal side for fajitas and when I ordered the sour cream... I was not informed that it was almost a $2 upcharge until I got the bill.

To start, I eat out alot (obviously) and I had the best customer service from all staff members ... Literally the best customer service I've ever had at a restaurant. Our server was Jose. he was super energetic and enthusiastic. The manager (I think) stopped by our table also to ask how everything was.
Chips and salsa came out fresh and warm. Wasn't a fan of the red salsa only because there was no heat, and I'm a fan of anything spicy. The green salsa was cool and refreshing.
My boufriend and I both got chimichangas and OMG they were the best I've ever had. We got chicken and beef and both were amazing. The chicken was perfectly cooked, packed full of flavor and so juicy !! The same with the beef. I preferred the beef one more and made my boyfriend switch me. It was so delicious I could not stop saying ""omg this is so good"".. the portions were also really big. I'm not a fan of rice and beans so my server substituted those for tortilla soup, free of charge! Soup was full of flavor but didn't have any meat in it. I wasn't bothered by it because I was more focused on my chimichangas.
For dessert we got the trio. I would only recommend this for parties of 4+ as the portion was way bigger than the picture. Two giant scoops of ice cream covered in toasted coconut . Brownies and mini churros. The churros were piping hot and super fresh. Truly the best churros I've had in Vegas! We had such a hard time finishing this dessert. The plating was also really nice and clean.

The ambiance was strange, I felt like it was trying to be an authentic Mexican restaurant, but couldn't quite get there. It was ""cold"" and lacked that home-like feeling one typically would encounter.  The wait staff was nice, though our service felt rushed.  

I ordered the La Bonita Plate (3 pcs) chicken fajita quesadillas, (1 pc) beef fajita taco covered with chile con queso and (1 pc) chile con queso puff tostada.  Honestly, it was lacking and for $16.99 I expected more.  The Chicken Quesadllas were mostly cheese, The beef  fajita taco, was not a taco at all.  It was a rolled torilla with meat in it; That's it meat and tortilla, with some cheese wizz queso (I should have taken a picture).  

What surprised me was the chile con queso puff tostada.  This wasnt even a tostada; It was simply a torilla that was blown up like a balloon (hallow and empty inside).  There was nothing inside and some of the wizz on top.  Taco Bell has out performed this meal.  

I will tell you that two of my co-workers ordered the Super Salad and raved about them.  From the looks of it - they were well portioned.  Neither of them could finish their dish.

What really prompted me to write this?  Well besides the mediocre food, it was our first time here.  I certainly did not expect anything from telling our waiter this, but I would have thought that he would have had some good recommendations.  His suggestions seemed random and disingenuous.

It was more like a vegetable soup with tortilla thrown in. :( The fried avocado was decent. The crust was fried to  golden crispiness and the avocado was decent. It did not taste that ripe to me.

Service was actually quite good. I didn't catch my server's name but that guy never stopped moving once. He went from table to table to table to table to table... He was like Energizer Bunny....Lol 5/5

I have to admit, I walked in with pretty low expectations but they proved me wrong. Walked in on a Friday night famished! As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. A few moments later our waitress came over to drop off chips and salsa, both green/red and took our drink requests. Soon after that another employee approached us and asked if we wanted to order guacamole, we of course said yes, she walked away only to return with a cart..she proceeded to make the guacamole right in front of us, after she was done, she asked us to taste it to make sure we approved of it, definitely a major plus. 

Looking through the menu, everything looked pretty tasty but what caught my attention was the stuffed avocados. I was curious and intrigued so I went right ahead and ordered one. Food came out pretty quick and right away my mouth started salivating, my plate came with tortilla soup, beans, rice, a fajita taco and my stuffed avocado, big portions so come hungry. The stuffed avocado was breaded on the outside, despite it being cooked, the avocado was firm and fresh and it was filled with cheddar cheese and steak, happy bells went off in my head as soon as I took that first bite. The only downside to my dish was the fajita taco, they put a layer of cheese on top of it and melted it but it tasted like a kraft slice, other than that my meal was perfect. On another note, I noticed that their rice tasted just like Pollo Loco's, not their current rice but the way they used to make it years ago before they changed their recipe. That made me an even bigger fan! I washed everything down with a peach margarita, it was pretty good and you have the option of choosing salt or sugar for the rim. 

Overall, I really liked this restaurant and I'll definitely be stopping by again, service was quick, staff was super friendly and very attentive, our waitress was on top of it. Prices are similar to Lindo's, maybe just a few cents cheaper but totally worth it. You won't be disappointed.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,31,31,5,a0JcnOsY0WUq3xmhh-JuSg

Refried beans also appeared to be canned as they turned white as they sat on the plate. Stuffed avocado was crunchy and hard with chewy cheese inside. Tortilla soup was basic vegetable soup with tortilla strips & covered with a thick layer of onion soup cheese. Bland seems to be the going word here. Even the asked for Tapatio bottled sauce was bland. No spices. No jalapenos. Nothing TexMex about this place.

I have eaten there 4 times since they have opened, each time with a different person and every time they tell me how right I was.  On each occasion I've ordered different things and each time they come out fresh, hot and perfectly seasoned. The warm chips and red and green salsas are so delicious and truly addicting. The queso with beef fajita meat makes you want to lick the bowl. They have great lunch specials with huge portions and the stuffed avocado is sublime. They have a great chicken dish that is covered in a mushroom wine sauce that will make you dream about the next time you can get there to have it again. Everyone I bring here can't get over how awesome the fajita meat is. It's so tender and seasoned to perfection.

I've watched for months as they converted the place into a mexican restaurant and eagerly waited for them to open.
The food is really good.
The salsas they bring out with the chips are not traditional. The red salsa was heated in the oven and the greenish salsa was like an aioli mayo based concoction. I didn't mind either but my friend was not a fan. 
Margaritas were cheap and very good.
We ordered a large variety platter for 2 people to share and it was so good. We received steak and chicken fajitas, grilled shrimp, a green onion and bacon sauce, rice, beans and more. 
The perfectly seasoned steak was so tender it just fell apart in my mouth. After that I didn't expect much from the chicken but it was also perfectly seasoned and so soft.
I would definitely give the food 5 stars and the staff could not have been any more friendly and on top of things. The only dissapoitment is regarding the interior design.

When I saw they were opening this place, I wondered if it was the same Los Cucos as the ones in Houston.  When I walked in and asked them, I was elated to find out that it was the same!   And that they have the same menu.  They have an On The Border here, which is a Tex-Mex place, however, the menu is very different than the ones in Texas.  The Los Cucos menu was not.  It was the same!!!   I was very, very pleased to see that the cheese enchiladas were served with chili con carne or chili gravy instead of the disgusting red or green chile that most of these west coast places put on their enchiladas.  And they were good.  And the refried beans were perfect.  Some places make them too runny.  These were very good.  The service was excellent.  I had multiple managers come to the table and speak with me, and that was great.  My two complaints were that I was not a fan of the rice.  Although, I remember I didn't care for it when I went to the locations in Texas either.  For some reason, there was corn and carrots in it.  Just give me plain Spanish Rice.  Also, I used to like the red sauce they served with the chips in Texas.  However, I was not a fan of either of the sauces they served with the chips, and they were a little stale.  Also, the menu said they have Shiner Bock beer, and they do not.  At least not yet.  I hope they will eventually.

Great customer service

3581381,2018-05-05,0,lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q,"I tried this place yesterday after I got off work.
I had been wanting to come for the longest time since I moved out here last year.  What kept me away was the poor experiences I had at other Mexican restaurants. I tried Lindo Michoacan since I heard amazing things but it was a huge disappointment. 

Mexican food is near and dear to my heart. Being a girl who grew up in Santa Ana, CA . I'm used to having amazing Mexican food being very accessible to me. So when my co-workers told me we were meeting here I was intrigued and I knew I would be able to try many things. 

So the place is really nice on the inside, had the Mexican ambiance I love. We were seated and first things first, we were given the chips and salsa. Something so basic can be a deal breaker if done wrong . I am happy to say that the chips were yummy and the salsas were delicious. We enjoyed the creamy green salsa best. The red salsa was very good too. 

We ordered drinks, we all ordered different ones. Here is where I was not impressed, the drinks had that thickness, I can't explain it. The drinks were very syrupy that I couldn't drink it and my peeps had the same issue but were able to down their drink but they were not loving the drinks. I like my alcoholic drinks (especially the pretty drinks) to have more of a freshness and light consistency rather than the thick syrupy kind. I hope this restaurant can work on this. This alcoholic drink issue is what in my opinion is keeping this restaurant from being an amazing restaurant. 

I ordered the taquitos( I know I went super basic) but I miss my mom and she always makes these for me , plus I'm a shitty at frying food). My friend, Justine, ordered the tortilla soup with a beef taco/burrito I can't remember. Blanca had the stuffed avocado dish. Our food arrived at a perfect time and the plates were beautiful. Much larger than what you see in the pictures. I loved my food, we all did. It was such a comfort to be honest. Something as simple as their sopa de frijoles was wonderful, such great flavor. My taquitos were good and the fact that they didn't mess them up was a sign that I can come back. Some other Mexican restaurant here in Las Vegas disappoint me because they ruin the basics. I'm happy to say they won me over with the food. The tortilla soup my friend had was tasty and has a wonderful broth, the asada meat they use is tender and has great flavor. The flour tortilla tasted like it was made in house. I'll investigate this. The stuffed avocado dish was really good. Did not think it would have been as good as it was, very different. My advice to them, the food can be a bit hotter and the beans are a bit dry. As my mother would say (ponle más agua a los frijoles) add more water or broth to the beans.

We decided to have the full experience. We ordered dessert. This did not disappoint. It had beautiful tasty warm churros, ice cream topped with coconut and a chocolate cake. We enjoyed this dessert so much and once again much bigger than expected. 

The food was very flavorful and comforting to me. They have a great location in a great shopping center near . This place has some of the best/better Mexican food in the city. I still think they can be better. I know they are catering to a different crowd but when Mexican food is executed beautifully I feel that many people will have an opened mind and will try things out of the norm. My gringo husband has come a long way and eats Mexican food with intense flavors and depth. Los Cucos you guys were great, I really enjoyed my experience here. 

Can you guys please add like a torta ahogada or huaraches to the menus. Please!

3972390,2018-05-01,6,lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q,"I wanted somewhere to stop for dinner on the way home from UNLV and I chose Los Cucos from a search on Yelp.  The restaurant was busy, but I was seated promptly.  A server came and asked about drinks and I ordered my standard iced tea. 

I was intrigued by their deep fried stuffed avocado and I decided to try that.  It's a large platter of food.  While waiting for dinner, I enjoyed the chips and salsas.  The tomato based salsa is warm when served and has a small tang to it.  The other is totally different.  It's sour cream, avocado, cilantro, jalapeño, and garlic.  It's quite different and it was good.  

After a longer wait than I expected, my meal was brought.  The food was mostly lukewarm.  Since the tortilla soup--also lukewarm-- is served as part of the dinner platter, the food has more chance to lose temperature as you eat the soup.  I'd much rather have the soup served hot as a separate starter than have it lumped on a plate with my main meal.

The stuffed avocado was very good.  The chicken inside had a good flavor and the breading on the avocado was fairly light and crunchy.  The rest of the dish was below average.  The refried beans were very dry, and the fajita taco was covered with chile con queso that tasted like it was melted Cheez Whiz.  

Service was lacking.  I asked my server for some sweetener.  He evidently forgot.  After trying to get his attention for about 5 minutes, I asked one of the bus people and I got the sweetener.  Another bus person refilled my iced tea the first time.  My server just walked by.  Later, he put a number of small napkins on the table.  I really have no reason for doing so as they have cloth napkins.  I'd rather have drink refills and sweetener than a number of cocktail sized napkins.

The best part of the meal was dessert.  The tres leches cake was excellent!  It's disheartening when you leave a restaurant thinking of just one course and dismissing the rest.

I ordered their Los Cucos fajitas again. It's loaded with well flavored meat, sautéed mushrooms & onions and other veggies. Topped with jalapeños for some added spice and served with their homemade tortillas 
Chips, salsa and the guac salsa are great too. We also really like the chili con queso as an appetizer. 
They offer table side guacamole.

4074375,2017-01-04,6,lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q,"I'm really excited that a new sit down Mexican restaurant has opened on my side of town. This is a small chain from Texas and the food is good, if atypical, Southwestern style Mexican food. Los Cucos can't compete with Vegas local powerhouse Lindo Michoacan, but it still has pretty good eats and great service. 

The interior is strange, a rag-tag looking atmosphere in what is (obviously) a space formerly inhabited by MiMi's Cafe. The Mardi Gras balcony is still there, but now there's some sparse, randomly placed Mexican decor lining the walls. The restaurant feels spacious, open and clean, and there's a particularly nice open bar area right inside the front door. The place lacks character, but it's a pleasant enough atmosphere. 

I had to laugh at the menu because it's loaded with misspellings (""crispi"" tacos, ""romain"" lettuce) and some of the descriptions are exactly the same for different items (check out the special fajitas on the menu). When I pointed this out to our server, she couldn't explain it nor tell me which item it was that was the correct description. I eventually got what I wanted, but the menu had the dish listed under two different names. You'd think for a chain restaurant, the menu would be consistent (and free of spelling errors). 

As with most Mexican eateries, the house serves complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were good enough but served cold; the salsas are DELICIOUS. Like seriously delicious. There's a spicy, smoky red salsa that's served warm and a fantastic avocado crema style cold salsa. Both of these were the highlight of my meal and I am still craving them (they'll make me return to the restaurant often). 

We ordered the queso with shrimp as an appetizer. At $11.95, it's overpriced. The cheese wasn't that warm when it was served and the queso was loaded with red onions, mushrooms and other unnecessary stuff. The shrimp was seasoned well and quite delicious; however, I wouldn't order this again. 

For lunch I ordered chicken fajitas and my husband ordered steak fajitas. The meat quality was top-notch. I LOVED the marinade on both of the meats, and we both agreed the meat was some of the best in town. The fajita vegetables were just okay -- onions and poblano peppers. I was disappointed in the overall fajitas, but I'd love to have just the meat served on its own. I had fajitas that came ""loaded"" with bacon and cheese, and it was an unusual and very tasty combo. The side plate was huge and had so/so beans, average rice, and very tasty guacamole and pico de gallo. 

Fatty alert: they serve homemade flour tortillas, and they are delicious! I love Mexican restaurants that care enough to make legit tortillas, and I'm happy that Los Cucos does it right. I could've eaten two dozen of them! It's a bummer that they aren't served in tortilla warmers to keep them soft but instead are plopped on the table sandwiched between paper towels. This means the tortillas get hard very quickly. Best to gobble them up as soon as possible!

After our lunch, Jesus the manager came over to ask how we enjoyed everything. He was very eager to please and happy to listen to our suggestions. I was very impressed with this personal touch and the efficient, friendly service we received. 

This isn't the best Mexican food in Vegas, but the kitchen uses very high quality ingredients, the prices on most menu items are fair, and the service is good. This is a great place to add to the dining rotation, especially if you live near Mountain's Edge and the Arroyo.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,17,11,4,orO7zJC_HFBAAKI2UuHbLw

I had some chicken enchiladas. They were really delicious, and the plating looked amazing. Usually Mexican restaurants bring out food thrown on some colored plates, but these had some love and time put in to presentation.

They also give you warm chips with 2 sauces for free. One sauce is a warm smokey red sauce, and a cold green avocado type sauce. So yummy!

Ordered the ranchero burrito and when it came out the portion was huge. At first bite, I couldn't place the sauce until a few bites later that I realize the red sauce had small portion of ground beef in it. It tasted like meat spaghetti sauce was poured on top. Fushion?

4423721,2017-09-24,0,lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q,"I have very mixed feelings about this place after visiting the first time last night.

Pros
The food was fantastic! We ordered chili con Queso to start. It tasted like a good mix of nacho cheese with pice de gallo on it. As well very well at the complementary salsa. I also ordered the shrimp jalapeños. They were surprisingly better than we planned! The had great flavor and just enough heat. Highlight of the meal definitely has to be the fajitas though. We ordered the beef fajitas for one and split them, it was plenty of meat only thing we needed was extra tortillas. The carne asada was super flavorful and the veggies were grilled perfectly. 

Cons
We ordered the small chili con queso but got charged for a large one.

We ordered 2 shots of Correlejo rep at 9.95/per shot. The shots were no more than .75 ounces (pretty sure they were only .5 oz) when I mentioned something to our server about how much it would cost to get a bigger shot he told us those were 2 ounce shots. Me being a bartender for many many years knows the difference. He then brought us 2 more shots on the house. But I feel totally scammed. Had I not said anything they were charging me $20 for less than 2oz of tequila.

I then got the spicy pineapple margarita, which tasted as if it had no pineapple in it, so I asked for a small side of pineapple juice so sweeten it up a little. Get the bill and he charged us $1.50 for it. 

When I go out I plan on spending money, and understand that you have to charge for things, but between getting charged for the wrong appetizer, getting shorted on the shots and getting charged for a small side of pineapple juice I don't know how to feel about this place, which sucks because the food is amazing!",E9dANxt6bi26vR83j5EgUA,1,0,3,zoDmKwN1o_ppQ8dGJC_U3Q

My wife and I had a sampler plate which contained fairly typical Tex-Mex offerings. Overall, we were quite disappointed. It has little resemblance to the restaurants in the same chain in Texas. The enchilada was without any flavor whatsoever. The refried beans had an unusual texture and taste and were somewhat overdone. The rice was anything but Tex-Mex. The beef fajita meat was actually pretty good. The tortillas were fair. The price though was considerably higher than the same restaurant plates in Texas. While we were hoping for a true Tex-Mex restaurant in Las Vegas, this one missed the mark. The lack of flavor and seasoning were disappointing-- akin to a Mexican TV dinner.

We'd visit more often, but don't live close.  We had concluded our business at neighboring Men's Wearhouse, so decided to have an early lunch at Los Cucos.

We arrived at 10:43; the restaurant doesn't open until 11:00 AM.  The hostess was very nice and told me that we could come inside.  When I returned a minute or two later with my husband, the manager greeted us and told us he'd be glad to seat us in the restaurant.  He saw us to a table and chatted with us about the restaurant's history.  He brought us two very welcomed cervezas.  Before we knew it, we had chips, salsa and an avocado dip.

Lupita provided excellent service.  People checked on us throughout the meal, including the chef, the waitress and the manager.

We each had a chicken taco which was stuffed with chicken, as well as sauteed onions.  We split a spinach quesadilla.  That was too much food for seniors; we've gotta learn to start sharing meals.

We were never without water.  Our check came quickly.  We really appreciate the level of customer service which allowed us to be seated before the restaurant opened.

The complimentary chips and salsa is a plus but the thing that I enjoyed the most was actually the desserts! We ordered a tres leches cake and a cheesecake. To our surprise they also brought out another dessert, complimentary for his bday, called a sopapillas? Haven't had it before but it's pretty much another version of a churro except in a triangular donut form. It was soooooo good. Probably the best tres leches cake I've ever had.

They have a good happy hour menu which I would like to try. It was PACKED on the weekend when I went. Lunch on the other hand is not as busy. They do take out ordering and everything was packed in a nice bag. 

They have a mariachi band on the weekends in which was WAY too loud when you walk in. I could not even wait in the front lobby area cause I was getting my ear drums blown out. It was nice to listen to from far away from the front area is way to small to have a full blown band in the front. My kid started crying. TOO LOUD!  A few kinks, we sat at a table last time we were there and had ordered table side gauc. The lady could not come to our table because the cart would not fit. So, she was practically across the restaurant making our food, while kids from other tables were looking over it. Yea no thanks! She also served 3 other people at what looked like one of the band members tables before getting to us so our food was already out before getting our guacamole. 

We also had come with a toddler and they did not offer a highchair or booster. It was very odd. I asked for one which they eventually brought. We gave in and ended up ordering a few margaritas cause that is what you do when you eat Mexican food. They ended up being $14 a piece. Pretty pricey for what it was. We spent a LOT of money just on drinks and the meat and fish platter (which was really good). It was too much money for us and will likely be going somewhere else on the weekend. Considering its proximity to where I at a lot it is nice to have the option for Mexican. I will probably stick to happy hour or to go options.",NsHeN5dKRmYfJTmTxMITmQ,6,2,4,J2Wk9cK0svZ4sNLUXHjznw

Armando is our server.  Great guy who came here for the opening with his wife a year ago.  We started off with the Ceviche Cozumel - it's a bit spicy but filling. Armando recommended the Carne Margarita and the Seafood Al Vapor.  When the seafood came out, Armando cut the aluminum wrapping revealing a boiling cornucopia of seafood beneath.  

The Carne Margarita was insanely delicious.  Resting on a bed of arroz was a tender fajita buried under a mound of mushrooms and herbs.  Somewhere in that bed of tasty was some Monterey Jack to really tie it together.

Ambiance was clean with Mexican music playing in the background that was neither overpowering conversation or loud.

Chorizo queso dip 

Fresh tortillas they were definitely home made so buttery and I would come back just to have this

Fajitas were good too. The only thing we didn't enjoy about this was the menu said it was filet mignon and it definitely wasn't filet mignon you can't fool me on that it was thick flank. 

The portions are also huge so you can definitely share 1 plate for two or just don't order an extra appetizer like we did and enjoy the fresh chips n salsa that's free when you eat here.

First we walk in and I see the hostess and smile and my wife says 4 and she replies oh let me check we're very busy. I think she forgot how to say hello first since they were super busy as she put it, but they were not very busy, restaurant was half empty. 

We get to our booth and about 5-6 minutes pass and finally the server comes by and ask has anyone been by, we replied no and she's like ok, are we ready to order? We say no we're not and how about some micheladas and a few sodas for the kids. She returns a few minutes later with the 2 coronas and what looks like lime juice, so I ask kindly, may we have a little bit of Clamato and a shot of olive juice. She says sorry we don't make it like other places, we replied it's ok. She then returns with the Clamato, and says what else did you ask for.  I shook my head like it's ok, and my wife said just a shot of olive juice please.  
She returned pretty fast and said ready  to order and we said yes, I ordered the grilled fish from the healthy options, and it was good besides it being way over salted, still edible and I don't mind salt so I finished it, but I can see anyone who doesn't like salt sending it back. 
My wife then had a few questions about her order she was asking about 2 different menu items sauces and the waitress reply was I don't know how to explain it, so I helped and explained the sauces. (Really just a cream sauce on one and the other was a garlic, oil, tomato, pepper sauce).
So my wife ordered the grilled steak with mushrooms, onions, peppers and a cream sauce with melted cheese over it.  It was the best dish we ordered. My kids had items off the kids menu that were just ok. 
While eating our food we were ask about 5 times if we needed boxes, and our reply was always were still eating. Finally we asked for a box for my wife's plate and she brings the check before the box. Pretty confusing as we wanted desert. Anyhow we spoke to a manger expressing our frustration and disappointment at the service and she was apologetic. We also mentioned the hostess greet at the beginning when we first arrived and her response was oh well she's not feeling well so I'm sending her home now.  So I said we'll not feeling well shouldn't stop you from a smile and saying hello.  She agreed. 
Final sum is that we would never go back, service wasn't good, menu knowledge wasn't good and overall friendliness was non existent. The manger didn't say anything to win us back either.

Recently I found myself heading here after reading some positive Yelp reviews. They seem to have a huge following and been here awhile. So we ordered take out. I understand dining in is a superior experience....but NOT with my one year old. We ordered the standard fare: chicken enchiladas, Chili relleno, rolled chicken tacos, and a carne asada chimichanga. 

1. I was immensely impressed by the huge bags we picked up and the amount of food we received for the modest price we paid. This was a damn good deal!
2. They were super friendly! 
3. They also gave us chips and salsa to go which I figure is a dine in only incentive. They were awesome. 
4. The food was delicious! 

The chimichanga was half the size of the fast food competitors chimichanga but was great. It could have been crispier. But this may have been due to the fact I waited 15 minutes to drive home and eat. The rolled tacos were tasty and massively topped with cheese, sour cream and guac. The chili relleno was average but worth ordering again. The rice I definitely recall being less bland and more tastier than other places. It was good. 

We will definitely come back here to dine in person. If it is that good to take out, dining in must be great. It's nice to find a good restaurant in the area to satisfy your craving. Tonight it was Mexican.",f587WkOuLAotgXOVAybylA,0,0,4,70z6W2zBtZ83FBkRX1l_bw

I only have two complaints 1.) the steak had a thick gristle streak in it.

The chicken in the  fajitas tasted like it was meant for a Chinese dish with a strong taste of soy sauce on a bed of onions; Literally just onions and chicken. Sucked!

Tortillas could have been good if they were not served on a paper towel in a French fry basket. They got hard after about 2 minutes. 

Service was subpar with the waiter not asking our preference of beans or tortillas. 

Chips and salsa were okay. The avocado dip tasted like green sour cream. 

At the end of the day, of you are looking for authentic Mexican food PLEASE don't go here. Go to Juans flaming fajitas, it puts this place to shame. That is all.",7BUvGUx_AAUTjwsQFTEhuw,6,0,2,1KIZgUiEd63CgM7WQklPkw

Service is great. The manager walks around to check up on customers often which is pretty cool. Waiter was nice. Quick, attentive and polite. 

Food was just okay. The sauces served for chips are a bit odd. You get one semi creamy, maybe avocado sauce and a warm red salsa. They taste okay though. I ordered beef fajita. My friends ordered burrito and quesadilla. Nothing notable. Fajita came with a lot of grilled onions and 2 grilled whole spicy pepper.

5598029,2017-05-07,0,lv5Bnqlt93NnvNJ2oNcQ8Q,Las Vegas needed a Tex Mex place. Being from Houston we couldn't believe that there wasn't a single true Tex mex in the entire city and have looked for 12 years. Los Cucos is from Houston (I believe as they are all over town).  FINALLY I can get a real fajita in LV.  In Houston I would rate Los Cucos as a slightly above average Tex Mex but I am so happy to have it in LV and being it is the only one here I give it 5 stars!  THe service is excellent and the restaurant is exceptionally clean (it is brand new). They have a Sunday brunch that is pretty good. I love their chips and green salsa and the Fajitas are amazing. Don't go here looking for northern Mexican style food (Michoacán ) like u get everywhere else in town- THIS IS TRUE TEX MEX,hsp6HzZp5qKGQlmqMOO0yQ,0,0,5,N4wId1lJy5YgLZ8s5oG8dg

********************************************
So I returned here with a group of people. The food was better tasting and still huge portions.  The service was better.  I still would not make this a destination when I am jonesing for Mexican food but if I am in the area I would eat here.  They have upped the game and improved.  
********************************************
MEH, I think that sums it up best.  The food is uninspiring and just run of the mill generic Americanized Mexican food.  The decor is tacky and uninteresting.  The service was ok, our waiter was not very friendly but he did take good care of us.   

The food was plentiful but not very interesting.  I ordered chicken fajitas and the chicken came in these huge strips of meat.  You could tell that the chicken and the veggies were food separately.  They were merged before presentation and had no time to get happy.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,1,1,4,S3f-6zDDLk_VxL5HdwqhLQ

There are only chicken tamales on a banana leaf, which I would've preferred pork. The tacos didn't seem to be too authentic either.

My family and I loved the salsa and the other green dip made up of sour cream, guacamole, and some other tasty ingredients. Lunch specials are awesome sauce! My hubby and I savored the shrimp quesadillas, my mom had chicken fajitas, my mother and father in law had chimichangas, and my kiddos had chicken quesadillas.

I didn't want to send back the plate because our server seemed  so inconvenienced by us.he brought us refills for our drinks just once and left the empty cups, chips and salsas on the table making the table cramped.

While service has always been quick, on point and kind, this place provides a great selection of menu items from tacos, nachos, enchiladas, to great beef, carnitas, shrimp and chicken and don't forget the rice and beans, chips and salsa or fresh guacamole made at your table. 
I have impressed with the quality of the dishes made and the serving amounts. First time ordered a meal platter for Two and boy was it way enough for two people! 

There is a full bar so don't forget the Margaritas and beer! Chips are refilled at No additional charge. 
Parking is a private lot shared with Chilies.
