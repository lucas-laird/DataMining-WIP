Definitely not a place where I want to go back or take anyone. Tried to work with them again for an event and they didn't want to make it work. I tried to provide the feedback and it wasn't well received.

The assortment of bagels, cakes / cookies, pastries and bread was almost overwhelming. It's definitely a place you have to go to a couple times so you can get a good idea of all they have to offer. 

It's kinda a hole in the wall. You can almost miss the location if you're not familiar with the area. 

The bagel chips are complimentary, and served when you are seated. Some pieces were really hard, but I guess that's the point. I ordered the Veggie Omelet with home fries and wheat toast. Great flavor, fresh tomatoes!

90063,2014-11-19,2,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"Chocolate babka, chocolate rugelach, and black&white cookie...my favorites from this place!

Upon first walking in, you're greeted with display cases of bagels, cream cheeses, and the best part in my eyes, sweets! If you're in a rush and don't want to dine-in, someone will take your order around that area and they'll bring it over to the cash register. Otherwise, if you'd like to sit in, to your left will be the dining area. 

What I've ordered:
-Lox and bagel platter: was told the sandwich and the platter were the same price. You have your choice of bagel and cream cheese; otherwise, you'll get plain cream cheese. Tried the everything bagel and onion bagel. Get the everything bagel.
-Matzo ball soup: I've never had it before but it definitely tastes comforting and homemade. You get chicken shreds, noodles, veggies, and a matzah ball. It also comes with your choice of bagel. Got the onion with this order. 
-Rainbow cookie: very sweet and moist. Not a big fan of rainbow cookies but you definitely can taste the almond flavor and raspberry filling.
-BABKA! Get it. They have 3 flavors and they're huge. Came home cradling it like it was a baby.  I got the chocolate. I'd describe it as a chocolate cinnamon roll made into a loaf with a doughy center and chocolate covering. Perfect with coffee. Waitress told us she makes them into french toast. Something I'm going to have to try next time because it was annihilated in 2 days. Not sure how often they make it or how popular this item is but I got the last one on display at 730a and they open at 630a.
-Chocolate rugelach: if you like chocolate, get it. They're like mini chocolate strudels/crossaints. Also available in sugar free chocolate and other flavors like raspberry and apple cinnamon.
-Black&white cookie: 2 sizes, small and large. Just go for the large. 

Overall, I like this place. Reminds me of a NY bagel cafe. Price is reasonable and service is friendly and welcoming. I plan to come back to try the rest of their sweets and the other flavors of babka. Needless to say, I enjoy this place and recommend it to those looking for a simple breakfast and some desserts.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,2,3,4,ROq2BmbugvhyO2ZrNySATw

Everytime I have ordered a bagel, it has been rock hard.  Coffee is nice and strong.  What really brings down the rating is the service.  The waiters just dont seem to care.

Stopped in for a dozen after lunch. Yes I understand it's Sunday but coming from NY I still can't believe that if a place runs out of certain flavors they don't make more. Surprisingly you had pumpernickel. Too bad you gave me a shortchanged dozen everything bagels (I ordered 2). Not surprised. I should know by now that the guys behind the counter can't count. Even if you tell them how many of each bagel. Always short 1 or 3. 
So now I really & truly am done with you. No more messed up orders. No more low quality food. No more e-coli from your undercooked frozen burger patties. No more crappy service. No more surly attitudes from counter guys. No more pathetic excuses for a manager.

Babka is good as well. The challah is good quality, but not quite as good as Weiss Deli in Henderson. Also, I prefer the smoked whitefish of Weiss and Levy's to their chunkier variety. The celery and other hunks detract from the smooth smokiness that I crave.

208922,2016-11-24,2,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"I've eaten at this place several times. Despite my two star rating, the food is relatively good. My last experience, however, left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pardon the pun). First, the portion sizes are obscene. I ordered a Cobb Salad and it was piled high with a half-pound of bacon, a half-pound of turkey, and a half-pound of ham. I'm not joking when I say I was absolutely disgusted by the sight of it. It was portioned for someone who is morbidly obese and rides around in a Hover-round waiting for bypass surgery or in line waiting to have a limb amputated because of sever Diabetes. Seriously...it's gross...and a total waste of food. Who wants 8-10 strips of bacon on a salad? It reminded me of why I don't like Deli's like this where they serve cumbersome sandwiches that are meant for three people. 

My second complaint about this place is a sign that I noticed on the door. It read, ""This is a place of peace...no weapons please"".  Are the owners brain-dead and tone-deaf to the environment we find ourselves living in now? Do they believe that a criminal or gawd-forbid, a terrorist is going to read that sign and say to themselves, ""gee, they don't allow weapons in here, maybe I should go to a Denny's.""? I legally carry because I have a constitutional right to protect my family and myself. Law abiding citizens with CCW and law enforcement officers are NOT the problem. Why would you put a sign in the window telling criminals that they won't find any resistance inside? 

Those two reasons alone make another visit unlikely. But, if I'm dragged back by friends or family who want to eat there...rest assured, I'll still be carrying...despite their idiotic ""kumbaya"" sign.",ngk1yxWvxCuO_lvJ87PReg,0,1,2,UAHvqm1nGiTk_k85x9E0Ng

Been there twice and extremely pleased both times (bfast and lunch). Breakfast was great with choice of bagel and I had the egg white spinach and feta omelet which was lite and chock full of fresh spinach. Lunch for our part of 3 pleased all. Wondered if I could try the liverwurst and the waitress gladly came back with a slice to try and the sandwich was great. I tried my lunchmate's pastrami and it was to die for. Relaxed and friendly atmosphere with a deli and dessert counter for take out which I did.

Finally made it in for breakfast and ended up taking lunch to-go and coming back the next day. We came early on a Saturday and thank goodness because it got really busy but the time we left (9:30ish).  It's a restaurant / bakery / NY style deli - wow!

Here's the rundown on what we've tried so far:
  -- Biscuits & sausage gravy with eggs and sausage patties  
I'm a country gravy girl and this was pretty good!
  -- Corned beef hash 
Best we've had in town!  My Honey actually ordered this and I ended up eating half his and giving up half my biscuit :)
 -- Egg salad and BLT sandwiches - both good, hard to mess up a BLT.
 -- Bagel with veggie cream cheese. They make their spreads in-house and they put it on generously! I'll get it on the side next time because the bagel itself is delish.
 -- Rougalades (sp?) all yum

Taking my son this weekend and can't wait to try the potato pancakes and pecan roll.  Would be 5 stars if the service was better, but hey it's a popular place so it get pretty busy and there is a wait - worth it to me though!",0qka5xnvBpBm7ZfGsU9oCg,0,0,4,GGxAjkF9_opTJb6mpUeI2A
235660,2011-05-04,0,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"Another place I must visit when I'm out in Vegas. Of course, I've only been here 3 times and each time I get the same thing. Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. Heaven in my mouth! I don't come here for the coffee, which is drinkable, but not the best. I come here for this heavenly lump crab dish.... and the deli/bakery items. My mom had me try the potato cakes last time we were there and..... excuse me. Had to take a breather. Just thinking about those delicious, wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce.... Yummmmmmmmm.

The cafe service has been great for me each time. The last time I was there was on a Sunday morning and they were jam packed!!! The waitress was great and attentive, even though the place was packed. On busy days, I understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because there's a lot more to pay attention to, so when I pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked, without hesitation, she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery. (I didn't want them remade.... they were still edible)

The bakery staff is why this place didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. Since I'm still new to the place, I didn't know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get service at the bakery. No one spoke up and when I tried to get the attention of one of the guys, I was blown off. When I finally received service, I placed my order and then asked for something from the deli. He treated my request as a big inconvenience. Needless to say, if it's a busy day, I'll just eat at the cafe and leave my bakery/deli order for another, less busy time.

Their food is great. Their bakery and deli items are delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone, but I would tell them to be patient and try to go when it's not so busy.",wklDtMfsGtk_DJFos0Li1g,0,0,4,FHA4HZOagN50F1RJ2XamqA

It smelt wonderful. It was seat yourself, which was easy. It was a little crowed and loud like a cafeteria. We waited for like 10 minutes for someone to finally acknowledge us to take our drink order and since we had time to look over the menu we where able to order our food. It seemed like it took awhile for us to get our food. 

We ordered the French toast with a side of sausage links. Two eggs with bacon/sliced tomato with everything bagel. The people you sat down long after us order two sandwiches and they got their food quicker than us. The food was great. Eggs were perfect and not just put together real fast. French toast had four huge pieces. I order the everything bagel, it would have been good if they didn't burn the top. The food was great. 

The services was just horrible. And not even worth it. When we finished we waited for our server to come with the check and we waited around 15 minutes for her to come. We never got any refills or even check on to make sure things were good. It was hard to even get someone's attention. Three stars for service. Otherwise would have given five.

Stick to the Jewish food--corned beef, matzo ball soup, hard salami, bagels etc etc--and you'll remain impressed.

However, if you came here for the bagels, fo'get about it, there are better things to have then the bagels. I was super stoked to check out this place but I have to say, I was a little disappointed. 

The food is good. It's not amazing, its good. The service honestly, could be a lot better. I like sarcasm, I don't like to be patronized.

If you're looking for a quick bite to eat or just a whatever place to have breakfast or lunch, this is the spot.  

They have a pretty big menu which is nice because it gives everyone an option. But, the one thing to have is the matzo ball soup. I've never had it before and I knew I had to try it. I can't imagine eating at any other place more Jewish than this. 

It arrives and it steaming hot. The steam alone had flavor. It was so delicious. This broth had to have been made by a 90 year old grandma in their kitchen. It's everything chicken noodle soup needs to be, plus the matzo ball. If I was ever sick, this is the soup that I would want, hands down. The flavors were intense and then subtle and then suddenly you're reminded of sitting in grandma's kitchen being served soup. Oh, just writing about it makes me want to have some.

If you save room, you'll find that this place has a great pastry shop. All the sweets are gigantic, so plan on sharing. The deli bar is okay. I've had better service and sad to say quality at my local grocery store. It's sad because people can have a much better experience if this place started looking at how the staff treats the guests.

Ciao and until next time, have eating everyone :)",hgGRHZsGPPoVD3JXBwEr6Q,1,1,3,igGpTyhp3PKbs18CU_sINA

They have a large selection of fresh bagels made daily with most flavors and styles you can imagine available.  They have a very large dessert case with some very decadent entries.  They also have the good old fashioned big old piled with meat deli sandwich available.

The Pizza Bagel is always enormous and tasty, but its a tall order to finish it alone.  The deli sandwiches are similar, piled high with your choice of various deli meats.  I always liked the cajun spiced turkey breast as well as the classic pastrami, but you really can't go wrong.

If you're from an area that has true delis and are missing it, give The Bagel Cafe a try.  Its the closest thing I found to what I love about visiting NYC.",si2HgoQo_SiTl3Ek4JGPpQ,1,0,5,u96Z4rzW72YdKsuzS8KhFw

We understand that there are policies, but the way that the staff explained that to us was very inapproprate. It was as if they were mad and we were children that needed to be scolded.

From the other reviews, maybe we got lucky because there was a car pulling out so parking was not a problem. And there were a couple tables open, so there wasn't a wait, plus our service was excellent.

We had a breakfast sandwich, a pastrami sandwich, matzo ball soup, an everything bagel, a sun dried tomato bagel, and the scallion cream cheese. The bakery section looked great and tempting but we were just to full. The bagels and cream cheese were phenomenal, huge and delicious. The pastrami sandwich was so good and big, definitely enough for two, but unfortunately the side potato salad wasn't very good (not a big deal considering everything else). The breakfast sandwich and soup were very good.

When eating out can play it safe for breakfast and order a simple standby OR you can explore a bit of culture via a thoughtful menu with quality ingredients.  The thing I love about The Bagel Cafe (TBC) is that here you will get a great meal no matter your breakfast habits. I wish I could say that I choose a unique breakfast when I come to TBC, but I do not. I order eggs (scrambled or poached), bacon, bagel, and fruit whenever I come. When I'm ready to venture out of my comfort zone, I'll order the smoked fish or hand sliced nova platter. It sounds dull, but I am proud to say that of the MANY times I have eaten here I have never been disappointed. Sure there are some slight variations in the food preparation, but the quality of the ingredients and care in preparation at this place never changes. 

A NOTE ABOUT THE BOOTHS: We seated ourselves and moved form one booth (too much sun) to another and discovered something unexpected. The tables at both booths were set farther back than we felt comfortable. Usually a booth table will be fairly close to your body, but I had to lean in during the meal to be closer to my plate. I am sure that people who need a it more space are more comfortable as a result of the change. 

FOOD: My NY mom and I visited recently and the cultural gap between us couldn't have been more evident than in our plates. I got the usual (eggs, bacon, bagel, fruit, with cottage cheese) while she ordered the overstuffed pastrami with chopped liver. People like me, looking for a meal we can order in any restaurant in the valley, will want to keep coming back to this place. They care about what they put on your plate in this place and they cook the food right. You won't be disappointed in dry, overcooked eggs here. And yes, as many have said, the bagels are amazing. I prefer the veggie spread--there is no equal in this town. The bacon has changed over the years, and I wish it was less salty, but it is always thick cut and flavorful.

Mom's pastrami was outstanding.  If, like me, you are accustomed to thinly sliced, rubbery meat, you will have to rethink your relationship with this delicious smoked meat. 

When the waitress didn't bring our large fruit cup with the meal,I figured she'd forgotten and I wasn't worried about reminding her. A few minutes later she set down a cocktail-type glass stacked with fresh fruit arranged in the shape of a flower arrangement with pineapple, kiwi, banana, strawberries, and pear. It was a smart way for TBC to remind it's customers that they care about small touches.  

Everything is good here.  I can't wait to get back.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,1,1,4,aLcR-RpY5AgVGSEqAHE27Q

(And from the conflicting opinions of the people on and off Yelp who attempt to describe one - including my darling wife, who lived outside of NYC for several years - I guess I'm not the only one who's confused.)  That being said, I'll fall back on the old saying that ""I may not know art, but I know what I like,"" and continue.

The food here is outstanding!  My wife, who was raised Jewish and, as I said, lived right outside NYC for several years and is experienced in New York delis, thinks her grandmother works in the kitchen making matzo ball soup.  I've never had a disappointing meal here.

The pastries are ... well, addictive.  And did I mention huge?  The deli take-out counter is also fantastic, with imported-from-New-York specialties and lots of house-made goodies.

The service is above-average, but sometimes a tad less-than-perfect due to the crowd size.  Nothing that would prevent us from coming back.

The only real knock I have on this place is the seating.  My wife has had several back surgeries, and I have a bad knee-and-hip that makes regular chairs a frequent issue.  We can't always be provided a booth when we arrive, simply because there aren't all that many of them and they tend to go quickly.  It certainly isn't anything that would keep us from coming back.

Other than that one little tick, you'll find the Orchid and I frequenting the Bagel Cafe often.  Good stuff, people.  Well done.

Server told us they were ""out of"" crumb cake and we would have to settle for the second choice. When we went to pay at the register, the wife saw 4 pieces of crumb cake in the display case.

Corned Beef on Rye - pretty legit, just slightly drier and sliced thinner than I'm used to but plenty good enough.  Pretty lean too.  The bread was excellent, flavorful and fresh.

Latkes - giant and humongous.  One order can feed a huge family.  Was very dry and probably wouldn't get these again.

Pickles - just my personal preference, I like full sour and these were like half sours.  Meh.

Cole slaw - was on the thinner, drier side too.

Bagels - excellent, big and giant which some may not like but I love the puffier style bagels.

Service - mixed.  Started out pretty good and petered out.  It took forever to get out bill and change back.

Bakery - yum!  The challah is pretty decent and their cookies are tasty.  I'll eventually work my way through all the baked goods, I'm sure.

This is one of the best sandwich shops in town, if not THE best. If you can believe it, the bologna is to die for. The roast beef is also delicious. It doesn't have any of that gag-worthy pink sheen that you so often see on roast beef.  The egg-salad is perfect - I think the secret ingredient must be some sort of bottled love of grandmothers. The restaurant has got a handle on the details, and I love that.  Menus that look like newspapers. Homemade pickles. Special cream cheese.

Oh yes, the cookies. When you first walk in it feels like walking into Wilka Wonka's chocolate factory. The dessert case may even have angelic lights shining on it. Everything is made daily and is well-worth cheating on the diet.

But unlike most delis, they are also open for dinner, so I thought we'd give them a try for takeout. (I've never eaten in the restaurant, although seating is available.)

Like most delis, they offer a huge menu of meats, fish, sandwiches, and pastries. And like most delis, they are pretty expensive. But you get a lot of food for the money, and they offer half portions of their sandwiches if you're not that hungry.

My husband had the combo reuben (a full portion), which was equal parts corned beef and pastrami. Like most deli sandwiches, this was overstuffed with meat. And while the meat was tasty, the abundance of it threw off the ratio of the other ingredients, so you couldn't really taste the sauerkraut and cheese. That said, it was a pretty good sandwich (although I'm not sure if it was $14 good). The reuben was served with fries and a side of too-sweet macaroni salad, both of which were unnecessary and were basically uneaten.

I wasn't as hungry, so I got a spinach knish and a quarter-pound of whitefish salad as a side. Together, this was under $8. The knish was fine; I've had their meat and potato knishes before and thought I'd try the spinach (the others are better). But the whitefish salad was great. It reminded me of the fish dip at Ted Peters Famous Smoked Fish in St. Petersburg, Florida, and I ate it as such: like a spread on crackers (which I had at the house). Not sure if you can eat it this way if you dine in, but I bet you could ask for some crackers and serve yourself up some tasty Vegas fish dip!

Next time, I'll double up on the whitefish and skip the knish. In fact, I'm craving that whitefish now ... See you soon, Bagel Cafe!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,0,4,zZ7wCAln4FSzxeZpL5HunA

Waitress scuttles away so fast that we could barely tell her what we needed, so more waiting. 

Usually I love the food for its authentic Jewish fare. Today, I ordered the potato pancakes. Huge, thick portion of 3 pancakes but served with the tiniest serving of sour cream and applesauce.

Which were HUGE and delicious (from what I remember anyway). I must admit, I think it's pretty cool how they've got the bagel display and other treats set up. It's just a comfy cozy kinda feeling to me. 

Last time we came it was mid morning and this place was p a c k e d! So this morning we opted to go about 7:30a just after they open to avoid the crowd; and we did just that. We were invited to seat ourselves when we walked in and immediately upon seating we were greeted and asked for our drink order. This was a good start and excited me because after our recent trip to PR I was glad to get great and quick customer service at a home town restaurant. 

I ordered the spinach and feta cheese omlet (added tomato); it came with home fries and a bagel with cream cheese. The bagel I loved. The home fries were ok. In the omlet they used fresh spinach which was great, I hate when restaurants use frozen or canned crap. Other than that I didn't really care for the omlet; I'm super picky with eggs and the eggs in this omlet were dry like over cooked, & it had browning on the outside of it which to me is disgusting. My bf had a bagels and lox; he loved it, just like he loves everything. 

The reason I give this place a 3 is because the food here just did not knock my socks off AND because they charged $4.50 for an orange juice, really? After we left I made the bf go around back and see if there was an orange tree back there because that's the only reason I can justify paying that much for a glass of juice, is if the tree is in the back growing those damn things and picked fresh daily. Lo and behold, there was no tree. I'm willing to give another try though sometime in the future. Their service though is definitely a 5 stars; from the friendliness of our waitress to how quick the food came out (under 10 min).",FTZdbIhC4Rccd6phcO86Ug,3,2,3,nIEvXzBi_yRfdpA-8Ru1Cw

the pastrami : not edible, the soup was cold and from a can, the potato salad came from a plastic tub. they are making nothing homemade as they ""claim"", the salmon was a salmon substitute ( very gummy after one bite, i was afraid to eat anymore in a chance i would become ill).. all of their food is frozen and microwaved.go buy a frozen sandwich, microwave it thats what our disgusting sandwiches tasted like for quadruple the price!!.. the waitress told me and rolled her eyes, she also told us she found a new waitress job because they have to tell customers food is homemade when nothing is made there and she did not want to lie to customers. i repeat DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE",-TMDrC66dvClx5Z7Hdzrfw,0,0,1,RpTmFI0HEln4egTJclUn_w
1531199,2014-01-17,1,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"TLDR: The namesake bagels are surprisingly well done here: large, fluffy, and great with lox and/or their cream cheese- the green onion is my favorite, and they're all made in house. The matzo ball soup (better than the version at Weiss) and thick-ass pastrami sandwiches are also pretty great. 

2 ounce lox plate with a spinach and feta bagel and cheddar-garlic cream cheese: not a combo I'd normally opt for, but somehow it all really worked together- the fish was fresh and silky and plentiful, the bagel toasty and chewy, the schmear chunky with cheese and fragrant with garlic. Everything was plated beautifully too, a leaf of lettuce under all of the thick slices of tomato and red onion, a russian pickle, several slices of cucumber, and a handful of olives, too.

I peeked in the pastry case ""just for a look""- and walked out with a ""small"" black and white, that was easily the size of my hand. Great cookie, overly sweet frosting. My BF samples a different cake each visit and hasn't yet found anything he dislikes.

ETA: Pizza bagels (particularly the fresh spinach and feta) are divine, especially on the garlic bagel;  the tongue sandwich is also light and silky and delicious.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,0,3,ipBeb6o1k0uLspWsAM5PJg

It looked so delicious. I wanted it... I wanted it badddd.....

Now in my mind, a Black and White cookie is the beautiful love child of a cookie and a cake: soft inners with just enough crisp to keep a firm shape and texture. When I went for my first break of the cookie, it felt soft, and not just soft, but cakey. That's ok, I guess again....... Maybe the frosting would be better? No... The frosting was way too soft.

The sandwich was perfection. The homemade pickle was discussting.they should make a few different pickled types, it tasted like a half done pickle. The macaroni salad had too much pickle flavor, would not order that again.

The cafe is located in an unsuspecting plaza filled with lots of medical and realtor offices. Parking was decently easy to find. Even though we got there around 1, there was still a 20ish minute wait for a table. While you wait, you can look at all the desserts and bagels they have on display. You have the option of dining in or taking out.

Their menus are already at the table and are fashioned after newspapers. I thought it was extremely adorable.

I ordered the homemade matzoh ball soup and toasted asiago bagel with scallion cream cheese. I must pat myself on the back because that bagel/cream cheese combo was so bomb. The bagel had just the right density and springiness to it with every bite. It's no wonder they're called Bagel Cafe. I also snuck a bite of my friend's everything bagel with nova cream cheese and plain bagel with blueberry cream cheese. The nova cream cheese was awesome, and I definitely wouldn't mind paying the extra dollar for it. This was my first time trying any kind of matzoh ball soup, and I enjoyed it enough. It's basically a glorified chicken soup--it got better with every bite.

Given that I have been nonstop complimenting their food, why the three stars then? The service was atrocious. The busboy delivered us our waters right away, but after that, it took forever for the waitress to actually take our order. I actually noticed two tables who were seated after us got their orders taken first and some of their food delivered before us. We had come at the tail end of lunch, and the crowd was dying down. There was absolutely no excuse for the waitress to ignore our table like that. The busboy actually stopped by and asked if our orders had been taken/told us that he'd get the waitress for us. She never apologized for ignoring us/being slow, but she was very fast at giving us our bill. 

I will very likely be back for their bagels, but I am wary of dining in again.

Another place I must visit when I'm out in Vegas. Of course, I've only been here 3 times and each time I get the same thing. Lump Crab Eggs Benedict. Heaven in my mouth! I don't come here for the coffee, which is drinkable, but not the best. I come here for this heavenly lump crab dish.... and the deli/bakery items. My mom had me try the potato cakes last time we were there and..... excuse me. Had to take a breather. Just thinking about those delicious, wonderful potato concoctions with the apple sauce.... Yummmmmmmmm.

The cafe service has been great for me each time. The last time I was there was on a Sunday morning and they were jam packed!!! The waitress was great and attentive, even though the place was packed. On busy days, I understand poaching eggs can be a little difficult because there's a lot more to pay attention to, so when I pointed out that my eggs had been overcooked, without hesitation, she comped me for one of my favorite things in the bakery. (I didn't want them remade.... they were still edible)

The bakery staff is why this place didn't receive a 5 star rating from me. Since I'm still new to the place, I didn't know that you had to stand in line at the deli to get service at the bakery. No one spoke up and when I tried to get the attention of one of the guys, I was blown off. When I finally received service, I placed my order and then asked for something from the deli. He treated my request as a big inconvenience. Needless to say, if it's a busy day, I'll just eat at the cafe and leave my bakery/deli order for another, less busy time.

Their food is great. Their bakery and deli items are delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone, but I would tell them to be patient and try to go when it's not so busy.",LhQ9dbYxnawbAsQ1DVn79Q,0,0,4,fuXzMaoPQ3ijxRQrcDgfCg

After I received my sandwich, I decided that I'd rather sit down and eat it.  I told the cashier that I wanted to sit down, and rather than being courteous and finding me a seat, she told me that the tables are for people that order food from a waitress.  Ridiculous!  I guess spending $15 for a sandwich, fries and potato salad isn't enough for me to to sit down at their establishment and enjoy my meal.

1827641,2016-11-20,2,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"I have to start with a disclaimer that I grew up in New York/Philadelphia and recently moved from Chicago so I've had probably some of the best Jewish food in the country and I have high standards. I love Jewish food and will spend hours hunting down the best place I can find whenever I move somewhere new. That being said, I can't understand some of the people who have reviewed this place and say it's the best food they've ever had. Most of them have probably lived in LV all their lives and simply don't know any better, because as anyone who's lived near large urban cities probably knows, LV is pretty much an ethnic food-challenged culinary backwater for the most part. 
To be fair, my gf and I stopped by here a while ago on a Sunday at a very busy time. The line was out in the parking lot. I figured the food must be authentic and legit. Wrong! We ordered some easy, quick to make dishes and waited almost an hour, even sitting at the counter with open spots. I get it was crowded, but the service was sub-par, the waitress would disappear for 20 minutes and never bothered to even check back with us or apologize for the long wait. They need to figure out how to serve the public properly, either they're chronically understaffed or just don't have the right systems in place. The lack of acknowledgment of poor service borders on inexcusable and even if the food had been better I still would have thought twice about returning.
The ""fresh squeezed"" orange juice with no pulp was most likely Tropicana, it was room temp to boot. The bagels are doughy and too big, pretty much tasteless. You know it's bad when bagels from Einstein's totally outclass this place. The eggs were under-cooked and mediocre. To me the true test of a good Jewish deli is how good the potato pancakes are. Total fail - they were too thick, not hot and soggy. They basically tasted like a big home fry patty, not seasoned correctly either. It was disgusting I couldn't even finish it. 
They didn't want to substitute anything, and every add-on dish was $6 or more. It was big-city prices for an inferior execution. I honestly lost my appetite and was so disappointed with their ""real Jewish food"" that I couldn't wait to get out of there.
Nothing seemed special or unique about this place - they just overcharge because there really isn't any competition in the jewish deli biz in Vegas. I'd rather eat at Subway then ever go back to bagel cafe. For those of you who don't want to be part of the sheeple herd that seem devoted to this train wreck of a pretend Jewish restaurant, I highly recommend Weiss Deli in Green Valley, Henderson. It's a hole in the wall with spot-on service that can give some of better delis in Chicago a run for their $. The matzo ball soup is served in a trough-sized container and one matzoh ball is literally baseball sized, enough for 2 or 3 to share. The plates there are so big you could eat for 3 days on a sandwich. Compare the two and see for yourself - I guarantee you won't be disappointed. It's doesn't get much worse than Bagel Cafe.",_kQkkZUKOmJBD6t0CA-eHQ,2,1,1,MsMcQovXaJDHj4cHZOPJKA

After my last visit the day after Christmas I may never come back...EVER!   Let me start off by saying that it was very early and not busy at all. Just me and two other people in the bakery area.   I placed my order for sliced bagels and cream cheese selections and moved on to the cashier.  At the register, I decided that I needed some soup for our lunch later that day so I ordered 2 chicken noodle soups w/ 3 matzo balls in each.  Didn't seem very difficult and the cashier said that she ""would ring them up but just this one time since it wasn't busy.""  ??? I didn't know soup needed to be ordered from the guys at the bagel counter...fine, my mistake, now I know for the future.  No big deal.  Here's where it all went downhill.  The cashier that I ordered the soup from rang up 3 soups instead of 2.  When she gave me the total I asked why it was so much? (The bowls of soups are $8.50 each)  She showed me the receipt and she rang up 3 soups instead of 2 which was her mistake.  During the process of refunding the soup you would have thought it was the end of the world that she had to refund 1 soup (which hadn't even been packaged yet).  She turned to another employee and rolled her eyes during the process all with me standing right there.  I spent over $50 on bagels and soups to go.  I told her that she was very rude and why I felt that way.  I walked out to my car which was parked in front of the big huge window by the register and she was huffing and puffing around talking about me to her co-worker.  I watched all of this through the window and made the decision to go back inside for the manager.  I told the manager exactly what happened.  He wanted me to ""just let it go because it was the holidays""...WHAT?!?! Holidays or not when your employees are unprofessional and losing you business you better address your problems.  What a terrible approach from the manager to know I was treated poorly and to tell me to let it go because of the holidays without a simple apology.

No apology...no yelp stars or business from me.  Never again will I spend my money here! There is something to be said for good customer service and this place doesn't have it.  I noticed some other reviews that noted rude and poor service.  I could have chalked it up to the cashier having a bad morning but with a terrible manager it was a double whammy.  I guess being rude is acceptable and you can put up with it or go somewhere else.

The guy at the bagel counter was wonderful.  This issue was from the cashier and then the terrible manager.    Just because I walked out the door and can't hear you doesn't mean I can't SEE you talking trash about me through your huge windows!

From previous visits during the busy times I learned that you must stand your ground in the line or people will just cut right in front of you. People act like their time is more important than yours and it's like they go ahead of you on purpose.  Nobody ever knows whose turn it is to order...pretty chaotic!",5fZk-aijjsRehb_jZJRXag,7,0,1,w9_MhoGQe51LMl5_C6SwFQ

We ordered two veggie omelets with potatos and sourdough bread. For drinks we had 1 coffee and 1 hot tea and I also ordered a cinnamon bun to go for my assistant, because I am the best boss ever. Total cost was approx. $33.

Plate presentation was amazing. Everything here seems to be supersized and looks delicious. The 4 pieces of sourdough toast between us was probably a half loaf of bread! Yabba Dabba Doo!

The omelets were very good: Fresh vegetables mixed into the egg and cooked thoroughly... I'm picky when it comes to undercooked eggs. The only criticism I can offer is there was a lack of salt, but there was salt at the table so we added salt to our own to taste.

The potatos were ok. Nothing really exciting about them. My wife asked for no onions in her omelet and when the plate was delivered the potatos had onions.  No biggie.

The restaurant serves as a bakery and deli as well. The bakery side has lots of goodies that look like they are on steroids.  The cinnamon bun is huge and could easily feed three to four people. 

Our waitress was friendly and prompt and everyone else in the restaurant looked like they were enjoying  the same level of service. 

While slightly pricier than other breakfast spots in the area, it isn't a smokey bar or a chain restaurant, which makes it appealing to me.",SNpi9tKh2EUWdbxAELLMpA,1,1,4,rNCyqTmIvztzf1dly49YWw

They have a huge assortment of bagels and cream cheeses, as well as deli salads, fish, cold cuts, and some amazing desserts for purchase. The bagels are my favorite. They are soft and baked in house with over a dozen flavors. They are extra delicious if you can get them fresh out of the oven. We usually get a baker's dozen, which is 13 bagels, and a flavored cream cheese, as well as egg and tuna salads. This makes for a yummy brunch. 

My last visit was on a Sunday around 1 and I was in and out quickly. You order at the deli counter, and then pay at the register. For a dozen bagels, 1 pound of lox cream cheese, a pound of tuna salad, and half a pound of egg salad I spent $40. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it. You get what you pay for, and you are paying for quality food. Whenever anyone suggests bagels, this is the place we always go to.

I was really jonesing for this breakfast because I'd never been to a place that will put pastrami (and some of the other deli meats) in an omelet.  It just sounded good, you know?  

The omelet was great.  The pastrami was really tender and full of flavor.  My home fries were not warm and tasted like they had been sitting around for awhile.  Same goes for my husband's breakfast, which also had his eggs scrambled, not sunny side up.  He always orders sunny side up.  I didn't even notice because I was digging into my tasty pastrami.  He opted not to have it corrected and just helped me eat my omelet.  The mocha tasted like watery hot chocolate and was really disappointing at $4.50.  One of us ordered a chocolate chip bagel with regular cream cheese and the bagel was very nice and chewy.  Really enjoyed that even though there were no discernible chocolate chips in it.

Other than the omelet and the bagel, there's really nothing that was good about our breakfast.  The atmosphere was very noisy.  On one side I had a loud talker blaring in my ear his expertise about car tires, and on the other we had a little poopster who had probably just learned to pull herself up and stand and look around.  She also enjoyed pulling on my husband's shirt and ear.  Not cute or cool.  I wish the people who shot out that kid were paying a little more attention to her.  

I would go back again and try some of their other items.  Maybe it was just a bad day.  Our total after tax, before tip, was $31.08 and it was just not a good 30-dollar breakfast.

It tasted like the pastrami you can get at any Smith's deli - not REAL pastrami. I opened up the sandwich and noticed it had no fat at all. While excessive fat is a no no, no fat is just as bad. Fat is where a lot of flavor is. The sandwich was so dry that it sucked the moisture out of my mouth. They need to take a look at their purveyor to question the source of their pastrami.

Nothing has changed here. It is still a hidden gem of Vegas with signage that is in no way loud. You enter straight into the deli portion where you can place to go order. Pass this and you can be seated. The seats are still awkward unless you are in a booth - but I am the person who always prefers a booth and I will wait. Over the years I have become increasingly impressed with their Hand Cut Nova 4oz. About $17 it comes with tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, onions, capers, obviously Nova, and any bagel you like. I recommend it if you like this style of breakfast in general. 

I only have two complaints from my visits here. First, the orange juice does not taste ""fresh squeezed"" like they claim on the menu. It tastes watered down. If this is not the case the quality of the oranges must be severely lacking. Additionally, I don't like that you check out at the counter. This normally would not be an issue but it has happened before that after I ate I wanted a to-go order for my friend at home. The waitress said she could not take the order and to order at the register, and the register asked me to order in the deli line, which took ten more minutes than I would have been willing to spend had I known I had to start from scratch to order after I already ate.

2348814,2014-04-21,3,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"I'm updating my review due to the extremely RUDE manager on duty on Easter! 

I placed an order for pick up early on Sunday to have picked up at two. I ordered four meals and several pastries from the case. When I was checking out I mentioned that I was to get a side and bagel option with the Benedict I ordered, per their menu online(see picture). Two girls told me no before they asked the manager, Jeremy/Jerry. Who said no but go a head and give it to her, I said thank you. He proceeds to get a menu to point it out. I said ok just to let you know your menu online says that all eggs and omelet dishes come with a choice of sides stated and a bagel. (All in the same section of the Benedict's). He said it comes with an English muffin but I'm not going to make a big deal out of a bagel and that he's never had anyone ask for the bagel. I don't respond because I know better and he agreed to give me the bagel. But I think to myself well I understand that a Benedict comes with an English muffin, I'm not stupid but the menu didn't state a bagel for a substitute. The girl ringing me out said oh the online menu? Well what this guy doesn't know is that I've worked in and managed places very similar to this and I know when a cashier is sympathizing with a customer. They obviously have had this complaint before also by the way he immediately got defensive. 

So I pay $75 AND tip (not to mention the $8.25 for a ""large"" side of fruit that was a mere pint) and we leave. As were walking out the door I hear ma'am, like I've forgotten a bag. Ha nope! It's the manager coming outside to argue some more. (My BF said after we left that when he came out the manager said I didn't want to argue with you inside....uhhh how about not at all) He tries to speak but I say to the BF let's go and he starts going on and on and I walk around the BF to walk away and the manager says ""ridiculous"" as he's wailing back in. Ummmm NNO!!! I turn around, open the door and say that was uncalled for and walked away. He comes out again and says next time you can get a bagel instead of the English muffin. Well Manager of the Year, there won't be a next time!! 

Ok so! So many things wrong with this!! First of all a manager following me outside to argue with a customer!!! Outside!! Over a bagel!!! You seriously have nothing better to do? I never had time to do that when I was a manager nor was it something I wished to do and seek out. He was so mad about giving me a bagel he steamed over it and still felt he hadn't said enough! 

Second, let me inform some of you who might not know...those bagels you pay $2.00 and then some only cost about $.25 to make. Hmmm customer comes to my store spends $75, makes a valid point about what your crappy online menu says, give $.25 bagel to make customer happy. Most restaurant managers know the common sense in that! 

I seriously couldn't say enough about this! 
Uncalled for. Unprofessional. A frequent customer is now a nonexistent. I'm not happy about refusing to have their pastries!! But not worth giving any more of my money to them!!",EPa3uxyyGfRMpPX47lKwvQ,12,4,1,jvjXm0PwtxCVX1hOfGQ0wg

I decided to take my order to go, which is convenient and super fast. I ordered a turkey pastrami sandwich on wheat with macaroni salad. While the man at the deli made my order, I browsed the dessert case. They have a wide selection of cookies and pastries, most of which are super sized. I decided on the chocolate cupcake, which looks like a jumbo version of a Hostess cupcake.

I am not a huge sandwich fan, but this one was pretty good. Fresh veggies, and a load of meat. Half of the sandwich was enough to fill me up, and I have a big appetite. The macaroni salad was actually pretty good too. The portion was tiny and it's a little sweet, but I'd get it again. The pickle - don't bother. It had the most odd taste, and it's more like a cucumber than a pickle. Thankfully, was free.

I was really excited about the cupcake, but sigh. The ganache on top is done really well. The cake, however, is incredibly dry. There isn't enough ganache or cream filling to save the cake. You'll need a glass a milk with this one.

I added a bag of chips and CJ's Italian ice to my order, and my total was a little more than $20. A little pricey, but the food was pretty good.

Overall, very good experience. I will check them out again.",xD0zXwapBausN9rwNLAXcg,1,1,4,IeoS12LDDmbjyiAjiGBAig

I recommend the jalapeño cheese bagel with  regular cream cheese or the jalapeño cream cheese. Yummy with a spicy kick. All of their bagels and spreads are homemade too! They also serve breakfast, lunch, & I think dinner.  Their steak & egg breakfast is so yummy. As is their club sandwich. They also have a bakery section where they have all kinds of treats to choose from. Tiramisu, cookies, cakes, brownies, ginormous cinnamon rolls, muffins, pies, and lots of other things.

2356904,2012-02-21,2,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"I spent my formative culinary years in New York City.  I know a good bagel!  That doesn't make me Einstein, nor will we mention that name again in a review about bagels.  I am happy to say I have officially named The Bagel Cafe the second best bagel in Las Vegas.  You might think that is no big deal, but it took me more than 20 repeat visits to issue this award.   Now let's get on with the details.

The place is apparently owned by one of two brothers.  I heard the other brother owns the bagel place at Suncoast.  I also heard they don't get along.  It's just a rumor...  but an interesting one.  The bagels here are nearly perfect.  A certain hardness is required on the outside to match a chewy inner bagel.  They come real close to New York perfection here.  They have all the required varieties, and appropriate toppings.  Whitefish salad to Cream Cheese and Salmon they have it all and it's tasty.  The service is typical New York style.  No warm friendly teenagers who want you to know their name here.  More like veteran deli personnel who are bored stiff with your order.   That is not a complaint, by the way.  I love it all.  I feel like I am down on East 14th street all over again.  

The food comes quickly with no fanfare.  The plates and trimmings are all deli standard.  The restaurat is clean and even the bathrooms aren't awful, though the line can get out of hand and make things unpleasant.  If you on weekends, plan to wait in line.  If you are a fan of NY deli... plan to spend some $ after the meal in their deli.  Grab some lox and bagels to go.  I'd even pick up a bag of Wise chips for lunch tomorrow.  (The plain Wise chips still make me salivate at the thought of opening the bag).  Very reasonable pricing so it won't break the bank.  Parking is tight so leave the SUV at home... please.  

Overall, a great bagel experience with all the trimmings.  So are you wondering where the best bagel in Las Vegas can be found?  Well, I might let you know one day soon.  For now I will keep the lines there short and just give you one hint.  The guy that owns the best NY bagel place in Las Vegas... possible the best on the West Coast.... isn't from NY.  He's from Chicago.  Say it aint so.....",qBVFHqJlMn50amD-67wTjQ,1,0,4,GmY-XOnCiEFkJ8ztoah7YQ

The next annoyance was that there was no bagel-shmear-lox item on the menu. I had to order a bagel and a small Nova platter. The waitress was good in asking if I wanted capers, as of course I did. The bagel did come with an adequate amount of schmear; I often have to ask for more but here I didn't. The small Nova platter was a major disappointment. There were a lot of greens (more than I needed of lettuce, tomato slices, cucumber slices, and a half a pickle) but an insignificant amount of lox.

Funny thing about Jewish deli's....it's the one type of restaurant that I'm willing to tolerate attitude from the servers and staff, that sort of New York attitude where they might seem to be rude but really aren't, it's just their style.  And the reason most tolerate it also is because the food is so good it doesn't matter.

However, this isn't the case here. The staff has a terrible unfriendly attitude, and guess what...the food is NOT in fact good enough to justify it. This is no Nate n Al's, or Brent's, two outstanding LA favorites.  This place is marginal at best, and it's amazing to me they are the only deli on the entire West side. Now, maybe Cantor's will change things, but from what I hear of their prices, probably not.

So for now I remain a sad deli fan, sad that the only semi reasonably priced deli anywhere near me treats me like an unwelcome stranger, and in exchange I get food that the people in LA, not to mention NYC, would laugh at.",GdnJtqYWVSBAjya-WdN5RQ,4,1,2,jq6tVRFEOGD0ZVU0IvdrEQ

My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed ""fresher"" than others, and if you've ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I'm used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.

But it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don't see out here in LV.

This Jewish deli is a local's paradise. Come here to get your bagel and lox fix, you will not regret it. 2 oz smoked fish  of your choice, we chose (nova), a bagel of your choice for $11.95. My fiancé and I chose the everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and nova lox since it's less saltier than the belly lox. Very fresh and meaty smoked salmon with just the right saltiness. It comes as a platter with red onion, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber and some olives. I loved the cream cheese, it tasted freshly made plus they don't skimp. Of course the bagel was the star of the show. The everything bagel was super plump and airy with the right amount of crisped edges. Flavor rating: 5/5

We also tried the belly lox but we felt that the saltiness was a little bit too much for us. Flavor rating: 3/5

We also ordered a bagel sandwich: jalapeño cheddar bagel with pepper jack cheese, scrambled egg, and bacon for $6. Super simple but the fresh bagel really shines and made everything come together for the perfect bite. The jalapeño and cheddar flavor were equally weak, however the texture of the bagel was great. Flavor rating: 3/5

And for the road we ordered a raisin bagel with cinnamon raisin walnut cream cheese $3.50. They hook it up with the cream cheese so that there is enough to spread equally onto the giant plump bagels. I really loved the cinnamon walnut cream cheese! It's sweet and creamy and went well with the raisin bagel. Flavor rating: 5/5

This place is quite the spot to be at during breakfast and brunch hours so be prepared for a hectic environment.

When I was in Miami, I lived next to a great Jewish Bagel shop that made great bagel sandwiches that I would hit up all the time. But after moving to WV, I learned to make my own bagels, which were good but not quite up to par with the pros yet.

So seeing this place so close to home was nice. I stopped in for a bagel sandwich but didn't realize how big and happening this place was on a Sunday afternoon. Fortunately, everyone was waiting for a table for Brunch, so I was able to make an order for take out right away at the deli. 

The deli is packed with all sorts of goodies that send my mind into a diabetic coma. Chocolate fudge cake, black forest cake, NY cheesecake, Babka, rugelach, all forms of cookies, bagels, cream cheeses and deli meats. My mouth watered just thinking about it. :)

I ordered a toasted poppy seed bagel with eggs, cheddar cheese, and pastrami - plus a slice of chocolate fudge cake. One thing I figured out was they go big here. The slice of cake felt more like the whole cake, and the bagel was very big - I like that a lot.

Once I got home and digged into it, I was pretty pleased with it. Bagel was nicely toasted, and made for a good sandwich. The chocolate fudge cake is everything you would expect it to be - chocolaty and fudgy, lol. It is very large, and could easily have been cut into 3 slices that each would have been considered big.

I don't eat breakfast often, but when I do, I prefer The Bagel Cafe. Stay hungry my friends.

Seriously though, this place has the dopest bagels and pastries. The best part about it? They don't taste overly sugary! I could literally eat a cookie, a black coffee and a jalapeno and cheese bagel every day. 

The ONLY reason this place gets knocked off of the perfect 5 stars is because of service at the cashier. Just because it is a New York-style eatery, does not mean you can treat your customers like they're Bostonians. The cashier was pretty rude when I was taking out my money to pay as if I should've already had it out and ready...really?

We used to go to the Bagel Cafe every weekend cause it was down the street from my bf's old domicile. I don't know if I am being fussy but I just don't like their omelettes or eggs for that matter. The eggs are always a bit overcooked for me and I really don't like their assembly. The omelette has a slice of cheese slapped on top. And since I am not a fan of bell peppers I do not like their seasoned potatoes. And it seems like every time I go their bacon is undercooked.

So the things I have liked so far are, of course, their bagels. My personal favorite is the sesame, my bf usually likes the asiago. The garlic cheddar cream cheese is good but it is so strong that after a while it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I also like the cheese blintzes, they are very large and full of sweet cheese. Tthe potato pancakes are pretty good as well.

I am obsessed with bagels.  When I am preparing for a trip anywhere, one of the first things I do is try to figure out where I'm going to get my morning bagel fix.  I don't eat bagels everyday, but I need to know where to score if I need a hit.

A toasted Everything bagel with a nice schmear of regular cream cheese and a cafe latte is just about my all time favorite on-the-go breakfast.  No breakfast burritos for me, thank you very much.  

The Everything bagels here are the best I've had all year.  Absolutely delicious and wonderfully chewy, they are as good as it gets.  

While they clearly know how to make bagels here, toasting them is another thing.  The seeds and other toppings on the top of the bagel were burnt.  Under the cream cheese, the inside of the bagel didn't appear to be toasted at all.  Should be the other way around, minus the burnt.

It was still delicious a delicious bagel, so I'm not deducting any stars. But it sure would be nice if they could address the toasting issue.  At home it's just a matter of switching the setting on the toaster oven from Toast to Broil: the insides get toasted and the seeds/nuts/onions don't turn an unappetizing black.  Surely there's got to be a way a restaurant can toast their bagels without burning the toppings.

The cafe latte here was also excellent, even though it was served at about 1,500 degrees F.  Watch out, McDonald's!

Parking is a huge issue here.  There are some 10-15 minute parking places right next to the restaurant, and if you are taking your order to go , that's fine.  If you are planning on sitting down, you're going to have to scramble for a parking place in the medical center's very crowded private parking lot.

This place is totally legit!  I'm definitely looking forward to trying some of the other things on the menu.

When we first walked in, my eye was instantly drawn to the massive selection of desserts they have. I'm talking cookies, cupcakes, napoleons, eclairs the size of your face, and more. I wanted it all. Next to that was the bagel selection - there must have been somewhere close to 17 different bagels to choose from, along with a great variety of cream cheese. Too cool. We waited ~10 minutes to be seated and were quickly served water and day old bagel crisps with a sample of their newest cream cheese flavor. 

The menu is a little intimidating because it's large and there are many delicious items to choose from. I went for the egg sandwich with avocado on a garlic bagel and it was excellent and super affordable - plus, the side of avocado was basically a whole half of an avocado! The second day I got the same, but went for cheese instead avo (both cost extra) and I got it on the asiago bagel, which I preferred to the garlic. I must say, despite how good the bagels were, the star of this restaurant was the yogurt parfait - it arrived in a huge bowl with so much fruit, my jaw dropped - strawberry, raspberry, mango, bananas, kiwi, and more (see photo). Just wow. For dessert we had chocolate rugulah and it was perfection.

Now, nothing beats a proper NYC bagel, but these are as close as you are going to get in Vegas.They have a MASSIVE selection of cream cheeses with which to dress your bagel, and lots of toppings to select as well.  The holy grail of bagels is the Everything, and mine was done right.  The seed and spice mixture was in perfect proportions, and they held to the bagel with aplomb.

I also found their black & white cookie to be spot on - a light and moderately lemony cake with delicate vanilla and chocolate fondant.  I'd go back just for that.

3024263,2010-11-20,8,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"New York Style Deli's are a touchy subject with me.  When done right, they are like staring into the face of God and having him smile back you and say ""You are my most precious creation"" but when done wrong, they make me sadder than Pauly Shore's acting career.  The Bagel is in the former category and can easily lay claim to best delicatessen in Las Vegas.

Judge a Jewish deli by five things:  The rye bread, the pastrami, the knish, the sweet & sour cabbage soup and if they sell the black & white cookie.  Alright, that last one might be homage to Seinfeld, but the other 4 will definitely tell you if a Deli is worth it's salt.  The Bagel has them down.  First, the rye bread is fresh and the perfect consistency.  Its got a nice crust and the heels are a perfect complement to any of their soups or sandwiches.  Speaking of soups, their sweet & sour cabbage soup is dynamite.  Chocked full of cabbage and with a simple beef bouillon to absorb the flavors, its a nice lunch on a cold day...to remind you of back home in Jersey.  The pastrami is like butter and practically melts in your mouth and if you want to get fancy, upgrade to a Reuben.  Finally the Knish....where do I began?  You are so good, I'm officially declaring myself on ""a gravy train with knish wheels.""  

So you're probably wondering why no five stars?  Well, the Bagel is excellent but I cant dis the original gangsta deli's like Brent's in LA, Manny's in Chicago or Katz's in New York by putting it on the same level so consider the Bagel 4 1/2 stars as it pays homage to the grand masters.  For Las Vegas however, you can't do any better.  

Ohhh, and you're probably wondering why I never even brought up their namesake as well.  Bagels here are good, but bagels are bagels.  They do have an impressive selection and to go is available if you're not dining in.  They also have a bakery that would make my Bubby declare this place ""Meshugganah!"" the portions are so large....",9qjLfaAqMxgfqdtTlPwRUQ,8,8,4,_NkCR1IWBJFIz44PjHTRFA

We were told it was a measured amount....that's how they do it. Except it's not and we know because like I said, we've been regulars for YEARS.

But I still think about The Bagel Cafe and I get super peanut-butter-and-jealous when I see my friends check in there on Facebook. 

If you're wondering what's good here, the answer is everything, seriously. The best part of coming here is buying deli stuff on the way out. My fiance was obsessed with the pumpkin cream cheese for awhile, and I liked bringing the deli tuna home and eating that for a few days. It kept fresh for awhile and it is the best tuna I've ever had. Nothing else compares. Obviously their bagels are the best. You cannot beat them. Also, I have to mention my family is Jewish and I hardcore judge any Jewish deli's chicken soup and matzo balls. Theirs doesn't beat my mom's, but it comes damn close. It beats mine, as hard as that is for me to admit! Plus when you order a soup, you get a bagel! My fiance loved their eggs and sausage specials and he'd try a different bagel/cream cheese combo with it every time we came. I'm a huge fan of ALL of their desserts too. They have a ton to choose from. It's been awhile so I can't remember specifically, but we'd always leave with a few and there were never any leftovers past the first day!

On top of the food being delicious, the service was always on point. Even when my brother and I took our mom there for Mother's Day and they were super busy, the service was great and quick.

True story: A piece of Black Forest Cake lasted me 5 days. I ate it every morning for breakfast with plain coffee. Kept it in the fridge in the box, covered by a plastic bag with a loosely tied knot. Works perfectly to keep the cake moist. Really good cake, not too sweet; but again it's sugar.

Tried knish for the first time. My best description is they look like food stuffed donuts with a thinner dryer dough. Favored the spinach stuffed one much better. I find it heavy, so eating half made me full. I liked it!

But guess what? You know how you go to the store to get one thing and end up with more than you intended? It may happen to you at this cafe. It totally happened to me, dang. I only meant to try their cannolis. Then I saw the humongous black and white cookie, tiramisu, all sorts of cakes...

First, parking seems to be at a premium at this location.  Good luck finding parking.  

Second, it  took us about 5 minutes to be acknowledged / seated.  They were busy but it was acceptable.  What stood out to me here was how irritated the older folks behind me were getting.

Third, the service - like I said it was busy. Extremely busy.  We did get our drink orders in and our actual orders in quickly after we put our menus down.

Fourth, the food!  The food came out after a 15 minute wait.  My wife ordered the multi-grain pancakes which were HUGE!  I ordered the colorado Omlet with a Raisin Bagel w/ Raisin Cream Cheese.  

My wife's multi-grain pancakes smelled AWESOME!  They even tasted very good.  ;)

My Colorado omelet, which consisted of Bell Peppers, Cheese and ham was just ""meh.""  It was dry and kind of cold by the time I got it.  Nothing to write home about.  What did redeem the meal was the bagel.  Very good!

3270463,2016-04-28,0,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"I really felt like I was walking into a bagel shop/bakery in New York City.  I was blown away by the selections when I walked into this place.  I don't know what was more impressive... the selection of bagels, the bakery selections with cakes and cookies, or the deli counter with all the authentic meats, fish, and condiments.  And that was just on the selection of items to go.  My suggestion is if you're coming here to eat, come at an ""off"" time.  One of the drawbacks is the parking and the parking lot.  It is in a strip center in which they have parking marked for designated businesses, so be careful where you park.  The other thing is I got there about 11:15 this morning.  And I got here just in time.  The parking area filled up fast, and so did the dining room.  And when I was leaving, there were people circling around trying to find parking spots.  The lady who took my spot, gave me just enough room to let me get out, before she started pulling in.  I took a seat at the counter, because there were only two available tables, and they were for four people, so I didn't want to take up a table for four (although other people alone were).  My server was a very nice young lady, who was very fast .  I ordered an Egg Bagel and a Sun-Dried Tomato Bagel, both with plain cream cheese and a small Black & White Cookie.  It took about ten minutes to get my order, which was fine given how busy they were.  Now, the other big drawback was that the bagels come in single baskets and the cream cheese is on the side.  Trying to spread the cream cheese on to the bagels, while in baskets is a chore, without making a mess.  I would prefer my cream cheese be already on the bagels.  If people want it on the side, they can ask for it that way.  Now, if you've ever been to New York, there are two things you will never get better anywhere else... pizza and bagels.  It's something in the water there that makes both of those things turn out so good.  However, these were the closest bagels I've ever had to real NYC bagels.  They were chewy with a little give, and the cream cheese was whipped perfectly with a great taste.  I enjoyed them both.  The Black & White Cookie was the best I've ever had!  It definitely made the meal complete.  I also had a glass of their Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice, which was awesome.  It was $14 for all of that, which I think was a pretty good deal.  I look forward to eating one of their over-stuffed deli sandwiches next time I go in there.  They looked awesome!   Also want to try their Potato Pancakes!

But the only disappointment was the size of the sandwich. I actually toyed with the idea of getting a half ... a common practice at the finer NYC delis. And by the look of the picture in the menu, a half just may have worked so long as you settle for accompaniments like fries, potato salad, slaw, etc. So glad I went for the whole. C'mon Bagel Cafe, if you want to compete with your eastern counterparts, you're gonna have to put some more meat on those sandwich bones. The rye was very good, and an excellent pickle, but please do something about acquiring a house deli mustard. As for the bagels. What can I say. When it comes to bagels, size matters, but not the overriding determinant in quality. While they were big enough, they were way too dense and somewhat lacking in flavor. Yeah, I know, I know. Having grown up in the streets of Manhattan, I am way too spoiled to make comparisons. Maybe one day, I'll find a LV bagel that can compete with that of my alma mater.

The corned beef was very good but not fatty enough for my liking. The pickle eh. The matzo ball soup was quite good - very hearty. I thought the bagel greatly underwhelmed as the place is called Bagel Cafe. 

For $11 a meal the price seems high. Yes there's a lot of meat but honestly it's not as much as you'd expect for the price. Usually they are stacked double high (maybe $3-4 more but worthy of two meals). I was full but there was definitely not enough for a second meal.

Just let me spell it out right now, my breakfast was edible. I can't even remember what I had. Typical and boring. My bagel and cream cheese were edible too.

Why 4-star? Well, let me tell you the story...

While we were waiting, I had a chance to glance at the dessert and pastry sections. I don't have a sweet tooth. So the selection was just yawning. And against my religion, they were twice the price than those in southern CA.

Why 4-star?

Well, I spotted the sugar free apple and regular peach pies. They were heavy and delicious looking. So I bought one each on the impulse. After I tasted it later, the flavor were GOOD, but it's too mushy underneath. I had to ""bake"" it upside down and inside out, to firm up the texture.

Well, that's not a 4-star experience. You're right. There are more to it...

While I was biting my breakfast item, I saw this bread with the corner of my eyes. This pile of breads was sitting on top of the shelf hiding behind the row of tall metal trays of baked carb. Memory flashback....

I had munched on freshly baked ambrosia tasting bread cooked by a friend in a ranch just half a year ago. It was good not just when it came fresh out of the oven, but as good when it was French toasted in thick slice on a grill.

The bread was challah and it was braided. So I bought one large loaf on the impulse. $5. That's the 2nd time in one day in one restaurant. And it was good and delicious.

So diners, I bet the items on the menu were good. That's why the restaurant was busy. My eyes were really set on the Challah.",P-CRYltpvp4aABRctIZWtg,0,0,4,pKgt5JIljpHmwvYfs-v_5Q

We came here because a friend wanted to go and it was in my list of places to come check out! :D 

So really quickly it's a bakery/deli and a restaurant/cafe. They seem to get pretty busy on the weekends, seating for smaller parties went by faster than for our large party (typical). Oh! You also need to make sure your whole party is present or they won't seat you. 

So I ended up with an Asiago bagel with jalapeno cream cheese and biscuits and gravy! I couldn't decide on what I wanted so I settled and thought, ""you can't go wrong with biscuits and gravy."" Yeah......nope! My bagel was much more appealing in taste than the biscuits and gravy. So a complete major disappointment in that. I liked the gravy but it could have used a little more flavor, there were large chunks of sausage in it which I think they could have cut up a little bit more. I like my biscuits in gravy with a LOT of gravy, like my biscuits need to be covered. I ran out of gravy before I ran out of biscuit, so it's a little disappointing to me. The bagel was good though!! I enjoyed getting chunks of jalapeno in my cream cheese :D 

Service wise - well it was alright. They were busy and we also had a decent size party so it's difficult, won't give them too much of a hackle for that.

Everyone seems to brunch here on the weekends, so the wait can be up to 20 minutes. Not a problem, because staring at the dessert case is the best form of entertainment.

My boyfriend and I were seated at the very back of the restaurant, which I don't believe is ideal. I felt like we were left there and forgotten about until staff members came by to ask if they could take our extra chairs, and if they could use our table to hold dirty dishes for a few moments. I didn't mind at first, but this happened several times.

We were both first-time diners, so we didn't know that the menus were the newspapers shoved in between the condiments and the wall. I ordered the spinach and feta omelette with a side of whole wheat toast and a medley of fruit. Water from the feta leaked out from inside the omelette. 

Our waitress forgot our corned beef hash, which we looked forward to trying. She took note of our order once again, and disappeared only to return 20 minutes later with our check.

I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!

As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered ""One Egg any style W/Bacon"" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The ""Asiago"" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me ""oh did you want bacon?"" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,45,28,1,jPwZiYJmqbycO_qkbVn3Bw

I am a relatively new customer of theirs and the following are my impressions after about 3 visits. 

 Doesn't get better in Las Vegas . Grew up in NY and have struggled to find a good deli / bagel place . This by far and away is the closest to NY. They have takeout for most things sold which includes deli / bakery /bagel items. They also have a sit down restaurant which is great.  Breakfast items I have tried have all been excellent .  Standouts are the Corn beef hash , two styles of knish (3 are stuffed one is NY style )  Bagel sandwiches are fantastic. Looking around the dining room will only make you have ordering remorse as you see the awesome selections other people have ordered. The menu is very large offering many traditional Jewish dishes which are staples in NY  and traditional american breakfast plates . 
The one thing that truly stood out is the service. I have gone to 5 star restaurants and have spent more than a mortgage payment on meals that included sommeliers and waiters with assigned assistants, and not received anywhere close to the service and unbelievable upbeat  attitudes as the staff there.  
So from bagels with numerous cream cheese options , to the diet killing bakery counter with things like cannoli , black and white cookies , rainbow cookies , gourmet muffins etc etc to the NY deli staple the classic (bagel) breakfast egg sandwich , this place has it all .   

minor cons not worth even bumping them from a strong 5 star review. 

#1 Take-out does not have a large menu posted  to know whats available at the takeout window when ordering. 

#2 (I'm sure they have heard this a thousand times) The parking lot is tight and cramped . Be on your toes and bring along a little extra patience . its worth the minor inconvenience . 

#3 No chocolate-milk in the bottled  beverage cooler. I think in NY its is part of the licensing agreement for anyone selling bagels to have it on hand. I guess not in Las Vegas. 

#4 it can get crowded on the weekends. It has been around fore a long time. keep in mind there is a reason people will wait 20-30 minutes.  Early bird rules apply .",u0BlOSWk9IEl2S98L4N5EA,2,1,5,vSUEEiZJTC5qCX5fAcCPog

The Matzo Ball Soup was very good, and my bagel was as I imagined-nicely toasted and chewy like a NY bagel. The Nova spread was pretty bomb too. The Potato Pancake was simple, straightforward, and delicious. Something in the flavor of the Knish was kinda foreign to me, and after 2-3 bites, I was done with that...At least I didn't knock it before I tried it! Wifey also failed to read that the soup came with a bagel, so she chose a Cinnamon-Raisin Bagel with cinnamon-raisin cream cheese which we enjoyed. The French Toast arrived and this plate looked like it came from Hash House A Go-Go!?

Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better IMO....all I could taste was egg, egg, and more egg. The challah wasn't soaked enough either. A little cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla extract does wonders! Overall, it was a great first visit. Tasty food, great service, and a great local spot to start your morning....ALOHA!!!

They are more than a cut above what you can get from your local supermarket or Einstein's Bagels or some such thing. They are doughy and delicious, and come with fresh ingredients to accompany, such as lox, cream cheese, and whatever else you want that is kosher. The desserts are very strong, too.

I came to The Bagel Cafe dozens of times when I lived in Vegas and especially when I worked in the same business complex this restaurant is part of on Buffalo, right off of the freeway.  I visited recently while on a trip and it is the same amazing place.  Voted 13 years now for Best Breakfast by readers of the Las Vegas Review Journal, this cafe with fresh bread, bagels, pastries, desserts, a deli and serving lunch too is a real gem.  

My fave bagel was the pumpernickel and they still make it.  Damn it is good.

I love the spinach and feta omelet.  The cannolis are superb, the real deal, and they are huge.  I recommend the latkes, eggs benedict, and chopped potatoes.  The chopped potatoes have this tomato zing to them that is just right on the dot.  

For lunch, get a sandwich that will have enough meat on it to feed three firemen.  Try the corned beef.  Yummy!  Salads are great too and yes, my friend, they come with a bagel and cream cheese.  If you can't eat it all, take that bagel home for a snack later because you can't waste heaven.

When it's warm and sunny, there's outdoor seating which makes the situation even better.

You can order ahead for carryout or go to the counter to your right upon entering to get your bread, dessert, sliced Boar's Head or anything else they offer to go. They also offer catering.

Portions are nice and big.  I couldn't finish my omelet but I shoved it in because you can't waste food like this.  I took the rest of my bagel to go.  Oh man are the bagels the best.  And big.

Get some kind of dessert and take it to go if you're going to explode.  You won't be disappointed. You've got the black and white cookie, hamentashen, Mexican wedding, and holy mother, they even make cheesecake the right way - the NY way.

There's never been an issue with service here.  A little blunt when they have a line out the door for people paying their tab but not at all rude, just busy.  

You get your choice of the bread you want when you order breakfast, which is served all day.

A taste of New York in Vegas.  Don't miss this.  

Parking stinks because the cafe is in a business park that lacks parking to begin with and it super busy due to the popularity.  It's worth dealing with it though.  

The atmosphere is that of a deli.  Simple but good tables and chairs with a NYC skyline painted on one wall and everything's clean. It gets pretty noisy when they are busy which is to be expected.  You may have to wait 30  minutes for a table; they don't take reservations, this is a casual restaurant.  However, it's worth the wait and service is fast.

I would not bring kids here simply because of how big the portions are and really, the food is just so amazing it would be wasted on a kid's palate.  It is family friendly though so I'm probably just being a snob. ;)

The service was weird. There was no greeting when we walked in. We stood by the ""Please wait to be seated"" sign awkwardly until the cashier told us 3 minutes later to seat ourselves. Look, the sign told me otherwise, how was I supposed to know what to do?

Once we sat down, we waited for someone to take our drink orders and to give us menus. Took us a second to realize they have those crappy newspaper menus like Egg Works on the condiment stand. Invest in regular menus please.

Yum! Now that I have been reminded what a delicious cheesecake this is, I feel I have the strength to write the rest of this review. My friend and I got the strawberry cheesecake for our late-night Netflix girltime dessert fancies, and bagels and cream cheese for the next morning's airport run shenanigans. 

I tend to like a more dense, fatty, hilariously-bad-for-you cheesecake, but this one is light and airy and is a-okay for me. The fruit on top is good, but I don't like the red-40 laced syrup they drizzle on top of it. Next time I'll just get the plain because it's a good cheesecake overall.

However, the real winners here are the namesake of the Cafe--the bagelssssss. I got spinach and feta, my friend got the egg bagel with everything on it. Both were good, though after spending the night in the fridge, were nearly impossible to cut. I eventually got them both in the toaster and gobbled all those carbs at 7am (which led me to sleepy time for most of the rest of the day).

Truthfully, whenever I think about bagels I would think about Einsteins and didn't have the desire to stop by. However, my sisters (fellow Yelpers) and I decided to try this place out since its been bookmarked in our Yelp all for a long time. 

From the moment you step into this place, your transported back east to New York. The cafe set up is straightforward with a large dinning room on one side and a bakery/deli on one side for takeout. There is a constant flow of people coming in and leaving. It's apparent by the many awards and celebrity photos with autographs that this cafe is very popular.

We ended up sitting in the dinning room and ordered 3 different omelette, lol. A cool thing about the omelette dish, it came with a choice of a side item. We all opted for the homestyle fries and was very pleased with the flavor and consistency of the seasoned potatoes (highly recommended). Each dish came with a Bagel and Cream Cheese of your choice, which was unexpected since our omelettes dishes were very sizable in portion. We ended up getting a plain, everything and asiago bagel. All the bagels were fresh and delicious with no compliant, just prepare yourself for a carb craze meal. The 3 omelettes we got were the Mushroom and Cheese, Veggie and Spinach and Feta Cheese, which was our favorite but they were all good. Overall we had a great experience and our server Kayla was good and knowledgeable about everything including the history of The Bagel Cafe. We will come back to try out more of their delicious food!

I called to complain and the rude manager didn't care.. kept saying the lox I ordered is the salty one... didn't even acknowledge that I told him everything on the platter was salty even the olives and tomatoes, didn't acknowledge that I mentioned that I ordered less than a week ago and no excuse for the inconsistency.. he was so rude and didn't care one bit! NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM HERE. I'll take my business elsewhere. Zero stars! We would have been regulars if their was consistency in their food and decent customer service when a problem arises. Gross!!!

After reading restaurants reply below: Again, I explained to the manager that I ordered the SAME EXACT PLATTER twice in a week & have receipts on grub hub showing identical order, I ever offered to show them...yet you cannot even acknowledge the severe inconsistency in your foods from one day to the next instead you insult me and say I used profanity and blame me for the item I ordered . Yes, I ordered the belly lox, both times...so in that case why was the first platter not salty? Horrible customer service any other establishment would have refunded or sent new item! Unacceptable gross place never again will I eat here I'll send my business elsewhere 

I did give him a chance to fix the issue by Calling and he didn't do a thing. Waste of time and money

My boyfriend and I finally came in on a Sunday morning and it was packed! I was so sad because I was starving and anxious for some delicious food. The wait was only about 15-20 minutes and we got to stare at all of the delicious-looking pastries in the mean time.

After being seated, we browsed through the menu (which looks like a newspaper) and it was pretty hard for us to make up our mind. My boyfriend decided to get the chicken-fried steak with eggs, potatoes, and a super egg onion bagel while I got the mushroom and cheese omelet with potatoes and a jalapeño cheese bagel. 

His chicken-fried steak was delicious, he said, and the bagel was SO good. I definitely should have ordered that bagel instead because I felt that the jalapeño-cheddar bagel was lacking in flavor. It was still good, especially with their amazing cream cheese on the side, just not super flavorful.

My mushroom and cheese omelet was pretty good, cheesy and mushroomy like you'd expect. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was literally the best orange juice I've ever had in my life. No exaggeration there. It was delicious. 

The service was quick and super friendly! After we ate, even though I was so full that I was bursting at the seams, we went to go get pastries. We splurged. We got raspberry, coconut lemon, blueberry, and apple cinnamon rugalach as well as a ""mini"" eclaire, chocolate dipped macaroon, chocolate dipped Florentine, and raspberry linzer tart. We devoured all of those within 2 days of going there. No regrets... Besides not buying the coconut cream cake and almond horseshoe but we're saving those for next time! :D coming back soon!!",giZgTnDxds-FQLi7nBxsBA,1,1,5,M8yuoLueOd7Ee5HzhyUT2w

They offer the closest thing to New York bagels that I have found in LV.  Both their breakfast and lunch menus have so many delectable choices that remind me of the East Coast.  The line for a table is almost always long, but worth the wait. They also have limited counter seating.

Recently,  I have enjoyed the Matzo Ball Soup, which is chock full of large pieces of carrot, celery, onion, and chicken in addition to a fluffy matzo ball.  A cure for what ails you (or just a tasty soup).  The chicken salad platter- a large scoop of chicken salad, two sides, pickle spears and veggies to make a sandwich with your bread or bagel choice.  The chicken salad is what I would call 'traditional style', no fruit, nuts, or other surprise items mixed with the chicken and celery.

On recent breakfast trips, we've enjoyed the fantastic Potato Pancake with applesauce and sour cream.  Definitely a welcome reminder of Jewish delis back home.  A huge portion of biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon and some of their omelets.  

We always seem to walk out with a bag from their bakery case too. Not sure how this keeps happening. ;-)  We freeze most of the bagels and they taste just as good after we take them out.

Stopped in for a dozen after lunch. Yes I understand it's Sunday but coming from NY I still can't believe that if a place runs out of certain flavors they don't make more. Surprisingly you had pumpernickel. Too bad you gave me a shortchanged dozen everything bagels (I ordered 2). Not surprised. I should know by now that the guys behind the counter can't count. Even if you tell them how many of each bagel. Always short 1 or 3. 


So now I really & truly am done with you. No more messed up orders. No more low quality food. No more e-coli from your undercooked frozen burger patties. No more crappy service. No more surly attitudes from counter guys. No more pathetic excuses for a manager.

*Previous Review

I've been going to Bagel Cafe for 18 years since moving to Vegas from NY. We don't have many choices for Jewish deli here and this place has outlasted any and all competition that have opened. On average we would eat Bagel Cafe once a week until about 10 years ago. From then until last year I was taking the kids once a month & doing take-out once a month. Once in a blue moon they might have an off day. Silly things like wilted lettuce or fries that weren't crispy. The bagels and bialys were always perfect. One time they served me an obviously microwaved knish. Hot and mushy on the outside and frozen in the middle.

Recently consistency has become a huge problem. One day the food is perfect and the next not so much.

Last year while dining in the restaurant my son and I both ordered cheeseburgers, well done. Mine was raw in the center. I put everything on my burger, including the fries so I didn't notice until after I bit, chewed and swallowed & thought to myself 'that didn't taste right.' I looked and I kid you not it was raw in the center. Fortunately my son's burger was well done. I had a lovely 2 week bout with e-coli & didn't eat there for almost a year. I also didn't eat a cheeseburger again for almost a year. I didn't hold them 100% responsible as I could have cut my burger in half to check that it was cooked through. Because everyone does that. Right? But seriously though, I cook every day. Sometimes a burger or steak isn't as done as the other ones. It happens. But it isn't rocket science to push on a steak or burger to check if it's done. There is a big difference in feel between raw and well done.

One day the kids were just dying for Bagel Cafe so I took them. I ordered a cobb salad, one kid got a bagel and the other of course ordered a cheeseburger, well done. When he saw my salad he decided that we would share. Fortunately this time I cut the burger in half and it was raw. Now this indicates to me that the 'chefs' don't know what they are doing or the burgers are frozen patties. The manager removed the burger from my bill.

Today we ordered take-out. Very simple order. 1 pastrami & 2 NY knishes. Simplest thing for a deli, well in NY at least. Also I should note that I was asked if I wanted cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion on that. Drove home with the moon roof open & the hot Vegas sun on the bag. Funny thing, the sandwich was cold & the knishes were ice cold. Okay, fine. Threw the knishes in the oven. Attacked the sandwich. Now I know it's pastrami and it's fatty but it should be meat with fat on it. About 1/3 of the sandwich was sliced fat with meat on it. Couldn't even chew it. So apparently now they do not know how to cut the pastrami.

The icing on the cake: They shortchanged me on my dozen bagels. By two. Seriously, now you guys can't count?!?

I'm just done. Good bye Bagel Cafe. If I want deli I'll take a flight back home and go to Katz. It would be worth the time and money for a decent sandwich and a knish that hasn't been nuked.",XrqZGI4De9w6etHI46AYPg,2,0,1,1E94aun3RQ6QOEP_-2g60g

The Bagel Cafe is probably one of the only places in Las Vegas that comes close to being an authentic NY type deli eatery.  Must be, because this place is constantly packed full of folks!  East coast natives abound, I hear that 'Noo Yawkeh' accent on every other table!  Works for me!  As long as the food is good.

For what it's worth, The Bagel Cafe doesn't disappoint.  Matzo ball soup?  Get outa hea!  Bagels and lox?  Ahrite ahready!  Hand-cut deli sandwich with pickles?  Fawget aboutit!  All represented here plus much more!  I can't believe I've lived here so long and within a 10 minute drive from this place, should've been here sooner to eat!  Now we will probably visit on a monthly basis whenever the need comes for a big @$$ deli sandwich.

The Bagel Cafe is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on most days, but you will see that breakfast and lunch are their busiest times.  Want to eat there on the weekend for brunch?  Be careful of the time, the wait can be a bit long!  But if you're looking for good deli eats, the wait is worth it.  They're friendly, but they work quick!  You gotta be on your toes.  Don't give an attitude, because you just might get one back!  These New Yorkers don't take no $hi+!  Keep that in mind and you'll be fine.

The breakfast/lunch crowd is gigantic but there are a lot of open spaces, except for maybe ONE.  Word is power couple Mayor Goodman and former mayor...ahem...Mayor Goodman, frequent The Bagel Cafe often and even have their own empty table waiting for them.  They must really like the place to have their own little spot!  Lucky.  Guess the rest of us non-mayors just have to wait like everyone else.

Food overall looks delicious though and many reviews confirm this.  Pancakes and challah French toast are huge.  Potato pancakes and Eggs Benedict look fresh and hearty.  Omelets, damn they are pretty good in size.  As much as I love breakfast though, I go straight for the deli sandwiches.  Go big or go home!  Most sandwiches come in either the 1/4 pound size (for you little babies), or 1/2 pound size (for us big babies).  They all come with pickles, and your choice of potato salad, macaroni salad, pasta salad, coleslaw, or chips.  Some good eats-a-comin'!

I enjoy building my own sandwich, and often end up with a 1/2 pound behemoth of corned beef and pastrami on rye.  No wheat for me folks!  Give me that sucker, spread on some yellow mustard or the house brown mustard, and I'm ready to go!  I'll pound that 1/2 pound till she is no more!  Luckily there's not too much bread to get in your way of succulent meat.  The Thurmann's meats they use at The Bagel Cafe are of great quality, the seasoning for me on the corned beef and pastrami are just right.  Bright, briny, and peppery.  Damn delicious.

Now, sandwiches are not allowed to be shared at The Bagel Cafe (watch out they will charge you for sharing that), so they have a build your own sandwich platter made for TWO people (or one lucky piggy).  For the sandwich platter you get your choice of bread, choice of two sides, a slew of fresh pickled veggies, lettuce, tomato, onion, choice of cheese, and just over 1/2 pound of up to three deli meats!  Sandwich platter of epic proportions!  Last time around the wifey and I chose corned beef, pastrami, and roast beef.  Yep, we overdid it just a tad.  So much food!  Best part?  This platter comes in at under $20!  We had enough to feed the two of us, plus share a bunch of deli cuts with the kids!  You can choose whatever deli meats you like on the menu, I hear the roast turkey and the tongue (yes - unctuous beef tongue) are good choices as well.

The Bagel Cafe also does authentic deli dinners - classic choices like lamb shank, stuffed cabbage, liver and onions, and chopped steak.  I will have to be back for dinner one day!  For now, I am more than happy with a fatty deli sandwich.

If you can't dine in, The Bagel Cafe will gladly do take-out, they have a full service bakery and deli on the opposite side of the dining room.  Need a dozen bagels for home, or a large side of NY cheesecake?  All this can be had and more, no big wait.  

Get some chutzpah and bring your butts over here to The Bagel Cafe!  Don't be a friggin' putz!

I will be back!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,4,4,9n5RkVkwcYA2Ey1tckUJrQ

We ordered the Matzoh Ball Soup and a Corned Beef Reuben. Both were very delicious. Reuben was a very nice portion compared to most places in town. Corned beef was flavorful and lean. Only downfall was they wouldn't let us upgrade to a small salad in lieu of the mac salad for a small price. Also, the server told us we couldn't order more broth for our leftover soup to go. Said we had to order another cup of soup?!? Ended up charging us for a bowl to go and only brought us a cup portion. Just charge us a couple bucks for some more broth and be done with it.

They have a good variety of bagels, I usually get an asiago or cheddar jalepeno bagel.   I also picked up at least 2 items from the pastry side also.   At least 2 pieces of the rainbow cookie ( which is more of cake bites than cookie) and either rice pudding,  black & white cookie or maybe a roll.   When you order these to go, the LG cookie and Cinnamon roll is big enough to fill a lg take out container.  They are huge!

Located inside a business complex near the Buffalo freeway exit, the Bagel Cafe is a charming family owned breakfast joint that's been around for 20 years.  When you first walk in, you're instantly greeted by the glorious sight of bagels and homemade cream cheese that they have. You can also buy the bagels here separately too.  Came here on a Sunday morning around 8:15 am and was able to find a table no problem.  Here you seat yourself to an open table and a server will be by shortly to wait on you.  The servers who waited on us were attentive and friendly too.  The dining area itself is large and clean with two different sections. 

My friend and I ordered:
-Biscuits and Gravy ($7.95) - Wow I seriously was not expecting this dish to be so good!  The buttermilk biscuits were nice and fluffy, not dry at all like biscuits can tend to be sometimes.  At first glance the dish looks like they put wayyyy too much gravy on top, but Bagel Cafe clearly knows what they are doing and put the right amount on, not soggy at all.     
-2 oz. Smoked Fish Platter ($11.95) - I was a little scared that this wouldn't fill me up but I totally underestimated it!  Comes with fish of your choice, I picked the smoked salmon, and it also comes with tomato, red onion, cucumber, olives, and a bagel and cream cheese of your choice.  I got the everything bagel with plain cream cheese.  I loved this!  I also think compared to other lox bagels I've had this is about mid-range price...not the cheapest but not the most expensive either.   
-Side of Homefries ($2.95) - Tasty and seasoned pretty well but I did think this was a bit on the mushy side. 

My friend and I can't stop raving to each other about how good this place is.  Now that I know how awesome this place is I will definitely be back.  A great breakfast dining experience all around!",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,0,0,5,qJ_Bw__w5MQu21gb_4LJoQ

Although I've never been to the East coast I feel this place would fit right in!  I love all the freshly baked breads and desserts that they have.  I also love that you can order deli style or sit in the restaurant.  Now me and the bestie had decided to have brunch before starting our day.  When we arrived at the café at first I was like hmmmmm this looks like a business complex, which it was.  I was a bit envious of these people because they got to eat here everyday.  So we entered the café and were sat at a table quite quickly.  Surprisingly as busy as they were our drink order was taken very quickly.  We checked over the menu and anytime I come to a new place it's always hard for me to choose or go with favorites or with what the regulars get.  Because well you just never know. So anytime I want to gage a new place I always get something that is easy and simple.  I only do this because I want to see how a place makes the easiest thing on their menu.  So I got the typical everyday breakfast of bacon and eggs along with a bagel and cream cheese.  Let me tell you the food is amazing and the bagels are huge!  The bacon was just how I like it, nice and crispy and the eggs were wonderful.  Not runny or undercooked.  I really enjoyed my breakfast and without a doubt one of the best I've had.
Now onto the bakery!!!  Now I'm always a sucker for a good and delicious baked good and this café does not disappoint.  There are tons of items to choose from.  Now had I not had to travel on a plane I would have bought a few loaves of bread both regular and sweet and some cinnamon rolls, but unfortunately I don't trust my food to anyone else so maybe next time.  So I settled for a couple of Black & White cookies, which are my second favorite to chocolate chip.  Let me tell you those cookies didn't last till my trip home because I just couldn't.

So why is it that I am absolutely fine with paying that much at Bagel Cafe?  Because I got more than just one meal out of the food I ordered.  

I saw stuffed cabbage on the menu uder ""Starters"" so I thought I would start with that.  I also had made up my mind on a pastrami reuben.  Little did I know that the cabbage would come out the size of a small baby and be served with a whole bagel.  As soon as the cabbage came to my table I knew I was in trouble.  I joked with the waitress that I may need a to-go box before the day was over.  When she saw the glazed over look in my eyes when the sandwich came, she looked at me and said ""Yeah, you're gonna need a box.  Let me know when you're ready."" 

The cabbage was hands down the best I've ever had.  It was tender enough to eat with a spoon.  There was no choking down of tough cabbage leaves.  The sauce was tomato perfection.  The meatloaf within was formed well and held its shape better than mama can make it do.  I could have and perhaps even should have made a meal of just the cabbage.  But no, I had to get the sandwich too.

 The sandwich was what I have been searching for in Las Vegas for years.  Pastrami stacked higher than my mouth will allow in and covered in gooey melty cheese, soaked with dressing and topped with crunchy and mild sauerkraut.  It was a magnificant sight to behold.  The battered fries, macaroni salad and pickle spear on the plate all added to the feast.  

At the time of my surrender I had eaten half of the cabbage, half of the bagel, half of my reuben, the macaroni salad and a few fries.  I thought I might need a wheel chair to roll my fat butt back to the car.  With my leftovers I ended up with no less than two more meals.  One meal was the remainder of the cabbage and bagel.  The other was the reuben and fries for lunch the following day.  With that, my $26 meal soon turned into three and, at a more resonable $8 and change per, was easier to justify.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,5,3,4,6-HLVYTNfJMTwDNyqNlpQQ

I asked for it to be wiped down politely and was told that they are not supposed to wipe the chairs (huh?).  I totally didn't get that so questioned it and she said it isn't good for the seats and that ""it is only crumbs"" and then wiped it.  Seriously- for the prices of food here, one is entitled to sit on a clean chair and not in someone else's mess.

There aren't many superb salt bagels, I'm talking the good ones with the white granules all over the bagel - not the combination - but the fresh white salt granules! Yum!  This place has it amongst 20 other types of bagels.  There are also a myriad of cream cheeses, some beyond the norm which was a nice option! 

Muffins and danishes were fresh and delicious - according to the hubby, he is a fan as well.  Their baked goods and bagels are definitely fresh - no question - and soft! 

They are not cheap - we paid $14 for 4 bagels with cream cheese on 3 and butter on one.  I believe there is a ""cut/slice"" fee as well.  However, if you are in the mood for a good, damn good bagel, you will find it here! 

Service - we stood in front of the ""order here"" sign for a good 8 minutes before being acknowledged.  There were at least 4 people walking around behind the counter, but I guess we were invisible?

You had me at Hamentashen! 
But you left me at the booth by the window with a mouth full of Meh.

SERVICE:
Counter help (women) are not very cordial and seem disinterested in helping or answering questions.
Stood there for a while as they just ignored me making their own coffee and being snobby. This is a service business; shouldn't you make people feel comfortable when they come through the door? And it wasn't just the way we were treated. Watched as other patrons got similar cold attitude. IMHO

Deli counter staff (men) are nice, helpful  and engaged. 

One waitress - over worked...but cordial. 

FOOD / BAGELS : GENERALLY GREAT
Coffee is good.
Bagels are great.
Lots of Cream cheese options and things to put with Bagels abound.
There is an emphasis on real traditional Jewish food which I really appreciate finding in LV! But although the Bagel Cafe has a niche market and offers loads of variety.....

FOOD/ OTHER:
Ordered a feta spinach omelet. It came with a glob of feta in one spot. Feta was sour, melted, not Greek- style. Too much grease or butter used in cooking. 

Muffins are large, lovely, but oddly lacking in flavor.

Took some other pastries home and found them OK, none are ""wonderful""- taste is rather bland - not exciting in the mouth.
Eating a bite of cranberry muffin as I write...chew, swallow, try it once more, Nope, still Meh! 

Overall, not sure we'd eat here again. 

Might get bagels and cream cheese to go.

Holy cow do they have a ton of selections! The bakery alone is something to rejoiced about. Most importantly they carry black and white cookies!!! As a former New Yorker black and white cookies bring back some fond memories. I have not found one place here in Las Vegas that carries them. The same goes for Knishes! I didnt buy them this trip but I have every intention to do so at my next. Again Knishes are one of those that brings back some happy memories and I can never find here in Vegas.

Food = 3 stars
Whenever someone tells me this taste just like New York something, I get a little suspcious. Nothing taste like New York anything unless you're in New York, simply put its the water! Bagels are boiled in water, its the water. So, having read reviews and many new yorker transplant raving about the bagels I knew I had to try it. My thoughts? I'm okay with it. It doesn't have that chewiness of the NYC bagel. Its missing this je ne sais quoi. Is it bad? No its delicopis, but its not exciting me and making me dance. I also got the matza ball soup, okay that was good! Can we say hugs the soul? The mataz balls are light and fluffy and savory. Lastly the white and black cookie, it taste like a cake! The frosting was good, but the cookie itself needed maybe 3 minutes more in the oven.

Today I went for lunch. I ordered half a sandwich with the soup de jour - cabbage with tuna salad on toasted sourdough. 

I expected Cabbage soup like the diet type. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived it was a rich, thick, tomatoey broth, ground beef, and shredded cabbage. The cabbage was tender but still firm enough to have a great texture. It was flavorful. In my own personal opinion, it was just a little too sweet. Sugar offsets the acidity of the tomato base and it is strictly personal preference.

The tuna salad sandwich was, of course, stacked high and offered with lettuce tomato and onion. I ordered it with just lettuce and it came with a huge green Romaine lettuce leaf on top of pleasantly chunky albacore tuna-perfectly toasted sourdough. It had the perfect amount of mayo and was seasoned mildly.

It was very busy in here as well so I had high hopes.  Let me start out by saying they have many choices for lunch which looked great.  The hot dog with Chili, Cheese and Onion spoke to me so I ordered that and it comes with French fries as well as a choice of Macaroni salad, potato salad or cucumber salad.  My husband got the Pastrami sandwich on Rye, which looks huge on the menu.  

Our food took about 25 minutes to get (something that is listed on the menu that I overlooked when ordering), unfortunately when it arrived I was highly disappointed with the first bite that I took.  When you order a hot dog with Chili you expect a hot steaming hot dog and chili.  Mine was cold.  The cheese that was put on it was a torn up cheddar cheese slice that wasn't even melted so that means when they put the hot dog together it was luke warm or cold to start out with.  The only plus was the french fries were nice and hot and crispy.  The potato salad had no flavor and unfortunately the pickle that came with the plate was sub par and kinda gross.  

My husband received his pastrami and it was dry and not nearly as big as they advertise.  

When walking out we decided to go look at the desserts and the bagels.  They look amazing but this place is all about nickel and diming you.  The menu states no sharing, there is a split plate fee of $2.00.  Also, if you want to order a bagel and cream cheese make sure you ask for a whole one other wise it is a $1.00 charge to cut it for you.  

I don't see myself going back to this place, the food wasn't all that great and I don't like having  ""extra"" charges for things that should come as part of the service; ex: slicing a bagel so I can eat it at the table.",w4H9KbUATEpwMdWdEKlvpw,4,1,1,5o3cHBB7awvoB5o97PDJIg

Today was my first visit and will be the last!

We were at our table for more than 15 minutes before a ""bus girl"" with a bad attitude and no name tag walked over and said ""What do you want to drink?"" Not even a hello, welcome, etc. When she brought our drinks she spilled scalding hot coffee on the arm of someone at our table and not even an apology. Completely unbelievable!!

It was another 10+ minutes before our server came to take our order. Quite a long time when the restaurant wasn't even half full. From the time we walked in the door until our food was on our table was 55 minutes. Not acceptable.

I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs platter. It was just okay. I asked for over medium eggs and received soft poached. The fruit cup that was substituted instead of potatoes was 2 chunky pieces of pineapple and 2 chunky pieces of honeydew melon. The bagel and cream cheese was good. 

Overall I didn't think it was worth the total of $17.27 + tip.  I'll be happy NOT to spend my money there again.",-ApvB2uyNYkLCvSfwgLF7g,0,0,2,BwmVHVG1_AkcjGk-xBW3Sw

Now I was highly disappointed with the service, overall I felt I had to wait a little longer than you usually should.  First off, I don't think any restaurant should have a seat yourself option.  Unless you are ordering from the cashier service yourself and then seating yourself, this should never EVER be an option.  It took about 20 minutes for our server to come and get our order, and it took another 30 mins for our food to come.  So overall, almost an hour to actually eat and order which is something I don't find lightly.  I think the girl near the bakery section felt bad for us so she came and got our order, which I found nice of her.  

Aside from the clustered and noisy ambience, the food was ok.  My boyfriend and I ordered the crab eggs benedict, french toast, and the biscuits and gravy with a side of eggs and sausage.  

The crabs benedict was good, I think I got way too much meat I didn't even find the bread at the bottom of it.  The flavors were all there though.  I wasn't too fond of the potatoes, I thought it was mushy and to weird of a spice for me. 

The french toast was good, a little thick cut and huge but I understand the big serving idea.  I think I needed a little more syrup instead of the small side they gave me.  The bread was really thick, I think more syrupy sweets would do it justice.

The biscuits and gravy was ok, personally I thought it was too light.  I actually like the biscuits and gravy from south point which is rather odd.  But I thought they had more flavor.  

Overall this place was ok, I don't think I'll be returning soon because of that clustered feeling.  On top of that I paid $43.00 for everything which I thought was little too pricey.  I could've gone to egg works and paid less than that, but hey that's just me.",0guV-tXB82pi2stV7a5g5Q,6,0,3,9-zKsfrD3DwxcyHvUCuO5A

4365197,2013-12-04,3,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"Okay, I judge a Kosher style deli by their Matzo Ball soup. A REAL and proper way to cook the broth is with a chicken carcass, sauté some onions, chop up a couple of stalks of celery and several quartered carrots. This is the traditional way a broth for Matzo balls is made. NOT with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. When done, it should be a clear broth with just the carrots and celery floating around. Maybe in a pinch some dill thrown in for measure.
Real Matzo Balls are made with a binder of schmalz (rendered chicken fat for you goyim out there). 
I found the entire bowl to be uninspiring, with tasteless Matzo balls, and with all sorts of flotsam floating in the bowl.
Remember: this is NOT a diet food, which brings me to the corned beef....
Corned beef should be served with a thick layer of fat on it....this is where all the flavor is, and is once again..NOT a diet food. If you don't like the fat simply remove it from your sandwich. 
I don't care for their practice of cutting it all off prior to reaching my table! If I was concerned about the saturated fats I wouldn't be eating any of this in the first place.

I have even gone as far as requesting a lot of extra fat, and it always comes to my table, trimmed and tasteless.
Without this rich flavor it changes from Corned beef to peppered beef. Completely altering the taste and drying the meat out.

I know most everybody being so health conscious these days would disagree with me, but for old die hards like me the old fashioned way, really is the best.

If I want decent corned beef from now on, I'll make my own.

You really cannot find an authentic place in this town, and having lived here for years, I speak from experience.

I'm from Connecticut, so I used to take the train to NYC often. That being said, I know a good bagel! I have been trying to hunt down the perfect bagel here in Vegas for a while now and I think this is it. 

First off, i'd like to state that this place is a hidden gem. LITERALLY. It took us about 5 minutes to hunt it down in the parking lot! (Hint, its to the left of the Omelet House!)

They serve fresh bagels in different flavors, but me being a ""plain jane"" type I stick to plain. They also have different cream cheese flavors like plain, scallion, strawberry, veggie, etc. 
Again, i'm very plain jane so i get plain or scallion! They have different sandwiches and meats/cheeses but I have yet to try them! There's also a variety of cookies and even coffee cake (YUM!).

The place is never really busy (at least whenever i'm there) so we get our pick of tables to sit at. The wait isn't too long, maybe 5 minutes tops. I also think the staff is great here, very friendly and always have smiles on their faces. 

Now I don't know about you, but I LOVE cream cheese. These guys give you a hefty portion of cream cheese when serving you and I love it!!! My boyfriend is the complete opposite, he likes very, very, very light cream cheese. Craaazy right? 
Anyways, I appreciate a warm toasted bagel with lots of cream cheese-y goodness :)
I have also tried their breakfast sandwich and its soooo good! Perfect greasy egg goodness with cheese and bacon on a toasted bagel....YES! I recommend this place to everyone. It's my favorite bagel spot, and reminds me of home. :)",wD5cNaaNSyVorLtn0Dx_GA,1,1,5,nRGxSpe34oElgmIYt00ULg

Everything at The Bagel Cafe is great. The sandwiches are HUGE, and this is not a joke or understatement. When I order the brisket sandwich (YUM), I always have to pull half the meat off so I can fit the sandwich in my mouth - the tastiest of problems. Their bagels are really good, and their cream cheese options are even better - the cinnamon walnut raisin cream cheese is to die for. I even took my leftover cream cheese home once because it's that good. If you like garlic, I'd also recommend their garlicky breakfast options over in the deli area.

Their bakery/pastry foods are the stuff dreams are made of. I avoid the cookies as they are too crunchy for me, but the cannolis, ruggulahs, cakes, and the like are addictive. I bought and drove their baked goods four hours away to California to make a good impression on my future in-laws. It worked like a charm.

Bagel Cafe gets jammed up for breakfast/brunch on the weekends, but it's totally worth the wait and you'll easily understand why after eating there once. It's a little more expensive that somewhere like IHOP or a more casual sandwich place, but I still go when I can because it's delicious.

As far as entrees go, I think my hubby made a great choice with the pastrami sandwich. That meat was so flavorful and piled high!

I got a corned Beef and Cheddar omelette with potatoes and an everything bagel. The corned Beef was nothing compared to that pastrami and the omelette wasn't seasoned at all. But the potatoes were good and that bagel was perfect! Honestly, next time I would vote to create my own plate - everything bagel covered in cream cheese, butter and piled high with pastrami. 

I also had to try some sweets. I have to say that while the cannoli wasn't for me (the shell was very thick, crunchy and dry) I adored their gluten free chocolate chip cookie. I didn't buy it because of being gluten free, I bought it because it looked good. You see, I'm not a fan of shortbread-type cookies, so these looked more up my alley.

 Inside the dining area, the menu is listed on a nostalgic newspaper. I had the special listed on the white board: asparagus with goat cheese omelette with French Vanilla coffee. The eggs were right up my ally, light and fluffy, a sign that they were cooked low and slow. The asparagus was young and tender, chopped small resembling green onions, and the serving was generous. That, with creamy goat cheese, was a very satisfying dish. The toast was made from homemade wheat bread, thick and light. The bill was fifteen dollars... The quality of the food in relation to the price trumps the quantity, along with the wait (there is a disclaimer on the menu that your order can take 20 minutes.) The coffee was aromatic and flavorful. Service was standard, nothing to write home about. 

 I could not stop there, though, and had to take something home. The chicken pot pie looked too good to pass up. Reheated, the gravy was buttery and creamy, reminding me of a rich cream base you would find a clam chowder, just with chicken.

Lox & Bagel: The platter came with the smoked salmon, tomatoes, onion, capers, cream cheese, and bagel. Everything on the platter was excellent except for the bagel. It did not taste like a fresh made bagel. It was more like something from the store. It was not bad, but I was expecting better.

The potato knish and the potato pancake were very good. This was the first time I ever ate a knish. I would probably order it again.

Is the wait worth it? The food is not bad, but personally I only wait for amazing food. Another thing I did not like was their warning on the menu. The ask to please not to share the sandwich!!!! Come on!!! It bothers me a lot when restaurants tell you what to do, its not like I'm not paying for the product, it shouldn't be your concern what I do with my food! Good thing I dont like sandwiches but the warning is just annoying
I ordered the crab egg Benedict and it was too fishy for my taste. I know it sounds weird but I hate when my meal smells and tastes too fishy!  I had to opportunity to try the turkey sandwich and it was pretty fresh. However, the sandwich was not extraordinary!

4654945,2014-03-10,7,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"Born and raised in New York the warm and soft bagel is a part of my heritage. It seemed that I would have to board the Concorde if I was to have a New York bagel in a reasonable time. That was until I stepped foot in the Bagel Cafe.

  The Bagel Cafe is a slice of the Big Apple approximately ten miles northwest of NY-NY in the Summerlin community of Las Vegas. The four times that I have had breakfast here in very recent times, my mind literally left Vegas and entered a New York bagel restaurant. As soon as I stepped on line, displayed right to my left were Wise Potato chips. Wise Potato chips are a popular brand of potato chips that are extremely popular in New York, but sold in a few places in Vegas :( . When I looked to the right, standing out from the display cases of cookies were the rainbow cookies. Since leaving New York, I have rarely laid eyes on them in Las Vegas. The closest rainbow cookies that I have seen to Las Vegas were at Chompie's Deli in Phoenix. After being seated sitting in front of me was the warm and soft bagel. Three times, I ordered egg salad on a bagel and once a BLT on the warm and soft bagel. The quality was superb. The bagel sandwich was overflowing with egg salad that was topped off with lettuce, onions, and a tomato. The BLT was the antithesis of the pathetic BLT that I recently ordered at Panera Bread. It was overflowing with crunchy beacon. With each sandwich, I ordered potato salad and coffee. The coffee tasted just as good as the bagel shops that I remembered before Starbuck's came on the scene. In actuality, the coffee is just as good as Starbuck's.

  Just like New York, the Bagel Cafe is crowded. Parking is a challenge, and it is almost guaranteed that some walking is required. The Bagel Cafe is located in a professional park on the west side of Buffalo Drive south of the Summerlin Parkway. Unlike the New York City landmarks, it blends in with the professional buildings. On account of the parking lot being linear with the popularity of the Bagel Cafe, each time I had to walk the distance of two professional buildings (not complaining. I went here before hikes). On weekends, there was a wait. The Bagel Cafe is relatively large and the weekend waits were no longer than 15 minutes. On the other hand, it was less crowded on a Wednesday at 1 p.m., and the ""Please Wait to Be Seated"" sign was turned around to ""Please seat yourself.""

  The Bagel Cafe differentiates from the prices of the New York bagel shops that I know of in New York. Unless inflation at the New York Bagel shops went up in double digits, the Bagel Cafe prices seem steeply higher than those of the bagel shops that I remembered. From my experiences here, it is the Waitresses that can make and break the price. The first two times that I had my New York moments here, the sweet Waitress passed on a tip that if you order a sandwich on a bagel instead of bread (Did not come here for bread) that you get a full sandwich for the price of a half sandwich. Fast forward to the last two times, and the impersonal Waitress was charging me for the full sandwich (check with tip came to around $15). But what could I do?  It would still be far less expensive than flying in a Concorde to New York.

  If you grew up with the New York bagel, or are just a fan of it; I recommend the Bagel Cafe. On the four visits that I visited Bagel Cafe, I have made it a point to stop by on the way to a park. Admittedly I planned to hike in a nearby park a couple of those times with the excuse to check-in here. I am so confident that I will get in a mood for the New York Bagel. With that said, I see Bagel Cafe check-ins in my future.

****Please note that there are other establishments using the Bagel Cafe name or similar to it. The one in the Sun Coast I rated 2 stars.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,12,4,gWBOcpe7zk2-cRYkVS2mxg

The exterior had a nice crisp, but since the pancakes were so large and dense, the interior was not as pleasant in texture or flavor (imagine somewhat-cooked, mushy, grated potatoes with no seasoning). They looked more like burger patties than pancakes. The sour cream and apple sauce did not help.

Side of Homemade Corned Beef Hash ($6.95). Tasty with a decent crispiness. Definitely one of the better corned beef hash I've had in the valley, though not amazing.

Crab Cake Benedict with Lump Jumbo Crab ($15.95): The crab cake was good and the portion is very generous. Decent hollandaise. The home fries were just okay.

Combination Platter 2: two bagels, two cream cheeses, 9 oz. fish ($33.95). I chose Everything and Egg bagels, Scallion and Olive Pimento cream cheeses, and Nova, Lox, and Smoked Whitefish. Each of the Smoked Fish Platters come with tomato, red onion, cucumber, olives, pickles, and capers. The bagels are great. I got them lightly toasted (the best) and they had great taste and texture. The cream cheeses were also good and I really enjoyed these particular flavors. I did try a bit of the Garlic Cheddar and that one good, though I preferred the other two. The Nova and Lox were great, however, the Whitefish was not as smokey or tender as I'd like. Not a big loss for me since I'm more concerned about the salmon anyway. Lastly, I loved all the fixings! The pickles were great and all the vegetables were fresh and plentiful.

The food was a hit or miss for me. Though I enjoyed the Smoked Fish Platter, everything else was just all right. In addition, service was shoddy. Our server was very nice, however, she rarely came to check on us (we had to flag her or someone else down three times). We didn't receive a single water refill when we began to look around the restaurant and wondered if that was typical. It wasn't; other diners' cups were refilled moments after I saw them empty.

4869546,2010-06-19,0,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"So by now you know we eat out a lot.  We eat out with our kids at restaurants probably more than any other family in LV!!  Bagel Cafe is about a mile away, so it's been another stand-by...but not anymore.

First, their breakfast food and sandwiches are still great.  That's probably never going to change.  But we don't go there for dinner anymore like we used to.  Maybe you don't order a steak at a place called Bagel Cafe, but the last two times my wife wanted steak (while the kids wanted Matzoh Ball soup and stuffed cabbage!), the steak was nearly inedible - gristly, thin, not cooked evenly, and I would hate to see the expiration date on the meat, as it tasted pretty rancid.  I can almost picture a ""Gordon Ramsay discovers something disgusting"" Kitchen Nitemares moment, covering his mouth over a trash bin after a tirade of expletives.

Which brings me to my other HUGE gripe about Bagel Cafe....and it's not pleasant.  The bathrooms...are disgusting...'nuff said.  Maybe it's a result of the huge traffic they get for morning/brunch, and they simply can't stop to check/clean the bathrooms during the day??  There's no excuse for disgusting bathrooms at a restaurant, and probably no greater turn-off, not to mention the health issues.

Clearly, dinner is not their target meal, though they still list many great specials, at least the nights they're open past 5 p.m. (any day except Sun-Tue, I thnk).  To be fair, the traditional NY Deli type items are still great (yes, I too love tongue, liver, whitefish, and other hard-to-find deli sandwiches; knishes, etc.).  Bagel selection?  Fabulous.  The pastries still LOOK as good as ever, but sometimes, after 2-3 bites, I wish they were less sweet, less BIG, and tasted a little more 'special'.  Matzoh Ball soup?  Excellent, if you like the rich, thick, ultra-brothy variety that sometimes even have the layer of fat/oil floating on top.  Now I happen to like that, but today's finicky health-conscious 2010 diner may be immediately turned off....and watch out for the occasional bone shard! 

My last gripe about Bagel Cafe?  The tabletops are too small!  Maybe I have a sense of false entitlement for comfortable seating, but with the huge platter-size dishes (and additional plates for 'sides') they use, a 4-top with 4 people, even when 2 are kids, becomes a challenge in space planning and creative plate stacking.  OK, maybe this gets people in and out quicker...but I have to note this here as a legitimate complaint.  The booths are slightly roomier, but not much.  I feel like I'm sitting in the back row of a Southwest 737 with my seatback and traytable in their upright positions....

I wish I could be nicer to this place!  The servers are friendly and fun, and the kitchen staff often comes out and yuks it up with the clientele.  Maybe they oughta have someone also make rounds of the bathrooms, too...   All this adds up to my first 1-star rating...

Oh yeah...someone else mentioned the cashiers.  YES, I've had problems related to this also.  About 2 years ago, I saw triplicate charges coming through on my credit card about a month after dining here.  They resolved the problem by running credits through after the fact, but I had to bring it to their attention.  Also, if you watch your account like I do, you'll notice that they take FOREVER to clear your payment, which is always an indication that their internal controls and policies may be lacking.",xuSHcXE_3IXoRyg5LObSpA,2,0,1,BaVImHGNp2O0Y1nXWsL0KQ

The reason I give it only three stars is because every single time I go, they're out of something.  In an effort to not waste food, they only make a certain amount each day.  The problem with doing this is that they are always out of something, and they expect you to change your order to accommodate their currently available items.  I hate this, and it's really frustrating.  Last time I went, they were out of three items before I finally just left.

It is literally (not figuratively but in the very real sence) the best Matzoh Ball Soup I have ever tasted. They use both white and dark meat chicken (dark meat being where the flavor comes from) and are sparing in their use of white onions. Most soups with onions taste like onion soup with carrots and a tiny bit of chicken stock thrown in. Chicken is both the predominate flavor and ingredient. Spooning through it is like wading though a lake of chicken and flavor. It is divine.
I always order the bowel sized, it is good for two meals and comes with a bagel and the topping of your choice.  The spinach and feta bagel with the garlic-cheddar cream cheese is my favorite, but the jalapeno cheddar bagel/schmere is a close second.
And the pastry case! Cheesecake is the light and fluffy variety, I suspect they use mascarpone, and the fruit toppings are divine, rugelach, cookies, they even have ""spinach pie"" which I suspect is spanikopita but have yet to try because I always order the additively wonderful Matzoh Ball Soup.

Jessie and I looked over the menu. I knew that whatever I ordered I wanted a garlic bagel to be involved. Bagel Cafe's menu is huge and everything is tasty. After much back and forth I decided on the shrimp salad sandwich on a garlic bagel and a side of potato salad. Jessie choose the tuna salad on an everything bagel with a side of pasta salad. I also ordered an ice coffee! It was huge, but seriously watered down. I was so happy when our food came cause I was so hungry. My sandwich was piled high with huge shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and red onion. Yummy! It was heaven in my mouth. The shrimp melded so well with that soft garlic bagel. Tasty! It came with my favorite kind of pickle, the half done dill pickle! (Swoon) I didn't really care for their potato salad which I remember being good. I think I've been spoiled by Weiss's potato salad. Jessie also gobbled up her tuna sandwich. I was so glad she liked it.

I've lived in New York, arguably the capital of deli perfection. For me, The Bagel Cafe beats NYC's finest, shall we say, *efforts.* The corned beef is my personal favorite and unbeatable! Their bagels are top notch, and their desserts?! Bliss in the form of pastries!

To top it off, the staff- from the servers to the gentlemen in the deli/ to-go station- is always friendly, helpful, and welcoming.

I was so happy to be able to have lunch there today. And I look forward to the next time! Maybe tomorrow ;)",9wx3MmQgWtkD6gS5LaPi4A,0,0,4,pnMAg1CkZmGGf6LbUvUsOw

5048520,2012-09-17,2,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"This sandwich and rugulach habit is getting ridiculous. The BF and I have come back several times in such a short span. 

The first few times we got breakfast and I highly recommend for eggs benedict fans to get it here. I love hollandaise and they are not skimpy with it, ham actually has flavor, perfect poach eggs. I tried the crab cake version too, and surprised I liked the original better. The corned beef hash was another we tried and I thought it was tasty. I love their potatoes the brekkies come with and the bagels of their name sake actually are quite nice. 

Then I decided to try their corned beef sandwich and was prepared to be only mildly satisfied. I have a little Jewish corner of my heart that beats for childhood Saturdays at Langer's. The corned beef was flavorful, juicy and the marbled bread I chose was great. I always eat mine with  coleslaw and Russian dressing (aka thousand island). I'm normally into pickles, but theirs is closer to cucumber than pickle so I'm not the most fond of it. The sandwich was so good, I was a bit sad to  share with the BF and take the other half of the benedict even though I love the bennie. 

So we came back several more times to get our own. I have to say that the way to go is the soup and half sandwich deal ($10.95- $11.95). It actually comes out cheaper with more food since the sandwich was just as big as a 1/4th lb, you get soup and can even get a side if you wish for $1. The matzo ball soup here is decent, and the sweet and sour stuffed cabbage was nice though I dropped my phone in it trying to Yelp it. We also tried the lobster salad sandwich and that was solid, but I'm gonna stay with the meat sandwiches..... I should mention I lean towards mostly eating vegetarian and this place is testing it. 

Service is pretty decent on checking up. We also don't go during busy times as this is the type of place that gets swamped during regular breakfast/lunch hours on weekends. Beat the busy by heading in a bit later in the afternoon. 

While the sandwich and benedict have been stellar, the dessert counter has been extreme highs and lows so much so that I can't justify a 5star. 

The best: The rugulach are awesomely good. I normally don't like chocolate ones but I love them here, the almond ones are great, all the fruit ones are great. There is not a bad one so even though it is priced per pound, I feel this is worth it. 
The subpar: I'm not fond of the black and white cookie being more like cake. I know a lot of delis do this and I'm just more of a shadortbred person.  The rainbow cookies were okay, but not quite up to my standard with it being too wet though the sponge flavor was right on (those are one of my favorite deli sweets). The homemade twinkie was a bit dry.
 The bad: we got a slice of buttercream cake which was painfully sweet with the frosting tasting like boxed. It was thick, sticky and you can feel sugar granules in it with the cake itself also rather sweet. It was a throwaway so I will not be getting anything else but rugulachs. The desserts aren't cheap for what they are...Spent $27 with only the rugulachs being the only thing we are gonna eat the entirety of. 

This is great place and I do highly recommend this as a go-to if you're in the area, just know how to navigate the deli and massive menu through recommendations.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,6,4,2FHrNZ0c95bIXoUqVq1YAg

Tasty NY Bagels... check
Rainbow cookies... check
Black and white cookies... check

The rainbow cookies are where it's at. I never thought I would find rainbow cookies as good as the ones my mom makes but these are right up on that same level. If my mom had charged as much as they do for hers... I wouldn't be living in an apartment right now. Although, I would owe her a LOT of money.

The pizza, the Chinese food, and the Bagels. While the former two are admittedly debatable there is clearly one great Bagel place in this town. The Bagel Cafe is just like back home. It's even worth a drive if you aren't very close by. I've tried Brooklyn bagel deli, big apple bagel, and a bunch of other ""New York bagel"" joints and nothing comes close. They are either too hard even when ""freshly made"" or just not right. I'm sure a lot has to do with climate here, I make pizzas here and understand that it's tricky. But this place gets it just right. You can order a dozen which actually gets you 14 and a pound of cream cheese for like 16 bucks if I remember correctly. The cream cheese is great here too.

Oh well. If they're still there the next go around then it can't be that bad right?

Anyhow I always wanted to try a chocolate babka. Blame it on Seinfeld. That episode left an indelible mark on me because I still think about it to this day. Let's face it, a babka is as foreign to me as a spam musubi would be to a New Yorker. And Bagel Cafe fits my needs perfectly because I'm not planning to go to New York anytime soon.

So my visit to Bagel Cafe is strictly for their bakery/deli side. Those bagels looked pretty darn good. But I was on a mission to get my chocolate babka and thank goodness they still had some. I think I got the second to the last one. I also got a rainbow cookie and chocolate rugulah both sold by the pound. 

Chocolate Babka - A loaf of coffee cake filled with chocolate. That loaf must have weighed 3 pounds. I swear. It was heavy. I hand carried this back to Honolulu. I thought it would taste like Hawaiian sweet bread. But nope.  It's a very dense bread that has a wisp of sweetness to it. I gave some away to share and had a nice french toast breakfast with the leftovers.

Rainbow Cookie - So pretty. Layers of almond extract soaked sponge cake layered between chocolate ganache. So, so good. Moist and very sweet. Wish I bought two or three. 

Chocolate Rugulah - This chocoholic had to get it. It was delicious. Not overly sweet. Wish I bought two or three.

I can finally lay my babka fascination to rest. I would love to go back again. Maybe try their restaurant side which looks kinda casual and quaint. 

TIP: When looking for this place, they are facing N. Buffalo so it's pretty hard to miss. You will see their big signage on their building that kind of look like townhouses.",mwc8rVfuwgfh13HB6hxYmw,4,3,4,N96HD9MJ0H8HDOkTXXd4sQ

Pastrami Meat Omelet ($9.95). I wasn't sure how this combination was going to work out, but I am SO glad it did! Very flavorful pastrami, and everything here was perfect! Love their ""home fries"" aka breakfast potatoes and it comes with a bagel as well!  One of the BEST omelets I've had to date.

All the omelets come with a choice of side...including a Bagel.  I gave the Jalapeno and Cheddar bagel with Jalapeno Cream Cheese a whirl. So good!  A lot of the flavor was in the cream cheese...love how they pair em up!

I also grabbed some goodies from the bakery side....give the ITALIAN COOKIES a shot if you want a super rich, thick chocolaty cake like dessert.  Not sure why it's called cookies, but I am not complaining on taste!

On my last trip I had a cup of soup with a garden salad, and of course, it comes with a bagel. Service was sweet, but a little haphazard. I requested an everything bagel, but they were out, so I went with garlic (pretty much the smellier the better for me). Fast forward and a sesame bagel arrives on the table. Apparently, they were also out of garlic, but not really. To make a long story short, I eventually ended up with a garlic bagel, but I was a bit baffled by how someone could think that sesame was an acceptable replacement for garlic. The other troubling thing about bagels here is that they are incapable of toasting a bagel with accessories (such as garlic bits or onions) without burning the little bits. They claim it is impossible, but I don't believe them, and there is nothing quite as unappetizing as burnt garlic. But, I digress.

I am a fan of the matzo ball soup. It has huge chunks of tender chicken, carrots, a delicious ball and a nice balance of seasonings without being overly salty. The cup of soup with a bagel would be enough for a smart-sized lunch. Next time, I would probably skip the salad and avoid getting my bagel toasted. The salad was pretty fresh and tasty, but kind of a hassle to eat and heavy on the black olives. Plus, who needs salad when you've got the matzo?",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,11,8,4,LCiGxWWJH0i48xDD90MRYw

The wait also went by quickly because they have tons of baked goods to nosh on. I grabbed a perfect black and white cookie. 

For breakfast, I ordered 3 eggs, bacon and a super egg bagel with nova schmear. The bagel and bacon were great, but I was a little disappointed by the eggs. 

One thing I missed out on were the coffee shakes. Next time I come, I'll try one of these.

On our trip back to Vegas this week we made the drive from the strip so I could eat here again and see if it lived up to my fond memories.  It smelled the same upon entering had the same great, friendly service and as always it was busy but they never rush you. This is the best deli I have been to (sorry NY spots).  This visit I had a meat combo sandwich of corned beef and pastrami on rye.  Just as I remember it!  Perfection!

My family members each had breakfast items which made me remember how insane I was for their bagels!

Let's go with the good then I'll drop my tiny bomb on the bad.  The food is high quality and always fresh.  They have amazing breakfast that nearly all come with a bagel and one of their amazing cream cheeses.  Love the scallion cream cheese.  Lunch is crazy good and HUGE!  They offer gigantic salads all with fresh produce, meats and cheeses.  The also offer great dinner specials.  

Today we had a tuna melt that was made with great tasting tuna salad and fries.  We also had a cabbage roll that was served with a cup of soup and of course a bagel with cream cheese.  Loved it all!

Parking isn't an issue as there is plenty of it.  The place is always packed but there is never a long wait so don't fret!

Only visited once in the past, but a place to which several others have been referred when craving a good local deli, it was in reminiscing of Langer's a week prior that breakfast was enjoyed at The Bagel Cafe, certainly not the landmark sort of place found in Los Angeles but a very good meal at a fair price just the same.

Laid out with a grab n' go area, bakery, and deli near the door as a spacious but tightly packed dining room fills the rear it was just after 8am on a Friday that our party of five entered and with family getting seated while I perused the pastry case it was mere moments before the menu was navigated; orders placed and rather weak coffee poured.

Perhaps the youngest people in the place, my 60+ year old mother included, it was not long before pastry selections arrived tableside, the daily muffin and huge slice of crumb cake each buttery soft  while a warm cinnamon roll was unfortunately a bit overbaked, the black and white cookie fluffy and thick although frosting tasted a bit artificial.

Moving onward to mains, the kitchen expediting orders at breakneck pace with  the dining room 2/3 full, it was with faux-Maple syrup cast aside in favor of the real stuff from home that French Toast, Pancakes and Waffles were gilded, the last a flavorless disaster when compared to the textbook alternatives; the the hash simply not my style and the blitzes failing to live up to the high standards set by Langer's and innumerable others.    

Slipping a bit since my first visit, perhaps an effect of such a large crowd or perhaps a result of me overrating the place based on excellent ordering the first time around, The Bagel Cafe remains a competent spot for those craving Deli foods or what is still, in my view, the best bagel in Sin City.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,5,3,S8r0DLQZG_pFRcSxIaIcCA

Although I am not yet age privileged,  I want those same things too. With that being said, I hit the jackpot because at the Bagel Cafe, there was a sea of silver hair.

It is your typical Jewish deli with an amazing bakery in the front. I have probably tried all of their pastries a few times over. Today, I grabbed a booth and enjoyed brunch with my family.

Their servers work very hard and they are top notch! One of my biggest pet peeves is when a server is either too anxious or too slow with the check. My server's timing was just right.

To begin, it is a huge menu so we needed a bit of time to study it, so we ordered coffees.  I have no idea what the muddy water in the cup was and no amount of cream or sugar could help, YUK!  Oh well, I'm a coffee snob I guess.  My husband ordered a tuna melt on marble rye and he ate most of it.  That said, he didn't touch his fries....I thought maybe he was having a stroke!  Greasy!!  I had the tasteless shrimp salad and had them put it in a wrap.  Someone clearly doesn't realize it's the folding of the wrap that holds the contents in and cut the bottom off, so I removed the wrap to eat it after it fell out all over my plate.  No flavor, none.  I'm also a pickle lover and wouldn't call this a pickle.  I grew up on homemade pickles.  How can you ruin a pickle??  Hubby agreed.  The small side of cole slaw was edible.  That's $40 I'm not getting back, but lesson learned.  To be fair, I asked a few patrons who were leaving if this was a regular spot for them.  To my surprise, they all said they come for the soup only!  I think my last point of distaste was the servers wiping loads of crumbs onto the chairs from the previous patrons.

You seat yourself and read the menu that looks like a newspaper then the server takes your order. For anything to-go, you have to go to the deli/bakery line.

I had such a sugar rush when I ate half a pound of the rainbow cookies. Those treats with the colors of the Italian flag that tastes like almond with apricot jam in each layer and chocolate on top. They're so good I couldn't stop myself from eating them.  I easily spent $56 on rainbow cookies, raspberry rugulach, apple rugulach, black and white cookies, Florentine cookies, linzers, etc.  

Their eggs benedict was also yummy.  Great Hollandaise sauce (consistency and flavor).  It comes with potatoes.  I also tried their cheese blintzes with strawberries.  Each blintz was fully stuffed with sweet cream cheese filling.  I could only eat 1.

They also have sandwiches, matzoh ball soup, salmon, white fish, etc. on their menu. Bagels and schmear, meats, monster-sized cupcakes, 7-layer cake, carrot cake, etc in the bakery/deli.

LOVE:
Homemade food.
Fresh baked breads.
House-made Pickles (seriously, they're perfect)
Friendly service

Like:
Their soups are off the chain (I know it's 100 degrees in Vegas, but soup me!)
Corny newspaper menus
Selection of fresh baked pastries and cakes
Over-stuffed sandwiches.

Hate:
WARNING: Don't share your sandwiches (what, the what?! I do what I want with my sammie).
Pricing - $7.50 for a cup of soup.
Chaotic when entering. There's no ""seat yourself"" sign or anyone really greeting you.
How basic and homey the place feels.
Bland, uninspired food.

Bagel Cafe is hidden in a Business Park and they're always busy (especially on the weekends - up to an hour wait). IT's got a huge area in the front where you can get deli meats, cheese, chips, sammies, soups, cookies, bagels, and every other sweet confection known to man to-go. There are about 30 tables/booths. There's not a lot of ambiance and all employees where Bagel Cafe polo shirts so they're easy to spot. Bagel Cafe is very hit-or-miss in regards to what you order. My Matzo Ball soup was excellent and full of chicken chunks (and a few small bones), carrots, celery, and noodles. It's tasty, but nothing that makes it memorable. The tuna salad was bland. I hardly ever reach for salt and pepper and I had to! The Nova Platter small was a small amount of lox, olives, sliced tomato, sliced cucumber, and a pickle that was halved, it was $11.95, way too much for mainly salad bar options. I also can't get over the fact that they sell 1/4 & 1/2 lb sandwich options and state DO NOT SHARE. I get that if you are at an AYCE sushi place or dining at a 5 star restaurant, but at a Breakfast/Brunch spot? I do what I want with my sandwich and sharing is caring!

At the end of the day, the BAD outweights the good here. Overpriced, restrictions, dull food, and lack of organization makes this place a ""meh"" in my book.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,11,7,2,dYrgnKQ58ZZO8-MGceI38Q

5336978,2016-01-25,1,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"This is an update to  a previous review I did in 2014.  I wanted to give Bagel Cafe one more try, and probably this will be my last try.  I ordered a corned beef sandwich - no sides, no other items.  Total bill:  $14.00 (the sandwich was $12.95 plus tax).  Yes, the sandwich is large and can  be split between two people, but really?   $14.00 for a sandwich? (and a pickle that comes with it).  I will say, this time the pickle was better than last time, it tasted like a real kosher pickle instead of a raw cucumber.  However, the corned beef had tough, chewy portions that were difficult to swallow, and as last time, it was on the dry side, so I'm still very unimpressed with the quality of their corned beef and won't be doing that again. Also, I didn't see  prices posted anywhere. If there's a price list, I couldn't find it.  So, I suffered from ""sticker shock"" when I paid the bill.  

They must have raised their prices because last time my total was around $16.00 for a sandwich, cole slaw and a bear claw.  I thought this time it would be  less by at least several dollars, since I was only getting a sandwich and nothing else, but obviously not.    I'm reaching the point of simply giving up on 90% of the places in town except fast food because everything is so outrageously expensive in ways that really can't be justified.  If you're okay with paying $14.00 for a corned beef sandwich which  isn't that great, go ahead.  I'm not. .",r1Z8dxSnd7T4XEAhVUoA0Q,0,0,2,A9vLZX7qoIDBJ097R5jzKQ

What I didn't like: When we walked in we waited for a long time to be seated, not because there weren't any seats, but because no one was standing there to seat us. We didn't get a hello or anything from any employee. A few walked by and saw us standing there. Nothing. A guy eventually walks up and seats us. The second time I was there I took my order to go. They were SO BEYOND rude to this little old man standing at the bakery. They asked if I needed help I explained that he was before me and had been standing there a while. They told him he was standing at the wrong place, they mentioned this to him over 5 times as he was putting in his order. He kept apologizing saying normally his wife goes in and he didn't know. OKAY! We get it! Leave the poor man alone and take his order. This place is extremely unorganized as other yelpers have mentioned.

The sides are choice of coleslaw, macaroni salad, or fries, along with a pickle. The soups are chicken noodle, cabbage or soup of the day. And for the traditional kids menu, Hebrew National hot dogs! 

They have egg creme but to be honest, I haven't tried them. I hear they are good.

First off, our waitress talked so fast, we couldn't even answer before she was already making up our mind for us. We were supposed to have an option as our side (potatoes, fruit, or bread) and she never asked us what we wanted so I assumed that we didn't get a side with our meal. We did, she just assumed we wanted potatoes. Which I did not. We were served our meal without silverware. And after our meal, we went to the bakery and stood at the counter for minutes with staff walking past before anyone asked us if we had been helped. We noticed we were charged $3.25 for a potato pancake at our table, but they were at the bakery for $2.25. When I asked the cashier why we were charged more she gave me a snotty attitude and said it's cause they ""warm it up."" Seriously?! Starbucks warms your baked goods for free! When I told her it was silly she rolled her eyes and said ""it's the labor charge."" I'm thinking ""OMG your ridiculous"" but these words stayed in my head. I wanted to slap her.

5498952,2010-12-14,0,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"I just found a piece of lox in my refrigerator. I bought here about six weeks ago right before getting ridiculously sick. Instead of grossing me out, the ancient piece of fish just made me want to go back to the Bagel Cafe to restock on fresh stuff.

It's about 35 minutes each way for me to get to Bagel Cafe, which seems like a long way to travel for bagels, but they are without question the best bagels I've had outside of NJ/NY. Having grown up there, I am very particular about bagels. You won't catch me dead in an Einstein. But these bagels are, in a word, fantastic.

They're oversized, big like real New York bagels should be. The crust of the bagel is browned just enough in the baking process, the crumb of the bagels remain chewy and moist.

Another feather in their cap: Bagel Cafe puts a TON of stuff on their bagels. Getting a dozen garlic always results in a massive pile of loose garlic in the bottom of the bag.

As much as I swoon over their bagels (I also really like the onion, asiago and jalapeno cheddar), there's much more here than that. I also like getting a little hand-sliced lox here - while I haven't had anything else from the deli, it all smells OH so good.

As for the dessert case ... I have to plead guilty here. The massive slabs of tiramisu, Napoleons, moist and fragrant macaroons, and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big) muffins, and best of all, rugelach - chocolate, raspberry, apple cinnamon and almond. Score.

A dozen bagels (which is actually 14) is just $10 here, which is sort of insanely cheap. Unfortunately, all the other non-bagel stuff here is so tempting that I wind up easily dropping $30 or more whenever I walk in the door.

We arrived at 1 pm on a Friday and luckily only had a five minute wait to be seated. However we were not waited on for quite a while. The menu is extensive, so it is difficult to decide what to order. I settled on the corned beef hash and eggs special with an everything bagel. I am gluten sensitive so I mainly ordered the bagel for my husband to take home. He ordered a burger made with grass fed 
beef. 

We waited what seemed to be forever for our food. This surprised me because on other occasions we were served faster.  I forgot to take photos of the food because we were so hungry by the time they arrived. My order was well presented with a generous three eggs (I ordered over easy and they were cooked perfectly). The corned beef was cut up with onions and potatoes plus there was a small side of hash browns. They even added a skewer of fruit kabob. The bagel was toasted but not buttered and came with cream cheese with no butter on the side. If I was planning to eat it there I would have complained but it was fine for us. Bottom line, the food was good and the price was right ($10 special). 

My husband's burger came with fries and one side and he had coleslaw. He complained to me that the bun was falling apart but the burger was tasty. The fries stood out as some of the best here in Vegas. 

We were asked once if we needed anything but once we were done eating we were ignored and had to eventually request our check and take home box. The portions were so large we took home half the burger and my dish (and the bagel).

Today was no exception, the restaurant was fairly busy so we didn't mind waiting for a table, however it took an exorbitant long time to get our order taken once we were seated. The food came at a reasonable time but the order wasn't accurate. When we were ready to leave it took forever to finally get the check, we asked three people and sat for over 20 minutes trying to get somebody to get us a check; they wouldn't.

I'm never going back regardless of whether I like the food or not.  The service is so poor for  what you pay there's just no reason to go there anymore.

Service is always great.  It's a bit more pricey, but you're getting quality food that you can't find anywhere else.",4EKW1EdJpoB-RMcuhbxqQA,2,1,5,QCXVj29vSFp8lcH9YcSaVw

Their bakery and deli counter is the best feature of this place; they have a huge selection of decadent desserts, meatz, cheezez, and of course, bagelz. It's easy and quick to get your order and get out when ordering at the counter. The last time we went there my gal and I got a raspberry (strawberry? can't remember exactly) danish and it was pretty damn good. I'm sure there are some desserts in there that are a bit dry but overall it's a win-win. I'd prefer to get a bag o' bagels over dining in and getting a bagel entrée.

Sunday morning breakfast is a nice atmosphere because it's quite bustling--however, it might be a while before you are seated and the service may seem a bit moony and often cold. I suggest getting an omelette when dining in with a side bagel if you're dying for a nice big breakfast because the other big breakfasts aren't really that appetizing. Not that the omelettes are supermodels, but they're pretty great.

Overall, it's a pretty good place. If you're visiting LV, it's far enough away from the strip that it makes it nice to get away from that snake-pit but close enough that you don't have to drive hours for a simple meal. Good luck finding a place to park as their lot sux and is surrounded by dentists.",cO0magHhdeY7LgdbSzsp4g,0,0,4,eWUWCTB5bKs_-rgxbcjALw

5582702,2014-09-17,2,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"As I am from NYC area, finding a good deli/bagel is a hard thing to come by.
Bagel Cafe comes very close. The bagels are very good, they have the cookie bar that compares favorably to deli's back east, their Challa is excellent and makes fantastic french toast, and they have a vast variety of cream cheeses.

The dining area is a great place to enjoy some good Matzoh Ball soup, however, it is a very busy soup with noodles and carrots drowning out the small matzoh ball. (A good Matzoh Ball soup should have the Matzoh Ball on display in the middle of the soup.)

I was not impressed with the Corned Beef sandwich, nor did I think I would be having yet to find quality corned beef outside of NY or to a lesser extent, LA.
What was disappointing is the photo on the menu appeared to be piled high but the sandwich I received had a much more pedestrian helping of Corned Beef, most likely due to the rising cost of meat.   The rye bread was cut too thick and overpowered the sandwich but was a tasty bread in and of itself.

I do enjoy that they sell Dr. Brown's black cherry soda, Wise potato chips, and day old bagel chips and breads.  The deli meat counter however is often overpriced for the same boar's head meat you can get at the supermarket and the Lox prices are extremely high.  But go with a lox cream cheese which has large chunks of lox but is reasonably priced.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,0,4,AIEg_sygd9fkuzDlSlIu8Q

Best believe this afternoon I will be back for round two somewhere.  Although, known for their kosher offerings, I figured I could get some lox on one of the final weeks of lent Fridays.

So I opted for none other than...the waitresses recommendation on the best breakfast.  I believe the waitresses name is Nancy and was very sweet and sociable.  However, she did remind me of the sister of a co worker who is also very sweet, yet, a little broke down, not body odor conscious and has had a streak of bad luck.  Luckily, I try not to make a correlation with negativity, but it was hard not to notice the resemblance.  

Needless to say, Nancy recommended the crab cake benedict, and if y'all have read my previous reviews in the past, I have been known to have a soft place in my heart for benedict style breakfasts.  

The dish came out in a timely manner and commenced the destruction of the meal.  The dish came with two crab cake benedicts that were good portions, not too small, not gigantoid.  The dish was accompanied with a side of country style potatoes that were yummy as well.  This is the Friday before Good Friday and my no meat lent restrictions are nearly complete.  

The benedicts were filled with an above average crab cake, composed of real crab meat, how do I know you ask?  Well if you hit an occasional bit of shell, chances are the mofo is authentic.  The chunks were a generous size as well.  Holandaise sauce was good to go, not overwhelming or invisible, just right.  The price is the other indicator that the crab meat was real and not faux.  Priced at $14ish, the dish better have included real crab meat, right?!  Not quite as good as Maryland Crab Shack, which I still have a discount coupon for, but a close runner up.

Following the meal, my patnah and I notice that one of our ""indirect"" bosses showed up and my homie began to slide under the table.  I see nothing wrong with staying nutritionally adequate to perform our work duties and was tryna holla at him, yet with his stunnas on, it appeared that he was tryna keep it on the low pro.  

Anyhow, I later learned that you are not supposed to eat six hours prior to getting oral surgery, so if I choke on the crab cakes coming back out, nancy is my coworker reincarnated to punish me for my comments about her in this review.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,1,0,3,pzcTjb29gEvzFyHiaav7xA

Desperate for anything not in a casino, I went twice this past week for breakfast and both times it was excellent.  Very busy spot with an excellent waitstaff that greets you warmly and gets the coffee flowing while you consider breakfast options.

The menu is pretty extensive with many great sounding options.  On my first visit I went with a corned beef hash omelette (which is not on the menu but they were able to whip it up for me) and even though I am always hesitant to order a bagel anywhere that is not Long Island, this place had me feeling good so I went for it - everything toasted with scallion cream cheese.  Excellent all around - everything fresh and prepared to order. 

Came back later in the week needing another escape from the glitter and noise.  This time I was heading to the Red Rock Conservation area for a hike and needed some fuel.  This is on the way if you are coming from the Vegas strip area, but I would have come even if it weren't.  This time I went veggie omelette and a salt bagel with cream cheese and bacon.  Once again, excellent all around - great food, great service and just an excellent overall experience. 

While Vegas is not on my favorites list, so glad I found a spot to get away when business calls me there.

So, a friend and I had breakfast this morning.  I thought I'd be healthy and ordered a veggie omelet with a whole wheat bagel.

The positives:
- The bagels were delicious and just like back east! 
- Our server was very friendly and attentive
- Their deli counter was very impressive, and provided a lot of to-go options
- Their portion size was very generous and we ended up taking a good bit of our fish platter home
- They started us off with some bagel chips and pineapple/coconut cream cheese which was excellent

The Negatives:
- They were very rigid as far as the menu went.  The waiter had to check and make sure they could do certain things.  This sometimes is a red flag.  I am the customer, charge me more if you have to, but give me what I want!
- We got a slice of banana cream cake and a frosted cookie (free with a yelp check-in).  The cake was just ok, and the cookie was almost tasteless

So since it was my mother's birthday and my wife and I wanted to take her out for a morning breakfast we decided to try the bagel cafe.

When we arrived we definitely noticed that the parking spots were for compact vehicles, since there was someone who didn't get that message and had their 1 ton truck taking up 2 parking spots. After finding a parking spot we walked in and were quickly greeted and found a spot to sit. It was my first time to this location so I was not sure if this was like a sandwich shop a pastry shop or a restaurant, well apparently it's all in ONE which is quite awesome I love one stop shops. 

After being seated we sat and waited at the table for menus. The bus boy came and asked if we wanted drinks. We ordered 1 coffee and 2 waters and again we waited. The waitress came with a pen and pad and asked us if we were ready to order. We all said we were waiting for the menus. She quickly apologized and informed us that the menus were located at the end of the table and was newspaper like menus. 

We looked through the menu which seemed a bit long for a breakfast/lunch establishment I believe that even in the last pages there were dinner plates which confused me a bit as there not open past 5. 

We ordered a cup of Matzo Ball soup, a biscuits and gravy plate, a corn beef hash and egg plate and one fresh veggie omelet. The matzo ball soup came with one ignoramus matzo ball and it was piled high with vegetables and chicken. My mom being the very whitey person that she is quickly reminded me how she had made me a similar soup when I was a kid and how I complained to her that what she served me was clearly not matzo ball soup and it was chicken noodle soup with a matzo ball in it LOL! Well that's exactly what I got here. My mom is a sous-chef at petrossian bar at the Bellagio and she drilled me at how matzo ball soup can be made in many different ways. Well I don't prefer this kind all though it was hearty and the matzo ball was delightful. I still prefer a matzo ball soup with just matzo ball not with chicken and vegetables. The portions reminded me allot of hash house a go go. The portions were rather big and hearty. The biscuits were soft and the gravy was very exquisite a change from hash house because there biscuits seemed to be a bit hard and these were really soft and awesome when paired with the gravy. The veggie omelet was a veggie omelet nothing spectacular. The corn beef hash was tasty especially coming from me because I'm not a corn beef fan and this one was defiantly cooked correctly and seasoned just right.

I think the customer service was sub-par. I could tell that the waitress was definitely trying to be nice and helpful however I felt at times I was forgotten we only had 1 water refilled and my mother's coffee was never refilled or even offered to be refilled.

We showed up around noon time on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed but were seated within ten minutes. My wife ordered a Reuben and I ordered the tongue tip. Our waitress returned a bit later to tell me they were out of tongue tip and regular tongue. I asked if this was normal and she couldn't really say. I settled on a philly cheese steak. All I can say is both sandwiches were a disappointment. Small servings and the philly might have just been two pieces of bread and a sprinkling of meat. Onions, peppers, cheese?  To beat it all on our way out we saw a sign on the door that said this is a place of peace no firearms. When will people learn that criminals don't read or care about signs. My wife and I were both armed and managed to get through our sub par meal without disturbing anyone. Armed citizens are a deterrent to crime and not a danger. If you want to prevent lawful CCW post your sign better. As per the law. I guess I'll never get to find out about that tongue sandwich now.

5808086,2017-09-26,0,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"A long long time ago. In a city far away, I moved to Vegas and ate a bagel. 

It was a 5 year experience that I'm glad that I had. Among many of the places I patronized while I lived there was the Bagel Cafe. 
I stumbled across it with the help of a friend. Okay, we were driving by and saw it. The rest is history. 
Fast forward 256 years into the future (sometimes it feels like that) and my wife and I are in Vegas for a whirlwind conference. Unfortunately, like most times, we didn't have time to do much. But, we were leaving sin city on a Friday morning and my wife wanted to stop one of the places I used to haunt. 
I forgot the name! :(  Quickly, I grabbed my phone and Googled Bagel Summerlin. The name and address came up and voila, it was JUST as I remembered. Deli in the front and seating in the back.

The first thing you notice is the place is clean. 
The second thing you notice is the staff is friendly. 
My wife ordered a full pastrami sandwich on marble rye.
I ordered a tongue sandwich on traditional rye. 
I asked the waiter if the tongue was fresh and he said yes. 
In about 10 minutes, the sandwiches were delivered.
My mouth is watering thinking about it now, several days later!
The pastrami was very good. Almost as good as a place I know in the Valley. The tongue was exceptional. Good taste, tender, and soft. 
The sandwich was almost too big for my mouth. It was delicious!
The only thing I didn't care for was the rye. Yes, they make their own rye, but it was too soft and squishy. I like a rye with a descent crust and a heavier rye flavor. But, that's me. The rye, as a bread goes, still was very fresh.
My sandwich was GONE is short order. My wife took 1/2 her sandwich to eat 7 hours later on the drive home.

----------------
Bottom Line

The Bagel Cafe is good. I take that back, it's GREAT!
The best time to go is during the week. Weekends were way TOO busy from my recollection, but should that stop you? No! Go anyway. A crowded deli is part of the New York experience!

Yes, I will go back when I'm in Vegas again!!!

We stumbled upon this place after a search for black and white cookies.   After looking at the photos, we had to stop by and get some.    On the first trip there, I got a black and white cookie and a few macaroons.   The macaroons were awesome.   The black and white cookies were pretty good.   It was definitely enough to warrant another trip.  
The second trip, we got some more black and white cookies to take home along with some raspberry linzer tarts and a raspberry rugalah.   Yummy!   They were all really good.   
If you are from the East Coast, or just like good baked goods,  give this place a try.

5837401,2016-12-13,3,FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ,"I just had my introduction here for lunch today, and came away satiated and very impressed.   The list of available food choices in the newspaper menu is ginormous, and includes everything from breakfast omelets to a myriad of combinations of meat sandwiches , and even three types of pickles: a sliced whole Kosher Dill, bright green New Pickle spears, and pickle chips.  Step over from the dining room to the glass display cases near the entrance, and, in addition to several varieties of cream cheeses, a large array of pastry delicacies beckon, ranging from Seven-Layer Chocolate Cake to the largest Black and White Cookies I have to date seen.

Although I enjoy eating Nova Lox on a cream-cheesed bagel about once a week, when I go to a deli I am generally looking for a heaping meat-filled deli sandwich on rye.  So, foolishly I suppose, for years I was put off by the ""Bagel"" in the restaurant's title.  Now that I know better, I expect to get my deli fix here on about a bimonthly basis.  Although I found the Matzoh Ball Soup and corned beef to be on the same par as found at Carnegie Deli at The Mirage, here I will not have to pay an exorbitant valet parking fee for the pleasure of dining on the Strip, and I can get my mouth around the 1/4 pound sandwich halves--albeit barely so.  

My cup of Matzoh Ball Soup was excellent, except it could have used a bit more salt.  The Kosher Dill spears were right on, and the New Pickle spears barely ripe, as is normally the case.  The corned beef in my Corned Beef on Seeded Rye was moist and lean, just as I hoped, and the bread was also first rate.  Potato Salad and Cole Slaw were both creamy and delicious, and the French Fries of a superior grade.  Accompanying bagels were oversize and  noticeably fresh, and although my party of four hardly needed them, an assortment of bagel chips served with a pile of gray cream cheese were tasty as well.  I dressed up my sandwich with mild yellow mustard--although spicy mustard is also available--and luscious chopped liver.  By ordering an appetizer plate of Chopped Liver I could mete out what I wanted to smear on the rye with a table knife, and thus avoid a 1/2 & 1/2 deli sandwich combo, in which case I would be downing a quarter-pound of the artery-clogging organ meat.

It was a great tummy-filling lunch!  And my seat mates were equally pleased with their selections: a Tuna Salad Melt on Marble Rye, a Combo Corned Beef And Pastrami on Rye, and a Roast Beef French Dip with hot au jus and French Fries.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,4,5,m_1lZW1FDerorr8bc4AxXA

I do want to start by saying that all the issues that came up were remedied best they could be, but I still left slightly disappointed. I ordered the egg white omelet and my plate had a hair in the food. This seems to be a trend for me lately when I dine with this group of friends. Also noted! The server took my plate away, was very apologetic, and brought me a new dish as fast as the kitchen could push it out. My replacement omelet was overdone and my bagel was burnt.

It has character, they make their customers feel like family and the food is amazing. One of the things I feel like many Las Vegans complain about is the lack of these types of family owned restaurants. Since this is right by my house, I eat there almost 2-3 times per month.

It is perfect for takeout or sit-in, they also have a huge selections of desserts, which are perfect if you just want a little something to crave your sweet tooth or you are looking for a full on cake to bring to a party.

For breakfast I am hooked on the veggie omelet, with sliced tomatoes and an everything bagel. (The lite scallion cream cheese is my weakness!) 

They actually have good strong house coffee too!

For lunch their fresh tuna and egg salad sandwiches are so good and HUGE!

One of things that continues to draw me into this place is that unlike most breakfast places you don't feel like you are consuming a thousand calories! Their food tastes fresh and healthy! Of course if you get Biscuits and Gravy or something like that you are probably looking at a boat load of calories/fat, but overall I don't feel like they cover their food in butter or grease.",FOFKuCoclgR0zAlVe7i1Zg,2,0,5,ArODbqcj_vWcBlI78DO4Tg

I came here for bagels on a Saturday morning and after further studying the menu, I knew I had to return.  And I did. Less than 24 hours later.  We dined in both times. I shared the fish platter (belly lox) with my mom and it was fantastic. The bagels were delicious and the serving of cream cheese is enough to serve 3.  The following day, I returned with the whole family in tow, and tried the Crab eggs benedict.  It was delicious, but the ONLY downfall was that the poached egg was overcooked.  I asked the waitress about it, and she said that is how they normally do it, and next time to specify that I want the runny egg-yolk goodness instead.  The crab cakes were crabulicious and I can just imagine how much more amazing they will be with my yolk of choice.  

My husband and mom both ordered ""Overstuffed Meat Sandwiches"" (pastrami and brisket) and our mouths watered as the tower of meat was served.  They both ordered whole sandwiches and had enough to take home for an afternoon snack.
