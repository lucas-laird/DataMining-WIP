1384949,2015-05-17,0,eOI8wM9EEGzsefVaAF076w,"Ate here for lunch one day and I had a good experience. I've been looking for a place that serves good meat Jun. Their meat jun wasn't the greatest I had but it wasn't terrible and it beat a few other places I've tried. I'm surprised they had Mac salad which is a plus and I got to choose my four sides. I thought I had a good amount of food to their price.
I brought my bf back to try them, and coming from Hawaii, all of these Korean bbq places we compare to yummys. He got the meat jun and bbq beef combo and was handed a plate without choosing sides which the whole point of me bringing him was to try their Mac salad along with their other sides.
He wasn't impressed and was given VERY small portions (like 4 piece small) on all of his side dishes. His food was very little compared to what I got.
Because their service and amount of food were inconsistent I didn't think they deserved 3 stars.",aE3IOtk2m10wxXVClgq6Sw,0,0,2,HW26R8GgEAsHdA5RAFl1sg

Just a few weeks ago I had Bibimbap with spicy pork from Mi Ga, which was restaurant quality, easily four stars.  Today I ordered the same from Mirak and was told I could only get it with Bulgogi, which really didn't matter as there were only about four tiny  pieces in the bowl.  It could have passed for a vegetarian dish.  If I want Dolsot Bibimbap in the future I'll be heading over to Good Fella Korean Bistro instead. 

Not sure what's going on here.  I heard the stalls had been taken over by the mall owner last year, and although the selection was limited, the food was at least decent quality back then.  These most recent changes have not been for the better.",4WCness-j8qX2QUTmbzvIw,1,0,4,ZJrFJ748Wd3MeZCNa3UTxg

First stop was Mi Ga because I read many great reviews for them. We ordered the #14 stir fried spicy pork - it came out on a sizzling stone plate with lots of vegetables: cabbage, scallion, zucchini, onions, and jalape√±os (because we asked for extra spicy). The flavor was nice and spicy - not unbearable, but flavorful. As we are spice lovers, we felt that it could of used some more kick! (But that's just our personal preference) The food still tasted great. My only gripe, was that I wish the pork was more tender - It was rather tough. Other than that, it's still delicious for food court style food. I would definitely eat here again. The service was very friendly and helpful too! 4/5

Comes with 3 sides (banchan) and rice. 
- kimchi - 5/5 very flavorful and crisp.
- pickled daikon - 4/5 great pickled flavor.

I prefer to drink water with my food but prefer not to buy bottled water when I'm out, so I was very surprised when they offered complimentary filtered water with our meals.

The meat jun was very yummy and came with this delicious sauce. I also had one of the ox bone soup but was a little disappointed since she told me that they had run out of the specific meat but she replace it with kalbi, however, it didn't have any flavor. Like really, NONE! I felt like I was just drinking water and some veggies. Hopefully next time I order that, they will have the right meat in stock!

Side dishes I chose was macaroni salad, broccoli, soy marinated potato and cabbage kimchee. All were good, but I was surprised how much I liked their kimchee.
