Okay no problem ... so when she finally engages and takes my order, never came back to check on me ... but surely enough the patron sitting next to me drink was refilled four times 30 minute lapse and then stops and asked if I want another.

The saving grace was the Laker game was on and the gentleman who works the bar on Monday night was outstanding, hence why I came back to this location.

Hit up this PT's just a few nights ago for an outing with coworkers. We all arrived shortly after 9 PM on a Tuesday night. There were a few patrons at the bar, but other than that the place was empty. It does indeed have a smokey smell, but it looks really clean and new. There are definitely nice place to sit around tables on couches. The bar area is large a well-lit. There are pool tables and a beer pong table.

My friends and I mostly came for the beer/drinks. We sat at a table near the billiards section as many in my group were playing pool and beer pong. 

I was starving, so I actually had to eat. I selected the Jalapeno Sliders, that come with three mini burgers and some french fries. They were quite tasty, not greasy, not overly done. The jalapenos gave them a nice kick. They were good - but everything on their menu seems pretty pricey to me for it being bar food. My sliders were 9 bucks! I don't mean to be a cheap-skate but usually when I see a bar menu there's *at least* a few items around $5-$7. But not on PT's menu.

That said, the music is my only real complaint about PT's. I understand the music is coming from the jukebox. I understand that other customers are selecting what is being played, and that unless I play it, I likely am not going to hear ""my"" music; what I cannot get next to is the fact that, at times, the Bartender turns the music up to levels so absurd that you cannot hear your companions without yelling at one another!

I went in at 4 am a few mornings ago (I think it was Tues/Wed) to get something to eat. I ordered an omelet and wasn't expecting much. As I looked around, I saw that the guy cooking my meal was this older, chubby, scruffy looking guy taking out the trash. I didn't judge, but again, wasn't expecting much. I gambled a little bit to pass the time, and in about ten minutes, one of the best breakfasts I'd ever had in my life was presented to me. The omelet, hash browns, and toast were delicious. Fluffy, tasty, beautifully cooked. The older guy who I'd almost misjudged cooked like an angel. Based on this experience, I knew I'd come back. I almost wanted to go back there and kiss his feet or something. No joke.

Fast forward to this morning (Sunday, June 4, 2017, 4;30 AM)

I ordered the exact same breakfast and was brought out the worst plate of ""food"" I've ever attempted to eat in my 30 years on this planet. The first thing I knew was that the omelet was inedible. I tried, but just couldn't: burnt, sloppy, a disaster. That thing couldn't be served in prison on ANY planet. I'm not joking. So I tried the hash browns and immediately threw them up onto the plate. Question: how could anybody fuck up hash browns THAT bad? They were drenched in some kind of margarine or something. One of the worst aftertastes ever.

Anyway, the bartender was cool enough to notice my awkwardness and offer to refund the whole meal. HE was cool as hell and this experience was not his fault AT ALL.

In all, I would have given this place FIVE STARS a few days ago, and I still might. Just get the masterfully talented old man with the magic hands (who deserves to be king somewhere) to teach everyone else how to cook. Because he's a SAINT.

On that note, I just hit up McDonalds on Sunset to rid my mind of any memory of that plate of dog food I unfortunately just had in front of me. It took an egg McMuffin, HASHBROWN, and a sweet tea to make me feel less nauseous. But I still might puke. If I set foot in my bathroom, I'm pretty sure I'll be tempted. So I'll stay out.

Was worried that this place was closed down when I looked for it on Yelp, and that my trip across town would be a huge waste. My Henderson friends reassured me that they were open, and they were right. 

If this location wasn't so far from my house I would be here every night.",1bKViE447MdvO_r0AiDEJQ,1,1,4,C9XrODhUdQOEwREuGiFVzA

5659830,2011-07-08,3,a2OCO4yHDEifuKzjor_yRQ,"I don't know what it is about Las Vegans and PT's. Without fail, when dinner is mentioned, somebody says, ""Let's go to PT's!"" WHY?! 

On July 3, (7/3/11) we got drenched in the downpour at work. I wanted some hot food after such a crappy shift. I texted my coworker friend Matt to see if he wanted to grab some dinner. Unfortunately, he didn't want Hawaiian or Mexican and this was one of the few places that showed up on Yelp as being sort of a half way point between our houses. GAWD.

This is the third PT's I've eaten at in Las Vegas. It must be a requirement for PT's bartenders to keep people waiting or to ignore them. I went up to the bar, asked for menus and was handed one menu. We decided that we'd split the party bucket of boneless chicken wings in mild sauce. Why so much food? Two individual dinners would run more than $20 whereas a bucket containing just chicken and a lot more of it, would be $18. Obvious choice. Right when we ordered, we were presented with a check - we split the cost and left a tip. I've never been to a restaurant that is only dine-in, that makes you pay and tip before you even get your food. 

When we got the wings, I got that weird crampy feeling in my stomach - the one I attributed to the sauce being crazy hot the last time I was at PT's. This sauce wasn't even spicy and it was hurting my stomach. Clearly there's something else going on. It makes me wonder if they use MSG or soybean oil. No bueno to both!

Asking for a water... geeze. It irks me when I go up to the bar and the bartender is pretending to be busy, fiddling with the register, in a nearly empty restaurant, then walks off to the farthest part of the bar, away from me. What sort of customer service is this? When I've already tipped at least 15% prior to even gettting my meal, I expect not to have to stand at the bar, like a fool, until the waiter decides to come over and take extra long making a simple water. I'm pretty sure it's because they're not likely (with me) to get a tip on a water refill, but still, customer service is severly lacking at ALL PT's.

The next time somebody says they want PT's, my answer will be a resounding ""NO!""",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,1,2,46YZgqVxbGX13Wot3J3y4w
5672244,2014-07-29,0,a2OCO4yHDEifuKzjor_yRQ,"Eat elsewhere. Seriously. $11.99 for three freaking chicken strips and fries! I thought other chicken strip places were expensive, where you get three sauces, bread, a lot more fries, and 6 strips for $9.50. 

The strips are just your standard, frozen, mass produced cuts of chicken, pretty bland and not even worthy as bar food.

The bartender on staff, and kitchen staff that delivered the food were nice, and on point. It's just tough to give PT's any stars when the prices are so damn high.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,2,0,1,0J_-QnystNd-EiLohrrlwg

Whenever I am in the mood for hot chicken fingers, this is my go to spot.

There is something in their sauce that I love. After all these years in Vegas, I still love PT's chicken fingers.

Its a bit smokey as the bar area allows smoking, but I will deal with the smoke for good food!

Definitely recommend for good bar food!",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,14,13,4,tAztcvGmdy99JvHnjXTUoQ
5893182,2015-08-25,0,a2OCO4yHDEifuKzjor_yRQ,"First time at this location. I had high expectations after reading some recent reviews here. 
Draft beer selection is OK and happy hour is half price all drinks, so the jumbo sized brew is a bargain! One bartender was working, which may be the standard on Mondays (??) We had great service and never felt abandoned. The female bartender was friendly and easily joked around which is great. 
I tend to shove PTs at the bottom of the list because of the smoke factor, but it wasn't an issue during this visit. Luckily, most of the customers weren't smoking, but it's to be expected at a tavern! 
I'm more of a PTs Gold/Sierra Gold kinda gal, but would return here if in the area again.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,1,0,3,-doGZvGtghAQgpqhakEFAw
5913922,2016-02-23,1,a2OCO4yHDEifuKzjor_yRQ,"Let me start by saying that I have been a PTs regular all over town, but this location is seriously lacking. I came here tonight with my mom for a bite to eat. We walk in, sit down at a table, and is greeted by the bartender with a smile. She leans over the bar in the direction of our table and asks for our drink order. We order water and Diet Coke, and then since I already knew what I wanted I ordered a pizza. Once we were served our drinks we were not checked on until the pizza came. No biggie, but we could have used refills. Pizza comes out and just by looking at the top, I can tell its burnt. The cheese was bubbling on top, and not in a good way. The slices were black on the bottom and too crispy for my taste. We again were not checked on at all until we were about halfway through leaving the burned chunks on the plate. The bartender finally came over for refills and the check, but didn't ask how the food was. We left the final two pieces that we couldn't eat face down on the pan and when the bartender came back just asked, ""are you done with these?"" She clearly noticed it was burned to a crisp but didn't acknowledge. I now sit at home with an extremely upset stomach texting my mom who is also suffering at her house. No plans to visit this location again.",Bu-Ig31R1amjBZLyq0FICA,4,0,1,KF-NQlIViEZP8UnHIUeX7g
