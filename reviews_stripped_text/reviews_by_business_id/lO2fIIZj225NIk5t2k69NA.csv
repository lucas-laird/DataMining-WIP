My wife and I saw the ads through-out the casino and we came back from Hong Kong two weeks before (could it be close to what we had?!).  

So here goes:

If you are familiar with Cantonese food and HK-style Cha Chaan Tangs (you will know if you are, there is no grey area) here are some things that jumped out at me and my wife (you can jump to your own conclusions).  

- The curry fishballs were expensive, and there was nothing unique or different about them even with the added cost.  This is the same, exact recipe you can find in any Chinatown but the price here jumped out a bit.

- There is a statue of Buddha in the back corner ...  with a stack of 1.00 bills in his palm?? Did he win a slot machine mega bucks pay-out or is he going out clubbing??.  Come on, why bring peaceful Buddha into this?  Can you at least take some of the money and give it to a charity?

- If it matters the menu and Casino advertisements had traditional written Chinese, but the comment card at the end had simplified writing (usually HK-style cafes use 100% traditional but maybe they serve a lot of Mandarin speakers who use simplified).  Neither good nor bad, just noticeable.

- The HK milk-tea was a little too expensive , for both hot and cold options.  Again, any normal Hong Kong cafe will charge maybe 3.00 (and the tea here is the exact same, for a higher price).

Now tell me, people with HK cafe experience, doesn't it sound like they're ripping off the casino patrons because of the casino location and dressed up interior??  

My wife and I just had basic snacks, I think we didn't want to be disappointed with their larger menu items.


Now, for those of you who don't eat this type of food a lot:  Have fun and enjoy this authentic Hong Kong flavor!!  The food isn't horrible, the wait isn't that long (only 2x longer than it should be) and if you're hung over you can enjoy such classics as Egg Tarts, Ham / Spam macaroni combos and even Satay Beef with instant ramen.  I just hope when the bill comes you try not to think about pricing too much.

For me, once here was enough.  Maybe if I become very wealthy and forget I even went here I would be back.

I had the Spicy Duck & Pickled Cabbage noodle soup and it was just the clean dish that I needed after a week of eating fast food on the road. The two main ingredients coincided perfectly. The Thai coffee was just the right balance of sweet and bitter without having one overpower the other. The fried cruller was exceptional and fresh. Needless to say, I'll be stopping by this cafe again when I return to the Vegas. 

The service was good as well since they constantly came over to fill our waters and ask if everything was alright. 

Now, I understand that it can be a little bit pricey but it's understandable since the restaurant is located within the Venetian. Also, it actually has that Hong Kong style/feel to it. Trust me, the food is worth it. Besides, it's not just the good food but the atmosphere that you're getting for the price so I would recommend it.",Fw_9RTvk2GvjuzvnN_qjqQ,0,0,4,-QZe1rUVSnjWcz1n9mWcJA

This was my second time here, last time the pork buns were soggy and wet, so this time I did not order them.

When I did get seated, no one came over to take a drink order, nor food. I was seated in the middle of the restaurant and I had to flag someone down! I finally ordered, and waited, and waited.  People that came in after me, we're getting food (some of the items I ordered) and I still had nothing.

Upscale casual dining with nice atmosphere but a little bit high priced for the quality of food.  I do not recommend their ""chicken"" dishes.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken (a.k.a. chicken with peanut).  
(1) Sauce far too sweet
(2) The most important is that the chicken was not real.  This is the so-called ""rubberized"" chicken, which is a highly processed product and not actual white or dark meat chicken.    

I am over 60 years old and have been eating Chinese food my entire life, including many visits to Hong Kong and main-land China.  This fake chicken dish is by far the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten.  So disappointing.

And if you insist to eat this ""rubberized fake chicken"", you can get essentially the identical dish at Noodle Asia in the Venetian for less money.  But really, this ""fake chicken"" is not even worth eating for free.  Don't waste your money or the calories.

I perused the menu quickly, and as my drink was set on my table, I looked up to order but the waiter had scurried off. No problem.

1267321,2016-01-05,2,lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA,"So, I'm in Vegas for CES 2016 and decided to try this out.  Didn't expect much but then again, I didn't expect the food in this place to be this awful. They have an Asian staff who actually speak Cantonese so I had hopes...which were brutally dashed.  I ordered the Jellyfish appetizer and the Siu Mai.  Both were barely decent but were somewhat passable.

Then I decided to try the ""Singapore Laksa.""  To say that this dish sucks is to insult the whole concept of suckitude.  Okay, it had a halved (!!!) fish ball floating in it along with half a boiled egg, some dried tofu and a couple of shrimp but the soup, the key to a Singapore Laksa, tasted as if somebody had watered it down to colored dishwater, it was so thin and flavorless.  The richness normal to a Singapore Laksa was so beyond totally absent as to be positively ghostly.  Instead of the normal spiciness from the curry and chili along with richness that is imparted by the coconut milk that is characteristic of a Singapore Laksa, this was so bland that it wasn't even salty enough, something that even adding two Chinese soup spoon's worth of soy sauce couldn't remedy.  Just doing a Google search, I came up with multiple recipes for this but what they served bore no resemblance to the real thing.  Not even close.  Not even by a country mile.  I gave up halfway through and ordered a Singapore-style Hainanese Chicken Rice thinking that it's pretty hard to mess that up.  

What a mistake!  What arrived was a disaster.  The chicken tasted wrong, even less tasty than a standard Hong Kong poached chicken. One of the reasons being that it had not been brushed in sesame oil after being poached, a prime requirement for a classic Singapore-style Hainanese Chicken.  And the rice, which should've been heavily boiled in chicken stock, tasted like they boiled it to the point of what the Italians call ""al dente"" and came out translucent instead of white...Hello, ""al dente"" may be good for Italian pasta but where rice is concerned, it doesn't work.  This is not a variation on risotto sans cream sauce.  No, no, no. Then the sauces...oh my god...what utter abominations.  Firstly, a chili sauce that was missing the garlic that is standard for this dish and just plain wrong.  Chili sauce, for the uninitiated, is not interchangeable.  Hainanese Chicken Rice done Singapore style, as this was trying to emulate, has a very distinctive chili sauce.  You *CANNOT* just throw in any old chili sauce to accompany the dish.  Secondly, and most egregiously, the black dipping sauce in a proper Hainanese Chicken Rice is basically thick black sweet soy mixed with thin regular black soy.  It is *NOT* and has never been Oyster Sauce being passed off as ""Gelled Soy Sauce"" (after living for over 20 years in Singapore, I know Oyster Sauce when I taste it, thank you very much--it is *THAT* distinctive)!  The only sauce they got right was the grated ginger sauce (but you'd have to be an outright clod to screw up grating ginger and sticking it in oil!)  To call this ""Hainanese Chicken Rice"" is a beyond bovine manure.  No way in Hell does it even come remotely close to what they're trying to do!  Whomever is in the kitchen here has no clue what Singapore/Malaysian food is and should just stop trying.  Or get a better recipe book instead of just tossing a bunch of ingredients together and hoping that nobody would notice the drastic differences.  Having these dishes on the menu is an insult to the cuisine.

The only things that were decent were the beverages but then considering how easy it is to make Thai Iced Tea from a mix or poured out of a commercially prepared container, it's a no-brainer.  Or, in this case, a no-talent-required job.

Service was good and attentive.  I know the front of the house is not responsible for what the back of the house throws up (!!!) and tries to pass off as ""cuisine"" but perhaps they should just stick to the food this place is eponymously named after and not try to attempt cuisine that they obviously have no clue about.",ROscxHJqNK0lYN4CSF51sA,2,0,1,3ue-B5KCfHgzwchHtnyQvw

It may be because we just had Jasmine at the Bellagio a few days ago and that was the worst Chinese restaurant in the world but this place Hong Kong Cafe is actually pretty good. It's a bit pricy but you have to take into consideration that this is a Hotel restaurant... For the people that are complaining that the service is slow here I dare them to go to Jasmine at Bellagio. By the time the food came out at Jasmine we already had a good nights rest... in comparison to Jasmine this place is much faster.

We had the bbq ribs and they were pretty good and flavorful. 

I do not understand why when I order viet ice coffee, they serve it hot and make me pour it over ice myself. But many other restaurants do that as well.

I would recommend any or all of these items.

The service was all pretty good. I saw some other commenters saying that they felt Chinese customers were getting treated better than white customers, but I'm white and didn't feel any different in the way I was treated. Maybe not all of the staff has great English, but the hostesses and servers all seemed pretty fluent, if not native speakers. Either way, they all seemed like they were doing their best to provide good service regardless of who the customer was.

Overall, it was a pretty good dining experience. It was a little bit on the pricey side for what you get, so I don't feel justified giving it five stars, but that's most likely because it's on the Strip, so I'm not going to rate them too low, either.",1ncHR59kiGqgwOOhIAm8JQ,1,1,4,daJM6FBiMypDasDY92JhIg

It tasted like syrup (sweet sweet sweet) I had to ask for another one. Then they made me another cup, only this time it tasted like water. Honestly, for a HK style restaurant, if you can't make the milktea right, chances are you wont survive for very long. I gave them a star for their service which was decent. 

12/28/16 came here a year later, decided to give them a second chance since it had been awhile since they started and you would think their service would improve. I was wrong...
My friend and I sat down at approximately 12:45pm. We were starving after an intense workout that morning. We ordered our food right away. We then waited and waited. About 30mins later, we were starting to become impatient. We asked the server how much longer it was going to take, without even checking he told us it would take another 5minutes. We then requested that he checked with the kitchen. About fifteen minutes later the guy came back and said the kitchen just starting cooking our food. Are you kidding me? I think the thing that upset us the most was that they did not admit at first they had forgotten about our order. People who came in 15-20 minutes after us got their food way before us. I think that was bad service. 

Although, as a Chinese guy myself, I understand one can't really expect too much from a Chinese restaurant (by that I mean service); being inside a five star hotel/casino, this place really should compare themselves with the other restaurants and making sure their service meet expectations.

It's just put the bad taste in your mouth before food come ... I pass...

Atmosphere: Lively, modern, and intuitive
The decor is a mix of modern, geometric design but with accents of traditional Chinese decor. Very nice and presentable! The place setting was definitely on-point, as well: neat, modern, elegant, and expensive-looking!

Service: Slow
It took a while to get seated, even when the restaurant did not appear busy. After being seated, the servers did take a while to ask for our orders. Not a fan of this service, at all.

Food: I've had better
I ordered a BBQ sandwich with fries. I was very disappointed with my tiny sandwich, which I think was overpriced. The fries were ok: they came warm and seasoned, but nothing out of the ordinary.

Summary: Not worth it! Go to Chinatown for real food.
If you're looking for Chinese/Hong Kong types of foods, you're better off going to Las Vegas' Chinatown. If you're down to appear posh, dine with nice-looking silverware but have slow service and less-than-mediocre food, give this place a shot!",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,0,0,2,TMD5qU5nw7KHMsxqtmr8cQ

3218187,2015-11-30,4,lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA,"It's Thanksgiving day; what am I thankful for? Not the decision to stop at the Hong Kong Cafe for lunch!

For those of you familiar with dining at the Palazzo and Venetian, this is merely a rebranded Zine restaurant.  The interior is a bit different but the menu is mostly the same, with some Hong Kong items added.  I was all about that Vietnamese Satay soup; they don't do it with oxtail anymore, only with Filet.  Whatever, it's super good.  We were also excited about getting some Fried Fish Balls with Curry.  Were is the important term here.

Service was hideously bad! Sat there for a good 15 minutes before our server deigned to come over to ask if we'd like something to drink.  It took another good 15 minutes before he came back to see if we wanted to order food.  Here's the worst part: they weren't that busy and I saw our same server go to three different tables that were not full of white people.  I hate calling this kind of stuff out, but, no lie, he went to a table near us 5 times in the interim between me asking for water and me being able to order food. We had 4 white people; they were 4 Asian people.  Perhaps they were also 'important' or 'high rollers' or whatever; at the end of the day, our money is the same and you, sir, are a shitty waiter.

We finally ordered our food and our waiter, when he comes back to confirm our order, asks if I ordered the Edamame. I say no, no edamame. Fried Fish Balls with Curry.  He says, ""The curry sauce is spicy.""  In my mind: ""I doubt it...""  Out loud: ""Yes, I know.  I like it spicy.  Extra if you can.""  He says, ok and leaves.  It's a good 15+ minutes until I can flag someone else down to refill our water and try to order a beer.  It's Vegas! It's been close to an hour and I have no food and no drinks. WTF?!?!

Food finally comes on the trolley cart and our nice, but totally clueless food runner does not have the Fish Balls, the Kim Chee, or any bowls and spoons for my soup.  We explain this to her.  She comes back a few minutes later with bowls; that is all.  While waiting, we try some of the soup with the chopsticks (we would use them the whole time, but Jim G's mom and friend are with us; they need spoons). The soup is super cold; the noodles are a congealed mess underneath the film that has developed on the top.  The clueless food runner brings the Fish Balls. They are cold and flavorless.  We have totally had enough.

Jim G. goes to find a manager and it even took a good 5+ minutes for her to come by! Michelle, the manager, had the perfect attitude from the beginning.  She was apologetic and wanted to replace everything we had.  Unfortunately, we were at the point where we didn't want to patronize their establishment in any way.  She gladly offered to pay for the two beers we had, plus the food we ordered.  She didn't feel the need to offer to pay for our dining companions' food.  Now, they claimed that their food was fine; but, considering the way the afternoon unfolded, everyone was uncomfortable, and, even with food that is 'fine,' no one dined well.  It would've been an even more generous gesture to pick up the whole bill.  And, our clueless waiter continued to check on the nearby table of non-white people. When he came back to us, he had the gall to ask if we needed something else! We hadn't seen him in more than 40 minutes and the manager had already been by a few times. 

Jim G. and I walked out having had a beer and a few bites of Kim Chee.  With all the options at The Palazzo/Venetian complex, you can be sure that we will never waste any of our time at this dining establishment.  When the food is made well and the servers deign to pay you any attention, you might have a nice time here.  If not, then why pay top dollar to be treated like shit?

Steamed Sole Fish - 4 star.  Simply steamed with ginger and scallions in soy sauce.  I would order this again.  It is the perfect comfort dish after several days of eating out.

Wonton Noodle Soup - 3 star.  Pass this one by.  I suspect the noodles are the dry noodles so they don't taste quite as good.  The wontons were not bad, but not good.

Their service was superb...to an extent.  It was like they knew when to put more water into our glasses w/out us having to flag them down.  They swoop up the empty plates at the right time and move the other plates (like the appetizers) to the center of the table.  It's like they adjust everything just perfect and fill everything perfectly.  As if they read your mind.  They even brought out the check at the right moment.  You know where it's not too soon while you still have food at the table and its not to long from the time you finished your meal.  What was too good to be true was they tried to pick up the bill fold and we weren't ready just yet for it to be picked up.  But it's cool.  Service wise, it was excellent.

Food, I ordered the oven roasted duck with rice.  Excellent.  Can I compare it to the usual spot that I order duck from?  No.  All I can say is that each place has a unique taste/flavor that I cannot compare each to.  The duck here was very flavorful and moist and tender.  

We ordered chicken wings for appetizers, two orders.  For some reason one of the orders was spicier than the other.  One plate my brother and sister took from, when they took a bite they  immediately said, ""oh my g', this is spicy.""  I happen to take from the other plate and for a minute I'm looking at them like, ""What are you talking about?  This isn't spicy.""  So yes, for whatever reason, one set of chicken wings was way spicier than the other.

For dessert we tried their egg tart.  The crust was excellent, IF it had a meat like product in it.  The egg/custard part wasn't all that great.  It wasn't sweet at all.  So if I had to give stars out of five, five being awesome, it would get a one.

Because my friends were craving Chinese food while we were staying at the Palazzo, we all decided to go down to the Hong Kong Cafe.  Given my previous experience at these Chinese restaurants in Vegas (see ""Noodle Shop""), I should have already set my expectation low and steered my friends elsewhere.

When you enter, it is modern and chic with subtle decorative pieces to let you know that you are eating at a Chinese restaurant.  Because it was pretty much empty, we were greeted and seated immediately.  

However, as stated in other reviews, all of the food items are ridiculously overpriced.  I had ordered the Poached Chicken with Ginger Sauce.  Especially priced at $15.95, I was hoping for an entree sized plate but instead was insulted with a paltry two pieces of chicken.  Although the dish was flavored okay, it does not come with rice which you have to pay an extra two dollars for.   You are better off getting the Hainan Chicken with Rice which my friend got.  It is basically the same thing and you get a bigger mound of rice than what you would get from the side of rice.

Keep in mind that this place charges twice the normal price you'd pay at any standard Chinese restaurants in suburbia USA. I get it, it is not cheap to be paying rent inside The Palazzo. And for the chow fun, and fried rice dish, it is not the best Chinese in the world, but far from the worst. From a bang for the buck value, it is rather poor. But it goes with the territory when you have Chinese food at any restaurants on the strip.

After we finished both our dishes, the haw gow finally showed up. This is where it gets good. It looks the part, it feels the part (it sure is hot to bite into), but boy, when they say the proof is in the pudding, well, for this, the proof is in the shrimps inside. It hardly tastes like shrimps! It lacked the freshness of a steamed shrimp dumpling, it is soft to the bite, and tastes more like ground shrimps, if we can even call that shrimp. And the best part of it all? $7 for this order of haw gow. $14 for two. 

Last but not least, at this time, we were tired and annoyed by this particular order, and just wanted to be done with it. The bill came, and my friend picked up the tab, he told the waiter, ""here you go"", handing him the cash, expecting to get the change back, so we can get going. Well, the waiter, decided that whatever my friend handed him was going to be his mandatory tip, and he never returned to the table with the change. And yes, I was there, when I heard specifically that nothing correlates to ""there you go, keep the change"", or ""I'm good here"". The fact that the waiter just decided that this was going to be his tip for the night, made this restaurant by far the worst place I had visited in quite some time. $7 haw gow we can take, mystery shrimp bits we can take, to just award yourself some tips, that is not the way to conduct your business.

So, you've been forewarned. You may not have good food, which can happen from time to time, but the bad service is unparalleled unlike any other. You'd be better off eating at the other two establishments at The Palazzo for late night snacks. Stay far, far away with a 10 ft pole if you can.

Apparently they renovated it (maybe a slight make over) but it still looks roughly the same.  We went and had a late night (1am) meal and found the place empty.
Ambiance:  Brightly lit and decent decor.  The restaurant appears more open than before. Like I mentioned, pretty empty at 1am.
Service:  Since we were the only one there, it was pretty good.  Hostess explained the menu and stated that 75% of Zine's menu was the same.  The rest was a new asian/hongkong/fusion type of offering.  Waiter came right away and took our drink orders.  Food came out quite fast.  Overall, service was decent.
Food:  We went with the basic fried rice, a crispy egg noodle, and a wonton soup.  The soup wasn't terribly hot (one of my pet peeves) but had decent flavor.  The crispy noodle was something that I had never had and I thought it was interesting.  I would probably order the pan fried noodles or chow mein next time.  The fried rice was on point.  Good flavor and lots of meat.
Value:  Because it is located in Palazzo, this place is terribly over priced.  Almost $20 for fried rice is a terrible rip off.  But hey, when you need or want food at 1am, you can't be choosy.",pJUzdorsC5BpC3q5ECi4Lg,2,1,4,kjHGI68lLyHoD1dyTFd3QQ

It's a huge portion, so I go through most of it.  If I wasn't sick, I no doubt could polish it off.  My partner had the Kung Pao Chicken - it was $24 for a medium size plate and $3 extra for rice - pretty pricey considering the HUGE soups ranged from $16-18 and worth it for the size.  Drinks are $12 a crack for the fancy things.  I had the hot tea - also good.  We tried the chicken wings for an appetizer...needed some sauce in my opinion, but decent.  The service - trying really hard, but still getting their sea legs.  Brought my partner's meal and mine showed up maybe 5 minutes later...not a good thing.  I'd go back though for soup only.

4894087,2016-02-15,0,lO2fIIZj225NIk5t2k69NA,"My hubby really really wanted to try this place when he saw it was new. We're from the Bay Area, so I just figured this would be overpriced Chinese food that wouldn't be good. However, I decided to humor the hubby and try this place, to cheer him up after a rough gambling weekend. Plus, we had tried Noodle Asia at the Venetian before and that place wasn't so bad. 

We show up at 11:05am, and there's a line outside...because although they had opened at 11am and the restaurant is mostly empty, they're staggering the seating of customers, which I assume is to avoid overwhelming the kitchen. Well, that plan didn't work out for them. After a 15 minute wait, we are seated, and then wait oh, another 45 minutes for our food to come out after ordering. 45 minutes! I was starving and we had to head to the airport soon. We were not the only customers complaining about the wait. I saw another irate customer asking where his food was and that he had a flight to catch. Also during this wait, they come out twice to tell us items we have ordered are unavailable ($6 Vietnamese iced coffee) or sold out (rice rolls in XO sauce). tl;dr: a LOT of waiting, don't come here if you have to be somewhere else in the next 2 hours. This is NOT a quick meal.

Oh right, the food was just ok, and this is after they had been starving me for close to an hour so everything should have been delicious since I was so hungry. We had the baked chicken with spaghetti ($18), seafood curry (I was worried the scallops were undercooked) with spaghetti ($19), and rice rolls with shrimp ($9). Portions were decent. Overpriced ($6 HK style milk tea anyone?), but as expected in a hotel like Palazzo or Venetian.

One star reviews are reserved for an especially heinous experience. This was just a pretty bad time, but the food wasn't horrible. However, I won't be returning. As I was leaving, I wanted to tell all the people in line to not waste their time, because it will waste a lot of it. It's likely an issue with the kitchen not being able to keep pace with the orders for some reason. I know this place is new, but after 3+ months, they should have gotten their act together. 

p.s. Bring your own bottled water. Their jasmine tea (which was $2.95/person, even though we shared one pot...this isn't a dim sum lunch!) tasted funny. It might have been the way Vegas tap water tastes when boiled?

p.p.s. I could have gone off strip and had red velvet pancakes at Babycakes and returned in the same amount of time this horrible experience took. Stupid me for thinking this would be a faster meal.",ikilCPJZypZHwSNRU6oT_A,2,0,2,zYfEsrx1DeAfT0UnVqwj0g

I ordered the Spicy Laksa Lemak, a Malay dish that is supposed to be a spicy curry sauce over noodles and seafood. What I received was a bowl of noodles with coconut broth and seafood and fried tofu. It had no flavor at all. I put half the bowl of chilies from the table in it and still couldn't taste any flavor. My table mate said that her curry chicken noodles also had no flavor.

I didn't get to check out the Yelp reviews of this place before entering (which I normally almost always do!), but am glad that I didn't because I probably would have tried to skip the place.

First off, I loved the ambience of the place.  I mean, come on... your typical Chinese spot is never this clean and modern.  The décor is pretty, airy with tall ceilings, and it felt nice inside.  The workers were kind and really attentive to our table and the manager went around a couple of times to make sure everything was OK.  After reading some reviews on the bad service, I was actual a bit surprised since our service was exceptional.  My guess is that they are trying hard to turn a bad rep around?

Being in a restaurant inside the Palazzo, I already expected the prices to be higher than normal.  And yes, not gonna lie... they were higher!  They ranged from maybe a couple bucks higher than what you would normally pay, to almost double.  Being that it was a work lunch though, I wasn't too concerned about the pricing  and because of that, I was able to try a variety of food. 

·        Macau Style Roasted Pork Belly - YES.  Get this... one of the best things we had for lunch... just like Filipino lechon and decently priced for the place

·        Roasted Duck - portion size good, very tender, and good flavor

·        Seafood Pan Fried Noodle - I always get pan fried noodles every time we do Chinese.  This was good and had huge pieces of seafood. Comparable to most Chinese spots.

·        Fried Rice - Huge pieces of shrimp, much appreciated!  Good flavors.

·        Shu Mai, Crab Rangoon, Spring Rolls - Standard fare 

·        Pepper Crusted Beef Tenderloin - YES.  Melts in your mouth.

·        Walnut Shrimp - the shrimp was huge, but the portion size was a bit small. 

·        Rice Roll with XO Sauce - A huge rice noodle roll with XO sauce, can't go wrong.

Overall, I would consider this a solid place for Chinese food if you're already on the strip.  For better VALUE, I would maybe drive down Spring Mountain to China Town where you could get similar food for cheaper.

It's late...you're craving something soupy after all the drinking and the closest spot to you at the hour at Palazzo Hotel through the casino is this joint. 
It was't that horrid as you'd expect...

Desperate time calls for desperate measures, you go in KNOWING that it wont hit the spot if you're craving for that Vietnamese soupy cravings...so if you go in with low expectations, you're kinda right...

It was give or take around midnight that we had dropped in for something soupy. There was probably another 3 parties there. The place is pretty spacious, with lots of seating so I'm thinking it wouldn't be too long of a wait even if it was crowded. Service was alight, they checked on us when we needed to be and they were all very nice.

- OVERPRICEDDDD. each item ranged $17+, even the appetizers.FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYONE. NEVER ORDER THE APPETIZER SAMPLER...

- Flavor was KIND OF there, probably a slight hint of the flavors of each dish with a  a bunch of MSG to actually mask the blandness. 

- IF YOU WANT FLAVOR...and probably the most decent dish we tried out of the 6 that we ordered, get the SCHEZUAN BEEF NOODLE. I do not remember what it is called exactly, but you get it.

For a really-nice-casino restaurant, one would expect to have a great meal.  Or even a good meal...  
No. 
This was not even close.

Service was slow and we sat at he table for 7 minutes before we were greeted. And another 10 minutes to get our waters and hot teas. 
Appetizer of Vietnamese egg rolls was extremely bland. 
I also go the beef pho. 
Both extremely bland and lacking in any hint of a tasty flavor. None. 
I eat at a Vietnamese restaurant in my jibe town of Euless, TX that blows this away. For half the price!

My mom loved the Rice Roll with X.O. Sauce from the new menu, and they have a lot more menu selections to choose from, such as the Clay Pot Rice that my dad loves, and my son loved the Oven Baked Fish with Spaghetti. Thank heaven! Now the new menu has something that everyone in the family loves; no need to run between restaurants to feed the kids anymore. We will definitely return for more.",ZJPdG_-Qw7p6oNYRMF0jtg,0,0,5,REy3_sBLLE9Dipk33VzU3g

I stayed half time at the Palazzo Hotel this time and CES 2017. Hong Kong Cafe is just downstairs from the guests elevator to the right. 

I came in mid-day during CES, so it wasn't busy at all. Service was excellent though, very attentive, and the food cane out quickly.

The menu is more like a noodle house, a little bit of Thai, Vietnamese, but mainly Chinese noodle soup and Din Sum.

- Shiu Mai pork & shrimp dumplings was good.

- Vietnamese Saté Beef Noodle Soup was generous, gigantic bowl, lots of veggies. I was surprised to see tomato and cucumber slices in the bowl. That's not authentic Vietnamese dish. The broth wasn't good. Too much noddles in the bowl. Nice try on the dish but it didn't work for me. 

Because it's at a Vegas resort, expect a bowl + tax = $20. 

The place is beautifully devoted, good service, but the food fail short.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,15,9,2,VX3zO9t_TzmhPRNXW0IpFA

I had the honey walnut shrimp - huge shrimp, perfectly cooked, and the sauce was amazing. Not the gross 'sweet mayonnaise' that so many places slather on this dish, but an actual decent sauce. Nicely candied walnuts, and a good number of them.

My husband had the beef chow fun, and it was also great. Very flavourful, good cut of beef (so often the beef is a tough, chewy cut), and the noodles were thick and chewy, like they're meant to be.

The servers were all very attentive - perhaps because we were one of only 5 tables - but we really enjoyed our dinner here.",XYxDcLK1fZvxDgVsiqtDbA,0,0,4,r4SE5VxPpsDGfFAVNuTaCA

Told them to get happy in the kitchen because I would not send it back if it were too hot. The flavor was awful almost like a burnt taste like the oil was old. And NOOOOOOOO heat at all. Spicy is comfort food for me. There was nothing there at all. The service was good so that is why I give a two. For the food, it would be a zero. I love pad thai so I know what it is supposed to taste like and I have a special heat named after me back home so spice is not an issue. This was just mild and awful. Good portions. Just wish the food was good enough to not leave a plate full of food...didn't want a box and now I am going to find a burger because I am still hungry",Rx4IugMRCVlrOF8P4viUKg,1,0,2,XFWQLUwKwo8h4QUQ6JT5PA
