28223,2014-05-17,0,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,"Currently this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. The portions are generous and the food is amazing.  Unlike some other restaurants, the mongolian beef here was seared and tender and was not full of chewy grizzle.  The kung pao chicken was also very good and came with a lot of crunchy peanuts on top instead of being mixed in and soft. The  woman who took our order at the counter was also very nice.

I've tried every place in a radius from W. Lake Mead north Tulley Springs and from Buffalo east to NLV. Never finished a meal at any. Stumbled here thanx to the reviews.
 
I always test a new place with wonton soup (oh my, the real NY style crispy noodles), chow fun, beef and broccoli, and pork fried rice. Hard to believe any Chinese place could mess these up. but they have. The broc was bright, fresh and crisp, and the beef lean and tender. The soup was packed w/ fresh veggies and tasty quality dumplings. The fried rice, how can they afford to give so much, it will feed me for a week.

Ordered over phone and had it delivered. Okay now this review might start to sound fake, cause I ain't foolin 35 mins. later it was piping hot at my door. No s-- t. i have waited up to 90 min in this town for my food to be delivered. Losing not only my sanity but my appetite. Both the driver and the order taker was very friendly.

They serve both Chinese and Japanese fare and the price is comparable to other restaurants in the area.

433080,2012-12-04,1,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,"Chop Chop Wok is as good as it gets for me as far as Chinese food is concerned. I feel it is more of a 4 1/2 star place, but I had to round up because they are just so pleasant here & when you are waiting on an order, they will actually walk it out to your car. Now that is like Nordstrom/Nob Hill type service right there! Btw, Nob Hill is an upscale grocery store in NorCal & I know all my NorCal peeps will get that reference ;)

So...the food is really tasty here & the ingredients are nice & fresh. The beef broccoli is some of the best I have had. The beef is really quite good. Not at all like that weird tasting & texturally displeasing mystery meat usually found in this dish. And the broccoli is nice & crunchy & has a nice fresh, bright green look to it. I also LOVE the Lo Mein! Lol, which is actually Chow Mein, at least where I'm from. Either way, it is on point. They also have really good lunch specials & you definitely cannot beat the prices here.

I am SUPER picky when it comes to Chinese food & I will not just go anywhere. There has to be some sort of buzz or word of mouth about a place before I will try it. So, I would like to thank all of my fellow Yelpers that helped me decide on trying Chop Chop Wok. And to the staff, I think you all are great & you treat people with great warmth & friendliness.

I wish however that they had an eggplant dish but nonetheless i would still opt to go here!

OK so apparently I started this review a year ago, but I would like to add that nothing has changed over the past year I have come here numerous times. Kind of funny and yet creepy but my name must pop up in their computer when I call because they know my name (think ""Norm"" from Cheers - and yes I realize I am dating myself).

I literally lived out of this place when I was living on my own. The main girl that is up front is the sweetest person ever and I never have any problems with my order. I'm kind of picky and I always ask to replace my rice with steamed broccoli and most places always give me the run around, say they don't do that or tell me its going to cost extra (which makes not sense considering its easier to steam broccoli then it is to fry rice). Anyways, by now they know me and I always order orange chicken w/ steamed broccoli. The best part about it is it's never soaked in all the juices that come with your food and it's actually made like no other Chinese place I've seen here in Las Vegas. The restaurant decor isn't to die for, but I really love it and think it's a cute, little ""hole in the wall"" place that everyone should definitely try out.

1294460,2012-12-25,0,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,"I really wanted to like this place more than I did based on all the effusive reviews.  First off, this place is a reasonable drive, over 12 miles from the house so it can't be considered part of the home territory.  We ordered the vegetable lo mein, chicken lo mein, sesame chicken and wor won ton soup.  Calling slightly ahead it was ready when we arrived and the lady at the counter was very sweet and wished us a happy holiday.  

The experience when we got home was okay, but nothing like what we expected based on others opinion and the fact that there were quite a few people eating in when we walked in.  

The sesame chicken was very salty and the lo mein slightly more watery and sweet than I like.  The soup was also very salty and so hot that it suffers from the same symptoms of other Chinese take-out soups:  limp soft vegetables and won ton noodles disassembling.  It still puzzles me.  You'd think they'd have tried planning out how much they cook everything before it goes into the take-out container.  I liked the shrimp and the won ton filling was good but I wouldn't order it again.  On the plus side, the prices here are some of the lowest I've seen for Americanized Chinese dive food.  

Oh well.  The quest continues.",Yf0JwS-Zr2DQlk73TDzVLA,0,0,3,2FGR5VN0V-D1gVA78vj9Kw

Granted, I'm a native San Franciscan who grew up with Mandarin, Szechwan, and Cantonese restaurants all within a few blocks of each other. The Vegas Chinese food scene continues to bore and disappoint at any price point. Yawn. Like I said I really wanted to like this place. The owner is so nice and really trying hard to make a go of it. The prices are ridiculously low. I walked out with 7 pounds of food for $22. 3 large entrees and steamed rice. For value, you get a lot for a little $. I felt guilty paying so little so I tipped her well. 

Sweet and sour pork. Bleh. Obviously frozen pork, cheap voluminous breading and anemic peppers on the side. Pass.

Chicken fried rice. The clear winner. Inexpensive and would order again. 

Szechwan garlic chicken. Looked better than it tasted. Broccoli frozen prior to cooking, garlic non existent, and the sauce was more tasteless than Panda Express (the King of spewy Chinese food in my snobby opinion). 
No dim sum to be seen. 
Too bad.

We went based on the sheer fact that they were open later than most Chinese restaurants in the area. The antiquated blue interior was uneasy on the eyes, but it was clean. 

They have great combo specials served all day for $6.95. Not a bad deal at all! This is a great spot for lunch and dinner at bargain prices. You can also choose your entree size: small (under $6) or large (under $10). They offer generous portions, so we would try small next time. 

The good:
Crab Rangoon $4.25 - 6 large pieces of crispy golden fried wontons stuffed with cream cheese. Very addicting! We enjoyed it with their sweet and sour sauce. 5/5

Hot and sour soup - we ordered a small $1.60 and it was piping hot and the perfect size to share. Great flavor! 5/5

Moo shu pork served with eggroll wrappers and hoisen sauce - we ordered a large $8.25 and it was a very generous serving. It had mushrooms, cabbage, pork, and bamboo shoots. It was a great version and we really enjoyed this flavorful dish. 5/5

The bad:
Sweet and sour pork - ok, so we definitely took the wrong step with this dish. We ordered a large $8.25 and although the portion was massive, each pork morsel had way too much breading. Just imagine the dough on corn dogs...each pork was excessively covered in thick dough. Way too filling, in a bad way. It was bland as well, so we added salt to the sauce and it helped. Also, they barely gave us any vegetables and pineapple, so overall it wasn't a balanced dish.

I came in with a specific to go order with a few special requests and the clerk who helped me was awesome, not only was he helpful but didn't seem the least flustered. I certainly appreciate great service, as to the food, it was great.

Mongolian beef: great flavor, nice amount of heat but not overwhelming. The dish does have a lot of vegetables like other reviewers mentioned but that's not a huge deal for me, especially since they were cooked well and added to the flavor.

Sweet and sour pork: I wasn't really used to seeing the sauce on the side, but that won't deter me from ordering again. When dipped into the sauce it all came together well and it lets you add as much or as little as you like. It also has the added bonus of not making the breading soggy.

Hot and sour soup: lives up to its name in a good way, a flavorful broth with a nice ratio of tofu, mushrooms and pork.

Egg flower soup: I'm not a fan of this in general so I skipped it, but my wife enjoyed it.

Pork fried rice: one of the best I've ever had, not over loaded with vegetable and full of big chunks pork in every bite.

Although their sweet & sour chicken and pork is the stereotypical radioactive red sauce and over-battered meat, it's still good.  Who doesn't like that kind of crap once in awhile?

As for their other menu items, everything is good to go.  My husband digs their egg foo yong a lot and I love their beef with broccoli.  We ordered six dishes for 30 bucks, and they don't have a delivery charge, so we tip generously.

Great service, great food for a lazy night.  I can't say that I'm a fan because it's not something I'll order every week, but it's decent chinese food in the west side.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,3,1,3,iBpccCHYFwaUQDPp0QGF-w

The Mongolian beef was okay.  Same problem.  Very little meat buried in a huge pile of onions.

Due to the Las Vegas summer heat killin' my brain, I'm gonna try to keep this one short today.  

All I can say is...$2.99 special for an order of chicken fried rice!  Deal!

Yes, and this chicken fried rice from Chop Chop Wok is pretty killer.  So good!  Theirs has a genuine 'fried' taste to it and I'm pretty sure the chicken is marinated.  Goes great with a side of kim chee and an ice cold beer.  Complete meal!

Chop Chop Wok is located close to my home, and has some of the better Chinese food in my area.  This place is more for take out, so don't bring a party of 50 or more!  All they have for seating is several small tables and a few tables that sit between 4-6 people.  Chop Chop Wok is definitely a small Mom & Pop type joint.  And with just the one nice lady running the entire front area, it is such.  We all know these little hole-in-the-wall places can offer up some good eats!

The menu at Chop Chop Wok is a mix of Chinese and Japanese.  Everything from rice and noodles is available, even the usual suspects of Mongolian Beef, Egg Foo Young, and Kung Pao Chicken are there.  Chop Chop Wok goes above and beyond by also including some Japanese flair, sushi rolls are available as well as bentos!  There are weekday specials that start at $4.95, saving you some cash for your stash.  For that small amount of change you get soup, an entree, fried rice, and an egg roll.  Not bad!  They also offer combo plates for just south of $7.  You can get out of Chop Chop Wok with a fully belly and a still full wallet!

I'll have to be honest, I haven't tried much on the Chop Chop Wok menu.  Mainly because my usual stop is there for the $2.99 special chicken fried rice for a snack!  But I've seen many of the dishes come out of the kitchen for eat-in patrons and it does look fresh and tasty.  Nothing sitting in a buffet tray under a heat lamp!  I've heard folks eating here say that the food is pretty good, and the prices are good as well.  I promise to try more stuff here soon!  Until then the cheap chicken fried rice will be calling my name.

Portions were big and they used lots of fresh vegetables.

Lately, I have seen some small local restaurants, that have only one person taking care of everything: answering the phone, taking take out orders, and acting as a server (bring out food, filling up drinks, etc.). I don't understand why they insist in offering service for dine-in. I wish they would opt out of that and let customers order at the register. That would make things so much easier and faster.

Quite simply put, I was worried while waiting for my food.  I did not notice when I first walked in that the place was filthy.  Half of the tables were unwashed.  One had a high chair that a baby had been sitting in and it showed.  There was food all over the place. Tables and floors alike.  Another table still had old dried up rice all over it and a wiping rag just sitting there.  Tables don't wipe themselves.  To top it off there was a man working on the beverage fridge.  Thats fine right?  Wrong.  He was crawling up underneath it and using an acetylene torch.  I could smell it every time he sparked it on and I could hear loud pops every time he turned it off.  It was crazy.  This flame in such a small area was getting very close to the 2-liter bottles stored back there.  It was kind of scary.  I thought the place was going to blow up.  It seems inappropriate to be using a torch during dinner hours and so close to the dining room.  

As for the food, I ordered from the Japanese side for a change.  A chicken katsu bento box with white rice, a salad and fried shumai.  The shumai threw me.  I would expect gyoza in a bento box faster than I would shumai.  Don't get me wrong.  The shumai was fine.  Just not what I would expect.  The katsu was superbly crispy.

The ""ice"" in the iceberg lettuce must have melted because that salad of nothing but iceberg lettuce was floating in a pool of water.  Luckily I did not go in there for a salad so I was not sorely disappointed.  

I don't know if or when I will be back to Chop Chop Wok.  I do like there food more often than not but after what I saw while waiting 20+ minutes for take out, I'm not sure how they have an ""A"" rating.

4364107,2012-08-01,3,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,"What is it about Las Vegas and its lack of good Chinese takeout? Are there cosmic Asian forces at work that keep finger-licking Kung Pao chicken or delectable broccoli beef far way from our boozy, desert collective, or are all the solid Chinese chefs locked in at proper sit-down restaurants on the Strip? 
Regardless of why the sleeping dragon of delicious Chinese takeout has never awoken in our little corner of the Mojave, I had high hopes for Chop Chop Wok.
Reading the reviews here on Yelp convinced me - dare I say - that might have finally found THE spot. You know, the kind of solid New York City-style takeout joint whose Mongolian beef melts in the mouth. Where the sweet-and-sour chicken is a stack of crunchy, honeyed bonbons of poultry goodness. Where the rice sucks you down into pillowy rivers of starch so delicious that you never want to come up for air.
Man, did I have another thing coming.
Chop Chop Wok, unfortunately, is like a lot of neighborhood Chinese takeout joints here in Vegas: That is to say, it's run by a small coterie of smiling, accommodating folks ... who haven't the slightest idea how to turn out tasty dishes that trace their roots far back into the misty history of the Middle Kingdom.
Which is a shame, because the folks at Chop Chop Wok ARE friendly. They provide stellar customer service. It's just that once you get your coveted, white-paper takeout boxes home and dive inside you realize you'd have gotten closer to great Chinese takeout had you just gone to middle America's favorite, P.F. Chang's. 
We tried a variety of dishes, but everything from the egg rolls to the crab rangoons to the beef and chicken dishes disappointed. 
We're sorry, Chop Chop Wok. You're a bunch of truly nice people. But for those of us who've managed to find great Chinese takeout from Manhattan to the Midwest, we were hoping for so much more.",eCErX2uz7AVmYuZu30CBvA,2,1,2,JaU9nwvNqxd76uzCY09hJA

5000860,2014-11-11,0,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,"I came here initially when I was in the area visiting a friend.  I had been looking for an American Chinese restaurant since moving to Vegas this past summer, and after trying about five other places, this has been by far the best. Now please be aware, this is not authentic Chinese food. If you are looking for that type of food, I would recommend taking a gander around Chinatown. What this is is phenomenal American Chinese food (think Panda Express-type food, but not sickening). 

The past two times I've gone, I've ordered the lemon chicken, the pork and green beans, the beef and green beans, the moo shu pork, the fired rice, lo mein, crab rangoons, and the eggrolls. In my defense, a majority of the food is a part of the $7 combo special, which gives you SO MUCH FOOD. That's another thing: the prices are phenomenal, and the portions are so big! The pork in the sting bean combo was a bit dry, but the beef was so good. Like, the best American Chinese beef I've hand in a long time. Also, the string beans are so very good. Nice and crunchy, and covered with a delicious sauce. The pork fried rice that comes with the combo is also better than the lo mein, but the lo mein is also really good. The moo shu pork was also great, but I wish they would have given me more wrapers because they gave me so much of it even for the small (which was only $6). 

The service was also really great. The service was attentive, and the place was really clean. Tiled floor to ceiling, but I'm not really expecting much from the decor of a strip-mall American Chinese place. That being said, the service review might be a little biased, since my friend and I were the only people actually sitting down in the restaurant, but other people came in and got take out, so they obviously thought the food was something to try.  

If this is the kind of Chinese food you're looking for, I would definitely recommend Chop Chop Wok. While it is definitely not the best American Chinese food I've ever had (I grew up in Oakland, and went to college in LA), I personally think that it's the best I've had since moving to Vegas.

I got their mongolian beef which was pretty good. It was tender and the sauce was nice on it. The BF general tso didn't fare as well though. The sauce was rather thick, almost gelatinous so the texture was a put off for him and so he ate some of my food instead. The fried rice that came with it was decent and was not overly greasy, eggroll and rangoon was standard and crunchy even though it traveled home. 

I would say like any take out, there is hit/miss but with these prices I'd say to give it a try and navigate some of the recommendations on other reviews.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,3,3,50XozvJavdT2236jOZYj3g

Chicken fried rice: nicely cooked chicken chunks with some fried egg along with chopped veggies added in.  The rice was properly cooked and adds a nice addition to the meal.

Orange Beef: One of my only gripes is that it was kinda tough.  Required some additional chewing, but had a nice delicate orange flavor with some orange peel present.

5673278,2017-10-12,0,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,"I have seen mixed reviews here on yelp. I must give 5 stars. I dined in. I ordered the lunch special Mongolian Beef. It came with soup. I had the hot and sour. For a lunch special it was a huge bowl. It was better than a lot of other places I have went to. The Mongolian Beef was excellent. It came with fried rice and an egg roll. And it surprisingly came out on a real plate not styrofoam. Amazing. It was only $5.95.  The staff was great. Super friendly. I believe they own it. You can usually tell the owners from the staff. It was a great experience and I will be back. 
Oh BTW. It was the only lunch special I have not been able to finish. I had to take the rest to go. You will not believe how much food you get for the price.",IAq1_6kwzG0eksSVqVePBw,1,0,5,e9RDdcWlOe-1NHxZYSK3Ug

5737617,2017-10-16,0,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,"The Chinese food scene is really good in Las Vegas, but Karen and I have a favorite take-out joint and it's definitely Chop Chop Wok.

We probably order from here at least once a month, but probably a little more. In over 15-20 orders, they have never once screwed up an order and always get our custom orders correct. Recently we placed a take-out order on our way home from the airport. On takeout orders, give them a 15-minute head start when you want to pick your food up. We always order by phone and they are a great help and efficient.

On this order, we ordered a large portion of their General Tso's chicken. It's huge and we usually get 3 meals out of the chicken. The entree comes with white steamed rice, but for this order, we also purchased a small chicken fried rice. Their standard fried rice comes with your choice of meat, egg, onion, peas & carrots. I always get mine without the peas & carrots.

Karen is a huge fan of the hot & sour soup (with extra crispy noodles). This visit we got a small order.

All in all, for quick, tasty & great value in Chinese takeout, you should definitely stop in at this Northwest location.",Wai-fQ4YouL7Rys6k3MpkA,2,0,5,Z5q_7_vsDIwk1JyCvA79lw

It is really good on its own, but I like to add a little bit of soy sauce on it, just my personal preference. Pot stickers and vegetable rolls are good too.

5753748,2013-01-31,0,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,So I decided to come try chop chop wok. This place was actually better than I anticipated. I ordered the mongolian beef. The beef was very flavorful and tad bit spicy. But spicy is always good in my book. The portion size for the price is good. The staff here is very nice and helpful in helping you decide if you have never been here before. I really didnt like that my mongolian beef had way to much onions and not much beef.  I give this place a solid 4 stars. I enjoyed my food but had to dig for my beef in a forest of onions and serrano peppers.,jbqTVD_gqm996hvN9op3_g,0,0,4,wgp_EFG8pmuD2otTH3NRpA

They are serving some great Chinese Food and even some above average Sushi.

We shared the Godzilla Roll and it was delicious.  Not a lot of rice filer and the spicy tuna was fresh and flavorful.

For my dinner I had the shrimp Lo Mien and asked for it to be a little spicy. It was awesome but could have used a few more shrimp and vegetables. Still think its in my top two or three for Lo Mien in Vegas

The daughter loved her beef broccoli and is looking forward to leftovers tomorrow night.

5945025,2014-06-16,0,t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg,"I decided to go again at it. 
I have a reason for only my 4 stars this time.

The order : hot and sour soup small $1.50, pan fried dumplings$4.95 ish and a order general tso chicken $ i think it was 5.95 and also they do carry 2 liter and can drinks for delivery I didn't know this before hand. 

Hot and sour - great as always and one heck of a value at $1.50 

Pan Fried Dumplings- really good I can taste a little ginger or something I couldn't point out but really good same with sauce.

General Tso' Chicken - always cooked to perfection however this time it was heavily garlic tasting I am Italian so I can handle garlic, but to some people that might be considered way tooo much. The first time I got it, it was amazing like this time it was crispy etc.. however just sightly overly garlic 

I will be back and back even with this small thing, the food is always good here. I don't like recommending places off of one visit but this is a second time and the food quality is really great. And to correct my over stated dessert menu they do serve some type of donuts ? I am not sure what kind will probably try next time. 

They should put on there website that they carry 2 liter or can products because there online menu at there website doesn't mention any drink products.",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,3,1,4,_K9O5S_ZlUVpg0VH8_vvbg
