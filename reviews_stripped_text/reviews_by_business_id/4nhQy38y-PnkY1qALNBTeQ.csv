Vegetables with it though... well... some of the veggies were just too salty. Then there was this marmalade like mixture of carmelized bell peppers, and I couldn't eat them. I don't know what it was, but they were so intensely flavored, the most intensely flavored peppers I've ever eaten, too intense. Not hot, they were bell peppers, but intense. I can't describe it. My wife liked them, but I couldn't eat them. I won't call them bad, but definitely unique. 

For desert we had an orb of icecream, which was good, but it is hard to mess up gelato. Having been to Rome last summer I cannot say that it was any better than what is sold on the street there, but it was a nice presentation. 

The wife had a pasta & cream sauce dish which she said she liked. 

We'd probably return if we were at the Rio or seeing Penn & teller.

1802184,2008-12-10,0,4nhQy38y-PnkY1qALNBTeQ,MY FAVORITE HIGH CLASS RESTAURANT. I am absolutely obsessed with the 5 Cheese Macaroni dish. It has bleu cheese in it that just makes my mouth melt thinking about it. Great selection of wine also. Fabulous service and comforting atmosphere. I will always stop here when I'm in Las Vegas.,Jj8LQ4D69ZrI6MioNTKKYw,0,0,5,nyAdSjdxAcGOyJFKJWKrrQ
2866927,2008-09-04,0,4nhQy38y-PnkY1qALNBTeQ,"Delicouss foood but took SO long to come out!  The calamari was average.  The bread was a great surprise---crunchy breadsticks, olive, sundried tomato rolls (yummm) and sourdough served with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  All of the entrees were delicious--esp the orrechiette w/HUGE butterfly shrimp, scallops, broccoli rabe in a pink vodka sauce.  Prices were $22-28 for entrees but the quality of the ingredients were well worth it.",yyI3fTGSRgrNSaSVTqMV0A,0,0,4,wBZVh2CbsxHzlQTVG8HNbg

Also, we ordered their souffle for dessert, which came with a deliciously light cream.  And they brought out a ricotta cheesecake for my dad's birthday.  He was livid about the candle and the song, but he ate the dessert anyway.  Surprise, surprise...",zA12DnH8zntG3HzXpmrYBg,1,2,5,JT6o9ZXx5TFP0P3hMk0Hnw

The restaurant is in the Rio. I was a lured in by the big black awning with the flashing lights that blinked ""Antonio's"" The acoustics are much better than I expected. They have the high ceilings with the painted clouds but managed to make it feel intimate and cozy. We were seated at a table away from the beautiful open kitchen. There were plenty of cozy booths. Maybe it was because I had low expectations of a generic Italian restaurant experience but I was really blown away by my risotto. 

I had the Carnaroli Risotto with Maine Lobster. It was the best risotto I've ever had. It had asparagus with a white truffle cream. It was the perfect consistency for risotto and it was perfectly seasoned.

Antonio's is definitely on my list of the 1st places to visit when I make it back to Vegas.",FW6bJFnbhJgfXSnGd6djDA,4,3,5,-rzyGBO-VqP8HrUfQddOUA
5423122,2008-07-31,1,4nhQy38y-PnkY1qALNBTeQ,"Decent little place to have dinner, it wasn't busy at the time we arrived(early) - we didn't have a reservation, and they seated us promptly which was nice.

The wine list was ok. the pasta (for being pasta - it's really hard to mess up pasta - was delightful)  I really liked what ever the bread was that they brought out, and we also split a ceaser that was nice.

The desserts were amazing, and prolly the highlight of this dining experience.",veLWPGA-1MMtcRNDYWm-BA,1,1,3,sswG7NDznrNZnBKvuvdSFA

I wasn't expecting to dine in such a classy restaurant when we made reservations here. I was thinking it would be like Olive Garden it's in the Rio for Pete's sake, however I was very wrong and very impressed. 

The dinning room is dimly lit, the ceilings are vaulted with crown molding and there are marble columns, a chandelier and a fake sky in the center of the room (it is after all Vegas!) We had a beautifully set table and the ornate armchairs added an extra aire of sophistication to our dinning experience. I did find the booths in the center of the dinning room a bit of an eye sore. Maybe they should do away with those and only have tables.

Our waiter Antonio was the greatest waiter I've ever had. He was the epitome of an exceptional waiter . He was knowledgeable about the food and wine, he properly pronounced the names of the dishes. He was friendly and everything was perfect throughout the course of our meal. He was fairly handsome as well (at least I thought so)

The bread basket had an assortment of breads, my favorite was the olive roll. Only a few people at our table ordered Antipasti. I almost fainted when I saw the towering creamy onion soup appear in the bread bowl with its provolone crust. I can only imagine what the Lobster Bisque would have been like.  The baby spinach and pear salad with with crumbled Gorgonzola and candied orange walnuts also looked good.

When we were placing our orders we were asking Antonio about making a slight substitution to a certain dish to accommodate a cheese allergy and he informed us that the chefs would prepare anything we would like any way we would like it even if it's not on the menu. I WAS IN LOVE! Any establishment that is willing to go over and beyond to satisfy patrons gets big points with me.

I tasted my cousin's pan seared scallops with short rib and pancetta raviolis with a sage demi glaze reduction. I WAS IN LOVE! I also tasted my uncle's Ahi (which was one of the evening's specials) I ordered the Fettuccine with Rotisserie Chicken and pancetta and creamy wild mushrooms. The chicken was so delicious I can't recall when I was last impressed by a simple rotisserie chicken. The sauce was so delicious I wanted to marry my food!

I know I'll be back to Antonio's...I can't stop thinking about the Risotto with Lobster with the white truffle Creme, the lobster bisque and of course our waiter Antonio... how funny... I just realized that our waiter at Antonio's was named Antonio! I enjoyed Antonio's and I enjoyed Antonio too ; )",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,3,8,5,MqFZvfs51G_WhL5ojhUMzQ
