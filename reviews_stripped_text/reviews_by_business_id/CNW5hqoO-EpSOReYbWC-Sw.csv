621385,2017-11-07,1,CNW5hqoO-EpSOReYbWC-Sw,Went to Golden China with my coworkers for the lunch special.  The waitress forgot to bring my soup so it was served at the same time as my meal.  Food was hot but had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  The waitress sat down to eat so it took us a while to get our checks (so keep that in mind if you need to get back to work quickly).  I didn't say anything but it turns out my coworkers thought that the food was tasteless as well.  There are literally hundreds of places to eat in this town that are better than Golden China.  Don't waste your time or money.,P47Y0BAetHehKNtUAAxr-w,1,1,1,iG6KFH5cYpiW-KPs1ceQPA

1142202,2018-03-30,0,CNW5hqoO-EpSOReYbWC-Sw,The first thing i notice was the smell. It wasn't very pleasant. I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap. WHERE'S THE CHICKEN?!?! It was mostly big chunks and small chunks  of water chestnuts. I will not be coming back here. Service was non existent.Panda Express would've been a better choice.,TmuDvcL1Fl4h-2ndx-b7Zg,1,0,1,X442DszSbFaeeQivWUye1Q

We ordered pork chow mein,  and the combination fried rice.  I wish I could say great things about the food.  It just wasn't great.  It's was hot, and prepared fresh, but there weren't any flavors that stood out.  It was just whatever .  (Apologies for the vauge description)

I wish the best of luck to this establishment,  but I will not return anytime soon.  There is so many options now in Vegas.  As a Chinese food establishment you must stand out....in a good way.",yI27yodFNujaCHlNDr_rVw,2,0,2,J-Yy3c05v3PGTQSM7hckEw
1763107,2018-01-17,0,CNW5hqoO-EpSOReYbWC-Sw,The food was good I would like to have seen the NY style Chow mein with either pan fried noodles for crispy chow mein noodle like the La Choy they have at the store.

1889839,2017-10-11,2,CNW5hqoO-EpSOReYbWC-Sw,"Best food, as Chinese, this is super authentic Chinese food.
Beef are very tender, hey I am talking about the beef steak, they are soft . Most places are tough to chew.
Basically everything is good.
Snow pea shrimp, honey walnut shrimp, garlic beef steak, sweet and sour pork, chicken or beef.
Just stay away king pao dish and fried noodle and fried rice. Always order steam white rice.
You just gotta know what to order here.
Price so cheap and they give you so much , they never cheap out on beef or shrimp. Great quality",QfTfHt80WmAGsIZpwvVJzg,3,1,5,l8aapcCy7ySt0QjQ6PZi7A

3207403,2017-06-18,1,CNW5hqoO-EpSOReYbWC-Sw,"Today we wanted to check out this new little cafe near Smith's, which is not far from home.
The place is very nice inside, and there were other take out orders and people were eating in too. 
We took out two meals plus an appetizer. 
Potstickers were fresh and tasty.
I liked my steamed vegetables and rice which was steaming hot. The snow peas, baby corn, mushrooms, cabbage, carrots and cucumber are very well prepared. I really like that the sauce on the veggies is delicate and rich with garlic. 
The orange chicken was also very good. Rice was plentiful.
We look forward to checking out more items on the menu very soon.",hd-S4mtrPY9Q6iuBJegnOQ,3,3,4,KbBqUO_cU1hTUAShHSBF1w

I need the manager to message me before this goes bigger than what it is because this guy realm pissed me off

A short while two guys came in. One of the guys was older, in a wheelchair with one leg. as he was eating he began to choke. NONE OF THE STAFF CAME TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEY LOOKED FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER AND CONTINUED COMPLETING ORDERS... after the son and I performed the heimlich on the man , he threw up some he then went outside to get some air at that time one of the employees (a guy) asked if everything was ok? I said yes!!! Now it is the guy was choking and threw up on the mat. He frowns and rolls his eyes . The nasty thing was he used the broom to sweep up the mat where the vomit was...

4495881,2018-04-01,0,CNW5hqoO-EpSOReYbWC-Sw,"If I could rate this place -5 stars I would. The food is overly greasy and microwaved. Bland rice and noodles and add drop soup. All the chicken is excessively breaded. As the daughter of a professional chef of over 37 years, I have the credit to diss this place. Not only was the food terrible, so was the customer service. It's no wonder it was empty. Maybe the cashier was just racist. The vegetables were uncooked so when we asked for them to cook it she said ""you should have tell me before. You have to ask"". 

Why should we have to ask when they should have already been cooked??? If anything she should have asked  us! We've never been here before, how would we know?

Then they took the plate and threw it in the Wok  , didnt really cook it and tossed it back in our to go container -- making a mess. Then we tried it and it was even more greasy and still not cooked. We tried to return and ask for something else and she got an attitude yelling at us saying we have to ask for cooked food and then insulting us in Cantonese to her coworkers. We said forget the food give us our money back then she yelled at us some more ""oh you want Money back? Why you don't just get other food? Money huh?"" 

She was so unnecessarily rude. To the point it was a small argument. I'm so disappointed in this restaurant. They must have hired people to give them stars because theyre not worth it.


Revolting food and service.

Orange chicken seemed a week old and crispy noodle dish had a slime sauce and I honestly couldn't tell difference between chicken and beef they both tasted boiled to death. The hot tea was cold not even lukewarm. There was also a loud heated commotion in the kitchen it made it very uncomfortable especially since it was all in Chinese and you can't understand. Do yourself a favor go to Kung fu on spring valley and valley view. That's our normal place  we receive a flyer in the mail from golden China thought we would try, huge mistake!!!!

The workers in kitchen/ back area were always working hard and attending food or other things in the back area. Prices are good for lunch specials that come with a drink. I don't usually like to write bad reviews but I really didn't like the food here at all. I love love Love Asian restaurants and love trying new things but the food here was bland cold and lacked flavor. Ordered orange chicken lunch special came with fried rice, chow mein, soup and a drink. The chicken was tasteless except for saucy and rubbery. The noodles and rice gave off an old microwaved feel. My favorite part of the meal was the soup. Wouldn't come back but enjoyed the service.",PeggnzOiy0tDQDpWNv0kQw,2,1,2,jLkCa7Pnl9jT8LjBO3W5dg

Unfortunately, The flavor and taste were nonexistent.

I ordered orange chicken which tasted burnt, old, and chewy as beef jerky. 

I wonder if the fried rice was heated up from the day before.. 

Honey walnut chicken looked and tasted okay with some extra white rice on the side.

There is no consistency as the taste of the food really depends on who is preparing it. 

They charge a lot for dinner meals and the quality, value and flavor is lacking.

When they first opened they were really good for lunch specials, the taste, quality and portion was great.

My last visit I got the orange chicken and cashew chicken dinner combos and it was styrofoam packages of slop.
