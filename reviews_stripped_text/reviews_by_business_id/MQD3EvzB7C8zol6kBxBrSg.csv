We waited a little for the hype to die down, but totally understand it now... We have been here TWICE in a week now! And it won't be the last time! You really get your bang for your buck -- the food is well portioned, filling AND satisfying!

The menu has a wide variety of hawaiian x filipino fusion food -- from appetizers, burritos, salads, tacos, entrees, and rice bowls. We both opted for the ISLAND RICE BOWLS:
- Choose your size (KIDS $5.99: 1 serving of protein, 1 scoop of rice, 1 side) (REGULAR $7.99: 1 servings of protein, 2 scoops of rice, 2 sides)
 (MIXED $9.99: 2 servings of protein, 2 scoops of rice, 2 sides)
- Choose your protein (teriyaki chicken, Notorious R.I.B. boneless shortribs, kalbi short ribs, sesame chicken, chicken katsu, kalua pork sisig, crispy pork belly sisig, honey sesame tofu, teriyaki veggies)
- Choose your sides (macaroni salad, green salad, grilled pineapple, stir fry vegetables, edamame)

I ordered (large island rice bowl):
- NOTORIOUS RIB
- SESAME CHICKEN
- MACARONI SALAD
- GRILLED PINEAPPLE
- WHITE RICE 
...and I will continue to get this same order forever! The Notorious RIBs are perfectly marinated & cooked tender boneless short ribs, topped with a tasty slaw -- and the sesame chicken is so crispy & cunchy with a delicious flavorful side sauce that I just want to smother on EVERYTHING! The mac salad is a common necessary side staple, and the grilled pineapple is such a yummy sweet mix to add to the dish! We just barely finish our plate (even on our hungriest days) and just can't get over how satisfying, fresh and filling the food is! (He ordered the notorious rib, chicken katsu, mac salad and mixed veggies... but uses my sesame chicken sauce, haha.)

Will we be back? Without question! (We even had to vow to wait at least a week in between our next visit since we've been here so frequent!) Especially with this gem just around the corner from our house, located on Buffalo x Warm Springs next to the PT's Ranch. I love my order, but vow to definitely try other items on the menu (I have been eyeing the different kinds of elote like MISO-CORNY, or the KALUA PORK NACHOS and NOTORIOUS RIB BURRITO)! =)",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,8,4,5,SeDt--tHus4IY6vBPQg5Eg

Their garlic shrimp is meh. The shrimp they use is NOT good quality. I feel like it's the packaged ones in the freezer aisle. I'm not paying $13 for that. 
The spam in the musubi was paper thin, and super plain. Every time I've had musubis at other Hawaiian joints, it's a pretty thick slice and marinated or has some kind of added teriyaki sauce. The ones here is just soggy rice, spam wrapped in seaweed. 
Their sisig was decent, but it wasn't anything to rave about. 
My least favorite item on the menu are the tacos. The tortillas weren't served warm. They also came straight out of a plastic bag. I got about 4 pieces of meat inside the taco and it was served on a plastic lid. Definitely nothing special and it was easily something I could've recreated at home.

1368037,2017-12-17,0,MQD3EvzB7C8zol6kBxBrSg,"I was excited about trying the food here after having read amazing reviews about this place. I chose the Mixed Island Rice Bowl ($9.99) with two scoops of Brown Rice topped with Teriyaki Chicken, Honey Sesame Tofu, Macaroni Salad, Grilled Pineapple, and a Tropical Lemonade. My friend also chose a similar order with two scoops of White Rice topped with Teriyaki Chicken, Kalua Pork Sisig, Macaroni Salad, Green Salad, and a soda fountain drink. In addition, they gave us Furikake Churro which is on the house. 

Honestly, I'm not happy with the meal I ordered. The Teriyaki Chicken taste okay. The meat isn't as tender as it should be and the portions are quite small for a large bowl. The Honey Sesame Tofu is a bit on the sweeter side. If they could've add a little spice like Sriracha to it, it would've balance the sweetness and make the meal taste better. On a brighter note, I do like the Macaroni Salad and Grilled Pineapple. These are actually sides and are the only ones that taste good.

I was told the Tropical Lemonade ($2.79) had Passion Fruit, Orange, and Guava in it, but all I can taste is concentrated sugar water. Also keep in mind the best quality churro is served warm, crispy, and it's enjoyable to eat. The churros that we were given taste kind of sad, it needed more time to fry, its texture is so dense and chewy, and there is hardly any Furikake sprinkled on it. It's just massive amount of sugar on undercooked dough. I ended up taking most of my meal home.

Long story short, if a guy can hang through a trip here AND you get some action afterward despite the garlic breath from the Shrimp Plate, he's a keeper. 

The Steps:
1. Insist on driving. If he doesn't complain about your speed/music selection or repeatedly ask why you're passing several other Hawaiian restaurants on your way to this specific place, that's common sense AND compatibility.
2. Insist on getting the Shrimp Plate. If he doesn't bitch about it being the highest price item on the menu, you're off to a good start. Bonus points if he takes your recommendation and orders the same thing, and then doesn't complain if you steal a shrimp off his order. Sharing is caring!
3. Chat through your meal and if you're still feeling it, refer to the first paragraph. Garlic is amazing and if that's a deterrent for him, he's not worth it anyway.

For real though, the Garlic Shrimp Plate is amazing- ~$14 for about 10 shrimp, doused in garlic, with plenty of rice, a scoop of mac salad, and a little bit of greens. The shrimp are large and fresh, and have been cooked perfectly on my two trips out here so far.

The interior and the structure of the restaurant is nice and welcoming. The location was not hard to find at all and parking was not a hassle.

I ordered the Keiki size with white rice, Kalbi, and Mac salad. We saw that people recommended the lemonade so we got that too! 

Through pictures the food looked amazing, but we were disappointed when we got to try it ourselves. The rice was hard, the Mac salad was bland, and the Kalbi was okay. The only item I really enjoyed was the lemonade. On the car ride home we even started to feel a bit sick. 

As far as service, one of the girls there was really nice and checked up on us every now and then. The girl who took our order wasn't as friendly.",iXMMo0nHX-hI5LVQ8z3JBQ,0,1,3,bRookZEd3Ja0l--1Nmzv0w

I love Hawaii so I enjoyed the island theme. I ordered a mixed bowl. I got it with white rice, garlic shrimp, stir fry veggies, and grilled pineapple. The bowl was overall pretty good. The garlic shrimp gave the rice a good flavor and the grilled pineapple was a nice twist. My only complaint is there were a few chunks of carrot in the stir fry veggies that didn't seem to be cooked all the way and it threw off the texture for me. I would say without the carrots it would've been better. My friend ordered their kalua pork and he said it was bland and had no flavor.

The food was delicious. I ordered the plate lunch burrito, spam musubi and a drink. My total was $15 and some change. The burrito was amazing. It had white rice, grilled chicken, grilled veggies, cabbage, mac salad, and two kinds of sauce - yum! The spam musubi was standard, but I love spam musubi. For me the food was 5 stars. The service on the other hand needs some work.

When I placed my order, the girl told me 10 minutes but it ended up being around 25 minutes. Most of the food was already cooked, so the workers just had to basically assemble everything. There were only 2 girls working  though and anytime someone came in, one of them had to stop and cashier. I think things would run a lot smoother if they had one dedicated cashier. I almost had to ask for my money back because it kept getting later and later with no food. Seriously a burrito takes like 2 seconds to make, especially since they just had to put the ingredients on the tortilla and roll it up. The musubi was already made. I finally got my food but because it was so late, I had to rush back to work and eat in the car (hence no pictures), so I didnt really get to savor the burrito, but man it was good. I will definitely be back, but I might place my order in advance if I am crunched on time.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,9,6,4,iDx21yKklThI4Xji24mJCQ

The Notorious RIB burrito had all sorts of flavors jammed packed in each bite. Basicslly a whole hawaiian plate inside. Its a large portion too, that I was only able to eat half of it. 
Tocino musubi was too sweet for my taste buds from the sauce with too much rice.

I remember having a friend post a picture of the meals he had while he was there, boy did they look amazing. I asked the wife if she wanted to give Fist of Fusion a shot and she was on board. 

I ordered the Loco Moco (which I have had at another place close by) and I have to truthful and say that this is probably the best Loco Moco I have ever had! The burger was cooked to perfecting, the egg was tasty, and the gravy with mushroom was absolutely delicious! 

The wife ordered the Garlic Shrimp and she absolutely loved it. We placed an order for pick-up online and were a bit hesitant on if they would get things right. But they nailed it, the shrimp was peeled like we wanted and the order was flawless. I got a taste of her Garlic Shrimp and again, I wasn't let down. It was incredible. 

I never post reviews on yelp, as this is my first one ever. I want this to be my first review because this place is freaking awesome. Although it's a start to explore more of the menu, we recommend this for all who are in the area and want a damn good meal for a great price.

2276955,2017-11-19,3,MQD3EvzB7C8zol6kBxBrSg,"Heard about another local food spot just opened in Vegas. Always always stay down when comes to local food not only because from 808 but best comfort food ever two scoops rice, mac salad, and entree. I must admit had my reservations cause over the past twenty years living in Vegas (or locals know call Vegas the ninth island) almost over saturated with local spots. The ones that truly stand out for me is individual family own restaurant nothing to do with chains (not that hater still good). Not only does Fist of Fusion Island Grill stand out writing it or saying it out loud. It truly embodies Ohana. I never had conversation with Ronnie or Lisa but reading other reviews. Chef Ronnie was making the rounds asked me how was everything I had for lunch. A new business when see the owner takes time out to come out get feedback from every guest. Not only does it show his passion for his food, also like past review shows that each customer is not customer but part of the Ohana, and felt like living back in the 808.

So first impression was talk about feeling the Aloha spirit! Not only on the wall with coolest sign that the world needs more of. The staff shouting out Mahalos and welcome. They were consistent with every one that came in the hour chilling having my lunch. It small restaurant but has lot of personality in it. The art work on the wall soon walk in. It pretty much covers that whole wall. It looks very much original. It vibrant colors that screams at you. Hula girl with ukulele. Just chilling on the beach. The shaka sign from the logo to the open and close sign on the door. The sit down counter area. It screams personality but very much 808. Above they have three wide screens. The music!!!! So awesome!!! It totally local style Hawaiian music.

The food the menu has nice diversity to it. It not huge menu. It broken down to bowls, burritos, tacos, salads, apps, and ono grindz. It was my first visit not sure where to start. I know the Crispy Torino Span Musubi. One of the reasons came. I have been in this non spam musubi style kick. I seen the katsu style spam musubi but never had one. Talk about WINNAH. I know seen others that the whole musubi is deep fried. Never had so no going compare. I feel Crispy Torino Spam Musubi. If going katsu style this does Spam Musubi right. Only the Spam that breaded katsu style with the panko action. The rest of it is normal spam musubi. The part that separates Crispy Torino Spam Musubi from nothing had before is the tocino sauce. It perfect compliment to the crispy breading with what tastes like aioli based sauce or am guessing. Good. My entree went with the Sesame Chicken Bowl. The bowl comes in three different sizes. I went with the large. Talk about choke food. I was hungry after morning swim set. The amount of chicken give you is local style, the two scoops of rice is mound not scoop, and bowls come with choice of sides. I went with mac salad (cause dah two scoops rice mac salad need I say more) and stir fry vegetables. The mac salad was solid and the stir fry vegetables was nice medley of all fresh vegetables nice crispy and tell fresh vegetables. I was loved the sauce that coated the chicken and then get some on the side. All good stuff.

Little touch comes details. All the bowls or notice all the bowls coming out that day. They had flower in them. It nice one that see back home. All I was thinking if going out of way make it feel like Hawaii that nice touch. 

No doubt plan on coming back because close to my house. The boneless short ribs other dish torn apart to try first. This churro missed out on need try some of that too. Till the next time...",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,9,4,5,M7t053GOa1BwuoMY-98Pzw

2360875,2017-12-24,10,MQD3EvzB7C8zol6kBxBrSg,"So this is Fist of Fusion Island Grill. You'll probably only see the ""Island Grill"" and the shaka parts of their sign outside and assume it's just another Hawaiian restaurant. It's not. It's fusion. What they serve is fusion. You've been warned. I'm not going to hate the fact it's fusion. I'm ok with fusion. I just wasn't a fan of their fusion. Came here 3 times so I was trying to give them a chance.

On my 1st visit I ordered the regular size bowl ($7.99) bone-in short ribs (+$2) with 2 scoops rice, mac salad, and a grilled pineapple on the side.  The pineapple was the best part and all it was was a grilled pineapple. The mac salad and short rib was nothing special. Sure the pic may look nice but I didn't like it it was more like beef jerky to me. I tried to order the free crispy pork belly app with yelp check-in but they ran out. I was there when they just opened for lunch.

On my 2nd visit I took the parents. We ordered 3 large size bowls of various items share. They messed up the orders twice. Once after the order was placed and one more time when the food was ready. I thought it was fixed the 1st time. The end result? One bowl was some bone-in short ribs and this kalua pork sisig with slaw thing. The short ribs were cooked differently this time. They weren't like beef jerky which was better but I still didn't like it.  There was also less pieces than my 1st visit. The 2nd bowl had teriyaki chicken and kalua pork sisig. The 3rd bowl had tofu and sesame chicken. There was bad words said while eating. No one wanted to eat more after sampling everything and the food remained untouched in the fridge over the weekend. The free crispy pork belly app was nothing good also.

The 3rd visit I ordered the loco moco. You can't mess up loco moco can you? There's nothing to it. Rice, fried egg, and gravy. The eggs had furikake on it which is how I usually make my eggs at home. The gravy was different. Needed more gravy not because the taste of the gravy there was just wasn't a lot of gravy in the bowl. A friend ordered short ribs thinking they were getting short ribs with the bone in it, you know the usual way it's served. Whatever was brought out I wasn't going to trade with him even though he was kind of looking at my plate. 

They use paper bowls. Seems like they're trying to be eco friendly. A good amount of rice got stuck to the bowls. If you start scraping sure the rice comes off the bowl but with some paper from the bowl. Also it doesn't hold up too well on to go orders. Took it a few miles away and bowls were all wet.

Honestly I'd rather go to the other restaurants around the area like Island Flavor, Ohana, and L & L just to name a few. I'm going to Island Flavor now.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,17,9,2,VloazTj0R9dGCp-rP7Z_eg

I was informed that they had changed vendors for their short ribs so I had to give them another try, and this time, they were nothing short on the short ribs. They tasted soooooo much better! In fact, they were some of the best short ribs I've had in quite awhile. Super juicy, tender, and flavorful! If you're ever craving short ribs, FoF is currently thee spot to get them!

Also tried tried the Crispy pork belly this time, and it was really tasty! It had really good textures. The skin was super crisp, but the pork itself was really soft and moist. The cilantro lime sauce also gave the pork a nice kick to it. 

And did I mention the guava lemonade? I'm usually not a huge fan of lemonade, but that drink converted me into a fan. So refreshing!

We drove across town to try out this place. We were greeted as we walked in, nice little atmosphere and loved the island vibe and music. Prices are reasonable. Looking at spending about 23.00 for two meals and two regular drinks. We went to the front to look at the menu and girl ( no name tag) upfront asked if we were ready and I told her we were still looking. She was not personable at all . When we went in it wasn't that busy that she could of made an effort to make small talk with us and give us some ideas of what their top sellers were. She clearly saw us looking at their menu and their choices of elote . Though she did state if we had questions to ask. When finally ordering we tried to order one of their elotes and she said ""oh we are out of corn"". Should of put a sign up or even state they are out when we were looking at the menu.  Also only choice of diet soda was out of order. So what brought us here? We saw some pictures of their food on UNLOKT. Pictures they have posted look better than what the food tastes like. No flavor. Also another friend who is a ""foodie"" stated they were good. I got the chicken katsu meal. 1 protein, 2 scoops of rice, and 2 sides for $9.99. I got veggies and macaroni salad as my sides. Side means two tablespoons of macaroni salad and 1/2 cup of grilled soggie onions, a piece of red bell pepper , and 1 cube of zucchini.

The next day, my husband and I attempted to go, on a Sunday at 4:59 pm, to which I could see they were closed and sweeping up. I visited the following day to pick up dinner. This is when I found out, this was their soft opening week and Sunday was their very first day.  I also learned from the owner/chef, what the correct hours would be: M - Sat 11 - 9 and Sunday from 11 to 7.

Being filipino and growing up in HI, one would think that I got this, but I honestly can say that the menu is different from other filipino or Hawaiian-style restaurants. For the most part, there's a twist to many of the items on the menu, which is a good thing.

It took me a few minutes to figure out what to order, plus my husband texted me to change his order twice! 

With the two times that I have been to Fist of Fusion, I have some mixed emotions as to which are my favorites, because they are all so good. Coming up in first place are the sesame chicken, loco moco, kalua pork sisig taco and kalua pork nachos. For the tacos and nachos, they fry their own shells and chips!!! 

The loco moco is made with mushroom gravy. Like real mushrooms. So very good.

My husband really enjoyed their Crispy Pork Belly Appetizer and furikaki churros.

The one thing that is weird about the location of this restaurant, is the parking lot. Make sure you don't back into the mound of dirt and unpaved portion in the middle of the parking lot.

3600225,2018-04-26,7,MQD3EvzB7C8zol6kBxBrSg,"Always on the lookout for new spots in town, we decided to give Fist of Fusion a go.
Ordered a Large Bowl (2 proteins and two sides) Sesame Chicken and Kalua Pork Sisig.
My sides were mac salad and grilled pineapple.

Observing the kitchen in action while we wait for our food, two cooks hustle (not in a good way)to get orders out as there are two people ahead of us and take out orders as well. A good 30 minutes pass and we finally get our order. Wifey luckily ordered a salad, but my bowl was a huge let down.

Filipinos and Hawaiians LOVE their rice. In fact, a pot of hot, fluffy rice is one of the first things you learn how to do in the kitchen growing up. The rice in my take out container wasn't hot, more cool to the touch, and  some grains were hard. Day old rice? Possibly, but that's the kind of rice you turn into fried rice, not serve it as is, especially when hot food should be hot, and for the prices you charge.

The ""SISIG"" was anything but...(simply a play on words)no jowl, no ear, no snout...straight up bland shredded pork butt topped with shredded cabbage and a white sauce. This was barely warm/room temp...its beginning to sound like
a CON-Fusion of Filipino/Hawaiian food.

The Sesame Chicken (Chicken Katsu topped with sesame seeds and a sweet shoyu concoction) looked and tasted like it was prepared ahead of time and not made to order
Inside wasn't hot, wasn't  juicy at all, and portion sizes for both proteins were on the skimpy side.

To make things worse, the mac salad was a bland mush, and the grilled pineapple was so sour, I spit it out as I proceeded to take a bite.
Too many shortcuts and overall taste makes me wish I had read LJ's review first. 

Another double edged sword is social media. Food should taste as good as it looks when its posted on Yelp, Instagram, or Facebook, but if you can't duplicate your delicious looking food consistently on a daily basis, then it's a huge disappointment ....NEXT!!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,19,8,2,nlPaIs495K75veRBNCq_Hw

PROS
+ good portion, small bowl should be enough to fill me up for lunch without the last minute impulse orders 
+ friendly staff, big smiles and greeted with ""ALOHA""; apologized that I had to wait awhile 

CONS
- put in my free pork belly app order shortly after I ordered my main meal, but felt like I waited a lot longer than I needed to for it (party of 3 after me all got their orders before me)
- rice in musubi wasn't sticky enough to old it together, fell apart after my first bite
- very small portion of pork belly app, there were only a few pieces on a bed of slaw; it was free but I probably wouldn't order again

In pictures, the food looked amazing with large-appearing bowls with picturesque protein atop rice and mac salad. In reality, the serving sizes are much smaller.

For lunch, the garlic shrimp plate was reminiscent of those shrimp trucks back on the islands. I enjoyed the heavy garlic flavor, and the buttery finish, but for $14, everything else was quite small and lackluster including the sides of rice and mac salad. I did think the shrimp was cooked better than the furikake shrimp from Island Flavor.

However, when it came to the rice bowls, you get a much better deal down the street on Durango. The servings of protein were small and un-filling. On top of that, the meat including the pork belly sisig and teriyaki chicken were haphazardly tossed together in the bowls.

Kalua pork ""sisig"" might as well been called Kalua pork, instead of capitalizing on a trendy gimmick. But the most unfortunate occurrence was the metallic wire in the chicken katsu (pictured) that in my fiancee's plate. Not sure how it got in there but it was lodged between two pieces of katsu slices. Island Flavor still reigns supreme as the premier Island food hot spot, but I'm hoping for a better experience at fist of fusion one day.",9OozWSxXJzsujdbaNuzrFw,1,0,2,hM8St4OkaN7tYo8V9Qi-6w

Super excited to try this food. I had a large mixed rice bowl. Brown rice, notorious rib, tofu , grilled veggies and grilled pineapple. Also the miso corney elote. 

The bowl was soaked in some kind of juice/thin gravy and cabbage all over the top of the bowl. The rice was soaked, veggies soggy. The rib was good but you can tell it is just stew meat. Tofu was fried well well done almost to hard to eat. 
I did not eat the rice, veggies or pineapple as they were all soaked with the liquid.

The one thing that they got right was the miso corney elote. Steamed perfect and the seasoning blend was so good. I did ask for it to be cut of the cob but that was not done.

This place is like your standard taco, burrito, rice bowl type restaurant, but with a Hawaiian style twist. The primary meat selections are a kalbi type boneless short rib, chicken, and pork belly. 

For lunch, I had the ""Notorious R.I.B"" burrito which is the marinated short rib meat with rice, Mac salad, and a kimchi slaw. While waiting for my food, they brought out a sample churro. I'm not big on sweets, but it was interesting that it had sort of a coconut sugar on it and some seaweed flakes. A bit sweet for my taste, but I still ate the whole thing.

Parking was not hard to find maybe due to the mall not being overly crowded yet. Entering the establishment it is pretty small inside with limited seatings and a walk up area to order food. The menu has its local touches, being from Hawaii we are particular with our local food selections. The menu does have alot of local touches but how does it taste???? 
We give it a 4/5.... 

On our menu today was the Loco Moco, Hawaii folks know exactly what that is. Hamburger patties over rice smothered with brown gravy and topped with over easy eggs ( or however you prefer your egg) i like my yolk to be dripping all over.. mmmmmmmm!!!!! The hubby had the island rice bowls, they have 3 different sizes to choose from dependent on how hungry you are. He had the 1 choice meat (Kalbi short ribs +$2 additional) 2 choice sides (stir fry veggies and mac salad) and of course WHITE RICE but they do have brown if you prefer it! We also tried the fried spam musubi so ono!!!!! And they have a POG lemonade say whattttt!!!! Real good! When ordering we peeped some corn on the cobs with different toppings. Elote, Flaming hot cheetoes were some of the flavors but hubby opted for the traditional butter and salted corn.

The ambience is definitely Hawaii esque. Local jams playing and a beautiful mural of home. I definitely wanna be back to try the garlic shrimp plate little on the pricier side but that ono pog lemonade is calling my name!",A0UtIwTkkH2GHcVePPBgtQ,2,1,4,rUL23b7IXMcGQJGPIcSzHA

I really tried to like you guys.  I really truly did.  I just left this place today and had to write a fresh review in my brain unlike their side salad.  I been dying to come here since December.  I read about the sisig always running out and at 12pm I couldn't believe you guys don't have it.  Ok first, let's talk about the location and space.  The place is in the corner of Buffalo (in a little strip where 7 Eleven and Sola Salon can be found) hidden in a corner.  The bad thing is there is a new building erecting in front of it and it will block the sign when you are driving by.  It will literally cock block the restaurant.  The place has parking all over it but it's packed.   When you come in you will notice how tiny it is.  57 seating capacity but tighter than a virgin elephant's butt.  I mean you are squeezed in a table.  It's still nice to see the wall paintings and signs.  It's chill.   There are three TV's in picture frames which is so 2000's.  They are blasting Hawaiian artist on them.  The restrooms are super clean and nice.  The décor of the place is nice including the tiles and façade bamboo in front of cabinets.  The waitress who took our order was super smiley and nice.  She repeats your order which is nice.  

So now for the bad parts of the rating.  First, you have to line up by the cashier to purchase the food.  Then you have to get up when your name is called to pick up your food.  Something like an IN-AND-OUT.  Which I think kills my experience here off the bat.  I messed up orders because people in my party of 6 wanted a lot of food.  I mean the menu is not huge but the food selections ""seems"" yummy.  So, 20 minutes later they call us.  I ordered the loco moco - super disappointed.  It was served on brown rice which is dope but and it's a huge BUT the beef patties were overcooked and gravy tasted burnt.  It was a 9 out of 10 on the SALT SCALE.  Like seriously salty even  to kill a snail with no contact.  I also ordered the CHEETO corn - it was my first time ordering it and it was fun to eat.  I enjoyed that part.  My father-in-law ordered the Notorious PIG taco - super dry meat and the veggies look old.  Then the infamous SIDE SALAD.  Holy crap for $3.99 all I got was chopped lettuce in a small plastic container.  Are you serious with this? not even a tomato? Carrots? an olive? Damn.  He also ordered corn and he said it was messy but I think he was ok with it.  My sister-in-law ordered some fried chicken since the sisig was sold out.  She said this place was subpar.  She also ordered the corn - regular.  She liked it.  My wife ordered the tofu dish which was average.  She barely ate it since the tofu didn't taste fresh.  My brother in law ordered the Notorious PIG burrito which was huge.  Looked fun to eat.  He was more happy about being there since the décor was nice.  Overall, this place was average in the food if you are not used to eating at spots like ISLAND FLAVORS or my second choice OHANA.  Which to me holds the highest regard for authentic Hawaiian dishes.  I love that place but I wanted to check out local spots.  I heard lots of great things  about this place and really wanted to like the whole FILIPINO-HAWAIIAN fusion thing.  But to me they did an ok job.
SORRY GUYS! Hopefully the menu changes.  I wanted to give this place a BS + just because of this and the corn.  I was really not happy  with my food and I hope they listen to this plead.  MAKE YOUR BEEF BIGGER and LESS SALT!!!!

The bowl: inside the bowl comes with cabbage, topped with kimchi and drizzled with spicy mayo. 
The combination is so yummy, I was mixing it all together. I asked for more Kimchi on the side just to kinda give it more of that flavor.

We tried so many lack luster Chinese styled Hawaiian bbq spots and I thought man this should be interesting to see how a Filipino Hawaiian bbq fusion spot will be. First off the place was well kept and clean, the staff greets you while you walk in, and the menu has just enough selection not to make you overwhelmed with choices.
The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 Star is because the crispy pork belly was a little oily like it was fried in oil and not broiled, so the fat just held all the oils. The sesame chicken was good as was the boneless bbq beef. The garlic shrimp was not as how I expected or liked, it was in a goopy sauce that had a whole different garlic taste and a couple shrimps were undercooked. The panko fried spam Musubi was good but I think the price could be a little better for the amount given for sure. They have a super bomb drink here though that will be so refreshing on hot days or just in general, POG ( Passion fruit, Orange and Guava) lemonade. Super bangin.

Shrimp had no flavor (yall ever heard of salt?), rice was hard, macaroni in the mac salad was undercooked, and the second side they gave me was not what I ordered. 

But what bumped this up to a three star review is I was having lunch with my dad, and he ordered a mixed plate of kalbi short ribs and garlic fried chicken. The kalbi is really good. I would go back solely for this. The garlic chicken was good as well, very much like chicken wings you would get down the street at Soyo or Bonchon. 

As far as service, the girl at the register was not very welcoming, which is a turn off considering this is a Hawaiian place. Ever heard of ""aloha spirit""?! Someone teach her how please. 

Also the portions are kind of small for the price. Even though my food sucked, I ate all of it and was still hungry. And this ones not really a big deal, but the place gives off a young vibe that would be more environmentally friendly, but they use a lot of plastic: plates and covers, drink cups and lids, cutlery.

The meat tasted as it was marinated in teriyaki, ginger and soy sauce...it was amazing.

Not only did they reached out and apologize but they also replaced my order with 2 huge burritos and a nice chicken plate!  I can honestly say this is customer service at its best!!Replacing my order would have been sufficient so the extra add ons were truly an unexpected pleasant surprise!!

Notorious R.I.B. Burrito
Garlic Shrimp
Teriyaki Chicken
Sesame Chicken
Spam Musubi
Crispy Pork Belly

All Items came out hot. 

I especially enjoyed the Crispy Pork Belly. Its was CRISPY as Lechon should be and also melted in your mouth. The cabbage salad surprised me with the refreshing, crisp bites of apple. The dressing was amazing. I ATE IT ALL!!!

The Garlic Shrimp was more than filling with 10 pieces of shrimp. Shrimp was excellent. Nevermind ""Peel & Eat"", I ate the shell too. 

The finisher was also a surprise. We tried their Furukaki Churros.....OMG...You must try it before you leave. 

I will definitely be returning.

Great job...and Mahalos to the Staff.",pl8niMiIiR0Qy5l2ftf9fg,0,0,5,Mq2fgX4GpGyip10Za0Fi5w

Downside was that the chicken was over cooked and didn't have taste. The food over all was ok missing the flavor in a few dishes but the manager did try to rectify the situation by giving us a ""remake"" the next time we came in. Definitely an island themed/vibe there for sure which was nice coming from Hawaii. The restaurant has a fusion mix which is a blend of ingredients of different places.

5622080,2018-04-02,0,MQD3EvzB7C8zol6kBxBrSg,"Okay, so I initially thought to myself, 'This is like any other Hawaiian/Asian Fusion place', but I was so wrong!
THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD!!! It is all my favorite kind of food in one place. I can get my Hawaiian, Asian (Dominantly Filipino influences), and Mexican food fix all at one place. The fact they have elotes here is what made me consider coming here. 
I ordered the mango chicken tacos but for whatever reason I didn't get the mango salsa on my order. Nevertheless, it was still good. You get to order between corn or flour tortillas. 
My husband ordered the kalua pig/sisig and Kalbi plate. I tried his food, and I got so freaking excited! The kalbi had a good amount meat on it; none of those skinny ass ribs you would normally find. They tasted so good! I was blown away when I tried the kalua pig/sisig 'cause it was like no other kalua pig I've tried before. It's a bit tangy, which is what made me literally obsess over it. Almost like a Sinigang tamarind sort of taste. 

Definitely worth driving from the north west. We're coming back!",rTSBDuGLi3rKojaeEwzZ9w,3,2,5,R3Pwr8Vn8NWUnAfzZcgylA

It didn't take long before we got our food. My friend let me have a taste of his ribs and they were really delicious.   I really enjoyed the Kalua Pork.

5750269,2017-12-18,0,MQD3EvzB7C8zol6kBxBrSg,"First impression, pretty basic order at the counter style restaurant. Hawaiian food mainly.

Had the 2 meat combo. Had the Notorious ribs and teri chicken with rice and double mac salad.

The chicken was good, will get sauce on the side next time though because it spills all into the rice a bit too much for my taste. But it was seared well and had good flavor and texture.

The boneless shortrib (basically korean bulgogi) was pretty dissapointing as a korean lol. The marinade flavor was good, but the cooking of the meat was done pretty poorly. Looks like they arent using a hot enough grill, or they are just overloading the grill with too much cold meat. It was basically boiled marinated meat. Zero char or searing on the beef which is crucial in my opinion. 

The mac salad was mac salad. 

They did give me 2 complimentary churros which was honestly the highlight for me. They should sell larger sized ones for sure.

Overall it was just okay, I didnt really get a warm greeting either which is important to me being a business owner myself that cares ALOT about customer experience. The food was nothing to write home about. Might come back to try some other stuff if Im in the area.",2r0CnsEbhBo75KYoVF8eGA,0,0,3,e4Kuj-0xtJgQcgmvoeWH-g

 (We were looking for chicken katsu for lunch which is hard to find during lunch hours in Vegas for some reason.)

I ordered the sesame chicken with is chicken katsu served with a sauce. I got mines with edamame and veggies. 

Churro on the house.

Nice indoor seating. Hawaiian music for vibes. Love seeing Hawaiian food on the 9th island. 
Would be nice to see a couple tables outside.

I've tried their Garlic Shrimp plate, Kalbi Short Ribs plate, Uni-Corn and Miso Corn-y. I have not been disappointed yet. Garlic shrimp was not overwhelming on garlic and had a semi-sweet taste to it. Kalbi was very juicy. Depending on the size of plate you want will dictate the amount of sides you get. The regular plate gets two sides and let me just say having grilled pineapple, toss salad or edamame as options makes me feel less guilty about my main dish. The corn on the cob options are very creative and with the prices being $4/each its very easy to get two and not feel ashamed. The service incorporates the aloha spirit from the moment you open the door till the moment you depart. With all these new and delicious spots opening up on this side of town, I may need to relocate soon.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,11,15,4,aS8k-vOQ4L6pCXaBJgwdZQ
