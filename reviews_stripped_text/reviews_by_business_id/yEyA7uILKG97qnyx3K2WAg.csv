54755,2016-01-12,1,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"I only gave this review a 1 because there wasn't a ZERO option. I had a party of 4 at this restaurant  3 of us ordered steaks and 1 ordered salmon. We had ordered our steaks medium and they all came out either medium-well or well-done, unfortunately we had to send two out of the three steaks back which took almost 15 minutes because our server took that long to come back and check on us. Once the steaks were re made and came back to the table the temperature was great however once we started eating them, they just didn't taste right-something was way off on them. We barely touched the steaks and the salmon that was also ordered was a bad cut of fish which was also barely touched. Once somebody finally came to the table (might have been a bus boy to take away plates) asked if we were done (which you can clearly see full pieces of meat on the plate still) and didn't ask if everything was okay, just quickly picked up the plates and then the server dropped off the check and didn't say a word. Thankfully the two steaks were taken off the check but we were being charged for the salmon so I asked to speak with the manager. I told him what the issue was with everyone's food and he all he could say to me with a really bad attitude was that all he can do is take care of the steaks and nobody complained about the salmon earlier, we had then explained to him that we tried to tell somebody about the salmon but the server never came around except to drop off the check. 

We were very nice about everything we just didn't want to have to pay for food that tastes bad and barely touched. What bothers me the most is the customer service given to us at this ""steakhouse"" the customer service was terrible from the server and also from the manager. I'm sure anybody that goes into a steakhouse would expect great service from everybody working there. Not to mention when you're in a middle of a conversation with the manager you don't expect a bad confrontational attitude and him turning his back on you and walking away.

Now, thru all of this I did explain that one person in my party was happy with their meal. Drinks were okay, appetizer was okay and so were the side dishes. It was just 3 main courses. I have tried contacting the food and beverage director for Harrahs properties via email and by phone and no response back and it's been 10 days!",istBYwe8y5QcUQhxX-6AWw,3,0,1,XX_-yOIyMQBBfuDcMLb6RA

The majority of the table's steaks were not cooked right. Took forever to get a drink different from rest of table when server appeared to only have two or three tables. Way too bright of lighting for me, lets turn it down a notch for a steakhouse. Got coconut shrimp with the steak and these were the worst coconut shrimp anyone could make. They were surrounded by a pound of breading. Couldnt even fit the shrimp in the accompanying sauce container.

The food has gotten steadily worse and the service has done the same.  Our last meal took almost 75 minutes to get to the table, some of it was cold, some wrongly prepared, and it made for just a miserable long meal.  Maybe it's a race to the bottom here?

We even provided feedback just to try to help make this last meal better, but it was like we were speaking a foreign language.  For the price of the food, there are definitely better options in Vegas.",IwE-ZfYPwLtZOvnEy-p1Gg,2,0,1,p0RL35tYp02aS2lPLK0JzQ

194026,2012-07-24,0,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"I had dinner here on my recent trip to Las Vegas and enjoyed it quite a bit. The atmosphere was terrific, a nice quiet sanctuary inside of a noisy, smoky casino. The restaurant has TV's all around the the room that display a slide show of Vegas throughout the early years through current day that was very fun to watch. We were dining with my wife's uncle who is a 30 year resident and he enjoyed it quite a bit. The old photos helped him to recall a lot of memories and share some great stories.
I started with a Caesar salad which was nicely done, good flavor and the perfect amount of dressing.
For my entree I ordered the 10 ounce wagyu rib steak which was delicious. It was my first time trying wagyu and I found it to be very tasty. It had a wonderful sear, but was cooked a little closer to rare than the medium rare I ordered. For sides we shared steak fries which were sort of blah, creamed corn with bacon which was absolutely amazing and lobster Mac n cheese which was great but lacked a little in lobster in my opinion. While the sides were pretty good, they were very small, much smaller than you would get in a typical steakhouse.
For dessert they brought out a piece of cheesecake that we all shared. It was very nice and the presentation was wonderful too.
Overall it was a good experience for the price you paid to dine here. If you present your players card you get a discount off the prices so keep that in mind if you're staying at any of the Harrah's properties.",iIZhsrl0WQInlvyhvukzMQ,1,0,4,gpJ4Tak_xyRYSoXDTYpq-g

The problem lied in the used car salesman sleaze that the staff carried like it was swagger.

At the price you expect a sort of high end experience. This was not it. I have never been so blatantly upsold in my life.

After completion of ordering this is what your waiter will say ""Oh, so you wanted to start off with those great, fresh, crab legs? No? Wow. Okay.""

Again enjoyed the food. Hard to enjoy an experience when you feel like you're being hustled.

243769,2014-04-07,0,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"Terrible, just terrible.

Ordered a $50 Bone-in Ribeye and got the most grisly steak imaginable. Something you'd expect at a Sizzler. I've been to many Vegas steakhouses and they've all been top notch until now. Absolutely shocking how bad the quality was.
 
The lobster mac 'n cheese had almost no lobster in it and was rock hard all across the top of the ridiculously small portion I was given. Seriously, at least a third of the container was breadcrumbs. For $12, you get a portion about the size of a teacup. Oh, unless you count the breadcrumbs, then it's two thirds of a teacup.

A very nice waiter, but other than that, this was a horrible experience. I've never written a Yelp review before; that's how angry this experience made me. I would perhaps excuse their incredibly poor food if you couldn't do better at literally every other steakhouse on the strip, but you can.

They basically took our order dropped the food and walked away.  He acted taken back with any requests from the table for condiments, etc.  If he had waited long enough to get our order all the way we could have made those request in advance.

The food was over priced and unimpressive.  One of the worst burgers I have had.  The steak fries were terrible, not cooked well, no flavor, etc.  The only thing we really enjoyed were the salads, which were very good.  The server asked if they would like soup or salad with the meals not mentioning it was additional so it was a surprise at the end of the check.

Crisp Skinned Atlantic Salmon
Seared Atlantic Scallops

514981,2012-06-07,3,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"OK... I admit it, I'm spoiled.  When in Vegas we typically end up at some swanky spot, like Smith & Wollensky, Carnevino at the Palazzo, or Andre's at the Monte Carlo.

We did the budget Vegas thing for YEARS, and now we're 40-something and ready to bask in the glory of middle class financial security (as much as you can have in our current economic climate...).  So we aren't sharing rooms with 10 other people anymore, and don't eat dinner at Fat Burger prior to clubbing.  OK... maybe we still do occasionally. ;)  Who doesn't love a fried egg on their burger at 2am?

Anyhoo... Center Cut was a REALLY nice surprise.  Right next to their Tropical Breeze Cafe (which I would NOT recommend), the location gives you that ""this is probably not such a classy place"" feel - until you go in.  Classic Vegas decor, and nice big round tables for your group.  I love round tables... nothing worse than a 10 person rectangle that allows you to speak to maybe 3 of the 10 people the entire time.  Clean.  A+ on the service.  Just an all around great experience.  One qualifier - I've only been there once.  Not sure about the consistency over time, but this one experience was worth mentioning.

And the food... the term umami comes to mind.  Our group had fairly diverse tastes, so we got a good sampling.  The fillet was melty perfect, the rib-eye had just the right amount of crispy goodness around the edges, I got the scallops - which were OH-mazing, but don't order that if you're really hungry.  All was cooked to perfection.

Desert?  Yes and yes.  We got the Carrot Cake and the Coffee Toffee Crunch.  This was no ordinary slice of carrot cake.  This was the mother load, cream of the crop, most spectacular piece of carrot cake you've ever had... ever.  Sorry Mom, theirs was better...  The Coffee Toffee Crunch was over the top good as well.

So... if you're not going to Flamingo for the pool parties, the convenient location, decent rooms and reasonable prices - at a minimum, go there to check out Center Cut.  Hopefully, they'll still have the Cuvelier Los Andes '09 Malbec on the wine list.  Spendy, but worth it!",dI1dOqDd3zQq0sItl-jWDw,7,1,4,SF-_IgvwMGpPoDdl_FZN5Q

Ordered the Calamari, crab cakes and lobster mac and cheese. Calamari was nice generous portion and had a crispy chewy texture. Just right imo. Crab cakes were nothing special, felt a bit too 'hushpuppy' tasting. Mac and cheese were great. Rich cheesy with just enough bits of lobster.

We decided to give the new steakhouse at Flamingo a try before going out for the night.  GREAT CHOICE!!!  We were greeted by two very friendly hosts at the door and sat right away.  We had a food allergy in our group and before ordering the Chef of the restaurant came to our table PERSONALLY to see what he could create special for my friend.  That is what's call service!  The staff was attentive and friendly.  So for the food...I had the filet and it was perfect...tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  The server explained to me what i guess is called a popover (like a Yorkshire pudding) that came with my steak and it was so yummy.  Still warm so the garlic butter melted all over it.  For sides we had the corn (excellent) and gratin potatoes (also excellent).  Even though we were all full and had no intentions of ordering dessert the manager knowing it was my birthday brought us out the most amazing, sweet, and HUGE slice of chocolate cake for the table to share.

Wife and I were with friends over drinks in the Flamingo after a day at the pool.  Our friend was hungry and by chance, we strolled into Center Cut. We were immediately seated which we thought was odd on a Friday at 8pm.

For an appetizer, we ordered the Sea Food trio (King Crab, JumboPrawns and oysters) which was fresh and fantastic. Also, served an amazing array of warm bread (bacon bits, cheese and tomato) which was the best I've ever had.

For dinner, we had the filet mignon (unreal-melts in mouth), pork chop, lamb chop and the crab cakes; each was perfectly prepared and presented.

Brought it back, I had to eat my salmon alone until they gave us the same filet burned on top.(it was cut as we cut it before)
Brought it back, gave us a new filet more raw than the first!
We gave up and ordered another salmon.
Gave us raw salmon (half of it was different color!!!)

OYSTERS: Got the half dozen kumamoto, they were decent. Their house cocktail sauce is good, the red wine mignonette was just okay.
CENTER CUT CHOPPED SALAD: Good size, good variety of ingredients including tomato, cucumber, radish, salami, cheese, olives, and avocado. Would get again.

FRENCH ONION SOUP: Bubbly and hot with a super-rich broth and plenty of cheese. Shareable portion.
ROSEN FARMS PRIME RACK OF LAMB: My entree pick, which was more accurately two chops with a weird presentation. It was served on two sauces (eggplant caviar and minted Greek yogurt) neither of which was very good, and a gummy, flavorless olive and mushroom risotto. The meat was good, but the rest of the plate lacked finesse. 
SALT-CRUSTED PRIME RIB: Ordered rare, received raw, returned to kitchen re-received medium well. This was just okay. Two portion sizes, might as well go for the larger one. Would get an actual steak next time instead.
TWICED BAKED POTATO & BROCCOLINI: The potato was huge, topped with cheese, and super creamy, while the broccolini was lightly seasoned and fresh. I like that you can get two sides to share for $15, selection was a good mix of healthy and hearty.
NY CHEESECAKE: Almost didn't get dessert but this was our server's recommendation, and it arrived topped with a mountain of fresh whipped cream and tons of strawberries, blueberries, and black berries, with what appeared to be an Oreo cookie crust. Very nicely done, glad we got this to share.

Overall, the menu and execution were pretty average but pricing was pretty good for the Strip and they occasionally offer a Groupon ($69 for $100 value, not valid with discount codes).

The waitstaff for a large group could've been better, getting drink orders and food out at the same time. I didn't get offered a drink order since they missed us. Water was fine anyways.

I like how Center Cut Steakhouse looks fancy, but you don't have to be wearing a suit and tie to get in. Of course you would look awkward coming here with gym shorts and flip flops but you get the idea...

After being seated immediately after checking in, we met our servers assistant, Anthony- then seconds later our server Frank introduced himself. They provided their recommendations, then we placed our order. Within about 20 minutes or so, our food arrived. Here is what we ordered:

*The Hanger Steak- if you like more marbling in your Steak?...order this in medium. You get a ton of marbling plus all the juicy flavor with every bite.

*The Cowboy Ribeye- 45 day/dry aged, bone-in piece of heaven! This was absolutely delicious. Although some pieces were on the salty side, after squeezing lemon juice and Tabasco, the flavor was delicious! The meat super tender and fat pieces juicy! I truly enjoyed this steak. 

*16oz. Prime Rib- slow cooked to perfection, this is probably on theeeeee best Prime Rib Steaks I've ever tried on The Strip. At a wonderful price point, you get more bang for you buck with this cut. 

The sides served with the steaks are all a-la-carte, here is what we tried:

*Mac n' Cheese, slightly disappointed, although it was super cheesy good. Since it was baked, There were some noodles that didn't feel cooked all the way, as if they were still al dente hard. Boooooo.

*Brocollini, steamed/sautéed pieces of broccoli. Pretty good! 


This is one the ""cheaper"" steakhouses on the strip. Very reasonable portions at a decent price, with great customer service.",8drMKNHWavs2g6uf0pLtvg,14,13,4,d9F-CVjbAvbsIjPp5-USZA

2081663,2014-06-05,0,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"This review is for my experience in the bar area, not in the dining room. 
I recently visited Las Vegas with my girlfriend and on we really wanted some Fois Gras because it's banned in California. Center Cut Steakhouse looks nice from the outside, and we noticed that they serve a Foie Gras appetizer and have a BOGO happy hour that includes a Blueberry Mojito, so on May 22, 2014 we decided to give them a try.

We arrived at 5pm and asked to be sat in a booth at the bar since we weren't getting a full meal. We were both dressed in full Steampunk regalia, complete with stylish Victorian clothing complimented by complicated gadgetry. Sure we stood out, but it's not like we were scary-looking. Anyway, our server greeted us and asked if we were staying for dinner or just having drinks. We informed him that we would like to have happy-hour drinks and an appetizer, and he said the kitchen doesn't open until 5:30. Then he said ""You know how the happy hour works, right? Each one of you buys a drink and you each get a second one for free."" I said ""so I can't buy one and give the second drink to my girlfriend?"" His response was ""no."" Then he actually said ""I'll give you a few minutes to decide if you want to stay."" Not only is that rude, but it's self-defeating. The bar was practically empty, and as a former server for over ten years, we're in it for the money, which mostly comes from tips. After waiting for nearly ten minutes for him to return with our water, I decided to ask the bartender if what the server said was true. The bartender gave me a puzzled look and said ""no, you can buy one drink and give the second one to someone else."" That made me really mad because it's obvious that the server didn't want to wait on us. I don't know if he was discriminating against us due to our attire (which was much better than his btw), but he was a rude, lying douchebag who shouldn't be a food server. I decided to avoid him completely, and I sure as hell didn't want to give him any money for his pathetic excuse for service, so we moved to the bar and ordered our drinks there. He took another five minutes to return to our table with our water, and I noticed that he saw that we had moved. That table wasn't seated again the entire time we were there.

Any way, we moved to the bar and ordered two Blueberry Mojitos. I have to say that they were disappointing. There was hardly any blueberry flavor, mostly lime and hardly any mint. Hell, I make better ones than that at home! Some friends met us at the bar and we all ordered the Foie Gras appetizer, which was the only thing I liked at this restaurant besides the friendly bartender. The Foie Gras was rich and creamy, and it sat on a on a rich truffle bordelaise sauce beside a toast point tower filled with arugula. We all agreed that this appetizer was delicious!

Nevertheless, due to the rude server and mediocre drinks, we will not be returning to Center Cut Steakhouse.",OIRrD3v9qInk9ZklIJy6Nw,2,0,2,klY-NUkSeA-9VSq3ellpPQ

The lobster chowder was bizarrely bland and sweet. Very off flavor that improved to just edible with a lot of pepper. Our waiter was attentive, but told us a replacement Cabernet for the Merlot we ordered ""tastes the same.""  It did not. And also that Béarnaise (which they have) is the same as Hollandaise (which they don't). While these things may be similar it is insulting to be told you can't tell the difference.

I had a 20% off coupon for staying at the hotel which helped a lot. The steaks are reasonably priced, especially compared to other steakhouses on the strip. I got the 14oz boneless ribeye ($42) and a serving of broccolini ($9).

The steak was perfect seasoned, great sear with a nice crust on the outside. The one downside is that the steak was a bit too thin for my liking. It was just over half an inch thick when I usually prefer my steaks at least an inch thick. As a result, the medium rare I asked for turned out closer to medium; still not too bad though, especially for the price. As an added bonus the steaks come with bone marrow on the side, which add even more richness to the meat if you want it (you do).

With the 20% off coupon it just came out to just $45 after tax, great value for almost a pound of prime ribeye steak! I give this place a solid 4 stars with the 20% off coupon and would probably give a 3.5 if I didn't have the coupon.",3NJim7jFKLWFLRWxvQd8CA,7,2,4,WsLwGSfj7cNFxTNTfKp7vg

I like dry aged beef, and the Center Cut has a 45 day dry aged option.  The beef was on the edge of spoiled, as it should be at that age, which is that great aged flavor you want.  The steak they cooked for me was cooked perfect.  The problem was it didn't glisten as a well aged steak does because of the age and the fat content. It was dry, tough and didn't have much flavor.  There are so many steakhouses in Las Vegas, I'm surprised this one is still doing business.  My wife had gnocchi with short ribs which was great.  The atmosphere was just okay missing that dark look like the common steakhouses of Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Gallagher's, Del Monaco's etc.  It was not bad just different.  With all the options in Las Vegas, this is not one worth spending over $50 for a steak.  Try a different steakhouse.",X5thsbwLwriWpSiR-uaU1g,0,0,3,jyqNAargJLHNHVaPWlK7Gw

I strongly suggest you order the sides of Jalapeño Fried Corn and the Mac and Cheese. The two sides were honest to God the best tasting sides I've had at a steak house.

This bar has gone through some evolution over the years. When we first started coming here it was an Italian place that was trying too hard to be hip. Then it became the horrid Burger Joint (known best for the $2 graveyard special).

Now that the Margaritaville Casino has taken over the space of the former steakhouse, the steakhouse has moved here and changed from a fussy formal room to a hipper modern look.

The bar has upgraded their selection as well. The wine list is quite good, and they have some good prices during happy hour. In its previous incarnations you'd be hard pressed to find a good glass of wine but not anymore. We ended up in this bar several times because it's one of the few where you can actually hear yourselves converse and they offer decent wines and liquor. Not everyone drinks Coors Light.

From the moment I checked in at the front desk I knew this wasn't going to be my favorite dinner that I've had.

I should have taken a peek since she once again wouldn't take her eyes off the screen when we left.

As for the actual food I don't have any serious complaints. I got the lobster chowder to start which was actually the highlight of the meal. GF got a ceasar salad wedge which she adorably noted wasn't chopped up for her. We both got filets which were decent and I did appreciate the fact that steaks come with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies so not everything is a la carte like at most steakhouses. 

My other major issue with this restaurant was the service was so slow I had a 90 minute dinner and my gf and I each only got 1 drink.

We stayed at the Flamingo and decided to give this steakhouse a shot.   I ordered a center cut filet and when asked if I liked bleu cheese, I said no, so our waiter, Ricky, said ""ok, hold the cheese"".  My boyfriend got the surf and turf with the lobster.  My filet showed up 45 minutes later with bacon wrapped around it, which I thought it was weird because I don't remember seeing that in the description but my friend who got the same thing also had bacon so I thought maybe I read it wrong.  I don't eat bacon so I just took it off and gave them to my friends.  My boyfriend's lobster was super overcooked, it was nasty, but he didn't want to waste food so he still finished it.  Our steaks across the table (about 6 orders or so, different cuts) were all very bland, not much flavor, and it was not tasty at all and I didn't eat more than half of it.  Lobster mac n cheese, ehhh, lobster is, again, overcooked.

Our waiter, Ricky, was very concerned about cleaning the plates off of our tables, because I tried to tell him about the bland tasting steaks and the overcooked lobster, and he kept walking 10 feet away from me taking plates off.  At one point, I turned to my friend and was like ""is he even listening to me?""  He apparently heard that the steak was bland and his response was ""well, that's why we offer so many different sauces to go with the steaks"".  SERIOUSLY! I've NEVER been to a good steak restaurant where the flavor of the steak depended on the SAUCES!

So the bill came, and I got tagged with a $8 charge for bacon, and that was it.  Bad food, ok, my fault for giving you a chance, but you charged me for bacon that I didn't ask for, BACON THAT I DON'T EVEN EAT!  I was livid!  So of course I asked for the manager, and Ricky comes back ""oh, is there anything I could do for you?"" OH, so NOW you want to listen to me, sorry, you've had your chance.  ""There's nothing you can do for me.  Your manager, please"".  So I told the manager the whole story and he was really nice and apologetic and gave us some discounts.

But the worst thing of all, my boyfriend got FOOD POISONING from the lobster!  I thought it tasted weird because it was overcooked, but it turned out to be also not fresh!  We haven't eating anything all day, and everybody else was fine and he was the only person that ate a good amount of the lobster.

When I came back this year, the burger bar was closed and in its place, they opened a ""high end"" steakhouse.  I use the phrase ""high end"" loosely.  This steakhouse leaves much to be desired.  A group of us went here to enjoy a good steak   We saw that the prices were quite high ($40 for a prime rib steak).  However, when in Vegas, you've got to go big.  So, we gave it a try. First off, the waiter was a bit unrefined.  We wanted an unorthodoxed requests (namely a split bill of a big party). However, at the prices that they charge, we figured that they would aim to please. Not so. The waiter had to go and get permission from the manager to split the bill.  REALLY?  You're charging $50 per person and you can't inconvenience yourself just a little bit to make everyone happy?  In the end and after much waiting, the waiter told us that he would split the bill.  THANK YOU!!!!

I then ordered a prime rib steak (medium rare) with an $8 baked potato (yes, an $8 regular old baked potato) and a friend ordered a piece of salmon.  The steak came out half medium rare and half rare.  As I began to eat it, I realized that I was eating a rare lukewarm steak. I was not impressed.  Then, my firend who ordered the salmon got a 4 oz piece of salmon for $40. WHAT??? You give someone a piece of salmon the size of a small burger and charge them $40?  That is ridiculous.  My friend was so upset while the entire table continued to laugh at her.  We were laughing with her not at her (hahahaha).  Then some others ordered hamburger sliders that were litterally the size of a half dollar (probably only 2"" in diameter).  They were so disappointed.

We didn't mind spending the money, but they gave us nothing for the price!!!  That was so disappointing.

My friend and I are very easygoing people, and not demanding customers at all. This does not mean that we should be forgotten, and given sub-par service, which is what we received.There's really only two things a restaurant has to do to give a good dining experience.

1) SERVE ME !  Be attentive and courteous. If I didn't want to be served, I'd save myself the cost of gratuities, and eat someplace where I order up at the counter.

2) Serve me food that is as good, or better than I can cook myself.

The menu at Center Cut  is a la carte. We both started with the lobster bisque ($12). It took a while to arrive at our table. The flavor tasted more of tomato bisque than of lobster. We were half finished with it before our server checked back on us. I asked if we would be getting any bread or rolls, and she said it's on the way. These didn't arrive at the table until we were finished with our soup. This is sad....those rolls that took so long to serve...completely flavorless, as in, like...the worst we'd both ever had. I've always said ""You can easily judge a restaurant by the bread that they serve.""

When our entree's finally arrived....more disappointment.. I had the prime rib med-rare ($38). The price is for the meat only. I did not order any sides (which I think were about $9 ea,). My friend ordered the filet mignon (mediuium). My friend's meat did come with a puff of yorkshire pudding, which she said was flavorless. One positive note.....our meats were cooked to the wellness that we'd ordered.

My friend's filet was over-salted. She had to actually ask for steak sauce to make it palatable. We didn't have time to send anything back, as we had show tickets at another casino and couldn't afford to wait. My prime rib was O.K., but definitely not worth the cost.  For what I paid for the meat alone, we could have gotten two COMPLETE prime rib dinners elsewhere , just as good, with better service.

Like i said...There's too many choices in Vegas, and even if there wasn't, you won't find me here again.",mJVa7joSfof6b0xjVdwXGA,1,0,1,Za4Y_3npBnli8Q2eQn-RqA

We had initially made reservations for 5 people as Center Cut was recommended to us. I now think that whoever did recommend it either does not like us or was playing a sick joke. 

We reserved a table for 8:30pm, showing up on time and told that they will clear our table and to wait at the bar. Upon entering the bar we found several small tables to wait at, but all were filthy from previous meals and had not been cleared. After asking the bartender to get us some clean space we were told we would have to wait, yet this cleaning never occurred in the half an hour we waited past our reservation. The large number of abandoned full beers at the bar area should have been an indication for us to leave then, but we had faith in this place. 

Upon being seated at our table, directly by the front door, we were informed that several of the steak options were sold out. Although upsetting, we were still expecting a decent meal yet this was not to come. When greeted by the manager we were further informed that every steak but two were sold out, along with various appetizers and sides. After deciding what to order based on the small selection we were forced to wait another 30 min for our server to return, where we were told that even more items from this vastly reduced menu we were out of stock. One of our group was also fairly sure that after ordering gray goose, was in fact served a much cheaper vodka. 

After all of this we quietly requested the manager comp us a bottle of wine, fairly inexpensive for this so-called high end steakhouse. The manager returned in a furry and visibly shaking, informing us it would not be happening, so we offered to leave and were told to go. 

It seemed as if the staff just couldn't handle having actual customers, or they just don't care since most are tourists and won't return anyways. This was highly disappointing, yet we did manage to find a decent place just 5 minutes away. They tried to blame the shortages on the convention that we going on at the time, yet this event occurs every year and is not difficult to plan against.

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Since you can't actually eat anything it seems to be just a waste of everyone's time. It wouldn't have been an issue had they told us when we made the reservation earlier in the day, but failing to inform us then expecting us to eat only chicken at a steak house is unacceptable.",oynPTHIEwk2cHAXcUxFAaw,5,0,1,iA2QvpNQo4VJ_nBNZ5x5hw

3951258,2013-07-03,1,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"I really want to like this place.  I even ate here twice within 3 days thinking my first experience was just a fluke, but even after giving this place a second chance.  This place is just over-rated.  As part of their ""Total Rewards"" card player, Center Cut has a special price for people who has the player card.  

Our first visit:

-- Lime-poached shrimp cocktail - the shrimp was very large.  You get 3 large shrimp and it was pretty tasty.  It's not hard to get this wrong.
-- Lobster Bisque - it was delicious.  I wish it was hotter.
-- 8 oz center cut filet mignon - Ordered Medium rare and it came out perfect, but the taste to the meat doesn't have that ""AGED"" factor.  
-- 20 oz Bone-In Ribeye - Ordered Medium rare and it came out well done.  Returned the meat and the waiter was rude about it.  My boyfriend is almost done with his filet and finally my Ribeye returned and it was RARE.  The meat looks as if it barely touched the grilled.  It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.  Then I returned the meat for some extra grilling time.  Ribeye came back and it was super salty and the meat went from RARE to MEDIUM.  Very DISAPPOINTED.  

Our second visit: (Thinking this would be different experience)

-- Ordered the Lobster bisque again and this time arrived extremely watery and it wasn't HOT.  It was just luke warm. 
-- Ordered the American Wagyu (eye of ribeye) - in Medium Rare and came out Medium.  Learning from the previous experience, I decided to tough it out and just ate my steak Medium.  

In Summary: 

This place is extremely OVER-RATED.  For the prices what they charged, we felt how in the world this place charges so much when their quality of their food CONSISTENCY is just not there?  Their over-priced steaks tasted CHEAP.  

And on top of this experience, the waiter tried charging us ""FLAMINGO WATER"" $4 for 2 people.  WHAT????? And he tried to pull a fast one by charging us the regular price versus the total reward card price.  We addressed it and the bill came back $14 less.  

If you want a steak place, don't let their decor fooled you.  YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED if you are into high end steak places such as Morton's, Fleming's, Del Frisco's double eagle steak house.... You will get your money worth at these well establishment instead of this wannabe fancy steak place ""The Center Cut"".  

We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.

We returned to find our table has been given away. I immediately asked for the manager. Amber Crain rudely says ""I am the manager"" I asked her why they gave away our table when we clearly told them we would be back and we were going to the restroom. She began to give me attitude so I asked for her GM and her name. She picked up the phone and just as I though she was calling her GM she actually called security and embarrassed  me and my husband (I can only hope this would happen to a Caucasian patron). All of this was unnecessary! As a Manger she should have apologized and offered us a solution. Maybe a new table. Anything besides attitude and embarrassment. The security officers were very nice and understood my frustration. They told me Amber is pregnant and probably hormonal. As a server at an upscale restaurant who had been in the industry for 15 years and I have had 3 children while being a server. My professionalism would never allow me to treat a guest like that and if I did my managers would not tolerate it at all! We care about our guests experiences where I work (no matter what race or gender.) Amber either needs a reality check, new profession, or to go on maternity leave if she can't control herself. 

I hope management does the right this here and I pray this never happens to anyone else. After I left I had an amazing Dinner and overall experience at Giada's best $300 I spent. I am happy Amber drove me away to have a great dinner with my husband and put money I  someone else's pocket. Good Job Amber! You ma'am are doing your restaurant such a great service.

My party ordered the jumbo lobster, porterhouse, and cider-braised pork shank and the boneless ribeye. Most of my party ordered the prime rib but the restaurant was sold out at 8pm on a Saturday evening. We were a bit disappointed but our alternative choices tasted pretty good. We also ordered the truffle mac & cheese and the wild mushrooms. I highly recommend ordering the truffle mac & cheese. It was heavenly.

The dessert menu had some great selections. We finished off the night with chocolate lava cake and the flaming coffee. Both were OK. The flaming coffee was more about the spectacle of making the fiery drink at the table rather than how it tastes. I recommend passing on the flaming coffee for dessert.

Despite its totally unpretentious cred (in the Flamingo, no celebrity chef, no fanfare or hoopla), this turned out to be a solid steakhouse experience with a little extra flair in the form of a unique and fabulous foodie appetizer called the bacon satay trio (photo attached, but doesn't do it justice). This is served as 6 slices of super-thick-cut bacon (about 1/4""thick!) and a roasted Jalapeno pepper on a huge rectangular block of pink Himalayan salt, with bleu cheese and spices and a pot of honey-bourbon syrup dipping sauce. FUCK, YEAH! I'm not even a big bacon fan, and this was amazing!

The rest of the food was good, but nothing special: I had the garbage salad and a fully-loaded baked potato, both of which were great, but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere. My friend had a filet ($41 with Total Rewards card, $44 without), which he said was fine as well, but again, nothing you couldn't get a million other places in Vegas. We also shared a bottle of wine.

Overall, despite the ""nothing special""ness of the food, it was one of the best meals I've had in a LONG time! Granted, I was high at the time, so that may have had some bearing on my taste buds...but I honestly think it was the bacon appetizer that set the tone and really made the meal. That thing was REALLY good! 

Service was good, ambiance is sort of cruise-chip-modern -- sort of a cheapo version of the sort of chi-chi steakhouse decor you see at other more expensive Strip steakhouses. There are TVs all over the walls, which at the time of my visit were playing an NFL game, lending a definite casual vibe -- and the guests were dressed to match; flip flops, board shorts, very casual dress. But some of the TVs were also playing slideshows of old photos of Vegas, which I found pretty interesting and cool, and lent a sort of old-Vegas vibe.

The one sad failure was the bread basket, which consisted of two lame soft-bread rolls of uninspired pedigree. But, since bread is poison, this could actually be looked at as a huge plus -- less carby nastiness to tempt you.

Anyway, if you must have steak at the Flamingo, by all means I recommend this place. But there are bette/more interesting steakhouse experiences in town, at similar price points.

What I would recommend here is just sharing appetizers at the bar -- not sure you can do this, but they have a pretty swanky lounge out front, with a better view/ambiance than the actual restaurant, and if you could sit here and have some drinks with your bacon satay, it would be a pretty cool evening.",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,7,5,4,YFDZqIQPaFSL7iBJLfapJA

Dined at this establishment on Saturday night with my girlfriend for her birthday. The ambience is nice and cozy. Actually a bit too warm to dine comfortably. We had just flown in from Philadelphia and were pretty tired excited for a grand dinner. 

My gf got the Chilean seabass which tasted pretty bland. Could have used some salt, maybe a splash of citrus might help liven the dish. Fish was definitely over cooked. Seabass is supposed to be juicy and flaky when hit with a fork not dry and crumbly. 

For me, I ordered a boneless ribeye medium rare which came out well done. It was sent back and I received a new steak after I had lost my appetite. Again the food was very bland. Steaks are supposed to be flavorful. Heck, my steak fries was the best thing about dinner. 

Service. My oh my. Our server spoke down to us the entire time as if we were second class citizens. You usually pay the extra money in an expensive steak house to experience importance and most of all some fun while being served. The way our server spoke to us made it apparent that he did not want us there and made us feel very uncomfortable. His tone of voice was very agitated towards us. Meanwhile he would grovel at the feet of other clients. Perhaps because we looked young and he did not respect our age. This by far was worst experience I have ever had. 

I'll end on a good note. Our water server Anthony was by far the friendliest person there. He knew what it meant to be human and how to talked normally and respectfully to people.

Why not, $22 for Asparagus and Lobster on top of my $48 Ribeye. My choice selection was very good yet for the add-on, I would suggest keep your meat simple & save the $22.  The hollandaise type sauce was a bit too rich and change the flavor of the steak.  I give this restaurant a 4 star because the waiter was friendly, direct & to the point.  The food came out on time & if you are a total rewards member, you get a discount on the food.  My overall dining experience was pleasant and I am sure I will return.",ySOWHay3yeaadfuXOuagMg,2,0,4,lnf8oIwXMlR93UHaC15R1Q

Everything looked ok when it was served except my husbands lobster had just a tiny cup of butter with it - a restaurant of this caliber, you would think, would serve it warmed over a flame. Upon trial of our food, the steak was dry, tasteless and not cooked medium as I had ordered. My husbands lobster was chewy, a bit rubbery and simply not fresh. There was a green vegetable of sorts served under my steak along with some mashed potatoes that I didn't know were there until I began inspecting my steak for any - any at all - tasteful portions.

4670140,2017-06-13,1,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"I'd give this place probably 3.5 stars if it was at a slightly lower price point, but where it is, you expect better food, service, drinks and ambience for the money.  A tip for anyone who happens across my review while considering Center Cut; if you're staying at the Flamingo, check the check-in coupon book that most people toss on the dresser as there's typically a 20% off coupon in there, which helps bring the value up a bit.  Those not staying but Total Rewards players might have success in getting one of these books from the nice people at the TR desk; no guarantees but I've seen it work.

Okay, drinks, like another review I happened to read, don't get a mojito here; sweet, weak and pricey.

Onto the food; perhaps other people have a different taste for it, but what I thought was a very unique accompaniment to the filet is a bone marrow still in the bone, or removed and served as a side.  I ate it, would probably eat it again, but nothing about the taste or texture really made me think hey I'd pay extra for this or will seek it out in the future, so my opinion is that it didn't really add to the meal once I actually tried it.

The tuna entree was not a stand out; have had similar in many places, and probably for slightly less.

As far as ambience; it's very open, meaning loud and not private, both from other diners, as well as people strolling past to/from the Linq or casino floor since the hallway to those, and the pool, goes right past.  Service was average.

So I'm not really too disappointed in the place, but for the price, you could definitely find better values in Vegas when you're getting into the $80+/pp range for people who have drinks with their meal.",vhMMA4vymXwtoTbIrD1g6A,3,2,2,jQuY6dnX4XGUo_7ssEmxZA

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. After congratulating us on our anniversary, our hostess proceeded to seat us at a four top that was located next to the kitchen door and under a TV set. Amazingly, we noticed that the couple ahead at the host station had no reservation, yet were seated at a booth located in a much more desirable location.

The good news was that, upon expressing our disappointment with our waitperson, we  were seated in a booth in a very nice location. Our server was very good, but not overly personable. We both ordered the French Onion soup, which was very good. My wife ordered a fillet mignon, which she enjoyed. I ordered a bone-in ribeye, which was also tasty, but was more than 30% fat. 

Overall, the atmosphere (televisions located throughout the restaurant? Really?) is not what anyone would expect from the upscale steakhouse, which the restaurant considers itself to be.

When I requested to speak to the Manager, I told her how pleased that we were with how our waitperson handled the situation. I also expressed our disappointment with how the hostess handled things. Rather than an apology, the Manager decided to defend the hostess by stating that ""we never know where a patron might like to be seated"". REALLY?

I ordered the Wagyu Meatballs & Polenta as an appetizer. It would've been nice if I had gotten more than three meatballs in the large bowl they came in. Most of the appetizer was just sauce. It was good, but paying $14 for three small meatballs? Come on. 
For the main meal I ordered a Kansas City Strip Steak and a pureed potato as a side. The food came in a decent time for the amount of people there were. The steak itself was okay.

The pureed potato that I ordered came out as a baked potato. I mentioned it to the waiter who apologized and said it would take 20 minutes for a new dish to come out.

For what you pay here I was expecting decent quality steak cooked perfectly. It's about $40-$50 a steak (each steak is served with exactly 4 green beans that were previously frozen and a cherry tomato) and any sides are additional. It took an hour and a half to get our meals and there were several things in our party that got sent back. They over cooked some steaks, gave people in our party the wrong plates, and some of the vegetable sides were raw. I was at least hoping that the quality of the meat would be good but I've honestly bought better quality beef at a grocery store or warehouse club and have been served more flavorful steaks at chain restaurants which is pathetic. The flavor just wasn't there. They didn't even bother to properly salt it and my medium steak was black on the outside and red on the inside which made for an awful texture. I really don't think anyone in the kitchen had a clue. Maybe this was just an off night or because we had a large party but the head chef in my opinion, should be ashamed.

We were here for Restaurant week our 4th outing to spread the love and #helpoutdineout. We participate whenever we can and enjoy most of the places we have gone. We had reservations from open table and arrived a few minuted early. We were seated right away. our drink orders were taken and brought right away. As many well know this is a pet peeve and so far so good. 
The decor is very simple and very open. Our waiter was not exactly a vibrant person and I actually learned more about the food by listening to the waiter behind us. I cannot remember our waiters name. We had Chilled spiced prawns as an appetizer. Good taste and nothing extraordinary. We then had soup and salad I chose the Lobster Bisque and Josie the Caesar salad. The soup seemed very salty and somewhat oily. Had Some lobster flavor and except for these two little oyster balls, there was not a hint of meat. I may be spoiled with how I get it at Costco. The Caesar Salad was not impressive and barely resembled a Caesar salad in flavor and taste. Actually tasted like a bottled or canned dressing. Entrees, I had the 10oz Filet and Josie had the Dry Aged Cowboy Ribeye. My filet was cooked as ordered Mid-Rare. The outside at first was a bit dry and chewy but overall when cut through was mostly tender and juicy. As for taste, Nothing exceptional stands out. Just an ordinary tasting steak. Josie's ribeye was also cooked to order and was tender to cut. Ribeye itself was nothing of a standout in flavor. Dinner in general was quite bland. If this was a throwback steakhouse then it when way back to days when flavor wasn't needed to impress. The desert round was a simple chocolate cake and a simple cheese cake. I guess you could say that simple was the overall theme.

5216860,2012-05-20,0,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Center Cut Steakhouse. New (open since March 2012) to the Vegas dining scene, Center Cut has to its advantage a young, creative, and very talented chef, Ian Delph, who has trained in Sonoma and Boston before taking the helm at Center Cut. Delph seeks out unique, organic, and fresh ingredients that will best compliment the prime cuts of meat featured on the menu. 

A few examples of this creativity include Scottish Salmon with a truffle sauce, pink mashed potatoes that are organically grown and are actually pink, and bib lettuce (that the table next to us ordered) that literally looked like art. Every dish was prepared with panache and flawless presentation. Both my husband and I were completely impressed with the presentation, and the flavors were literally ""melt in your mouth."" The food is nothing short of delicious, and ranks right up there with any of the top Vegas steak houses. In my opinion Center Cut is better because it's not a chain, and the chef gets to use his creative skills a lot more in a non-chain restaurant. We both had a caesar salad to start, and we agreed that it was one of the best caesar salads we'd had in a long time. 

Located inside the Flamingo, the theme is ""old school Vegas"" with a modern and contemporary twist. The Flamingo is one of the original Vegas casinos, and throughout your meal you are treated to still shots of life in Vegas, from the 1930's until now. These still photos are shown throughout the restaurant on multiple TV's and feature the likes of Sonny and Cher, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lewis, Wayne Newton, Elvis... Very cool to watch, and a great compliment to the swanky, sexy feel of the steak house. 

Center Cut has a great wine list too, and we enjoyed our waiter, David, who went to culinary school and is currently training to be a master Sommelier. David recommended an excellent cab that paired perfectly with our meal, and the espresso I had along with the cheesecake was enough to tip me over the edge to give Center Cut 5 stars. Only drawbacks are that the restaurant is open to the bright casino area, and there are no restrooms inside (you have to walk to the lobby area of the casino for the nearest restroom). But the food, the service, and the overall experience are worthy of 5 stars. Center Cut (once discovered), I'm sure will rank among a handful of truly great steakhouses in Vegas. Right now it's still pretty easy to get a table here.",TzUbr6BiQwR1bNfVOuE4GQ,5,3,5,0bqN-KWLl6o_3MXAJEM6NA

Started off with the Garbage Salad, which upon initial reading, I thought it said Cabbage Salad.  Who names their salad ""Garbage""? How about Kitchen Sink? Everything? Oh well, they had me at hearts of palm, spring greens, kalamata olives, bleu cheese, baby heirloom tomatoes and cilantro vinaigrette.  The salad was great and I, a tomato-hater, even ate a couple of them.  I ordered the New York Oscar Style - $22 extra for a couple of King Crab legs, two asparagus spears, and Bernaise Sauce.  Definitely worth it.  The steak came with a popover, which was something I hardly ever see.  The meat was cooked perfectly and I ended up taking home half of the steak.  BF ordered the prime rib, which came with au jus - period. It was a good thing he said yes to a potato or he would have had a sorry looking dinner.

And we knew it. Best side that was ordered was the truffle macaroni and cheese. BEST Mac and cheese I've ever had. Flavors are on point and it was just so silky and pleasant to eat. Broccolini was just Broccolini, mashed potatoes were good, asparagus was perfectly cooked. Then I ordered the potato gratin... Which was pretty bland. But cooked well.

I came here for a late night dinner. I received a voicemail earlier that day regarding the time of my reservation. I made reservation through Open Table for 10:30PM however the maitre d' left a voicemail requesting that if I can come earlier at 10:15PM because they were going to close earlier that evening. My only concern at that time was my flight would arrive at Vegas at 9:00PM and if I took the taxi with the Las Vegas traffic I didn't know if I can make the reservation on time. Luckily my cousin picked me up from the airport. After checking in at Bally's I had to rush to get to Center Cut Steakhouse. The time was 10:05PM. I thought I could take the bridge from Bally's to The Crowell, but the bridge would be close for construction during my stay at Vegas. Sometimes Vegas reminds me of the UC Berkeley campus - there's always construction going around. To get to Center Cut Steakhouse I would have to take the bridge from Bally's to Bellagio, then the bridge from Bellagio to Caesars Palace, then the bridge from Caesars Palace to Flamingo. Once inside the Flamingo I had to ask one of the staff from poker tables where Center Cut Steakhouse was. He gracious and kind to escort me there. I ended up getting to the Steakhouse at 10:25PM. Why am I writing the first half about rushing to the steakhouse? At the end I had to ask myself was rushing to Center Cut Steakhouse worth it.

I only ordered two dishes. That was my plan all along. The first dish was foie gras, which was served as an appetizer. Anyone who knows me know I love foie gras. The presentation of the foie gras appeared seared and served with arugula. From appearance the foie gras looked seared but the color was in fact a glaze. When I took a bite of the foie gras it wasn't seared but served as a touchon. Once I had foie gras served as a touchon in a sandwich. The texture for me wasn't appealing because it was like eating a stick of butter. The foie gras at Center Cut Steakhouse was rich and creamy. Eating the arugula with the foie gras cuts the richness of the foie gras. The foie gras was a pretty nice course to start with. The next dish was a bone-in ribeye that I requested to be cooked as medium rare. Normally I like my steak rare but for bone-in steak I order it medium rare because this way of cooking makes the bone more flavorable and transfers the flavor to the meat. The steak was moist and tender. I enjoyed the steak a lot and was better than the foie gras.

Am I glad I went? Yes. Was it worth rushing? No. Overall for these two dishes including tip I paid about $79. For the amount I paid nothing really stood out on my two dishes for dinner. The two dishes were decent quality, but because of the quality were slightly overprice in my opinion. This place isn't too bad if you want a nice steak in a casual setting. Just be careful that you don't overpay for your meal.",4hVHTZhy70Sw4gmQfk1pJg,5,3,3,pH-bxDiheHU8h1oysC3ywg

 I have visited this restaurant a few years back and had fond memories of beautifully crafted Bloody Mary and a delicious rib eye.
It popped up on Groupon radar and I was an easy sell. 
 Oy, things have changed. 
 The tone for the evening was set when my Bloody Mary arrived, rivaling the free cocktails dished out in the slot pit in taste and presentation. 
 The calimari was full of filler deep fried pepperchinis and oysters Rockefeller were plain embarrassing- drooping with melted cheese and full of greenish liquid from soggy spinach. We actually engaged the waiter on the oyster preparation and he explained it was ""a matter of preference"". Basically, if you are into droopy over cheesed fare, your preference will be met. 
 I ordered 10oz ribeye, medium. 
 When your meat comes out gray on color, you sort of wonder- if this is medium, is well done charred through and through? I painstakingly sawed through it with bluntest knife ever and wondered what differentiated this piece of meat from prime rib dished out at any buffet in town, aside from price tag. It's served with creamed horse radish smeared artfully in the plate, I had to ask for regular horse radish, which was promptly brought out in a little vessel. 
 For side dishes I ordered wild mushrooms and fries. 
 The mushrooms only appeared on the bill, never on the table, so can't comment. 
 The fries turned into be thick cut potato wedges. When I say thick cut, picture a hefty baking potato sliced in 6 or so. Yup, them are ""fries"". I didn't even attempt to eat them, I'm not into bulging hunks of potato. 
 I realize the entire review sounds like one giant b-fest, but this was by far the most ridiculous culinary experience I've had in a very long time. The only redeeming quality was promptness of service and the fact that the mushrooms that never made it from the kitchen were deducted from the bill, after we asked. Overall, I see zero reason to ever return.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,3,5,2,uDv2tudPktvYuX-42rqBKw
5622453,2017-01-26,2,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"I thought I did a review of this restaurant long ago but I'll be glad to gush about again. I came here completely against my will and like so many people who've passed this restaurant without a second thought, I wasn't expecting. Located inside the Flamingo and across the flamingo sanctuary you wouldn't expect to find a great steakhouse in this location but I was incredibly wrong. Center Cut Steakhouse is worth stopping by. 

Deco - 3 to 4 stars

It's hard to give this restaurant a high rating on the interior design considering the gaudiness of the rest of the hotel but once you walk inside you are enveloped in black. The sounds of the casino fade to low background noise and within the realm of the dining room floor you are in a steakhouse. Black and white pictures of celebrities and old Vegas are on the walls and flat screen TVs don't let you forget about sports anytime soon. It is a comfortable setting meant for overeating and indulgence.

Staff - 4 stars

The staff was incredibly hospitable. Maybe it becomes a given since it is Vegas but the service from the host to the wait staff were all hospitable and friendly. Suggestions on the food and drinks were never pushed on us and it was easy to find someone for help.

Food - 5 stars

The food was what won me over. All my reservations melted away as soon as I took my first bites of the sauteed wild mushrooms and prime rib. Being a steakhouse you order your entree and sides separately. I ordered several different sides to go with my medium rare prime rib and it was a great life choice. As mentioned previously the mushrooms were so savory; a buttery garlic coating accentuated the natural flavors of the wild mushrooms. The baked potato was stuffed with butter, chives, sour cream, cheese, and bacon and baked perfectly. There was a balance of smokey flavors from the skin with a hug like interior when eaten. My partner in crime had the bone in ribeye steak Oscar style (with crab and Bearnaise sauce smothering the steak) and it was perfect. The meat was cooked to perfection, having a nice crisp to the edges but staying red on the inside. Matched with some of the best crab I've ever had for an Oscar style steak it was hard for me not wanting to eat both our entrees. 

Price - 3 stars

The price is steep and it might be one of the reasons why you would feel like this isn't worth visiting, especially when there are buffets abound. However, trust me when I say the food was great, especially if you are a guest at one of the Caesar's hotels. They will give you a packet of discounts and this is one of those restaurants it applies to.

Conclusion

I never thought I'd ever say the Flamingo has an amazing steakhouse but it does. Center Cut is worth a try at least once in your many visits to Las Vegas. Treat yo self!",ofMESFOXORl9Ng5KGGf4kg,5,2,4,4OZpxy_c6e7l6y2unhem4A
5623821,2017-10-22,1,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"We had some dining credits so ate here on a Friday night around 9. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, the 20 ounce porter house and a Maine lobster as entrees and wild mushrooms and a baked potato as sides. This was way more than enough food for two people, especially with the complimentary bread basket. 

The calamari was crispy, but was more batter than squid. Recommend skipping appetizers or trying a different one. The porter house was good - though a bit chewy. The main lobster was yummy - well seasoned and perfectly cooked. So were the sides, I'd definitely order the mushrooms again. 

We also tried the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce for dessert. Although it was beautifully presented, the many layers of cake and filling was a bit of a mushy and chewy like texture. Sweetness more than chocolate powered through the flavors. 

The service was a bit disappointing- the bus boy was oblivious when he took away our plates and sprayed some type of liquid (maybe from the lobster butter) onto my husband. We were both in a bit of shock so didn't say anything.

Not worth the HIGH price. This used to be a fancier burger joint. Now its a ""high class"" fancy restaurant. Charles had to be the absolute worst waiter. He has a bad attitude and was extremely unpleasant to have around. Charles never smiled and walked/paced around our table looking like a complete angry ass. He was pushy with what HE thought we should eat. He even made an absurd comment regarding one of my friends and him (now I am paraphrasing) ""needing more food because he was the biggest one of the group"" and what he had ordered was too little. The ONLY time we received any smiles and a pleasant personality from Charles, was near or around the time we were to receive our check.....oh and also after we ordered and were committed to stay.

My steak was ok....but for $45, I expected an amazing steak. Far from amazing for sure. My friends also thought their dinner was average and NOT worth what they paid. This place is ""so fancy"" their water comes in glass bottles.....which was tasty and refreshing, but not free. 

The funny thing about this place and their staff is that last year when it was a fancier burger joint, we went in and sat down....looked at the menu....and had the same ""no personality"" waiter......we simply walked out and went somewhere else. We should have done the same this year.

5888893,2013-05-08,1,yEyA7uILKG97qnyx3K2WAg,"I can't believe how the people can rate this place so high.

First.  Just past year, this location used to be a burger joint.  Every year for the past 6 to 7 years, they had to change restaurants due to poor business.  Decor of this steakhouse hasn't changed from when they ysed to be a burger joint.  If you are looking for a classy steakhouse atmosphere, this isn't it.

Second.  This is considered a high end steakhouse.  Most of the upscale steakhouse with-in strip uses prime cut.  Here, they use choice cust and charges for prime price.  We had center cut New York steak and Bone0in Ribeye for dinner.  It was the worst.  They were both so fatty.  Half of the 20oz steak was that of FAT.  For New York steak, there were multiple veins going through surrounded by layers of fat.  Based on this, we probably could have a better steak from Outback steakhouse for the 1/3 of the price of this place.

Third.  They were playing a music in the steakhouse.  They seems to be using the same sound track as the casino.  80's pop.Who ever heard of music being played at a steakhouse.

Fourth.  Sae cheap furniture that was used when it was the burger joint.

If you are looking for a good steakhouse, I would not recommend this place.  There are a lot better place for good steaks than gere.  You can go to Primes at Bellagui, Old Homestead at Caesars, even the Sterling Steak house at Bally's was better this crap they call steak at Center Cut Steakhouse.  And Ruth Chris just opened up at Harrahs.  Go everywhere else but here.  I am sure, like all the other restauarnat that went out of business at this location, this steakhouse will follow very soon.",9spOHzbNneeJ4WUumAa6oA,2,0,1,R3aiTogsu-DsaV4rKQbAuQ

Very good food!! I would highly recommend going here for a great dinner.",XoX1kTnAPxR9eCO7g3u4Vg,0,0,3,QrGt9txKcxyHmLd-IJziFw

We didn't have dessert, no room, but the dishes that passed our table looked amazing especially the strawberry shortcake. Wait staff was extremely busy. This place could use maybe one or two more to cover tables. Our team of waiters were both hospitable and checked on us frequently.  A little to loud to be a romantic place for dinner. TVs wrap the entire place but only two programs playing. You need to dress up, please no jeans.   Wine selection was decent, would've like more by the glass selections.  Will be back in the future.",n8jih3gTggth55cbJCUfqA,0,0,5,tt3icnSWpvF8ag9gJCU8fA

We got a very good Sangria, shared a Caesar salad, and shared prime rib with broccolini and mashed potatoes and the berries and cream dessert. Everything was great and we didn't even break 100 bucks for two of us. The mashed potatoes are a MUST. So good!",jscwXAi6lSUwtm8Jpxce0g,0,0,4,Fz9O59Fa-Tel0t6CxNKPow
