She said no and justified that different outlets have different rates...quite bluntly....Then she toasted the flatizzas with cheese and she started to pack em up without even asking me if i need to add any vegetables, which was quite a common sense...when she was trying to put em in boxes, i interrupted and asked her to add some veggies..she posed a grin look..as if i was asking a favor...when i tasted the flatizza it was very hard and had tough time to bite em up..Horrible service..Alyissa you better need some customer service classes...you spoil the brand name..",ecas09FMI4q5baVr0NUcug,0,0,2,yDn6oEY2Seze0KKcxQxhqw

On multiple occasions they have ran out of spinach, avocado, and lettuce. And each time the employees do not do anything to acknowledge or make up for the difference. 

I really do not recommend this location, but unfortunately am not left with many other options as this is the closest Subway to my workplace.",yRWQcoJJDXsKhrEwYFd5_w,0,0,2,a5AVDC0_Ix907vL28vFS2A

This place tries to save money and I'm doing that the customer ends up getting a raw deal. The meat is old, the veggies look horrible and the place just can't seem to get it rite. I've had it with this pale and will never buy a sandwich here again. Don't try and save money but yet and still charge the customer  the same price for old meat and veggies. Shame on this place!!!!",aZm1lsUjVQ91p2Sbn6LkTQ,0,0,1,ahRgnC-E_EDk8PS8m0a3vw

Guess that's how they make heir profit. The girls that work there are lazy. Don't greet you, and aren't too big on wanting to serve you. 
Also skimped out on the toppings.",3sC_UdFf2DDm3TrzxqKjHQ,1,0,1,mlVus7gSLeiG7-B9ZQoAvw

How often do you see a Subway share the same room with Winchell's Donuts? NEVER.

So you want to eat healthy by getting a 6 inch turkey on wheat. Maybe a footlong if you're hungry. Of course lots of extra vegetables. 

As you move over to the cashier, BAM! DONUTS! It hits you hard like a bad vague topic on the Vegas Yelp Talk Thread.  So much for eating healthy. When a chocolate glazed donut is screaming out at you, you cant help but rescue that poor, sugary, chocolate goodness from it's glass case dungeon.

Ok so this review kind of strayed off the main road and into a dark forested area so let me try to restore order.

If you are not easily distracted by shiny things then you should always take advantage of Subway's specials every month. There is always a designated footlong for 5 bucks. So far, every February is Februany. You can get most of their footlongs for 5 bucks. The premium ones this year they have for 6 bucks.

Other than wanting a footlong roast beef on a maple bar, I dont see why they have Winchell's up in here. Its like trying to run a marathon with stilettos on. It's just not a good idea.

Service here is hit or miss depending on who just happens to be working at the time. Some of them see it as just a your basic minimum wage job. Others just plain dont wanna work. 

On a positive note, the wifi signal is very strong from the Starbucks next door so you can stay here all day and play World of Warcraft or whatever choice of game you are addicted to. Im sure the employees will leave you alone as long as you buy a sandwich or two.

So to me its just ok. Every time I have gone here, it's a different atmosphere. Sometimes good. Sometimes bad.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,3,4,3,BkHbwDR2HnyyvWY14PqkBg

Girl working by herself (Every Wednesday as she put it), has a constant line of people waiting, Every Wednesday morning. Obviously Management is as poor as the Service, only worried about the Bottom-Line!
A toasted sandwich, yet the egg comes out Ice Cold. Definitely a training problem. More worried about Up-Selling for the additional charges than about getting the order correct!

This location is obviously more focused on profit than product quality and Customer Service.",XxyyTYuL7KrrBFg8a14bEA,0,0,1,0RXu3Xz2Y8_d_iGdtpzPoQ

The entire staff doesn't  know what they're doing. I'm not sure if they're all new or not but it's ridiculous especially during the lunch hour. Management needs to do some serious training. People don't have much time to wait especially during lunch break.,-AXCpsIGp5Wq1e6wVX4YlA,0,0,1,zNqNWygOhnQ8JNqfjBRwAg
4414965,2017-12-15,0,ktJR5j14AH-Cc45J7jJ9nw,Good as any other Subway. They were out of steak and some bread. Place looked dirtier than most subways and the one person that served me seemed to not know what she was doing. I went there a couple times with the same results. The manager was there last time and was nice. She was directing people to conduct inventory and helped during rush our at lunch.

Used to enjoy the $5-foot long, which is no longer available. Anyway, I don't think I would want to come back to this store any time soon in the near future. The flat bread and the meat tasted very very weird today, compared to the long history of experience I have with Subway. The texture felt different and my hands, from touching the food, smelt very artificial all day. Wanted to puke, which never happened before.",qb8CfVnTMj-rb6a6hYXN6Q,1,0,1,0vQJxK7txCgIjDDrZx_pvA

It's a small location, with a rather small dining room. They cram quite a few tables in there, so there are lots of spots to sit while you grub on a sandwich, donut or both. Everything seemed clean although I was less than impressed with the veggie selection. The spinach looked a little wilted and the cucumbers and olives were slightly shriveled and dry. The sandwich was standard and it's a convenient location so I'd probably give them a try again. I still prefer The Spicy Pickle that is located just across the street for a wider variety of menu options and freshness.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,1,2,3,x5Te5IReHMlZbLNsBa21Iw
