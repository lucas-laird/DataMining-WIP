Great staff.  Great service.  You should be ashamed of yourself if you're wasting your time buying pizza at chain restaurants with a gem like this available!",OfBF_6IvMnCjE9dfAKOBlQ,1,0,5,3Y8hC1-OoH8m0s7n_RiyWg
139508,2014-04-09,0,b7Y4dIggAacPum1tF3NpKg,"After a week of traveling eating dry Sammie's and whatever else I could make from the passenger car seat we made it home and decided to have a really hearty meal. I called in an order for delivery and less than 45 minutes later we were siting at the table,  staring in awe at these beautiful enormous pizzas.

 We ordered a Chicago style pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, green and black olives, onions and green peppers. It was ahhhhmazing! The tomatoes were ripe and tangy. The green olives added the perfect twang. The sausage tasted fresh and juicy. Seriously the perfect slice of pie! Did I mention it was absolutely beautiful? It was!!

The kiddos wanted a pepperoni on double dough. It was cheesy, not too greasy, and the crust held up well even with the littles. The crust has a buttery cracker flavor that is so delicious. 

And because we were starving we added a spicy Italian calzone. The meat was tender and juicy with an excellent spicy flavor. When I tasted the giardiniera I was so impressed. It was tangy with the perfect vinegar and spice. I think I could eat it alone! I not so stealthily tried to swipe a chunk of cauliflower off my husbands plate. He was too quick and his fork promptly blocked mine. I actually started looking up recipes to try to replicate the giardiniera. yUMMY!
I think I'll add it to my next pizza too! 

We will certainly order pizza here again. Seriously wonderful, filling, and tasty pies!!!",zI0lQ3hjl-7BJ8UGxFKALw,1,0,5,1jNQQ3hVCj88bTkjpiJytw

Well, SB51 rolls around and the owner says we're ""pulling one over"" and proceeds to cancel our orders, and told us to ""take our business elsewhere"" and put us on a no sell list.

All of us have been regular cutomers on a weekly basis for years. Over the years we have collected the 50% off coupons that come on the pizza boxes (12 needed for one pizza). As a customer who worked in the service industry for over 15 years, I understand Super Bowl can be a very busy day. With this being known, I called the day before to make sure they were accepting coupons and they said ""yes!"" Again, knowing they were going to be busy, I called three hours in advance on Sunday to place my order. After a few of my neighbors placed similar orders using their 50% off coupons, the owner Ken told one of my neighbors that he didn't know what we were trying to pull but he didn't have time for half price pizzas and we could take our business elsewhere and hung up! Wow...so my neighbor called back and Ken said he was canceling all of our orders, that we were no longer welcome at Rosati's, to take our business elsewhere, and hung up again! As good repeat cutomers and trying to do the right thing with calling the day before as well as placing our order three hours in advance, this is how he treats his customers! With all this being said, I hope people take this into consideration when thinking about eating at Rosati's. I refuse to support a ""classless"" business owner who does not value his customers.

263196,2017-02-06,0,b7Y4dIggAacPum1tF3NpKg,"I will NEVER be eating at Rosati's on Durango/Grand Teton in Las Vegas.  My family and friends have spent literally thousands of dollars each per year at this place since it opened to have Ken the owner/manager completely disrespect us.  Rosati's has a 50% off coupon on their pizza boxes (which says nothing about not being able to use them on certain days or holidays) and when you collect 12 of them, you get a pizza for 50% off your next pizza.  Well 3 families in the neighborhood had 12 each and ordered pizza for the super bowl Let me remind you these were not free pizzas, they were 50% off! So we respectfully called a couple of days earlier to see if we could place this order and use the coupons we accumulated all year (which by the way every order was at least $50 x's the 36 coupons we had which that alone is $1,800.00) and was told there would be no problem.  So when we called to order Ken said ""I don't know what you are trying to pull but I don't have time to give pizzas away for half price"" and hung up! We called back to see what the problem was because one of the neighbors had already placed his order with another employee with no problem and he told us ""we were no longer welcome and to find another establishment"". So we will and I hope others do too.  He gave away an entire communities worth of business over 3 pizzas half off? The great part about this story is that one pizza which was ""approved"" to be delivered was (which was a $35.00 pizza) and we told the driver we were told by his boss we were no longer welcome and refused it. Our order between the 3 homes would have been around $40.00 and he had to throw away a $35.00 pizza? What an idiot. But ""he doesn't care"", he doesn't give one shit about your business.

Pizza is very subjective but for me Rosatis is the best I have found in Las Vegas.  I recommend eating it there because it is much better right out of the oven.

644017,2011-06-06,1,b7Y4dIggAacPum1tF3NpKg,"Went here tonight for dinner. We have come here often because it is convenient, however, it seems as if the quality has diminished.  We think they switched the type of mozzerella that they use, maybe we are wrong, but the flavor of the cheese isn't as good. Also, we ordered a pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The mushrooms were canned. I appreciated that they put extra sauce on the pizza as I asked, however, we ordered Rosati's crust (a thicker crust although not Chicago style) they gave us thin crust. Which we took in stride because it is healthier, if there is such a thing with pizza, but not what we ordered. Also, took the server a long time to bring our initial drinks. Although, she was pleasant and did check on us several times. We would have appreciated clean plates between salad and pizza, however, she didn't offer to bring us out any clean plates so that was a negative.  So ultimately I would only return here since it is convenient however, if I have time or motivation I would gladly drive farther for a higher quality product.

I must say that ultimately I teetered between giving this restaurant a 2 or a 3 star but between the diminished quality and somewhat lacking service I opted for the two. If it was just the pizza I might place it at a three.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,1,1,2,9KCrDJX97nh1nNxeXsp_qw

The food is always superb. We both are from The Chicago area, and there is nothing like Chicago style pizza. In our opinion of course. :-) So we were very happy when Rosati's came to the Northwest neighborhood years ago. Sometimes we have Sandwich night, sometimes Pizza night (especially during football season, we like to watch the Sunday night NFL football game with our pizza), sometimes Pasta. The common denominator: everything is from Rosati's. 
Our favorite dishes from each of the three categories are as follows. Sandwiches: The Italian beef for my husband (aka 'Big Al'), and the chicken sandwich for me. Pasta: baked Mostaciolli for Big Al, and Angel hair pasta with either Italian sausage or scrumptiously-spiced grilled chicken on the side, for me. Pizza: The large thin crust Fabulous Four for Al, and the Meat Lovers for me. In each case: thin crust and large. Sometimes, I like to go for the more exotic style pizza like having the pizza with spinach. It's all great. In all cases, we enjoy the large Caesar salad. I get to eat most of it; whereas Big Al  sticks with the croutons and some pieces of lettuce. Sometimes I'll get the chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert, while Big Al fancies a nice piece of cheesecake.

When visiting the store to pick up take-out pizzas, the employees are never all that friendly. The location sports a tiny seating area that I suppose could be seen as romantic or quaint, but when I've eaten there, I just thought it was dar, loud, and cold (the door kept opening for take-out guests).

On one occasion, they prepared a pizza with incorrect ingredients. They were very sorry about the error and gladly made a replacement, making appropriate amends (not stated here) for the time I had to wait. 

In addition to ordering pizza for take-out, I recently had a wonderful experience when having Rosatti's cater a dinner. For an astounding $169, we purchased the ""Rosatti's Budget Buster"" for 20-25 guests. It was so inexpensive that we ordered it even though we were only feeding 9 people. Purchasing each item individually, even in much smaller quantities, was going to be exorbitantly expensive. As a result, everyone took home leftovers to eat right away and more to freeze for later. It was the Christmas party that just kept giving! :-)

The service I received through catering was completely different than that experienced with my past pick-up orders. Alexia communicated kindly with me by phone and email several times and was eager to match my group's needs while making the experience easy. I really appreciated her dedication to her work and her desire to ensure my guests received the best experience possible.

--Each pizza box has a tab on the side worth one point. When you receive 12 points (12 pizza boxes), you can buy one pizza at half price. Eat-in customers... always be sure to take some home so you get the box.",7hlF-dR-m-e8nFZMWao8cQ,0,0,4,ZG4Yi2dhHmBy8E84P6tfyg

Breadsticks looked and tasted like they bought them from the grocery store and then put them in a freezer until ready. 
The restaurant itself was nice though. It looks like they have a pub/bar section that is separate from a family dining section. Great place to go eat dinner, I'll just have to try something different next time",srfR-pUMoMOIIK0zbqMrjQ,1,1,2,Jwrnaf3P13ky-wjmASGjQA

At Rosati's you will enjoy the salads, the wings are above average, and the pizza is heaven scent ................................ nay, life changing!!

I am sitting here looking at a calendar wondering when I can get back to Vegas so I can get another pizza.

Do yourself a favor and give the crispy thin crust a try, it is pizza perfection, I am not sure what it is but they put some seasoning or spices or something awesome on the pizza that gives it the best taste in the world.

Incident #2. Call to order delivery on a weekday. 1 hour later husband calls. ""Uhh.... I marked it as pick up"" *slaps forehead* YOU REPEATED THE ORDER KIDDO. Driver comes. Wow I cant believe this sat this long. Usually we throw it away by now"".. um you have my phone number... why wouldnt you just call?

Incident #3. Call to order pickup. Inform older man ""i would like the Rosati's family favorite, The Veggie"" he said, ""are you on the Rosati's or My Rosatis?"" I was looking at an online menu. But his tone was awkward. I said let me check (on my phone) I informed him of the address on the menu, which was this location, he said ""good job little girl, okay"". I scoffed. Okay I dont mind getting called a little girl. Im in my mid twenties and sound like I am 12. But it sounded smart as hell for 1 and for 2 if you knew it already, why were you wasting my time?

I said ""you know what sir, I dont appreciate your tone, please cancel the order"" I heard a rebuttle as I swiftly hung up the phone.


Come on guys. Teenagers I expect stuff. But at least teach them how to hold a good attitude with customers for the future. The adult I spoke to this evening, you should know better.

We called and the person I spoke with was kind and professional and said the pizza would be ready in 30 mins. We got a large with sausage and pepperoni and a order of Cajun fries.  It cost about $30 for all ( which was steep I thought to myself). As we picked up the pizza it was so heavy and hot fresh from the oven and the fries were packaged nicely. We got home and opened the box, this pizza was massive. I couldn't believe my eyes I thought to myself okay the price is worth it.

You can take it either to go or dine in. There's outdoor seating and indoor seating! There's also a bar by the same owner but you have to go next door to drink! 

Inside is really cute. The front has a board full of menu items where you can take things to go. The tables have the old fashioned red and white checkered table cloths which I think is really adorable. It's lovely that you're able to fill up your own soda but the servers do it for you anyway! I think that's very nice. This place is very clean as well.

I got the fried mushrooms to start it off. They were pretty good! I wish it came with something else besides marinara sauce though. Maybe ranch? I can see that working more. It's still a good portioning size though so you do get a lot! My boyfriend got the cheesy garlic bread was amazing as well. I loved it! Perfect amount of cheese on it. I got the ravioli with meat sauce. The meat sauce was pretty good, but a little chunkier than I'd prefer (and no it's not from the meat.) The actual ravioli's are so good though! They're big too so you have to cut each in half. The plate is so big. It comes in a bowl but the bowl is really deep. It's a bigger portion than I can handle, but I'm not going to complain when I can actually take some home! My man got the Chicken Parm. The chicken was perfect, sauce was really good, portion was huge as well, the thing was it was too cheesy... Now literally two reviews ago, I said that there was no such thing as cheese.. God proved me wrong. I love cheese but it was too much. He wasn't able to finish it because of how thick it made the plate. It was still delicious, don't get me wrong. But just too much cheese.

Tonight I walked in to pick up an order, and wasn't greeted. The young girls at the front counter were busy with their personal conversation. Told brunette that I was picking up and gave my name. She gave me my total, and as I held out my credit card, she blatantly ignored me. So there I am, arm stretched out, credit card in hand, waiting. She finally takes it, and I'm able to sign. She said it's going to be just a moment and that they're really backed up. Just as she's saying that, a male waiter throws a crumpled up receipt at her. It misses, comes over the counter, and lands at my feet. Unamused I continue to wait. I asked for an estimated time, and she says something about she can ask but isn't sure they can give her a time. 

So she goes in the back, doesn't ask any of the cooks about my food, but proceeds to talk about me with the male employee. ""Oh my god! Did you see her face?"" Mocking me.... that's definitely how business should be conducted. *note sarcasm* My food comes out moments later. She sets it on the counter and walks away... so is this my food?

The deep dish is heavy and satisfying, and yes the crust is good, even though personally I still love Giordano's in Chicago, IL.  I remember their crust being a little flakier, almost like a crispier, buttery flaky biscuit.  

Rosati's has pretty good crust, toppings and pizza sauce.  We like the Honey BBQ chicken wings, they are large wings and usually there is plenty of sauce. One time we did order it and it seemed there wasn't enough sauce and it wasn't as good, but 3 out of 4 times they were delicious. I especially liked their ranch sauce.",vh8v72MaEqUCsNwWsslibg,1,1,4,f1CB0oB2OY9lf8R8ogua7g

-Waited two hours for our pizza never to be delivered
-So... Finally my husband went in to pick one up, and he was accused of lying about not receiving the delivery from Eric
- Eric went on to call my husband whom wears glasses four eyes, he called him four eyes twice
- Eric delivered our pizza to another house who signed the receipt with a different surname
-Eric can't read because it was not our surname
-Eric got a tip from our credit card that we did not consent
-There was no management to deal with this situation, instead the whole employee staff ganged up on my husband accusing him of lying and making our family feel very exposed and unsafe with credit card information and our address at  the hand of strangers and thieves

Sadly we gave Rosati's a lot business for 2 years, but I guess they don't mind losing it:)

I'm updating my review an hour later.... The food poisoned us! Yep, throw up

And, within an hour (3 hours after originally ordering it) we were throwing up.... Wonder what they did to it

I'm updating a week later... So, the owner of Rosati's never contacted us to apologize or refund us. I spoke with the headquarters who can only do so much, as this is a franchise, they reassured us we would be safe by deleting our information from the Rosati's computer, banning us... Lol. 

... They were putting too much cheese on their pizzas anyways.... Trying to mask the bad everything else

I'd advise anyone reading this, Streets of New York is better pizza anyways!!!",Ru9TWQ72xskwS_yxGDROow,17,2,1,F_3NEstThrPdm7WT7NYw6Q

Came here the other day to watch a World Cup game with some friends and I really dug this cozy little Chicago-style pizza joint. When I had walked in the place was jam packed and I headed to the bar area to meet some friends. Several large flat screens could be seen adorning the bar and several smaller ones hung in plain view of the bar tables against the far wall. Music-wise I noticed they had a Touch-Tunes system and it was playing at a moderate level. The bar was also equipped with the usual gambling machines. The bartender was extraordinarily slammed with the amount of tables she was having to take care of, so when she was finally able to take my order I made sure I was ready. I also asked her if she could put the sound of the soccer match on and she complied.

I had myself a couple $2.95 Miller Lites and saw they also had Amber Alaskan Ale on tap for $3.95. I splurged and ordered the Alaskan the rest of my time at the bar. The draft beers are all served inside a frozen mug, which to my understanding makes it a tad more difficult to taste the beer, but it was over 100 degrees and humid that day so I was all over those frozen mugs!

Our group ordered some food items at halftime which included a side of fries, HOT chicken tenders with ranch, mild wings, side garden salad, and a large deep-dish Chicago styled pizza with the works for toppings. The fries were crinkle-cut and at the bar they had your choice of regular ketchup or 'ketchupeño' which was simply a little spicier version of ketchup that had an enjoyable hint of jalapeño flavor. The HOT chicken tenders were exactly that, HOT! These little babies were smoking! The ranch dressing helped bate the heat slightly, but I was very surprised by the heat despite the warning from our bartender. Many times when I try something this hot I am not a big fan of the flavor, but these tenders were deliciously spicy. The pizza was tasty, big, doughy, and met all my expectations of what a good Chicago style pizza should be.

All in all, our visit was an enjoyable experience! I felt bad for the bartender as the place was clearly understaffed, but she had mentioned that an employee had called out sick that day. If she wasn't such a rock-star at her job, our experience would have went south real fast. Hats off to great customer service!",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,4,3,4,8vZbHUrBoY9toMVwhNSNhA

If you are anyone that values good customer service and great pizza i would highly recommend staying away from this place.

Time after time again picking up uber orders from this place im continuously  disrespected by the owner and his employees.

Tonight i walked in to pick up another uber order,  upon walking in i see the older man that runs the place and owns this particular rosatis which is the worst one in town by far. 
Instead of reaching out to me to fix the issues he absolutely just made them worse. 
Im telling you right now this is one of those establishments where you will be treated very very poorly if your part of the LGBTQ community.

Upon walking in he says nada. Two girls standing on each side of him giving me the most sarcastic shitty welcome because hes standing there and as the they do so hes sitting there histarically laughing.  Hmmm i wonder whats so funny. Maybe the fact that everyones adults there but cant seem to approach me like a normal business owner and fix his out of control business. Clearly im not the only one who thinks so every single one of his one star reviews on here all HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. 

I would AVOID this place at all cost dont waste  your money. Just go to metro or streets of new york,  hell youd be better off going to presto calzone or papa murphys for take out. 

The only people who hang out here are the regular alcoholics and people who do the same old shit theyve been doing for years. Stay away from this place.

We have ordered several times (more than two dozen) and have ordered a variety of menu items, to include single entrees and the family sizes spaghetti, lasagna, and salads. We have also had the beef sandwiches, mozzarella sticks, french fries, breadsticks, and of course, pizza - both regular and Chicago style pan.  

So, here's the catch...service is always great but the preparation of the food has never been consistent. We have had wonderful items such as the juicy, hearty, beefy, melty provolone cheese, in a golden toasted bun with savory, nicely seasoned au jus Italian beef.   But the next time we ordered it, the portion size noticeably shrank...is that a word?  Now, I know that is not about the food itself, but it was disappointing even so.

We have also had spaghetti that was too far beyond al dente and was just plain mushy. Sooo disappointing. Italian restaurants are judged on their pasta preparation because what else is there??  Then another time we ordered pasta, it was fine. I would estimate 50/50.  

The meat sauce and the marinara are both fine. I prefer marinara and theirs was nicely tomatoey and not too sweet. Just enough seasoning to enhance the plump, chunky sauce natural flavors. 

My husband prefers meat sauce, which he did like, but their meatballs, which are huge, were somewhat bland for his taste.  

The lasagna was just average (kinda too much sauce and could have more layers) as well as their breadsticks and salad-pretty mundane items. 

If I was going to recommend something from here, it would be their specialty Chicago-style deep dish pizza. It is thick, cheesy, hearty, saucy, with whatever toppings you want to have shoved in.  We ordered a medium for 4 adults and had a half pie leftover. Even my husband, whose appetite is legendary, could only manage one and a half slices (or chunks as they should be called).  It was yummy.

Overall, we will continue to roll the dice with this restaurant because it is close and does deliver fairly quickly. It would not be my first choice Italian restaurant because of the iffy pasta prep, but on a good day, it's not bad.",izWbFJZWlagRHrFjqX2DIg,0,0,3,Y-0NeHmt6gkmLMVivliScQ

We ordered a large deep dish cheese pizza. The price was a bit high - about $20 (including delivery), but I've read a lot about their deep dish, so we had to get that. They said it would take 45 minutes to get the pizza. It took about 35 which was great. I can't say there have been many times when I've gotten a pizza delivered early! The pizza was massive, and just one and a half pieces each satisfied 4 adults (plus some side items). The crust was thick on the bottom and crunchy and a bit buttery on the side. The cheese was perfect, and the amount of sauce was really good. Overall, the pizza was one of the better deep dish pizza's I've had in Vegas, and I dig the crust much more than the stuffed pizza at Metro's (my other favorite ""deep dish"").

I've lived in Las Vegas for 10 years, and haven't had Rosati's till this weekend.

My parents are headed back to Chicago for Christmas, so we decided to do our Christmas together this weekend, and instead of a traditional dinner, we opted to order Rosati's.

Oh.  My.  God.

I cried after my first bite.  I've missed pizza this good for ten years.

I've had decent pizza, but nothing compares to this.  The pizza was just like back home!

I really wish I lived closer to this location, but I'm going to see if there is a Rosati's close to my house so I can have it more often.
