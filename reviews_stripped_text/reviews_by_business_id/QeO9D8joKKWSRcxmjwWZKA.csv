1034686,2015-09-06,1,QeO9D8joKKWSRcxmjwWZKA,Have been here a few times and always clean. Have not had an issue with customer service but it can get busy. Don't think I have waited more than 10 minutes from line to drink in hand... Maybe I'm just lucky,ltUb21ZilinnvIjGbO9FAQ,0,0,4,kygf8CcP2h2pjiz4f60d_g
1200211,2018-01-01,0,QeO9D8joKKWSRcxmjwWZKA,"Not enough help here there were 2 people and a long line. I ordered a tall mocha frappe light, pretty basic. After waiting 10-15 min. I asked and was told your drink is there and she picked up a frappe with whip cream and some sort of sauce. I told her no that's not what I ordered. She asked the barista to make a new one, I watched as he stared a different order. I figured after a long wait I should cut my losses and I asked for a refund. Another 10 minute wait for the manager!! The manager refunded my money and asked if there's anything else I want to order. No way!!  Some of these franchises really miss the service mark, not up to the Starbucks standard for a $7 drunk.",8p54CGzqZ84gbrM3Qd77Jg,0,0,1,WbibwYKsi44wx0EJTueyEw

2404535,2017-07-03,0,QeO9D8joKKWSRcxmjwWZKA,"They are a lot more expensive then other Starbucks, $8 for a frap, typical for a franchise on the strip and anything we tried to order, they were out of. Wasn't worth it. We should've  just went to the bar and got a cocktail. Barista was nice at least. I can't say anything bad about the customer service.",uT88e0NuTpxcqcv3cAyUKA,0,0,2,mh-IEP70BBswhpoYkgttcA
2731969,2017-02-25,0,QeO9D8joKKWSRcxmjwWZKA,"I was excited that this Starbucks was conveniently located inside Tropicana, which was the hotel I was staying at.
As soon as I come down, there are 2 people ahead of me in line. 

Wow!  Worst service ever!  1 working as the cashier and the other is the barista. 

This didn't happen to me, but the person in front of me ordered a drink and asked for whip and cinnamon on top. The barista said, ""it doesn't come with cinnamon or whip, that's not how you drink it"".  The customer understands that it didn't, but that's just how she wanted it and she was okay paying extra for it.  The Barista then slaps the cinnamon on the counter and tells the customer to do it herself. I was speechless and the fact that customer was so chill and polite the whole time was more surprising.  I would've flipped out. 
 
I understand any job can be stressful, but leave it at home, don't bring it to work.  She took forever to make 1 drink.

Brighter note:  My drink (Caramel Macchiado) was perfect!",s8EFIOWZo5kjmVbbNmblkg,0,0,2,R86ZTyE5mAI4iiN6GPTJBw
3227351,2016-11-13,1,QeO9D8joKKWSRcxmjwWZKA,"This is the worst Starbucks ever!!! I've been to ones that are not corporate, but this one takes the cake. 

I ordered oatmeal. It only comes with 1 topping they say. You don't even get brown sugar or stevia to sweeten with. Everything is $1.00 extra. You want a banana... that's $3.50. In the end, a normal oat meal will cost you $10.00 for something that would be $4.00. 

The baristas were chatty and rude. Tropicana really needs to reevaluate this Starbucks.",Yj72KhV_ryLFIMnJQExvaw,0,0,1,tamdIm4HcurgxrCdys2Mrw
3489248,2016-08-04,0,QeO9D8joKKWSRcxmjwWZKA,Literally just bought a coffee. The woman who rang me up was so incredibly rude. Because of her long fingernails she literally told me she did not want to reload my card. I wonder how Starbucks would feel about that? There are so many Starbucks in Las Vegas... Do not waste your money at this one!,bq1e9N4GuuTTH-6duQ4yWg,0,0,1,-8AI5_BAImSKHwxL4kc4DA
4373965,2016-11-10,0,QeO9D8joKKWSRcxmjwWZKA,"Starbucks seems to be getting more expensive every time I go and this location was no exception. $6.98 for a grande white mocha is testing my price limit for leaving empty handed. The line was fairly long and the staff weren't very friendly. They wanted nothing to do with my rewards card which was a bummer because of how much it was for one cup of joe. I am beginning to think you just can't get a decent cup of coffee anywhere on the strip without paying dearly for it. Convenience has it's cost, unfortunately and I don't plan on returning to this location on my next visit.",4qXTMirb3noPUosWj_Pfvw,0,1,2,o9Z8YNnJu4TVukIG49yQFQ

Came here for a late night drink because I was parched.

The service was fast and friendly and the decor was clean and trendy.

Although the prices may be higher than at other locations, it's still cheaper than purchasing drinks at other stores in the nearby casinos.",wQPFiiRVnNlueYcfW_PE7w,2,1,4,pCXfreaYIkdbIkWp_lTFEQ

It took five minutes to wait on each customer I waited 20 minutes with only three people ahead of me. the idiot clerk got my order wrong and screwed up the order for  the lady in front of me. No concept of customer service.  don't go here unless you have plenty of time to kill and lots of patience,lEhWGwaNiC2dKtWwFJRAcg,0,0,1,_mqnI6C1HFSVwj0ErhYw9g
