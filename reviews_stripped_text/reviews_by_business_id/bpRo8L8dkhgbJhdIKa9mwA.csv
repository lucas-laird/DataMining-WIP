Now on to the food...

Only one person ordered a salad (I forgot which one) but loved it!  I had the Lobster Cocktail which had just the right amount of kick from the horseradish and vodka.  For side dished we ordered Sweet Pudding Corn, Parmesan Truffle Fries, Mac & Cheese, and Spiced Maple Carrots.  All of which were simply amazing.  For steaks we had 4 bone in Filets (Best steak I've had in years), 2 bone-in Rib Steaks, and 1 Filet Medallion.  They were all cooked to the perfect temp, seasoned perfectly, and served piping hot.  

For dessert they had an off the menu item which we tries which has a homemade mint chocolate chip sandwich served with homemade whipped cream and chocolate sauce for dipping.  The homemade mint ice cream was the star of the show.  I've never had ice cream before with such a great flavor of mint!  We also ordered the STK Cones which were good but nothing like the ice cream sandwich.

It's not cheap ($750 with tax and tip and we only had about 6 beers total) but worth it!",R-azaxl8FHIbF4sR8CvXSQ,2,2,5,3K-1WL2JeHnpEN856ziaSg

    The steak was exactly what I expected, delicious but not especially noteworthy.  As was the wedge salad.  The standouts were the bread and the lobster mac & cheese.  The bread looked like balls of dough had been stuck together in a dish and baked, and then had blue cheese butter drizzled over.  I don't even like blue cheese and I LOVED this.  There was also a chive oil dipping sauce.  The lobster mac & cheese needs no explanation, apart from that it was phenomenal.

I have eaten at the STK each trip to Vegas the last five trips. I was more than a little concerned this trip. The food was very good but I ordered my steak peppercorn crusted and after a couple of bites realized it wasn't. The waiter asked what I wanted to do about it. He said he could put it back on the broiler.  After I had eaten on it?  Lo and behold that is exactly what happened. The same steak came back with a mild apology.  At the end of the meal, I was surprised to not have the bill adjusted in any way or to even be offered a comp of dessert. Not sure I will return when I return next month to Vegas.

Not sure if the food is any good since my party of eight left before we even looked at the menu.  We had a 6:00 PM reservation for a business dinner on a Monday during a major conference.  The greeters at the host stand were the first indication that we were not going to have a good dining experience.  They were very generally curt and insisted our entire party was present before seating us even for drinks.  At just after 6PM seven of us were seated at a table that would have held six people comfortably, seven acceptably, but not enough room for eight yielding steak knives and talking business.

We asked the hostess to be re-seated at a table that could accommodate us once the eighth arrived.  She said the manager wouldn't allow us to be re-seated. We told her we would leave if she couldn't find a bigger table.  She seemed disinterested so we left, passing through a mostly empty dining room.

98225,2012-12-11,2,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"The atmosphere/decor was great. It had a very modern with a touch of sophistication feel. 

I'm giving this restaurant a 1 star because I got food poisoning, which was a real shame because the sides were excellent. 

My two friends and I started with freshly baked bread in a mini cast iron pot, covered in bleu cheese butter with a chive-olive oil sauce. Amazing! 

We skipped the appetizer because we didn't want to fill up before our steaks came. 

I ordered a 10 oz filet, medium-rare with foie gras on top. The filet was pretty tough and it was hard to cut into. It which I found odd for a filet, but it was cooked correctly (med-rare). The foie gras was OK - only 'OK' because I was expecting a nice buttery, melt in your mouth kind of texture; and frankly, this wasn't it. 

As for sides: \
- the creamy mash potatoes were standard.
- the Brussels sprouts were fabulous. It had small chunks of bacon which gave it a step in front of the game. 

Too bad it didn't all get digested. The next morning, I woke up puking everything back up, as well as it was coming out the behind from diarrhea. The only thing I can think of was food poisoning from either the steak or foie gras because I shared everything else with my two friends and they were just fine. It was a miserable 36 hours, which included going  to the bathroom every 30 min. in the first 24 hours. AND I had to fly back home to San Jose, Ca in between bathroom breaks. 

I'm sorry if I was too harsh on this. But the fact that I got soo sick  tells me the standards for this restaurant (located in the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas) was not prestige nor up to par.

first, came the bread. i thought the complimentary loaf of parmesan glazed bread was pretty good. i liked the pesto olive oil dipping sauce it came with. good starter i suppose.   

3-stars for the ribeye. While the first couple of bites were juicy and delicious, the steak got dry over time and the salt was a bit overbearing. I'm guessing they served the steak to me without adequate rest and oversalted the meat a bit.

5-stars for the mac n cheese and yukon gold potato puree side dishes. i thoroughly enjoyed these side dishes. of all the steak places i've eaten, it is nearly on par with Craftsteak's side dishes.

172741,2012-08-21,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Cliff's Notes version: The worst service we have ever had in our lives. Some of the best meat we've ever had in our lives. Calculate the risk in going here.

Just as other reviewers said, cool vibe (DJ = good but loud), had to wait 30 mins after our reservation at 10:15 to get seated and came within moments of losing our table service at the club we were going to after. We, unlike other reviewers, were given no special treatment. We, too, were a bachelorette party.

In fact, we had the oddest, worst service any of us have ever had. There were 10 of us, all living/ having lived in the 3 major cities (NYC, Chicago, and LA) and it was literally the worst any of us have had, to the extent where several people wondered if our waiter was high on something. He was rude to the point of disbelief. At first we thought he was being snarky/funny, then we thought perhaps it was a shtick like at Ed Debevic's, but no, we realized as the night went on, it was just horrible.

I want to be crystal clear - we were not your typical bachelorette party. We were a more mature group, and there were no boas/ genitalia accessories/ strippers whatsoever. Just looking to enjoy a good meal before going out for the evening. We all ordered quickly and did not ask for substitutions. Sincerely, we were an easy group. 

I also want to be clear that all of us are by no means strangers to having to wait to be seated/ put up with service issues in the ""hot spot"" du jour. 

Among the complaints/ comments he made to us were:
- I GUESS I can go ahead and bring you a drink menu (after a friend asked for one, and he suggested a signature cocktail and she said it sounded a little sweet for her) - as if he shouldn't have brought one to begin with just in general, much less at 10:15 on a Saturday and to a group of 10 people who were also celebrating a bachelorette
- Do you even know what you just ordered? (when a friend ordered a glass of wine)
- Nobody's ordering ANYTHING (when a friend ordered a salad first, and he asked whether he should bring it out first, and she asked whether others were getting starters)
- Other outwardly aggressive stuff, like when two friends said they were splitting one of the larger steaks

He also pushed doing bottle service immediately without even asking if we were interested, and kept trying to push us to order more. Again, we all had tabs of about $60+, on which he automatically got 20%. Sorry that we don't want to each get 20 oz. filets before heading out for the night in tight Las Vegas club apparel??? Looking back, perhaps the guaranteed gratuity meant there was no incentive for good service.

The food was delicious. We had several veggies, all fresh but nothing spectacular; the macaroni which is highly touted and good, but again not the best I've had; steaks which even the most elite foodies in our group said were the best they've had, and the waygu sliders which were mind-blowing. No one got the signature cocktails, as they were all coated in candy and $18 apiece, which is absurd for a non-artisinal bar cocktail. I've had drinks at Grant Achatz's Aviary for less than that.

We left without complaining as we had to physically rush to make sure the rest of our night's plans weren't messed up.

Would go back as the food definitely warranted a second shot, but I'd be weary.",yR_5CpxE1LGffabc9rNyJQ,4,0,3,6xmAdNRArUIJ8ZDL910Y8g

The last few dining experiences in Vegas were terrible so I was a bit hesitant to bring in such a large group not knowing what to expect.  They seated us in the private dining room.  Everything was excellent.  There were nine ladies and the only complaint was that one of the steaks was overcooked.  Everything else excellent.  Service was great too.  Rob kept our drinks flowing and really stayed on top of the table.  It was defiantly a dining experience I will never forget;) we will defiantly be back the next time we are in Vegas.

298142,2016-05-13,2,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"On the evening of May 5, 2016, I visited STK for the 3rd straight year in the month of May as I travel to Las Vegas for the Interop Trade Show. 

As usual, the ambiance was on point, music had the mood set perfectly, it was Cinco de Mayo (which typically I do not celebrate) but what can I say? It was a great day - until my food arrived.

I ordered a Filet Mignon prepared Medium Cajun Style (which adds Cajun Rub on top). Medium is a Pink Warm Center. When the food arrived, I added some sides to it, Confit Potatoes our waitress recommended and asparagus. I tasted the sides on my plate. They were really good. I cut into the Filet. It unfortunately was prepared Medium Well Plus. The waitress understood and replaced the overcooked steak with a Medium prepared Filet Mignon about 6 minutes after I reported the issue. 

The replacement Filet Mignon arrived perfectly prepared on an empty plate. Gone were the sides I had on the plate. I proceeded to eat the remainder sides left from the table that were somewhat on the chilly side as they had been sitting. I enjoyed the steak and my somewhat chilly sides and kept it moving.

It was a total of 5 Men in our party. 2 White, 1 Mexican, 1 Asian, and I am Black. A diverse crowd - in a good mood because we were scheduled to go to Spearmint Rhino afterwards (Holla!)

Anyhow, we ordered dessert after eating. We ordered the doughnuts with candied walnuts and caramel sauce. It tasted like a gourmet crispy cr√®me without the frosting. It was one of the best desserts I had eaten.

So why the Meh review? Here's why.

1) I had sides on my plate prior to cutting into my overcooked Filet. Those sides never made it back to my plate with the freshly prepared replacement Filet.

2) The dessert, when presented to us, did not have new silverware. We all received eating dishes and ended up using the same silverware we used for our meals. The dessert was served with no silverware to serve. It also was presented with thick whipped cream that if you turned upside down, did not fall out of its dish. With contaminated silverware from our meals, we could not dip into the whipped cream. We also dug into the doughnuts cautiously since our silverware was not new. We dealt with it. 

3) The next table over with 5 couples (10 people) ordered 2 of the same dessert we had. They all received eating dishes and spoons. I thought to myself, here we go.

4) I raised awareness to our server regarding my sides being eliminated from my overcooked Filet plate and the lack of silverware for the dessert. 

4a) the waitress indicated that due to food code, food cannot be transferred. I thought great! So why not transfer my sides to a dish at the table until their overcooked food is replaced? She then added, I should have brought out more sides. I thought to myself, Yeah! You Should Have! 

4b) the waitress argued with me that the table that received the desserts did not have serving silverware with the doughnuts. I pointed out okay but each person had new silverware (spoons) to use. After which, I stood up and pointed at the table and their new silverware. It took me to do this for her to agree with me.

The waitress did not deduct ANYTHING off of the $570 bill we accumulated. She indicated that she would educate the servers that brought out the dessert and educate the crew that cleared the entr√©e meals.

Wow.. And sarcastically, Good Job. 

I'll go somewhere else to dine next time. Our client expensed the full bill. I paid $0 and I was dissatisfied. That tells you the service was less than sub-par.

Recommend: Seafood Platter Appetizer. Jumbo Shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail. Really good. Also, Filet steak(med/rare) with foie gras. 

Stay away from: Lobster Mac-n-cheese. Taste like plain mac-cheese with frozen pieces of lobster mixed in there. Good, but not worth the $30 price tag.

I understand Vegas is different. But after being sat, I just couldn't stop looking around asking myself... ""Are they playing a joke on us?""  

THE MUSIC IS UNBEARABLY LOUD!  We thought it might just be at the front, or the bar area. Nope!  We were sat towards the back and I just couldn't believe it. Again, I get it... It's Vegas, they want the young ""see and be seen"" attitude, but when I can't hear my gf who is inches away, or our server for that matter (until he started yelling to us which was awkward).  I didn't bother asking why the music was so loud, I'm sure they get that often. 

The food was good. Had 3 appetizers and we each ordered a steak. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, or had in Las Vegas but it was good. Steak grade maybe a 6 out of 10.  

Our table was kind of awkward as well. It was only the 2 of us so you almost have to share a curvy booth with strangers. The table next to us seemed annoyed as well. Maybe this is why the music is so loud, so we don't listen to one another's convo?  Maybe it's so that we eat and go... Thus, they can turn more tables?  

Afraid to say, this is a ""NO GO BACKER"" for me. The food... Maybe but the music being so loud I don't ever want to stand while trying to enjoy a nice meal.

I will get to the point, here is what we had.  To start out, we had the truffle butter fries, which was excellent, the texture and taste was memorable.  Next we had the foie gras french toast with slices of apples, which too was excellent, all the flavors together made it a memorable experience.  Now for the main course, I had a bone in rib eye with truffle butter and foie gras on top of the steak.  I got it medium, I usually do medium rare, but I decided medium that night.  The quality of the steak wasn't what I expected.  I was definitely expecting more from at top notch steak house.  The steak tasted dry and was overcooked.  Adding the foie gras and truffle butter really enhanced the flavor, but couldn't help a dry piece of meat.  My other buddies got theirs medium rare and they said the steak was a little dry, not as dry as mine, but dry.  Service was ok, took a long time to get the food out, the Maitre de was rude and shouldn't judge people by how they're dressed.

449110,2011-01-19,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Ah STK the place to be seen and to mingle. As soon as you walk into this restaurant you notice all the beautiful people, loud music, and dim atmosphere. The hostess sits you in round booths that are so close to your neighbor by the end of the night you might have new friends. You order a round of their signature cocktails and soak in the glitz and the glam. But is it worth all the hype and the $$$? 

Service - Our waitress was awesome. She was very detailed when going over the menu (maybe a little too much) and was more than obliged to offer her recommendations. She was on top of her game and provided excellent service to our table. I was a little intimidated by the bussers as they were like vultures as soon as you finished a dish. They also swooped in to fold the napkin on the table everytime my date got up from the table. Side note: Just make sure to say you ordered sparkling water so they don't pour regular tap water when they see your glass almost empty. Tap & Sparkling do not mix well.

Food - Within minutes of being sat down, you are greeted with a complimentary Parmesan Garlic Roll and it's dipping oil, which I can't remember what it was off the top of my head. The roll wasn't bad. 

We order our cocktails and appetizers - Tuna Tartare & Foie Gras French Toast. Phenomenal! Both were so refreshing and hit that palate perfectly. The Tuna Tartare was fresh with diced jalapenos, onions and lime in a taco shell with a avocado puree and chili oil. The Foie Gras French Toast was balanced excellently. The toast in a sherry reduction and the foie gras perfectly cooked, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a poached apple made happy time in my mouth! I highly recommend these two apps. 

We then ordered a medium rare bone-in fillet with a side of Parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and steamed Alaskan crab legs. The fries were not like the usual shoestring fries you find around town, they were more like steak potato blocks, not bad if I say so myself. The mushroom pot pie is good for mushroom fiends. They bring it out as a pot pie and cut the top off and dump the filling on a plate for you. The Alaskan crab legs were nicely plump and sweet, oh how I miss the Northwest! 

Now for the main entree- for being a steakhouse I was disappointed that their steak did not live up to the hype. It was cooked perfectly but had no flavor! A little salt & pepper would have made it one of the top steaks in town. Maybe the reason it's so bland is because they do give you an option to add a topping or sauce to your steak. However, I'm a purist and great steak doesn't need anything fancy on it if seasoned right. The waitress brought us their steak sauces to try and honestly I wasn't impressed by them. The flavor was so bland. The mushroom & peppercorn sauce was probably the better of the 4 but it still lacked flavor. Word of advice don't order the mac & cheese, no flavor whatsoever. I couldn't tell you if it was suppose to be a truffle mac & cheese or just a white mac & cheese (Best Mac & Cheese: StripSteak's truffle mac & cheese). 

Wait still not done! We had to top off the night with dessert to have the whole STK experience. We ordered a molten chocolate cake and the famous bread pudding. If you have a sweet tooth, these two desserts will rock your world. I did like the bread pudding but it was a little too sweet for me as it was drenched in the caramel syrup. The Captain Crunch addition to the bread pudding was quite interesting. 

When all was said and done, we got are bill and walked away stuffed. We easily spent over $200 for the 2 of us but we also wanted to have the full STK experience. Overall, a cool place to be if you don't mind the loudness, dark lighting and have a couple hours to kill...our dinner lasted over 2 hours. 

Side notes:  The timing between apps and entrees seemed so spread out. I feel like we waited 15-20 for our entree to come out, could be a bad thing if you're starving. The steak was a disappointment but willing to try it again or try something else. Be prepared to wait in line to use the restroom as there is only one stall per gender.

467108,2014-10-26,5,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Listen, people: maybe it was waiting until 11:15 PM to be seated, maybe it was the ear-splitting music which forced us to use our other senses, maybe it was purely hunger delirium -- but it was the best steak and sides we've ever had.

None of that means anything. It's such a low number of stars to give for such a great meal, expertly served. It means that everything else that STK allowed to happen that night negated any strong points they earned.

While waiting for a table, we were witness to such a mind-blowingly disgusting display that it prompted a very serious discussion of our group giving up our reservation altogether, going to In-N-Out Burger (no pun intended), and calling it a night.

At the table next to us was a man who had obviously called an escort service, had them send a couple of ""workers"" to meet him at STK, and the three of them gave us a floor show of french kissing, gyrating, miming fellatio and cunnilingus, and general dry-humping, that it's a miracle we could keep our steaks down. Management came over (without us even saying anything -- obviously others were bothered, too) and had terse words with the man, which culled the trio's amorous activities -- temporarily, It was only a matter of minutes until they resumed their table-side  menage-a-trois. When they finally left (like the slow fade of a Viagra commercial), our party came to a realization: we were actually *surrounded* by other couples who were very obviously the products of a ""business transaction"" as opposed to.....actual dates. Gorgeous African-American young beauty in skin-tight scuba dress un-zippered to the navel seated with nebbish nerd, to cite an example.

You bet we're in Vegas. Anything goes. And we're fully up for that. But when the conduct of certain patrons supersedes the comfort of others ponying up significant sums for their Wagyu beef, or the management at STK does not see the slippery slope of cheerfully opening their doors as a clubhouse for the sex trade, they might as well change the theme to Thai Ping-Pong Bar and be done with it. (or -- as it was suggested by some in the party -- change the name to ""STD""?)  Hepatitis (or worse?)  on the forks is a legitimate but secondary concern:  how about the group of us simply wanting to enjoy a glorious steak at midnight served by a wait staff who really knows their stuff without having to be witness to a Hustler Letter to the Editor in the making?

497844,2011-05-23,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"STK is a very cool restaurant. After being seated, I got the feeling the owners started off building a nightclub, then switched their mind and morphed it into a steakhouse. One word: silverware. You'll be amazed by how cool it is! The staff on hand was excellent; beautiful people, most of which could also carry a highminded conversation. 

The food: The monkey bread is from another planet, where they specialize in making really, really good bread.. You'll want to eat two or three of those. I didn't ask for more, it was one of my regrets upon leaving!
I order a small filet, scallops and broclini as a side. I requested the filet be cooked to medium rare (as most steaks should be!). The filet was pink and red throughout the steak...not cool. The chef forgot about the order of scallops. They appeared 10 minutes after chomping down on the steak. I only ate one of the two. 

The drinks: Wow, Grey Goose Martini with Blue Cheese filled Olives? Try it, you will be amazed.

Perhaps I visited on an off night? Since the Cosmopolitan is newly up and running, I understand that STK is not at peak performance yet. For the price I paid, I can say that I expected more. Though I would give STK another opportunity, but only after they've gotten all the kinks out.

My buddies and I came here because I had $500 dining credits (you know, being the big casino donators we are), and was left feeling less than satisfied on many fronts.  First, the place was loud and dark, and frankly, pretentious.  Secondly, the food took quite some time to come out and when it did, let's just say I've had better Rib Eye at most other steak houses I've been to.  Really nothing much to rave about here.
What really got me upset was the service and how they screwed that up royally.  Since the meal was covered with casino dining credits, I tipped out of my own pocket.  $100 for a $500 meal seems reasonable.. until I realized I was charged $200.  When I called the STK to correct this and provided my receipt as proof, apparently I was told this error in credit card billing has happened before and they can't do much about it.  After a few days of dealing with the manager who's quite hard to get a hold of, I finally just said screw it and left it with my credit card to deal with.

I was afraid it would be a little too trendy, maybe some ""you're not cool enough to eat here"" attitude.  But the food was fantastic, the service couldn't be better, and not even a hint of 'tude.

Even the bread basket was a treat.  I normally don't like to fill up on bread before the meal, even if it's really good bread.  They brought out just the right amount - enough to take the edge off your hunger pangs without filling you up.  Their take on the bread basket was brioche with blue cheese butter melted on top, served with chive olive oil.  The blue cheese butter was subtle and mild, and the chive olive oil was just delicious.  For an appetizer, we both got the foie gras waffle - seared foie, huckleberries, herb butter & a waffle.  It's a creative combination that turned out to be amazingly delicious.  I get seared foie gras almost anywhere it's served, and this version might be the yummiest I've ever had.

The steak was first rate.  We got the porterhouse and flank steaks, both with foie gras butter.  Both cuts were done just right, and the foie gras butter made for a sinfully rich complement.  I got the asparagus for a side.  What I like about STK is they put a twist on all the steakhouse classics, without being pretentious about it.  Instead of the usual straight hollandaise, they make an orange-japaleno version, and it worked!  For dessert I had the frozen zabaglione, which was basically a semi-frozen eggnog since you couldn't taste any marsala wine (which I don't like anyway, so good).  From bread to dessert, everything at STK was superb.

We managed to finish out meal before the DJ started, so I can't comment on the volume level.  What made our meal a five-star experience was the service.  Our server couldn't have been nicer and more helpful.  When I dropped a knife that made a CLANG! so loud it sounded like it was mic'd up, another server scooped it up a second later.  When I apologized for my very noisy clumsiness, she laughed it off and said don't even think about it.  None of the 'tude I was nervous about, none at all.  Just creative, first-rate food and friendly, professional service.  Also, while STK isn't cheap, it's actually a bit less expensive than most of the top steakhouses on the Strip.

To top it all off we were charged a $50 corkage fee. I know that this is the strip, but that is $20 -$30 higher then other comparable strip restaurants.

Been coming here for years. Loved it when I was pre-Celiac. It's a little more challenging now. 

Won't get into all the details, everyone else has.

Menu:
No gluten free menu.

Few options to ""make"" gluten free.

Some servers are cool about making vegetables without sauces, steaks without sauces, but if you don't get the right server, you'll end up with my meal as the boyfriend said looked like it was from Long John Silvers. (Plain tough fish, with potato chucks. No ranch to dip)

Now that I took all the fun out of eating, this place wasn't as awesome as it used to be. It still is for the non-celiac though.

It's a fun, cool vibe if you are having dinner or drinks with friends. The music is always on point, but extremely loud, so if you're looking for an intimate quiet date night, this probably wouldn't be the place for you. The first time I went here, the food was good and a gf and I shared the medium sized ribeye which was cooked perfectly from what I can remember. The whole group of 6 girls shared about 3 or 4 different sides which were more than enough. 
The second time I went here though, the experience was not at all the same. Since we came with guys this time, I was going to share the cowboy ribeye which is on the larger side. The waitress told us it would be a bit of a wait of about 30-45 mins since the cut was thicker, but said she would tell them to rush the order so the food would come out the same time as the rest of our group. We told her we didn't mind waiting, and we understood it may take longer. The food arrived....all at the same time. Now that wouldn't be a problem normally, but when I got my steak which I ordered to be cooked medium, the inside was ok, but the outside was COMPLETELY burnt, like I mean, charcoal burnt! When we ate it, I couldn't even taste the flavor of the steak, all I could taste was charcoal...bleh! Even my friend who likes burnt food, actually couldn't take it anymore. We realized after, that they were about an hour from closing time and were rushing to get the orders out. An hour to closing when I got my food, not when I put my order in btw. I mean, if I'm going to pay $85 for the steak alone, please take your time and cook it correctly! That left a bad taste in my mouth (literally) so I probably won't be making a trip back. I did leave 3 stars since my first experience wasn't as horrible, our server was super friendly this time, and the creamed corn was REALLY good!

Like many of the reviews on here, I was hoping for awesome and I got moments of cool with whole smattering of  average. I have eaten at 90% of the steakhouses here in town and I have a pretty good feel for what is hip and cool. 

Ambiance-
The music is WAY to frackin loud. It's bad form to have to yell at my wife who is 3 feet away from me during dinner.  I have 6000 watt home theater with 4 18 inch subs so I'm not in the ""If it's too loud your too old club"".  

But for an upscale steakhouse in an amazing casino it's just amateurish. I get concepts and this one just sucks. 

Nor is this the place to bring clients to discuss business. It is however a good place to bring inlaws because you won't be able to hear them.

Annoyance factor minus 2 stars

Food-
We asked for a heavy peppercorn rub on our steaks so much so that the steaks would be ""ruined"" with pepper. They brought our steaks cooked perfectly to temp and with a thick coating of peppercorns.  PERFECT! I had the STK Bold Sauce and my wifey had the creamy horseradish. My sauce was good if not a bit too sweet and the horseradish cream sauce was blah. 

We had the truffle fries (LOVED), Asparagus (good as it can be) and mac and cheese(Eh, cheesier and more crunch please)

If I had to find fault It would be that food came out a bit too quick. It was about 5 or so minutes after the apps were completed. 

Overall N9ne, Botero and Brand have a better product. 

Minus .5 stars


Staff- 
The FoH girls were cute, dressed well and very friendly.  No complaints here. 
Bar staff was interesting- My bartender told me her signature drink was a cucumber and basil martini. She said was it amazing and I asked, is she so sure that she will buy it if I don't like it? She said no.  Fair enough, except the bartender next to her had a group of folks come in. Couldn't tell if they were friends or business but there were 8 of them in the group and he proceeded to make them all drinks and then tell the group that the whole round was on them.  Hmmm....
I joked to my girl if I could be part of their group. She didn't get it. Oh and the cucumber martini at union is way better. 

Our waiter was awesome as was the buss staff.  He was polite, fun and knowledgeable about the menu.  


I probably won't be back as I'd rather go to N9ne or Botero for the same price and not have to deal with the frackin music. Plus N9ne has a cool vibe that is way more  my liking than ""Steak at the Roxbury"" feel of STK.",zX1IGD-EGF0xTbPuxpEsFg,2,0,2,YbEXuGg_MRTFq9_nNJ_Bpw

We arrived as a group of 8 for business on a Wed night, at one of the earlier seatings.   Restaurant was pretty empty, but we had to wait at the bar for the full group to arrive before they'd seat us.  If the rating was based on the hotness of the hostess, this place would be a 5 and then some; alas, it's for food and service.  We were promptly seating by our svelte and sauntering hostess in one of the back booths, loud 90s dance music blaring in the background.

Our server was nice enough, helping with the menu where it was needed.  She offered us the daily specials, which I couldn't remember any of.  Put our orders in and brought out the wine, as well as the bread.  Didn't recall the name or type but the buttery goodness I do remember distinctly.  Very yummy.  

My peppercorn encrusted filet medallion, medium rare, came out perfectly seared with the right amount of pink hues.  Very tender and flavorful.  We got sides to share - creamed sweet corn, potatoes pur√©e, asparagus, spinach, and potato al gratin.  Nothing really stood out as unique or overly amazing, but there was good flavors throughout the meal.  

I didn't get a look at the final bill, but I assume it was easily 150 a person, which put it around 1200 or so; kind of outrageous considering the food was average.  Not sure I'd revisit with all of the other great steak places in town.  1.5 for the awesome server and bus service, and .5 for the overpriced food, and 1 star for the hostess... :P",2dyLiu5hinn729KJIE8-7A,2,0,3,qns3whYZKgd2gnD_EArWug

I thought it added greatly to the ambience, and when you have people at 5 nearby tables break into song and talking across the booths to one another, I think that spells success. 

My steak (the small filet medallion) was cooked perfectly and the sauce was great. I also tried the lamb and the skirtsteak with chimichurri and would recommend both. The sides were ok. I was a little disappointed with the asparagus and the mac-n-cheese. The corn pudding was delightful, however, as was our dessert - the bread pudding. YUM. Captain Crunch and Caramel sauce. Who knew? 

The service was great, everyone was very friendly, accomodating, and happy - one server even broke into an impromptu dance when Michael Jackson's ""Billy Jean"" came on.

I thought to myself ""Oh man, I'm I going to be ridiculed for going to a ladies steak joint"". I later found out why they say that. It's because they offer and serve smaller cuts so that women would be more inclined to eat a steak. They still had larger cuts and the usual hearty sides. The Kobe sliders were amazing though very pricey but worth every dollar.

I was surprised to read that a lot of people think this place is ""overrated"". It is Vegas and a restaurant in one of the fanciest hotels on the strip so what do you expect?  Great service and a great atmosphere comes with a price.  Maybe I am bias because I didn't take care of the bill though =) 

Definitely a vibrant bar scene, drinks in hand and socializing. The scene here is kind of confusing though.  I would say a mixed crowd, definitely older.  It is a nice getaway from the typical Vegas scene with the large groups of barely dressed girls club hopping and shuffling from guestlist to guestlist.  It seems like a great place for romantic dinners, great for girls night, good for groups, ""CHEERS"" with the guys, but then you have some people dancing on chairs and tables as if it's a club?  The music and live dj adds to the whole ambiance but it's interesting when people get kind of rowdy.  But alcohol does that to all of us huh? 

Food.  Everything we had was delicious.  

wine -- great recommendation

bread -- love the green sauce

beef carpaccio -- thinnest slices of beef I've ever had!  Great texture and the flavors mixed well  

foie gras french toast -- if you eat this wrong, it'll taste wrong.  you have to get a little bit of everything in the same bite and chew it all together.  it's surprising, i loved it

pumpkin ravioli -- some people might not like the texture of pumpkin, but i love it!  it's a refreshing taste in my opinion

organic filet mignon and bone in filet -- both were delicious and cooked exactly how i wanted it, can't complain, i think the bone in is better, but both were great 

lobster was good, but not stand out in comparison to the rest of our meal

sides: we got the mac and cheese, sweet corn pudding, mushroom pot pie, and spiced maple carrots.  the standouts were the mushroom pot pie and sweet corn pudding

dessert: the sorbets come out in small scoops and small cones (SO CUTE, but careful, i dropped the scoop a few times), the cheesecake pops and chocolate mousse were okay.  I don't remember what else we had, but none of them were standout or maybe we were TUMMY STUFFED. 

Recommendations: mushroom pot pie, foie gras french toast, bone in filet.  Also the music seems to get louder as the night got later so take that into consideration, like an earlier dinner date vs trendy rowdier scene later",BH_HKhJcoCg7hsL8ezCYxA,2,1,4,AgFuOJYl2zxWKA32-s9pOw
861602,2011-05-01,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I must admit that at first we were a bit hesitant in giving this place a try. There haven't been too many reviews yet for this restaurant, which made us a little uneasy about choosing this place. All we knew is that we wanted to try a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan and both the vibe & menu of STK got our attention. 

We checked out the Chandelier Bar & managed to lose some money on the tables before heading over for our 8:00 reservation. My first impression of this place was that it was a bit smaller than I expected, and other reviewers are right in saying the music is bumping. 

We sat at the bar for about 10 mins. before being seated. Although I would have rather sat back further in the actual dining area we were seated in another dining section right off the bar...I guess it made for some good people watching at the bar (like guys with lucky poker pants...see pics)! Also, I thought it might be a little hard at first to hold a conversation over the music but to my surprise it wasn't at all...but maybe that's because the more I drink the louder I naturally get, and so goes for my spouse and probably just about everyone else out there, haha ; ) 

The bread is amazing, so amazing I took one bite and just stopped so I wouldn't get full off of just bread.  For starters, we had their foie gras french toast and beef tartare. Both were exceptional....the foie gras french toast had a very interesting flavor while being sweet at the same time and the beef tartare was actually the best I have tasted. I have only ever tried like 3 in my life, but it just surprised me how fresh, light, and tasty this one was! 

I ordered a filet, which was a bit over cooked for medium but I didn't want to send it back and just enjoyed what I could of it. My husband's ribeye was cooked a perfect rare and he just about ate the whole thing! On the side, we enjoyed maple glazed carrots and sweet corn pudding. The sweet corn pudding tasted like a dessert to me, almost not like a side at all. We passed on actual dessert and just enjoyed our wine. 

Our server was great! Usually, when we go to restaurants we are often attended to by a team of servers. And, sometimes it's even hard to figure out who the head-server is, but at STK our server stayed with us the whole time, which we enjoyed. 

One thing I wanted to note was that the music was definitely bumping and other reviewers are correct in saying if you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner for two...this isn't the place for you.

Why make a reservation if you show up 5min before and are not seated until well after your reservation time? The music is loud and anything but relaxed...our waiter wasn't that friendly to start and seemed to get annoyed when we asked him to repeat himself because we couldn't hear a thing! I am not a fan of having to get up close and personal with a stranger to order food. We spoke to a manager who was extremely professional and seemed to have a lot of practice with dealing with the noise level complaints...yes I get it that it's vegas and restaurants are loud. Our appetizers seemed to take forever. They were worth the wait though. Seemed to be that this place relies on the food to make up for a unpleasant atmosphere.

Having read reviews on yelp, I knew the bread was a must have. Holy Moly! The bread was divine and really made the meal memorable. In fact, I am still thinking of that bread a week later. The  creamed corn was also delicious and a thousand times more appetizing than my overcooked filet mignon with a runny bearnaise sauce. After ordering, I never saw the waiter again but you could tell he clearly wanted me out of there because I was offered the check before I was even asked if I wanted coffee and dessert, which of course, I did.

Always love when I read reviews and people criticize others but they themselves can't spell or have the basics of grammar correct.  At the same time when did everyone (especially you binzer) become a food critic and an expert in service.   

You say your not a fan but you keep finding yourself going back... I say to you as you say to them that you REALLY love this place but are too big of a douche to admit it and maybe the tool yourself .   If there are 100 better options than name them.

We had an amazing time the food and service was incredible. Eddy was our server and he was so awesome! So energetic, fun and knowledgeable. We started with the shellfish platter the flavor of all the seafood was all so good, so fresh so succulent mmmm... this honestly was so filling it would have satisfied us for dinner. Did we stop there though? Nope! next we got the Wagyu, I have never had Wagyu before and OMG!!! Now I know what I have been missing it was incredible!  It literally melts in your mouth! Honestly if you have an opportunity to order this, do it! You deserve to treat yourself! We all ordered a steak as well I got the 10 oz filet, medium rare with king crab Oscar topping. The steak was cooked so perfectly it honestly did not need the topping but the crab was very delish as well. All of our steaks were so perfect we all like medium rare but my brother in law ordered a bone in and Eddy our server suggested he ordered medium due to the bone it would come out a little more on the rare side if he were to go with medium rare. Eddy was on point with his suggestion. We also got the creamy Yukon potatoes, green beans and sweet corn pudding. We were so full with all the food and wine we were consuming! But we were having a blast and kept moving our bodies because the atmosphere was so fun they were playing the jams! A mix of 80's 90's and 00's, I have seen complaints of the noise level of the music and honestly I could hear what everyone in my table was saying and even our server.
Okay so we are singing along to our fave songs dancing while our plates are being removed from our table and we are so in the moment I did not notice they were laying out small plates in front of us we had a confused look on our face, what Is this for? And then Eddy brings out 2 shots for each of us and then they bring out desserts!! Omg!! Donuts with this glaze, whip cream and pecans! And a Panna cotta with strawberry topping! I think we all said at the same time ""Eddy! What are you doing to us!!"" Lol, We were so full how are we going to eat this! Well those 2 shots that were brought out,I am not sure what the first was I just drank it and the second was ginger beer, Eddy said this would help make us feel less full or something to that effect I had a lot of wine by now :) it must have worked because we dug right into the desert which was so incredible it was like a party in my mouth. 

Our whole time there we just were amazed with each bite, each sip, each song and each encounter we had with Eddy. We were headed to the club later that night so we had to run but I honestly did not want to leave and I had so much more fun at STK then I did at the night club.

The service was great but the food was lackluster. We started with salads and I had the baby beet salad which was perfectly presented and the best thing I had this evening. 

My colleague and I both ordered the 10oz filet and we shared the Yukon mashed potatoes, the Mac and cheese, and the asparagus with orange jalape√±o glaze. The steaks were very tender but lacked any real flavor, they were cooked to an exact medium rare. The Yukon mashed potatoes were a bit on the soupy side and had no form. The Mac and cheese was just that. It was like they took cooked macaroni and topped it with some cheese and baked it. It was not at all creamy and rich. My colleague and I both commented that we tasted neither orange nor jalape√±o in the asparagus sauce.

On a side note-I tried to go to the restroom but the line was so long that I was told to come back later. I'm not really sure if the guy who told me that worked there or he just had to go really badly.

Finally, there these three huge bouncer type guys who looked like they were in charge. As soon as the waiter brought the check I was signing when I heard one of these big mooks say to a group of four standing behind us, ""Yeah, these are your seats. I'm just waiting for these guys to get outta here."" I thought it was very rude. From sit down to exit we were there an hour and five minutes. We spent over $120 each and we only had iced tea to drink.

Their side dishes also aren't an afterthought-- their mac and cheese and creamed corn were so mouthwatering, I couldnt stop eating them despite ""not wanting to fill up on carbs"" (moms wisdom again!). They also have great cocktails, particularly a strawberry vodka drink with a graham cracker rim that truly tasted like a berry pie. Yum!

- King Crab Salad: Organic Mache, Melon, Kaffir Lime - Amazing! It was light and fresh and the melon added a very unique and delicious element to the crab. A must try!

- Beef Carpaccio: (special of the night) Thin slices of beef, shaved parmesan cheese and a balsamic drizzle - Melt in your mouth delicious! The balsamic balanced the saltiness of the parmesan cheese.

- Wagyu Filet: (special of the night) - Medium, and cooked to perfection! The crustiness of the outside was a great compliment to the tenderness of the inside.

- Chilean Sea Bass (special of the night) - The sea bass was perfectly flakey and laid on a bed of wild mushrooms. 

- Mushroom Pot Pie - This was DIVINE! The textures of wild mushrooms and the cream sauce was great with the crustiness of the pie shell.

- Mac and Cheese - I have to admit, I didn't think this would be very special, but to my surprise, it was phenomenal! It came out with a bread crumb/cheese crust and because I'm big on ""texture,"" the creamy, cheesy shells were a great balance.

- Bread Pudding - Rich and Decadent! The best part were these little crunchy things added on top. They looked and tasted like Cap N Crunch cereal :)

1037091,2012-11-14,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I chose STK for a friend's birthday dinner as the menu looked interesting. The food, however, was simply lacking. Nothing impressed me, nothing made me want to come back or recommend it to friends. For a pricey meal it fell short. The food warrants maybe three stars, but for the PRICE the lack of flavor and terrible textures are just inexcusable in my opinion. If you compare the menu items I list with the price on the website, you will quickly understand why this review is warranted.

We ordered: 
Appetizers - Foie Gras French Toast (which I imagined would be amazing...unfortunately, terrible texture and TASTE. It was mushy spread on mushy toast.) and Shrimp Rice Krispies. Meh. The Shrimp Rice Krispies didn't have much flavor and the ""krispiness"" became sogginess after half of a bite. The krispies were for presentation effect as they did do a ""snap, crackle, pop"" when the bisque was poured over them. These were the items that drew us in as they were the most unique. The presentation was good, but the outcome was not a success.

Entree - There were three of us. Two of us ordered the Bone-in ribeye and filet, both flavorless somehow but tender. They were the right temperature, which we appreciated. The third person ordered a smaller filet medallion with similar comment.

Sides - Mac&cheese, brussel sprouts and truffle mashed potatoes. They were good but when the SIDES are the best part, you know there is a problem. ALSO, if you are considering adding truffle butter to your steak, spare yourself the $12 and get the mashed potatoes for $11. It was basically a bowl of mashed potatoes with a pool of melted truffle butter sitting on top...which meant the initial texture was too watery to be appetizing. By the end of the meal, they hardened and were better.

Desserts - Bread pudding and Espresso Charlotte, so so. No complaints but no wow factor.

As you can see, we sampled plenty of food to make a valid judgment call. It was sad to spend so much and leave dissatisfied. Wouldn't go back given SO many better options in Vegas. Go to the Wicked Spoon buffet in the same casino. Now THAT was worth it.",3pqTV7zoyT7ekDqfNGyP1Q,4,0,2,ipcPFOVtVwhVYNcIE6joFw

I always get a steak there but this year I became a pescatarian therefore forcing me to look beyond my norm. For starters we had the Tuna Tartare which was the best I've tasted. If you love your tuna with heavy citrus, you'll enjoy this for your starter! Not sure if it was the avocado that brought the citrus but I'm here for whatever it was. We also had Foie Gras French Toast which tasted great while warm! 

My main dish wash the Alaskan crab,steamed, with side a butter of course. Pretty sure it was just two legs though lol So I def wouldn't suggest that if you're too hungry such as I was.
I filled up on their delicious cocktails though! 
The Strawberry Cobbler was amazing. I had 3... lol
They rim the glass with graham cracker this mixes so well with the drink itself. The Belvedere mixed with sour, muddled strawberries and syrup made for a great after dinner drink, almost like a dessert! Yummmm

Our server Kat was pretty great to us. As busy as she was, she made sure everyone was good and not needing for anything. She also didn't make us feel rushed to order or to leave when it was time. 

If you've never been to STK, I highly suggest it. Make it a date night with the girls or spouse even if it's just for a drink. It is a little pricy but the experience is well worth it.

I had a 9:30pm reservation last week.  Needless to say, this was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I've been dining out in Vegas for over 10 years and have always had exceptional meals and experiences.  These were the most pretentious, obnoxious, rude and unprofessional people.  I don't mind waiting 15 minutes for a reservation, but we didn't sit down until 10:45pm.  No one at the host desk apologized, offered us a round of drinks, nothing.  They just ignored us. When we finally sat down, the woman who sat us didn't even apologize.  We had a very nice waiter who was apologetic even though it wasn't his fault.  He got the ""manager"" for us and some guy named Josh came over, apologized and offered to ""take care of us"" during our dining experience.  That never happened.  So fake!

Folks, if you want to eat here, go early, expect to wait and expect the hosts and managers to be inattentive and rude.  I think they are there to look like they are in control, with their headsets and designer suits and skimpy outfits.  They are pretty much useless.

1167173,2017-10-14,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"My last review of STK LV was not as favorable. We had a really awful experience and when the management read my last review, they reached out & wanted to make things right. 

Last nights experience was a complete 180 from the last. We were SO grateful to all of the staff that made everything perfect & us want for nothing. You guys went above & beyond and I am truly thankful. 

We were greeted by Manager Clayton who lead us to our table and assured us that things would be totally different. Our server Brad, was nothing short of AMAZING. Seriously great personality and SO on top of his game, he puts all other servers from all other restaurants I've been to, to shame! We loved Brad! 

Clayton was kind enough to offer us drinks, champagne to start and then we ordered apps. Specifically, The Burrata, the BRGs, & the Beef Carpaccio. (I had to sample everything) and WOW! The flavor combo's, freshness & inventiveness of the dishes were SO good. The Burrata was not all skin like a lot of places, the tomatoes & sauce were so fresh & delish. The angel hair that was paired with the beef carpaccio was excellent and let's not forget the BRG's, those little burgers were flavor packed, not greasy and SO tasty! I almost forgot their signature bread in the beginning, so indulgent but oh so good. The pesto was divine.

In between a very busy night with tons of orders in the kitchen, the chef was kind enough to come out and personally introduce himself and apologize for our last experience. (which to be fair, was not his fault, it was mostly due from a very nasty server we had) He really didn't have to come say hello, I know how busy it is in the kitchen and we really appreciated that gesture. Very nice. 

(the Dj playing top 40s and mixing in oldie's made the atmosphere really fun)

On to the Mains, we each ordered a steak, how can you not at a place that's well known for their meat? Mine was the porterhouse done medium, the temp was perfect, the flavor was great, the jalepeno onions had a nice kick to them which topped my steak. The sides I ordered were broccolini, creamed spinach-YUM, mashed potatoes-good, and I didn't sample the others...I was getting full. The best side for me was the one the chef specially prepared. There is an entree with Spaetzle, a favorite indulgence of mine that isn't easy to find anywhere. They made sure I had a a special side of Spaetzle and Chef's twist on it was SO good! Very talented I have to say ;) 

Brad & Christian (his assistant who was also on top of it & awesome) made sure we didn't even ask for refills & kept all of our waters/drinks replenished. They made sure all of the dishes were exceptional & their graciousness was so appreciated! 

After almost having to unzip my dress, it was time for dessert. The choc chip cookie was recommended as the best and it was certainly tasty, but the donuts??? OMG, if there was one dessert I could chose for a cheat meal, this would be it! I was so full, but managed to indulge a little more. 

One last cheers, thanked our gracious hosts & the night concluded with us feeling so grateful that we had been so well taken care of. It would have been one thing for STK to cover apps or a main each but they completely took care of the entire bill to make up for our terrible time last. They went well above & beyond. 

The people at STK are committed to providing not only excellent food but superior service and gaining repeat customers...which they certainly have in us. Thank you all again! Until next time!

1167615,2011-06-09,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"My first experience with STK was at the NYC location, and I was hardly surprised when they decided to bring an STK to my current digs in Los Angeles -- a city that has its fair share of trendy restaurants that lack culinary inspiration. Suffices to say I was less than shocked when I heard the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas would also feature an STK restaurant. 

My experiences at all three locations have been markedly different. The NYC location boasted good food and a classy atmosphere in the Meatpacking District (an area which wasn't hurting for culinary hot-spots at the time) and was able to deliver consistently, even in its nascent stages (I moved out of NYC shortly after it opened so I wasn't able to see how the restaurant fared in the later stages of its existence). While the steaks left something to be desired, the restaurant was trendy and the overall experience was fun. I'll unabashedly add that, hands down, the best steaks still come from Texas. 

When the Los Angeles restaurant opened, I was happy to see that same ambiance maintained, but unfortunately, the food was inconsistent at best (definitely nothing to write home about) and it's ""trendiness"" quickly declined within its first year. STK LA's biggest redeeming quality was (and still is) its proximity to other LA nightlife hotspots, and the location is enough to get me there with a group of friends for some cocktails and light appetizers to kick the night off. 

Fast forward to 2011 and the latest trendy hotel in Vegas, the Cosmopolitan, now boasts its very own STK. A group of us made up of my closest friends from Texas, New York and California were staying at the hotel for the weekend to celebrate my birthday, so we decided to check out STK. I tried making a resie through the hotel but, annoyingly, the restaurant handles its own reservations and my call was promptly directed to their hostess. Getting a reservation was easy enough -- I called 4 days in advance of our arrival -- and we figured 9:30pm would be a good time to eat before an insanely late night of dancing. Our group of 4 arrived on time and the hostess informed us that the wait would be half an hour...with a reservation. Disgruntled, but determined not to let the unfortunate news spoil our mood, we proceeded to the bar to have some very expensive, very plain drinks -- if you are price-sensitive and like to imbibe, then this is not the restaurant for you. 

45 minutes later, we were seated and STARVING. This is when things got exponentially better. Our servers were incredibly fun, enthusiastic and attentive. Throughout the entire meal, our waitress helped us by making great recommendations, taking photos of us to help commemorate the trip, and showering us with an endless supply of complimentary birthday shots as well as a celebratory dessert plate, replete with delectable bite-sized cake and ice-cream lollipops. Crisis averted. Be sure to request Raquel M. as your server -- Raquel and her fellow cohorts will make sure you have a blast. The restaurant manager even let us explore the kitchen, meet the chef, observe the plating ritual and peruse all the fresh ingredients. The kitchen was very clean and well managed and the staff was very friendly. 

The giant seafood platter we ordered was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone but me (I'm picky, obvi) --  the king crab was a little soggy for my taste and the oysters left me underwhelmed -- and the steaks were actually better than the ones I had at the NYC and LA locations. I ordered the ribeye medium rare and the cut and flavor were excellent. Still not on par with Texas steaks, but as far as the STK chain goes, I really enjoyed my meal.

Net/net, while the steaks at STK restaurants are not my favorite, the ambiance is usually pretty fun and the staff at the Las Vegas location absolutely made this experience worthwhile. If you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and/or looking for a fun/trendy place to eat before you head to Marquee, this is the place to go.",b1GrLfhmXk6aDsA18LvEXw,2,2,4,YR0IjP_nlVTnWpT4OrD0Jw

Our party of 5 showed up without a reservation around 7, 730pm and were seated within 10 minutes. Our drinks from the bar hadn't even arrived so they were brought to our booth. 

Ambience was great, a DJ was spinning some excellent tunes (think Bennie and the Jetts) - although music was a bit loud for conversation.

I had the 10 oz. filet and my friend had the organic chicken. I loved the crust on my steak. The steak was tender and flavorful despite the fact that I opted out of any additional toppings/sauce for my steak (I'm a purist). The chicken was very soft and moist, although the portion was very small.

We shared sides:
-mac and cheese (standard, nothing special. I consider myself a mac  n cheese connoisseur and I like a good crispy crust with cheesy al dente pasta but this was more a creamy white concoction that I wasn't in love with)
-parmesan truffle fries (not shoe string but more like perfectly rectangular steak fries, stacked kinda like jenga. pretty good but again, nothing to die for)
-roasted carrots (baby yellow and orange market carrots - delicious, tender, flavorful)
-mushroom pot pie (presentation was great. They bring it out in it's little pot, cut around the top of the crust and dump the dish out upside down onto another plate. Presentation was better than the flavor - basically different mushrooms in a creamy sauce, but still fun.)

Had a 6:30 reservation and arrived a little bit early.  The hostess selected a really crummy table, but there were lots of other better tables available, and the place was not busy at all.  Having none of that, I asked for a better table and got a little better one.  The thing is, they seat you cheek by jowl, and it isn't comfortable, and certainly doesn't seem like fine dining.  

Atmosphere?  Granted, it was still early, but there was no DJ playing, and the place seemed dead.  Under those conditions, the concept of this place doesn't work.  It felt like eating at CPK at the mall.  

The food?  The food must be amazing, right?  Not so much.  The food was in the ballpark, but I've had better at lots of places.

Had 11:30 reservations on Valentine's Day. They could have sat us right away but instead had us stand at the bar first for about 5 minutes. Atmosphere is supposed to be laid back with the Severs in pjs and a live band playing (which we never saw when we were there...only a loud DJ). They start out your meal with monkey bread and cream cheese dipping sauce. I found it to be sickening sweet but my husband thought it wasn't too bad. He liked it. For entrees we ordered shrimp & grits and short rib hash. Both were good but rather small. The shrimp & grits could have been served in a martini glass because it was the size of a shrimp cocktail. The grits looked like a lot but they were spread so thin on the plate you only got a few bites. Same with the hash. Also, my husband asked for egg whites that he did not get. Service was good but we felt rushed. We were only there 30 minutes! Talk about trying to turn over tables fast! We thought brunch would be leisurely & sit back and enjoy ourselves but oh well. Decided to get another drink somewhere else. So for our meals, 1 glass of champagne, & a beer it was just under $90 plus tip. Too expensive for what you get.

Truffle Fries - oily, poorly seasoned
Beef Carpacio - sooo good, great flavor
Tartare - fresh, great presentation
Beet Salad - big hit, beets w: gorgonzola, super fresh and tasty.
Lobster Cocktail - tinie, tiny.. claw portion with small bits of lobster in tomato broth = absolute waste of money.
For our Entrees we had 2 steaks, risotto, seared ahi, side spinach and Mac n cheese.
All of the entrees were good, not mind blowing or memorable - just good. The Mac n Cheese should be removed from the menu - horrible. The spinach was boring, flavorless. 
The only spark during this experience was our server - she was awesome. 
I definitely won't return, having sampled several items and only appreciating 2 ( beet , carpacio) of them... It's not enough to bring me back.",dMRvVUdoiBx0Jf3bgZvm3Q,0,0,3,ynBHTghDpHXzccSLo1ppeQ

Our group had a reservation, and we were seated on a Thursday night as soon as we arrived. For food, all of the steaks, toppings, & sauces were incredible - I highly encourage you to ask your waiter for recommendations on what to pair together. For sides, the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Creamed Spinach were my favorites, but all of them were very tasty.

1228723,2015-11-09,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Love, love, love this place! I've heard so many great things about Stk, but at first, I have to admit that I was a little bit hesitant to try it. Over here in LA, we have so many eateries and when we want a good steak and service, we always resort to Ruth Chris's. 

My boyfriend and I made reservations to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. When I called the restaurant, I never told the hostess that we were celebrating anything and the next available reservation she had available was at 11:15. Ofcourse, it being a Friday night and in Vegas, we figured we could do a little bit of gambling at the casino before having dinner. We arrived at the restaurant around 11 and instantly, we loved the vibe of the restaurant and the beautiful decor. Normally, the bf and I would want a nice, quiet environment   for dinner since we're in our early 30s (yes, we're old!), but we figured, why not since we're in Vegas. The restaurant was busy, but filled with good music. We decided to grab a drink at the bar while waiting. I've been to Vegas many times and usually, it takes a while for a male to order a drink. The kind bartender instantly noticed my boyfriend and helped us out. Customer service is one of the biggest things we value when we go out to eat and if a place doesn't have good customer service, we usually aren't returning customers.  

The hostess sat us to our table and asked us if we were celebrating anything. We just responded that we were in Vegas for a wedding, but we decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and also celebrate our anniversary since we haven't been out in a while. Our server was named Luis acknowledged us immediately and served us some of their delicious and buttery bread. He explained to us the menu and also the sauces that we can add-on to our steak, if we wanted. I ordered the rib-eye, medium rare and the bf ordered the same thing. As sides, we ordered the broccolini and the mac and cheese. 

 Our food came out on time but I noticed that my steak was cooked more on the medium well as I cut into it. I normally don't like to complain, and I wasn't going to, but our waiter Luis noticed that our steaks weren't what we had ordered and wanted to make things right. He took back our steaks and had new ones made. While our steaks were being made, the bf and I just snacked on the broccolini since we were starving. As soon as Luis brought back our new steaks, he brought out some new sides because he wanted our sides to be warm for our steaks. He kindly apologized about the food and also brought us some shots.

Our steaks and our sides were absolutely delicious! The mac and cheese was creamy, the broccolini had a nice parmesan garlic flavor to it, and our steaks were cooked to perfection. I added a side of chimichurri sauce and that made my steak even more heavenly. As soon as we finished our meal, Luis found out from the hostess that we were celebrating an anniversary, and brought us a complimentary dessert! The desserts consisted of a warm apple crisp and a chocolate cheesecake. Both desserts were scrumptious and after eating there, I was afraid the zipper on my desk would rip! Lol. We ended up also chatting with another worker named Chris who gave us some recommendations on things to do that were nearby. He also explained how he enjoyed working at Stk because of how the staff feels like a family since they also hang out after work. 

Luis and Chris, you guys are amazing! One of you told us that anyone who comes in is treated like VIP at Stk, and I truly believe it. The food and the customer service is why we will be returning to eat there in the future, every time we make a trip out to Vegas. Thank you for making our 4 year anniversary very memorable for the both of us!",4bRLc9_8XzvfbrIQLVSRkw,0,0,5,E6zuuY5NPS2Mq4ee8L3vYQ
1230223,2015-09-15,2,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Did STK have an off-night when I ate there? I'm completely mystified by the raving reviews about the food. We made a reservation for dinner and was seated near their bar area, which made for interesting people watching. Our waitress was upbeat and friendly. Everything was going well... until the food came.

The steaks that were supposed to be spectacular were dry, chewy, and lacking in flavor. Even without shelling an additional $2 for sauces, steaks should stand on their own merit.

I had the seared tuna. The tuna itself was fresh, but the sauce used was way too heavy and overwhelming for such a delicate, 'lean' fish (as opposed to another type of fish, such as salmon). Did not hold together as a coherent entr√©e at all.

The mushroom pot pie was the star of the show, and the fries were thick cut, and while crispy, was inundated in truffle oil flavor. I am starting to agree with Gordon Ramsey who says that truffle oil is the one ingredient that is reserved for amateurs. Way too much reliance on truffle oil to make the side 'great.'

With the price we paid for this meal we could've gotten an amazing steak dinner off the strip. Perhaps it was my mistake to expect good food from STK.

3-stars still, because I liked the ambiance and the service. 2 stars off for mediocre and disappointing food at a price point and location that should have guaranteed quality.",oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA,3,2,3,OC8_DjRAYQQn9WugOpJiXg

I had a 9:30pm reservation last week.  Needless to say, this was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I've been dining out in Vegas for over 10 years and have always had exceptional meals and experiences.  These were the most pretentious, obnoxious, rude and unprofessional people.  I don't mind waiting 15 minutes for a reservation, but we didn't sit down until 10:45pm.  No one at the host desk apologized, offered us a round of drinks, nothing.  They just ignored us. When we finally sat down, the woman who sat us didn't even apologize.  We had a very nice waiter who was apologetic even though it wasn't his fault.  He got the ""manager"" for us and some guy named Josh came over, apologized and offered to ""take care of us"" during our dining experience.  That never happened.  So fake!

Folks, if you want to eat here, go early, expect to wait and expect the hosts and managers to be inattentive and rude.  I think they are there to look like they are in control, with their headsets and designer suits and skimpy outfits.  They are pretty much useless.

If you need to eat in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, go to Blue Ribbon Sushi, these guys know what they are doing, service is great and the food is crazy good!

It was towards the end of our trip where we found ourselves checked out of the hotel but waiting for a later flight sooooo steak it is!

We got here too early to really get the feel of the place but it seemed to be like the NYC STK, a trendy steakhouse.

Ordered a salad and a sirloin as I've been known to do...  

Service was solid, server was nice enough and attentive without being overly good or bad in any way.  

Salad was a bit of a dissapointment, was sort of a hodpodge between a regular salad and a blue cheese wedge.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.

The steak was very solid though.  Ordered rare + and it came out medium rare so that was fine.  Sort of underseasoned but I was able to fix that with the ton of pepper and salt the waitress brought over.  Overall the steak was good to very good but not Del Frisco's/Sparks level.  

The sides were pretty good as well, creamed spinach was nice in particular. 

There are entirely too many options to ever head back to this place again but I would say if you're in the hotel and hungry it is a solid choice.  Boarderline 3/4 star I'll give it the bump to 4.",7tudfx4R-GoD1C8BkXOLJQ,1,1,4,X5Y7s64XfFejRfHdOeNyiA

They serve a warm, bleu cheese bread. No chocolate on the dessert menu though- WTH? 
Other reviews claim the music is extremely loud, but we did not experience that. The DJ was awesome! 80's & 90's hits had people get up and dance next to their tables. We were seated close to the DJ and held a conversation with ease. Our group ranged in age from 30-42, and all of us agreed the music definitely added to the experience. 

Waiter was great, didn't rush us even when the place started getting slammed. You MUST have reservations. Not cheap though. Four of us, appetizers, cocktails + dinner- $500. We go to Vegas twice a year for 15 years- this was our favorite restaurant experience so far.

We started with the Shellfish Platter($40.00/person).  Oysters, shrimp, king crab and ceviche....the oysters were well-shucked and tasty, about two per person....shrimp, one per person, overcooked and tough, the crab was skinny and dry and the ceviche was a joke(garlic and citrus flavors were conspicuously weak), I had to ask for more chips, which were thin and poorly suited texture wise as an accompaniment.

Wedge salad next($16.00), too creamy, bacon was decent, but not of the best flavor/quality.  The dish was ""ok""...was hoping for excellent.

Got the Free range chicken (maybe 1/3rd of small chicken) with polenta fries....it was exceptionally tasty, and a fabulous deal at $29.00.  Tried my friend's steaks and was glad I went with the chicken.  We shared broccoli, truffle fries and asparagus for the table, all $12.00 and all meh.

I'm torn writing this because I have mixed reviews on different components of the restaurant.

Ambiance:  4 Stars
This place is full of energy, yet remains classy and trendy.  It's filled with attractive people which helps cover for the poor food.  The DJ plays great music, but be prepared to yell to talk with you dinner guests.

Service:  3 Stars
Service wasn't memorable.  Average for a fine dining restaurant.

Food:  2 Stars
Portions are small and the food is decent.  I had higher expectations given the STK brand.  I've had better food at steakhouses at a 1/4 of the prices at STK.

Value:  3 Stars
Expect to pay over $50 a person on average.  This ranking is based on the average of the three scores above.

This is a great place to start your evening as a pre-party for a long Saturday night. Alternatively, great place to end your evening with some energy on a weekday.  Avoid STK if you are looking for a quiet intimate evening or to walk away with a full belly.

I ordered the 10oz filet with a side of bearnaise sauce, while one friend got the dover sole and another the rib eye.  My filet was absolutely perfect and while my steak was medium the friends rib eye was medium rare and both were cooked exactly as they should.  My friend ordered the sweet corn pudding for the table that wasn't my favorite and I would have preferred good old creamed corn.

I of course decided on my blue pin striped suit with colorful pocket square to add that bit of splash. 

I went past the line and straight for the bar since you have access to their full menu. They have two bars here. If the first one is full continue towards the back and you will most likely find an open seat.  The bar tenders were absolute dolls and very attentive, making you feel at home.  With the DJ spinning tracks in the background and with dim lighting, it sets you up for an evening out on the town. 

First came out the bread which gets mad reviews from Yelpers across the board. I thought the hype was over the top, turns out it live up to it and plus more. 

I started my dinner with a field greens salad which I didn't expect much other than a common mixed greens salad.  It was amazing and definitely worth a try if you liked feta cheese. Beside the vinaigrette which was full flavored it had candied pecans which were succulent.

On to the main course, their Colorado Rack of Lamb. Ordered it medium rare as any respective lamb lover should.  It was seasoned to perfection and sinfully marbled. You are almost forced to gnaw on the bone and since I was at the end of the bar counter, I couldn't help myself and sneaked in a couple of nibbles. It was simply that good. 

For desert, on recommendation from the lovely bar tender, I went with the sweat potato donuts with caramelized walnuts. Mind you I hate anything sweet potato but after being referred to as honey, sweetie and babe the whole night I couldn't refuse the recommendation.

I'm glad I did because it was epic and in the top three deserts I have ever had in Vegas. I paired it with a latte and it was to die for. A definite must have.",xBvDrnp8Kl45aXkuRTeRvA,3,2,5,3HONBlRjg8Wt6glSf6Ku1Q

The taste was excellent too but the consistency could have been just a bit less chewy(I'm used to eating rib eyes that melt in your mouth.) I also had a caesar salad which was a couple wedges of lettuce mixed with caesar dressing and light cheese. It was exactly how a caesar salad should be, the dressing was not over powering and was not too sour and the lettuce was crisp. We also had the mac and cheese which was really good, but it was a bit sweet for mac and cheese. I don't need that much sugar in my mac and cheese. We also had the brussell sprouts which were just OK, nothing special. The restaurant also gives some kind of bleu cheese bread with dinner, and although I do not like bleu cheese, it really does not taste anything like bleu cheese, but the olive oil dip that comes with the bread is really really good. The bread by itself was just OK but with the olive oil it was excellent. Lastly we received three different plates of dessert because my friend knew the GM. The dessert was excellent, one plate had three types of cheesecake, the second had a couple different types of mousse and creme brulee, and the third plate had some kind of apple cobbler with captain crunch and vanilla ice cream which was outstanding. The captain crunch was interesting but it actually worked with the dessert! 

2) Ambiance
This has to be the loudest restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life.  It is basically a club with a restaurant built inside it. I didn't see the club speakers as they must have been well hidden but the music was really really loud. So loud that you have trouble hearing people at your table, even the person sitting next to you. Our waiter even got one of my friends orders wrong because he heard him wrong. The DJ who was playing the music, his booth was right behind our table which was kinda funny. Some of the music was questionable, such as Informer by Snow, or Blow the Whistle by Too Short, and some other ghetto rap. He might as well have played Jump by Kriss Kross and Ice Ice Baby by Vanilla Ice.  Don't get me wrong, I was born a hip hop fan and DJ but I don't really want to eat a $100 meal with bass shaking my table and chairs with music so loud that I speak less at dinner because I don't want to have to shout at my friends just so they can hear me.  If the music was about 5 - 10 decibels lower, I think it would have been much better.

Overall, it is definitely worth trying for the food.  Just be prepared to yell at your friends so they can hear what you are saying.",qhqYQ0vbhjBFZN4fU93M9Q,2,1,3,tcxJhYMjJKvaxmaVI22U8w
1325091,2013-01-31,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"If all you're doing is coming here for a quite night and have a great steak, I'd probably recommend one of the steakhouses in the Venetian/Palazzo the taste is much better there. But if you do still want to have a good quality steak far better than going to like Outback Steakhouse or something like that, and be able to be loud, drink, take shots and prepare for a night that you can't ever talk about again, then STK is the place for you. 

The Cosmo is just poppin' all the time, its not a huge casino so most of its bars and clubs are all not to far away from each other. Which probably keeps the energy and atmosphere high no matter where you are. 

The steaks here are as good as any upscale steakhouse, maybe not top end liks Mastro's, but right in line with Fleming's, and Boa (I'm not a fan of Boa though). Nothing that will blow your socks off in terms of quality, but nothing to really complain about considering the prices you're about to pay.

The food...3 stars; Loud, uncool music... Negative 1 star; Not honoring a reservation made 2 months in advance until an hour after the reservation time...Negative 1 star; Taking a reservation for 12, when not a table in the place is big enough for comfortably sit 8...Negative 1 star.

OK, I won't be going back to STK.  

It's way too loud for anything except a dance club, let alone a (theoretical) steak restaurant...they're trying too hard to be cool.  This means not even a two person table could have a diner conversation; but if a dinner date without talking is for you, then this could be the place.  Might as well bring earplugs...the 80s music isn't worth listening to anyway.

Not a place for large parties.  I planned on a nice dinner with a group of friends and celebrating a birthday.  Shame on STK for even taking a reservation for 12 and confirming it 24 hours ahead of time, if the restaurant isn't set up for large groups.  Almost all of the tables are fixed booths, so there's no re-arranging...and the booths are pretty much 6 to 8 people comfortably.  It would have been nice to have known, before everyone is sitting in each other's lap for an expensive dinner.

The waiter was pleasant and efficient, the food was OK.  Host staff was useless.

1329315,2011-09-07,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Appetizer: Foie Gras French Toast - $24 = this dish did not work for us. I've had my share of Foie Gras and was thoroughly disappointed. While you do get your money's worth, the thickness and chunkiness reminded me of three pieces of spam stacked on one another. Foie Gras is just so rich. It should be enjoyed as a delicacy, not a monstrosity. And while foie gras is typically served with toast. Being mixed with sweet french  toast and caramelized apples, was  like an episode of Jersey Shore - a hot mess with just too much going on. 

Main Dishes: 
7 Oz Skirt Steak - $25
12 Oz Skirt Steak- $32
-- for the quality of the steaks, not worth it. The dipping sauce reminded me of A-1. Really, nothing spectacular. 

Sides: 
Foie Gras Topping - $15 - Tip - this worked better with the steak. However, it was the same amount as the appetizer (2.5 ounces). Do yourself a favor if you do want to try the foie gras appetizer,  just order the appetizer and not the topping as well. you'll have more than enough to save some for the steak probably. 

Truffle Fries - $10 -  the fries are extremely thick jenga style sized fries. I think truffle works better on shoe string fries. I could not really taste the truffle. 

Mushroom Pot Pie - $10 - the server takes the fun out of a pot pie. I was excited to dig into it, but they go ahead and do the fun part for you. The server will cut the top open and spill the mushroom filling out and over the crust which will become a soggy mess. the little pastry you actually get was extremely salty. 

Ambiance - Decor and service was great. Music is REALLY loud. Being a music lover and person who does not mind night clubs, I actually didn't mind. But I can understand how many people would be put off by this. So be forewarned: not a romantic or quiet dinner spot. 

Overalll - great place to grab pre-dinner drinks/meet up with folks before headed out, but not a great place for an actual dinner.

If everything was about $5-$10 dollars cheaper, it would be okay.

I had the 7oz filet medallions medium which was not cut so it left me a bit confused. I figure medallions would be sliced when served. It was nothing special. Not juicy. Not melt in your mouth delicious. It was just a piece of filet. 

Birthday boy had a 10oz filet medium rare with the foie gras topper. The foie gras was a pretty generous portion. He savored his meal saying it was nice and buttery. 

The other 2 guys eating healthy chose the ahi tuna rare which was a big portion. It could've been shared between the two of them. They said it was good and fresh. 

The sides: first off the server told us we should all order our own bc it was too small to share. At $11 a side you wonder wth? Not family style like most steakhouses?! So we got the broccolini, green beans, and mushroom potpie. When the sides came out I admit they were small but not so small you couldn't share. So the guys felt hustled by our server haha. The broccolini wasn't bad, the jalepeno gave it a spicy kick. I liked the soy glaze on the green beans. Then the mushroom potpie... Oh man! Yes I have to agree with other reviews this is a must order for sides. Another item on this trip that was worth one of my diet cheats. The cream sauce was rich but not overpowering and the mushrooms are a mixture of various kinds which was neat. The crust was flaky and light. 

Overall I will not be going back to STK. I'd prolly only go back for the mushroom potpie. Nothing spectacular but a decent dinner. Birthday boy enjoyed it. He also enjoyed the complimentary bread and parsley butter. I had a tiny piece and it was good! 

So there you have it. STK was only good for mushroom potpie and free bread hence the reason for no pics bc it wasn't worthy. Ha!",rJX-MVc0xDHtwYrDY7VpTQ,2,1,3,0-Hj9wBr7TnhWi3USB7s_Q

Those times were just too early and too late. We passed by the place around 4 and tried to bribe our way to get a table around 7 and the hostess told us that there was a section (the tall tables) that are first come first serve and they usually fill up by 7. So, we left and two of us came back at about 6:20pm and got a table easily. Out of about 12 or so, after us, there were only 2 tables left and they filled up in 10 min...so if you can't reserve a table, arrive around 6 to get a tall table!

Service was great all night by the busser and waitress. Cleared dirty dishes out quickly and checked on us often. We did bring a bottle of wine ourselves and was told that there was a $50 corkage fee. My friend complained to the waitress saying it was BS to charge that much to open a bottle and politely asked if she could ask her manager to not charge him (since he was a Cosmo VIP guest) or at least reduce the fee. The manager reduced it to $25.

Atmosphere was cool, they have a live DJ playing and he was spinning 80's music the whole time, that was dope. Definitely an upscale resto. They say you're supposed to dress formal/""nice"" but I came in jean booty shorts, a cropped top and black flats. Other girls were dressed like they were going to a winter formal. 

We started off with a dozen of half shell oysters, they were pretty small. Ordered the mac and cheese, it was alright (not a huge mac and cheese fan but the others loved it). Ordered the truffle parmesan fries, these were thicker fries than I thought but they were really good! And for my entree, I ordered the porterhouse to share with my friend because it was such a huge dish. Also got the red wine bbq? sauce on the side, and omg, it was sooooooooo good!! I dipped everything in that sauce! haha. Also ordered the stiletto cucumber cocktail, it's pretty minty, it was good. Friends ordered the chocolate cocktail, not a huge fan of chocolate..but if you're a chocolate lover, this one's for youu!

1374324,2012-12-05,2,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I'm going to bottom line this and then do the review. Will I go back? No. But that's mostly because this place isn't for me. This is a place for someone looking to drop some serious coin on a very good (maybe even great) dinner before heading out to the club. Being as I haven't been to a club in this millennium, and driving house music isn't my bag, I won't be back. That's not to say that this is a bad restaurant - it's just not for me.

Now, as for the review.

Well - the only way for me to review this place is to tell a quick story. My wife and I stopped by looking for a nice dinner before heading out for a show. We were suited/dressed up, and quickly realized we were well overdressed, despite what the prices on the menu would seem to hint in regards to dress.

We were seated at a booth/table combo with the booth facing out to the restaurant and the chair facing the wall. I, being the gentlemen (on occasion, really), let my wife have the view of the restaurant while I chose the view of her. And that was the defining decision of the night.

Unbeknownst to us at the time we were seated next to the rejected cast of the Jersey Shore. Or at the very least the mother/daughter combo. Thick Jersey accent, drunk, and full of drama. The daughter went on for a good 15 minutes about how awesome it was that I let my wife have the view of the restaurant and what a gentleman I was. The mother didn't say much - I'm assuming she was simply too drunk to communicate. The daughter was interrupted by the brother coming in (for apparently the third time) to start an argument with the mother/daughter about the fact that they needed to leave and he was tired of waiting. He came back once more during dinner to do the same. And having to watch them eat (they were seated right next to us, so you couldn't avoid it) was both comical and disgusting at the same time.

Fortunately they left before our appetizers arrived. The waitstaff, who really should have thrown them out, made it up to my wife and I with champagne. Fortunately, I'm a man that can be plied with free alcohol. The little adventure gave us a great rapport with the waitstaff. They took great care of us for the remainder of the night.

As for the food, we started with the foie gras French toast and the shrimp ""rice krispy treat"", which was really a bisque with toasted rice. The bisque was fantastic with just a bit of a spice to it. The foie gras French toast was very good, but the bread was a bit thick, which overpowered the foie gras.

For dinner my wife went for the filet (peppercorn crusted), and I did the ribeye with the same preparation. We both went rare. The filet was perfectly done. The ribeye, well, it was bordering on medium. When the server came back over to ask how everything was, the fact that I didn't immediately say ""it's great!"" let her know something was wrong. She immediately scooped up the plate, apologized, and had the kitchen fire a new one. The second one came out cooked perfectly. In fact, when they came out with the second steak they brought out a new thing of potatoes, which was our side. I give them full props for fixing the mistake instantly.

As I mentioned at the beginning, I don't think I'll go back. That has more to do with the music/atmosphere than with the Jersey Shore rejects. If you're looking for a club dinner before a club outing, stop by. If you're looking for a reserved steak dinner, this is absolutely *not* the place to go.",Eg1T--knapihoR2GV-Dj_w,0,0,4,ArqeHZsww6I8O4uawpJ4LA

Prior to coming, I was told over the phone that they can only split up 4 checks per table. So when our server, James, split up and provided everyone a bill, I was surprised as I told each girl to bring cash to avoid any confusion. It didn't totally cross my mind at the time, but I was staying at the Cosmo at the time in a wraparound suite and am also an identity member.

It appeared that the manager had a personal bias towards these two patrons based upon ethnicity, but who knows.  Maybe the guy was just a moron and having a bad night.

1391734,2013-04-11,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"A mediocre restaurant with poor service staging as a nice steakhouse slash night club.

I understand lounge music while dining, but having a DJ and the volume on full blast is just way too much.  When I'm at dinner, I like to be able to hear the people I'm sitting with.  It's ridiculous, even shouting my mother and I couldn't hear each other.  STK is a place ""to be seen,"" however it wouldn't hurt them to lean more towards restaurant and focus less on trendy.  STK, are you for pregame drinking or are you for fine dining?

Luckily, I suppose, we just stopped in for a snack at the lounge area.  It's situated so you sort of have to be on the couch next to strangers-- but that's okay.  When the cocktail came around, we ordered the hamachi sashimi and beef tartare.  The food took a little while to come out, but it was busy so thats okay too.  

The music I can live with but the service was really why STK is 2 star to me.  The hamachi was good, nothing to rave about but still good.  Instead of receiving beef tartare we were given beef carpaccio so I let the waitress know, and she rudely said ""Well you said carpaccio not tartare but did you want me to take it back?'  YIKES it's not my fault you can't hear me, the music is really loud!  She took it back and we were promptly delivered tuna tartare.  Closer, but still wrong- we let her know and she kind of just walked away.  When she came back (we hadn't touched it) she asked us if we wanted to keep it... confused if she meant keep that instead or keep that also, we just said no just the beef tartare please.  Finally the beef tartare came out from an apologetic busser and it was like the hamachi, good but not the best.  Everyone in the lounge seats next to us had that supposedly amazing bread that everyone keeps yelping about.  Is it complementary?  We never received any... was it because she found us to be difficult?  I also ordered a beet salad to go.  When it says that it comes with arugula, it means a few sprigs.  I would call it more of a side order roasted beets.

I would try STK again because I feel like I need to try some steak and that amazing ""complementary"" bread, but are they open for lunch?  Because I could live without the DJ and that girls attitude.",4NfIpag40h-YuBz461eGFg,3,0,2,SXbsmDD5Kp1mNG0g2_iXjg

So my husband ordered the seared tuna which the waiter said was very spicy so my husband jumped on it. I ordered the filet and mashed potatoes. They sent us bread and an interesting dipping sauce that reminded me of a wheatgrass shot. No bueno. So our food arrived I was excited, the steak was good. Not amazing which I expected for a 6oz. $40 steak from a place known for steak. My husband, a true spicy freak was sad his food wasn't spicy at all. So he asked the waiter for hot sauce which got us a really dirty look. Apparently we offended him. Mashed potatoes were ok. I ordered another $16 drink and we were ready to go. Got our check, put our cash down with at least $50 due in change and I guess the waiter expected that as his tip? Once again when we asked for our change we got the glare and some sarcastic remark. Needless to say, don't be rude to your customers...he definitely didn't get the $50 tip he was hoping for.

We arrived at the bar to have a drink and maybe an app before we went to a lounge at another hotel. He promptly greeted us with a wine list and a smile. Unlike all the other Vegas bartenders who are too concerned about their eyebrows or their pending American Idol audition, Michael actually cared about which glass of wine we ordered and didn't try to convince us to get the over-oaked California cab du jour that the management was pushing. So we sat down and decided to get cozy.
After perusing the menu for a minute, we told Michael to pick out some of his favorites. The secret is... the people that work there always know what's best. We're hungry. While we waited, Michael introduced us to some of the other bar staff and guests. While we ate yummy, warm blue cheese bread we talked to young, sexy people, listened to fun music and ordered more drinks. 
The food arrives. Carnivore heaven. The centerpiece was a bone-in ribeye, sliced to share. Side of bearnaise. Parmeasan fries. Spiced carrots? Who would have thought spiced carrots? Utterly, ridiculously good. Everything was SO good.  Only problem was that there wasn't MORE. 
No dessert, just more drinks. Come here if you like to have fun and have a good time. You just might like it. Michael and the bar staff were amazing, unforgettable. Thank you. Can't wait to come back.

I enjoy going in a larger group, 4 or more, and sitting in a booth. Not the place you want to go for a quiet dinner. This is more of a pre party type of dinner or celebration dinner, in my opinion.

It is everything you think of when you watch tv shows like ""Sex and the City!"" It is modern, hip, refined, elegant and caters to the uppity 30 to 50 year old crowd. 

Everyone from the restaurant staff to customers were dressed to impress. I felt like I was in that movie ""Oceans 11"" with George Clooney..

I came with a party of 5 and we ordered several different steaks and side dishes, as well as wine and dessert.

Appetizers:

They give you this baked loaf of bread with parmesan and garlic sprinkled over the top. It comes with a dipping sauce of herb infused butter oil. It is really a tasty treat.


Salad: They have a great salad that comes with goat cheese, greens and balsamic vinegar drizzled over it. It is kind of a small salad, but it is quite tasty.


Entrees:

I ordered the 14 ounce filet steak that is cooked on the bone. My waiter recommended that its better to get the steak that is cooked on the bone, because the meat is more flavorful and juicy. When they serve the meat, it is deboned, and it is was very good. I ordered it medium and it came out and was super tender, but still dense and so it felt like a real steak and not just soft. It was very tasty and you can order a few sides with your meal.

My colleagues also ordered different steaks and they all enjoyed their various entrees. 

We ordered several different sides and I would rate them as the following:

Creamy Corn:  This was herb infused corn with creamy goodness. It had the texture of mashed potatoes, but it was a very robust corn flavor.

Jalapeno Cheese Grits:   Green Jalapeno pureed with melted cheese and infused into the grits. It had a spicy kick and it was pretty good.

Mushroom pot pie:    This is a great dish to order on the side. Its basically mushrooms saut√©ed with caramelized onions and cream sauce in a little pot pie. I enjoyed scooping out the mushrooms and drizzling them over my steak. The flavor combination was intense.


The wine list is pretty good and we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. I forgot which one, but the waiter said its very popular and you should buy this in a full bottle.


DESSERT:   They have a pistachio and strawberry cake that is baked on an almond and marzipan coated crust. It is served with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce and its AMAZING! It is very light and not too heavy and a great way to end your meal.


This is a pricy restaurant, but its worth visiting when you are in Vegas for a special dinner or night out with friends. One of the better Steakhouses in Las Vegas!",Cvvu2V_FO3FjxIHpartSMg,17,13,5,5TxKGW8OWwUOklPKF7SdyA

I think that our entire group was sold from the minute that we sat down. the place was hoppin.  The environment was like a party without any sort of craziness.  
As for the food, I had the wedge salad.  It had huge chunks of bleu cheese and bacon along with these funky pickled tomatoes.  It was really good.   I then went with the 16oz sirloin with shitake mushrooms on top.  I love red meat and this thing was massive!!  I felt like John Candy in ""Great Outdoors"" eating the Ole '96er.  Although I didnt finish the steak, i enjoyed every single bite.
As for the sides...we went with the truffle fries, mac/cheese, yukon potatoes and the sweet corn pudding.  I would have licked the bowl of the pudding, if allowed. Man, it was good.
After dinner, everyone was stuffed until Teddy introduced dessert.  Ok, get this...Sweet Potato doughnuts with maple glaze and crumbled walnuts.  I'm a foodie, and these were the most ridiculously good doughnuts we all ever had.  
Our bill for 8 with wine and cocktails AND gratuity came out to about $100 a person.  To me, that's a splurge but my wife and I would spend it again in a minute.  
There are a lot of fine restaurants in Vegas.  STK on an all around perspective could not have been a better dining experience for us.",alI6ZL3gvbNAYOvc2CnjYA,0,0,5,OrNvMua3o6sg9y478IaDwQ

Not only did he ask us for our names in the beginning, he called us by name all night. What a nice touch! I have never had a waiter/waitress do this. In addition to his great personality, he helped my friend order something that was gluten free.

We started with the Lil BGRs and they were delicious!! It comes with two, so it's a nice, small appetizer to share. For dinner, I ordered a special they had. It was a natural fllet mignon (I think that's the term they used) and it was oscar style. I also had to try the lobster mac and cheese because STK's twitter account said it was the most popular side dish. It was very good! I'm not big on seafood so I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I did. The only downside, it's not good as a leftover. I don't know if it was the plastic to go container or what but when I tried to have it later, it wasn't good and had a strong seafood smell to it.

Atmosphere is nice...dim and pretty. The design of the restaurant is actually what made me want to try the restaurant in the first place! My only complaint is how loud the music is.

The music was amazing I really like how STK switches there style of music as suppose many steakhouses that normally keep it down to one genre of music.

I ended up getting the bone in filet, which was cooked to a perfect medium rare and I topped it with foie gras which complimented the steak perfectly.  For desert, we got the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top, this was mouthwatering.  We also got the sweet potato donuts which was also really good.

The environment is loud with a dj spinning a pretty good mix of hip hop/top 40. Its not for the faint of ears. Then again, I arrived at 10PM when the music was at its loudest, it could burst both eardums.

I'll start with the worst parts and then the few good parts.

My second time here I ordered a Bone-in Rib eye medium rare.  It came back a tad on the rare side (in the middle), which I don't really mind.  But the main issue was an extreme amount of gristle.  I'm normally able to down even the tough parts of steaks.  Every single bite had something I could not get down.  Halfway through my steak, I gave up.  I did not complain or return my steak because I don't want to be that guy.  Instead I'll just learn my lesson and stop coming here.  2/4 of us had inedible steaks and the other 2 did have quite a bit of gristle, but not as bad.

My first time I ordered a filet mignon medium rare.  It came medium well and that is a no-go for me.

The good:

The buratta salad was delicious.  Obviously the heirloom tomatoes have amazing flavor and go well with the cheese.  I've had a few other appetizers and they were also very good.

So don't go here for a steak.  They don't have very many other options and I wouldn't be optimistic in trying them.  I would go to the Cut.",Aeo_U2fw7uSjSIhzkwUnXw,2,2,1,8T1KiwFD5A_KVB6ujURpIw

It was just one wow factor after the other. 

We ordered the bottle of champagne with fresh juice to have mimosas. You get to choose two Flavors. We had pixie which was pineapple, guava and oj as well as the pipe cleaner which was ginger, lemon and other juices ( sorry I forgot but both were refreshing and amazing! ) my entree was the steak and eggs ( perfect) while my friends ordered the rib scramble and the frittata.

Ordered their special of the night: Chilean Sea Bass (on a bed of porcini mushrooms and topped with shaved black truffle): So tasty! The Chilean sea bass was perfectly cooked and the bed of mushrooms were DELICIOUS. However, because of how flavorful the porcini was, the delicate truffle was lost. However, I was amazed by the sheer quantity of truffle. This dish was swimming in it. 

No meal is complete without sides:
*Mac & Cheese: I'm not sure what kind of cheese they use but it was more white/mild? Eh. Skip it. 
*Sweet Corn Pudding: People rave about this and I can see why. It's sweet, creamy and kind of like mashed potatoes! Probably not any healthier than mashed potatoes but still tasty
*Haricot Vert: Pretty standard but gotta get your greens in!

But seriously, if you're coming to STK, you should know that you'll be dropping $60+ a person. 
Steaks range from the smallest 8oz, maybe around $45 to upwards of $90 for a steak. But hey, it'll probably be the best steak, er, STK that you've ever had.

There's lots of buzz around STK in Vegas. It's Cosmo's gem! Perfect for a nice romantic date, also nice if your group of friends want to eat out and splurge a little. It's Vegas after all!

The sides are to die for, and can be quite pricey themselves. Well worth it, of course.

My recommendations are:
Tuna tartare
Mac n Cheese
Can't hurt with the greens too

All in all, you'll probably spend 5x more than a regular meal, but it's Vegas. Come here for fine dining at a top tier price. Simple as that - ENJOY!! 

Oh, and every time I've come, I've never had a reservation (party of 2-4) and was seated immediately.",G_eVitxNoQvdgT6qZG9nmA,3,8,5,wjO_-NFBobI8bgzBO95Sgw
1559814,2013-03-10,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Went here with several associates at work.  I was not impressed at all.

If I had to just rate the food, I would rate this a solid 4 Stars.  I ordered the Romaine Salad and a Braised Short Rib.  Well, they brought out the wrong salad.  Instead, I had a cottage cheese type of salad.  However, I have to say that the Braised Short Rib was EXCELLENT.  Let me say that again, the RIBS were EXCELLENT.  Just of note, Salad was $12, Ribs was $39 bucks, $10 for asparagas (?!!), and wine was another thing!  Ouch.

Now, why I gave it a 2 stars.  For a fine dining restaurant, it was not an intimate nor refine setting.  Rather, it felt like a rock concert where the guests are SQUEEZED into as many tables as possible.  The seats were soo uncomfortable.  Shoot... we felt like sardines crunched into our dining seat.  To put this into perspective, imagine the table next to you, you would be literally be 2-3 inches away from their elbow.  

Forget holding a conversation.  Many times, I just ended up yelling and screaming to try to communicate.  No wonder my waiter got my order wrong.  He could not hear me.   

Overall, it was a bad experience.  Food was good, service was average, environment was the pits.  For a fine dining experience where it is over $100 a person to dine (meal and wine), nah, I look for something better.

It's a phenomenal dining experience with the finest quality foods molded into divine creations with superb drinks and wonderful service. Props to Ashley!  I exclude the attitude of the hostess as her stilettos clearly were shoved too tightly up into her backside. 

The beef is incredibly tender and succulent, the crab and lobster meat are fresh and delicious, the heartiness of the short rib appetizer is overwhelming balanced well with a slightly sweet butternut squash risotto.  You can tailor your meat to perfect your taste including toppings like crab, lobster, foie gras, etc but I loved the jalape√±o onion. Sauces are only $2 but you don't need them, the meat is juicy and delicious on its own. Definitely get the corn pudding as a side. 

The ladies enjoyed many fine cocktails and my friend (total wine snob) and I had four different glasses of wine to complement our meals and tasted about 10 in between. 

We dined early at 6 on a Friday because we had show reservations at 930 and we left just around 845. I definitely recommend eating earlier because its less crowded and then as you're dining and drinking it gets packed with fantastic trendy music. It's on the louder side but definitely not too loud. We had a total blast. 

Overall, yea I dropped a $G at this place but the supreme dining experience that my guests and I totally loved made it totally worth it.

1569594,2011-07-12,4,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"The STK in Las Vegas is a close second to the STK in Miami. It is not as big as the Miami location, so the lounge/bar area is basically in the same area as the dining/eating area. 

Generally, the LV STK is fun on Mondays for Industry Night, but people don't usually eat. It's more of a drinking, social event. To mix it up, we came to the LV STK with a group of eight people at 11:00pm on a Saturday night. We had reservations and the restaurant was packed. 

It definitely has a fun, LOUD vibe, so if you're looking for a quiet romantic restaurant, this STK is not for you. Unless you come before the music gets loud. 

The hostess was fabulous, service was good, and the food was delicious.

Here is why I knocked it two stars:

1. There were middle-aged women dancing on top of the booths. That's fine in a nightclub, or even STK's lounge area, or even at someone else's booth who is ok with it, but they were dancing on top of our booth which was not ok. I was disgusted at the idea of sitting in the booth, while these women danced right where our heads were resting with their DIRTY, BARE FEET. Totally disgusting. I politely motioned to one of them and said ""Hi, this our table, we are sitting here"" with a smile. She looked at me and said ""So?!"" I was so surprised at this rude, middle-aged woman's response that I didn't know what to say for a moment. Luckily the hostess slid in and shooed them away, commenting how rude they were. Needless to say, it took a few cocktails for me to regain my appetite. If STK wants to promote a nightclub vibe do it where patrons won't be eating, or atleast impose some standards on who you will have up there dancing. Our party spent over $700 (food and alcohol) and for that money I don't want the experience of dirty, middle-aged Housewives-rejects dancing around my head as I eat.

2. I ordered the 7 oz. filet mignon medium-rare. It arrived nearly well-done. No pink whatsoever. However, to STK's credit, the server was immediately apologetic and when my second steak arrived it was perfect.",haSh72Q0MsQZUpWPeVgp0Q,6,5,3,iwRZsTZhs0cjzEzGkU1_gQ

We had the pear endive salad, beef tartare, bone in filet, and a few sides that I cant really recall. I'm not usually a big meat person but the bone in filet was melt in your mouth goodness!!! The pinot noir (forget the name) was excellent and the service was top notch. My water was never empty and the busboys came around often to check up on us. I was very happy with the service as I never had to call over the waiter for anything (def adds a star). 

Even though I had steak the night before and wasn't too excited about STK the following day, it definitely blew the previous night's dinner away.

We went for a friend's 30th birthday, and they were able to accommodate 9 of us in a booth at an oval table, which was great because we could all converse fairly well, until the club music was turned up around eight. 
Everyone already had drinks so we dove straight into the appetizers, we had the tuna tar tare (decent, had better in Dallas) and the hamachi (very fresh). For dinner I had the small skirt steak with the jalapeno onions on top, it was a little over seasoned especially considering I ordered a topper. Perfectly cooked though and was more than I could eat. My S.O. had the seared big eye tuna, which he thought would be a tuna steak, he was seriously disappointed with the eight small pieces of tuna that had half a cup of sauce on top. Not worth the price. Dessert was so so, but their cappuccino is amazing! Skip the desserts and have one of those instead!
Our server seemed very knowledgeable and was on top of everything all evening, and we were there 2.5 hours. The music got a little too loud for my taste, but all in all a good time.

However, i still have to give props because the manager allowed me to show our birthday boy the cake and let him blow the candles out. But was unable to serve my 300.00 cake . I was so angry, the manager could tell so he compensated my party of 14 free shots.

-We came here in a group of 7 people and got seated within 20 minutes.  We were all really excited for this restaurant even though we have one in LA.  We ordered several sides that were flavored really well.  The first was the creamy yukon potatoes, this was good, not too dry.  My favorite was the sweet corn pudding.  This was really flavorful and like the name says, sweet.  The mac and cheese was okay, this was nothing original so I would not recommend this really.  The mushroom pot pie was scrumptious, all my friends really liked it.  Enough to order a second one at least. 
-I had the medium filet which I wanted medium cooked and boy was this juicy and appetizing.  There's a reason why this place is known for their steaks!  I don't think any other place can make their steaks better than STK.  
-At the end of the meal, we each had an expresso shot.  Let me say this, their expresso kept me up all night!  Lol!  This was a great dining experience, so hope you get to enjoy this place!

Improvement:
-It took a little less than 20 minutes to seat up but preferably, since we made reservations, we wanted to be seated right away.

Tips:
-The bread they give you was delicious and soft, it came in this green dipping sauce that was really good.  Make sure to have a little of that before your big meal!
-The portions of the steaks were sized depending on what size you order but we shared a medium between two people and we were stuffed.",drzW920Yf74ydnfVVVThkw,3,1,4,HkBDEUWhGt4xgCGl8jgp8w

It was a party of 10 which we were in the private room.  with my meal I had the creamy corn and lobster Mac and cheese with the lobster thermadore. The Mac and cheese were completely burned tasting and the lobster wasn't as juicy tasting. The shrimp cocktail was pretty good. I felt bad telling anyone that I wasn't happy with my meal. We had so much of a good time laughing that I just didn't bother with it.  I did let my friend taste the Lobster Mac and cheese and indeed it was burnt. Didn't have the donuts which was more disappointing. 

Fast forward two days, I came again for a birthday party 9 of us total. We waited for an extremely long time but no one complained as it was more of catching up and trying to make the best of things. We were greeted and a deepest apologies along with the best service ever. We had the tuna tartare, spicy crab, shrimp cocktail. All amazing!!! Ginger mojito was pretty good if I do say so myself. 
Now for the dinner. Each had something different as the other two days ago, I did however let the server know about my service and he assured that it will not be the same. So I got the same dinner, lobster thermadore but the server mentioned that he will put everything on the side. I also ordered creamy corn and mushroom pot pie from the recommendation of the server. Of course the creamy corn is always delicious and oh my gosh the mushroom pot pie was sooo gooooood, that will be a new one for me. The lobster was so good and nothing like two days ago. Which was so weird as we had the chef come and greet us. But this meal was totally different from two days ago. Loved my dinner. We had everything from Delmonico,, tuna, filet, salmon, chicken. Everyone had different sides and funny thing someone had the lobster mac and cheese and I tried it again from the Vegas location and it was wayyy better than two days ago. Scooooooorrreee!!
Dessert, unfortunately they ran out of donuts but they let us get a run down of the other deserts many fail to see due to the yummy donuts. We had the flourless cake, strawberry shortcake, ice cream cookie and let me tell you. I will from now on order a desert even if they do not have donuts. Oh gosh I cannot tell you which was better as everyone was so good. I literally was asking everyone if they weren't going to finish their dessert. I had the liberty of getting the final bite. I will say definitely order each one if it's a big enough crowd as all are so good. 
I was so happy I decided to come back and give a second opinion to let you guys know that Vegas location is equally as fun as the other ones and just as yummy with an awesome staff.

Notable things on my last visit, their mashed potatoes and lobster mac and cheese side dishes were extremely yummy. I also really enjoyed their shrimp appetizer (I forget what it was called). I had the skirt steak and my boyfriend had the big eyed tuna. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly. The seared big eyed tuna was only good until we asked for some lemon slices and squeezed those onto it, then it was delicious too haha.

Service is great. Super attentive and helpful. Ask for anything and they'll probably bring it to you.

One star off though because both times that my boyfriend and I went, we went after 9pm and I guess it turns into some sort of club/restaurant place. I'm not a fan of extremely loud music playing while I'm eating that gets in the way of talking to the people I'm eating with. The waiter literally had to shout at us in order to be heard, which I think is just absurd. I'm all for a young, hip, and party atmosphere but I really think the music could be turned down just a little to make it a little easier to hear the people around you while you eat.",pnKfMfi9YLmBYz45G5rVjg,3,1,4,tHj1qCnOi1WI5VJSVABRDg

Some sides ok (we all dug on the sweet corn, mac and cheese was rather good as well.  Truffle fries kind of pathetic- tater tots, basically; asparagus meh.)

The real shitter- their wine is expensive as hell.  $17 for a glass of Justin Cabernet?  The cheapest bottle of red is $75?  Come on now, that's gouging.  

I don't mind dropping money on a quality steakhouse meal, but when the wine is ludicrously overpriced from the get-go, that's hard to overcome.  Because I like enjoying some fine red with my cut of carnivorosity.  

Plus, you can think me an old fart at the ripe age of 36, but steakhouses are best (in my opinion) when they are classic, old-school types.  Some Frank or Dean playing in the background, leather booths, gin and tonics before the meal, etc.  

Techno music?  Cosmopolitans?  I get it, the Cosmo resort is trying awfully hard for the young hipster vibe, and yes, some of those kids have some serious money to blow.  I guess you need a place like that for ""those people.""  I had a decent meal, paid way too much for it- mostly due to the wine-, and can cross this place off the list forever as ""not my scene.""

Bread with blue cheese butter and chive oil - 4.5 stars - really enjoyed this dish.  Large load of bread crisp on the outside but very soft in the inside.  Just a hint if blue cheese flavor in the butter.  Delish!

Cucumber Stiletto - 4 stars - very good fresh light drink!
Butternut squash risotto - 4 stars - this dish had a lot of complex flavors. Short rib and risotto was cooked nicely.  The flavors in the sauce on short ribs prevailed over the butternut squash.  The short rib sauce is a veal reduction with red wine and a strong nutmeg finish.  
Crab ravioli - 3.5 to 4 stars -pasta was perfectly cooked, sauce was light.  A very delicate dish.  The taste of crab was almost lost. Adding a touch more crab would perfect this dish.
Burrata - 3 stars - burrata itself was amazing but bread was too soft and dish would have beed better with fresh tomatoes and olives rather than a tapenade 
Corn pudding - 4 stars - super corn delicious!  But I LOVE corn!
Bok choy - 3 stars
Haricot vert - table said 4 stars.  I didn't try them
1/2 lobster - 4 stars - just slightly over cooked but really ever so slightly
Filet w/ bacon butter - 4 stars - this filet was cooked perfectly to medium rare as requested.  Nice and tender. Add
Truffles fries - 4.5 stars - I normally do not like thick fries but these were really really good!

Other things ordered at our tables caesar salad, iceberg salad, sole, skirt steak, Brussels sprouts and tuna.  I did not try these dishes but table consensus was salads were very good but Brussels sprouts and entrees were all just ok and no one would order them again.

We ended the night with a fire ball shot (who's idea was that?) and the bread pudding!  The bread pudding is not traditional.  It is more like a cake.. definitely not as dense as normal bread pudding.  I like the captain crunch pieces as the added a little extra something something!

Amy was our server and she was excellent!  Service overall was impressive!

Unfortunately, I probably won't come here again as it is just too noisy and you have to know what to order to really enjoy your meal.

The truffle french fried Parm sounds amazing, but really wasn't that good at all.  They might have only put tiny tiny tiny bit of truffle, can't even smell it.. :P

1688237,2012-08-21,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"This was a very nice steak house with a live DJ playing music. The place had a classic dark feel, but the   energy was much livelier and younger. It was a perfect fit for the Cosmopolitan hotel (modern, romantic, and young). I would go back to this steak house. 

The order was:
* Complimentary dinner rolls (5 of 5). I loved their free dinner rolls. Five dough balls were baked together in a small dutch-oven looking little pot. It was fresh and tasted like Hawaiian bread. It was paired with a green butter sauce. I think the sauce was made from green onion or chives. It had a strong green taste, but it was delicious with the fresh dinner rolls. It was a great start to the steak dinner.
* Tuna tartare (3 of 5) $19 on corn tuille - pecans - avocado. Very fresh tuna tartare on top of a chip. The chip was big enough to hold the tuna tartare, but we had to break it apart to eat it. I am not a fan using a chip to hold tuna tartare. I think it is messy and makes the dish hard to share.
* Foie gras french toast (3.5 of 5) $24 green apple - almond brioche - sherry gastrique. Tasty, but a little heavy on the syrup. I would also have enjoyed it more, if they considered slicing the apples thinner.  The apples were presented as two chunks and I thought it would have been prettier and easier to eat with the foie gras if it was sliced thinner. I typically think that foie gras appetizers are like pieces of artwork. If you mix and match what is given to you, it enhances the foie gras taste. 
* Hamachi (3 of 5) $16 jalapenos - pear vinaigrette. Fresh, and taste was not memorable. I expected more from the four slices of hamachi.
* filet 10 oz. (4 of 5) $48 - Tasty and juicy. Nice cut and cooked perfectly to medium rare. No complaints, but at the end, the rib steak was tastier because of the fat content.
* bone-in rib steak 20 oz. (4 of 5) $49 - Tasty and the bone was so small, it was almost like boneless. This was tasty and juicy.   
* add on topping foie gras (5 of 5) $15 - What a bang for the buck! This is probably the cheapest add on foie gras price ever and it was a huge piece. Delicious!!!
* add on side raw horseradish $2 - We were slightly disappointed that the menu asked for $2 for raw horseradish. Nonetheless, we had to order it.

1690081,2012-07-05,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"This is my top restaurant experience in Vegas.  I get to Vegas twice a month and stop in here for dinner almost every time.  I range from eating in the bar to private dining room with big groups to traditional seating.

The people that work there are outstanding.  While the girls at the front desk can be a bit flighty (don't judge the first impression), the management, bartenders,  and the servers are exceptional.  

Start with an icy cold ketel martini or a moscow mule served in a copper mug at one of the two bars.  The scenery and people watching is generally off the hook.  The DJ, situated in the middle of the restaurant, plays a solid variety and keeps the energy level up.

The warm bread and green dipping sauce is sinful.  The Shellfish Platter comes in many sizes and has never let me down.  The entire menu can be relatively healthy and is not weighted down with butter and sauces but has great taste and flavor.  The tuna tartare, hamachi,  and shrimp rice krispies are my other go to starters.

For entrees, my fave by far is the filet prepared Pittsburgh Style.  Genius simple preparation and flavor every time.  Back this with broccolini, brussel sprouts and creamed spinach (again, solid ingredients but not buried in other sauces and concoctions).  Last few times, they have been bringing trays of their 8 steak sauces for sampling which have quite a variety.

If you like a cocktail, be sure to sample the Jalapeno shot.  Not on the menu but a mind boggling smoky infused gin beverage.  Terrific and reasonable wine list as well.

We do not drink alcohol and we were pretty hungry so we asked for 2 non-alcoholic drinks and entrees with 2 side dishes and its famous sauces. HE TOTALLY LOOKED DOWN ON US.

If I am hungry, I will order a lot but if I am not, why should I just order food and look rich? We were offered with Blue cheese bread which was pretty good but my skirt steak was not the greatest.

I  personally loved it. 

If you are an absolute steak fanatic, STK might seem overated, you could probably argue that for the same money or cheaper, you can get the same thing in (insert your city here) easy. The steak was good, however, and the sides were even better. Not the usual potatoes. 

If you are into formal service ""Good afternoon sir"", white linens, traditional service that comes with steak houses, this is not the best place for you. The waitstaff here are awfully contemporary /modern, not informal or casual like quacky and annoying, just..contemporary and unfussy for what is normally associated with pricey steakhouses. They have a way of putting you at ease.

If you are into atmosphere - this is the place to go. Its like a club with steak on the side. The music is pretty much like Marquee, Top 40 messed up into electronic, the DJ plays Loud, libations are good all around, and you get pumped up without having to go to a club if thats your thing.

There are no cheap restaurants in the Cosmopolitan, in my opinion, so you're dropping at least $50 a person before tax any which way. Most people would edge toward $100 per person after all said and done. A small steak and a drink for two people ran $150 after tax and tip at this place. Was it worth it?

We started off with the crispy lobster tails, burrata salad and beef carpaccio. The lobster tails came with an excellent chili sauce that really gave off some good heat. The burrata salad was just as delicious as the last time I had it. The carpaccio and pesto noodles were my favorite. So tender and flavorful, the beef practically melted in your mouth. 

For mains, my husband and one of our friends each had the 16oz sirloin while myself and our other friend each had filets-mine the 6oz and hers the 10oz.

Great char on the outside and perfect temp on the inside but not as tender as I would have liked or expected. I would skip that next time and try one of the other entrees.  I will say the horseradish sauce and STK bold sauce were both amazing. Not overwhelming on the heat but just enough kick to wake you up. 

For sides we ordered the mushrooms, yukon mashed, truffle fries, and the corn pudding. Overall, the sides were just an afterthought to me. I wasn't blown away by any of them and the mushrooms were incredibly salty this time. The mashed would've benefited from some salt and pepper or garlic. Our friends enjoyed the corn and fries but neither of them were impressed. I would definitely still recommend the jalapeno grits and I wish I had just gotten them instead. 

After all this food, somehow we managed to order dessert. The table split the freshly baked cookie and sweet potato doughnuts. I didn't even get to take pictures of either of these dishes because my tablemates literally inhaled them both. I was able to steal a few bites of each and I can absolutely attest to them both being incredible. The cookie was so soft and just barely baked so it retained some of that raw cooke dough flavor in the middle. The doughnuts, which are something I never in a million years would have thought that I'd like, were beyond delicious. Moist with a beautiful glaze and accompanied by a silky smooth quenelle of ice cream. The perfect pairing if there ever was one. 

While there were just a few let downs this time, I'm so glad we gave STK another try. Impeccable service and excellent food really combine to make the full experience here. I would definitely stop by here the next time I'm in town (if only to have more of those doughnuts!).",u5GWCAWE9jGgOuqXnonxOQ,0,0,5,A6dFnwL6Munimqb1mFtjXw

FOOD
- the bread (what's in it other than buttery heaven?):  I could've had this all night!
- the appetizers/sides: the brussel sprouts, mac & cheese, beef tartare and pumkin ravioli were all devine!
- sole is one of the few fish options on the menu. It was cooked very well and filling - but it didn't leave a great impression on my like the appetizers/sides did!  

SERVICE
Our waiter was on point and this definitely takes a different feel from the traditional white napkin steakhouse.  

VIBE
This place is even better with a group!  This hip, modern, trendy place gets packed quick!  The DJ starts rocking at 8pm (you'll hear some top 40 mixed in with house).

Service was prompt and friendly. Food was delicious and semi-creative, for a steakhouse. (I'm looking at you jalape√±o grits.)

 We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and grabbed some wine at the bar. I don't know why I was shocked at the prices given the location, but I still was. The markup here is downright awful. So if you want to imbibe, be prepared to pay a very high bill. Food was the typical high-end steakhouse on the strip pricing. Although, I did not feel as taken advantage of as I did with the drinks.

I ordered the Market Fish which was risotto with sea scallops topped with caviar (bougie, I know.) Along with that we ordered a few sides, a necessary evil. We got the mac & cheese (which can be prepared truffled or with lobster), the jalape√±o grits, and the broccolini. All were good decisions. The jalape√±o grits stood out to me as being the most original AND delicious. If I could eat a trendy, mini-cast iron of them every night, I'd be living the dream. My entree was decadent and rich. I ALWAYS order scallops if offered to me and I was not let down. Sadly they aren't a permanent item on the menu, although I think they should be. 

I docked a star for the alcohol prices, but mainly for the environment. WARNING: Grandma rant. It was way too loud. Now, I understand that we are on the strip, and it's evening, but it's a Tuesday night. Get it together. If it were the weekend, or even a Thursday I would understand the club-vibe.

As a steak place I was expecting more or the very least a good piece of meat. The cowboy steak was disappointing. It was peppered with cartilage. It paled in comparison to any I've eaten in the past. Anywhere. Yup.

A group of us came for my birthday dinner. It was a fun night and a fun atmosphere. 

The service and the rest of our food were awesome! It was just strange to have a mediocre meat from a purportedly steak place. Especially the cowboy at $95 for a 34oz steak. 

We shared everything. Their martinis are great. Their lobster mac stood out. Oysters so fresh. Their Burrata! Get this! Their Beef tartare is one of their weakest link too. Lacking in flavor. 

Otherwise their service was fast and we never lack for anything. As busy as the place was we were attended to well!

In fact, we actually had reservations for 7:30pm, we called to move it back to 8:30pm and they gladly accommodated that request.  Well, we called again to have the reservation moved back once again and that was accommodated as well, with no hesitation.  To make this short, we called again and ended up with reservations for 10:30pm.

Upon our arrival we were promptly taken to our table and the server immediately asked whose birthday it was.  I know it isn't much, but that little attention to detail from the notes in my reservation was pretty awesome.  Most places actually never catch that.

Now on to the food.  I had the 7oz Filet Mignon with Truffle butter and it was delicious.  The steak literally melted in my mouth, and the fact that I like my meat very, very well done says a lot.  Their creamy Yukon Potatoes we also on point and very tasty, however, their truffle fries were pretty bad.

Yes, it's a loud environment but if you're getting a bite to eat before heading over to Marquee, it's a great way to start the night.

The waiter was nice but he was doing a bit of the upsell (which is rather typical for Vegas anyway).  If you keep an eye on your budget, it will be expensive but not outrageously so.

We drank good old Las Vegas tap water, shared a bunch of appetizers and sides, didn't go with any of the expensive appetizers such as the seafood tower (something like $40/person?), etc.

The steak was great.  I generally eat a lot but at steakhouses, I like to try a lot of appetizers and side dishes and usually get really full about halfway through my steak so STK is great in that they have small, medium, and large steaks.  Yeah, the small steaks (i.e. the 7 oz filet that I got) is usually for girls but oh well.

We had a group of 10 and they were able to accomodate us in one of the private dining rooms.  It was excellent and allowed for table conversation.  I was celebrating my birthday so it was a great room for that.

With lots of drinks flowing, and everyone eating steak, sides, dessert, etc...the bill came out to roughly $150/head.  Not cheap but it would have been double that if we had gone with all of the waiter's recommendations.

Anyway, great place and an awesome way to start a night in Vegas!

The two who did not have steak thought the meal was good, not great. And the remaining 3 who did not get overcooked steak, had a great, great meal.

The appetizers and salads were nothing to write home about and I would honestly suggest skipping them. They fill you up, cost more than they should (seriously, it shouldn't cost $15+ to simply cut a head of lettuce in half, that's crazy).

I got the skirt steak which was fantastic. It was a LOT of steak, when it comes out and you see those two lengthy strips lying next to each other you think you'll never finish that much steak. But, I have to say, mine was just soooo damn good. Full of flavor, cooked well and after each bite I found myself savoring for the next one. I would definitely go back just for the skirt steak. 
The sides we got were fine, mac and cheese probably the best of them, but simply what you'd expect.

We didn't get dessert, opting for some shots instead. The shots were watered down which was honestly totally unnecessary and disappointing.

I rarely do this, but I have to say, the atmosphere at STK is simply incredible. Really sets the mood for the rest of the night.

Meat was one of the best quality I've ever had. Drinks superb! Have the spark plugs-little zip to get the night goin. Finally the service and ambiance. Wow! This place leaves you with the best experience. The manager came over multiple times to make sure we were good. Only complaint I could think of was that I can't come every day to this place. Definitely a top tier must go to restaurant to check out while in Las Vegas.

Nothing memorable especially for $80 piece of meat laden with gristle and A la carte, I could say I was expecting much better quality cut of beef. Steak had lots of gristle and chunks of fat, not palatable at all. It was also served with two different sauces. That should have been the red flag. No self-respecting steak house who claims to serve top quality cuts needs to serve sauce. The meat should speak for itself.

Bread was really good. Had a hint of butter and blue cheese and was a great way to mop up the juices.

For the sides got a creamed corn and mashed potatoes. Nothing fancy or memorable.

Overall dining experience was ok.

For the price I would much rather spend it at a better steak house.",DX8QajU6qK76ooaHvdehbA,0,0,3,lnZIE92tGk1138bGYi_h7A

The steak was too charred for my taste, so it felt over-powering and I couldn't really enjoy the tenderness or quality of the beef.  I was at Flemings a few weeks earlier and actually enjoyed their steak a lot more.  

I came with a large group and we tried practically all the appetizers and sides.  The favorites of the night were the beef tartare, pork belly, and mac & cheese.  Everything else was bleh.  I didn't come to the steakhouse to eat sides and appetizers though, so the steak was the biggest let down.  The cocktails are pretty strong.  I had a strawberry cobbler, which is very martini like and definitely left me buzzed at the end of dinner!

We were at STK this past weekend for an engagement celebration.  The staff was so nice and so accomodating!!!  The food is mostly very good!!!  I know this is a steak house, but I am not a steak fan so I opted for the Dover Sole...I thought it was a little overcooked.  However, that was the only thing I didn't care for!!!  We ordered tons of appetizers and sides...hamburger sliders, shrimp rice krispy thingys, crab salad, some sort of roll thing, sweet corn, macaroni, mushrooms, and a couple that I am forgetting!!!  The macaroni is my FAVORITE!!!  I think I ate a whole one myself!!!  They brought out a congratulatory lava cake that we all shared...very good, as well!!!

Now for our meal we started out with a cold fish platter consisting of oysters on the half shell shrimp ceviche alaskan King crab and clams on the half shell (little necks) The presentation was very nice the Alaskan King crab all cracked open for you,the drinks from the bar were very good and they served us within 15 minutes remember we were 18 people, Now to the main course I had a peppercorn crusted bone in ribeye 24 ounce I received my steak and it was prepared just the way I like my steak medium rare! My wife ordered Chilean sea bass which was excellent! The parmesan fries is a must-have!! Also the corn pudding if you don't have it you will definitely regret it!The prices are a little on the high side but that's what you expect in a good steakhouse and this is a good steakhouse!

47 dollars for a sirloin steak that was probably equall in taste to a steak on the chain restaurant longhorn or outback steakhouses menu. Way overpriced, but i guess thats what you get in a vegas. nothing comes with that 47 dollar steak either, everything is all a la-cart so you can rack up that bill even more. at 10+ dollars per appetizer and 10+ dollars for deserts, side salads and drinks, you will be way over 100$ per person in no time. sad because its NOT worth it, but since its in vegas and in a nice hotel, people Will pay for it.

Our waitress was lovely, and even though the DJ was blasting amazing music, she managed to give everyone attention and spend time reviewing our options.
The petite filet was the perfect size and the best quality steak I've ever had. Better than most famous steakhouses in NYC.
Then the chef came over and gave us a complimentary plate of king crab legs, which must have been cooked with butter and some kind of illegal drugs because it was the best thing I've ever tasted in my life.

I have one complaint: My boyfriend ordered a GLASS of house red wine. $21?! For house?! That's ridiculous. My vodka drink was $18, which is steep but marginally understandable. But $21 for a glass of house wine? Screw that.

The food is very, very good. Interesting menu choices, prepared with care.  And the service matches the expertise in the kitchen - knowledgeable, attentive, and professional.

I ordered steak with the bleu butter. Yum-my. And my heirloom tomato salad that preceded it was fresh and delicious. Our table of four split two desserts. Each were excellent.

I struggled with the wine list though, in that wines that I normally bypass as ""not good enough"" cost more per glass than I would normally pay for a bottle. I had a hard time justifying the expense of most of them, eventually settling on a $80 Malbec, which may have been the least expensive of the lot.

The dj and his music selections help keep STK moving. He's responsible for a lot of the ambiance of the place but the loud music did make dinner conversation tough.

What to Love:
_DJ keeps the party going. Ever fear that your day buzz will die at a nice Vegas dinner? STK DJ keeps it going with an awesome playlist.
_Our server was a delight. We had to be out at a certain time to get to a show and he was on point with the timing. Also very friendly and helpful with a large group. We also had to do one separate bill and it was handled seamlessly.
_Food: Scallops and Steak Tartare we DELICIOUS. As were the Kushi oysters. They tend to be one of my favs anyway and the quality here was fantastic.

What could be better:
_Despite a reservation and our entire group arriving we still had to stand around for 5 minutes. With 11 people in our reso it crowded the bar area since many other parties had to pass by us and clearly there were many empty tables around us. It made for an awkward start to the evening as you then also had 11 people trying to order drinks at the bar.
_My filet :( Now, granted, I was eating a mountain of other appetizers with others, so I opted to split the 6oz filet with a friend so I could save room for drinks. When my filet arrived it definitely was not medium rare. They very handily split it for us, but my guess is it sat under a warmer for a bit while other food was finishing and thus overcooked/dried out which happened quickly since it wa sonly 6oz and it was cut in half. Normally if my steak arrives overdone I would bring it up to the server, but since we were on a time crunch I didn't have time to send it back.

We had a superb waitress, Jax. She knew the menu very well and was very helpful!

The food was excellent!!! Even though I like my steak well done, it just melted in my mouth. Although their truffle fries were not the best I've ever had (that's not what she said, lol), the creamy yukon potatoes made up for it.

Long story short, the hostess made every attempt on getting us to leave. Our reservation which was made 2 weeks prior wasn't honored, we were shuffled around the dinning area because the hostess confused two groups, one of 4 other of 5 (our group and the other only had one thing in common). They seat us at a bar table. This was my best friends 40th birthday, which I noted on the reservation... I've sat at the bar for many years with 40 years plus on this earth, I couldn't stand for it!!  

After my complaint, they then seat us in the back by the kitchen. The waiter was witty so we decided to stay... We order, receive our food - all of it was cold and had to be sent back (at this point we hoped for the best, but really should've left). It was so bad that one person in the party just opted not to eat. (Very sad face)

The waiter was great (sorry didn't catch his name) ...we really appreciated him for making up for the hostesses many attempts on trying to get us to leave.

Our awesome waiter informed me that they could accommodate me and the kitchen prepared an INCREDIBLE veggie dish of broccolini, asparagus, carrots, and marinated mushrooms.  I know it may not sound like much, but it was delicious!!!  They even hooked me up with sorbet for dessert!

  We came there to celebrate privately as it was my wife's Bday .. We started out with drinks and appetizers .. Torn between the risotto or king crab we went with the king crab legs .. We requested it to be steamed w/ melted butter .. Portion was so so,  but the intense fishiness we tasted from one of the legs was no good .. I asked prior as to how fresh their seafood  was and was told that it was flown in daily fresh ..   My wife received the worst of it as the crab leg left her  nauseated  and unable to finish the rest her meal ..  The service was impeccable .. They were very attentive and replaced the appetizer with a short rib ravioli that was excellent ..   I decided to go large and order the Delmonico steak ..  It was cooked medium rare as requested and the lobster topping was excellent no fishiness and fresh ..  What I was surprised was that a good portion of my steak was inedible as it was too tough to cut and very fatty. 

They did not charge us for the ravioli do to the crab legs issue and were nice enough to provide us each w/ bday desserts but my wife's nausea was overwhelming leaving her unable to finish her glass of champagne and crippled her for the evening ..

I made a reservation for a team event (12 people) and requested a private room.  Upon arrival to the restaurant, on time, we were told that we wouldn't be getting a private room, no big deal, but also that it would be a bit of a wait.  So, we waited 45 minutes, and we were finally seated in the bar area, which is like a nightclub essentially, due to the volume of the music and the small high-top tables.  I did ask the hostess for a more quiet table further back from the opening, but I was told that wasn't an option.  Still no big deal, we were having a good time to that point.

We proceeded through the meal, had many cocktails, wine, apps, dinner, etc.  It was serviceable, not great, especially for the price, but hey, you're in Vegas and things are overpriced.  This is where it turned from an ok time due to the company (nothing restaurant related) to indescribable.  When it came time to order dessert, we were told that we needed to hurry as they were closing soon.  So, I ordered an espresso, several team members ordered a dessert and coffee.  As they arrived, we were told we had 2 minutes to eat and go and I was presented with the check and asked to pay it immediately.  I asked to finish my espresso and the server huffed and stood over me while I drank it.  I handed her my card, and she asked if we could get up and she would bring me my check at the door.  No one finished their dessert, and we were ushered out while still trying to grab jackets, belongings, etc.  BTW, there were still people at other tables in the restaurant.  I paid the tab, with 0 gratuity, which is what was deserved for the way we were treated throughout the evening, and I asked to talk to a manager.  I was told there were no managers on duty at this time.

Here's where it gets even better, the restaurant has charged my card for an additional $400 that I didn't authorize, essentially forcing the gratuity onto me even though the receipt I have signed clearly shows $0.  I have called the restaurant over a dozen times, each time a manager is not available, I have provide the receipt multiple times and cannot get a single returned call from a manager.

I have disputed this charge with Amex 3 times now, with the restaurant calling them back and providing false claims to try to keep the charge.  In the latest round they sent Amex a receipt with my signature showing the amount I actually paid, but then stuck an itemized receipt with gratuity, making it look like I actually signed the receipt with the higher amount.  This is what is known as fraud!  The fight will continue until STK does the right thing.

Obviously I will never return to this establishment again, and while I am not the type of person to fight this type of battle over social media and/or the internet, I don't want anyone else to receive this type of service while at dinner or after...",QYKyyE_dvN9u4W2dC7M5Tg,6,0,1,KkR6YuU1GLLZNSBKLRS1aw

While visiting over this past Labor Day weekend, a few friends and I decided to give STK a try.

Stymied in deciding what to eat for dinner one day, we went online and found out it was actually Restaurant Week in Las Vegas the weekend we were there.

After going through the list of participating restaurants, one of my friends indicated that he always wanted to try STK and that he only heard good things about it.

We then made a reservation for four and actually planned the rest of our day in getting there on time.

We were split during the good part of the day, but as the reservation time approached, we started arriving at the Cosmopolitan to go upstairs to the restaurant.

The service was very professional and it was good to see waiters who can joke around, make good recommendations and still be attentive.

The funny thing was that I asked the hostess for a Restaurant Week menu all around, but after glancing at the actual dinner menu, we abandoned that pre-fixed menu pretty quickly and went all out.

I ended up getting some filet medallions with bleu cheese spread, and others had the prime rib. Though the portions were on the smaller size (definitely not Lawry's or Mastro's sized), it was well made and actually left you wanting more...which is probably the whole idea behind the smaller portions anyway.

The brought out our sides on ironcast bowls, which helped keep things hot. The mashed potatoes were really whipped well...to the point of it being almost a thick liquid. It was buttered, which was nice.

One of the items we got was foie gras to be spread over slices of baguette. I've had foie gras sparingly, but I have to admit that that was pretty good. Good smooth texture and a crunchy bread created a nice combination. It gives that duck-ish aftertaste, but I recommend it, if you don't really mind that. This was one of the better instances of it, and I'm disappointed that California will be placing a ban on serving the delicacy. I suppose I can only really have it if I go back to Las Vegas in the future (which happens often enough, I guess).

The truffle mac and cheese was okay. I actually used it to clear the palate. It was definitely cheesy, but I felt it lacked a bit of salt or richness.

For such a classy steakhouse, being in Las Vegas does have its downside. The highlight of the evening had to be leaving STK. As the four of us were walking out, right outside the restaurant was a dude dressed up in only his boxer shorts. Nothing else. I could tell the mater d' and the host staff wanted to say something to the man, like GTFO, but since he wasn't technically inside STK (just outside of it), they couldn't do anything. It was just such a contrast to have this pretty much naked man greeting the well-heeled people entering and leaving the place.",CtT0To4GaUdTJ7MhojlW4g,2,1,4,1EDoGRv0cvnCqoCIZ0dDhg

I'm staying at The Aria, my wife the entire day is saying it's not too late to change the reservation to Jean George...  No! The reason I chose STK is the club vibe. I want to have a Vegas fun feeling, sipping cocktails while nom'ing on a Porterhouse for two. I can get Jean George back in NYC, let's rock it tonite!

We walk in, I see the DJ booth. The DJ, she's rockin' the vibe. It's dark and sultry. We order our drinks. My wife orders a beet salad split for us both (I wanted the Caesar) many different kinds of beets. STK sexy beets. Oh baby.

Porterhouse for two is ordered along with Brussel Sprouts mixed with the best bacon in the world, Nueske bacon. STK sexy bacon. Yukon Gold mashed potatoes as well. I forgot we're in a hotel and can't bring it back to the house. STK sexy mistake.

Now here's where things snap me out of the vibe:
*$16* for steak sauces?! I know it's dark and I'm buzzed. Are you folks high with those prices? I figured, the natural juices will be enough and I'll keep my $16 bucks. It needed sauce.... there were no extra juices from the meat

*One* bathroom?! In a club? Those Brussel Sprouts left me gassy, I had to let one rip in the worst way. I had to wait on a line.... uncool

This is also a club, there's no dress code or security?? I'm from New York visiting the hottest hotel on the strip. My wife is wearing a smokin' dress and I have a suit on. I see a schmuck in shorts and flip flops?? I wanted to tackle him while security tossed him out. There's an STK Orlando, I'm sure some tourist will walk in wearing a Mickey tee shirt, it's kind of expected. I bet STK NYC doesn't put up with this BS. Hey, I spent over $250 on dinner, have a damn dress code.

It would have been nice to bring home leftovers but we're on vacation. I ordered too much food, I could of left off the mashed potatoes. Our waiter was awesome, he knew it was our anniversary and sent over a small dessert we shared.

Loud, trendy, and hip would be the best adjectives to use when describing the ambiance at STK. A DJ spins music from the 80s, to hip hop, to EDM, so if you're looking for someplace quiet and romantic, this isn't it! However, it's a fun place if you're starting off your night and want to get the party started at dinner. Just be prepared to speak loudly to your fellow diners!

Aside from the atmosphere, STK is a pretty traditional steakhouse in service, food, and presentation. Our server was pleasant and professional, showing a remarkable grasp of the menu and specials. However, there were a few small glitches in service. The first,  when we received an appetizer we didn't order.

The food itself was very good, but not perfect. The complimentary bread had good flavor (it was brushed with blue cheese), but not soft enough for my taste. Our appetizers, the burrata and the scallops dish, were delicious though. The tomatoes were fresh and sweet, the cheese a great compliment. The scallops were meaty and tasty. 

However, I was a bit disappointed with the steaks. I ordered the ribeye, medium rare, and it was definitely medium, if not medium well, throughout most of it, being just a light pink instead of the dark pink to red of medium rare. My dining companion ordered the filet, medium, and his was obviously medium rare to rare, so I think the orders must have gotten mixed up. (Second service glitch)

The lobster Mac and cheese was yummy, with big chunks of lobster throughout, and the bananas foster cheesecake was a sweet and tasty end to the meal.

Of course, this decadence is not for the light of wallet. I got a glimpse of the bill -around $350 for 2 cocktails, 2 glasses of wine, 2 apps, the 2 steaks, 1 side dish, and 2 desserts.

All in all, a fun steakhouse, and a good meal, but I think I prefer the traditional approach, especially since perhaps all of the noise affected the service slightly. But if partying with a mouth full of meat is your style- party on!",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,8,2,4,ks2TWLiLMuelMfIug6S45g

We had such a great experience here during the grand opening that we decided to go back a week later with a friend visiting from out of town.  The experience was not as great.  Here is the low down:

HOST STAFF:  Clueless.
We made reservations a few days in advance and asked to sit with our server from our first visit.  On the night of our dinner we arrived 20 minutes early to see plenty of open tables but the hostess was absolutely clueless on what to do with us.  Uh, seat us maybe?  We gave her a break and decided to sit in the lounge for a drink while she sorted it out but after 30 minutes (10 minutes after our reservation) we never got approached about our table (except for the wrong name - ""Are you Mr. Kluss""?) and so we had to go back up to the stand to find out what was going on with the delay.  The hostess seemed like she was making an excuse up (similar to lost homework judging from her age) as to why our table still wasn't ready and so we ended up having to talk to another hostess to get it right.  When they finally went to sit us down it wasn't in the servers area we had twice requested (once during our reservation a week before and once when we arrived).  When we let her know of the mistake the hostess seating us (a different one) made some rude remark about how 'messed up' things were here and sat us down in the section we requested.  Not a good tee-off to a $260 dinner for 3.

DINNER: Too slow and with mistakes.
The best part of dinner was the demeanor from or original server.  She was a real pro and as cool as we remembered the first time but seemed to be hamstrung by the slow kitchen service and a few lapses in attention to detail from there - missing or slow items she had to notice and then retrieve.  I'm no stranger to fine dining and a slow pace is nice but It took a good 40 minutes just to get our apps - thats too long.  Overall the food was just ""okay"" for as long as we waited and for the price.  I've been much more impressed at half a dozen other steakhouses in town (The Palm @ Caesars, Capital Grill, Ruths Chris's, Del Friscos, Flemings etc).  Really surprised too that the cocktails were made so inconsistently (in taste) because how complicated is a cocktail?  It was so left to right that we had to keep saying something to the point that the server felt bad enough to finally bring us an extra (right) one for free.

SUMMARY:
Like the other reviewer our trouble started with the front host staff and unfortunately continued with slow service.  As native Las Vegans we like the Cosmo a lot as far as hotels go and may give STK another shot after we've tried the other restaurants at the hotel first.  The layout is great, the decor, the music and the overall vibe are solid too but as far as service goes and food that blows you away goes - maybe they just have opening week issues.

We always go to the Cosmopolitan and blindly search for a restaurant. I say this because, there are so many incredible options there that you really can't go wrong. We decided on STK because we were all in the mood for some good old-fashioned, American steak dinners. The ambience is so cool there. You automatically feel like a trendy 20-year-old when you walk in. All of the servers look like high fashion supermodels, it's playing the latest pop music, and The light scheme and overall ambience really adds to the trendy mood. Now, to the food. They serve you a delicious bread bun, with pesto sauce. There are a lot of great food options, but you can't go to Italy and not eat pasta, or go to France and not eat cheese, or go to America and not eat a steak... Get my point? Get the steak! Literally any one of them will be amazing. We got the ribeye and his parents got The fillet. We drank a fancy glass of Italian wine and also shared the Barada salad. As you can tell by my recent Yelp posts, I'm really into Burrata salad lately. The service was great, the only hiccup is that my wineglass had lipstick prints on it. Our server seemed embarrassed about that and got it taken care of right away. Of course, it was an expensive dinner, but we were celebrating and on vacation.

As such, STK was never high on my list of places to eat in Vegas.  I ended up going for a business dinner and was generally pleased, even for my steak-averse palate.

Pros
*The appetizers were amazing.  Hands down.  Everything we ordered was fantastic and they actually gave us the appropriate number of items based on the people at the table (might have been coincidence but I'll give them the point)
*The music selection was late 90's and early 2000's that reminded me of days gone by.  It was not what you normally hear at a club or a restaurant so it was a fun change of pace
*The drinks were fantastic and we were always asked about a fresh one before our glasses were empty
*The steak!  I know!  I said it.  It was a pretty good steak.  I only had a few bites of someone else's but it was the complete opposite of where my mind goes when I think about steak.

So far this review has been high-fives and kudos.  But that two star rating up there, that wasn't a mistake.  Every cloud has its silver lining, and at STK there were plenty of dark clouds to go with those small positive notes.

Cons
*The volume of the music is insane.  It started out manageable but we were basically shouting at each other by the time we left
*The drink I ordered was $18, and that seemed to be about average
*The sides were hit or miss.  Asparagus was cold but the truffle fries were like pillows of potatoey goodness.  The gratin was basically raw potatoes but the mushroom pot pie was flavorful, hot, and exotic tasting
*The service.  Our waiter was great.  Friendly, outgoing, ready to make recommendations.  Unfortunately, after he took our order he was gone and never to be seen again.  Instead we ended up with a loitering busser.  

As I mentioned earlier, this was a business dinner.  We were there to eat, of course, but we were also talking and enjoying our evening.  I guess we took too long to finish our appetizers because the server asked us no less than three times if he could clear anything away.  Every time we said no and he just slipped to the side and waited there.  It was like he was counting mississippi's in his head until he could ask us again.

So we've finished our entrees.  We ordered a shared dessert and coffee.  We're winding our evening down when the manager comes over to the table.  I assumed that he was there to just say thank you since I'm sure our bill was near the $1000 mark for the evening.  Turns out he was basically kicking us out of our seat.  He said the restaurant was at capacity and he wanted to buy us a drink at the bar so we could free up the table.

I'm sure there are people in Vegas who wish that their restaurants could be so full at 8pm on a weeknight that they are at capacity, but I can't tolerate being rushed from our table just because other people want to sit down.  I've waited at restaurants for over an hour because people weren't getting up and leaving, and that's just the way it goes.  If you dont like the wait time you go elsewhere.  It was really poor form that the manager asked us to vacate the table (after the check had been paid, mind you).

Overall I am disappointed with STK.  I went into the experience expecting stellar service and mediocre food.  Turns out the food was the surprise winner and the service was just leaving much to be desired.",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,1,0,2,eACwwCux1RMrI6mQE9P0RQ

Found on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this is the steakhouse to be scene at. The vibe definitely matches the hotel being swanky and trendy. The service was attentive and good for a steakhouse. The food - overall a good meal and price was reasonable for a steakhouse. Appetizers and salads - they are big on blue cheese here so if you are not a fan (like me) make sure that you ask that they do not include it on your dish. The bread and dip they give you is great (the bread has a blue cheese butter, but you can't taste it so I was ok with it - the dip is some herb based olive oil and it was phenomenal). The steaks - bone-in rib eye medium rare is excellent and pair it with the foie gras - definitely a luxurious meal with all that rich fattiness. This is definitely a steakhouse to come to celebrate a birthday or just hang out with some friends - I would not say its for a romantic date since the do play music (fairly loudly) and the crowd itself is extremely lively.",6QFyYvYgN1XcVfxMMMWxGw,3,0,4,KtXHQMCNJIEzsbP1Mh4mqg

2249213,2016-11-13,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"While in Vegas, I would recommend a number of other steak houses before recommending STK. The first sign should have been the apathetic hostess that let us know know our reservation was 25 minutes behind which quickly turned into an hour later than our reserved time.

Once in, the atmosphere was fun and energetic. The DJ was able to keep the entire restaurant happy with an upbeat vibe. Thought maybe this would turn around our experience. And unfortunately it stopped about there. 

We all ordered steaks and each steak was cooked incorrectly. The medium came out rare and the rare was cooked to a crisp. How do you incorrectly cook steaks at a steak house? Not one, but four slabs of premium meats that you are expected to pay a premium for. This part still baffles me. The variety of sides came out far later than our steaks which was not ideal, but we accepted it. After being the most excited for the lobster Mac and Cheese that was off the menu, it was beyond a disappointment. Lacking all flavor and the sauce was too runny for my liking. We paid the tab and went on our way.

Maybe I feel like there should be a baseline of service and quality when the average ticket is in excess of $100 per person. STK missed the mark by a long shot. Do yourself a favor and check out any of the other restaurants surrounding it or look at other properties for a proper steakhouse.",Wc2yEli8rLqQx1946LiEZw,0,0,2,bWo17mtDQNpf9XWhKmD47A

This was stop #2 of our foodie tour of Cosmo, so we were planning on a cocktail maybe, and an appetizer or two. We settled on the Lil BRG sliders and a side of their Jalepeno Cheese Grits. Both were great. The sliders had excellent flavoring with a nice sauce. The star was the grits rhough. Phenomenal with just a hint of jalapeno. Also, be sure to get a loaf of their complementary garlic bread - awesome!

We were greeted right away by our server, but I felt rushed when she asked for our drink orders. I hadn't even had the chance to touch the menu to open and browse it. She comes back and takes our drink order and asked if we're ready to order. Come on!! I've only been here 5 minutes! Just let me look at the menu for a little bit... If I wanted fast food, I would've gotten fast food.  She returns with our cocktails, my husband orders an Old Fashioned and I get the Black Rye Affair (both really good and strong) and asks if we would like a bottle of wine. I'm like WTF at this moment, but I stay calm and collected. I answer, No thank you. While she is still at the table, I asked her how the Foie Gras was here at STK. She asks if I've ever had Foie... Well, Hun, I asked how it was here at this restaurant, NOT what foie was or was like. 


We order... 

We started with a salad ""Romaine"", I think it's their version of a Caesar. It was pretty good. I liked the Parmesan lemon dressing.

Shared the Bone-in Ribeye (med rare), Parmesan Truffle Fries, Asparagus, Cauliflower Gratin. We order the Foie Gras to be topped on the steak, but it did not come out with it. I had to ask the food runner for it. He apologized and said it wasn't on the ticker but will have it right out. She forgot to put it in.. :-/
 The ribeye was grilled perfectly to temp, the Foie Gras was a little ""veiny"" I could not cut/break apart. Everything lacked seasoning.. I was disappointed! We didn't not finish anything, but our salad and drinks.  The gentleman cleared off our table and looked at me kind of weird.. Probably because of all of the food that was still left. There was no salt or pepper at the table for me to season my food. So, I just didn't want anymore. I don't care how much it costs, if I am not enjoying it, I'm not going to finish it. 

15 minutes passes after getting our table cleared, we are still waiting on our server. We were ready for the check and she has not come by. My husband had to stop another server to go find ours. She comes by about 10 minutes after asking the other lady to find her for us. We ask her for the check right away when she gets back to us. She offers dessert and coffee to us right after us asking for the bill... We  were mentally out of this restaurant 30 minutes ago! No thank you on dessert and coffee! 

We were excited about trying STK based on the reviews, but instead ended up feeling this place was entirely over rated. At least the food and service was.

Everyone who comes here is gorgeous. 

I went to the first day of STK Brunch.  WOW!!!  pretty impressed.  They had a live cover band. She has a great voice.  Might be for the opening day but they also had a fortune teller.  

One little thing, they served my coffee in  to go cup. Didn't feel it suited the caliber of this restaurant.  They also forgot the baileys.  Their cinnamon bread is soooooooo delicious.

It certainly wasn't horrible by any means, but can't say it was knock my socks off good either. They start you off with a chunk of bread that is lathered in a blue cheese butter which I admit was a twist, but misses the mark all around. It just made the bread a moist salty concoction of PASS (at least for me).

I decided upon the skirt steak and I asked for medium rare to get ultimate flavor, but I'd have had better luck just licking the cow on the pasture instead..I did like the seasoning in certain bites, but it disturbed me that every bite tasted different then the one before and it was a little disheartening that the steak was a bit tough at times. As a side I dove into the lobster mac n cheese which definitely saved the meal for me. It was actually plentiful with the lobster portion and honestly just tasted like heaven in my mouth.

My friend and I split a 10 oz filet ($48) and a 24 oz porterhouse ($65).  The porterhouse was an immense cut of beef, even after splitting it up, but the ten ouncer was the star of the show.  Not gonna lie when I'm saying it was one of the best steaks I've had.  The medium rare filet was nice and bloody, but not overly rare in the middle of the cut.  It was really THAT good.  Each bite was, well, pretty damn amazing.

For a high-end steakhouse, the price to quality ratio was pretty reasonable and hands down one the best cuts of cow I've ingested to date.

STK is definitely NOT a quiet steakhouse.  It is a straight up PARTY!  We waited in the bar area while our table for 7 was getting set up.  We had a couple drinks and within 3 tracks I was in love with the DJ.  Yes, a DJ, spinning in a round booth smack dab in the middle of the restaurant.  

After about 10 minutes a hostess seated us at our booth.  Not long after our waiter Martin came by.  When Martin was explaining the days specials I literally stopped him as JAY Z starting pumping through the speakers and I belted out to him while waving my hands up and down... ""TURN MY MUSIC Hi-Hi-Hi-Hi-GHER!!""  It was epic... but you had to be there!  We all had a chuckle and proceeded to order.

Some of the tasty craft cocktails we had throughout our meal were the Cucumber Stiletto, the Lemoncello & raspberry martini, a Champagne with hibiscus flower in it, and Iced Tea Cocktail.

A wonderful warm bread was brought out to the table.  It was soft and warm and yummo.  It had a light dipping sauce with it. Soon after our starters came out.  The Heirloom tomato and Burrata with pesto was good and i was very surprised at how good the Crab and Avocado salad was.  I was not even thinking of ordering it but I'm glad we did.  It was reminiscent of a spring roll almost.  It was fresh and wonderful.  I wish we got two.

Our main courses came out and mine was the crowd favorite.  I got the short rib and it was lovely.  There were a couple orders of the sea bass,  a filet, and the tuna tartar.  

I LOVE sides... see my ""last meal"" in the about me section.   STK's side dishes were delicious.  We shared the corn pudding, mushroom pot pie, the fries, green beans, and mac n cheese. 

We had a really fun experience here, somewhere along the ride, ""SHOTS!"" was played by the DJ and servers were coming out with trays full of shots of alcohol and handed them out to our table among others.  There was also an older white guy that was getting DOWN on the couches.  He literally hoped up on his booth and table and was rocking out to ""Play that funky music""

Tuna Tartare- OMG. the Tuna was insanely good. I have never tasted tuna so fresh before.

- Wines start at $80 per bottle. Not my thing.
- Sides are $15 extra each.
- Forgettable sides to pass: burrata, romaine (meh it's alright), lobster tail because it's $30 and mushroom pot pie because crust was paper thin.

I'm no stranger when it comes to fine dining. We ordered a nice bottle of red. I've ordered the same bottle many times when dining out and the price per bottle here seemed excessively high compared to other fine dining restaurants.

First off, there should be a disclaimer that this is NOT like the West Hollywood location... other than the fantastic steaks. This is a lounge/club that serves steak. The music is club level loud and never stops. If you're in the mood (which I was) it's great. As we waiting for my table we drank and danced. 

But, you can't really have a conversation, so if you're looking for initmate, avoid at all costs. If you're looking to warm-up before the club, this is perfect.

I then ordered a filet mignon with seared foie gras on top and bernaise sauce on the side and cream spinach as side dish.

We approach and find that we don't quite look right. STK looks and sounds more like a club than a restaurant. We discussed abandoning coming here but proceeded because we had waited all night for this reservation. 

We had a reservation for 930 - we show up and are told they are running 20 minutes behind. We inquire what the point of having a reservation is and the hostess just stares blankly back at us. I ask her how we will know when our table is ready and she says""someone will come find you."" Mind you, there are so many people congregated by the doorway that I don't think she could find us if she had to. We wait for 30 minutes and watch people come out and watch them head back in. No one appears to actually be leaving. 

I head back in and ask her how much longer and she says ""I really don't know - we are waiting for the tables to clear out."" I push for an estimate of time and she says ""I would guess 20-30 minutes."" This means on top of my reservation I might have to wait an additional hour!! No thanks. 

If you are looking for a nice dining experience look else where - this place is all about being cool. When I'm hungry I don't care about cool - I want to eat!! 

Long story short - we left after 30 min (on top of our reservation) I am not giving hundreds of dollars to a place that doesn't value every customer. No food is worth that.

My husband got the filet and I got the ribeye. He loved his filet, my ribeye was nothing to write home about. Definitely not the best steak I've ever had.

I mean, he had to yell because you couldn't hear your own thoughts over the music the DJ had streaming over every table and like clockwork he had an ultra-annoying horn blow ever few minutes. As if that were not enough, every few seconds there was a voice reminding us that the guy controlling the sounds was a ""world-class DJ.""

For starters, we had their warm bread with cilantro dipping sauce and their shrimp rice krispies bisque.  Their bread was super yummy........and the shrimp bisque was awesome......a thick creamy bisque with a spicy kick.  Just as good as the Palm's or Craftsteak's lobster bisque

For dinner, we had their bone-in rib eye steaks and sides of creamed spinach, corn pudding, mushroom pot pie and truffled fries.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and prepared.  The sides were all excellent, especially the corn pudding.

Being it was my wife's 40th birthday, this was supposed to be the beginning of a crazy, fun filled night. Our reservations were for 8:45, but they didn't seat us until around 9:45. The music was decent and very loud, which was fine with us. Finally after being seated, the waiter told us the specials, then disappeared.  We sat there drinking water, waiting for 40 minutes, and he never returned.  All of the poor reviews on Yelp complained about the prices, and they are all true. If money is no object for you, you probably won't mind. However, with a party of 7, I didn't expect to see a porterhouse steak for $129, no sides included. Now that people in our party are starting to get angry for being ignored for so long. This was unacceptable, considering our bill was about to be $700+. So we walked out, and ended up at Musashi Teppan. Had an absolute blast, doing sake bombs with our chef. Personally, I feel that because STK just expects that because you are already there, they've already earned your money.

That being said, management was very good about providing us with new sides (so they were warm when our new steaks came out), free dessert and a % off the bill. Much appreciated for sure.

Oh my Lord. Could you not taste anything more divine? Now, I've heard a lot of things about the popular Las Vegas STK: both good and bad. But the talk is not just talk; the talk is all true.

We ordered a little bit of everything as all foodies do, in attempt to reveal the man behind the curtain (or kitchen) and see if the popular restaurant was what it was all cracked up to be. The steak was amazing; the chicken was delicious, but my ultimate favorite were the donuts. I have not, I repeat, HAVE NOT had any dessert quite like it. I actually have foodie remorse that I didn't eat dessert for dinner...hey, when in Vegas! 

The Brussel sprouts were not my favorite rendition of this beloved veggie, but they were still better than I expected. If you're looking for a few sides, feel free to pass on that one. 

But our server Collin and now favorite Las Vegas person alive, really set our experience over the top. I've never had a fun, talkative, experienced and attentive server like him before--anywhere. If every server were like him, every restaurant would be enticing.

I understand if you're a restaurant in Vegas you need to compete. Being a great steakhouse is not enough to stand out. So what to do? Hire a DJ to pump loud music throughout the place to simulate a club atmosphere. Because I always want to savor an expensive meal while lip reading companions at my table. Because I always wanted to experience bass tones vibrating my organs while I try to enjoy a meal. It's a challenge. It's different!

Look, I'm obviously not the right demo for STK Las Vegas. I'm 50, and I love good food. I want to enjoy a quality steak without it vibrating off the plate. To each his own.

During my short bar visit I ordered a Paloma, which was one of the most refreshing drinks I've ever had. A quarter of a fresh grapefruit was muddled into tequila, mixed with light carbonation - perfection.

They brought over a break-a-part bread that was covered in a blue cheese butter that tasted heavenly. 

We got a couple appetizers to kick things off - the tuna tartare & the pork belly. My favorite was the pork belly, which was thick, crispy, and juicy. 

I ordered a rare 8oz Filet, which was also perfection with added peppercorn. We got a variety of sides, which included the lobster mac and cheese, creamed corn (tad too sweet for me), and broccolini. Side note - I also consumed 3 other Paloma's during this feast.

We ended up ordering the warm chocolate chip cookie for dessert which was a la mode. Came out in a mini cast iron skillet and was cooked to gooey greatness.

This restaurant blends the nightclub atmosphere with a fancy steakhouse and does it well.  It is not very large, so if coming on a weekend, you need a reservation but if you happen to be in town during the week you shouldn't have an issue finding a table.

The prices here are what you'd expect at a fancy steakhouse and will run you about $100 a person on the average.

I had the bone-in rib eye and it was cooked a perfect medium and melted in your mouth.  It was one of the better cooked steaks I've had in a long time and tasted delicious.

I chose the Cauliflower Gratin which was just OK.  It just didn't have much flavor.  I feel maybe some salt would have helped, or perhaps using salted butter instead would have given it enough of an oomph it so desperately needed.
We also had the Mac & Cheese at the table as a recommendation by the server and while it was creamy (I always like my mac creamy), it still didn't wow anyone.  Both our sides fell flat on all 3 of us at the table and we agreed we should have either had no sides or picked others.  We didn't even bother boxing the left overs to go.  This is where this place loses a star for me.

Service was great!  Everyone was on their toes refilling waters and delivering food on time and in order.


Would I come back here?  Not sure.  With the amount of amazing steakhouses in Las Vegas, it is a very tough decision on where to go each visit.  If I stayed at Cosmo again, I'd definitely consider it.",6InyxxWLYI0J9y4342o12Q,2,0,4,la0Lk4-POCOylUsJO2rDhA

The tartare was wonderful, definitely above average among all the tartare I've tried. The lamb chops were good, and my date seemed to really enjoy his steak. The grits were very good, and went well with our meat. However, the truffle fries were average - the flavor of the truffles did not infuse into the fries but merely coated the top.

I should have listened to my husband when he said he hasn't heard the greatest things about this place (we have an STK in Washington, DC). But the reviews were higher at this location, so I thought it was good to go. I called a couple of days in advance and made a reservation. When we arrived the hostess had our reservation, but she said they needed a minute before we could be seated. This place was pretty packed on a Thursday night, and there was really nowhere to sit. So we kind of had to stand around. We also had to wait 10 minutes or so before we were seated, which I didn't think it was cool--since we made a reservation. We were seated in the lower bar area-- which again was a disappointment since we made a reservation --I really wanted to sit up stairs in the less crowded seating area. But I didn't make a fuss and we sat in the lower area. The water waiters served us water a few moments after we were seated. After 5 minutes or so of patiently waiting we finally received our waiter who gave us an overview of the menu. He explained things that were off of the menu, and I was really intrigued about the lobster macaroni. He gave us a few more minutes to look over the menu. Finally when he came back we placed our order. The hubby and I ordered a steak, lamb chops, asparagus, the lobster mac and cheese, and a side of crab legs. After we ordered the hubby and I noticed everyone had bread while they waited and we didn't -- and we had been seated at least 30 minutes or so. We finally tracked down our waiter and I asked him do we receive bread? He said oh yea and it would be out shortly. About another 5 minutes later we finally received the house bread. The bread was ok, but it tastes even better without the cheese and garlic they put on top --- you can request it without the cheese and we did. So how was the food?

1. My husband thought his steak was pretty good but he said he has had better-- I wasn't impressed by his steak but I'm the seafood lady not the steak lady. 

2. My lamb chops were amazing!! Very well prepared! My chops were so good my hubby took a break from his steak and finished my plate. 

3. The asparagus was ah ok.. We like are asparagus soft and not crunchy and they could have used more time in the steamer-- in our opinion. 


4. The lobster mac and cheese was ok. I wasn't really impressed-- this dish also really pissed me off when we got the bill because it was $30 dollars!! My waiter didn't explain the price of this and if I had known this side dish was going to be so much, we would have left it in the kitchen. 

5. The side of crab legs were delicious! I really enjoyed! --worth $30 dollars

The vibe in here is more New Yorkish-- as in really loud and seats close together.. I think they are going for a club/restaurant vibe... The female DJ they had was on point, I have to give them props for hiring her. With the service, the wait, and the surprise pricing of food- I left with a full belly but a little annoyed about this place.",rDbTwiJJIOlg6lL7iEdSig,2,1,2,McdkkBiJx-CXvuH-15VGiA

I love how intimate the seatings are. We were able to cuddle up around our dinner. Our waiter was on top of everything, as we usually expect in these nice restaurants. I usually don't like how dim it is at restaurants, but the highlighted halo that drops perfectly to illuminate the center of our table was perfect lighting. 

We ordered a medium 22oz bone in rib eye, their mashed potatoes (forgot their name for it), saut√©ed mushrooms, king crab legs (opted for the warm, drawn butter version), half a dozen of oysters, and the sticky toffee pudding. You guys this was the other night, and I am still mesmerized. 

The perfectly flavored and charred of the steak to it's perfectly cooked in medium state - amazing! The king crab legs were so thick and juicy, when dipped in butter and splashed with lemon juice, was just a delightful, pleasant gift for my taste buds and my body as a whole. The oysters were so fresh and sweet. Mashed potatoes weren't anything extravagant, but the saut√©ed mushrooms made up for it. 

Lastly, for dessert we had the toffee pudding. Dessert is my favorite meal, and this is by far the best dessert I've had my whole life lol. Omg i sound extra, but that is my opinion. The warm, sticky toffee base with this gooey, chocolatey, toffeeish, cake on top, then this nice scoop of freshly made sweet cream ice cream as a topping was just all so decadent and well-balanced.

It was quite difficult to enjoy my $50 steak and glass of Pinot Noir with My Chemical Romance blaring over me. I definitely wouldn't describe this restaurant as an intimate setting.  My conversation at the table was minimal or straight yelling at one another.

The reason why I gave this establishment 3 stars, versus 2 is because the food was actually very good. Fresh baked bread with blue cheese melted on top is served with this basil/garlic? infused oil. It took awhile to get our bread, but well worth the wait.  I ordered the 12 oz. bone-in rib eye  medium rare and man-friend ordered the skirt steak, which both came out perfectly cooked.

From the moment you walk in, the hostesses, the managers, bartenders, servers, and diners are all outgoing, excited, high energy, beautiful, and cool people.  In fact, I was probably the most uncool person in the place - haha.  Top it off with some delicious food and some great beats coming out the speakers and a night out at STK is better than a great night in the casinos.  OK - not really, but it is a whole lot better way to spend your money than a bad night at the tables!

Since STK is in the Cosmopolitan, you would expect it to be a little on the hipster side - and that is not meant in a bad way - and it does not disappoint.  The Chandelier may be the coolest bar on the Strip and STK complements it well.  As I mentioned, the atmosphere is on the loud side with mostly old skool hip hop playing - probably not the best place if you are looking for a quiet romantic or business dinner.

Our service team was very attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  

I had the petite filet, which was done perfectly.  The table had all kinds of sides, but I particularly enjoyed the truffle fries, mushrooms, and creamed corn.

For dessert, the server whipped up a little sampler plate for the table, which was excellent.  

One downside is that they only have single bathrooms so the line was a little long - although I imagine you could find one just outside the restaurant.  

Be sure to make reservations because the room is a little on the small side and be sure to bring the credit card because the bill will be a little on the big side.

2562576,2014-05-09,3,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I dined at STK a couple years back, and I remember thinking, it was just OK. It was on my birthday and I enjoyed the company and celebration. I didn't let it bother me. When I was invited to go again, and for free, I figured, why not? 
Either I stepped up my steak game, or STK fell off even more because overall- NOTHING impressed me. Wait, I fib, the mushroom pot pie side dish was good enough to order again. So out of a dinner that would have cost $145, the best part was a side dish?!!?

My boyfriend and I ordered the gyoza, a field greens salad, the 20oz ribeye sliced, the mushroom pot pie, and a panna cotta dessert. 
First, sharing is the way to go. Other than the potstickers being extremely small, coming with only 4, and costing $19- I was happy with the portions and servings. They offered to split the salad and slice the steak, very appreciated for things like that. 
They staff was on game, they cleared our plates and gave us fresh silverware after every dish. The salad needed more of the cheese and croutons. That's what made it enjoyable. The steak was just ok. Not amazing, not bad. The bacon butter on top was super succulent. The side of mushrooms came in a classic looking pot pie crust, and when you cut into it there were about 4 types of mushrooms in a creamy sauce. It was the highlight of the night! The panna cotta, never again! Wrong consistency and just all around not enough flavor for me. 

Another downfall- one glass of wine is $17. I understand fancy steakhouses charging more for specialty cocktails, high end liquor, etc. But even then it ranges about $10-$15. $17 for a glass of mediocre wine, is pathetic. 

I get STK's concept. A sexy club feel with high end food. Except that wasn't the vibe I got. More like a cutting corners steakhouse that caters to the local adult industry, rich tourist, and old men who like the eye candy. 
Vegas needs that, don't get me wrong. I am not hating on the adult industry in the least. But when there are well known Vegas working girls that dine there on the regular, it attracts a certain crowd. You wouldn't see those same girls down the street at Herb & Rye, thank God. 

Overall, my favorite part was the DJ bumping 90's jams, and the mushrooms. I will gladly skip out on the drunk, red head tourist sitting next to me screaming, and spilling stinky wine, and the pervy old guys. 
However, Vegas has a place for everyone, this is just not mine.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,3,2,2,ZmOWtkZ9A3vM5g8ZR_wrkw

The side dishes- mac n cheese and creamed spinach were ok. The mushroom pot pie was pretty good. The feedback from the rest of the group was that the less expensive plates were pretty good.

2587883,2018-05-01,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Edit: After I posted my original review below, we decided to give it another try (yes, the very next day). This time we order the 10oz filet and mashed potatoes. Though it took MUCH longer to get our food this time, it was nice because it didn't feel as rushed as it did the night before. It was also much quieter and easier to talk to the person sitting next to me (this was a Tuesday compared to a Monday). 

The filet was extremely tender and cooked perfectly. I ordered mine medium rare plus. Again the flavor left something to be desired (and I already knew going in that the filet isn't the most flavorful cuts but it was still better than the Sirloin which you can briefly read about in my review below). 

I upgraded my 2 star rating to a 3 star because the second night was a lot more enjoyable but I definitely want to give a different steak house a try upon my next trip to Vegas. Oh yeah, the mashed potatoes were pretty damn good but could have used a little pepper and a tiny by of salt.

--------------
My 1st review from Monday evening:
I had STK for my birthday a few years back and it was the best steak I had ever had. Hands down. 

Decided to try it again last night and the sirloin just wasn't what I remembered. It wasn't too flavorful and the tenderness was just average. It was averagely moist and cooked a tiny bit underdone but nothing I would have complained about. 

It is one of the nicer restaurants in the Cosmo and the atmosphere is terrific but it was fairly loud and crowded last night (but that is to be expected at a lot of the more popular restaurants). The noise level more or less caused my date and me to shout at each other the whole dinner. Again, nothing I would have subtracted points from my over all score over, but something to keep in mind.

The Mushroom Pot pie wasn't bad but it's basically a bowl of liquidy mushroom filling with a layer of baked dough over the top. Nothing special, and frankly a little bland. 

I posted a different review saying I'm not so sure I'm going to come back to STK, but I know some restaurants have off nights so I will most likely give it another try.",tPCH30t9bX5blb-CwuGIGA,0,0,3,go5bxDrssQIN4pF3ITxxLw

That said, all the food we had was great. My rib eye was cooked perfectly and super tender. The mashed potatoes were excellent as well. Despite having to scream, the service was very good, too. 

I wouldn't go back, but if you don't mind really excessively loud environments while you eat, you'll get some very good food. Prices are ridiculous, but I guess that's to be expected at a Vegas steakhouse. 

(one small other thing... 'full bar'? No. They have no draft beer! Which seemed to be really common in Vegas. I mean, its a steakhouse, so I'm having a nice cabernet anyway, but why no draft beer? If I want beer I have to have a $9 bottle of Blue Moon? Maybe it's because I'm from Portland and live in SF... but I expect good restaurants to have a few good drafts.

Our service was wonderful. We were checked on at all the appropriate times, our server was attentive but never pushy and clearly knew the menu very well.

After some convincing of the bride and a simple phone call, STK was easily able to seat our party of 9 for quite possible one of the greatest steaks I've ever had. 

- Rib cap special: top it with truffle butter. Worth every. Damn. Penny. This steak meets me in my dreams on the regular. 

- Truffle Mac and cheese: Also a regular in my food dreams. Best Mac I've ever had. Ever. Ever. EVER. 

- Truffle Lobster Risotto special: decent flavor but small serving and not worth the price. A bit bland and could use more parmigiano. 

The ambiance is like other STKs - very hip and lively and the perfect spot to dine before hitting the club. Only weird thing about this place is their lack of bathrooms (there's only a couple). But I guess since this is located inside a hotel casino you could easily leave the restaurant and go to bathrooms not too far outside the restaurant anyway.

I came here with a group of 12 people for a bachelor party. We were hooked up with a private room, so we didn't have a problem with sound level. You can actually adjust the music volume and the brighness. BTW, the music was a really good mix.

The service was really excellent. Our busser was in very frequently and our waiters checked-in very often as well.

Now to the food:

I got the 34 oz Cowboy Ribeye with Fois gras topping.
Maybe it was a mistake getting such a gigantic cut of meat, but what's done is done.
The steak has some black char surrounding it. This is very different from any other steak house that I have been to. The char wasn't my favorite but for the larger cuts it does help break up the soft texture of the meat. THe body of the meat was perfectly medium-rare served with two side sauces (one sweeter, one more savory). THe fois gras was delicious and is a DEFINITE must-do, you can't get fois gas in California!

So yes the steak was great, but the char brought it down. Fois gras topping was excellent.
Private-room made it very comfortable, but I don't think I would have liked it in the main areas.

We had friends eating dinner here, so just wanted to say hello. I'm so glad we did. The vibe here is amazing. Plenty of attractive people...women dressed up to perfection. It's loud, but not too loud. There isn't actually that much room to grab a drink and hang out without being in the way. However, none of the waiters/waitresses have an attitude about passing through. They very politely ask you to move with an ""excuse me"".

The music was bumpin, and some diners even got up and started dancing in the open areas or, like one woman, on the table behind her booth. I was even more impressed with that. Security was on the scene, but just monitored to make sure she was okay. It wasn't like bouncers in the club who get upset and yell at you to sit down. They assessed the situation, saw that she was in control, and let her (and everyone else) enjoy her dance. Again...customer service goes a long way, and they did it right.

Unfortunately, our waiter seemed incredibly flustered and utterly miserable from the minute we saw him.  I felt bad for the guy!

Service, I can forgive more easily.  Quality steak at a steakhouse, on the other hand, is a different story.  I ordered a small Filet Medallion cooked medium rare.  It came out just seconds away from being medium.  The meat was decent but not as tender as I'd like it.  It was just...okay.

I swung through Cosmopolitan and an irresistible steakhouse aroma clutched me. I asked a hotel concierge to tell me the source and in a short walk I was sliding on to a stool at the STK bar- fine for a solo. I liked the atmosphere which was lively and busy with a great DJ mix as a backdrop. The volume issues that I've read from others was not an issue for me because I wasn't engaged in any challenging conversations. 

I had the foie gras french toast, bone-in rib and a moscow mule. I enjoyed everything about them.

2804994,2017-07-02,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"So, Saturday night in Las Vegas and I got reservations at STK, which I made 2 months ago for the girlfriend and myself. We arrive early for our reservation, 7pm, 15 minutes early. We had a 7:15pm time reserved. Here's where it gets good, as we check in with the hostess, we are promptly told by the young lady at the host stand after we check in that my reservation isn't till 9:30pm. So I reply, no my reservation is at 7:15pm and further more, a member of your staff called me at 11am today to confirm it. So then the young lady reply's, well we have you for a 9:30pm reservation. Again I reply abut my reservation at 7:15pm and the follow-up call. The hostess then replies that I made my reservation on Open Table and not directly from STK, and that there system shows a 9:30pm reservation. So, since I save everything, I pulled out my I Phone to prove that here is the confirmation email of 7:15pm to her and the gentleman who was standing there the entire time supporting this young ladies goof up. After looking at my email she relied, ""Oh"" and said please have a seat at the bar while we ""find"" you a table. Not sorry, or I made a mistake and we apologize for the error. Sorry young lady, I've worked in upscale dining while an undergrad during college, the Ritz Carlton, and I know how the game is played with slipping the host a $20-$50 for a table even though one doesn't have a reservation. So after this exchange at the host podium, we went to the bar for 2 strawberry mojito's. Very good, even for $18. As we are finishing the cocktails, another hostess finds us to seat us. Still within the 7:15-7:25pm range. Good to go. Out server, Paul, was right there. Very informative and friendly. So we first ordered 2 more mojito's. When they came and we tasted them, ouch, they didn't taste close to what they tasted like at the bar. We called Paul over to tell him how bad the mojito's tastes and that they taste nothing like the 2 we just had at the bar. Paul stated that the way the mojito's where made was the correct way to make the mojito's and that what was made at the bar, with Bacardi rum, was wrong. So there's no consistency in the process to make mojito's at STK, although STK is charging a premium price? Anyway, Paul made it right and had the same bartender we had made initially make a new mojito. For dinner, the food was good, except for the creamed spinach which was bland. I'll stick with a 2 because of Paul being good with service after the mojito exchange, and the steaks, 2 filets, were very good.
Can't say I'll be back after this though. I like to know that when I make a reservation, and it's confirmed the same day on the actual reservation date by the restaurant, that I know I'll be greeted with respect.

So of course, it being Saturday night, the place was packed. Reservations were made days before so we were solid.  For starters, we had a dozen Oysters and Burrata. Both were great and the Oysters were from the PNW - so pretty delicious.

For the main course I had the bone-in Ribeye at med-rare. Topped with truffle butter, though it did not need that. It was rich, flavorful and cooked perfectly. Very good. My wife had the Roasted Dover Sole which was out of this world and is something that she is craving, even now. So mad kudo's for doing the fish perfect for her!

We didn't do desert cause we wanted to try David Chang's newly opened Milk Bar on the floor below!

2916817,2015-09-17,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I have no idea what all the fuss is all about. I have been to many better steak places than this one. The one thing this place has going for itself (in my mind) is that it is young and hip. Great people watching, but that's about it. 

We came on a Tuesday night, the place was quite crowded. We waited for about 45 min for a table. They seated us (8 people) on a round table that fits 4-5 comfortably. I thought this was unacceptable. When you are spending $200 a pop, you expect to be seated comfortably. It's very loud (music). Quite tough to have a conversation at the dinner table.

Food is very expensive. They charge for everything extra, e.g. a little sauce on the side. The side dishes are tiny and $12 each - very pricey. There are no fries, the asparagus and spinach were very bland, both were cold by the time they got to our table, the potatoes with cheese and truffles on the other hand were quite yummy. There are no fries. The cheapest wine is $85, the most expensive $13,000 (for a bottle that retails for $200)

However, what is really the worst: the steak isn't that great. I had the sirloin medium rare. It was served on a cold plate and by the time I got my steak it was cold. It's sad to get a cold steak when you pay $200 a pop for a meal. The cut wasn't that great - quite stringy. Did I say already that the steak was disappointing??? One of the people in our group had the tuna. His verdict was ""not edible"" apparently strange texture and weird sauce. He is the least picky person I know, so it must have been quite unpleasant. But I guess you don't go to a steak house to eat tuna...

Service was mediocre. We constantly had to ask for water refills. There was no salt / pepper on the table and it took a long time to get some when our steak was there. While less trendy, the food at the Capital Grille is much better in my opinion.",HBhSDfeAVdffmZaLh3pszA,1,1,2,LrIzaPpDEi3sshn--jKFYg

We also received a complimentary cookie and ice cream dessert from the waiter - super sweet of him (and no, it's not because he messed up on or order or anything like that, his service was IMPECCABLE). One downside, we brought our own bottle of wine and found out corkage was $50. From my experience, I usually pay around $30-$35 for the corkage fee in nicer restaurants (we went to Scarpetta the next night and corkage was only $35 there). I thought $50 was pretty steep.

Our food: 
Complimentary bread with special house dipping sauce: sooo yummy! one of the best I've ever had

Dozen fresh oysters : so fresh and yummy with special house sauce and cocktail sauce

Dungeness crab salad: not much salad, but the dungeness crab was so delicious

10oz Fillet Mignon: delicious, perfectly cooked to medium rare with red wine sauce

Big eye tuna: soooo delicious! cooked perfectly to medium rare with wasabi mashed potato

Mushroom pot pie: yummy! the portion was like an appetizer 

Food was so delicious, flavorful enough without saltiness. Lemon drop martini was good, Grey Goose dry martini was strong, you can choose stuffed olives or regular ones. 

The service was just above average for an expensive fine steakhouse, we weren't very impressed. But he did a good job, friendly, fast and somewhat attentive.

The negatives: portion size of the sides for $13 - two people won't be full on one.

Out of all the things we ordered I loved the foi gras, wild mushrooms and the steak the most!!! The fries is also great!!! The foie gras is cooked to perfection and so is the steak!! The beed carpaccio is usually my favorite but not from this place. 

The customer service was also great!!! I wish I remember the lady's name but she was really nice and helpful.",J_qauqGJ3DQ_FZwSqvTPdw,0,0,5,oSM0etmRzPY29E9mS_g-kw

The service was alright; at certain points, our waiter did seem rather put off at having to explain certain items on the menu.  I was excited about the foie gras French toast, however I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the foie and the dish didn't work for me.  My fillet was well cooked, but nothing spectacular especially given the price.  The Parmesan truffle fries were unfortunately undercooked: somewhat crispy on the outside but still raw on the inside?!?  However, the place does get 1 star for playing 70s-80s music and avoiding the need to play Top 100 music!  The decor was cool and modern, but certainly didn't make up for the food and service.",trsr1OL-Cn3ZYjTNYIxfKQ,0,0,3,AWHa3R83aZMPM6bTZ5IaYw

The black padding was a little odd, but at least we were shielded from the noise in the dining hall. Service was very attentive and the servers were ever present yet not annoying. 

We shared crab cakes, chicken skewers, crostini, and seafood platters to start. After the kale salad with crispy quinoa, I delved into the 7oz. ribeye with lobster tail. The beef was cooked to a perfect medium. It was tender and minimally seasoned, allowing the natural flavor and juices to really shine. This was accompanied by a few sides that we shared - mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and green beans - none of which were particularly memorable. Clearly their focus is on the entrees.

The salted caramel budino was huge, too large for me to finish after my meal but it was topped with cookie crumbles and whipped cream, making the few bites that I was able to take delightful.

Down the hallway to the restrooms is a guy manning a table full of bathroom essentials. Again, one more odd thing but I guess this is Vegas.",EPK4_bIsyVlrlsLH3RClEQ,16,13,4,jYRceDPRDC3QKpI0gw7jHw

Two guys at a steakhouse for dinner, so it stays pretty basic:  drinks, salads, steaks and a few sides.  It was ALL GOOD at this place.  I'll admit to having some reservations based on prior reviews regarding the noise level in the restaurant, and am very pleased to say we didn't experience that at all.  Maybe those running STK have read the reviews and toned it down?  Granted it was a Sunday night, but it didn't seem like either the Cosmopolitan hotel or STK restaurant was particularly jumpin' that night.  We got a table right away, and were able to carry on a normal conversation throughout the dinner.

I started with the wedge salad while my friend had some kind of bibb lettuce roll-up special, and they were both good.  A pleasing amount of bleu cheese in my wedge, which I think is the perfect setup for our steak entrees that followed.  I had a large NY Strip steak, cooked perfectly medium rare, which my friend opted for short ribs, which he said were fantastic.  Our two sides were also terrific, a dish of sauteed spinach and another side of fingerling potatoes roasted in garlic.  I know the potatoes were all gone before we left the table, while there was some spinach left, but think that was more because our appetites were satisfied than anything else.

Couple of dirty martini's with bleu cheese stuffed olives over the course of the evening, and we were quite happy.  My friend picked up the tab so I didn't see the final tally, but I'd estimate easily $100 - $150 each, as I think everything was ala carte.  But I'd go to this place again in a heartbeat, next time in Vegas.",EFmUVpLvda3n9FuxhzWD6w,3,0,5,0o2qr-72V6jz2_gO9uLwkA
3051251,2014-04-08,2,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I love trying new steakhouses, so I had a lot of past experiences to compare to a new steakhouse experience. STK wasn't the best, but certainly not the worst. I quite enjoyed my experience there. The best thing I could say, it was an experience I have never had before at a steakhouse.

When I think of a steakhouse, usually it involves older white men as servers wearing doctor white coat, dark wood, calf skin or some type of homage to the steer, and the place is usually filled with business people or couples.

This place had none if those above!! It was like a club! It was very modern. There was a DJ, and people dancing around. It was hard to talk as the music was so loud. When you wait for your table at the bar, people may try to pick you up or some lady's boobs were on your face as you turn some other directions. Well, it is Vegas after all! So the atmosphere would be considered ""fun"" unless you hate clubbing. 

I was there with my business associates and one more plus was this meal wouldn't cost me a penny. Before I knew it, wine was flowing, seafood tower and beef tartare were gracing the table. Yum yum yum.. All were delicious!

I ordered a regular filet with foie gras topping. I was pretty happy. The foie put it over the top for sure! I loved it but I had better tasting steak before. I wish I ordered the boned in filet but I was trying to not take advantage of the opportunity. After all, I already topped it with foie gras. It was rather cheap however, $12 for the topping. What a deal.

Some of the guys ordered the boned in filet and porterhouse. They seemed very pleased.

Next to our table, there was a paralyzed guy in an elaborate wheelchair. I guess he was a loaded poker champ that got injured from some accident. Around him, there were at least five scantily clad women dancing around him, worshipping him. They looked hired but whatever, he was having fun and good for him. It was quite a show for us too!

Lastly, our cool server bought our table a round of shots of 1942 tequila and he did the shot with us! How cool.. Never in my life.

So.. See...?! The experience at STK was nothing I have ever had. Not sure if I would go back though, as once is enough.",UrOofvcBl0gAbKPAEaj83A,1,1,3,_MREfNwkoxePIbvgHc2Q3g

Ambiance aside, the food is decent, but pricey. We started with their house made buttery garlic bread, drenched in cilantro oil and bleu cheese, which was delicious and hot upon arrival. Five mins later, it had cooled and became hard as a rock. We both had the skirt steak, cooked a perfect medium rare, and shared sides of foie gras and truffle fries.

First of all, any restaurant in the Cosmo that let's me back in the escalator-glory of the Chandelier Bar is a-ok. Arrived early and sat at the bar. Had an exquisitely expensive cocktail with gin and elderflower, roughly equivalent to two weeks allowance in 1991, and the bubbles went promptly to my head.

Sat for dinner and had excellent salad, excellent wine, and excellent steak. All of this is to be expected at this price, but here's where STK is cooler than say, Mortons, or even Cut.

1. Our server was out of this world. She was thorough without being patronizing, warm without seeming fake, and attentive without being obtrusive. She had a flair for the dramatic and I was mesmerized as I watched her gesticulate seductively through the specials. She had a twinkle in her eye. It was charming beyond belief.

2. The vibe was young and fun. They had a DJ spinning 90s music and it created an ambiance of energy and excitement.

This restaurant and its menu is world class. Once in a while, one may run into service hiccups which normally happen between 9PM and 11PM. This is the restaurant's busiest time with every seat occupied and every server to go along with it all.
We started with an appetizer of Alaskan Crab Legs. You only get two however they come glazed with garlic butter sauce and I had ordered them warm and not chilled. Huge hit with the Pinot Noir that we were paring these with.
I had the delicious 14oz bone-in Filet Mignon along with the 1 1/4 lb lobster tail to make it a Surf n Turf. The steak and lobster tail was prepared to my liking and was complimented well with a side dish of Truffle Fries. If you haven't tried their Truffle Fries then please do so since it beats the standard potato sides in my opinion. I think that the sprinkled parmesan cheese combined with thick slices of potato arranged perfectly on a plate makes this a good side to have. The filet was as soft was butter and tasted amazing with very little spicing. I had declined additional sauces or garnishment for the steak as well. 
This restaurant can only have one challenge and that is service and that too because it will always be compared with the world class food and ambiance. It appears that the only thing that may slip here is service.",m7H3pTs9yaaY3R9ML98X4g,5,6,5,XXUBejKXhxqWsfPFghOKZA

I have heard such wonderful things about STK and I figured I'd give it a try to see what's all the talk was about. Long story short I had a cousin visiting me from Wisconsin and he was here to celebrate his 21st birthday! While booking my reservation I made sure it was known that the reason for dining that night was to celebrate. Now normally at these types of places, they give you some sort of small cake and ice cream etc and wish the person a happy birthday. Upon arriving I even reminded the hostess about the birthday, she replied ""yeah ok"" with a smug face. That's the first point off. What's with the attitude? Next when it was time to order food we had a waiter come over who from the get go was STANK. For a person who's never ate at this place I expected some sort of recommendations or just to at least be more friendly. He was unbelievable! One person in my party never really ate steak and he wanted to just get a small appetizer and a side of crab. Well guess what when this crab came out it was on a little petri dish with maybe an OUNCE of crab?  $25??? GTFOH! So when i told the waiter about the size and let him know that it wasnt exactly what I expected he got an attitude and snatched the plate, and at that moment I had to stop myself from snatching HIM! unbelievable! After that situation occured he never returned to the table which was fine because it would have been a situation if he came back with that attitude! Now on to the food.. The food was a different story! I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye steak(medium well) AMAZING! My Cousin ordered the Skirt Steak(Well Done) AMAZING! Another person ordered the Filet(medium). So as you can see the food wasn't the issue it was the service and in a place like this that wants to charge the prices they do, they need to make sure they have respectable people working for them and learn how to not judge people. Nobody in my group was not dressed for the occasion but because you see a group of black guys you off the bat treat us like we aren't suppose to be there? I make PLENTY (legit) MONEY $$$ and eat 5-star meals on the regualr, so fine dining is NEVER an issue. My RED BOTTOM Christian Louboutin loafers cost more than the hostess and waiter's paycheck COMBINED! So.. With all that being said I would NEVER return back to this place even if somebody paid me..

Came here for a Bachelorette Party dinner for my bestie and I made my reservations as soon as I found out we where going to Vegas. I was just at the Cosmo a few months back and wanted to have the girls have dinner here and enjoy the lounge and atmosphere of STK and the Cosmopolitian. Because I'm a planning nazi, I downloaded the menu and picked out what I was going to get 2 months ahead of time (I'm a little picky). I quickly saw that it was a pricey place, but I checked they YELP reviews and decided it was worth the try. 
We arrived on time for our reservations and we were asked to wait in the ""lounge"" which was a couple of tables beside the bar that was already taken by other parities that were waiting. We stood around for a brief minute and was ushered to our table on the second level of the restaurant. First thing I have to say is how beautiful this place was. It was hip, artsy, dark colors complimented by white, all that frou frou Cosmo/Vegas stuff. 
We met our server, Isaac, who was SOOOO GREAT, which is a relief because I was a little worried that since it was so busy that the staff would be subpar on the service front. But Isaac totally showed us that he is excellent at what he does, and my girlfriends loved him! THe food was fantastic, I got the Shrimp Rice Crispies, a few people got steak or tartare. The sides were good too, esp the Lobster Macaroni! YUM! Again, it is a bit pricey but you are paying for the service, food, ambience, and location. 
If you are visiting the Cosmopolitian with friends, on a date, etc, I would highly recommend going to the Vesper or Chandelier Lounge before dinner and have a drink!

It's been a week to this day that I got the pleasure of trying out this contemporary restaurant w/in house dj.  The music was so loud you could barely hold a conversation unless you were two inches apart, which I think is a little on purpose.  ;)...but enjoying such good food, who would mind?!  In fact, I was enjoying it all so much, I should've had my own table.  All I can say is, that was one of the plumpest, juciest meats i've ever had.  My friend ordered a scotch whiskey to accompany it. Not a bad choice and his wife, venison chops, which were delish.
I started with the pear/endive/arugala salad/walnuts/blue cheese crumbles ...very light and tasty followed by a shared plate of carpaccio, which I had heard of..maybe 6 years ago.  Very tasty with the pesto pasta..don't have it any other way!  The Seafood Platter for $40 which included: 2 oysters/ 2 pickled shrimp with jalapenos and red peppers/ alaskan king crab/ 1/4 maine lobster.  It came with the horseradish and usual side sauces but there was another with a little vinegar..you hardly tasted it (and i'm not sure what else was in it) to add a little flavor.  I made the right decision there, as I was trying to keep my dinner as 'natural' as possible..just adding a little kick to it.  I enjoyed my main meal, which is more of an appetizer for me, with a rum/basil/cucumber cocktail.  I could not have been offered a better suggestion.  The dessert was a berry mousse.  Topping it all off with a glass of champagne. One of the best meals of my life. I could not even fathom tainting all the good flavors in my mouth by touching the parmesan truffle fries, which I hear...are the rage. I can't wait to go back, even if it's by myself, at own little table. The pleasure will be all mine.",eptndiIAdcbw5I82sOh5Dg,0,0,4,y-ifdt28_wk6KakZd4xSWQ

We started off with a nice bottle of Chardonnay.  We were given the bread which had a nice bleu cheese spread on it, not too much, just right!  This came with some oil for dipping.  We also had the beef tartar & borracha salad.  The cheese on the salad was to die for.  The beef tartar was good but not the best I've ever had.  The server did inform me that the Carpaccio is a better choice but I don't like Carpaccio's as much.

We then had our entree's.  I tried the special which was a 7oz filet w/ crab & asparagus.  It was prepared to my liking, medium rare and the flavor was excellent.  I also got a side of b√©arnaise.  My company got the fish on the menu which she loved.  We shared the truffle mac and cheese which was top notch as well.

Paul was very attentive during the entire meal.  He asked for our names and addressed us by them during the meal.  He was an honest server and didn't just say that everything was great however when he knew of a similar but better dish he offered that which is a wonderful quality.

We finished with the donuts which was a recommendation from the server.

I 100% will dine again at STK and ask for Paul.  Even overhearing the server at the table next to us their experience was so different.  

The environment is ambient and perfect for any special occasion or just a business dinner.  The only thing I disliked was that there was a bathroom attendant.  Being a female I don't really care for you to stand there and open the door to the restroom for me.

I was confused when told STK was a nightclub with food. We arrived around 7 to a restaurant lounge vibe and left around 10 to loud club music and dancing around us. This place definitely changes atmosphere so pending your intention of the meal, don't expect good conversation later in the evening... it gets loud. Our server was very personable and lovely, over all wonderful experience. Perfect place to dine before heading out to dance, high energy. 

PEAR & ENDIVE SALAD - 14
I'm pretty sure I got punched with a block of blue cheese, which for me was mortifying. If you're a blue cheese fan, you'll die and go to heaven with this salad... otherwise you'll just die.

***** TUNA TARTARE - 19
My friend (and chef) was right in highly recommending this (as do I for you). A wake up call to my mediocre tuna tartare experiences. The grade of the tuna was sushi status. I can't explain how smooth, silky and fresh each bit was. 

FOIE GRAS FRENCH TOAST - 24
This combo had me tilting my head but surprisingly enough, it worked. The green apple, almond brioche and sherry gastrique were a tasteful medley. 

BUTTERNUT SQUASH ANGOLOTTI - 15
Great little pillows of comfort food like happiness. 

COWBOY RIB STEAK 34 oz - 85
PORTERHOUSE 24 oz - 65
True to our medium rare request -- savory and seasoned minimally as a great steak should be. Fantastic.
SAUCES - We chose Chimichurri & Au Poivre. The Chimichurri was my favorite but both went well with the steak. Great in complimenting but not covering its natural taste. 

MARKET FISH - Market Price
A trio of seafood is served with this dish - the two fish were cooked traditionally and well. But the scallop. Oh the scallop. That heavenly luscious sweet thing of a scallop. Served on a little bed of peas and bacon pieces, seared perfectly. I was made fun of for chasing a pea around for what seemed to be 5-minutes, my laughing with everyone didn't help as my fork was vibrating with giggles (stubbornness kicked in as well on getting the damn thing) .. but if you manage to cut a piece of scallop, snag a bacon and spear a pea on the same fork ... it's a magnificent thing to behold.

***** COLORADO LAMB CHOPS - 39
Don't mind me while I sway to the now turned up club music with my lamb chop in hand. I mentally restrained myself from literally picking up the bone to attack the last few nibbles. Thank God the server took the plate away, I was growing weaker to temptation with every sip of my manhattan. Possibly my favorite lamb experience, which is huge as if I had to choose one meat for the rest of my life, it'd be lamb. Ordered and served at medium rare. Their pomegranate vinaigrette was subtle yet so perfect in bringing out hidden flavors seamlessly yet distinguishably. 

::: SIDES :::

BREAD
Everyone gets this. It's smothered in cheese and to be dipped in a green sauce. Messy to eat but very good! It reminded me of an oversized muffin. A couple of us (as we had 2 loaves brought out) did get hit with the stinky sock bite due to concentrated cheese.. so be careful of the piece you grab.

SWEET CORN PUDDING
I grew up loving cream of corn. This reminded me of it but way, way better. For such a simple dish, I loved it.

CREAMED SPINACH
Almost a tad bit too creamed for me but the flavor was good.

CREAMY YUKON POTATOES
Really great side dish to cut the meats and intense flavors.

:::ALCOHOLISM:::

MANHATTAN
When you think of this drink you think of an old guy. Let's ramp it up and drop this old guy in the middle of Manhattan rush hour with this cocktail in hand trying to cross the street at a green light, no spilling. Yeah -- it's that strong and intense. And the cherry at the bottom, pretty sure it soaks up 25% of the liquor so be weary of the face you make while consuming. With that said... definitely my kind of drink.

WINE
We ordered a bottle of a full bodied dry cab which blew my mind. Paired with the meats it really pulled everything together. We also ordered a delicious bottle of pinot gris for paring with the seafood. Solid wine list. You'll be happy if you're a wino here.",eljhhVxhJBgYl_rhZ-r6kA,4,2,4,ROdcSZmUyrNTVpCAyVbisw
3282754,2016-03-06,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I was in Vegas last weekend celebrating my 29th year of awesomeness with a friend of mine who had never experienced Vegas before. Said friend wanted to treat me to a fancy steak dinner, per my request, and I chose STK at The Cosmopolitan. Being a huge fan of the Hollywood location, I was more than excited to check out the Vegas venue. We made reservations on a Friday night for the following Saturday night. Make reservations, this place gets crowded fast.

We arrived Saturday night a few minutes early to our reservation and had glasses of wine while we waited for our table. The restaurant was filled with young folks dressed to impress with a DJ spinning hits all wrapped up in a dimly lit purple hued dining room. Just my kinda scene. Very similar to the Hollywood location. The hostess whisked us to our seat promptly and we sat down to order before we could even finish our first glass of wine.

Browsing through the menu, we decided to share a large portion instead of getting two smaller ones. We went big and got the largest steak option, The Cowboy Rib Steak, at a whopping 34oz for $100. Hey, it's Vegas so expect to shell out coins for stuff. On top of that, we got sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus. While we waited for our food, we were served table bread and nibbled on that while we conversed and watched the booming dining room come alive with people holding their drinks and dancing around. Great time.

Food came out in about 20 minutes and looked amazing. Perfectly medium rare cuts of meat and a heaping portion. The sides were great also. I went in for another glass of wine mid meal because I like to get TURNT with dinner. Our server was constantly checking on us, even with having a pretty busy section (right across from us was a party of 15 or so people). Our meal altogether was roughly $200 and I think it was worth every penny. Though next time, I'd probably skip the asparagus and go for the mac and cheese. That sh*t looked amazing!

If you wanna drop some cash on some great food, nightlife vibes and excellent service while you're in Vegas, do STK. Just make a reservation. Unless you like waiting. I hate waiting.

So I'll start with the best dish!!!
The sweet potato donuts are AMAZING!
I'm going to try not to sneak back down later this evening for my very own plate :) make sure you save room for those. Or start with them. Might as well insure you have room.
For dinner...
We ordered the filet rare. It was tender and delicious. 
The fish of the day was sea bass and it was buttery with a crispy outer layer. Amazing!
We ordered 4 sides
The creamed corn, my husband said it was his favorite. It was a little more like a souffl√© in my opinion. Good taste, sweet but a little fluffy, not like southern creamed corn.
Mashed potatoes- Creamy and delicious.
Macaroni and cheese- Flavorful.
Broccolini- tasty.
The other dessert we had was the pana cotta. Hmmm, not great, sadly. 

The sides were good. Not to die for but yummy. Usually the sides have me oohing and awing. The main courses were very yummy. 
This was probably my 2nd time here in Vegas and we probably dine at the LA location yearly. So I'm sure we will be back. 
It's a great restaurant for special occasions. I love the atmosphere, very fun.

We were then seated and although the server took a bit long to welcome us, he made up for it through the night. I think his name was Collin? Definitely request him, if you can! 

I got the seared tuna and usually tuna can be dry even if it gets just a bit overcooked but this tuna was perfection! One of the best tuna dishes I've ever had! Can't really comment on everyone else's dishes but they look yummy and everyone seemed to enjoy them.

Upon walking up the music was so loud I almost thought it was a night club. We had to wait about 15 min for a table even with a reservation which was fine because we were not in a hurry. We were finally led to our table but were left there and were told to hold and not sit down as there was some confusion about how many place settings had been put down. I ended up just telling everyone to sit because we all looked stupid just standing there. A server came and removed the extra place settings which was nice and it made things more comfortable. I wish I could say more about our server, but I honestly never heard anything he said as the music was too loud. Literally I didn't hear anything he said ... maybe the specials not sure ... I heard something about several butters??  But I don't know.  There was a DJ preforming and it was so loud ! Tupac, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars ... just a plethora of different music . It was so loud we couldn't hear anything ! But still thought it was fun. A different women came around and took our order not sure who she was ? She was very nice and sweet but I couldn't hear her either lol.  I had the filet medallion it was 6oz and perfectly cooked and was the perfect portion. 2 others got the fillet one said it was ""ok"" the other said it was the best thing he had ate in his life. Granted he was from England and the food is terrible so not sure if he can be trusted lol. I would say it was pretty good. One person said their steak was tough , I kept hearing a lot of ""it was ok"" all night. My sister had a 10oz fillet and she literally could not cut into this thing ! The knife was not sharp I had to sit there and watch her hacking away at this meat like she was Hannibal Lecter ""Hello Clarise"" lol all while "" Despasito"" was burning my ears in the background. The sides were small and 15$ a piece! The sauces on the steak were also extra, but I stick to the idea that if the steak is good it doesn't need sauce. We did get a free dessert and at the end the experience was so strangely unforgettable we couldn't stop taking about it the next day.",9FcscY73B6VJ6tad5OrWSQ,0,0,3,eCv6aAAfeOyAXrx3LaKaZg

It was very hyped up for me as the best steak in Vegas, but honestly, I would've preferred the steak at Bacchanal or at Bellagio. Actually, I had steak the night before at The Henry and THAT was amazing.

I ordered one of the most expensive steaks on the menu here at STK - an 8 oz cut of wagyu. Got foie gras on top as well, and a side of mashed potatoes ($12 for a small cup...). Also ordered the sliders they're supposedly famous for.

The sliders were very good, but overpriced.

The wagyu was not tender and flavorful at all. My friend got the ribeye and it was significantly better, but still not as good at The Henry's (so I still wouldn't come back to STK even to get something else). The foie gras wasn't very good, and we sent it back to cook further, which improved it but we've still all had better. Finally, the mashed potatoes were good, but at $12 for such a small amount, it wasn't worth remembering.

Overall, our meal was nearly $160 for 2 small sliders, 8 oz. wagyu which didn't even taste like wagyu, foie gras, and mashed potatoes. Was totally not worth it.",i-DWCn1Xk5-exHi0mBDO1g,1,0,2,k2GBArHShVVwLtcnHoYD3g

From everything that I've read and heard, the loud head-pounding music can be a turn off for those who yearn for a romantic candle-lit dinner, where you can actually hear each other conversate and not just pretend to be. So my tip for you would be book your reservation at a really early time, our was for 5:30pm. 

I requested a booth so that we could have more seating and arm room. My request was readily accounted for. Our server was really sweet and genuine. I had to wait for a cocktail for over 30min even though the place was not quite packed yet, but I guess they had to go fetch a watermelon, so she told me the cocktail would be on the house. I appreciated the nice gesture, and that my cocktail was being freshly made. 

We started off with the beef carpaccio w/ pesto angel hair, fried lobster tail and crab salad w/ honeydew and grapefruit. Everything was delish, and balanced each other very nicely. 

The hubby chose the porterhouse and I ended up w/ the bone-in-filet topped w/ Foie gras. Sides were truffle Parmesan fries, brocollini and corn pudding. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, but the Stk sauce that we chose didn't complement it very well. I wished our steak was seasoned just a bit more, so that no sauce was needed. After our request for A1 came, it made everything so much better!! The corn pudding had too much fillers and not enough corn so I would skip out on that next time. I loved my thick cut truffle fries, but it was way too pungent tasting for the hubs. 

As for dessert, we just had to get the sweet potato donuts! We were so full, but luckily the donuts were light and airy. We had an enjoyable evening, but I'm not sure if we would be back w/ all the many Vegas options there is that we have yet to try.",guUCJCKcLcCrmOjqspyycQ,3,0,4,Bvs5490G9AAxrbZuu8d4bw

The best part was the butter poached crab legs we added to the meal. It was totally worth it.

3332760,2016-06-13,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"What an outstanding brunch at STK.  I came during restaurant week so the menu came priced at $30 with options from starter, entree, and dessert sections.  The choices were kale salad and salmon bites to start, brunch club sandwich, pancakes, and prime rib hash for entrees, and cookies and milk or donuts for dessert.  We decided to try as much as possible so we each ordered differently, excluding the pancakes.

We began with a complimentary champagne and the bread basket that came with an icing dipping sauce.  Unique bread offering, especially giving it a dessert feel to begin and end the meal.  The portions are enormous at every stage of the morning.  The kale salad was easily a meal on its own and as good as it gets.  The smoked salmon crackers with cream cheese had a full fish with the amount of lox they plated.  And these were just the starters.

The club sandwich came with plantain-like sweet potato fries and four double decker cuts.  The avocado was a great addition to this dish.  The prime rib hash came with a couple of poached eggs and some hash browns underneath with a nice sauce.  Out of those two, I would recommend the hash, especially since STK is still the Cosmo go to steak house, brunch or not.  But both are great options and enough to take home for a meal later in the day for sure.

The dessert - just plain ridiculous.  The donuts come 6 to a plate and are just well made, fresh offerings.  The milk and cookies (get this dessert!) comes with a medium sized vanilla milkshake (one of the best I've ever tasted), and 10 cookies.  Ours included gingerbread, chocolate chip, and powdered.  I believe it is based on chef's choice though.  Their dessert game is spot on from the opening bread to the ending platter.  I usually don't order dessert at restaurants, but I am really glad I came during restaurant week to experience this treat.

The atmosphere in the restaurant itself is very clubby with an active DJ during the 11am-2pm brunch time.  It didn't seem like a too crowded restaurant for brunch (maybe Eggslut's opening was taking some buzz) but it really should be.  I will most definitely be back to try other brunch offerings or for dinner to stuff my face once again.  It's not your typical high end, classy joint ambiance-wise (prices are on par, however), but still a fantastic meal.

Started out with not being able to book online because it kept saying ""reservation not available within 2.5 hours of your requested time.""  Before giving up I thought it was worth a try to call the restaurant directly.  I was beyond thrilled when the host said ""yes we have a table available""!! 
On the day of my reservation we arrived 30 minutes early but we were seated promptly so that was good.  Our waitress Leslie was pleasant and helpful with giving recommendations. 
We ordered and our food came out quick.  I estimated it took no more than 15 minutes after we ordered. We ordered the scallop for appetizer, the lobster Mac and Cheese, and broccollini for our sides, and I ordered the special of the day ribeye.  Although they told us to be careful the plate is hot, nothing on our table was ""hot""!!! From the plate to our food!!! I mean it was ""warm"" but not hot!! I paid an extra $12 for the topping for my steak, and honestly that topping is included at other restaurants. But at STK you pay for the steak and the topping?!?! And as for the steak.... it was just OK. 
The ambiance is just OK as well; Normal restaurant atmosphere.

we started with the foie gras french toast which was pretty good. i had the NY Strip which i ordered medium rare, it came out med+.  no biggie, if the steak is good, it will stand up to being overcooked.  now i said 'if' and this one did not qualify.  It was under seasoned and really lacked any intense beef flavor.  I'm assuming that at the prices they charge, that the beef was dry aged, but it really didn't taste like it had been.  very lame for a $50 steak.

the wine list was horrifically overpriced, even by vegas standards. we had a bottle of Justin Cabernet which is about $25 retail...it was $100.  4x retail is just absurd.

We had a central booth that comfortably fit our large party. As others have mentioned, the music is very loud but I didn't feel it overpowered our conversation and we all enjoyed the ambiance - it is Vegas after all! Our waiter was attentive and mentioned at the beginning of our service that the bar was backed up and it might be awhile until we get our drinks. No big deal. We placed our orders - salads as starters and various cuts of steaks for each member of the party. One of our favorite parts of the meal was the table bread and whatever the ridiculously magical green dipping sauce was that came with it - yum! My husband and I shared a blue cheese wedge salad - good, but nothing to write home about. For my entree, I ordered the 10 oz. filet with truffle butter on top. The steak was good, but I have eaten at enough wonderful steak restaurants to know that I have definitely had better. I'm also not sure the truffle butter was worth an additional $12. We also ordered a few sides for the table - our party seemed to enjoy the truffle fries and lobster mashed potatoes.

The meal itself was fine, albeit not impressive, but at least we were enjoying ourselves. This is when things took a turn for the worse. We had paid the well over $1,000 bill and ordered one additional round of drinks to savor the last few minutes of my birthday celebration. At this point, we had been at the table for a reasonable amount of time to feed 9 people, and like I had mentioned earlier, the only holdup was waiting for our drinks to come from the bar. As we were still enjoying the last sips of our drinks, the waiter came over the our table, leaned down to me (who he knew was the birthday girl) and my sister-in-law, and bluntly said ""I'm gonna need your table"". We seriously could not believe our ears. I've never in my life experienced such unprofessional behavior, especially after just spending a significant amount of money on an already sub par meal. If we had been lingering at the table too long, I could maybe understand - I get that you are a busy restaurant and it was a Saturday night. But we had literally just paid the bill and had every right to still be at the table at the time he said this. Maybe a better way to approach the situation would have been to ask politely if we wouldn't mind moving to the bar. I am incredibly disappointed that we came here for my birthday dinner, and it will be a night to remember for all the wrong reasons. It is their responsibility to schedule their reservations with a reasonable amount of time for people to enjoy their meals and the company they are with. I made this reservation well over a month in advance, and this was totally unacceptable.

We have been to many steakhouses in Las Vegas (both of us are born and raised) and this was a steakhouse that neither of us has been to so we decided to go. We got sat in the ""loud"" part of the restaurant - I read reviews about the restaurant being loud but I never imagined that it would be that bad. My and fianc√© and I couldn't hear our own conversation. The waiter couldn't hear our food/drink order. However, I wouldn't be leaving this negative review if that was the worst thing that happened to us during our dinner because we can handle a loud atmosphere. Our time at STK continued to get worse and worse. Our waiter, Joe, provided us with the worst service I could ever imagine. Bread was delivered to our table 10 minutes before our drink orders we taken and 20 minutes before our food order was taken. Our drinks took forever. I ordered a glass of red wine and my fianc√© ordered a Blanton's Old Fashioned. The Old Fashioned was poorly made - you think a bartender would put some attention into a $29 drink. His drink was overfilled and watered down with crushed ice. It was clear that the bartender puts zero pride into what he does. A food runner brought us our food less than 10 minutes after we ordered it.  Which was very bizarre. I don't know of any restaurant that can prepare 2 steaks, a lobster tail, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach in less than 10 minutes...unless this food is being mass produced in the kitchen and is not made to order. The food runner asked who ordered the skirt steak. Neither of did. But he decided to put the skirt steak down in front of me.  My fianc√© ordered a filet and lobster tail - there was no butter or lemon with the lobster tail. And the lobster tail was hardly a lobster tail. It was the smallest, most pathetic lobster tail I have ever seen. My fianc√© and I actually laughed at it. The presentation of both of our meals was terrible - my filet looked like a hamburger patty. Our waiter NEVER came to ask us how our food was. The food was mediocre. The bread was only thing worth the money because it was great (funny because it's free). My steak had the quality of a grocery store steak. The creamed spinach was really green...typically creamed spinach is green (obviously) with white creamy sauce throughout. This creamed spinach was so bizarre. It was almost like this creamed spinach was old and the green from the spinach was bleeding into the white sauce. Or maybe STK has a different recipe for their creamed spinach, I don't know. The creamy Yukon potatoes were good. We decided to push through our terrible service and food and not let either of those things ruin our special day.  But it continued to get worse! I saw Joe walk passed our table countless times without ever checking on us. At one point he even looked at my empty wine glass - but kept moving. A food busser cleared our table. We sat with empty drinks for about another 15 minutes. We decided to skip dessert because at that point, we really just wanted to get out of there. Joe handed me a dessert menu and we declined. It took Joe 24 minutes to bring us our $230 bill. I insisted that my fianc√© ask for a manager to complain but he refused because it would have just made our night worse having to take it to that extreme. My fianc√©'s credit card sat on our table for another 10 minutes before a waiter (who was not our waiter) came and grabbed it.

In conclusion, our food and service was not worth $230. It's awful that my fianc√© and I woke up today and the first thing we said to each other was how terrible our dinner was.  That is what prompted me to write this review.  If you want to spend over $200 at a steakhouse, please message me and I can give you some great recommendations.",maZZztYqMQjDBsZKr95xJg,6,0,1,FWaK5tcNJl-RKcw6dut1pA

Coupled with some nice red's, the great girls behind the bar, and the scenery all around, STK is just a great night out in Vegas. Shady has been a regular here since it opened 3 years ago, and as long as Shady's ladies are there, so is Shady.

Making a reservation here was a bit difficult as I understand it, but we had a nice big table for the 7 of us. Service is definitely slow, though. I don't think our waiter came over to greet us let alone find out if we wanted alcohol, water, or anything for a good 15- 20 minutes. If this were my parents' dinner, they'd have walked out. But we were slightly more patient, instead asking the bus boy to bring us water. A few of the other girls had time to go to the bar and order cocktails and seat themselves again before our waiter decided to come on over. 

Food wise, we shared a variety of appetizers. The scallops were yummy, but the toast they sat on was soggy. The carpaccio was very yummy. The burrata salad was nice, but super salty. Entree wise, I had the sole and it was nice with a light sauce and capers. I also sampled the sea bass, which I actually thought tasted a lot better, though. And the steak was sort of this sad hunk of meat on a plate with no sauce to finish it or any garnish. I realize veggies come on the side, but couldn't they make the steak at least look appetizing? 

All in all, the food was nice but it wasn't amazing. And the service was just slow. If I can walk to the bar across the room, order a drink and get it before a waiter decides to even check on us, that's not a good sign. I do recommend the people watching, though.",pQIADDOm1H1Yd04VDQfUbA,1,0,3,dBXzMT4Xgwak3mIzrQD2Xg

The scene is always great, very fun vibe and good people watching. We went to dinner on Sunday and drinks on Tuesday and it was extremely busy both times with well dressed, attractive people. 

The food is very good with consistent quality to other STK restaurants. Our table ordered a seafood platter which was delicious and very fresh and everyone ordered a steak for the main meal. I had the 10oz filet cooked medium rare, which was perfectly cooked. A number of people at our table ordered truffle butter on their steak, which was recommended by the waitress. They said it was amazing. We also ordered creamed spinach, asparagus, Mac and cheese, and the corn side dishes which were all very well done. 

The cocktails are good, and slightly unique takes on classics. The wine selection is also quite good; I really enjoyed the rose champagne as a pre-dinner drink. 

The food is good, but expensive. Although when going to high end restaurants in Vegas, it is to be expected. I think this restaurant has the best vibe in all the restaurants at the Cosmo hotel.

Oh, but forget that and focus in on the food. Much of the menu items might sound familiar, but STK interprets these dishes their own way. 

A friend and I dined here for an early dinner. We were seated by the hostess at a tiny table, which was closely situated next to other tiny tables. It was impractical and not intimate to say the least, but we dealt with it. 

Appetizer - Bread: Compliments of the restaurant, we received pull-apart bread slathered with blue cheese butter, served in a small cast iron plate. 

Appetizer - Seared Foie gras: This was like eating breakfast for dinner. The foie gras was accompanied by three miniature pancakes and marmalade. Delightful. 

Entree - Seared Big Eye Ahi: This was heavily seasoned with a Japanese spice that proved to be too hot for my gut to handle. Our server gladly had my dish remade without seasoning, and served with the wasabi mashed potatoes and miso sauce on the side. Overall, my meal  was exceptional, and I especially liked the wasabi mash. 

Dessert - Chocolate Chip Cookie with Ice Cream- This was one hot cookie topped with vanilla ice cream that can be shared by two people. The cookie was baked and presented in another  mini cast iron pan. It was a delicious way to top off dinner.

STK has become one of my favorite restaurants at The Cosmopolitan. I do recommend coming here to experience dinner. The downside, as I've mentioned, is the seating. Reservations are encouraged.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,8,6,4,2TkTwcPeHgVlcUp7akj3Gw

Visiting Vegas for the week from NYC where I have had great experiences at their midtown NYC location. This restaurant had sub-par food, steaks, sides and overall prices really didn't justify the costs. 

Coming from someone who lives in NYC, I'm not one to complain about things that cost more than usual, it's just that when our steaks came, they weren't rich and flavorful like they tasted at the other location. I asked my three other dinner companions and they all agreed whole-heartedly that it was a pretty big disappointment.

My last comment is on the restaurant itself. Compared to other locations, it seems like they really didn't invest much to pump the ambience, it's lit up bright.",WJ8FSLaLHx6q5QPLQo53TA,0,0,2,qW2dDIRhEIma6kLYOxrocw

Food was spot on delish! Tried the French Toast and Foie Gras and loved the grilled apple on the side. So good and just enough for our small table to share.  The bread and butter they serve is very yummy, so don't pig out on that before your fabulous food arrives.

I had a filet and it was PERFECT! it had a beautiful char on the outside and melt like butter inside your mouth effect! I usually love to eat my steaks with truffle butter but I opted for some simple horseradish sauce this time and it was bomb. The table also ordered filets, porterhouse, bone in filet.  All good.  Sides: carrots that were sweet and plenty, the mushroom pot pie was not as flavorufl as I was expecting but it was a huge portion as well.

The food though left a bit to be desired. The filet I ordered was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The sides though were where the star falls off. We ordered a wide array and nothing really stood out.

Other places around town try to pull off the same ""cool kid"" vibe but, unlike those spots, STK has some great food. I've heard from others how loud it can get, but we dined on a Tuesday night and, while it was busy, the music was at a decent volume -- low enough that we didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation. I was hoping to sit in the main dining area where they have nothing but booths, but we were seated in front of the bar in a loungey-type area with mostly 2- and 4-tops.

The bleu butter bread that they start you out with was warm, fresh, and delicious. The half-dozen Kusshi oysters ($18) we had next were mild, meaty, and excellent. The pea agnolotti ($15) had an overpowering pea taste and, unfortunately, not enough of the goat cheese or pistachios that accompanied it. 

The final appetizer we had was their tuna tartare ($19). Sure, it's a common dish found in almost every restaurant these days, but their version is very good. Fresh chunks of tuna were sitting in a corn tuille, which added a bit of sweetness to the dish and a crunchy texture. The avocado cream under the tuille had cayenne pepper (I think?) that added a kick.

My wife has been eating less and less lately, so we split the 14 oz. bone-in filet ($52). Wow! You had me at ""bone-in""... drool-worthy, nom-worthy... hell, it's even sponge-worthy. One of the most tender and amazing filets I've had. We got the blue butter sauce with it, but really there was no need to put anything else on the steak.

We got a side of haricot vert ($10) -- or green beans as ordinary folk like me call it -- that was tasty and firm. Not the slightest bit overcooked or soggy. The portions are large, so plan on sharing among three or four.

Service was a bit spotty. Our waiter was nice enough, but he had at least six tables and was constantly running around. Meaning we didn't see him often. We sat around for almost half an hour before ordering our food. A little help for the wait staff might not be a bad idea.

For all you Top Chef fans, Stephen Hopcraft (formerly of Michael Mina's Seablue) is the executive chef. But, whether you're a fan of the show or not, the bone-in filet is reason enough to stop by.

We came here for our 4 year anniversary dinner! Located inside Cosmo hotel on the same floor as Secret Pizza...it had a dark, classy-club/lounge feel.

They offered complimentary pull apart bread and chive oil, which was soo good! The bread was a little hard but the chive oil totally made up for it, we were soaking it all up with our bread! We asked for seconds to take home too. :p 

We ordered..

6oz Filet Medallion $41 -perfectly cooked to medium rare! I added truffle butter ($12) and seared foie gras ($18) to it too. -oh gluttony! 

20oz Bone in Rib Steak $57 -perfectly cooked to medium, topped with caramelized jalape√±o onions ($6) and seared foie gras ($18). 

..and our sides $13/each 

Mac n Cheese -good, made with ditalini shaped pasta on a cast iron skillet. Came out super cheesy and bubbling! (they had a lobster mac n cheese special too)

Parmesan Truffle Fries -soo disappointing. They looked so crispy..appealing..but nope, when I took a bite, it was like biting into an undercooked baked potato. It was extremely dense and lacked any seasoning. I didn't taste the truffle either! :( 

Mushroom Pot Pie -the concept was cool but the puff pastry on top didn't do much for the dish. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked in a nice, creamy sauce. 

Jalape√±o Cheddar Grits -extremely green, jalape√±o flavored and cheeeesy! 

We skipped out on the appetizers since we had so many sides. I do want to try the crispy lobster tails, hamachi crudo and seared foie gras next time around!

The ambiance is different than most fancy steakhouses. It is definitely a Vegas style restaurant as there is upbeat music playing in the background with dimmed red and blue lights throughout. Nothing to complain about when it comes to the service as we had people passing by every couple of minutes either checking in, refilling our drinks, or handing us our food. You feel like you are really being taken care of.

My boyfriend and I decided to share the rib eye steak and portion wise it was just right for the both of us. We honestly could have eaten a little less. We topped it off with the truffle butter and flavor wise it was perfect. Pretty good marbling on the steak with just the perfect amount of char. We love getting steak medium rare and I would say that my only complaint with this steak is that towards the center, it tended to get a bit too chewy for my liking. Ultimately not the best steak I've ever had.

The lobster Mac and cheese on the other had was pretty amazing. The perfect amount and cheese and cream in this dish that there wasn't a single flavor that overshadowed the others. There was a good amount of lobster in the dish that was cooked to be the perfect texture and not too tough.  

The truffle fries were good too. If you like more shoestring type of fries this is not the side for you. There are about 10 pieces of fries that are thick and square shaped. It was too much potato for me but it didn't lack in flavor. You can see in the picture I post how thick these fries are. Overall 3.5 stars for the steak but since both the lobster Mac and cheese and our service was outstanding I gave the place 4 stars.",YxWG-OtTP8B8CSdih8Fbcw,0,1,4,GkZmOjixdd1k6CLFgJcLnA

It seemed more like a medium to medium well. Since this is a steak house, I had to take off points for overcooking the steak. 

I had the garden salad and our table shared broccolini, spiced maple carrots, and the lobster mac and cheese. Delicious. 

The service was great. The ambiance and music was fantastic. But seriously?? If I'm paying that much for a steak, grill it the way I want it.",lsyQyTlLiPIJN76Xfqf4JA,1,1,4,61L-m2kKIYIt7tOCwO9Z6w

Once was on a Friday night, the other a Monday. Both were busy, and both nights there was a dj playing in the center of the dining room. Lots of booth seating, which is nice for an intimate date or small group. 

The menu is average (steaks, salads, mac n cheese, fish dishes, etc). Our service was good both nights, however 3 of us ordered steaks and they were a little over done. 2 of us didn't mind, however my husband sent his back. The server was very accommodating and replaced it. Kind of a bummer though, since it took a while and he ended up eating it alone at the end.

The experience was nice and there were good vibes but the food wasn't all that. The first issue could be that I don't eat steak but ... ah ... sue me. 

I started the night off with a glass of wine. It wasn't bad but not my favorite because they really didn't have a sweet wine. Next the waiter bright out bread with a pesto sauce. The bread was very good. The sauce added a nice touch to it. After wine and bread we placed our orders for entrees. I had fish( the fish itself came with small diced potatoes with a lemon caper sauce) with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The fish wasn't bad. The creamed spinach wasn't that good. I absolutely love Ruth's Chris Creamed Spinach and when I saw it on the STK menu I got really excited. I guess I assumed it would taste like Ruth's Chris and it didn't and I was disappointed. The mashed potatoes were just mashed potatoes, nothing special.

3562756,2015-04-03,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Get ready to get dolled up and have a FABULOUS dinner.  This is by far the best dining experience we've had in Vegas. 

My husband and I love all things foodie (although - we prefer not to refer to ourselves as such, as it makes us feel obnoxious!).  So when we go to Vegas, the main thing we seek out for entertainment is dining at high-end restaurants.  Screw gambling, I'd rather eat my money away than gamble it away. 

We've had some amazing dinners out in Vegas, but this one was by far the best experience we've had, from food to service - all things were on point. 

SERVICE:

Our waitress was such a sweetheart, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She offered some suggestions when we inquired about the menu, and also proposed an order for things to come out.  The timing and order of everything was perfect; we were never bombarded by food, and the wait between courses was never very long.  

The others on the wait staff were also very attentive.  Our waters were never empty, our tables were always folded if we left to use the bathroom facilities, and any time our cocktails/wine was looking low, there was someone there to offer us another.  

FOOD: 

Caesar Salad (4 stars) - Don't know how they did it, but even the Caesar salad was rememberable.  The lettuce was so crisp/fresh, and the dressing and croutons were remarkably tasty.



Spiced Pickled Prawns (5 stars) - Hands down the best starter/non-beef item of the night.  Actually, ranks right up there with the steak with how much I truly enjoyed this item.  The two are just apples and oranges, so hard to really compare the two. Anyway, I will get this EVERY time I'm here.  The shrimp was perfectly crisp (not the dense/gritty texture that you sometimes find with some shrimp when they've been completely overcooked) and SO fresh.  Also, loved the balance of acidity with the level of heat.  I love heat, so I ended up eating all of the slices of jalapeno pepper it came with (my husband avoided those, and enjoyed his level of heat without them)

Lobster Cocktail (3.5 stars) - This was good, but in comparison to everything else, not rememberable.  We would forego this item next time.

Bone-in Filet (5 stars) - Holy crap, the star of the night.  Definitely enough steak to split between the two of us.  So amazing, and perfectly cooked to our requested rare-medium/rare.

Pork Belly (3 stars)  -  This item came along with the steak and fries toward the end of our meal.  It was delicious, but I wish it had more crispiness (I'm not a huge fan of pork belly unless it's been crisped up just right - the texture of chewy/soft fat makes me want to hurl).  Probably wouldn't order this item again.  Maybe would have ""shined"" a bit more if it wasn't brought out with the steak and fries, who knows.

Parmesan Truffle Fries (4.5 stars) - So full of truffle flavor, piping hot, crispy on the outside, and soft in the inside.  A must order for sides.

DRINKS:

Double Espresso - We rarely do coffee/dessert after dinner, but this one called for it.  The espresso (while very, very spendy!!) was perfection.  Don't think I'd get it again, however, as the price was gasp-worthy (something like $12-15 each for a small little espresso drink).

Manhattan - Very well balanced and tasty (per my husband); one complaint is they used a maraschino cherry (i.e., bright red) vs. a gourmet cocktail cherry.  That would have made the cocktail perfection in a glass.

Vodka Martini Up w/ Splash of St. Germain - Perfection in a glass; a signature of mine, I've found a lot of places over-do the St. Germain so it's too sweet and not to my liking.  This place nailed it (twice - oops!).

Glass of ""Justin"" Cabernet Savignon to pair with the steak ($4) - We'd tried a bottle of Justin red blend previously (retails around $40-50 a bottle), so we decided to try out the cab.  We were not disappointed, and it paired very nicely with the filet.

OVERALL: 

Fantastic dinner experience.  An experience indeed.  Will definitely be back; and have also through out the idea of stopping into STK NYC when we're out there next month.",1A-geB-PQr1uveSFOS7Feg,2,1,5,e2xXoQ7BcmwlG_yYOPs2qg

First, the service was slow !!!!!!!!!!!!! We had to wait for half an hour for the NOT amazing food! We ordered 7 steaks and 3 of them were overcooked. We ordered medium rare but they came out with almost well, they were so dry! We told the server, she took them back to the kitchen and gave us new ones.  The second time, they gave us rare (but we want medium rare), meat were still cold inside! Super disappointing!!!!!! Totally NOT worth that price! 

For side orders, wild mushrooms, mac and cheese, mushroom hot pie were good with no suprise. For the asparagus, they were just plain! I think they just boiled the asparagus with water then put several drips of something like soy sauce on top. They didn't even grill them or putting some seasoning on. And it costs $12! 

We went with all excitements after reading all those good reviews. After this experience, I WON'T go back for sure.",2xLh45P0UgbSywY2DhQImg,0,0,1,RQSxiKVVpSZt2fEmRebqLw

3590860,2011-07-24,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I had really high expectations for STK.  After being in meetings all day and only feasting on mediocre breakfast and lunch buffets, I was really looking forward to a steak.  
Our large group had reservations for an early dinner, and it didn't take long to get a table.  If you have an option, sit in the elevated level with booth tables.  It is more private, and not down in the noisy bar level.  
The wine by the glass list is tiny, with only one Pinot Noir option (wait, this is a steak place?).  Not very many beers on tap either, and those in the bottle were not impressive.  
I ordered the small filet medallion medium.  It came out very WELL done, and dry.  At this point it had been over an hour and I was starving so I just ate it and didn't say anything.  Even the blue cheese butter couldn't save the meat.  My co-workers bone-in ribeye was decent so I would say go for that.
Sides are served family style, and each side could serve 2 to 3 people.  The parmesan truffle fries were a winner, crisp and flavorful.  The creamed spinach was ok, but not as good as other steak houses.  The sweet corn pudding was more gravy with little bits of corn occasionally.  Rudy's BBQ in TX could teach this place a thing or two about corn.

My fiance and I went to this ""restaurant"" and it was are first time at the cosmo, we were on vacation and it was her first time and mine as an adult and this was about a year ago and this encounter has bugged me ever since which is saying a lot because I never write reviews and I also never hold grudges. As interesting as the previous reviews stated is why we decided to check it out. Upon first entry NO ONE seemed happy to be there (staff that is) we were not greeted, we were asked if we had a reservation right off the bat with great attitude from the hostess (she should have started with at least Hi!). When we mention we didn't have a reservation she became even more sassy with us and stated if there is seating at the bar its first come first serve, which of  course was packed. We went back to the counter and asked if we could make a later reservation and the simply said ""no"" did't bother asking for a time or date she assumed we meant that night. We saw a few people leave and we thought we'd take one more look at the bar, followed by a rather large ""manager"" asking us if we had a reservation in a gruff and an intimidating tone in hopes to steer us away because we didn't have a reservation.

This place as the food may be good ( although we never go to that part, so i can't say it is or not) the customer service or lack there of has made me want to write my first review.

The steak also comes with a few vegetables on the side which was decent.

They also give out fresh bread as an appetizer.  Luckily they ask if you want the Blue Cheese with it because the bread is really stinky with the Blue Cheese and really good without it.  So I recommend no Blue Cheese and just ask it with a side of butter.

All of us ordered some form of steak, and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  I topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven!  I'm still very upset that CA banned it!

- No the warmest welcome for high end restaurant by the hostesses
- VERY high price for OK+ food (12 truffle fries for 12$, come on!)
- Not a very attentive staff - asked for ""easy on parmesan for the fries"" and got them completely covered
- Waiting time to get the food - was 45mins for 3 steaks... We were about to leave.
- Tiny bathroom! long waiting line for ladies and men!
- the worse part is the music! WAY TOO LOUD! I did not enjoy the restaurant ambiance at all because we were not able to talk and hear each other.

I DO NOT recommend this restaurant",AbqzHqLCOPEfKHZA3erfVA,2,2,2,YMwubVPfkEz0pTWyUIcQxw

Nice vibe with loud music gives it a more playful setting from the conventional steakhouses.

Cocktails were so-so, a bit light-handed on the gin. Pinot noir 'cherry pie' was great. 

Tried 14oz dry-aged delmonico rib eye steak with truffle butter. Great flavor!  Only a bit over-cooked for a medium rare.  The filet medallion 8oz was perfect.

Just because it's expensive (extremely) - doesn't mean it's good. Just because it's packed (with creepy wealthy checky outy old men) - doesn't mean it's hip.

The best part was the bread covered with blue cheese. I had the ribeye, it was just okay. The mushroom pot pie, which had rave reviews, was too rich and not enough pie. Mashed potatoes were gross. My client had a $20 martini that was served with a bitchy attitude by a bartender with fake tits.

Hip hop music was blasting; the walls were padded and sound proof; and there was a flat screen in there. Really interesting ambiance!

Anyways, our waiter was super funny and good-looking. (Wouldn't expect anything else from STK/Cosmo). Service was great because he was fun, informative, and even took a couple shots with us...of which he paid for! I'm not sure u can drink on the job nor why he paid for them but, we'll take it.

Their bread was delicious!!!!! The bread's dipping sauce was amazing...looked like pesto and olive oil...
Their wine list was second to none. They had my favorite tequila! And their oysters were pretty fresh.
I had lamb. DUH! And it was ""eh.."" I mean, maybe I should've had s-t-e-a-k at a steak house but, alas, I've had better.

Way over staffed...which I'm sure had everything to do with the holiday and opening week...but they were just standing around like flies and chatting away...including management.  Didn't look professional and felt crowded.
There were only two restrooms that were unisex.  The attendant was not tending to them adequately.   The seats were wet and toilets weren't flushed.

Some interesting food items on the menu but only a couple lived up to their hype.  Sauces were disappointing in comparison to their house sauce and some proportions were off for the elaborate or eccentric culinary menu items they were trying to accomplish.

The steaks were cooked to true temp and very good quality and the blue cheese dressing was gourmet.

I didn't have a chance to look at the wines and the desert menu was minimal and not very creative.

3693963,2012-03-25,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"To celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday, we travelled to Las Vegas with two friends of ours. While there, I wanted to treat him to a stellar dinner and picked STK. I was a bit hesitant as a lot of reviewers have had mixed feelings and said that it's a loud spot for a nice dinner, but I'm really glad I went with my gut and picked STK. It wasn't romantic but definitely sexy.

When I made the reservation, I noted that our dinner was to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th. We arrived for our 8pm reservation time but were told that they were running behind and it would be about 25 minutes, so we were welcome to get a drink at the bar. (I suspect they tell everyone this to beef up their liquor sales.)

We were actually seated in about 15 minutes and were greeted by our very pleasant server. For dinner we picked the shrimp rice krispie squares, macaroni and cheese and the much-recommended mushroom pot pie. I ordered a filet medallion and he had the 16oz. striploin. All was incredibly delicious - especially the mushroom pot pie! It was to diiiiiie for!

While my boyfriend was in the washroom, I asked our server if we could get a dessert with a candle and she responded ""yeah of course - it's your boyfriend's 30th birthday, right?"" I was stunned! For the restaurant to pay attention to that reservation detail, remember it and relay the message to our server was highly impressive.

Apart from the food and dessert, we also had wine and cocktails. The selection is solid but not overwhelming.

While the noise level isn't exactly ""intimate"", STK had a lively vibe with most-excellent tunes. Every song that came on excited me, including '80s Madonna, UB-40 and even Tom Cochrane (being a Canadian, I was stoked). My only complaint might be the hostessing staff - there was something about their attitude that left a sour taste in my mouth, so thankfully the rest of our STK experience more than made up for it!

At the end of the day, we would most definitely find ourselves at STK again. It's not your everyday place to grab dinner (for the two of us for two glasses of wine, one martini, two steaks, an appetizer, two sides and a shared dessert it was $220 with tip), but most certainly worthy of special occasions.

Their in-house made bread with blue cheese and cilantro oil is delicious. It comes all warm and gooey. But if you don't eat it in 3 min, the bread will be as dry as an old woman's .... umm ya it gets super dry. 

Seriously though, STK has a pretty decent food but expensive. The cheapest cut is their skirt steak which starts around $40. All the sides are extra. Tiny piece of foie gras is $18. I am not a big fan of truffle fries but we tried them and they were pretty good. As I said before, the atmosphere is very loud. To the point that you have to yell for the other person.

the beet salad and the romaine salad which they both enjoyed. Next we moved onto the main event. I could not resist and ordered the 10oz filet with a glass of Malbec.

My friend Kiana ordered the Alaskan King Crab and Ashante, the Roasted Dover Sole, all of us? In heaven!  We also ordered sides of truffle macaroni and cheese and grilled asparagus. Each equally wonderful complements to our entrees.

otherwise and out came the STK Snickers.

The beef had a good flavor and texture, served with potato chips that were good. The Serrano ham appetizer was also great, soft, tasty, the melons, figs and jam tasted great.

Now the bad things. 

Service was spotty - not attentive enough for a place like this. They were friendly but inattentive at times.

The sommelier was more of a wine waiter - not warm and fuzzy at all. Many wines were out of stock, including the three least expensive Cabernet, the wines were brutally overpriced (well over 2x retail), and lists started at very high price points (most over $100). We only ended up with two bottles for the table, they were so so wines and were $80 each, and I've never until now not really enjoyed wines at this price point.

The steak - the can do raw steak just fine apparently, but then they go and cook it, what the heck? They were out of several steaks. The Australian Kobe steaks were priced OK, but I didn't get them (12 oz @ $140). Fillet Mignon was out. Annoying. So I got the porterhouse. The porterhouse on the strip side was not trimmed properly and the meat seemed to come from a bovine weightlifter. The fillet side was very good. But I was upset I couldn't just get fillet, the beef was trimmed wrong, and how un-marbled the strip side was. 

Lines at the restrooms, very annoying. There is clearly a problem with this restaurant handling the volume of people and their restroom needs. Build more restrooms.

Extremely loud. The DJ, the moron he is, didn't use headphones, so the volume just kept creeping up, it was at club level noises by the end. Screaming was needed to have a conversation. Who is the restaurant manager here, some idiot - I mean, I'm supposed to spend $140 on a steak and eat it 12 inches from a JBL bass cone thumping at  5 inches of deflection? Seriously?

-STEAK LOIN STRIP - so tender and juicy and delicious!!! omg this was amazing.
-MAC N CHEESE - omg i love their mac n cheese. GET IT!!! definitely worth it. 
-PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - these are not like your typical fries. they're short and chunky, but they bring them out and it has just the right amount of parmesan topping (some places over due the parmesan). Its super warm and crunchy on the outside while warm on the inside. 

DRINKS (5 out of 5)
-strawberry cobbler graham crackers drink - if you're a girl, and u dont like the taste of alcohol and like sweet drinks, definitely get this!!! this was one of the better drinks i've drank in my life from a restaurant place. 
-jack and coke - SUPER strong. they definitely give you your jack for your monies.
-stk orgy shot - $15/shot or something like that, but it was GOOD. esp for a girl who doesn't like the taste of alcohol. if you're here celebrating a special event and you're with a girl who can't take regular shots, definitely order this one!

ATMOSPHERE (4 out of 5)
I liked the atmosphere, but the one draw back was that the music was a lil loud. They were playing up to date music and nice remixes / mashups, which is nice. I'm not complaining about the music selection at all!! But the volume could have been turned down, especially for a Sunday night dinner. 
The waiters were incredibly social and super chill. They were having the time of their lives while serving us and dancing around and clapping while on the job. 

Perfect place to go for a pre-clubbing pre-outing atmosphere. If youre going to Marquee,  or a similar club , this is the perfect place for a pre-game dinner and drinks.  Also recommended if you're looking for a non-buffet, nice sit down restaurant to celebrate a special occasion with good music and good food (as long as you don't mind the volume)",n1pp7Kqj9p9HQACdbabkFQ,1,1,5,zN8VgL2tiGWch3u2ovf0ng

We arrived exactly 10 minutes late and we were seated at a very small table. They informed us the reason they didn't have a bigger table available was because of our 10 minute late arrival. Fine... It was almost impossible to get in contact with our waiter. He wasn't rude but just very very busy and with the loud music playing it made it even harder. I really enjoyed their choice of music but it was just too loud for restaurant. Especially a resturant where the waiters don't really go above and beyond to make sure you're party is ok. 

The food was actually pretty good not the best but pretty good. Our bill was about $600 but for that price I really wish the waiters and servers would've went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed ourselves and had everything we needed. 

Oh! Also, they charged us $25 for the birthday sparkler and a slice of cake I assumed it was free but it definatly showed up... I wish we knew ahead of time. Might of skipped it.",VXaBnhWFVs-Fidgyu3v2CQ,2,0,3,z4l3adCHzjdSuOrqX0J7AA

Inside of the Cosmopolitan, it's located on the restaurant level in an area away from all of the commotion of the casino. Everything that I've ever had here tastes amazing; you'll fall in love with food if you're not already a foodie.

Even though you can show up in jeans and a t-shirt, to enjoy the full experience, you'll want to dress up a bit. The professionalism of the service is excellent - you're never left needing anything.

From time to time, there's a bit of a wait (if you don't already have a reservation) so just outside there's a pool table you can hang out at and a few trendy lounge chairs to chill in.

I know it is tough for a wait staff to get stuck with a 10 top but you shouldn't feel like you are being herded through a chow line.  We ordered creamed spinach as a part of our main course and when they served it, they conveyed it was saut√©ed spinach.  When my wife asked if it was creamed spinach the other waiter conveyed he wasn't sure since he didn't serve it but given he had worked there for 5 years it looked like it to him. I conveyed that if he believed it was, that was fine, we just wanted to check.  His response came off snarky when it was simple/innocent question.  In total, the bill for my wife and I came to $300 and for the price we felt extremely rushed and hurried to leave.  Las Vegas prides itself on its service and this experience left me extremely disappointed.

On a side note I came back recently and it's really loud in there, but I like that they have a DJ also the steak and lobster was OK, not that great. The sides and small dishes are better. I wouldn't recommend the entrees here.

But I figured that was just for reservations and if I showed up they would seat me like usual. WRONG.

We showed up at 8:50pm for our 9pm reservation. The hostess welcomed us in and said they'd be with us in just a minute,  but didn't get seated until 9:40pm which was a little frustrating and we were seated right near the bar. Not the best location, however our server was super friendly, and attentive throughout the meal. We ordered a Hearts if Romaine (a Caesar salad) and a Blue Icewedge to start and they both showed up quickly with STK's signature Blue Cheese bread with chive oil (2 DIE 4!). The wedge was excellent, but the Caesar was almost tasteless and watery. The server sincerely apologized, but our food was coming out so he just comped the salad. 
I had the Hangar Steak and my wife the 6oz Filet.  Both were cooked and seasoned to perfection and super flavorful!  We also got the Mac & Cheese and Creamed Spinach for sides.  The Mac & Cheese was ooey & gooey with a great crunchy topping. The spinach was meh....nothing special and not very flavorful.

The Gin Fizz eventually showed. It was fantastic and with cucumbers too. Exactly as depicted and delicious. I asked a passing waiter if the music was muted below ear splitting and annoying in the dining area? He said it's not really loud. Apparently he didn't hear my question!!!!
We eventually entered the dining area and I ordered the Bone in Filet with Mac & Cheese, mushroom pie, asparagus after a soft shell crab salad which my wife and I split.

Unfortunately we will never eat here again and cannot recommend unless you already have perforated ear drums and enjoy Alka Seltzer as an after dinner drink to cure a headache!!!

Oysters - so-so, but this is always hit or miss

When we got to the restaurant, the first thing we noticed was the very chic vibe, hip music, and dim lighting. The energy in STK was very fun and exciting. We were seated shortly after arriving, but the first thing that came to our attention was the very cramped seating arrangements. My boyfriend was very uncomfortable since the tables were set very low (his knees easily hit underneath the table making any movement difficult). 

We decided to start the night off with two glasses of Pinot Noir after noticing that the wine menu was extremely limited, which definitely surprised me. We then asked our waiter if he would take a picture of us, and he rudely told us he would do it later. The service was not up to par to say the least. 

I ordered the Filet with King Crab Oscar. My filet was really good, but it was definitely not the best I've had. For sides, we ordered Bok Choy and Mac and Cheese with lobster. The Bok Choy had a nice, salty flavor; however, it was way too chewy to enjoy. The Mac and Cheese was probably some of the worst I've ever had. The flavor was horrible and there was one piece of lobster in entirety. 

My boyfriend's Bone in Filet was very fatty once he got closer to the bone. He did like the flavor, but only half of the filet was edible due to all of the fat. 

After dinner, we ordered more wine, along with cappuccinos and our waiter couldn't have been more thrilled to see that he had to continue serving us. He was pretty pissed. 

I won't be in a hurry to return. It seemed that the workers were more worried about dancing and talking to each other than serving their diners.

I ordered the medium filet mignon medium rare and it was quite dry and bland. My side was the jalapeno grits... Which weren't horrible but the grits had large clumps in it and lacked jalapeno flavor. My husband ordered the aged bone strip steak which was a tad better than mine however that's not saying much. His side was the Yukon mashed potatoes and to be generous it tasted like well made boxed potatoes.

Boyfriend: if I do good on the tables I'm going to take you to STK!
Me: What's that?
Boyfriend: A steakhouse. ..get it STK...steak...isn't that cool.
Me: Yes, that is so clever. Anyways it must be really expensive if you're depending on doing well on the table. 

So all week he's talking about this place and loses a good chunk of money on the table the night we were supposed to go. Well I played my $10 ( im afraid to gamble), and walked away with $50! I said, ""Well it looks like I'm buying myself dinner at STK, you're not going to talk about it all week and not let me go because you're mad at your bad luck."" Lol

It was 10:30pm and before going back to our hotel we went to the 3rd floor of Cosmo to check out STK. We heard the great music coming out of STK and they we're playing all the hip hop jams. It was the best music I heard all week ( esp since it was EDC WEEK). The hostess said they could reserve a table for 11:00pm, so we hung around since the music was good.

Atmosphere- Def looks like where all the trendy people go, Cosmo feels like that anyways. All the women were beautiful, the men dressed nice. There were a lot people hanging around the bar. Restaurant dark and music loud. 

So around 11:10 we were seated and our server was pretty cool. We looked at the menu and I studied what I could get with my $50 winnings. I only went here to spend my winnings as planned.  Well after looking at the menu I saw I could get salad, dessert and maybe water for $50 lol. Most steak dishes were around $50 minimum, chicken dish around $30, all desserts $12, sides $11, side salad $13, and most appetizers and small plates close to $20. Cocktail/Drinks $15 to $30.

After some quick calculations I ordered a field green salad, an appetizer, and the sweet potato donuts. I saw that shrimp was $6 so I said,""Can I add shrimp to my salad?"" The server then asked, how many pieces? I said,""How many come in the $6 order?"" He said...one piece. I was like, 1 piece? What kind of prep goes into that shrimp, $36 for 6 pieces? Ok nevermind adding shrimp. The server then kept asking if I wanted a cocktail, and in my head I was like ,""hell no"", keep the free water coming lol.

The blue cheese bread with chives was a little too strong for me, I'm not a fan of it.  My salad was ok, better than a lot of places but it needed craisins or nuts or shrimp lol...something.  My beef appetizer dish with pesto pasta was light and tasty.  The beef was sliced so thin it melted in my mouth. The sweet potato donuts were sooooo good. Definitely try those.  Sweet and fried fresh. 

My poor boyfriend still had the poop face about losing $400 in 10 min, and he didn't want to try anything. He was at least trying to get into the music to feel better. A girl next to me was there for her birthday and her boyfriend ordered her every dessert on the menu. They all looked so good! Especially the skillet cookie. She actually offered me some, but I heard my boyfriend jokingly whisper...""if you say yes and take some of her food, im gonna slap you."" So I told her,  no thank you.

My bill came to $49 without an entree, but I was still satisfied.  I'll def come back for the full experience when we have more time and money ;).",4NXK10hVlIXH-mijia5vQA,1,0,4,oXgXMhB7zGUT_NKUmPyviQ

I had the ribeye and thought it was good, but it didn't blow me away.  From the sounds of everyone else, they enjoyed their food a lot more than I did.  The house bread was great, I tried a salad that was very good, but the steak itself just wasn't anything to write home about.

On top of that, the restaurant had a club-like atmosphere with a DJ spinning some pretty good tracks, people were dancing, and I even saw sparklers when someone bought a bottle.  I gotta say it's weird when you're trying to eat a meal and talk to your friends to be yelling.  That said, this would be a great spot to go to if you were looking to party with your friends but didn't want the crowds and super overpriced drinks of a club.

Probably won't be back anytime soon, but I don't think I'm STK's target market.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,4,2,3,7fFTMp5BR2cdmKKsOfYARg
3916006,2011-11-17,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"In our quest to try out all the restaurants at the Cosmo the boyfriend and I decided to try STK for our date night last night.  I had made a reservation for 8:30 but when we arrived  the hostess told us it would be a few moments and to wait in the lounge.  The place was busy so not a huge deal.  After 15 minutes, she starts to seat us at one what was probably the worst table in the restaurant it, it literally shared a bench with the lounge not exactly what I was imagining for a cozy date night.  The boyfriend and I shared a ""Help!"" look and he asked her if any other tables were available she said if we wanted to wait 25 minutes she could seat us somewhere else.  And so we did, not the best start but after waiting we got a lovely little curved booth in the carpet area of the restaurant.  Moral of the story:  If you don't want to share your bench with the guy trying to hit on that one chick in the lounge specify where you want to sit when making a reservation.

For an appetizer I ordered the pear and endive salad, it was yummy but had far more frisee lettuce in then I was expecting for a salad that only listed endive and arugala.  Not bad just surprising.  The boyfriend  ordered the Alaskan King Crab and it was almost orgasmically good.  Three good size crab legs; definitely best part of the meal.  For our main course we shared the 14 oz bone-in filet (medium rare) and a side of lobster mac and cheese and the truffle parmesean fries.  The filet was cooked a perfect medium rare and looked beautiful.  It was tender, melt in your mouth quality meat except for the fact it had almost no seasoning.  I was so disappointed, for a steak house I expected more and it was just bland.  The fries were good though, the perfect amount of truffle.  Sadly the mac and cheese was just a total disappointment.  The boyfriend and I are total gourmet mac and cheese fiends and order it everywhere and this was definitely our least favorite we've ever had.  The cheeses used were really bland (once again, STK where's the flavor?) mozzerella and something else I think.  Try Holstein's truffle lobster mac 'n cheese, downstairs at the Cosmo, it's so much better.  

We hoped to have room for dessert but unfortunately after the food and a bottle of wine we were too full.  Our bill was $274 before tax and tip ($100 bottle of wine) and while we were both stuffed we were somewhat less than satisfied, I don't think we'll be coming back again.",2JRzKU0fRdgmJkamcHXKiA,1,0,3,KTil3lqApQydqZJB4ZlYyQ

3923389,2017-08-06,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I remember when STK opened, their advertising had the slogan ""not your daddy's steakhouse"". Let me preface this by saying that I'm actually quite fond of the old-school, traditional steakhouses my dad used to go to, even if they could be a bit pretentious and male-dominated. And I'm always a bit wary of these trendy, dark, wanna-be-hip steakhouses. It's the same for sushi places - I always get a bit nervous when I walk into a sushi place and it looks (and sounds) more like a lounge/nightclub than a sushi place.

However, STK delivers on the food. I loved my wedge salad and also stole some of my friend's crab tortellini, which was excellent - the cherry tomatoes were a nice touch. I ordered the bone-in ribeye medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly - a nice char on the outside and exactly half red in the middle. Our party got too many sides for me to remember (we were hungry!), but I did particularly enjoy the asparagus and the mashed potatoes. I've had a couple bad Strip steakhouse experiences, so in some ways it was a bit of a relief to have everything executed perfectly.

And to be fair, the lounge atmosphere is achieved well here. They had a live DJ spinning and it was a really good mix, mostly open format but with a lot of hip-hop including a mix of both old and new - and the volume was not too high that it kept my table from conversing.

3932769,2013-01-25,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"It's an upscale steakhouse that conveniently located in the heart of things - so you can grab you dinner here and be close to all the nightlife events right after.  You pass the Cosmo's Chandalier Bar before you hit the entrance to STK so it sets up just the right mood.  The interior and atmophere is what I expect from an upscale Vegas restaurant.  It has unique decor, feels open, and has a clubby vibe to it.  

We got seated to our table as soon as we got there for our reservation (which doesn't always happen).  The waiter was also very patient and helpful in getting our drink order - not the easier task when a group of 8 girls is trying to decide which fruity drink to get. Haha.  The drinks were all fantastic, but I've never really had any complaints about drinks that I've gotten from Vegas.  The food, on the other hand, was a hit or miss.  Here's what we got: 

BREAD FOR THE TABLE:  O.M.G!  I'm sure all the other yelpers have commented on how amazing this bread is.  It even looks amazing - coming out in the shape of a muffin glazed with deliciousness with a green side dipping sauce that takes you back for a moment because it's green.  When you get over the awe and actually dig in to eat it, it just melts in your mouth - one of those crispy and buttery on the outside, and soft on the inside.  And that dipping sauce!!!  

FOIE GRAS Appetizer: I indulged with Foie Gras ever since California banned it (not necessarily banned it completely, but it might as well have been with the restrictions).  I ordered both the appetizer and the side to go on top of my steak.  The foie gras was excellent - cooked perfectly - tender - juicy - fatty!  Unfortunately it was paired with a sweet element - I can't even remember what it was (applesauce, berries? no clue) - all I remember was that it DID NOT compliment well.  I separated the two and only focused on the foie gras.  

FILET MIGNON with FOIE GRAS: Have already commented on the awesomeness of the foie gras and it didn't disappoint.  However, the piece that came with the entree was much smaller than the appetizer.  If I could go back, I'd order two appetizer ones, and save one to eat with the steak.  Unfortunately again, the filet mignon was overcooked and chewy.  Yes, you read right, CHEWY!  FILET MIGNON!  I was very disappointed.  STK is a STEAKhouse and their steak was actually the only thing I would not get again.  Maybe they were having an off night or an off-piece, but how do you mess up such a fine cut like filet!?!  

MUSHROOM POT PIE:  This side dish was the highlight of our side dishes - a MUST GET!  It's a combination of probably 4-5 different mushroom type, baked under some dough to soak in all the delicious sauce.  It was one of those unique dishes that are not offered in many places, but tastes super awesome!  

If you have a big group and are celebrating an event, this place is a good option.  Be prepared to pay some big bucks (but hey, you're in Vegas!).",W2lmOAJRzNTxHzFxgRxHIw,3,1,3,OR5Dfm_qmKZf_Oq9DiLw8g

I was soon greeted by my server, Rachael, who left menus for me to look over while she went to get the iced tea I asked for.  When she returned Rachel told me some specials the chef had that night and I opted for one of those--the ribeye cap--asking for it to be done blue.  I also ordered the hearts of romaine salad.

I received their pull apart bread topped with melted blue cheese and chive flavored oil for dipping.  This is really good but you have to hang on to your bread plate and the bread if you want to have any after starters are out of the way.

When the salad was brought, the runner asked if I wanted some fresh pepper and he got the pepper mill and ground a generous portion for me.  The salad comes with a parmesan lemon dressing and it was very good.

The steak arrived and it was very rare as I had ordered and it was very good.  Plated on a bed of mashed potatoes with mushrooms, the steak was tender and as good as Rachael described it to be.

For dessert, I asked about two items and with Rachael's descriptions, I opted for the STK doughnuts and I'm glad I did.  The doughnuts are coated with a maple glaze and having candied pecans.

I did not do my research on this place before visiting. All I knew is that it is one of the more popular upscale restaurants in Vegas compared to Prime and others. We were staying in the Cosmopolitan so we didn't have far to go. We had a reservation for 10:15pm and we were seated about 6 minutes after we arrived. This place is not as big as it looks in pictures. Everything is very close and when it's packed, it's hard to move around.

We started our dinner with the mushroom pot pie it was good however VERY rich with lots of cream and for good or bad had a very strong truffle flavor for our dinner I ordered the bone in rib eye I did order it Chicago style (which is a seared on the outside) and I ordered medium well on the inside so I know it may be my fault but it came way too over done next time I either won't get the sear or I'll opt to get the medium steak however in my defense I have ordered this combo at other places and it was not this over done the steak was hard and over seared beyond a normal Chicago that being said I did try my friends New York and it was perfect

My visit to STK was the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. It was busy and nearly impossible to get a reservation at a decent time. But we found a way, and got in at 8pm. It was packed. 

Me and my buddy were walked to our table and the immediate difference of STK to the other above mentioned was the environment.  There was loud music playing and the bar area was filled with people standing. Felt like a restaurant within a small club. 

The menu was similar to the other restaurants, with STK seemed a small percentage higher in price. Maybe because of its location in the Cosmopolitan. As me and my buddy enjoyed steaks at the competitors very much, we decided to order a comparable meal. Between us, we ordered the filet, sirloin, mashed potatoes and corn (actual names I do not remember; you can refer to menu).

Filet- tenderness 8/10. Soft, but doesn't melt like Ruth's. Flavor 5/10. Flavor was absent entirely. Appearance/presentation 7/10. Looked fine, but was not served hot, but rather warm. 

Sirloin- 8/10 overall.  Was obviously not as tender as the filet, but it had much more flavor. This steak was good for a tougher steak of course. 

Mashed- good, but nothing spectacular. 
Corn- a bit too sweet and pasty for our taste. Maybe it's a preference thing, but seemed as it should be on dessert menu. My buddy wouldn't eat more than the first bite. 

Drinks were solid in taste. At just under $20/drink I am happy this was spot on. Tried three different ones.  Don't remember all their names, Enjoyed the Cucumber stiletto. Sunset (tequila drink) and strawberry cobbler.  

Service. Everyone was friendly and delivery was quick. Took a bit to get our check with empty glasses, but they were slammed on MDW and wasn't much of an issue. 

Return? Not by choice; maybe if a friend insisted. Taste and quality goes to Ruth's.",0jap5J6Rm2SBEDBSH38SSA,5,2,3,WEk3xLyf-SIBcEAp1A43yQ

We CALLED to inquire about restaurant week tonight as it runs from June 19-30. The worker said that we could make a reservation for restaurant week tonight and it's also the last night. So we made the reservation. We even called back a second time to make sure that restaurant week menu was still available and the girl confirmed YES!

We arrived on time and the front desk girl said ""You made a reservation for restaurant week, but we don't do that menu on the weekend. But let me ask the manager if we can do it for you.""

We didn't make the reservation ourselves and assumed that restaurant week was available. An STK staff MADE the reservation for us via the phone. A worker who one would assume knows how to do her job.

They eventually sat us and a few minutes a later, a manager came and said, ""gentlemen, I know YOU requested the restaurant week menu, but we don't do that on the weekends. I did ask the chef and he said that we would be able to do it tonight.""

We had to correct him that WE didn't request the restaurant week menu out of nowhere, it was advertised! And that we called to confirm and it was confirmed. Therefore, we responded to advertisement that STK put out. As a manager, he shoulda just proceeded with the menu without the drawn out effort to let us know that they were doing us a favor. As a manager, he should know about ALL of the operations of the restaurant and made sure all staffs know how to answer questions about their specials. 

On top of that, our server was super loud and obnoxious, one can hear him from across the room. He even told a patron NOT to order a item because it was expansive. Then when a patron asked him about the crab cakes, he responded, ""oh crab cakes are crab cakes, they're the same everywhere.""

Oh jeez, the dining experience was just bizarre due to the pedestrian and unprofessional methods of communication by the staff.

But to the balance out the bizarre experience, the food was decently good. We felt it was a fair price. The chef even came out to compliment us with a side of asparagus. Thank you, chef!",-mUp-hMTwVYMPOfVLxZLTA,0,2,3,J6gDZVUShgZ1hruwomQtuQ

There is an in house DJ and it gets pretty loud in the restaurant. So if you're thinking first date, maybe not. Ordered the cowboy rib steak 34 oz. mash potatoes and mac and cheese and the doughnuts. The sides can be shared as it is enough for two. My friends ordered a bunch of sides and we all shared. So the items that stood out for me were the complimentary bread, the truffle fries and jalape√±o grits. The cowboy rib steak was not good. The steak lacked in flavor and it didn't wow me. I was pretty sad about that because I was hoping for an amazing juicy buttery dish. Honestly, the sides and that bread was amazing. So the doughnuts aren't consistent.

We started off with the the seafood platter and it seemed like they gave us some really small pieces of king crab legs. For $40 per person... I expected some lobster and some bigger king crab legs. There were a ton of shrimp on the plate so we were over the shrimp.

We then asked our waitress what the special was for the night. She told us that it was a Chilean sea bass special topped with 2 giant shrimps. We thought that was a weird special...seafood topped with seafood? It was around $60 something per plate which was a little pricey, but we did order 2 of these.

We also ordered a tomahawk steak for 4 to share and then some sides to go with our dinner. Everything else was decent. I thought our tomahawk ribeye was a little tough compared to the other steaks that I had before at STK... For $100, I expected it to be better.

We ordered mushrooms, corn pudding and Mac and cheese for our sides. I wished that the waitress told us our main dish the Chilean Seabass came with mushrooms so we could of picked a different side, but she didn't.

When the bill finally came. I noticed that the Chilean Seabass was charged and then there were those 2 shrimps that were charged as add on's. I thought that was very fishy. I think she told us that it was included in the special so she could charge us more and make more tip. She charged us $6 per shrimp as an add on for 2 Chilean Seabass specials. That's an additions $24 that we didn't even want. We didn't touch any of the shrimp because we already ate so many of them on our seafood platter. 

We did end up complaining about that and they did end up taking it off...but next time be careful and watch of for their tricky ways to add on things to you bill! 

She was super slow and we had to flag down people every single time to get even our water or drinks refilled!

Yes it has a sexy vibe, after all the hostess staff and female bar staff will remind you of Coyote Ugly, you have club music playing at club decibels and its dark.  What this means to you, is bartenders with attitude, hostesses that only pay attention to the men in your group and an envirnoment so loud you can't hold a conversation.

The saving grace was our server and the food.  Our server was top notch and very personable, the food was good, but not good enough to put myself through that experience again.  The manager could care less about his hostesses behavior, there were no apologies just excuses and he even lied to us.

If you have to entertain your in-laws and you HATE holding a conversation with them, then this is the place to be.

We got a wedge salad and foie gras as appetizers. Both were absolutely amazing. The broccolini was delicious but too much oil on it. 

Now here is why only 4 stars and not 5:
1)The in house Dj was so loud you really have to raise your voice to talk to someone. 
2)The steak is average quality. I've had better at other places. I got the bone-in filet. It was still delicious but I was expecting amazing. 
3)The wine is over priced even for Vegas in my opinion. Also the variety isn't great, the low end wines ex: chateau st Michelle Riesling was about 65 for a bottle. They definitely need to revamp their selection.",VKUtXVyUXpdZU0kt0KMA-g,1,0,4,4T0RDc_CiyArCp2ol-u67g

This place is a meat market through and through, from your plate to the numerous plastic women and GQ guys walking around.  This is a great place to go, enjoy a real nice steak (I had the cowboy), and see and be seen.  They also had a couple fantastic apps, the beef carpaccio and tuna tar tare really stood out.

Even though we did have reservations it took them another 10 minutes to take us to our table (which I noticed there were plenty of seats in that section for 2 people). 

The bread that was complementary was amazing. I loved it and I usually don't eat complementary bread that comes with our dinners. Theirs just had this melted blue cheese on top and I love blue cheese. 

The sides were a bit expensive for what we got though. I was hoping for more flavor if we were paying $15-$20 per side. We could be skipped them.

Me and my husband shared the 20 oz rib steak which was really good and it was cooked perfectly for us. The service was really fast and they even sliced up the steak for us before bringing it out since we were sharing.

4171103,2014-08-28,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I've been to this STK at least 4 times and they always deliver a great experience!  Compared to the one in Los Angeles, the Vegas STK seems to win in every category.  For starters, the d√©cor is very sleek and modern but still intimate and perfect for any occasion.  We started at the bar and ordered a cocktail before getting seated.  There were 8 of us so there wasn't much room considering this is more of a sit down restaurant versus a bar to hang at.  Shortly after our drinks arrived we were sat in the upper booths but still had a perfect view of the whole restaurant.  As usually the wait staff is immediately on top of things and comes by to introduce themselves and talk about the specials.  We ordered another round of drinks as well as a few bottles of wine to go with our much anticipated steaks!  This is a very high end restaurant so you need to expect to spend some cash; however I wasn't thoroughly impressed with what they delivered for wines in the $100-$200 price range.  It's more our fault since we were looking to save a few bucks since we just spent nearly $10K in bottle service over the last couple days.  Anyway, for a starter we all ordered the tuna tartar and I must say it's probably the best out there.  That is a seriously bold statement coming from a guy who lives in LA and has sushi joints at nearly every corner.  But seriously this is beyond delicious!   The tuna was very fresh and of the highest quality.  It wasn't a huge portion but they served it on some sort of a candied wonton cripes and dressed it with oil and an avocado sauce.  The mixture of the avocado and sweetness of the wonton was unbelievable when eaten with the tuna.  Also, by adding the sugar to the wonton it kept the shell together so it didn't fall apart like most in tartar dishes.  Next came the steaks and the sides and as always the meat was of the highest quality.  Although everything was amazingly delicious, I did learn one valuable lesson about steaks.  Since we were on our way to another club I didn't want to over stuff myself so I ordered the petite filet; a couple of the other guys ordered the medium size or larger.  We ordered them medium rare but I noticed mine was cooked more through than the others.  The lesson is, always go with the larger even if you don't plan on eating it so the center can stay cooler while charring the outside.  Anyway, it was still very good but just a small thing to point out.  A few of the other guys went with the porter house and it was just perfect.  For sides we had the mash potatoes, mac and cheese, cream spinach and some garlic potato wedges.  For me the mac and cheese was just beyond amazing!  Crispy on the outer edge and creamy on the inside.  The spinach and the potatoes were a little under salted for me but I think they do it so you catch more of the steaks flavor versus having too rich of a side.  To finish things off we all ordered a double espresso, a lemon cello and a couple chocolate peanut butter bars.    The whole experience was extremely top notch from start to finish and that is why I go to STK every time I'm in Vegas.",3BZ2tPVSzsKuZiSoZSwaKA,0,0,5,w7q5wlN8_0haAzYWG4xJiw

4175282,2012-10-01,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Had a fabulous dinner at STK! We arrived on Saturday evening without a reservation and they were fully booked with resos. However, we were offered to have the full menu in the lounge area so we did just that. We sat down and the friendly waitress came right over to get our drink order. I had the Electric Pink (I think) and it was delicious!! Next she told us the specials (and she was honest about one of them not being her favorite, which is always appreciated). 
She then brought out the complimentary bread which is AMAZING! Hot and fresh with a blue cheese glaze. I could have eaten it all night. Our dinners came out just after we finished the bread. I had the small filet which was amazing. I also ordered the blue cheese sauce, but didn't eat much of it because the taste covered up the yumminess of the steak. That being said, when dinners come without sides the slab of meat is always lacking in presentation. We did order the mashed potatoes and mac & cheese to share (there is plenty to share). The sides were lacking (hence the 4 stars). The mashed potatoes tasted like mashed potatoes. There was no flavor to them whatsoever. The mac and cheese wasn't even as good as the ""blue box"" kind. It didn't have much of a cheese taste and I didn't like the tiny noodles that were hard to get on the fork. 
We notified the waitress of a birthday in the party. They brought out a cute little dessert that they wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate on. I noticed on the bill that they charged us $2 for it. Not a big deal but if Chilis can afford a free birthday dessert, I would think that a place with a $100/person tab could throw one in as well. 
Overall, a great dinner and a fantastic time.",ir4lIyK-u-pqMMkA9GHz8A,0,0,4,T5rDiPYfO2dEvxfyWGg4nw

The meat literally just flakes into shreds.  The sauce they put on the plate with it is so good too!  The mashed potatoes are pretty good as well and I don't even like mashed potatoes!

They told me they were booked for a week in advance and didn't have the ability to take walk-in guests! So after doing some searching we landed on STK at Cosmo... Upon our arrival we were all surprised at how interesting the interior was and it was nice and quiet when we got there....

After ordering our drinks the music started blasting and I couldn't hear anyone at my table! I asked the waiter if this was normal and he said yes I didn't like that so I took a star off for it this wouldn't be a place to bring a first date to that's for sure cause if you both don't have laryngitis by the end of the night it'd be a miracle... On to the food...

Appetizers: baked oysters and foie gras French toast ... The baked oysters were their take on oyster Rockefeller and I'll be honest of everything I had there that first bite was the absolute most memorable thing about the visit... It was phenomenal and the presentation was awesome too the French toast was good I liked the pear that came with it however the bread had a flavoring to it I couldn't pin point. it wasn't bad but definitely different ... 

Main: We all ordered the filet I had mine med rare and it was cooked perfectly the sauces They have for the steaks all tasted good we tried the wine sauce the bernaise and the chimichurry for sides we ordered the truffle fries the broccolini and the mushroom potpie mushroom potpie tasted excellent but it also tasted good reheated as I just finished it as I write this review :) yum yum ! 

The broccolini came with a hot chili oil on it that you can't see but boy it was fire in your ass hot I'm going to be in pain in a few hours I reckon but it'll be worth it in the end.  The fries were of course amazing 

I also ordered two shrimp to go along with my steak. These things were giant shrimp ... I know now what a 6.00 shrimp looks like and I could have just ordered 5 of those and had that as a meal In itself.... They ate like lobster tails and didn't taste too far off from it either we had no room for dessert but the bread pudding with captain crunch sounded awesome! 

As you can see the food here really is spot on you'll definitely pay the tourist tax though but a place like this is something that once in a blue moon the heart calls for ...

I was intrigued by how many hammered tourists rolled in and out of this place making out at the bar and dancing at their dinner tables. People watching for days while I chowed down on my steak. Entertaining to say the least. Classy restaurant Yes - clientele - not soo much :-/ 

All I know is my bone in ribeye steak from the specials was mouth watering tasty. 

Creamed corn on point. Cream of spinach perfect.
Grilled asparagus a little too charred for my personal liking.

Shoutout to our waiter who was AMAZING- I think his name was Chris. He needs to be a stand up comedian on the side he had us cracking up the whole night and was very hospitable. If I return I will definitely ask for him.",L6nrDwHJDyV0KThjON-Kog,8,5,4,8PiWnI6X9hDAziIUIgzGjA

The good...

The atmosphere was great. The DJ did a solid job mixing it up while we were there. The music being played parallels that of the clubs in the vicinity. The interior and the decor of the restaurant itself was modern and chic. 

The menu offered a variety of choices all depending on your appetite. The filets (7 oz. & 10 oz.) were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. We ordered the mac & cheese and yukon potatoes as side dishes and were not disappointed with either. I recommend those sides over some of the others, especially the broccolini. The table next to us ordered it and it looked weak. Skip on an appetizer and snack on their great with chive olive oil. It was a pleasant surprise.

Dessert is not to be skipped. Their bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream, covered with Captain Crunch was a perfect end to the meal...and I'm not even a fan of bread pudding.

FYI the busboys and waiter worked their asses off throughout the meal. 

The not so good...

They have a MASSIVE wine menu. The type that will make you wish you had a Cliff Notes version of it. The wine list was not the issue, their lack of quality beer was. Their offerings included the usual watery light beers and my choice for the night Sam Adams Boston Lager. I have nothing against Sam, I actually enjoy it very much so, but I was underwhelmed with the lack of attention the beer selection received in their menu. Craft beer is turning into what wine was years back and I was surprised their menu did not convey that.

The bathroom situation isn't ideal. It is a one-at-a-time procedure and the unisex line can get crowded. The bathroom hall monitor loudly lets you know when someone has left the bathroom in case you happened to slip out of consciousness and need assistance.

Bottom line, will I eat there again when in Las Vegas? Answer, yes.",30u3RnzBisWm3uDZKR7gBg,2,1,4,_KRAH6JmeqXFBQer8r9Rlg

4353064,2013-02-18,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Went here on a business trip with 8 others.  Probably the loudest ""nice steakhouse"" I've ever been to...  and they said it was fairly calm as it was only a Wednesday night.  The funny thing was that we all agreed the noise became less noticeable as we got drunker lol.  But, if I'm going to a nice place, I'd prefer it to be a place where I can at least hear the people with me.  

Drinks and wine were great.  We had the seafood platter appetizer which was the best I've ever had.  Jumbo Shrimp, crab legs, crab, claws, lobster, oysters, and some other stuff.  This was the highlight of the evening for me.  

I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye.  I have to say I was a little disappointed in the cut of meat.  I mean, it was huge and it was cooked well, but, for an $85 steak, I expect prime quality.  This did not taste ""prime"" to me.  This is the only part of the night (besides the noise possibly) that keeps STK from getting 5 stars from me.  It cold be that a steak this large is tougher to find ""prime"" quality?  Not sure, I might advise trying the medium cut and seeing if that's any better.  

Overall, very good experience though.  A little pricey for me as our total bill came to over $2k for 9 people, but, had a nice time nonetheless.  (Luckily our company paid for it.)  To me, it wasn't worth  $225 per person, probably more like $150-$175 range.  But, then again, we did drink quite a bit.  

Also, I have to say that the service was top-notch.  They had 1 main waiter and 2 other people taking care of us.  They did a great job.

One other semi-annoying thing was that they only have 1 single restroom for men and women.  2 stalls for the entire restaurant.  This seems absurd to me.  As I said at the start, they told us it was a quiet night for the place...  But, there was still a line every time I had to use the restroom (which was quite often as we were ""indulging"").

But when we decided to go for a nice dinner in Vegas for a friend's birthday, I made sure that my appetite was ready for some STK.

I was not disappointed. They offer several portion sizes for all appetites. I ordered the small skirt steak with (upon recommendation for Yelpers) with the truffle butter topping.  Whoa. Who thought they one little slab of butter could open up a whole set up tastebuds that I never knew existed! 

Between the 4 of us, we shared four sides (Mac and cheese, Yukon whipped potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and creamed spinach). All decent accompaniments for our steaks. But I def think we could have gotten away with only 3 as we were so full even from our steaks!

Tip:  Brussels sprouts and whipped potatoes brushed in your truffle butter drippings...do it.

The ambiance has a cool vibe...dark room, live dj. The best part - the music is awesome! We were there on a Saturday night and he played all 80s and 90s old skool hits! It was like a mini karaoke sesh with our dinner.

The downside to STK: it's not cheap...but then again, good quality food is priceless. And hello - it IS Vegas. Also, we were so full fr dinner we didn't have room for dessert which looked amazing.

The fois gras was virtually raw.  The best thing was the pear and endive salad.  Very upset that the server said the salad portions were single serving.

Each time I was with a large party and we would have to scream across the table and even then we could barely hear each other or were repeating ourselves multiple times.  Other than that the customer service is phenomenal and so is are their menu items.

I really wish they offered something else with their complimentary bread other than blue cheese or just plain.  I, nor many others who I dined with, were a huge fan of blue cheese.  I ordered the same filet mignon medium rare with truffle every time.  Each time better than the last.  We decided to try every sauce they have.  All seemed a bit bland to me.  My favorite would have to be Bernaise sauce but it just wasn't as flavorful as I have had.  With my steak I either ordered shrimp or lobster.  The shrimp are abnormally large but none the less very flavorful. Our table shared a bunch of sides including creamed corn, mac and cheese, etc.  All very tasteful.  The only thing I have to say was the worse I ever tried would be the foie gras I got as an appetizer.  Not sure what flavor they were going for but the pairing was way off for my taste buds and the foie gras seemed to be cooked totally wrong.  Other than that I will definitely be back.

4391473,2012-08-21,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"For me at least, a decent steakhouse and a nice element of the array of restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.

Pros:
-The menu is pretty customizable. This means that if you know what you like and want, you can get it, and if you don't, you'll probably end up picking something that doesn't hit the spot for you. They divide the cuts of meats into small, medium, large, and ""special"" categories, and to those you can add your choice of rubs/special add-ons (I chose to get my skirt steak peppercorn-crusted, for example). Then you can order sauce to go with it as well (horseradish!)
-Sides were also surprisingly tasty...the green beans were a hit at our table, despite everybody thinking we got them just because we needed vegetables
-Great service

Cons:
-Will cost you a bit. This is more expensive than the average nice steakhouse in other cities (as you'd expect)
-They will enforce their dress code to some degree...which is a bit surprising given that you see people in all sorts of attire on the casino floor one floor down. They'll stop you if you're wearing swimwear, and you're walking the line if you're in shorts and flipflops
-For some reason they turned the music up pretty loudly in the middle of dinnertime, to the point where it felt like a club, given the very dim lighting.
-The ""special"" dishes sound absolutely amazing, but a couple people at our table got the wagyu (the ""less expensive"" special, which was still ~$100 a plate), and the portion size was almost laughably small (which I guess is what you get for ordering something ""premium"" in Vegas)",43QXqwA8KBIb_m7IBtoEgQ,1,0,4,eTGbVVpnmUglp82sQOFDmg

The other one was some type of steak with crab meat on top.  I can't eat shellfish, so I just decided on the other.  When I got the prime rib cap, I thought it was pretty good, but not for the cost.

All that said, the dinner steak itself (NY strip) was good, but a let-down compared to other steakhouses on the las vegas strip.  

Also, while the ambiance of the STK is hip and sheek, if you are dining for two do not expect very much privacy.  They line their tables for two right on top of each other.

The ribeye was prepared well, but the meat had a ton of connective tissue and a good part of it was inedible.

Music was way too loud for a normal volume conversation. Practically had to scream to talk. As I'm reading other yelp reviews looks like STK DOES NOT HONOR RESERVATIONS, like they didn't honor mine.

Food: 
5/5 Skirt Steak 7oz.- Surprisingly my girls think I'm weird because I actually really skirt steak, if its cut right. Medium rare with a nice sear. Super juicy and flavorful. Yummy
1/5 Bone in Rib Steak 20oz.- I didn't really care for this, It was delicious but a little tough. A lot tougher than the skirt steak which is surprising. 

Sides:
1/5 Asparagus- not sure if this was cooked properly but It tasted a little cold. 
2/5 Parmesan Truffle Fries- Very Fluffy and yummy but it had a strong over powering taste of garlic powder. Totally ruined it. 

Service:
HORRIBLE!!! 0/5
We had reservations at 11pm, I understand they close at 12am so you would think they would want to seat us right away and take our order, NO.

The STK establishment of course is really pricey but if you want to treat yourself you won't regret it.

I was prepared to give a lengthy one star review. Our server, Brandon, came through big. The fact this is even a three star review is a testament to his level of service.

This is not your traditional steak house. It is more of a club combined with a steak house. It is loud and full of energy. The music helps. I enjoy the break from the normal experience.

As always the food was good. The bread and appetizers were all tasty. For my meal I ordered the filet with foie gras. The filet was prepared as requested and was satisfying all on its own. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. The foie gras gave it even more flavor and depth. It is by no means necessary, but well worth it.

For our sides we chose the creamed corn and the creamy yukon potatoes. The potatoes were good, but the cream corn was the star. You just never expect much from creamed corn, but it was fantastic.

I chose the STK donuts for my dessert. They were quite good. I was stuffed and did not need them, but I certainly enjoyed them. 

This place should easily be a four star or better. I can handle being sat up to fifteen minutes late, things happen. Forty five minutes is unacceptable. Because of our server i will go back again.

How are we going to have all of our magical and relevant convos about why our kids whine so much with the loud music? Relax though, it's not bad.  We were able to hear each other fine and also hear our server. 

My dad can't stand certain music though and he would have thought he was entering the 7th circle of hell. If you don't like hip hop, (and AC/DC. Like anything that is played at a 25 year old's wedding) avoid this. Don't even try to make it ok.

We were checked in by a very friendly host who directed us to go hang out at the bar and they'd find us to take us to our table. We ordered a drink- great bar staff. I asked for some sort of bourbon-ey cocktail. Boyfriend got something off menu with pear. Both fab.

We were seated at a small table and opted to be that couple who snuggles next to each other on the booth side. You know, those people who I used to make fun of. We're 40 year old Midwesterners with 3 little kids, so naturally we use Vegas as an excuse to wear fashionable/revealing clothing and snuggle, then not be stared at. This restaurant was the perfect place to do that.

I'm rambling so will stay on track now. Sorry.

Food- oh damn. So there's this bread with dip (oil I think? It's green) they bring out. No idea what the dip was because I didn't care. I was too busy crying about how good it was. Steak- amazing. Had the truffle butter and highly recommend. Mashed potatoes and asparagus- awesome. Asparagus was huge. Not wimpy. Huge.  We could prob have shared a side but we aren't huge eaters.

It is so good and inspires me to make some on my own! went on yelp to see what foods looked yummy and wanted to try the bone in rib-eye steak, cut, medium rare. It does not disappoint. Our waiter recommended the mushroom pot pie and the rich creamy mushroom sauce was heavenly. 

I almost forgot the best part. The beef carpaccio with pesto pasta in the middle is probably the best thing I have ever had in my life. It was very different, very beautiful, and very very delicious.
Finally, the strawberry pistachio cake with ice cream was so good I almost cried. 

I had such a great dining experience here at STK. If you want to try something different, that has quality, and will leave you feeling very satisfied, then I highly recommend STK. The food, our waiter, and the ambience surpassed all of my expectations. I felt very relaxed, comfortable, and full after my meal. Thank you STK.

We were told we couldn't be seated until everyone was there, it's one of those policy places. Bad. Ok so we have 30 minutes for everyone to get here, which wasn't mentioned when they left a message in my room or when I called them back to confirm that day, so please prepare our table so at our reservation time there's no waiting longer. Right? Wrong! 30 minutes later we were sat. No room at bar to get a drink or sit so it was an agonizing hour since all is ladies were dressed fab wearing 6 inch heels. After all, we are staying at the Cosmo, short walk to the restaurant. Guests of the hotel don't receive special treatment FYI. 

I ordered one of the suggested specials,  filet topped with Bernaise, king crab and asparagus. Also featured was a risotto with shaved white truffles and mushrooms, it was yummy but too salty. My steak was so dry and Paine it was over cooked, asked for Med rare, got Done all beige inside, I sent it back. Very nicely I asked but when it came back a pretty big guy with a bad attitude asked me to cut into and show him if it was ok. I guess they get jerks in here so they need a bouncer to intimidate them so you get the same, awkward! I'm with 3 other couple all not on a budget so wasn't trying for 2 extra bites of a dry steak! Came back perfect! Yay! 

Ok so where's my King Crab legs?? I asked our server when I chose this featured dish are they split so I could just pull them out of the shell, I'm in a Versace dress I don't want to man-handle a crustacean! She smiled and laughed and said of course!! We do all the work. Perfect! Nope. When I reminded her I didn't get my crab legs she said yes you did, they are in the Bernaise! Silly me. Those couple of little specks of unidentified, because they were tasteless, was actually the crab! Huh?! We discussed split shells, perfect chance for her to say theres a teaspoon of chopped crab, probably canned, in your sauce. I usually don't do sauce if I expect a great steak, no need to smother natures perfection right!?! It was the crab legs I was after, oh wait, now I think about it!!!! Omg, they even called it Surf N Turf!!! Damn, if I'd remembered that then I would have asked to speak w management. So that is sooo misleading!!!

The best thing about dinner was the company of good friends, the funny server assistant, and the 2 bottles of great wine I brought. I won't be returning.

I'm a bone-in ribeye type girl and won't hesitate to ask for the fattiest cut every single time.  STK gets it right every time.  The last time I was there I even added bacon butter to my ribeye.  Yum.

Ambiance is great.  Most of the tables are half booths with spacious chairs on one side of the table.  Plenty of room for everyone.  Decor is as you would expect...dark wood but this place is very modern.

What makes this place unique is the dj blasting music throughout the restaurant (don't go for quiet conversation or a romantic dinner).  I wasn't there for either and enjoyed the old school r&b while dining.  The vibe was further enhanced by the great visuals.  This spot is pretty popular so there's no shortage of great looking women.

Unfortunately the food and service didn't live up to the hype.  Like so many popular restaurants in vegas they overbook like crazy.  Our casino host joined us for dinner and we still waitied an hour and a half to get seated despite our reservation.  The rib eye was just average (I prefer the rib eye at botero - especially with their chimmichuri sauce).  The tab came to ~$450 for four and that included a bottle of wine.

First, our experience at Milo's next door was so bad, it made STK appear like a bigger super star.

Second, I love the hostess and the servers here. Last night I was sick and asked my server for some tissues or napkins. He said he couldn't find any but went to the bathroom and pulled out some toilet paper for me. It was actually really cute and endearing. He didn't want to come back empty handed so he gave me what he could. 

Next, tonight I'm here dining by myself with my laptop and working. I asked for a booth for one and normally there are no booths for one---two is the now minimum. They totally made it happen.  And all of my servers were excellent tonight.

Entree: I'm at a steak house so I ordered myself a bone in rib eye steak topped with foie gras butter at medium rare.  It was 20oz, and it was good.  It was priced at $56.

Another question for STK: do you find it acceptable that none of your hosts, servers, or managers ever acknowledged that they seated a party 45 minutes after their reservation? No offers to buy a round of drinks or appetizers as an acknowledgment that your guests waited so long? Heck, I would've settled for a simple heartfelt apology. We didn't get that either. It was almost like your staff couldn't be bothered to show minimal courtesy or empathy. I used to be a host and server myself. If I treated anyone like we were treated I would have been fired on the spot.

Bottom line: the way STK treated my party was incredibly disrespectful. My friends and I were really looking forward to this dinner, and as good as the food was, I still have a very bad taste in my mouth.

UPDATE: After the response below, Lilli sent a direct message asking for my email address so someone can reach out to me. I thanked him and gave him my address.

Linguistics aside, STK is a rad place for dinner.  Located in the P3 restaurant zone of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, STK is nothing like your typical, stuffy, smoke-filled Vegas steakhouse.  At STK, ultramodern decor, Ed Hardy button-down shirts, sky-high hooker heels, free-flowing cocktails, and loud electronic music rule the day.  I would expect no less at the Cosmo.

I had my first STK experience when I met some friends for dinner at the bar on a Friday night.  The place was packed solid, but it was mostly groups waiting for tables in the dining room, leaving the bar empty.  (Side note: The bar is all curvy and gorgeous, but it comes at the expense of leg room.  Tall people beware.)

I ordered a delicious Pinot Grigio (thanks for the heavy pour!) and noshed on the free bread (loved the blue cheese butter and chive olive oil!) while browsing the menu.  There are lots of traditional steakhouse items, but plenty of fish and vegetarian options make STK a good option for any sort of diner.  Our group ordered a bunch of different items, which was ideal for sampling and tasting:

** Foie gras and waffles.  This appetizer was absolutely **amazing**.  Easily the best foie preparation I've ever had (but, admittedly, I haven't tried all that many).  Loved the sear on the foie, and how the sweet huckeberry gastrique cut through the savory foie.  The waffles were crispy and light as air, too.

** Beet salad.  Simple, but outstanding.  The beets were perfectly cooked and had a nice sweetness.  Plenty of goat cheese and pistachio pesto, too.

** 7 oz filet.  Admittedly, I'm not much of a steak guy -- but this filet was out of this world.  Its texture was like butter, and it had amazing flavor.  (More hardcore carnivores may probably opt for a larger cut, but 7 oz was just right for me.)  

** Broccolini.  An ideal side dish, since it was excellently cooked, and provided a nice crunch to contrast with the filet.

** Sweet potato donuts.  You might not think of STK as a dessert destination, but these divine donuts might change your mind.  Sweet potato made for an unusual twist on a conventional donut, and a gooey and decadent pecan glaze brought it all together.  Heaven!

Service was outstanding.  Pretty much everyone on the staff looks like a model, with sex appeal dripping out of every pore -- but don't expect ""Vanderpump Rules""-style drama or catty behavior.  Quite the contrary -- the staff at STK are 100% professional and courteous, and quite friendly.  The pacing of the dishes was nice and steady, and we were never felt rushed or pressured to leave, even as we lingered over glasses of wine for maybe ~30 min after we had paid our tab.

we had a bottle of veuve cliquot which was perfect with our appetizers tartar, and sea food platter (king crap legs, shrimp, crab salad, and oysters) the oysters r omg so small, they're like miniatures but they are absolutely flavorful and fresh. Also my friend keep on telling me their special house bread (blue cheese bread) was amazing with their olive dressing. I couldn't eat cheese so sorry couldn't give you my opinion, but I did tried the olive oil dressing that came with it wasn't bad at all.

I had 7 oz skirt stake medium rare with truffle butter on the side which I took more than half to-go, I know 7 oz is really small, but I think it was all the appetizer, champagne, filled me up. Truffle butter was good, I never had any type of butter with steak, in my mind I saw ""truffle"" I just assume it was black truffle tapenade (maybe they do have off the menu in the kitchen somewhere) if that's the case.. you must have the black truffle topped on your steak. I tried my friend's filet mignon medium well it was perfectly done. I'm not very into red meat, but once a while it can be amazing especially when its done right like STK.

She said that this restaurant was pretty hard to get into, but was able to get us in at 5:30pm.  We arrived and found the restaurant at 25% capacity, but that changed to about 75% by the time we left.  Great experience over all.
Ambiance:  Great modern steakhouse decor.  Lighting was initially bright when we arrived, but got dimmer as the night wore on.  There was louder music than expected at a steakhouse, but it must be part of the vibe that they are aiming for.  No kids were there (unlike strip house at PH).  We were seated in the center of the restaurant in a serpentine-like booth. Unique set up that could still put you right up against another party.  We were seated next to a party of 2 and we had plenty of room.  
Service:  I thought it was really good.  OUr server came right away and was very friendly and attentive throughout.  Water, bread, food, etc. all came out at a decent pace.  She seemed to have pretty good knowledge about the menu and made decent recommendations.  
Food:  The menu was decent in offerings, not too big or expansive.  They had a variety of different items.  Bread was good and had a nice tasty blue cheese butter on top.  Also went well with the chive oil.  I ordered a customized ""surf n' turf"" with Alaskan crab and the loin steak (medium rare).  Actually came out different than I envisioned it (I thought it would be crab legs next to my steak) and was lumps of crab on top of the steak.  Either way, it was really good. I was a tad pessimistic about ""Loin steak"" but couldn't imagine finishing a rib eye.  So I was very surprised with the flavor of the loin.  The sides of Lobster mac n' cheese, asparagus, and fries were also decent.  Highlight of the meal was the Kobe Wagyu.  We ordered 5 oz (pretty damn pricey, think it was around $40/oz) and it was awesome.  Like eating butter...Dessert of ice cream was also good.

We had a great time and the food was good.  They didn't have as many choices of meat quality that they did at CUT.  I would still return if given the opportunity.",pJUzdorsC5BpC3q5ECi4Lg,3,2,5,UsZcv9OQidJ0Z5ti2XS2Cw

The stage is set, great vibe immediately and as if the environment wasn't already perfect, our fantastic server, Jill lights up our table with her smile. Not only does this girl know her menu, but her service is efficient, her timing is impeccable, and her recommendations were on point. I started with the Kale salad, the exact light, refreshing predecessor my steak and potatoes entree needed, more props Jill. And the addition of truffle butter, again Jill's recommendation,  didn't feel like an upsell because she talked foodie to me and, duh, won my heart through my stomach. The final taste? Donuts. Mother-f***ing donuts. I love donuts, Jill loves donuts, cue angelic choir, naturally we order donuts. The menu description doesn't do it justice, ""STK Donuts""? What they should call them is 'perfect bites of heaven.' Crisp, lightly fried on the outside, delicious, melt in your mouth warm pastry on the inside, glazed with maple and candied pecans for a sweet and savory firework in your mouth. Yeah, they were good. Jill sensed it as the food coma started to induce, and knowing we intended to rally after dinner, she brought over two espresso shots. I don't recall the name, but they were also a digestivo.

This time however, I honestly wasnt as excited. The bartenders and wait staff are pleasent enough. The waiter promptly took our order and our appetizers came out quickly. As a table of 5 for a business type meeting, dinner went smoothly and dessert did as well. 

So what was the problem? 
1. The music was absolutely rediculously loud. I am not a 50 year old granny who reguarly complains about volume; it litterly shook my beverage. It was impossible to carry on a conversation at all. Even the server appologized, claiming this particular DJ on 4-8-13 was twice as loud as thier normal DJ. Honestly, our table was texting back forth. 
2. They had a few minor mishaps where the backserver gave us app plates when he was suppose to give us steak knives and champange glasses when we hadnt ordered champange. This was awkward because he had to remove the mishaps after placing them. It also took so long to get my after dinner drink that dessert was over and everyone was wating for me to finish.

I'm not going to say I have the clearest recollection of the dinner - I mean it was 8 PM in Vegas and I'd had more than a couple beers throughout the afternoon. Ok, I started at breakfast. Still, I remember enough to know that we were seated 30 minutes after our reservation was scheduled and it took over an hour to get our food - long after tables seated after us were scarfing down their entrees. I did complain about the wait and we got a free round of drinks... which is something.

The food (when it eventually arrived) was pretty good. We each had the filet and it was cooked properly and was very tasty. The potatos were disappointing and reminded me of the instant spuds you pour out of a box.

The tap beer list is non-existent, but they had a couple decent options in the bottle including Dogfish Head 60 minute (which they ran out of after my first one) and a couple others. Just plan on drinking cocktails and paying a lot for them... like anywhere else in this town.

If you want a hip, jumping spot for dinner that epitomizes what Vegas is all about these days, look no further. The music is loud, the bar is trendy and it's full of pretty people dressed for the clubs. Just don't expect quick service and give yourself a couple hours to spend here.

Everything was plain nothing out of the ordinary. I really expected more when I came here to dine considering the relatively expensive prices for all of their meats (compared to other the higher priced places in Vegas), STK did not compare. Prime has much better steak at better prices, quality and portions. Also tried out their tuna, it was alright very much on the bland side even with the sauce, I felt like asking for soy-sauce (but that would've been weird). The only part of the entire meal that stood out were the parmesan truffle fries which were perfectly done to the right crispiness. 

The ambiance is quite loud, not the best place to take someone out for a romantic date as it's hard to even hear yourself. Fun place to hang out with friends to drink and eat though. 

Service was spotty, it was often times hard to flag down someone to refill waters or to even request simple utensils which was a bit frustrating but it was jam packed at the time so I'll cut them some slack.",wX67jo8MAXux9MyDWxHCYQ,3,2,3,3jgrbquOERfFMeiYI7O-5Q

I got the bone-in rib eye and it was juicy and succulent.  We also ordered a side of potatoes, and they were a bit cold.  For the prices that I was willing to pay, I expected the potatoes to be warm at least!

Food that blows you away and makes you want to come back to Vegas just for a particular restaurant. They say it's glitz and glamour, expensive and flashy, and food takes a backseat. No where else is this more true than STK. 

It's a great looking restaurant. It's hip with loud music and good looking servers and bartenders. You're definitely not at a loss for eye candy with the patrons. Actually not a bad place for the fellas to have a group dinner if they want to drop some coin on a place where food isn't the emphasis. Unfortunately I was here dining alone on business and food was my only friend.

I don't think I need to go in to detail because I've personally never cared for detailed reviews of mediocre food.  I will say this.... at some level a place like this does have to get certain things right.. I mean, people do have taste buds and people do come here. So as long as food isn't the emphasis and there's some other reason pulling you here: another person chose it, you want to oogle at hot bartenders, you like dining in a club atmosphere, you can probably get outa here satisfied.

Personally, I believe if they turned the volume down 20% but maintained the same music selection it would be a better balance - providing the opportunity to have memorable dinner conversation, and still a fun ""pre-club"" energetic atmosphere. 

The filet mignon was to die for and one of the best I've ever had. I got the red wine sauce on the side and wasn't much of a fan of it (a little too thick and sweet).

It is super ""trendy"" and ""clubby"", which is weird for a steakhouse, but can also be a really fun pre-party place.  Pre-party as in, pre-Marquee..however, who wants to go clubbing on a full stomach? 

Anyway, the restaurant is really dark and they have BLARING house music on so that you canNOT hear anyone who isn't directly in a position where you can shout into their ear during conversation.  The table we were sat at is one of those U-shaped booths, so that your entire party is facing into the restaurant, not each other.  I hate those booths!  So with the seating arrangement and the loud music, I ended up only talking to 2 of the girls I was with in our party of 8.  Lame.

The food was really just okay.  Midway through dinner the girls at a table near us started dancing on their table and the counter behind their booth and swigging champagne out of the bottle.  Classy.  I would say that if you're part of a younger crowd just looking for a fun pre-party dinner, this is a good spot.

Chilean sea bass - was very good!  the texture was great and the mushrooms and veggies was good.  I didn't get the truffles on top so that saves about $20.

lobster mashed potatoes - IT WAS THE MOST DISGUSTING THIG I'VE EVER HAD.  it didn't even taste like potatoes.  we didn't even eat it. I should have asked to return it but my friend said it was weird.  and when I saw the bill it was $30!  ughhhh waste of money.

Our excitement was quickly put on hold when my girlfriend called to ask basic questions about what sections of the restaurant were available for a party of 10. We spoke to a hostess who went by the name of Special and with every question we asked she made it clear by her dry and unhelpful responses that she had better things to do. I have been in the service industry for 6 years now and my girlfriend for 3, so we knew not to prejudge a new restaurant off of a very unsatisfactory phone call with a hostess. I figured hey, let me just call and ask to speak to a manager that way all my questions will be answered in a PROFESSIONAL manner but I was told by the hostess there was no manager available for another hour! That was my sign to find another restaurant but her mother was pretty set on spending her birthday at STK.

Our reservation was for 6:15 and there was not a single table available for us at the moment so we waited at the bar while the rest of our party arrived. 45 minutes later the host told us he had a section available but we had to be finished eating in 90 minutes because they would need those tables for another party. Thats right, not only did we have to wait 45 minutes for a table, we were then given a time frame which we had to get up and leave. UNREAL. Not a SINGLE manager came an offered an apology to us for our inconvenience which I found very confusing. 

I really need to give our server Mags a huge shout out because she made everyones dinning experience a great one. I am a server myself and I always appreciate great service wherever I eat because I know GREAT servers are a minority not a majority. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was better than we anticipated. Our night did not end on the happy note stated above unfortunately. As we are in the process of paying my girlfriend noticed a couple of managers staring in our direction and it was clear they were not only observing us but that they were frustrated. Moments later we were finally approached by the manager and his exact words were ""I will buy you all a round of shots if you leave this table because we need it for another party"". Let me remind you that we were literally in the process of paying our $1400 tab. Never in my life did I think I would be approached by a manager offering free alcohol to PAYING customers to leave a table to accommodate someone else, especially after we were sat 45 minutes late. 

From beginning to end, with the exception of our server Mags our experience with STK was a disaster. I held back on even writing a review about our experience because it seemed better to just chalk it up as an ""L"" or lesson learned. However, I can't help but take it personal especially since it was my girlfriends mom 50th birthday. As a local we could have chosen any other restaurant far away from the money driven strip but we chose to go out of our comfort zone and treat our family and friends to an expensive dinner. To spend so much money in one place and not feel like your business is neither wanted or appreciated is really a let down. To the extremely unresponsive hostess to the manager staring at us across the bar so we would move quicker this is a dinner I will always remember for all the wrong reasons.",bCrCjzaaIL-RTYwmkZ3e5A,1,0,2,qvlVDARpFDohX_p7jbkiFQ

The decor is modern, hip, a little loud, not as bad as Nine or Switch, but a bit loud for my taste.  I don't think there was a single female employee there who didn't have fake tits.  It must be a prerequisite for working there, and overt tatoos are probably a plus for them, neither of which I care for very much.

I had 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell which turned out to be kushi oysters from BC.  Oysters in May?  Is Alex S losing his frigging mind?!  No.  

Oysters actually taste the best in Spring time.  All of the snow melt bring rich minerals from the mountains/forests into the ocean where they get fat and plump before the breeding season in the summer.  Don't eat oysters in months that don't contain ""R""?? completely bogus, but I'd probably avoid July/August after breeding season, but as many of the oyster farms grow triploid oysters that don't breed, that's becoming irrelevant these days as well.   

I actually liked the fact that they had sauces off to the side so that I could choose what to put on my oysters, as I like them plain or with lemon at most.  They were good oysters.  

I had bone-in rib eye and it was solid.  Very well executed as I expected from a good steak restaurant.  

Overally, I didn't care for fake tits, tatoos and loudish environment, but I believe that their food is solid.

You definitely feel like you're already in a club dancing away, but you're at a restaurant at the same time which is a pretty cool idea (they have DJ's playing live) Love how they gave us their delicious bread that was served in their steal cast irons with a side of their Pesto Basil dip - seriously addicting, I think we had like 3 orders of their bread before our entrees came in hahaha.. can't help it if it's super good!

I shared the Short Ribs with Carrot Butterscotch, Celery, Cipollinis and the side Parmesan Truffle Fries.. the Short Ribs were very tender and flavorful and the fries are not your typical fries you get at some bar. They're cut almost like steak fries but in almost a perfect rectangle.. You can totally taste the truffle oil goodness! Both were served pipping hot (which is a major plus!)

Just keep in mind that since this is a steakhouse, it's going to be pretty expensive, that's why it's good to share some of the dishes so it won't cost you your wallet ;) 

Servers were pretty attentive, filled up our waters, and anything else we needed.. but what was even better was how our waiter gave us all complimentary Lemon Drop shots as dessert! Super sweet of him! :)",J4OSIstkXLjl9xDC0Kr0VA,1,1,4,oAmUsY4BxZ5xZMo7RNFicA

Service is really great. Our server was spot on. The food on the other hand was okay. One thing that really annoyed me that if you want your steak to taste super yummy, you can order an extra sauce to be cooked on it for $2 extra. I did not order the extra sauce since I figured this expensive steak must be amazing without extra sauce. The steak was actually just okay. I would compare it to a steak that you would find at a diner. Also, it annoys the crap out of me when I feel I am being nickeled and dimed. $2 for a steak sauce??? Just add $2 to the price of each steak and call it a complimentary sauce. I so wanted a special dinner for my birthday but it didn't happen. At least the company I was with made up for it.

Bread with blue cheese sauce and chive olive oil - This was rather adventurous and I really enjoyed it since I'm a fan of blue cheese. Unfortunately, my friends didnt enjoy it quite as much :( To each its own!

Beef tartare with black truffle, sliced radish, soy caramel - Love how the fragrance of the black truffle brought out the freshness of the beef. The potato chip was also very fresh. Really enjoyed this.

Pork belly with soy glaze, pickled radish and ginger - The first time this was served, the pork belly was over cooked so much that it was tough and chewy. Not great. Had to send this back. The second time was much better and more well seasoned, though still a little too tough for my liking. I'd give this a pass.

Lil BRGs (wagyu sliders) - Super good!! We didnt add truffles or foie gras, but if I had the chance to do this again, I'd definitely try adding both!

Medium Sirloin steak - The best steak of the night. Steak was beautifully cooked, soft, easily cut, and had a layer of fats making the steak not too dry. Definitely recommended.

Medium filet with foie gras topping - Steak was slightly too dry for my liking, but foie gras was beautifully cooked. 

Medium Rare Filet Medallion - The first time this was served, the beef was way overcooked. It was so cooked that it tasted overly-charred, and the beef was definitely past medium rare. We had this sent back and the beef was perfectly cooked the second time round. Recommended!

Sides:
Mushroom pot pie - This was yummy, but way too salty. There is no way the pot pie can be this salty. We contemplated sending this back too, but by then have given up on having our food sent back so we just ate it anyway.

Truffle fries - OMG SO GOOD. MUST ORDER. Freshly cut potato with truffles. Can't go wrong.

Mac and cheese - Decent but ok to pass.

The bill came up to be about $330 before tips, including a bottle of riesling, which is pretty OK. Ambience was nice with great music. 

4 stars for food (after they finally got it right), but unfortunately having to send food back twice is unacceptable for a fine dining restaurant, hence -1 star.

1. Oh. My. God. This place is unnecessarily loud. Music is blasting like you're in a club - takes away from the food (which, btw, is DELISH (see 3., below)).

2. Service was awesome. 

3. FOOD IS DELISH (but see 1., above): 

a) Bread: soft, moist, and cutely-shaped; 
b) Oysters: yum, can't go wrong; 
c) Filet and Ribeye: YUM, perfectly cooked as requested (medium) (FYI, they bring out an assortment of sauces for your meat -- never used them, but thought it was neat); 
d) Mac and cheese: pasta shape threw me off (very short tube-shape); other than that it was delicious;
e) Mashed potatoes: creamy yumminess; and
f) Asparagus: meh, these were so-so and under-seasoned. They throw on a weird butter cream on top that doesn't add anything, except fat to your thighs. 

4. Our table was too small for what we ordered, so our waiter used our forks as tongs, grabbed our filet, and placed it on our ribeye plate -- is this normal? (Also see 5., below).

5. Our steak came out cut in strips -- is this normal? (Also see 4., above). Maybe our waiter thought we were sharing (?). 

6. People are not dressed for a fancy shpancy steak dinner. There are dozens of hooched out girls at the bar in club attire and 5 inch heels. 

CONCLUSION: (1) I'd come here again for the food; (2) I could do without the excessively loud music; and (3) I'd never bring my parents here.",Noj8qUTPIlAi1mCKzelEMQ,1,1,4,oJtGL8pPa8JbrO7RCXDscw

There is a DJ right by the bar and it really adds to the great atmosphere. I have (almost ) tried everything on the menu and can happily recommend: 

Tuna Tartar: Highest grade of tuna
Seafood Platter: Freshest ever! Coming from Miami I am a seafood snob and this platter always surpasses my expectations! 
Dover Sole: The brown butter sauce is A+++
Bone-In Filet: Lean yet flavorful
Truffle Fries: Thick cut so different from other restaurants 
Lobster Mashed Potatoes: Self explanatory as to why these are a must
Sweet Potato Donuts: Made fresh and melt in your mouth :)

The steakhouse had a dark setting and a bit of light shining down at the center of the table. The music is pretty loud and I do feel a bit claustrophobic. The setting is tight. 
For starters we had Hudson Foie Gras and Oysters on a Half Shell. The foie gras was well grilled. Really creaming and buttery taste. The Oysters were small. I don't think my husband felt anything. The lamb and flank steak was really tender and juicy. We really enjoyed it with the side dishes.
The dessert presentation is a work of art. The S'mores and cheese cake were delicious. The marshmallow was a bit sweet for me.
I was impressed with the management at the restaurant. When the table next to me had left, the stuff would clean the table and whip the chair. Just 2 mins later I saw a gentleman came over and used the flashlight on his phone to check the table and chairs to make sure they did not miss a spot! There were some small pieces of food on the set and he had them clean it right away. That was great to see their management was on top of things.",UW_uXXLTj6b7PeIdgMT_Sg,0,0,4,hiCkVjpwH2lGy_xPZiZCYw

After about ten minutes we were seated, and then shortly greeted by our waiter who was awesome. We were brought fresh baked bread with chive oil which was amazing could of had so many. more of those, then we started off with Beef Tartare - Italian capers - whole grain dijon, poached quail egg, truffled croutons, it was so flavorful and perfect amount of each flavor spread out on toast. The other starter we had was Lil' BRGS - waygu beef, special sauce, sesame seed bun. Everything we we have had is excellent and so perfectly crafted. 

Then as the main meal the boyfriend had 6 oz A5 Kobe New York and a side of Mac and cheese, the beef was so light and flavorful some of the best I have tried. 

Then I had the Colorado lamb chops - carrot glaze, mint lava bean ragout, pomegranate vinaigrette, I would have to say it was some of the best lamb chops I have ever tried and I have had a few.

We did not have reservations, we just went right around the time they opened and was taken to our table immediately at walk in.

Our waiter was actually great; very attentive and laid back so it made the experience overall much better.
The food was the star of the show though....I like how the menu was set up. I was in the mood for seafood so I opted to try the seafood platter with cheesy jalapeno grits ( yes it was a perfect combination). It was absolutely delicious.

What? This ain't a club? Fooled me. 

Loud, loud, loud music.  Yes, your dinner conversation is at an insane decibel, but if a cool, sexy, party atmosphere is what you are looking for, then you've hit the right place.

First and foremost, check out the menu so you know what prices you are getting into...

http://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/taste/restaurant-collection/stk.aspx

Typical steakhouse prices, with the added Vegas tourist tax, a la carte sides and additional charges for toppings and sauces and you're looking at $75 per person without wine.  Luckily, all the food we ordered was pretty darn tasty.  Honorable mentions go out to the parmesan truffle fries and the sweet corn pudding (which was more like a creamed corn).  The complimentary bread was delicious!!! Gotta have my carbs!!! Servings are deceptively satisfying despite looking way too small.  

I'll agree with most that the seating is borderline uncomfortably tight.  We had 12 girls in our party and they sat us in a booth.  If we had any guys in our group, it would've been way too tight.  If you have a large party, try and book the private room.

Service was good.   We were on a tight time schedule, and our server managed to get us in and out with just enough time.  The busser, on the other hand, managed to pour water all over my friend within minutes of sitting down.  He then proceeded to walk away, tell his friends, and seemingly laugh at us.  Our server tried to make up for his mistake by giving us all free shots, which was appreciated, until we got the bill and were charged for them.  No biggie.  Told our server and they were quickly comped.  

Overall, a good time.  The ambiance isn't for everyone or every occasion, but for  a party weekend, it fit the bill.",7k5I6nL-4ywRFEjrvr8FBQ,3,3,3,hRPgDVyQOvU53J6VE-4oIQ

Came here with a group of gals for a birthday dinner before a show and felt totally glam in such a perfect environment.

We decided to dine family style and ordered:

Lobster Mac - absolutely delicious, rich and decadent! Cheese sauce consistency and flavor was perfect and worked well with the sweet pieces of lobster.
Oysters on Half Shell - fresh and sweet tasting oysters, a bit on the small side but shucked well, no shell remnants in the oysters and served with mignonette, cocktail sauce, lemons and tiny bottles of Tabasco
Burrata - comes with heirlooms tomatoes, basil pesto and drizzled with aged balsamic. Great burrata, this was a hit amongst the girls.
Beef Tartare - made with capers, whole grain dijon, topped with quail egg and served with truffled croutons. This tartare was lackluster in comparison to the amazing beef tartare we had the previous night at Bazaar Meats
Cowboy Steak - The steak was good, but not as good as I had expected based on our previous experience at Bazaar Meats by Jose Andres. The steak, although, large in portion and heft in price was a bit of a letdown. It was good, but not worth the price we paid. It was a pretty fatty cut of steak, with some portions a bit too gristly for our taste. The parts without the gristle tasted good and was cooked to our liking and was tender.
Roasted Dover Sole - a simply, roasted Dover sole with brown butter sauce, lemon and served with fingerling potatoes. Boring, typical and not worth ordering. Found this dish almost bland and boring, with a possibility of being very able to cook this dish at home.

Service was good and friendly. They were also super sweet and gave the birthday girl a little birthday cake before taking off!",ctXFXk9-m6PCMoI-Nz2_XQ,7,7,4,eMWM0QSbUJWJFlSZi_5IjA

We have been seated right after we got there, and unlike other people said, it was not as loud as I thought, not as dark, and it really provided the great lighting with seating. What we ordered was Blue Cheese Iceberg, Fillet Mignon Medium Rare, Sirloin Medium Rare, Doughnuts for the dessert. I was been served by Chrissy, and bussed by Carlos, they were both attentive and happy. They were very informative and gave us some suggestions and recommendations. As other review said, complimentary bread came out, hard outside, but soft inside, it really was great starter to appetite me and my girlfriend. Iceberg came out, but I am not really a fan of vegetable, so I would not really rate this since it was my girl's choice anyways.. Main steak came out, and I would say, IT WAS COOKED INTO PERFECTION! My sirloin was juicy, crispy outside, soft and tender inside, which I was really willing to have. My girl's fillet was as well tender, and just cooked perfectly. Considering that fillet is the part that is only meat without a lot of fat or muscle, it did not have as much juice as sirloin, but it was just great. It definitely can be the best steak that I have ever had. We were bussed consistently, and Carlos gave us some suggestion to have doughnuts for the dessert, and I really am thankful that he has recommended me that, cause that doughnut was the killer for the meal that I had; I know it sounds funny that steakhouse sells doughnuts for dessert, but trust me, you won't ever regret. 

Overall, I had perfect experience. Great ambience, not too loud, not to crowded, amazing and very attentive server and the busser, great food, till the dessert. Was it worth 150 for two? Hell yeah it was. It was a bit pricy, but I mean, we are in the strip and we are in fine dining restaurant with fine dining experience. I would not be able to come here as often as chipotle or TGIF, but if I have any special occasion, this place will easily become my first option by that time.

I wouldn't recommend for bigger parties unless you're trying to shout on top of each other but even with the place starting to feel up it still had a trendy chic ambiance. They also brought a cute little ice cream for us which I really appreciated! Overall a great place to try but get ready for that price tag that comes with it! 

PRO TIP: If you're a local or driving in do not lose your ticket! It costs $30 for a lost ticket and they do not budge at all which is frustrating when you end up paying so much at dinner and parking attendants are RUDE. So I would actually just Valet and not even worry about a ticket!",eNz_Cl-_3TBf1JsdgxscAg,0,0,4,iaDhpyqiCkCMB7FAektntw
5055344,2011-11-09,2,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"A long & overdue review to a dinner with great company...

Righteous dudes in Vegas (don't even try to make sense of it).  As we were in Vegas for various birthdays, one of the birthday boys decided the group should have one nice dinner together.  Most of us stayed at the Cosmopolitan.  My friend and I looked at the menu and thought this would be a nice place for dinner.  Knowing that you have to work with a coordinator for any parties over a certain number, I contacted our celebrations contact at the Cosmopolitan who said she'd pass on my information. 

GROUP RESERVATIONS:
*For parties of 13+ guests, you must make a group reservation. I worked with Rose
*I believe I was put in the Tempest Storm Private Dining Room - $2,000 food/beverage minimum
*A contract will need to be signed & a credit card will need to be put on file
*There are 3 set menus to choose from - $85, $100, and $125 options (sides an additional $10)
*Note: Prices do not include 8.1% tax or 21% service charge

FOOD:
From the set menu I chose the following items:
*Hearts of Romaine - Good, it's their version of a Caesar Salad.  You may want to ask light on the dressing as mine seemed tossed in dressing and another layer of dressing added on top of that.
*7oz Skirt Steak - Good with great flavoring and cooked medium rare as I requested.  It was served over mashed potatoes and a couple pieces of asparagus.
*Molten Chocolate Cake w/Vanilla Ice Cream - Yum! Extremely chocolaty rich and a perfect amount of sweetness to end my meal.

Additions we ordered:
*Short Rib Ravioli - Ok. I wish there was more than just shredded short ribs in the ravioli to add a bit more substance to the dish.
*Mac & Cheese side - Yum! Extremely rich, creamy, and cheesy.
*Truffle Fries side - A must order!  The fries had the perfect crisp to it and the truffle oil and cheese added a delicious touch!

One disappointment?  We didn't get candles on the desserts for the birthday boys.
Oh yeah, don't forget to try their bread with the olive oil/chive spread.  It's delicious!

SERVICE:
Amy aka A Booty (you'd only know if you take a close look at your bill) and Mark were great.  For once I didn't join in with the rest of the lushes and sipped on one glass of wine the entire dinner (hey, someone had to make sure everything went okay).  As my friends ordered and ordered, Mark & Amy were sometimes missing but one of the various servers in our room was more than happy enough to help.

STK is a hip, modern restaurant with louder than normal music which may make it a bit harder to hear your date.  We had one of the private dining rooms which for whatever reason has padded walls.  The private room was great so we could all hear the speeches we had the birthday boys giving.",YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ,3,0,4,8jVf_PeRC0cuc_sx8qrqgA

They moved us to another table, but smelling someone's barf was not such a great way to start the evening.  I ordered lobster, two others ordered fish and the entrees were excellent.  My Hamachi appetizer was also excellent and so were the other's salads.  The fourth person in our party ordered a rib eye steak and it was tough and difficult to chew.  To the restaurant's credit, they took the rib eye off the bill with no charge.  The only other negative is that everything is extremely expensive, which is OK, if you don't have to smell barf and get excellent service with excellent food.

An excess of foie, truffles, and caviar to golden bottles of Armand de Brignac Ace of Spades champagne; heck, there's even a live DJ to negate conversation (except for yelling or hand gestures) giving the excuse to text or checkup on one's social network fame.

Oh, the food is good.

Starters are upend takes on classics. The beef tartare packs a flavor punch, mixed with black truffle and served with peppery, sliced, crisp radish and a sweet and earthy soy caramel.  The flavors blend well.

The foie, indulgent.  Large slice, pan seared, served with almond brioche French toast and a sweet, woodsy, sherry gastrique brightened by tart apples.

Finally, one of the most decadent sliders (lil' BRGRs); American wagyu burger topped with foie and black truffles.  Pure decadence.  I'll leave the flavor to your imagination.

Good selection of steaks in different sizes and cuts.  Servers claim the beef is USDA prime.  Seems correct.  Good texture, marbling, well trimmed, good sear and properly cooked to temperature.  The Bone in rib steak, bone in fillet, and porterhouse excellent.  There is a selection Wagyu cuts.  Never tried them since their country of origin unknown.  Maybe the word ""Wagyu"" is baller enough?

Do not pass on the foie or truffle butter.  Both add a great flavor boost.  Tuck the compound butters under the steak so the heat releases the aromas trapped within.  Excellent.  Add a slab of foie and / or shaved truffles to kick up the flavors even more and increase the baller status.

Steakhouse standard sides.  All meant to be shared.

Very good wine list.  Passable service (it's difficult to communicate with the servers thanks to the music).

Simply put, it's Vegas baby.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,19,19,4,NAJkml3wBqLHDovjU70iEA

The service is great as always and it was a really fun way to enjoy a big group. And it's not as crazy expensive as you would think. 

The Seafood sampler - the oysters and crab legs are great. Try the Parmesan fries. And although I didn't try I've heard the pork belly is great.

I came here with a group of 8 for a friends birthday on a weekday. Ive always seen this place around however never really had the desire to come. Like I noted above its great for groups and definitely not your old fashion kind of steakhouse. I'm not sure what fell through the cracks with my experience but for our $1100 tab I expected a bit more. More customer superior customer service, more flavor even if it meant more $. It could've been the server who wasn't as enthusiastic and accommodating as the $160+ added on gratuity he was granted hence the size of our party. On to the more Yelp appropriate opinions, the food was mediocre. I never pass up Mac n Cheese with lobster from any almost any where but the cheese here was equivalent to box made Kraft Mac & Cheese and well I'm more of a Velveeta type of girl if we're talking box Mac & Cheese. It was gross and of course hardly any chucks of lobster. The steak was made to perfection and I wish I would've tried a couple different sauces or rubs for the lovely charge of $2 but passed it up. The Yukon mashed potatoes were ""basic"". The pot pie mushrooms were delicious. We order 5 appetizers and they all were bland. Steer away from the shrimp ceviche and beef tartare and beef carpaccio but do order the lobster tail and bite size oysters! Overall, it was just average!

The service is not bad but not good either.  It just sort of is.  They did mess up on our carpaccio.  We ordered 2 and they brought us only one.  Instead of bringing us another they took the one on our table back and brought out another which still is just one carpaccio.

The delmonico was delicious. It was seared well and was the perfect amount of juicy. The tater tots were yummy although not super memorable (they were basically mashed potatoes within a crunchy shell). The saut√©ed spinach was good but maybe could use a few more flavors. The lobster Mac n cheese was perfect - just the right amount of lobster in the nice cheesy macaroni. 

We also had a bottle of cabernet which wasn't super impressive for what we paid ($95) but was good. 


However, the star of the show - weirdly enough - was the salad. We ordered the chopped vegetable salad and it was absolutely perfect. It had nice crunchy veggies like peppers and cucumbers, and it also had olives, a few grapes (random I know but it worked), and asparagus. All of it was tossed in a wonderful, light balsamic that added the perfect flavoring. I'm seriously still raving about this salad the next day. It was wonderful. 

Overall, it was a great meal. The ambience was fun too, with lots of pop songs and great people watching. Our server was sweet and attentive. My only complaint is that the table we were seated at had a booth that was super far away and I had to have my back bent at an unnatural angle for most of the meal because we were so far away.

5212528,2018-06-10,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"We were 2 couples in Vegas celebrating a Birthday. I had to make a really tough decision not to go to Cut or SW(we have had several wonderful experiences there), and try STK for the first time. We were all really hoping to be impressed as we only had 2 nights in Vegas and both needed to be spot on. Our reservation was for 8:30, we arrived a few minutes early and the ""hostess"" (positively not a Maitre D') informed us they were running a little behind. No problem, we went to the bar for a few cocktails and glasses of wine and at 8:50 went back to the hostess. Was informed it was still going to be a while, and we asked for the manager. I wish I could remember this first manager's name, but his lack of professionalism and common courtesy made him all too forgettable (ZERO). His response was that it was not his fault people were staying too long at the tables in the dining room, no apology, no empathy, just a rude excuse. When he realized his poor management skills were not going to work on us, he stated he would have a table in 5 minutes. The hostess found us in 10 minutes and tried to sit us at a high top table in the bar!! Nope, not going to happen I told her. She went back to inform the manager (ZERO), and he actually attempted to have her try and sit us at another bar table again!!! I actually felt bad for the hostess, being that the cowardly, poorly spoken manager did not have the nerve to attempt to sit us there himself. We finally bypassed the hostess stand and sought out a different manager on our own. We were moments from walking out, but it was almost 9:30 at this point and we were starving and knew that it was too late too get in to one of the other great steakhouses. Then Clay (HERO), entered the situation. Professional management skills at their finest. Calmed us all down after taking the time in the middle of a very busy and loud bar to hear us out, empathize, and rectify the situation. I was feeling really guilty that my choosing this restaurant was going to ruin my friends birthday evening until Clay stepped in. He sat us at a wonderful table immediately, patiently stood at the table with us and personally introduced us to our 2nd Hero of the night James (our astute server), and Heath our 3rd Hero (a wonderful Sommelier). We were actually feeling quite vindicated and our temperatures were dropping significantly as Clay asked James to bring us 3 of their best appetizers, and asked Heath to get our bottle of wine to us as quickly as possible because we had a celebration that needed to begin ASAP. Clay apologized profusely again, said to ask for him personally should anything not be perfect, and excused himself politely form our table. We were in phenomenal hands the rest of the evening with James and Heath. The bottles of Wine were divine, the appetizers (which Clay took care of for us quite generously)were amazing, the steaks were spot on, and the lovely desserts (also taken care of by Clay, James, and Heath) were delectable. The table, the food, the company, and the atmosphere, along with the 3 ""HEROES"" turned a disaster in to the way a wonderful fine dining experience should be. STK, I beg of you to commend Clay, James, and Heath....and please quickly rectify the problem you have at the front door, as they almost cost you an $800 tab, and an important, memorable evening for us. We have dined at the best of the best all over, stayed at the best of the best all over, and have never been treated so poorly and so miraculously all in the same  evening. Thank you Clay!!

Ambiance is cool if you are there for dinner or just want to be a barfly or just lounge. It may be too noisy if you are planning on a quiet dinner on a weekend night due to the DJ, but you were already expecting that because it's STK, right?

I like this location as much as STK L.A. and more than STK ATL (FULL DISCLOSE: I do need more trips to this one - only been here twice) .

5279231,2016-02-15,6,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Too loud, too trendy, too touristy, too prominently situated on a nationwide list of top money makers and thus too expensive, Los Angeles import STK is one of *those* restaurants that locals love to hate, and although claims regarding of the dearth of affordable dining on Las Vegas Boulevard may indeed be warranted the fact of the matter is that in an economy built on fantasy there are few restaurants pairing quality cuisine with a club-like environment, a look at the work of Chefs Stephen Hopcraft and  Brigette Contreras showing The Cosmopolitan's third floor Steakhouse to offer just that.

Open at 5:30pm with the digital outdoor menu not yet updated to seasonal changes found inside it was followed by a friend caught in traffic that I was greeted on arrival at the hostess podium and undoubtedly setting a standard with staff that is almost *too* good looking it was not long before seating was offered at a spacious four-top, a pleasant and forthcoming media contact named Erica taking the time to sit down and provide a little background on the restaurant as well as herself until my tablemate arrived.

Admittedly a menu with some sticker-shock, the $150 Lobster Thermidore and $22 Sundae not the most expensive I've seen but enough to give one pause, it was with excellent service from a surprisingly well-informed and energetic young man that the show got underway and although the DJ did not begin until 7:30 the space was jammed by 6:15, a small kitchen expediting like professionals as staff worked at a breakneck pace.

Energetic but never obnoxiously loud, music from The Doors or Bob Dylan followed by oddities from the Early-80's playing overhead as patrons chat and dine, every meal at STK begins with their famous-for-good-reason Brioche Pull-apart topped in Blue Cheese Butter with addictive green dipping oil, signature starters of a split batter-fried lobster tail over slaw and seared duck liver with tiny pancakes proving a bit less sharable than one would expect considering the pricetag, though both were well executed and also tasted great.

Well paced and attentive to details, bussers doing a better job than most local fine dining spots at keeping glasses full and dismissing dirty plates, it was after a quick tour of the black and white room with gator skin print plus light that makes anyone look a little more pretty that a dish of carpaccio arrived and although the meat itself is well flavored with balsamic and tomatoes adding acidity, the most impressive aspect of the dish is the unexpected pesto noodles, delicious on their own but even better when placed within the context of the plate.

Duck recently removed from the menu, but still with numerous entrees, steaks and sides made to share, it was on the server's recommendation that the tender Bone-In Filet was ordered and cooked just past medium-rare the flavor was plentiful, though not as robust as that at Jean Georges, Delmonico or Carnevino, while the Dover Sole spoke to Hopcraft's skills sharpened while working with Michael Mina, a simple roast rendering the white flesh flaky yet moist with brown butter and capers plus crisp fingerlings that might be even better than STK's addictive Parmesan Truffle Fries.

Impressed by the manner in which the kitchen allowed the Mushroom Pot Pie to express its intrinsic earthiness without mellowing it for a ""club"" crowd while taking the corn pudding almost as if it were a pre-dessert considering the substantial use of sugar and cream, the parade of sweetness actually began following a warm Americano that helped to compensate for notably chilly room temperatures, a complimentary trio of housemade ice creams and sorbets highlighted by smooth coconut and a malty version of chocolate both foretelling of good things to come.

Already seeing - and hearing - doubt from the server that two-people could manage four desserts after  ""so much"" food it was with Chef Contreras shattering Apple Tart that the degustation marched on and utilizing phyllo dough plus plenty of butter to construct a high-rising cup around roasted apples the timeless classic found a new level in terms of texture, the robust crust crackling bite-after-bite even as ice cream melted and outperforming STK staples including the rather mundane skillet cookie and exceedingly light donuts that were not excessively sweet despite the maple glaze, best bites being the donut holes with toasty nuts and a dollop of whipped cream.

Particularly intrigued by the aforementioned Sundae, the questions of cost brushed aside with ""big enough to share,"" suffice it to say that although quite well conceptualized in terms of taste and complexity there are far better ways to spend $22 on Ice Cream elsewhere in Las Vegas, the tender banana bread itself likely better utilized as part of recently-launched Sunday brunch or the previous menu's bread pudding.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,15,9,4,-NPazzkqAJS5yHfykCJDog

There was a line for the bathrooms, only one per gender.  Luckily there were more stalls outside of the restaurant.

The steaks were tender and cooked the way we ordered them.  The dipping sauces were a nice addition.  All of the side dishes were great to share and they had a good variety.  The mac n cheese sampler was probably my fav.  If you're coming here to celebrate a special occasion, be sure to let your server know and they will end your meal with a special treat.

The place is beautiful, as you would expect in the Cosmopolitan. The beef tartare was actually pretty flavorful (which isn't always the case), their verson of tomato/mozzarella was luscious, their crab ravioli appetizer had a thick, yummy sauce.  Their bread was definitely one of the most inventive I've seen where it was warm out of the oven, you tore it off and had a sort of blue cheese pesto sauce for dipping.  The filet was cooked beautifully and we all agreed we loved it.  The sea bass special was cooked well, but it needed more of a sauce and more salt.  The truffle mac and cheese was slamming and the bok choy was surpisingly spicy.  The bread pudding dessert was also received well.  I would come back here anytime since it isn't just a steakhouse.

The decor is modern and very different from traditional steakhouses. The atmosphere was on the clubby side and the music was pretty loud. But from where we sat the music wasn't too bad, but we still did have to talk louder than usual. 

The bread was amazing! And it was in such a cute shape. And the sides were good too. My fave were the truffle mac n cheese and the mushroom pot pie. I wish we had more of the pot pie because between 7 girls, there wasn't much to go around. =( I shared lamb chops and the beef short rib with another girl and both were really good, although I love lamb so I have to say the chops were a tad better. And I really liked my Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler. If you thought it was my dessert, you would be wrong...it was my cocktail! And it was delicious: fruity but you could still taste the kick. It came in a martini glass rimmed w/ graham cracker crumbs. I think most of the others liked their entrees too. Unfortunately a couple of the other girls didn't like the steak they ordered. I tried a bite and agree that it was overcooked. 

Our server was great and attentive at first (as most places are) but it dropped off a bit after we got our food (like many other really busy places). I knew this place was super pricey but I was disappointed that the portions were on the small side. The sides are smaller than I would have liked and the entrees i shared could have been larger as well, although we were both full at the end, so i guess you can say it was just right.

First off this is a VERY noisy place and initially they tried to sit us in the bar area which was crazy noisy and we immediately told them this wouldn't work.  Ultimately they sat us in the main restaurant area, great we came to talk to one another.  NOT.  We sat down and then the very loud hard rock music starts. Now I like AC/DC as much as the next guy and at reference volume when I am enjoying it by myself going down the highway or cranking up my Martin Logan's at home, but in a Steak Place!!! HUGE MISS.  STK Management, we the people that can afford to eat at this VERY VERY expensive place are there for some quiet. I get it, this isn't Smith & Wolnisky, much more hip than that, but turn the @#$#@ music down.

Now the meal was very good, that was a solid 4.  My $72 strip steak was good, very good, not the best I have ever had but super nice.  The wine list was extensive but this is a 3 figure wine list and many over $200.  We settled on a Freemark Abbey that was a bit too young for $135 bucks.

This place is very expensive so either this is a very special occasion, your a billionaire or you have a corporate expense account.

overall I have had better steak places and I have for sure worse ones. But if your trying to find a place to have a quiet dinner like a S&W or the like, this ain't it.  But if your in the cosmo and money isn't an issue, I would hit it.",LlqQQhm0FFfbEoj66Sf1cQ,0,0,3,CvMW3kBo-l3X5echY4_Vjg

The bread that they bring out for table is absolutely amazing. There's a blue cheese glaze that the covers the bread and its fresh out of the oven. We literally plowed through the bread in about 10 minutes.

I then ordered the Kobe sliders for the main course. They were very small, but absolutely delicious. I was still full from lunch, so the small portion was perfect for me. My buddies all enjoyed their meals and one even said the chicken dish was some of the best he ever had. 

The music was loud and we loved every minute of it. This is Vegas and if you're looking for a low key experience, you're definitely in the wrong place.

It's really dark inside, kind of like a club -- which includes the choice/volume of the music. Service was really nice, although there were some servers who thought they were entertainers and clapped in my ears really loudly to the beat of the music every time they passed by.

The food was great! Nothing to complain about if you like a nice steak. But for the price, I think there is better food/service/atmosphere in Vegas. It really depends on what you're in the mood for!",4D90YMyPxBtPbIpodbBmeg,2,0,4,8xnKCRK3hKxHz6i-FwJdEw

The hostess greeted us with a smile and said we would be seated within 10 minutes and offered us to get a drink at the bar.  They explained they would come get us as soon as the table was ready.  In 10 minutes we were grabbed from the bar and taken to our table.  The music and the customers at the tables throughout the restaurant were jamming to the music and looked to be enjoying themselves.  The service throughout the meal was bar none some of the best and the food is too die for.

5326613,2013-01-08,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"The Setting:  Group dinner Saturday night, no res (but had a Vegas hook-up in our group), sat after ten minutes.  

The Vibe:  3.5 Stars
True to the theme at Cosmopolitan, this place is swanky.  Fancy finish out, pretty people, and music that is a bit too loud for dinner.  I assumed the loud music had to do with the hour, but some guests that were leaving as we arrived said it had been loud the whole time.  Seemed a bit aggressive, even for a restaurant one door down from Marquee...

The Food:  3 Stars (Appetizers), 5 Stars (Entrees)
This is literally the first meal I've ever eaten where the entrees outshined the smaller bites by a big margin.  It is usually the other way around!
The GOOD: 
1.  10oz Filet, Truffle Butter topping - melted in my mouth, amazing!  One of the better steaks I have had in my life, yet it was topped by....
2.  14oz Bone-in Ribeye, Foie Gras butter topping - If I could rate something 6 stars, this would get it!  Our friend who got it gave us each a bite, and then had to fight us off stealing the rest of it.  I got one more a couple more bites to evaluate for this review, but didn't need them.  The entire table was salivating, and they liked their own steaks!  Perfectly flavored, perfectly cooked (medium rare - ), it was worth every penny and probably more.
3.  Dover Sole - got strong reviews from the group even though we wondered why he ordered a non-steak...
The OK: 
1.  Foie Gras French Toast - nothing against this dish itself.  The Foie Gras was quite good and the toast tasted fine.  But getting about 3 bites of it for $24 was pretty much a waste.
2.  Caesar Salad - our buddy didn't care for it, his friend who tried it said it was nothing special.

The Service:  4 Stars
This would have been 5 stars if he hadn't messed up one guy's drink and another guys after-dinner drink order.  Water glasses were kept full, he was highly knowledgeable about the menu, and he basically got carte blanche for any mistake he might have made just for recommending the bone-in ribeye with teh foie gras butter.

The Bottom Line:  If you don't mind the music/ambiance being loud, this is a great steak place, honestly one of the best I've ever been to.",J1-B5TtWM5CCKlTL_NG7vw,0,0,4,5BNA2XAn0nqTa3VKb6VZSw

Dim lighting, loud music, great food.. This is definitely our kind of place. The decor is modern and hip with soft purple lights and booth seating, which I love since I prefer sitting next to my man. Although the music is loud, we still had an intimate evening. You get the vibe that you're at a cool, upscale lounge as opposed to a formal steakhouse.

For starters, we shared the burrata salad, a mix of cheese, heirloom tomatoes, balsamic, and basil. Not only was it beautifully plated, but it was equally tasty. A perfect start to our meal.

We both decided on their special for the evening: An 8 oz grass fed filet. I ordered mine cooked medium, which was a little too rare for my liking. Next time I would opt for medium-well, but the steak was still delicious! To accompany our steak, we chose the creamy Yukon potatoes, wild mushrooms, and asparagus. The potatoes are a must get! I really enjoyed the mushrooms, too. You can pass on the asparagus, though. It was nothing special, and had a rather strange, sour taste to them.

I guess hubby pulled some strings because they brought out a dessert just for my birthday! It was a plate that had ""Happy Birthday"" written on it in chocolate syrup with a cup of assorted mousse and a strawberry macaron. It was so good! Surprise your friend or date by calling the restaurant ahead of time to let them know you're celebrating a birthday.

Luckily, what I really liked about this experience was the star of the show, the porterhouse steak which was delicious beyond words. Seasoning was done just right, medium well, it was juicy and melt in your mouth good. I was extremely impressed with this Omaha based steak and I can proudly say I've eaten Omaha steaks in Omaha! This steak was done perfectly, I couldn't have added one thing to make it better.

There are so many good restaurants in Vegas. Everyone in my group had a steak sides and appetizers. There was nothing that stood out.

I am not a huge fan of supper clubs either and that played into my distaste for this place. When I am at dinner, I generally don't like having to scream across the table to talk to my friends.

When we got there, we were seated right away this time on the high top tables near the bar. The service was a little slow at the beginning, but all our needs were taken care of. The four of us ordered; shortrib agnolotti with kabucha, steak tartar, crispy shrimp with a spicy bisque, beef carpaccio, and the beet salad.

Overall, the food is decent. The best item was the beet salad. It is not a knock to the other items, but the greens were just that good. I love beets and am glad to see them make an appearance on many menus nowadays. The agnolotti were also wonderful. The stuffed pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. The sauce is reduced to caramel consistency and retained all the flavor of the beef. Out of the raw dishes, the carpaccio was better. The pesto tossed noodles on top was a splendid pairing. I've had better tartars on the Strip, so I would skip that next time. The bisque for the shrimp had a nice flavor to it and would be great for a cold day.

(Del Frisco's, Mastro's, Delmonico, Cut, Vic & Anthony's, Envy...) You get my point. My three stars has EVERYTHING to do with our server hurrying us and the prices. They start with seasoned butter and brioche seasoned 2 ways. Delicious! We split a beet salad that was outstanding and had one of the specials, an 8oz filet Oscar Style for $77! Our dinner was served while we were still eating our salad! Unacceptable! That's on the server! They were great and split them in the kitchen and everything was plated beautifully. However, Oscar Style is asparagus and LUMP CRAB or at the very least, pieces. This looked like tuna flakes in butter over the filet. I will say that the steak was a perfect medium rare and flavor was phenomenal. If you can get away with that for the money...who am I to argue. All sides are minimum $15 and they say, ""Shareable for 2."" They're shareable if you order more than one! Mac & cheese was yummy, as were the regular mashed potatoes. One of our diners is vegan and they made a beautiful veggie risotto that she absolutely loved! It was my husband's birthday and they brought out a really nice dessert.

The service is very good. That is where this restaurant does well. We had a nice waiter but it was the other people helping with water as well as with cleaning up the table that were outstanding.
The restaurant is expensive. My favorite part of my meal was ordering the beet salad at the beginning. Quite frankly, next time, I would only order that. It was a large salad and it was absolutely delicious. I shared it with my group. From there, I ordered the 10 ounce filet mignon which was expensive. The problem is that it was harder than great filet mignon should be. It was not as moist or tender as I've had at other restaurants, including a top restaurant in Pahrump Nevada that does a way better job. Great filet mignon should 'melt in your mouth' and this was not the case. Three of us ordered it and all of us were disappointed. I did order a side of broccolini I which was good. My friend ordered asparagus but did not like a vinegar thickened light sauce on top of it. The Mac and cheese was ok. 
My friend and I ordered a glass of Malbec each which was very good. Our other friend ordered orange juice which was not that good and tasted like it was watered down.
It is an expensive restaurant and therefore I expect a lot more than what I got. The food quality is just OK despite good service and I would probably not come back. We chose not to have dessert here and instead went downstairs to another place at The Cosmopolitan that is very good for dessert.

It was my first time dining at STK and we came in for restaurant week. $80 for a three course meal was a deal I could not surpass. The food was delicious and service was only okay. I found my server to be rude at times, particularly when questioned about menu items, but the other staff members were very friendly and helpful in any way possible. As for the food, we had the dayboat scallops with Osetra caviar, sirloin steak topped with king crab oscar and then strawberries and cream and doughnuts with a glass of champagne. I loved every bite of what we had, but it was what ensued that was regrettable. We came down with food poisoning about an hour after the meal and it was horrific. It honestly looked like the scene out of Bridesmaids and has been this way for over 24 hours. I have tried calling the restaurant to speak to a manager and have been told several times that the managers are unavailable and will try to get back to me in the next 3-5 days. For a $250 tab, I expect to enjoy my meal once instead of having to suffer through it a second time.

The steak....New York strip with peppercorn. Came out dry as can be with zero presentation. No juices at all.

I read someone called it an assembly line, and that it is. The only thing that I did not like was the server. She was efficient, but REALLY snooty. Give me a break, that is barely tolerable at stuffy French restaurants. Secondly, after we finished eating she told us we had to move to the bar to have more drinks. We weren't allowed to sit at the table and finish our champagne either. So, we just left and went somewhere else to spend our money.

It's trendy, classy, packed, the food is great and the atmosphere is superb!

Brussel sprouts are surprisingly VERY good, broccolini was tasty too albeit not my absolute favorite, creamed spinach is a winner always, the blue cheese bread they serve to start is a must.

It was ok but really small portion and I wasn't wowed by the flavor - too much spice masked the natural taste of the lobster.  They also plated it atop so much ice that by the time it came to our table some of the ice had melted and ended up overflowing onto my lap:  downer, considering I was dressed up to go out after.  A couple people at our table got steak, which I'm assuming is what STK is known for, and the unanimous opinion was ""meh, ok, but not great"" -- their thoughts not mine so i would still try their steaks for myself.  The dish that stood out to me the most was the Mac n cheese-- delicious.  But the side should not be the star.  

And I hate to call them out on this, but after we were done eating and we were sitting, enjoying our wine and coffee, we were rushed out.  Like ""oh we need this table now"" kind of rushed.  I understand they may have been busy, but rushing people out who barely put their forks down was in poor taste and slightly rude.  Granted they offered us free shots at the bar to make up for it....but what if we weren't big drinkers, recovering alcoholics or god forbid, pregnant?  Disappointing.

I had heard this place was the best but we could only get in at 530. The place was fairly empty when we went but got a hard time initially about switching to a more comfortable table/booth. The service was terrible. Our waitress didnt smile once or ask how we were. i felt like she did not even know the menu. It was straight cut to the chase, no friendly service at all. I tried to joke around a bit to lighten her mood but she just stared at me with a deer in the headlights look.

The food was good, no complaints there really but i felt uncomfortable and unwelcome because of the waitress. On our way out the door there were 4 hostesses standing at the front and they stared at us as we left like judging us or something, not one said good bye. Really awkward experience. I will never be back. If I am going to spend that kind of $ I will go somewhere more welcoming. We are well dressed (suit/dresses) and always tip at least 20% if not more.

STK is chic, sleek, and sexy. The bartenders are hot and the music was pumping. 

That's all I can say positive about the place. The food was average. The steaks were average. The creamed spinach was cold. The bread was ""enh."" Nothing wowed us at a cost of $300.

We also had grilled asparagus and mac and cheese on the side.  Not sure what cheese they used in the mac and cheese but it was not to our liking.  But this is not your typical steakhouse as its part club/lounge and its in Vegas.

This was a Wednesday night at 9:30 p.m.  It was not busy.  I would never eat at STK on a weekend.  

The other thing that I have to mention is that this is a reasonably large restaurant with a single, private bathroom for men and a single, private bathroom for women.  I don't know how that meets building codes--but if you go to STK and have to use the restroom, do yourself a favor and leave the restaurant.  There are large public bathrooms just across the hall.

I think you have to be have to be ready to party when you come here. The bar area had a very social feel which was nice to have before sitting. We went there since our ""table wasn't ready"" but I think its by design to get us to grab some drinks at the bar before sitting. I say that because when we sat down there was a few open tables that appeared to not be filled for awhile. Our server was fast and on point with good knowledge of the menu. My ribeye was cooked to my medium rear liking with a nice sear on  the outside just like I like it. Mashed potatos were fantastic. They did under cook one person at our tables filet mignon, but he was too polite to send it back to be cooked longer. Steakhouse usually error on that side so they can always throw it in longer. The point off for the visit was strictly because they didn't serve prime steak, but charged ""prime"" prices. The steaks were angus though a very tasty!

The music was pulsing and the vibe was good. The DJ played quite a few tunes from the early 2000's - which was fine with me since I'm in my thirties and it brought back fond memories of when I wild and mortgage-free. The servers were friendly but were a bit difficult to get ahold of for drink refills.

Hubs had the beef short rib, which was good. I started with the Steak Tartare with black truffle, sliced radish and soy caramel, which was fantastic. It definitely put the tartare at Comme Ca to shame in a big way. For my entree, I had the seared big eye tuna with wasabi potato, maitake and sweet miso jus. The ahi was great and full of flavor. I was hoping for a bit more potato to  soak up all of the wine; however, my dish only came with about 2 small tablespoons of it. Luckily hubs and I ordered a side of mac and cheese to supplement our starches. However, the mac and cheese was just ok. It was bland. I'll be honest, Kraft mac and cheese from a box tastes better. I wish they had the option to add truffle oil to it...that would've done the trick. The portions were small but the food is so rich, we probably couldn't eat any more than we got.

Near the end of our meal, we remembered that we never got any bread so we asked for it. It was warm, fresh and came with this delicious pesto-like dipping sauce. Wish we got it at the beginning of our meal, but unlike other restaurants, again you have to ask for it. 

In any event, we left the restaurant full and happy. We would definitely return.

To start, I enjoyed the beet and arugula salad which was wonderful and finished the course with their 20oz bone-in ribeye (med rare, of course) topped with bacon butter, because why would you not? Happily sampled a bit of my friends skirt steak as well which was likewise, outstanding. Oh! And a quick side note; if you're a manhattan drinker, you'll be pleased to know they carry Carpano Antica... And yes, it absolutely matters.

I can't imagine how the same dishes can taste so different but they paled in comparison to what we're used to savoring at the LA STK.  Lastly, they did not acknowledge the special occasion note that it was our anniversary.  My husband had to remind them but they did then bring us a pretty yummy Bread Pudding!

Would I recommend this place you ask?  Absolutely because its in the Cosmopolitan Hotel (check), plays awesome music (check), has decent drinks (check) and the food is edible.",9Lf-E9L4YliiM3L9opuWoQ,4,0,3,Gqoc9a09QpMtVHLyOyLuDw

The food was delicious, service was superb and atmosphere was energetic! I had the 13oz Skirt Steak with bacon butter which I highly recommended. Others in my group order filets and bone in rib eyes and all were more than satisfied with their meals. For dessert I would encourage you to save room, so that you can sample the deliciousness of the sweet potato doughnuts! They were out of this world good!

Some may not like that because they want to enjoy their dinner in peace, but I think it adds to the fun of being in Las Vegas, especially if you're eating with a big group of friends. They play a lot of 80's/90's music remixed to dance beats. Sometimes the entire restaurant sings along to the songs.

Their steak ranks as some of the best steaks I've ever had, very tender and full of flavor. I always get my steak with foie gras on top. Their sides are all very good. My favorites are the mushroom pot pie, mac & cheese, cream spinach and creamy yukon potatoes.

One of the two side dishes was great which was the yukon potatoes that tasted like you were eating warm butter they were so creamy.  The second appetizer was mac and cheese that was baked with a generous amount of cheese on top, except for the fact that they were made with tiny noodles that resembled more like something you would give to a child which I asked if they were meant for a 5 year old.  The combination of tiny pasta and a large amount of cheese made it soupy and not worthy of the $10 they charged for it.  STK, get rid of the mac and cheese or make it so an adult would enjoy it.

Our list of orders we had:
1. Truffle fries-8/10- good portion and very crispy for about $13
2. Beef carpaccio pasta-8/10-very thin slices of beef with a slight amount of pasta. Decent taste of the flavor.
3. Foie gras-10/10- super delicious and I recommend. All he flavors balance so well and it was my first time trying it.

Service at this place is phenomenal!  Great hostess, terrific waitress (Ashley?) and super support team.  The only off note was the douchebag bartender who was at least honest when he said that if you want good beer you can't get it there but lose the attitude bro; you're not guest starring on an episode of ""NCIS: Los Angeles"" yet.

Food is amazing...we had oysters, french toast foie gras, steaks, mac and cheese, parmesan fries, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  My steak (at 10 oz strip) was well prepared and the accompanying horseradish sauce was epic.  However, for $41 I thought it was a bit pricey.   The sides are all about $11 or $12 and they are Delicious (mac and cheese, asparagus and mashed potatoes were standouts) but the portions are not that big.  

So you see me use words like ""phenomenal"" and ""amazing"" and you're thinking ""But Bill, you only give this place four stars.  What's up with that, yo?""

Let me break it down for you.  The things that keep it from being five stars are: 
1. Limited beer options -this is a steak house, not some OB/GYN office, right?  I mean do you want to give me a Brazilian while you force me to drink a cosmo?  Sheesh.
2. Extraordinary prices.  OMG this place is expensive.
3. The one person per use bathrooms.  There was always a line and for a men's room that's unnecessary.  We can use troughs, for heaven's sake.
4. Bathroom attendant.  Since you have to stand in the hall to wait for the can, you're sort of forced to make small talk with the guy who is awkwardly blocking the en trace to the loo.  Just not my cup of tea.
5. Great music but loud and thumpy (sort of like a date I had once).  Is this a club or a restaurant.  Prepare to be hoarse from screaming and deaf from the music after eating here.

Those five quibbles aside, this is an awesome place.",wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,2,2,4,OuwrXbr5FhL_otjKW6Dugw

Only downside was that the food was very subpar compared to the outrageous prices. Hey, if the food blew me away I have no problem paying $72 for a really good steak and over $150 per person but quite frankly I was NOT IMPRESSED! Furthermore, I got severely sick from their food last night, ruining my birthday and my husbands' birthday and our friends dual bachelor and bachelorette party last night. 

My husband and I started with the Alaskan king crab legs as an appetizer. For $32 for an appetizer, you would expect more than two barely 5"" two crab legs. The first leg my husband and I shared was really good! The second leg which I shared w him, I put a giant mouthful into my mouth and as I swallowed it, I was overwhelmed with the most fishy taste I have ever come across. It was so fishy that I practically felt like puking in my mouth. But I tried to make the most out of it. But after what happened, the entire dinner was basically ruined. I was consumed with nausea which I tried my best to fight off and NOT have it ruin our evening. 

So we told our server (amazing service FYI) and she replaced the crab leg appetizer for another appetizer. We ordered the short rib ravioli and it was absolutely delicious!!! The soft short ribs inside the ravioli was a heavenly explosion in my mouth. Highly recommend this appetizer!

As my main course, I got the 6oz filet topped w lobster and my husband got the dry aged 14 oz delmonico steak topped w lobster as well, with a side of asparagus. The good thing is you can customize your steak however you want w whatever toppings and side. So the steaks were good. Decent. I ordered mine medium rare which came out medium or well done (which I did not even tell our server) and it was good but pretty dry perhaps due to it being overcooked. I had a bite of my husband's steak dipped in bearnaise sauce. His was actually cooked medium rare like how he wanted. It wasn't dry but didn't taste any of the dry aged flavors like they talk about on their menu. Quite frankly, the food is good but for the price, I was NOT IMPRESSED. 

The rest of my night was ruined because I developed a small case of food poisoning from that rotten super fishy piece of crab leg I ate. I tried my best to tough it out but ultimately ended up cutting the night early to go to my room to throw up and sleep it off. I know it was the crab legs since this was my ONLY meal I had the entire day.

I have enjoyed almost everything I have tried here. Although I am blanking on a name they serve an amazing bread appetizer with sides of dipping sauce. I want to say it is the foie gras french toast but do not quote me on that.  Aside from that I like the caesar salad (Traditional, but I like that it is prepared with large pieces of romain vs chopped, and with fresh parmesan) For entrees I really enjoy the sea bass (When it is offered) and the chicken. You can select your sides to accompany your entree, I recommend the mac and cheese (Creamy and tasty) truffle fries (So good!) Or the mashed potatoes. As a desert person, you know I have to put in my 2 cents on these. The espresso charlotte is amazing. I have also tried the cheesecake pops, which are rather simple but good non the less.

We were greeted by the best waitress/server I've seen in a long time; Michelle.  She was great.  Friendly, professional, attentive, knowledgeable, sweet, hot, fun, the whole package.  I took charge of the appetizers and we had a large seafood platter with crab, lobster, shrimp, oysters, sauces, and all kinds of other goodies.  I ordered 4 different salads for the table to share.  I roll with a pretty picky bunch when it comes to food.  I didn't hear a single complaint and all the appetizer plates were cleaned off!

Time for the entrees.  I ordered the ""24 oz. porterhouse, medium rare, sliced off the bone please""!  OMG! Hot, juicy, perfectly marbled, sliced against the grain, so every beefy, juicy, fatty morsel was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  The sides were also wonderful.  The creamy Yukon potatoes, the parmesan truffle fries, the mushroom pot-pie, and of course, the mac n' cheese.  Each one brought a new element of flavor and texture to the party.  I don't have a negative thing to say about any of the food.  We all ordered different cuts of meat.  Some had the petite fillet, the cowboy rib-eye, the bone-in fillet, one of the ladies even ordered the roasted Dover sole! ( I take no responsibility for that one, but when she wasn't looking, I took a piece and that too was delish!)  Dessert time.  Michelle approached me and asked me if we'd like to see a dessert menu.  I told her it was my friend's birthday.  She simply said. ""Would you like me to take care of it?""  Awesome!  That is exactly what I wanted to hear.  She took the initiative and made it happen.  A large tray with an assortment of desserts showed up a few minutes later with ""Happy Birthday"" inscribed in chocolate across the platter with candles.  Perfect.  I love it when a server takes control, shows leadership and ""hooks it up"".  All I remember is taking a spoonful of bread pudding, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, drenched in a warm caramel sauce topped with what I think was Cap'n Crunch cereal and thinking to myself, ""Now, I can die!"".

In all honesty, I've had a better steak at CUT or Mastro's in Beverly Hills, but this steak is a very close second.  But neither CUT nor Mastro's (in the numerous times that I've been to each) even comes close to the service we got and the fun time we had at STK. NOT! EVEN! CLOSE!

Now, for the party that broke out in the restaurant during dinner.  This is where the fun comes in.  The resident DJ was inspiring!  He played the coolest, hippest, most fun, and most want-to-get-out-of-your-seat-and-sing-and-dance-along music ever!  From Sinatra, Bon Jovi, Journey, Kid Rock, Joan Jett, Jay-Z, Lady Ga-Ga, Madonna.  He turned this already loud and happening restaurant into a full blown night club.  We and the three or four tables around us were up and singing and dancing and jumping, and laughing, and drinking, and hugging like it was a wedding or something.

The nine of us all agreed, this was the most fun, and most memorable dinner experience we've ever had.  The next time you go to Vegas with a large group, go to STK, ask to sit in Michelle's section and be ready to party!

Thank you STK, Michelle and the rest of your team.  You guys gave us a night we'll never forget.",0gOzNeAGQemcUV_vKb2iuw,1,0,5,XYriz7Wv7WXG6dxmSItrPQ
5668701,2017-12-27,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"I've known about STK for a few years now and heard they serve wonderful food and steak. I finally decided to test this rumor out during my vacation in Vegas and the quality of their meat rang true. My date and I ordered a medium fillet with truffle butter to share since we also wanted to try their glazed beef short rib and a few appetizers. This is by far the best steak I've ever had cooked for me, it melted in my mouth! I want to come back and try every topping. I don't eat red meat often but I actually crave this steak cause the quality exceeded my expectations so much; it's just that darn good! 

The short rib was disappointing, I have complete opposite feelings about it. The server said it's slow cooked for about 18 hours or so, which made me think oh wow this must be good... but  unfortunately there was too much fat inside the meat to enjoy. It felt like I was eating lard and just looking at fatty pieces in each cut. I didn't touch it anymore after two bites. 

The starters were simply amazing! We had the beef tartare, which was made just how it should be, and served with small, thin slices of toast. The day boat scallops came in two huge pieces wrapped in bacon, I was pleased. The yellow tail appetizer was my favorite one, there's a crunchy spicy kick to this and it's fabulous to start with. Every table also gets a thick brioche drizzled in their own in house delicious garlic butter/cheese type of sauce. This bread is so fluffy and gooey to eat.

Before we had the chance to order a drink however, our server came and seated us.  There were not many people in the restaurant since it was early, so we had plenty of attention.

We started with a couple of their beautiful cocktails.  I don't remember the name of mine, but it had basil and jalapeno in a vodka martini styled drink....amazing.  Hubby had one that infused cucumber and mint in a vodka martini style....his was good too.

We started with salads - I had the burrata with tomatoes, and my husband got the wedge.  They were both very good, but I tried not to eat all mine so I would not fill up too fast.  We then each ordered filets - 6 oz. for me 10 oz. for him - and with a recommendation from our server, mine included blue butter and his included truffle butter.  Both were indulgent add ons, but boy were they good.  The steaks were so tender you could almost cut them with a fork, and they were prepared perfectly medium as requested.  We also had the jalapeno grits and grilled asparagus as sides.  Now, we are southerners, and I make a mean bowl of cheese grits, so maybe that's why we were so disappointed in the jalapeno grits....they just didn't have much taste.  I have to say though, it was the only thing we were disappointed in all night.  The grilled asparagus was perfect too.

When our server offered dessert, we were hesitant because we were pretty full.  But we had heard so much about their desserts - particularly the donuts - that we were not sure we could pass it up.  So, at the urging of the server, we ordered the donuts and a coffee for me and an aperitif for hubby.  O - M - G!!!!  Those donuts were like heaven on a plate.  Warm and light and flavorful....it was sinful!!  I think I dreamed about them later....haha!

Overall, our service was outstanding....maybe because there were not many people there when we arrived, but it was filling up fast.  The food could not be beat.  It was not inexpensive, but we felt like it was completely worth the splurge.  With so many restaurants in Vegas, it's hard to commit to going to the same place again, but you can bet we will visit STK again when we're in Vegas next time.",oJSrYYLwAu3Uh3R49hr92w,0,0,5,hOiBHIDZHPLHS17H_TAnww
5680234,2018-03-12,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"The world consists out of two types of people: those who do believe it is worth paying decent money for a good steak and those who don't. STK manages to cater to both.

I certainly belong to the first category, I love a good steak and I try to include a high-end steakhouse whenever I visit Vegas. After a friend's recommendation and as we were staying in the Cosmopolitan anyways, we booked STK for 9 of us during our latest Vegas trip. My 14 oz dry-aged Delmonico was perfect, the taste was sublime and it was seared just like I requested. Although the waitress recommended one side per person, we went for 5 sides for 9 people. All of them were very good, especially the truffle risotto and the asparagus were big hits.

Some of my friends are not as big of a meat lover as I am and ordered a non-steak entree. I would call you crazy if you ordered something else in a steakhouse but all the dishes looked really good, even the fish dish (Dover Sole) looked great and my friends seemed to enjoy it. So kudos for STK to also please people who are less fond of steak.

All of us, both steak lovers and non-steak lovers agreed that it was one of the better or even the best steakhouse experience in Vegas!",9tliQ8H9xcGN8iVl55nx_g,1,1,4,RqUBVlmelsMVbRu1aZC-Ig

The description suits this restaurant since it is conveniently located one level above Marquee Nightclub.

On the most recent trip I had the 10 oz loin steak as entree plus sides of the sweet corn pudding, mushroom pot pie and Parmesan truffle fries.  Appetizers we had were the crispy lobster tails, lil burgers and a tomato caprese salad.

I love the look of the place; from the white washed brick to the cool slotted walls. The decor is very hip and trendy. There is even a DJ, but beware it does get quite loud in there. The lighting was also a little weird, my husband basically had a spotlight on his side of the table and anytime something white (a plate or napkin) hit the light it was blinding. 

After taking in the scenery, we were greeted with melted bleu cheese bread with a chive dipping sauce. Bleu cheese is one of those things that you either love or hate and unfortunately I hate it. I found it an odd choice since it does have such a strong flavor, but I was able to enjoy the middle of the bread and the sauce was very different from anything I had tasted before.

We started with the foie gras french toast and it was disgusting! It is literally french toast, a roasted apple, and a giant slab of foie gras. I can see how it would work for some people but it just didn't work at all for me. We went out on a limb on this one and we fell out of the tree!

My husband got the bone in rib-eye and it was heaven. It was the perfect combination of fat and meat. I had the small filet and it was also spectacular. It was tender, even though I like my meat on the well done side. We didn't opt for any toppings but we did try the chimichurri sauce and it really wasn't worth it. The steaks came with a small side of onions and they were an unexpected highlight. I had regular sauteed onions but my husband had spicy onions that were delicious with the steak. They absolutely know how to cook a mouth-watering steak here!

We also tried 2 sides, but both were disappointing. The mac and cheese would be absolutely stunning if it had any flavor at all. It has a perfect crispy topping and is cheesy but there is really no flavor. Even a little salt would have taken the dish to the next level. 

We also tried the mushroom pot pie. When the server brought it out I was so excited to dive into it, but then the unthinkable happened, he cut the top off and dumped it on a plate! I wanted to scream out, but resisted the urge. The mushroom flavor was so overpowering and I love mushrooms. It really needed more pastry, we only had the thin top and it was buried under all the filling. It was so sad.

Overall, the service was great and the steak was delicious, but what's a steak without sides? There are many other places in Vegas that can cook a great steak and provide me with excellent side options.

The decor is white brick walls with outrageous decorations and a trendy purple lighting scheme, and it's a fairly dim restaurant. I felt like I stepped into a futuristic lounge. The wine selection is thorough, and the waiter was knowledgeable about each of the wines and the recommended pairing. They have a delicious appetizer cheese bread!! I wanted to scarf down a couple of loafs before the steak!

The main meal came approximately 25 minutes after ordering. The steak itself (strip steak, medium) was cooked exactly as specified, and the flavor was excellent. I decided to order it au poivre, but I think some of the steak's flavor was lost in the peppercorns. I wouldn't order it again this way. The sides come separately but I ordered the asparagus which was phenomenal.

I would give 5 stars but we were made to wait 5 minutes for a table for an unspecified reason. No one else was waiting at the reception desk and the restaurant wasn't crowded. 4 stars.",vnUBxiqDsSvDl8QHbuz0cQ,0,0,4,D5zYCjw83b2W5VRZ6ZAEVQ

My aunt and I ordered a side of mashed potatoes to share - big mistake. It was literally half a cup of mashed potatoes, if that.

Maybe I'm just getting old but I hated it overall. Music was so loud I could barely hear my friend right next to me and couldn't hear a word our server said. I get that they're going for a fun atmosphere, but it's a restaurant not a club. I go to nice overpriced dinners to enjoy my friends company, not listen to blasting hip hop and the drunk douchebags next to me. 

Petite filet, mac & cheese and corn pudding (creamed corn) were good, but not exceptional - you can get the exact same meal at any steakhouse in Vegas. Probably for a little less.  Cocktails were good but not worth $18-22/drink. 

Avoid the foie grass French toast appetizer - love them separately but the flavors together with cooked apples is a big fail. Especially after factoring in the ridiculous $24 price tag.

Really mediocre service from the Asian dude server too - we had to ask for the wine list and saw him 4 times - took order, brought wine list, took drink orders, brought check. Not sure if there were no specials or he didn't feel like telling us. To be fair, maybe he's just accepted the fact that nobody can hear what the eff he's saying because of the music. 

Mastro's next door in Crystals is so much better then this place - classy and beautiful restaurant, exceptional service and food. It's not stuffy so you can still have a good time there.

Its super loud inside, so if you are looking for a place where you can have a conversation, STK is not the place.  However, there is lots of good music.  I think they have a DJ playing top 40, so you can get your pre-club game on.  

The service is pretty good, the waitress answered all of my questions.  

Needless to say, the food is pretty amazing.  Meat is cooked exactly how you ask for it to be cooked.  The side dishes are also pretty good.

Bar Drinks 

We arrived about 5 minutes before our table was ready and had cocktails at the bar. I had the cucumber basil drink - it was amazing!  My partner had an old fashion- it was good.
  

Ambiance 

This place is very trendy with purple uplighting and a live DJ.  I really liked the vibe.  There isn't a view, so if you're looking for that, go to the Eiffel tower restaurant - amazing views of the Bellagio fountains there.

Food

We ordered the tuna tartar to start with.  It was good, but nothing out of this world- good presentation though.  The serve it with homemade taro chips.  They were good, but get stuck in your teeth.  

They serve completely bread with melted blue cheese and an oil sauce on the side.  It was okay- a bit cold.

For our main course we each ordered the filet with crab on top and the mac n cheese side dish.  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium throughout the steak, however... it lacked any sort of flavor.  Number one thing is season the food!  I've had better steaks at Outback - not joking.  The mac-n-cheese was good, but again, nothing that wowed us.... then again we're spoiled with The Porch mac-n-cheese in Dallas.

Waiter 

He was... okay, but not very attentive.  I hardly ate my steak which one would think he'd ask if everything was okay, but he lacked sense in that department.  We were ready to pay up and it took awhile to get our bill.  It was our anniversary and they brought a complementary dessert with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate sauce... the waiter put his hand in it when he set it down, so no photo-op for the anniversary dessert.

Restrooms 

They have one stall for men and women, and apparently when it's later in the evening, the attendant lets anyone go in the stall.  A man came out of the men's ... so I used it.  The attendant looked inside (maybe to see if there was toilet paper) and walked out and said okay it's good.  I understand that men's restrooms are ... less than desirable, but I'm in a nice restaurant, and would think the attendant would have put the seat down and cleaned the urine off the seat... but no.  I just hovered.  

Summary 

Perhaps l they were  having an off night, it happens, but we were highly underwhelmed.  It will take a lot to get us to go back to the Vegas location for food again.  I really wanted to like this place too- my gf said it was awesome when she went a week ago.",Dg6im9Z3KGhtSjOmp10C0A,0,0,2,lK-L5YJcoCiFl6EbdYTBng

For apps, we ordered two different tartares, a few salads, and a crab tortellini.  The avocados were a little overwhelming, covering over most of the taste. The crab was okay, but it seemed a little dry. Good combo with the sauce though. For the entree, a few of us got the special, a 16 oz ribeye. Imo, it seemed a little small, and wasnt exactly cooked to what we ordered (medium rare for most). You would expect them to get that right..granted,  they were quick to recook a different piece, which we appreciated. I've definitely had better steak, but this was a great place nonetheless.

My companion had a porterhouse steak and refused to leave the table until the entire steak was devoured...what an epic fail that was!

It's extremely pricey! So be prepared to spend on average about $60 p/p without factoring in adult beverages.

5881014,2012-05-14,0,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Came here for a work dinner while at a conference in Vegas - we had a private room... which was very small and had black padded walls... We were told that the room could only accommodate 16 guests (which was the size of our party)... they probably should have scaled the maximum down to 12 - we literally were sitting elbow to elbow, with a couple people actually sitting at the corners of the rectangular table.

Service was very attentive while we were in the room, and we were able to adjust the volume of the music (which was good, as in the regular dining room the music was on the level of techno club blaring), as well as the temperature.

On the whole, the food was very good.  We started with several trays of cold seafood - jumbo prawns, chilled lobster, and raw oysters.  Everything was very very fresh.  I had the king crab salad with with melon, mache, and i believe some grapefruit.  It was beautifully presented, but in terms of taste, just okay -  strangely a little on the salty side with not much actual crab flavor.  I ordered the 10 oz. filet with truffle butter, cooked a perfect medium rare.  We all ordered different sides, and so I got to try a whole variety of them - some of my favorites were the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes with lobster, mushroom pot pie, and the garlic truffle fries.  We went through several bottles of good wine (I sampled some chardonnays and a couple cabs), and I ended the meal with an incredibly flavorful mango sorbet, which was the perfect finish to such a large meal.

Overall, I would give STK a 3.5 rating -- the food is very good for the most part, although it is definitely on the pricier side.  The service is attentive as well, however the ambiance of the restaurant overall is a little strange (although I guess it IS Vegas).  I would recommend for a party of 8-10 (to snag a private room, but have enough room to eat without having to sit on top of your neighbor) - I can't imagine being able to have any sort of conversation out in the regular dining room since the music was blaring so loud.",ITbEs_y1LuKb_AxMVAG74A,0,0,3,vmG5gy_BphkWRRxwMq9VAQ
5882896,2014-10-28,1,bpRo8L8dkhgbJhdIKa9mwA,"Such a nice surprise for my birthday trip to Vegas.  I wanted somewhere fun, good, and not too expensive to have a birthday dinner and this was perfect.

PARKING: It's located in Cosmo, on the 3rd floor.  If you park in self-parking you have to walk kind of far because it's located near the lobby.

ATMOSPHERE: The inside is dark and trendy.  With hanging ball lights and cool fixtures.  I made reservations for 6pm because we had to get to the club early and it was slightly crowded, but I'm sure it gets more crowded later on at night.  It was perfect for a fancy birthday dinner.  We got a half booth half table with 3 people sitting on chairs.  For attire I could see you getting away with a nice skirt and top, fancy top and jeans or dress.  You can't be overdressed here.

I heard the music was super loud and fun, which makes the dinner experience better but at 6pm the music was kind of soft and more old school.  I think as the night went on it got louder and they were slowly making their way into the 90s but we didn't stay long enough to experience it.  

FOOD: 

STEAK - Their cheapest steak is like $39 and they have a lot of other options but if you don't like steak I wouldn't come here.  My suggestion is to share the steak with someone else because it is pretty big and expensive.  My boyfriend and I shared the bone in rib steak (basically the rib eye) and it was plenty for both of us.  The steak itself doesn't come with anything so it's recommended you get sides ($12 each!) We got 4 to share among the 8 of us and it was plenty.  Beware though because we got the truffle mac n cheese and that was more than $12.  You can get ""toppings"" on top of your steak but it's not needed.  The steak itself is very flavorful and tasty without anything.

SIDES -
Truffle mac n cheese - The mac was the round short pastas usually in macaroni salad and I really liked that.  A good crust on the top with a yummy truffle flavor and pretty creamy mac n cheese.

Truffle parmesan fries - They are thickly cut and are more like potato rectangles than fries.  They are stacked like Jenga and have parmesan and truffle oil on them. They were a little too potato-y and thick for my liking but everyone at the table loved them.

Mushroom pot pie - A weird side but it was literally a pot pie with mushrooms, onions and a creamy sauce inside.  It tasted like truffle but I don't even know if it had truffle.  The top is a light crust, which wasn't that flaky and pretty thin.

Bok Choy - Weird for a steak place but it was kinda spicy.  Very flavorful though with lots of soy sauce and garlic.  Not bad actually for some greens.

Overall very impressed with STK.  I thought it would be more for the atmosphere but the food was really good! They even brought me out this chocolate cake/mousse for my birthday with a candle :)",PB3OEIzQGx_p6VdpzX3Feg,4,1,4,BD4O1Box3aVZB4EZTu0CdA

Foie gras and waffles - Meh.

Filet - OK, a little cold. 

Potatoes - tasted like flour. Very starchy. Not good.

Mac n cheese - average.

Creamed corn - probably my favorite part. 

We had another side but I don't even remember it (that says something).

Come to think of it, maybe, the bread was my favorite part. Although, when I asked our server if there was bread coming out she snapped at me. I WAS HUNGRY, GEEZ!

I went there on Tuesday evening, a regular busy night for this upscale classy restaurant. I didn't have a dinner reservation, but I don't think that should be an excuse for my unpleasant experience. I took important clients there to enjoy the fine dining they have to offer.  Usually I receive a well mannered and qualified service to match the high priced dining.  Instead we were rushed to finish our meals and the meal quality wasn't the same as with my past experiences.  All my courses came out too quick.  The service was very fast paced, which is not the norm for $125 dollar per person.  Fine dining at that price usually allows you to enjoy your meal with adequate time and patient professional waiters to attend you.

STK is a nice, simple name for a venue when you're texting a group of 15 dudes on a bachelor party for a Saturday night dinner. Let's face it though, any decent steakhouse located in the Cosmo would be killing it right about now regardless of the restaurant caliber. Granted this place is better than average in food quality, ambiance and eye candy, it does lack in service. Sure your server will possess pulchritude and a coquettish demeanor but she'll forget to bring your app or drink, after the 10 minutes you had to wait to flag her down. 
Whatever though, it's the place to see and be seen in Vegas, if you can get a table for your party, that is. In our predicament, we had to haphazardly stroll in in groups of three or four; and that was only to talk our way into geographically undesirable bar tables (since we couldn't get an after 6 reso for the big group). 

The Lamb Chops I ordered made for a solid entree. Albeit my long-time bias to skirt steak, I don't think the price break (comparatively speaking) was worth going with that carne asada option. Also the complimentary bread here is awesome.",vuSlHyn9gkdfZq9h00O-yA,1,1,4,tzwh93Ye7CEX97w0SB8Niw

I can't decide which was my favorite because they were so different. The burrata was possibly the best I'd ever had. 

We also had the parmesan truffle fries, which were moreso like truffle wedges - but nonetheless, very good and flavorful. 

Lastly, we had the STK donuts, which were made from sweet potatoes and had a maple pecan glaze on top. I just...can't.

Very nice ambience in the restaurant and they placed great music. Outside of the restrooms a man in a bow tie had a table full of all sorts of toiletries, for a tip, of course. I was surprised they only had one male and one female restroom stall for the entire restaurant. When the line got longer, the gentleman did inform people there were more restrooms outside of the restaurant in the hotel -- but, I for one, didn't want to make that trek out of the restaurant through the hotel in my heels.

Expect to pay top dollar ($$$$). My friends thought the food was great but I just wasn't super impressed and thought it was A-OK, especially for the price. The bread comes warm and is served with a yummy oil dipping sauce. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. Steaks are $50+ dollars for small cut of meat.
