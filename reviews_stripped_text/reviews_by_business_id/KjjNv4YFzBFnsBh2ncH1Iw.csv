44685,2012-01-06,0,KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw,"As I was driving around looking for something to eat around the Summerlin area, I stumbled finding this place. I yelped it to check if it had a good amount of stars and read some of the reviews. So why not give it a try for myself? 

I came here on New Years Day and it was pretty busy, but there were seats available so I was glad there was no wait because the place itself is very small. The workers didn't seem to friendly because there were running around everywhere, plus it took about 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. Finally we were seated and handed a menu. I did notice the prices; the prices were a little more expensive then most small Chinese restaurants.

Everything on the menu looked good but the one thing that caught my eyes was the Seafood Hot and Sour soup. I haven't seen hot and sour soup with seafood in any other place I have gone to. The soup was good but really spicy. I love spicy food but after a while my mouth just started burning. So if you're a spicy fan I would highly recommend trying it. The Salt and Pepper Shrimp sounded good too so I decided to give that a shot. There were a lot of shrimp and the shrimp was loaded with flavor. If you want rice you have to make sure you tell the server.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,0,0,3,nH4wTPv9s0WNrLjGNYvvlg

131835,2011-12-06,0,KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw,"In many respects China Tango is your typical neighborhood Chinese-American restaurant:  they have take-out/dine in, and the menu is immediately recognizable with all of the staples. 

What sets this place apart from everywhere else (especially Panda Express) is the staff , the quality of the food, and the exceptional lunch menu. 

Every employee we have encountered is absolutely wonderful and takes great pride in their service, appearance, and attitude. On my last visit we were seated behind a very typical  Summerlin family with a teenage twit  who felt it was her job to make sure everything was 5 star quality (""What do you mean this chicken isn't free range? Why don't you serve Bling water?"") and never once did the waitress lose a beat or let the level of service for the rest of her full section drop. 

I'm not sure what it is- perhaps a combination of the smell and ingredients that are higher quality than most neighborhood eateries- but the food here is simply amazing. We've been in about 5 times now and every dish has been delicious and perfectly cooked. My personal favorite is the mu-shu pork and my wife is a huge fan of the volcano shrimp (I have to disagree with other comments about the soup- it's great)

So, long story short- if you live in the area definitely check this place out! I would say it's even worth the drive if you live further out.",kZXg8y7GVvGGKT4jVeSs8w,0,0,4,vacmMEYlUHl_XPbwEpnRkw

405816,2011-11-05,0,KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw,"First, a curious note.  The restaurant seems to refrigerate its dishes;  hot tea was served in icy teapots that promptly rendered the tea insipid.  Delicious hot spring rolls cooled off immediately.  Very odd.

My wife vouches for their excellent entrees;  I can't.  The wait staff were so chaotic that I could only watch her eat while they ran crashing around the restaurant.  We flagged them down repeatedly, but amid frenzied prepping to-go orders and serving other table guests, they never got my order out

I cancelled my order when she'd finished her meal, and we left.  There was much hilarious wringing of hands over my cancellation, but we simply could not wait longer.

We hope the staff there gets adequate rest, and stops mimicking the Keystone Kops. If the restaurant ever organizes itself, it will likely be a winner.",ofKDkJKXSKZXu5xJNGiiBQ,2,0,2,jLhK75wee9zPnUR95wpJcQ

614609,2013-01-12,0,KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw,"Decent Americanized Chinese but Rude ""Service""

We live very close to this and it's one of the only Chinese places in our area, so we stopped in to eat in or takeout a couple of times with so-so results. For dining in, the food is usually pretty good but the service is extremely casual and slow - and there is a major language barrier as English is not the first language of any of the employees. Takeout, pretty much the same. The last two times, we ordered delivery and had such a poor experience that I will never patronize this establishment again.

The first delivery, the food arrived quickly, but they forgot the white rice that comes with one of the dishes. We called and they said it would take at least 45 minutes to get the rice to us (bear in mind we literally live 3 minutes from the restaurant, and we are talking about WHITE RICE, which they scoop up already made from a giant vat), and asked if we would prefer to get a credit for the order to use next time. We said OK since we didn't want to wait and figured it would be easier to make our own rice. I asked if we needed anything to get the credit and she said no, it would be in their system.

The next time we called, we asked about the credit and they had no record of it (and did not honor it), even though they were able to pull our name and address info up with our phone number. Ok, whatever, we were hungry so we ordered anyway. The food took forever to arrive - probably over an hour. The food was quite dry and fairly cold, but my expectations for delivery are never very high. I then pulled out my Hot & Sour Soup to find that it was actually Wonton Soup. I was disappointed as I figured that at least that would be good (and I do not care for Wonton Soup), so I called to tell them. At first, the incredibly rude woman said, ""Are you SURE that's what you ordered?"" I said, ""Yes, of course. I have never ordered Wonton Soup in my life."" Then she says in a snarky tone, ""Well, that's why we always read the orders back to you, to make sure it is correct."" And I said, ""Well, it was my husband you spoke to, but I heard him order Hot & Sour, and he says you DID repeat Hot & Sour back to him. AND, the last time we ordered from you, you also made a mistake and..."" she then cuts me off ""Well see, it is your fault then, it is your husband if this happened twice, and I cannot take responsibility for that!"" Obviously at this point it is getting heated, and I say, ""No! YOU forgot the white rice last time. There's no way that's our fault.""  So this bickering goes on for several minutes until I finally say, ""So are you saying you're not going to take responsibility for this?"" And she responds, ""No, I am not going to take responsibility."" And I say, fine, I will never order from you you again."" And she actually replies with ""Fine."" And then we both hang up!

Let me just say here, I am not a difficult customer. I worked in foodservice for 10 years when I was younger, I always tip very well, and I am quite forgiving when things happen that are out of people's control. But I have NEVER in my 38 years been treated so poorly by someone who is in the SERVICE industry. I did not get her name, but I can avow, I will NEVER eat at China Tango again.",PMDIhIMp-KGW-Pyd2GibDg,3,0,1,_Ps3nRpxqmzMKIIB9HVdSQ

1055986,2014-03-01,1,KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw,"Not exaggerating...this was the worst Chinese food I've had. Anywhere. Ever. 

A coworker recommended China Tango a few weeks ago and said it was her favorite Chinese place so I decided to give it a try. I walked in and ordered 1) Hot and Spicy Shrimp, and 2) Beef and Broccoli. The hostess was really nice, polite, and said my food would be ready in 20 minutes. 

20 minutes later, I was back. My food was ready to go so I paid (thinking it was a little on the pricey side for a non-fancy Chinese place, but figured the food would be worth it based on the recommendation) and was off on my way home. Problem number one, the way they packed the food: two containers of rice on the bottom, hot and spicy shrimp (in a styrofoam container) in the middle, and the beef (in plastic Tupperware container) on top. I made a right turn and the dishes on top toppled over and the shrimp sauce spilled right out (into the plastic bag but still...a mess. And now my car smelled like ketchup. More on that later.). Maybe I should have reorganized the food in the bag Tetris-style but I'm not a huge takeout person so the thought never occurred to me. But it should occur to the people at China Tango, no??? Well, it didn't.

Then the food. So bad. So bad. So bad. 

Beef and broccoli: the beef was rubbery and fatty. Seriously yucky. The sauce was completely bland. The broccoli and carrots were fresh and crunchy but I didn't pay $15 for broccoli and carrots! 

Hot and Spicy Shrimp: shrimp was breaded then tossed with onions and like a whole bottle of ketchup.  Maybe two. Even my daughter asked, ""why does the house smell like ketchup?"" when I opened up the container.  This was quite possibly the worst dish I've ever had. Setting aside the ketchup for a second, why would you bread shrimp only to mix it in a thick sauce? It ends up being soggy. Seriously, all around gross. 

Unless you've got a thing for ketchup, I'd suggest staying far away from China Tango.",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,3,1,1,sDK71vnokef9N1mk6tulzA

So only 2 tables going in the entire place. I must admit the food was good, very fresh ingriedients and nicely presented. HOWEVER the dam waitress wouldn't stop texting on her cell phone the entire time in the dining room in plain view of the  5 customers that were in there. So we were sitting there with empty glasses and could not get our drinks refilled and when we did manage to finally get her attention she seemed pissed and discombobulated that we interupted her Texting session. When trying to get the check we actually had to go up front to the manager cause miss Texty wouldnt look up from her phone. Ironically the Manager was sitting up front on her laptop searching for Christmas sale items. I was always under the impression that the Customer was supposed to be #1 not the Cell Phone/Computer. So if you want to go and recieve awful service from a 16 year old waitress texting while she's supposed to be servicing customers this is the place to go.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the interior- it was clean, well designed, and visually appealing.  They appeared to be doing a rather brisk lunchtime service between take-out, delivery, and dine-in.  

I chose the General Tso's Lunch special ($6), for take-out, and sat in their reception area, which very conveniently, had a great selection of magazines for me to read while I waited. All of the lunch specials included either white rice, brown rice, or chow mien, and a cup of egg drop soup and were priced at either $6 or $7.

The food itself was piping hot, but was pretty average.  A little on the greasy side, but a large, filling portion. Definitely had a lot of kick and spice to it, as my lips were burning by the end of the dish. I'd rate it as on par with Panda Express.

The garden tofu was pretty good.  A nice selection of fresh vegetables and good chunks of fried tofu.  The paper chicken was also good but searing hot and covered in foil.  I had to wait 10 minutes before I could even handle the foil. The Mongolian beef was sweet not spicy, which was annoying.

I've gotten takeout here twice and delivery once.  Each time, ordering was huge saga because the workers have limited English skills.  Which makes me think they have some hidden gems on their menu or off-menu.  But I don't have the patience or language skills to find out.  Delivery was super fast, which I appreciate.

All in all, good in a pinch but I'd rather order from Pan Asian or go to Chinatown.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,1,1,3,u8CxqxJrJeJOy6XjxkJ5YA

Most Asian places don't include soup unless you dine in. It's a little better and cheaper than Panda Express but you get a bigger portion and soup. It's not the best nor the worst Chinese food I've had but definitely hits the spot when you want Chinese food.

These people could fry a boot and it would be delicious! I'm also happy to report that the service here has been on their best behavior ever since we've been dining here. Very prompt, polite, plus the food is always whipped up super fast! They have been consistent and we haven't been let down yet. Plus, they don't rush you out close to closing! We arrived 15 minutes to closing and they welcomed us with no problems or attitude, I love that kind of customer service!

I don't know how they get away with charging so cheap! All of their dishes have very honest pricing, in Summerlin too, of all places! What makes me want to tilt my head with confusion - is the extremely generous portions they serve up. These plates are packed with lots of shrimp, beef, chicken and wings, without much filler. A great place for family style dining, or you be like us and take the large boxes (yup plural) of leftovers for an indulgent lunch the next day. 

Favorites:
Honey Walnut Shrimp $12 - plate full of glazed, plump, jumbo succulent shrimp & crispy sweet caramelized walnuts - for that portion size? you can't go wrong.

Sweet & Sour Pork $10 - they're super generous with the crispy pork morsels and the batter, although thick, is extremely fluffy and crispy!

Mongolian Beef $11 - very bold flavor and the beef is super tender. This is a little spicy from the fresh Serrano chilies so be careful if you're not a fan of spice - we loved it though!

Egg Fried Rice (upgrade) $2.50 - always upgrade! They give so much fried rice with lots of fluffy egg bits and it's not too oily.

Salt & Pepper Wings $6 - this takes about 10 minutes longer to prepare but it's worth the wait. I'm shocked by how many wings they give you for $6! The batter is light and extremely crispy and flavorful - sooo good!

Corn Egg Drop Soup $1 - a comforting classic egg drop soup and the bits of corn adds surprise texture.

Crab Rangoon (cream cheese wontons) $5 - classic crowd pleaser. Simple but generously stuffed with cream cheese and fried perfectly crispy.

I also always ask for their hot chili in oil, it's flavorful and adds nice spiciness to all of the dishes.

Pro tip: Don't complain if you're ordering sweet & sour pork or honey walnut shrimp and you're on a diet - you shouldn't be ordering that in the first place! Diet free zone!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,35,32,5,JTZxR-KxB_OXtxV7TDEQ7g

Anyway, I ordered the garden tofu lunch special ($6) with chow mein noodles. I was given a hot and sloppy plate of noodles, tofu (3 large pieces), and veggies covered in lots of brown sauce. The vegetables were cooked nicely but I was not a fan of the sweet and salty flavors. My taste buds were like, no por favor, dude. I disliked the baby corn and water chestnuts that came with it. And that's something I don't get about fast Chinese food and probably never will. The noodles that came were a mountain of Medusa's hair extensions. They were greasy, slithery, and totally unappetizing. Had they lightened on the sauce; added more onions and cabbage; and not cooked them for too long, I would have eaten more of it. Steamed brown rice would have been a better option but they charge a dollar extra, which is a bunch of bullshit. Shouldn't fried rice and chow mein be charged extra because you're using extra man power and other ingredients?  Oh well. Other add-ons include an okay egg drop soup and an unnecessary bowl of fried wonton strips with dipping sauces. I didn't sample the latter but it was a sweet gesture.

This small, charming, new Chinese Café/Restaurant is located in a shopping plaza in Summerlin. It has a neat and inviting decor. It has a good selection of Lunch Specials of typical Chinese cuisines; complete with soup, chips, and a side of rice or fried Chowmein, for $6 or $7 each, thus, of excellent value.

The waitresses are very friendly and quite accommodating.
- The Szechuan Spicy Chicken I ordered had excellent aroma, texture and presentation, but surprisingly, it was unsually ""too SWEET"" at every bite! I asked kindly and half-jokingly my friendly server if the chef had used sugar instead of salt by any chance. She was helpful and accommodating, and actually went to talk to the chef about it, who said it was no mistake, but was totally WILLING to re-make the dish with less sugar! Well, to me, that is a mark of good business practice, I was impressed.
- Yes, I have had Szechuan style spicy dishes in restaurants in SZECHUAN, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and in a few Chinatowns in the States, but no, I have never tasted a Szechuan dish with such sweetness before. Well, at least the chef at ChinaTango was willing to remake the dish! The helpful waitress offered her good advice that the next time I order, make sure to ask the chef to go easy with the sugar! Good advice, I'll definitely go back and give it another try.

- Based on the happy faces of other customers, the cuisines must be pretty good in general. I'll definitely go back there and try other items in the menu.

By the way, another plus for this Chinese Café: - It has a very CLEAN bathroom, complete with paper towels.

The only dishes I did like was the kung-pow chicken and the fish with black bean sauce which were pretty good.  This is an ok Chinese Restaurant, not the best nor the worst.",4_cGIuyL3HG3-65RrXU_lw,0,0,3,yIkNQziulYcVkEPtt7bx0g

5199006,2012-01-05,10,KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw,"Here you will find all your favorite American-Chinese hits in a pleasant environment. We stopped in for lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. It definitely feels more like a sit down restaurant than a Chinese to-go spot. The service was kind despite me flipping out when they informed me it would be $3 per person for brown rice, and I am still flipping out about that one. 

The lunch specials were nicely priced, but I was not impressed with the serving portion.  I ordered the garden tofu, and the flavor was okay. However, there wasn't a bounty of vegetables in this garden, which left me a little disappointed. The egg and corn soup that came with the lunch special was pretty un-spectacular. Even I could make a more flavorful version of this simple broth, and sadly, my crowning culinary achievement is toast. 

If I were hungry and in this shopping center, I wouldn't rule out stopping back in, but I think there are spots in down that do what they do a bit better.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,8,2,b4GHlVLY3f7w7RlXigGTFg

Thai tea is also good. Great staff except for this one young kinda chubby Asian kid he has no personality and is a little rude.

5495294,2015-08-31,0,KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw,"Okay so my last review of this place was based solely on the service which sucked that night but the food was always ok.  Some of our go to dishes were the salt and pepper wings and general to chicken.
They've either changed management or ownership and the new cooks are horrible.  The general to chicken is now covered in an overly greasy sauce and instead of the customary broccoli there were huge hunks of undercooked red onion and pineapple.  Why?
The salt and pepper wings have become half the size they once we're and no longer come smothered in chile's and green onion.  Very disappointed.  I made comment about the change in the dishes and was asked which I liked better.  I immediately told them the old dishes were much better.  Such a shame as we were pretty much regulars here for take out.  Time to find a new spot.",L0AoWLv7jUmM_rfDlq_Msg,1,1,1,Kft3qEiSDo2_u7th-clYCw
5516387,2012-04-08,0,KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw,"I like this tiny little space. I was quite surprised by the stylish decor and the care put into making this space look unique and special. I thought it would be a hole-in-the-wall but it is quite charming. Even the bathroom has stylish modern fixtures that put a smile on my face- felt like a fancy hotel. Nice touch!  

Anyway, the food: I LOVE the won ton soup. It's jam-packed with noodles, meat, shrimp and surprises. It's tasty and filling and wonderful.  I also love their seafood combination entree, which is made with a light garlic sauce.  I usually order these for delivery in Summerlin,   At the restaurant I had their egg-drop soup, which I enjoyed (I don't remember egg-drop having corn kernels like this one does).  The service was great.

I have to mention, in all fairness, that they aren't consistent in their delivery. Sometimes they leave out the rice or the fried won tons. I pretty much expect something to be forgotten when I order from them these days, which is not a good thing. Still, I have to give a shout-out to the delivery guy. So friendly!  I don't want to stop ordering from them because they haven't actually messed up an order, but when you can expect minor errors, you have to start considering getting your carry-out from somewhere else.


Another thing I have to say: it is pricey.  They could stand to lower the prices for their soups and entrees by at least a couple of bucks. But I'll still come here- I'd just come more often if it were cheaper.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,1,1,3,F79XnKA6ItbNKHn_cyFzPA

5730099,2014-11-16,2,KjjNv4YFzBFnsBh2ncH1Iw,Terrible food. I ordered the volcano shrimp which advertises that they serve it flaming. No flaming & tasted like shrimp with onion relish over it. I asked them why this is & they laughed & made some excuse but never offered to replace the dish. The ambiance is a 5 but don't be fooled.

The sauce in their Beef with Green Beans was gloppy and gross, it reminded me of mucus. Even the western chinese stand by, honey walnut prawns was covered in a thick hard batter!
I will give them a break. They have very attentive service, and are really nice people. Stick to the dishes with fresh veggies lightly prepared. 
But next time, I'll just drive down the street to Spring Mountain.",m8LtB4wEarC2_RiXlkJIFA,0,0,2,nLMOXnmJ0lgxZkW3NwFH0w
