Three to the bar for Cocktails prior to 1915 Dinner reservation..  I was told by the Bar tender that the bar was for dinning and that I should just go eat in the Dinning Room.  I have been coming to this resturant for 10 years and was never refused Bar Service before.  My bar bill is usually $75 dollars prior to dinner and coctails with dinner much more. This was a party of three we had to go and find a waitress, my wife ate and my sister ate, I had lost my appatite and drank water.  The food was fair at best as they were busy and the service was terrible.  Your resturant lost $200.00 easyily, because of the attitude of the Bar Tender and the poor table service.  And of course I shall bad mouth The Ranch House and never return.  There is way to much competition out there for me to be treated like this.  Good Luck Ranch House.",gt0KuGhFZB-6wPEJ4x-1Ew,4,1,1,YT0nXR08M32S8FKW6G8kxw

I was so excited that I was finally going to try this place out since I drive by it all the time and wanted a place that served some prime rib. Total disappointment when we were seated, no one approached my fiance and I. After seeing this family get service before us I was like ""oh hell no, that did not just happen."" I went to the hostess to tell her we've been sitting here for 20 minutes and no one has approached us, not even a drink order or anything. I wanted to walk out! She finally got the server but the server did not apologize for the wait or anything (this place wasn't even packed). She asked for our drink order and I told her we've been ready to order.

70839,2014-11-05,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"My wife and I have been going to Bob Taylor's since the 70's and it has always been great. In fact we always let our out of town visitors know that they really need to eat there before they leave Las Vegas for a true old Vegas experience. 
I don't know how many times the restaurant has changed hands but this past weekend was the worst experience ever. Our rib appetizer was lukewarm at best and the BBQ sauce was cold. The salad was inedible. The lettuce looked like it was the pre-packaged cheap stuff and had the smell and taste of MSG preservatives. The lettuce was soggy and the blue cheese dressing was watery and very runny. 
The baked potato that came with our steaks tasted overcooked and burnt. It had that black skin around the inside that you get from reheating old baked potatoes. We told our waitress about it and she brought us out 2 more baked potatoes that were just as bad. When we let her know again she said that fresh potatoes would not be ready for another 15 minutes.
 Although the steaks we had were very good the side dishes were so very bad that it brought down the whole meal experience. It was truly very disappointing. We will no longer refer people to Bob Taylors and after reading some of the other reviews on Yelp it seems a lot of people have had the same experience so this was not a one bad night fluke kind of thing. They seem not to care what the reviews say as it's obvious they have not made any attempt to improve the things that everyone is complaining about.

74248,2014-03-16,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"I have never had a bad experience here. I first went years ago for lunch and immediately fell in love with it. It was good food, in a nearly ""historical"" place, that smelled like a burning fireplace. County, if you will. At that time, I was searching for venues for my rehearsal dinner, and based on the size of the restaurant I figured this would be a great place. 

A week later, I brought my fianc√© there for dinner. Everything was WONDERFUL! I had filet, he had prime rib and lobster. We were sold, this was the place for our rehearsal dinner! 

I spoke with their manager over the phone and he graciously helped us plan a menu for our event. In October 2012, We had approximately 30 attendees, and our servers were so professional and relaxed, you would have thought we were a party of 4. Bob Taylor's will ALWAYS be on the top of our recommendation list. We have been to about every steakhouse in Vegas, but we love it here. It's a no-nonsense menu, good service, unpretentious, old school steak joint. No need to dress up too much, but show some respect and don't dress like a bum.

88828,2015-01-02,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"We've passed by this place for years and my husband finally decided to go try it. He had been talking Prime Rib for almost two weeks.  

We called ahead to see if you could order the dinner menu during lunch, and the lady said, yes.  Perfect!! We get there for the Prime Rib (the main reason for our visit), and that's when the lady informed us it is only served after 4 p.m. That would have been really nice to know when we previously called.

Sauteed crab cake: Nothing about this thing is sauteed, that baby was deep fried and not tasty at all. Don't waste your money on this.

Crab stuffed mushroom: Don't waste your money on this either.

Use caution with the Medium rare/Medium

Bone-In Ribeye: Hubby said it was delicious! Although he asked for a thin pink center all the way through, that baby had a thick pink center. It was beautiful!

Rack of Lamb: These were pretty good, but I should have gone medium instead of medium rare. However, I knew once I reheated them at home they were perfect medium rare. Yes!

Service: Horrible! After delivering our meal, our waitress never came back to see if we needed anything, not even water. I had to ask the other server for it. And then for a to-go box, she handed me a styro foam container. I was expecting more of a take to the kitchen and wrap for me, especially for these prices.  

Outside entrance: Who do those cats belong to? Or are they stray? Suggest getting rid of them; creepy for non-cat lovers.

I highly doubt that we'll ever go back, but if we do, maybe we'll get a chance to experience the Prime Rib. Yeah, we'll be sure to arrive after 4 p.m.",tAXkXOFlJi2rJA6HHZ_Bdg,1,0,2,Ac2DDuKZwN-3gY9K6H8lSg

I had 5 1/2 scallops drowning in a heavy sauce that did not complement the scallops at all. Scallops did not seem fresh.  The twice baked potato also did not seem to be freshly prepared.

244913,2011-06-22,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"We went to Bob Taylor's for the umpteenth time last nite.  It's close to our house and when we crave big beef, it's our first choice.  I always have the smoked prime rib, the only thing I really enjoy there (however, I have never had the lamb, so maybe next time!)  I have had both the twice baked and the regular baked potatoes, and they are both good.  I love their cheese bread that starts the meal, and I have never had appetizers mainly because the main course is usually more than enough for dinner.

I have found their creamed soups to be akin to library paste, so mostly always get the salad, which is pretty non-descript but adequate.  

I usually get the 12-oz prime rib, medium, and can never finish it,  and the smoked flavor is mild, but adds so much to the meat.  

For the first time ast night we had the all you can eat ribs for $15.99 (every Tuesday), and the ribs were very tender but had an odd herb either in the BBQ sauce or the rib marinade which I think was rosemary, but it didn't appeal to me at all.  My husband liked them, but neither of us could finish the first serving which was very generous, so that was all we could eat.

They also have a nice wine selection and what I think are very reasonable prices compared to so many of the restaurants which have 150-200% markups on wine.

Service is always good there, very attentive and friendly, and I am so glad they DO NOT have TVs with sports shows on in the restaurant.!!!!",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,1,0,4,VhlUOmSw7EnkF2t-NeamaQ
259019,2017-02-04,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"My wife and I had 6:00pm reservations for our Anniversary on a Thursday night. My wife is a native Las Vegan who hasn't experienced Bob Taylors Ranch House so I decide to give this steak house a try. We arrived about 5 minutes early to our reservation and were seated immediately. A nice hostess sat us and handed us our menus. She disappeared and came right back with some water and said our waiter would be right here. The menu looked good and we were ready for a great experience. The table next to us were a couple of young men waiting for someone to arrive before ordering. 5 minutes went by and no one has come over to take our drink or appetizer order yet. We actually haven't even been acknowledged yet. The waiter of the two young men has been by their table twice by now and they have full glasses of their drink of choice. 10 minutes and still no waiter. My wife and I are looking around and its not really busy in there. Our count was maybe 20 people and a few more at the bar on the other side. We thought maybe the hostess sat us where there wasn't anyone stationed. 15 minutes now and we are getting ready to walk out, but we gave them just a few minutes longer. The breaking point was when the two young men's company arrived and before she sat down she was greeted by a waiter and asked what she would like to drink. We were extremely disappointed at this point and just after we got up, the waiter brought the lady her drink. We were close to 20 minutes before we walked out and will never go back. The question we get most is ""why we didn't say anything after 5 minutes?"" Answer is simple.... We wanted to see how long it would take for someone to at least acknowledge that we were there. Answer was 20 minutes and when we left we stood at the hostess podium to say something and we waited there another 3 minutes, then finally left without talking to anyone. I have heard good things about Bob Taylors Ranch House, but from our experience, we have nothing good to say. Maybe better communication on station scheduling between employees and this wouldn't have happened. I hope whoever reads this and decides to try the Ranch House that they have better luck.

289338,2014-06-11,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"My husband and I went here on a Tuesday night after reading the reviews on here. That time the service was Excellent food cooked to perfection...except I don't know why everyone raves about The Twice Baked Potatoes here. It was hard as a rock and hardly any potato to eat inside. The wine selection is less to be desired. Despite all this, when our very dear friend came to Las Vegas to visit we wanted to take him here. Bob Taylor's is Not the type of Lux steak house our friend is used to, but he was excited to see just this type of sawdust joint. This time went on a Monday night. It took someone 20 mins just to come over and ask if someone was taking care of us. We were standing up and leaving when she finally came over to the table. Our friend ORDERD the Calamari. It was the only thing he ended up eating that night. He ORDERD the porterhouse steak MEDIUM. The entire thing was WAAAAYYY OVER COOKED. Well done is an understatement. My filet was fine but my Lobster Tail was WAAAAYYY OVER COOKED. Flaking apart, not wet n juicy. So we politely asked to send them back. She brought out my new Lobster Tail. Perfect! Well 35 minutes later our friends Porterhouse STILL had not come out!!! When it finally did arrive, it was RAW!! Like really really raw. Like the cook just threw it on to seer the outside on both sides but the inside was completely RAW!! Gross!!! It's like we were in the movie WAITING. So, my friend was disgusted, we were embarrassed anD asked for the check. All she did was not charge for the Steak, and take the Calamari off the bill. 
I would've given one more star but we won't be going back here since the cooks don't a crap about how your food comes out they'd just rather close the kitchen. I might add we were there 3 hours before closing time...and a party of 8 DRUNK people stumbled through the door about 5 mins before we left. Also won't be going back because management doesn't care either since we asked to speak with a manager and were told by our server that there wasn't one on the shift. It's too bad bc other than my twice baked potato on the first time went, we thought we had found our new favorite place to go and bring all our friends and family.

329338,2014-02-19,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"So I've lived in Vegas for over a year now and I've passed by this place more than a few times and wondered how good the food/service was.  Tonight we found out...not worth your time! 

After being seated we had a very prompt waitress TO START.  She took our drink, appetizer and dinner order, then handed us off to another waitress because her shift was ending.  No problem at first, but then we didn't see our new waitress for about 15 minutes.  She finally came by to check on us, and asked if we were ready to order...already done that, and then she went and checked on our appetizer.  25 minutes later, it finally came out...2 crab cakes shouldn't take that long, but ok.  On top of all that, her attentiveness lacked when it came to drink refills, to the point that my fiance' had to get up and ask for more water...

Finally, about an hour after we were seated, our salads, which were limp and tasteless bagged salads.  Then dinner, we both ordered the fillet with grilled shrimp...what came out was NOT a fillet, looked more like thick NY strips, and 3 small shrimp...$34/plate.  Per the menu:    

""Your Steak is cut from the finest beef available in the United States.""   
Please tell us how you would like it prepared.

The food was prepared ok, but by this point we were not pleased with the the quality or the service.  It was about this point that I believe the waitress caught on, because she checked on us 3-4 times in a 10 minute period.  I went to speak to the manager, who was seated at the bar, a few drinks in.

I introduced myself, then began to talk to him about what was going on...explaining about the waitress hand-off, the lack of attention and then the over-attention, and then the food.  His response to me was, ""Well let me get you a gift certificate to make this better the next time you come in.""  I told him straight up that I'd never come back here, and that for what they served us, $34/plate was a bit extreme.  His response: ""Well, you're not going to get the kind of quality for that price anywhere else in Vegas, believe me.  That's really all I can do for you.""  Ok...I guess my last year in Vegas was all a dream, because there are plenty of places that are of much better quality for the same price.  I felt very dismissed, told him thanks for his time, and then went back to my table to get my check.

The waitress asked if we wanted everything wrapped up...about half of each of our meals left, and we said ""NO, just the check please.""  She figured it out at this point, and we told her we had spoken with the manager about everything.  She got us the check, which was now 1/2 off, magically, and a $50 gift certificate to come back.  I paid my bill, and we beat feet out of there.  

Decor aside, or lack thereof, this place is AWFUL!  If you're in Vegas full time, spend a few extra dollars and get a steak worth your money somewhere else.  Don't waste your time going here!",Ax-ihUIo-qgdJEwjuW5www,4,1,1,jQ_UMv38Us26JUKKOngu7w

My wife had a salad which she enjoyed and I had the lobster  bisque.  Both the salad and the  bisque were  very good.  For our entrees the wife had filet and crab legs and I ordered the porterhouse and lobster tail.   Well here is where the stars started dropping off.   We both ordered our meat medium.  ***Note on the menu there is a section that specifically points out levels of doneness for steak orders***   Again I state we ordered our steaks MEDIUM.  My wife's filet came well done and my porterhouse was rare.  Additionally my lobster tail was also over cooked.  Both of these plates were around $50.00, this is a steakhouse they should know how to cook a steak medium.  They got all the sides and accompaniments right but they messed up on the steaks and the lobster.  Both my wife and I did not finish our steaks.  When the waitress came back I had advised her that my wife's filet was cooked wrong and so was mine. She apologized and offered us a free dessert.  She also offered to take the meat back and have it  cooked properly.  Well we refused those things.  I never send food back!!!  I should get it right the first time and I really don't think that a free dessert will make up for an overcooked filet or an undercooked porterhouse, plus the over cooked lobster tail.  A $5.00 dessert does not make things right.  Here's the thing. The place is a steakhouse and they do steak  day after day after day.  If we ordered our meat medium it should come medium.  This was our first visit here and we had heard it was a very good steakhouse.  I had planned on brining my whole family of 6 next weekend,  but after tonight I think I'll take them somewhere else.

Maybe because it was a New York Strip because I have eaten 24oz prime ribs and rib eyes that seemed bigger. It was a good cooked steak though, medium the way I like it.

I kept expecting to see Gordon Ramsey burst out of the kitchen screaming ""Shut it down, shut it down! Are you trying to kill somebody?"" That woulda made the $50+ I spent worth it!

On a good note, the five layer chocolate cake helped hold down the meal and gave it a quick exit the next day!

It was famous for either a last good meal out of town, or a great place to stop after you and your mob buddies gave Vinnie a ride out to the desert to do some ""star gazing"". 

Nowadays the sprawl of Vegas has caught up to it, and the glamor of driving out to it seems a little less like a road adventure. The restaurant can be a little tricky to find since it is now almost surrounded by housing tracts. 

That all changes when you step inside though, the atmosphere is probably very similar to what it was back in the early days of Vegas, and that is a good thing. The place is famous for its Steaks, and I will have to say that it doesn't disappoint in that department . The last time I was there I ordered the 12oz New York with Ranch House Potatoes and they were both excellent. Everyone in my party that night gave the place a thumbs up.

It felt like the kind of restaurant that in a small, rural setting would be the 'fancy' place to go on special occasions.  Hard to find that in a big city so that was different and nostalgic if your from a small town.  Unfortunately, the food just takes so much away from the experience that we can't see ourselves returning.

For the money and location you can have a remarkably better steak house experience at the Aliante or Santa Fe Casinos which are surprisingly great . . . No comparison.
 
The soup was Lobster Bisque and I was convinced it was straight up Campbell's out of a can.  The dinner salad was clearly a bag of mixed salad like you would get at Smith's with the cheapest box of croutons you can find.  Tried a 16 oz Ribeye.  Thinnest steak I've had at a steak house in Vegas and I'm pretty sure it was Choice and not Prime cut.  Ordered Medium and it came out clearly Medium-Well.  Smoked chicken was very dry and appeared to have been sitting for quite a while.  The Ranch House potatoes were regular frozen hash browns mixed with cream of mushroom soup or something to that effect.

Decided against the appetiser as we didnt think we would finish the main course, but you get a salad and garlic bread included with your main meal as a starter. so no point ordering separately as it will just cost you more.

The rib eye was so juicy and perfectly cooked with the best darn taste I've had in a long time.  Our waitress Sally was the best, stoping by at just he right times to make sure we were good and to refill our glasses.  My husband and I each had the rib eye but different sides.

If you are not from the area and go for the first time it's best to have a GPS or start early because access is not intuitive ever though it is right against the freeway.  

We made reservations for 6:00 pm on Friday night which I would recommend because the place was essentially full by 6:30.  And even at 6:00 they had a relatively large early dinner crowd.  

We both had the ""special"" which was an 8 oz. fillet wrapped with bacon and topped with a portobello mushroom covered with Bearnaise sauce. The steaks were cooked just as we had ordered them and were absolutely delicious. I had their ranch potatoes as a side, which are a really quite good cheesy fried potato mixture.  My wife had the twice baked potato and said it was very good.  The sides were quite generous and there was no chance of going away hungry.  

The only black mark was that our server forgot to bring the shrimp cocktail appetizer until after the entrees arrived.  But he was quick to apologize and take them back and comp us our desserts to make up for it.  We weren't that set on the appetizer when we ordered it so for us it wasn't a really big deal.  For somebody else...maybe so. This isn't a cheap place to eat so they should tighten that up a bit.  

The decor is every bit the ranch house that the name indicates.  The parking lot doesn't look like it has seen a paving machine in 20 years and we didn't see any marked handicapped spaces.

Having heard great things about Bob Taylor's Steakhouse I made a reservation to eat there on Christmas Day.  What a disappointment.  We had a party of five people and were escorted to a booth, which I had requested if possible when I made the reservation.  The booth was small and we were most uncomfortable since we are fairly large people.  There was a much larger booth next door to ours with just one child sitting in it.  The rest of the child's family were sitting at tables which appeared to have been added, also not full.  I can't say what those circumstances were.  Perhaps they had guests earlier that had left.  It just seemed like far too much space for one child.   After we were seated it took an awful long time for the waitress to come and take our order for drinks.  She took our food order at the same time.  They didn't have any decent beer which my son likes to drink so other than water he had nothing special to drink.  It took what seemed like forever for our food to be served.  I ordered a tenderloin steak, medium cooked, costing about $28.00.  It was way over cooked, almost well done.  One of our party ordered lobster.  She said it was so dry she could not eat it.  Fortunately, my son and his wife said their food was satisfactory, which I was happy about since I was treating them as a Christmas gift.  The other person in our party said his food was OK.  We told the waitress how unhappy we were with the food and she asked did we want to send it back but since we didn't want to wait another hour or more we cut our losses and took the food home to use for sandwiches rather than waste it altogether.  Neither of us intend going back there ever again.  It is expensive and obviously the Chef does not know how to cook steak or lobster and the waiting time for our food to come to the table was totally unacceptable.",ESQyW4XlgKXGVj3ThhhKjQ,0,0,1,5A2IquuyvOis9t4EX_hKgg

When I came across Bob Taylor's Ranch House their lunch menu was just that! I called and the first thing I asked was if they would be having their lunch menu for Mother's Day. I was excited to find out YES they would! During my phone call I asked 3 times if this was going to be the menu and was emphatically told yes all 3 times! Upon arriving we sat down and opened our menus to find that the lunch menu was NOT there, it was their dinner menu. I asked for the manager and explained my conversations when making reservations. All the manager could say to me was that the girl I spoke to was ""NEW"". When I asked if we could order from the lunch menu I was told NO! I went back to the table horrified because I knew some wouldn't be able to order the EXPENSIVE menu they had provided and so I wanted to leave. Seeing it was a holiday and most places had their reservations in place we probably wouldn't be able to go anywhere! My husband went to talk to the manager and she again could only say the girl was ""NEW"", which is not my problem and only means they didn't train her well! When he came back from talking to her he said that she told him we could leave if we wanted to! How's that for customer service & hospitality! Their employee, someone they hire, trained and left to represent their restaurant made an extreme mistake for us and all they could do was say she's new and we could leave! They didn't even offer to accommodate us in ANY way, nothing! Not a free appetizer, discount on the meal, let us order from the original lunch menu, nothing! I was furious, I didn't want to stay or give them my money at this point but we had no choice! Our bill was over $300 and over $400 with tip, FOR LUNCH!!! My lunch consisted of 4 pieces of shrimp scampi, nothing else!

We settled on this place because my Sister had heard great things about it.... I figured you couldn't be in business for that long if you sucked....wish I had read the yelp reviews first before dropping almost $300 on second rate food.

Went in at 6 , and were asked if we had a reservation. No, we didn't, considering the (outward) size of the place didn't think we would need them. 
We were given the choice of eating in the lounge...I'm ok with that,in fact I believe you can usually get better service in lounges/bars.

Our server was efficient and friendly, if not a bit aloof.  That was pretty much as good as it was going to get.
Food was Sizzler quality,at best.  MY rare prime rib was med_well. Wife's food was cold,, mushroom on her special not even cooked. Our server did get her a new mushroom for her filet, which was also overcooked. . The appetizers (scampi and crab cakes) were amusing,in an amateur chef kind of way. 

The rest of the group's meals kept the same,low standards... burnt baked potato, etc.  To add insult to injury, I was charged for 2 extra pieces of bread....classy.

1096041,2013-06-24,5,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...

There are not many ""old"" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an ""Old Western Vegas"" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. 

FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? 

I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  

I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. 

A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. 

I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.

1103010,2016-06-18,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"This restaurant has a lot of potential. It has a huge outside area but it's outdated as well as the inside. I didn't see it at night so, it may look better outside. 

Honestly, if the restaurant was consistent then I would of given it 3.5/4 stars. We ordered four different cuts of meat for dinner. The entrees come with a salad or soup, garlic cheesy bread,  and a side. The ranch was great, and the salad was a normal house salad. The lobster bisque, and cheesy bread was surprisingly delightful. 

Then came the steak. The steak is the grand resistance to any meal. So, we waited for about 20 minutes to receive our steak after we ate our starters. Mind you, it was extremely busy, and it seemed like the staff didn't have enough space, to work with in the kitchen. 

Finally, our steaks come, and everything looks delicious. I ordered a porterhouse, which was gigantic and has good flavored but was not medium as I ordered it. I sent it back, and received my new steak after 20 minutes, and everyone was already finished with their meal. My new steak was borderline rare, which I didn't mind. However, the chefs consistency was lacking. Everyone else said their steak was alright. 

I would be willing to try the restaurant again, when it isn't so busy to see if their consistency is better.",n2HyyuQ18NnsB2slsxt37Q,5,0,3,DIJqB-qPBOM7VrzDbNjjAg

He was helpful and personable. He offered his favorites and customers favorites. I took his advice and had the porterhouse. My friend had the prime rib which was their special for $1 per ounce. Our salads were nothing special but tasty. The cheese bread was also yummy. The star of the show is their steaks and they didn't disappoint. My porterhouse was cooked to perfection. Great smoked flavor, nice char and perfect pink in the center. No need for steak sauce on this puppy. So good! My friends prime rib was excellent.  Hardly any fat and perfectly cooked. Again delicious. The baked potato was big and meaty. The side of veggies were also yummy. We shared the carrot cake which was a disappointment. It was a 5 layer cake that was rather hard and dry.

1232016,2014-09-21,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"If you're looking for Old-School Vegas, look no further than Bob Taylor's Ranch House. This restaurant is literally an old ranch house, situated smack-dab in the middle of a tile-and-stucco northside neighborhood. But once you pull onto the gravel driveway and see the wagon wheel in the yard, you know you're driving up for a taste of the past.

My husband and I went last night to celebrate our anniversary. We've been to Bob Taylor's a few times, and we've always been seated in the large main dining room. This time, we were placed in the back. Not a bad thing, but the dusty industrial-style venetian blinds left a little to be desired.

The spouse had the ribeye, and I had the dinner special: a filet topped with a portobello mushroom and B√©arnaise sauce. Both were smoky, moist, and cooked to perfection (his rare, mine medium rare). For sides, he had a salad with blue cheese dressing (basically ranch with cheese crumbles in it) and a twice-baked potato. I had the lobster bisque (yummy) and the cheesy ranch-house potatoes (even yummier!).

Prices are comparable to other steakhouses in town ($27 and $36), but some of those places make you pay extra for your sides, so these rates are pretty reasonable. Even more reasonable are the prices on wine; we had two bottles of pinot noir for the price of one bottle at most Strip restaurants ($27 a pop).

Service was a little slow, although our waitress was pleasant and accommodating. And I can't give a five-star rating to a place with dirty window coverings at eye level. But overall, we enjoyed our dinner and I'm sure we'll be back.

I miss the days of the Green Shack and the Hilltop House, but if the crowds this Saturday night are any indication, the Ranch House will remain to keep Old Vegas alive well into this century.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,0,4,nN-ltONJ3qKSP6zNDzmxbw

I've been here a couple times.  Definitely a good cut of beef and they know how to cook it.  When I say ""rare"", 7 out of 10 times, the cooks give me medium rare.

It's almost as bad as ordering my Thai food #10, and getting #5 because I'm Caucasian...not Real-Asian.

We came here tonight for a friend's birthday, and since being here last, everything has dramatically gone down hill. Here is the list of complaints we had about our evening:
-As soon as we walked in, the interior looked dingy and run down. The ceiling tiles were water damaged and warped and it was uncomfortably warm inside. 
-The lighting was too bright and my husband actually had some sort of spot light shining into his face during the entire dinner while we sat stuffed in a corner away from everything. 
-The waitress, Jennette, seemed put out and almost in a rush to take our orders. She was very snippy and appeared to be annoyed with our questions about the menu. 
-My husband's wine glass had dried wine in it. The water or its glass appeared cloudy and overall it was dirty.
-The food was way overpriced for its quality and portion size. The house salads that came with the entrees were basic and some of the lettuce was brown and wilted. My cajun halibut was extremely overcooked and dry. My husband's scallops didn't have any sear on them and they were gritty. They were also cooked and placed into a cream sauce that was heavy and lacking any depth of flavor. The ranch style potatoes were extremely salty and greasy. 
-When the bill came we asked if we could split the check, and we asked for a pen so we could write who had what. My husband said it would be split with each couple on their own bill and she either acted like she didn't hear us or just wasn't paying attention and walked away after he suggested it. She came back quickly, standing over us; once again making us feel rushed. She could have easily split the checks without us having to write out who had what. 

This place is known for being a steak house, and last time we were here got steaks, and others in our party tonight got steaks. The steaks are subpar to other places we've been. 
 
Overall, it was a terrible experience and a complete waste of money. I won't ever recommend anyone to go here and will make sure to suggest other places if this place is brought up.",6y3brTYD1GHdTeaC9Iht_w,0,0,1,wLd0_PQpWt2zX5oL_y3jOw

I ordered the Ranch House Wings to start out with and I could smell the vinegar tickling my nostrils as it was brought to the table. Funny thing is they tasted nothing like vinegar and I liked that. They were meaty and tasted good. My dinner came with a choice of either soup or salad. The soup was Lobster Bisque and that wasn't going to work for me. My wife suggested that I just try the salad so I did. I ate every bite of my salad it was so damn good. Every piece of lettuce, which was crisp and not a pile of leaves or weeds, had dressing on it. When my Porterhouse arrived I was a happy boy. It was cooked just how I ordered it. The steak was juicy and tender. My twice baked potato was hot and good.

Damn near 16 years in the Vegas before I paid Bob Taylor's Ranch House (BTRH) a visit.  We visited and I withheld a review.  Visited a second time, withheld...yet another review.  The mystique of something that perhaps might have been special..once upon a time, kept me from pulling the trigger.  Maybe the next time it will be different....maybe the next time it will be different...

My brother and his family were looking for a place to dine on a Saturday evening.  I threw out a couple of options.  BTRH being one of them because it is in many ways just so damn different from what one is  used to living in Vegas.  Different being in it's location and exterior and interior style but all this a great steak house does not make.....sadly.

Back to my brother, I threw out several options....he replied back, ""Ranch.""  He also made the reservations, that I highly recommend if this is but your first time visiting BTRH.

Based on several experiences...the steaks are so so.  I found it them to be overcooked consistently more medium than the medium rare previously ordered. The simple garlic cheese bread is good to go, salads are good to go, the ranch house potatoes are good to go.  The service...mixed.

Now that the mystique is almost certainly gone.  I don't hate.....but I don't love either.  We shall see what the future holds.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,13,4,3,CGosIW902FsktTBka0f_gQ

1672395,2017-08-23,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"I have lived in Las Vegas since 1976 and frequented BT many times over the years. My wife and I were having an anniversary in July and thought what a perfect place for a nice dinner. I made reservations in advance. We were seated on time but way in the back of the restaurant next to the exit door and directly under an air conditioning duct blowing extremely cold air on both of us, so much for advanced reservation and they knowing it was our anniversary. I said something to our waitress ( which I might add was extremely good and friendly ) and she suggested we move to the other two seats, which was a little better.  I asked for a large bottle of pelegrino for us to split but they only carry small bottles of perrier, so we had a couple of club sodas with lime. We ordered a couple of appetizers, one calamari and a shrimp cocktail, the calamari was left in deep fryer to long and was very crispy ( not good ), the shrimp cocktail consisted of 4 med. size shrimp on a lettuce plate, I was thinking about the 99 cent cocktails and how overly priced this shrimp cocktail was. we order our main meals and my wife wanted the chicken fettuccine and I ordered the filet and lobster tail, the chicken fettuccine came on a very large plate ( must of been a pound of fettuccine ) sort of what you might expect at the Claim Jumper, the sauce was very bland with not much flavor. The rib eye was over cooked ( not the med rare I ordered ) and the lobster tail was left on the open flame grill to long and was burnt and tough. I could of sent all the above back but knowing by reading other Yelp reviews my wife and I wouldn't have been eating together as the meals would of been delivered at different times.  The highlight of our anniversary dinner was the fudge chocolate cake, which I am sure wasn't made at Bob Taylors Ranch House and was very good. I wrote a letter to the owner of BT and received a phone call from manager April. I explained the experience and she said that she would get back to me. A week later I received a gift certificate from BT and it was for a whooping $25.00. I called April and asked if this was some kind of sick joke ( $25.00 ) and she said no, I told her I was insulted by the amount and having spent that night over $150.00 it wasn't quite adequate She said the owner Jeff told her how much to send. I told her to tell Jeff to keep it and buy a nice bottle of bourbon to drink as his restaurant fails. I mean really the $25.00 would of payed for two desserts , a couple of drinks and the tip. So sorry about Bob Taylors it was a fine dinner house for years but I will not be going back again. The thing about restaurants in Las Vegas is the mediocre ones don't last long as we have some of the best foods and chefs in the U.S. But i suppose Jeff will be able to live off the past reputations of the restaurant for a while before closing the doors.",r4KgBEkkwsKQRLGPU68XCw,0,0,1,WnaoNJ7U9J_-9xDLksz28A

Great atmosphere and service was nice and friendly.  Food was alright.  I've definitely had better.  I know that this place is known for their steaks but I was craving fish so I ordered halibut and my boyfriend order filet and shrimp.  I've had better halibut; dry and overcooked.  My boyfriend ordered his flit medium which shrimp was great but his steak as he cut into it was still raw and this is when he ordered medium so he couldn't eat it because it was that rare so he asked the waitress if he could take it back to have it cooked a little more which they did and he cut opened into it again it was still rare.  At that point he was over it and didn't want to eat it.  I like my steaks rare so therefor I wanted to take a bite of it and it had no taste what-so-ever.  It was Blah! My friend ordered a ribeye and I would think it would look somewhat better.  It looked like a piece of paper.  Her husband ordered a steak as well and his was overdone. To the end of the meal we ordered dessert and had the brownie fudge with ice cream. No taste and where was the brownie?! Another BLAH!

All and all, everything was pretty much fair.  Just the food isn't what I thought it would of been considering all the rant and raves about this place.  Most likely wouldn't come here again on my own unless there was another special occasion.",6TRuskwkjyGtQ7eKeH9Vtg,1,0,2,zpv1plIGg6GE_lOP9tqsJQ

We walk up to the entrance to see in the garden area a few cats in a nice garden. We feel like we are going to an old ranch house for dinner with our neighbors. We walk in and are greeted and seated right away. We feel like we are sitting in someone's living room close to the fire place. I looked around to see a lot of 'older' locals and some family's. I notice a lot of these people are laughing and having a great time. Our waiter was prompt and took our drink order right away. The drinks came fast and our order was placed. The food came pretty quick and boy was it good! The steak was cooked just like I wanted and mom had the prime rib. Oh yea and the garlic cheese toast was the best. (had to have a second order)

It is not normally busy in there, especially on the weekdays as they are kind of off the beaten path. There is normally only one waitress except on the weekends.

2026301,2010-11-16,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"This place was a recommendation from a casino bartender who said the food was great and priced right.  We love to get tips as to hidden gems when we travel, and based on the reviews, we thought it was going to be much better than it was.

We may have arrived on an off-night, because what we found did not meet what had been described.  

It's a bit of a distance from The Strip, which was not a problem.  It's great to be away from the hustle and bustle of the gambling crowd.

I had the smoked chicken, my partner a sirloin steak.  She asked about the twice baked potato and was told that they add bacon to the mix before it is baked.  Sorry, but bacon isn't for everyone, and she was glad that she asked.  My chicken was served with no sauce and with rice pilaf.  She had the homemade chicken noodle soup, I opted for the homemade thousand island dressing with my salad.

The smoked chicken was way too dry, having probably spent time in a warming oven before being served.  Advertised as 'smoked' there was zero smoke flavor.  The steak was not cooked to the way she ordered and had to be put back on the grill.  Well, what happens to a piece of meat that has been cut open after it has had a chance to rest to allow the juices to gather back into the center when it gets placed back on the grill?  Yep, say goodbye to the juice and hello to shoe leather.  She had to dab butter on the steak to moisten it.  We later joked about which one of us had used more butter on our entree in an attempt to add moisture.

Service was a five(!!!), with the server being very attentive and friendly.  Food was a two, with the best part of the meal being the garlic cheese bread, the soup and salad.

There were multiple birthday / anniversary celebrations going on in the place, so either they got the five star food with us getting the leftovers, (and a tired cook) or this place is more about having fun with a group while everyone secretly wishes the food was better than it is.",q6uNOuHAPaMjDHHRJCl-8Q,2,0,3,nRe1Vjw_jOW2FkuZnjSeIw

2119521,2017-06-24,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"First the negatives, then the pluses:  I can see why this place might not be for everyone.  There isn't much in the way of vegetarian options.  (I don't think we can expect them to apologize for this, it is a steak house after all.)  When you order an entr√©e, you get your main course and ONE side, as in potato OR vegetables, instead of your choice of potato and a vegetable.  The cheesy bread really does seem like someone put cheese on Texas Toast and placed it under the broiler.  The tables are so close together that you feel like if you move around too much in your seat you'll disturb the party seated at the table next to yours.  (The waiter couldn't even walk all the way around our table, and it was not a booth and not next to a wall.)  Due to the crowding, it's so loud you can barely hear the waiter's recommendations.

Now for the positives:  The food is well prepared.  We've only been once, and maybe we caught it on a good night.  Or maybe it's the style of food.  This is the type of food my grandfather would have appreciated.  Hearty and very lightly seasoned.  A scant touch of salt, garlic and paprika was all that needed to give a meal flavor.  You can taste the food, rather than a bunch of salt.  The salad dressing is homemade, and tasting the salad with house dressing took me back to my childhood.  The cheesy bread reminded me of what we would have called ""garlic bread.""  For me it was nostalgic.

The d√©cor and ambiance:  It's what it might be like eating dinner at the Clark County Museum or the Spring Valley Ranch State Park.  I loved it.  I've always wished that we could go down to the museum, walk into one of those preserved homes, and eat a dinner like we used to have in the 60s and 70s.  In fact, what a great outing it would be, to go visit the museum or the State Park, walk through those homes, and then top it off with a dinner at the Ranch House.  

The dessert:  It deserves a separate category of it's own because they don't make it in-house.  But it's worth it.  The portions are big enough to share.  We ordered the tiramisu, and the apple cobbler, and shared both 4 ways.  It was pretty amazing.

The service:  Very professional, efficient, and friendly.  Very nice.  We have a disabled family member, and they were extra kind to him, which always warms my heart.

The crowd:  Most of the license plates in the parking lot were local, which ought to tell you something.  Many of the staff seemed to know some of the patrons on a first-name basis, which seems to tell you something more.  If you are going to a steak house, are you going to go to a big chain, or are you going to visit a locally owned place, especially if it's been around  for decades?

We will most definitely be back, and while I realize that a place of business needs to change to keep up with changing tastes, I hope they never change this place too much.  It's like taking a step back in time.",-PfcLYFMW9ZXc1DEWSqw-g,3,1,5,eJT0fgPTeKqIWEjufjvCVg

Rolling up, we were totally transported back in time to when this restaurant was located in the middle of nowhere (except now the Ranch is surrounded by tract homes and lost some of their land to the 215).  According to a friend, this place was once so remote that the mob used to stop here for some steaks and drinks after doing, ehem, nefarious things to people in the desert.  Ah Vegas and your local lore!  

Enough about that, on to the food.  We were seated at a four-top in the corner, away from the large windows that face the front yard unfortunately.  The ambiance wasn't as fancy as I expected, kind of more road-house than steak-house - which is A-OK by me. I love places with personality!  I ordered the Fettuccine with Scallops in Chardonnay Cream Sauce as an entree, which was huge and very well done. Overall, I felt the dish could have used a dusting of grated parmesan for some extra ooomph. Two of my dining companions got the Broiled Shrimp - which they both said was super flavorful, taking on the smokey flavors from the open mesquite grill.  The wine list was super reasonable, allowing us to enjoy a full bottle of wine for the table at very little cost.

Take some time to peruse the artifacts that line the glass cases in the entrance and the bar - they have some pretty cool Las Vegas memorabilia.

Finally, during a trip we made out there last month, we went back to find it.

Unlike places on or near the strip, there's no flashy sign or gaudy light show that will direct you to this restaurant.  Apparently, back in the day, this place was the hideout haven for vacationing celebrities.  Due to it's out of the way, discreet location, I can definitely see why.

But aside from the potentially mild difficulty you will experience looking for it, I must say, it's well worth the adventure.  

While I agree that the salads aren't the highlight of the meal, the meal itself is quite generously proportioned.  I ordered the rib eye, which was deliciously made to order.  I know my dad ordered the filet mignon, which I tried and it melted in your mouth it was so good!  I can't remember what my mom ordered but I do remember that it was also quite tasty.

We were greeted upon walking in and asked if we had a reservation I stated we didn't, she rolled her eyes and grabbed some menus. We were seated in the middle of the dinning area in front of the fire place. Severs all around!!! No one said hi, offered us drinks or water, or even like hey so and so will be with you in a minute. We must have sat and watched the table near us get their check, table to the side of us get food. No one said anything after 20 minutes we walked out, TERRRIBLE TERRIBLE customer service. Willing to spend the money for a good meal, however customer service is a must. No one even blinked an eye when we walked out either. Couldn't believe it.

2534303,2014-05-04,1,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"I'm always careful to keep my reviews in context, so let me first point out that even though I'm giving this place a full 5 stars, that should not be construed to mean it is better than the other finest steak houses near the strip.

But...if you want to try a old (1955) rustic, homey (was literally a house at one point) place off the beaten path, with simply the finest selection of beef that is expertly prepared at about HALF the price of other places that feature similar beef...then you're going to love it.

We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms that were most excellent.  The blue cheese dressing on our salads was home made and was simply excellent.  The garlic cheese bread was delicious.  THEN our meat arrived!  I had the 12oz Filet and my wife had the 16oz Prime Rib.  Both cuts were perfectly cooked on their large open grill and had a flavor and texture rarely experienced (and we go to a lot of nice steak houses...minimum 3/mo).  We finished up with a very good piece of Key Lime pie.

I noted that a lot of other people were complaining about service...I guess we just got lucky.  Our waitress could not possibly have been more on top of things.

So in summary...this place is not winning any awards for ambiance, but if you want a super fine piece of beef at half the price it would otherwise take, I highly recommend it.  We live in Green Valley about 45 minutes away, so I probably would not make the trip unless I was already out there for some other reason...but with meat that good, I'll probably find that reason.",dwmciE9bB4Naug5SvM8KZA,12,1,5,5qINik9gwMA8lzDAWpI8iA

We shared an order of crab stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, and I could have had just that as a main entree, it was that good.

However, I kept winning at life that night, as every new flavor that I was presented with was just as delicious. I opted for the French Onion soup to start, and it was flavored perfectly. They are generous with the cheese in the soup and it was wonderful. Next up was the honey BBQ chicken, and I chose Ranch House potatoes as my side item. 

Every bite was delicious, down to the sauteed bellpepper and onion combination. Husband offered a few pieces of his prime rib to me, and I happily ate it up. The prime rib was like buttah!

We live all the way in Henderson and this place is so worth the drive. Tucked away in the middle of newly built homes, is the 1955 original building. It has charming twinkling lights strung from the building and along the courtyard, and has plush greenery in the front area courtyard. 

You'll park in their unpaved parking lot, however, that just adds to the feeling that the place has been frozen in time. A nice little western themed delight in the middle of 'new Vegas' stucco and SUVs. 

There are cats lounging in the plush grass out front, and I can only imagine why they are here-the leftovers! As I left the place with a smile and a full stomach, I was tempted to stick around like one of those cats. The food is worth it!",jWNooyYAuHWUpxnZGTRpeA,2,1,4,bhiIv8R2INc_IFT5L1FVMA

The service was awesome. I don't remember our server's name but I wish that all food servers were like this guy was. Friendly. But not so much that it seemed fake. Knowledgeable - but not arrogant. Attentive but not in a hovering sort of way. A few times I caught him looking around the corner to check up on the tables in his area. Couldn't ask for more.

The food was pretty good too. 

I do have to mention though - the shrimp cocktail consisted of four shrimps and a tin container of cocktail sauce. I've never seen a cocktail served like that. Usually it's in some type of glass filled with the sauce and shrimp. Other than that - it was good. 

I ordered the prime rib and lobster tail. I had my reservations when it was served because the lobster shell was charred so I thought maybe it may have been overcooked. After the first bite, I was proven wrong which didn't bother me one bit. It was explained that the prime rib was cooked in a smoker. I couldn't taste even a hint that it was smoked but nevertheless, it was flavorful to where I didn't even use much of the sauces or dips that the prime rib was served with. 

For dessert, my friend and I shared a Tiramisu. I really enjoyed it because it didn't have a strong coffee taste. That may not be to other people's liking as it may not be what they're expecting but it was a nice surprise to me as I don't drink coffee. 

As for the prices, it could be considered pricey however you'd pay a considerable amount more if you visited any of the other steak houses in the valley.",I2qJvA0tbGdZJ3XrwzwfzA,6,6,4,TBCHiB2kOCI0EWPiISehoQ

It's probably due to the Mesquite wood they use that gives it such an amazing flavor. I on the other hand, had the prime rib, which was extremely tender and juicy, but I only got the Mesquite flavor on the outside edges of the cut. So if you're looking to get a huge punch of that smokiness, try some of the other steaks. In the end I wasn't completely dazzled and love-struck by this offering, but I'll give this place 4 stars for the groans of satisfaction that came from my fiance as he polished his steak off. 

Some misses for me: the Texas toast was a little greasier than I'd like, but it was definitely very homey and comforting. And I could have done without ordering the calamari- the breading was a little bland and it just and an overall soggy feel. I like my calamari super crunchy. 

But this is definitely THE PLACE for your local carnivore looking to get his meat-eating bib on. You can't really go wrong with the generous portions of perfectly cooked meat- even your local cavemen would grunt in approval.",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,3,1,4,Kqn368Ggp0xy-x8t9ddYIg

The flavor was good however the temperature was incorrect. The same happened to my mother and husband. They both returned their steak due to it. 

The service was friendly however very slow to deliver the meals, refill water and give us bread. But the food once it came was great. All in all it's a great piece of meat in a down home atmosphere.

We were seated very quickly and the staff was friendly. Our waitress was very pleasant and prompt. She took our orders and returned shortly with some bread and the starters.

He said, ""it's pretty standard but the croutons were really good.""

Our steaks were really nice. My 8 oz filet mignon was very tender and they know what medium rare is. It was wrapped in bacon and served with b√©arnaise sauce but I've never had a portobello mushroom cap it off as a traditional way of serving. Bearnaise sauce was very creamy and more of the consistency mayonnaise. My boyfriend polished off his porterhouse.

We started off good, the service, the atmosphere, the soup, yummy and the salad fresh and good.

But then the main course comes and I am sorry Bob, but sour tasting pork chops and just as sour baby back ribs is just not right.  

I tried to determine the flavors, I got the rosemary and I think the meat was marinated too long in a red wine vinegar type marinate.  The nice waitress could only confirm the rosemary.  But Bob, both portions (which were really nice sized) were just to sour for my and my wifes taste buds.

From numerous birthday celebrations, to simple date nights, I'm a big fan of Bob Taylors. For me, and I'm sure others, it reminds us of old Las Vegas. A simple, nice cut of meat cooked right there on an open flame. Home made cheesy garlic bread. Twice stuffed potatoes that are usually huge. And not much else. Sure there's pasta and seafood. But this is a steakhouse and unless your coming on Tuesday for the AYCE ribs, get the steak!   They don't have a bunch of fancy new age additions to their menus. No list of steak toppers. No truffle or foie gras to add, just good, home cooked food. 
One thing I really love about this place, besides the fact that it feels like you're walking into someone's home, is the prices. Just the other night my other half and I dined here for $75 including a tip and wine! Rare to find that these days. And the service was great.

They took it back but then obviously rushed to try to get the correct dish out as fast as possible, and it was therefore undercooked.

3167870,2015-07-08,6,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"I don't think it can quite be categorized as a staple, but Bob Taylor's definitely has it's history in Las Vegas. Being born and raised here, I've been coming to the Ranch House for as far back as I remember. When I was younger, this was one my mom and stepdads favorite places to go for a steak. I remember when there used to be long waits and lines out the door. But I can't remember when exactly I was here last, I just know it's been a good 15+ years.

A few of our friends recently invited us here for dinner when they were craving some ""good ole' American meat"". When the 5 of us walked in on a Saturday night, there was absolutely no wait. There was a few tables sat inside, and while the decor has remained mostly unchanged from what I remember, the place just doesn't seem to have that Ranch House feel anymore. It's definitely starting to show it's age, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it almost feels more like a chain restaurant now than a mini-getaway from the city like it used too.

After browsing the menu for a bit, I decided on a special that there were advertising, a bacon-wrapped 8oz filet, I believe priced at about $35. Much like the regular menu items, it came with a soup or salad, and a potato choice. I chose the lobster bisque, which wasn't great, but according to other reviewers, was likely a lot better than their side salad. It just didn't really have much flavor, and there was no lobster in it. The best part about it was dipping their garlic cheese toast in it, which on it's own wasn't anything special either. 

Now, I'm the type of person who doesn't believe in eating a steak at anything past medium rare...and with no shame, I'll give you a hard time about doing so. But I think when I ordered my filet medium rare, and just about everyone else at the table ordered there's well done, it threw the kitchen off a little bit. All 4 of our steaks were just off a bit. Mine was cooked much closer to medium, and the well done orders were more like medium rare. Not that I feel too bad for them, since they won't be able to taste anything way, it's always disappointing when your steak isn't done right. Especially mine being over medium rare. 

Even though I still think the Ranch House uses fairly good quality meat, especially at the price, their execution just isn't there. Alongside the temperature issues, our steaks came with a b√©arnaise sauce that pretty much ruined the whole thing. It was easily the thickest b√©arnaise sauce I've ever seen, and had a texture that was more like a dry paste squeezed out of a pastry bag. There was no smoothness to it, it wasn't creamy, and it really didn't taste all that good. Scraping as much of it off as I could helped a bit, but this would have been an entirely different experience if that sauce wasn't there to begin with. 

There service doesn't have much behind it either. We felt really rushed with our orders, and it took a while to get drink refills too. Our waitress was okay, but she wasn't very friendly, and didn't seem all that interested in waiting tables anymore that night. 

Maybe nostalgia kicks in a little on this 3 star review, just because I like the place and have been here so many times before as a kid. And as I mentioned, I still don't think their prices are too crazy high for the quality of meat. But the service and kitchen execution resemble more of an Outback or other chain. I might go back eventually, but if it's anything like this last visit, and they've completely lost that homey, local feel with decent steaks to go along with it, the Ranch House would be all but a memory.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,13,6,3,Yxj0lXz7xszt6yPsgSEGzw

All joking aside, Bob Taylor's Ranch House has been in business since 1955 so they must be doing something right. Right? Beano Fatardo investigates.

First of all, you will get cancer the second you walk into Bob Taylor's. Even with just a few customers, the place reeked of everyone's favorite combination : stale cigarettes and fresh cigarettes.

Not only was my hamburger a once frozen patty, the steak fries had less flavor than water. I would have loved to try the coleslaw instead of the fries, but it wasn't prepared yet! Why do I have a feeling the cook is on a morning-long smoke break..... inside the restaurant!?

The only reason I am not giving Bob Taylor's a single star is because the bacon on my burger was nice and thick. That has to account for something, right?

3394582,2018-02-07,1,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"According to our server, we just dined at the oldest steakhouse in Las Vegas. It is in the middle of nowhere, and you drive through a neighborhood of houses before you see the famous wooden lined entry way, just like a ranch house. The walk to the door is lined with white lights and beautiful green vines with a little flower garden. Inside, it is lined with wooden panels and filled with tables with white table clothes. There are some photos on the wall, some depicting old movie posters of old westerns. There is nothing glamorous about the inside, but its simplicity still makes you feel like you are in a nice place and the appropriate place to celebrate a milestone. 

The side salad, the twice baked potato, and the cheese toast were alright, nothing to go out of your way for and nothing that will leave its mark on your taste buds. The steak however, lived up to everything it promised and more. It was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth -juicy and didn't need anything else to go with it. Come for the steak and the unique atmosphere, that won't let you down.

Our service was good, not quite on par with what I would expect from a finer dining situation, but nothing so lacking I would complain about it. Our server kept our dinner at a leisurely pace, taking some time before taking our order, or clearing the dishes to bring on desert.

The prices are lower than many similar steakhouses, but the quality is matched if not exceeding.",uso43PtZRUPcYxgxs12U1g,4,4,5,h3sThjxIqeUFzAGP2bsNLw

I was warned that this was out in the midle of residential homes and the tip was right.  The place has an old school vegas feel to it.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted by a lady that we presumed to be the owner...Super nice.  The decor is very old and there are photos of old vegas all around the place.  It was empty at first but the restaurant filled up pretty quickly.  

The service started off awesome but as the restaurant began to fill up it slacked up a little.  For appetizers we had fried calamari which was the bomb and stuffed mushrooms.  The stuffed mushrooms were some of the best stuffed mushrooms I've had in awhile.  

The house salad was not all that great to be honest.  I only had a few bites of it.  I should have gotten the potato soup but since I knew I was getting the twice cooked baked potato I didnt want to overdue it on potato.  

I had heard that they had a 32 ounce porterhouse steak and I was dying to try it.  I also heard that if you finished it you get desert for free.  So I ordered the 32 ounce steak medium rare.  It came a little burned and rare in the middle which I could live with. Rare..medium rare....blah blah its all the same to me.  I loved the steak!  I finished it and got the deset for fee.  

The carrot cake was some of the best I've ever had before.  Delicious.

I ordered the petite filet which was $27.99 (8 oz). I had them put some bleu cheese on top and it was so good. It came with cheesy bread and a twice baked potato. That potato is reason enough to go back!

The meat is mesquite grilled. As you walk in and get seated by the hostess you walk right by the grill. The service was excellent.

I saw on the menu they also offer take out service so if you want to just phone your order in and pick it up you can do that too. I think I will try that out with a salad and soup for lunch someday. 

They also host weddings and office, birthday, anniversary parties.

Mushrooms were good, especially when dipping the cheese bread in the cream sauce. I ordered my prime rib med. rare, but was disappointed when it was well done (I unfortunately let that mistake slide.)  the hash brown casserole was too rich and sloppy and had a grainy texture due to the unmelted cheese. I was ready to pay until I saw the check... I was confused because I was charged for the included side of salad and the grainy hash browns. When questioned, the server said the prime rib was a la carte, which had NEVER been mentioned when I ordered. She never apologized and instead asked me if I wanted to pay full price!! (I only saved $3 with the special) Why would I want to pay full price if the dinner wasn't even worth half?!?! I have never been so mad by an establishment, especially when the prices are comparable to a high end restaurant on the strip.

3602203,2011-03-26,0,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"Pulling up at the Ranch House at night for the first time can be a bit intimidating. It's all the way in the back of some neighborhood, so it was definitely an unexpected spot (especially with those flashy signs leading the way). Once my boyfriend and I pulled up, we knew this establishment has been here for a veeerry long time. This is a real Ranch, I wouldn't be surprised if they raised their own cattle to serve here. The restaurant is on the left side of the lot and it looks like a few more homes/buildings on the right side. I apologize if this description is inaccurate, this is more of a nighttime view of the Ranch House. I have no idea what it looks like during the day, but I'm sure the name of the restaurant describes it well...it looks like a Ranch...and it looks like a House. Ta da! 

Now the interior of the restaurant looks like the place should be named Bar Lounge Steakhouse. There were giant flat screens scattered throughout the place, but they were only playing in the bar/lounge area and not in the restaurant (saving energy?). That was a bit disappointing to my boyfriend, but I don't care to stare at a moving screen while I am eating (even less if I'm really enjoying my food. screw the TV!). 

We were seated by a friendly, sweet waitress who was very informative and helpful throughout the entire meal. We ordered calamari, the rack of lamb for me with Ranch House potatoes, and the prime rib and lobster for the mister with a twice baked potato.  Both of our entrees came with salads and garlic cheese bread. I will now try to switch my review into a more organized and easily read manner:

calamari: good. standard calamari, crispy but oily. appropriate serving size.
salad: I got the house dressing and it was delicious. I cleaned my entire plate, and I don't even like eating my veggies. Bf got ranch dressing on his salad, and he didn't finish it...so I'd say it must have been ok. 
prime rib and lobster: the lobster tail was HUGE!! It just looked so plump and juicy, I did not taste since I'm allergic to shellfish, but my bf seemed happy with it. He reported that the prime rib was good, but he also expressed his regret in not ordering a steak.
rack of lamb: WOW. If you like lamb, you HAVE TO GET THIS. This is the best lamb I have ever had. The herb and dijon blend was PERFECT. I cannot describe this at all, each bite is an explosion and that is an understatement. Usually your first bite is always the best, and then the flavor experience starts winding down. Not with this baby; it's the first bite every single time! 9 perfectly seasoned and fire-grilled chops with meat so tender, I purposely tried using just my lips to pull it off the bone (heeeeY) and it just tore off with no resistance (I got this cooked to medium, btw). Juicy, flavorful, tender...YOU MUST TRY THIS. 
potatoes: sounds like most people are a fan of the twice-baked potato. Bf polished it off his plate, so he must agree. I wish I ordered that, because I did not like my Ranch House potatoes. Basically it's wet hash browns with mushrooms, cheese, and onions in it. Not for me.
Garlic toast: I didn't like it. Too chewy and thin for me (I like the thick, texas toast types) and neither cheesy nor garlic-y enough. My boyfriend liked it though. 

*whew* okay, now that I'm done re-living how awesome my meal was...here's the overall conclusion: definitely try it. You must get lamb if you like it. Everything else is not bad, I think it's a preference thing because there were things I liked that my boyfriend did not and vice versa. Give it a try, the service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing. I'm definitely going back for the lamb.",LYRFBeNtOjvze_h4gjTIUA,0,0,4,L9SIuOzwxcuCamM1X2I71w

The pork chops were some of the best I have had on a plate, and the price for everything was very reasonable. The others who were with me ordered a Filet Mignon, the crab cakes and shrimp cocktail appetizer, and various other choice steaks.

It is in the same spot, but since the valley has grown, it takes longer to get there, which makes it difficult for family get togethers, now. When there was only 150,000 people in the valley, it was much easier to get around. Now, with nearly 2 million, you want to cocoon in your neighborhood. 
The dress is sorta casual. Well, it's casual, but I'm sorta old school so I like to dress with at least a bottom down. Steaks are always fabulous. I must admit, they have other offerings and I hear they are wonderful, but I like eating steak at steakhouses. 
Anyway, steaks are fabulous. The smell is wonderful. The setting is rustic. Lots of old Western movie posters. The sides are great and plentiful. Great salads. Great staff. Service is beyond reproach. I wish I lived closer.

Two of us had the chicken wrap which in this case is fried chicken in a tortilla with lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing.  It was very good!  The only change I'd make would be to use regular grilled chicken, not fried, but the fried did give the wrap a nice crunch.  It was served with steak fries.  The third person in our group had the tuna melt, also served with fries.  She was very pleased with her sandwich.

For dessert, we splurged.  We had passed on an appetizer to go for the good stuff at the end.  We opted for a slice of carrot cake (it's huge!) with a scoop of ice cream.  The cake was excellent and it was the perfect sweet tooth ending to our lunch.

Service was terrific--perhaps because we were the only people in the restaurant.  I have a feeling that our server would have been almost as attentive if there had been 5 tables occupied.  The lunch prices are very reasonable.

After all the years of seeing the signs for this place or seeing ads, I'm glad we gave it a try.  I have a feeling that when we hike Mount Charleston and add lunch to our rigors, we'll stop here again!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,6,4,AhXVoOevK2kRtsG9Smrw6A

We had the lobster and filet mignon, the scallops were okay just too small and too much greasy butter, should have had a steak-duh I'm at a steakhouse not a seafood restaurant.

The inside of business has plenty of wooden features and older 70's style decor. 

Dress code was causal.

The service was a standard, nothing terrible, just not lightning fast.

After watching ""The Strain"" I was unable to order any steak, but I did get the fettucine with scallops.  It was a portion meant for a family of four for $21!  I was very happy I had asked my husband to split it with me.  It was pretty good and came with garlic bread and a very basic iceburg lettuce salad with my dressing choice.  I also shared calamari with my husband that came with both marinara and an aioli.  I was pretty disappointed with the calamari- it was mostly breading crispys that were not cooked as crisp as I like or had too much flour in the breading.  I would not order that item here!  I decided to also get the chocolate cake.  It took forever to get to my table because my waitress I think had too many tables, but I totally excused it because she was super sweet, obviously was working hard, and I liked her.  It was the best chocolate cake of my LIFE.  I couldn't stop eating it!  Luckily two others took some bites of it for me but still I ate way too much of that cake.  I would probably go back just for that cake but I kind of hope not because I would gain a lot of weight.  If you go here get the cake!!!!!!!!!!  Also, I want to mention before I went here I read some reviews and someone complained about the ribeye they ordered being fatty.  Um hello?  Then why would you get ribeye?  Ribeye is the fattiest cut of meat and my favorite because it adds all that flavor.  If you don't want fat get a filet!

But were seated immediately, huge plus in my book.for as busy as they were, our waitress was on it. Took the drink order, Wifey says her Bloody Mary was great. Rest of us had iced tea. Did 3 appetizers, the Ranch Wings, the Mushrooms and Crab Cakes. All were good, nothing awesome, but good. For main course, I did the Porterhouse, Wifey did Lobster with Filet, Son #2 had the Porterhouse, Son #3 had the Sirloin and our friend had the Filet. 
My Porterhouse was perfect, I mowed through it. I also had the baked potato and the Lobster Bisque soup, damn good. Wifey says her Lobster was crazy good, but she took her Filet home for later. 
Son #2 reported his Porterhouse was dry and half was over cooked. Son #3 disappeared his Sirloin and reported it was great, he also loved the Crab Cake appetizer. Over all, a great dinner with exception of Son #2 getting a over cooked Porterhouse.

Bob Taylor's screams ""old school"" -- far away from the fancy schmancy nouveau steakhouses on the LV strip for sure.  This place has stood the test of time -- that should say a lot in Vegas.  

If you want a no-nonsense perfectly cooked steak over wood fire with a side of garlic mashed potatoes with a martini straight up or a nice cab, you've found your spot.   No nonsense, no b.s.   I always choose a sirloin cut, and the folks at Bob Taylor's delivered.   It was the perfect size, seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly to a medium -- every bite was perfect.   Very reasonably priced -- far cheaper than what you'd pay on the strip.

She was slow and didn't take very good care of my wife and I and it didn't really seem like she had very many tables to account for it. The food we were served didn't have much flavor and was not worth the money we had to pay for it.. I couldn't even eat a good 40% of my baked potato because it was so burnt. And if you like a little bit of salad with a bowl of ranch you won't be disappointed. My NY strip was cooked correctly but still wasn't very good... it lacked flavor and I couldn't even eat close to 4oz of my 12 oz steak due to the quality of the meat itself. My wife ordered the chicken cordon bleu and ended up not eating a quarter of it. It seemed as though they forgot it was in the fryer for a good 3 minutes past done and decided to serve it anyway. To put it simply the food lacked flavor and definitely quality and at the prices they should definitely have better quality waitstaff and food. I will not visit this establishment again unless they start selling the steak for about $6 a plate...

Ordered one of the specials which was the filet with a portabello mushroom and Bearnaise sauce with a twice baked potato standard salad. The restaurant provides a very tasty cheesy toast.
The fillet special price between 30 and $40 was a good size for a filet, about a fork and a half tall.  I think I would order the steak again, but without the bearnaise sauce, and I would have preferred a porchini or shiitake change of taste instead of the steak textured Portobello.
As the evening progressed this restaurant was progressively crowded with plenty of locals. The waitress was very attentive my glass never went dry. Drinks from the bar we were very timely.
This place cracks me up. It is a converted ranch house just as advertised. You can see with the fireplace in the family room and the dining room and where the kitchen used to be, because it was a ranch house residence.  Very pleasant exterior with a homey kind of feel; exposed beams and dark wood abounds.

Birthday dinner 2015 - I selected Bob Taylor's Ranch House (and Supper Club). Don't you just want to go to somewhere that is a Supper Club? Yes, you do. You want to be a part of the Supper Club.

Bob's is old school Vegas. Unpretentious. Just straight up food. Steaks. Potatoes. Drinks. Done. The vibe is down on the ranch, the cattle ranch, that is. Right here in Vegas, who knew!

When you enter there is a bar to the left, and then as you go to the dining area on the right, you see the mesquite grill -- with glorious meats being grilled right before your eyes!

My party got a nice little table in the back -- so we could not watch the grilling in action, but that is okay. 

We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms and calamari. The mushrooms were heavenly, enveloped in a decadent white sauce. Calamari was excellent, not oily at all, and came with two dipping sauces. Next came my SMOKED prime rib, done medium-rare and amazingly good. PLUS I got the Ranch House Potatoes -- get these potatoes! They were so good. A blend of hashbrowns, mushrooms, and four different cheeses. 

I was also brought a very simple vanilla sundae, with chocolate sauce and whipped cream with a candle in it for my birthday. 

Bob Taylor's made my birthday one to remember. I would highly recommend Bob's for any special group outing, or if you just want a really good steak minus the typical steak house fanfare.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,2,4,TTO0cfsUrzWJw7OEqwmKXA

The drinks were watered down, the steaks not cooked as we ordered, and the steaks were a bit chewy, they aren't the best cuts of meat. That said, why are we fans? Because it's the kind of the place that you know your parents would have gone to, the service is pleasant and quick, the rest of the food is good, and it feels like a time gone by, slow and unpretentious and relaxed. 

We liked the Texas toast, and they offered to give us more, but one is enough. I had the ranch potatoes, and they tasted like mac and cheese, they were so delicious. The salads are forgettable, you may want to pass. The chicken liver appetizer was super, really tasty and well cooked. I had the smoked prime rib; skip it. Go for a steak instead. Husband had a steak and was much happier with his dinner, although there was a lot of gristle. We skipped dessert. The service was spot on through the entire dinner. It's a bit chilly in the winter, I sat next to the fire and was still cold. 

Is it the best food ever? No. But we paid less than 100 bucks for dinner for two, with an appetizer and drinks, and that's a pretty good deal for what you get. This is the place you take your parents, a big group of friends, or when you have been married so long the romance is dead and you just want to eat, not share a moment with your meal.

When you drive up you don't feel like you're in Vegas. You park in an unpaved lot and you get out and you smell immediately a wonderful smoky smell.

You walk in and it's like a house transformed into a restaurant but a house from like the 1960s. It is such a fun environment.
To start off I had the broccoli soup which was wonderful. Then I had the filet mignon with the potato hash. It was fantastic we had the chocolate cake for dessert.

4672733,2016-06-11,3,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"This was our second time here.  In all honesty, the first was very good and we had a great time.  Last night, not so much.  We were seated in the very back and the swamp cooler or AC was working overtime.  In short order we were chilled.  The salad arrived and it was very good.  We always love a nice tossed salad.  The waitress wasn't too social, but that's okay.  We were there for a romantic date night and didn't really need to be entertained.  That's when it got ugly.  Our dinner arrived and it looked okay.  However, I needed a chain saw to cut my prime rib.  When I got my first bite, it was barely lukewarm.  

By the time I got to my second bite, the cold blowing wind had chilled it to the point where it was actually cold.  I told the waitress about this and she asked if I wanted her take it to the cook to have it ""dipped in the au jus a couple of times"".  I declined and it made me wonder if there is a community pot of au jus that everyone's cold prime rib gets dipped in, after they have taken a few bites.  Sure hope the last guy didn't have some disease.

After dinner, we both took our meat in a go box.  I plan on trying to slice it and saute it for breakfast.  I then asked if I could chat with a manager.  I was informed there was no manager, only the owner.  I said that would be fine, if he had a minute. 

A few minutes later he stopped by our table and I basically told him what I have written down here.  His response was not very kind, nor did he have much in the way of social skills.  He pretty much told us that we should have picked a different table, like it was our fault that the wind was blowing.  The people at the table next to ours were listening and they made some comments between themselves about that.  Then he just walked away.  No apology, no attempt to try and make things right, nothing.

Then, on the way out he was standing right by the door saying goodnight to people.  I don't think he even remembered talking to us.  He said, ""Thanks for coming.  See you again"".  I said to him, ""we won't be back"".  He said, ""Please come again"", like he didn't even hear what I said.  Either he didn't, or he is just a jerk.

Anyway, I always try to be as fair as I can with my reviews.  Las Vegas is a big place with many wonderful places to go out for dinner.  We have our favorites and frequent them often.  This one just got dropped off the list and we will no longer recommend it to our friends.  In fact, we will try and steer as many people away as possible.  Too bad, because it could be awesome.  Customer service is just as important as good food to us when we go out.

I just moved to the area and have been seeing the signs pointing the way to the Ranch and finally decided to give it a whirl. One note. Yelp shows that they are only open for dinner but they are open for lunch. You can order from the lunch menu or dinner menu. I opted for the 8 oz filet mignon off the dinner menu with the double baked potato. Excellent steak with a great mesquite flavor.  The lunch menu does have some great sandwich choices that I'll definitely be going back to try. They run a prime rib by the ounce deal on Monday that looked like a bargain but we were there a bit early for that. Our waitress (Liz S) was wonderful.

My father-in-law's filet was just embarrassing. It wasn't round but split into 3 pieces and was burned. He let the server know he was not happy with it and she stated that was just the cut of the meat. He insisted on getting another steak because that was not a $30 filet. It took 20 minutes for the next steak to come out. He cut into the new one and it was rare and cool in the middle when he had ordered it medium. That one was also sent back and it took another 15 minutes to get the third steak. Needless to say, we were all done and he was the last one eating. The server offered to take the dessert off of the bill but it seemed like not enough to get a $10 dessert for free.

We debated going all the way down to Miller's Ale House (nice baby backs for $18), or possibly trying that place Rolling Smoke; but decided to check Bob Taylor's menu for baby backs. And there they were, baby back ribs and only 5 minutes away. 

You should know this is a place with 60 years of history, but probably not a lot of remodels in that time. Doesn't seem to matter as the place was quite busy. As a matter of fact, try to call for a reservation once you decide to go. We got in w/o a wait, but it was close and if we had arrived 30 minutes later it would have been a different story.

Definitely try their cheese crusted bread; top notch. Had $4.75 glasses of house Merlot and $23.99 baby back ribs. The service was mediocre. Server missed a few requests and didn't come by very often, but she was nice and we wondered if she just had too many tables. Wife and daughter also got baby backs. We all agreed; nice the baby backs.......they just about fell of the bone.

Ranch House did the trick. The cheeseball kid inside of me loved the fact this place has cats running around outside the little ranch house type location . Yes! I am the crazy cat lady who tries to get the wild cats to come let me cuddle them.. It didn't work but still brought a smile as we were walking up! 

We had a reservation on a Thursday night and when we arrived there wasn't a host/hostess at the front so we kind of just stood there but it seemed like they had a decent crowd for the weeknight and once she finally arrived we were seated quickly at a small table.

It's definitely outdated decor but it has a welcome vibe and I don't feel like I need to dress to impress. I would feel comfy in jeans and a T-Shirt!!!

Our server was named Cali(spelling) she was very friendly and happy to give recommendations on what is the best options as far as size of steak and type to order. The only red meat I really enjoy has to basically be mooing so I went with a medium prime rib usually I got medium rare but she talked me out of it .. Next time it will be medium but the flavor was delicious . I wasn't a fan of the French onion soup or the salad but the stuffed mushrooms tasted good. My date enjoyed their meal but I didn't take a bite so I can't speak on that .

We were so stuffed we couldn't even get dessert but the steak and prime rib is cooked right there where you can see and honestly it's QUALITY!!!! It isn't cheap but where can you get cheap steak around here that tastes good anymore? You get what you pay for and this place is worth it in my opinion .

Ranch House was a close drive from our place- convenience is a plus so we can drive them up and take them back down to the airport. Thought it would be cool to experience a lil old Vegas too. I think it was the right place just because its quiet and everyone can talk specially my family and my BFs family were meeting for the first time. 

Ordered sauteed livers and some wings to munch on. Livers were yummy- not overcooked and the wings were alright, a little salty for me. 

Salad is pretty standard side salad you'd get someplace like Carrows or iHop of the iceburg variety with some shred carrot and bit of red cabbage. I didnt eat too much of it and not really memorable.

Split a porterhouse with my BF. Most people got bone in ribeye or ribeye. I of course took a bite out of everyones. Our porterhouse was nice- good cut of meat and cooked med.rare, the bone in ribeyes were juicy, the small thin ribeye was alright. The ranch pototatoes were good, but I was focused on eating the meat and we had plenty of leftovers for happy animals and sandwiches the next day.

Service was friendly, a little slow considering were the only ones there, but not bad. 

Overall it was a pretty good place to take family for a quiet meal, though maybe not my mom. She's an ambiance person and illusioned away by the grand spots of the strip and wanted a ""fancy"" place to take my BF's mom to impress her....Meh, yeah- thats back on the strip which we didnt have time for. Good for people who like nostalgia, kitch and steak....I see myself bringing grandpa here to tell me about all the posters on the wall. I think though for offstrip steak I much prefer Austins steakhouse though, but this place isn't bad.

 I will come back and try their lunch items though- some of the sandwiches sound good and are priced just right at $7-8....I  thought I saw a all you can eat rib night and prime rib night so I'll definitely consider coming for that.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,2,4,Q9kYFuFok1SCkc-vMv1gVg

Keep in mind that at this time in 1993 this restaurant was way out of Vegas on the outskirts of town and we came, ate and really enjoyed our time.  

I've been coming routinely ever since and now it's not on the outskirts of town.  It's in the heart of Aliante/N Las Vegas.  This place has stayed the same though.  Old school vibe, with amazing service and food.  The ambiance here is great too.  

I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and seen many people who are either native to Vegas, new here or just visiting and have never heard a bad thing about this place.  

With so much competition in Vegas and so many fine dining restaurants coming and going it's easy to see why Bob Taylor's has stood the test of time.

Serving Las Vegans since 1955 and apparently a dirt road destination for locals before The Valley extended in all directions towards the burbs, Bob Taylor's Ranch House was chosen for an eveningtime meeting for friends discussing the current boom in local dining, the juxtaposition ironic in how unintentional it actually was when taking into account a setting that has not changed in decades.

Located on the verge of Las Vegas and its neighboring city to the North and the sort of place where feral cats are free to roam on premises decorated with grass and a loose-gravel lot, it was just after 7 o'clock that our group of five was seated on the cusp of a dining room that reminisces of days long before most of us were born, the open kitchen to the left with a team of chefs searing a number of steaks, chickens, and chops.

Predating the era of artisan purveyors, outlandish sourcing from overseas, and even meats served singularly with sides to be ordered a la carte, it was with conversation and cheap cocktails from the bar that the evening commenced, and soon to be served a basket of Wonderbread topped in cheese and garlic the presentation was actually better than one may have expected, a second basket later delivered free of charge and arguably one of the three best items to arrive on the table that night.

No doubt a place more celebrated for its heritage than the items that appear on the plate, it was after an included low bowl of bisque flavored something like lobster that entrees arrived, each offered with a choice of a starch, both the creamy twice baked potatoes and bacon imbued Ranch House iteration competent with the former actually on-par with pricy versions on the Strip while the latter compared favorably to a good breakfast hash.

Moving onward to the meats, suffice it to say that the two bites of New York Strip tasted were sinewy enough that fork was subsequently kept to myself and as much as the half smoked chicken may have seemed like a good option for those seeking something lighter, the actual execution was so dry that even dark meat saw one of my tablemates nearly choke when attempting to swallow without water, a veritable disaster of a dish with 2/3 left to waste.

Told by a friend that Smoked Prime Rib was really the only thing to order at Bob Taylor's it was in a 16oz cut that $34.95 was sank and although certainly not much to look at both the flavor and texture were complex and ind indulgent, each bite seeing the tender flesh thoroughly permeated with perfume from mesquite that helped offset the heft of melting fat.

A lot of food for the dollar, though not exactly a bargain unless one puts a monetary value on experiencing a ""classic"" in its almost original form, it was in a duo of desserts that remaining appetites were invested, the brownie and ice cream combination really no different than any diner classic while the huge wedge of carrot cake was enough to share around the table, the moist base chock-full of nuts and raisins with cream cheese frosting that came across tangy and only modestly sweet.

**  Perhaps a poor choice for dinner the week after doing CUT and Carnevino on back-to-back nights it still warrants mention that the quality of Bob Taylor's Ranch House is really no better than any number of low-to-mid-range chains, the price too high to justify anything other than the smoked prime rib and perhaps a dessert no matter how historic the space.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,17,8,2,UHzj9du_GZACjGCfjUF2Gg

I am happy to report the service was amazing this time. Our waitress, Jill was very attentive and was great with the kids. 

The food: 
fried calamari: fried crispy and served with a really tasty remoulade sauce- yummy! 

salad- standard steakhouse fare 

cheese toast- it was too salty for the kids, but I liked it. It could have been seasoned a little less though. 

ranch house potatoes- my fave of the evening. They reminded me of Cracker Barrel's hash brown casserole with whole mushrooms added. They were delicious! 

12 oz. Rib eye- okay here's the reason I gave it only 3 stars. I ordered my steak rare and it came out like it literally hovered over the grill for maybe 30 seconds. Aside from the doneness, or lack thereof, it was a horrible cut of meat. I would never have recognized it as a rib eye! It was so tough to cut through I got a hand cramp! If it's tough when it's that rare...there is a definite problem. The worst part is that my husband ordered the same thing but medium rare and his was perfect. It tasted good and actually looked like a rib eye- which of course only added to my anger..lol. 

The kids' meals were very reasonably priced and devoured the moment they hit our table. They both got the fried shrimp with french fries. 

Overall the meal wasn't too bad. Everyone besides me enjoyed their food. It just pisses me off to pay $36 for the poor excuse for a steak they gave me. I would have complained but we were there with some friends celebrating their birthdays and I didn't want to be a downer.

My mom had eaten here prob 20 years ago and so we weren't sure how good it still would be. We had a choice between Ruth Chris and here and based on yelp reviews went with bobs. Let me tell you, the filet was amazing! It topped every steak house I've been to so far, better than Flemings or Morton's (which both have filets at double the price). Actually this is the first time I got a steak made right on the first try( med well). Also we ordered a ribeye (which normally I don't care for) but even this one was flavored so good and was so tender, I would consider ordering it myself. 

Desiree was our waitress and she was awesome. We will forever ask for her when we go there, which will be our monthly place to dine (maybe more). She kept our drinks full and was on top of everything. She made us feel as though we had been going there for years.  

After our experience today, I can totally see why the reviews are great.  I strongly encourage you to give this place a try and if you aren't sold at that point... Then there must be something wrong with you. ( relax, I'm only teasing).",PHW4Ixb3yO6dFECILUnZnQ,5,2,5,jfJ4-XhWi62I5QoY2JXqfw
5466077,2014-12-20,2,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"I meant to review this after a trip to Austin where I had gotten some Texas barbecue/ranch style cooking in my system, and well, it's kind of like cannibalism: ""Once you get a taste"", they say....

(Editor's Note: I have not taken to eating people.)

This place amazing exists in Vegas.  I had never even heard of it until it just sort of magically appeared to me one day like a beacon of meat-laden hope.

Set in a residential neighborhood well off the beaten path, this restaurant is an actual ranch, with an authentic Western feel.  When you drive up, the smells hit you, and the good feelings of Austin washed over me again, right down to the decor.  You can even see them cooking up the various meats.

This place serves up a damn fine steak.  It is hands down one of the better steaks I have enjoyed while in Vegas.  The sides that I had (potatoes and lobster bisque) really fleshed out the meal, as did the excellent red wine that I chose to accompany my meal.

Service was wonderful.  Pricing was reasonable.  Over the past year I have become a big fan of ""Old Vegas""-style restaurants, and this place falls well into that category.

If you hail from a place where big slabs of meat are king, then you have found your satellite ""Promised Land"" here.  I will definitely go again once the opportunity arises, and I need a good steak served up in a true ""home style"" setting.  Again, I had no clue that this place existed, but I am glad I does.

The open flame grill and the aroma of meat in the air made it difficult to concentrate on what my husband was talking about. The ribs fell off the bone.

We have recommended the restaurant numerous times and taken friends and relatives for a great meal. This all came to a screeching halt Sunday, 4/4/16. My Mom was in town visiting and wanted to take us to dinner. Since we had all been to Bob Taylor's together she chose there. I ordered a filet, my husband the same and my Mom the lobster and filet. My filet was over cooked my husbands was under cooked and my Moms lobster was like rubber. We sent everything back, our waiter was very gracious and tried to help in any way that he could. I want to stress that this situation was actually made better by his professionalism. Our food arrived the second time and my filet was raw. My husbands was half under cooked and half over cooked. Fortunately the lobster tail was cooked properly. I spoke to the hostess as my husband was pretty steamed and embarrassed by the poor meal that we were being served and that my Mom was paying. I was told that the manager that night was the chef and that my situation could be handled by the hostess. She was very accommodating in that she spoke to the chef. In the meantime, the table next to us were experiencing their same type of situation and not only sent food back but walked out letting them know that they would not be back. These were regulars. I sent my meat back and told them not to bother to attempt to cook another filet, as I was not only upset by the lack of attention to detail but also the fact that food was being wasted. Ultimately our bill was highly reduced but we left with my Moms lobster tail in a to go container (it came too late for her to eat- she had her filet while waiting), my husband ate half of his meat and I had no dinner. 
My husband had a long conversation with the hostess who said that the chef had been there a long time and really could not provide any explanation on his behalf. As we were leaving, another plate was returned to the chef because the meat was undercooked. The chef looked at it, stabbed it with a carving fork and smacked it back on the grill. 
I can say that we have eaten our last meal at Bob Taylor's Ranch House for a very long time - quite possibly we will never go back. We also will not be recommending nor bringing family or friends.",GJiu6EHAYjWIHfOYsPZ3Aw,9,0,1,83Ny6kJ-U3SkC0-zqsZJbg

Bob Taylor's Ranch House is a throwback in so many ways from the cowboy decor, to the music and even menu.  Just the entrance itself is photoworthy!  I felt like I was at some roadside restaurant in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Seeing the chef turning all those steaks as the hostess walked us to our table had me salivating big time!

We got the cajun shrimp appetizer which was just ok.  While the flavor was nice, the shrimp was a little on the small side.  We still ended up soaking up all the sauce with the complimentary ""garlic cheese toast"".  

The wife got the filet (rare) and I got the bone-in ribeye (medium rare) after much encouragement from our friendly waitress.  The ribeye was a massive 24 oz's of which I was only able to finish half of.  I usually prefer rare steaks but when it comes to the ribeye cut, I prefer it a little more cooked so I can appreciate all the parts of it from the outside char to the tender center and everything in between.  $42.99 for a ribeye seems cheap these days haha.  The filet mignon was very tender with great flavor. 

All entrees come with your choice of soup (it was a not bad lobster bisque) or salad (avoided based on Jade's review of it being IHop-esque) and a side. I got the twice baked potato only because I wanted the cook to work a little instead of paying for a baked potato which requires really no work at all.  My wife got the ranch house potatoes which could only be described as crazy hash browns.  No $12 a la carte sides items like 16 miles away from here!

Somehow got coerced into getting dessert and was brought the biggest slice of chocolate cake I'd ever seen.  I enjoyed all 3 bites I had before shoving that into the third takeout box of the evening.

Considering how ticked off my wife and I were for things not going as planned that evening, this was a very welcome surprise.  I am a big fan!  Not sure I would go out of my way to make it back here but this would certainly be on the top of my list when I am back around these parts.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,25,21,4,C6wbL3Ip0xWHlu652t78eA

They offer a couple of varieties - twice-baked potato (which is a mashed potato baked twice with the toppings), a baked potato, and the ranch house potatoes.  I had the ranch house potatoes and that was great, but in all honesty I couldn't even finish it cause I was trying to eat the massive piece of meat before me!

The steak was seasoned perfectly, and crusted just the way I like it.  Very moist and juicy, and tender.  The best steak that I have had, period.

Bob Taylor's is about as far northwest as you can go and still be inside civilization in Nevada.  The dirt parking lot proves it.

You walk into a classy, yet Western themed restaurant that captures the feel of Old Vegas and the rugged West.  As you're led to your table, you walk past an indoor grill area where the meals are prepared.

Dinner, which for me, was the baby back ribs was exceedingly tasty -- and surprisingly affordable.  The prices run well below the celebrity locales along the Strip -- and every meal includes garlic cheese toast, soup or salad, and a side.   The ribs were incredible -- as was everything else on our table.  Our server was friendly and efficient.

Now, by no means did they rip me off, I don't want anyone to get the feeling that they pulled one over on us or anything.  

We came here as a big group for the $1/oz prime rib night.  Certainly a 16 oz. prime rib for $16 is a great deal.  To sum up the meal, it's extra $5 for the sides, extra for the drinks, and by the end of the night it came out to around $35 per person.  Certainly not a bad deal, but still a bit deceptive thinking your 12 oz. was going to cost $12.  The steak was cooked medium for a medium rare order, and the 1 level overcook seemed pretty consistent for everyone.  I would say quality of the meat would be considered okay, but certainly not at the level approaching anything close to Lawry's.  

Service is excellent and pleasant.  Atmosphere is great and the western decor is appropriate to the name and atmosphere.  Not sure I would do it again, but probably worth everyone trying it once.

When you come here, you need to know what kind of experience you're going to get. This is a restaurant that looks like an old ranch house (see what I did there?) and has an Old West country feel.  You aren't going to find an 800 degree oven and tuxedoed waiters asking if you want sparking or still Voss. You can get that on the strip. If you want a good steak, cooked with perfect ""x"" grill marks, come here. 

I've been here about ten times over the past few years and have never been disappointed.  I always get one of the ribeyes.  The past few times I've opted for the bone-in 22oz ribeye, medium rare ($47).  It has always been cooked near perfectly and has great flavor.  There's a subtle smokiness to the steak that you can only get from cooking on a grill, and it's rare to find elsewhere. 

Soup/salad, garlic cheese toast, and a side are all included in the price of the steak.  The ranch house potatoes are like creamy cheesy hash browns, and are my favorite side. There's also an option of twice baked potato (very good), baked potato (standard), and several other options I've never bothered to try. 

The desserts are also fantastic.  Ask what they have and trust that whatever you order will be a great finish to a great meal. 

If you want to splurge on a good steak without having to pay extra for sides, then this is the place to go!",_w1svBLzB2Z251UdtB090w,4,2,5,e2NTQsdxbMnEC3WQJ46KtQ

The server, Jeanette, was very friendly, efficient, and fast. She gave a top-notched service. Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered the 16oz rib-eye and the rest ordered the prime-rib. Both entrees tasted great! Their portions were huge as well. We had to take home most of what we ordered. This place is a great find!",ZgoGr28ZviYWTlwFkqblCw,1,0,4,WWUknMWD9zw7iCvw3w2VUA
5923354,2016-02-12,2,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"We live across town but wanted to try this restaurant based on positive feedback from friends experiences so our expectations were high.  We had the worst waitress (Liz) I have ever had and we eat out a few times a month. Our table was trying to enjoy two birthdays that night and we will NEVER be coming back. The waitress has been doing this job for over 9 years and must hate it because her facial expressions led me to believe any questions were quite annoying and redundant. My son ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs which never came. When we reminded her about them, she brought them out and claimed to be fresh, she was clearly mistaken because they were cold and dry like they had been sitting in the pass for a long time. She also forgot to take a 1/2 rack of ribs off the check because they were dry and cold after saying they just came out of the window.  She also up-selled an order of french fries while making it sound like they came with something we ordered.  My friend ordered a brownie sundae and there was barely a brownie there and when the waitress asked if she would like another brownie, I asked if there was going to be a charge.  She replied with attitude YET AGAIN, ""Well, there usually is, but since you are UNsatified, I can go ahead and not charge you."" Like we did something wrong.  I am not a person who has trouble speaking their mind and I also believe service is reflected in the tip.  Needless to say, she deserved NOTHING.  I only left her a $5 tip on $50 (my portion) when I wanted to leave her NOTHING.  I wrote a note to the waitress suggesting she may want to change her attitude especially being she has done this for over 9 years. I noticed her reading it while walking back to the kitchen and saw the hostess and other waitress reading it as well. As I was walking out, the hostesses were looking at me and I knew they read it too.  My son told me the waitress flicked me off as I was going out the door.  In my opinion, someone with that much tenure being a waitress should be able to handle a large party easily and our table wasn't even difficult! ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, she came back and asked us to please take our party to the lobby to continue chatting because they had other parties waiting. I was livid.  I will never be back here, EVER. I have several restaurants that have quality of food AND service in this wonderful city of Las Vegas that I will willingly give my money too, but Bob Taylors will NEVER see a penny from me, my family, or friends.  I will be more than happy to spread the word about that evil waitress to make sure if they happen to go to make sure they don't get HER.",_Q4g3iminnouBA3wNFwHIQ,7,1,1,24bRH7JRjroMmSWcvplBTg

I'm giving it actually a 2 1/2 star, My review is relative to quality and price compared to Casino steak houses. The place is a 40 minute drive from Henderson and I wouldn't mind the drive if it was worth it and it was not. The price you pay is equal or more to some casino steak houses and yet the quality of meat is inferior. First it is definitely regular cut and not even a Black Angus Beef. I am not even expecting an aged and cured beef but for an average price of $30 I think a quality meat is expected.
I ordered a medium rare rib eye and it came out well done and gave me a Sirloin instead of a rib eye, I called the waitress attention to it and she insisted it was a rib eye cause the sirloin cut is a little rounded as she told me.I guess she was all mixed up. a rib eye is never cut rectangular. when you take the bone out it is somewhat oval.
The thickness of the steak is under half an inch, perhaps to make it less hard on your bite. You need a serious knife skill to cut the meat and it was medium rare the second time they brought it out. My wife's  fillet mignon was 2 pieces of basically an end cut. I was not expecting a chateaubriand but I expected a descent cut at least considering it is on the $30 price range. 
Delmonico Steak house at The Venetian, Gallagher's at the New York Newyork or Silverado Restaurant at South point is way better in my opinion at the same price range. If you are willing to spend more I will recommend Michaels inside South Point too.",O38E6KW3oiUD9VxHNziakg,2,0,3,c0lNgCQz4SBH2UaQ58vQkQ
5960001,2017-12-31,5,FhIeCF6QrsLaRvAeu0oEPQ,"I have heard about Bob Taylor's over the years figuring I'd get there eventually. After nearly 12 years living in Vegas, I finally made the trek for dinner with my guy and his co-workers. 

Located in the middle of nowhere, this isn't a spot that you would just come across on your way somewhere else. The restaurant is located in a ranch as the name suggest and is somewhat of an institution since it has been around for so long. 

They have kept the vintage vibe alive and well there. The service was ok, attentive at times but needed a nudge from time to time for refills and such. We started with a few appetizers that were not particularly memorable and their cheesy garlic bread which was one of the highlights for me. I decide on the prime rib since I had heard was one of the better selections. It was good, although nothing amazing. 

Each couple ordered a dessert to share as well. Our key lime pie was standard, yet tasty. The cheesecakes our dining companions ordered were not as well received. 

For the price, it's not bad and I've heard their lunch is good as well so I might be interested in trying that some time. Otherwise, I'm happy I tried this spot but it might be one and done for me.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,7,3,L427DVd10tx445IERKSEKA

We finished our drinks and she never came back to see if we wanted another. It took forever to get our check. We will not be back.,xYKP-R3XhIqYOe07_U9a7w,4,0,2,1Mlzug4wV_07WDJ3pQnrtQ

 Enjoyed to food (prime rib, filet and grilled chicken) and ambiance cute very supper club like.
Tiramisu and chocolate cake fantastic. 


A little disappointing to drive 45 minutes for sub par service. Sever took 10 minutes to get to the table, another 15 minutes to get a Diet Coke & glass of wine. Had to ask bus boy to locate. We finished off 4 pieces of garlic toast before any drinks made it to the table. Sever failed to refill beverages through out the meal. Asked manager and found out the server was not new. The other tables in other sections seemed ok. Next time we'll make sure not to sit in that section or go to bar. 
Note seating a little cramped. We could easy pick up conversations from the table next to us, as knew the names of the unruly children who kept annoying their parents.  
Recommend for late dinning or during the week. Also parking area doesn't drain well, with uneven terrain and random piles or rocks hard to navigate in dark.",2G4wLWYtpJaVsaQ0dOxF0w,1,0,3,afohcKUDO-rX-RGu3EZ9Eg
