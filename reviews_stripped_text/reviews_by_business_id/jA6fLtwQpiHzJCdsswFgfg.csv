2227055,2018-04-06,0,jA6fLtwQpiHzJCdsswFgfg,"The vegetarian fajitas were amazing. Fresh baked fajita bread ( Gutamalan style), beans and rice. A great suprise for a couple of vegetarians on a date. The host Sal was very pleasant and really made it more authentic. Reasonably priced but hidden in a corner of the strip mall across from the UNLV campus.",6fHBXA80ZDCD6B2ZsbRMgg,1,0,5,gqwHa3ESVnJgJG6Ss-kHOw
