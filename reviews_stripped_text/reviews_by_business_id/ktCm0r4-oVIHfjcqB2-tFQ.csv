I ordered a pizza and some Parmesan bites, I feel they think that powder/seasoning is amazing but ITS NOT!! At least not when you get too happy with it and dump a fuck ton on everything.... Point being I give 0 stars to dominos the quality of their product is cheap but they want to charge ridiculous prices..",_em750NBrW-Ihc6F-jqFOg,0,0,1,QwqDedasrDVNs7oMyYkg3Q

He then proceeds to be snark and say ""I will read them for you if you want."" Serious customer service fail. How rude!

First time i order from dominos online, i get this store, place my order, pay online and everything is does fine...

Except it's been over an hour and i'm still waiting for my order to arrive, according to dominos online order tracker, my order has been out for delivery for 64 minutes.... 
What kind of service is that, i'm currently on the phone to complain with the manager, and guess what, it's been 9 minutes since my called was answered by their system, and i can't even speak to a human, all they got is a recording of all their specials... 

UPDATE: just hanged up with the store's manager told me to call the general manager at the store in Sahara and Valley View... called there, and their manager shouted to me on the phone, you can tell they are having a lousy day, but i'm not the one to blame... i'm just another customer that ordered and payed for a pizza, because he was hungry, and 2 hours later i'm still hungry because of them, now i'll have to wait for 3 to 5 days to get my money back?, that's what happens when you order from this place...

Next time i'll just order from Pizza Hut or Papa John's, who BTW i'm sure are really thankful of how Domino's treats their customers...

Watched multiple people come and go, then the guy says that our order was taken by a driver by mistake. They had the nerve to ask us to wait again. And wanted to offer a my girlfriend a soda after making us wait. Incompetent workers just wanting to play at work and not pay attention. So we waited 45 mins for some 15 minute Pizzas. Yeah I'm ok on this place. We just went to Little Caesar's down the street like we should've in the beginning. You earned a 1 star for the lack of service you provided. Now somewhere there is someone else who got the wrong order as well so it was a lose/lose for all. I'll bet you didn't think I would make her get that money back but that was exactly what I did.

I would've even given them 3 stars. It is Domino's after all. Can't expect 5 star customer service and food. However, I don't think that it's too much to ask NOT to get sick. Which I did after eating their food. I ended up going to bed with terrible stomach pains. Finally fell asleep and was woken up by more stomach pain and ended up puking my guts out twice. I didn't expect excellent customer service or even spectacular food. But I did expect NOT to have stomach pains and puke my guts out. You've been warned.
