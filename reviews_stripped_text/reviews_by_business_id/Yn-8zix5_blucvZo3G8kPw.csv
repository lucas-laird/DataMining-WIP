Service was pathetic...I think my waitress was the Grinch's wife or girlfriend.
I was disappointed by the food and the inattentive service for sure.  One small cup of coffee for $2.29 is ridiculous and once she served that I never saw her again at my table till my food was served 15 minutes later.  Eggs Benedict happens to be one of my favorites, but today it was lack luster, served barely warm and looked like it had been waiting on the service line for awhile.  Then to top it off why would you used a iceberg lettuce leaf for garnish under the fruit.  I  usually tip way to much but today was not your waitress day  I won't be back....",IXNhLLoNefd8FQmfFFpL2A,1,0,2,B7uyeI-Yeu_6OeScj_6Z0Q

Breakfast items include omellettes(?), wraps, scrambles; a la carte items, french toast, pancakes, sausage patties, biscuits & gravy...spice it up, tone it down.  They do have a lunch menu but I've not ordered from it. 

I tend to order the breakfast sandwich: egg, bacon, cheese on a biscuit. Servers will say they're not sure if it can be made that way...I've had it twice. IT CAN BE DONE!!  And its AMAZEBALLS!!

Servers are super nice, you don't wait long for your order.  They do serve beer for breakfast...kinda cool but not my thing. 
Portions are large. 

I only gave 4 stars because.....their hours. 7-3.  I live across the street. Can't stop in for breakfast to go, even if I tried.  There's no time. I can't help but wonder how much business they are losing by not opening an hour earlier??",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,3,1,4,Egyv47_07QfIXT9ARIOAmg

The dishes are really flavorful, and don't require a liberal use of salt (something that is rare for me!).  They also offer healthy fares and the traditional stuff like waffles, pancakes, etc.  The coffee is good, but not great.  

In my opinion, this particular location has yet to hit its stride; I think the main set-back is that the restaurant decor doesn't match the ambiance of the restaurant, e.g., the black leather dinner chairs seem to be at odds with the home cooked food. 

Nonetheless, I really, REALLY hope that more people discover this location and start making it out.  The restaurant is clean, the food is good, the employees are friendly, and the service is great.

I've had better eggs from a roach coach at my work. My wife ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap and I only tasted hot sauce.

  Server came around only once to ask if everything was ok and for refills. Server did not clear plates so I had to stack my dirty plates in order to have room to be able to eat my entree. 

After finishing my meal I had to wait for the server to return from her break or wherever she had gone so I could pay. Will never eat here again.",1NIzNf1__L6H8tVC3TRWqw,0,0,1,5zwJmby3Ci4_xk60d-tsAA

580902,2014-05-11,0,Yn-8zix5_blucvZo3G8kPw,"After hearing fairly good things about this restaurant, we decided to try it, of all days, on Mother's Day. Now I understand that a breakfast place will be busy on Mother's Day, but we didn't experience any wait. Not only that, but they let us put our name on the wait list via a phone call. Upon arrival, we walked in and right to a table. This is where is started to go down hill. 

It took quite a while to get our drinks once ordered. Most of us drank coffee or water. My brother ordered an orange juice, which took them about a half hour to bring, later informing us that the juices machine was having problems. It happens. We ordered our food.  There was 6 adults and 1 child that we ordered for. It took them approximately 45 minutes for the first of us to get our food after we ordered. I say this because my wife, who ordered eggs Benedict, had to send hers back because the eggs were cooked far too hard. My son, which we ordered mini pancakes and sausage, came out with bacon instead. My poor sister in law didn't even get hers for about another 15-20 minutes after. She ordered a BLT with no mayo. Would you believe it? Once it finally came, there was mayo on it. She also ordered a side of soup. It never came. They said they had to remake the soup. This was almost an hour after we ordered and after the rest of us had received our food. She ordered french fries as a sub. She never received those either. Toast was included with the rest of our meals, which none of us received, even after asking/reminding 2-3 times. It also took my wife's meal another 10 minutes to get fixed, which when finished, she said tasted pretty bad. 

The part that topped this all off was we asked for the manager on a couple of occasions in order to voice our concerns. We never did speak to a manager. We didn't even see what appeared to be someone in charge walking around the restaurant. So basically we were just ignored.

The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of our waitress, who based on the name on the check, I'm pretty sure was named Chelsea. You could see she was working as hard as she could and that her day was hectic. She did everything she could. Hopefully they'll reward her for the hard work she did. 

All in all, we will never be back. The food was mediocre at best and riddled with a myriad of mistakes. Coupled with the bad service, with the exception of Chelsea, this place isn't worth it. No wonder the one on South Rainbow went out of business.",kod_wkCJI75GJB7faj2Gkg,1,0,2,1pMeM9uq9w_tq4jbLVBTNA

The BLT, and you can go wrong with this, but not here. Bread toasted nicely, plenty of bacon, lettuce and tomato and just enough mayonaisse to make it moist. 

One of my girls had eggs, bacon & hashbrowns, by the looks of her clean plate, she liked it. The other one had pancakes & bacon.

Three slices of the French toast, turkey, ham, Swiss cheese, and fried eggs served with a side of strawberry dipping sauce and sprinkled with powdered sugar. I pretty much inhaled this dish, the salty bacon, eggs and turkey was complemented perfectly by the sweet strawberry sauce. The French toast wasn't overly eggy either, lightly toasted and crispy on the edges.

Better than a Denny's or IHOP but not by much. It was very clean and wasn't very busy. Our waitress was very apparently new and was very timid. She got everything correct! There was just no enthusiasm for her job. 

My wife had the French toast with bacon and eggs. She enjoyed her meal and said everything seems to fresh. The eggs were real and the toast was a thick cut with great flavor. I had biscuits and gravy with hash browns. The potatoes were good but bland and a little well done. The biscuits and gravy were nothing special. A mix gravy and frozen biscuits with a cafeteria flavor. The coffee was completely acceptable. 

I'm looking for a place who puts forth the effort to make real gravy and real biscuits. Our meal came to a hair under $20. Not too bad but for the price, the quality could be a bit better.",OXwmkyamQ5H6Ed0xZo_kQA,2,0,3,vPNakncGQ-jxWUp-_y95Fw

Tables around us had the same problem, parties of 2 and 3 waiting 50, 60, and even 90 minutes for their food.  This is RIDICULOUS!!  On top of that my omelet arrived with cheese when I requested none and the other dish had cold eggs.  I asked to speak with the manager and was told they would go get him.  I told our waitress the omelet had cheese but I would just eat it because I was sure as hell wasn't another 50 minutes for another one.    Miraculously, another omelet arrived without cheese in less than 5 minutes!  It is not like this place was super crowded either.  We sat right down with no wait and there were several empty tables.  Do you think the manager ever came to address my concerns?  NEGATIVE!!  Bad management, no apology, explanation, or even acknowledgement.

When my favorite waitress left Twin Peaks I quit going there. When I followed her to New Day, she says stalking, I say following, (Tomato/Tomoto)  it became clear that I had found a haven of great foods. (and people). Now I will admit, I am the kind of guy that has one meal I get in each of the restaurants I visit. On the other hand my wife rarely gets the same thing twice and tries everything on the menu over time. New Day is my place for the Ortega Beef melt. Now it's true, I thought Ortega was the name of a foreign car, as in Toyota Ortega or something, but it turns out it is a mild pepper and this sandwich is fantastic. My wife has ordered about a dozen different things and loved everything but the Fish and chips and she already has a favorite place for those so all  is good.

I asked, ""why would you make us wait if you have at least 20 open tables?"" The hostess replied, ""well we have a few large parties so, we're not seating.""
 Let me tell you, I've been here before and the food is just ok. Basic diner style food, so they should be doing everything they can to fill those empty tables, especially in a competitive restaurant market.

Service was super:  Waitress was attentive, friendly, and prompt.  We were seated immediately in a comfortable booth.

Ambience:  Was diner style.  Could eat at the counter, bootth, table, or outside.

Food:  Here's where they dropped a star or two.
Original order was one of the healthy choices:  bacon, spinach omelet with egg whites, toast, and cottage cheese.  The bacon was a little mushy, which when you cook with just the egg white, you gotta put the bcon in last.   Flavor was decent.  A little salty.
This is where they got it wrong.  I ordered the eggs Benedict florentine  special for the day.  looked beautiful, and the eggs looked to be perfectly cooked.  I didn't get that far.  Dipped my fork into the 'hollendaise' which did appear to be a little gummy.  Tasted it.  Could go no further.  I am not sure what it really was...but definitely not hollendaise.  Pasty yellow gravy...drank a sip of coffee to get rid of the taste.

I never send food back....ever.  I usually change my mindset....settle for average, and eat it.  This was a first.  And the waitress was so nice about the whole thing.  Brought back the menu, and took my plate away.

On the re-order they earned back a star to bring to 3.  The two eggs were perfectly cooked over easy, and the ham steak was awesome.  Hand cut, thick steak, that wasn't overly salty.  I should have stuck with the basics at a diner-type location.  Lesson learned.

Coffee was pretty strong....not bad or bitter, just strong.

Solid non-IHOP breakfast, locally owned, and got super crowded....so locals like their food.",UqHTZKPc8mtIkbmWfXid7A,0,0,3,x-xx3FR4dNqZxZX8Dwjkrg

There were a lot of empty tables.  The server moved very slowly and was in no rush to keep her tables happy.. or at least informed since she never really came around except to take our order and bring us our food. 
When the food came my EGG WHITE omelette was light yellow.  The server said ""its because of the artichokes.""  Really?!?  That's a first!  I never had artichokes that colored my egg whites before...must be a type of artichoke I've never had before The omelette itself lacked flavor.  The country fried steak lacked flavor and the over medium eggs we ordered needed to be a little more cooked as the whites resembled clear slime just below the surface.

there would be a wait, no problem.
We usually come here very often because it's 
close not bad food needs an uplift to the menu
items new variety, but when we were seated 
our waitress who we know from the old location
was not pleasant seemed like she could care 
less about her customers.
We ordered the Tommy B omelette and 2 eggs
benedicts. We hasked for crispy bacon in pmace
of ham easy on the sauce.
Well the headache begins no follow up service
on coffee refills the bacon was not crispy sent
back the eggs were nearly raw like a rush job
and slothered in sauce.
It seemed like they never remade the breakfast
but added even more sauce to hide the fact.
After being in the resturant for almost 1.5 hours
sitting waiting on our order while other tables
seated after us finished eating and left I think they
lost our order in the shuffle and did not know until
we said something then rushed the food out.
Eggs uncooked fee liking like getting sick ?
When we asked for the manager our server sent
over another server guess she did not want to deal
with us anymore she said he stepped out.
She said we did not have to pay for the breakfast
my husband said no we are not we are leaving 
she expected us to eat the raw eggs just because
she said we did not have to pay for it. Can you 
believe this?
I was SHOCKED!!!!!  Eat under cooked eggs because
it's free ate you crazy what kind of answer was that?
We will NOT be going back there.
We went to another establishment on Eastern Ave
And the food was quality service was good and the
food had much better taste and the quality of the
food was so much better. Higher standards.

I usually can't finish an entire breakfast plate no matter where we go, but on this sweet day I cleaned my plate and wanted more!!  The country fried steak had a nice light and crisp breading on the outside but was tender and so flavorful underneath the breading.  The gravy was was just the right consistency of thickness and the flavor was on POINT!  It came with two over-easy eggs cooked to perfection, which I happily dipped my perfect toasted wheat bread into.  

I love that there is never a wait no matter what day or time you show up.   The servers are really nice and they take your order on an iphone.  At first I was like, ""Is she TEXTING while taking our order!?? WTH!!""  but no, she was just being technologically savvy.  The food came out so fast.  You ALL know that the wait for breakfast seems to be SO much longer than the wait for any other meal, so it is quite a huge plus that the food is cooked quickly and served quicky here.

Our server had said maybe 4 words to us the whole time never offerd any type of specials or walk us thru the menu. She did not at anytime check on us and after we sang happy birthday to our daughter she never even offerd any birthday deserts or even botherd to check on us... So today we went back to try again, boy that was a dumb idea!!!! Today it was daughter and I and i just looking for some lunch and we decided to give it a try again. We where sat with the same server from the first time we orders waters and a sprite and i orderd an iced coffee, i sent the coffee back because it tasted like it was 8 days old, again no personality from the server and i even apologized for her to have to take the coffee back, my daughter ordered the french toast and i orderd the tortilla soup. Our server shows up and slaps everthing on the table and walks away!!!! Guess what! The soup was cold and when i finally  got her to come back over to our table she was aggravated that i did not want my cold soup!!! So i apologized again to her (should have been the other way around! !!!!) And i told her to please put in an order of steak and eggs med rare for me. While my daughter eats alone our server has disappeared and never checked on us. We waited for about 30 minutes with out drink refills and i finally flaged another person down to refill our waters.. guess who finally shows up? our server!! She slaps my steak and eggs down in front of me and walks away again... after waiting for 25 more minutes for her to return so i can tell her that i asked for med rare and not well done my daughter and I get up and walk to the counter and request for a manager. The manager ends up being our server!!!!!!! How... great.... yay!!! Had an attitude problem when I told her that I'm not paying for this entire experience except for the one thing we actually ate which was the French toast, she then insisted with an attitude oh it's okay I'll void the whole check! She then gave me an attitude when I told her no I would like to pay for the food that my daughter and I ate... she then rolled her eyes and walked away, the girl that was cashing us out at the podium was staring at me like I was speaking in ancient alien hieroglyphics, and was completely incompetent of not knowing what to do. I said you can ring me in for the French toast I would like to pay for that please since we did eat that and enjoyed it... after the hostess regains Consciousness and swipes my credit card for the French toast the manager comes over and has the audacity to yell at the Dazed and Confused creature for swiping me for the French toast.

The food is decent and I have been here about three times, twice the service has been mediocre at best, but one time the server was fantastic. I will start with the bad and end with the good. The bad is this, they appear to use rotten potatoes when making their hashbrowns. Two of the times I was there the shredded hashbrowns had nasty tasting black spots all over them. Also in one of these same visits, the chopped potatoes were not cooked thoroughly and so some of them were hard. The table next to us had the very same issue. What made these visits worse was the server who seemed that anything we asked of her was an imposition. She would sigh and when we told her about the potato issue there was just an ""oh sorry"" as she took away the plate. The food was overcooked and tough and not very good either in these visits.

Now the good, one time I came by here for breakfast and there was different server, this was a much different experience. The food was very good, and the server was extremely nice. We had a small issue and she fixed it immediately and truly acted like she cared about the customer service.

In all, if I HAD to I would stop back in here if it were my only option, but I cannot highly recommend it.

The service is aways spot on. We're greeted promptly and sat promptly.

The food is good, hearty, breakfast. People complaining about lack of salt or pepper? I happen to like it that way. Let ME decide the amount of my seasoning thank you. 

Lattes are delicious. Fried eggs are perfect. Hash browns are crispy. Corned beef hash is yummy.

This is your standard breakfast spot. Nothing special but pretty solid. The menu has all the basics with a handful of speciality items marked with their logo. 
I ordered the Californian omelet which was good. Again, nothing spectacular but definitely met all my expectations. 

The service was not the best... But in their defense I did overhear them say this was the busiest they've been. I sat at the counter (where presumably you would receive the fastest service) and I had to ask for everything - ask for them to take my order, utensils, a straw, jam. I didn't even get a hello when I sat down and about 10 of the staff members walked passed me. 


I would come back but if the poor service continues-most likely not.",NnNdqH3DaleFtQk60UT-og,1,1,4,ebVZvIm0UThYH6xxQnS3Ug

My friend had the veggie omelet and I had one with bacon and avocado.  They diced the avocado into the omelet instead of just plopping it on top, which was a nice touch and kept my leftovers from going brown.  We both liked the hash browns, they needed ketchup for sure, but to me all hash browns require ketchup.

Nice location, clean and roomy. Server was polite and efficient, which was good with me. I don't need bubbles and sunshine from my server. 
Crepes Combo: scrambled eggs were wet and hovering on the edge of cold; bacon was a second away from being burned but at least it was warm; strawberry crepes..... no. I know that sweet crepes are sometimes filled with a flavored cream cheese. Cream cheese would have been fine if it was plain and sweetened with a little sugar, then add a few slices of strawberry. But these crepes were stuffed with what tasted like an off-brand strawberry-flavored cream cheese from an economy tub. A thin smear on a bagel might be okay; but gobs of it in one bite, not so much. There was maybe one sliced strawberry on top to decorate both crepes. Obviously I did not finish them. I ate one after squishing out half the filling and sliding the crepe through the strawberry sauce on the plate.
Side note: I wasn't in a hurry, but I was in and out in about 30 minutes. Good if you're looking to fill your tummy quickly with something other than fast food fare or buffet bacteria bonanza. I don't say stay away from this place, just don't expect amazing, yum, so delicious. Maybe it's there in another dish.",DCAi-GeI94fiDLC3l3acEQ,0,0,3,zrPUv33rBbAuQ7K9si5IEg
