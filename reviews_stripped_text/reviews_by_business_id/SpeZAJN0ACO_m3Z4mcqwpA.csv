She was trying to be helpful despite the long line. The margherita pizza was definitely lacking in flavor. The tomato sauce was running off the pizza and making a complete mess. This place needs to get it together and work on customer service and the quality of the food. I'd give this another try if they fix these 2 things.,pB2VFtYzImkFG39WPs6TaQ,0,0,2,O8DU1hw_dIn7RdoPrtKw2Q
1205957,2018-04-03,1,SpeZAJN0ACO_m3Z4mcqwpA,"Gluten-free, Vegan Pizza Review: Located right smack in the center of the food court, this pizza place decided to offer gluten-free, vegan pizza to their customers, HUGE bonus points for that. I wish Yelp allowed us to vote in 1/2 star increments because three seems a bit low and four on the high side - ohhh I'm a picky one I know. 

PROS:
+ They have gluten-free crust
+ They have vegan cheese 
+ Pizza cooks in 90 seconds 
+ Tons of fresh vegetable options 
+ Thoroughly cooked, thin-crust and crunchy - YUM

CONS:
- The lady had no clue what kind of vegan cheese it was
- After tasting it, I believe they use Daiya cheese which I'm not a huge fan of 
- Gluten-free, vegan pizza was pricy for a 9"" size (only option for gluten-free) I think it was around $13 or so

I'm thankful they even offered this option, so I don't want to complain too much. Just some helpful tips to be better, try to use Violife cheese if possible (it's theee best vegan cheese in my opinion).",wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ,3,2,4,K9roqEgX4_x5Nvlr56Pmuw

I don't really know how true that is -they gave us a buzzer to take with us ( which is much better then standing around waiting for it ) so it may cook that quick - but it took longer to actually be ready to take with us.

Social Life Pizza is similar to Blaze and other pizza places popping up that build and bake your custom pizza in less than 5 minutes.  It's location did come at a premium however.  A pizza that's under $8 at Blaze will run you over $12 at Social Life.  And the build your own option is not unlimited, it's a per topping charge.

Instead of building our own pizzas we ordered two of their Favorites pies; the Luau and the BBQ Chicken.  The Luau was by far our favorite of the two.  The BBQ Chicken was just okay.  The gorgonzola and BBQ Sauce were a little overpowering.  The crust on both were excellent; thin and crispy and cooked perfectly.  

My friend and I definitely could have shared one pizza.  We wound up tossing the equivalent of a whole pie because we didn't want to carry it around while shopping.  At least we were able to try 2 different items, but I always feel terrible throwing food away.

There were no other customers while I was there, and the pizza sample I was offered wasn't great. Two red flags that I ignored for the sake of sampling several different varieties of food. I ordered a Margarita pizza for $9, and I was disappointed with how small it was. Very little flavor and the cheese shaker was empty. Honestly, I would be happier with my go-to pizza place - $5 for a large pepperoni pizza back home.",jrixwLYBcaZCzup2xDR9kg,1,1,2,IND9mx8LbNKgrvChwh_6IA

The pizza is made from start to finish right in front of you. A plain cheese personal size pizza starts at $7.99, for $2.00 more you get unlimited regular toppings. 
I ordered a cheese pizza with mushroom and meatball. All the toppings are right in front of you to see. 
They take a fresh piece of dough, place it in a press, add the toppings and place in in what looks like a brick oven. The whole process took about 7 minutes. The staff is very friendly and helpful. 
The pizza was very good, sauce had very good flavor and no skimping on the cheese and toppings. For the price and quality, they put Grimaldis to shame! Give them a try!",zFZV8lyG0WbGC05PP0sxug,5,2,5,7StUZ3RoEMKO2c10FMF-Vw

It was the most appealing option in the Venetian food court area and the food was reasonably priced for a Vegas casino. The margherita pizza was a solid, standard option: thin crust and not too heavy on the sauce or cheese.

I enjoyed the meatballs, they were a bit softer than the usual italian meatballs. The baked ziti also came with 2 bread sticks and those were really good!

As With every other place. Things are a bit pricey, like the pastas and the main entrees, but the pizza was decently priced at $11 for a small pizza that could fill up a single person. I recommend splitting it to get your money's worth (we split 2 pizzas in between 3 people). Even though we shared the pizzas it was enough to fill us up, so they are a pretty good size, even if they look small in the menu pictures.

We had the bbq chicken and carnes pizza, which comes with pepperoni, sausage and salami. Both were really good, I like the bbq chicken more because it wasn't as cheesy (I don't like things with too much cheese) and it had a nice balance of flavours.",AsYMm_O4H-mwmWbmeACDHw,2,1,3,zucGcJqBug13_JGZZZneLA

5226488,2014-08-08,6,SpeZAJN0ACO_m3Z4mcqwpA,"Bought a pizza and water.  Water in one hand and pizza in other when I take 5 steps from register and the crappy cardboard they put the pizza on  started bending down.  I got closer to the ground and was able to keep pizza from falling cheese side first.  It landed on crust, but the entire pizza was on the floor.  

I went back to the cashier and he refused to replace my pizza.  He saw what happened .  I told him if he doesn't replace it I'll just eat it off the floor-which I did.  He didn't seem to mind that as long as he wouldn't have to make another pizza for me.   Zero class and hospitality.  He didn't look surprised when he saw the cardboard bend and pizza fall so I'm sure it happens often.  Cardboard bent a good 4 inches towards the center, not at the very tip.  

Now for the taste,  I'm sure it's a good pizza, but eating it off the floor it tasted pretty bad.  Cheese was rubbery and was missing a few pepperoni.  Stay  away from an eatery that won't do what's right!!!",BYl8IrDK4GLagl94LiXJ_w,1,0,1,9tCVlgS-4HluF8N0hWX4IA

There are lots of other options here for food but if youre liking for pizza this is your place to go. They also serve pasta, side salads, breadsticks, and meatballs.

I got the pesto pizza and i must say it was pretty good and also super filling. The pesto was delicious and fresh and the pizza was a good size, about six slices. For sure enough for two people to share if you aren't starving, and only cost about 9 bucks. As for the pasta it looks alright but plain so if you are with children this could be an easy solution for picky eaters or plain eaters. This place can also accommodate vegetarians with their salads and vegetables options and pizza lovers alike. And overall well run place and good options. 

Would  I say it was amazing?? No,but i will say it was good enough to eat and i would recommend it if you are staying at the Venetian or palazzo casinos or just inside them for the day.
