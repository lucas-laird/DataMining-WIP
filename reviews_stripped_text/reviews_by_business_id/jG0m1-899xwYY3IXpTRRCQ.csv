Try the potato tacos, its sliced potatoes pan fried with cheese served taco style.  They also have a ton of hot sauce that is always fun to grab a few and try them on different tacos.  My only complaint is their fountain drink machine, granted they did fix the ice machine, but sometimes the drinks are flat.

The food is always fresh and made to order. Their homemade salsa is great.

They aim to be known as ""Home of the Fish Taco,"" but their potato taco really gives them a unique and unbelievably delicious edge.

Their biggest weakness is their marketing, because if the rest of Las Vegas really knew how great they were, this restaurant would be packed all day, everyday.

They are very cheap and the beers beat any bar's happy hour out there.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,1,0,5,nYiOhE_WgOkmZFGE40lDvw

Atmosphere was like what any typically college student would enjoy.  Place was well-kept and clean, yet it still has an urban feel to it.  If you ever get bored, take some time to read their bumper stickers/decorations.  You'll get a kick out of the sarcasm.

The staff was really friendly and took the time to explain how their menu and specials worked when they learned we were mostly first-timers.  Food came out pretty quickly and we got exactly what we asked for. :-)

I loved that they also carried about 100 different bottles of hot sauces.  For those of you who love spicy food, this would probably be like heaven for you.

Happy hour is from 5-7 I think, $1 tacos and cheap beer, and every Friday is Fish Taco Friday which is $1 for fish tacos ALL day Friday. I do not like fish, but if you do, go for it.

The tacos aren't the traditional Mexican tacos, more like island-inspired tacos. Fish tacos are to die for, but you also have to try the potato tacos. Sounds awkward but it's delicious. My favorite thing about the restaurant? They have over 30-40 different hot sauces ranging from mild to the adventurous super hot.

As a whole, this place was a little more run down than I'd expected. Sat in the dark bar area because it was a hot day and apparently that's the side where the AC was working.

Got a trio of tacos for my lunch, they were smaller than expected, like street tacos. Their fish tacos are their claim to fame, but I found the fish itself a bit dry and plain. The shrimp taco was a little sad with like one and a half shrimp for $2.75, but tasted fresh. I got one of their potato tacos as well, and pleasantly found that I liked their version much more than another spot in town where they are featured. I liked their salsa and their tortillas held up well.

I'll keep this spot in mind when in the area. Note that they have discounted tacos available on Tuesdays and Fridays, along with HH drink specials. This spot seems to be more of a bar where you can grab tacos rather than a taco restaurant, IMO.

Walking in, it is very small (only 7 tables in the main eating area) and very dark. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The manager told me they are known for their fish tacos, so I tried one of those. I also ordered a chicken taco. (Each cost $1.79) Plus when you check in on Yelp, you get a free potato taco ($1.49 value). Each of these is a soft shell taco. I got them with all the fixins (shredded lettuce, cheese, chopped tomatoes, onions, cilantro, etc). The fish taco lived up to reputation - delish!! The potato taco was also excellent. It was like a cut up latke on a soft shell taco with lots of chopped veggies on top. Not dietetic but delicious. The only weak taco was the chicken taco. It was tasty but it was a bit short on the chicken. I had to add the salsa that came with it to give it flavor.  Lunch for under $5 - great value!! And free Wi-Fi. Overall, this was an excellent choice for a lunch.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,0,1,4,K5rOirdrEEYgRq3DaKZ8_Q

When you walk in it's the regular, small restaurant area and to the left is an attached bar for the 21 and older kids! I absolutely love how they put the place together, photos of their customers all over the wall and funny signs scattered everywhere too. 

Onto the food, 
No other place can beat the specials here at Baja! They even have happy hour everyday 5-7pm!!! 

The tacos are great as well. I say they're some of the best in town esp for the price. All people know about is Taco y Taco and Tacos El Gordo, but I honestly think Baja falls in the same category!",X7zysG3Cja6G2blwDyE76Q,3,1,5,CNlEqn-fXIEnr2zmgzyOsw

I walk-in and was immediately greeted by a very friendly and enthusiastic man.. I was looking through their menu for a while.. He told me their ingredients are fresh the fish is a big seller and the potato taco.. Then he told me about their special: 3 Tacos and a Drink for $4.99 (excluding the shrimp). Heck, that sounds good to me and throw in a 4th taco, make it the shrimp.

*All the tacos were served in 2 mini corn tortillas, a slice of lime and they're own hot sauce/salsa

Beef Taco: tiny diced pieces of steak, with the typical pico del gallo topping and some queso. barely any meat and barely any flavor.. Just a Filler.

Fish Taco: tiny diced pieces of grilled Tilapia, topped with queso, pico de gallo but instead of lettuce, they used cabbage. Wasn't soaring with flavor but just right. The cabbage gave it a nice little snap to every bite.

Potato Taco: stuffed with chunks of potato and also had the pico de gallo topping, queso plus some white and yellow shredded cheese. The potato was ridiculously tasty! The cheese was shredded cheese was went with the potatoes like bread and butter! 

Shrimp Taco: small pieces of shrimp that were soft not chewy,  pico de gallo and the crumbled queso went well with it. It was ok.

*Fascinating amount of Hot Sauces to choose from! Im talkin' about  pushin'  about a 100 Different types! I wanted to taste my food, maybe next time I'll be daring and try some of them fire sauces!

Boy, am i glad we did!  We were heading home from another store and decided that on the way home was a necessity. We scrolled through and decided on this location. 

When we entered it was just barely before 7pm, when happy hour ended. We were recognized as new patrons right away and provided information about the menu and happy hour deals. We were also assured our order would reflect happy hour, even if it took us a bit to decide. 

The boy ordered a burrito, I believe chicken, and a fish tacos. I ordered the 3 tacos plate, all chicken. 

The food was delicious and the service was great. It was a really relaxed atmosphere, small and cozy. If we had the time i could have hung out there for hours.

The interior is cool, plenty of table space and seats so not too shabby if you're having a working lunch or supper. The dude at the front was nice and polite. He explained the menu more or less; although, I could have inferred that their main items were tacos and burritos on my own.

I did not like the fact that he charged more for hard-shell tacos, I don't think they're really unique and the incremental cost of producing them over soft-shell is marginal. Furthermore, the hard-shells were opened too far wide so it was difficult to bite into them. The beef was excellent though, juicy, marinated, and tender. The taco was also far too small, about the size of the palm of my hand. The rice and beans were delicious, very flavorful.

The potato tacos are also awesome! The shell reminds you of a soft bird nest that holds the flavorful potato together. 

We went on Friday and there was no one there (apparently UNLV doesn't have classes on Fridays?). The owners were very friendly and even threw in some fried oreos for us. They're pretty good. Not too different from the county fair staple, but who can hate county fair fried food :)

The pricing is fair - you're able to eat 3/4 tacos + drink a beer under $10. 

Right by UNLV with plenty of parking and easily accessible.   Perfect place to pre-game a UNLV basketball game.

Seriously, don't knock the potato tacos until you try them. They're unexpectedly good.

Baja Bar & Grill sits in the same plaza as Smash Burger, Firehouse Subs, Aloha Kitchen, et al. With its proximity to the university and its school-spirited decor, it goes without saying that they cater mostly to the fiscally-conscious college demographic. Specials galore -- Happy Hour 4-7p (M-F), Taco Tuesday $1.25 all tacos (except shrimp), and Rebel Thursdays ($2/$3 booze) to name a few. With a Yelp check-in, you even get a freebie. Your choice of a potato taco or fried oreos, which I have yet to try.

I stopped in recently and the guy at the counter reminded me of a Hawaiian New Yorker. I know that seems like a total contradiction, but he was laid-back yet terse and frazzled. It could have been due to the fact it was taco tuesday and he was manning both the cashier register and doubling as a bus boy. 

As for food, I wouldn't say they have THE best tacos -- El Gordo still has that spot for me -- but for the pricing, location, and efficiency, this place will satisfy your taco cravings.",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,6,6,4,uUoV5_3KqqkoocNVkvdZ6A

On Tuesdays, you get an assortment of tacos for cheap. $1.25 cheap. These aren't Old El Paso hard shells and hamburger helper tacos. These are some hand made tacos and there are plenty to choose from. The tacos may appear tiny but they pack a punch. 

I went with Beef / Chicken / and Spam. Why spam? WHY NOT. Spam is great. It's the right mixture of salt and meat. The taco had the spam cut up into strips which was a good decision. They load up the tacos (they ask you first if you want the works). The beef was also very good. The chicken was a little dry but a bunch of salsa did the trick.

Just a note: It's an older building that's been through some tenants. When we were there, the owner had fixed some of the AC but it was warm in the dining area.

Baja Bar and Grill has been open for about 9 years, per the owners. In that time I have seen them grow from the tiny dive they started out as to the slightly bigger dive they are today. When you come in you are sure to see a lot of funny bumper stickers and a variety of hot sauces. It all makes for some entertaining reading as you wait for your food. They also have games you can play while you are in there socializing, drinking, eating, etc. At least they used to.

I typically get the same things when I go in. I've tried a few different menu items but I know what I lile and what I go back to time after time. Like tonight when I ordered a chicken burrito amd a potato taco (free with Yelp check-in). I love both. They are my two favorite items on the menu. And they are consistently on point. Even after all these years. Full flavor and filling. Loaded with the goods (lettuce, salsa, onions, etc.). I'm not even hungry right now and I am salivating just writing about it.

Who knew a couple of Hawaiian guys could put together a kick-ass Mexican dive bar like this. These braddahs know what they're doing and I am a fan. And if their food isn't reason enough to come in (or back), they remembered me even though it had been at least 4 years since last I visited. How's that for service? And they asked me when I left not to wait so long next time. I'd love to come by more often but I'm just not in the area much these das. But as long as they stay open I'll come back.

They seem to just grill their fish (tilapia), instead of using the deep fried battered fish that I usually see. Also, it seems like no sour cream, tar tar sauce or guacamole has been added. I'm not sure if you can order the stuff optionally. Definitely a much healthier tasting burrito than the nearby Roberto's though, which I'm happy about.

Decked out in wood paneling, aluminum ceiling, and brown (faux?) leather seating, they really strive for this beach and laid back atmosphere. But I was little grossed out (as Misti remarked) about the stained trashcan right next to the tables and bar stools. The fountain station was leaking and the cup covers were not replenished. The area was also littered with boxes and dirty straw covers. That aside, the owner was really nice and explained the menu and recommended the fish, and notified me the 3 tacos + drink= $4.99 deal. So I ordered the chicken, pork, and fish taco.

Tacos are served on foam plates and they're a bit small and kinda skimpy on the meat portions. My favorite was the chicken taco. It had the best flavor and it wasn't oily. Pork (I don't know why they don't just call it carnitas) was fine, nothing special. The fish is grilled which I loved. But it was actually disappointing. Instead of a nice and firm filet, the fish was masticated to bits. The flavor tasted liked old bay seasoning and where was my citrus lime? Even though they had a massive selection of hot sauces, I grabbed one that was already expired. Ugh. I prefer a smaller selection of freshly made salsas and hot sauces over this massive collection.

Food wise this place was just ok to me. I had the Chips & Salsa to start. The portion size was decent, but the chips were super bland and oily. For a meal I had one of the fish tacos & one of the shrimp tacos. Both were just alright, nothing special. I used a lot of the salsa to give them more flavor.

To top it off the service was also sub par. My order took the longest between my two other friends and I ordered first.

4884705,2010-09-29,0,jG0m1-899xwYY3IXpTRRCQ,"I am a frequent customer at Baja Bar & Grill because it is a perfect place to stop for a bite to eat when leaving UNLV.  It is located on the west side of Maryland, so it's easy to get to if you park on UNLV's campus.  It's even a good place to go instead of the library because they have free wi-fi!

The ambience is exactly what you want from a Baja style grill.  There is a selection of about 50 different types of salsas and hot sauces, and there are smart-ass stickers and signs on the wall that say stuff like, ""Pleas be patient, I only have two speeds, and I don't think you will like the other"", and ""Wife and dog missing: reward for dog"".  There are about 5 tables and a small little bar to sit at, so it's pretty small.  

The food is solid and consistent.  I've never been blown away by anything on the menu, and I've never been disappointed by anything, either.  I usually get the fish tacos, which are grilled rather than fried, and the carne asada tacos.  The tacos are all served on small corn tortillas with cabbage, tomato, onion, cilantro, and cotija cheese.  The fish usually gets overpowered by the other flavors, but the overall flavor of the tacos are good, and the fish is Tilapia so it doesn't have much flavor to begin with.  I like to use a mix of their house green salsa and a little habanero salsa on the tacos, but you have a variety to choose from with all of their hot sauces.  
The Burritos are also pretty good, my favorite being the fish burrito.  They are a pretty good size and are only around 5 bucks.  
The key at a place like this is to enjoy your food with a Mexican beer.  They have a selection of mexican beers that really change the entire meal.  Fish tacos are great and all, but fish tacos with a cerveza is what life is all about!

The service is friendly, courteous, and perfect for a baja style grill.  The guys behind the counter are always very entertaining, as they love talking to the customers about whatever is going on.  You know the place is gonna be good when you notice a lot of regulars walk in talking to the customers.

If you go on a Monday you can get really cheep beer, if you go on Tuesday you get all tacos for a buck, and if you come on fridays you will get a combination of cheep beer and tacos for a buck.",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,1,0,3,2G0A58DYnQptAFd4QVv_6A

It definitely feels like a college town institution-- small, a little rough around the edges and with some cheap beer during happy hours and dirt cheap beer on Monday nights, plus a super friendly Asian owner and staff. The super friendly staff combined with free Twizzlers make it hard not to like the place at least a little. Free WiFi is available too.

Their proclaimed specialty is the fish taco made with a tilapia filet cooked up on a griddle. I saw the cook squirt some squeeze butter on the fish. I wasn't sure if that was odd, but I personally didn't find it too appealing when I witnessed it. In addition to fish tacos, they have steak, chicken, pork and potato. I ordered two fish and one potato.

When the tacos arrived my first impression was, ""Wow, these are small, but attractive."" They are made on approximately 4-inch corn tortillas, which are doubled up, and then topped with lots of fresh greens (either lettuce or cabbage), cilantro, onions and tomatoes. They are served with some salsa. The salsa is relatively bland, but there is a vast selection of hot sauces to spice things up. As for the flavor of the tacos, the fish tacos were good. The potato taco was delicious. A definite special treat for the vegetarians out there.  

I don't think these are the best tacos in Vegas if only for the simple fact that the tortillas are not made fresh in house. Plus, things could have been a little cleaner. For example, the lid of the trash can was covered with gunk and dried remains of other people's combo plates. Icky.

I VERY much enjoyed how these tacos! I tried the Shrimp, Fish, and Potatoe tacos- ALL DELICIOUS but specifically the fish and potatoe tacos. 

The fish taco is made with grilled talapia (not fried or battered like most baja fish tacos). The tacos come with a HUGE load of the basic mix of pico de gallo, cabbage/lettuce, onion, and QUESO fresco which I absolutely LOVE! I mean really, they are loaded. They use the small local brought YELLOW corn tortillas- which held very well!! (The cook would not tell me the brand for some reason :( )

Did I mention a fantasitc array of HOT SAUCES available at the counter to add to the already delicious tacos?? I recommmend using BLUE WARES hot sauce with the shrimp tacos- it's a great taste! 

The cook threw in their own house sauce which had a blended baja flavor- not bad at all! Note: the house sauce is SPICY FOR THE WIMPS and JUST RIGHT FOR THE PROS!! :D

The prices are definitely agreeable, particularly for the specials. A number 1 for example, includes 3 tacos of your choice with a drink for $5.50. The manager informed that Baja's specialty are fish tacos, but alas, I will never enjoy them because I'm a hardcore vegetarian.

I settled instead for 3 potato tacos, which were quite delectable by the way. I was pleased with the presentation but even more so by the taste. Baja's potato tacos are probably the most unique and creative tacos I've ever had. Everything from the corn tortilla to the last bit of cilantro was perfection. I even got to sample a fried oreo for dessert with the Yelp check-in. And of course it was delicious.

I ordered the three taco combo meal, without the beans and rice.  I think it's the #4 if you're ordering the McDonald's way.  The good thing about this deal is that you get to mix and match your tacos.  So I got the shrimp, carne asada, and their famous tilapia.  Served with a soda for $5.99 and it's a great deal for a lighter lunch.  Very delicious tacos loaded with shredded cabbage and sharp Mexican cheese, accompanied some fresh radish, cucumber, and homemade salsa.

The hot sauce bar is pretty cool.  They serve about 50 different bottled hot sauces; I tried about 5 different ones that I thought were crazier looking.  I was hoping the flavor of the crazy looking hot sauce bottles would match their packaging, however each one disappointed.  The homemade salsa served with the tacos is fantastic.  Skip the bottled gimmicky stuff and stick with the sauce they put on the plate for you, just ask for an extra side. 

The grill at the Baja Bar and Grill wasn't the only thing that hasn't been cleaned in a while; the entire restaurant seemed just as dirty.  From the sticky, self-serve soda station covered with trash, to the overly stocked hot sauce buffet where each bottle was filthy and crusty by the 67 other people that used the bottle before you.  This place is kind of a dirty dive.  Did I mention the help yourself, complimentary licorice they offer to everyone?  Just think how many grubby hands dig their way into the tub o' twizzlers, right after they lick their fingers clean from the delicious tacos offered here.  I'm not a germaphobe, but there are a few things I would definitely stay away from at this restaurant.

I was hooked on their chicken quesadilla's when they first opened about a year ago. I probably ate there once or twice a week. 
I've always been a fan of local eats but with the surrounding corporate mexican options in the neighborhood, it can get easily overlooked. 

Now that I'm older and wiser I've explored the rest of their menu, I can still say this is my favorite mexican joint in the area. There potato tacos are unique and to absolutely tasty. They say they're known for their fish taco, but in my opinion, their potato taco has NOTHING on their fish taco. 
They have taco Tuesdays which makes the tacos affordable for the typical college student, AND they have happy hour on their beer. 

Now really, let's think this through here, a local mexican place for dollar tacos and happy hour on beer?! HOW IS A COLLEGE STUDENT TO TURN THIS DEAL DOWN?! Exactly. 

The owner's a laugh and super laid back. I love all the fun signs they use for decoration, it adds to the local feel with tons of character. 

Next time you're at UNLV between classes, you have to check this place out.",NnNdqH3DaleFtQk60UT-og,0,1,5,3rh-2NKJcwefm3lPyfjDWA

I'd passed by many times and was curious about trying it out. While standing a mere 15 feet from the door, I did a quick check on Yelp and it was done, I was definitely going to check it out today (6/9/11.)

Walking inside, you're met by a cute beachy interior. It's laid back, but doesn't feel dirty. I didn't know what to order, and just went with the suggested 3 tacos for $4.99.  I had the chicken, shrimp and fish topped with cabbage and pico de gallo. There's something so fun about eating little corn tortilla tacos, and the ones at Baja are no exception. 

The fish, well, I hate fish, but these, these were really good! (Yeah, I'll order things I think I hate, just to see if I'll like it if it is prepared in a different way.) The shrimp were good (and there is no upcharge!) and the chicken, well, that was the best one. For some reason, the seasoning on the chicken, mixed with the cabbage on top reminded me of the flavors of moo shu and hoisin sauce. 

The owner and chef were very friendly and we chatted while I ate and went over my anatomy & physiology book. It's not often that you find staff that are both cool and interesting to talk with - where it's not forced (I've felt trapped at some restaurants when I've gotten stuck talking with owners.) They're chill and were nice enough to make and serve me a deep fried Oreo, on the house! I'd never had a deep fried Oreo, and I'm one of the few people on earth that can pass on Oreos, but this was good! It tasted like warm cake and I'd suggest giving it a try if you've never eaten one. 

It really surprises me that there weren'ta ton of people eating in here (I came after it had been open 20 minutes so maybe that's why) - the food here is much better than anything on campus (and better than much that's around campus as well!) The next time I'm hankering for some Mexican food, I'm gonna hit up Baja again!",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,1,4,jm-OoGlexYZm_ZI9VF9dxw

This place is great! We have been three times now, and have not been disappointed on any visit! 

Despite arriving 5 minutes to 7 our first visit, the staff said not to rush,they would honor the happy hour special priced tacos when we were ready. I joked with the staff that they boast great fish tacos, and the last great fish tacos that I consumed were just off of the beach in San Felipe, where I watched the fisherman bring the catch in, clean, prep, cook and serve them all with the fish being under an hour old. That was their competition.

WOW! They did not disappoint. The fish was flaky, flavorful and normal sized for soft tacos.

With each visit, we have tried to change our orders up some, to taste more of their wares. This last time, the photo of the nacho plate on the wall caught my attention. Asking what was on the nachos, they listed off all of the ingredients, I made my customization and sat down to watch a basketball game on the TV while the food was being prepared.

Unfortunately, their list of nacho toppings did not include the beans that were included. Picky palette over here, so we asked if we could get another plate, without beans, which we were going to pay for and take the first plate home for the wife to have lunch the following day. They had no part of it. Apologizing for leaving that bit out, they whipped up another plate for me quickly, and made sure they had the order right.

The staff is friendly and inviting, fun to joke around or converse with while enjoying some inexpensive and tasty food!",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,2,0,5,_RFgpaEjMYRhqxpMMqsaew

Reminds me of tacos from tijuana almost. All the tacos are good and so are the burritos. They cook it for you to see and quick too.

The guy at the register the day I walked in (presuming he's the owner but I could be wrong) instantly started up a conversation with me like we were best buddies for years. The entire staff there was talkative and engaging, truly getting to know who you were as a person instead of a standard customer. It made it seem like this was a family owned business of some sort by the service, and I have to say with personalization like that... this place is a neighborhood favorite!

Tried the three tacos for $4.99... great deal! You can mix and match, and they offer you a seasoned corn cob with it. The french fries are amazing (not greasy and actually taste/look like they're real potatoes!), also might I mention the alcohol and the enormous selection of hot sauces to choose from? If you're a fan of spicy, and you want to sample an array of different sauces... this would be the place to check out.

And Thursday the bar is open and got good drink deals perfect since there very little choice in bars close to UNLV.

5902795,2017-03-31,1,jG0m1-899xwYY3IXpTRRCQ,"I probably wouldn't get anything here besides the tacos and beer (and now that I think about it, I'm not sure if they serve anything else).

I think their best tacos are the fish and potato. And despite being ""home of the fish taco,"" don't leave without a potato taco or you'll regret it. Because, in my personal, humble, and amateur opinion, it's the best thing here. And for my non-meat eater homies out there, it's also vegetarian (bless)!

The servings are small, like street tacos, and helllllaaa loaded up. So make sure to order at least three and and pick up a handful of napkins. And a huge plus is that they have a huge selection of hot sauces.

The place is kinda divey. Their service is friendly. And their tacos are good for a decent price. Recommend this place if you're looking for a new place around campus.

It has been newly renovated to expand the front area to include more seating.  I like that there are many different selections of hot sauces for your enjoyment.  That was unique.  The food is good and the prices are awesome!! I went in on a Friday afternoon when there was $1 Fish tacos.  Tacos were delicious. It's the more authentic flour tortilla rounds and comes with an abundant helping of the condiments of onions, cilantro, cheese, lettuce, etc.  I also tried the potato taco which was hearty but really delicious.  For the price and being located near UNLV,  I was surprised not to have to wait for service.  The food is made as you order- but it didn't take that long to get my food and there was not a line. 
I would definitely recommend going there, especially if you need to use the internet as well. There's free wi-fi!! Doesn't get better than that!! They serve some beers as well!!",TXbIl_9ogHdALGlqYl3NvA,0,0,5,c_D5oEZxowHN7vEFk-KBIw
