54603,2010-07-07,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Simon Restaurant has a great setting overlooking the slick Palm's Place pool. I felt like I was in South Beach and forgot that we were in Las Vegas altogether. The decor also lends itself nicely to daytime dining since there are lots of windows letting in the sunlight, but it transforms into a great evening dining spot after dark. 

We went there for appetizers and ordered the truffle Mac & cheese, the fries, the shrimp cocktail and the tuna tartare. We all loved everything we ordered. The presentation was lovely and the service was quick and friendly. I will certainly be going back here soon to try more of the dishes on the menu.

55492,2010-07-08,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"My husband and I dined here on July 1 and were thrilled to see Kerry Simon working in his restaurant that evening.  We had tickets to an event at the Palms and decided upon this restaurant as it offered a menu different than the typical contemporary dishes or steak house fare that we can get at home in Houston. The restaurant was situated next to the pool and featured open, contemporary decor. The upscale atmosphere was toned down by the casual converse-styled footware many of the waitstaff work with their black attire. All of the individuals working the house that evening were very accomodating - from the hostess, the somelier (which we didn't order any wine, but he did stop at our table during our meal to check how we were doing), the waiter, and even the guy who continued to fill our water and tea glasses. We started with some great cocktails (as a southern girl, I could not resist passing up the watermelon/strawberry/kiwi margarita concoction) which were followed by crispy shrimp appetizer. Between courses, Chef Simon came by our table to ensure everything was ok (we were not chatty this time). Our main dishes included meatloaf (sounds odd to order in a nice restaurant, but it was cooked excellently - worthy of ordering again!) with truffled potatoes, and lamb tagine, accompanied with spinach and macaroni & cheese. During our meal, we had inquired of the waiter regarding whether Chef Kerry normally worked in this restaurant and he responded that he split his time between the several restaurants in Las Vegas as well as a location in L.A.  Shortly thereafter, Chef Simon came to our table to chat about where we were from, what we thought about dinner, how we heard about his restaurant, etc. (I sound like a geek, but was so excited to meet him). We had the creme brulee trio for dessert and Chef Kerry sent out a complimentary bowl of cotton candy. Overall, an excellent and memorable dinner!  The only unfortunate thing was that I was so stuffed from all of the food my curiousity left me wondering what the homemade junk food platter ($25 tray with all kinds of homemade goodies - cotton candy, cookies, ding dongs, rice crispy treats, etc.) would have been like. I'll need to find a good excuse to visit again with a larger group just so that we can indulge ourselves!",Kj8M7raqcBd8S22O3nl0WQ,0,0,5,g4gr-sON_UDAk3ferRQbtg

Both were just plain old rude and acted like they were worth a bit more than we were even though they both are middle aged service workers....

Like the poster previous, I have to say that the edamame was the absolute best I have ever eaten, and the bread basket lives up to its reputation. But the entrees were an absolute disaster, as well as the appetizers. 

The calamari was spongy and served inexplicably with a soy dipping sauce that did nothing for the calamari. The pizza on flatbread could have been good but was completely overloaded with competing flavors. 

The meatloaf was very tasty, but there was nothing special about it other than it was exactly what you'd expect from meatloaf. 

All in all, it was the most expensive meal I had in Las Vegas, by at least 50%, and easily the absolute worst.",-cSTMiK3WfMqbfWu3Ji0WA,0,0,1,CMAGa7NuHXaYJAnbR6UFfA

There were very few customers and the bartenders were talking to each other.  One finally came over and said he would be right with us and then proceeded to enter in another order in on the POS system.  I asked him for a menu and he said to hold on one minute.  We opted to borrow the menu from another customer at the bar.  At this point, we decided to just have a glass of wine and then leave.  We tried to get his attention to get our bill, but no luck.

197800,2013-07-28,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"I don't often dine on the strip, or eat in casino restaurants, but my fiance and I enjoy trying new places to eat, and when we found a coupon for this place we decided to go. 

The restaurant and lounge is placed in the other tower of the Palms, away from the casino and other restaurants. It was initially difficult for us to find, but once we found it we enjoyed the laid back, semi-trendy atmosphere of the restaurant. 

When we first arrived we were told that because we didn't have a reservation the only seating available was at the bar. This was a little odd, since only about 20% of the tables had diners at them, but whatever, a table at the bar was fine. 

Overall, the food was fantastic. The spanish octopus was a little bit tough, but the sauce that went with it was amazing. The ahi tuna entree was perfect and my fiance raved about his rigatoni. The only dish that we didn't love was the truffled macaroni- the taste of truffle oil was so over powering we weren't able to finish the dish. Which was disappointing because it looked amazing, and would have been much better minus the truffle oil all together. 

We also got the lemon ricotta cheese cake and chocolate pudding cake for dessert, both of which were excellent. They also offer a cotton candy and junk food platter, which I think is a little gross, and I'm not sure why anyone would order food you can get from a county fair or 7-11 at a nice restaurant, but apparently it is really popular. 

Overall, I had a really nice dining experience. I'm not sure that I would go out of my way to come back, but if I was ever in the Palms again for a movie or something, or if I had guests in town staying at the hotel, I would recommend Simon.",BruI-D395yclzw0Xc1-dAg,0,0,4,_eCrYsnu4tVq8MKAgbFzhg

First, the decor and atmosphere was pretty cool. You're right next to the pool. Anything table is a good table here! Secondly, the food was pretty good. Not too bad. Since I've only been here during the day, the limited lunch menu consisted of the typical light fare...Sushi, various sandwiches, and salads. I had the turkey melt with fries, as some in my group enjoyed the soup and sandwich combo. Lastly, service was great! Enough said, very professional and attentive without being too pushy.   Just what you'd expect from a place like this. 

I have to check out the dinner menu when I get a chance, until then, it seems like a place that serves American classics with a twist!

so me and my wife made a reservation a week before valentines to have a dinner date here in simon's.
when we got there we feel so excited because the place is nice, ambience is good as well.
now the bad part was when were seated they only gave us a valentines special menu and i ask if they have a different menu because i didnt like the choices.
next thing you know they move us to a different table because the other tables are
 ""only for valentine special menu"" (so dumb!)
i do understand that was valentines day but when we reserved a table i never say anything only for that particular event or something. my wife and i was pissed at this place.

so they move us to a different table that took them so long because they said that all tables are full and then i told them, ""i have a reservation here at 7:45pm and you said its full?"" then the server took off and ask manager(manager was not helpful as well)
so the server came back and said ""sorry sir we are really full."" so stupid right? i made a reservation but tables are full? just because we didnt go to the valentines special table and now they wont give us a regular table. ridiculous!! 

server came back and said theres a little spot right next to the pool that we can dine in so we did dine in because my wife and i were hungry already.
food was ok but then very poor service very very poor.

never again going to simon restaurant.
if theres 0 star rating i would give this place double 0.",GD1joprdQiR58z7iijbjpg,0,0,1,FwPKKVNBN0ypcBzHSoWkzw
301951,2012-06-21,2,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"There is no place like Simon at the Palms Place for a fun, trendy, funky and innovative brunch. Everything from the atmosphere - great music, floor-to-ceiling windows with an amazing view of the pool, to the beautiful people who dine and work here makes this establishment second to none. Normally, I would have rated this place 5-stars, but took away one because the service was a bit slow the last 3 times I visited.

I can't say enough about the food.  Simon provides the most extensive menu from the more traditional brunch favorites to the most imaginative. I love the Lobster Brioche and the M&M pancakes!  They also feature a candy bar for dessert with a wide selection of delectable sweets to top off your meal.  Sample Simon's special ""Junk Food Plate"" that comes with homemade snowballs, Rice Krispies treats, homemade Hostess cupcakes, chocolate chip cookies and cotton candy!  It's definitely not for the faint of heart and serious health freaks, but you only live once, right? 

And, what Sunday Brunch wouldn't be complete without beverages!  For an additional charge, you have your choice of ""bottomless"" beer, all-you-can-drink Mimosas or Bellini's, or make-your-own Bloody Mary's.  Need to recover from too much partying the night before?  They've got you covered!  Just roll by the ""Hangover Bar"" where you'll find baskets of Advil, Tums, and Pepto Bismol!",wZ5DKc2uNyI_QrkPaNz6lA,3,2,4,kkuYJhkzBliTo6kYtKP3eA
311591,2014-01-29,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"I made reservations for Simon on Monday night for dinner, since it seems to be the flagship restaurant for Palms Place. We arrived early and went for drinks in the lounge. The female bartender brought a drink menu and never returned. She was at the opposite end of the bar doing squats or something as the other bartender totally had his back to us and was busy chatting her up instead of following up with his patrons. I literally had to walk over to the bar and ask for service as my attempts to capture their attention did not seem to be working. Finally it was time to be seated in the restaurant for our dinner appointment. They seated us by a party of 6, which wasn't bad and seemed kinda spacious. The waiter took our appetizer order of lump crab cakes and then later the main entree order. I had the rib-eye and my guest had the sushi sampler. Our entree beat the appetizer to our table and the guy looked puzzled when I spoke up and said, ""that's a little late, its suppose to be our appetizer"" as we were beginning to eat our main course. He didn't even respond, just looked at me and left it on our table, along with the menus/drink menus that were still in our way. My steak was cooked to order, however it lacked taste and seasoning, as well as the bland mashed potatoes. As we were trying to just make the most of the meal, the other waiters that were servicing the party of 6, felt necessary to keep bumping our table in hast, without an apology or an ""excuse me or I'm sorry"".",Pxrx3kEqVD9WCn7lmV-a7Q,0,0,2,kQUGFhkVZNscWuN61kMJlg

It's very consistent and just comforting, knowing you're going to get good food. So, the fact that this place is in Palm's Place is a little sad - off the Strip and not even in the Palms...the restaurant and the food deserves better.

The restaurant itself is divided into separate parts, and doesn't make for a cohesive space. It's just weird...atmosphere, separation from the bar and kitchen and main dining area...I don't know, it just felt odd and disjointed. The main area itself is beautiful and everything I expected, but that's not where we sat, so... *shrug*

That said, I have to say I was a little disappointed...but left Simon's happy, mostly because of our waitress. There was really no explanation for it, but the kitchen was backed up...food was S.L.O.W. in coming...as were the drinks. From what I could tell, it wasn't that packed, not not other restaurants on the Strip that week.

The food, once we got it, was great. It always is with Kerry Simon's restaurants. There's something to be said about consistency. So, our waitress pretty much made sure we weren't too aware of the delays from the kitchen...and to make up for it, comped us a few drinks as well as dessert.

We started off OK with a tasty amuse bouche, good salad and decent sushi, but our main courses were not very good at all. The sea bass was kind if pathetic with bland, overcooked side items. The fish was under seasoned and skinny with the skin still on top. We were expecting much better. We also had the flatbread which was very average. It was obvious they were trying to get by as cheap as possible with the drinks they included. 

The biggest joke was the junk food platter for dessert ($25 value, yeah right). A bunch of stale, tasteless crap. If you're going to serve something like that, everything needs to be freshly baked and tasty, and none of it was. You could break your teeth on the dry, hard, stale brownies. The cotton candy was actually the best thing on the plate, and I don't like cotton candy.

Perhaps ordering off the regular menu would have been better, but who knows. Beware of the travelzoo voucher. What seems like a good value may not be if they are only including cheap, limited choices. I felt like the service was a little lacking as well, but this may also be due to the fact that we used the travelzoo voucher and were given a ""special"" menu.",r-MHUpMzKUML3F5QjVRGDA,0,0,2,389gHo2IndNVk9dlQA7O7Q

We were totally not expecting how great this place would be. There were some pros and cons, but the food totally made it worth it. 

First of all, we got there around 6:30 on a Monday night and were told that because we didn't have reservations, we would be seated at a high top at the bar. We were a little confused because the restaurant was dead, but shrugged it off and figured it would get busy later. It never did. It remained mostly empty for the next two hours.

We all ordered the pop rocks martini and it was to die for, very unique and not too sweet. We ended up ordering a sushi roll and side each and putting them all in the center of the table, family style, and sampling each others selections. This is definitely the best way to go. We ordered three sushi rolls, which were rather forgettable and I can't even remember their names. But the sides were exceptional. Truffled mac and cheese, tempura Brussels sprouts, and wasabi mashed potatoes. Holy cow. I can't even decide which one was my favorite.

The waitress was very sweet, she even brought us a complementary plate of cotton candy before we left and was kind enough to split the tab. It wasn't even as expensive as I thought it was going to be, another definite plus. Give this place a try if you have the time!",j4eYLQ91PY9S2L4yzZ-EFQ,0,0,4,PR-hmzzfJxJ4H7DmoctbGQ

Try the Bellini here, they are really good and the Sangria's are a little weak.

We started the dinner with salads and I was not impressed at all with the Caesar Salad or the Simon Summer Salad, but there was more to come. It seemed the salad had been sitting for a while before it was served, not fresh at all. The calamari was really good, very crisp and fresh. The highlight of the night was the Tuscan fries and wood roasted  pizza, simply delicious. 

I was not too happy with my entree, I got the red thai curry, it did have a very strong ginger/spicy flavor, too strong for me to handle. The Bamboo Steamed Salmon was really good. 

For the dessert we got ""Junk food platter"" with Simon's signature cotton candy, this comes with some caramel popcorn and a bunch of cookies and pastries. This was totally my favorite part of the entire dinner. I have to admit, I devoured the cotton candy like there is no tomorrow. It did bring the real child out in all of us.

Chef Kerry Simon has outdone himself with this unique Vegas foodie hot spot.  Since I was a fairly regular diner at the Hard Rock Simon, I decided to drop in to his newer updated version at Palms Place.  At first glance, you might think you were in Miami or San Diego upon entering the restaurant.  When they side poolside, they mean poolside.  You literally dine just a few feet away from the modern pool layout at the hotel.  The service was highly attentive, informed, and what I like to call ""on the spot"".  What I mean is the server and busboy were constantly looking at out table or strolling by to make sure we had everything we needed.  I had the Filet, which was delicate and delicious!!! The sushi we had as an appetizer was fresh and well crafted.  The wine list was broad but approachable and had a few rare gems on it as well.  All in all, a very positive and fun experience.

I've only been here for brunch, so I can't speak entirely for the restaurant, but the food is good. It is not amazing, excellent, but good. They have the usual breakfast, but definitely with a more health conscious choice. We ordered the yogurt parfait and the berry smoothie, and they were definitely fresh and tasty.

Calamari w/ ponzu sauce - very good, love the twist on the dipping sauce
Margherita pizza - very good  even the cheese is of high quality
Short Ribs - very good, meat just fell of the bone and melt in your mouth
Steam Salmon - Good - I am not a Salmon eater, but this was good - cooked just right.  Plus I felt like eating healthy that day.
Mac & Cheese - I didn't try it, but hubby ate it forgot to ask him.
Dessert was very cute and creative - a big ball of pink cotton candy and a variety of different mini cakes - our favorite was the dark chocolate muffin and brownie.  Drinks - sangria and a Bellini - both were light and refreshing.  Bonus - for all travelzoo deal they gave us this special appetizers (forgot the name, but it's on their reg. menu) but it was delicious.

Servers were constantly attending to us...so that was great.

So what maybe used to be innovative Asian fusion is now SO tired and bored and there are so many people who do it better.  The one special that looked intriguing: a white truffle polenta (reasonably priced at $20) was sold out--(and really, it's a shame to sell out of white truffles because it makes you look like you're either a cheapskate and didn't want to lay out the money for them, or you don't have the clout to get enough!)  Now to the service: the hostess was warm and friendly and one waiter seemed great, unfortunately I didn't have him but at least he noticed I had no utensils when my main course came, and addressed it (my waiter was nowhere to be found.).  I understand the benefits of casual, understated service, but this is too casual to the point where they don't really seem to care about the food, or you (with the sold exception of the captain who came by several times and each time called me something like 'chief' or 'champ'--now why would anyone thing that would be proper or appreciated?

I love high quality food served lovingly without preservatives, artificial flavors, or by women in hot shorts.  I want to eat food that's real in a place that inspires me.  --That's why every time I fly to Vegas, I eat at Simon.

You could eat healthy at Simon and walk away stuffed.  I'm not a steamed veggies fan, but Simon's vegetable basket is beautiful and divine; steamed vegetables penetrated by the aroma of lemongrass. A vegetable sushi roll was reasonably sized and stuffed with avacado, veggies, and a good hint of shiso.  The curries satisfy, as do the pumpkin soup and pizzas.  Plenty of dishes on the menu for everyone; vegetarians, vegans, meat-eaters, even the gluten-adverse could find food here.  And everything we ordered (over two nights) was delish.

Service was friendly, timely, and helpful.  At a server's suggestion, my friend ordered a blueberry blush martini, and I got my favorite, the brown sugar martini (with a hint of pineapple in it).  Neither were too sweet, just ""Omygod!"" amazing. 

Don't even get me started on the bread basket (which, if not warm, request it to be---they almost always serve it warm).  I've ordered a bread basket to go after eating there.

Finally, you won't have room for dessert, but just eat it anyway.  From the gently glowing orb of cotton candy to the incredible milk shakes or brownies, Simon knows how to turn kiddo comfort foods into delightful desserts for adults.

The ambiance, the food, the service, they're all here at Simon, and it boggles my mind why previous posters couldn't see that when they visited.  Perhaps they'd be happier at Paris Hotel's ""Le Burger Brasserie and Grille.""",_EXWOXFku5rCGD9QmG7YbQ,0,0,5,vAU2qMlBXgquf8rGshJM2A

Meatloaf was yummy and satisfying.  Chicken was fine - not that special.  It was chicken.

Calamari had a major scary fishy taste and was basically inedible.

sushi was good.  

Service pretty much sucked.  

Bread basket was steller.  One could be very happy with just a bowl of soup and a basket of bread.  Oh - and the meatloaf.   


Staff comped a  dessert of a GIANT cloud of peppermint cotton candy for the table.  It was kind of mystifying, but fun in its own way.",x9lBrz8PoZ9y_uqzdi-k6w,2,2,3,7VnIDCcnMB8c75WGXiuT4w

The host sat us at the bar, since our whole party was not yet there. The bartender was very nice, and she comped our birthday shots (which were like 10 of us at the moment). I highly recommend their Pomrock martini (This is a modified pomegranate martini). Once we sat down, our orders were taken promptly. The noise level was quiet when we arrived, and increased a bit as the restaurant became busier. It never became a problem, though.

I did not order much, since I had eaten not that long prior to dinner. But my boyfriend ordered the calamari and a salad. Also, their starter breads are amazing. They offered mini muffins and scones (which were not overwhelmingly sweet). 

I ordered the lobster Miso soup, and my boyfriend ordered the Italian pizza. This was probably the best miso soup I have ever had, but it can also set you back $10 (considering that many restaurants offer regular miso soup for free with your meal). The Italian pizza was ok. It was not bad, but it also didn't truly justify the price. HOWEVER, one of our friends had the filet steaks (which are prime cuts). It was very tender and perfectly prepared, based on the two bites I had. The filet steak price was fairly reasonable for the food quality (as well as considering it was at the Palms Place). In case anyone is a sushi fan, they also have sushi made to order.

For dessert, they brought us a plethora of items! Also, because it was a birthday dinner, they brought us two massive bowls of cotton candy. The dessert trays were amazing. And for anyone who reads my yelps, I am a big fan of dessert. For me... if a venue can offer great dessert... I AM A FAN. From the dessert tray, the cookies were so moist and delicious and the rice krispies were so light. There were other items, but of course we all have to share.

To end dinner, Chef Simon actually came out and introduced himself to us. I had not had that yet at any of the 'high-end' establishments we had gone. I would come back again, and maybe try more than just the Miso soup and pizza.",VizhcyMWWPz3UDXEBeix4w,5,2,4,nKk3F7u9xSLrwABuaHukjw

The bar area is small...not much room to move around.  Upon entering the bar, the sleek modern style of the decor appealed to me.  I liked the fact that there is a gorgeous pool just outside the bar.

As it was, I thought it was a great deal and a wonderful experience. The restaurant is classy, relaxing and bright.  Yes, it opens to a pool, but neither as a swimmer or as a patron, I felt one impacted the other.  Service was first class and the food pretty good.

My husband and daughter had the California rolls. His was baked and came with salmon and a sauce.  He enjoyed it much more than she did; she felt there was too much rice and too little filling.

My other daughter and I had the pizzas.  Her Margheritta was fine, but generic.  It didn't taste as fresh as it should, better, fresher basil would have helped.  My smoked chicken pizza, however, was close to perfection.  The acidity of the goat cheese was balanced by the bitterness of the arugula and the pesto, while the chicken provided substance and the walnuts cruch. Don't miss it.

Simon to say the least was one of the best meals I have had in Vegas so far. The atmosphere was amazing with an earth-friendly vibe, simple flavors and a striking modern design. Kerry Simon did a wonderful job with this place. 

I started out with a lovely Margarita Pizza appetizer, then moved on to a sensational pasta dish which was basic but one of the best I've ever had. The pasta was thick and the sauce was seasoned lightly and matched the overall dish perfectly. I also had to try a side of the signature Mac&Cheese which was with little surprise, absolutely to die for. I ended the meal with one of the most famous deserts in Vegas, the ""Junk Food Platter."" The so called platter was filled with a hostess cupcake, pink snowball, several assorted cookies, chocolate caramel popcorn in a mini to go box, a mini sundae, rice krisipe treat and a giant puff of cotton candy! Such a creative idea. 

I would definitely recommend Simon to anybody in Vegas in search of a great lunch, happy hour or dinner spot.

The other, couldn't find his ass with both hands, not that he didn't seem nice, just a little lacking on the understanding and slow on the uptake.

That is when I decided Sunday brunch at Simon's would be a perfect new experience! I made reservations on Open Table three weeks prior (first time doing so...very easy). We arrived at Simon's right on time for our 12:30 reservation and we were told that it would be a few extra minutes until our table was ready. We didn't mind because we figured its pretty difficult to facilitate reservation times for an all you can eat buffet. After all, we were a party of two and we ended up staying for 2 hours! We finally were sat about ten minutes later by the hostess decked out in a men's dress shirt and high heels (adorable!). It was really crowded and a bit loud. The weather was terrible that day so I would imagine that normally they have the sliding doors wide open and it isn't as loud. 
Our server was pleasant (and wearing PJ's) and showed us the menu we could order off of in addition to the items on the buffet line. She took our  drink order. I decided to get the all you can drink mimosas ($16). I was a little disappointed when she said they were out of Bellini's that day. My fiance ordered the all you can drink bloody marys ($7) from the bloody mary bar. After our drink arrived I went to the buffet and the chef cut a huge plate of mixed fresh, juicy fruit up for me. Very fresh...enough for the two of us and we picked at the fruit plate the entire meal. The chef also made me a fresh fruit smoothie...so delicious! We ordered from the menu the french toast and the chicken and waffles first. Loved the french toast!! It turned out to be my favorite thing we ate that day....so sweet...and encrusted in corn flakes. The waffles were good too and my fiance enjoyed the chicken. My fiance then went up to the panini buffet and had a homemade panini made....good nothing crazy though. We then ordered from the menu the ribs from the ""white trash"" section of the menu...and a margherita pizza (we were there for two hours, OK! its a buffet...you have to pig out!) The pizza was very good. And after all was said and done....our dessert arrived....THE JUNK FOOD PLATTER!! Amazing!!! cotton candy, caramel popcorn, rice krispy treats, cookies, coconut puffs, brownie....yummy!
The whole experience was awesome and we can't for another special occasion to go back. (oh yes...its pricey for breakfast....$38 per person plus drinks) It was worth it!

Manager was present and visible throughout my visit- walked past three of our dishes waiting at the sushi bar for nearly 10 minutes but didn't even glance at them, let alone take them out to our table. Our server was polite when he was around, but twice I had to prompt someone to bring us our dishes that were ready and waiting within our eyesight.

We spent $60 on HH items but most of them were nothing but average: the sushi was bland, rolls were rice-heavy, salmon sashimi was cut paper-thin (for $10) and there was no effort to balance the flavors at all. The chicken flatbread was nicely crispy but basic, the calamari was decent, but the overall quality did not match the restaurant's reputation or prices.

Considering they were thoroughly overstaffed (1:2 employee to customer ratio), the service was dismal.

So good!  And here are a few of the things I loved best:

a) Fruit/smoothie bar, where you can get a bowl of all the fruit you want in the exact proportions you want.
b) Crepe/panini bar, the mere notion of which set my hear aflutter.  They desperately need more varieties, though.  The choices are very limited.
c) A fab sushi chef made excellent veggie rolls, which somehow went really well with the breakfast food.
d) You can order anything you want off the brunch menu, too.  For some in my party, this meant chix and waffles or spare ribs, but for me it meant PERFECT FRENCH TOAST.  Seriously, this frosted-flake French toast might be the best I've ever had, except for maybe my mom's.
d) Drinks are unlimited.  This may make for very tipsy shopping, gambling or go karting, whatever's next on your agenda.
e) They cap it off with dessert.  DESSERT!  After you've eaten your fruit and crepe and French toast, they still bring out dessert!  And you still eat it!

I swear, three days later I'm still full and happy.

It's not cheap - brunch, drink and tip came out to about $70 per person - but it's worth it.

The waiter then goes and talks with a female co worker for ten minutes before coming back to re take out order because he didn't write it down and thought he could remember it...apparently too difficult. So we sit and wait another 15-20 and notice tables around looking irritable and one gets up and leaves.

I am a huge fan of this restaurant, both for the creativity of their food,  their personable service, and finally (and most importantly) their consistency.

I first went to Simon in September 2010 with my wife when were were staying at the Palms Place for our honeymoon. I was depressed at the lack of anything resembling nutrition that we'd had so far, so we thought we'd have a nice meal.

It was an excellent meal, we had great conversation and the cherry on the top was the dessert, absolutely incredible. We left glowing and happy.

The result was us returning for at least 2 meals a day for the remainder of our trip. We found a good thing, so why not experience most of the menu (and try the brunch if you're there on a Sunday).

I love and found many of the dishes interesting and very creative. There was an inventiveness to the flavors that shone through in everything we ate, from meatloaf to braised ribs, and their Sunday brunch.

Fast forward 2 years to last week. I was in town for a bachelor party. We wanted to have one nice meal, so I floated taking a cab over to palms place, reciting my prior experiences. The result was, again, an awesome experience. Our group filled up on Sushi, appetizers and barely had room for mains.

The only thing I could possibly be critical of was that sometimes our drinks took a bit too long to arrive. Frankly that hurt them more than us, as we would have just ordered more drinks...

I also have to give a shout out to their bussing staff. Absolutely awesome. Water always filled, table always clean - I've not experienced better.

Every mission is not without it's distractions however.  On this Sunday morning, that distraction would be the swank and posh Simon restaurant at the Palms.

For around $35, you can get an all you can eat buffet with eggs, comfort food, sushi rolls, paninis, and juice bar.  For about $10 more, you can have all you can drink bloody mary or champagne bevies.

Ok - let's be honest.  The food is just decent... not amazing.  Depending on what you order, sometimes it's disappointing.  (you can break a tooth on the fried chicken for example.)  But you can have a lot of it.  So if you're coming here just for food, maybe you should try something else.  

The service was good however... Our waiter did a great job keeping up with Chris.  That boy can eat... and eat... and eat...  

AND this is a great spot to chillax and people watch on a Sunday.  There's a beautiful pool next to the restaurant that's open to the restaurant guests.  It's not a mob scene like it is at the Hard Rock.  It's mellow.  You can set your unlimited bloody mary drinks down on a piece of furniture inside the pool and cool down from the triple digit heat.

Sadly, though I requested runny eggs, they were cooked through to medium. My colleague made the same request and also got over cooked eggs.

Met a few friends here for dinner last night. Had a 9:45 reservation, but ended up being seated at 10:30. Theo, the General Manager, was very apologetic, but the girl working the front desk had a major attitude problem.

Oh well, the food, ambiance, and service were excellent. We ordered the Edamame and Cucumber rolls as appetizer. The Edamame is out of this world. They wok fry the Edamame and then toss it with some lime and Tagorashi. The Cucumber Rolls were nothing special.

I ordered a thin crust Spinach pizza as an entree, while my friend had the Citrus braised short ribs. That was probably the best thin crust pizza I've had ever. The crust was light and chewy, just the way I like my pizza crust. I don't eat meat, but my friend couldn't stop raving about the Short ribs. 

To compensate for the wait, they brought out a huge bowl of cotton candy and a huge slice of the Banana chocolate pie for us to share. I'm not big on dessert's either, but my friend devoured everything in under 10 minutes. I can definitely see myself dining here again.

1909416,2010-07-13,1,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"We went for Sunday brunch, this place is almost perfect, unfortunately we got stuck with the worst server in the place (we could tell because all the tables around us were getting great service).  The setting is ideal, by the pool at palms place, bright with tons of windows.  We felt like we were in a little oasis away from the strip.

You could tell a lot of original thought went into the sunday brunch as there were a bunch of things I'd never really encountered before at a buffet (candy bar, breakfast pizza, pyjama attire, junk food dessert, white trash menu, fresh smoothie bar etc, etc).  Refreshing these days where every bar tends to copy each other by calling itself some derivation of ""social house"" (same decor, same food, same overpriced food, same, same...give me something unique!)

Anyways I'm getting off topic, but all I really need to say is that the simon Sunday brunch is really worth checking out, it's one of the best food establishments I've been to in Vegas.  Perfect setting, delicious food, and a unique concept.  A bit pricy at $38 per person, but I think worth it.  If you want to take advantage of the deluxe bloody Mary bar or the champagne bar it's extra $.

A couple of my favourites from the meal:
 - simon roll from the sushi bar
 - junk food platter, make sure to use the take-out container from the carmel corn to stock up at the candy bar on the way out.
 - freshly made smoothies, i tried a couple and i liked the berry one the best (the chocolate protein one the least)",Ly34irfwImQRQnCjrucsrQ,1,1,4,0AfMEPcrKEt_VJHUGYf_ew

I'm patient, and I'm willing to look past the minor details most people would complain about. But even with that kind of leniency, all for the sake of food, Simon was still a disappointment.

First, our waitress filled our water glasses with Fiji water without giving us any other options, had the busboy top us off after every sip (which would normally be a good thing), only to later tell us after we asked that it was $9 a bottle (which makes it a bad thing). Second, the entrees were okay. I think our prepartying and the expensive water tricked us into thinking the food was better than it really was. The curries weren't anything spectacular, the meatloaf was meatloaf, and the pasta was okay. Third, when we asked for boxes, our waitress paused for a few seconds while looking at our food and said, ""...sssuuurrreee...""

Even with a less-than-sensational review like this, there were a few plusses: 1, the edamame was the best I've ever had - lightly grilled and seasoned with sea salt and other spices, 2, the calamari turned a standard appetizer into something tastier - the lime, salt and spices made the perfectly fried calamari delicious, and 3, the tiger roll was pretty damn good. But good appetizers don't make a worthy restaurant experience. The ambiance is warm, the design is modern, the view of the outdoor pool is gorgeous and the trip there is a trip in itself.

Simon staff rose above all that and just kept track of that stuff themselves.  Yay!

They had three lunch selections that come with dessert included. I think they guarantee them in 30 minutes, if you are in a rush. I had the bento box ($20), which was a California roll, seaweed salad, and crispy rice spicy tuna (roll? not quite sure what this was).  The dessert that came with it was 3 mochi.  That's a lot of food!  Anyway, the California roll was pretty good.  For being a California roll, it was pretty tasty.  The seaweed salad was also quite good.  The crispy rice spicy tuna thing was lacking.  Really chewy, not a lot of flavor.  I regret even eating it.

I think they also have a lunch combo with some sliders, fries, and dessert... and one other lunch combo.  Their menu online has not been updated.

Ten years ago, I could be found here regularly, so it's a real treat to dine here now. The food is still delicious and the service is outstanding. However, there was a hiccup last night. We had reservations and arrived an hour early to have drinks with friends in the bar. We still had to wait about 45 minutes for our table, which was kind of annoying because like I mentioned, we had reservations AND arrived early. 

The bar area is very classy, with comfortable bar stools and cozy lounge seating (trust me since this was where I spent the majority of my time last night).

The food is outstanding - between all of us we had a little bit of everything (check out my pictures). I accidentally knocked over a bellini (thanks to being relegated to the bar for nearly 2 hours pre-dinner I suppose???) and my server promptly replaced it. He also brought us some spicy tuna on crispy rice to try which was fabulous!

Despite the fact that I've eaten here for years and will continue to do so in the future, I got really sick a few hours after eating here last night (and it wasn't alcohol related).

For brunch - they serve a la cart menu items as well as buffet-style stations with healthy options ranging from wheat grass shots to sushi.

The wait staff dresses in pajamas and they are always delightful to talk with in a post-party hungover state.

When your hangover is slightly cured, be sure to splurge and try their desert tray... they are kinda famous for it. It's an awesome platter of carnival-worthy delights presented with a tower of cotton candy.

As an added bonus, you have access to the adjacent pool lounge until the late afternoon - a great place to chill and relax whilst recovering from your food coma. My rec - take your bottomless mimosa to-go style and soak in some rays by the pool. You'll feel good as new for another night out!

They also bring a dessert to your table that includes cotton candy, brownies, cookies, rice crispie treats, hostess cupcake, and snowballs.  There's also a candy station by the door where you can take candy home - this was great for bringing back ont he flight with us!

We made two attempts to try to eat at this restaurant during our stay at the Palms Place to try to use the $40 credit that was part of our package. The first time we tried to get breakfast and were seated and not acknowledged for sometime so we left. The second time we went down for a late dinner and were told we couldn't be served due to a private party, yet there was another couple seated outside of the bar area. Not sure why Palms Place gives a package with a credit at this restaurant since they don't make you feel welcome to dine there.",2AvkZMjjX-jS3Eyf1r7qjw,0,0,1,pMqmYldl4TjwzeO6dcHdmQ

It's only on Sunday's during brunch, so guess who had Easter Sunday brunch at Simon? Oh yeah, this girl. $49 per person is a steep ticket for bunch. Add $20 if you'd like to partake in the beverages such as mimosas and marys. (Yes you can switch it up) If you have company in town, or want to impress, this meal is totally worth it!
You can come in your pajamas, all the staff will be wearing theirs! Unless you come on Easter, then you have pajamas, bunny tails, and even a good ol rabbit as your server.
So this is how the AYCE works. There is a small buffet with treats, dessert, shrimp, bagels, pastries, fresh smoothies, and juices. 
If you want hot food, it is still AYCE, but ordered through your waiter. Options include, French toast, 3 styles of eggs benedicts, biscuits and gravy, chicken fried chicken, and more. I was very impressed with all of the hot options. The only food that did not stand out was the prime rib. They were only offering it for Easter, (as well as ham) but it was so fatty. Not at all a great cut! 
The bar area worked like this, if you have a wrist band, help yourself. The staff was all super friendly and helpful. I was even brought an extra drink that I did not order when the service got slow. Another perk, they use good vodka. Unlimited Belvedere for $20 makes the expensive breakfast worth it!!

Overall, it is not somewhere I will go every weekend, but I hope this place stays in Vegas because it's a perfect Vegas hangover brunch. Oh and did I mention it has a pool view.

Our server was excellent and had a good sense of humor, and didn't mind sharing her favorites or explaining specials.

Made a reservation an got in with no problem. Decor was eclectic, loved all the windows and how bright it was with natural light coming through. It was kinda chilly out so only a couple brave people in the pool. We were greeted immediately by our server and offered all you can drink mimosas, bellini's or bloody mary's for $17. This is average price and also I think it's well worth it. So I agreed. As I'm drinking my first glass, she then tells me to get the $17 all you can drink you have to get the $40 brunch buffet. Huh? Why? That doesn't make any sense at all. I'm not a all you can eat type I person, I prefer to order one plate and enjoy what I ordered, not over eat on massive amounts of food. So I was a little upset I was being forced into the brunch buffet. 

I ordered the crunchy french toast to share, it was pretty good. I wasn't a fan of ""the fortress"" our server recommended. It was fried Mac n cheese on the bottom loaded with pulled pork, an egg. It was sitting in a pool of grease. Barf. I pretty much stuck with the baguette station, I liked the blu cheese and fig and the pecorino and honey comb, oh an the banana nutella crepe. So I pretty much paid $40 for snacks. 

Well the bellini's were good, and my company was excellent. Overall I enjoyed my brunch, but I wouldn't go back after paying $65. I will stick to DW Bistro or First Food & Bar.

2800370,2015-03-24,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Simon is easily accessible, if you park at the Palms Place Tower (half a block west of the main Palms hotel).  The elevator to the sixth floor is just inside the entrance, and there is valet parking.  My wife and I wanted to try it before it closes it doors (in a couple months), and we found a restaurant that hasn't quite decided what it wants to be when it grows up.  Part poolside cafe, part sports bar, and part gourmet restaurant.  This ambiguity also shows up in the prices, which are not quite what you would pay for Michelin cuisine, but well above what you might have expected when you first walk into the place.  Dinner cost us about $160 (tax and tip included), pumped up by a bill of almost $60 for two rounds of drinks (no wine).

We both decided to order the double burger, since the burger is Kerry Simon's signature dish which he used to win his appearance on Iron Chef.  It was a great burger - much too big for most people to finish.  We each took half a burger home in a doggy bag.  The meat was high quality, and well-prepared on a brioche bun.  The ""Tuscan"" fries were nothing special.  We also split an iceberg wedge salad and a crab cake appetizer.  The salad was very good, with blue cheese and bacon.  The crab cake was nothing special.

The problems were in the details.  The service was, shall we say, conspicuously inconspicuous.  We waited half an hour after our salad was cleared before the burgers arrived.  Our water was served without ice, and never refilled.  The waiter did not come by to offer fresh ground pepper on our salad.  The bread and butter came late, and there was no butter knife for the butter.  Perhaps these small details just reflect the kinds of things that fall apart when a restaurant is preparing to close its doors, but they were mildly annoying.

Made a reservation for 6 on Sunday for brunch with some fun people. When I walked in I was walked to the table my friends we already sitting at. The waiter already had water waiting and some limes and lemons on the table, i wish more place would do that. He offer me other drink options but I just stayed with water. After everyone showed up he went through the menu with us. One side was what the buffet offered which included sushi rolls, paninis, bagels, fruit, shrimp, crepes, and smoothies. The other side was from the kitchen which included pizzas, benedicts, and my favorite the white trash. With brunch you pay 39.50 and get to order from either side. We were a little confused at first but figured out we were not being punked. All of food for 39.50, eat it now!!! So, first we orders some items from the kitchen and then go up and cruised the buffet area. I grab some pineapple, muffins, sushi, and bagels. I also ordered a panini. Headed back to the table with almost a full plate. What have I gotten myself into?!?! The sushi was delicious. My favorite was the crispy rice and avocado roll. They also had other option like spicy tuna, California, and shrimp. I also like the blueberry loaf they had out, it was moist and delicious. The panini i ordered was the honeycomb baguette, it was interesting. i think i should have gone with a crepe. After I demolished the buffet stuff our orders from the kitchen started coming out. My first and favorite dish of the day was the chicken fried chicken. Just like chicken fried steak but it was chicken with gravy and an egg on top. The chicken was deliciously seasoned and just enough. My friend ordered a pizza, it was okay. Not something i would come back for. We also ordered waffles, pancakes, french toast and even some egg Benedict with pulled pork. Everything came out pretty quickly. Near the end we ordered some ribs and they were layered with bbq sauce which was awesome. Then we were finishing up and he brought us COTTON CANDY!!! We demolished the first cup and then had him bring more. He brought 3 more and we were then playing with it and make cotton candy mustaches and even dipping it in our drinks. We had too much fun for brunch. So my recommendation are the crispy rice, chicken fried chicken, and cotton candy. Also, my apologies for no good pictures.

Ordered a ""blueberry blush"" specialty cocktail, it was so tasty, liked it a lot, followed by a grey goose dry martini, I was a little buzzed. Liked the menu, they have a sushi & sashimi menu too.

Mackerel & salmon egg sashimi: very fresh, yummy 

Edamame, wok charred: a little burned outside, but they were still yummy, great to snack on while waiting for our food

Lobster miso soup: very delicious 

Filet Mignon with mushrooms: hubby loved it so much, the sauce was great, the mushrooms were so yummy!

The lounge is a lovely area to sit and relax and catch up with friends.

And the bonus was that it was 1/2 price bottles of wine.

The age old debate is settled once and for all at Simon Restaurant.

I think this was by design, because to get here, you'll traverse two buildings, board two elevators, ride on two very long moving walkways (called sky tubes),  and go through dark twisting-turning hallways before finally locating the place.

You've just championed Darwin's theory; survival of the fittest. 
Because no-one sporting a walker, cataract glasses, oxygen rig, or cane will dare attempt this long and arduous journey for fear of an untimely ending.
Their fate? The first floor lunch buffet.  
And yours? 
Simon.

Well your long walkabout will not go unrewarded my friend, as you find yourself spoiled by the food, service and surroundings of this fine establishment.

The decor and its well appointed interior.
The pool area, showcased through floor to ceiling glass walls. 
Fashionistas everywhere, laughing, sipping colored beverages adorned with little parasols, acting as though nobody in the world matters but them. 
Businessmen, in Armani suits.
And the sun seekers  by the pool, wearing swimsuits fashioned only from a small length of colored thread. 

Then there's the food.
A pre-meal bread basket with pretzel and zucchini bread.
A french dip sandwich so sumptuous, both its imagery and flavor will linger for hours.

It's about this time your wife asks you how you heard about Simon.

I suppose you could lie, explaining how you watched an Iron Chef America episode where Kerry Simon unmercifully beat Cat Cora into submission, but she'd know you  were bullshitting since you only watch shows like Pawn Stars and Hillbilly Handfishin'.
Just tell her the truth for once.

3075692,2010-08-08,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"We went for sunday brunch so here we go:

The Good :  This place overlooks the pool and no one seemed to care if we hung out by the pool after you eat.  For the price of admission you get to eat from 10 to 4, we showed up at 11 so we made a full day out of it.  For 16 bucks you get all you can drink Chandon champaign, mimosas, or billinis.  Needless to say my wife got hammered.  

The Bad : The food wasn't too good, here is the deal, there is a small buffet that serves up some interesting paninis (good), there is a smoothie bar (ehh), sushi (sucked), a few pastries (real small selection but good), and candy (it's candy).  Everything else you order off the menu.  They have pizza (margarita was real good) different benedicts that were ok, and what they call white trash stuff, it was like pigs and blankets and chicken and waffles.  Basically everything came out just ok, soggy waffle and chicken.  The eggs with the benedicts did come out cooked right.  Everyone gets all excited about the lobster benedict but you can't bribe me with a few tiny lumps of over cooked lobster.  Just everything tasted precooked and like it was being kept warm in the back, it probably was.  Oh ya, the biscuits and gravy sucked as well as our service for the most part.  They have simons signature dessert the junk food platter which is cotton candy (awesome) and home made snow balls and hostess cupcakes (the real deal is better for sure) and a crusty brownie and a chocolate chip cookie.  It's a cool idea but doesn't taste that good. 

The Ugly :  Brunch for 2 with one champaign with tip was 115 F&%@ dollars.  We could have went to breakfast and ordered everything we ate off a menu and it would have been less and it would been fresh and would have tasted better.  If it was cheaper we would probably come back because the selection is fun and so is the pool but it was just too pricey, for 115 bucks I want to eat something amazing.  

We ate at simon at the hard rock a few years ago and It wasn't too good and this place didn't change our minds about this chef, sorry.",WANhIVSoD5oIIu2LfKx5Ig,1,1,2,9eopXQNr0pZnM0Nb-uWwAw
3079936,2014-09-07,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Sunday brunch for me, spouse, 7 yr old and 4 yr old. It was affordable in comparison to strip buffets ($39/adult, $12 kid, 6 and under free. $20 for unlimited, mix and match bloodies, mimosas, bellinis, champagne). Relaxed, friendly atmosphere overlooking the pool. Easy parking. Not packed. Kid items- mouse shaped pancake, cheese pizza, popcorn chicken. For adults- order grilled items off the menu (all were ok- better sounding than tasting) I had the pulled pork Benedict (good pork, very light jalapeño in the biscuit, bland hollandaise), and chicken fried chicken (dry chicken, gravy ok). There is a small buffet for fruit, pastries, smoothies, green juice, sushi (salmon, a few small rolls, shrimp) and panninis/lox&bagels/crepes, and a bowl of large peel and eat shrimp. Dessert is a fresh pile of cotton candy. It was fun, affordable compared to the strip, and I loved the easy atmosphere. How to be better? They could have better fruit (for that day it was watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew-grocery variety), a few more sushi selections, and maybe oysters, crab, or shrimp I don't have to peel? And/or a warm,carved meat? I like that it's smaller, but they could stand to fancy up the buffet area a little bit with slightly higher end selections. I'd recommend to go with kids if you're looking for something pleasant and easy off the strip, as a one time fun-to-do, or if meeting friends who mostly want to drink in a not-overwhelming atmosphere. I wouldn't go again if the food is the driver.",ZICFkINn2nKjtr6KlMAzEA,0,0,3,Y3FmyuFqHNsQ__4SLWyO7Q

3136074,2010-11-22,1,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Not impressed!!  Sorry Simon. 

I was staying at the palms place for work which I stay there every week, and decided to go to here and sit at the sushi bar because I was by myself.  The place was pretty dead because it was Wed night and so I was the only one at the sushi bar the entire hour I was there.  

The sushi chef kind of made the whole experience pretty crappy.  He was kind of rude from the beginning and I really don't think he knew what the word nice was.  I asked him what was good at the sushi bar tonight and he told me ""fish"".  No shit Sherlock.  Maybe I should not have asked that but then he just walked away.  So I ordered the spicy yellow tail roll and it came out looking terrible.  the rice was falling off the roll and it was not a good presentation.  When the roll is $13  I was expecting it to look a little nicer.  Especially when he was not too busy.  Strike two.  Then I asked for an order of their special Spicy tuna crispy rice thing.  He first told me straight out ""NO"" because it was too big for one person. I was pretty shocked.  Then I said I could eat it and if I was paying for it who cares.  So he unhappily made me the dish.  The crispy rice was dark brown and super burnt.  It was so hard to eat I finally stopped eating the rice and just ate the tuna.  I wanted to leave so bad.  So he came up to me as I was finishing the fish off the rice and said ""I told you it was too big for you to eat"".   I said no it would have been fine if the rice wasn't burnt.  He said ""That is crispy rice, if you didn't want crispy rice you should not have ordered it""  The fish was not even very fresh which made it worse. 

Now for the one good part of the story.  They took my dish with the super burnt rice and a minute or two later the sushi chef came back up to me and I was ready to fight back this time and he said "" you were right your rice is really burnt, the roll is on the house"".  I was happy about that but I will not be back most likely.  i also had a nice server who gave me my beer.  

Not a great first impression for someone who is going to be a weekly visitor. Oh well.",R14v5Ii-B2mtuv3m1-1lNA,2,0,1,ET0ylbQBuSPneuyWLPB6tw

Service was top notch (Stacey).. and the total bill was half what you'll pay in many other places. Do happy hour from 3 to 6 and the savings improve.

We bought one of those Travel Zoo coupon's (think Groupon) which provided us each with a 4 course meal and a beverage of our choice. We started off with the calamari and ohmagawd was it delicious. My entree was the Thai Curry Chicken which was just ok, but the hubby (whoa!) had the Short Ribs and let me tell you (from a non-meat lover) they were AMAZING! Especially coupled with the truffled Mac & Cheese and lovely dessert sampler to top it all off. All were simply to die for!

The ambiance was just lovely as well, seating us right next to the view of the beautiful (but closed) pool. They had a private dining room with the coolest wall of plants I'd ever seen. Looks like something you'd find in Snoop's place, if you know what I mean.

The service was simply lovely as well. Everyone was incredibly friendly and attentive. Couldn't ask for more!

While many may rave of their famous Sunday brunch, I prefer their more intimate dinner experience. Lunch time is also easy to get in and out if you are limited on time. 

Start things off with their Blue fin Tuna Tartar with sesame rice crisps. For the main course, the Banana Lead Halibut with salsa hits the spot, or the good 'ol meatloaf with mashed potato would make even Mom jealous! 

Of course no meal is complete without an adult libation and their full service bar is fully stocked to create anything you desire....I prefer the Rum & Ginger Tea or the Lemongrass Drop. 

Make sure you save room for dessert including Kerry's ""Big Bowl of Cotton Candy."" A fun dish to share with others. But if you are on the adventurous side, try their ""Junk Food Platter"" that will bring back some great childhood memories.

3174228,2013-05-20,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"I read some other reviews and expected much more.  I would never pay the regular price for the food quality that we got.  This review is for the Travelzoo menu ($99 for two) which still seems a bit overpriced but it did include passes to their clubs, Moon and Ghostbar.

The ambience is on the casual side as it overlooks the pool area.  There is a sushi bar and a regular bar inside.  We started the evening with a peach bellini (that tasted nothing of peach) and a watery sangria.  Bleh.  1 star for the drinks.

Our amuse bouche was a crispy sushi rice.  It was not crispy, but rather chewy. The rice was too heavy; it was not well executed. 2 stars. I'm starting to see why this place is not crowded.

Appetizers of spicy tuna roll and Caesar salad were ok...nothing special, dressing was a bit heavy on the salt. 2 stars.

Hubby's Chicken Curry was decent, a little spicy and fruity with the pineapple chutney. I had the pan-roasted sea bass. While the fish itself was cooked nicely, it was presented skin on top which was not crispy at all. It was a poor attempt at pan roasting as the skin was soft and chewy.  It would have been better if they left it off. 2.5 stars.

Mac n cheese gratin was a good sized portion to share but unfortunately, neither of us wanted to eat it. I like my mac n cheese to be creamy and cheesy and this one was disappointingly floury tasting. 2 stars.

Dessert!  Everyone raves about the Junk Food Platter.  It's a great idea but the food was just ok.  I'd say it looks better than it tasted...basically sugar, sugar and more sugar!  The butterscotch thing tasted like sugar, the cookie looked good but tasted like a Chips Ahoy cookie, caramel corn was ok and the Rice Krispy treat could have come out of a foil pouch from Kellogg's.  I did not get around to the snoball or the brownie as everything was so sickenly sweet. 2 stars.

The service was definitely slow.  When my sushi appetizer was brought out, there was no soy and no chopsticks to go with it.  Sure there was wasabi and ginger on my plate but this is not finger food...it took a few minutes just to get the items that should have been brought earlier or at the same time.  Also, I ordered another drink after appetizers and it did not show up until I was nearly done with my dinner. However, the waiter was very nice overall, apologized and did not charge me for forgetting about it, so 3 stars for him.

I have to say that everything was presented nicely, so if you care what it looks like more than how it tastes, you will love it.  For me, I would prefer delicious food over artful presentation. With so many great Las Vegas restaurants to choose from, I would skip this place.",kQVJxXCCFyhSOh_-ow8TGw,0,0,2,1dmrNGToX-Vz-XA_1tn2uw
3191985,2010-07-18,1,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"I had the pleasure of eating at Simon's twice during my Palms Place stay. Consistent with the rest of the Palms Place property, the atmosphere is ultra-modern hip. Bonus are the views of the pool, which depending on the time of day is entertainment in itself (lunch and a show)!!!!

My first experience was for breakfast as they opened at 8am, which meant very few others were in the restaurant (but we were still on East Coast time). I ordered three egg whites with chicken sausage and hash browns. Everything was exceptional: the eggs were fluffy, sausage (and bacon - I stole some of my husband's) was fab, and hash browns actually tasted like potatoes and were not weighed down by cooking oil which is the usual MO. Great coffee and cool music, accompanied by floor-to ceiling glass windows, couldn't ask for better. I must admit that the coffee was heavy-handed in terms of price: at 6$ a carafe, two carafes were as much as one entree. Come on, guys, it's just freakin' joe!!!

Sushi at Simon later that day was amazing. They have a limited menu in the early afternoon, but the sushi choices are extensive. A starter of zucchini and pretzel bread served with butter was a little odd, but both were yummy. The spicy tuna, yellowfin and salmon skin rolls were all fresh and delicious. 

A bonus of dining at Simon after 9am, esp. during lunch and after, is the view of the pool crowd. If you're into people-watching, this is a total destination. There was a melange of g-string clad beauties, middle-aged dudes in straw cowboy hats wearing banana hammocks, muscle guys, and vegas partiers of both genders having fun to pounding club music courtesy of their own DJ.",FhtE0K-iqMoeQlm0OEcmQA,1,1,4,b-fSUyOn0bByQeTJDJgFUg

The Tacos were by far our favorite of the dishes we tried. Filled with ahi poke, lemongrass, yuzu, avocado in a wonton crisp you couldn't possibly dislike this dish.

They have food with a little bit of an Asian flair, they have a sushi bar with an authentic looking Sushi Chef working behind.  Our meal came with a sampling one-bite of some tuna sushi and BOY OH BOY that was damn good.  If I am ever in the area, I will probably go back that way to have more of their sushi!  There were a few tables there who were ordering sushi. 

Our package from Travelzoo (for each couple) came with yummy bread!, two appetizers, two amuse bouche, two entrees, one side dish, and one yunk food dessert platter.  

Dessert!! When the dessert came out, I had asked the waiter if everything was homemade and he said yes.  How awesome!! The junk food platter is designed to look like imitation hostess desserts!!!  There was the pink snoball, hostess cupcake, cookies, and a gigantic thing of homespun cotton candy.  So good, it made my mouth happy ;)

The staff and hosts are very well mannered and friendly.  Customer service is top-notch and what is expected in Vegas.  
My date and I attempted to try as much variety as possible and this was possible because the portions are small which is perfect for this.  The presentation is excellent with each dish that is made to order like the french toast or the 5 varieties of eggs benedict. I could only down 3 of five and all were delish.

3517289,2014-05-25,6,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"I don't have many regrets in life, but eating brunch at Simon is one of them. It was quite possibly one of the biggest wastes of money I've ever spent at a restaurant. Mediocre food along with mediocre service made for a poor dining experience at a place know for brunch. It's a combination of buffet style, where you get your own food at a buffet line, and butler style, where you place an order with your server and they bring the order to you.

The Easter brunch I went to consisted of average paninis, sushi that was the equivalent of that found at the local grocery store, bruschetta, crepes, pastries and cereal.

Of the higher-end items served butler style, the french toast with its crispy exterior was the best. Less than stellar items included the lobster havarti benedict that was sorely lacking any lobster. I saw a couple specs of crustacean between the bread base of the benedict. Continuing the disappointment were the dry ribs and even dryer jalapeno cornbread. The kid's pancake was dense and had an almost rubbery texture. Ham and roast beef was also available and as good as any you'd find at a $8.99 buffet downtown. Desserts were lackluster and even someone like me who craves sweets, couldn't stomach more than a couple bites.

When you get the right server or bartender it's a really good experience, when you don't it can be a bit disappointing. Menu is well designed but cooking can be very inconsistent. So basically when this place is good, it's very good but without a manager present the quality varies wildly. So be cool and be prepared to send stuff back, the staff won't mind and you'll eventually get a great meal.

3586950,2013-08-14,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"I attended a birthday brunch on Sunday.  It's been a year since I had been and honestly I think 1 star is being generous at this point.  I would say the food is at a 4 now and that is because they dropped the popular desserts off the menu and only have the cotton candy.  Gone is the junk food dessert platter.  They still have items on the buffet portion but none really stood out to me.

The ribs and the apple cinnamon pancakes off the menu were amazing just like last year. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the horrid service we received.  So bad that we asked to speak to a manager when the bill came.  I understand we were a large party and so gratuity was already added which I guess to our main waiter, Kenny, meant that he didn't have to earn it.  Orders were slow, drinks were slow, utensils were slow.  Someone in our party waited 20 minutes for a fork.  Toward the end one of the birthday host found the alcohol and took over serving duties.  It was deja vu from last year.  

Managers excuse was they were short staffed.  I don't want to hear excuses.  Kenny should have mentioned that when we first seated.  He could have left pitchers of water, tea, extra utensils on the table to alleviate his burden.  Last year the server left the champagne bucket and we served ourselves.  

FINAL WARNING:  PAY WITH CASH or Simons will hijack your bank account.  It has now been four days and they still have a hold on my account for a bottomless brunch I didn't order for $77.  It's not necessarily the amount but the principle.  I was also charged $51 for the alcohol free brunch which is what was my bill should have been.   I called and talked to the manager and he said it happens pretty frequently.  I understand holds but charging me for an entire meal I didn't order is out of line.

Patrick and Simon was nice enough to offer the sweet treats on the house.

Partick. I just can't stop talking about his service. He was so sweet and hospitable also checking back to make sure were ok.

3.5*  Simon is one of the winner of Diners' Choice Award on OpenTable by which I make the dinner reservation. On a recent buddy trip to Vegas, I decided to bring my friend Juan to Simon. Saturday evening at 6:30 the restaurant is beautifully lit by the lights of the pool outside. It's located on the 5th floor terrace of Palms Place. Surprisingly, the hostess led us to a table for four tugged away at the corner of the restaurant, overlooking the wrap-around pool through floor-to-ceiling plate glass. We could sit side by side to enjoy the view.

Since we've been drinking cocktails earlier in the afternoon, we did not order any alcohol. Our server was very courteous and friendly, making suggestions and frequently checking on us during the meal. We enjoyed:

Shisito Peppers withpozu sauce
Organic Rotisserie Chicken with black rice, farro, beet greens, black currants, pine nuts
Grilled pork chop with candied Brussels sprout tempura

Simon gives you generous portions. We didn't finish the shisito peppers, who came in a 8 oz bowl. They were tasty but spicy. Both the chicken and pork chop were delicious, but nothing special. The candied Brussels sprouts were a tad greasy but they were perfect comfort food. Pork chop was not cooked all the way through and was tender.

They had a nice sashimi and sushi bar, except it didn't to me that Simon is a destination for Japanese cuisine so I never tried.  

This is a slick place, with nice atmosphere and friendly staff. I would come back to try their famous Sunday brunch and explore some of their fish entrees on the dinner menu, which include branzino, cod and trout.",Zy_Rw00SjE47uhv-WuHTDw,0,0,3,dCzeIp1d3ITpSl8plMxvMw

3798723,2013-06-10,2,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Have I ever mentioned how much I adore brunch? I love brunch. I love leisurely weekend mornings where it's socially acceptable to drink alcohol and stuff your face full of delicious rich foods and then sleep it all off afterwards. Simon offers up one of these brunches--the kind that you feel like you need to go on a juice cleanse after...and lucky for you, they offer juice-cleanse level juice. 

Simon 's brunch is a strange one, but it is delicious all the same. It is a mixture of buffet style and all you can eat small plates, which makes it a somewhat confusing experience. They could probably do away with the buffet-style portion and just do the small plates and make it easier, but then you wouldn't get the experience of watching crepes be assembled. (Assembled is the right word here--there is no crepe griddle or any real options for them other than the one Nutella/banana one. Still good, I mean, it has got Nutella, but it's not prime crepe time.)

Standouts on the menu include the biscuit and gravy, French toast, blue cheese/fig crostini, pizzas, and cotton candy. The egg dishes leave a bit to desire--it's much more a sweet brunch than a savory one.

The pajamas are cute, but I have to wonder if this is the last endorsement deal that Paul Frank ever got. I liked that monkey as much as anyone--15 years ago in middle school.

I'm also giving them the benefit of the doubt about a few things I put into the review based on talking to others. I removed the comments about location, also talking to others and this is all relative. I wish I could bring it up to a 3, but the service and food wasn't very good for what we expected.

We had reservations, made a week in advance--but it didn't seem necessary. We finally were taken to a table near the fireplace, and behind us, a larger table of about ten were seated around the same time. This table becomes a problem when my chair is hit and banged repeatedly by the person directly behind me. We finally stood and moved our own table.  One of the waiters said he saw this happening when we told him we moved our table! Is this really a world class chef owning this restaurant that wouldn't see the situation and handle it? We watch too many Food Network shows. Our exceptions are just too high!  The service was horrible from the time we sat down, until we left. We had three waiters come to our table, making it confusing as to who was our waiter. We told the one who took our dinner order that we had a show to make, but this made no difference to his attending to us. We were very specific about how we wanted our hamburgers cooked. ""Medium,"" and he assured us this would not be over or under cooked. If you look a my picture (if I can get it up), you'll see a charred and ""dry"" hamburger, which took WAY too long to arrive. We must have waited an hour to get our dinner. They were NOT busy at all, but the wait staff was so annoying, running up and down, back and forth like a bunch of lunatics, just so disruptive! The experience was just terrible.  I've no idea who they were helping in such a froth, because it wasn't us! Our waiter, had his butt glued to one particular table as if it was the Queen of England's! Meanwhile, he totally ignored us. When our burgers finally came, we both said we'd rather have an In and Out Burger! TALK about ""not sustainable food."" It was a ""double"" and way too big for anyone to finish! What a waste of a cow's life! Our waiter should have advised us to share this! But beyond the size, it was charred, dry and just awful. But we were on a time frame and were forced to accept it...but, our waiter NEVER came back to even ask how it was! He as too damn busy with some cotton candy show at the table he was marrying. Really? Then, another waiter came over to tell us that another guest was a guitar player in the Ringo show that night (by the way, he was Bruce Springsteen's guitar player and only played on one song), but the waiter had no right to infringe on that man's privacy and tell us who he was. It did explain why people kept coming over and annoying him, and us, since they were crowding out our table! This wait staff needs to stop all this running around, and noise! OMG, the chattering and cackling! AND pay attention to the diners. Obviously they didn't know I Yelp!  It was so over priced and just one of the worse experiences we've ever had in Vegas (or anywhere,) but then again, we dine in Laguna Beach, and outstanding restaurants like Nick's. AND that takes us to later on that night. I have never been so sick! Doubled over, coming from both ends!! I kid you not! I have a half of mind to contact them and demand a refund!

Lamb tagine on couscous was outstanding.  Wonderful Middle Eastern fragrances emanated from my plate as it arrived.  The lamb was tender and the couscous the best I've ever had.  My dining companions each had flatbreads (spinach with boursin and a beef carpaccio) which were only about $13-15 and tasted great.  I would go back just for the latter of the two.

The service, however, was definitely below par.  The greeters at the front desk seemed a bit out of place (new?  amateurs?).  Out waitress (let me mention Jessica again) must have believed us to be poor tippers.  This turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy as we all tipped less than 15% for her somewhat brusque, rushed and impersonal service.

I started with an order of calamari that came with a ponzu based sauce that also came with shishito peppers $9.  The calamari was a little on the chewy side but had a nice flavor on its own, the sauce however was a bit thick and very over powering to the palate. The peppers were nice though.

My boss had a Caesar salad $12, which he thought was very nice.
My boss ordered the Ribeye ""filet"" with tempura shishito peppers, ponzu sauce $42 I ordered the dry aged New York Strip with fingerling potato coins (like 5 little slices) $39. Sides here are ordered separately and since we already had appetizer and salad, we opted for just the steaks.

Both steaks I feel had the same problem, the very thick Ribeye ""filet"" and the New York were pretty cooked on one side less on the other and over seasoned to the point my taste buds were getting that salty burning feeling. Not to mention I would cut off most of the over seared side. They came with a béarnaise sauce and demi-glace sauce, which were both very nice.

The server was initially there to take orders fast etc., the water server was always Johnny on the spot, but then the server was ghost. I noted that when the assistants would bring out food they would mess up a lot on the seating and who gets what as it happened to us (I know this from working in restaurants myself). In the end, we had to wait about 15 minutes to ask for our bill and wait for him to bring the actual bill.

The place was beautiful but the atmosphere was very loud. I think this 
is due to the architecture.

I have to give big negatives on the service and more on the food.

3873003,2009-02-22,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"""Sunday Brunch"" review:

So after reading some articles about the brunch here, had to try it.... and try it we did.  Make reservations, pajamis are the attire...

While waiting to be seated, head over to the bar and get the all you can drink bloody mary buffet bar.  It has a full array of pickled veggies, pepperoncinis (a must), a dozen hot sauces, beef jerky?, wasabi, horseradish, celery salt, few jars of idunnowutitis, and of course full length celery stalks.  For $7, it's a deal....I could only put down 3 cuz my belly was gonna pop from all the foood.

Here's the low down on the food:

Chicken n waaaffles- chik was ok, but the waffles....yummmm, light, crispy, tasty w/ whipped butter slathered all over n maple syrup

Biskits n gravy- ooooooh, arteries were cloggin while eatin, gravy was soooooo good n tasty, I ate half a biskit n all the gravy like it was crack cocaine....I was gonna lick the plate, but didn't go there....

BBQ ribs- not badd, not great either, coleslaw was yawwwwwwn.... my ribs are better and my coleslaw too.....veered off track here with ribs

If you see a pattern here it's cuz the above items are from the ""white trash"" section o the menu....

Peel n eat shrimp- these were BIG, no skimping here, marinated in onions, celery, seasonins with a cocktail/remulade sauce w/ a kick, I'd have to say one o the better chilled shrimp/prawn i've had, ate 2 platters o these..... couldn't stop

Sushi-  the crispy sesame thingys that everybody talks about were a let down, too hard/crispy....maybe a bad batch but I didn't have room in my belly to retry... hamachi was the best, spicy tuna was good, sake ok.  but i didn't come for the sushi

Eggs benedict-  not my favorite, but it was good....the hash browns on the side...WOW! the BEST hb i ever tasted?  It was sooo tasty n crunchy n tasty... i waant some now...

Smoked salmon w/ capers n cream cheese n bagel-  well.... Smoked salmon w/ capers n cream cheese n bagel

Pigs in a blanket- lil dawgs wrapped in flaky pastry, like a dozen o them dawggies w/ ketchup n spicy mustard, could not finish....gettin stuffed

Fruit smoothies-  oh soo good with i can't remember how many berries, i had 2 myself, but they say ""you are what u eat"" so i try not to consume too much ""fruity"" or 'nutty"" items

Simon French toast-  the ""STAR"" of the menu.... I'm not a sweets guy but this could convert me... Frosted Flakes crusted brioche? Yes, it was delicioso... soft n crunchy, sweet n tasty, it was the ying n yang of the breakfast world....

and there is still more on the menu, just could not eat anymore.... breakfast pizzas, panninis', custom omelets, yaddayadddaaaaa....

For $38, it's a great experience.... nice setting overlooking the pool, fireplace (must be nice in the summer) brunch poolside would be kool, staff is attentive in PJ's, lots of patrons in PJ's too, some in lingerie, i didn't see that on the menu....he he he

So give it a try.....have not had dinner yet but the Brunch is definitely a winner.... so if Brunch is between Breakfast and Lunch, what is between Lunch and Dinner?  Is it Linner?  Lunner?  Luncher?

til next time, good Brunching.....",erdvrYG2b-YkTfZljgrXIg,0,0,5,FJXs1yraTBXX60JpdG66hg

Great view of a spectacular pool that is closed at 5pm and is visible from almost every table. Started with a Moscow Mule drink and a complimentary trio basket of bread. Normally I do an appetizer, but was in a bit of a time crunch with a show to go to. Moved onto ordering dinner. Ordered the meatloaf with wild barley risotto. The meatloaf was in the shape of two hockey pucks. The BBQ sauce had great flavor, but the meatloaf itself was bland. Really enjoyed the risotto. Also ordered the truffle oil mac n cheese and the braised short ribs with grits. Mac n cheese was so delicious! I found myself scraping the bowl for a last bite. The braised short ribs was a good sized portion of meat and very tender. The grits was a bit on the bland side, but I used the sauce from the short ribs for flavor.

Egg White Fritata was filling and tasty.

Belgian Waffle with Blueberry Compote was sufficiently fluffy and crunchy on the outside.

I now find my self going there often for drinks because of the poolside ambiance and then going elsewhere to dine.

The brunch is divided into two parts--a regular bar area where you can take an assortment of rolls and other sweets, treats like fruit flavored crispy treats and large peel and eat shrimp from a large tub.  In addition, you can have a panini or crepe made and there are other goodies there, too.  The other choice is to order items off the menu that is part of Sunday brunch.

I first got some treats off the regular buffet like spread, basically junk food--well let's say, food with lots of sweetness.  The winner here was the cake pop.  That was quite good.

I had several items from the order menu.  The lobster havarti Benedict was great and the Simon French toast made from dipping the brioche into frosted flakes was quite good, too.

The winner today though was a small baguette sandwich made with fig jam and bleu cheese.  With the baguette put on the panini maker, the cheese melted and the fig and cheese together was the best thing I had.

Service was OK.  I had two different servers.  Coffee was not refilled until I asked and at one point I had three dirty dishes on the side of my two top high table.

The food was amazing from the wok chard edamame to the calamari with ponzu sauce to the pasta to the curry chicken to dessert which included cookies, brownies, and cotton candy. Except for the Meatloaf. It was a bit dry, lacked taste and the bbq sauce on top was too much. The mashed potatoes melted in your mouth but I think the show stopper was the dessert! I think everyone's eyes were bigger than our tummies. Of course the kids enjoyed it! I'm giving the Simon, on this review, only a 4 star. The chefs forgot to send us the fries which were on our menu.

The decor was very modern, and the restaurant was pretty empty for a 730pm dinner reservation on a busy weekend, but I enjoyed our relaxing dinner despite the hectic strip.

The menu was pretty confusing - sushi, fusion food, pizzas, seafood, American. Everything seemed to be somewhat Asian inspired, except the pizzas.  We got a little bit of everything: calamari, Margarita pizza, crispy creamy shrimp, cucumber sushi, cotton candy and creme brulee and a bunch more dishes (I didn't eat all of them, so I can't recall all of them). My favorite was the crispy creamy shrimp, which is funny since I don't eat a ton of seafood. It was a great app to share with friends. The food came out in a timely manner, and the staff was friendly. It was pretty pricey, and the food was good but nothing too exciting that I would definitely want to come back here again.

He is an exceptional Chef that isn't in the limelight like so many who do not have his skill set in the kitchen.  Having met him I can tell you that he is a very classy man who is calm and very warm to everyone.

So knowing who he is of course I had to bring the girls to Simon's for dinner who ALSO fell in love with his food.  Simon's is an elegant and understated restaurant with a view onto the pool of the Palm's Place.  There is a serenity here that makes the amazing food that much better to enjoy.

Staff is EXCELLENT, decor oh yes and the food, OMG the food is sooooo good.  Menu can change, my two favorites are the Rock Shrimp off of the appetizer menu and the Truffle Mac n Cheese with Lobster.  DAMN this is good.

There is a sushi menu and on Sundays they have Pajama Brunch so much food to choose from.  There is also a beautiful bar area that you can sit have a drink and a quick bite if you didn't want to do the whole dinner.

I had the steak and potato hash.  Extremely different than what I expected!  But it was wonderful!  2 poached eggs over steak and potato cubes.  There was this amazing sauce drizzled over the eggs.  It was served in a bowl and I ate it with a spoon.  Very delicious!  All the flavors worked well together.  My husband had the French toast, which is crusted in Frosted Flakes and served with warm Maple Syrup!  WOW!  Thankfully, he is a very sweet man and saved me a bite!

as for the food, there's the serve yourself bar with seafood, baked goods, cereal, smoothie station, etc.. as well as a menu you can order individual items off of- i only tried the french toast and lobster brioche benedict, and both were pretty top notch (of course i was a few drinks in on top of a pretty proper hangover).

OK so - I totally love Simon for Sunday brunch for a couple of reasons.

#1 - Awesome alcohol options! I don't even drink that much these days, BUT, when I do, these are great options. Their Bloody Mary bar is second to NONE! You simply pay $10 - $15 and are handed a huge glass with ice & vodka in it. I'd say there about 50-75 different kinds of hot sauces to choose from. They even have Slim Jim sticks!

If Bloody Marys aren't your thing, then simply choose the champagne option for about the same price. Hidden bonus? You can go hang out by the pool ALL DAY and keep drinking!

#2 - Brunch - their brunch options are fabulous and pretty healthy for your typical brunch. Lots of different things to choose from - everything from bagels & lox to wheatgrass smoothies. 

#3 - Brunch ""Dessert"" - if you ask your server, they'll bring you the most awesome candy dessert, which includes cotton candy!

#4 - The pool - yeah most people don't think of this but you get access to the pool area with brunch. So come, stay all afternoon and relax!

Throughout the night we found it odd that there were many empty tables in the restaurant yet they couldn't move us to a later reservation w/out an extra 45mins wait...
The service started out great, we ordered a few drinks before we put in our food order. They were served in a fair amount of time, we were not in a hurry or it could have been considered slow bar service. 
The server was very friendly, which was the only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1.
We had a 4 course meal which they managed to screw up. They forgot to bring us one of our appetizers. Ok, mistakes happen, we let it go. 
Main course came out and it tasted good, fresh. But we waited an eternity for desert. From when we finished our main platter it took about 20 mins for desert to be brought out. There was a table next to us that had the same problem, they waited even a bit longer from what we noticed.

4451610,2014-02-19,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"My husband and I ended up at Simon on Valentine's night 2014. I was attempting to get us to Max Brenner at Ceasers's Palace, but traffic was horrendous and we missed our reservation. Probably my fault considering I didn't take into account getting off on Flamingo would be such a cluster-F. Which then we ended up trying to back-track by getting off on Tropicana, and dun dun dun.... so the story goes of the local girl who doesn't realize just how horrible the Strip can be on a holiday weekend. Lesson learned.

So I said what the heck, there's The Palms, let's just try to eat somewhere there. We arrived at Simon after I called and asked what their dress code was, since my husband was dressed in jeans and nice tennis shoes. Biz casual. Good to go. We sat at the bar, because we were the couple without reservations on V-Day. 

I was in a not-so-great mood, but the yummy drink with Pop-Rocks the bartender made me feel better! My husband opted for Fat Tire. We dined on their ""special"" menu for that night. We ordered an app of grilled spicy edamame, very good, with a very distinct spice and lime flavoring. We both got the filet mignon ($38 - and well worth it!), medium rare, with mushrooms, comes with a wine reduction sauce and something like a garlic aioli. The filet was great, tender, and melt-in-your-mouth. We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes to share. Yikes. They were SO SALTY. I couldn't even stomach them.

Service was so-so, the bar was full, but I was left without a drink on more than one occasion and my husband too. 

Overall, bar service and food were 4 stars. I wouldn't go with a 5 because of the offending salty mashed potatoes.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,4,g7rDCK7N-RNQ-xl7hTMkIA
4457038,2013-07-28,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"I have totally mixed feelings about Simon's. My husband and I usually spend about a month in Vegas for work each year, so we get to try a lot of different restaurants! A coworker recommended Simon so we went. 

Foodwise, it was really delicious. We ordered a bunch of appetizers - the edamame was the best I have ever had anywhere! - and drinks and had a really enjoyable evening. Our server was also wonderful.

My problem with Simon is that the restaurant needs updating badly. First, it overlooks the Palms Place pool which is small and quite ugly - the lawn chairs are stained and just look so dirty. Also, we were first seated at a booth which had huge rips in the seams and the stuffing was coming out. In Vegas, especially when you are situated among the best restaurants in the world, ambiance and decor are a big part of the experience and equally as important as the food. I just don't see how a restaurant can justify not fixing issues such as seating which is falling apart.  It really grossed me out.",ogNeqLkzGAbYfRkCiyQaPQ,0,0,3,2Er9f12dvpJck1ZLvfPy4Q

4478149,2014-04-14,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Went for Sunday brunch, I must point out that this was my breakfast companions choice, as I preferred the tried and true border grille.
In any case, have heard good things about this place so was open to try.

It was a nice, well lit dining area, and we were seated promptly.
the layout looked ok, so we opted for their breakfast ""buffet"" at 40/each

I have to say that the menu items sounded like a great way to start the day, but I think that is where it ended....unfortunately.

we placed a ""kitchen"" order for the huervos rancheros, white trash fried chicken, and their signature frosted flake French toast....

in the meantime, we went to the counter to start with a grilled ham/cheese Panini and a bleu cheese/fig baguette......YUCK, would have been happier with a cold bologna sandwich. The baguette was just so-so, but the Panini on pretzel bread....horrible

strike 1.....

got a couple items from the sweet section, including what appeared to be a pistachio macaroon, some caramel corn in a Chinese take out box, and the waiter brought us some pink cotton candy.  The candy corn was at least edible, but the green macaroon was actually mint flavor???? what an awful mouthful that was.  The cotton candy looked nice, but was not good in the least, so we left it as table décor....

strike 2....

kitchen items arrived, we were looking forward to having something to eat....
the item of the day, the huervos rancheros was pretty bland, almost as if the cook had used no seasoning at all....basically very mild salsa on top of a crispy corn tortilla with an overdone egg on top....bit of black beans and pork sprinkled on plate too....should have passed on this.....
have to at least say the chicken was edible, and had some flavor. presented with an egg on top which was nice, and some spicy sauce on bottom
the French toast came out on the cold side, so maybe that would explain the bland texture and taste? was a bit overdone too....I prefer mine a lighter shade of brown and not the color of my coffee.....

strike 3

......well that is 3 strikes, and we did decide to suffer a bit more and at least try a crepe....bad decision. we had the grilled vegetable and swiss cheese one, and watched as the cook took a crepe off a stack of premade ones and threw on induction pan to heat up, throwing the vegetables and cheese on top to warm.
AWFUL....for the price we paid, would it really have been out of line to expect them to make a crepe to order???? it's not the hardest thing to do now

strike 4????

so aside from the 1 edible kitchen dish (chicken) and the candy corn, we both did enjoy their coffee. the orange juice was good too, although it was so busy (HAHA) that we had to ask the waiter more than once for 1 simple glass

One other thing that bothered me more than my companion was the fact that the waiter seemed to not really give a sh*t at all. My friend is a server at another venue and says it wasn't his fault the food was so bad which I do understand. but when he picks up every plate and it is very apparent we did not eat anything at all, an apology or something would have been nice...to show he at least cared?
well I guess you can only take negative comments so long before you become numb to the job.....

I hope they take these comments to heart and try to implement some changes.  It is pretty hard to justify those prices for a simple brunch menu with low quality. The setting and atmosphere made me want to like this place, but the food and service makes a return visit so NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!",XnI-AHs6Sf323o913vXObg,1,0,1,lfCjTWY_4Gk3J0jMj0stiw
4491479,2011-08-28,1,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Let me start by saying I used to like this place. I've been eating at Simon a couple times a year since it was at the Hard Rock. Secondly I am one of the easiest people to wait on in the world. As I am a server myself and have worked just about every position in a restaurant. I've noticed a steady decline in the service and the quality of the food since relocating to Palms Place. In any case I found myself dinning at the bar with a friend of mine on a Tuesday night. Whom also has spent most of his life in the industry.  We had established a  rapport with one of the bartenders earlier in the day as with sipped our bloodymarys to nurse the previous nights antics. So we came back for dinner and decided to sit with her rather than dine at a table. As it turns out she was no longer working the double she had mentioned earlier and was on her way out.  So we two new bartenders(no big deal). We proceeded to order three courses. The first being the Tuna Tatar and Sweet Onion Dip with Cracked Black Pepper Chips. Both perfect in presentation but lacking almost complete of salt. So half way through the onion dip having never even touched the Tuna our salads arrive. So it became very clear at this point the young lady now attending us had no concept of timing. My drink ran dry at this point as well. So we stopped our friend from earlier and  asked her to relay the message ""We're gonna be here all night, just wanna have leisurely dinner very slow and low. Please don't fire the steaks until we say. My friend would like to take a break in between to go have a smoke and maybe a drink then eat our entrées."" 
  So this is where it really went south. She then returns a few moments later and says your steaks have already been fired you got about 15min, ""is that ok?"" Mind you we now have four plates of food sitting in front of us. I replied definitely not ok please tell them to take the steaks off the grill and don't fire until I ask. She says ok and then says good bye she's heading home. I trusted that this message had been relayed. By now my drink has been empty for 10-15min with no sign of replenishment. So finally flag down our bartender who's literally been three feet away the whole time and ask for a Basil Hayden old-fashion. Up or on the rocks she asks. I reply rocks as I'm pretty certain an old fashion is never served up. But I'm thinking maybe Simon is playing with cocktails now not just food. Anyhow she grabs the Makers and I stop her to remind her I said Basil. She proceeds to muddle, shake, and strain into a martini glass. I smile and drink without comment at this point I'm feeling bad and don't wanna say anything more. 
  We finish our apps and move onto salads. A third friend joins us for a drink and a bite. She too works in a restaurant just acrossed the lot at Palms. She promply orders a glass of wine and a sushi roll. About two bites into my salad and here comes the steaks! Now I'm officially pissed. Not only this, but the runner is trying to clear my salad. I tell him to set the steak to the side so I can finish. Now me and my original friend are both irate. He finishes his salad quickly and says he's going for a smoke. I follow suite and move on to my steak, ordered MR and is clearly leaning toward MW. Still feeling bad say nothing. Friend A returns friend B finishes 1st glass of wine still no sushi. It's at this point it's just ridiculous. Friend A does't have a fork to eat his now cold steak. having been no check back it takes us literally about 20-30min to finally just wave down the bartender from the other end of the bar to procure a fork. Now he's pissed and just says you know what I don't even want it. And exits to the restroom. At the same time I ask the bartender with the fork to check on the sushi roll as it too has taken close to 30min and she replies everything is taking a long time tonight. Which in my mind is hilarious as we couldn't get them to slow down. 
  So friend A sees Kerry Simon in route to the restroom and stops him. He explains that he hates to complain and also works in a restaurant, but this is what's going on. To which Kerry replies with a straight face, and I quote ""Maybe you should've sat in the dinning room if you where having dinner. Our bar can be a little sketchy sometimes."" WHAT!!!?? 
  A couple more things transpired including another old-fashion in a martini glass. But this is already long winded. In the end this was my single worst dining experience of which I have many, in my entire life. It saddens me to think this because I wanted to have a good time and in the end it sort I sorta did in a twisted way. So long Simon was good run but  will never happen again.",jydo_BcxCa4pl1lrm21OyQ,3,1,1,235dfrj2oL6Il9uvDXTISA

I do strongly recommend it as they offer a special menu and I was surprised by the reasonable prices. The ambience here is very nice and my friend commented on it. We were going to sit at the bar but decided to get a table. We but ordered various sushi rolls. He also had a salad. Everything tasted good, well presented and served promptly.

At $38 its expensive for brunch but if you think about how much you would have to pay to eat say an eggs benedict (probably $15) then its actually a decent price.  Since I love eggs, the lobster harvarti benedict and pulled pork benedict stick out to me.  The lobster harvarti with egg yolk oozing all over.... ahhhh.  The pulled pork was tangy with the bbq sauce.  The french toast was simply the greatest thing ever!  Only disappointment was the chicken and waffles.... it was chicken and waffles.... nothing special.  There is also the sushi bar which was surprisingly good and the peel and eat shrimp was surprisingly plump.  A semi disappointment was the juice bar.  I thought there would be lots of different smoothies and such but there were only 3 choices.  A decent berry smoothie, a green machine which although healthy is made of wheat grass which makes it kinda bitter, and a not too appetizing beet cocktail.

Interestingly, SIMON was empty. That should not permit them to have only one server working both the bar and dining room. Despite there only being a few other tables, it took 20 minutes to order. I can't blame it on the server, he was doing his best considering he had to take care of the entire restaurant. I'm vegan and ordered off their separate vegan menu. The dish I received was not at all what I ordered and the server tried to play it off as if I didn't know what I ordered. After a few minutes of back and forth the manager came out and explained the server didn't even know they offered the dish I ordered (some kind of quinoa). They took it off the bill and sent out the correct dish. It was probably the worst thing I have ever been served. It was cold, undercooked, and yet very greasy. I will usually just bite my tongue and eat food that isn't great, but this was inedible. I sent it back and ordered some shishito peppers that came out saturated in oil and completely burned and tasted like butane.

4701489,2013-09-18,1,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"When I visited for Sunday Brunch three years ago, it was so wonderful! I'm sad to say I didn't visit again, but I spoke highly of my experience and had every intention on returning. I remember the freshness of the sashimi most of all and the extremely talented sushi chefs available. The other dishes and breakfast pastries were tasty as well. Oh, and the view of the pool is nice. I don't recall hating anything.

My most recent visit was on 06/04/13 with the whole family. I was excited to come back and have everyone else try it as well. Our server was phenomenal. So personable, really great with everyone, and very attentive. I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant - fancy, but not too fancy with modern and fun decor.

My fiance and I started with the Spanish Octopus appetizer (grilled octopus, charred potatoes, sweet peppers, lemoncello vinaigrette). The octopus didn't seem fresh or perhaps not cooked properly, so the texture wasn't amazing. The flavors were just okay. I was disappointed. We also ordered a salad for the table; Roasted Cauliflower Burrata with duck salami, aged balsamic, pine nut brittle. This was really good. I loved the roasted cauliflower, the salami was light, burrata was creamy, and the brittle was a nice touch.

The entrees and sides: Big Eye Tuna (seared and served with summer vegetable mint quinoa, finished with jalapeño cilantro cream), Gemelli Bolognaise (housemade ricotta cheese, fresh basil made with beef, veal and lamb), Morrow Bay Black Cod (bacon cider vinaigrette, salad of chile shrimp & baby greens), Mama Simon's Meatloaf (mashed potatoes, succotash made with beef and veal), Red Thai Curry (Kaffir lime, pineapple chutney, jasmine rice, with shrimp), Truffled Mac & Cheese with Lobster, and Signature Crispy Sesame Rice with Spicy Tuna.

The tuna was just meh. Quality, flavor all lacked. The cod was also just okay, meatloaf wasn't flavorful and a bit dry, and the mac & cheese was overwhelmingly truffle. The best entree of the group was the pasta. I thought the bolognaise was delicious and I love the topping of ricotta. The spicy tuna with crispy rice was amazing. I should have just ordered sushi!

We ordered three desserts for the table. Sorbet Trio of Raspberry, Mango, and Lemon and two others (can't remember their names). One was a chocolate pudding cake I think with ice cream or gelato. The other dessert was like a deep-fried apple pie? There was caramel and a delicious salted caramel ice cream/gelato. They were delicious. The sorbet was refreshing. They also brought us the Simon Junk Food dessert platter (brownies, caramel corn, Sno Balls, Rice Krispie treats, Cup Cakes, cookies, cotton candy). It was definitely more fun than tasty. The cotton candy was good!

Overall, the meal was pretty disappointing. No one was extremely pleased or blown away by their entrees. Partnered with the high prices, I doubt anyone plans to return. I might give the brunch another go or at least just stick to the delicious sushi/sashimi.

At our table of 4, the Rainbow roll was not very fresh tasting or smelling, the famous crispy rice tuna squares had none of their usual flavor, the turkey Reuben was dry and inedible, and the sliders were cold. Nobody at our table had a good meal and two of us left hungry after not being able to choke down the cold and dried out sandwiches. Our waiter offered to redo our meals, but we had already been gone from the office over an hour, so no time to remake our food. People have said Chef Kerry is in poor health, and we can't help but wonder if he's no longer in the kitchen, or if there was some other change in culinary staff. Perhaps it is The Palms' recent ownership change. Whatever is going on, we left heartbroken that our favorite lunch spot's time seems to have come to an end. I do hope someone steps in FAST and can bring things back to their formerly consistent level of quality and customer delight.",ZAGsy7VSRdSpxMSGKUlSsA,0,0,1,f3omA36G3S2yp01X67aKkA
4753153,2009-02-19,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"The food was very good.  We got the 3 course price fixed menu with wine pairings. 

We started with the chef sushi platter and the yellowtail was amazing.  The crispy rice with spicy tuna was also awesome.  We were informed the fish had just been broke down no more than an hour before!

Our entree was the salt baked fillet for two.  I have never had a steak prepared this way and was very happy with the results.  Our only complaint was that we asked for medium rare and it ranged from medium well to medium rare.  The medium rare portion was unbelievably good and the medium well portion was still very good.  We figured it was very difficult to control the heat inside the salt shell and were still very happy with what we received so we didn't send it back.  There were two sauces served with it....the red wine sauce was our favorite.

Dessert was soppapias served with vanilla ice cream.  We got them because the junk food platter seemed too over the top and loved the dish.  We were not able to finish it because we were stuffed.

All of the wines were good and the dessert wine was the standout.  I wish I could remember what it was because I don't normally like them, but this one had a clean crisp flavor.

The service was not as I might have hoped for, but weekends tend to be hectic at any restaurant.  It took about 30 minutes past our reservation to get our table and the waitress did not get our drink order right.  Everything else was awesome and since the issues were minimal we were able to look past them.

The atmosphere was awesome and combined with the awesome food made for a memorable experience.",kfhlDBBQiadEda--rYZjjw,0,0,5,UNCW_pz3LaMJWhufM-morA

That's all I can think of when I look back on my dinner at Simon. Everything was lovely and the food was wonderful. But when I pay $39 for a NY Strip, I expect at least some sort of side dish to go with it! Especially if they list ""sliced potatoes"" on the menu with it! What they mean by ""sliced potatoes"" is ""about a dozen dime-sized medallions that mostly just soak up the meat juices for you."" Our waitress talked me into ordering a side of mac & cheese. I could hear the cash register go ka-ching as I agreed to tag a $9 pot of cheesy pasta onto my already-swollen bill.

Again, I must say that the meal was delicious. I just had to keep my mind off of the price while I ate or I would've lost my appetite. 

Also, while waiting for our friends to meet us, the waitress asked if we'd like some grilled edamame to snack on while we waited. ""Sure,"" we said, ""why not?"" She failed to tell us it cost $8. C'est la vie! 

$8 edamame, $39 steak, $9 macaroni & cheese = $56. And I didn't even get alcohol.",3PaNIWP2uFZBcayFa1yUkQ,0,0,3,i-YRZxCdq9khM7PlBC8Ybw

Seriously the sushi needs help. I only came because I had a gift cert from restaurant.com that they wouldn't take the first time, they said it was happy hour, well gift cert said any meal anytime any day. So I got stuck with having to go a second time just to use the certs.
Left unsatisfied and wanting something else to eat.
Recently found the 24/7 cafe in the back of palms has a great restaurant. The prime rib was delicious, I swear the same quality as Simons.

They have pho noodles and excellent Chinese too.

There is also a whole menu from which you can order - various eggs benedicts, waffles, french toast, pigs in a blanket, etc. etc. etc.  All interesting and tasty.  All you can eat!

But the piece de resistance, the JUNK FOOD PLATTER.  Cotton candy, caramel corn, homemade ding dongs/snowballs, brownies, and rice krispy treats...  YUM!

Lobster Eggs Benedict - I can't even taste the lobster. The poached egg was cooked fine. However, it was awful overall. I order a lot of eggs benedict and I can say this is the WORST I've ever had.

Frosted Flake French Toast - Meh...tasted like it had been sitting in a food warmer in the back. Served lukewarm...gross.

Peel & Eat Shrimp - I love shrimp and they were really fresh. The cocktail sauce was delicious. I could eat this all day.

The vibe is very swanky and Earth friendly (apparently Simon uses sustainable resources in its decor, etc.). Very chic and sexy--situated right next to the pool. 

Our server seemed to be a bit out of it--a little bit of ganja perhaps? Simon does have a whole wall of herbs growing under plant lamps in the rear of the restaurant. Maybe a little bit of the good stuff as well? Anyhow, despite the glazed over look he got the job done. 

I was able to sample a handful of menu items and was pleased with them all. Among them were the grilled edamame (awesome!), the pot stickers (eh, okay), the truffled mac-n-cheese (drool!) and the chicken stuffed with pretzel roll stuffing (pretzel roll! Mmm). Everyone else seemed to enjoy their selections as well, which included the tuna tartar, filet mignon, sushi, and various sides. The bread basket alone was enough to make me swoon. 

We also ordered a desert tray called 'Junk Food' which included various homemade versions of American favorites. Rice Krispie treats, Snow Balls, cotton candy, brownies, cookies, caramel corn, etc. I only sampled a bite because I was such a little piggy prior to this delectable tray arriving but everyone else gave it rave reviews.

4971314,2008-09-17,3,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Worst damn restaurant on the Vegas Strip, hands down.

So I go there for a business meeting with a group. A corporation is paying so we usually get the best food and service. Not here.

We sampled over 8 main courses on the menu. All of them were very sub par and cooked/prepared poorly. The service was slow, we could never get refills despite having 3 servers dedicated to our room. Half of the dishes were cold by the time they delivered them. The decor was cheesy and poorly done. A futile attempt at class and modern sophistication designed bya high school level idiot. They have a pool just outside on the patio, doesnt quite make sense to me but whatever.  And to top it off I got a look at the check, way overpriced for bad food and service.

Ok Im a big dessert fan. I judge restaurants by their desserts.  So when we get finished with the crappy food. I figure, at least some sugary treat will improve my opinion of the place. These jokers bring out a tray full of cotton candy, rice-krispy treats, stale donuts, and hot pink sno-balls. Artery clogging shit I could buy at 7-11.  Not one hand made goody on the plate. 

The only good thing about the place was the hostess and her impressive cleavage. Even this isnt enough to get me to return for seconds. Simon is soon to be a Vegas dive bar and will likely disappear in a year or two.",Lom1Q_igz982nqgggbmZtQ,4,1,1,3PtKnwKUt-H_lJIhM8A9qQ

I love that Simon over looks the pool and huge fireplace that they have outside. They have a very modern and sleek design to the whole restaurant. In the bar area the chandeliers are made out of clearish stones. Very cool. They also have a huge wine cellar. It's made of clear glass so you can see all those precious, beautiful and tasty bottles of wine. 

Before we had gone to the restaurant I'd naturally checked Yelp and discovered they had a great happy hour menu. So we decided to save some cash and hit up happy hour. So when we got there at 6 we were told we'd have to sit at the bar to order off the happy hour menu. Which was totally cool with us. Plus, there was an open bench with a table ready for us. 
The happy hour menu is great there is nothing over $15 and its a really amazing sampling of their main menu. Joel ordered the Hamburger with Swiss cheese. I ordered the Salmon Sashimi and we split the Fried Calamari. The Sashimi melted in my mouth. The Fried Calamari came with a wonderful citrus soy sauce. It really made the Calamari pop! Even Joel's Hamburger was tasty. It came with lots of fries too. 

The service was great even though the bar was busy. Our food came out quickly and our server kept checking to make sure we had everything we needed. 

I'm so happy we got to dine in Simon's before they close. It will be missed greatly. I can tell by the food we ate that the rest of the menu must be awesome as well. I truly walked out of there with my tummy happy.",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,1,2,4,1ohoXTd1r4cDsynbdMpAWg

The side facing the pool is all glass walls, which offer a nice poolside view. We were there for dinner, so the pool was already empty and the dining area dimly lit. The restaurant did seem pretty slow. Not sure if that's just because it's a weekday evening.
Prices seemed slightly less than one would pay at any strip fine dining spot. So still pricey but not exorbitant. Since I was there with the family, I was able to sample quite a few items. I had the bolognaise. I had samples of the meatloaf, seared big eye tuna on quinoa, lobster mac n cheese. The bolognaise tasted good, although I was surprised it was served with cavatelli instead of something like tagliatelle. Just a different expectation I suppose. The meatloaf seemed a little bland. Seared tuna tasted decent but it was seared a bit too long I think, the cooked outer layer was a pretty big chunk of the slice. Lobster mac n cheese seemed a bit too truffle-y and rich to a few of us, but a few liked it. We had a slew of desserts. The fruit sorbet trio were clean and crisp tasting. A bit disappointed that there was no passion fruit sorbet upon receiving it after I ordered it because that was one flavor I really wanted to try. I did like the mango that came instead. The raspberry was nice, the lemon seemed a bit overly sour & tart.
The service was very good. Checked upon often, waters refilled quickly. I give this place a solid 3.5 stars. Couldn't quite give it the nudge to 4. I heard about their brunch and happy hour specials. Those might be worth trying another time. Otherwise I'm not sure I would come again. Decent place with good service but theres probably alot of other places I'd go first.

taste  - excellent

One of my FAVORITE places ever!! 
I got to admit I am a little favorably bias because when I met my boyfriend he worked here as a server and his sister is a pastry chef here.... but HONEST-to-goodness I really do love everything I have ever ordered from here regardless. 
When it was at hardrock is was just as good but now at the palms it's more spacious and beautiful inside. I love the fireplace area!!
Even when we where low on cash my friend and I would come in an just order the french fries (best french fries ever!) Order them with truffle sauce it makes all the difference! Also the shrimp cocktail was one of our favorite just for a snack before going out on the town or whatever.
For dinner-I highly recommend the lamb porterhouse, the bison (if they have it sense it's special), or the bamboo steamed fish (which we always ask for halibut and I personally don't care for bok choy so I get spinach instead). They have a new drink there that is SO good I forgot the name but it's a martini which I asked for on the rocks- but was really tangy and delicious! 
The beef carpaccio is one of the best I've ever had! Endive Salad is really good, I love the point reyes blue cheese! 
As far as desserts go I know they almost always have special desserts- I'll post a few pictures. One the I really loved and sounded strange at first but was so savory-sweet... was the a caramel popcorn icecream. Not sure if they'll have it as a staple but I hope so! The cotton candy is free and fun to eat with friends, goes to show Kerry Simon has a great sense of humor. 
Okay one more lovely thing to say- the sushi is also really great and the bar is ultra romantic, great idea for a date night... I'll post some pictures of that as well!",bEhO6RG2rgf-jFAv0th0gA,1,1,5,Bimbr4wkVlvpu7RGmW7CQg
5199279,2010-10-21,7,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Is it dorky to say I feel cool eating here? Well, I guess the dork cat is outta the bag because that's what I am saying: I feel cool eating here. It is poolside dining at its finest, most stylish, and most sinfully sweet. (And, I haven't even tried the desserts!)

I have been here on two occasions, and neither occasion was a full-on sit down dinner, but rather a hang with peeps enjoying some light bites. I will admit that this type of dining does not demand a high level of service, but the bartender, who served as our waiter, was friendly and knowledgeable. He made several recommendations that were all spot on. Because of that, last night our light bites transformed into a full meal, as we couldn't resist ordering more of some of our favorite things!

What are a few of our favorite things?
1. Crispy Sesame Rice: A must! The perfect bar food bite (if you like spicy tuna). It is a delectable marriage between spicy tuna and a mini, salty rice crispy treat. The flavor is crave worthy, as I am craving it right now. We ordered 3 rounds of these bad, by which I mean good, mamas. 
2. Edamame: Forget what your Japanese mama told you cuz this stuff blew my edamame expectation outta the water. It is wok charred. Translation: A brilliant grilled flavor infused into every tasty little pod.
3. Spinach Pizza: Yum-azing. Apparently, Mr. Simon got his cooking start in the pizza world, so he takes his pie very seriously. It shows. The crust was the perfect chewy/crispy combo, and the boursin cheese on top was tempting me to lick that stuff right off. 
4. Calamari: Some places don't respect calamari. It has become like the potato skin for foodies, but not here. Nice, thick rings, perfectly battered with a flavor that survives the fry.  

As far as those four items go, the flavors were top notch. Nothing made my palette angry, and despite the creativity, I never felt that something sacrificed taste for show. Again, I have not experienced a full sit down meal here, but for me, it is definitely now at the top of my list for a round of drinks and nibbles at a hip hang. 

Useful notes: They have sushi happy hour every day from 4-7pm. And all day, every day locals can enjoy $4 beer, $6 well drinks, and $7 glasses of wine. That is a screaming deal for such a swank establishment.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,14,8,4,LfQTxX1fAXJZSTAI9ixUGQ

An example of how rude their servers are: 
I ordered a sushi platter described on the menu as ""california roll, and tuna hand roll"". I despise spicy tuna (I hate spicy things and hate mayo) so imagine my surprise when a *spicy* tuna handroll shows up. I explain to the waiter the menu says just tuna so I'd like a tuna handroll. He refuses, says I'm wrong, the menu says ""spicy"" and walks away. I have to freaking go grab a menu , show him the words ""tuna hand roll"" , and ask again for a new handroll before he goes and grabs me another one. UGH

Besides the service, the food is just BLAH. Bland, expensive. I'm into the whole foo-foo lunch thing, but honestly Society Cafe at Encore does the whole concept far better. The surf and turf tacos for $17 are TINY. I got a filet mignon cobb salad today for $18. I order my steak medium rare. The salad is so sad looking and imagine my disappointment to find my ""filet mignon"" is 2 ounces or so of grizzly, tough, dark brown ""steak"". Hardly a filet mignon, definitely not medium rare, and for sure 2 ounces of steak over greens for $18 is a ripoff. The sushi is a step above grocery store sushi - yup, that's the best I can say for it.

It's tucked away above the hotel lobby near the front entrance/parking garage area. Luckily for me, I finally found Simon right before Happy Hour was about to end (Mon - Thu: 5pm - 7pm; Fri - Sun: 3pm - 6pm). 

My friend and I sat at the bar and delved into the HH Menu. I decided on the Mac n' Cheese ($8) while she opted for the Shrimp Tempura ($8). The bartender, Mark, is officially my favorite bartender in Las Vegas. My tipsy friend, after ordering a Guinness, was rambling on about how Guinness and cookies are supposedly an awesome pairing. A minute later, Mark came by and dropped off two chocolate cookies for us. What a nice guy! He went back and forth with us, going along with our drunken antics. I was laughing my ass off the entire time we were at the bar. He did an awesome job at keeping my glass filled with water (I was so dehydrated!). You rock, Mark!

Truffled Macaroni and Cheese: This mac n' cheese was delicious! Perfectly cheesy and I loved the ground black pepper in it. My friend kept trying to steal some from the bowl.

Ambiance: Chandeliers = Fancy. The vibe felt upscale and modern. We were dressed in costumes but I would want to dress up a little here.

Return visit? Sure! I had fun at Simon's restaurant and would definitely get the truffled macaroni and cheese again.

Begun by my buddy's $25 shot of Patron Platinum (following a $30 OpusX cigar earlier at Shadowbar) everything at Simon was good but overpriced for the quality.  The one shining aspect of the meal was the AMAZING breadbowl, however, featuring homemade cheeze-its, buttermilk biscuits, handmade pretzels, and zucchini bread.

For my meal I had the Cali Pizza (Toro, Crab, Avocado, Daikon, Endive, Soy) and 4-cheese saffron truffle mac n' cheese.  Simon states this is the best Mac n' Cheese in the world but I've had better at Michael Mina's Bourbon Steak, Emeril's Fishhouse, and M at Miranova.

For dessert?  The junkfood platter with gourmet versions of a hostess cupcake, snowball, ricecrispy treats, and a chocolate shake.  Cute, but essentially just sugary.

My friend loved his steak and chocolate cake.

Of course we're lagers and was late thought we would've had to wait even though we had reservations as soon as we parked the car and walked up it was empty but was understandable because it was during EDC weekend. The atmosphere was suppose to be dimmed but it was super dark in there.

Sat down and looked at the menu & there's not really much items .. I was feeling like a steak would satisfy my hunger so I order the fillet Mignon my rating for that eh.. its okay I guess. I had also order a side of grilled asparagus all of that including my friends orders took them a whole hour just to bring out our food, I looked around and thought man it's pretty busy for them since its taking so long but nope there was only 7 people in there not including the group I went with & the workers .. wthell really?

Finally our food came out .. I was pretty excited to fulfill my hunger man was I so disappointed. The grilled asparagus sucked so bad it was burnt  and the steak was alright like I had mention before, I had better. The mashed potatoes .. no comment. The meat loaf .. gag sorry to say. The dessert was little zinger looking cupcake bites & cotton candy something different but cotton candy really?

Out of everything we tried, the french toast was the only dish I wanted more of. Everything else was decent, but not wow worthy.

Sunday brunch here is absolute bliss.  I love the wide open room flooded with sunshine from the floor to ceiling windows that line the far wall.  As you enjoy your nummy nums you can watch tourists and cool people frolic in the pool just beyond the window.  This is a great people watching spot, as we've seen more than a handful of celebs chilling here.  Make sure to bring your shades.  You might need them depending on where you are seated.  They have an AYCD bloody mary bar or mimosas/bellinis.  I love both, but here I def recommend the bloody mary bar as you can pick your vodka & they have every possible accoutrement you could ever need to spice it up.  On the other hand, their  mimosas & bellinis are a formula for a mid afternoon hangover, aka crappy quality champagne.  They have an area where you can grab your own foods stocked with sushi, smoked salmon, miso soup, fruit, cereal, pastries, etc.  Then they have a menu that is AYCE ordering.  I go nuts for the chicken & waffles (minus the waffles).

Happy hour is M-F, 4-7 and everything on the menu, including drinks is $6.  The lounge is super comfy and you get to enjoy a little bit of sunshine as the sun sets.

5498972,2012-04-18,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"My favorite brunch in Vegas. This place is so, so, so good in so many different ways.

First, a brief word about how the brunch works. It's a hybrid of buffet service and a la carte, which usually means either/or. In this case, it means AND. As a proud glutton, I'm a big fan of ""and."" You can order whatever you like from the kitchen, and while they're making your dishes, you can graze from the many - god I hate this phrase - ""action stations"" where chefs whip up smoothies, sandwiches, sushi and more. The meal is $40 or so per person.

The best things to get from the buffet stations include ham and fontina on pretzel bread or the pecorino honeycomb panini. Especially the latter - the combination of sweet and savory here is amazing. From the sushi station, the crispy rice and tuna is craveworthy and delicious.

But don't fill up without getting an entree or two from the kitchen. Best of the bunch is the French toast, made of a melt-in-your-mouth brioche dredged in Frosted Flakes. Skip the syrup, this doesn't need it.

The Margherita pizza is decent - it's not VPN, of course, but it's quite tasty. The lobster benedict also and the banana Nutella crepes also got rave reviews from my companions.

The meal concludes with the infamous SImon junk food platter, which features Kerry Simon's versions of things like the Hostess cupcake, Rice Krispie Treats, chocolate chip cookies, brownies and even a pile of cotton candy. Save room.

Drink service: they offer a $17 add-on option for bottomless Bellinis or Bloody Marys, the latter of which you can customize to your liking with dozens of veggies, hot sauces, condiments and add-ons all the way up to Slim Jims.

The atmosphere is great. The casual vibe is enhanced by the staff in pajamas, and sometimes the guests as well. Kerry Simon has been in the kitchen every time I've eaten here, and Palms founder George Maloof is regularly in the front of the house.

By far the best reason to get out of bed before noon on a Saturday. Or after - they serve until 4pm.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,6,0,5,fxHqryhVHrqZAMrKf6VZFA

5529287,2012-07-16,21,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"SUNDAY BRUNCH:

What a terrific way to spend a beautiful Sunday morning.  This brunch has it all from the character, atmosphere, unique brunch items and service.  I like how they encourage even the customers to come wearing pajamas.  We opted not to but we definitely will next time. 

To say I went over the top with the food is an understatement.  The fullest I have ever felt in my life and believe me when I say I can be a ridiculously gluttonous pig.  Even my wife who eats with me everyday was taken a back.  I was out of control. 

I did actually have as small as a dinner the night before in order to be as hungry as I could do get my $40 worth of all you can eat.  We started with the dishes at the self serve area.  There were 6 choices at the panini/sandwich/crepe station and we had 3 of them.  The super friendly and helpful gentleman manning the station suggested his favorite which was a slice of baguette grilled in some kind of honey and butter which was outstanding.  My only thought was that it would taste even better while being inebriated.  The crepes were just ok and could've been a little more toasty than spongy but that's just our preference. 

The sushi station was way above the average buffet sushi.  All the nigiri and rolls were made to order with the exception of Simon's signature crispy tuna which were amazing.  I had 8 pieces of crispy tuna and 8 pieces of salmon.  They also had a whole slab of smoked salmon layed out and I probably had 5 slices of that.

The juice station!  I loved this.  Does any other restaurant offer this as part of the menu?  Please let me know if there is because I would be all over this.  Freshly squeezed fruit, protein shakes, vegetable juices, yogurt smoothies and I could have as many as I wanted to.  Damn, dude!  I must've had 7 glasses of various liquids.  I didn't partake in the extra alcohol deals since I didn't feel like being bombed and then hungover by 4pm.  But the deals were reasonable: $12 for unlimited Black Star beer or $17 for unlimited champagne/mimosa/bellinis or $14(?) for unlimited trips to the make your own bloody mary bar.  I would rather have them make my bloody mary since I would screw it up but it looked quite popular.

And on top of all this great stuff there's the a la carte menu.  We had the french toast which I think was encrusted with Frosted Flakes.  It was crunchy, sweet with a soft center.  Genius!  

4 different types of hash.  I generally dislike Hollandaise sauce but it was ok with the steak hash.  We also got an additional fill of protein from the egg white frittata which was packed with 5 different veggies including corn, onion and several peppers.  I was unable to finish the frittata due to the fact they must've used about 12 eggs in it.  

Breakfast pizza is a must.  So wrong yet so right.  Topped with sausage, bacon, country gravy and other ingredients that make diets run and hide.  I inhaled it like a champion.  

You've probably heard of the meat sweats but have you ever heard of breakfast sweats?  That's what I went through about an hour after the meal.  So much good food.  I am definitely going to pace myself better next time and will definitely do less carbs as well but everything looked (and tasted) so damn good!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,24,22,5,mOmYEIlPZTHDz9gms1E47Q

I like how it's a hybrid of buffet and made-to-order food during the Sunday brunch (but you still only pay $40 for AYCE). I wouldn't go any other time than during the Sunday brunch because during this time you can try everything. My favorite thing was the Philly Eggs Benedict--amazing. The paninis and sushi were good as well. You get cotton candy at the end of your meal and you can even take home candy from the tiered shelf near the entrance.

I had the spicy tuna roll as an appetizer and the Chilean sea bass. All of the food was very good and our waiter was very nice. The décor is very pretty. The only downside is that even though it is technically inside, the pool is right next door so there were some very inappropriately dressed women at the bar who were very drunk and very loud.

5657404,2008-08-20,4,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"What a major disappointment.  I always thought the old Simon at the Hard Rock was kind of unimpressive, so I was convinced that the new Simon would definitely be an improvement.  Wrong.

They really missed the mark on this one.  The space is beautiful, I will give them that.  A very chic and clean ambiance, while you dine poolside and check out the view of the Palms fantasy tower.

The positives pretty much end there.  The fact of the matter is that their food sucks.  Period.  We ordered the crispy creamy rock shrimp, the garganelli pasta with lobster, clams and peas and the chicken curry.  The rock shrimp were mediocre.  Not bad, but not good.  Somewhat soggy.  Our entrees, however, both sucked hardcore.  My pasta had a somewhat sweet flavor, and I felt like the lobster use was stingy in addition to being overcooked.  And, the pasta was not al dente at all-it was actually falling apart.  My friend's entree was straight up bad.  The curry was way to thin and liquidy, and the chicken was dry and overcooked.  We ended up sending that dish back, and the friendly busser told us that most customers don't like that dish in particular, in addition to my pasta as well.  She was surprised I didn't send the garganelli back too. I'd also like to mention that the bread bowl that I had been looking forward to all day was disappointing as well!  The old Simon had MUCH better, fresher bread varietals.  The pretzel bread was dry and stale, and all the other breads were ""eh"", and COLD.

In addition to the mediocre food, both me and my friend thought the attractive female bartender was rude and bitchy.  And, don't be fooled my friends, the Pineapple Mojito made with ""fresh pineapple"" is NOT actually made with fresh pineapple but canned pineapple juice.  Bleh.  I will mention that our server was extremely friendly and put up with my high maintenance bullshit very well.  Props to him.

Go back to what you were doing before, Kerry Simon.  Cause this definitely 'aint an improvement.  Will not be back unless there are some mayjah changes with the menu.",4k9-LoufKfGflVzQfmkrdw,6,4,2,qIYR9xeJ45fQ4fkzAdkuFA

We came around 3/330 ish which apparently is an off time for them because their menu was extremely limited. 3 appetizers, a couple salads, a trip tip dip sandwich, and a blue cheese burger were our only options other then sushi which neither my sister or I eat. We were a little taken aback by the lack of options and not drawn to much of any of them, but we were STARVING so my sister settled on the tri-tip dip and I the bleu cheese burger, both are served with fries. 

After waiting forever when there were only 2 other people who ordered ahead of us we were served. My burger was divine though the bread a bit overly toasted. My sister's sandwich was served on the hardest toasted baguette known to man she could barely cut it with a knife and ended up just eating the meat and cheese out of it. The fries were really different and delicous...like a cross between Rally's(Checker's) and Mickey D's fries.

5757416,2011-09-23,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"To start with the decor and layout of the restaurant is very contemporary and the poolside view from inside the restaurant is very modern. I was there attending a conference and was delighted with the family style appetizers and salad that was served at each table. The spinach flat bread pizza, bread basket which included banana bread was awesome. The remaining appetizers included port pot stickers and calamari calamari which were nothing to scream about. However the bamboo salad (i think they called it) was delicious. It was served family style with walnuts, goat cheese and apples throughout the bowl. I in fact had two servings. The dinner unfortunately I was not too impressed with. I ordered the grilled halibut with steamed veggies. I do have to say that the presentation was nice, they were served in bamboo dishes that were covered when brought to the table and the server removed their tops once they were served to you. The halibut was too dry for my taste and my friends who actually asked for a side of dipping sauce to eat with it and the veggies for being steamed were also really dry and plain. 
The desert which is what I read had the best reviews was not that great for me. The cotton candy is HUGE I'll give them that but honestly who can finish a bowl of cotton candy as big as they serve it. The remaining desert were just ordinary rice crispy treats, hostess cupcakes, coconut bon bon and cookies.

5778715,2011-08-29,0,bLCdohUvOM7l1OcXifmblw,"Extremely slow, sloppy service, majority of food was pretty mediocre especially when factoring in the high prices. I was here twice due to a friend's birthday, so this review is based on a dinner in the private dining room for about 40ppl and also their Sunday brunch for 16ppl.
The palms place valet was full they said because they're sponsoring the ufc fight that night. The fight was in Brazil, so I don't really get it... I had to self park and haul my presents, balloons and other stuff, so an awesome start.  

The private dining room was great, glass enclosed overlooking the lighted pool area and the main dining room. They had 4 big round tables that comfortably seated about 10. Although there was enough waitstaff filling waters, there was only 1 waiter or bartender taking drink orders. That meant waiting for about 15min till he acknowledged me, then another 20 till drinks actually arrived. I saw the other waiters at brunch the next day, so I know they're all capable of taking drink orders. In addition to being slow, the guy also seemed bored like he didn't want to be there. Maybe the built in gratuity had something to do with it, but don't stand there with a pissy face all night. 

The courses came out timed pretty well. I guess they do their private dining family style, which just seems lazy to me. The tables are too big, plates are too big and heavy for a family style dinner to make sense. There's no lazy Susan like at Chinese restaurants. 

The chefs and/or waiters also can't count because we were shorted on some of the food. Not everyone got a piece of chicken (I got a little drumstick) and I don't really count a 2"" square of steamed salmon as an ok portion. Dessert was good, but again they were really cheap with the portion. Since dinner is charged per person, they should in theory have enough of each item for each person right? Not at Simon. At Simon, 9 people get a bowl of cotton candy, 4 snowballs, 4 (mini) hostess cupcakes, 4 brownies, 4 rice crispy treats, 2 little containers of carmel corn and 6 cookies. Makes sense right? Right..

I don't even want to know what my friend spent on dinner because I'm sure it would make me sick. Nobody wants to say anything (and he's not on yelp), but he got ripped off big time. It wasn't just the portion - quality was lacking as well. Only thing that stood out were the charred edamame. Meatloaf was good but dry, chicken was good but no clue what the little black things on the side were. 

On to Sunday brunch the following day. Our waiter was nice but seemed overwhelmed. He seemed to be hustling, but the kitchen was slow as hell. With such a limited brunch menu, things should've flown out the kitchen. We were waiting 20-30 minutes for our orders, which is unacceptable. All they had to do for a benedict is poach an egg then assemble it, everything else should've already been made. They're also really slow to clear.

I ordered a ham panini and toasted bagel. There were 3ppl waiting so I went to get sushi which is 2 feet away. That @sshole gave my stuff to someone else, didn't apologize or anything. The ham and cheese on pretzel bread was inedible - there was so much salt on the bread its the only thing you could taste. Bagel was a bagel, can't eff that up. 
Really good, fresh sushi but really limited options - spicy tuna, but no tuna sashimi or nigiri. The spicy tuna on crispy rice was good but not at all spicy. Pastry and dessert selection was limited and nothing was note worthy. They also had smoothies and cocktail shrimp. I don't like that it was peel and eat - for $40/person they couldn't just buy peeled shrimp? 

Breakfast pizza, pulled pork benny on jalapeno cornbread and the cornflake french toast were awesome. The flavors of the pork benny went perfectly together and i love that the middle of the french toast was custardy. 10x better than babycakes' cornflake french toast. Chicken and waffles featured a tasteless chicken finger with your standard waffle, ""lobster"" benny was also a big fail. No joke, the only lobster piece that I found was a sliver less than 1/2 cm big. Crepes sit in a pile, not made fresh to order.

Mimosas were good, but our glasses sat empty way too often. So at a total of $57 if you opt for unlimited mimosas, bloody Mary's or Bellini's this brunch was a little pricey. If you like Sunday brunch with made to order entrees vs buffet I highly recommend Republic Kitchen at half the price, way better service and better food. Its not on the strip, but hey neither is Simon.

I noticed most of the reviews I read mentioned they had either a travel zoo coupon or dining credit from staying at palms place. A good restaurant shouldn't have to rely on promos like that to fill the dining room. It still wasn't full on a Saturday night btw, but brunch was busy. 

My friend was drunk and too busy jumping between tables to realize the issues with dinner. But I will be sure to encourage him to go somewhere else with his money for next years",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,2,0,2,DVVLRRUklY-fTacI0YRztQ

Yes, it is a buffet brunch - with a few exceptions. Everything on the menu can be ordered, directly to the table, a la carte. And we did just that. From a beautifully baked vegetable quiche to numerous versions of French toasts and omelettes, the variety here is simply astounding. Portions aren't so bad either. For some of us, that means letting the belt down a few notches. 

As mentioned by many others, the buffet is set up into different stations. Here you can personalize your own crepes, smoothies and sushi platter. It is simply the best made-to-order, buffet food you could get. 

Service is very personable, fun and relaxing. On Sundays, all the waiting staff wear their jammies. So feel free to let loose in yours too!

This celebrity chef once worked with a certain Ivana in New York, and he comes with some impressive credentials to the uninitiated, uninformed, the clueless and this female food critic !.  But he can't fool the real foodies. 

When you have cotton candy (as you see at circus and third class joints on main street) as a main attraction it speaks much for the creativity of the chef. The meat was not over cooked or under cooked...just not cooked. Raw meat brought to the table (from which school did this man acquire the fine culinary skills needed to transfer the raw meat from the wholesale supplier on to the table) and it was so revolting I turned  from a carnivore to a vegan and even took up yoga and meditation. However the memory of the uncooked morsel of meat, still sends shivers and anti-peristalsis down by food pipe to this date.

The truck taco stand at gas stations is hundred times better than this dump. The rock star chef with long hair is seen cooking without a head cover in social magazines and TV shows. Obviously he is oblivious to health department regulations or he is beyond any rules and regulations.

The desert was a disaster. The drinks overpriced for no reason other than you are dining in celebrity chef's esteemed eatery. I would not be surprised if this place closes soon and the rock star goes cooking for the lazy rich and famous sitting on their fat ass from the loans given to them by the golfing buddy crook bankers   One of my worst eating experiences.

I have been a few times for dinner as well as the weekend brunch and I can say I like quite a bit here. The brunch is fantastic.

For dinner, I'm a huge fan as well. The shishito peppers are divine. Perfectly seasoned and just yum, yum and more yum. The braised shortribs were perfectly cooked and seasoned. You can't go wrong with many of the dishes on the menu here.
