I can't complain about the service or the quality of the coffee so they earned another star there. However, I don't see myself coming back here. There are much better options for a cup of coffee.",IwycOt-Ms4tsMO30arVfyg,0,0,2,LM8xO85S0Mgh-A7C1dEZow

1648866,2017-08-03,0,ihwYbxAuOntsaKScPxbXOg,"Probably the worst Starbucks in Las Vegas.

After a nice long walk from Caesars Palace to my hotel, I stopped with more than five minutes to spare before the posted closing hours. They had the sandwich board blocking the path to order a drink, After pointing out the right time, I nearly got into an argument with them that a cellphone time and watch shows they're still open. 

When asked who owns this location, they said to complain to Aria, when speaking to the concierge at Aria, they told me this location is managed by Crystal's Mall which will be getting a call about their shoddy customer service. Extremely disappointing for such an upscale mall.",SLF4wEwihrWNC7ysnlM5sQ,0,0,1,warPYuLAicQuN9cKTstxZA

I would stop by about twice a week and order my drink and on sundays would also order wraps for myself and my boyfriend. Anyways, the last time I went there ( and it will be the last) I got charged twice for the same transaction with DIFFERENT amounts. How is that even possible? The next day I stopped by and asked to speak with a manager. The lady that started talking to me was defensive at the get go. No idea why since at that point I hadn't told her my concern. Once I talked to her about the charges she said that these charges have nothing to do with Starbucks but with MGM instead. Huh? How does that even make sense? She then said she would call get manager (even though that's the title she took in the beginning of the conversation). She came back after her phone call and took down my info and saying that her manager will contact me in about 15 minutes. NEVER heard from them and they took $50 out of my account for no reason.

1836694,2016-09-09,0,ihwYbxAuOntsaKScPxbXOg,"The design of this Starbucks is quite futuristic. I love it as much as I do the location. The missing star is the fact that they don't honor the rewards program. I'm not sure why a Starbucks location would do this. The fact that you earn stars but can't redeem anything is the confusing factor for most people, I think.

I know the rewards program is not what it used to be and the fact that the free refill policy covers everyone might hurt business, but at least birthday and reward drinks should be honored. The significantly more expensive drinks should cover for that. Being in a prime location makes me want to pay the extra dollar, so no harm there, at least not for me.",xxNwdlzDHa66SSlvgx0ZGQ,0,0,4,gziGCXZL_tF1AQaY5KXQzA

My friend didn't want to take it back because he doesn't like confrontation at all, but it's not about confronting it's about getting your money worth. Any how, I took mine back and let them know about it, I even gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the machine is not working, then the attendant takes it back, and gives me another one saying give it a try on this one because I did put a shot of coffee in it. Honestly it was the same thing, got frustrated and there was no point to say anything any more, because it should have been fixed the moment I told them about it.
