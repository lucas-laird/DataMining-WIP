And then when we pointed out the mistake they charge us the correct amount,but did not take the incorrect charge off the card. I'm now working with my credit card company to take the incorrect charge off.",TLH9OqwtursCwgXv2YgXgw,0,0,1,6acq6sMIl2VnSs2aPRuPAA
1108393,2014-05-25,0,pIo-HDaY6CBRlsJr8Id3Ig,"Wanted to do something different tonight and went to Red Mansion.  The last time we went was a couple of months ago and had a great time.  This time it was even better.  We started with the Shrimp and achieve Dumplings.  These are fresh made (not from the freezer).  They were the size of a golf ball.  Very full of flavor and fresh.  For entrees we had the Sichaun Fish with Spicy Garlic Sauce and Peppered Beef with Asparagus.  The Sichaun Fish was amazing.  Never had a fish dish like this before.  Very delicate fish perfectly cooked with a medium spice garlic oil sauce.  The Peppered Beef was a great compliment with the fish.  The beef is very tender and nice crispy asparagus.  After a couple of dinners at Red Mansion, I have to say it is the best Chinese food in town and beats anything in Chinatown.",ABGHr-89uNNi23q28wNU_g,0,0,5,JSh44hs--ukkn3xMTc8VGg
1352563,2014-07-06,0,pIo-HDaY6CBRlsJr8Id3Ig,"Ordered three types of shrimp dumplings.  None of them special. One type had six pieces, one four and the other two, but cut into four pieces.  The type with six pieces was cold.  
Ordered crispy beef, because others said good, beef chow fun and salt and pepper shrimp.  Crispy beef had no taste; if I tasted it with my eyes closed, I never would have known it was beef, but it was crispy. Salt and pepper shrimp were peeled shrimp (no head) covered with bread crumbs.  Beef chow fun was the best of all the dishes, but certainly not worth the trip.
Room was pretty and casino didn't smell of smoke. Really wanted to like food, but I just couldn't. Very sorry.",29PE0SAW30CVFNEIs3WwTg,0,0,2,ZhbMxj9ZU9CfNAvNUtaPEw
1374449,2014-06-25,0,pIo-HDaY6CBRlsJr8Id3Ig,"This was an amazing restaurant:
It's a quaint room, good for a date or a double date. The red decor and old photos  seemed very boutique, something this casino gets right throughout the entire property. 
The first thing to come out was the spicy won ton soup. I was worried since I am really bad with spicy, but this was actually a delightful tingle that really is enjoyable. It's a flavor you will suddenly crave, trust me.
The next entree was the garlic fried shrimp, it's heavy but so good. If there wasn't for the fact that tons more food was on its way, I would have broke my diet with this dish alone.
The dim sum then followed which is each handcrafted by an artist in the back; his one job is to make these and it's amazing. Recommended for sure!
Quickly following these plates were the crispy beef, Singapore noodles, and general tso's chicken which were all the best Chinese I've had in Vegas yet. 
Red Mansion is a wonderful Chinese restaurant with an interesting atmosphere. The Downtown Grand has such a fun inviting vibe that is a blast to explore. I was lucky to meet the executive chef of the entire property who detailed Red Mansion and all the other restaurants to a great degree that really helped highlight his favorite dishes. I hope you too enjoy it!",7b5QNA9R9MRck7HVg_g51w,0,0,5,RNaqiqE1V7MK3sGBczDJoA

Although the appearance from the casino floor is less than inviting (a screen or other barrier would help eliminate the closet look) the food was spectacular. We sat in a booth and quickly felt removed from the casino, although we could still hear the odd mix of music. We ordered the 7 spices calamari for an appetizer. No breading. Rich, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Main dishes: scallop in black bean sauce with broccoli and seafood chow mein with crispy noodles. Both dishes provided perfectly cooked seafood. No rubber eraser scallops here! Service was exceptional, too. We would come back to the Grand hotel just to eat here. Seriously.",UZWAXpD_jWBrqdlvzTsVhg,0,0,4,XllrmowLyzNjY6a0ag1CwA
2407995,2014-04-06,0,pIo-HDaY6CBRlsJr8Id3Ig,"You definitely must try Red Mansion at the Downtown Grand.  I heard they got off to a little bit of a rough start, but they completely revamped the menu and brought in Chef Yu who is from Beijing and cooks the ""real deal"" when it comes to Chinese food.  

The dim sum is homemade fresh everyday, which you really can tell because it doesn't look anything like the little frozen nuggets that almost every other place just thaw and fry.

The spicy wonton appetizer is very tasty and unique; I have never had anything like it in any other Chinese restaurant.  It has a special spicy flavor that is perfectly balanced and leaves you wanting more.

We almost never order kung pao chicken in Chinese restaurant because the chicken almost always is overcooked and the other ingredients bland.  That certainly was not the case here.  The beef with little, thin asparagus spears was delicious, with the perfect sear on the beef.  The crispy beef with carrots is so sweet.

The service was friendly and attentive.  We definitely will return and take some friends with us.",-47EprTYhe9IbAvplGIcpA,0,0,5,FpNdJjEF63_XqyxAGy5cvQ

We got the house lo mein, Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce and kung pao chicken. It said the kung pao chicken was spicy, but I've had spicier elsewhere. It was good. The house lo mein was a bit bland for our taste, but it wasn't bad. We liked the Chinese broccoli best.

All in all, the food was decent, but nothing that blew our minds. It's really convenient though if you're staying in the hotel and craving Chinese.",xPqMjZrlX8BKRAyREd5WuA,0,0,3,uTlpwbUFIUNfkAA5PUMIzw
2472967,2013-11-24,1,pIo-HDaY6CBRlsJr8Id3Ig,"I actually think this place deserves 3.5 stars overall. The food itself deserves 4 stars, but there were a few things that got in the way of an overall 4 star experience. The menu has lots of items but no description of any of them so you have to rely on the server for descriptions. The server was able to answer our questions about the menu. Strangely there are no drinks at all on the menu and there is no separate drink menu, but they do serve basic sodas and some beers. I don't know about anything else because, again, there was no drink menu. The decor is OK- it would be much improved if they replaced the laminate topped tables with real wood and pulled the 2-seater tables away from the wall. Nobody wants to eat against a wall all scrunched up like that. Interestingly, this restaurant is not directly connected to the kitchen. I think they must share a kitchen with the restaurant next door, Stewart + Ogden. This didn't cause any problems or anything, it was just unusual. The food was good. I ordered the kung pao chicken (not as spicy as described) and the flavor was good. My husband liked the mongolian beef and my son loved the potstickers. We'll probably be back, at least for takeout.",zMKFlb9Rn5sQjnQ3PsEavA,2,0,3,2nSkXjY9QeSCATmz3xKPDw
2812523,2014-01-11,0,pIo-HDaY6CBRlsJr8Id3Ig,"The food was good; fancier than something you'd get on Spring Mountain, but not necessarily better, especially at the prices they're charging. The flavors seemed authentic enough. 

I ordered the steamed tofu and fish. The plate came out hot, but oddly the fish was lukewarm, and the tofu underneath it was cold. The waiter took it back and apparently they just reheated the same dish instead of making it over. As a result, the fish was not as perfectly cooked as when it came out the first time although everything was warmer. Granted, perfectly steamed fish is not an easy thing to do, but if it's on the menu I assume they know what they're doing.  The flavor and quality of fish was good, I just wish the execution was better. 

We also had the pot stickers, lettuce wrap, and a vegetable fried rice. All were good though the number of lettuce leaves were too few.

The service is great. Than, our waiter, was efficient and friendly. 

I want this place to succeed. It's basically the only real Chinese restaurant within walking distance. 

I should mention that if you're a local, you eat at 50% off though I don't know if that's a temporary promotion.",nSdX4W2Ze8G59Qz277uwow,1,0,3,5SwiLM9QQ656nzaCuOqifA

It was fantastic...dripped in sweet sauce with strawberries and steamed white rice.  It was delicious.  They offered a local discount. Not sure if it is all the time or not.

3412420,2014-02-04,0,pIo-HDaY6CBRlsJr8Id3Ig,"Red Mansion is located in the new Grand hotel in Downtown, Las Vegas. It sits right next to the Stewart + Ogden restaurant. The restaurant is a bit small, but cozy. It's decor has a red and black Asian theme with really simple and modern lighting. 

My coworkers and I went to Red Mansion for lunch on Chinese New Year. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special for $10.00. This lunch includes a lunch-size portion of Kung Pao, a side of rice and an egg roll. The chicken was tender, but I found it a but under seasoned. They were generous with the sauce on the dish, but the ratio of veggies vs. chicken left something to be desired. The white rice was fluffy and not dry. And, the egg roll I found to be a bit bland. All in all, the food wasn't memorable. 

I would say though, we were seated quickly and the service was good. Overall, good service experience, but I'm not sure I'd proactively seek this place out again.  Oh, and our meal didn't come with a fortune cookie:-(",d_DPeh-LX77efXj6fiMLhw,0,0,3,aIjmo0cfHuvnS916tpypQg

Tried the pan-fried pot stickers (awesome!) for an appetizer. Went with crispy beef with carrots and also General Taos chicken (bland!), and some combo noodles for the main dishes. For drink we had their tea, which we loved.

I guess most Chinese restaurants use froZen stuff, but if I'm going to eat junk I'll spend about $50 less and eat it at Panda Express.

Each dish we ordered, (see attached pix), were very satisfying and individually delicious! It was actually very fresh, and they didn't taste alike.  As some Chinese restaurants do.  Even my mom was impressed, and she's a picky eater! The service were top notch. Very alert, very accommodating, very friendly!  I'm definitely coming back to dine here!  For 50% off, for any restaurants inside the Downtown Grand, for the month of January?  You can't beat that!  I'd pay regular price for it!  Ignore the negative reviews. Get up, go there, try their food, and find out for yourself!  You'd love it!

Dad: You know you're my favorite son
Son: Dad, I'm your only son.

This place is  actually pretty good chinese but ...it's really the only chinese place I can think of downtown. (I can think of Thai, Japanese, even Vietnamese, but not a legitimate Chinese). Now I am not going to compare it to anything on Spring Mountain just know that if you go, you will be satisfied. It is actually one of the places on my short list right now if someone wants to know where to go eat downtown.

Now, I can't rate the service because I got take out, but the food (strawberry sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, shrimp and egg, and black peppered pork) was all gone in 10 minutes from the time I sat down to provide food for a mini gluttonous army.

It was all very average, at best. 
I love the property (the Downtown Grand) and what they seem to be trying to do with Pizza Rock and Triple George (both excellent) but this really missed the mark.
