I asked for a Medium Rare and it came more medium to well. My boyfriend made a custom burger with roasted poblano pepper, pork belly, pepper jack cheese and cajon mayo and it cam out with a Portobello mushroom... no pork belly and no poblano pepper. When the waiter tried to go over the order with him, he kept saying ""so if i bring out pork belly, we should be good?"" No... he didnt want the mushroom and my boyfriend even pointed to the ingredients he asked for. The waiter took the burger back to the kitchen, while my boyfriend thought he was going to get a fresh burger with what he asked for... and the waiter came back out about 5 mins later with the same burger... the poblano and under cooked pork belly was on it and the mushroom still remained. Thankfully he's not allergic to mushrooms. Then we waiting 20 mins for our change, which you could see the waiter with his phones flash light trying to calculate the change from $100.00 bill.

The only hard part about eating there is actually finding it, but once you do you will be rewarded. Situated next to the tower's pool, the cafe is akin to a gastropub with an impressive craft beer selection and an excellent menu of burger and sandwich options, in addition to a wide mix of appetizers, salads, and desserts. It is definitely not as crowded as most hotel restaurants in Las Vegas, and provides a great escape from the crowds. If you want a loud atmosphere with flashy visuals then this isn't the place for you. If you want amazing food, excellent drinks, friendly service, and a clean and modern design, then you should eat here ASAP.
I'm very much looking forward to eating at Cafe 6 on future trips to town - I just hope the lack of large crowds doesn't lead to a closure.",CHShkkHkOIx1tFtD_fEvkw,1,1,5,tb32A_Cav0rHS0WGqnq1NA
910406,2015-07-28,1,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"I wish I had been invited by Palms PR to come in like many of the other reviewers, but am very glad that my husband stumbled upon Cafe 6 and put it on our list of places to try.  The restaurant setup itself is casual, fun to look around, and being surrounded by the pool makes it unique (and more fun if you enjoy people watching).  All the staff were friendly and eager to make our experience a memorable one.

The menu is fun - format is entertaining and the descriptions of each item were intriguing.  Every item has a suggested beer pairing.  We started with the Beer Battered Rock Shrimp.  Unless you are allergic to shellfish, you need to try this.  5/5

The burgers are enormous and were cooked perfectly.  We ordered the Smoke House and Dr. Pepper/Shroom burgers with the waffle fries and onion rings.  Each of these items rate a 5/5 on my list.  Presentation was as fun as the menu, and we received adequate warning on how messy the Smoke House would be.

Had to stop eating when Christina mentioned dessert - she boxed up the rest of my burger and we ordered the Nutella Donuts, which came with a scoop of ice cream and 3 dipping sauces.  We actually ordered these to go, and there were brought out boxed up with a cute message on the container.  Couldn't help ourselves though, and tried a couple before we left the table.  4.5/5

Oh, I also bypassed the beer for the Vanilla Bean milkshake (I'm a sucker for shakes), and it was worth every sip!  5/5

5 stars - great food, great service, great location.  If I had to note the one ""but"" it would be that  our bill was a little hefty, but when we go out, we don't usually order as much food as we did on this visit.  Couldn't help it, though - everything looked so good, and Cafe 6 delivered.",8NKodygfBhDQHSZUyhOXSg,1,1,5,taDpIY7Al4TskgAxkCUtzQ

1190219,2016-09-21,0,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"I have visited Cafe 6 on a few occasions. It is always consistent and the staff is uber friendly. I have never dined in however have ordered at the bar for take out and called in orders and picked them up. The baked hard and salted pretzel is delicious. I prefer the cheese sauce my ""foodiend"" likes the mustard. Beer battered rock shrimp was okay. Not exactly exciting but worth a try. I have had the smoke out burger twice and it was delicious both times. The meat was cooked to perfection and the pretzel bun is a perfect choice of bread to hold it all together since it has barbecue sauce and cold slaw. We wanted to try the burn your face off burger one time before but it sounded so hot instead we tried the sauce on the side. That burn your face off sauce will do just that, burn your face off. I've had the onion rings and they are basic, nothing to write home about. Now that we have all the savory foods out of the way let me move on to the ""love handles"", as they call them. I am a dessert connoisseur and Cafe 6's fried cookie cutters are a little piece of heaven. Now being from Texas I get fried Oreo's every October with the State Fair. Having the ability to have them in Las Vegas on any given day, dusted with power sugar goodness is pure bliss. I order some every time I am in Vegas and will continue that tradition.

1310968,2018-03-03,2,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"This review is primarily for the service rendered by the manager ""Faith"" who was on duty on 03/02/2018. The food and waitress/hostess service overall is pretty decent. 

On the day prior, I had phoned in a takeaway order for two burgers, and their usually superb pretzel appetizer. My girlfriend and I picked up our order from the waitress (middle aged Asian female) & left a good sized tip (50+ total $) and made our way to a work conference within the Palms. Upon opening the food bag at the conference I noticed that it lacked the pretzel appetizer. It's not a big deal to me as I understand issues happen. 

Since I'm staying at the Palms Hotel which contains this establishment, I stop by to notify them of the above and to possibly procure the pretzel appetizer. 

After advising the hostess (younger female White) who was not there the day prior, she tells me she does not have the authority to comp a pretzel and says she has to get the manager to make that call. 

After waiting 5 mins, the hostess and the manager return and I again have to relay the same story. The manager Faith asks me if I had called the Cafe yesterday in which I did not, since I took my order and went straight to my work conference where we cannot make phone calls. 

Faith then asked me if I have the receipt for my order in which I did not. This order by the way was placed onto my room account and was later on my hotel receipt, so I am almost positive that she could have looked that up in their internal database. These questions asked by Faith came across in a tone that was very accusatory and skeptical, like I am trying to hustle them out of a free pretzel. 

I noticed the very nice waitress who had handled my order and pointed her out to the manger in order to verify that I had indeed placed an order. She recognized us and greeted us then said that the hostess (older female White) from the day before called our room after we had left with our food because she had gotten the order confused; the hostess got our pretzel burger bun and pretzel appetizer discombobulated. It happens, again I understand. The waitress also advised that we were not charged for the pretzel appetizer. Side note: once this scenario was over, and I went back to my room, I did not see a blinking red light or message on my hotel phone. 

Anyway, to make a long story longer, Faith, the manager appeared to be delighted to hear this updated news from the waitress and her dour appearance changed to one of pleasure. Obviously after seeing how this whole order was a boondoggle, the hostess then said to Faith, ""should I go ahead and get them their pretzel now?"" in which Faith responded, ""No. They never paid for one in the first place"".  There was then a brief period of awkward silence between all involved parties due to Faith's response and I interjected with a ""Alright. Thanks for everyone's help. I'm going to move on"". 

I am very dismayed at Faith's lack of leadership, ownership of her employee's performance and most of all, her communication toward customers. If I were in her shoes, I would have apologized for the mishap, refunded the food or offered a new one and then out of public view, reviewed the incident with the involved employees and ensured this would not happen again, or place procedures in place to ensure proper future performance. 

I stay at the Palms Hotel frequently and have eaten at the Cafe in the past but after this incident, I will no longer partake in their services. Thank you.",60B4tI69dWCNChh6-cEs2g,1,0,1,D4DPSRLK-VrECVftWzZ7lQ

This was a To Go and they forgot all the dipping sauces for the chicken tenders- I mean, come on- and the ice cream that comes with fried oreos came in the smallest container possible it was less than half the size of a Dixie cup! Not enough for even two people! They should have at least gave us two small containers of the ice cream.

1416543,2018-03-04,0,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"Overall, pretty good but not worth a trip off the strip for.

This restaurant is in the Palms.  It's actually pretty hard to find, even with signage.  Pretty out of the way.  It's a big bright room with glass walls and plenty of sun.  With the pool drained (and being serviced) and no-one outside, the view suffered, however.  

Service was ""okay"".  Brought an iced tea with absolutely no ice in it.  The vibe in there at lunch was pretty dead.  

The burgers are the highlight.  Very big and quite good.  Also, they have a tarro bun as an option which is pretty unique.  My wife really liked that they offered that.  Portions are sizeable.  

A tad expensive.  If you're in the Palms anyway, Cafe 6 is a solid choice.  But if you're there anyway, go to the Palms buffet instead, it's less expensive and quite good.",Xvwb8R5_pl_smDIH7I3Vww,2,0,3,ipCjSuPrvDPVP-yJRPptfw

1459624,2015-07-16,18,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"Cafe 6 is the new cafe inside of the Palms Place casino. It replaces the Simon restaurant that was there for a long time. I wanted to check out what was different, and what was the same. There are some similarities, plus some differences, so I will go into detail.

This restaurant is located on the 6th floor of the Palms Place. There is self parking and valet options all around, so just take the elevator to the 6th floor when you come inside of Palms Place. After walking through to the restaurant, I was immediately sat by the hostess, given my menu, and my server came by shortly and asked about my drink order. Looking around the restaurant, I noticed that they didn't do a major overhaul of the dining room, which is a good thing because the dining room does look elegant and comfortable, with great views of the pool and people watching.

While perusing the menu, I noticed that the humorously whimsical Kerry Simon menu has been replaced by a simpler, more straightforward one, with a focus on being more casual and approachable. There is a wide variety of crowd pleasing favorites such as burgers, salads, sandwiches, as well as appetizers including chicken wings, and pretzels. 

I came in during lunch time, and during that time I was handed a drink menu that was full of standard beers, but also had a large selection of craft ones. I chose an IPA called Le Freak by a brewery in California called Green Flash. It was a hoppy beer that complimented my meal very well. The server took my food order and I waited for my food.

There seemed to be a mixup in the ordering when my food arrived. I had ordered a couple appetizers and a burger meal. The burger came out first, rather than the appetizers. I didn't really mind since I'm not crazy anal like that, but my preference would be the other way around on most occasions.   

So first, the burger. I ordered the Land and Sea. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, just as I had requested. It was also seasoned well, and was hot and juicy. I could tell that they are using quality beef for their burgers. The crab dynamite was fresh. The condiments were subtle and very fresh, and the bun was toasted nicely, and held its shape very well. There is a choice of fries that comes with all the burgers, and I chose the waffle fries. They were hot and crispy, and seasoned well.

Next were my appetizers. I ordered the chicken wings and beer battered rock shrimp. First, the wings. They used the big sized ones, which I appreciated. They were good wings, and sauced well. As for the rock shrimp, the batter was light and crispy, and the rock shrimp were fresh and of good quality. Here's a tip, eat the shrimp together with the celery, you're welcome.

My server was really good, she asked if I was doing well and if the food was good, which it was. I thought they had priced their menu extremely well, taking into consideration that this is a casino restaurant.

Suffice to say, I was really pleased with my meal, and would come back again. This is a spot that's making very solid food, with good quality product. The service is good and I enjoyed myself here.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,27,24,4,ciQhsE6OSURbDKo09LfXRQ

Part of the beauty of this restaurant is that it's slightly tucked away and not street level. Not even lobby level to a busy hotel. There are no views of the street or Vegas foot traffic. Only a beautiful view of the pool in a very relaxed setting. Definitely a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Vegas - not a place to experience Vegas. The restaurant itself looks like it could be used for a fine dining establishment, but it's definitely more casual dining. 

I used the 2 for $26 build your own burger groupon deal which came with a flight of 6 beers (to share) - you can choose any of the beers on the menu which is great for people like me who prefer the ciders and specialty fruity drinks. 

I got the turkey burger and my boyfriend got the beef. I preferred the beef to the turkey. The turkey seemed to just crumble apart. The beef was ordered medium well but was VERY VERY pink, but I'm not one to send things back unless it's basically not edible or not what I ordered. The flavors of the burgers were still really good. Slightly annoying that putting a sauce on it was an extra $1 to an already $14 burger. 

The mac & cheese was the best up charge decision I've ever seen be made (again, ordered by my boyfriend and better than my onion rings). 

It was good food and good service in a cute setting but for the prices (I saw the check without the deal) I probably wouldn't be back sans the groupon deal. Maybe just to try the dessert.",2kMMpWAhwLxTsP9-AKKp8A,0,0,4,TdJkNU3w0VaSXpW1FDMQ2g

It said to me that they lack staff. Given that we had to walk 5mins from the main part of the Palms to get to this place, we stayed. Our server (I think the only server in the place was great (nice, talkative and offered good recommendations and feedback).

Food: 3/5: my party of 3 got the various burgers. Underseasoned burgers, but tasty and the fries were good. 

Service: 2/5: server was good, but we didn't see him much given how stretched he was. I checked into Yelp for this place and never got the desert we asked for. I believe had we asked again for it, we would have gotten it, but didn't not want to wait 20 mins for it.

The placed was a bit sad since they probably don't get enough food old coming through due to the location and therefore cannot hire enough staff. This will eventually shut this place down. Knowing this, I will not return and would rather try Chronic tacos or Earl of sandwich at the food court at the Palms.",YNaqHkvszSjCWL534ju-jg,1,0,2,zI4h8OsF_bNpdEgXSQJj9g

The service was great and she was extremely friendly. The scene/venue was nice. We sat along the window where on the other side lies a pool that kind of wraps around the restaurant. It was nice and I had a good view... *giggidy*

The beer battered shrimp was awesome. It certainly had a kick but it was perfect. 5/5

My wife had a vanilla bean and it was delicious. 5/5

get her burger was good too, she ordered the Dr Pepper /mushroom burger. She gave it a 5/5, it was more like a 4/5 to me.

I had a smoke burger and that was DA BOMB. It was big, juicy and messy. 5/5

1999506,2015-08-10,5,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"I loved the décor and poolside setting when this spot was Simon's, but service was terrible. Glad to see that Café 6 has tasty burgers and a total turnaround in the service department- but the cuisine doesn't really fit the spa-like locale. That said, I'd still keep this spot in mind for a great burger.

FRIED PICKLES: These are spears instead of the expected chips, perfectly crisp and served with a trio of dipping sauces (an acidic ranch, a sweet bbq, and a spicy sriracha). Interesting presentation features vinegar chips under the pickles? 
THE WEDGIE: More like a wedge salad mated with a BLTA sandwich, minus the bread. Presentation deconstructed the wedge to more manageable pieces,  with generous amounts of avocado and bleu cheese, two slices of bacon. One of the few fresh/healthy options, lots of textural contrast, would get again.

MINI BURGERS
TURKEY SNACK: Turkey burger with lettuce, avocado, swiss, and apple-cranberry marmalade on a Taro bun. The purple taro bun is fun and slightly sweet, tastes like a Hawaiian roll. This is a great turkey burger, surprisingly juicy.
BACON BLEU: Angus patty with bacon (allegedly, didn't detect any on ours?), bleu cheese sauce, LTO, on brioche bun. Lovely buttery bun and an incredibly strong sauce, burger was juicy, a bite of perfection.
TOADSTOOL SWISS: Angus patty with roasted portabella, caramelized onion, lettuce, swiss, Dijon mustard, house-made ketchup. The burger I'd most anticipated was underwhelming. Portabella lacked flavor, mustard didn't really harmonize with other ingredients, small chopped onions were falling all over the plate and didn't stay on the burger.

FULL-SIZE BURGER
DR. PEPPER SHROOM BURGER: Huge, thick Angus patty with roasted portabella, white cheddar, caramelized onion, Dr. Pepper glaze, Dijon mustard on brioche bun. The full sized burgers are gigantic! Aside from our cooking issues (below), the sweet Dr. Pepper glaze worked better than expected and added to the mushrooms' savory meatiness. Really enjoyed the flavors of this burger. 
WAFFLE FRIES: These are perfectly crisp and wonderfully seasoned, served with a spicy ketchup with a lot of kick. I ate way too many of these, enjoying them more than any other version in recent memory.

NUTELLA DONUTS: Puffy donut holes, dusted in cinnamon-sugar and served with a trio of sauces (the crème anglaise being my favorite). Nutella filling was a good amount, not overflowing, happy my BF pushed to order these despite my not being a dessert fan.  

I recommend the Trio of Sliders ($14), which allows you to try more burger styles, though the giant patty of the full-size burger is a good value. The sliders were cooked perfectly, whereas our full-sized burger was served first overcooked (to well done) then redone to practically rare. If you're charging $15/burger, every one should be cooked perfectly- an area to improve upon.

Service was fairly good: lots of positive staff around to check up on us, they had no problem remaking our burger or upselling drinks, apps, and desserts. Now if only they could get people in the door! Despite a Friday evening date-night, there were few diners here and they were mostly older groups. Location away from the casino floor plus $15 burgers (pricey for some) doesn't really help. Hoping this place lasts as a concept (as I want to return for the bbq brisket burger!) , but it doesn't really fit the location.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,5,4,wM5MmprzNP8L22RcPLgD5A

We passed on those, and had gone to nearby Izakaya Cocokala a couple nights in a row.  However, we wanted to change it up and heard from some pals who had dined at Café 6 the previous night that we would like it.

I built my own burger and ordered a bunless (they call it 'topless') veggie burger topped with pepper jack and a roasted  poblano pepper.  I was pleased when the veggie burger ended up being a roasted corn and black bean number and was transported to a very messy (get the bun, yo) but tasty mexi-inspired heaven.  But considering they have fish burgers, chicken burgers, and more, there is undoubtedly no end to the delish you could inspire for yourself.

And my boo got the fried chicken that was enticing enough for me to sample--even though I avoid eating the land animals these days.  It was ridic.

Fries were just whatever, but served in cutesy deep fryer baskets that I appreciated.

Well made burger that's difficult to eat - but you get to choose from a good selection of beer and have a great conversation.


Thanks to Groupon we were able to try this place. 
The menu is short - a good sign the kitchen knows what they're doing with the few ingredients. 
Which is what I got: the salmon in the burger was cooked very well. Moist, juicy and what looked like a large portion. But it was a filet on a pretzel bun (-_-)

It didn't fit the bun, and when I pressed it down the juices came out. In the end I ate my juicy burger with a knife and fork.

2477808,2017-07-18,0,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"We selected Cafe 6 because we were attending a concert at the Pearl Theater downstairs, (CHIC!), and as we looked for places close to the venue, we found out that the two closest had been closed for renovations. So Cafe 6 it was.

I've never been to a restaurant before, where the pool was located directly outside! One thing's for sure: if you love people-watching, you will get your fill and then some.  It was very busy poolside when we were there - probably because it was Saturday. But the important thing was getting some good food and getting it in a timely fashion before the show, and our server, Alejandro, made sure that happened and then some.

I would come back for just two items: the Chicken Salad sliders, which contain an awesome filling so scrumptious, that it should be devoted to its own oversized sandwich, and the Mini Pretzel Bites, which tasted like they had only been taken from the oven about thirty seconds ago. The garlic butter and honey mustard dipping sauces were the perfect accompaniment for them. 

Both of us had burgers for the main course, and they were delicious, though neither one of us could finish the huge beef bombs...mostly because we OD'ed on apps, too (three more besides the two I already mentioned.) 

Being at Palms Place, Cafe 6 was NOT convenient at all to the theater, but it doesn't mean it wasn't worth stopping out of our way for.  We would definitely bring out-of-town friends here for something different, and away from the Strip.",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,1,0,4,UoYTnEpiVzL7UxJM_bbd3A

Signs will point you westward, but when you walk you will eventually end up in the parking lot with no indication that this place exist.

It seems like another burger joint, but much much higher than fastfood on on the quality scale with the high end burger places on the strip but a more reasonable price.  A very nice view of the pool is a plus and the services is nice, friendly and reasonably fast. I went on a Saturday evening during March Madness and only a few tables were filled.

2662753,2015-07-22,41,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"This super secret restaurant, located on the 6th floor of Palms Place (not Palms Casino) is a fantastic hidden gem. The decor is upscale-casual, but that's what you come to expect in a Vegas hotel-burger restaurant. The loft style restaurant also comes equipped with a separate bar & lounge area. Upon sitting down in our booth, I was enchanted by the sparkling poolside dining view.

Our server, Stacy, was beyond amazing. She was extremely attentive and took care of us all evening. Actually, we received impeccable service from all of the staff working that evening. Kudos to the management for flawless training - I can't speak enough on how fantastic they pride themselves with customer service; certainly a great environment to get away from a stressful work week.

We sampled a few tasty delights on the menu:

* BAKED HARD & SALTED 14oz SOFT PRETZEL with Dijon Mustard & Warm Cheese Sauce $9.95
It comes out piping hot & fresh out of the oven. Might need to give it a moment before you dig in! We enjoyed the both dips & had a lot of leftovers. Rated: 3/5

* CHICKEN WINGS $10.95
Shaved Onions, Choice of Sauce: Burn Your Face Off, Sweet Thai Chili or Buffalo. We requested the wings to come undressed and all of the sauces on the side. Man! They weren't kidding when they said the ""burn your face off"" is hot! It's because it's pure habanero puree. Whew, my mouth & stomach lining hurts just writing about it. My favorite had to be the sweet Thai chili, I think the buffalo was a tad too vinegary to taste and although I love spicy food, the habanero was like just biting into a habanero chili, versus an actual complex sauce. I'm still a fan though, the wings were cooked expertly - So juicy & crispy! Rated: 5/5

* SMOKE OUT $17.95 - 
Juicy Angus Beef, BBQ Brisket, Cole Slaw, Fried Onions, Sweet Molasses BBQ Sauce all on a soft Pretzel Bun! This burger is the BOSS of the evening. The patty was massive and cooked perfectly! The sweet molasses BBQ sauce really tied everything together. Rated: 5/5

* LAND & SEA $19.95
Angus Beef, Crab Dynamite, Red Onions, Fennel, Arugula, Breakfast Radishes, Havarti Cheese, Tomato Tartar Sauce, Hawaiian Sweet Bun.
First impressions: 
-cooked to medium rare perfection, just as we requested
-stayed super juicy
-an overall gourmet burger
A unique idea, however, compared to the Smoke Out, this burger had a prominent salt flavor, with no other balance of seasoning coming through. As a result, the saltiness overwhelmed the other delicate toppings on the burger such as the arugula, fennel, radish, and unfortunately the crab topping as well. We enjoyed it, but would rather try something else on the menu before tackling this guy again. Rated: 4/5

* ONION RINGS - Giant rings coated in golden batter. Rated: 3/5
* WAFFLE FRIES - Perfectly seasoned and crispy. Rated: 5/5

* STRAWBERRY SHAKE $10.95 -
Strawberry Ice Cream, Fresh Strawberries, Freeze Dried Strawberries, Aged Balsamic, Cookie Straw. I loved that it wasn't a sugar bomb. I also enjoyed the fresh strawberries & the texture of the freeze dried strawberries. I just wished the aged balsamic flavor was bold. I didn't even know it was in there until I re-read the menu description! Rated: 3/5

I know, it's another burger joint to add to the books, but I really appreciate how this place feels like a private getaway. I need to mention that they have a unique menu offering that caught our attention, they have purple Taro Bread Buns for the burgers! I am intrigued and want to try that next time. The service and ambiance put this place over the top for us and we really enjoyed our dining experience here.

PRO TIP: 
EASY: Enter through Palms Place & go up to the 6th floor.
HARD: If you are coming from the Palms Hotel & Casino, walk towards Palms Place - Take the elevator up towards the Sky-Tube - Once you reach the opposite side of the Sky-Tube, take the first elevators you see to the the 6th floor.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,56,53,4,WHPQadOerGzJzN-dyg_Dyg

They conveniently have a bar area with 2 tv screens which are great for guests such as myself to enjoy some Monday Night Football. They also have many options for indoor seating as well as outdoor seating. I noticed that there was a nice cozy fireplace outdoors which can quite romantic. 

I opt for bar area seating since I wanted to catch the game. Service was very slow. The bartender who was on shift was too busy talking to the only other customer there. I was staring her down in order to get my order in. Throughout the night I felt like service could improve, but she was too busy gossiping about with the other customer and her fellow coworkers. 

Anyways, I ordered Chicken Salad Sliders ($5) from their Mini Snackins menu. It includes 2 sliders with crispy toasted brioche bun and chicken salad filling. The brioche bun was great. I liked the lettuce and tomato... however the HUGE chunks of raw red onions in the chicken salad filling was a turn off. Usually chicken salads have FINELY chopped onions, but this one had chunks of raw red onions and it was gross. I had to pick out all of the red onion pieces to save myself from onion breath... And I super brushed my teeth a few times and chewed gum when I got back to my room. 

For desserts I ordered a Caramelized Banana Split ($9.95) because I was in the mood for ice cream and I like the variety of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla ice cream. I didn't care too much for the whip cream, the oreos, the wafer, the weird nasty tasting chocolate twig or the cherry. The banana was good too.

APPETIZER:
Beer Battered Rock Shrimp-strips of carrots and celery mixed in a Tabasco Ranch dressing. OH MY. This was freakin delicious!!!!! Portions was perfect for an appetizer...for small eaters like myself, this is enough to get your half-full....even if this was shared. I would totally order this as an entrée. It's THAT good.

BURGERS:
Short Rib ""Sloppy Joe""- $15.95. Angus Beef, 100% Short Rib Pepper Joe Mix, Skinny Fries, Onion Ring, Hoagie Bun. Fried food galore. You got your skinny fries inside the burger, your big onion rings and then more fries on the side. I opted for the waffle fries. I put my remaining sloppy joe mix on top of these and mmmm.....yum!!!!!! 

They need to come up with something like waffle fries with the sloppy joe mix, pour some melted cheese on it and boom! Sloppy joe cheese waffle fries. OHHH YESS!!!

My boyfriend ordered the mini burgers (3 mini sliders) of the Bacon Bleu $13.95 which consist of Angus Beef, applewood smoked bacon, bleu cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, housemade ketchup, Brioche Bun. He really enjoyed his. He liked Café 6 more than I did actually....and he's not really a fan of burgers either. 

So why 3 stars? As much as these burgers were delicious, it didn't really give me the ""WOW at first bite."" The appetizer rocked more than my burger.

This is a larger than life warm pretzel served with melted cheese and mustard. So delicious, so warm, so buttery, so salty... so perfect. So yea, I can go on and on about this thing. Bring a friend or two to share... or be selfish and order all for yourself. Shh, I won't tell.

Another stand out dish is The Poolside salad. This is a good entree if you're looking for something light after the heavy pretzel. It has crab, bacon, avocado, yum.

If you like a great dirty martini this place has got it. If you like comfort food this place takes it to another level. Delicious.  Let's break it down...
 
Soft pretzel: 5/5. A must!  Soft buttery and salted with mustard and cheese dipping sauces to die for! Yum!

Hot wings: 5/5 good in size. Bigger that Buffalo Wild Wings but then again that isn't saying much. We chose to have all the sauces on the side and enjoyed them all. Chicken perfectly crisp. 

Fried pickles: 4.5/5 love the dipping sauce and love how they were spears instead of the chips. 

U pick mini sliders:  5/5 great variety to chose from!  Love trying something new and that I would never make at home. Again I was not disappointed!  I did try the burn your face off chicken and loved it!  It had flavor, spice and heat!  Perfect but hen again I love spicy things! The other two I chose where the turkey snack and toadstool Swiss.  I would get those all again! 

Deep fried Oreos with ice cream: 5+/5!!!! The best I have had!  Perfectly fried with tasty sweet batter with soft Oreo in the middle. Chocolate and raspberry sauces for dipping. Omg!!!!! Heaven!  

Can't wait to go back!!!! Service was great and food to die for.  Comfort food at its best!",hJqBNS5Tdo9Du-s3DDpMqw,5,3,5,3GkERwDhCiUuwaRSybaG-A
2847301,2015-11-30,2,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"My wife and I stayed at the Palms recently while attending a friend's event. This particular hotel is home to a few fairly well-regarded restaurants. When we arrived, however, it was lunchtime and so the N9NE Steakhouse and NOVE Italiano restaurants were not open. I asked the lady at the concierge desk where a good place for lunch would be. She suggested Cafe 6 on the 6th floor at Palms Place. I stated that we were not in the mood for ""bar food."" Her reaction was priceless! She stiffened a bit and looked as if I had spat in her face. ""Sir, Cafe 6 does not serve 'bar food'. It serves gourmet sandwiches; the very ones you see in these posters,"" (pointing to a Cafe 6 advertisement poster.)

So we went there and tried it. Unfortunately, it actually was bar food, and not very good bar food at that. If I had been in the mood for that, I might have enjoyed it a bit more.

My wife got a ""Turkey Dinner"" which was a turkey burger with avocado on a Taro bun. You will know the Taro bun by its deep purple color and horrifying taste. Also, her burger was undercooked and we had to send it back.

I got the ""Build Your Own"" burger, but you can't erect a mansion with clay and old 2x4's. Despite looking pretty good, it was just...not. In addition, my burger was also undercooked and had to be sent back as well. The accompanying fries were salty, greasy and largely inedible.

2911741,2016-04-08,8,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"Taking the space that was previously occupied by Simon, You will find Cafe 6 on the 6th floor at Palms Place. I never had the pleasure of dining at Simon, so this was my first time in the room. The space is light and casual with a fantastic view of the pool! This makes for a more quiet, comfortable and intimate setting.

We were quickly greeted by our wonderful hostess and seated at a table with a fantastic view of poolside! Our server, Carmen, quickly approached us with suggestions and recommendations on things we should try. Carmen was fantastic! Extremely sweet, personable, and engaging, she helped to make our experience at Cafe 6 an outstanding one!

We first ordered some drinks and a couple of appetizers. We opted for an order of Chicken Wings ($10.95) with some ""Burn Your Face Off""(lol) and Buffalo sauce. We also decided to try some Buttermilk Chicken Tenders ($10.95), also with an assortment of dipping sauces on the side. The wings were outstanding! They were plump and juicy, with plenty of meat on the bones! Just awesome! Some of the best wings I've had in a while! The chicken tenders were also great. Again, very tender and juicy with the skin just slipping off the meat as you bit into it! So, so tasty!

The manager, Michelle, approached our table to both introduce herself and see how we were enjoying ourselves. I absolutely love when managers take a genuine interest in their guests and how their experience is going. This was a nice touch and greatly appreciated.

We next enjoyed one of the Baked 14 oz Soft pretzels($9.95)! This thing was MASSIVE! Honestly, this was one of my favorite menu items here and second only to my burger! It was so soft and tasty! We plowed through that thing in no time! We will DEFINITELY be back for more of that soon!

Last, but certainly not least, we each enjoyed a tasty burger! How can we not?? I opted for the Dr. Pepper Mushroom Burger cooked medium rare ($15.95)(w/ a side of waffle fries), while my friend chose to enjoy the Smoke Out Burger ($17.95)(w/ a side of onion rings). 

WOW!

I LOVED my burger! The angus beef was cooked to perfection and full of so much flavor, my burger was incredible! My favorite menu item of the day! The Dr Pepper glaze was not overwhelming, as I had feared it might. In fact, it seemed to bring out all the flavor of the burger with the mushrooms and caramelized onions! Superb! My friend raved about his burger and had mentioned that it was the best burger he had eaten in this town in a long time! Safe to say we were both VERY satisfied. 

We were both pretty stuffed by this point, but had to try at least one desert! So, on Michelle's recommendation, we tried the Fried Cookie Cutter ($9.95). A combonation of vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate ganache, and....wait for it....

Deep Fried Oreos!

lol So incredibly delicious! 

Cafe 6 offers up scrumptious food at great prices, with outstanding service to boot! Suffice it to say that I am a fan and will be back for countless visits. There is still so much on the menu I have to try out!

Woohoo! As good as it gets!

2940375,2017-09-11,0,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"Terrible experience last night.  

We stopped in here because of a Living Social deal for 2 Flights of Beer and 2 Build your own Burgers.  Can't beat that deal, right?

To start, when we arrived at the front there was no one at the hostess stand to direct you and when someone did show up they didn't bother to ask about any seating preferences.  We asked to sit in the bar area as it was Sunday Night Football.  There were plenty of seats - it was 6 pm in Vegas and quite early.  

The next problem was that ""flights of craft beer"" here are actually just 2 bottle beers for each person.  They have no draft beer.  When I hear flight, I expect small tasting size samples of multiple beers.  Not one beer poured from a bottle and then another delivered once that is finished.  Also, when we first ordered there were 4 beers on the list not available.  Our waitress came back after we selected those to let us know one of our selections was gone.  It was already a thin list, with choices like Blue Moon and Sam Adams (fine beers, but again,not what I expected from a craft beer flight).  By the time she came to bring our second round yet another of our choices ""ran out 3 bottles ago.""  The lack of communication about availability between the bar, our server, and us was absurd.  

The lack of server attention didn't stop at conveying beer availability.  After taking our order, and having to come back with mustard and ketchup, we didn't see her again until she brought the bad news about the beer.  No refills on water, or checking in on us.  The food was good quality, but if you build your own burger practically every topping is extra.  It cost $3 for avocado and mayo.  The best food of the night was the spicy shrimp, the one item we didn't intend on getting.

Clearly I'm not their target audience, but maybe they shouldn't be trying to lure people in with ""craft beer flight"" deals.",_s2-f_tDt05DDXAeR5PUHw,2,1,1,35UTxvea_2oRIb7x-ZT1DQ

They have a cute menu with burgers, sammiches, fries, salads, and even some dessert which they call love handles. I decided to grab a couple different items and try everything I could with some coworkers. 
We orders the U-Pick burger trio. First was burn your face off, second was the turkey snack, and last was the belly wash. The burn your face off was hot and tasty. The turkey looked funny with the taro bun, which is blueish purple, but was very tasty. The apple cranberry dressing was good. Lastly the belly wash was my favorite. Beef and BBQ sauce, what more can you ask for. We also order the BLTA stack. A BLT with avocado, total winner. It also came with a side of fries, we go the waffles fries. It also comes with their house made ketchup. Super yummy. Last but not least we ordered some wangs. We decided to get the sauce on the side. We decided to try the sweet Thai chili. They were very good. We could have just got them on there. It was a filling delicious meal. I'm really excited to try more items.

Service. Great! Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and fun. The only drawback being when she brought the check, she showed us the total ($50+), then said she had to get a manager to apply the Groupon - which took over 10 minutes. I mean why not do this upfront?   

Food. One of the best burgers we've ever had: perfectly cooked to order and absolutely delish! Onion rings were very good, waffle fries were meh. But the homemade Sriracha Ketchup was killer! 

Beverages. The flight of beer was good - but interestingly they were not on-tap. Which meant opening 6 bottles - but only using a portion (about 4oz I guess). Strange.

It's located inside the Palms hotel and I come here every Monday with my family for movie night. I've been seeing the billboards on the side of the road and the ads for the Turkey Dinner burger in the elevators and my mouth was watering wanting to try it. My boyfriend is never in the mood for burgers when we visit Palms but this Labor Day I finally harassed him enough and he said yes we'll go here for dinner. So after the movies we trecked our way through the long hallways to Cafe 6 to try this burger they so avidly have been advertising. It opens at 5pm so we got there a few minutes after 5pm and first impression was beautiful but empty. The decor is setup like a small restaurant with a lounge feel with a view of the spa pool and brick columns with digital fireplaces on display. There is a bar with three LCD TV screens showing three different sports games and one bartender. The lady who greeted us was also our Waitress and she did not mention this so at first I wasn't sure we should order with her but after bringing our drinks she starting taking food orders so I guess. 

Now on to the food, we ordered buffalo hot wings and the ""Turkey Dinner"" burger with skinny fries. I had a Sauvignon Blanc and my boy had a beer. My Sauvignon Blanc came out first and it was extremely sour aka cheap even for a house wine. I imagine this is what those dollar store wines taste like! So I stuck to the water. The buffalo wings came out after and I had a few they were regular as I expected but I'm not a fan of hot wings so this was mainly my bf's dish. After eating a couple he pulled out a wing and showed me a wing with a huge patch of fried chicken hair. Gross! Don't you fully clean the chicken before cooking? Then my Turkey Dinner arrived and it looked nothing like the posters. I know that photographers photo shop but kudos to the photog because this burger looked completely different! The ""meat"" was gray and so was the bun. I bit into it and stopped mid-bite. What I had just tasted my brain couldn't comprehend. The taste or lack there of was horrendous! Dry, flavorless and yuck, just Yuck! I have never tasted something that bad ever! That was not turkey meat and I eat tofu and veggie burgers and they still have never tasted like that so I don't know what kind of mystery meat that was! I still can't barely explain just how bad it was. Tasted like how I imagine diabetic hospital food would taste! No seasoning, bland, not fresh and just not good! I quickly grabbed the sour white wine to swallow my bite. I thought maybe it's just the initial bite so I cleansed my pallet with the glass of water and fries and tried again. I took two more bites but on my last third bite I decided not to submit my tastebuds to such torture and gave up. I downed the glass of sour wine to get the taste of my tongue and asked for the check. 

Another reason why I gave up was because on my last bite I noticed some gray fatty matter from the burger. I lifted up the bun to find even more gray fatty matter coming from the burger! Ewe how could you put that in with the burger doesn't the Chef inspect the food after he cooks it and sends it out? I so wanted to like this place and this burger but I declare that the person in the kitchen must be a line cook and not a real Chef because no self-respecting Chef that loves food and loves what he/she does would send out something that grotesque! Now I know why this place was so empty. You have a beautiful space and amazing advertisements but I suggest instead of spending thousands of dollars on those giant billboards you spend your money and figure out what's going on going on inside that kitchen because if that is how bad your promotional dish tastes I shudder to think how the rest of the food on the menu tastes! The only thing that was good i.e. safe was the water and skinny fries.

The pretzel was insanely large.... Maybe enough for a whole table to share for their entire meal...definitely hit the spot when combined with their well above average (if slightly pricey) beer selection. 

My last adventure: the burn your face off burger. Yes, that's really what it's called. The manager personally came out to warn me that if I wasn't in the mood for something very spicy, I should get the sauce on the side. I told them to bring it as is and keep the waters coming. As expected, this was freaking hot. Not terribly over the top though. The habanero sauce and the roasted pepper on the burger gave it a sweet and spicy taste that made it not only bearable, but enjoyable. It did make me want to go stick my face in the pool though.

Got a groupon for 2 build your own burgers & two beer flights - they didn't have the beer flights, instead were given 3 12oz beers. They were ""out"" of the beers we really wanted. 

Food is OK. Sweet potato fries are bland- it'd be nice to have some seasoning on top. The Cajun Mayo tasted like nothing. The turkey burger was odd with the avocado - the meat itself was good.

I had a question about the Burn Your Face Off burger and with Alejandro's description, I opted to go with something that would leave my face in tact--overhaul though it needs.  I ordered the Land and sea burger which the menu describes as Angus Beef, CRAB DYNAMITE, Red Onions, Fennel, Arugula, Breakfast Radishes, Havarti Cheese, Tomato Tartar Sauce, Hawaiian Sweet Bun.  I asked for it rare and that's the way it came.  My wife ordered the Dr. Pepper/Shroom burger that the menu describes as Angus Beef, Roasted Portabella, White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, DR. PEPPER GLAZE, Dijon Mustard, Brioche Bun done medium which was the way it was done.  We each ordered skinny fries which come with your sandwich.

Both burgers were very good.  I was pleased that my burger was indeed rare, something that some restaurants are hesitant to do.  The burgers were very large--probably 8 ounces.  My burger, while having a good amount of crab, didn't have much of a crab taste.  The crab was mined and mixed with a hot sauce to be the dynamite mentioned in the menu.  There wasn't much dynamite to it, but the burger was good.  The skinny fries were salted in the kitchen and were the perfect accompaniment to the burger.

For dessert, we split the To Die For Chocolate which the menu describes as Chocolate Ice Cream, Frozen Brownie Bites, TOASTED MARSHMALLOWS, Crème Anglaise.  This was very good.  Very chocolatey--very worthy of its name!

Throughout our meal, service was top notch.  Our iced teas were refilled without needing to ask.  Alejandro was very good!

Café 6 would probably rate another star if there was more of a choice.  Except for burgers and sandwiches, there are only two ""main course"" options--salmon and steak frites--so it's a burger and sandwich café with some apps, salads, and desserts.  There is an option to build your own burger.  The price of the burgers amounts to Strip pricing in an off-Strip place.  While the room and the view of the pool are very nice, this isn't a stop I'd make.  It's much easier to get gourmet burgers in the neighborhood at more reasonable prices.  For tourists staying at the Palms or Palms Place, this is a perfectly good option.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,17,14,3,mSmkiFqklJtVorNipySuTw

4014593,2015-07-27,4,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"**Disclaimer** My family and I were invited by the Palms to experience their new Café 6 in Palms Place.  This review is based off of our overall experience of food & service.  

Upon arriving, we waited for several minutes by the host counter.  No one was present I'm guessing because an actual host wasn't there that day.  We were seated by one of the waitresses who saw us and another party near the counter.

Café 6 is hardly reminiscent of an everyday café/diner you might think of.  This was formerly a Kerry Simon joint, and it's possible some of the décor remained intact for this new place.  It's very inviting, with the fireplace, the hard woods, the serene colors, the bamboo, and of course, the POOL right outside the glass doors.  Café 6 must be popular for the lunch lounge crowd, order from the restaurant and get served by the pool.  By night time, the pool was closed and no one was around.  Café 6 itself wasn't overly busy for a Friday night, but there was a decent crowd throughout.

Our server Stacy was very on point.  Cordial, pleasant, upbeat, and courteous.  We also met restaurant manager Michelle who was equally nice and warm, attentive to anything we would need for the evening.   

Started off with the bottle libations menu and ordered an Ace Pineapple Cider by the CA Cider Company.  It came out before our meal so Stacy was kind enough to put it back on ice until our food arrived.  Service!  We dined on:

BAKED HARD & SALTED SOFT PRETZEL ($9.95) - This sucker was HUGE!  Pizza sized fresh made pretzel with a side of cheese sauce & Dijon mustard for dipping.

Deliciousness!  Really was one of my fav things of the meal.  Hard on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside.  DEVOURED.

SALTY CRUNCHY PICKLES ($6.95) - Fried pickles with Sriracha mayo, BBQ sauce & lemon-herb aioli for dipping.  

These were good as well.  I liked how they came in spear form.  Coated just right and fried, nice blend of sour & savory with good crunch.

DR. PEPPER/SHROOM ($15.95) - Angus burger with roasted portabella, white cheddar, caramelized onions, Dijon & Dr. Pepper glaze on a brioche bun.  

My little one got this.  She liked it very much!  Burger was big, juicy, with good flavor coming from the portabella.  It was light on the Dr. Pepper taste though.  Waffle fries on the side were also a highlight for her, hot & crisp with good seasoning.

U-PICK TRIO ($13.95) - Pick 3 mini Angus burgers off of the menu.  Wifey chose:  1. Toadstool Swiss: roasted portabella, caramelized onions, Swiss cheese, lettuce, Dijon & ketchup on brioche bun. 2. Bacon Bleu: applewood smoked bacon, blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion & ketchup on brioche bun. 3. Belly Wash: pork belly, coleslaw, skinny fries & BBQ sauce on brioche bun.

Fancy!  Nice presentation on a wood paddle.  Wifey liked the mini burgers very much, each flavorful even on little buns.  The Belly Wash was a standout, pork belly added an unctuous bite.  If you order the mini burgers be aware, they do NOT come with a side of fries or onion rings.  

BLTA STACK ($10.95) - Bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado & house sauce on sourdough baguette.

With the apps we ordered I went light on my main.  The BLTA sounded yummy, and I'm a club sandwich type of guy.  Café 6 wasn't kidding, this sandwich is STACKED!  Comes out to your table on one of those menu order pins, each quarter stacked on top the other.  Neat!  The sandwich itself was tasty though.  Bacon was crunchy, lettuce & tomato were crisp, and the avocado was fresh.  House sauce was akin to a 1000-Island.  But the kicker were the onion rings!  A massive side came with my sandwich.  They were great, battered just right and fried to golden brown delicious.  Perfect with their housemade ketchup.  Careful, the ketchup does have a kick!

Even with the leftovers we were packing up to take home, manager Michelle asked us to try one of their desserts.  We chose:

ICE CREAM 'BURGER' ($11.95) - Chocolate ice cream 'patty' on 'wafer' bun, with funnel cake 'fries', crème anglaise & raspberry sauce

This was so funky!  Throws you off your taste buds!  You see burger but taste dessert!  Wifey wasn't really into the concept of this, but the little one & I were totally on board!  It is a novelty of sorts, but so fun to eat!  It's like a Klondike Bar in a bun.  Funnel cake 'fries' were good too, light & sweet, good for dipping in the raspberry sauce.

Overall we had a great time at Café 6.  I would come back for the GIANT PRETZEL itself, and kick back with that and a beer or two.  Then probably order a burger to share.  I like the concept they have got going here, it's casual fare but punched up a notch.  I will say though Café 6 is not cheap eats!  Burgers average around the $15-16 mark, around Strip pricing.  But there is quality there and lots of potential.  Service for us was a big PLUS.

Thank you Cafe 6 and the staff of The Palms for a great meal and hospitality.  Keep up the good work!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,3,4,-sv7Fuara8DSV2Njxl447w

4147664,2015-08-18,4,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"Resting above the valley on the 6th floor of the Palms Place down at the farthest reaches of the seemingly endless Sky Tube, Cafe 6 is a lonely place.  My friend and I went one Tuesday evening a couple of weeks ago.  I was shocked to see the restaurant completely empty.  There wasn't even a hostess.  Just a sign inviting us to seat ourselves.  Why did I even make a reservation?  It seems it was all in vain.

Besides being completely devoid of customers, aside from my friend and myself, this restaurant has space that is being horribly under utilized. From what I understand, there used to be another establishment here. One that offered a greater variety. As for Cafe 6, it is a faux high end place selling gourmet pub fare at gourmet prices. This space is not suited for such a menu. A nice, albeit secluded, location with a beautiful crystal clear pool just on the other side of a thin pane of glass does not deserve waffle fries and overloaded messy burgers which are served in an undersized basket that does nothing to keep the tables clean.

It is these very burgers that I am a fan of at Cafe 6.  I eat a lot of burgers and the one I had here was one of the best in three consecutive days of a burger binge.  I ordered the Dr. Pepper Shroom Burger.  The pattie was thick and fresh and cooked to a perfect medium.  The portabello pieces were in absolutely every bite and some even fell out into the basket below where they waited patiently for me to rescue them.  The cheese was gooey and oh so good.  I could have done without the dijon mustard but that is just a taste preference rather than a criticism of what Cafe 6 has created.  And the waffle fries on the side were the perfect vehicle to break up the richness of the burger.  They were served with a house made spicy ketchup.  It was not unlike a cocktail sauce though it was a different spice than from horseradish.  I enjoyed it so thoroughly I asked for more.

What is a once-in-a-blue moon dinner without dessert?  I ordered the banana split on this night (which was coincidentaly a few days after a blue moon).  Vanilla, strawberry and chocolate ice creams were hidden beneath heaps of whipped cream, wafer sticks, chocolate swizzles and a cherry.  On the sides were two halves of a banana that had been coated with sugar and bruleed to caramelize them into a crispy sweet treat.  I was reminded of bananas foster without the booze (tear).  Eating this pushed me over the edge and I decided it was time to call it a night.

I want to like Cafe 6 but I just don't know if it is going to last.  If a Tuesday evening between 6:00 and 8:00 is any indication, they likely wont make it too long.  I hope I'm wrong because the staff is friendly and the food is amazing.  They don't deserve to be tossed aside and overlooked.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,4,3,4,YHCJvb9qqaWmfLEyoAM4xQ

4530052,2015-07-30,3,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"Experience:  came to check out this new spot with a friend. It was 6:00 on a Sat evening. 

Facility:  this is a beautiful place. It does have an upscale feel, but then the view of the pool makes it feel casual. We sat at the round half bench tables that had 2 chairs at the end. They also have a full bar for beer and cocktails. 

Service:  the staff were super friendly. Our waiter, Anthony, was very friendly and continuously concerned for our satisfaction. Even the manager jumped in at one point to check on our happiness and corrected a small problem by offering us a complimentary dessert. 5 star service here!!!

Food: my friend and I decided to to the fried pickle appetizer, since you folks on YELP raved about it. If you like fried pickles, these were yummy! We shared a burger each, but split them so we could each taste two. We also got fries and onion rings to share, so we got a good taste of the menu. 
Crunchy, salty PICKLES - 4/5 - They came with 3 sauces lemon aioli, sriracha mayo, and BBQ sauce. I loved the sriracha mayo the most. They are spears, not chips, for those wondering. Oh yeah, speaking of chips...I loved the surprise of salt and vinegar chips on the bottom of the pickles. They might have been there to soak up grease, but I love them too much to not partake. 
BURN YOUR FACE OFF BURGER - 4/5 - the waiter suggested we get the Habanero hot sauce on the side, so we listened. This burger was good, and the hot sauce was indeed VERY hot. I loved it!!!  But on the side was a great suggestion. It was a tad overdone, but cheeses with good flavors from the poblanos and cole slaw. 
WAFFLE FRIES - 5/5 - crisp, delicious and exactly what you'd expect from a good fry!
SMOKE OUT BURGER - 4/5 - at the suggestion of the waiter, we tried this burger and so glad we did!  I loved the flavors on this burger.  I liked the pretzel bun much better than the torta bun too. It was a tad overdone and the BBQ sauce a tad sweet for my palate, but it was a pretty good balance for the rich meats. The brisket was so good, I wish I had some separately on my plate. You gotta try this burger!!!
ONION RINGS - 5/5 - these were the big fat beer battered onion rings that are big enough to replace the patty on your burger. Could only eat one because they were so big!  
FRIED COOKIE CUTTER - I am not going to rate this one, because it's unfair that I'm not a dessert person, nor do I like chocolate; however, my friend said it was 6/5!  It looked very good...the fried Oreos. Reminded me of fair food back in Louisiana. I did sneak a small taste of the vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce and that was yum!  

Overall:  I really liked this place. Loved the ambience...loved the service...and the food was good. I can't give it a 5, since our burgers were overdone, but they were both flavorful. Don't come here when your on a diet...come here when you are ready to splurge on flavorful, yummy food with a topping of great service. :)",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,3,4,5uleqByYj1iUdOMXHgNI_Q
4555044,2016-10-11,1,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"Disgusting. 

Apparently a craft burger in California is a completely different animal than a craft burger in Vegas. 

What a waste of beef. 

Add in horrible service and you've got a package deal! 

Let's take it from the top. 

All over the resort it is advertised craft beers. Where I come from, that means on tap.  Apparently here that means in a bottle and 'here is a menu with a list of beers, oh but we are out of most of them'. 

Ordered a burger, because this is what they specialize in yes? Any burger order comes with NO condiments - those cost 1.00 extra - each. I know how I am and a dry burger is not my type so I go for a side of regular mayo. Ask for it at ordering.
Said burger comes out without a side of mayo - ask the lady who delivered the said burger for mayo. 

I patiently watched as she went behind the counter to talk to her friend, check her phone - get a drink out of the cupboard - you know, the normal things you do when you've been asked for something.  I should be grateful though for the extra time - it gave me quite a while to sit and stare at my burger (15 minutes actually before I could get someone's attention and ask for Mayo, again, from a different person). 

I will give a compliment to my burger bun - it was soft and pretty. Absolutely flavorless, like the rest of the burger, but it was pretty. Everything else was worthless. Soggy, grease soaked lettuce. I know I ordered a cheese burger but the piece of cheese was so tiny and thin that you literally could not see the cheese, nor taste it. Like I stated above the burger comes dry, which would be ok if it was flavorful but this burger was nowhere near flavorful. Not only was it over cooked (I ordered medium and got quite well done) but there was not one bit of seasoning at all. I can cook up some ground beef in my frying pan and get better results. 

Really? If you're going to make me purchase condiments to mask your inability to cook a burger, then just charge me 20 bucks to begin with for the burger and bring me a sampler of sauses so I can choke this monstrosity down. 

So after taking two bites and not being able to eat another bite, the server who was to busy with her friends and her phone to bring mayo back, shows up with a thing of mayo - 25 minutes later. And the clincher, she sees that our server finally did bring by some mayo and gives me a sarcastic dirty look. Are you kidding me?! Last I checked you work here, sorry to inconvenience you with a request for mayo. 

I won't even get started on the other meal we ordered as that's a whole other story that parallels the above.

The whole experience was dismissive, as if we were intruding on their space. We got there at 1:27 and did not get out of there until 2:02 - and there were only 5-6 tables. We did gather, after listening to all the standing around and gossiping, that last night was crazy busy and a big deal and the servers were thankful they made it through, so I guess taking it easy today is justified, you know, after a long night of work and all. 

I would like to give a genuine recognition to the sweet smiling girl who was the hostess today - while your fellow female employees stood around ignoring their tables, gossiping about last nights experience and playing with their phones and simply being snotty, this girl cleaned and bussed tables immediately, with a smile on her face, was constantly working and did not stop once the whole time we were there - this girl is rad!",0dmMgfbP23TzB6jNq1pcMQ,5,1,1,2K8rVDtOdSZO_qe4tlO_Gw

The elevator button is marked ""Cafe 6"" for convenience. My family breathed a sigh of relief once we located this burger restaurant. I purchased a glorious Groupon for Cafe 6 and was super excited to use it. For $26, we received two build-your-own burgers and one flight of beer that came with 6 samples of our choice. What a steal! We chose to put the value of the build-your-own burgers (13.95) towards their specialty burgers and just paid the difference.

BURN YOUR FACE OFF VEGGIE BURGER ($14.95): The gigantic burger came with TWO black bean patties topped with jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, poblano, slaw, and habanero sauce if you're so inclined. Never in my life have I had 2 stacked veggie burgers. I was impressed! I chose to put the habanero sauce on the side. Burgers come with a side of fries, and I went with the sweet potato fries (at no extra charge either!). The sweet potato fries were probably the second best potato fries I've ever had. Yum! This meal was decadent and worth every bite. 5/5

MEATLOAF BURGER ($14.95): That's right, Cafe 6 is pumping out a meatloaf burger! My husband's grandpa ordered this and was raving about this burger the entire meal. The burger was huge and looked super interesting. Pops said this was the best burger he's ever had. 5/5

DR. PEPPER/SHROOM ($15.95): All of their burgers are giant and worth the $15 price tag. Granny liked her burger as well, but wasn't raving like a madwoman about it. 4/5

VIRGIN VEG LETTUCE WRAP ($7.95): Husband got this as an appetizer. He really liked them, but I wasn't a fan. 3/5

CHICKEN WINGS ($10.95): My husband got this appetizer as his entree. Who goes to a burger place and doesn't order a burger?? That guy. He liked the BBQ wings and couldn't finish them all. 4/5

The FRIED COOKIE CUTTER ($9.95): FREE with Yelp check-in! These fried oreos served with vanilla ice cream were the icing on top of the cake for this hearty meal. 4.5/5 

SERVICE: The food took a while to arrive, as did the flights of beers, but the server was nice and we were in no rush anyways. 3.5/5

VIBE: Trendy minimalist with a view of the Palm's pool. 4/5

Worth a Return Visit?
If you like burgers and huge portions, Cafe 6 is a must try! If I'm at the Palms I'll most likely eat here.

There were several interesting options for Breakfast. I chose the Smoked Benny, which had Poached Eggs and Smoked Brisket served on an English Muffin with Hollandaise Sauce, Pickled Onion and a side of Breakfast Potatoes. This was a solid version of the classic, with the added twist of the surprisingly good brisket and the Onions that cut the fattiness of the dish.

There were 7 of us and they had no problem setting up the table for us as it was rather slow. It's mostly just burgers but they have a good selection of items to choose from if you want to build your own. I ordered a Dr. Pepper/Shroom burger with a veggie patty and it came double stacked and was simply delicious! The veggie patties are black bean based which have the tendency to fall apart as you go so I was forced to continue eating it until it was gone and I don't regret that one bit! Haha. My older kids got a smokehouse which they devoured even with its notable size, both said they were really, really good albeit a little messy. My other son ordered a Short Rib sloppy joe and it got rave reviews as well.

All burgers besides the sliders came with fries and some of us ordered sweet potato, other's plain and both were good. Each burger ran about $15/each.

They're honestly equal to a McDonalds milkshake which you can get at the Palms downstairs by these ones cost you a whopping $9.95 + tax and are NOT worth it!

5708445,2018-05-08,1,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"So we are staying at Palms Place for 8 days - we came here last year and it was great. This is the only restaurant inside the Palms Place. It had Yummy burgers and good service.  However apparently a month ago they switched their menu up - only one burger is on the menu and the rest is a whole bunch of randomness but looked decent and we actually had a good meal our first night which probably would have received a 4 star review.  We also came for breakfast the next day (yesterday) as they also started serving breakfast.  Breakfast was ok.  I had a smoothie that I didn't really like - mixed berries and chia seeds and whole bunch of other organic stuff and a side of yummy scrambled eggs. Hubby to be had overnight oats and this is the important part of my review - the oats had sliced strawberries and sliced bananas on top of it - see attached photo. 

This morning I wake up starving and want some more of those eggs but can I try a smoothie with just strawberries and bananas? Apparently not. Was told they ""can't do that"" by the rude bartender who yelled at a waitress to handle the question instead of going back to the cook himself.  It's 9:00 am and there's nobody at the bar.  There's 6 people in the restaurant - which is more than the average I've seen in the couple times I've been here and during pool lounging as you can see into the restaurant. 

I'm sorry, why can't you do that?  I understand it's not as exciting or flashy as the two smoothies you have on the menu - it's actually plain and extremely simple and the strange part is I know you have the ingredients because we bought a single cup of milk for $3.00 the night before because I was craving it (me being weird isn't part of this review).  

So again you're telling me you cannot blend strawberries, bananas, some milk, and some ice together and charge me double what it actually costs to make??  I'm sorry but what kind of customer service is that? Yes I understand it's ""not on the menu"" but how many restaurants have you been to that modify something for you?  I wasn't asking them to make me a five course Michelin starred dinner.  I'm asking for like the most basic smoothie ever. Am I acting like I'm entitled? I don't mean to be. I'm pretty picky and always ask to modify things whether that be no sauce on my food - take away the lettuce - instead of provolone can I get cheddar - I mean I'm not asking for the world here.  Am I wrong?  I just feel like every restaurant that I've ever been to has gone above and beyond now - except for this one.  

However The waitresses both days were very nice.  Back to the bartender though - who the hostess told us to order through for takeout - first of all no greeting and then when my honey asked if they could make a strawberry smoothie he just shook his head no at him - didn't even open his mouth. That's when he yelled at the waitress - who was actually busy instead of going to ask himself.  

We would have ordered eggs and smoothies every day this week - I would much rather pay for overpriced food with good customer service.

Ps I just noticed that since I wrote a review and had uploaded pics from my previous experience a year ago they show up on this review - so that doesn't go with this time but man look at that pretzel bun... sad they changed the dinner menu!!",zCg2mUmicb4Cssv3ScouSw,4,0,1,xHvdB-tHDGL2LwNU6MQTJA

The service, however, was fantastic. Our server was amazing and definitely went the extra mile to take care of us. He was really excited and kept the energy high even though we were both incredibly tired. We ordered the Rock Shrimp appetizer, I ordered a ""Build Your Own"" turkey burger, he ordered their ""Smokeout"" (which is apparently what they are known for) and we also had the sweet potato and skinny fries. The shrimp appetizer was okay. It wasn't great or absolutely terrible. I think the batter could have been a little better and fried a little longer, and I don't think they should toss it in the Tobasco Ranch. I LOVE Tobasco, however it made it really soggy. This was probably the best thing we ordered. My turkey burger was really bland. I got the normal toppings on it (lettuce, tomato, onions) and added mushrooms. They put way too many onions on there and it was an overwhelming taste. Usually I don't complain about that because I do like onions, but they must have given me half of an onion. The Smokeout looked unappetizing and he said he was really unhappy with it. I didn't even want to try it. The sweet potato fries were pretty good but a tad too salty. 
We didn't come back here, although we would have if the food was good. It's convenient if you want something basic...like fries. I don't recommend this place.",1sOjfqaoh47PgQnUHZWYPQ,20,20,2,9qBpbaRPgM3UQUedJqO-6A

5902351,2015-08-07,2,0bWLkWeIcT-EnrE7SiGEBA,"We were invited to Café 6 at Palms Place for a comped meal.  Located on the 6th floor, this hideaway has a very inviting, upscale feel, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the pool.

We were attended to immediately by Jeannette, our wonderful server.  Though the restaurant has what looks like a classy, full bar, there is no cocktail list.  There is no wine list.  Instead, the restaurant is selling off what remains from its predecessor's wine collection, and will not be replacing it.  Huh????

The only Riesling available was the one we both dislike.  Instead I ordered an Ace Pineapple Cider from the Beer/Cider menu, and hubby had a Sierra Nevada.   If you don't like either, you're SOL.  Or, you could have a million-calorie shake to go along with your This is Not Health Food meal.  They're probably delicious.  Fattening stuff always is (except for Fried Twinkies).  It IS nice that they stock a selection of local brews, but as a non-beer drinker, the lack of wine is a huge turn-off for me.  The pineapple cider was interesting - tasty, but too sweet even for me.

We started with the Baked Soft Pretzel, an enormous creature served with Dijon Mustard & Warm Cheese Sauce.  Loved it, but needed to make room for dinner, so it was the first entry in the take-home bag.

We ordered a Dr. Pepper/Shroom burger for me, without the Dr. Pepper Glaze.  I never liked that soda, but did want all the other stuff on it:  the Roasted Portabello, White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, and Dijon Mustard on a Brioche Bun.  I asked for it medium, and it was slightly less than that, but in the good 'ol days I would get my burgers medium-rare, so I was fine with it, Health Dept. be damned.

Mr. G. got the Smokehouse Burger, and he enjoyed it a lot.  We ordered one with onion rings and one with waffle fries, well-done.  The onion rings were humungous, and I didn't dare eat more than one.  The waffle fries were perfect:  crisp, well-done but not burnt, simply scrumptious.  I couldn't even finish my burger, and we took home a lot of fries and the remaining onion rings.

We finished up with dessert - the To Die For Chocolate.  We were too full to go the whole nine yards, so we asked for the ice cream to be served and all the other stuff packed to go.  We did miss the beautiful presentation that I've seen in some of the photos posted here, but the three scoops of chocolate ice cream that were served to us made me almost comatose, 'cause I ate too much of it.

Café 6 has a lot going for it:  great atmosphere, big and tasty burgers, rings, fries, pretzels, desserts, stellar service.  But not so great menu:  just TWO entrees, a few ""sammiches"" that don't sound particularly enticing, a bar that looks like a bar, but maybe it's just a mirage (oh, that's a different hotel), Strip pricing.  If you're craving a burger and a beer, this may just be your place.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,7,3,H4xNFvbY2dk9neUp1HVI6A

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I only had one simple dish so I can't fairly judge them on the food.  BUT my salad was delicious! Big pieces of crab meat and a tasty dressing. 
First impressions are important at restaurants and my server (Maddison) made a great one.  She had a huge smile when she approached the table and was very sweet.  Thanks, girl!",NMx2Zxf2aLukc5SoDK5ypQ,0,0,4,w3gvf16_3oZ3i_Ki3S2Xyw
