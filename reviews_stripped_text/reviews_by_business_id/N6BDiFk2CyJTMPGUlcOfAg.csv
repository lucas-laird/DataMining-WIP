I always order a watermelon slush, it tastes so refreshing and this is the only place I know of that serves real fruit aside from Tea Time cafe or Number 1 boba. This location is pretty close to my house, so it's convenient whenever I'm craving a smoothie. It doubles as a Thai place and I'm obsessed with their yellow curry, which is chicken, carrots, and potatoes in hot soup with a side of rice. It's not too spicy and it's pretty good.

784039,2016-07-29,3,N6BDiFk2CyJTMPGUlcOfAg,"One of my favorite boba places. Prices are decent, the menu is vast, and the first place I've ever had a chrysanthemum milk tea. Absolutely LOVE it, coming from a person who does not like floral milk tea drinks.
A couple of other good choices would be the thai tea: can't really find a perfect mix like this any where else, the thai tea was balanced between whatever it is they put together. I normally get thai teas with more milk, or more tea, but this was a perfect combination; the green milk tea is also very top notch. I love it a lot. Something about their green milk tea always makes me want to only get it from here.
The boba itself is super chewy, and not super sweet, which balances out the drinks.
Definitely recommend this place, especially since it is very convenient to PVP Zone (next door), where you can play PC games, and order from Jackie Bees and they will come deliver it to you.
I've never done it myself, but it also has a lounge kind of vibe where you can hang out and play games (board games).",WLh8lI9Cs_M_2JVc-J1xNA,3,3,5,sGKtID--qc40ziFdeb8a1w

I settled on a strawberry lychee smoothie with strawberry popping pearls and boba. It's funny that for the longest time I had no clue what popping pearls were when I had them on ice cream maybe 2 years ago. 

When I got my smoothie it was very pretty. Glad I took a picture before devouring it. The taste was not bad. Not too sweet or dull.

I would love to try some of their other drinks including an interesting one called a marshmallow tiramisu cocoa. Its a milk drink but I wonder if they offer a lactose or almond milk substitute.",4KQ_INZcDdjC8xw5p0nDrw,7,1,5,81Z95LC1I0qQJlo6z4vPpg

1109769,2017-04-13,1,N6BDiFk2CyJTMPGUlcOfAg,"We were craving a boba tea and so far our experiences have not matched the quality of the boba places in china town, Hawaii.

After debating what to order we decided to go with 2 drinks instead of 1 for each of us due to the higher prices here. We went with a strawberry mango slush that was said to use fresh fruit and a matcha tea that i wanted blended, which most boba places will offer at minimal or no charge.

Once we got our boba drinks, i was let down when the ""real fruit"" slush tasted like a powdered version that didnt seem to have actual fruit. Normally when it is a fruit slush you can see strawberry seeds or tiny chunks of mango imcorporated into the slush. 

I chose the matcha tea with boba because it was a lot less pricey than the custom slushes. However i was unpleasantly surprised to see i was charged for a matcha slush. I like the creaminess of a green tea milk tea and instead got a plain matcha slush with little to no milk. Basically i paid a lot extra to get my order wrong.

First visit I tried the chrysanthemum milk tea with boba- the boba was just right but the tea was fairly light in flavor. BF really enjoyed it though, and I appreciated that it wasn't super-sweet as a lot of milk tea boba drinks can be.

Space is a little bare with nothing on the walls- would love to see them add games and a bit more personality to the décor. Will be back to try the spam musubi and creative-sounding desserts like marshmallow tiramisu!

EDIT 3/14: They've added paint and a bunch of flat-screens for the menu, looks better. Finally tried the spam musubi and chocolate plantation tea, rice was unseasoned and tea tasted watered-down, boba was mushy.

Of coarse I ordered the Plantation Chrysanthemum Milk tea. The barista whipped it up in no time and before your know it I had this refreshing perfectly sweeten perfectly creamy tea. The cookie topping not only looks cool but adds a cookies and cream taste to the drink when it's mixed. The boba had the perfect chew and had great honey sweetness to it. I also got the Jackie Ice coffee and man was I in love. The coffee taste was really nice and it had a Frenchy condensed sweeten milk flavor to it like a Viet ice coffee and I hate coffee. 

All in all the shop was huge lots of seating very clean and chill. Prices were just right for the quality of the drinks I will now have to come back and try their food.",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,2,3,4,GbRArB32o3D18ECUYTSQfA

But, moving forward I ordered the bbq ""musubi"" flavor was good...again, NOT MUSUBI it should be called sushi or roll. On top of that we ordered a taro boba which the time they had given our ordered took almost 20. Here's the thing if it's a to go place it should NEVER take that long. Reasons for me giving 2 stars is because the boba tasted good as well as the bbq roll.

If that sounds like a perk to you - Jackie Bee may be your new fav! It is certainly the biggest space I have seen in the bubble tea scene - there are plenty of tables to hang out at. They also rent out boardgames, just trade your ID for a game (theft problem?) I can see why the college kids at CSN may love it here, if I was in college I would certainly be back. As it is, I am not in college and I do not live near by and it isn't really good enough for me to go out of my way to get here. 

For my drink I ordered a honeydew milk tea and it was rather watery. It wasn't green, which is fine with me because I would rather have it be natural and less colorful. However, it also didn't have much flavor at all. The boba was harder than I expected. I ordered the Spam Masubi and the Fried Tofu Bites. The masubi was flavorless. If you like this dish made with no spices and just warmed up spam with plain rice and seaweed, this might be the option for you. I like prefer mine with spices on the meet or sesame seeds in the rice. The tofu bites didn't come with any sauce at all - just plain pieces of tofu.

2619324,2015-03-19,17,N6BDiFk2CyJTMPGUlcOfAg,"Jackie Bee's has the prime setup; located next door (with a connecting door and all) to a gamer's paradise, PVP Zone, a 24-hour Internet and video gaming cafe and it's also right across the street from the College of Southern Nevada. I peeped a lot of World of Warcraft action happening in the back. Good work nerds. Great location for students to post up, do homework, level up and bleed all of their allowances.

However, high hopes can't save you when the boba fails at all of your (reasonable) expectations. The menu is way too large for their own good and I can guarantee you, in a sea of mediocre, you will only find one decent item on the menu (cough: Thai iced tea- minus the boba.) Pricing is competitive: ranging from $3.50 for a medium - $5 for a large. However, they really messed up the art of milk tea and even the potted plant (plantation) tea; it tastes like dirt and water for real. The tea flavor is nonexistent; I really just tasted water, the crushed Oreos do not enhance the drink, just makes it gritty and taste dirty. Even when sending the drink back for improvement, the drink comes back tasting the same. What in the world? 

The boba here is legit nasty. Like, I was actually offended with the 2 drinks we ordered. I had a look of pure disgust on my face as my drink was delivered to me with thick syrup and black mush on the bottom of my milk tea. Yeah, you guys, that's the boba. It is shockingly overcooked and gooey. Honey boba you say? Ha! Even Honey BooBoo would be offended.

The only reason why I will be nice and not give them a 1 star rating is because the kids working the counter are young and sweet, but man, they need help!

The Caramel Milk Tea tasted slightly watered down and had a coffee taste to it. It was good, but not what I expected for a Caramel Milk Tea.

3167792,2015-03-11,5,N6BDiFk2CyJTMPGUlcOfAg,"Boy, looks sure can be deceiving...

Walking into Jackie Bee, you might think you're in a new modern style cafe, rather than a boba shop. Located in the Charleston Festival plaza, this new spot is open, appears clean and is decked out with decent looking furniture and several flat screen TV's. 6 of those TV's are home to the menu which features several boba drinks and a decent amount of food options, including bento boxes.

After standing around and checking out the menu for a few minutes, the girl behind the counter asked if we had been there before. We had not, so she said they had some suggestions of popular items...which ended up just being two things, the Chrysanthemum Milk Tea and the Ice-Cream Ball Coffee Jelly Milk Tea. Both seemed pretty straight forward, but she didn't bother to explain anything in anyway or offer any other help. I was also disappointed that she just offered the people in front of us a 10% discount for them just opening, but didn't mention the same deal to us. She was nice enough, but the counter service is basically nonexistent for the most part. 

I ended up ordering an Oolong Milk Tea with boba and a KungPao Chicken bento box. The bento box is priced just under $9 and includes meat, a side of greens and fried rice. Going off the flavors and textures alone, nothing appeared to be freshly made. The fried rice had virtually no flavor on its own and seemed more like something you'd get out of the freezer. Unfortunately, the chicken was just as bad and had this awful flavor that tasted like burnt soy sauce. Overall it was just a really bad plate of food and I ended up not finishing it. Thankfully my drink was much better and even half price since I ordered a combo meal. The milk tea was flavorful, not overly sweet, and the boba was very decent. A little chewy, but not soggy or slimy.

My biggest issue with the drinks here is their regular teas. Our 6 year old son has quite possibly the simplest drink order you could make. He gets a plain ole' black iced tea with boba. No sweetener, no flavors, nothing...just tea and boba. When I asked the girl if they offered a tea like that, she said yes and punched his order in. Yet when we got his drink, it had this extremely strong orange flavor and was really sweet. When I took it back and asked if this was right, she said it was and that this was there house tea, but because I ordered unsweetened that's how it tastes. I was confused as she just told me the tea was plain and unsweetened only 5 minutes before that. She offered a generic apology and basically sent me on my way. I didn't bother wasting anymore money on ordering another drink.

Another strange thing about this place is their neighboring business, the PVP Zone. I'm not sure if the two are co-owned or if they are just partnering up to generate business for each other, but there is a door inside that goes between the two and people were shuffling in and out constantly. The worst part was this particular guy that I had not seen the whole time during my visit until close to the end. He came in from next door and walked back behind the counter to talk to one of the Jackie Bee employees. While that employee was making a drink in a blender, this guy was standing right next to him constantly running his fingers through his hair. I was too far away to see if anything might be coming off the dudes head, but had I seen that when I walked in, I woulda walked right back out. They let at least 2 other people from next door walk behind the counter and just hang out besides him too. With customers drinks being made in that same area, I think the owners or managers should be paying a lot more attention to who's ""hanging out"" here.

Even with the several boba spots in town, I've been waiting to check out Jackie Bee since I seen the sign a few months ago. Sadly, this was a super disappointing visit and even though the boba was decent enough, I'm not sure I'd come back anytime soon. There's way too many better choices for boba alone, and the food didn't add anything worthwhile. 1.5 stars.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,12,9,2,SZAq0NN1rxEtgScJU7HPFQ

- Ordered 2 milk teas with boba, spicy popcorn chicken and spicy drunken noodles.

- Was asked spiciness level preference from 1-10.  Wanting to be more conservative, we said a 3 on the noodles and a 4 on the popcorn chicken.

-When we received our drinks, we found the tea watered down with no prominent ""tea"" flavor, so it just tasted like brown sugar water.  I also found the boba to be hard, not nice and chewy.  And for a place with ""Boba"" in the name, you should nail the boba texture.

-The biggest disappointment was the food.  The food was SO RIDICULOUSLY SPICY that it was inedible.  We heard other customers also say, ""I've never eaten anything so spicy in my life.""  My fiancé and I love to eat spicy, so when our tongues basically became numb from a 3 and 4 out of a 10, we found it to be unreasonable.  After 2 bites of each dish, we threw the food away.

-Lastly, it was annoying to watch them play loud YouTube videos of randomness with all the ads.

Not quite a ""Ooh this is good Thai tea"" unless you ask for it to have less milk. The boba is super chewy and perfect though! I make boba and Thai tea at home, so I can appreciate a place that gets it right. 

I love that they have a student/military discount as I like to support those kinds of businesses, and they definitely cater to the college crowd with their gaming zone attached to the restaurant. The last time I went they were playing a Twitch livestream on the tv! The employees are decent, one of them was pretty friendly and I liked him a lot. 

They have a great selection of food but for me the chicken fried rice and the cashew chicken stir fry have both been WAY too spicy to fully appreciate. The first time I stupidly ordered a 6/10 spiciness, and the second time a 4/10 was still too spicy for me to look forward to eating it for leftovers. 

The level I am looking for is ""a little more than a little spicy"" and next time I will order it a 2/10 and if that's too spicy then dammit I'm throwing in the towel. 

I look forward to coming back and trying other things, as the price and the value for money is good.

Jackie Bee has become a safe haven for students that want their boba fix, but don't want to travel farther than CSN West Charleston.

Sometimes they run out of things at night such as Thai coffee l, so be sure to come before they run out. My drinks have always been made spot on and their boba is okay. Sometimes they are older and not of better quality, but still palatable compared to most. Their plantation tea is signature and is unique to the facility. 

The restaurant side has been touch and go. Most things are previously frozen and reheated. One time we had to ask their kitchen to cook the steamed dumplings longer because they were still frozen in the middle. Their soups are oily, but seemed representative of Northern Thailand-style cooking. 

If you're looking a late-night place, I think you can feel safe coming here; however, if you're already in Chinatown, just stay there for food and drink.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,5,3,4,01gfNEPli7lA2mkVCyVBxw

Never knew Jackie Bee Boba Express opened until my friend told me about it. Conveniently located across from CSN Charleston Campus, Jackie Bee Boba Express is a great hangout spot for college students. 

ATMOSPHERE
Spacious, modern, clean and most of the times quiet. Jackie Bee is located next to PVP Zone (Internet cafe), there are a lot of video game players going in and out of the stores. Even though the store can get loud at times, there are many outlets to charge your laptop while doing your homework and they even have a free wifi (password: videogame). 

SERVICE
Great service! Love that servers/cashiers are chill and friendly. They are willing to answer any questions.

DRINK
If you are a college student, show your student ID for 20% off! With the student discount, I get my boba drink for around $3-$4. On my first visit, I got an Oolong tea with boba. I was disappointed with the taste/quality. I have gotten an Oolong tea from KFT, it did not have any strong tea taste like KFT but just a very subtle/plain taste, almost like a flavored water. 

On my second visit, I ordered a Jasmine milk tea with boba (I get this everywhere I go). Jasmine milk tea here taste just like the one from QQ boba. It is very light on milk and doesn't have that overpowering sweetness. Even though I like my Jasmine milk tea floral, I really liked this version of Jasmine milk tea. I would say the only difference between here and QQ boba is that Jasmine milk tea here taste like there is soy milk in it. I no longer have to drive an hour to Henderson for Jasmine milk tea... :)

In conclusion, their drinks are good because none of the drinks have any artificial/overpowering sweetness. Subtle and just the right amount of sweetness. I do like the texture of boba here, just wondering why they would call it ""Honey Boba"" when it doesn't even taste like honey.

If you don't like boba, they also have many other options for toppings. I have not tried any of their food yet but my friend said their onion rings and popcorn chicken are really good. I will have to try those and update my review~",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,4,3,4,vmBEm9zPF3MaO8rt3hC8Ew

4346079,2017-04-21,5,N6BDiFk2CyJTMPGUlcOfAg,"Meh, describes our experience pretty well. I had a boba drink from here a while back and it wasn't bad so when my work husband and I were craving thai food and needed it quick, going to ""Thai Bistro"" which is apparently Jackie Bee Boba, seemed rational.
Ok first off, why are there two names under the same address and there is only one counter? Is this Jackie or Thai Bistro, I'm confused...
Second, when ordering the food we were surprised that there was no spicy level question. I've never been to a thai restaurant that did not ask what level of spiciness I want my food to be. That should of been a red flag right there but we were starving and didn't have time.
Third, our order was mixed up. We got an order of combination fried rice instead of pad thai. It's pretty frustrating to have to come back for the right order when you are super hungry. We should of checked the back before, I guess it's our fault..
Fourth, the food was just ok. We had the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew, both combination meat. Nothing special in flavor and SUPER greasy. 
Don't waste your time, there are plenty of thai places around. This one just happened to be about a minute from my job. But dissatisfaction is what happens when you sacrifice convenience for quality.",uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg,5,3,2,z3rMHDJL3hHoQszVW02o6g

I like the spice to the yellow and red curry. They always come out extremely fast and piping hot which makes me question what they're doing back there to make it come out so quickly.

When reading over their menu I was super intrigued by the chrysanthemum milk tea and ordered it half sweet without boba.  I really liked that you could control the sweetness levels in the drinks and there was a slight hint of chrysanthemum in my drink.  I would definitely order it again

I also ordered the Spicy Drunken Noodles with Tofu.  Normally when I order spicy foods at boba shops the food is never that spicy, but no at Jackie Bee.  There was a spicy kick to the noodles that was great.  

I have a feeling that this place is going to be my new go to spot before and after working at CSN

Come around with free samples of their menu

Have free Wi-Fi

Board games for customers to play
