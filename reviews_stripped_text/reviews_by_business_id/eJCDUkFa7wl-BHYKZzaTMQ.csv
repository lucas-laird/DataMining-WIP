I can't get enough of the salmon salad for lunch.  The baked brie is to die for and is a definite must try.  My only critique of Grape Street is that the lighting is very dim at times.  I like a little mood lighting, but I'm not going for dining in the dark.  Overall, Grape Street is a solid choice, lunch or dinnner.",wl3BnGZs0KnOts4M5YLBjw,0,0,4,jC2a4SKGAng28zMiTllw-g

I went there with my husband early on a Saturday night.  We each ordered a wine flight, an appetizer, and I ordered a pasta dish.  I thought the wine selection for the flight was wonderful and the price was fair.  The appetizer was okay.  We ordered a cheese and fruit plate.  I thought the cheese selection was only fair.  My pasta was good but a bit bland.  Overall, I had a very pleasant experience.  It is a bit over priced but otherwise a fun option if you're looking to get away from a chain restaurant.

301089,2013-08-30,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Wow, from beginning to end my experience here was lackluster at best.  First, we walked in and waited, as the sign said ""wait to be seated"".  After several minutes the person working the bar told us to seat ourselves.  Here we waited again for service.  The initial approach was ""just two?""  At which point the server removed the remaining utensils.  Then same guy comes back and asks ""water""?  A bit after getting water it was ""here's your bread"".  Thinking this guy was the busser, I was waiting for someone to redeem the situation, but the same guy came back to take our order.  There was never a greeting, telling us his name . . . They did seem understaffed for a seemingly busy Friday lunch.  We were sitting near the server station, so we overheard a lot of ""this table wants their check"" or ""can you check on this table""?  Food finally comes and it was ok.  I had the eggplant parm sandwich and it took several bites to get to any flavor of the hot peppers, as if no one bothered to stir the sauce.  I always think that the bread makes the sandwich and the bread for this sandwich was great, too bad the rest didn't live up to expectations.
Of course we had to wait again for our check and final insult there was that an 18% gratuity was already added!  I have never encountered such a thing for two people.  It's no wonder the service is poor if they are guaranteed a decent tip on all their tables!  When the server brought back my card, he just plopped it on the table, without even a ""thank you for coming"".  
This place is often on Groupon and I would suggest to anyone - do not buy it, its not an experience worth having.",Qm5G3BCgwSLBNh7_Gy6SQQ,5,0,1,dApqJzR9pYGOx9MXLJyr4Q

Food was great, service was good. Mind you we went there on a Sunday night. So the place was not crowded at all.  We were seated immediately and received good service. 

It is a little pricy for me to go there regularly. The food is priced well. It is just when you add the items a-la-cart they add up. Had we not had the Groupon, our meal for two would have been around $200. For two additional glasses of wine and the tip which was not included, we spent another almost $70 on top of Groupon..  That is a little stiff for me. I think it is worth the price just not low enough for us to go regularly.

Ambiance is nice. I was surprised to see a place with charm and character in a strip mall. Unique wine selection.

I do like the atmosphere, but it can be a little uncomfortable when they are crowded. Tonight we had reservations for 6:45, but didn't end up being seated until after 7:00.  The area around the bar was super crowded and it seemed a little stuffy inside.  Our server was good, and very friendly.  They have a decent wine selection (as the name might suggest). I had the chicken caesar salad and Mary Anne's grilled cheese.  The salad was very good, but then again, I was starving.  The Mary Anne's grilled cheese was AWESOME!  It is definitely not the kind of grilled cheese you would expect to order off the kiddie menu! It has goat cheese, proscuitto, roasted red peppers, and basil on a grilled baguette.  This was probably the tastiest sandwich I have had in quite some time.  I didn't really think I would be able to finish it, but somehow I managed to put the whole thing away (it was like something out of a scene from Coneheads). :)  I have never tried their pasta, but really enjoy their salads and sandwiches.  They had a seared ahi tuna special that looked really good, but it turned out they were out of tuna by the time we ordered. Overall, I was pleased with my meal.

The menu has such a great variety and I always order the tapas plate no matter what! The tzaziki is to die for! The meatballs have just enough kick to be full of flavor but not too spicy and the eggplant is great too. I am also a huge fan of their baked Brie, steak salad and the penne al la vodka is the best in town by far! Their desserts are always delish and I usually choose the wonderful fruit and chocolate fondue or the pumpkin cheesecake. Overall this is my favorite place to go alone and enjoy the wine, music, and great food while leisurely indulging in a great afternoon or with a girlfriend for happy hour.

At that time, it was great....excellent service, food you can tell they cared about, and an eclectic wine list that was not over-priced.  In the last few years, this place has really jumped the shark.  The last few times I've given Grape Street another chance to redeem itself, both the food and service has been inconsistent and the prices have gone way up.  I can tell you, the penne ala vodka does NOT taste like it used to.

On my latest trip there, my girlfriend and I stopped in for a glass of wine and sat at the bar, which only had a few guys at the other end.  First, the pinot they poured me was cloudy tasted like it had been opened for a week or more.  Then after he poured, we could not get the bartender to acknowledge us again since he and someone who appeared to be the chef spent all their time bantering very loudly with the guys at the end of the bar.  I can't tastefully repeat what they were talking about, but it was more than enough to make my friend and I put down money for the drinks and walk out.

Only one table was occuppied outside, but seemed like the heaters did a good job of warming up the area.  It was about 55 degrees without the heater going.  Inside, the lights were dimmed and the feeling was cozy.  

I ordered the wine flight and was impressed with the quality of the wine.  The wine flight gives you 4 -2 oz glasses of the varietal of your choice.  I went with the syrah and was pleased.  We ordered the Tapas Plate Appetizer which came with about 6 items.  The Swedish Meatballs were my favorite on the tapas plate but the grilled vegges were a close second.  I had the Ahi Tuna as my entree and was very impressed.  The portion of fish was sizeable and the mashed potatoes, spinach and asparagus were delicious and perfect compliments.  We got the chocolate fondu for dessert and I think the fruit was great but didn't like the pound cake that came with it.

Service was mediocre.  We got there well before the dinner rush and most of the tables around us were empty, but that didn't stop our waiter from being curt and unfriendly.

The food was not good at all.  We had the caprese for a starter, which was good, but not great.  Dinner was brought out well before we even finished our appetizer, and the table was too small for all the plates so we had to load the rest of the appetizers on our dinner plate or send them away.  For dinner we shared the penned ala vodka.  Honestly whoever created the dish should be fired.  The asparagus flavor in the sauce did not fit with the typical vodka sauce from other restaurants.  Frankly we've made better penne ala vodka at home.

Put on top of that the mandatory 18% gratuity for the mediocre service, and I won't be going back.

522738,2015-09-14,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"I've always loved Grape Street. For staying in business for over 17 years says something about a restaurant ESPECIALLY here in LV. I've gone there from day one, but admittedly, I, like most Las Vegans, like things all shiny and new and went off to venture into the celeb chef restaurants and trendy fusion-what-have-you places they were opening up every week...

My hubby and I reminesced about the best Shrimp Scampi and we both agreed Grapestreet has one of THE best versions. It's not Scampi on their menu, but Crab Stuffed Shrimp (cooked Scampi-style). So we strolled back into memory lane and had dinner in our old stomping ground--that was 2 years ago. We've added the restaurant back into our repertoire since then. 

The menu is exactly the same as it was since it's inception. Hey! If it ain't broke... They do have specials written on their chalkboard (over the Kitchen) as well as a dozen (delicious) desserts. They still have their 50% of bottles on Monday and reverse Happy Hour. 

Although we've been going for YEARS, we typically go there for certain dishes. Listed some of our favs. 

Apps: 
- Crab Stuffed Shrimp is a MUST try! Sauce with their bread is a meal in itself. 
- Baked Brie is absolutely ridiculous!! Cheese and Charcuterie is a great accompaniment with it. 
- Caprese is nothing spectacular. Good, but nothing notable. 
- Little Neck clams is a generous helping. Recommend getting a side of angel hair or linguine to dump in the sauce. 
- House Chopped Salad is good, but I sub the raspberry dressing with Champagne vinaigrette. 

Entrees: 
- Penne Alla Vodka is always a goodie...
- Short Rib or Pork Chop Special (when available) are also a fav.
- Other entrees on rotation is the Chicken Marsala and Alaskan Halibut.


Desserts:
- Apple Tart
- Bread Pudding 
- NY Cheesecake (try the Pumpkin Cheesecake in the Fall)

With all that said, the only downside is the inconsistent service. Some days, you NEVER have to ask for anything! Not a glass to be filled, a utensil replaced...Other days, we may as well get everything ourself. It doesn't happen often for us, but it does happen. 

Although the downtown Summerlin location has been open, I prefer the Lake Mead one. It's in a stripmall, but the venue itself I find it to be charming with far more character and ambiance: exposed brick, dim lighting with stringed lights, and racks of wine (which are available for purchase). I also like the feeling of nostalgia from all the fond memories associated with the original location.

Been a long time since I've been to this location. Had to meet up with clients and due to all of our locations, decided that Grape Street was the best place to all meet up to talk business.

A little hesitant at first due to my years ago experience which had pretty much determined there are better places to go but it was convenient for all of us. Pulled up Yelp! to see what has been going on here recently before showing up. Some of the reviews were not so pleasant so I was certainly hesitant ... however... turns out the negative reviews were pretty pathetic at the end of the day.

Walked in.. noticed some things have changed and the place was so cozy cool. Plenty of people with dates just chilling and having a good time. I don't care about being seen and I don't care to see other people so it was awesome.

Our waiter was Brian -- he was AWESOME. Kudos to Brian because he was one of the best waiters ever. He knew we were talking business (or whatever) and wasn't intrusive taking up our time. Spot on with whatever we wanted and was perfect in showing up when needed.

AMBIANCE --- PERFECT. Nice and low key. Great table not on top of everybody else which is highly important to me. I've been to the nicest places in Vegas sitting practically right next to people I don't know and I don't like it. 

Our meals were DELICIOUS. Penne ala Vodka with Chicken for me. Unlike a low review for somebody else on here... there was plenty of chicken and Asparagus with this dish. Other dishes ordered were some Eggplant Parmesan something and some Halibut dish. No idea what the exact names were but the bites I had were DELICIOUS.  

STEAK? Who the hell orders steak at an Italian restaurant to begin with? Give me a break about those negative reviews when it comes to ordering steak. Order true Italian and order wine to go with it for a good time. 

All in all.... a great place for the price. Heck... the night before I was at some pretentious Gordan Ramsay joint sitting on top of another table of people I don't know and don't care to know and paid twice as much for some food / drinks that didn't come close to matching up. 

My opinion... but the negative reviews of this place are from wannabe food critics that think that just because this is off of the strip, that it should have Applebee prices. Heck.... the Siera Gold right down the road doesn't come close to the quality of food here and they charge more for similar dishes.

Great place to take a date... great place for a dinner business meeting. Will be coming back here several more times.

We were ignored by our waiter after we were seated for a while. His excuse...""I thought you were waiting for more people to show up"" without even asking us! What an ass...

It took him about 30 minutes after our arrival to get our drinks and bread...not good!

We had some baked Brie, that was pretty tasty.  I ordered chicken Parmesan with a bowl of clam chowder.  The soup was so salty, and entree was just average.

The fruit and cheese plate leaves a lot to be desired, it was simply four thin slices of un named cheese with an abundance of bread slices and crackers and some unevenly matched fruit slices. The calamari was decent but a small portion. Their bread they give you when you are seated is wonderful. The restaurant was dark and cluttered and the large cast iron chairs were hard to manage. Also, listening to a female waitstaff talk about her tips behind the wine and faux brick wall area when you still have customers in the restaurant is so tacky.

Now, this usually would not be an issue as it's around what I'd usually tip anyway, but for lousy service...not happy about it. We got a waiter who took our orders, plopped down the food, and as we were leaving asked us if we needed anything else. When we called to complain about it, the host (""manager not available"") told us we could come back to get the money we didn't want to tip (obviously not going to do as we'd waste more gas going/coming from there again).

They wouldn't take a reservation for parties less than 6 so we weren't able to do a reservation for the 4 of us.  We found some seats at the bar while we waited.  Had a glass of wine and 30 minutes later we were seated.  Ahhh finally.  For 20 minutes more we watched waiters and busboys all around us zooming past our table in all directions.  We had yet to be greeted.  Finally we made the decision to go somewhere else.  As we stood up and gathered our things we were approached by a waiter.  We explained that by this time it was well over 20 minutes we had not been recognized.  It was almost like we were in an invisible bubble. LOL -But it wasn't funny at the time.

The waiter JASON begged us to stay assuring us that the rest of the experience would be great and he put his word on it.  He explained that there was some confusion with the tables and who had our table.  Low and behold he stuck to his word.  The people assisting him were completely attentive and so was he and we were back in our ""have a nice dinner mode"".  He saved the day!!!  Jason was totally consistent going forward and was a pretty cool guy to talk to.  We were hoping we could buy him a drink after to thank him for the supreme service.  Thanks Jason!

The bread was amazing-totally freshly made.  The BF and I both ordered steaks (on special) and they were fantastic.  They came with mashed potatoes and gravy.  I don't remember what the others ordered because we were so in focus with our own meals.  We also had salad with our meals.

A bottle of wine and no desserts our bill was $300! WITH the Groupon.  Just a little pricey for a double date.  BUT I highly recommend this place to take a one on one date though or a very special occasion.  The ambiance is chill and romantic with the little white lights as a special touch everywhere and they have outdoor seating as well.  They do not serve mixed drinks which a little bummer but their focus obviously is the wine menu.  I definitely would recommend Grape Street.  I do suggest that you should be able to make reservations regardless of the # of party and mixed drinks would be awesome. =)  Ask for Jason - he will for sure take care of you!",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,3,1,3,F8sxU8fv-uu1EeTJZoE9Ow

When we arrived they attempted to put us outside, when we explained that we hadn't dressed for outside and have allergies, the man argued with us and seemed put out. Eventually we were seated inside. It took them literally an hour to deliver appetizers and then another hour to receive most of our dinner. We ordered calamari. The calamari was nothing but breading and no calamari. One third of our dinner order was totally incorrect. One person in our party had to wait another 30 minutes to receive her totally incorrect order. The entire four hours we were there our server, any sever, came anywhere near our table four times (to take our order, to deliver appetizers, to deliver dinners and to give us our check). To resolve our issues with long wait time and four wrong orders, they offered us free desserts, but only delivered 3 small desserts. The place was also extremely extremely loud.

1100691,2013-04-18,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Don't go here with a pre-arranged large group!  I am not the person to complain to restaurants about anything.. I normally just pay the bill an never come back if i'm unsatisfied. Our neighborhood club booked us for happy hour for approx. 30-40 people well in advance.  The person who arranged it for us told the restaurant that we would need separate checks and they agreed.  When we arrived, the server told us there would be one check per table but that we could each give him the credit card and he would figure it out. He claimed that that was policy, their computer couldn't figure out it per couple, and that our organizer was lying when they said the restaurant agreed to separate checks.  

They didn't staff up for our large group and the poor waiter was extremely busy and dealing with too many tables.   He did not mention the table tip of 18% would be on the total before the happy hour discount.  There was no happy hour menu, nor was this gratutity published.  We have done other group happy hours and we know this is common practice (paying tip on the pre-discount price, and that would be fine.)... however other restaurants have figured out the bills for us.  

The tip on the total would also be fine if he had taken the time to tell each couple what they owed as he had promised.  However he just gave us the bill and we had to figure it out.  The bill was incorrect in that it came in at the total price.  So he redid the bill.  This time it came back with the beer charged at an amount different from the main menu.  He agreed to take off $1 from the total but never did. A person in our group carefully computed each person's meal plus tax plus 18% tip. 

 The UNDISCOUNTED total for 8 people for happy hour came to $190 (we each had one appetizer and one drink....their prices are high on appetizers... for example a Caprese salad with 3 slices of tomato, 3 slices of mozzarella and a splash of basalmic vinegar was $13.)  Anyway we each paid in, and the total check showed we still owed $10.32.  We asked the waiter to figure it out, he refused.  We recomputed our bill and we said we were right and we wanted to leave.  He said he would call the police (can they call the police if you only leave 9% tip?)  

Then he came back and said HE was the manager but he would ""eat"" the difference in the tip even though he felt it wasn't fair; which made us feel bad.  Then he went and got the real manager who recomputed the bill and said, yes we were right.  But before he came back we reluctantly paid the waiter/""false manager"" the difference so we could leave.  

Our group is from one of the largest neighborhoods in Summerlin.   I will say that this event is ultimately going to cost them a lot of business.  We are not ""cheap skates"", they only had to explain how to calculate the total.  And we would have done it that way... but we didn't know.  In fact, ultimately I was the one who figured out WHY there might be a difference.  The fact that they advertise ""2for1"" on drinks but don't say its ""per person"" and the fact that they don't explain the table tip, and nowhere is it in writing... and then had the nerve to say they would call the police on us for basically reducing the tip for their poor service...  UM, even me, mild mannered me, just couldn't put up with it.

The shrimp and crab appetizer was good, the house wine was mediocre, and the caprese salad was not good (tomatoes were hard, cheese was hard).  The happy hours at other upscale restaurants in Summerlin have been far better (food wise) and less expensive and better staffed for large pre-arranged groups.",8cETz6VV2xfVQrLRQFtPYQ,1,0,1,wxpoXC7BByeCSuDh76Cgtw

-I went here with some friends for a late lunch on a Saturday.
The place was nothing to write home about- not horrible but not fantastic either- just... so-so.
-We went at around 3PM and stayed for about two hours on a Saturday. We were the only ones when we first got there, and about three other parties came as we were there. I thought it might have been busier but it wasn't. 
-Three of us ordered the steak salad- it was okay, but I've definitely had better. They could've jazzed it up with some sort of micro-greens or tastier lettuce. It was just iceberg. 
-The service was fine- not overly fantastic but in no way bad.
-I was a bit surprised by the wine list. The restaurant seems to tout itself as a wine place but the wine list wasn't all that extensive. 
-As one reviewer had mentioned- the bread pretty much crumbles. That was pretty odd.
-The ambiance is nice, it's set up to be reminiscent of a wine cellar with exposed brick walls and wrought iron fixtures and furniture. 
-We had separate checks and the bill for one steak salad and a glass of mid price sauv. blanc came out to $26. A little pricey considering I'd probably have been more satisfied with In n Out or  a Panera salad for half the price.

We went during happy hour and had 4 appetizers: baked brie, mussels, shrimp with crab, and calamari.  Baked brie was by far the best, although it was a bit too sweet and the apricot preserves overpowered any taste of nuts or caramelized onions.  My husband commented that the mussels (7 for $14) lacked freshness and were a bit tough (as though they had been overbaked in the oven). The shrimp (7 for $14) was okay but a bit misleading: should have been called shrimp with bread crumbs rather than shrimp with crab (we couldn't taste the crab at all). Calamari was good/average (I've had better, but I've also had worse).  My husband loved it; I thought the coating could have been crispier.  The best part of the calamari was the Rhode Island sauce (jalepenos/peppercini peppers).

We'd perused the menu before going and it looked good. My wife ordered crab stuffed shrimp and the house chopped salad. I ordered the Italian cold cut sandwich. A basket of bread, very good bread, arrived quickly. 

The waiter ordered the wrong chopped salad so I won't comment on that (hey mistakes are human). The crap stuffed shrip was tasty but small. This is the menu description: ""Crab Stuffed Shrimp baked with a seasoned king crab stuffing & served scampi style."" It's kind of hard to stuff a rather small shrimp and although there was a fair bit of stuffing I didn't see much crab.

My Italian sandwich was a little thin on the cold cuts. This is the description: ""Italian Cold Cut cappiccola, genoa salami, ham, imported provolone, topped with hot peppers, marinated onions & tomatoes."" I'm pretty sure I saw three slices of meat but maybe there was more. The biggest problem was the over abundance of balsamic vinegar that overpowered everything else.

Feedback for the restaurant- spend a little time with your FOH staff and find what is and what is not working. Your food is awesome, most of your negative reviews are about service.

Grape Street is a wine bar slash restaurant slash wine shop, with bottles available for purchase, a full menu with HH specials Tues-Fri 3PM-6PM, and plenty of featured wines available by the glass, bottle, and flight- Monday nights there's even a by-the-bottle discount.

The Unique Whites and Syrah flights each include three generous tastings of complementary wines- one of the whites was out, and they subbed in a sauvignon blanc that was one of the cleanest and most refreshing I've tasted! 

Opted for the baked brie appetizer based on reviews here and though it was cooked correctly and well-flavored with carmelized onions and the crunch of hazelnuts, the flavors were a little overpowered by the sweetness of the apricot preserves- as a snack to go with some wine, it worked, but flavors were not to my particular fancy.
Several lunch specials available, the cream of mushroom soup of the day has an awesome Thai twist to the flavor (one of the more inventive ones I've tried), and the selection of herbal teas is large. 

I applaud the service here, they've mastered the art of being available but not being overbearing, so you are free to have your own conversation with friends and wine without constant interruptions or upselling.

The inside is nice. I like the bricks and the wine cellar look. They DO have a lot of wine, so the name is appropriate.

I made the mistake of ordering the raviolis. But I asked the waiter whether I should get the raviolis or the manicotti. I'm Italian. It's all good. He suggested that I get the ravioli dish because the sauce is excellent.

Okay, I'm starving and it took forever for our plates to come.

I got FIVE RAVIOLIS. Are you kidding me? $15 for 5 mediocre-sized raviolis. $3 a piece?!?!?!?

The sauce WAS good, but I wasn't satisfied after eating that. Even if I licked the plate clean I would've been hungry.

I finished eating WAY before anyone else and their meals were the same price. The eggplant parmesan was cooked perfectly, too bad my co-worker ordered it. I wish I had.

Left hungry...

We got the baked brie and it was great! The brie was flavorful and the apples, pears, and grapes were fresh and tasted awesome! We also got the Riesling and merlot wine flights. We wines were great! The reisling was sweet and tart and the merlot was full of woody and fruit notes and complemented the cheese very well. We then had the penne a la vodka, eggplant parmesan,  and the bowtie Olivia. All three dishes were excellent!  The pastas were cooked well and the dishes were full of flavor. To me the eggplant parmesan stood out and would def recommend that for anyone to try. For dessert we had the chocolate cheese mousse, chocolate cake, and the zeppolini.  They have the desserts covered! The chocolate cheese mousse was very tasty and the flavor of  .  Chocolate and cheese work very well together. The chocolate cake was very dense, intense chocolate taste that is well received by the accompanying ice cream. Then the zeppolini!

Service was great. No complaints there. The food... Hmmmmm. ""Beefsteak Tomato and Gorgonzola"" appetizer sounded appealing but was basically two slices of supermarket tomato with some cheese crumbles on it. $15?? No thanks. 

I ordered the steak salad which I remembered being amazing. It was pretty disappointing beef jerky quality steak on a bed of iceberg lettuce. Seriously. I'm usually not a harsh reviewer but I remember having a better steak salad at Quiznos in college. 

Other two entrees ordered were a hamburger and pasta. Both of these were good. 

Bottom line: $90 for three people and nothing extravagant (2 glasses of wine) I was hoping for a better experience... Just didn't deliver this go-round.

This last time was with a friend for a belated birthday dinner.  We had a 50 dollar coupon from restaurant.com.  So we were definitely splurging.  Started with a salad on the specials list, a dungeness salad with greens and mango salsa, we had them divide the plate between us.  Delicious!!!!  We had a a lovely Cava with the meal.  Sooo good!  
Dinner came with a soup or salad, we went soup since we had our salad already.  Chicken curry, with lentils OMG the aroma alone was amazing.  Difficult to not eat it all, but if I had I never would have finished dinner.  We each ordered a fish special.  Me the seared ahi, my friend an Alaskan halibut.  The halibut was blackened with a spicy mango chutney.  Ahi, seared with a soy ginger sauce, and a wasabi cream sauce.  We each ate half and then switched.  We both loved, both dishes.  

Dessert was the fondue with fruit.  YUMMMO!!  Fabulous meal, great service...  but a loser next to us who kept screaming at the waiter across the restaurant.

The place is always bustling with people and I constantly see servers running around with food or drinks. It is lively but sometimes borderline noisy. I don't often comment on the bread but they have deliciously buttery bread.

Baked brie- Ah, the famous appetizer is quite delicious. I would recommend trying it at least once. It can get a bit overwhelming but it is brie after all. 

Baked manicotti- This one is my favorite dish so far. Absolutely delicious. It is also extremely filling and oozing with cheese. 

Penne a la vodka- This is probably my least favorite dish. The flavor is mediocre and yet overwhelming. The penne wasn't cooked properly either.

Linguine with white clam sauce- Decent but nothing amazing. Nothing about the dish stood out and yet nothing wrong with it either. More clam in the sauce would be nice. 

Steak salad- I don't often order salad for dinner unless it is amazing. This one is indeed delicious and probably my second favorite dish here. The steak is wonderfully cooked, tender and flavorful.

1846746,2011-12-11,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"My experience at Grape Street tonight was very disappointing because of the service my boyfriend and I received. When we first arrived to the restaurant there was a group of people waiting to be seated and the hostess was nowhere to be found for about 5 minutes. Which is completely understandable as I work at a restaurant myself. She was pretty nice and courteous and thanked us for waiting multiple times. The restaurant was very beautiful. The ambiance of it was romantic and we had a nice table by the window which was great because we were celebrating an anniversary. But as soon as we got sat, things went downhill. Our server seemed very unhappy to serve us after we mentioned we had bought the 54 dollar 3 course meal Groupon. (Which I am not happy about and will bring up later) Not once did he smile at us, and his responses to our questions were one worded. It felt immediately uncomfortable. I assumed that maybe he was having a bad day or something but nope. We saw that he was smiling at other tables (like the table right next to us) and people at the bar but for some reason it felt like he did not like us at all. I would not say our server was rude but he was definitely not nice to us. After our meal, he dropped the check by saying ""Check."" No ""thank you"" or anything?  The only thing that was good about him was that he was attentive. He did check on us every once in awhile with a, ""You guys ok?"" 

Now to the Groupon. My bill would have normally came out to 77 dollars with the appetizer, 2 main courses, 2 glasses of wine, and 1 dessert. (I did not save much with my groupon costing 54 dollars which is fine because saving any money is good)  BUT NO WHERE ON THE FINE PRINT ANYWHERE DOES IT SAY TIPS WILL BE ADDED ON ITS OWN. The server added gratuity and making it an extra 20 dollars. Total that I spent here? 74 dollars. If the Groupon had stated that there was a required gratuity percentage that was FIXED on the bill, this would have been a bit more fair. Oh, and FYI, with the service we got, this definitely was not worth it. 

Oh, and besides the service, the food was OKAY. I ordered the Triple Cream Brie pasta. It was good but very unhealthy and I will need days of gym time to work off that meal. The bread pudding dessert was okay. I feel like I have had better bread pudding at Vegas buffets.",5fHq1wpNkwnUweigdEgvfQ,7,0,1,VDJvX9U0n2FrX9AmsZgYfA

The 50% off bottles of wine on Mondays nights deal is what brought us in. These other things will be bringing me back:

 1. The cozy ambiance - White Christmas lights wrapped around stair rails, soft candlelight illuminating the tables and exposed brick framing an extensive wine selection were delightful surprises coming from a restaurant tucked in a strip mall.

 2. The tasty food - My friends raved about the Caprese ($13), while I saved myself for a fresh and crisp Caesar Salad ($7) followed by comforting stuffed logs of cheesy goodness - aka the Baked Manicotti ($15) . I also stabbed a bite of my friend's Penne ala Vodka ($16) which I'll definitely be ordering on my next visit, though I'll likely shell out the extra $1 for some chicken to satiate my inner carnivore.

 3. The amicable wait staff - Our server had an awesome sense of humor and his candid opinion of the menu was greatly appreciated. In reading previous reviews after the fact, he thankfully saved one of our party from a disappointing ravioli order.

 4. Did I mention the 50% off bottles of wine on Monday night? Yeah, yeah- I know I said that was what brought me in, but the deal is good enough that I'm allowed to list it again as what's bringing me back.

Exposed brick and a sizeable bar -- it's alot like Nora's (on West Flaming) on the inside.  The entrees and wine are reasonably priced with half price bottles of wine on Mondays. 

As for the dishes,  the penne vodka, BBQ pizza and the specials are top notch.  The caprese salad is amazing -- tomatoes are always red and lush, with pine nuts and generous portions of mozz to boot.  The staff is always on the ball, the bread always hot (and delicious) and even the simplest dishes have a unique, unforgettable taste to them.  The chicken ceasar is a great lunch dish.  

Plus there are generous portions - I always leave with a to-go box and, while I am rarely one to eat leftovers, I never leave a leftover pasta dish from Grape Street untouched.

Great place for a date.  The wine flights are a great way to try something new/get a nice buzz on before dinner.

1862407,2014-02-22,2,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Thanks to my friend Caroline for recommending this one. I knew the minute we walked in the door that it was pay dirt. Yes, occasionally Vegas has a good one. It's not often but it's there if you look hard enough. The one thing that's going to prevent 5 stars though is this place is incredibly over priced.

On entry this venue screams Italian. I love the decor with the lattice backed chairs and the brick walls. Service was great and the staff friendly.

We started with wine. For me a nice Pinot Noir that I enjoyed immensely. It was a very generous serving as I recall. It seemed way more than just the standard 5 ounce pour and as I sipped it throughout, allowing every drop to roll over my tongue, that single glass lasted for the entire meal, start to finish.

We started with the Baked Brie because I was told it was just a little slice of heaven and she wasn't wrong. Pastry pouch filled with brie, toasted hazelnuts, caramelized onions & apricot Preserves. Oh that pastry pouch. it was a filo dough that was the perfect vehicle for such a delectable appetizer.

For my main dish I knew it was going to be the Greek salad: Greek field greens topped with roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, feta cheese, red onions & cucumbers with a lemon oregano dressing. It paired well with the wine and it was delicious with a perfect dressing that was not overpowering.

When you stumble onto something like this. Something you never knew was there, it's a nice little bonus. I don't know how I ever missed this one in all the time I lived there. It must have been before the days of Yelp.

Lunch is quiet but one reviewer said dinner with a live DJ, can be very loud. I would try dinner once but if they crossed that noise line, well, that would pretty much do it in for me. I'm not looking for a lot of noise in a wine bar unless it's live music with lots of action and it being the reason I'm going there in the first place.",83Bgz9gPxmJEYBOVKWXH2A,1,1,4,aH0ZQR24H5lys-R7-AoOPw

1996606,2011-04-03,3,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"This was our first time at Grape Street and we were with people that come here quite a bit.

I like the restaurant itself, the chairs are REALLY comfortable.  There are three options of places to sit: at a table, at the bar or outside.

-1 Star: it's CRAZY dark inside!  I had to use my phone light to read the menu (im in my 20's people, so my eyes are still good!)  Definitely not a place to take someone on your first date since you won't be able to check them out.

-2 Star: our waiter was a ""close talker"" and kinda freaked me out.  He was nice but for some reason I didn't really care for him.  He was super slow with everything.  At the end of dinner, we asked to split the bill and they said that they couldn't.  So we asked if we could give them two credit cards, and they said yes.  Why didn't they offer that option to us?

Another Con: they brought out two dishes and probably 3 minutes later brought out the other two.  Kinda weird that the two people just sat there until the other two people were served.  Not sure why they did that.

My husband and I both ordered the Mussels: New Zealand mussels sautéed in either red or white wine sauce and baked with parmesan cheese.  Its on the app menu, but we ordered it for our main course.  We had it with the white sauce and it had very good flavor, just a little overcooked as they were chewy.  

Our one friend ordered the Jumbo Cheese Ravioli: romano, mozzarella & ricotta cheese ravioli topped with a pink sauce.  This is what he orders there all the time and says its good!

Our other friend ordered Angel Hair Primavera: vegetables with pine nuts & fresh herbs in either red or white sauce.  She ordered the red sauce and said it was good.

I think for the four of us, four drinks the bill came to $85 and change.  Our friends had a coupon for 20% off that was given to them the last time they were at the restaurant.

2279570,2015-07-03,1,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"I've consistently heard good things about Grape Street, and there is always a wait at their Downtown Summerlin location, so when I saw a Groupon, I snatched it up. Really glad I had the Groupon, or I would have left even more annoyed after my mediocre-at best experience last night. 

It was later when we got there, but still 2-3 hours before closing. It was fairly empty, but the hostess seated us beside the alternative exit. It was great having people going in and out behind me all evening. *sarcasm* 

I got a glass of wine, and we started out with a tapas platter. Our server brought us a basket of bread that equates to elementary school cafeteria hot rolls, except these were cold and hard. The tapas plate was okay- 4 olives, 3 wonton type things I'm guessing were the ""goat cheese cigars"" - I was expecting little rolls of herbed goat cheese..these honestly tasted like pizza rolls. There were also 3 meatballs, four pieces of toasted Italian bread, grilled eggplant, tatziki, and a bulb of roasted garlic. Not horrible, not mind-blowing.

Despite it being slow, the salads we ordered for our entrees took quite a while. When I asked for a description of ""The Summerlin Salad"" it was described as ""a bed of greens, with grilled chicken, avocado, tomatoes, red onions, and grilled squash."" Okay- that sounded nice and summery, I got that. My husband got the chopped salad...I should have also gotten the chopped salad. 

Now let me offer the disclaimer that I don't mind paying $20 for a good salad. What I do mind paying $20 (well, $19) for, is a lump of shredded iceberg lettuce, ice-cold-under ripe tomatoes, 3 thin slices of avocado, a scoop of chick peas, a scoop of black beans, some undercooked butternut squash, and 6 tiny strips of chicken breast. It was like something a ""sandwich artist"" would make after he made someone a $5 foot long. Seriously the worst salad I've ever eaten. I don't send food back (""Does that look like spit to you?"") but I almost made an exception last night. 

We didn't stick around for dessert, and luckily the $50 groupon covered both our salads and appetizer, leaving just the two glasses of wine...the high point of my meal.  

The staff was nice enough, but I doubt I would come back, at least to this location. Seriously, shredded.iceberg.lettuce.",45mRoEbA_IvHIyUHpiABBw,1,0,2,clGsgL65Vj_Bm7gc4FWt_w

The chef was standing around in the middle of the dining room coughing into his hands, scratching his nose and wearing a dirty apron. Gross. All this while watching his wait staff run arounds without a thought of running some food or helping them get out of the weeds. He was just texting on his phone or drinking a beer at the bar. Really unprofessional and disrespectful towards his staff.

Now for the ambiance- the place was cute but for some reason the lights were placed behind the fans making a strobe light effect on all the tables. If this doesn't give you an epileptic seizure it will definitely give you a minor headache.

All this could have been overlooked if the food was good. But it wasn't. Quite the opposite actually. The bread sent to the table was stale and frankly would not have been good even if it was fresh. $40 for some dinky frozen shrimp with soggy breadcrumbs and an undressed salad with dry chicken was unimpressive.

Everything looked good on the menu, so I asked the waiter for suggestions.  Right off the bat he mentioned the tuna carpaccio (off menu item).  So we ordered that, mussels made with white wine, a side of meatballs, and a large house salad (rasberry vinaigrette).  Tuna carpaccio and meatball stood out.  Tuna was spread very thin over a large plate.  Served with capers, egg bits, and drizzled with wasabi and a soy sauce.  The bites had a little kick, but I would definitely tell everyone to try this.  The meatball side were two baseball sized meatballs served in their marinara. (I know, baseball doesn't sound appealing, does it?  But it's a perfect size description, so get the thought of sweaty baseball players out of your head, and think of the meatball again.  It was an  excellent meatball, moist and filling.  The house salad had Gorgonzola and apple with their homemade dressing.  Nice light addition to the meal.  Mussels (you have a choice of what kind of wine you want them to make it with).  Also excellent, we were full, we didn't need to get this last dish. We were struggling by the end of the meal.

Yes, I agree, the prices are a little more than you would get at Denny's, but it's not thaaaaaaaat expensive.  Salads were around 10 dollars.  All the sandwiches on the menu are 10 dollars.  The apps range 10-15 dollars.  Burger is 12 dollars.  Pizzas are 20 dollars.  Tiffanie R I have no clue how you racked up a $200 bill!!! 

Place has a very cool, winery vibe.  Dimly lit.  Waiters are all very attentive yet relaxed.  The place is packed (business crowd, perhaps there was one hipster?).

First time is ok, second time is questionable, but three times is a definite job to you and a don't bother going back again. Waiters can care less about you if using a Groupon voucher because they will add their 18% tip no matter what and hope you tip them additionally.

We had a Groupon for a wine flight and two appetizers or one appetizer and one cheese plate- never was given an explation of the cheese plate and didn't see it on the menu so we went with the two appetizers.  We told our server we would be ordering food as well. I assumed after we told the server we were intending to order an entree he would tell us the specials....but no. I had to walk over to the chalk board to read myself. 

The mussels in their white wine sauce were great- perfectly cooked and seasoned. The baked brie was lacking in brie as the previous reviewers mentioned.

I ordered the Angel Hair Pasta Primavera with White Sauce and Shrimp. The pasta came out in a white wine sauce instead of a white sauce and was flavorless and tasted watered-down. Also, there weren't any whole pieces of shrimp. Instead, there were diced shrimp in the dish. All of this would have been acceptable had our server came over once to ask about our food and I would have asked him about the dish. No one ever asked us about our appetizers nor our meal. I ate only a couple bites of the angel hair pasta and the server just came by and asked if I wanted it boxed up. 

Our waters were never refilled. Nor offer of a dessert. 

If any manager or chef from the restaurant are reading this, I would love an explanation of my experience. I was looking forward to a birthday dinner and it was ruined by the service. 

When presented with the check our server made sure to point out and circle with a pen the original price and the price that was discounted because of the Groupon. We already knew that you need to tip on the original price- so it was very insulting.

We entered the restaurant about 6:30pm, no hostess in sight, so we sat down and waited. She eventually walked over, no apology or welcome, just the standard"" how many"". We sat and got water and bread fairly quickly and ordered the Fried Calamari. It was over battered, chewy and the marinara sauce was flavorless. 

12 "" peperoni pizza was good, but not $15 good. Chicken Marsala was dry, sauce bland and potatoes were disgusting. I sent it back and got the Chicken Gorgonzola, which was ok, but overpriced for the portion size and amount of chicken. My girlfriend got the Blackened Salmon Caesar Salad.  She said it was fine, but nothing special. It seems like all the portions are lunch size, but at dinner prices.  The bill was $50, after a $25 coupon. All we had is listed above, and just water for drinks. 

Also, the Chef was at the bar drinking a beer chatting with a lady. Still with his chef coat and apron on.

Hubby and I both opted for the short ribs with sautéed spinach and mushroom risotto. Would have loved to have sliced, as opposed to diced mushrooms in the risotto. The diced mushrooms provided some flavor, but it was minimal. The sauce on the spare ribs was incredibly rich. A layered presentation, as opposed to the plate being divided Into three potions would have even more pleasing to the eye.

Hubby enjoyed his Caesar salad. The house salad was a bit heavy in the red onions, as well as the vinaigrette dressing. I love red onions, but the amount used made it tough to taste any of the others salad ingredients. If you're going for the house, ask for the dressing on the side, so that you can regulate its use.

When I walked in, I was greeted with lots of yummy smells... bread, garlic, butter.... everything that makes my mouth water.

So... they have some really nice wines.... from low to high end.  The only drawback that I encountered with their list was that what they had on the list wasn't entirely accurate... basically... what they need to do is update it based on what is current in their stock and NOT what they had carreid in the past or what was on order to be delivered.  It makes it hard to select wine when the menu isn't accurate.

In any case, the wines we did have were quite nice.

The tapas plate was perfect for 3 people.  
And their entree salads were big but not too big (like Cheesecake Factory).  The steak salad is almost a while steak on top of a bed of salad greens.  So... if you want steak and a salad.... get this one.

I got the chicken copped salad.... it was a little bland and I was disappointed in the avocados because they were hard and plain... usually avocados add a rich, creaminess to everything and these were just not ripe yet.

I'm sitting there like  great tattoos and style I guess if your into that but just take my order and get my food you server. The lady that cleans my toilets at my house and makes a smooth 26k a year take home shows more respect.  I usually tip very well as I served tables and bartender through college.  This place no thank you.  Food is good and promotions work well when taking large groups out but I'm starting to think it's not worth the abuse.  I asked a server for his recommendation on a wine for a fish special they were running and he told me ""everybody's taste buds ate different so I wouldn't know what you like. "" no shit  but what would YOU recommend.  Sorry jerk I own a landscape company and don't sling food all night so I don't know the buzz on this dish. Actually writing this review I think made my decision to start taking groups of clients to the place up the street.  Not saying their name because This isn't about them.

They were very accommodating even though they were full (Thank you again). They did half off bottles of wine and champagne and it was delicious (great deal)! They also had a fun little band with live music. The age group attending seemed to be late 30s and up. We were the youngest there but the service definitely didn't discriminate and I love that. 

    Our friends ordered a lot of different dishes. They all looked really good and they seemed to really enjoy them. Being vegan, I couldn't try them. I ordered the roasted veggie. It was crispy and pretty good. It did come out with dairy on it, after I told them i was vegan... But they were super accommodating and remade it for me. The garlic bulb was a really cool idea. I added some to my sandwich. I love love love garlic. 

The decor is beautiful. Lots of rod iron, heavy tables and furniture, and comfortable seating. The wine display was pretty cool too. 

The service was pretty good. They were attentive and our waters never ran dry. They were also super knowledgable about the wine (extensive list to choose from). They only serve beer, wine and champagne. Not a problem for us;) Over all, we will definitely be returning.

3062188,2012-07-04,1,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"When I moved to Vegas back in 06' one of things that I missed was a relatively small, locally owned restaurant with decent food.  I didn't actually find this place until 2009 and have visited probably about a 15 times.

I have to agree with Tiffanie - depending on what you order it can be a bit pricey, however, they have Groupons on occasion as well as 3 O'Clock Club offers which can be pretty decent.  Most recently - I picked up 2 of them that were $20 for $50 worth of food.

Normally when we come here we don't go overboard.  We'll usually each order an entree and either one app or one dessert.  Since we aren't really drinkers - we don't normally order alcohol although on occasion we might splurge for an after dinner port.

The service is normally decent - nothing 5 star but not TGI Friday's either.  

The only thing that I dislike about this place is that when it gets busy it gets busy.  I enjoy having some space between myself and the tables surrounding me and during busy times - you can hear everyone's conversation near you.  They do have an outdoor patio area but I just can't bring myself to eat al fresco in a strip mall looking at a Walgreen sign :)",Zemr8otoe_xhutAI62rWqQ,1,0,4,CZs3MvgkHiIKzmw-KcMLRw

But, that's the most I can say, it's not a bad place. The wine list at Grape Street is always pretty good for sure. Expensive but good. The food however is a different story.

  Most of the dishes are good, but a little over-priced given how simple they are. As an example, the chicken penne with gorgonzola is delicious, but after eating it once I replicated the recipe at home for less than $12 to serve 4 people. Most of their recipes are similarly simple and easily made at home. 

  Tonight I had the large steak salad. The steak was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. The problem is the greens used in the salad are cheap iceberg lettuce. This dish could be made with fresh spinach and some arugula and it would have been perfect. Charge me another dollar for the extra 50 cents spent on upgraded ingredients and I'm all in. My wife's chopped salad had the same iceberg lettuce and our thoughts were the same regarding it. 

  The dessert we had tonight was pretty darn good. Banana Egg Rolls! Bananas wrapped in a light phillo dough, deep fried and served with butter pecan ice cream. It was truly delicious. Our waiter recommended a Marenco Brachetto sparkling red wine as an accompanyment. It was just right. If you go to Grape Street be sure to order this dessert combo.

  Grape street has a great atmosphere and seems to do good business, but a little more attention to quality of ingredients would make it a can't miss. If I could give 3 1/2 stars I would, because 3 is too low, but 4 is too high.",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,3,1,3,NGkhOpFIWCQ_lUXwADelRg

3274991,2012-04-01,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"I'll preface this review by saying that my parents used to take me to this restaurant sometimes as a kid and I always LOATHED coming here. I always thought the food was terrible and that it was needlessly stuffy.

Flash forward about ten years, and here I am coming to Grape Street with Mom and actually finding it to be pretty good!

We came down on a Thursday night around 6PM and the place was about half-packed. Over the course of the two hours we were there, the room would fill up. Just a hint that reservations might be a good idea.

In any case, we were seated promptly by a hostess. The server came by after a little while and brought us water and bread, though after that point it would be spotty how often he would get back to the table. 

We ended up having The Tapas Plate ($13) as an appetizer, and it's really the way to go just because you get so much food! In the plate, you get a Roasted Garlic Bulb, three Greek Meatballs, a mound of Roasted Eggplant and roasted Peppers, three Goat Cheese Cigars, a handful of Kalamata Olives, four or five slices of Baguette Bread and a bowl of Taziki Sauce. We pretty much devoured everything on the plate.

For the main dish, Mom had the Steak Salad ($13), which she's been having ever since the place opened, so they must be doing something right. 

I had the Chicken Parmesan ($21) and it was pretty decent. It came with an excellent Caeser Salad and a pretty good-sized portion of pasta.

The ambience of the dining room is pretty neat too. It's quite dark, and would work well for someone going out on a romantic date. Although the older gentleman that was singing and playing acoustic guitar would sort of throw off that ambiance; the room would have done much better without him.

I can't even begin to stress how SLOW the service is in this restaurant though. This meal literally lasted a little over two hours, when it probably should have only been an hour at most. I enjoyed spending the time with my mom, but we would have enjoyed it more if we didn't have to keep waiting so long for each course to come out, or for refills of our drinks.

Favorite Dinner:

3514815,2012-11-24,2,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Monday night is a great time to stop by this off-the-strip neighborhood restaurant because bottles of wine are 50% off. The food was better than expected, too. One of their more popular items is baked brie ($13). It's a hunk of brie sitting on top of caramelized onions and wrapped in flaky and delicate pastry. It's a massive baseball-sized mound with a knife piercing the top. It's surrounded by toast, pear, apples, and grapes. This is one appetizer meant to be shared.

The mussels ($13) were tough, but the white wine sauce that they were sitting in was phenomenal. Any bread that we had left over was used to sop up every last drop of sauce.

The caesar salad was decent and the tomato soup was creamy and full of flavor, but too chilled for my liking.

The chicken parmesan ($21) was good, but standard fare. The three thin breasts of chicken were coated in a breading that didn't stand a chance of staying crispy under all the sauce and cheese poured on top of it. A side of spaghetti accompanied the dish.

The ribeye special was beautifully charred and still tender and medium rare in the interior. It can't compete with top steakhouses in quality, but the wine and mushroom sauced boldly enhanced the flavor. A few carrots, asparagus, and potatoes surrounded the steak.

The restaurant isn't exactly kid-friendly, but there were several kids around, including ours. There's no kid's menu but they were happy to make a plain grilled chicken breast and fries for our little one.

On a second visit we started with their tapas plate. The Greek meatballs were the best thing on the plate. Savory and full of bold flavors, I wish there were more than three of them. The other items -- the goat cheese cigars, olives, and vegetables were decent, but paled in comparison to the meatballs.

The plating of the caprese salad was different than your typical caprese. The end caps of the tomatoes were sliced off and stacked with mozzarella and topped with toasted pine nuts and balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

We shared the short rib entree and the kitchen was nice enough to split the dish on to separate plates. I enjoyed the the depth of flavor of the sauce, although it was a touch sweet. But, the beef was too tough. Add to that a dry, chalky risotto and a minuscule serving of carrots and it was mediocre dish.

Service was spotty on both visits. The first time due to our waiter being asked to wait on numerous tables scattered around the restaurant. The second time the waiter and kitchen staff were hanging out at the bar watching a Notre Dame game.

Grape Street is a clear notch below the top off-strip restaurants, but it's worth a return visit.

I had to call to confirm this was the correct location. 

Once we arrived we were seated promptly along the brick wall. Loved the ambience, it reminds me of my favorite bars and restaurants back home in the South Side of Pittsburgh. It was a Wednesday night with a good amount of people dining. Waiter greeted us with bread and water. We ordered the Crab Stuffed Shrimp as an app which was really good.  There weren't many items on the menu that I was in the mood for so I went with the famous steak salad and it didn't disappoint (I ordered it with romaine lettuce instead of iceberg). The steak was flavored so well but the rest of the salad was pretty plain. My only gripe is the description of the salad said it came with feta cheese and kalamata olives.  I asked to hold the feta but the olives were also no where in sight!  I love olives :/. The boy ordered Stuffed Manicotti and he loved it as well. 
 
We passed on dessert though as my favorite pink box donuts are right around the corner.

3825611,2010-08-07,5,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"***This review is for the bar counter service only***

This is a really hard review for me to write....why?  Because I love this place, but last night the service was so bad I have to give it 2 Stars.

The Better Half and I enjoy going out to places that offer flights of wine.  We enjoy sampling different vineyards without the cost of paying for a full glass of wine.  Grape Street is our go to place for this.  Normally we dine at a table and enjoy a full meal with our flights.  However, last night we decided to go to the bar because we didn't plan to eat.  It was a mistake.

The bartender's service was horrible.  We had to get our own menus.  We each ordered a flight of the Zinfandels and glasses of water.  Once she poured the flights of wine, she didn't bother to tell us anything about the wine.  Normally, they will tell you which glass contains which wine and will give you a brief description of the taste & flavors.  She was more concerned with this guy who was sitting at the bar.  Keep in mind that there was only 5 people at the bar including my Wife & I when we arrived.  Within 20 minutes, there was only 3 of us remaining at the bar.....she spent all of her time chatting up the other customer.  Meanwhile, our glasses of water sat empty.

I finished my flight before the Better Half finished hers.....that's always the case.  I was interested in having another glass and was considering one of the Cabs....however, she was nowhere to be found.  The bar was left unattended and who knows where she went.  Finally, she appeared with food for the other customer.  I waited until she delivered his order, then I flagged her down....she says ""Just one second"".....then she bolts from the bar.....what the ??  I watched her as she walked around the restaurant and she came back empty handed.....what was so freaking important that you couldn't take a drink order from a customer at the bar?  

When she finally came over, I asked if I could sample one of the Cabs before I made my decision......she said ""sure"" and poured me a small sample of the Cab I requested.  Then, she walked away to do something else in the back.....didn't she want to know if I wanted to order a full glass?  Come on!  By this time, the Better Half said screw this.....let's go have a glass of wine somewhere else where we will be served.

A server from the restaurant came to the bar, looked over at us and could see we were irritated....asked if we needed anything, I said Check Please.  She went in the back and found the bartender....who came over and said ""Didn't you want another glass of wine?""......ha, not tonight and not with your crappy service.  I paid the check and we were on our way to another place.

I didn't get the bartender's name, but she had dirty blond curly hair.....I remember who she is because when we come back, I will be sure to avoid the bar if she's working.

This place use to be so much better than this.  I don't know what's going on.

Will I return?  Yes, but will only sit at the bar if she's not the bartender.  We'll sit in the dining area if necessary.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,10,7,2,XVtqyestAQeOAn3i8llPNg

We told her we had already ordered with Luis. She didn't introduce herself, she came to check on us a couple times but she didn't make any conversation with us the entire time.

3912900,2013-12-29,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"The reviews about the poor service are indeed true. The Chef and Host greeted my family and I, and were both quite pleasant and accommodating. The server, however, was not. I'm not positive, but I believe his name was Christian (he was full of tattoos on his arms and had a little facial gruff). The gent had zero personality and was totally arrogant. What was even stranger, was that he acted like we were annoying him by just being there. It was very bizarre.

We promptly let the server know that we had a Groupon that had recently expired and he told us that it would only be worth the value of its' purchase. Although I have had friends who had servers that let them use their expired Groupons at GS, I was fine with the fact that I could only use it at face value. It is my suspicion that it was the presentation of the Groupon that brought on the crummy attitude. Although using a Groupon, we are not cheap Applebee's customers, but rather returning customers looking for a slight discount. I dunno. Never-the-less, the guy was a rude and pretentious.

The wine selection is amazing and regardless of the cold shoulder, we at least expected a delicious meal. The portabella sandwich and veggie platter were over-priced, yet very tasty and did not disappoint. The chopped house salad  (lettuce, red onion, tomato, apple & blue cheese crumbles) was another story. I have had it many times before and always enjoyed it. This time it was completely tasteless and waterlogged. There were a few little crumbles of blue cheese that I had to search for and for $10 it was a big thumbs-down.

With the many restaurants Vegas has to offer, GS needs to reconnect with their patrons.",wB-ebDppZjl8nnpC3n184Q,6,0,2,9-M90pzIvAEjttVJpnlV4w
3946624,2010-05-08,1,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Chugging right along.

I have been coming to Grape Street for over a decade.  Despite living on the other side of town, I make the trek just to have lunch or dinner, even just for desert if the mood struck.

On this most recent visit, I had the steak salad (the champagne vinaigrette is seriously good).  As usual, the steak was seasoned just right and cooked a perfect medium rare.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and there was just enough dressing for taste without drowning the whole thing miserably (I eat slow, so it's important otherwise everything will be a soggy mess).   

My wife ordered a side salad (with the champagne vinaigrette) and an order of calamari. Grape Street has always made it just right: light on the batter, cooked to a nice crispness on the outside and delicately soft on the inside.  It still surprises me that so few places (neighborhood joints, mostly) overcook their calamari until it's a chewy heap.  Over a decade and Grape Street still pwns calamari!

The mother-in-law ordered the chicken gorgonzola pasta.  It was typically rich and filling.  It's always been a little too rich for my taste and requires wine to wash it down (not that that's a bad thing...).  If we could do a half order, it would be perfect.

For desert, we ordered the bread pudding and chocolate souffle cake.  The bread pudding is one of my favorites in town.  Great texture; never mushy, never hard.  I normally don't like sauce on my bread pudding, but Grape Street's is absolutely delicious.  The souffle cake is one of our staples and it's usually moist and rich, yet light.  However, on this occasion, it was hard on the edges and not as airy as it usual.  Almost like it wasn't quite fresh (I know it's not made to order, but still...).  

Areas for improvement?  The menu, while my family has their favorites, is predictable and hasn't changed since we first started coming here.  The specials are well and good, but IMHO, the menu could use a refresh.  The service has always been reliable, but on our last few visits, the server made little to no effort to up-sell (I'm oblivious to it, but it's an important aspect of coming off as a professional service provider).  

I've never walked away disappointed with a meal here.  There is room for improvement; but, I guess if it ain't broke, why fix it?  In the past, I would have easily marked this a 4 star restaurant.  Based on current trends, it is just average among a plethora of competitors.  To me, 3 stars isn't a bad rating, it just shows that Grape Street is reliable with room for improvement.",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,1,1,3,6jvPvV67dqjWZkB3vYn7Cg

It took a really long time for our waitress to take our order and for the food to come out. Also our waitress seemed to be the only server in the entire restaurant, which seems to explain the slow service.

I will state that my burger was cooked the way I asked and the ratatouille was tasty, but I was not a fan of their prices.

But it doesn't mean the food wasn't good. 

A couple times we've noticed the awesome music selection. They were playing Massive Attack and what have you one evening. We asked and they said it was just an XM station or something. Nice mellow, downtempo to match the underlit dinner light. 

Food is Good. I come for lunch, dinner, or just to sit at the bar for apps and wine and get my buzz on. My favorite apps are the Caprese ($13), Tapas plate ($13), Baked Brie ($13), and Poached Salmon Platter ($19). There are lots of rich foods like Triple Creme Brie linguine ($16). Mm, carbs. 

They also have sandwiches and pizzas. 

Prices are decent for the portion sizes and whatever. 

Large wine list. Knowledgeable, hip, young staff. 

The furniture is a little uncomfortable, but I guess it fits with the whole ""Ooh, I'm in a wine cellar"" deal. Its a cozy little place. They have a private little dining room, large enough to accommodate a party of 10-ish. They also have outdoor seating on the patio ... for the three weeks out of the year that the weather is nice. 

Mondays they have 50% off bottles of wine (off regular wine list). Can't beat that. Unless you go to the Lee's down the road. 

Also, ask about the service industry special. Last I checked, it was Sunday nights, 25% off anything with proof that you work in the service industry. Check on the details, though, because it might be for FOOD service industry only and these specials change frequently.

It was not horribly busy when we showed up on a Friday night around 6:15p but it got busy fairly quickly.  They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more.

It was pretty noisy, but I attribute that to people enjoying their dinner companions.  :)

First of all, like some of the other reviews said, try the baked brie!  It's awesome.  

I had linguine and clams in white sauce and the hubs had one of the specials; braised ribs I think.  Lots of clams on the pasta, the sauce was good.  The braised rib roast was really good though, highly recommend.  

We've been looking for a good Italian eatery and were very glad we tried Grape Street!

Went there with a friend and we both had gift cards/certificates which perfectly covered the price of our wine & appetizers & tip.  We were there during happy hour.  The waiter came back and said that my gift card had no money on it!!  I was COMPLETELY surprised since I have never used it (why would I keep a card if I had already used it) and wondered if the fact that I received it about a year ago would matter.  They said they never expire.  I even had the little card holder it came in with the person's writing showing it was from them to me and the amount.  They kept asking if I could remember who activated it in the restaurant.  I kept telling them it was a GIFT to me so how would I know who activated it.  

The bottom line is that they wouldn't honor it.  I'm sure they get scammed, but, I thought it was pretty obvious that it just wasn't activated.  In other words, they got paid for it, but, they didn't properly activate.  It was only $25 and I thought the proper thing to do was to just honored it.  BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE in my opinion!!!!!

4484521,2013-12-16,1,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"We haven't been to Grape Street in quite a while, but returned last night for a friend's milestone birthday party. (We have no idea which one, because his wife is paranoiacally phobic about anyone finding out her age).  Despite the chilly temperature, the party was held in the patio in front of the restaurant.  There are heaters, portable and permanent, but the portable heaters kept going out when the propane ran out.  And the space is not fully enclosed.  And since our seats were at the end of the U-shaped table; I had to wear my winter coat throughout the meal, but my hands and feet stayed frozen, and my discomfort certainly didn't lend itself to me writing a rave review.

We had a set menu, but aside from the tapas plate, which was pre-chosen, we had our choice of soups or salads and about six entree choices.  The host provided Sangria, soda and iced tea.  

The tapas plate had some kind of taquillo, some eggplant, pita triangles, baked brie, and a dish of tzatziki sauce in the center of the plate.  Only the brie stood out.  It was delicious, despite being ice cold and nearly gone by the time it got to me.  The rest was okay, but forgettable.

Hubby and I both had the Basil-Tomato Soup, which was too creamy for my taste.  It seemed too much like Campbell's Cream of Tomato, with chunks of canned tomatoes added along with a sprinkling of fresh basil, to make it seem homemade.  Maybe it was, and my husband, who has a decidedly less-discerning palate, liked it just fine, but I wasn't blown away by it.

For the entree, I ordered the Penne in Vodka sauce, with chicken.  Again, a very heavy and overly-salted sauce over nicely cooked pasta.  The sauce suspiciously tasted just like the tomato soup.  What saved it was that it turned out to be spicy.  The chicken, though, was unbearably dry and tough.  My husband also had penne, but with a gorgonzola sauce, even heavier and saltier than mine, that drowned the pasta.  He thought it was okay but, again, nothing special.

While our meals were passable, they weren't great enough to justify the slightly elevated prices, and we're not running back anytime soon.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,2,3,FAvxeDyiGT6Gd25F-eqIvA

First of all their menu hasn't changed in I don't know how long but I remember getting the same thing over and over again. They have an interesting pasta that has brie and Walnuts.   I don't eat walnuts so I asked if they could leave them out. Which one would think would be a very simple thing to do. But they gave me some song and dance about how they couldn't leave the walnuts out which to me means their food is premade and I don't like that.  So instead I get a bowtie pasta with just vegetables but I swear I think they just use canned olives in it.  Now they serve you warm bread and butter which is an excellent way to start a meal and a decent wine list and pasta is pasta and it's always a yummy thing to eat however it's just done average here.,m96igVtonhN98jfF63lr8Q,0,0,3,aw190mBZCj6Nz91FVUZRjw
4573735,2014-12-06,1,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Grape Street is a reliable, friendly and tasty place for lunch and dinner. Though it's been a few years since I've been back, everything was good on a recent visit. Three stars seems a little light -- so, it's somewhere betw three and four.

After reading all the reviews that say how uninspired the steaks are here, I opted for something different. When in doubt, go with a couple small dishes - so I did. The steamer clams were plenty, tasty and served in a large bowl, as opposed to the more traditional Pot. While that detracted a little from the mystique, it made the clams that much easier to access and share. And share you should, unless you're just an out of your mind hungry brute. Though some complained they were a bit sandy, I absolutely did NOT have any issue with them. In fact, they were a hit at the table and I was lucky to get my mitts on a few myself ! 

The other dish I got was the Caesar salad. Straight-forward, no frills, but certainly everything I was hoping for.

So why not more than three stars? I don't know. It's a large space, and man, was it cold. And even though it's Vegas, it was November, and I was ch-ch-chilly. 

The table bread was meh - I didn't even request extra bread to sop up the Steamer broth, which in some people's eyes, is a sin. 

Partially concerned about getting a steak at a place that's got steaks but isn't known for steaks -- even though they have a bunch on their menus; 

Service was good and friendly, so no issue there. I would definitely like to revisit Grape Street again before too much time. I love how they've been there for a bunch of years - and I hope they keep it going.

4818622,2011-10-30,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"10/29/11 DINNER.

Mixed emotions on this one. Came hoping to love, left a little disappointed.

ME: Linguine w/ triple cream brie w/ toasted walnuts, mushrooms, prosciutto, fresh herbs & Parmesan. Added chicken for $3 more, per waiter's suggestion. There was brie, even some chunks, but it wasn't very strong, in aroma or flavor. (When I drank a sip of Point Noir with a bite, that seemed to bring out the brie.) There were absolutely no mushrooms, which were greatly missed in this dish. And there was hardly any prosciutto, again, missed. Basically I ended up with walnuts & chicken in linguine in a creamy cheese sauce. And I didn't need the chicken after all, I think the dish would've been better without it. Overall, an OK dish, but not as interesting since it didn't follow the menu description. (FOLLOWUP: I had some left over the next day, and it actually improved in brie flavor having set overnight in the fridge.)

SPOUSE: Filet Oscar, which was  the classic filet of beef topped w/ king crab and Bearnaise sauce, w/ asparagus, then drizzled w/ Cabernet sauce, all on top of leek mashed potatoes. OK, there was a POOL of Cabernet sauce, and hardly any Bearnaise. The beef was good, for a filet, and exactly as ordered, rare. But for the money spent, spouse wasn't thrilled. Good, not great. His meal did come with choice of a salad or soup, he chose butternut squash soup, which was good, tasted more like pumpkin, earthy & sweet.

DESSERT: We split the pear dessert, which was again good, not great. We also split a glass of Chilean dessert sauvignon blanc, which the waiter brought in separate glasses, a nice touch. The wine was recommendable: fruity, aromatic, not too sweet.

WINES: All we drank were wines-by-the-glass. It was nice to find a Patricia Green Pinot Noir on a by-the-glass list. The cheaper-line-by-Schraumsberg Mirabelle sparkling rose was better than I had expected. (LONG time ago, I had tried Mirabelle Brut and thought it smelled/tasted like bug spray! Obviously Schramsberg has improved the wines on their secondary program!) And the nebbiolo was fine. But the bill for 4 glasses of wine skyrocketed the cost of our experience.

SERVICE/VENUE: Attentive, nice waiter. Nice setting. (We had to sit outside, cuz it was crazy full inside, but the heater sufficed for the outdoors at night.)

OVERALL: If we had not had our $50 Groupon with us, we would've paid $170+ for this meal, which I found rather crazy. I'm glad I finally tried Grape Street, but I won't go outta my way to return.

PS: I wish we could have tried the food at Nora's Wine Bar, which closed recently. The only day we visited, we only got to do wines. THAT menu looked incredible, authentic Italy Italian, AND they had a fantastic selection of wines by the glass as well. Sigh.",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,1,0,3,Guat5EzFEPmEhndp2XU1TQ

4851950,2013-08-13,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"I was visiting some friends in Las Vegas. They recommended this restaurant because they previously had a good experience coming here for wine and appetizers.

We were seated quickly and received friendly service. The wine was good, but the mark-up was high. This is probably how Grape Street can afford to offer half-off bottles on Mondays.

We ordered a cheese appetizer and the roasted garlic. The cheese appetizer was quickly dropped off, but the roasted garlic was missing in action. We did not have an opportunity to ask about it until we ordered our dinners, at which time the server said, ""You should have flagged me down!"" Eh, we don't drop $300 on dinner to have to flag staff members down. The roasted garlic ended up arriving at almost the same time as our main courses and tasted like it had been under a heat lamp for too long. Not fresh! Yuck!

I ordered the seafood fridiavolo with the white wine olive oil sauce rather than the spicy red sauce because that is how my dad used to make it and I feel red sauce overpowers seafood like shrimp and scallops. Our waitress mentioned red sauce was more popular. My husband ordered the same thing as me.

When the main courses came out, my husband's and mine came with the wrong sauce. Our server apologized and offered to have them remade. This left us with three unappealing options: eat something we didn't order, have our friends wait with their food getting cold on the table or nasty under a heat lamp, or have our friends start their dinner while we waited for new dishes. We chose to eat what was brought to us because eating together is more important to us than perfect food. I was willing to let this slide because life is too short to get stressed over little stuff, but I found out later that one of the people who paid was upset because no monetary compensation was offered. The seafood was overcooked and some tasted less than fresh but not spoiled yet. The scallops were tiny, about the size of large chick peas. Kind of disappointing.....

My husband ordered an espresso for dessert.There were a lot of grounds in his cup, which was replaced upon his request. Some other thing happened that upset a member of our party, but I'm not sure what. 

Our bill for 5 people was over $300 due to drinks/appetizers/salads. For that price, the experience at Grape Street was disappointing. Apparently after we left a member of our party who paid half called to complain and was given a hard time but came to an agreement with the manager. Grape street will not be a part of our twice a year las Vegas trips. This is unfortunate because the service was friendly if imperfect and the ambiance was nice.

If a manager reads this, please consider implementing a best-practice procedure that is common in Detroit. Ask your servers to inform the manager-on-duty about unhappy customers, even if those customers are not making a scene. Then have the manager-on-duty make it right.",FvGHbvrcgUxlQSojRqJsXA,5,0,2,MMEmjY04gCRCE3oYE7Y2mw

4957158,2012-11-22,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"This was not our first experience at Grape Street, but it may be our last.

We made reservations for a party of 5 a day before we went to dinner. When we arrived instead of being given a table that comfortably sat all of us, we were given a 4 top with an extra chair uncomfortably added on one end... next to the bar.

Being right next to the bar it was very loud. A couple of men were making a commotion over some sporting event on the television. Had we wanted this experience we would have gone to a sports bar. As it turns out, one of the men was apparently some sort of staff member as he went around later and loudly asked some other tables how things were. We may let this slide had the restaurant been busy and we had just shown up without a reservation, but there was another section far from the bar that was almost entirely empty.

The appetizer that we ordered, the tapas platter, was a good appetizer to share with a small group such as ours. The Chilean Sea Bass and the jumbo ravioli were great dinner choices.

On the other hand, the chicken parmesan left something to be desired. The chicken was good, but the sauce was god-awful. It was way too sweet and acidic. It tasted like it came out of a 99 cent can. This dinner platter came with a side of spaghetti that was cold and stuck together drenched in the inedible sauce. This platter was also supposed to come with a salad that I had to remind the waiter to bring out.

My wife ordered the salmon burger and she expected something similar to a fillet of salmon on a burger. Instead she got what looked like a crab cake made of ground salmon. This in and of itself was not bad, but when she asked the waiter to box it up for someone else in our party to take for lunch tomorrow, he assured her that she would like it. He should just be doing what she asked not trying to coax her to eat something she didn't want to eat. Again, this was no fault of Grape Street -- aside from maybe not describing it in the menu better -- but they should not be trying to force something on someone who clearly didn't want it.

When we received the check a gratuity was already added despite any forewarning of such policy. Furthermore, it was not listed clearly on the check and our grandmother who was paying for the meal nearly missed it.

Overall, not a great experience at Grape Street, which is sad because we have had better experiences previously and thought that we wanted to come back. Not so sure about that now.",jnBBQOyN1apWBSsZkzFnCQ,2,0,2,sPrVu3tVdv2pl6_j10sybg

(Yet Another Strip Mall Gem)

3.65 stars.  Not quite a solid 4 but pretty darn close.

I like the deliberate decor.  Much more interesting than I expected in a strip mall.  Warm textures and soft lighting as well as exposed brick.

The service was predominantly very good.  There was a moment when one of my coworkers received his salad and was surprised that it had cheese.  He hadn't read the menu and it didn't occur to him that a house salad would come with blue cheese.  The waiter was a little put off that he didn't want the cheese on the salad but then returned it and brought out another salad minus cheese.

I had the penne ala vodka which came with asparagus, asiago, basil, prosciutto and a nice vodka sauce, portion size was good.

5102311,2013-11-05,5,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Reading through a lot of reviews - I've been surprised at how people have rated this place. 

This is the first place my boyfriend took me out on a date to and we've come here on a quarterly basis if not more for the last 2-3 years. 

People say it's too dark...they have lights at every table - it's supposed to be a more chill mood to eat in, and you can see the menus.

The only reason I did not give the place 5 stars is because of the service. We've always had good to great service here. I've never had horrendous service in all of the times that I've been here. The only problem I see is that they seem understaffed by 1-2 people. This place gets insanely busy on most evenings and especially on the weekends. The waiters seem to be a bit overwhelmed at times, but never rude. 

Another thing - people complain it's overpriced. First of all, they have half off wine on Mondays. That's a rarity. And think of all of the other places you drink wine or beer at. Everywhere is over priced for alcohol. They have to, in order to make money. This place does not do anything in the price difference compared to other $$ cost restaurants in town. 
With the food - come on, guys. It is not overpriced. It is a higher quality than you're going to find walking in any chain restaurant. If you want cheaper prices, go stroll down the street until you find yourself in an Applebees. They offer fresh fish. Not fried fish sticks. 

The top dishes I recommend - 

Anything with Halibut or seabass. Most of the times I come here, I get fish - and I'm not a fish lover. But they always have the best sauces that compliment the fish so well. 

The filet oscar - each time we've had it, it's cooked perfectly to our request, topped with crab and it's served with asparagus and mashed potatoes. It's very flavorful and very tender. 

The pork chops. I love them here. I'm always scared to get them at restaurants. They never seem to taste right and it's always with weird sauces. The pork chops here are thick, juicy and they have a great sweet wine sauce served on top. 

I love that they always have a good amount of specials on the board too.
I'm pretty sure there isn't anything here that I haven't enjoyed. I've had so much, but there is a reason why we keep going back. 
AND there is a reason why this place is always busy - IT'S GOOD AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY ABOVE AVERAGE FOR ABOVE AVERAGE FOOD. ;)

SERVICE: The hostess didn't even attempt to smile. Even a fake smile is better than no smile at all! While we waited at the hostess stand, she ignored our presence until she finished with whatever she was doing and then turned to us and gruffly said ""Hi. How many?"". Chick needs to turn that frown upside down!

The waitress was a bright spot on our visit. She was humorous and had my prosciutto-flecked sandwich remade without a word when I told her I was vegetarian. Totally my fault for not noticing the meat on the menu description but she took care of it stat! Thanks lovely waitress!  3.5/5 

Cheese & Charcuterie ($19): They were able to substitute the blue cheese that normally would have come with this plate for another type of cheese (provolone). Muchos gracias. The sliced apples and pears on the plate were crisp, fresh, and sweet. The bread was painfully plain and the honey dripped atop was undetectable. The crackers were dreadfully boring as well. The cheeses were just okay. I wouldn't recommend getting the cheese plate. The price just doesn't justify the quality of the items on the plate.  2/5

Mary Ann's Grilled Cheese ($12): Sandwiches are served with the side of the day. Why oh why can you not just give me fries?? Instead I got a side of macaroni salad with my sandwich. Pft. I learned from eating this sandwich that I'm not a fan of goat cheese. Best part of the sandwich was the basil. I only ate one-half. 2/5

Grilled Chicken & Emmenthaler Swiss ($12): My husband complained that there was way too much mayo in the sandwich. Overall, he said it was pretty mediocre. Neither of us cared for the ""side of the day"". 2/5

Ambiance: I have to admit, we were wowed by Grape Street's decor. Wine bottles lined the walls, lights were strung up here and there, and cute chalkboards displaying the latest specials were all complemented by dim lighting. CON: The metal framed chair and tables are heavy to move, squeaking loudly when you attempt to move them, and leave you kicking your fellow dining partner for leg room. 4/5   

Worth a return visit?
Unlikely, because my husband and I weren't satisfied with any of the items we ordered. 

Side Gripe: Grape Street has a Dinner Special section on the menu that includes a salad or soup with an entree. Not one vegetarian option is available. Fooey.

You don't really get much of an option. One appetizer, one entree and one dessert. The dinner RW menu is more interesting with the pulled pork and foie gras appetizer.

I love Grape Street's regular menu items but since lunch was free and it's for a good cause, I went ahead with the RW menu. This is my second year in a row to do so and I've been sick both times so my enjoyment of food wasn't the same.

Beet Salad:
Comes with Mint Pesto And Goat Cheese.  I'm not crazy over beets but ate a little bit of it because I don't have a choice. I ate more goat cheese than beets. 3/5

Sliders:
Beef tenderloin slider with Cabernet cause and fried onions and a dungeness crab slider. Both sliders were tasty and I like the fact there was somewhat of a variety on their very limited RW menu. 4/5

Upon walking in the restaurant was full of diners which is always a good sign.  The space was dimly lit and seemed quite romantic to me. We were promptly sat. The host and wait staff were accommodating but they needed to maybe smile a bit more. 
We were quickly offered water, which tasted like dishwater, but that's Las Vegas tap water for you. We ordered some well needed caffeinated sodas, as they brought us some complimentary fresh baked warm bread with butter, which was quite good. We decided to share a Caesar salad and a Barbecue Chicken Pizza. The salad was okay, nothing special, saturated with not house made dressing. The pizza had good flavor, but the crust was a bit soggy and had lots of raw flour still stuck to the bottom of the pizza. I had to stare at the list of desserts the whole time, so we had to get something. With a little help from the waiter we agreed on getting the Chocolate Cheese Mousse. A small dish of thick, chocolate mousse topped with light as air whipped cream. It was the best thing we got.
A bit miffed, they automatically added an 18% gratuity to the bill. We didn't complain because we would've tipped him that or more if given the chance. I figure it was because we used a Groupon.

For desert, a 6 layer chocolate cake that we cleaned off the plate.

It's so charming, and I love places that you can eat outside in Vegas. (Only in the fall or spring though!)

It seemed many people were on dates, and some seemed a little stuffy, but I won't judge... 

Since last night all I can think about is the new BEST THING I EVER ATE, Baked Brie. 
I love my cheese, and holy cow I love this. 2 thumbs up Grape Street! 

The tapas plate, and mussels were also awesome. For 4 drunks only ordering appatizers and a pizza we scored BIG TIME! 

Aside from the 2 bottles of wine we ordered the prices were also just right.

5802183,2014-08-24,15,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Please see my picture for the reason behind my dislike of this establishment. It shows an apple slice accompanying the Baked Brie with the sticker still on it and sliced through. 

Is it a big deal? Not for you in your own house, but in a restaurant such as this? Yes, it is a big deal. It reflects poorly on the overall mentality of this place and provides insight into the way they cut corners...
1. This apple was likely not washed
2. Those that prepare the food are lazy without attention to detail...how was this apple cut through a sticker much less plated without someone noticing and pulling it off??
3. If they cut corners here, they cut corners elsewhere

As a result, I was very critical regarding the rest of my meal, here are some additional findings:
- the Baked Brie was completely overcooked: the phyllo was an empty shell, what used to be solid brie was now mostly unconstituted liquid fat covering the plate
- the pear slices accompanying the Baked Brie were incredibly over-ripe and should not have been served
- I also ordered the Penne ala Vodka with chicken which came with pancetta and asparagus pieces in the pasta. I counted, in this dish there was only 1 piece of asparagus which was the tip of a spear, every other chunk was from the body with most being the very fibrous chunks from the bottom (which should not be utilized). I relived my meal on the way home as I tried to excavate asparagus fibers from between my molars.

Grape Street - if you're going to charge me $18 for a pasta dish (which is .35 cents worth of pasta + a few chunks of things and sauce), it better be top notch...it wasn't.

5818975,2013-04-21,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"We came to Grape Street Cafe about 6 years ago when we first moved here and last night was our first time back.  Must not have been terribly impressed the first time as it took this long to return.  I now know why.  Last night will be the very last time.  I called to see if reservations were accepted and was told only on parties of 6 or more.  No problem, as they said it wouldn't be a terribly long wait.  Apparently, the hostess does not know this as she informed us that there was a reservation for four on the books.  Must be for VIP's, perhaps. Not very professional as she is the first person you encounter on arrival. Told her we should have made the reservation for six and then ""cancelled"" two when arriving. She laughed and agreed!   That was the least of our worries at this point.  Sat at the bar and each had a glass of wine.  Bartender was ok.  Not exceptionally friendly. Were seated fairly quickly on the patio.  Nice table although the ambiance inside is better.  Paper menus were pretty tacky as well. Our server was less than professional.  Felt rushed the entire time.   Informed him that I had a few different offers to use (restaurant.com and Valpak).  Said he would figure out at the end which would be the most beneficial to us.  Realized, on the way home, that we did not receive either.  Had mussels for an appetizer and they were the worst we have ever had.  Obviously, we were not happy as we each ate one and left the rest.  Never asked, just took the plate away.  Had to tell him that they were awful and he said nothing.  3 out of the 4 dinners arrived and were told it was because he didn't have another ""hand"" for the 4th.  What???  So we figured it would come pretty quickly.  Not the case.  My husband waited approximately 10 minutes for his to arrive.  Ahi tuna, I might add.  Needed the least amount of time to prepare.  Our friends appetizer (caprese) was terrible as well.  She has better tomatoes from her garden.  Meals were just ok.  Was offered fresh pepper, but apparently, he gave us the amount he thought was appropriate as my friend had to ask if she could have a few more ""turns"".  We left disappointed and then angry when I realized we did not receive any of the discounts I brought with me.  I do, however, realize I take partial blame for not reminding him.  We also felt the staff was unprofessional and ,quite frankly, sloppy.  In appearance and attitude.  With so many wonderful restaurant  options to choose from in Las Vegas, I will not make the same mistake a third time.",tJe5EzGkPvfCNDFK5xerOg,1,0,1,0Y6dsyKwR_xsj2hD858Ngw
5837430,2011-10-08,1,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Grape Street is not for everyone. On this dining outing, as before, the place was very crowded and filled with the chatter of diners plus added music mixed by a DJ. You almost had to shout to be heard by your table-mates, and we were as far away from the speakers as one could be. 

Good service was lacking this time, but that largely depends on one's luck of the draw. Our server never announced any of the specials; fortunately I had checked the blackboard before he arrived to see what they were. When I asked for butter for the Italian bread, the equivalent of two pats arrived. Twice more I had to ask for additional butter, and each time only enough for two applications was brought to the table. And, vinegar and oil were never offered. Our first loaf of bread was cool and undistinguished, but the second was very hot and tasty. While the service was professional it was not very friendly or attentive. We waited at least 30 minutes between completing the salad course and the arrival of our entrees. And, when they did arrive, they were all barely lukewarm. The other 3 members of my party gutted it out but I complained and asked for my veal to be heated up. Why spend good money and not enjoy what you are eating if it only needs reheating? 

At first our waiter took issue with my claim that the food was almost cold, touching the bottom of the plate and noting that it was hot. I invited him to try the food itself, since the temperature of the plate was largely irrelevant. But he declined my offer, and took my plate away. Based on how long we waited for our entrees, I believe that it was largely this server's fault that our food was not hot, because the plates probably sat waiting to be picked up and delivered for an unreasonably long time. 

In 5 minutes our server returned with a smoking, quite hot new batch of Veal Parmesan. I was content! It was not necessary to give me new veal cutlets but that's what the restaurant did. I could tell the scallops of veal were new, because all 4 large patties were intact and the Parmesan Cheese that I had sprinkled over the tepid batch was now entirely absent. 

My final gripe on this occasion is that on trips to two different unisex restrooms, baskets in each were filled to the top with discarded paper towels. With the restaurant often filled to capacity, periodic policing of the restrooms is a must! 

Thus far this review sounds like it is heading into two- or one-star territory, and that I will vow to never return. But that is far from the case. Why? Because of the excellence of the very tasty food! Ahh, the food! 

18 steamed Little Neck Clams sauteed in a zesty white wine sauce were filled with flavor, and I spooned the sauce like soup. This was a great starter! The Chicken Noodle Soup that followed was clearly homemade, with large hand-cut morsels of chicken, al dente carrot slices, celery, and noodles swimming in an excellent chicken broth. 

A chopped salad with blue cheese crumbles, bright red tomatoes, chopped Iceberg Lettuce, and a thicker than usual Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing was surprisingly very good, since vinaigrette dressings rarely supply the flavor punch that this one did. Although Roasted Potatoes were slightly burnt on the outside, they were still tasty. And, once the food temperature was straightened out, the cheesy Veal Parmesan tasted very good. So did the Veal Marsala ordered by all others at my table, except accompanying long-stemmed carrots were hard and virtually uncooked. 

Because of the fine food served at Grape Street, and an earlier much better dining experience, I will return again. But I sincerely hope that my next venture will be more like my first visit than my second. If this restaurant wants my continuing business along with more friends in tow, I am putting its management on notice that it is now make it or break it time, and with me this establishment is currently on a short leash. For, with the profusion of other fine Italian restaurants cooking up delicious meals in Las Vegas, A-OK is just not good enough for regular frequenting.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,2,3,AUPAyDymFlgXQMbra3XCrg

Ambiance: 3.5 stars
I love the decor and feel of the place. It feels like you are eating at a winery. The only turn off is looking parking lot. If they closed the windows it would've kept the ""magic"" longer.  

Service: 3 stars
The service was decent but not spectacular. The server could not help me with making a wine selection for our appetizer. I am not expecting anyone on the waitstaff to be sommelier but at least know the basics. 


Food: 4 stars
The bake brie appetizer was phenomenal. I don't even like brie or pears for that matter but I couldn't stop eating this dish. As recommended by other reviews, this is a must have!

The pizza was ok.. It was honestly nothing out of this world. Good quality but nothing to wow about. One good point was the fresh grated Parmesan cheese that the wait staff grated onto your dish. A nice touch versus crumbles from a shaker. 


The eggplant Parmesan was nothing special either, If you are a GMO freak, you may want to stay away from this one because the eggplant was huge, like something out of a video game. 



One last thing:
Groupon beware they charged 18% gratuity automatically. I always tip generously, so it was like a slap on the face saying that because I'm using a Groupon that I'm cheap... Boo on you, you missed out on the extra 2% that would've given anyway.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,3,0,3,eAbTG43HD3olLljT79JbDg
5918579,2011-11-04,0,eJCDUkFa7wl-BHYKZzaTMQ,"Great wine menu for wine lovers and their 50% off wine selection promotions are on every Mondays.  Grape Street is a popular place to dine at without breaking the bank, unless you want to (even then it will be a challenge).  Pretty dark/dim lighting, ideal if you don't want to see your food before consuming it, even better if you must dine with someone you absolutely can't stand looking at.  Awesome hostess!

Well, I went on a Tuesday (1 day before the Groupon I purchased several months ago expires) and called ahead to see if I needed to make a reservation.  I was told they only take reservation for larger parties (I believe 6, maybe 8) but to come down since they were not busy.  So I took a quick nap, and ended up over there around 6:45pm, and the place was packed with people waiting in the non-existent lobby/waiting area near the hostess podium.

I was told the wait will be a 45 minutes, so I left my number and went to read in my car (it was way too cold to be seated outside or walking about checking out what other businesses are in the same plaza). The hostess must have some magical talents, because like magic or a clever charm, she shrunk the wait time to around 8 minutes and delivered the good news over the phone.  Sweet!!!    +1 star right there!

I was seated at a small table in a dimly lite part of the restaurant, which is not bad, but not great if you are a Yelper and photodocument your experience.  Luckily field testing the iPhone 4S in low light condition with ""flash"" was a reasonable success.

Service was pleasant, even at max capacity, albeit not as speedy as it might have been on nights when they are not so slammed with guests.  Which gave me plenty of time to read the menu and research for suggestions on Yelp.  (The baked brie was indeed a great community suggestion!)

So this is what I ended up ordering:

* Baked Brie in Puff Pastry Shell ($13) with chopped Hazelnut, Caramelized Onions and Apricot Preserve, served with Apple wedges and Grapes, and really big slices of french breads.  The baked brie itself was wonderful and nom nom nom goodness! It was large enough to share amongst four people, or even better having it all to yourself. The presentation however needs refinement (toasted bread slices way too thick, and a knife stabbed in the pastry is anything but refine).  4 stars for taste, 1.5 stars for presentation.  Recommended.

* Seafood Fradiavolo ($20) - clams, shrimp,calamari, scallops & mussels are blended in a spicy tomato sauce or a white garlic and oil sauce and served atop linguine.  I went with the white garlic sauce, which I was told was the more popular option.  Shrimp was overcooked, and the scallops was a 1/4"" thick slice, which are my only main non-positive reaction, to a pretty good tasty entree. 3 stars for the taste and presentation.  Recommended if you like seafood and pasta.

* Chicken Marsala Dinner ($22) - thinly pounded chicken sauteed in Marsala wine sauce, served with mushrooms, baby carrots and potatoes (Online menu said it is served with rice pilaf).  The chicken was absolutely tender and cooked perfectly!!!  The baby carrots and potatoes were likewise expertly executed in the kitchen.  However, I am not a fan of this version of the Marsala Wine Sauce, which I thought was too one-dimensionally sweet and generally lacking in complexity of flavors contributed by the use of herbs and seasoning.

All dinner comes with choice of small house salad or soup, and I opted for the salad.  It was decent, with the raspberry dressing (standard) or can be customized with your specified dressing.

Had room for dessert, but was saving room for the Sushi Mon10th Anniversary $10 AYCE promo the next day.  (Which ended up falling through, due to the overwhelming Occupy Sushi Mon Movement) 

Location:  Close to the 95 and Summerlin Parkway.

Parking:  4/5  Plentiful, but there are little to no shades in this parking lot to minimize the hot summer sun.

Service:  4.5/5
5 stars alone for the Hostess, as she was simply awesome!  I am sure she did her best to seat patrons as quickly as possible,and turned a 45 minute wait to just ~5-8 minutes on a busy night.  She follows up after themeal on the food your ordered and asks how it was, that alone is unheard of!!!  She deserves every penny the restaurant pays her and more.

4 stars for the waiter and the runner that brought out and cleared away my plates.  The only reason it is not 5 stars also, is the minor reason that all the main courses (I ordered two for myself) were delivered to the table at the same time.  I guess I will have to make a point to specify that in the future, as I am pretty sure they don't often have guests order that much food.

Food:  3/5 Above average.

Price:  4/5  Reasonable.

Overall, it was a good dining experience and I can see why it is a popular destination.  The waitstaff and the hostess were friendly and basically awesome, especially in consideration of how busy they were when I went.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,4,EwNkwG7ibKWdflXNepPAiw

I love the ambiance, low lighting, candles, decor is much older feeling, heavy metal chairs, wood tables, stone counter tops. . . kind of a picture perfect place. So you have two constants- good wine (half off or not) and a nice atmosphere for a date or a girls night, but something always seems to give with either service or quality of food. 

Last night our server was great, but food was disappointing, my entree- Eggplant Parmesan came out luke-warm and my girlfriend's salad was soaked in dressing.
