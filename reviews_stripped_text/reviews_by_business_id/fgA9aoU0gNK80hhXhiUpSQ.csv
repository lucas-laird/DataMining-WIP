With so-so food and tired un-caring staff.  However this time, I was totally impressed.  The atmosphere and décor were first rate, the waterfalls added a nice touch.  The cocktails were superb, I started off with the Salted Caramel Martini, my wife had the Angry Cucumber.  Our friends had the craft beers. We were stoked! Being from NY, for dinner I had the Prime New York Striploin with mojito fries and cream spinach. My wife had the salmon with refreshing Gremolata, green beans and mash potatoes.  All done to perfection!  For desert, we shared the sinfully delicious Hawthorn Soufle, yum!  Besides the great food, the wine list was certainly impressive. Our waiter Andre was witty, friendly and a total pro.  Possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of wine that I rarely see. Andre even gave us tips on buying / selecting wines when we go home. Making the overall experience memorable and fun. FYI the Spanish wines were outstanding.  Will definitely come back to your establishment.  Highly, highly recommend!

I can only say, ""Oh Carmel room where art thou?""  I realize that the Hawthorn grill is new but they should have taken clues from the Carmel room.  Their atmosphere was softer, not brightly lit and in general geared to a quiet, relaxed dinner contributing to relaxed, quiet conversation.  The hawthorn dinner menu is much more limited and although the presentation was good and the staff very knowledgeable, the preparation left much be desired.  My guest had scallops that were almost raw on the underside.  I had the lobster tail which was overdone and without the butter would have been quite dry.  The greens (I think they called it broccollini) was like chewing on slightly cooked sticks.  The service was quite slow.  The music was fairly loud and more 80's and 90's pop music instead of quiet dinner music.  Needless to say I would not be returning.",fjfPYjnmOqUn4qqUBFuBZA,3,0,1,iou6HhxidV89MdCGlLzDrQ

I wasn't clued in to the smoked salmon until day 3, but I made up for it.  No omelet station, but that's ok.  I ate the scrambled eggs every day and varied my other sides.  I also liked the toasted coconut offered to put in your oatmeal.  I never thought of that but now I am going to want it at home.  The pastries looked amazing.  I had the Nutella loaf thing and it was kinda crazy with whole hazelnuts.  I still haven't decided if I really loved it but I ate it.  An ok amount of fresh fruit.  Meat was either smoked bacon or sausage links, both of which were good.  It isn't really a memorable buffet (other than toasted coconut) but it did the job.

1645000,2017-01-27,0,fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ,"I would give it a 3.5, but in this case, leaning more towards a 3. 

Not too bad for a new restaurant. The decor is nice and their wine inventory in the glass display cases out front by the hostess stand looks really nice. 

The food could use some tweaking, but it is a new restaurant, so their menu isn't going to be perfect from the get-go. 

I went with some friends and I think we ordered enough food to make a good judgment of the menu overall. We ordered the braised short ribs, Maine lobster and sweet potato gnocchi, smoked and chili rubbed pork chop, branzino, Mac n cheese, cauliflower gratin, onion rings, mojito fries, brussels sprouts, and creamed spinach. 

Braised short ribs 3/5 - pretty good, but nothing special. The short ribs were tender and moist and fatty. The parsnip puree was okay. Very safe choice for an entree. 

Maine lobster and sweet potato gnocchi 4.5/5 - one of my favorites of the entrees we ordered. The sweet potato flavor came out in the gnocchi and the gnocchi were cooked well. The lobster was tender and flavorful. The spaghetti squash was sweet and a good combo with the rest of the dish. The shellfish butter was a good complement for the dish. I would definitely order again.

Kurobuta pork chop 4.5/5 - the pork chop was a generous portion and very well cooked. The smoky flavor worked well with the chili rub and made the pork chop very flavorful. I would order this again as well.

Branzino 3/5 - the branzino was flavorful, but there was not enough sauce on the side. Not even a half full ramekin of chimichurri. I wish I had more chimichurri since it was delicious. 

Cauliflower gratin 2/5 - Eh. It was forgettable. Could've used more salt, not very flavorful.

Mac n cheese 2.5/5 - not very cheesy, seemed clumpy and it was dry. Flavor was okay, it was not cheesy enough.

Brussels sprouts 3/5 - they had a nice flavor, bright from the lemon and chili. Well seasoned too.

Onion rings 3.75/5 - the onion rings were crispy, and flavorful. The house made black pepper ranch was delicious, I wanted to dip everything in it, and I did. 

Mojito fries 3.5/5 - the fries were thick, steak fries covered in garlic, cilantro, and citrus served with a poblano aioli. The fries were soft and crispy. They could've used a bit of salt, but overall they were good. (I dipped them in the black pepper ranch).

Creamed spinach 3/5 - could be creamier. I like the addition of the crispy onions on top, they added a nice contrasting texture. They were good, but I wish they were creamier. 

Overall, not a bad experience. I would definitely give them another try once their menu matures a bit. The service was fine and prompt (we were one of 3 or 4 tables in the dining room). Wine list was pretty big with a large variety of options.",MzIzsHa1kssFkviGufm-dw,9,5,3,Bg-LYtHG2dxV2gSaqguvKg
1715714,2017-07-24,0,fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ,"My review for this restaurant is based on a single visit (myself & one other person) & it was for breakfast. 

My partner & I had attended the Mufon symposium being held at the JW Marriott & have tried a few of the resort restaurants. 

The restaurant was very quiet when we arrived, though ours was a late breakfast so certainly not peak time. 

The layout of the restaurant is very nice & quite appealing. The reason for my three star review... Odd service & fairly mediocre food. 

My partner ordered the buffet breakfast & our waiter seemed confused in some way by it. When I say the service was odd, it's sort of hard to explain & I wondered if the guy was just new to the job & learning. How he conversed with us was strange & he seemed to maybe be unsure of exactly what he should do.  

My partner didn't mind the buffet, range of food & quality was OK. Eggs benedict is a breakfast favorite for me so I ordered this, though it's not something I have often at all. What was surprising was that the presentation of the dish was really nice but the meal itself was so bland & had almost no flavor. I can whip up an eggs benedict at home which is much better than what I had at this restaurant & I am certainly no great cook! Anyway I only ended up eating half as the entire meal was flavorless. 

My partner & I also had meals at the Spiedini Italian restaurant which was noticeably better & even the couple of cheap meals we had at the Promenade cafe were better. 

Anyway, to conclude I would say that some of the staff might need some additional training. We were only there for a single visit so I don't want to be unfairly reviewing based on that but it was one of the more odd/awkward server/waiter encounters I have had & overall the quality of the breakfast food was not great. Maybe some tweaking of ingredients & options might be worth noting.",elGZUsUL64P6F1IHH_qXeg,0,0,3,rwWrK4pt17cUKsDFSLCHIw

The oysters were tasty but very small for the price. The soup was different than other onion soups on the sweet side, but the bread and cheese put on top was so hard you had to cut it with a knife and was hard to chew. Next was a romaine salad that was just okay. We ordered the branzino for the entree which was tender, quite nice, while our friends had the filet and the short ribs which were excellent.

1936298,2017-03-18,0,fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ,"Took my parents to Hawthorn Grill for their anniversary.  We heard the bone in pork chop was their signature item so my Mom and I had that.  We requested for ""a little pink in the middle but not raw""  The pork chops came out very well done and it really dried up what would have other wise been a perfect pork chop.  You lose 1 star for this.  As a high end steak house you MUST get this right and there is no excuse for the meat not coming out as requested if you want 5 stars.  Ours wasn't even close to what we requested.  Mistakes happen but come one....get this right guys.  My Dad had the salmon and no complaints there, he loved it.  The sides were pretty small.  Most high end steak houses have large sides that can easily be shared between 2-3 people.  The mashed potato side was ridiculously small and what I would call a small single serving.  Brussel Sprouts were the other side and very good but again, bigger sides for what you are charging, $9 sides, so you lose 1/2 star for the skimpy sides.  It adds very little cost to make the side portions bigger so don't skimp here!!   They weren't very busy and the it took a long time for the food to arrive..., about 45 minutes after ordering.  1/4 star demerit for this.  Our waiter was very friendly and good service overall...no real complaints here other than we were charged $14 for 2 bottles of Evian Water when we never ordered a 2nd bottle.  Atmosphere was pretty good but Hawthorn Grill is tucked away into a remote corner and hard to locate but nice views out the windows of grounds and water features.  I feel I""m being generous giving Hawthorn 3 stars but don't feel they deserve 2 stars from me.

2181059,2018-01-26,0,fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ,"Hawthorn Grill is a new favorite. I go back regularly because of Kit, the bartender. He's quite the mixologist, and remembered my favorite cocktails at each visit. We've been several times for dinner, lunch on the patio, and twice for brunch. Service is usually good, but the whole brunch experience needs to be re-worked. There's so much potential, but the egg service misses the rest of the brunch buffet. I want my eggs with the rest of my meal.

We were there last Sunday for a birthday brunch. A large group of us wanted to sit in the bar to have brunch, watch football, and have Kits incredible cocktails. Poor Kit was trying to do everything himself, with not a bus boy in sight to bring us water or coffee. The shift manager was standing across the room watching from a distance. Not jumping in like a team player, and helping. Just watching. When I approached and asked if she could have someone bring us 3pots of coffee to leave on the tables, she managed to reluctantly assist. She didn't send bus boys to clear our plates, or anything. She wanted the bartender to make drinks for the entire restaurant, bar and our table of 15. Mind you, I had reserved this table more than 24 hours in advance and she didn't have a full restaurant. I believe that she could've gotten someone to assist. I later heard her reprimanding the bartender for not bringing us coffee. I didn't ask him for coffee. I'd asked HER for coffee. It seems to me that trying to sabotage one of your most talented team members is counterintuitive to the success of the restaurant. I will not subject Kit to that kind of aggravation. I found a great bartender, close to home, and I want to keep him there. I highly recommend giving Hawthorn Grill a try. The steaks are terrific, and patio dining in the warmer months is nice.

The one thing that I can say good about is probably the decor of the place. It got me excited about the service and the food I was about to have. Well, it turned out that service and the food were not what I expected AT ALL. For a ""steakhouse"", I had a higher expectation for this place. While everyone was nice and friendly, it actually service was extremely slow. By slow, I mean by you waiting at least 5-10 extra minutes than normal wait time for everything you asked for. Not to mention that my family and I waited 50 minutes for our food to come. Mind you, WE ALL ORDERED SALMON! I'm sorry but salmon does not take 45 minutes to make for 5 people. And we all got sick the next day! Anyways, I wouldn't waste your time on this mess of a place.",_2-ojm_XLJU0Mbvw8_9J6Q,1,0,2,wm2Dg4gAwJHuGAOl3BUb7w

Like many hotel garden restaurants, the Hawthorn (I guess their spelling isn't any better than their breakfasts) is a lovely space that lures you in, and then disappoints with slow service and mediocre food.  At least I'm calling the food mediocre.  My wife said that her Eggs Benedict were the worst she's ever had, so she would tell you that mediocre is a bit of a stretch.  

Hawthorn bills itself as a fine dining restaurant.  Other than the pretty room and the garden views through the windows all around, the only thing ""fine dining"" about it was the pricey menu.  It's hard to judge from breakfast alone.  Maybe at night the steaks are delicious.  I'm skeptical, but maybe.

Came here for Bfast last Thursday...hardly anyone in the restaurant, and yet the service was dismal. So many waiters and yet, our food took forever to get to the table. Had to ask for a carafe of coffee to three different servers and finally it came, after I had finished breakfast.  Our ""main"" server was super nice but slow as molasses. The upside, the food was fine. Nothing to write home about, but a slightly upscale bfast. My eggs were cooked according to specifications and my bacon was crispy, per my request.  My son ordered pancakes and they looked very tasty. So, I left a bit disappointed and a little miffed, but satisfied. 

Friday night was my nephews wedding rehearsal dinner, or Groom's dinner. It was a prefix menu, with options of kale salad or gem salad, filet mignon, salmon, diver scallops and maybe chicken? And then banana split, cheesecake or apple tart for dessert.  I obviously went for the filet mignon, gem salad and the cheesecake. Good choice, because WOW! The gem salad was ok, I tasted the kale and I preferred that one. The filet (10 oz of beautiful meat) was cooked and seasoned PERFECTLY. I mean, probably one of the best filet mignon's I've ever had. Crispy on the outside, and perfectly rare on the inside.  They knocked it out of the park on that meat. My moms salmon was delicious and my niece said the scallops were lovely. I ate every piece of that filet, and enjoyed every bite!  The dessert was also on another level. The banana split had pan fried banana and some fantastic nut brittle...maybe a little more high brow than the kids were expecting, but tasty nonetheless. The cheesecake was delicious, but the apple tart was EPIC! This restaurant had redeemed itself and THEN some. The wait staff was great and accommodating. The bill that my sister paid (half of), seemed pretty reasonable for such lux fare.  All had been forgiven & I would definitely come back.

I went in on a Thursday night with my friend and we sat at the bar so we could watch the games going on.  They have a bar menu which has a few items that the full fledged menu doesn't have so that was a tip that one of our buddies recommended to us to check that out since it's limited to the bar.

We shared a dozen oysters.  They ended up being kumamotos which is my favorite so I was pleasantly surprised.  I think the selection varies but I'm not sure.
I ordered a bunch of appetizers instead of having an entree.  I went with the lamb ribs and they came in a delicious glaze.
I also got the poke that come with a side of rice chips.  Be careful with the rice chips, the poke will tear right through it if you don't eat it fast enough or if you piled too much on it.  It's more fragile than a tortilla chip.

We also ordered the ice cream sundae.  There was a snafu with the system where the kitchen didn't deliver it to us at the bar and it ended up who knows where.

Down rated 1 star due to slight over price & few issues.

I see they lowered prices for Father's Day Brunch ?

Formerly Ceres Restaurant. 
Really nice atmosphere & comfortable.

Free Valet parking.
Hostess & seating on time was fantastic.

Strip Loin was not as juicy & tender as it should have been & probably would have been better if served medium rare rather than medium, which was little dry & slightly tough but still ok.

Better grade of Strip Loin or Prime Rib might be a better choice.

Braised Short Ribs were good but somewhat over marinated?

Salmon was good but not inviting to try.
Ditto for Turkey.

Missed Lamb Chops.

Crab claws & jumbo shrimps were great.
Sure miss King Crab legs like at Westin's or Cili's Brunch.

Lobster salad was ok & but as good as advertised. Maybe more lobster & less salad might help.

I love breakfast item at brunch.
Omelette station selections were lacking ingredients. Not gourmet, but good.
Sausage & Bacon was in kids section.

Big, Wide selection of Deserts were fantastic! 
See pics.

Table service was poor considering it was not overly crowded.

We ran out of drinks & dishes piled up on our table until we bussed them ourselves to an empty table.

Would I return next year? 
Yes, I would give it another try because it appears  they must have assessed how to improve their Brunch as shown by slight lowering of prices for Father's Day Brunch.

Maybe they will see some comments & improve the upcoming Father's Day Brunch.",7ks5gnxM_o4XEJK4j6QnoQ,0,0,4,HLw6JbBB6VZeyePkJi8EXQ

Dirty martini with blue cheese olives was good, once they came out.  Poor management, let them run out of martini glasses at 7:30 on a Friday night. I think the managers name was Brad, or Benjamin. 

Service, overall is okay. Kitchen is lazy.  I had the craving for a poached egg on a steak.  After putting in the order the waiter came back after 15 min and said told the kitchen couldn't do a poached egg but could do a fried egg.  When I asked does the kitchen not have a pot, water to boil an egg and a slotted spoon?  I was told the kitchen is prepared for that...aka LAZY.  

Overall service was a bit slow, albeit okay.  Steak was rare not medium rare, I didn't dare send it back after asking for something off menu.  Mojito fries were good.  Potato was fried perfectly, but missed on the seasonings.  It was kind of like eating really good fries with chunks if garlic, whole Chinese peppers and then stalks of cilantro.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I read that this was the old Ceres restaurant remodeled.  Ceres was a place we liked to bring family and friends when they visited because of the lovely room and the fantastic patio.  The makeover does not disappoint except the partitions take away the view of the waterfalls in the landscaping unless you get a table by one of the windows.

We were seated promptly and brought water and iced tea.  Before we ordered, a server arrived with two 'blocks' of bread--one multi-grain and one plain--and there was a knife for cutting the squares out.  You could pull it apart also.

Two of us ordered the sweet potato gnocchi with lobster and one got the petit filet.  The gnocchi/lobster duo with the spaghetti squash was a creative dish and shellfish butter helped bring the items together.  They were not skimpy with the lobster.  My friend's filet was cooked properly and he said it was good.  He had a baked potato but the two of us with the gnocchi skipped a side dish saving room for dessert.

For dessert, I had the citrus lemon meringue tart with raspberry coulis and raspberry white chocolate ice cream.  My friend ordered the caramel mascarpone cheesecake that she shared with her husband.  We both were very pleased with our desserts.  The lemon meringue tart was excellent.

Service was very good.  Iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass and we were checked on during dinner to make sure all was going well.

It was a pleasant time having good food with good friends.  I need to return and try some other things on the menu and maybe eat on the patio when it's cooler.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,17,15,4,lccMDu0XUP_HlES4a87zIA

The minute you walk in you can't help but notice the the classy chandeliers and glass section dividers between each tables. The dark brown leather booth in each corner allows for plenty of privacy for you to enjoy a more intimate dinner with your friends. The dim lighting and low volume allows for a romantic vibe instantly. You just feel really high class when you're in this restaurant. I love it! I can't recommend it any more.  

Food: The 24 ounce rib eye steak with truffle butter on top was amazing! It was cooked to perfection at medium rare. The truffle butter gave your typical steak a little extra kick. The entree you MUST order is the scallop dish. The scallops are HUGE and full of flavor with a buttery cream glaze and spinach/ sweet potato chips as a side! Biggest scallops I've ever seen in my life. There's 4 pieces and it's worth every bite. I wanted more! The lobster gnocchi was not my favorite but then again, I'm not a big gnocchi lover. My vegetarian friend really enjoyed it though. I thought the gnocchi with spaghetti squash was an interesting mix?! I don't know if I loved it. The mac and cheese was definitely worth mentioning. We all really enjoyed it with the Ritz crackers later on top. You can definitely pass on the brusell sprouts- it's overly salted with too much balsomatic vinaigrette. If you have room for dessert, you must try the churro smores! Omg! It was soooo good! The presentation alone is ordering. The smores come out soft and oozy and when you dip churro into it, you can literally taste a bit of sugar heaven. Trust me, you won't regret it!! 

Service: Service was impeccable! Our waitress, Alexandra, was so attentive and sweet. She catered to our every need at all times. She constantly made jokes with us about how young we looked and how much food we were ordering considering it was just us 3 girls. Our bus boys cleaned the tables immediately and provided fresh plates as we were finishing up our appetizers. Their undivided attention to us made our dining experience so much better! One of the bus girls (young brunette- I didn't caught her name)  was soo nice! We asked for a photo and not only did she stop what we was doing to take our photo but she also moved the dishes to make it presentable for the photos. She took multiple photos and even posed us for better lighting! You really can't beat that kind of service! 

Price: Very decent pricing for the experience you're paying for. The service, food and ambiance makes the price well worth it. I don't think it was over priced by any means. 

Overall, you should really try this place!! It's tucked inside the Rampart Casino. We went there after our massage at the Spa Aquae and it was a perfect girls night of food and relaxation!",21Yw7sljz0JqGNytZYXKCw,0,0,5,Ckk0w6JzFfFsP4UdAn115Q

I have not been here for breakfast, lunch, or brunch but I can't wait to come back and give those menus a try!  If you are near the JW Marriott give this place a try; I doubt you will be disappointed.

Positives
1) Service is nothing short of World Class!  This place takes service to a different level and on our second visit here the waiter remembered our names and even what meal we had on our first visit and what wine we had chosen!  You cannot beat excellent service and it is one of the reasons I will continue to patronize this restaurant.  The manager even came to our table to greet us and welcome us back.
2) Dinner Menu is simple but diverse enough to satisfy any appetite.  I recommend the calamari, crab cake, and crispy pork belly appetizers.  I also tried the Mojito fries as an appetizer and they are delicious.  I recommend the BLT Wedge salad and onion soup.  You can get a variety of steak, seafood, pork chops, as well as pasta short ribs, and chicken.  I recommend the Filet, New York Strip, scallops, and Atlantic salmon.  For sides the broccoli, creamed spinach, and Mac & cheese are fabulous.
3) Wine, Beer, & Cocktail Menu is incredible.  They have draft beer (Lagunitas IPA is my favorite), bottled beer, and a long list of Signature Cocktails including a Salted Caramel Martini.  The wine list is 5 pages long and has every varietal you could want.  Either by the glass or bottle, the prices are also fairly reasonable considering the normal high markup.
4) Valet Parking is complimentary, the restaurant is by the Spa tower of the hotel so plan to enter the property by the hotel entrance rather than the casino entrance as that will put you on the other side of the property and force you to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,1,0,5,FQ-p8n39Rgr7v96gzlblBA

Received our starters at 7:30 and finally left without getting our entrees at 8:35 pm. We watched numerous people come and go while were were still waiting. The manager passed our table on several occasions and was impossible to flag down. He did not stop by to say hello or ask how we were doing. I finally snagged a sweet girl that worked behind the bar to go into the kitchen and retrieve our bill from our server. It's a shame, as the food we did receive was delicious. I was looking forward to tasting the rest!  Pretty sure our cocktail bill would have been at least triple what it was...had someone paid any attention to our empty glasses. We will not be headed back any time soon.",1-ZNocsN6y5FVMQIE7f7oQ,1,1,1,NyePtEEX02rA2URo587bdA
4343577,2017-11-11,0,fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ,"This review is in honor of three women who make the Hawthorn Grill bar room area a huge success. My hats off to Francis, Melissa and Amber. They work the Happy Hour like real Professionals. The bar area is always hopping during 4-6 pm, especially on a Friday night. 
They prance  around bubbly and happy and their service shows it! 
If you are wondering why this is not a 5 star rating it is due to the neglect of Cecil, the General Manager of the restaurant. I wanted to commend the servers, but she chose to ignore me as she passed by without even a glance my way. Clearly, she was more interested in embracing a floor manager who seems to think he is a game show host. 
In this particular situation the service in the Hawthorn Grill does not filter from the top and Cecil could take a few lessons from Amber, Francis and Melissa about attention to patrons and customer service.",KXqaoBNfPHsPXEGVk_v1qQ,0,0,4,GwLr5tJIa3SyP5sG8IpqsQ

Very slow and the weren't all that busy.  Waiter said the kitchen was slow that night.  he was kind enough to bring us a piece of fabulous chocolate cake to make up for the slow service  i guess.

4771327,2017-03-23,0,fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ,"Bad experince. After being seated it was coming up on 8 minutes and no one had come to our table. We were just about to track down a server to find out who OUR server was when a female server came over to ask if anyone has been to our table. AMAZING! There was confusion as to who our server was. Finally 10 minutes after being seated a server came over. The lousy service didn't end there.... After placing our drink order and ever after they arrived, no one brought over bread and water to our table. Even after asking our server for bread, we had to ask a second time to one of the runners. 

What really upset our party was the fact that we saw another large group sat AFTER us and received their food BEFORE our party did! 
 
Once the food finally came out it still did not make up for the lousy service and attitude of the staff. We never saw our server again until the check arrived. Overall everyone in our party had a bad experience. Under any other circumstance I would have just left after no one came to our table in the first place. WOW! With so many other options within 2 miles we were shocked at the level of service. I would not recommend this restaurant.",CLhwqxLbc4GsNLDUC0gaww,2,0,1,o_M2ROvFEbn3ifYhwTn8Kg

Beautiful Restaurant.

Food Was Ok.

Service was friendly.

Menu Selection was limited and just Ok.

Our waitress Camille was nice and extremely efficient. 

The bread served pre-meal wasn't presented/explained so I was unsure if something was wrong with it prior to eating it. I did ask, and was told it was half sweet. Ahhh!  Well I can report It was just ok for me.

The Brussels Sprouts were perfectly cooked. The balance of the special sauce and chili left   me wanting more!  

Filet Mignon was delicious. Again perfectly cooked!! 

The chef here has a true talent!! 5 stars for the chef!

Manager made his presence known and stopped by our table to introduce himself and ask if we were enjoying our meal.  Excellent touch. Showing some interest in his guests. 
Our happiness/ satisfaction with our meal seemed to be his focus. We appreciated that.

The restaurant is exclusive and beautifully decorated for a intimate dinner or a professional setting. 

We will be back for sure. I definitely recommend giving Hawthorn Grill.

Note- If you are visiting the Marriott hotel or The Rampart Casino access is easy and a clear choice. Enjoy~",kl_yCsj4ESbUphmpCfVvRA,61,57,4,LhXd8lOrARaBBreqisro3w
4986342,2018-01-30,0,fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ,"Was so looking forward to having lunch at the Hawthorne Grill with a woman's club I belong to.  I have eaten at most of the restaurants in the Marriott, and most were very good.  

The menu at Hawthorne was adequate for lunch, with a lot of standard things.  However, I saw the roasted mushroom grilled cheese with chips, and it sounded so interesting, I ordered it.  The sandwich came with two pieces of toasted 1"" thick french bread, and in the middle was a little bit of what must have been pureed mushrooms (it was brown) a small piece of cheese in the middle (supposedly havarti) and a sprig of something green, all completely tasteless.  Around the whole inside edge of the sandwich was completely dry, no filling at all, and no indication on the outside that it had been grilled, just toasted.  Crust was so hard as to be almost impossible to bite.  Needless to say, after the cutesy name, I was incredibly disappointed.  The ""chips"" were made from large idaho potatoes thinly sliced lengthwise and fried.  They were OK but I would take McDonald's any day.  We arrived at 11:30, and it was after 2 by the time we were all served and checks received.  Our waitress was WAY out of her element with that group.  Good thing an 18% tip was included or I am sure she would have been very disappointed.  All in all, I think it will be a long time before I return to the Hawthorne Grill.",4lzk5ZWUNlDJpMgvxS4yBQ,0,0,1,PzA0RXG-JLAyDoLLNpkVeQ
5144641,2018-04-03,1,fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ,"I made the mistake of coming here while it was Easter. Pretty easy when I brunch every week. The place was busy and they didn't have a huge selection of food, but the desserts... an entire room. And as it was busy, you know what happened. My glass was empty. For those that follow me, that's a huge pet peeve of mine. I'm fact, I asked a buser for a couple, waited 10-minutes, I flagged the server, and finally got one 5-minutes later. Fortunately, I was able to serve myself some of my friend's tea.

The salad bar had two salads to choose from, many cold cuts, cheeses and a handful of pantry sides. An omelet station.

The carving station was the failure. Lamb chop and sirloin roasted cooked to medium for serving. And only one. I asked the chef and he confirmed all beef roasts are cooked to medium. This resulted in the sirloin drawing moisture as you tried eating it. Any way, the line was huge, so I helped myself to the entree section. Only had potatoes, asparagus, braised short ribs (delicious) and salmon.

The setting was beautiful. One even has the option of singing al fresco. Overall it was a decent experience... until I saw what they charged. In comparison, Verandah does a far more superior job and has a much better value.",DNudacpzb0iRmV8XeI4Zmg,1,0,3,dk6JNkSJYYY-hS3lpS7HKQ

5356579,2017-07-15,1,fgA9aoU0gNK80hhXhiUpSQ,"We like to try out happy hours before having dinner at a restaurant and though we'd been to the lovely Ceres in the past, we were thrilled with Hawthorn Grill in its place.  In fact, we were ""wowed!""  Light shines through to the outside everywhere & the patio looks beautiful next to a water feature.  The bar is a perfect one & though I'm not one to sit down at the bar for an evening, I can picture myself watching a game while on one of those comfortable chairs.  It's rather where community takes place.  In the other part of the bar are comfy sofas, cocktail tables & a long table to seat larger groups.  A tour of this restaurant told me I just have to return for brunch or dinner.

A maitre d' greeted us & we chose a high table near the patio doors.  A darling server arrived quickly & knew the menu well, incl. the Sunday brunch I asked about.  We chose the now ""famous"" Hawthorn burger w/aged cheddar on a brioche bun which came w/gargantuan fries ($7.50), and the short rib flatbread ($7.00).  I had a Stella Artois  ($3.50) & my partner (a/k/a designated driver) his usual water.  The burger was huge & attractive, with all the trimmings gushing out, & if I wasn't giving up my status as ""buffet queen"", I'd have had one of these gems.  The flatbread was slathered in Gruyere which dominated it & felt like an artery-buster.  I'd forego it next time because these are the other H.H. choices:  shrimp cocktail $9, mojito fries $4.50, spinach/artichoke dip w/pita chips $6.50, sriracha wings $6.00 & garden flatbread w/broccolini, mushrooms, tomato, pesto & goat cheese. $6.00.  

A duo was playing in the corner near the sofas & the music was just right & not too loud.  If I could change anything, it'd be bringing those two musicians closer to the bar's patio so even those outside could hear them.  And I'd add a few ""healthy"" options to the H.H. menu.  It seems every place in town with a H.H. serves flatbreads & dips.  [I have 400 cookbooks with probably 5,000 recipes for appetizers, so...?]

Anyway, Hawthorn Grill has (thus far) made our list of favorites.",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,1,0,4,iltIiw01i4HsGekr-D8Q9Q

Bread stale as a board AND burnt.. short rib dry. Mohito fries. Why it's called that? Don't know. It was just thick cut potato with some cilantro thrown on top. When I picked one up it was so greasy it LITERALLY dripped. It was dripping with grease. The bottom of the dish was a layer of oil that just poured off the fries. The avocado toast. Thin cut store bought bread with avocado and jalapeños. If you're going to do avo toast at a high end restaurant the bread at least need to be a stand out. It was thin and semi hard, hardly holding up to the avo. The chicken confit hash was bland and that chicken was NOT confit. Confit is a method that is very precise and takes weeks to make. That was literally roasted chicken. You can't just call roasted chicken something it isn't.",nny2I0oKEtUzS24gyk02xw,0,0,1,Q-vxZzezhNBBU5BDoUpu7Q
