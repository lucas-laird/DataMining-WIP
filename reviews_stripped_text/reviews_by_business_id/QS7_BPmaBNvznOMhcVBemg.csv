3400216,2016-12-13,2,QS7_BPmaBNvznOMhcVBemg,"Came here for lunch because Babygirl , like all millennials, has an inexplicable liking for sushi. As a far more sensible baby boomer, I do not. (I believe we may have inherited a suspicion of Japanese cuisine from our fathers who served in the Pacific in WWII and considered it all ""fish heads"", but that is neither here nor there). 

We came once before when it first opened , meaning when they ""remodeled"" the old Benihana lounge by throwing in some tables and hanging red lanterns from the ceiling. The space definitely has an awkward feel, but not enough to ruin your meal. The fact that the menu used to have two sides so you could order Chinese or sushi from the place 10 feet down the little stairs but now you can't anymore definitely threw a wrench in things. Since Babygirl was willing to cave and I was not, we stayed.

We had a friend with us, so we ordered a few things to share. None were memorable, all were overcooked and mushy, and portion sizes were approximately half of what most neighborhood Chinese places give you. I understand that in a hotel, most customers are not going to keep leftovers anyway, but it rubs salt in the wound that they made in your wallet by charging two or three times the average price.

Although I love that the decor inside was incredibly intricate and unique, even with man-made rain and a japanese-style lake scene, it doesn't make up for a shotty vegetarian main dish.

Well, that's not fair. I've had worse. And it's not that it was bad, but it was just not good. 

I ordered the vegetable clay pot. It was meant to come with tofu - but I swear there was like 1 part tofu to 30 parts veggies. I love my veggies, sure, and the spices they used were pretty okay. However, the protein tends to be the focal point of most dishes, including vegetarian. The only exception I know to this rule is when spices are used in a generous and skillful way on another ingredient. Needless to say, I was missing my tofu as the flavor here was not anything too special.

The service wasn't bad, but it was also not able to make up for the food I was fairly disappointed with.

3970112,2018-06-03,6,QS7_BPmaBNvznOMhcVBemg,"Before going to a show at the Westgate, I looked on Yelp for a restaurant there to try that I had not been to and I chose Silk Road.  The restaurant is part of the Benihana Village with Benihana, Silk Road, and Rikki Tiki Sushi all in the same ""village"" with Silk Road being at the entrance.

I was seated quickly.  It was early and it was a Stanley Cup game at the same hour so there was only one other table occupied.  My server was Andy and he was very good.

I looked over the menu and I didn't see the duck that is in one of the Yelp photos.  I guess the menu has changed.  I ordered something completely different for me--fried rice.  I think this may have been the first time I've ordered it as my only other fried rice has been a side with some Asian food.  The Fuking fried rice is egg fried rice with asparagus, peas, BBQ pork, shrimp, chicken, and brown gravy.  It was good and so different than the dry kind of fried rice side you normally get.  The dish was moist with the brown gravy and it had a good amount of shrimp, chicken, and pork.

For dessert, they have two kinds of sorbet--mango and coconut.  I asked Andy if he had a preference and he suggested coconut.  It was perfect.  The sorbet is cut in the shape of a pie wedge and it is for people who like coconut like I do.

The decor of Silk Road is red--red lanterns, red lights on the steps going into the restaurant, red place mats, and red lighting.

4149839,2017-02-11,0,QS7_BPmaBNvznOMhcVBemg,"While staying at Westgate for several days for a convention, one evening a friend and I elected to enjoy Silk Road Asian Bistro for dinner. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is fabulous! Silk Road shares an area with Benihana and a sushi restaurant as well. Each of their areas are defined, but it's all in a fairly common area. Just the vision of the restaurant from outside is enough to tantalize one into entering to experience a meal.

My friend and I were fairly early for dinner that evening, so were promptly seated at a lovely table overlooking the lovely waterway below. Our very accommodating and friendly waiter promptly greeted us and brought us our requested beverages. After giving us time to make our choices from the menu, he took our order. I had chosen the shrimp tempura appetizer and my friend had chosen a noodle soup with pork belly. We had both chosen to split an almond chicken meal with steamed rice.

The tempura shrimp which was accompanied by vegetables - asparagus, sweet potato, zucchini and mushroom was delightful. I can't recall if there were three or four shrimp, but they were wonderful.

My friend was delighted with her soup. I took a taste of it, but it just wasn't ""my cup of tea"" (pardon the pun). There was really nothing wrong with it, but it just wasn't in my realm of favorite flavors.

The almond chicken was WONDERFUL! We both totally enjoyed it and agreed that the flavor was excellent.

Our waiter was extremely attentive and friendly. The service was a total 5 stars!

So, you ask why I didn't rate Silk Road five start? It earned four stars because all of the food came at one time, which created an issue where it was impossible to proceed through the appetizer or the almond chicken without them becoming cold before the dinner was complete. It would have earned 3 stars, but the waiter and the flavor of the food brought it up to 4.

Silk Road, thank you for a good dining experience, please educate your chefs on the timing of sending food out to your patrons - it will definitely help your reviews.",c40KGmkZV0ZB9ameLOkDwQ,0,0,4,nRnv3zaEo2kMxcXGeTPFJQ

We were hungry for sushi, and hanging on the wall next to the entrance to Silk Road, there's a full sushi menu.  Perfect!

We went to the hostess station and stood there waiting and talking for a few minutes before someone finally stopped by to ask if we wanted to be seated, and then waited a few more minutes before being seated (there was no line and we could see a number of open tables inside the place, not sure why the wait?).

We were seated, our drink orders were taken and we were given menus.  One problem: no sushi?!  My buddy went back out to check and sure enough, there was a sushi menu at the entrance.  When our server returned with our drinks we asked if they had a sushi menu, and she said no, that was a separate restaurant within this same general space that contains this noodle bar, a Benihana and a sushi place. OK? We'd already ordered drinks and were able to find a few dishes we liked on Silk Road's menu so we decided to stay.

We ordered an app and I ordered a wagyu beef dish for my main course.  While the food was good, I must say that the service was absolutely dreadful all night. It took forever for our server to take our food orders, our appetizer was delivered at the same time as our main courses, when we wanted a second round of beverages we had to wait for a few minutes before we could flag down our server, then several minutes later we had to ask someone else to get our dinks as it was obvious that our server had forgotten about us.  When it was time to get our bill and pay, again, it took forever.
