78253,2014-02-28,0,-FNquqGseSCVMWo7KbK-Tg,"I am a huge fan of the Chipotle brand and food. This negative review is for the service I received this afternoon at this location.

Earliest pickup time available when we submitted our online order was 1:15pm. We arrived 15 minutes early, was told that our order was not ready and would be about 10 minutes. We tried to pay when there wasn't a line of customers and were told that we could not pay until our order was fulfilled. The girl in charge of the pickup orders came out and told us it would be another 10 minutes. She came out with our order at 1:15pm on the dot, and told us in an exasperated tone to call next time if we would be arriving early. Her attitude was terrible, as if we were a HUGE inconvenience and had rushed her (which, obviously, we hadn't since our order came out right on time...). A simple, ""Sorry for the wait, I was backed up on other orders and couldn't get this out earlier for you"" would've sufficed. 

What's even BETTER is that when we mentioned pick-up-girl's attitude, the manager followed up with the same answer, ""next time call ahead if you'll be arriving early"" without so much as a hint of apology. Clearly WE were in the wrong here. It was definitely a missed opportunity on the manager's part to turn the situation around and save our experience from being so disappointing. Coming from a background in retail and fast food, I was baffled by their self-righteous, unapologetic attitudes.

I also didn't understand why 1. the manager was working in the fulfillment line the whole time and 2. there were periods of time when there were no customers to help - whey didn't someone (like, ahem, the manager) go and help the girl filling pickup orders?

I've never had a bad experience at Chipotle before today, and will definitely never come back to this location.",D1y2N4GekReGtJUyHfBy1Q,1,0,1,TjW8pYOEfKi5egym6Q1m7g

That's okay, i forgive you. Deep down, I know you were just being a good friend. Feeding me burritos big enough to feed me twice..or split with another friend.

On February 26, 2017 I placed three orders (for myself and two co-workers). The orders were accurate as usual. However there was a hair in one of the chicken bowls. I immediately phoned chipotle and let the manager on duty Eric know that I could not take my order and get a replacement as I only get 30 minutes for lunch so I'd have no choice other than to discard all three meals (as we all felt disgust afterward). Eric then told me that he would replace the entire order. I gave him my name and number and he told me that when I was ready to replace order just call and they take care of it. Fast forward to today and the manager on duty Romero refused to honor what had been previously told to me. I find it very discouraging that I have to write a negative review as I am always highly satisfied with chipotle and their customer service. However today customer service has been proven to be very mediocre.

I enjoy this place and the funny thing is I had never been here until this past spring and I have been going to school for three years now. I was the one people starred at when talking about Chipotle and I pipe in that I have never been. Silence had fallen every time. 

However, now that I know what it is all about, I am a fan! I try to go all the time when I can! I enjoy their tacos. Their rice has the perfect lime bite to it, the black beans are delicious and the cheese just melts into the chicken which makes it all the more tasty! Their tortilla chips are awesome too. Some of them have a little more lime on them then others, so when you bite into it, your face puckers up for just a second, but still pretty darn yummy. I love the fact that the lettuce is always fresh too. Never a brown dry spot on it! 

The serving sizes are massive and I think it is cool that they list the calories in everything on their menu for those who care. Depending on what you get, I feel that this is healthy fast food. The lines get long because of how popular they are, but they tend to have a process that makes it go pretty fast.

Not tonight.

Tonight there was a nice family of four in front of me in line.  One of the gentleman was on crutches.  Immediately after he placed his order, but not before his burrito was complete a girl who I presume is role-playing as the ""manager"" walked over to the line and ordered food for an employee, herself, and one of her friends.  

I was told to ""hold on"" even though it was my turn to order, and the family of four--including the man on crutches--was left standing there while the line was tied up making the ""manager's"" food.  

I didn't see the manager or anyone else pay for her order. 

This situation is completely UNACCEPTABLE!  How is it possible that the customers who buy the food and keep the business running were forced to wait while the ""manager"" and her friends eat first!?!?

In what bizarro world is this scenario possible?

The other workers in the front were seemingly inexperienced. The girl who poured the rice gave me a really thin layer or rice, and the next girl slapped on a pound of sour cream.

But maybe that's too much to ask. After all, I'm just a paying customer providing your jobs, that's all :)

The tall blonde guy on the line gave me a thumbnail of rice (I should have taken a picture of the portion) and got an attitude when I asked him to put my salsa on side (oh the agony of lifting your arm and reaching for the sample cup! I really feel for you bud!). Once I added the ice cold salsa to my plate accompanied by the ice cold tomatoes, I was basically eating a bowl of ice.

The last two times I have been here, they have completely skimped on my tacos or really messed up our order. And here's the best part: we're doing online ordering. With explicit instructions. How do you mess that up?? 

The customer service also stinks. My husband went to pick up food right before I got off work. We get home and I'm handing him his burrito and it's ICE COLD. Like it was sitting in a freezer. There is no way our car was cold, it was a warm day out and he put it in the backseat so the dog wouldn't get to it. When he bit into it, it was freezing. How the heck can that happen? My tacos were also ridiculously tiny - they were filled halfway if that. They also added guacamole which I loathe. I remember when I've gone there and the tacos are so big that I could barely eat two. Now I can eat all 3 and be hungry an hour later. NOT COOL! 

So my husband is so upset that he goes back to Chipotle. A second time. What happens? They try to make an excuse that they made the burrito right in front of him and it couldn't possibly be that cold, and all they do is remake the order. And my second tacos are just as tiny as the first. When you can grasp the top of the taco and have an entire inch on both sides, you have a problem. His burrito was HUGE - my veggie tacos were tiny. We're paying the same price, so why am I getting less? 

I am so fed up with this place that I honestly can't come here anymore. We used to come here about every two weeks but it's annoying to have to keep going back to do things semi-correctly, and still be disappointed on now multiple occasions. It's a VEGAN TACO. I am the cheapest customer you have! I shouldn't have to glare and ask you to give me more of every single ingredient to get one decent taco. Maybe it's just this location, because I do still like the franchise and the food, but only when it's made correctly and has good customer service to back it up if something does go wrong.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,3,1,1,2XkLR0AZqOBp0mAJjUoWrA

But, you want to know what makes it better than Subway? Their meat isn't prepackaged and salty and full of chemicals. 

At Chipotle, while you're ordering, you can see the cooks actually grilling the meat! If that doesn't make you want to chose Chipotle over Taco Bell....I don't know what to tell you. 

Chipotle is my go-to place when I want a quick bite. I think about the days where I'm going to be rushing and plan my Chipotle visits - thats how much I love this place.


I order the same thing every time: a burrito bowl with brown rice, half black and half pinto beans, peppers & onions, half chicken/half steak, mild salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and lettuce. When I'm not feeling ""naughty,"" I only request a little bit of rice and I cut out the steak, sour cream and cheese. 

I also cannot resist ordering chips and salsa. Their chips are delicious because they're salted with a slight lime flavor. Best chips in town. [I'm not sure that I'm qualified to make that assertion because I don't really eat a ton of Mexican food or have much experience with other chips ;)]

Sometimes, I also get a Corona (or two...) with my meal. They serve alcohol here! SCORE!

The first thing I noticed when walking in was booze. Wow. Chipotle with a liquor license? Only in Las Vegas! As tempted as I was, I still had to drive, so I decided against it...but maybe next time.  What can be better than an imported beer with your Chipotle? Oh, the thought makes me want to head back... anyways... I got the normal: Chicken bowl with fajitas, all the salsas, extra rice, lots of lettuce. 

The chicken was GREAT - cooked just right so it wasn't too chewy/hard.  Basically, it was the quality I have expected and enjoyed from Chipotle.  I must note that the mild salsa had a bit more kick in it than usual. ;] Non-spicy goers beware!

Then by miracle one day, a coupon for a FREE burrito of your choice from Chipotle hit my apartment mailbox.  No joke!  I guess it was because my apartment was close to UNLV and they wanted folks to come check it out.  I kid you NOT...I was searching in our mailroom trash can for extra coupons.  I found like a half a dozen of em!  For 6 bucks a burrito I was definitely saving me some moolah.  I even took my gf out for lunch one day using these coupons (heh heh).  I was a dirt poor college student, not cheap!

Anyway, I finally get to go to this place.  I was a bit weirded out because the line was out the door.  I was like, ""What's going on?"".  Come to find out that you stand in a line to 'craft' your own burrito, and you can see what goes into it.  It was a cool concept, although a bit strange at first because I was expecting a few cashiers like Taco Bell.  The decor was nice, more modern, lots of steel, fewer colors and more monochromatic.  

I get to the front of the line and it's my turn.  It's like creative freedom kindgomness (if that's a word).  First I get to choose if I want a burrito, soft or hard tacos, or a burrito bol (burrito with no tortilla).  Then I get to choose my meat or veggies, rice and beans, then my goodies on top.  I go for a burrito with grilled chicken, cilantro-lime rice, black beans, pico di gallo, tomatillo salsa, and extra romaine lettuce.  This sucker came out HUGE.  The lady could barely close it and wrap it in foil.  I was so happy I could barely contain myself!  Big food for big boy!  It was seriously over a pound for this burrito.  After I kindly handed over my coupon I was on to the main event.   

It was sooooooo good!  I love this idea of your meal all nicely wrapped up.  It was great with the rice beans, moist chicken and the salsas.  The lettuce provided some 'snap'.  I smothered this beast with green tabasco at every bite...MUY DELICIOSO!  I finished it...barely.  It wasn't until later that I found out EACH of these burritos carry over 1100 calories with all the fixin's.  No wonder I slept like a baby afterwards.  

Eat one.  Or half of one and save the rest of it for later.  You won't regret it.  Unless you eat a whole one with extra beans and hot salsa, then you might.  But probably not.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,1,4,cp-uhOAOq0Q9xOtwVhXmHQ

Thus, sprouts Chipotle, a relatively healthy option for eating; granted, you choose your ingredients wisely.

Since this particular location is located right by UNLV, lines can get pretty long during lunch hours. They seem to handle themselves pretty well when the lunch rush comes. For Summer time, it's not too bad. During regular semester periods, lunch lines can go out the door.

Food is what you'd expect - Familiar, safe, flavors that are almost carbon copies of the thousands of other Chipotle locations out there. The only problem that I occasionally encounter is the rice, which can be a little dry at times. But hey, I'm not really eating here to impress my palette tenfold. It's simple good food that gets the job done. 

Sure, I feel like a total sheep-brain by drudging through the long lines, reciting my order by memory (chicken bowl to-go, with black beans, pico de gallo, corn salsa, a sprinkle of cheese, and lettuce). I've been here so many times, I could order this stuff with my eyes closed.

When someone comes out with another fresh fast food option, I'll diversify -- but for now, I'm basically on the Chipotle diet!

For those interested, I get a chicken salad bowl with all the veggies and salsas, guacamole, black beans and brown rice. No sour cream or cheese; that shit is poison. Ditto with the sodas and drinks.

Choose the meat- chicken, steak, barbacoa (naturally raised beef), carnitas (pork) or vegetarian. Choose the burrito, burrrito bowl, tacos or salad. I really liked my chicken salad. Romaine greens, topped with medium roasted chili-corn salsa, mild- pico de gallo, chipotle chicken, peppers & onions, corn, and shredded cheese and the side of chipotle-honey vinaigrette. There was so much flavor from both salsas and the peppers & onions, that I really didn't put too much additional salad dressing. (You can get it with sour cream and avocado but I thought it was fine.) It was soooo good- I finished it. My husband got the carnitas burrito- he called it a two fister- it's huge, I would probably only eat half. He really enjoyed it. (He got steak the first time, but it was dry so he didn't like it.)

Chipotle started near the campus of the University of Denver. At one time McDonald's had stock in the company, but a couple years ago the owner of Chipotle bought back that stock. The owner is a proponent of healthy food, and even sponsored showings of Food, Inc. I can appreciate that.

My typical order is a veggie burrito with rice, black beans, fajita veggies, corn salsa, pico and lettuce. I've never had a bad experience with any of these ingredients. I could probably eat this a few times a week, but I am glad I don't have to. 

I think that the staff at this Chipotle are probably the nicest and the quickest that I've experienced. This is probably due  to the location near UNLV.

Personally, I do not think you could go wrong getting the steak (carne asada) burrito. I get it with pinto beans, white rice, cheese, pico de gallo, and lettuce.

If you need to order for pick up the next day, you can start your order the day of,  customize your oder(s), and then submit it the next day. You can't place the order for a future date is my point, but at least you can get the order started and then just hit submit the day of your actual pick up. 

They don't have an ""adult"" quesadilla on their menu. They have a kid's meal quesadilla on their site.

I'm good, I'll stay away until I hear it's been taken care of. Well, remember THIS USED TO BE A MCDONALDS owned company..  I'm good, too many bad things.. Enjoy your corporate death crap..

I'm not a fan of rice/bean/tortilla-topia nor am I a fan of their prices. What did I do? I ordered a kid's meal chicken quesadilla that came with 2 sides, chips & chocolate milk for $3.50. Heck yeah, that's my kind of deal - I was full and only had one side. Their rice is meh x 10. Kid's meals are the only way I'd go here because the rest is just too much food.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,0,3,YpVjj38IvKADfHQg2rG4Sg

The next thing I knew, I had hepatitis A.  It was pretty horrible. I was sick for a little over a month.  The doctor said that I probably caught it from someone handling food who was infected.  The only place that I started going to that was new, was this Chipotle. I'm just saying, I'll never eat here again because I'm 90% sure this is where I got it from.",6LO3hkrSt1-mAU1oR8sbhA,3,1,1,-tFspKV-MNqunLlrGfNK8A
5745829,2012-08-08,0,-FNquqGseSCVMWo7KbK-Tg,"I call chipotle , the subway of Mexican food, because even though it
has some Mexican words like ""carnitas"" or ""tacos"" its nothing close to
a real mexican dish, just like subway is not close to an Italian
sub.It doesn't mean its bad, it just simply means that if you are
going for the full"" Vato loco mexicano sabor arriba arriba ayayayay""
flavor  ; you might want to go to another spot.

Chipotle is clean, fresh ,inexpensive and serve good sized portions.
The pinto beans are very good , so is the chicken and guacamole.The
steak sometimes comes too cooked but you cant ask that much as at the
end of the day it is still a fast food joint.

Calories count on the big menu  is a super plus for me, as a natural
""gordito"" that I am , and trying to lose weight, this is a very good
tool. (I.E I would never eat the chips again because of its calorie
count)",G_bJdUPCnL1x6dvRhyHNyw,0,0,4,aadUXLLTa1RnumUL-yjwow

It's convenient for students since it's right across the street, and while the place always seems to be busy, then again the lines move fairly quick. I've never had a problem with finding seating even when this location is busy. This is your standard Chipotle, and I've always have time to head here when I'm in a quick mood for lunch or get together with friends on campus.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,0,0,4,Bi3WO8tySexwXoFklGsa_A

Just like all other Chipotles, it the usual build your own Mexican fiesta when you order. The staff are always nice and efficient in catering to everyones orders. Even during the lunch crush with a line out the door, it feels that you never have to wait that long before your placing your order. All in all, it's a great, clean and solid restaurant if you want pseudo Mexican food.",AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ,0,0,4,U4tS0f0PDi1IR3ZxyqoE2Q
5982886,2018-02-23,0,-FNquqGseSCVMWo7KbK-Tg,"Ugh, I used to love Chipotle. This review makes me sad. I'd give it 1 star but the checkout guy Keaton was nice. We spent $32.15 for a barbacoa burrito with guac, steak bowl with guac, steak tacos, with a side of guac. $6.15 just on guac alone lol but hey guac is life right? Anyway, when I placed my order I specifically asked for soft corn tortillas. Right before she was about to put the steak I noticed the tortillas looked.. funny. So I asked if they were corn and was told they don't serve them anymore. No problem! Either she didn't hear me, or I spoke too softly (which I often do) and she never heard ""corn"". All good, I'll take crunchy tacos. Yum! The steak bowl was atrocious. First off she put 3 scoops of rice! The bowl was almost full with just rice. I asked her to take off some rice. Then comes the steak. It was so little steak that I could count it! 8 little squares! I ask for a ""little more"" and literally she put 3 more pieces! lol Wow! I had to to ask for double steak at that point. Are you still reading? it gets better! A few months ago I was here and got home only to realize that the chips I paid for weren't in my to go bag. I mention this, and Keaton says ""no problem"" and gives me ""free"" chips. All seems well. We pay and are on our way. When we get home. We realize, hey, they never charged for my double steak! Sweet. No issues there ;) but guys, the food was bad. The rice stale, the steak was too chewy and has so much fat trimmings I fed my dog with them. The rice was also too limey. And the guac, our $6.15 worth of guac... was waaay to lemony . We ate it because, well, were they really going to refund us for half eaten food. With every bite, my love for Chipotle got less and less. And I'm a proud fatty who loves to eat! I just couldn't. It was just blah. So I hang my hat Chipotle. As we go our separate ways, I just want to say this. 3 scoops of rice and 1/4 portion of meat is not the way to go :(
Sincerely,
No more Chipotle... for now",S9wKc6osMZ0IcaG_mdUm3g,0,0,2,YVb_i620fSpuHQWBxK_YdA
