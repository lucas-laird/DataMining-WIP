1111345,2017-09-13,0,Yq7u6XXyDITG7I6yKAXU0g,I've been eating at Capriotti's for over 25 years and love this place. However the store on Decatur and Blue Diamond needs help. I was at this store again today 9/12/2017 and I can tell the employees were trying hard to make everyone happy but the restaurant is in serious trouble. Customers asking for refunds leaving upset. I will still eat at Capriotti's but at another store. This one doesn't have a clue what they're doing.,yXEFmFOmawDhGCWTegl-8w,0,0,1,CZdJgmgRzHXZqGDpqJlUwg
1761328,2018-05-07,1,Yq7u6XXyDITG7I6yKAXU0g,"Just a suggestion; when I order a cheesesteak with provolone and onions and then I come and pick it up don't say a cheesecake no American no mushrooms no bell pepper, what the hell is that? Just confirm what I ordered and not tell me everything I didn't put on it. FYI a real cheesesteak from Philly doesn't have bell peppers or mushrooms and it's not call pepper relish it's called hoagie spread. Relish goes on a hotdog.

I ordered a 'capastromi,' although my food was tasty I felt the sandwich was skimpy with the meat portions. I should never bite into a sandwich and only get slaw in that bite. And sadly that was the case. I also ordered chicken noodle soup and the both was delicious but I did not have hardly any chicken or noodles in my soup, just a few carrot slices. I could literally drink it through a straw.  I would come back, after all they just opened. If they fixed what I noticed it would easily get a 5 star rating from me.",CB8k22umDq8l70pdSHuMcA,0,0,2,pHHhwpDRvhvuSt48H8isPw

The new location and the decor make this one a bit Special, but it is the staff that makes this place great.  Most Capriotti's have people with great attitudes, but this one is the best so far.  It's a joy to come here for a great sandwich.    Keep up the good work.",cMMNiFwCfPbWQUHJWfTVdg,0,0,5,_NC1PAuef1qo57Z4aKMKyw

2557163,2017-08-31,3,Yq7u6XXyDITG7I6yKAXU0g,"Probably the nicest Capriotti's I have ever been to. Newly opened on Blue Diamond and has lots of patio seating. 

We popped in to pick up dinner and walked out with 4 sandwiches: large Philly cheesesteak with extra peppers, Italian sub, meatball sub and a capistrami with extra hot peppers. 

All delicious and made perfectly. On the wall they have a pic of meatball subs that makes your mouth water (also the reason I got a meatball sub). 

Thank you for a nice visit, will be back again!",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,3,3,5,x_f19Ph6rbi2sm1isB0EKg
2598616,2018-04-07,1,Yq7u6XXyDITG7I6yKAXU0g,"The people are cool, sandwiches are below average. We get the same thing each time we go. Chicken Cheese steak. One with no onions and the other with extra cheese and extra onion. Either one of the two happens. They put onions on the one we asked not too or they give me the driest sandwich in which I asked for extra cheese. They need to send the people from the Cap store across from the hard rock and teach these people how to make great sandwiches. I will no longer come to this location. PS- I want my beer money back.",hpv3W8kNg_j_F_DcFOP53w,0,0,2,ZJT48iUB9dmsMcAKW4Y4jg

I ordered two sandwiches on two different occasions and both were pretty much inedible. The Grilled Italian and the Homemade Tuna were both so awful!! I took a couple bites and threw them away. Maybe it's due to new people, new store? I'm not sure, but it's very disappointing. We need good food options on this side of town.",hOUXgXGHEBbleF01CTULIg,0,0,2,eW2Ol7C-eU5GCaAU1t27dA

I got the cheese steak, asked for meat and cheese only and still had onions and peppers in it.  Once my sandwich was finished cooking it took 5 or so minutes for someone to finally hand me it.",xNnK32bgye1kWQzI7mdHdw,2,0,1,Rw4w0SWiw4v-3orKOq-ygA

Bring back the uniqueness that we all have grown up with. Don't fall in line with corporate stores and lemmings lifestyle.,nfp4QXnZM4c_HhdYlyuu0w,0,0,3,XZautmd_gl31B5qj_Uw8JA

All employees were nice, but appeared to not have a sense of urgency nor did they go out of their way to toss a smile or a hello agter the order was made......made for a wait a tad too long. Dining area was neat and clean. Kind of hard to mess up a sandwich, this place is usually good.",jkJqN6pNx9gkccvqUTFiQQ,0,0,2,xUObECrfLpvoR23DjhVTpw
4540368,2018-06-25,6,Yq7u6XXyDITG7I6yKAXU0g,"This location seems to have the friendliest staff out of any location I've been to.  You are greeted when you walk in the door and you made to feel welcome by everyone.

Nina was awesome and did a great job making my sandwiches the way I requested.  I believe Matt was the gentleman's name who is the manager I dealt with on my first visit and he is AWESOME.

The manager sets the tone for the rest of the staff and Matt's personality definitely reflects in the rest of the staff.

I highly recommend this location and if you go in when it's busy, be patient and understanding that the staff is doing their best to keep everyone happy.  It sometimes unfortunately does not work out that way but from what I've observed on my visits is that they try and that's all you can ask for.

I will be back..",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,8,8,5,Dv4oUvJxhSQZGnD1P2Wueg

5811665,2017-08-16,4,Yq7u6XXyDITG7I6yKAXU0g,"Well this was the first time trying this place since they just opened not long ago.
We wanted to try something different so we ordered the half sub and soup special. I thought it was expensive if you ask me. It was like $9. So it was over $20 with 2 specials and a drink. It didn't even fill you up for that kind of money!
The soup comes in a small container and the sub is very small for being a half.
Very disappointed in how much came on the sub. They make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it. They just proceed to make it the way they want.
I can honestly say you get so much more for your money at Subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers!
The soup was hot and had a good flavor but such a small container and they fill just above half. We didn't get much at all.
Over all not our favorite sub place. Not happy. Not sure if we would go back here.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,9,7,3,8ZLUN83zwoxM_SZ7NZlj2w
