My husband and I show up at this place around 8:50pm without a reservation, we waited at the lounge area for only 5 minutes the manger came out and seated us at a comfortable table.  We ordered a $65/pp dinner, our captain server Charles recommended crispy duck since it has to be 3 people to order Peking duck, it was really good! We let him recommend the other dishes as well, they all turned out delicious.  The service was awesome!   We got a crew of four taking good care of us - Charles, Brenda, Daniel and Tony.  The décor was very unique and beautiful, you definitely have the feel of a four stars restaurant.  We will be back at our next Vegas trip!

199357,2016-04-13,1,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"I am a Chinese, I love food and I know my food - I know what authentic Chinese food stands for, what fine Chinese food promises to offer and what contemporary Chinese food aspires to deliver.  And this restaurant offers none of those.  But the price tag is astronomical.  A Peking duck package (offered only to party three and more) cost $76/person.  As part of the package, you can choose certain numbers of dishes from the appetizer selection and entree selection.  Just to give you some idea, if you go to a Chinese restaurant in China town just a couple of miles off the Strip, you can find very good Peking duck with three different ways to eat it for half the price.  And the Peking duck is only offered as a package.  If you don't like the package, you can order your meal a la carte.  In that way, a small plate of Mr. Chow's noodle in the appetizer section, the signature dish of the restaurant with hand crafted noodle (which is slightly different version of zhangjiang mian), cost $19.99 and in the main entree selection, most of the dishes are in the range of $40 and up with a few exceptions in the $30 range.  If you want rice and vegetable, $7.50 per person.  On top of that, the dishes had no presentation, of small quantity on a very small tin plate (maybe silver but it really did not look like silver) and were brought out to a very cramped table.
Now talking about service, we saw more serving staff than people dining in the restaurant.  The most dutiful person was the person who filled up the drinks.  My son ordered a pink lemonade.  Every time his glass was left with 1/3 of the lemonade, he would be presented with another full glass of lemonade. And that went on 5 times.  Other than that, although there were more staffers than diners it took longer than usual for the orders to be taken and for the food to be served.  
And ambient, my kids said it felt like we were in a spaceship.  The restaurant had a very futuristic feel to it.  The lighting was fluorescent, turning blue as the moon dropped down from the ceiling every 20 or so minutes.  It may be cool, but really did not offer a pleasant, cozy dining experience.",CBdK5tAvwaSHcDYZLVTjuQ,0,0,1,tnkICnxrQB6tmMIUON-AeQ
226748,2015-12-30,2,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"Sorry but I have to agree with most of the other negative reviews here.  I frequently eat Chinese food at many of the great local places on Spring Mountain Rd.  I expected Mr. Chow to blow away the quality and taste of those places.  However I was extremely disappointed!!  None of the dishes I ordered (Gamblers Duck, Sautéed String Beans, Dungeness Crab Appetizer) would I ever order again and I only really enjoyed one dish - the Shrimp Spring rolls (fried shrimp in a egg roll wrapper) and anyone can make that!
I will give kudos to the excellent attentive service and the beautiful dining room.  But for the prices they charge, you can go out to dinner five times in Chinatown and find some much tastier food.

375558,2016-02-27,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"Wow. What a disappointment. I was really looking forward to this, but the experience was completely underwhelming. 
They're trying to set themselves up as fine dining at a reasonable price point and in this they succeed. The dishes we ordered were excellent. Possibly the best water dumplings I've ever had. The drunken fish and lamb were also very good. The atmosphere is pleasant, although the background music and much-talked-about kinetic sculpture were nothing much to admire.

The problems are primarily on the service side. If you are used to high quality service at higher end establishments, adjust your expectations downward now. During the course of our meal I mentioned to my dinner partner that I was reminded of Cheesecake Factory and also Chili's. Not exactly what this restaurant is going for (I hope). The first was having another couple seated directly next to us despite an abundance of other available 2 tops. The second was being asked if everything was satisfactory by about 5 people in less than a minute. They have a communal serving ""team"", which just translates into bad timing and unecessary interruptions. For example, the hot sauce for our first course was delivered prior to us ordering anything, and sat on the table with no purpose for at least 20 minutes.

Other service ""highlights"":
Lost our reservation and were made to wait.

Simultaneous clearing/serving created a soy sauce spill. Luckily did not get on me, but no one thought to ask about that.

Hot tea served in a demitasse cup (wtf?)

Empty water glasses

Slow clearing  (the manager actually cleared our table because the waitstaff left it that long)

In short, if you want some excellent food at a fair price and are accustomed to the poor service at those overpriced pretention-for-its-own-sake restaurants, you'll enjoy Mr. Chow. However, if you're used to the finer aspects and enjoy the attention to detail that is generally expected in fine dining, skip this one.",Ef2ohjxbSOt_4bjrc-Hieg,0,0,2,k7SIuc25M5oFNRlqmEoH2w

390604,2017-03-17,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"I recommend you skip this restaurant. 
Our experience occurred during March Madness week. Inadvertently, we reserved during Prix fix evening, which included 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, rice, and a single vegetable for 3 people. We had one mid-range bottle of wine additionally. Bill =$360. 
Appetizers were: vegetarian noodles with a bean sauce (bland), pot stickers (decent, when eaten with a delicious chili sauce; although not one single wait staff could tell us if the green vegetable inside was seaweed or kale or something else...), and prawns with walnuts. Other guests Ate these and said they were delicious. Other two appetizers disappointing. 
Entrees: Beijing chicken (dry and without much flavor), seasoned filet beef (actually very good; well-prepared medium), and ""drunken fish"" (very bland white fish with some kind of sauce without much taste).  Garlic broccoli, which was actually quite good. Fried rice with vegetables which was not recognizable as fried rice. 
We didn't even ask to see the dessert cart.
A champagne trolley visited before the meal, with offerings by the glass starting at almost $40 (up to more than $100/glass).  

Some of the foods were edible but not outstanding. Other items, we didn't even eat more than one bite (e.g., fish). We left many bites of all the offerings on the plates. 

In our opinion, the decor is unusual and was disturbing. Lights kept going on and off and a large sculpture- type art piece in the center of the room kept raising up and lowering down. Staff was attentive.

Bottom line: food was just not good. It was ok. But nothing was good. I'm surprised a chef actually has eaten these offerings and signed off on these.",QemTyuZdtyf0u1NeNHPK7A,5,2,2,273FWGLoZYHX7GKWEF9bjQ

414312,2017-08-10,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"First time in Vegas, so we thought price equated to quality. Much like many things about the city, there are lots of gimmicks and illusions. The wait staff and front of house staff in general were very nice, but coming from a culinary make or break city like Houston, the food was worth no where near the price. I was expecting some out of this world meal, but it seems that there is more hype to this place than there is substance. We had some odd pre fixed meal, and champagne which were 520 too much. I'm not sure I will be back to vegas anytime soon, nor any overly expensive disillusioned restaurants who don't have any respect for their employees to offer food that keeps them working and paid by keeping people in their place of business. I'm really glad I had the chic experience, but it was very lackluster. The drunken fish was in a sauce that tasted like cornstarch and chicken broth with ear mushrooms. The chicken satay was sad and had an odd creamy texture...so on and so forth. Mr. Chow, please taste your food. Please see what other great Chinese restaurants have to offer.

I checked a few reviews and was a little concerned at first, but we made reservations already so I was open to the fact that 47 years of success at 6 other restaurants cant be wrong!  Walked up to the entrance, which was next to Rao's, and was greeted by the down stairs hostess.  I got into the elevator and up up up we went.  When the door opened it was like walking into a different world.  The stank of smoke and bustle of gamblers was gone and we walked into this amazing pristine white room that smelled of these white flowers that were everywhere.  After the hostess greeting we were led to the bar by Victor and he had us giggling all the way down!  The bar is in the back of the restaurant but after seeing the view, I understand why.  Amazing sunset overlooking the Garden of the Gods Pool!  The Bartenders were busy with the cracking and shaking of cocktails for the many dining on the floor.  We sat in the lounge and waited for the rest of our party!  One of the bartenders came out and offered us a menu with drinks and wine, He was from Australia or new Zealand, but we laughed because his name sounded like Britt, Short for brittish lol  He recommended a few cocktails but we had our mind on a bottle with dinner so we got Champagne!  After all this seemed the perfect choice for such a beautiful room!   Victor came back and picked us up with the rest of our party and we were whisked away to our table.  Our Captain, as he introduced himself, was Charles and after the menu presentation I understand why.  He guided us through the selections and we chose the Bejing duck prefix.  While this was going on servers were filling glasses, setting up more Champagne and moving like clockwork.  Big smiles and pleasant mannerisms set the tone for what was to come! Yea we started to feel the champagne a little and then the dishes started coming.  4 starters which were portioned for our party, according the the captain, and lots of food it was.   Squab with lettuce wraps, salt and pepper prawns, Mr Chow spare ribs and Squid ink rice noodles.  this was my doing btw lol everyone had ink in there teeth from the noodles, I took some blackmail pictures that you don't get to see  :)  Squab was amazing with the house made hoisin sauce as was the salt and pepper prawns,,,, Crispy and the seasoning was amazing.   So far our captain has guided us through the waters.  Second course was Sea bass, Velvet chicken, and Spicy pork.  The sea bass was perfect, Light flakey with ginger soy like sauce with Cilantro.  Great combo of flavors as was the spicy pork. Note to self,  should have had the velvet chicken first as it was the lightest of flavors.  Sauteed rice?  it was nice and not like fried rice is usually done. 
Finally the Dish we all waited for,  The Duck!!! Chef came to the table and carved crispy pieces of this amazing duck.  Served with hand made tortillias and duck sauce with some vegetables sticks that was just the perfect way to end the night. We had no room for dessert!  Finishing up our Champagne  Veuve btw! we were off to the a different kind of show.   I must have had 5 or 6 people wishing us a good night on the way out and thanking us for coming.  Nice touch to the night!  Thank you Mr Chow for making a fun memorable night 47 years in the making!

We ordered some cocktails and the. Asked our server for recommendations. We couldn't get a clear answer on what she thought was good. Half way through ordering a new server came over and was all I will actually be taking your order. So then we had to reorder all of our cocktails and water. Then asked her for suggestions. She recommended the Dover, the fresh fish that isn't on the menu and, the squid ink noodles, lamb and onions, and the shrimp with walnuts. 

The noodles came out lightening speed. They were so salty I couldn't do another bite.

The walnut shrimp was divine.

Then the lamb and onions came out and it was okay. Nothing to rave about.

However the Dover that was so fresh ended up tasting like jerky and being so cold! It was terrible! I have never had a fish be so hard and tough to chew! 

No one came to clear our plates for 40 mins! Then I had to hunt down one of the busboys to get our check.

After we were seated, we ordered bottled water, which came promptly. However, after hubby and son drank about half their glass, a water boy came over and refilled their glasses with tap water, without checking or making eye contact to see if it was what we had in our glasses. Apologized, but did not ask if we wanted new glasses of water.
Next, we waited 10 minutes for menus. Once they came, we waited another 15 minutes before our server came back to take our order. We tried to make eye contact with ANYONE to call them over so we could order after 5 minutes, but they all seemed busy doing nothing but walk around looking busy!

Right away was the response. 10 minutes later, we asked for a third time, and it was finally produced. Drinks came half way through first courses.
Food came promptly once ordered, however our party of four felt it was tasteless except for very salty (if that is a taste). 
I stated at the start of ordering that I had an allergy and was VERY clear. Guess what? Not communicated to the kitchen or was ignored by the kitchen. I almost expect this from a restaurant in Chinatown, but not from Mr. Chow, where we have paid $$$.

They do a live show and the chef demonstrates how he turns one slab of dough into hundreds of strands, within a matter of minutes!

The champagne cart was a wonderful presentation, and I wish I were able to sample it. The server did get the bartender to make some fun mocktails. The service was flawless, prompt, and non-invasive.

If you're okay paying about $100 per person (the only reason for the 4 stars) and you want some of the best Asian food you've ever had, this is the place to go.

1365514,2016-05-25,2,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"Had made a reservation through Open Table a month earlier for my first time at Mr Chows. My wife and I were running about 5-10 late for our 6 pm reservation so I called ahead to let them know. Upon arriving, a 20-something young woman dressed in a TJ Maxx black dress said, ""I'm sorry Dr. Didn't anyone tell you? There are no tank tops or open toed shoes in the restaurant ."" I'm sure the young woman had no idea what the brands Faconnable or Johnston Murphy were, which was what I was wearing. I'm pretty sure Faconnable does not carry tank tops in their line. The Johnston-Murphy leather sandals I was wearing, I must say, looked pretty nice. But we were told we would not be allowed to have dinner at Mr Chows. My complaint is that a perhaps well intentioned but inadequately trained 20-something prevented a new customer from trying their restaurant. Perhaps Mr Chow should a) make sure their dress code is front and center at Open Table, and b) allow their employees the discretion to make distinctions between a dress code that prevents tank tops and flip-flops yet welcomes those who resemble the kind of customers that one would think Mr Chow would want as a customer. I'm pretty sure Bubba with his Coors Light tank and flip flops would not be waiting to take the magic elevator ride up to Mr Chows.

1402451,2017-10-13,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"I will be honest. Our decision to dine at Mr Chow was solely based on the fact that this is such a polarizing restaurant. People either seem to love it, or hate it, and I wanted to see which end of the spectrum we belonged. And the verdict is.....*drumroll*....neither. We fell exactly in between. It was actually a 3.5 star experience, but I am rounding up solely based on the awesome champagne trolley, and their Chow-lini. It was by far the best champagne cocktail I have ever had in my life, but more about that later. Let's start with the champagne trolley. I absolutely love this concept! High end champagnes by the glass offered at the start of your meal? Yes please! I started with a glass of Moët and Chandon, and my husband got a Manhattan. He enjoyed his cocktail, and of course I enjoyed my champagne. He ordered another, and I moved on to the Chow-lini. Moët with a homemade peach purée and whip cream!?! Simply divine. We decided against the prix fix menu since I wanted to try things beyond the entrees they offer. For appetizers we chose the walnut prawns and squid ink noodles. The walnut prawns are wonderful. I especially enjoyed them dipped in a little of Mr Chow's homemade chili sauce (wish they bottled it!). However the squid ink noodles were a big disappointment. It looks exactly how you would imagine, and there was plenty of well cooked squid to be found in the black goop, but there wasn't much flavor. For our entrees we ordered the fiery beef, and famous green prawns. We decided on the shrimp rice and baby bok choy as our sides. Again, this was split down the middle. The fiery beef was delicious! Don't expect too much heat, but the flavor and slight kick were outstanding. Very well done. However, the green prawns were so boring. They had a slight garlic flavor but beyond that there just wasn't any substance to the dish. I found myself wishing I could salt it or pour some soy sauce on it. The bok choy is nothing inventive, but I didn't mind. It was perfectly seasoned and prepared, and was a lovely accompaniment to both dishes. As for the ""fried"" rice, don't expect the soy laden variety you get from your local Chinese restaurant. It was light, airy, and delicious. Very unexpected, and enjoyed. Service started off outstanding, but sort of broke down after we finished our meal. We sat there for an awkwardly long amount of time after they cleared our plates with empty drinks. Someone finally came over and asked if we wanted desert, but we decided to drink our desert. Another Chow-Lini please! Overall we enjoyed our meal at Mr Chow. I believe a lot of the complaints come from people who can't easily afford this type of meal, and have regret spending $300 (or more) on what essentially is dressed up Chinese food and not being blown away. If you cannot easily afford this type of restaurant then you will likely be disappointed. We can, and we enjoyed it.

We enters in to the restaurant entrance where there was a little bdsm feel with the hanging chains and then took an elevator up to the dining area.  The first thing I noticed is that the restaurant is pristine with. Clean lines and very white .  There were white flowers all over the place and that made me feel even more worried that the food might not appeal to an Asian palate since white flowers symbolize death.   
The wait staff is very attentive but they are little pushy with the liquor.   
I had the crab chicken corn soup .  I thought 14.50 is pricey for 1 small bowl of soup but it is delicious.  The taste is delicate yet delicious and you can taste each ingredient that melts in your mouth.  I also had the the box dumplings which was pork wrapped in a pastry.  A bit too doughy for me but it reminded me of something you would get in France.  The gamers duck was crispy yet juicy and succulent.  The lily bulb with yam was gentle yet again the flavor bits all meld together and the mushrooms are a must have.  The sauce they are cooked in is delicious.   Got the blood orange and lychee for desert.  Lychees were not special but the blood orange is soaked in gran marnier and it is so sweet and tasty.  It is expensive it so worth it.  
Only complaint is that the hostess should learn to host and not argue with a guest.   We had made a reservation with the hostess downstairs.

While we ate, two waiters or busboys dropped things near us ... one was a tray and a full drink, while the other was silverware and a couple of plates.  It was hard to relax after broken glass and a metal tray hit the cement type floor.

** The BEST upscale Chinese **

We started with the Fresh Scallop On The Shell hors doeuvres. The presentation was amazing and the taste was even better. 

Next we got the Beijing Chicken with Walnuts. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the walnuts gave the dish a great flavor. 

Dumplings, one of our favorites was up next. These are a classic from Beijing and they were extra delicious and the purple flower was so cute on the dish. 

I consider myself a steak snob, and Mr. Chow's MA MIGNON is pretty high on my favorite steak's list. This steak has been a staple item and an original recipe since 1975. The filet mignon was cooked just how we love it... medium rare and still mooing. 

One of my absolute favorite dishes finally made an appearance. If you ever visit Mr. Chow, these Chicken Satay are a MUST TRY. I could literally eat a whole platter by myself, but unfortunately, I had to share these ones.

You absolutely cannot leave Mr. Chow without trying the peeking duck. Make sure you ask how to make it the right way. The plum sauce with the duck is just amazing.

1586370,2016-03-01,1,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"I really liked this place. I'll start with the cons, then the pros!

Cons: Food was really nothing special. Honestly, it was pretty standard Chinese food, perhaps without tons of MSG. 

The food, drinks, as well as desert does in NO WAY justify the astronomical prices. Also, the ""fried rice"" was nothing more than sticky white rice. i can go on and on about the food being pretty standard, but who cares, no one really comes here for the food. Its all about the show...

Pros: I felt as though the waiters and the staff were more of actors performing in a play rather than actual restaurant employees. Everything from the way they spoke and the way they dressed and carried themselves contributed to the aura of feeling like you're in a play. I LOVED the artwork thingy that kept coming down and morphing. I LOVED the fact that you need to take an elevator to the restaurant! So cool! Some guy also came out and did some weird show with dough? I don't know what the hell he was doing but it was entertaining! 

You come here for a SHOW!

Honestly, if you want good food and lots of it, go to the buffet about 20 feet away from Mr. Chow. It is a FANTASTIC buffet!

So, to summarize:

OK food, sort of a (total) rip-off, but AWESOME dining experience! 

It is the type of place you come to once and never go back;  the food simply doesn't justify the price. However, I had fun!",ltYNRRH0u7OwoH06YprPGQ,5,0,3,2zXd2qsfaL001lU3NbqRGA

1606816,2017-04-04,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"I sent the following to the GM, Mr. Rozat, after speaking with him, per his request. This was sent via email on March 1, 2017.  I have not heard back otherwise I would have given 2 stars.

Per our conversation, February 20th, I am sending my complaint.

We had 8pm dinner reservations, for 5, on February 18th. 

We arrived early, approximately 730pm and were shown to the bar.  We joined our friend, sitting on the couch.  She had a drink already.  After waiting about 10 minutes for a cocktail waitress, I went to the bar to inquire if we should order there or wait.  The bar had one patron on the end and 3 others at the other end.  The bartender was talking to the 3 and then took a picture, of the group.  I wasn't acknowledged, until after the picture was taken.  A simple nod, or kind gesture would have been appreciated.  He told me there wasn't a cocktail waitress and he would take our order.  He walked over to the table and we ordered 4 cocktails.  We were shown our table and were assured they would deliver our drinks to our table.

As the waiter explained the menu, and we were asked about water, we still didn't have our drinks.  Another waiter came by and asked if we would like drinks.  I informed him we had ordered them at the bar and were still waiting.  It was approximately 25 minutes to receive our drinks from the time of our arrival, in the bar and the delivery.  

When the waiter explained the menu was family style, I asked if I could order a la carte. I was told no, by the main waiter.  Looking at the menu, we found it difficult to decipher the list of items, with prices and the prix fixe menu.  The entire table didn't understand why we couldn't order a la carte. 

I then spoke to he main waiter again, asking why we couldn't order a la carte.  He reiterated we couldn't, if necessary he could ask for special permission.  I have traveled around the world monthly, for the past 12 years and have never had difficulty ordering off a menu.   My point being, I am well travelled and have experienced many different dining experiences.  I felt mislead, thus reducing our experience to a less then pleasant evening.

Your bar staff needs to be instructed on being attentive, even just a quick acknowledgement.  No one should have to walk up to the bar or look for service, especially when the bar area is not busy.

Your waitstaff needs to be clearer without appearing patronizing.  When I inquired about the menu a second time, he should have immediately gone to your maitre d' hotel and requested his help.  The maitre d' hotel is responsible for the dining experience and for the waitstaff, he is there to assist your waitstaff and patrons.

The design of the menu is problematic.   If it is family style, then eliminate the prices for the individual items, if you need to charge more for a specific item then have the charge by that item.  If I have difficulty understanding your menu, then the people that have saved for months to go to your restaurant do too. 

Your reviews are quite low, the food is good but not phenomenal and customer service needs improvement.   When I dine at an establishment,of your level, I expect amazing service, good customer service and fabulous food.  Mr. Chow's of Las Vegas didn't meet any of my criteria.",onE8jrzsvIMDblafb4kG2w,2,1,1,1rUGzlqDjKR8KlKCgSQSVg

It is expensive, like everything in Vegas. However, since I let the waiter pick the entire dinner without even looking at the menu, I was afraid I'd get crushed worse than I did. With multiple drinks, we were just shy of $900 including tip for 6 people.

1624293,2017-05-16,7,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"It is becoming routine. that I eat at Mr. Chow for my last meal while I am in Las Vegas. In my opinion Mr. chows is some of the best Chinese food you will find in the country. I have been to the Mr. chows in Manhattan Beverly Hills and Las Vegas. If I am in the mood for Chinese food as long as there is a Mr. chows around that's where I end up. 

The breakdown for those of you that don't know Mr. chows is an upscale Chinese eatery. The easiest way to explain to someone that has never been here before is Mr. chows is like the steakhouse of Chinese food. The food is pricey but well worth the price. You will need to make reservations at Mr. Chow's before you come. No T-shirts and shorts are allowed to Mr. chows you will need to have at least a button up shirt on to eat here. 

Whenever I come to Mr. chows I always get the $58 paling duck deal. I just $58 per person you get two entrées plus an order of an entire peeking duck and the best part is they have an employee bring the full duck to your table and slice it right in front of you and it's an absolute incredible site. Some of my favorite entrées to get it Mr. chows have to be the walnut encrusted shrimp. The chicken Joanna is absolutely fabulous. The lettuce wrap squab is also another one of my favorites. The shrimp toast is also good but I have to be in the mood for it. The beef strips eat more like a dessert then an actual entrée it's almost like the beef has been candy in a sweet sticky sauce it's absolutely amazing. The fried rice with Mr. chows also is extremely good and tasted very fresh. 

The staff was extremely accommodating both times that I ate at this location we did have some special request and they met each and every special request and in my opinion they went above and beyond. 

overall Mr. chows is probably my favorite Chinese food across the country it is pricey but in my opinion it is well worth the cost. I making it routine that I eat it to Mr. chows in Las Vegas every time I'm visiting. I would definitely recommend eating at Mr. chows when you're in Las Vegas. 

PROS:
- best Chinese food 
- friendly accommodating staff 

CONS:
- can be pricy with alcohol. But hey, it's mr chows",s6lIsLlPcjaHDhXxTV9kKQ,8,7,5,kVB5ma0Ddn2BCxFWen6C3w

1703775,2018-01-11,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"Reservations for a party of 8 this past weekend for my family and me. I honestly don't know why this place is considered fine dining, but that's Vegas for ya. The decor is a bit on the cheesy side (think tacky wedding venue) with a flying saucer that descends every so often in the center of the room. For a ""luxurious Beijing cuisine,"" there wasn't really anything luxurious or Beijing about it.

As we sat down, we were given one menu for the 8 of us. Our server said that it would help cut down the amount of time it takes us to decide on our dishes if one person is in charge. It made ordering very difficult and other servers can tell we were getting frustrated so they finally gave us more menus. Our server then tried to explain how the menu works except he wasn't very clear and we had to ask a thousand questions before it made any sense to us.

We came here because of the Beijing duck they highly recommend. Not sure if this was mandatory since we had a large party, but everyone was forced to order the prefix option where  we were only narrowed down to 3 appetizers, 3-4 main entrees, and the duck as the final course. That was pretty annoying as you can't just order several dishes from the menu. Each dish was mediocre at best. None of the dishes were worth mentioning, everything was coated heavily in sauces. Also, this is a Chinese restaurant...please offer chopsticks. It was totally awkward eating Chinese food with a fork on silver plates. 

Finally, the duck. If you've ever had real Beijing duck, you'd know this was nothing like it. The skin on the duck was really fatty and not thin and crispy. The skin usually comes out first with the Chinese buns to wrap it in, but they did not serve it this way. The duck came with skin, and instead of the buns, we had tortilla like wraps that tasted very powdery? (for lack of better description).

Oh and the lamian or ""chinese hand pulled noodles"" demonstration was laughable.

If you really want authentic Chinese food, go to Chinatown or something. Definitely don't splurge your Vegas winnings here!",q841aGW6y2D3OwSRB6w6nw,4,1,2,1-h1nggFOmATzHSuvoAWyw

But ultimately the food was very lacking. In my opinion their quality was equivelant to take-out. The peeking duck was deep fried  (not an issue) but was very dry (very big issue!). 
We order a fried pork dish and it was only fried fat. I have nothing against this and happily tried it and i would eat some again, but the dish seems more as a quality garnish or ingredient part of another dish, not a seperate order.
The Mr Chow noodles were nothing special.
The chicken satay reminded me of what you would find at a Chinese take-out.
The bok Choy was good, well seasoned and well prepared.
The scallion pancakes were very good.


Ultimately i would go back for cocktails with clients or to celebrate with friends and family and maybe order an appetizer while we drank and conversed.

They threw together 3 small awkward tables into 1 for our party of 8, which had seams everywhere, causing drinks to tip over. The table was very low, like a kids table. We were butted up against 2 other tables initially. They were less than happy about moving us to a better table, telling us those were held for ""other reservations,"" (ummm, we are actually here in person now) but finally moved us after pressing them. Great start...

SERVER:
""Just tell me what you like & don't, & I'll figure it out. I'm really good at my job..."" Pompous BS. No need. They apparently do group service, because we never saw him again after his long into speech. There were 4-5 different people (kind of) waiting on us (server, drink lady, water refiller, food runner/busboys), which led to basically nobody waiting on us. The drink lady only came around twice the whole meal (we sat for 30 min before getting our first drinks), because we were told the bar was ""backed up."" For 2 hours?? She just disappeared after telling us that. They lost out on easy money because they couldn't figure it out, and we wanted to drink. Even the water filler only came once. I've seen group service at other restaurants (never this bad), and it just doesn't work as well as having one dedicated server. Our group all agreed this was easily the worst service we've ever had for this price point, and we eat out at nice restaurants in LA often.

FOOD:
The soup dumplings were good, as were the shrimp and walnuts and a few other dishes. We didn't like 2-3 of the dishes, but where was our server for us to send them back? Nowhere to be found, and the food runner had no answers when we asked what to do. Big speech when we first sat down about if we don't like anything, send it back no questions asked. Laughable. 
They also screwed up our dessert order, and though they offered to swap it out, at this point we just wanted to leave. The 8 of us were very disappointed. 

OVERALL:
Maybe every other table that night had a great experience. Our table? We all couldn't wait to leave. I would give the food 3-4 stars, but I can't because we were treated like we were lucky to be there, and doing Mr Chow a favor. Over a $1,000 bill, and we would have rather been anywhere else.

We started with happy hour, which I highly recommend. The service was very good, and the cocktails and champagne are 50% off what you will pay in the restaurant. There is a nice appetizer list, which is also significantly cheaper than the restaurant. The cocktails were creative and delicious. The chicken satay appetizer we had was very good.

Dinner was good but not great. The service was outstanding. Our captain and his crew did a very good job of taking care of us. The champagne cart is a great idea but way too pricey so we declined and ordered a bottle of wine instead (also pricey but not as bad as the champagne).

We all ordered the Mr. Chow prix fixe. It is a lot of food for the money and we could not finish everything.

Service - Maitre d' was super helpful.  My reservation was for 4 people and we expanded to 6 with no issue.  Our waiter was awesome. Excellent personality and knowledgable.  
Food -  Peking duck = AMAZING.  Prawns with walnuts = Sensational.

I should have tried the Vegas location sooner....  Awesome experience.

And I was excited to experience the infamous Mr Chow.  First, we had the most pretentious and arrogant waiter.  I spent many years in China and I am Asian myself.  After asking if we understood the menu, I responded yes.  The waiter proceeded to tell me what each dish was and how they are to be eaten.  Then, we order and he tells us the dishes to go together like that.  I understand he was trying to upsell, but we were very clear that we wanted to order a la carte instead.  The portion sizes were small, which was as expected.  And worse of all, I got sick after eating here.

Tables for 2 are very close to other tables for 2. Literally 15 inches between tables. Not very convenient or ideal.

Problems:
1) After sitting down, we waited for 10 min before anybody greeted us. After that wait, we were served water and the waiter handed us the menu.
2) We then waited for an additional 15 min. I saw that the waiter took the order for a table that was seated after us and went to other tables to see how they were doing.

Rather than wait to see if he would ever come back to our table, we decided to leave. Told the manager about our experience who offered to take our order the but the damage had already been done.

2007765,2016-02-18,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"Stunningly bad!  This restaurant is a failure on almost every level.  Imagine going to your local Chinese shopping center buffet at 3 in the afternoon, after the food has been sitting for several hours...welcome to the world famous Mr. Chow! Then imagine waiting an hour and a half for said food to be delivered.   Finally the bill comes and it is almost $500 dollars without alcohol!  Welcome to the world famous Mr. Chow!  The service is so bad, so disorganized and so haughty that it gives poor service a bad name. While we were waiting...and waiting ....and waiting we saw at least one party get up and leave.  Would that we had done the same!   There are lots of people who work there, and they run around like they are very busy, but apparently none of them cook or serve.   

The one bright spot is the bar which is expertly run, makes killer drinks (we loved the Pineapple 1880!) and would be a great place to hang out for the evening. 

 I wish I had better things to say about Mr. Chow as I have enjoyed the food at the NYC venue but this restaurant is symptomatic of what has gone awry at many Las Vegas locales; celebrity chefs, indifferent food, terrible service and an attitude that they just don't care about your business.  Perhaps the steady stream of tourists makes it unnecessary to serve good food in a competent manner but I would never go back.",sW0Am6XyqKqQnY3m1lX7-A,4,0,1,naqcGFb6hdEv4-xaa4ypWg

Didn't like the chairs - the arms were in the way.  Not too comfortable.  But whatever.  They offer a champagne cart.  Can't say I know too many places that sell you one glass to try a new kind.  Pretty cool.  We started with a glass of Krug.  Then went into their specialty drinks.  Gin with mint somethingorother and a Pineapple martini - can't remember their names.  But really good and great pours!  Love the easy ordering of food.  Two appys, Two main courses.  Rice and veggies included.  Can't get easier than that.  You can order different ways as well, but the set meal is the way to go.  Appys we had were shrimp rolls and shrimp toast.  Delicious.  They have a spicy specialty dip that is AWESOME!  Wish they would sell it by the bottle.  Main course - duck and salt and pepper lobster.  So good.  Sauteed rice and we got spicy green beans.  Love the portion sizes too.  Not gluttony huge.  You can finish what you order and don't have to carry a doggie bag around the casino.  Dessert - my hubs favorite - coconut cake.  Super light.  Not overly sweet.  Really good.  BUT the cart was too low.  When it came out to the table I could only see two shelves. Didn't realize there was a crazy chocolate cake on the bottom shelf I would have tried.  Next time - we're locals.  Service was fantastic.  Super friendly.  Waiter, Corey, knew his stuff.  Turned us on to some great food.  And prices - it's Vegas.  You want cheap, stay off the strip.

Since there was so much hype about this restaurant I had some pretty high expectations and they did not disappoint.  We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated almost immediately. Once we were seated we were greeted within a few minutes with our drink menus and quickly after that the food menus. Each server that came across our table was very friendly. The service was phenomenal! 

The food was excellent and the best Asian style food I've ever had. We decided to go with the recommended set price menu, while included two options from the appetizers, two options from the main dishes, a vegetable and a choice of rice. 

Pot stickers: INCREDIBLE. They are crispy and unlike anything I've ever had before. 

Mr. Chows noodles: which the noodles themselves are made in house and if you're lucky you'll see them being made, were delicious. I expected more of a chow mein style noodle but instead received the noodles plain with a sauce overtop. There is an explosion of flavor once the noodles and sauce are mixed. Definitely a favorite!

Green shrimp: which is cooked in spinach and is actually green was so tender that it practically melted in your mouth. 

Beijing chicken: chicken breast that was cut into cubes. It has a soft crunchy on the outside but the meat itself was very tender and full of flavor. It had a light sweetness to it!

Green beans: DELICIOUS. I could have just eaten the green beans and been completely content. They had the right amount of kick to them. 

Raspberry cheesecake: So soft and creamy. Cheesecake with a graham cracker crust and raspberry drizzle. 

Blood oranges: I want to say that they were marinated in bourbon ( I could be wrong)? Either way they were absolutely delicious.",aXOkJO_X9IdiXiyjeCJ3tQ,1,0,5,m_dPZTJ3eWTZzTsSdQr3yw

I hear about this place and was told it was way overpriced but hey you only live once so off we go. Reservation was simple enough for a good reason cause there are hardly anyone there on Chinese new years eve and that already concerns me. The previous restaurant in that location inside Ceasars was Empress court, a romantic restaurant with very good Chinese food on the pricey side. This on the other hand is just in bad taste, everything is in white and bright, I am not sure if I was having dinner or being operated on? They tried to change the previous décor and it was just done badly. There is this thing above the place and every few minutes it drops down and comes apart and goes back up and that is suppose to be artistic or just pointless and simply doesn't work at all. OK on to the food, menu was also bad in a sense that the whole thing was a laminated sheet, huh! Denny's might have a more presentable menu! OK another sign of trouble, no chopstick and they do not have rice bowls either, wow that is a first for a Chinese restaurant. SO how's the food, every dish was the same, cube shape chicken, cube shaped pork and cube shaped filet.  Is it good, well above average if you go to panda express a lot so that makes it horrible cause the bill for 3 with no drinks came to $320 plus tips! oh the extra was two desserts and two pepsi. seriously, it took me an hour to absorb this after I left and realize this is possibly the worse Asian inspired, chinese something, Asian pan pacific ....whatever you want to call it. Empress court was good , this is just plain showing money for money sake with little regard to food. OH, to top it off, middle of the dinner we have this loud noise and a noodle maker was hand making noodle on a rolling table and banging on the table with the host yelling, "" m,r chow noodle!!!!""  seriously they are that proud of it , except this is Vegas and we have hand pull noodle shops all over town for $12 a bowl anytime...sort of like being in a burger joint and they roll out a meat grinder and yell this is our hamburger meat! sort of comical really! will I be back? not a chance in hell! have I had better food? all the time! have I had more expensive food, only at  Joel robuchon but that let's not compare this to  Joel robuchon as that would be insulting to the word COMPARE.

Minced Beef Pancake $8

Mini Ribs $8
Glazed Prawns $9

I opted for the chicken sate which came with two sate, I ended up ordering a second one of these - the sauce it comes with was a creamy peanut sauce.

Ended up here because everywhere else was a 2hr+ wait or simply can't accommodate a party of 17 people on such short notice. Simply, Mr. Chow is a fancy over-priced Chinese food... And being Asian who grew up eating delicious authentic cheap Asian food... It's a little sad to have to eat those same exact farmiliar dishes for 3x the price and not meeting your expectation one bit. Now don't get me wrong, I've had fancy expensive Chinese food such as Hakkassan... But atleast they were pretty good.. And as for Mr. Chow everything was just pretty mediocre.

Service was phenomenal however, they constantly kept cleaning our table, changing plates for each course, bringing out the food promptly and in a well manner etc... Every thing was professional. Decor was modern, all white a little dim with lightly lit changing colors of blue or purple hues with a big ufo looking thing on top that opens up and moves.

To start from the food; the duck came with a thin pancake but the duck was awfully chewy and doesn't have the same great crispy skin that I liked, Mr. Chow noodles were a really bland version of jia jiang mein. Crispy fried shrimp in mayo sauce with walnuts is my all time classic favorite.. But the sauce wasn't so impressive.. Nothing really stood out maybe besides their green shrimp dish.

2440345,2017-01-04,12,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"Oh the enigma that is Mr Chow! This has got to be one of the more polarizing places I've been to...and I'm not sure if I know a place where price seems to effect opinions more than Mr Chow. They bill themselves as luxurious Beijing cuisine...why is it that there aren't a lot of luxurious Beijing places you run across? Could it be that it is difficult to elevate Beijing cuisine in a highly noticeable way?...perhaps...more on this later. 

What I experienced at Mr Chow was a lot of really tasty food, none of which I would want to go back and pay for, but almost all of which I would gladly eat again if a group of friends wanted to experience it...or even better pay for it. The quality of the product was most certainly better than what you find in a typical Chinese restaurant. Fiery Beef made of filet mignon, Lobster Shumai with large chunks of fresh lobster, etc.. The cooking sauces were also more refined, but then these ingredients were treated in a very similar way to your local wok-fired Chinese take out place. The resulting difference is noticeable, but not to the same extent that the difference between typical and ""luxurious"" food of other cuisines is noticed...in the end, Fiery Beef tastes a lot like Fiery Beef whether it comes from Pearl Wok on Charleston or Mr Chow on the strip. 

An area that Mr Chow shined in was their First Course shared plates. This family style experience actually made more sense than most because they made sure that each guest received two pieces of all the first course appetizers. For example, we shared Lobster Shumai, Shanghai Little Dragon (classic steamed soup dumplings), Mr Chow Spareribs, and Salt & Pepper Prawns in our first course, and each item came with two pieces per person. With the exception of the Mr Chow Spareribs that I didn't really care for, the rest were all rather enjoyable dishes.

Next came selections from their Of Course section. We shared Steamed Sea Bass served with ginger and cilantro, Signature Green Prawns, and Fiery Beef of filet mignon. These were all strong dishes. I think most patrons would enjoy them, though perhaps not enjoy shelling out cash for these items. Essentially you are paying Strip pricing and an entertainment fee for the privilege of this food. A quick skim of the reviews will reveal that many are not interested in the central artwork or the loud hand-pulled noodles as forms of entertainment...resulting in the rather low overall rating for food that is otherwise good. Our Of Course selections were accompanied by Sautéed Baby Bok Choy, Mixed Vegetables, and Shrimp Fried Rice. Here, with these sides, deciphering a difference from your local take out spot was even more difficult, requiring a discerning palate to say the least.  

I think my favorite thing at Mr Chow was the Chili Sauce. I love it when the Chili Sauce is hot enough for a sexy dance on my tongue, but flavorful enough to fill my heart with warmth at the same time. Mr Chow's was an excellent combination of these sensual qualities, and left me wanting more.

The focus of our dinner was the low point for me. Mr Chows Roasted Beijing Duck was recommended to our table by the server and also highly anticipated by other members of our party. Even Vegas, with our less-than-incredible renditions of Chinese Roast Duck, has better offerings than this version. Additionally, the duck is served with a pancake wrapper in place of the bun. This would be forgivable if your duck kicked some major ass...but when your duck falls flat you and you can't even mask the effort in a warm bao bun then you have twice the issues.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,26,19,3,fAyFrMFjewpw3fO7j4Acbg

Decor is mostly all white with colored lights that change every so often; it also has a moving piece in the ceiling that is supposed to represent the moon with multi layers that rearrange in different shapes. It catches your eye. 

As soon as we entered we were being rushed to order as the kitchen was closing. No biggie. We ordered and set down and got our water. It was a waiting game from then on. Our waiter took 20 minutes to come to us after I got his attention for the drink menu. He brought one menu for 5 people. No worries we shared the menu then waited for another 15-20m to get someone's attention to take our drink order. Drinks came to the table at a reasonable time and were very good. I had the ""inception"" cocktail. It was delish. 

Food also came out at a reasonable time. 
Apps: chicken curry puffs $15- 10/10 curry filling was tasteful and good combination with puff pastry
Mr chow spare ribs $19- 5/10 not much flavor.
Beijing meat dumpling $15-7/10 it was a little bland but mr chow's house sauce fixed that. 

Finished our apps and No water refills. Had to get someone's attention for refills. No one checked on us if we wanted more drinks from the bar or anything either. 
Entrée: 
Steamed sea bass $45- 10/10 it's sea bass! The sauce on it was very good. 
Velvet chicken $36- 3/10 no taste at all! Had to add lots of special house sauce.
Lamb with spring onions $38- 3/10 again, no taste to it. All you can taste is the lamb and salt. House sauce helped. 
Beef with oyster sauce $42- 7/10. Oyster sauce added enough salt to make it this dish pleasant. 

Again, finished dinner, no water refills! I mean I am eating Chinese food here. Come on, you know how much salt and oil is In this food?! just refill my water when I am paying $15-20 for appetizers! And They weren't short staffed. They were OVER staffed in my opinion. Staff was just walking around aimlessly. I felt like I had to hunt someone down to get anything I wanted like simple water refills. The staff is friendly and accommodating once you get their attention just not motivated on their own. The worst part of it all was my stomach did not feel well an hour or two after dining here. And suffered the next day as well sitting on the shit pot. (It was only me that had stomach issues the other four diners did not have a problem. so it could just be me)
If it wasn't for the suffering I would have gone back to give them another chance and try other stuff on the menu.

mr chow's special house sauce will fix any dish!",k57uihfxBJLeRqIjrCgPHw,0,0,3,NsuZEiUVGYBcq502X2hs8g

We were seated and immediately expressed that we were ready to order because we only had about an hr to eat.  We placed our order and the first course came out within 10 min then  we weren't checked on for approximately 25min.  We were not even asked about refills on drinks or water.  Finally 35 min and 3 requests after our initial seating we received a refill on water...still no main course.  My brother had to leave his girlfriend because it was taking to long for the food and he had to work. 53 minutes after our appetizers (approx 1hr 22 min after seating) we finally had a server come out with 2 plates (partial order) and by that we were all turned off from dinner all together. I asked to speak with manager on duty, and was soon met by the maitred (host) who was very, rude and immediately told us that it's wasnt their fault bc they were busy (80%capacity) and basically said, ""sorry that we couldn't help any better"" (in a very animated and condescending way).  Finally the manager came out and tried to ""fix"" the situation, I told him I just wanted to cancel the rest of the food and we were so outraged by our experience we just wanted to leave.

Upon arrival you become blinded by the beautiful black and white decoration and the simple logo outside the doors. It's beautifully simple. The anticipation to the table makes it even more interesting, shiny silver carts pass the room complete with buckets of champagne and wine, some holding chocolate desserts that tower over, it almost seems like a scene from the Great Gatsby! I have had the opportunity to visit almost every Mr. Chows with my favorite location being the Miami Location. I never seem to order anything different and this time around, same old thing. Satay Chicken, and yes it's kind of orangeish looking red with a white dipping sauce, it looks gross but it is absolutely perfection!!  The taste is flavorful, yet powerful enough to eat either with the sauce or without, the second item I always always get is the walnut shrimp, perfect size to share with another guest, just the right amount of shrimp and the right amount of walnuts, I enjoy it over or with Mr. Chows lobster fried rice. Some might say Mr. Chows is overpriced for Chinese food and I would absolutely agree, it's very costly!

2848751,2017-06-22,2,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"We stumbled into Mr Chow after we made our rounds around Caesar's Palace and not choosing anywhere else to eat. When you enter Mr. chows you actually have to take elevator upstairs to the dining room. We were there at about 6:30 on a Friday to got seated right away.

The decoration of the restaurant is pretty interesting. There's a nice view because you're up several levels, but everything else is a mix of formal and not so formal. For instance, The wait staff are all dressed in white jackets, the tables are dressed with white linens, but the chairs feel really cheap. They are black, plastic, but don't feel sturdy or heavy at all. As soon as we were seated a server mailed over a card for different champagnes and drinks to be offered, but we passed on most of those.  And then there is the menu. It's one page paper laminated. Reminds me of being at a regular Chinese restaurant. When it comes to ordering it was pretty confusing, our waiter had to explain things to us and tell us not to go off the menu. 

You can buy most of the food options a la carte, but they do offer a price per head option, where you can choose from several different appetizers and entrées to be shared family style. After debating on this for about 30 minutes or group decided to go with the price per head option. Now, we ordered so much stuff that we end up paying a price per head plus additional, but the food was actually really good. Among the things we ordered: crab meat soup, crab claw, dumplings, filet mignon, spicy pork, mixed vegetables, chicken curry appetizer, Mr chow noodles, etc. We did order a lot. But like I said all the food actually was cooked very well, very tasty, and was enough to feed our party of six. The filet and pork seemed to be the favorites. Very tender, juicy, and great flavor. 

All this being said, I still feel that the menu it's priced pretty high. It came to about $75 per person not including the additional menu items we ordered such as the crab claws. Being that this is in Vegas I know things are more expensive. I probably would have been more content with their price if the overall theme of the restaurant stayed classy and formal, not a mix of formal and cheap.",6pQIMyywjL-S2ZxnXagf_Q,9,2,3,gw3fEkS7-hPaO0pJD4GCYw

2885316,2018-06-03,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"Full disclaimer.  This review is going to be long--so if you like short and concise reviews--my apologies.  I just got back to my hotel room from eating here tonight.  We had made a reservation via open table for a party of seven. 

First of all--I want to make clear that the dining room itself is really beautiful.  While it is small--it is very nice and it makes for a cool environment.  I also want to make clear that the food itself was okay--not great--but not terrible. However--if you factor in the price for the food--the food does not live up to anything to the prices that they are charging.   The only reason why this place is even getting one star is because of the beauty of the dining room.  The terrible service and undeserved arrogance of the staff here is beyond egregious.  Their service is flagrantly bad.  

Our miserable experience started when our entire group decided to start out with a round of ice waters.   We get the ice water--and a few of the people in our group decide that they would also like sparkling water.   Before anybody can say a word--everybodies ice water (which for the most part were untouched) were taken off of our table by a server.  Apparently they think that grown adults cannot handle having both a glass of ice water and a glass of sparkling  at the same time.  On top of that--they poured everybody sparkling water--even though only 3-4 out of our 7 person party ordered/wanted sparkling water.  This was just the tip of the iceberg. 

Shortly after we got screwed out of our ice waters and the entire group had sparkling water forced on them--we start evaluating the menus.  We knew the food was served family style--so our plan was to have each person in our party order whatever they wanted--and we would share amongst ourselves. We did notice that at the bottom of the menu--there was a tiny note that said there was a $40 minimum for each person. Being that most of the dishes were in the high $30's--by the time the sparkling water and rice would be added in--we would have had no problem hitting that minimum per person.  So the head waiter comes by and explains how the dishes are served family style--and we mentioned to him how we each wanted to order our own thing and share--and this is when the ""bait and switch"" or ""lie"" happened. Our head waiter lied and informed us that because we had a party of 7-that we HAD to do one of their pre-fixe packages that started at $66 per person.   You can read over their entire menu--and NOWHERE does it say that larger parties are forced to order their pre-fixe menu option. Let me make this clear--it wasn't that he was recommending that we order that--he effectively told us that we had to order that or we couldn't order at all.    We were lied to and absolutely ripped off. On top of that--the $66 per person pre-fixe menu restricts you from ordering any of their really top dishes.  If you want a top dish--you have to pay a premium on top of the $66 per person. 

So we order our food (we didn't want to create a scene so we complied with the lie and did the pre-fixe thing). and for the most part it was okay.   It's food that is worth maybe $30 per person--but its certainly not worth anything close to $66 and up per person.  The green prawns were solid as were the walnut glazed prawns.  The chicken Joanna was ""meh"", the mixed vegetable portion for a group of 7 people was laughable, and the the crispy beef was beyond disappointing.  The crispy beef was basically all batter and no beef. 

After dinner--they ask us if we wanted any tea/coffee/desserts...etc.  A couple of the people in our party ordered stuff. One gal ordered a hot jasmine tea and another gentleman ordered a decaf coffee. The gentleman's coffee was not hot--in fact--it was almost cold--literally maybe room temperature.  They also brought him an entire tray of sugars--including cubed brown sugar--but neglected to bring any cream. They bring out the gals tea--it was a small pot of tea along with a cup.  I kid you not--this cup was smaller than the size of a shot glass.  It was beyond ridiculous.   Even when we weren't getting ripped off by the staff--we were battling their ineptitude and arrogance.  

To sum it all up--I will never go to this restaurant again.  I understand that food is a subjective thing and that prices will vary. However--I do know that most fancy restaurants that serve mediocre food generally provide service that is good and friendly enough to make up for this.  This place is the opposite.  Their food here is good to decent--but they come with astronomical prices.  Their service is garbage--and they have no problem ripping you off and forcing you into an even bigger tab.  
You end up leaving this place feeling like you grossly overpaid for mediocre food, got subpar service, and were possibly ripped off by the lies that their staff tells.  Do not go here--do not waste your money and time. Vegas has far better dining options.",Cv0dv6cDvHE99fZ1thwADg,0,0,1,aFfkKnfGAOb0ImMBOe5F5A

Wow!  Very strange and awesome all at the same time.  Food and service was top notch.  Mr.  Chow I am a life long fan now and will be back the next time I am in Las Vegas.  Prices ran about $150 a person including drinks; lots of drinks.

We visited on Valentine's Day, though it was not busy at all. Perhaps because it was early (we were going to a show later). Dinner was a prix fixe for $95 per person (we were notified of this two days before, not at the time of the reservation). 

The food was not 'bad' but generally just lacked flavor. For appetizers we had Glazed Walnut Prawns and Squab with Lettuce (literally chicken lettuce wraps since it is apparently made with chicken). Entrees were Black Pepper Lobster and Velvet Chicken and were served with Pineapple Fried Rice (not sure there was actually pineapple in it or that it was fried) and Exotic Mushrooms (a mix of shiitake and king oyster mushrooms, some of which seemed under cooked). Chef's Choice desserts tasted like they came out of a box.

2966005,2017-01-04,13,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"January 1st...our first dinner of the new year with good friends at Mr. Chow?...well...that didn't really have me excited after reading all those 2-3 stars reviews, but I was hopeful, cheerful, and ever-present to the moment at hand.

White walls and a white ceiling frame the huge white object hanging overhead...that's the UFO everyone is talking about...I was told that Mr. Chow is quite the art enthusiastist and had this piece commissioned to entertain his guests...this piece that opens up from time to time with all different lights filling the white canvas.  

Six of us opted for the Beijing Duck ($78 per person w/ min. 3 guests) from their Semi Prix Fixe...it is a three course dinner with table side carving of the roasted Beijing Duck. We choose to pick four first course items: Lobster Shumai, Shanghai Little Dragon, Salt & Pepper Prawns, and Mr. Chow Spareribs and four ""of course"" items: Steamed Sea Bass, Green Prawns, Fiery Beef, and Duck...also we ordered Sautéed Baby Bok Choy, Mixed Vegetables, and Shrimp Fried Rice by request. 

One of our friends loves Peking Duck...I am not a Duck lover and it wasn't the best I have had...but table side carving made a scene for us to enjoy. All the dishes I had were good but not the best...service was excellent...as if there are more servers than patrons, which shows their efforts to be attentive in every way.

To get to Mr. Chow was rather stressful for me because of the smoky air throughout the rather long walk through the casino...walking back after dinner provided more of the same. Needless to say, at the end of the evening, I smelt like I had chain-smoked my way through a package of cigarettes.  

Would I go back on an invitation of good friends?...yes, would I pick up the phone and make a reservation for myself?...no.

Now I can say I've been to Mr. Chow, which is clearly loved by lots of people...as evidenced by the packed tables and crowds waiting to be seated in the lounge. In conclusion, it was a great way to start 2017...amazing friends...my true love...and Mr. Chow. What else can a girl ask for?

When we walked in we were promptly seated it seemed like there was something happening among the staff, there were maybe a total of 7-8 tables of people and our waiter said that's were very busy which idk for a Vegas restaurant I don't consider that busy. He informed us everything is family style and portions are sized for the group. There were 4 of us. We ordered 2 corn crab soups (more watery than creamy but I think that's a preference thing) the spareribs and shrimp  for apps, which where the best things we ate but really still nothing spectacular. For entrees we ordered the sweet potato pork and the oyster beef which truthfully out of the 4 of us no one liked, the flavor was blah and the portions were no where near enough for 4 people when the waiter checked in we said the portions were very small to be considered family style as they had previously let us know they would be big enough to satisfy. He said we should have done the prefixed dinners but that's why we asked when we ordered if what we ordered was enough for 4 people. The fried rice was also bland and we asked for soy sauce, and were told we wouldn't need it because it would contrast with the seasonings in the fried rice, although it was brought the waiter was dead wrong it needed the soy sauce and more!!!!! The manager then came to check in and truthfully I have never complained about a restaurant before but I had to say the truth this is the worst restaurant I have been to in Vegas and the food was not good and  I told him the food/experience was much better at TAO. He suggested we have the dessert as that might be more our style, but no I'm sorry there was no way I was ordering anything else. We never care about prices if the quality and service are good but that is not the case here I would take your money else where since there are so many options in Vegas this one is NOT worth it.

3045966,2018-05-19,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"I came here with my friend last Saturday right after her graduation just before our dinner resevation. She's been wanting to try their social hour (SH) for quite sometime now, but her undergrad semester didn't allow her to drink during the week nor the weekend because she's busy with other things. Once we were there she ordered Tribeca and Chow-lini right away. She was quite ecstatic! The staff were prompt and they were very friendly, (I know they're pretty busy during their SH, we came at a time before they got busy). In addition, we also ordered the mini spare ribs and prawn toast, both of which were really good. The spare ribs were seasoned well; and as a non-seafood lover she was able to persuade me to try the prawn toast which were pretty good! For the drinks, although both were very good, I preferred the Tribeca over the Chow-lini. I wish we had more time to try some of their other appetizers that they offered for SH but we were on a time constraint with our dinner reservation. 

For the restaurant itself, the interior design was pretty cool. SH is near the patios that overlook the pool. I liked the liquor display by the bar, as well as the kinetic sculpture that moved every 40 minutes (I think).

The SH special is any drinks $40 and below are half priced, while the MR. CHOW SH appetizers start at $5. For the price and experience, I think that's extremely wonderful considering that the restaurant is located IN Caesars Palace. The location itself is across Pronto by the convention center NEAR the Bacchanal buffet. I find it hilarious when people complain about the difficulties of finding a place just like this one. Rather than complaining, it's called ASKING the staffs or security guards AT Caesars where the restaurant is located... better yet, CALL the location that way they can direct you. 

Just a precaution, MR.CHOW here does close SUNDAYs and MONDAYs. Social hour is on a first come, first served basis, no need for reservation just let the staff know at the beginning once you get off their elavator. Lastly, SH is Tues-Sat 5 to 7pm, unless they have an event then call ahead of time.

Overall, the atmosphere was just right, the workers were welcoming, and the price for the food & drinks were great.",K6mDtbNLN9k0jT_iGfAUig,1,0,5,EOvw218BYjeMXs8QUa7rAQ

Although the quality of food was good, the flavorings and taste was boring.  They give a chili sauce that wasn't spicy, the sautéed rice was just plain rice with shrimp, and the fiery steak was like sweet and sour sauce which took away from the steak flavor.

My first experience at Mr. Chow's was the Beverly Hills location. I remember I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, food, and service there.

This experience was not as pleasing. We took a reservation for dinner around 8:30pm the same day. (It seemed that this place was not as busy as places like Nobu which was booked till the next day; which to me, esp on a three day weekend, shows that maybe it's not as good). 

We show up and take the elevator up. We are shortly seated in a bluish lit circular room. From the get go they offer bottled or tap water ... Then the champagne cart shows up with a man dressed all white and fancy. It's nice to offer these finer things that cost $$$$$ but when it feels like they're trying to upsell u on everything it gets annoying quickly and feels unclassy.

Our waiter showed up with an accent and couldn't properly explain the whole process with their menu. It's actually quite complicated. She urges us to get the pre fixed option and says she HAS to order two of the same thing from the bottom category if we don't get the pre fixed option... Like, what does that even mean and why?  

We end up getting the pre fixed which includes two appetizers, two entrees, and two sides. The price of the pre fixed goes up and up and up depending on what entree u choose which is bull.

Finally our food comes out but it doesn't get to my table till 15 mins later. I see the servers struggling to organize and accomplish their tasks in front of me. One grabs my appetizer the other takes it and sets it down, the other attempts to come to the table then drops the spoon... He sets the dish down and disappears for 5 mins. Finally someone else delivers it.. Wow... It got cold very fast.

The servers seem to have an facade of properness and high class but fail to simply provide decent service.

I'm guessing everyone is new to their jobs here.

The food was just okay. I always enjoy the mr chow noodles and dumplings... Everything else was just okay. The black cod was too buttery, the prawns were overly sauced, the fried rice was kind of mushy.. The baby bok choy was good but it's hard to mess that up.

We finished, asked for take out boxes for all the food that was leftover, and left. 

Prob won't be back to this location. The Beverly hills location has better service and ambience... Maybe even better food.",-giB3-IKDRWnO5kRwYWOjw,2,0,3,H951rMjAm6mE033XaSVeWw

However, this was my 2nd time to this new location at Caesars Palace & it was worst experience then the 1st time. My expectations for a $$$$ restaurant wasn't even close to being met. Took 20 minutes to get a glass of water and our main course didn't come til 50 minutes after we ordered. Needless to say, the service was beyond terrible. I will go ahead and give this location one more try, if they let me down again, I have no choice but to visit my favorite location in Beverly Hills. 

This all happened on Valentine's Night. I had to leave my girlfriend with my brother & his wife because I had to be at work. I gave them 90 mins and they couldn't even deliver. SMH

Being a Vegas local for 15 years and dining at some of the finest spots has me 2nd guessing this location.

At the end when the bill came we all chipped in our credit cards and the waitress bought our card back and all individual card amount was much more than the original bill - there were 3 baileys and one cheesecake added to the bill ($125).  We questioned the bill and waited for close to an hour for them to fix it. They gave us a break on our drinks.

The Good:

A1 treatment with the customer service. From the moment we took the elevators to the restaurant lobby it was chic and had a luxurious feel. The hostess was pleasant and as we walked to our table I had all the feels that we would have a great night. Just us ladies having a girls night out. They had a very diverse staff, each of which put a smile on our faces throughout the night. The art installation that was directly above us kept us in awe. Every 30 minutes it would come down captivating us so much so that we would stop eating to gaze at it. Loved it! The atmosphere and staff made me love the place very much. 

The Bad: 

The food did not live up to my expectations. It is a very pricey place to have dinner so I was certainly expecting more. The food- specifically the velvet chicken was not aesthetically pleasing so it instantly made me question how tasty it would be. I was right, it just wasn't good. We also had the Mr. Chow noodles, duck, salt and pepper prawns, and vegetables. All were ok but again I was not as impressed with the food as I was with the service and ambiance. 

I can't say that I would go back but glad I had a experience the place. My palette is a little simpler when it comes to food so I encourage people to explore this place for themselves.",YoEVFNNxnsMaylIExsMhjA,1,3,3,eL010Myny6y6ul0S_mMeZw

Bar staff was excellent...I forget the gentleman's name that helped us the most but he was very nice and helpful. Drink prices are a little high but comparable to hotel prices but bottle prices are very good!!
As we waited for the rest of our party to arrive we were asked by the host to look at the menu and place are order.... They explained they did this for large parties so there wasn't too much food and when we got to the table we could relax. While I appreciate that, I wish I was told that when we confirmed the reservation so I could have sent everyone the menu via email.
It was a mess and I was stressed on picking dinner for 10 and 2 of which had shellfish allergies.
What ever bring us the prefix duck menu!! 
As we sat down in the gorgeous dining room we were greeted by several staff members but only a couple of them friendly. In fact when I explained to the ""captain"" how stressful picking the menu for everyone was he replied ""you'll be ok"". Really!!!! I'll be ok....how rude!!!
We made it through our meal ( the food was very good) but drink service was slow. By the time the dessert for my husband came, we were fed up with the staff, paid the $1600 bill and went to another bar in the hotel.

We ordered the middle prix fine meal as we were 2 people. We obviously wanted the Peking duck but no luck unless you're 3 people. This was very disappointing as this was the main reason I wanted to try Mr. Chow. On a side note, they really need to add a duck appetizer so I can try it or offer to 2 people. Instead we went with the beef pancakes, soup noodles, fiery beef, and velvet chicken , all accompanied with rice and mixed vegetables. The 2 memorable dishes were the fiery beef and soup dumplings. The beef was simply fantastic with just the right amount of spice and flavor. The soup dumplings were some of the best I've had and don't burn your mouth like many others. The velvet chicken was good but pretty bland in flavor. The beef pancake is a hard pass and the veggies were good but just Chinese veggies. Portions were unexpectedly filling and we even had some leftovers. The alcohol list was a real disappointment as they only had a few reds by the glass affordable and 1 rose. No beer and only a few cocktails, of which their old fashioned was way too sweet and low in alcohol content.  They specialize in champagne here but still they need to add to their liquor listing. 

Mr. Chow may be a top of the line Chinese establishment elsewhere but I don't think this location reached any heights. Very Americanized with no chopsticks unless upon request, but then very gimmicky with laminated menus. Unless someone else is buying, I won't be back. I do want to try the Peking duck, and that may have changed my mind on the overall meal, but their rules are rules.

As a vegas local and my wife being in the concierge industry who frequently makes reservations for this restaurant we now have the worse feedback to give about the restaurant! not even an apology for a hair in our crispy beef, just a laugh, and nothing was taken off the bill. when I called today to get a name and number of a manager they said they couldnt give that out via phone. seriously? you want me to go in person and ask for it and share my two cents? because I will.I highly suggest someone at Mr. Chow reaches out to me.",mNA2VoonqHolS1Bj-c8_9Q,0,0,1,vzTCAgA5RU8E51A4HuZRGA

I went with a mainland Chinese friend of mine who has taken me to many chinese restaurants and this is definitely not Chinese style...They say they are Beijing style...less spicey...more refined...i think that is just an excuse for ""we americanized the heck out of it"". So if you want chinese pass.   Even for americanized chinese this was blah.  And when you consider $70 per head....no way..Just bland blah food served with fantastic waitstaff and ambiance...If you are getting a casino comp sure go ahead...but paying yourself?  Do yourself a favor and go to a real chinese restaurant or a real american one.

Quick rundown, it's from 5-7pm (forgot to check if it's every day) and is first come first serve seating at the bar (maybe fits 30 people if limited to indoors). They have a small bites menu with plates ranging from $5-$9 each and every drink under $40 is half off. 

This place was awesome! Out of the small bites, favorites were the petit chicken satay, shrimp rolls, and glazed prawns. The chicken satay (2 skewers) came with a hint of peanut sauce but it was mostly just buttery and creamy and delicious. The shrimp rolls (3 rolls) were straight up pieces of shrimp wrapped in crispy egg roll dough, served with their house spicy chili sauce and a tart dipping sauce. The glazed prawns (a small plate worth) were like a large shrimp size and sweet without being too sugary, served with glazed walnuts as well. Really liked the chili sauce and really liked these small bites. The amount we got per plate felt really good for the prices. 

For drinks, we tried the Tribeca and i got the Chow-lini. Both have champagne and peach. The Tribeca has additional fresh pineapple juice too. Friends were a fan of the Tribeca, and it definitely tasted fresh. I was a huge fan of the Chow-lini because it has an egg white and peach whipped foam on top. And who doesn't like a good twist on a Bellini? Super delicious. Great views of the pools at Casaers Palace. 

AND the ceiling does a little show every 30 minutes! It looks like a space ship or a jelly fish and took us by surprise! Super cool. Best happy hour I've been to on the strip.",8ahrzebmEdp8NASJom9Izw,2,1,5,3mwCCMdm4Z2avq4QhGF-TQ

Rice :  half cooked.  We spoke to the waiter about this.  He said that is how the rice is always cooked.  Okay........ gross.  

The food spicing was bland, subpar, and there is an over reliance upon fried foods. Sauces where overstarched, and thickness was nauseating.   Who eats this stuff?

In our one hour at this restaurant we literally had 30 encounters with various staff members interrupting us every single time we spoke. Within a three minute. We had five people come up to us asking us if we'd like cocktails.  Our table felt like it was put in Grand Central Station. Either a staff member or a patron was hitting the back of each of our chairs every two minutes. 

I had to come to this restaurant due to the recommendations of Howard stern and Jimmy Kimmel however I can say I've been here and won't be back. Three of us ate here and spent $360 for two cocktails a piece dinner for three and one dessert that we all shared. I can eat at my favorite Chinese restaurant in Detroit called Young's 14 times for $360.

Setting is beautiful, white, modern and romantic.  We were at Cesar's to catch the Mariah Carey show and decided to try Mr Chow.  We were first approached by the champagne cart guy, nice but talked too much the whole time.  Like others have said there is a lot of interrupting that goes on by all the service folks, kinda exhausting.  Anyway the food is just ok nothing spectacular and considering the price it was a bit on the disappointing side.
We ordered the prixe fix option, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and sides.
Ribs and walnut prawns to begin:  both were a good portion and tasty (the chili sauce is great too)
Dungeness crab, filet mignon for mains:  so the crab was very weird and not good, its crab meat mixed with egg whites and no flavor at all.  The filet was just ok, needed more sauce or salt or something.
String beans in XO sauce, Bok Choy and brown rice with mushrooms: the string beans were excellent, the bok choy was overcooked and the brown rice was meh.  
Overall most dishes lacked flavor I would order the string beans and walnut prawns again.  Stay away from the crab not worth the upcharge or room in your stomach, bleh.  Drinks are steep too $20 each and if you opt for a glass of champagne that can run you $40-$80!

While the food was good, the menu lacks flexibility, the Peking duck is not served traditionally, and the service in general was not great - all of which are inexcusable given the price point. The only truly redeeming quality is that the Peking duck was served with pancakes (which I prefer over steamed buns).

Why is the Peking duck only available as part of a full-table 2-course meal at $74pp?? There were three of us, so we had to get three appetizers in addition to two other mains (the duck counts as one of the mains). I would rather have gone à la carte and ordered more mains. I was also surprised they don't offer any other Peking duck courses. No lettuce wraps, not even a simple sauté.

Also, our waiter kept insisting on picking the menu instead of us choosing. I really hated that; it was super pushy and made us feel uncomfortable. Either make it a set menu without choices, or let us do the choosing!

Peking duck was tableside service but not cut traditionally; only a few pieces were done skin-only, with the vast majority being just a bit of skin and tons of meat. At the price they're asking, it's totally inexcusable.

And portion sizes were tiny. Sea bass was four small cuts; the lamb entrée came on a dish that was the size of one of my hands. I don't factor value much into my ratings, but for $222 it's impossible not to expect way more.

Service-wise, we had multiple waiters and busboys - which normally wouldn't be a bad thing except they were completely uncoordinated, so they would bother us over and over again about the same things. For example at least 4 different staff asked us if we wanted another bottle of wine, but we had already ordered with the first person who asked us. Repeat the above for if we were ready to order, if we're ready for mains, if we want fresh sharing plates, etc. etc.  It just got old.

Finally - not a fan of the lighting changes and the moving ceiling sculpture thingy. It was distracting and definitely detracted from the overall experience.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,8,1,2,gJFsNc5dTybrO6v-ELj-3w

I really wanted to do either the Peking Duck or the Whole Fish, but both required a 3 person minimum - we settled for Red Snapper and the Gambler's Duck. I was still excited.  Our appetizer, the lobster dumpling was below average...as was the red snapper was average at best, needing some spice... and unfortunately, the duck (my favorite...I have it in almost every Chinese restaurant I go) was overcooked, dry and boring.  There were too few garnishes to go on the wrappers - so nothing could be done to give it taste.  In the end, the duck killed the evening and nothing could bring the night back to my expectations.  Mr. Chow needs to come up with a 2 person Peking Duck (I saw one go by and it looked good) meal and take the Gambler's duck off the menu.",6ayl_PaXDaoBKhaIevkMgA,2,0,2,KNsgc-f6AbynbMJmKxi2og

3968432,2016-01-08,27,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"I wanted to try this new restaurant before going to see Celine.  I arrived five minutes early and shortly the hostess on the first floor called an elevator for me and I went to the second floor where Mr. Chow is located.  A maître d' came out and introduced himself and said I would be seated shorty. The staff was going through its kung fu before starting service.  Check my photo for this definition of kung fu.  It has nothing to do with marshall arts.

In a minute or so, a familiar face appeared at the hostess stand--it was Mr. Chow.  He asked my name and the name of the woman who had arrived shortly after me.  He took the two of us into the restaurant and introduced us to the entire staff.  The staff then finished with a countdown after Mr. Chow asked them if they were going to give us the best service there was.  I'm paraphrasing.  I was taken to my seat and menus were placed and I was asked about water and drinks.  Tap and iced tea.  Standard for me.  It was about then that the kinetic sculpture descended and starting going through its 5 minute show.  Quite interesting and innovative.

My server was a bit concerned about me dining alone as there plates are meant to be shared and maybe I should have a few apps and sort of do it like a taps place (my words).  That wasn't why I was there.  I studied the menu and picked out three items.  He had suggested a double order of chicken satay, but I decided on a single order--which consists of one satay--and I ordered the turnip puffs.  I also ordered the With Three dish.  It should be noted there is a $40 minimum charge per person.  Not to worry, this threshold is very easy to surpass.

After my water and iced tea were brought, a runner came with Mr. Chow's homemade hot sauce.  Shortly, another runner brought the chicken satay and a very hot share plate with the Mr. Chow name on it.  The chicken satay was a bit disappointing.  The sauce on it didn't flavor it all that much and it was a standard chicken satay.

My second course was the turnip puffs.  There were six in the order and the pastry was done nicely.  I did use some of the hot sauce with these and the hot sauce rescued the puffs from tasteless oblivion.  This made the experience so far at 0 for 2.

The main course was brought.  The With Three consists of prawns, chicken, calves liver and sea mushroom sautéed in wine (quoting from the menu).  The sea mushroom was outstanding!  I think there was one prawn with much chicken and some calves liver.  This was really a different dish and that's what struck me as I was looking through the menu.  Unless you eat like a super model--or maybe I eat too much--this was not a dish to be shared unless a couple is ordering several dishes and tasting a little of each.  For one person, it's not hard to render the plate empty.

After the table was cleared, a woman came pushing the dessert trolley through.  Lychee, carrot cake, rummed oranges, I believe, a triple chocolate cake, and some others.  I got the triple chocolate cake and it was the winner of the evening.

Service was excellent almost to the point of being overdone--patronizingly so.  Everyone is very pleasant.  They haven;'t had their grand  opening yet, I was told, and they'll have no problem with it.  This staff knows its stuff pretty well.  There were a few mistakes in the menu in my case but nothing terrible.

Spending the amount I did, I would have hoped I left with more positive thoughts about the dining experience.  Instead, I'll remember three important words--Spring Mountain Road.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,46,20,2,epEvgNiLJigdDVY9OvaNlw

Appetizers:  We had 3 starters and the Shrimp and Walnuts, best thing we ate.  The spareribs, they were good but nothing special. Mr Chows noodles were 3rd and we all thought they were ok, I found them pretty bland and underwhelming.

Main Courses:  The 3 main courses did not improve things.  The fiery beef was good, but no one got that excited.  We had the card in the egg whites, it was fine but also lacked anything compelling.  We finished with the Duck.  It was fine, the service related to it was neat, but it was not so good that it should be on your bucket list.

Service:  This was very, very odd and largely good.  The people we met were all very good, top quality type folks.  At said, we did have some stretches where we weren't checked on, so it could have been better.

Location:  It's pretty nice, although I am not sure what the benefit of being so high up when there are so few views.  It's got a cool decor inside, though, we liked it.  This part lived up to the billing of a top restaurant.

It's called blind faith and this is where to embrace it.  

We had a fried chicken dish and it wasn't the thick beer batter type of coating that you normally are used to from panda garden.  This was light airy and perfect.  I mean they make their noodles by hand daily.  While expensive at about $100 per person with only 1 drink each it was truly worth it.

Anyone that is in the scene knows about Mr. Chow = super upscale Chinese food.  Cuisine from Beijing, to be exact.

Before even coming here, I had my doubts.  I'm Asian.  I know that good and authentic Asian food can be had for super cheap.  I mean, just go to Chinatown and you'll see.  The most upscale restaurant there will give you a spectacular Szechwan beef for like $18.

Can I really justify paying $50 for a Chinese entree?  After this experience? ...........no.

Look, the place is nice.  Looks like Miami, cool art installation on the ceiling.  Music from JLO and the Chainsmokers piping in.  Waiters have their canned quips at the ready to keep things lively.  Check.

I just can't justify that much of a premium for this kind of food.  $8 for one skewer of chicken satay.  They are like $2 each at any other Thai place, but these aren't 300% better.

I guess go here if you are on a date, and your girl wants to look hot in her short dress draped against the white couches, but I brought my mom, and she was like, yo what did you just spend $300 on, you moron????

It's just like bottle service.  You're buying $30 of vodka, and $470 of ambiance, but if you don't really want the ambiance, then skip it.

Luckily, I ate for free so I guess price wasn't THAT big of a deal, but I'm speaking from the perspective of if I had paid for what I ate.

The atmosphere is fantastic! They do a whole art installation during dinner where the ceiling opens up and is bathed in various colored lights and the pieces of the ceiling move around into different positions. That was very cool to see.

The food, however, not as cool. I guess I'm a bit biased because I don't like take-out chinese food. Like, at all. It's just not my thing. So, when everything that we ate was basically glorified take-out food, I was just not a huge fan. I guess I was expecting some sort of luxury Chinese food as part of the fine dining experience, like maybe things I had never tried before, but it really was stuff that you could order from your neighborhood Chinese place and pay a fraction of the price. 

The walnut shrimp was good, but it's walnut shrimp. The dumplings were good, but they're dumplings. The noodles were good, but they're noodles. The duck was good, I guess, but I mostly tasted the, pardon my ""American"" here as I'm not sure on the correct terminology, 'tortilla' it was wrapped in. The fried rice wasn't very flavorful.

The prawns were gigantic and succulent but needed more seasoning. The noodles had good texture but also not seasoned well. I liked the chili sauce but felt like my apps lost themselves in the sauce since they needed lots of sauce for flavour. The lobster was so delicious! I loved the flavours and seasonings. The ginger sea bass was good but over cooked. The mixed veggies were basic. While the mushroom rice was tasty. Sadly the crème brûlée was underwhelming and the sugar top wasn't flambéed enough.  

The space is all white and I liked the ceiling art but the music was a bit loud for date conversation. I also found it very overwhelming and hard to relax having prep stations in the focal point of the room. I did not understand the noodle pulling demo as it seemed a bit conceited and interrupting. The chairs were uncomfortable and no leg space under the table made it hard for me and my date.

I was welcomed by sparkling champagne, greeted by two elegant yet friendly hosts, and entered a mysterious elevator that brought my boyfriend and I to the dining room. As we enter another spotless white room, a woman takes our coats and offers us a spot in the ""lounge"" or bar, while our reserved table is prepared. After gazing at some of the most expensive champagne bottles in the world, it's crystal clear this restaurant caters to the rich and famous.

The outstanding service was memorable, and by far the best I've ever experienced. The manager and waiter constantly checked on our table going above and beyond to make sure all our expectations were met. Every time someone in the restaurant stood up, someone would simultaneously come around and fold their napkin carefully on their chair. Clearly, the service was impressive, but the restaurant lacked warmth and seemed to be missing something.

Now let's fast forward to the shows - if you can even call them that. The first show involved a blue light transforming the restaurants color as a kinetic sculpture on the ceiling slowly shifted positions. This goes on for maybe five minutes, but really, there was nothing interesting about it. Another show involved a chef coming out and ringing a very loud bell to grab the attention of all customers. This is the noodle show, as you can watch the chef create a popular noodle dish from scratch while you're at your table. I happened to order the noodle dish, and let's just say it was disappointing. The noodles lacked flavor and were such a tasteless bore! I'd rather skip the show and order a chow mein (but no, there's no chow mein on the menu). Other ""shows"" include the champagne trolley and dessert trolley. I'm not sure why they call this a show, as it's just a cart that comes around trying to get you to empty your wallet on more overpriced items.

Now I understand people are paying for the superior experience, and therefore, I really can't base my rating off of prices. If you can't afford it, then you shouldn't go in the first place. Just be warned that portions are small, and the food is bland.

Although all other waitstaff was attentive and friendly...our head waiter was not.  In fact he was very rude. He made my dinner guest noticeably uncomfortable because he was so snotty.  I was actually shocked I have never had a bad experience at a vegas restaurant.  Usually service is top notch so this was very disappointing.  (Not the point but the servers eyebrows were really noticeably weird too.). 

Anyway after the poor interaction the staff tried to make up for it but there was just no coming back.  I appreciate the effort but it was just done at that point.

The atmosphere is very upscale and when you have read that they have a dress code you expect a certain caliber of clientele and experience.  Friday night, first day of the new year - we were dressed for a night out.  Guess the guy in shorts to the right, and teeshirt wearing hipster to the left didn't get the memo.  

The service was impeccable and we were always taken care of.  It isn't their fault that the kitchen told them twice that the dish they were bringing was vegetarian, only to have me bite into it and to find meaty centers.   

The food was good, not great.  We had the noodles that they are renown for (vegetarian style), veggie potstickers and meat potstickers got the appetizer.  They fiasco with vegetarian vs meat was felt here and they didn't actually get my veggie potsticker out till dessert time.  Pale comparison to the meat ones jic that is an option for you.  

The Beijing chicken David got was ""good flavor but not particularly strong."" The only vegetarian entree was pretty good - these tofu croquettes in spicy sauce with glass noodles.  And the mushroom side was good.  

I also had a lychee martini and we were too full for dessert.   Wouldn't go back, but glad we went.  They need to either step up their game to earn more stars, or relax expectations.",qVi3oaIQGc912eeu4ZiU3g,3,0,3,NTSIZVR49ehKrXAV21SRNw

4787826,2016-02-15,3,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"To start off, it's not very easy to find.  We had to ask 3 different employees, one of whom gave us 100% wrong directions.

Once we found it we checked in.  We were a tad early for our reservations & we were waiting on our other guests.  We took the elevator up, and the hostess asked if we would like to be shown to the bar or wait in the lounge area across from her desk.  We opted for the ""lounge area."" It wasn't pretty.  It looks VERY after thought.  The seating groups are in the middle of a dark hallway across from the party room.  I honestly think someone ran out to IKEA and grabbed some furniture for this area.  It did not match the other decor, and was just really misplaced.  The decor itself is what it is.  White on white, with a sculpture that moves from the ceiling during you meal.  When it would do that it would flash the lights in the room from whitish LED to this blue hue. The transition of the lighting needs work.  It is just like someone flicks a light switch on in an dark room.  It's just jarring.  I mean my 80 Philips hue system does an infinity better job then this presentation.  With it being a newer restaurant I would have expected a smoother more modern performance.  

The wait staff all seem to sport a different version of institutional uniforms.  Some near jackets, some bow tie.  But just white and hospital orderly.  Also some of the uniforms were ill fitting, I mean super ill fitting, like if they inhaled the button would pop off the suite jacket. This is  something I really did not understand for a Vegas restaurant.

When we were seated the waiter came over and introduced him and his ""team"" of people.  He gave us the menu and described the prix course, v. individual ordering.  He moved on then the person taking drink orders came over with the champagne trolley.  None of us wanted any and she moved on.  We then had to ask another person on the ""team"" to take our drink order.  She came back sometime after and asked about drinks, which we all ordered from the previous ""team member.""  

When it came to ordering we all wanted something different for both AP and main.  we advised that we could then order the pre-fix with how we were ordering and it would come out better in the end.  He did not quite say ""family style"" but that is what it turned out to be.  Of course everyone wanted what they ordered, so no REAL passing around happened, just an awkward experience.

The aps came out ok, another round of drinks were ordered, but this is where it all went to hell.  Out of the 4 of us 3 main came out together.  So then you get that, go ahead and start I'll catch up moment.  When the duck came that I ordered the ""team"" person spilled the sauce that was in a separate container all over my husband.  I mean ALL over.  Of course people ran over, but here he is in this stick plum and soy sauce coating.  The staff starts to clean him and the table up.  Of course they really do not have adequate equipment for cleaning so it comes to a bowl of warm water and lemon.  They then place a new napkin over the area of the table with the most sauce (the edge in front of him) and called it a day.  Through out the rest of the meal he kept finding more and more spots and had more water sent out.

The crazy thing is 1. They did not seat us at another clean table, of which there were plenty, and 2. Did not bring out a fresh order of the sauce spilled all over him.  Also in the midst of everything they took the cocktail I was drinking away.  While it was Ice, I still like to sip of the ice, especially when ordering more expensive Vegas cocktails.  They never asked me again if I wanted another.  Also with the duck nothing was really explained.  It was only after I had eaten did I find little tortilla type things that were to be used with the duck.  I thought the plate of them was some left over disaster.  

Another factor that bothered us, was that they were breaking down a temporary table.  So while our meal was going on they had this giant catering rental type tables just rolling along through the place.  I had no idea why they would have not waited until there were no clients still in there.

None of us opted for dessert at this point.  We were just ready to go.  The waiter comes by with the check and advised they took ""a round"" of drinks off the menu.  By which of the 5 drinks ordered they took off the two glasses of wine.  The cheapest of the 5 hard drinks ordered.  

I'll be honest when something REALLY bad goes down like what we had I would have thought Caesars/Mr. Chow would have deleted the bill. Or ask about getting clothes dry cleaned.  More was now going to be paid then the $20 taken off the bill for dry cleaning.   

I guess I should comment on the food.  It was ok.  It was a few days ago and I can not remember a single stand out during the meal.  

Save your money and skip this one.  You'd have a better time dumping the $400 into a slot machine then eating here.  The slot machine service is better.",s5OKosNZLjyvjXiTqNU7oA,6,4,1,kdSiMngAuIHkCFkgBNTY4w
4807100,2016-01-31,11,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"I was greatly disappointed by this place. I was excited to try this location because I had heard amazing things about the chain. 
 
What left a bad taste in my mouth? 
THE SERVICE. 
Apparently, Mr. Chow does some sort of tip sharing/service share with the staff here. All of our servers seemed like they were in a rush to get somewhere more important that our table and I felt unable to enjoy my dinner because of it. 

Reservation wasn't ready, no Problem. We spent about 20 minutes at the bar enjoying the bartender educated us on the Mr. Chow brand. He was very nice and made a great drink. I had a cable car which was great and my boyfriend had their lyche specialty martini which we both liked. 

Once we were seated, we were not offered menus or anything. Eventually, we were greeted by Matt who took our water service order, but didn't offer us additional adult beverages. About 10 minutes later he came back without the bottled water we had ordered. He left to go tell someone to get it. A different guy came back to pour it. Another 5-7 minutes went by, and a female blonde waitress came by. She said she was our captain and would be taking our order. We then tell her WE WERE NOT GIVEN MENUS. How the host, Matt, Matt's water assistant & now this girl seemed to ""help"" us without noticing we had NO MENUS is beyond me. But at this point, we were starving. 

We ordered a variety of apps and entrees. 
Fresh Scallop on the Shell (two of these) - Very Good! Presentation was great! 
Glazed Prawns with Walnuts - Amazing. Loved the flavors. 
Mr Chow Noodles - Just O-K. I liked the noodled but the meat flavor wasnt great. The staff must have thought we REALLY wanted another one, because they brought us two of these. I told them and they sent it back. 
Vermicelli with Lobster - Not a lot of lobster in this and I felt it was missing something that would make it stand out. Skip it. A staff member took it away while I was still eating it. He didn't say, ""may I take that?"" He just took it. 
Ma Mignon- Very tender and good. 
Fresh Live Lobster- Just O-K. I really needed a lobster fork, most of this we were unable to eat because of this. 
Chocolate Mouse Cake- I really loved this. Great size. 

A server took the Credit Card for the bill. During that time, another server brought us a bill and we had to explain that we had already paid someone else. The whole having 4-5 servers was not just confusing for us... It appeared like their staff wasn't meant to be working together as a team. 

Overall, I was left feeling like the Food was at least 4 stars compared to all the Vegas places I have dined at. The check was $300 + we tipped $60. We felt the need to let the server know that we were in the industry so tipping less than 20% wasn't going to happen; but the service sucked. 


Table Situation: We were sat at a two top where its a half booth/chair situation. I HATE these. I was on a date, It makes sharing apps less than easy and sitting across from your date isn't very romantic. It appeared that all the tables for small parties were like this.  

Let me know when this place switches the way the serve the guests and maybe I will come back and try it again. But until then, I wont be suggesting that you steer clear of this place.",qRYwodYPMMkl7QKnpmc39Q,20,20,2,tNnhTtwJPf9x1ZTqqCTdlw

I decided to take my wife somewhere special for her birthday and we selected Mr Chow. From the minute we got off the private elevator I knew we weren't in just an ordinary restaurant.  
Mr Chow has such style and ambiance that is almost unparalleled in Las Vegas.  After being escorted to the table, they didn't just pull chairs out to let us sit down. They lifted the entire table so that we could sit down, what a pleasant and unexpected action. The waiter who also happened to be a military brat like myself was superb. We found out that we had lived in some of the same places in Europe as children. 
We ordered off of the Semi Prix Fixe menu, we ordered the pot stickers and glazed prawns for starters. Both of these were great starters and the pot stickers melted in our mouths. 
For our main course we had the Ma Mignon, which was cooked perfectly and was quite tender. We also had the Dressed Dungeness Crab, which was quite delightful. At first I wasn't sure about the egg whites, but once I tasted it, the combination was amazing. We also had the string beans and steamed rice, which was served family style. 
To top it all off, they gave my wife a slice of coconut cake for her birthday. A very nice touch to end the evening.

Both dishes were average, not great, but definitely edible. After we ordered, our captain informed us that since we didnt order pre fixe, the entrees may come out at different time....ummmm.....at $40 a pop you probably could make an effort to bring them out at the same time.

The wine list is decent enough and you'll probably find something that's up your alley, but I would say it's on the lower end of the spectrum for a Strip restaurant.

Of the appetizers, my favorite was the prawn toast.  Crispy and prepared perfectly, it was probably the favorite of the table.  The dumplings were next, they had some fantastic broth and pork.  I wish we had ordered more of these, I think they came 8 or 9 to an order.  The Mr. Chow noodles were likewise strong, but didn't do as much for me as the toast and dumplings.

Of the entrees, the duck was the runaway winner.  As many other Yelpers note, it had fantastic crispy skin and was tender and moist.  I'd have to give it some thought, but probably a top 3 or 4 duck I've ever had.  The entire table loved it, we probably could have finished off another one had they brought it to us.

The drunken fish was poached in wine.  It was very moist, not close to being overcooked.  The seasoning was subtle, but there.  It was probably my least favorite, but again, it was a strong dish.  My second favorite entree was the ma mignon.  Cooked to a perfect medium rare, this was a very tender steak and I loved the sauce.  Were I to return I would definitely re-order the duck and steak.

The lamb is served on the bone and, like the duck, was moist and seasoned very well.

I have had better Chinese meals (Jasmine at Bellagio for example), but this was a very strong meal in a great atmosphere.  Service was fantastic too.  I would say the food is probably 4 stars but the ambiance, evening, and overall experience bumps it up to 5 stars.  Give this place a shot and ask to sit on the patio.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,3,5,qA1HIE1Wpn9BtinvAvDq5A

5011466,2016-06-05,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"Four stars is my split-the-difference rating for our March 29th dinner at Mr. Chow. The space/atmosphere was easily 5 stars on the relatively slow Tuesday night when we visited. Unlike so many restaurants at Caesar's, Mr. Chow feels miles removed from the casino floor. It's a bright, airy, smoke-free spot looking down on the pools. We arrived so that we could enjoy the view of the pools before dusk, then the restaurant's fun, funky lighting after. Both were immensely appealing.

The food was a solid 3, not because it was bad, but because, for less money, you could get the same quality elsewhere. I enjoyed everything we ate--quite a bit in fact--but it didn't leave me wowed in the same way that the atmosphere did.

We chose the prix fixe menu. For $66 per person, we each had one appetizer (beef pancake, glazed prawns); one entree (sea bass, fiery beef); and one side (fried rice, string beans). The prawns, sea bass, and string beans were my favorites. All were very very tasty. None were mind-blowing.

The Five Spices Old Fashioneds (made with Bulleit bourbon) were scrumptious--and $16 each. I nursed my first as long as I could, a feat that required clutching the glass quite tightly to keep the staff from snatching it away....Which brings me to the service: the staff were friendly, personable, and attentive (perhaps even a bit too much so).

I have hesitated to recommend Mr. Chow to out-of-town guests simply because of the prices vis-a-vis the food. Our dinner for two--the prix fixe menu; two drinks; and two desserts--cost $192 before tax & tip. Not a particularly high bill for a nice dinner mid-Strip, but high for what amounted simply to good Chinese food. We were definitely paying a premium for the ambiance.",nEABfoTu6n6qvLRD2_mX1w,2,0,4,_0ycNKFEmQ7u4_LqlDOfTA

The sides where green beans and fried shrimp rice. The rice was a little plain but with the mr.chows chili sauce they give you on the side it was fantastic.

Sorry for the late review. We had such a positive experience on our last trip, we just had to come back.

We were on a heater at Caesars and came a little late during their social hour. We still made it though. Sadly Tim was not there but Nery was tending that night.

We ordered Chicken Satay, Shrimp rolls, beef pancakes and mini ribs.
As always the food was awesome. The chicken melts in your mouth! The ribs are full of flavor and our favorite!

For drinks we had Red22 & Collins and 2 Chow Linis and my wife ordered up the Moet Champagne for $17.00. When she ordered the Moet, Nery noticed she was going to video the pour. He grabbed a new bottle, popped the cork and poured it right in front of her. This was awesome service!

We gave him a great tip, and thanked him for his amazing service!

5166062,2018-02-16,0,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"tl;dr - price is high, food is not good, service was meh. What fine dining. 

As an actual Chinese person, Mr Chow is definitely not somewhere I would go for Chinese food. On a Tuesday night, we came here with 6 people. We had someone who is allergic to gluten (which normal/authentic Chinese restaurant would not be a good idea).

The dishes family style (which probably the only Chinese thing about it), meaning everyone shares all the dishes. The waiter recommended us to do the prefix menu, which comes with 4 appetizers and 4 main courses. That what we ended up with. We had the lobster vermicelli noodles, lettuce wrap, walnut shrimp, soup dumplings as appetizers. We ordered Crispy beef, steam seabass, drunken duck(not the Peking duck), and velvet Chicken. 

The good: 
Soup dumpling: from a not authentic Chinese, their soup dumpling is actually really good. The skin is actually decently thin and there is a good amount of soup within the dumpling. 
Walnut shrimp was good too, nothing to complain about.
Velvet Chicken was good. 

The meh:
The lobster vermicelli has no a weird orange color to it which does not make sense. There was no lobster in there. The Hoisin sauce with the lettuce wrap and the duck was way too salty.  The duck came with pancakes to wrap eat with the duck. The pancakes were way to dry. It felt like it was tortillas that been sitting out for months. The Crispy beef had no actual beef. It was soooo deep fried that you cant tell it's meat. All you taste is the crispy flour that was fried.  
It came with white rice, veggie fried rice or shrimp fried rice. We ordered veggie fried rice. It literally veggie added to the white rice. I'm not sure if they know how to do a fried rice. 



Oh did I mention the price here is considered ""fine dinning""? I don't know what's ""fine dining"" about this place, besides its price. Waiters did not look like they were happy working here. Having a 2 million dollar artwork should not qualify you as fine dining. The portion was sooo small.


Overall, this place is definitely not recommended. I felt like I wasted my stomach space for that.",bEJXfISuhu_8VbQJNxRe3A,2,0,2,yhMpgiG08W8I29PXLkAY5g

Starting with service, there are a ton of suit dummies walking around this place yet the service was average. Server was friendly but we didn't get good vibes. 
My other problem was with the whole restaurant design. Ugly ass blue carpet in the middle. Looks like they spent a lot on renovating but it looked terribly overpaid for. Felt very tacky. 

Not to mention the fact that as we were escorted to our table the host stepped on and killed a cockroach nearby one of the VIP rooms beside one of their food carts- we should've just left right then but hey, we already paid for the Groupon.

The food was just nothing special at all, very bland. The ribs were ok but needed a lot of their hot sauce, not very tender. Shrimp with walnuts and a yum yum style sauce was heavy and meh. Ginger lobster needed more seasoning to bring out more flavor. Shrimp fried rice was so bland we laughed about how easy it is to make it better at home. Cheesecake was standard.

Overall would not recommend this place to anyone. It's overpriced crappy bland Chinese food. Felt like take out but we were served by tuxedos.

If they serve fried cockroaches on the menu that I was unaware of I will accept the fact that we saw a dead one on the way to our table.

Our main server was Kevin and he was assisted by Troy.  I hope I'm getting their names right!  I just know the second server was younger and bald, and when he could tell that we were having trouble deciding what to order, he was so helpful in helping us to decide.  We ended up going with the $66 per person pre-fixe menu, and I'm glad that we did because we got to sample a little bit of everything.  It came with two starters, two entrees, and two sides.  Btw if you want to see their menu and prices, you can find them on Eater Vegas, as I do not think they are on their website.

For starters, we chose their Glazed Prawns with Walnuts, which came highly recommended, and their Mr. Chow Noodles.  If you like the honey walnut prawns at your local hole-in-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant, then you'll probably like the Glazed Prawns here.  The Mr. Chow noodles were different, though not in a bad way.  My dining companion wasn't crazy about them, but surprisingly, I, the less adventurous foodie, thought the noodles were ok.  The noodles are described as being like spaghetti, which I agree is a fair comparison.  The entrees we chose were their Fiery Beef and Gambler's Duck.  The Fiery Beef was pretty tasty, but the duck was disappointing.  It came with really, really thin ""pancakes,"" and I'm talking extremely thin.  If anyone in the Sacramento area is reading this, the duck and buns at Frank Fat's is way better, which is all I can really compare it to as I don't really eat duck.  Come to think of it, I've had the duck salad at Hakkasan which I enjoyed more as well.  For sides we chose their Baby Bok Choy and Sautéed Rice (fried rice).  The Bok Choy was really good.  The rice wasn't bad, but I wish I had chosen their String Beans instead as the rice was too heavy for how full I was feeling.  The portions were definitely not as small as I was thinking they were going to be.

We were celebrating my dining companion's birthday and got a free dessert, which was a nice touch.  They brought their dessert cart out, and we went with their creme brûlée.  It was your average creme brûlée, not bad, not totally spectacular.  What I did find to be so great-tasting was their ice water.  Who knew water could be so tasty? :p

5519391,2016-09-29,1,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"Coming to a $$$$ Chinese restaurant on the Strip, I was definitely interested in checking out the taste of the food here. The entry-way was high-end and inviting, but not as a restaurant, more so as a jewelry store. It was a bit difficult to find the restaurant from the start, because you only see its entrance and once you enter, you have to take an elevator up to get to the restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is mostly white all around inside under a dome, from which hangs an installation as the wow-factor. The waitress provided us with menus, but was also extremely eager to let them pick-and-choose ""chef-recommended"" dishes for us instead, so we did that. 

Lobster shumai - not that great. I've had much better shumai at dim-sum. Pork chops - pretty good. Very tender and had a good flavor. Peking duck - not served the traditional way. The chef comes and slices pieces of the duck at the table, but they provide you with tortillas in place of folded buns, as would've been traditionally. Lychee martini - sounded good, tasted ordinary. Inception - better than the lychee martini. Had a couple of small dishes that weren't too great for me to remember the quality or experience of, and ordered a few plates of desserts at the end of the meal, and the best out of them was the coconut cake. 

My favorite thing about this place was perhaps the clean and simple interior, but in my opinion, not too suitable for a Chinese restaurant. The food was far from authentic, but I didn't quite expect it to be for its high price and the restaurant location. It was an interesting experience overall, but would not recommend it or come back.",Sl8weP49PZG2VeWqU2yf-g,5,1,2,y_7S86CKQ9ZdaMshg568ag

The server was very pushy and manipulative coercing us to order the $66 per person menu as the appetizers would come with the entree choices and the food would be more timely.  I explained that I was a pescatarian  and some of the dishes may not be conducive to my eating restrictions.  He of course guaranteed that they would  trade out the meat/ poultry allocation for additional vegetarian or fish. 
First courses dropped off with no explanation and the first 2-were meat!  Basically I waited another 15 min before they brought out something I could eat?
Check comes with the appetizers that he said came with the chef/set price which turned out to be $76 per person and we were charged for the first courses and vegetable dishes that were included??
Definitely would not recommend even though the food was actually very good!",zTEn0EyFQvkqoaD-V22fbw,1,0,1,5V8WWB4vmMOOy0Nehj0TEA

It's very noisy, so if you want a romantic place, not here. No menu - the ""Captain"" just starts bring you food after some basic questions about allergies. Food was spectacular and more than enough to satisfy everyone. Don't fret if you don't like one dish - more will appear soon.

Second visit:

Last review we gave them 5 stars. Loved it!!! 
About a month or so later this last Saturday took another couple with us about 9:30 PM. Had no reservations but were seated promptly by the staff. Our server came over and gave us a grand welcome and explained their menu which was driven by set of three core courses. We asked to order food ala Carter since all individual appetizer and food items have separate pricing on them. The server politely told us that we have to order from the three core menu items which included several main courses and several side items. We had picked all but two more side dishes when the server told us order more per policy otherwise we have to either leave or have him get an approval of his manager. This is when we met Patrice the French manager. When I told we were here about a month ago and had ordered ala Carter from the menu he told me very sarcastically that I had already use my one favor!!! We thought he was joking with us but nothing could be further from that when he asked us to bar lounge chairs to eat there. Yes he moved us with 4 great drinks into the bar where the table was at our knee level. Food arrived cold and late and then he showed up to serve our fish since we no longer had a server. The bar staff tried their best to get us plates and silverware and more drinks. 
We understand policy but I hope Mr Chow would give his managers enough common sense in a city FULL of wonderful restaurants not to move a party of 4 at about 10 PM into the bar to eat dinner when we were two silly sides from trifecta!! Now I hate to say what every unhappy Yelp reviewer says: you won't see us again Patrice and if Yelp allows I will post your picture so everyone would get to know you! Old Fashions were grand but food not so good since it sat in the no mans land before they figured it belonged to the losers in the bar! Btw our tab was over $300!

The filet mignon and chicken were ok only.  The service was slow.  When the main courses came one was missing and I had to remind the head waiter twice and when we got it was chewy and had it return to the kitchen.  

I was so looking forward for this dinner and so disappointed with the food and service.   I will never go back to this restaurant ever again.  I don't recommend this restaurant!  I would rate this 0 Star!",1WrUZ7Emixo3U0njBNymdQ,3,0,1,23-1Epvh1zDwXdPQp420Hg

You have to purchase a first and second course. I do enjoy Chinese food, but not at those prices. We decided to try a different place for dinner.

I booked reservations through OpenTable, but they honestly weren't needed as they weren't even at half capacity on a Saturday night. The restaurant is gorgeous and had lots of fresh flowers that filled the entire room with a wonderful scent.

Our waiter was informative and welcoming, but it took a really long time before anyone came to take our drink and food orders. I ordered the shrimp fried rice, chicken satay, walnut prawns and Beijing chicken. The walnut shrimp was good, but the tempura batter was a little soggy. Everything else was just ok and honestly for the price of the food, it should've been better. Also, the food came out lukewarm. It seems like it sat for awhile before they decided to bring the dishes out. 

For a restaurant of this caliber, the food and service just wasn't up to par. They put a lot of effort into the design of the space as it's absolutely beautiful, but more focus should go into the service and making sure food comes out hot.",DTFOGN81zlhrYENyvwQ79w,9,3,2,xAGKFyKmPs2nbhoKeSeGzQ

5939579,2016-11-27,7,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"oh boy where do I begin? 

This was one of the most ridiculous experiences I have ever had. The people who work there are so sweet and attentive so this is not about the service they provided, but rather about the show they're paid to deliver. 

Here is the whole story

Bear and I pass the front of the restaurant because it looked like a jewelry store. But I caught the name and while figuring out if Mr. Chows also sells diamonds, I got it. So we go up to hostess number one who ask how many, for our last name, and then points to the elevator for us to go up to the restaurant. She also tells us to tell them that we are the Chapman's when we're upstairs with a hand gesture like she was giving us a little mini lesson in how to act according to the fanciness of the place. 

Upstairs, hostess number two takes our name goes to get someone to walk us to our seats. 2 or 3 other people are waiting at the table. One of them pulls out the table for me to walk into the booth. The next person places the napkins in our laps and the third person leaves us with our menus. 

Then an other person approaches us with a large ice bowl on a cart and various champagnes which we awkwardly turned down for the cocktail menu.

Then the ceiling lights changed colors and something moved up and down and it was just silly...

Then our server comes and recommended a couple of dishes and took our orders. 

So the food was soooo underwhelming, I can't even find the words for it. It was good. But it had the exact flavor, texture and everything of Panda Express. We were actually joking at the table that perhaps they had an emergency in the kitchen and were forced to run over to Panda Express and fetch some takeout for us... 

Then the ceiling thing happened again... 

In the middle of dinner, someone came out with noodle dough and started slamming it on a table as he made the noodles in front of us. The slamming was very loud. And everytime he slammed he yelled out some karate thing and the waiters made some weird howlbark sounds and it was so silly. 

We ate our food, ordered our dessert to go, and got our left overs boxed up and ready to check out with the tickets they brought to our table together with a $250 bill. We picked up our stuff and said adieu. 

Again, this isn't a high class restaurant, but rather a high class theater act. The food is average, the ambiance is cold, minimalistic and spaceshippy... and the price is extremely ridiculous!",TG0bhYjtbRWrhZyqwpaW9A,11,4,2,uAP-X0s7O54bnnBIl8YKMA
5945972,2017-01-15,1,n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A,"I loved the food here so much I decided to come back twice in one week! I'm a local, so I have the luxury of doing that on a slow day so I picked a Tuesday. Came in and was seated right away and thought I would get excellent service from my meh experience last time, however it was worse.

Truthfully, the food here is phenomenal! Truly. It is some of the best fine dining Western Chinese food I've had. Even the left overs are good. No dessert should be left untried. This low scoring review is strictly front of house. 

I'm over paying $500+ and tipping $100+ for a meal here in town with very blah service. I had the same uncouth waiter as last week (the one who suggested how I tip) and he acted like it was the first time in his life he's ever seen us. I get it, I used to be a server in Vegas but you should AT LEAST always remember your seven stars, especially the ones that were here with you earlier in the week. That's part of the casino/player experience. Who cares though? I don't mind he didn't remember us but I am questioning how they ring up things at this restaurant. When you order a fried rice, they charge you for two portions even though you only want one. Just make the starting price at two portions then? Stupid but I can get over that too. Ordered two baileys and decaf and they were $40 (tax included). Yes, you read that right. Apparently, you get charged $12 for each baileys and then they charge you for the coffee as well which came out in small mug so it was mostly baileys. I wonder if you order a captain and coke if you have to pay for the captain and then also the coke? We used a players comp to pay for our meal but it could be considerate if they would at least inform us if you go over. That's common sense to me even though we don't mind paying the difference. It's the little things that make your consumer feel as if you're not getting robbed. To wrap it up, we had several complaints going on in a not so busy night and the manager couldn't be bothered to come over and address our table himself. Just playing telephone with the wait staff.
