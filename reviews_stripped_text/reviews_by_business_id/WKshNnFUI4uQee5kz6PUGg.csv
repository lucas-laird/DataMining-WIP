5 Stars - Veggie Quinoa burger was great. Do not like buns, so they put it in a spinach wrap for me. Had Jicama fries on the side (raw with seasoning sprinkled on) and those were great.

5 Stars - Thai Ginger Soup was very good.

1 Star - Chicken Satay was horrible. The chicken was so tough that I could not eat it and actually had to return it the next day (as I had already taken my food home and was not close by)

I would def return to this place as they have lots of wonderful choices but I think I would eat the food there, in case there were any issues.

Breakfast - real deal oatmeal (Irish steel cut oats, flax, cinnamon, sucant, & almond milk w/ bananas & raisins (335 cal)) - a good healthy portion of it. They don't skimp here. Even included half of a sliced banana

Lunch - Wellness drink (Green grapes, green apple, pineapple, orange, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed, agave (286 cal)) - Very tasty & refreshing
California Grilled Chicken (Turkey bacon, L,T,O, and extra virgin mayo (494 cal)) - the meat was tender & every bite was just as good as the last.

For their wraps they do offer a spinach wrap as an alternative. In additional you can just between a few options of fries.

1. Slow service. I ordered a salad and a wrap on two separate occasions at 3 in the afternoon (not busy) and it took upwards of 25minutes. That's excessive. 

2. Order accuracy. Out of my 4 orders, they have forgotten an item altogether twice and gave me the wrong smoothie a third time. 

3. No desire to make things right. When an establishment continues to make mistakes, a simple ""sorry"" doesn't cut it. They should be fixing their problems, and they obviously aren't.

Came to enjoy a nice meal with my family after a workout class. Took over an hour until we got all of our food and nothing was correct.

First, we were brought 1 salad (which was the wrong salad) and the server left before we could even let her know. It then sat on our table for 20 minutes, untouched until the server came back. We then watched the serve bring this same exact salad that already sat on our table to a table two tables away.

When we finally started getting more of the food which was 20 minutes after this, nothing came out at the same time. Everything we ordered came out incorrect. 
Salads, did not have dressing on the side, 
Ahi was terribly was over cooked, there were tomatoes when we asked three times for them not to be included on the wrap and then when the wrap was brought back again, it was evident that the tomatoes were just scraped out as there was still tomatoes in the wrap. They also forgot about the French toast, only the easiest thing on the freaking menu.

We asked for the manager to come out half way through this dilemma of everything not working correctly and we waited for over 40 minutes before we were even addressed.

Thai chicken peanut bowl- not good at all. They mixed up my order. I asked for no rice. My bowl had specs of rice; as if the cook forgot and took the chicken out of the rice and placed in the greens. My bowl also had some beef? Not sure how they store the meats..

Meaty potato soup was not bad, literally ground turkey, potato, and kale with cream

They got my husbands order all wrong and late. They forgot the buffalo sauce for the chicken the meat was bland, and they forgot the egg white add on.

Staff is friendly, and the inside is very colorful and nice at this location. Only issue can be parking during busy hours downtown. Their salads are the only thing I feel need to be revamped, both the flavor and prices are disappointing. The shakes aren't nutritionally balanced in my opinion either, but the flavor is good! Definitely a go to spot for those who want a healthy option when your looking for a quick bite.",xX1wftld9-ndtISAAihqng,0,0,4,oR3m2V9Yjn_ptfbyPSsjTA

Prices are reasonable, you get what you pay for, so if you want quality food, expect to pay a little bit more. Love this place!",pOGoWnHqeV_XkW1IEH0TsQ,2,2,5,xDBibCrMDHWwybIbJVRP2g
3834343,2017-07-17,0,WKshNnFUI4uQee5kz6PUGg,"I've been going to Greens and Proteins for years, but this location is by far my favorite one. Not only is the location clean, the customer service is always on point and the food somehow tastes fresher and more flavorful to me. During my most recent visit I came in around 12:30 with my laptop to get some work done. When I walked in I was immediately greeted with a warm welcome and I noticed there was only two others in the restaurant eating. When I went to order I made it fairly difficult on the cashier, I was looking for something pescatarian that was around 200 calories that was also gluten free. At most places, my needs are generally impossible. This employee (didn't get his name) gave me several options including customizing things on the menu. I ended up ordering their acai smoothie with a few changes. Before I even sat down and got settled... my order was called... it was fantastic. The smoothie was fantastic, the flavor and consistency was just right. I've had so many smoothies where it's too sweet or too healthy and this one was just right! I hung around for awhile sipping my smoothie and getting work done and before I knew it the place was packed! They definitely have a rush from around 12:30-2 for lunch but they seem to get items out fairly quickly. Since I was there longer than an hour I felt the need to order something additional. I decided to go with the ahi tostada but instead of a tortilla they placed it on a bed of lettuce. Let me tell you, if you are a fan of lettuce wraps and ahi, this dish will blow your mind! For a minute I forgot that I was eating at a fast casual restaurant. 

Long story short, if you are looking for a healthy and quick spot to grab food that has options for literally everyone, give Greens and Proteins a try.",9SiaKMfoX7hsWxqNd-CKaw,5,0,5,9q1Its7YqeG2VVYz73ibNw

The food here is of the highest quality and freshness . The chef is often the one who brings your food out to the table and shows great interest in how your experience is going. The staff is super personable which leads to an all around positive experience .  
  Chipotle is going to have to watch out for these folks once this franchise takes root .
  The only things that may need to be tweaked would be:  get rid of the little packets of condiments , as a customer I really hate fooling with them , they are time consuming and messy. There will also come a time when they may want to pare down the number of items on the menu , the number of choices is confusing and time consuming , new comers may find a hard time choosing , there is just too much on there.  Also , they may benefit  from having an array of their juices already made and in the display case for quick sales . It will also add a lot of color in the case and get the product in front of people's eyes to see and should greatly increase sales.  
 The photos of the food that are on the outside of the building and on various places inside give me the feeling that somebody's friend did the photography , the pics have an over exposed / washed out look that reminds me of family run Asian places , they may benefit  from having them redone with deeper , richer colors.   The photos are very important in that they help the customer make a decision without having to read the extensive menu so they should be the best they can be. No expense spared on this!

I went back and had yet ANOTHER terrible experience!!

The girl I was working with said she would go talk to her manager and get my fries out since I'd ordered them and she went to the back and never came out. I literally was astonished that she didn't even come back to check in. 

The first time I went to this business it was closed prior to door closing time and
when I went back to try AGAIN I had terrible customer service makes this a place not worth EVER going back to. 

If they can't treat their customers with even enough respect to walk back out to the table and tell me you weren't giving me fries that the menu said came with me meal and I ASKED for when I was ordering, then I'm not even sure why they are in business. 

I wasted money at this establishment. 
There's many other places to eat at whose employees care about treating their customers as customers.

Nothing exceptional in my opinion. Been here a few times and have enjoyed grabbing a smoothie. This time we came with friends to grab a quick bite.

 We shared the steak salad. Friends had the pancakes and an egg white Mediterranean scramble. Portion sizes seem to vary. The scramble was really small and sparse on the plate while the pancakes were huge and filling. Our steak salad was good, nothing amazing. We enjoy making delicious salads at home so we weren't incredibly impressed. Must have been about 3-4oz of steak which is not a lot for $14. 

Also, syrup for the pancakes were brought out in 3 separate plastic to-go containers with lids. Each container was barely filled. Seemed like a real waste of plastic for people dining in. Might as well just fill up one or put the syrup in a dish and save the environment and keep their costs down on plastic. Just a thought.
