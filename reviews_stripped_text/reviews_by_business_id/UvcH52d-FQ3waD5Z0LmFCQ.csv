Nowhere close to that. 

The Shoyu soup stock is beyond ordinary. Tastes like Swanson chicken broth with soy sauce added to it. The broth is probably better suited for udon noodles but for a Shoyu ramen, this is not it. 

The noodles were decent, though I like my noodles a little thicker. But at least these noodles are fresh, they don't seem to use prepackaged stuff.

The chashu that's in there is not very tender. A bit on the thin side as well. 

The ramen comes in a big plastic cup. It's like Cup o' Ramen. It's actually a cute idea. You can walk around with ramen in your hand. 

When I'm in Vegas, after a couple of nights of eating decadent heavy meals, a nice bowl of soup always hits the spot. Except this time.",zpTP5V_53AJyW4ITdi4nBg,0,0,2,t9iWIsF_5aNC6aFNhmxcjA

Unfortunately this time around, not so great. When you first walk in you'll see a register and sit down portion of the restaurant. We were told we could just sit down and order. Our server then came up to us before our food had come, told us our total, and asked if we were ready to pay before our food has even come. Like what? Other tables by us were able to order and didn't have to pay until they'd actually received their food. When we did go up to the cashier to pay they didn't even understand their payment system. We were each charged individually and then told we had a remainder left to pay and that it was tax? Our receipts have the tax printed on it?? Thankfully someone other than our server was able to explain that it was an error and that they'd waived the remainder.

Back to my review, the noodles and soup combinations were acceptable and very tasty but not authentic Japanese ramen.  In fact the egg noodles used has the same taste and texture as Chinese egg noodles used in wonton soup.  I found the miso broth a bit on the salty side.

1199271,2015-09-13,3,UvcH52d-FQ3waD5Z0LmFCQ,"I really have to change the light on this spot.  In terms of vegas pricing, this spot is very affordable. Ramen puts you out about $8-$9, versus the $17 other nearby asian joints selling ramen!

Please negate a previous reviewer commenting about the plastic cup. Any of these shops on the Grand Bazaar are going to be inclined towards a tourist, or someone else quickly passing through.  It makes no sense to serve ramen in a big ceramic bowl. Why use reusables, and bother with re-cleaning, when most people come in for a pit-stop and continue on? Silverware is more ideal if it offered full dinner service, and someone truly meant to sit and dine for an hour. I don't even think half the shops are connected to a water line, or have a sink.

There IS an eating area, but offers very little seating (only well suited for 2's or 4). But come on. You wouldn't come here for dinner. Or with a group.  It's a healthier, Asian, on-the-go. 

But the food was pretty good! It's flavorful. It hit the spot. Well balanced. Noodles cooked well. The pork was cooked well. I also got seaweed salad, which was good, and a melon soda. Altogether my meal was about $18.

Next time I'm in vegas, I'd definitely hit this place up again if I'm staying at Paris or Bally's. Ideal for lunch or a quick bite. The sushi looked pretty good, too. And that was priced about $6 a roll; also pretty reasonable.",qtrKHVDg-Vyq2bUGRHmi2w,9,5,4,Z4igzt1IlfeyH8dcURT3Fw

4 stars is for the fact that my spicy ramen was delicious, and what you would expect from a vendor in a shopping mall for a decent price. Keep in mind, I don't eat a whole lot of ramen and am probably easily pleased so if you are a ramen connoisseur take my review with a grain of salt. I thought the noodles were perfectly cooked and I watched them add the fresh ingredients at the end (little soggy by the time i got up to my room, but still delicious).

We ordered three burritos and they all came out sushi style. Sliced up in about 9 pieces.  It's not a big deal but we ordered that because we were expecting a burrito not 9 pieces.  We told them and the first thing they said was ""oh we sometimes serve it in half and sometimes in 9 pieces."" 

UHHHHH? why the hell are you advertising it as a burrito and then saying its sometime serves as a burrito or a sushi pieces. Who on earth decided that? Wasn't I the one who paid for the food that was advertise?

Ramen didn't sound like the best option for a sweaty day in Vegas, but it turns out they have sushi burritos! 

There are not many places to sit down if you wanted to dine in. The restaurant is narrow and they fit in two counters to sit at and some small tables. Of course, you can always take your order to go, but I don't know how well that would go over with ramen. 

I went for the SAPPORO ($9.77), which contains salmon, shrimp tempura, imitation crab, avocado, and lettuce. It came out pretty quickly, in what felt like 10 minutes or less. However, we were all surprised when the sushi burrito came out wrapped in a tortilla instead of nori. I've never seen a sushi burrito made like this, and while the tortilla was thin and didn't take away too much from the sushi, I wish I would have known. I asked later if you can sub nori instead of the tortilla and they said you could (but the option is not made known while ordering!). Overall it tasted alright, but nothing special. I was definitely very full after, and the price is good for the portion given.

I think this is a good choice for some economical Japanese eats while on The Strip, but it's nothing special. There are signs inside that say it got a Michelin recommendation, and I'd really like to know the backstory behind that.

Either that or commute to the local Chinatown and look for authentic flavors.

The shop is really tiny - a few counters with stools in the back.  We wanted a light snack so we ordered and shared the following:

Chicken Karaage - basically fried chicken, Japanese style.  Four pieces for $4 - good crispiness, good juicy and tender meat, and decent seasoning.  

Miso Spicy Ramen - For $9, its not too bad - chicken-based broth was spicy in a good way, and the few pieces of sliced pork were juicy.  They added quite a bit of kakiage, which is like tempura versions of thinly sliced onions.  Noodles were chewy.

It really is a small place with narrow counter top dining on stools which are set so close that you feel claustrophobic and if you're over 200 lbs, you'd better do take out because you will not fit into the narrow space.  

Hubby really enjoyed his ramen and even asked for double noodles. The noodles are the thin, egg type.  I thought my broth (miso) was too salty.

2009833,2017-05-01,2,UvcH52d-FQ3waD5Z0LmFCQ,"NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF RAMEN THIS WAS TRYING TO BE
(Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) I craved Ramen- even a packet version- but before resolving to that I was glad to find there was a casual Ramen place on the Strip. It seemed legit- a small business buried among dozens of other small shops- just like how it is in Japan! Except everything else was wrong...

THE FLAVORS, THE NOODLES, THE BROTH, THE VEGGIES... NO
I ordered the Tonkotsu. While the noodle texture was bouncy and solid, it didn't contribute anything else to the soup. That sums up almost everything in this Ramen.  The egg was completely boiled- not soft-boiled and seasoned like normal ramen joints- so no extra flavor there. The carrot chunks and cabbage were a bit thick; made me think of veggies in a bland Chicken Noodle soup instead. (Typical Ramen places don't use those veggies). The broth was also on less-flavor side. At least the Pork slices were very soft.

AT LEAST THE STAFF WAS NICE. CURIOUS KITCHEN
The young ladies at the register were very nice. Everyone was quick at their jobs. It's still easy to find a small wait outside",nlQGyti20c07rpTSYYoNZQ,1,1,2,0OpGLwZb_Yc8i21n0NSZbg

2805751,2018-06-05,1,UvcH52d-FQ3waD5Z0LmFCQ,"Hanging out between tacky souvenir shops and 2 for 1 bars, this quaint little restaurant is seductively whispering, ""Hey there, we got noods!"" Ramen is the perfect hangover food. It's soupy, it's carby, and it warms your soul from your aching head to your busted feet. How smart of you, Ramen-Ya, to situate yourself within hangover central right in the middle of the Strip in Bally's Bazaar.  

Sometimes, authenticity is a little hard to find in Las Vegas, but Ramen-Ya offers up a good, hearty bowl of it. You can tell, from the Japanese staff to the Michelin recommendations, that you're in for a treat. They offer various forms of ramen, \as well as curries, rice bowls, and Japanese side dishes like Gyoza dumplings and Karaage fried chicken. They even serve boba tea! (Not Japanese, but who doesn't love boba?) 

After a weary night doing entirely wholesome things, my girlfriends and I decided that ramen was the way to go. They offered various broth options with toppings that include beef, pork, veggie, and fried chicken. I had the lemon shio (sea salt), while the others had tonkotsu (pork bone broth) and spicy tonkotsu. Each contained some form of protein, thin noodles, a slightly overcooked half egg, a bit of black garlic oil, and a surprising amount of veggies for ultimate recovery. 

I personally loved the lemon shio. It was light, refreshing, with just the perfect amount of salt. The spicy ramen was appropriately spicy. While we all agreed the tonkotsu was not the best or most flavourful we've ever had, it was still very satisfying. One of us got karaage in the ramen, which got a little soggy from the soup sadly. This is not a unique problem to Ramen-Ya though as a lot of ramen places do this (why??) 

$20 for a nice bowl of ramen served by friendly staff who were always on top of water refills. Not the worst way to spend $20 in Vegas, that's for sure. At least it isn't something you'll feel guilty about telling your significant other.

Did my research and this is the sister company of Katana-ya based in San Fran who has won the Michelin recommendation which is prestigious in the food world. 

This place is located within the Grand Bazaar shops. The size of the restaurant is small but I've lived in Japan and most ramen places don't have a lot of square footage so this is spot on if they're trying to get the traditional Japanese feel. 

Enough about that, let's get down to the food.

Yokozuna- I ordered the spicy miso broth and it comes with 2 pieces of chicken karaage and 2 gyoza's. Man oh man this broth was on point and the noodles were fresh. I highly recommend this place to people who want to try quality Japanese Ramen on the strip without the high price. 

Beef Donburi- This dish has onions, ginger, sweet soy sauce and of course ample amount of beef on top of the rice. This dish was okay.. Nothing to write home about lol.. 

If you're around the area I highly recommend this place. Also they're doing a face lift on the menu.",gnJDOrXo2cJ8xkRXU7GUWw,4,1,4,fS5F-aywJd-tCrdZ3q5kLw

The food is priced very reasonably, especially when compared to the rest of the Strip. Entrees are about $9-$10 for reasonable portions.

I got the fried chicken curry with rice. The curry was actually quite good, very homey taste. I guess it could have been a bit warmer temperature wise, but oh well. The fried chicken was a nice touch. I was surprised to see that the vegetable curry and the fried chicken curry were the same price despite meat being more expensive in general.

The prices seemed reasonable for the location (normally you'd pay about 25% less in Chinatown, USA for the same meal). I had to wait ten minutes in line, and put my name on the list.
 

Amazingly, this place bills itself as the 'best Ramen in Las Vegas'. This is self-proclaimed, not a 'voted best Ramen by (insert name of obscure Vegas magazine or website here), so it takes serious balls to make such a claim

Bottom-line verdict from a non-Azn guy: I thought my non-spicy Miso Ramen was...average at best. Not a lot of flavor on the Miso soup, the veggies were nice and fresh, the Ramen noodles al-dente, and the fried chicken quite tasty. But overall nothing popped. 'But this is ramen', you say? Like I said, I've eaten great ramen in Alhambra before, and this wasn't great. Just average.

The tonkatsu was pretty tasty with the sauce and had a nice crunch factor, but unfortunately it was still pink in the middle. The staff was nice enough to redo the order.

The egg is supposed to be soft boiled but they hard boiled it to the point where the yolk is green. The noodles were clumpy, doesn't even taste like ramen noodles. Also, it was covered in a layer of generic chili oil that I did not ask for with some pieces of cabbage floating around. It was cheaper than the ramen back at home (Philadelphia) I guess, but omg this is so bad. You get a bowl of Frankenstein noodles but it ain't ramen!",_sWha3z3xUK_BXqjl9DPaA,2,1,2,VcVi7e1hrd40wGzvxti6-g

4645576,2016-08-07,2,UvcH52d-FQ3waD5Z0LmFCQ,"Ramen-ya Katana doesn't get a lot of love from people passing by, but I enjoyed the food and service here. I was fortunate enough to dine here with family when there was only one person eating. Not only did we get to take our time ordering, but we were able to chat with the staff and the proprietor, Koji--a former sumo wrestler. I grew up in Okinawa and this was the first time I met a sumo wrestler. It was an awesome opportunity to meet and take a few photos with him. The service was great, but let me cover the food:

Yokozuna Ramen $13.50: If you have a large appetite, this is the largest ramen they offer. It has half an egg, kakiage, two pieces of gyoza, two pieces of karaage, and two slices of cha shu pork on a bed of perfectly cooked ramen noodles in a very rich miso broth (we specifically requested miso instead of pork-based). The kakiage and gyoza soaked up the rich broth, as did the karaage--making them all very flavorful and juicy. The cha shu pork was a bit thin to my liking, but still tasty. My only gripe is that the egg was hard boiled and not soft boiled.

The Miso Ramen ($8.88) is in the same miso broth, but with slices of cha shu pork only. A family member ordered this and she thoroughly enjoyed it. As for the portions, Koji and his staff are generous with the broth and noodles. You will be full when you eat here (granted you like and finish your food). Sushi burritos or ""sushirritos' are also offered if you're into those. I personally haven't tried them, but they look pretty good. One downside about Ramen-ya Katana is that there are eight very cramped seats on the left side of the restaurant. The stools are small, and the small space can make it a little warm while eating.

Our ramen was served piping hot, which we definitely appreciated. The ramen I've had in New Jersey sucks (most ramen places in NJ aren't authentic), so even in triple digit weather, the food definitely hit the spot and filled a craving. There are more popular ramen places in Vegas, but Ramen-ya Katana is a solid option if you can't make it to Ramen Sora or Monta Ramen.",e1dYw-1Km6IAwXlOLIMAeg,2,3,4,cRCaBJ3cl-xfb1TnrEMiDw

Back home, pho, ramen, and Chinese noodle spots are my jam, so when I came across Ramen-Ya in the Grand Bazaar in front of Bally's, I was intrigued!  Especially since it was such a cold night!

A sister restaurant of Katana-Ya in San Francisco (once one of the best ramen shops in SF, but definitely not these days), Ramen-Ya offers a nice alternative that's both different and not overly pricey.  The menu is interesting enough as well, offering a variety of ramen featuring different types of broths and topping combinations, as well as a mix of rice plates, appetizers, and small plates.  Sadly, I can't say the food was that remarkable, though.

-- MILK TEA...$5
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-ya-las-vegas-5?select=vQUrKHgW-p5w5LiLSwKXDQ)
The menu didn't list it, but I assume this was black tea.  I say ""assume"" because I could barely taste the tea.  It's not like it was overly creamy or sweet either.  Honestly, it just seemed like it was really watered down.  Save your money for the tables.

-- ONIGIRI & KARAAGE (Two Pieces)...$8
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-ya-las-vegas-5?select=gNqUwhg3YTcbhjt7Yq6Gjg)
Like with Jekyll and Hyde, one of these was good, the other was BAD.  For me, the Karaage was pretty decent - crisp batter, decent flavor, and somewhat moist.  The onigiri, however, was AWFUL.  Not sure what was worse - its ridiculously bland taste or its mealy/gross texture.

-- TONKOTSU RAMEN - Pork Chashu, Assorted Vegetables, and a Boiled Egg in Chicken and Pork Broth...$10.85
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-ya-las-vegas-5?select=mDUKUBa0j5lF4tptdh7wmw)
It lists a ""chicken and pork broth"", but has Tonkotsu (read: pork broth) as an option.  Weird.  In any case, this was super disappointing.  While the noodles weren't bad, everything else missed - the broth was lackluster, the cabbage, bean sprouts, and spinach were out of place, the chashu wasn't warm (the fat was still congealed), and the egg was overcooked.

As far as service goes, it was fine - quick, efficient, and decently friendly.  However, as nice as the staff was, I can't say I appreciate how they apply a 16% tip to ALL parties, regardless of size (the menu only notes an 18% gratuity to groups of six or more).  Sure, I would've tipped at least that anyways, but it's both a bad look and dumb, since it caps off anyone who might have given more.

All in all, despite how great it is to now be able to get a hot bowl of ramen on The trip, you'd be better off leaving The Strip to try one of the many other ramen joints Vegas has to offer.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,13,12,2,UySobCwrvjs2R54yzRtZSg

Their broth is perfectly seasoned with just enough spice to not overpower the tastebuds. The Ramen literally melts in your mouth.

The staff was incredibly friendly and personable. In such a small space, the employees remain professional while maintaining a true ""Ramen restaurant"" nirvana feel.

A small restaurant tucked within a plaza filled with  many other places to eat. Food is solid, being very affordable (especially in Las Vegas), generous portions, and super yummy. Food is not like OMG THIS IS THE BEST but more like MMM THIS IS YUMMY. Service was awesome though. The owner was so freaking nice. 

DETAILS: 

Inside: tiny! They have a small seating area in the left most area that fits about 10 people max. If you have a large group, I recommend you either eat outside or take it Togo. 

- The food: Btw everyone, the menu is outdated. The prices have been raised so every thing is in the $9 range. 

I ORDERED (1) Shoyu Ramen: broth was very flavorful: You can taste tones of miso, soy sauce, and sesame oil and they offered a lot of veggies (lettuce and bean sprouts). Only two slices of meat though, which is pretty typical of ramen but these slices were tiny. LMAOOO. Half of a boiled egg though I wish they were soft boiled. 

(2) Katana Sushi Burrito: no nori to wrap the burritos in. They're actually wrapped in flour tortillas which made me crack up. Can't really go wrong with this, I really enjoyed it and it was a good size. 

Service was bomb. The owner was the one serving us and he was so kind. 5 stars!",AGx4wPCECTVEBLyl_t8zHg,0,1,5,2QXQTCCih2r6eA6azVWvtg

Tucked away from the chaos of the strip, it's located in the alleyway in front of Starbucks by Bally's. When you walk in, it's small but quaint. I ordered the spicy miso ramen which came out to a little under $10 after tax which is not bad, considering Vegas prices. The seating was tight, but I didn't mind. When my ramen came out, the portions were HUGE! The noodles were stacked sky high and the broth was almost overflowing. It came with half an egg, chunks of fried vegetable tempura, and 3 pieces of chasu pork. 

That first sip was just what I needed! The broth was spicy, flavorful, and hearty. The noodles were chewy and a good consistency. Overall, it was a filling and satisfying meal to start my day. I highly recommend it for those looking for an authentic Japanese ramen place away from the hustle and bustle that's not only affordable, but also delicious!",L_JUv8xpi8bhC8T9YrZyoA,0,0,4,C1UYI_IlNB7HOBS6y6oD2A

My wife and I shared takoyaki, onigiri, miso karage ramen, and tonkatsu curry. The takoyaki is particular was awesome, I thought I'd never have good takoyaki in the US, and the tonkatsu curry was exactly like how it would be served in Japan.  Very good, and very filling.",xJYJY58AQw2mLy3xq8ognQ,0,0,5,WAw0tdp8Kjju6825ZyFEBw
5775727,2017-07-29,0,UvcH52d-FQ3waD5Z0LmFCQ,This place is located in the Ballys shops. The place has has about 7-8 tables and minimal outdoor bar seating. The menu is a pretty good variety with ramen ranging from $10-$14 and various rice plates from $9-$14. Overall the quality was good and so was the service. Portions are a decent size as well.

I got spicy miso which is my all time favorite and was very pleased with how tasty and spicy the broth was. However the pork chashu wasn't cooked right and the egg was literally a hard boiled egg.. not yolky or creamy at all. Which was so weird to me!",s7I9V3rpghby-jYI5upL1g,0,0,3,dSUlnMflOZ6MCbD8gjTYAw

This place is a nice place to eat and it doesn't totally gouge your wallet.  So for a quick and easy bite to eat this is a good place to give it a go.,VxvFf0NeKk5lT-4Wdp9qkw,1,1,4,EPiVM6BSP_b5wsBkBAxLwg

I liked the idea of adding a mini curry bowl. Curry bowl was okay. 

Nothing special, but would satisfy the craving if you wanted ramen.",33d2OBr5yMWMMW_ibYbqIA,0,0,3,xG3OcBU2vgoyrhwgb8IamQ

1.) It's such a little place...clauster phobic..
2.) The food is awesome
3.) Service is awesome
4.) There's portion is good..
5.) They take orders via tablets

It's weird though they got 2 kitchens...it's at each end of the restaurant.
It's at the grand bazaar, South side...
I ate mine so quick...the broth is just right..I ordered the spicy soup like $13 it's not bad since it came with gyoza, and chicken..
Didn't have seaweed though...
I talked to the server..she isn't Japanese she was pretty straight forward I asked her lots of questions and she was patient.
The chef is Japanese..the other servers are Japanese...therefore authentic Japanese..Oh they also have Bobatea...it's like bubble tea in Canada..
I didn't order it but my friend did and she loves it...
It's a hidden gem I would say..if you want something local..",OpLYM_y6ReDz6dEv8_ra4A,1,0,4,cpxu4a9dCoiFTUp9PX3Ebw

Noodles cooked exactly right, flavorful beef pieces, and fresh vegetables. With all the crappy pizza, burgers, and so on, in LV, this place provides a tasty, quick, nutritious meal. There was no compulsory tip as another reviewer said. I would return.",Ugs2S47VF_WBu6VG8VgYRQ,0,0,5,9d1ESKpxRwJq_6xNgiIH7Q
