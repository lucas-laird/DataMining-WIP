We were looking for somewhere to catch an inexpensive breakfast on a Monday morning before our flight.  Since we stayed at Trump we just walked two blocks up to Fashion Show Mall and most of all the food court places were open by 10:30am.

I decided to order from Ichiban because they were giving free samples of their chicken teriyaki and it was really good!  I went with the chicken teriyaki udon.  They ask you if you want it spicy or not - but their spicy is not spicy.  The udon itself was light and yummy and they give you tons of chicken with your order.  All in all pretty tasty!

Did you really travel all the way here to eat mall food?  It's like coming to this city and then going to McDonalds, KFC, or In&Out.  Why?  Do they not have these places where you live?

After doing some shopping, my friend wanted to come here and eat a quick bite but I was very hesitant.

I decided to try Philly Cheese Streak and the guy working on the grill 5/16/14 @ 635pm was very disgruntled.  No greeting because he was too busy pre-frying up bell peppers so he can put them in a bin.

He asks me what I want.  I give him my order.  Then he comes to the cash register and asks me again what I want.  Don't ask people what they want while you are frying up bell peppers.  Only do one task at a time.  You cannot multi-task.  Just makes you look like an idiot.

Look at the sign and it says, try our Fries, the way it's made in Philly.  I ordered a cheese steak with mushrooms and added the combo (med drink and fries). 

To my surprise, he took a bag of frozen fries from the freezer and poured it in the fryer.  DO THEY MAKE FRIES THIS WAY IN PHILLY?

Then he took out a couple of slices of frozen wafer meat from another freezer and put it on the stove to thaw.  Then sliced it up so it ""looks"" like meat you get from a really Philly Steak.

You get very little meat.  Come on, it's frozen, does the rent in the mall cost that much?  The fries were MEH and I could have done a better job at home.

I wasted $14 here because I couldn't eat what he made.

Lesser known: Villa Italian Kitchen, Taco Maker, Suki Hana, Philadelphia Steak & Hoagie, Great Wraps, India Masala, Crazy Crepes, Chicken Connection.

I'm merely only reviewing the food court and not the actual FOOD locations. That's a completely separate review. 

Overall, though, I like that the food court is on a separate level from the rest of the mall. There's ample seating and decent cleanliness when compared to other food establishments. However, that's not to say that it could use some work. It's passable for my standards, but maybe not for others. Maybe a little more effort could go towards wiping down the tables and cleaning the table suraces a bit more. Also, emptying out the trash cans and just sweeping just a bit more would bump up the cleanliness score. 

From the food court level, you can go outside and actually have a nice view of the Wynn and the Palazzo. So that's kind of a plus.
