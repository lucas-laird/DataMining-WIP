While lamenting I searched online and found ""Kosher On The Grill"" and decided that I need shwarma! Yudi did not dissapoint. I got the shwarma lafa and my wife the pita. This is the meal I had been needing so badly! I felt as if I was back in shuk Levinsky but with a lot less noise. I will be returning often to this wonderful find that Vegas has been needing. The best of success to Yudi and his friends! I will spread the word too! (written by the husband)",dwaerfZlyrlEFoWK2V2New,0,1,5,mAkLQUL4ogzhTPqwuIfQKg

When I saw a new kosher Mexican and Mediterranean spot that serves falafels, I went within an hour of the discovery. It was too interesting to resist. 

Yes, it is kosher Mexican and Mediterranean with everything from tacos and fajitas to shawarma and falafels. 

Everyone was super friendly, willing to accomodate my million questions and requests with a smile and a laugh. Definitely customer service with a smile. 

I ended up ordering the falafel plate that comes with two sides and pita. The falafel flavor lit up my face with smiles. Being a greedy falafel-lover, I do wish they were a bit bigger, but on the plate you get about 8 of them, so I can't really complain.  And, the plate comes with a side of pickles. Now, that's the business! For my sides. I had the Israeli salad and the babaganoush. The baba was one of the best I've had around town, but the salad was a tad disappointing. It is simply diced vegetables with little to no additional spice, like parsley, or dressing, just a lemon wedge on the side. Yes, I know it isn't supposed to come with ranch, but at least a little punch to the taste is nice. And for those carb-lovers, the pita was thick, pillowy and even a tad sweet. 

Intriguing menu, friendly faces and pickles. I say it's worth a try!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,15,17,4,GxrysYX63ZnPbv5-CbLKJA
