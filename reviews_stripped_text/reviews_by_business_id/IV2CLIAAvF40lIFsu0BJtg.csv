Not impressed with the quality, pepper steak had too much gristle and vegetarian fried rice was oily.
We were sat in a table with people walking within 3 feet of me . Some event exited and there was5000 people walking past my table.
Bad experience unfortunately . And for a high end Asian place I expect a lot more.
3 stars only because the service was pleasing....",3QqdQP_P4zZUxsFU_0HqKg,0,0,3,PpVHoz1jRRRUZxtjoF0HZA

She is the only reason I didn't give only 4 stars and that would have been only because the price which was high. LOVED the  unusual and delicious signature drinks- especially the Ms. Chin I believe it was called- A delicious unusual concoction of pear sorbet, a little champagne and lychee vodka amoung other delicious ingredients. Our food (especially the signature dishes sweet and sour soup and beef wagu fried rice) was outstanding! We are in Vegas often and understand most unique restaurants fall under the category of very pricey. I think the only reason they don't have a higher rating is people come expecting to have a normal Chinese food restaurant experience and that is not what this offers. They had a live Chinese singer that was fabulous and the vibe was much more engaging  and lively than your typical Chinese food restaurant. If you can't get a table the bar is a super fun place to hang with the full menu... The bartenders also were a wealth of knowledge and interest.",Tc3oNxRCsmxVs9RA8pnx_Q,2,1,5,jdxOqfluEBqhcWCOrb-L2g

We decided to give this place a try as the advertisements left my mouth watering. You are instantly taken care of by multiple people when you walk in.  Even though it seems very upscale they make you feel very comfortable.  The server goes over in detail the menu and how it's served.  He leaves the menu with you so you can add more Dim Sum if you would like.  My daughter is very picky and just wanted noodles and broth and they asked the chef if he would do it and of course he did.  My husband ordered a noodle dish, which was delicious and I had started with two different Dim Sums.  I ended up going back for two more that our server had recommended.   All of which were delicious!  We probably spent more than what we anticipated for lunch but I actually go to Vegas for the food not for the gambling.

From the 1st delicious bite of our appetizers, to the friendly staff focused on excellence, to the outstanding main dishes, it was a pleasure dining here. This restaurant is upscale and has a couple other locations in Hong Kong (the chef is from there). 

The food is a taste explosion of Cantonese deliciousness (with some Schezuan & traditional flavor influences). They have lobster and crab dishes which will run you a pretty penny; and also serve roast duck with a wait time of 45 mins-an hour to prepare. The Jasmine tea is also fantastic. We were pleasantly surprised at how awesome the food is here and were impressed by the friendly efficient staff. We'll definitely be back to try the lobster next time!

My kung pao shrimp wasn't at all spicy which I thought was kind of weird but they used big-o prawns.  It wasn't overly salty like a lot of Chinese food places but I've never been to a ""fancy"" Chinese restaurant before so I don't have much to compare it to.  If you do come here, get their bbq pork.  Of all the bbq porks I've ever had - being Chinese, I've had many - this is one of the best.  Thick, juicy slices.  You'll love it.  So yeah, 2 dishes and an appetizer is kind of out there for price but the ambiance is intimate and the live music is great.

Essentially, I'm from LA and we have a lot of amazing Chinese food for half the price it is here. I get it. It's Vegas. But damn. lol

That said, the food we ordered was good. Soup dumplings were the perfect amount of warm soup and meat. Siu mai, although small, was flavorful. Sweet and sour soup was very good, but be warned that the $15 price is for a single cup serving. Sichuan pepper chicken--really tasty, but the chicken is fried (which I wasn't expecting) and buried in the sichuan peppers that it's cooked in, which adds a lot of flavor, but also a lot of dry spice.  Topped it off with the veggie noodles, which were tasty, but nothing super special.

We ordered a bottle of wine and it came out on a cart with a bunch of crazy looking decanters.  And the wine was also v tasty. I believe we ordered a pinot...

Overall, food was good, but not the most amazing I've ever had.  If you're visiting Vegas and haven't had some good Chinese food due to where you live, this wouldn't be a terrible place to try (and to spend lots of $$$$).",5RKPM3c-4GS4AaSKtgTKgg,1,0,3,hx8ePpS-tqstT05B7TvJhw

     Yes, there was a delay getting our food. It happens and both the manager and David were very attentive and gracious about the issue. And the restaurant picked up a dessert for both of us so the matter was resolved on the spot without complaint. And the desserts suggested by David wee spot on, so that was a bonus.

There were plenty of open tables but we waited over 30 minutes to be seated.  We sat at the bar while we waited and the bartenders were nice but the drinks were just so-so (and expensive).  Once seated we ordered a few appetizers for our table and some more drinks.  The waiter was pretty attentive but everything seemed to take a while.  Appetizers were okay, nothing remarkable.  Dinner also was good but nothing remarkable.  The cost was outrageous.  I would not recommend this place when there are so many other really good places to go.",STXEJtU1aBf44aXGL7xKUw,1,0,3,1m3WzWlNZyXcw9wNwaR2bw

Spring rolls and Dim Sum were good the most disappointing part of our dinner was the main entrees. Very small dishes with high prices, the black pepper beef was heavy in fat we only ate half the dish. A friend ordered the noodle and shrimp dish as she does not eat meat. Her meal came out 15 mins after ours as we were told there was only one working wok !  By the time her meal came out all of our food was stone cold. Our bill was over $300 we had 6 dishes and 4 drinks. The entrees are very small and since our food was cold we left half as it was no longer edible. Unfortunately we left hungry and ended up at In N Out. Was so excited to try this new restaurant and left unhappy.",ot3Okn5N4UTh6KZsol4fpQ,2,0,1,3emTkDiidCJleB8TkPu12Q

4972961,2018-04-12,0,IV2CLIAAvF40lIFsu0BJtg,"I am of Cantonese ancestry and grew up in Vancouver BC where Cantonese food is very good. As such, i consider i have pretty high standards when it comes to Chinese food.
My husband and 12 yo daughter ate here one evening before a show. We had an appetizer, 2 entrees (both specials, both seafood dishes), a vegetable dish and house made egg tarts for dessert. The food was incredibly flavorful without being salty and the egg tarts were fluffy, flaky and the custard was silky. The wine pairing suggestion was perfect.
The service was outstanding and they were mindful of our time.
The price was that of a high end restaurant, so don't expect your typical American Chinese diner prices. When it comes to fine dining, you can expect the quality and service to match the price point.",VR9gnHr13y9ozwyrfcdqfQ,1,1,5,3w3g-7o2KRT-k7bP0UFCaw

I was immediately greeted when we walk to the entrance and was told the day before was their Grand Opening- Congratulations. 

I was drawn to the location because the aroma was just too captivating stealing me away from the Resturant just right across the way. The ambiance just seemed so similar to an experience I had in Hong Kong - a very memorable be positive experience! 

I wished I had taken pictures of our first dish. It was the Peking Duck- prepared in such a pristine way, that our mouth watered as our palates couldn't wait for the first morsel to be devoured. Wow...

Dish after dish came out and nothing less than excellence hit our table. I could go on and on about this place, but I would recommend you try it our for yourself. Foodies, you will not be disappointed!",f46fg7BtcF5VOdqpPD6INw,1,4,5,-qjvUGWnlKt_rqJUCgRYFg

Lowlights:
- Dim Sum was good but small.  $15 for 4 tiny pieces of Shrimp Dumpling and Siu Mai - it's typically $6 an order at good dim sum restaurants in the SF bay area
- Entrees also small and didn't wow us at over $30 a dish
- Simmered Rice Vermicelli Soup Noodle served with packaged udon that was still clumped together
- Brought out wrong vegetable orders 
- Waitress asked us if we wanted a dish that they made in mistake when putting in our order (not complimentary)

5791150,2018-04-25,0,IV2CLIAAvF40lIFsu0BJtg,"The food was not bad even if the portions were tiny. The service however was horrible. They had one very talkative waiter that appeared to be the principal waiter due to his fluent English...and than they had an auxiliary personnel which was crowding our table. Every 2 minutes someone was coming to the table. I kid you not! It was very weird. They were abusive. As soon as one waiter brought over a tiny bowl of rice another waiter came to the table to take it away. I took the abuse the first 10 times but on the 11th time I just screamed at one woman to give us some rest and space. Perhaps they acted that way because we did not order an alcoholic drink. Therefore  they were mad at us trying to rush us out. It was pretty nasty! The atmosphere was based on SELL, SELL and again SELL policy. It felt as if we have entered some used car salesman shop from China. They were very aggressive. We come to a restaurant to relax and enjoy the food. What kind of enjoyment can you get in that abusive atmosphere? It is acceptable to demonstrate interest by asking how we were doing but they could not care less. In fact, they were openly hostile because we did not meet their financial expectation. I saw how the waitress I screamed at to give us peace demonstratively was passing on my irritation with the place to another waiter. As soon as she finished telling him he rushed over to our table to pick up the wine glasses. The fact that we were eating did not concern him.  Can you imagine going to a restaurant to be mistreated while still paying them a pretty penny? Would never recommend that place! It is unfortunate that a reputable hotel like the MGM Grand would rent its space out to such establishment. What was the management of the MGM Grand thinking when it brought the China Tang restaurant in? They probably solicit the good reviews from their friends. Considering a good number of negative reviews they should take it in consideration but I am sure they would reply to me in the same standard manner they have responded to other negative reviews.",-ajHpS44Tkklk6tuSLsQnQ,1,0,1,iCtO4EbqTfvclqh3GEHPpg

We had many of the dim sum items as well as the crispy sea bass , the Kung Pao chicken and the Curry noodles with shrimp. As I stated, everything was very good but the stand outs to me were the Barbecue pork, the pork Bao, Crab wontons and the crispy sea bass. What China Tang really excelled in was service. We were taken care of by David, who was attentive and helpful without hovering and being overbearing. We were also attended to by the Sommelier Drea who China Tang was smart to steal away from the Caesars properties. I highly recommend utilizing her if you need assistance with wine choices. I went off the outdated information on a website so did not know that we had the option to order the 2 special dishes they are known for, the ""Hammer"" Chicken and the Roasted Duck at lunch but next time will definitely try those two dishes
All said it was an extremely enjoyable lunch, thanks in large part to Drea and David",WdEG5Y2UxwCYhyzBTIDLhw,0,0,5,IS5uqAxmD1gLgXdbiRAtdw

Cons: management is unethical. Went with a large group and they tried to swindle us by attempting to triple the price of the meal after we already agreed on a menu and price. Also portion sizes are tiny for the price.

If you want to get ripped off come here. Otherwise, tons of other good restaurants on the strip to choose from.


UPDATE: management has reached out to my group and apologized for what happened. The assistant manager that tried to rip us off has left the restaurant, and they have promised to turn it around. I was satisfied with how they handled our complaints and am updating this review to reflect that.
