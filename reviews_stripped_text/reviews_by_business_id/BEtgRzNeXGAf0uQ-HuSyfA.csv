We ordered takoyaki and garlic edamame for appetizer, vegetable fried rice with Ohjah house ramen for my entree. And they are delicious!!!! My favorite is the fried rice, it turns out to be a lot bigger at the portion out of my expectations and I have to take most of them home. I really love the way they makes those ramen soups not too salty which most of other places do. They also make the broth of the real meat instead of using stock. ( you can actually see that from the kitchen see through window).

Service are overall very nice, waitress quit attentive and helpful.

You maybe familiar with Ohjah as they have sushi and steakhouse restaurants throughout the Vegas Valley.  This restaurant specializes in ramen only.

Basic bowl : The base includes Chashu, seaweed and bean sprouts. From there you can choose different broths stocks, Tonkatsu, Curry, Shoyu, Vegetable, and Miso.   There's also a selection of set of 'House Special Ramen' you can order.  Also as with Ramen-Ya in the valley , you can add addition toppings for additional charge. 

I went for the Ohjah House Ramen from the House Special Ramen section.  Tonkatsu style broth, Oxtail, beef, Chashu, and soft boiled egg. When this huge hot steamy bowl was presented to me I knew I was goin to LOVE it! Man, that broth! Texture was like silky. Noodles are fresh, al dente, 2 bones of tender Oxtail, Chashu (pork belly) slice also dissolved when you took a bite. Perfect bowl of ramen! And it was just $9.75! Really reasonable price. 

There are also appetizers you can get, but I just glossed over that part and did not read what they had since I wasn't super hungry, so I'll leave it up to you guys with the bigger appetite to report back on it. 

I like that this place is spacious and not cramped like other noodle houses. Looks like they accommodate more people too. Kitchen is enclosed with window facing the dining area, so you have a clear view of what's going on in there. 

Service was excellent! Host will take you to your table and will also be the one to check you out when you are ready to leave.  The servers were great! My order was taken promptly and came out quick. Kudos to the attentive server who offered more broth to warm up my ramen cause I got a little distracted taking pix. :/... that was really nice, he didn't have to do that. Thank you! 

Anyway, if you are in the area near Ikea, btwn Sunset & Warm Springs on Durango , you'll find this place by the new EOS Fitness gym.  Definitely making this place my go-to for ramen out here.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,13,10,4,I6FzjlBErV5AKvd3nHSKzg

A problem with ox tail in most restaurants is the level of tenderness. Most times I've had ox tail at a sub par pho restaurant, the ox tail was difficult to eat, but Ohjah does it RIGHT. Literally fall off the bone, juicy and succulent. The broth is something you must have in this cold ass Vegas winter; definitely hits the spot! Another thing I enjoyed is the piece of bok choy that is included in the ramen, it was a perfect, refreshing, addition to the meal. 

One thing that did irk me a bit is the noodle to broth ratio. The amount of noodles and toppings were PERFECT, it was a lot more than what other ramen spots serve, but the bowl could stand a little more broth ¯\_(?)_/¯ 

BEST THING, (better than Jinya): SUPER SPACIOUS. A lot more seating to accommodate bigger parties, and a lot more lighting---it does your Yelp pictures justice.

So... I'm grateful that Ohjah decided to branch out from Teppanyaki to Noodles. I'm going to keep this one really brief. There is a wide variety of good food here from appetizers to beer.
I recommend adding some pepper oil to your meal unless you are really really against spice. I needed a few spoonfuls to make my ramen taste just right and I'm not a huge spice nut. They also provide you with garlic cloves upon request which added an extra depth of flavor for me. No extra charge. Everything we had was very delicious and pretty much on par with any other ramen joint you'll find around town. If you are there for the first time, the Ohjah House Special is a good choice. Very good.
While the food is good, there is nothing completely mind-blowing. And that's ok. Because to me, the real advantage that this place is that it can accommodate a lot more people than your average ramen joint in Las Vegas. There is plenty of table seating as well as counter seating and parking doesn't seem to be an issue here. That is a huge plus because I'm so over waiting for 45 minutes just to have a bowl of ramen. For this reason alone, I will be frequenting this joint much more.

Once you walk in, you immediately notice how spacious this place is. Compared to many of the other ramen restaurants in Vegas, which are tiny little spots. 

My roomie and I were seated right away at a table. The servers were attentive, prompt, and friendly. We ordered: the Ohjah Special ramen with oxtail, Tonkatsu ramen, shrimp skewers, and the house fried rice. 

My roomie loved the oxtail. She said it was juicy and fell right off the bone. She was also very impressed with the noodle to broth ratio. She said at some other ramen places there's either too many noodles or too much broth. And Ohjah nailed it with the noodle to broth ratio.

A server brought some spicy oil to our table. I added it to my Tonkatsu ramen and it made my dish taste much better (and this is coming from someone who usually stays away from spicy). The Tonkatsu broth was already flavorful prior to adding the spicy oil, however, it greatly enhanced my first time experience at Ohjah. The shrimp skewers were very tasty. The house fried rice was eh, nothing special. I probably won't order the house fried rice again.

At the end of our meal, a girl approached our table with a tablet to pay for our check. I'm still highly impressed with how technology works nowadays in regards to paying for meals at restaurants lol. Anyways, it was easy and simple.

Talk about match made in heaven plus always enjoy checking out new restaurants around the valley. Guess Ohjah has a bunch of restaurants each one specializing in one style or food. I never been to any of the other ones. I was excited about checking out one of the newest ones. Ramen is one of my favorite foods. 

The menu is not much different then other Ramen places around town you pick your style broth and then spicy level. One item that stood out for me. Thankful yelp community checked out the pics noticed oxtail ramen. I was one of there house special ramen. The spicy level went mild since first time and had no idea level of hot. The medium or mild was nice subtle kick nothing major. The oxtail had mixed feelings. One piece with the bone that had hardly any meat and it was super tough. Then you had couple other pieces fall off the bone just the meat and was Sooo good. It was nice moist, juicy, and could have bowl of just oxtail. The broth has great depth and really good. The noodles was also delicious. The toppings you can add more but just went with whatever came with the dish. It always tradition for me go ramen style get some gyoza. It was very tasty. Overall solid Ramen spot. It definitely up in my top five but couple of the more stable Ramen spots better. The location literally almost in my backyard less then ten minutes away. I have no problem coming back for more then deal with long line of the more busy spots.

One thing need mention that Ohjah stands out, The size of the restaurant. We all associate Ramen spots or least for me. Not very big. Ohjah is literally twice the size then any other ramen spot around town. I only came for lunch so not sure the dinner crowd. I would find it hard see long waiting list like some of the smaller ramen spots around town. The service is nothing but five stars!!! My server was friendly, explain the menu being my first time, and always had smile on his face. Positive vibes. The decor inside feels more like restaurant restaurant  with the size lots of booths, tables, and not forget they do have ramen bar area that can watch the magic happen while you slurp down some noodles.

I was busy taking pictures and he came back to check on me. After I added the extra spicy sauce I liked it! My friend got the ohjiah house special ramen. He enjoyed his.

2558725,2018-06-20,0,BEtgRzNeXGAf0uQ-HuSyfA,"Oil ramen. Yum. I think not.

My first sip of the Tan Tan ramen broth was essentially oil and a little bit of spice, and that sums up the dish. I tried to spoon off the oil, but my noodles were already coated at that point. There was no saving that dish.

Ohjah's broth was better, still slightly on the oiler side but bareable. I've had hearter broths at other places though.
Char was not as melt in your mouth as I expected. Flavorwise was lacking too.

Gyoza was gyoza. Nothing special. Sizing is proportional to pricing (5 small pieces.)

Takoyaki was fantastic.. Perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. The amount of bonito flakes they used makes me happy.

Service was great. The servers were attentive and friendly. Good prices for good portion sizes.

2619325,2017-11-30,20,BEtgRzNeXGAf0uQ-HuSyfA,"This is my favorite ramen spot to date. It's out of the way from home, but worth the drive for us. Plus my office just moved in the area, so that's a score!

I always use to avoid eating ramen since the restaurants around town are always tiny and crazy packed when the weather is cold or rainy. Waiting 30+ minutes is not worth it (Especially when I'm already hangry.) We use to frequent Jinya, but I started to notice that they screw you on toppings and broth. The price is steep for add-ons and they just don't hook it up like they use to. Thier service is lacking as well. They use to be my #1 spot when they opened a few years back and sadly they slowly went downhill from there. Props to their takoyaki though! 

OHJAH warmed up to me quickly (like a comforting bowl of ramen). Here's why:

1. We never have to wait for a table 
2. Attentive service & employees are eager to help
3. Food served shockingly quick
4. Quality ingredients with wholesome, flavorful & balanced broth (not too oily, salty or light)
5. Thick, perfectly meaty and fatty sliced chashu! Totally drool worthy! Order extra always! 
6. Prices are reasonable, it isn't $5 for 2 thinly sliced paper-thin chasu like every other ramen joint
7. Most importantly they do not skimp on the toppings or broth! I hope that never changes! 

*Recommendations: 
The takoyaki is great 4/5 
The tonkatsu is my favorite 5/5 
My toppings: chashu, menma (bamboo), scallion, soft boiled egg, corn, seaweed, wood ear mushrooms 5/5 

*Pro tip: Ask for these toppings on the side: black garlic oil & spicy chili paste. They add a nice kick to your ramen and it isn't overly spicy. It's just an extra $1 for the chili and $1 for the garlic oil, but definitely enough to split between two people! Add it to your broth to taste 5/5

*Secret menu: Garlic lover? Ask for the fresh garlic. They hand you a tool to crush the bulbs yourself, then blend the crushed garlic into your broth! Really packs a flavorful punch. We love it. 5/5",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,30,28,5,xf_ixEFjuk3CsJm0q3PKKA

I ordered the Tonkotsu with corn and menma. Mmmmm, it was so delicious. The broth was amazing and full of so much flavor. Not too salty, not too thick. Temperature was perfect. Chashu was tender. I'm drooling just thinking about it. But, my one complaint is they don't have on their menu what kind of noodles come with the different broths/flavors. And, sadly, mine came with the thin noodles :( I just am obsessed with the thick noodles but didn't want to switch it or anything like that. So the thin noodles were ok but I would have preferred the thick! 

If I lived in this area, this would be my go-to Ramen spot!! But I live nearly a half hour away :( it was definitely worth the drive to try it out, though and I'll probably make the drive again to try the beef and oxtail ramens!!",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,3,2,5,y5sUa4PTvRJ8OILmeQD22A

Once we got our food, it was clear to see that their kitchen crew knew how to make a mean bowl of ramen. My broth had so much flavor, and my favorite part, was that I could ask for whole garlic to crush fresh into my bowl. The killer of the entire meal though, had to be their fried rice. It tasted like a teppanyaki style fried rice straight from the flat top.

Japanese ramen is salty and fatty and that's what I love. This is none of those things. I realize fat is required for the broth to stick to the noodles. Just use the spoon. It works better. 

The broth is clean and milky. Cooking oxtail can render a ton of grease, but they took the time to skim it, leaving just the milky flavor to speak for itself. It's also not salty, just right. For the first time in a while, I left a ramen shop not feeling parched. 

The chashu had a nice roasted crust and pretty tender, but it knew it wasn't the star. It graciously let the oxtail be the main attraction. It was like Korean oxtail soup I get at my grandmother's. 

Everything was in balance, if anything, there was more meat than noodles. No complaints there. The noodles were al dente and stayed that way the whole time with good chew. 

I can't remember the last time I left a ramen shop feeling like I didn't pay with a few days of longevity.",j5kD6MSrT63G2i6q9P2eaQ,0,0,5,kwuRw3IE0GRSzADgaF4qAg

that can equally match MC. I yelped other places and thought this place have good reviews.
I ordered take out and  got the Ohjah  ramen 
with a combination of beef, oxtail, Chashu 
in tonkotsu broth ( rich and milky broth from pork bones cooked for hours.) this broth is really amazing among all other broths. I personally think that if a good ramen joint is serving amazing tonkotsu broth, then I would think the miso and
Shoyo broths are equally spectacular. 
I got home and poured out the soup in a ceramic bowl. Well, I don't see the egg.  They all come with half a slice of egg. Oookay?!
So far, my tonkotsu broth is good and surprisingly not salty compared to most ramen restaurants.
...and that was a big plus, and a minus for no egg. 
Would I go back?  Yeah I would but I wouldn't consider it the best.
They have another restaurant in Henderson. 
The server told me that it's more Japanese food 
on the menu and no ramen except this location on Durango.
I don't know whether she's new or giving me incorrect info., but it looks like the other restaurant is serving ramen as well.

3114594,2017-01-18,1,BEtgRzNeXGAf0uQ-HuSyfA,"When it comes to ramen noodle houses, or any establishment that specializes in making soup, I am very picky about how the broth is made. When a soup's broth is too oily or salty, I can't stand to eat it. However, this place had none of those problems.

My friend and I ordered the Tan Tan Men (Spicy) and the Ohjah House Ramen. We also ordered two appetizers: gyoza and squid skewers (All of these are in the photo collage). Everything tasted great and we had no complaints about the freshness or quality of the food.

My friend ordered the Tan Tan Men and said it wasn't as spicy as she thought it would be. It had more of a sweet taste. The condiments on the table that could be added to any dish, such as the chili powder, helped give it more heat and flavor. If you want to add chili paste (topping), it's a dollar extra. I added it to my order, but the quantity that they gave was more like ten cents worth! It was a really tiny, tiny scoop of chili. For someone who can handle a lot of heat in her food, I could have done without it. It eventually got lost in the broth. lol

Pricing is about the same compared to other ramen houses and the staff's service was not bad. Our server wasn't as friendly and seemed to be a lil annoyed, but everyone else who came around was really nice.

I don't think I would travel all the way down to this part of town just to eat ramen here, but if I'm in the area, I won't totally write this place off. All in all, it's a nice neighborhood noodle house with a simple menu.",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,4,1,4,l_fxXzUNzdsP8jwhHwIegA

i really like this place.  This is my go-to ramen spot in Las Vegas!!  The staff is very friendly and very helpful.  Always greeted with a smile when you walk in.  The different types of ramen come with either a chicken broth or a pork broth.  You can always request the broth you prefer and they will make your ramen with that broth at no extra cost.  I've had the tan tan, ohjah special, but my usual is the miso ramen.  Depending on how hungry I am, I may get extra noodles.  The nice thing is... if you need more broth, just ask and they will bring out a small bowl for you.  Also, if you ordered the pork broth and wanted to taste the chicken broth, they will gladly bring out a small bowl for you to taste.  

Besides the ramen, I have had the gyoza, takoyaki, house fried rice, garlic edamame, chicken wings, and chicken egg rolls.  Of all the appetizers, I'd have to say the fried rice and garlic edamame were my favorites.  I just can't get enough of their spicy chili sauce they make in-house.

The waiter came by several times throughout our dinner and checked to see if everything was ok and if we needed anything else.

3432252,2017-01-07,0,BEtgRzNeXGAf0uQ-HuSyfA,"This is the second ramen house in my neighborhood. I'm so happy that I have a choice.

I actually visited this location on a Saturday following their soft opening on a Thursday. So the restaurant was empty. They used this time to get the staff trained and work out any kinks. So it was really nice to hear the supervisor asking our opinion on how to better their services and soups. Honestly, although the new waitress was a little all over the place due to her too many ""supervisors"", she did great. There wasn't much I could contribute. However, I did think that the free cookies n cream mochi ice cream was a great addition. It nicely cleaned my palate after having ramen. Very refreshing.

So I was surprised on my second visit, with my family, that the menu looked totally different. It definitely was not a bad thing. The menu appears to be a copy of their take out menu. The one thing I do have to complain about is the font size for the ramen content. My vision isn't as sharp as it used to be so, so reading small teeny tiny font was a problem. But the servers are very helpful, so they didn't seem to mind having to read the content for me.

Although there is a ramen house in the next plaza, there are a few reasons why I like this place better:

1. Price: At least for the tonkatsu ramen, the basic content includes seaweed and egg for $8.95. The other ramen house, tonkatsu ramen is the same price, but you have to add seaweed and egg costing you about $11.

2. Restaurant size: both restaurants have great atmosphere. However, Ohjah is larger that they could actually fit more tables. As for the other ramen house, I believe it can only seat 16 at tables and 8 at the bar.

There is one thing that I believe the other ramen house has over Ohjah and that is the other restaurant's soup is a little more flavorful, but not by much. 

Now as for the mochi ice cream, it isn't on the new menu, but hopefully they will add it in the future during the summer.

On my second visit, my niece and her husband were visiting us from the Arcadia/Monrovia/Azusa part of SoCal. These towns are known for their Asian restaurants and really good and cost savings. So I was a little worried as to what they would think. But they had nothing but good things to say. My nephew had the Ohjah House ramen was an oxtail ramen and included everything at a good price of $12.95. He looked very happy and content with the little beads of sweat coming down his forehead from making his own ramen extra spicy.

If my husband would let me, I would be at Ohjat on a daily basis :D

Chashu Bowl: ($4) It's basically an off menu item.  I just combined sides of chashu over a bowl of white rice.  

Ohjah Ramen: ($11.50)  From those who ordered it, they thoroughly enjoyed it.  It smelled delicious but as I did not eat it personally I can only speculate.

It's not like all the other ramen spots where there's only like 4 tables, crammed seating space and long wait times. Ohjah is actually very spacious and I've never had to wait to be seated. They also have a variety of appetizers and dishes other than ramen. 

My go-to lately has been the Ohjah Ramen with chicken broth. If you love lots of meat I highly recommend this one. You get a nice big piece of oxtail, two chashu pork slices and beef slices. Also comes with two pieces of nori and one marinated soy sauce egg. The broth is so flavorful and the ramen noodles are cooked perfectly. There's plenty of meat and noodles that I can never finish it in one sitting. 

Service is pretty good too, the workers are friendly and attentive. My friend left his debit card and didn't realize it til later in the day and decided he would pick it up the next day. When he called the worker was really nice about it and told him he can come before opening hours and they would have it for him in morning.

Two things from the appetizer list that stood out for me were the seaweed salad and the tako wasabi.

Randomly found this place while searching for places to dine outside of Las Vegas. Dining on the Strip tend to be costly since 85% of the people that go there are tourists, 10% of the people probably work there and maybe some 5% are locals that party there. That is my non-scientific prediction. LoL!

Still in Las Vegas it is about 11 miles from where we were staying at the Hard Rock Cafe on Paradise Rd. No crowds, although, I heard this place does get crowded. Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the Miso Ramen (bean sprouts for crunch, scallions for flavor, soy-cured egg half with a bouncy firmness, seaweed, wood fungus [kikurage], fish cake, chashu and ground pork topped with a square of nori on the side). So good and yummy!  Hubby enjoyed his Beef Ramen, who likes it hot and spicy, while our teen ordered her favorite shrimp tempura. 

The inside is spacious and the tables were spaced out nicely (compared to our local Ramen House Ryujin in Sacramento). The interior decor is nice and modern with Asian flair. Very clean. The service was fast. We got our food in fairly good time. The servers were friendly and attentive to our table. It was a nice treat to be able to dine here. We will certainly come back again on our next Vegas visit! The restaurant is located on the corner of a shopping plaza with plenty of parking.

Service:  We were seated immediately, ordered and the food came out quickly and with a smile.  Drinks were kept fresh and management stopped by to check on us.  Nearly identical great service that I experienced at Ohjah House #2.

Ramen & Non-Ramen:  Was feeling hungry so I went with the heavy Ohjah Ramen and resquested extra spicy: Oxtail, Beef, Chashu, Egg, Bean Sprouts, Scallion, Seaweed, Wood Fungus, & spinach.  The broth was great and not really spicey in my opinion, I gauge that by how much I sweat.  I didn't sweat much but it was still tasty and the noodles were yum.  The yaki Gyoza and fried oysters were good if you're fiending them.  The Kimcho fried rice was my favorite Non-Ramen dish, definitely ordering again.

Ambiance: Again, nearly identical to Ohjah House #2 with lots of wooden tables, walls and benches to give me that Ramen House feel I had when I visited Tokyo.  Lots of booths, tables, and a Ramen Bar to seat parties quickly.  Most good Ramen joints are notoriously associated with a lack of seating and long waits.  I'm so glad that Ohjah doesn't have that problem at either location and which is why they get the 5th star.

The OG Ohjah Noodle House set the precedence for House #2 and they're both fantastic noodle houses on opposite sides of the valley.  If you're in the area and are fiending Ramen, the OG Ohjah Noodle House and the 2nd house is the place to be.  Enjoy yourself..",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,5,5,5,j5EMeugzbyrTQMN0W_98nw

The ramen (we ordered Ohjah ramen with pork broth) was superb.  The broth was rich without being too salty, and the assortment and portion of meats and toppings made it a great value in my opinion.  I have never had oxtail in my ramen before, and it was perfect - tender, melt-in-the-mouth good.  We also ordered a number of small plates, and each one tasted as good as it was artfully presented.  Of note, the garlic edamame wasn't your typical edamame tossed with some fried garlic.  The sauce was just to die for!  

The staff was super attentive and kind even though we brought kids to the restaurant against our better judgment.  Our picky kids loved it and were entertained by the staff who were so much fun (there was dancing and ice cream involved).  

I am tired of ramen places with super tiny seating areas where you can't even try to bring kids, not to mention the long waits.  The food here is every bit as good or better as those other crazy crowded ramen bars, and the service absolutely can't be beat.  WIN.

4182703,2017-01-14,1,BEtgRzNeXGAf0uQ-HuSyfA,"I have to preface this rating with me being a bit jaded. 

This place is pretty good. Came here around 6:30pm on a Friday night and when I walked in, I was seated within seconds. The place wasn't busy at all which is weird for a Friday night in this area. The decor is really nice, and the staff is attentive. 

I ordered the Ohjah house ramen and a side of gyoza. The house ramen comes with some oxtail, some chashu pork, and all the other standard ramen stuff in (I think) a tonkatsu broth. I asked for a medium level spicy. 

The broth came out warm but not really hot. The spice was more of a pepper type spice instead of a chili type. It wasn't spicy at all, just heavily peppered. Since the broth wasn't that hot, none of the fat on the oxtail really cooked making it mostly not edible. The noodles were good, but nothing special. The gyoza were pretty decent, but the sauce that came with them was bland.

The reason I feel jaded is because there's a ramen place walking distance that's so much better. Overall, I'm undecided if I'd come back. If you want ramen, and don't want to wait an hour at the place next door, then this place is probably ok. It will suffice for a ramen craving.",1csYUsGUX4vwHH-YmRTgQg,0,0,3,tJ6TS3_m2N8Z49HpLoyang

Tan tan men was not very spicy, but they gave us some spice on the side to add on. Flavor of both broths are very deep and satisfying. It's not overly salty like some ramen places can be. Noodles have a nice bite to them and toppings included with each ramen bowl are very generous. Usually you have to add things like egg for an extra dollar, but it's included here in most choices.

I ordered the miso ramen and chicken wings. I love my food spicy so I asked if they can make it spicy. They had mild, medium and extra spicy. I had them make it extra spicy. 

The miso ramen was bland, along with the noodles. Because I ordered it extra spicy it did have a kick to it, but that's all. The chashu that came with the miso had a weird smell/taste to it. It had a pork smell/taste to it like they didn't prepare the meat prior to cooking. 

The chicken wings was not bad. Just like regular deep fried wings. Very small wings. But they were good. Crispy on the outside. Given with a sweet chili dipping sauce. 

Overall, it was quite disappointing. I may give it another chance with a different ramen off their menu. But not anytime soon.",3LNCN_aMHo97xvEFR4PhDw,2,0,3,wfdETsa8Y5VdqaeemS4zBA

Honestly one of the best noodle restaurants in SW area. When Kobo opened up next door, it was too hyped up. Given, the noodles are made fresh everyday but they don't offer any other special appetizers. The portion is small and the chashu is mostly just fat. 

I'm so happy Ohjah opened up a noodle house concept. Their oxtail is surprisingly tender and full of flavor and the noodles are cooked to perfection. The soup is delicious- never too salty or oily like other ramen/noodle spots. 

As for their appetizers, they offer a wide variety of great classic options such as Tako Wasabi, Squid Skewers (GET THE SKEWERS IT'S THE BEST!!!!) Takoyaki and fried oysters! The squid skewers are best I've had!! 

The service is always impeccable- Genie and Leo are really kind and were really attentive, contributing to our amazing experience here. Leo is so passionate about the food here he'll tell you all about how everything is made.

Came here for lunch and I ordered their special beef ramen and my friend ordered the oxtail ramen.  I ordered mine medium spicy and she ordered it hot.  Spice comes in the form of a chili oil paste thats not premixed, just on top of the soup.  So you can mix a little first to see how you like it.  I thought medium was a little too hot so I scooped out some of the chili oil.

The noodles were good and I really enjoyed their broth but I did not like the flavor or the texture of their meat.  It was thin slices of tendenous beef.  It wasn't chewy or tough but I thought it didn't go well with the broth.  Also I love the texture of soft pork belly chashu much more.  My friend's oxtail was good but again it was a little weird eating it with ramen.  It didn't seem to go together very well.  But the oxtail was cooked well and pretty tender.

I would come back again but next time I'm definitely sticking to their traditional ramen with chashu meat.  I enjoyed their broth and noodles and their ramen comes with half of a soft boiled egg which is always a bonus.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,3,3,3,OsNC-uzts2_2d1SfQQh7Uw

Luckily there was no wait time cuz there no customers. I don't know if it was just slow cuz it was a Sunday but we were excited to try the Ramen. 

To our disappointment, we actually didn't enjoy the Ramen much. The broth had an off taste. Usually when a soup is served it should be served really hot with the steam rising above the bowl buts ours did not. It was luke warm. I ordered the beef ramen and added an extra egg and bamboo shoots. I tasted the bamboo shoots alone and it tasted rancid. My sister had the tan tan Ramen Bowl and said the ground pork tasted old and gamey. 

On the up side, we ordered takoyaki as our appetizers. It was our first time trying it and it was actually tasty. I expected them to be bigger cuz the pictures on Yelp made it look huge but they were small. 

Customer service was ok. Even after we received our appetizers, we were still missing 3 plates and 3 sets of silverware so I had my son walk up to the waitress to ask her and my son brought us back all the plates and silverware to our table himself.

I have to say that when it comes to ramen, broth is one of the most important thing to me, next being the noodle. The broth is flavorful and the noodle the right texture. It is definitely one of the better ramen-offering place in the Southwest part of Las Vegas.

We at first tried the one in Henderson but the line was way too long and very busy. We then adventured to the southwest side of town and found this one busy but welcoming. Ohjah is not a huge place but big enough with about 8 tables and good vibe. We were seated and given drinks and menus right away. We ordered the Yaki Gyoza, best way to describe it is a dumpling. Had good flavor with a spicy dipping sauce. We also ordered the shrimp skewers, which resemble little lolly pops. These were quite crispy and had a spicy mayo drizzle. For the main meal I ordered the beef ramen and Josie ordered the chicken Ramen. Both are priced well and offer a full bowl of flavor. Comes with a hard boiled egg in the middle, scallions, beansprouts, seaweed and root fungus. Neither were spicy and the broth was exceptional. Not overly impressed with the noodles but we may have had a different expectation due to past experiences at other noodle spots. The staff was very attentive and had refills before being asked. 
Thank you for eating at Ohjah Noodle house. We would for sure go here again and possibly try the one in Henderson. Stop in and give it a try I am sure you will be satisfied with your decision.",QtuzG4-zmGTdB0jSMC54tg,0,0,4,Jx-8hR6d2QyNg-qUU67n_w

I ended up ordering the Ohjah House Ramen ($11.95) with black garlic oil (Additional $1.00), which came with the works (Pork, beef, and oxtail and all the added fixens). The ramen was delicious! The meat was cooked well and tasted perfect. They give you a little side dish to put leftover bones from the oxtail, as well, so they aren't left in the ramen. After finishing, I felt full without feeling like I ate too much. They gave us a little candy with the check and we left!

They have a nice variety of ramen to choose from, with very reasonable prices.  Also love how they have other appetizers and main dishes to choose from as well.  The restaurant itself is spacious and comforts ale. Staff was very attentive and friendly, not the fastest service but it's still their soft opening! 

We tried the seafood ramen, tan tan men, and ohjah house ramen. Although not stated on the menu they can customize the spice level. Medium spice here was just enough to give you nice flavor without burning you up. Mild was basically no spice. The ramen broth is creamy and hearty. Seafood ramen had a whole assortment of seafood including fish, shrimp, clams, crab legs, squid along with the veggies and seaweed. The ohjah house ramen had tender oxtail included which I was surprised to see, but great flavor!  I also commend them on the soft boiled egg which you don't have to pay extra for in there ramen.

My husband found this place because we had ox tail Ramen in Hawaii and he fell in love with it and when he found out there was a place nearby that sold it we just had to visit. As a Korean and usually ox tail soup is more of a creamy white broth.. so when the ramen came out it was surprisingly regular but it had a huge oxtail bones with plenty of meat. I personally have a spinach allergy and I asked them to remove the spinach and I am happy to note that they did exactly what I requested. 

The Ramen was really good not as good as the one in Hawaii but fairly good my husband thinks it was pretty decent and I really appreciate it how they had a lot of meat on the bone.

My thing with gyoza is I always calculate the price per gyoza (yes I'm that friend) and if it's about $1/per I won't get it since it won't be worth it price and portion. I opt out here since it was $4.75 for 5 pieces.

My friend got the TanTan Men, Bun got the Tonkatsu and I got Miso. My friend liked the TanTan Men but Bun didn't like the Tonkatsu. The most memorable item in my bowl.. was the naruto! hehe I love fishcake, it was thicker cut than normal so I was happy

The ramen itself was meh. I asked for chili oil twice - I had a feeling the first time I asked, they were intentionally hoarding it but then Bun asked for me and it was delivered - this helped made it easier for me to finish my bowl, unfortunately Bun didn't finish his haha 

The bill was split - Bun and my bowl were under $20 so it was standard. It wasn't very memorable and I wouldn't go back unless a friend picked it, or it was the only left thing around that is open. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.",cO-pVqt2ZKLItpeQZi5gjg,0,0,3,tImWQBxr1LwnOwZygVEZzw

5349093,2017-04-22,1,BEtgRzNeXGAf0uQ-HuSyfA,"My family and I came to Ohjah Noodle House for dinner last night. To be honest, I'm not a huge ramen fan so I guess you can disregard my review now.

My family shared an order of takoyaki and an order of gyoza. As for my main course, I decided to go with the Tan Tan Men. They offered different levels of spiciness for it: mild, medium, and extra spicy. I decided to go with the extra spicy because I love spicy stuff. 

The gyoza was okay. A little on the salty side. In fact, you don't even need to dip it into the soy sauce at all. Just eat it by itself. Pretty average. Nothing special. It is what you would expect it to be.

The takoyaki wasn't that great. There was nothing special about it and I've had better. It didn't come hot, which was disappointing. I usually love it when my takoyaki is served steaming hot ... because that's how its served. At Ohjah, though, it was just warm and a little on the harder side and not the soft texture like I'm used. 

Then came the Tan Tan Men. It came with a nice scoop of chili paste on top, similar to sambal. The server was really nice though; he said if it wasn't spicy enough then he'll bring me more chili paste or I could use chili powder. Well, I can say that their extra spicy wasn't really spicy. I didn't want to bother with the extra chili paste because if it really was sambal, it's not spicy. 

There were a lot of reviews stating that their extra spicy was supposed to be no joke? Maybe I came on an off day or something? Because I really didn't taste anything spicy.

As for the soup flavor, it didn't really capture me. Everything tasted pretty boring. The noodles themselves were good though .. they were cooked al dente, which is perfect!

According to my family, the oxtail is very good -- the meat is tender and has really good flavor. 

The service is pretty good though. Our server would check up on us from time to time and refilled our waters promptly.

Overall, I probably won't return. There wasn't anything that I loved :( But that's fine. I'll just stick to their hibachi locations haha.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,2,3,OmA8VYjxpHantjH3R40rUQ

It wasn't busy nor did it get busy during our time there (which would have been peak lunch time)  but I'm guessing it's because this is a little further out from the Strip.  As a result, we were quickly greeted and seated.  

Nice interior (working a/c at this time of year is also a plus).  

We ordered the takoyaki, the house fried rice, tan tan ramen and I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with an oxtail-add on.

Takoyaki was really good...but not exactly traditional in that it appeared to be...deep fried??  Interesting...so pass if you're a purist.

Fried rice was a good solid fried rice.  The chasu used was fattier (a plus in my book) rather than the lean cuts you usually see in this dish.  Great flavor, too.

Next came the noodles.  Hubby's tan tan men noodle broth was sweeter than I'm accustomed to.  He was ok with it.  He mentioned it wasn't as rich as he would like.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, however.

For my tonkotsu, I have to give a shout-out on the oxtail...very tender and generous serving.  The broth was good too, tasting of pigs feet and bones. The chasu was cooked very tender.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the noodles.  They used thin noodles which I approve of but the texture of these particular noodles were more like somen.  No bite.

I ordered the Ohjah Ramen and boy, it was yummy! The portion was huge, as well as the broth ratio and the meat items that it came with. The flavor of the broth was rich and not oily at all.  I enjoyed this place so much!!!",ZgoGr28ZviYWTlwFkqblCw,0,0,4,Iqg5IRQv_IbFdcDxLbG7XQ

Been here twice so far and I am happy that we finally have a good ramen place near our house! My favorite is still in Chinatown, but this is a good option for days that we don't have time to drive down there. 

The menu is similar to other ramen places - you get to choose your ramen and have the option to add additional toppings as well as extra noodles. They also have fried rice and fried noodles, appetizers and side dishes. So far I have tried the Shoyu and Miso Ramen. The Shoyu was good, but my favorite is the Miso because the broth was rich and very flavorful. I usually avoid drinking too much of any ramen broth for obvious reasons, but just had to take a few sips of this one since it was so good!

Service is excellent! The staff here are very friendly and attentive. They check up on you a few times so you can really tell that they care and want to provide great service. One drawback though, is that they don't have curry. I think a side curry bowl on the menu would be awesome! Definitely returning.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,8,5,5,OiqncKIeal6m8UbiVtI9Ww

The staff was wonderful, the meal was amazing and they accommodated my ""keto diet"" needs by substituting the rice and/or noodles for more proteins. I will definitely go back and highly recommend this place.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,0,0,5,FLzKPFidrr1rmXxuWwuwOQ

I thought that was unique! Never seen oxtail in ramen before. It was delicious,OBzQJQABBDbB1wX1j1rk1g,0,0,5,5_v5eobku5e-oNZCDuibhw
5957612,2017-08-07,0,BEtgRzNeXGAf0uQ-HuSyfA,"I have never been one for ramen. My go-to was Monta and even then it's either alright or a salty surprise -- lame. This place is pretty good. I got the Ohjah House Ramen with the pork broth. It's rich, savory, and the veggies give the broth a nice tinge of freshness. They have oxtail as a topping and I love oxtail! I thought it might be like a scrawny piece but nah it was pretty fat.

Our servers were sweet to us too. I think their names were Holly and Diana. We were indecisive and they were accomodating; even making suggestions on what they liked and not just pointing out the expensive items.

Definitely will come back!",L_EnBdQRMwdTZtO0t4HO5A,2,1,5,HS6F3588d-VlJkjXp0Hm3Q

Let's just say I'm glad that a shower was near the toilet... not quite food poisoning but enough to ruin my morning.",VyHwzcanJpLZya1aG60W_A,0,0,2,6FAEHKVebTlGxJBBwjvbuQ
