Here's why:

1)  The best Kalua pork in the valley.  It was so flavorful and tender.  Order it with cabbage, the crunch adds a wonderful bite to this mouthwatering dish.

2)  Chicken Katsu is also quite good.  Not too oily or greasy, and the right amount of salt made this Katsu a great entree.  

3)  Clean store and friendly staff who are happy to walk those unfamiliar to Island fare through the tasty options on the menu.

4)  Great Value!!  You can get heaps of great food for a very reasonable price, and if you aren't in the mood for a big portion, they offer mini-sized orders, perfect for ladies and skinny wussies.....(Ok, perfect for everyone)

46. Aloha Saimin

Mini size means one scope of rice and

1231488,2015-01-23,1,8L_eeOwZryvlUEO42Zq8nQ,"While returning from a recent trip to Hawaii, my husband and I saw an ad in the in-flight magazine for the ramen burger at L&L. We were intrigued, so I HAD to stop to try one when I passed the local L&L here in Vegas.

I've eaten at L&L before, but I've never had their burger, let alone their ramen burger. The burger itself was a pleasant surprise. Not sure if it had loco moco gravy on it or something else, but there was a tasty sauce that was pretty addictive. The meat was sandwiched between two huge fried ramen patties, which took the role of the bun. This is a pretty ingenious idea, but it didn't quite work because the ratio was off. If each patty were half its size, it would have been a lot better, but there was way too much ramen in relation to the meat.

So the ramen burger was a one-trick pony, but what about the other food at L&L? As I said, on this visit, I only had the burger (which I brought home to share with my spouse). But they offer a slew of other Hawaiian favorites, like short ribs, saimin, and chicken katsu. I like their Spam musubi, and I think next time I'll get the loco moco (double rice, no mac salad) because that was some good brown gravy.

If you're missing Hawaii and find yourself here on the Ninth Island, L&L offers a little taste of aloha. And they offer ""mini"" portions of most dishes, which is both cost- and waistline-friendly!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,1,3,j81i-FydHgpzcXeONTYrKA

I've learned when you're visiting Las Vegas, you need to find some balance.  Last night and into the morning it was all about a pub/casino crawl between joints on Fremont Street.  Today, it was an arduous hike and rock scramble in the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.  

Headed back to the strip, the idea of grub from L&L Hawaiian crept into my head.  A back and forth chat with snarky Siri (who seems to get bitchy when you yell at her) sent us to this L&L, which isn't far from Red Rock Canyon (and is located across Charleston Blvd. and Red Rock Casino).  

This operation is Asian owned and operated, which is a plus in my book.  The line cooks can easily be seen behind a low counter making food to order.  It takes just enough wait time to make you believe your food was cooked to order (and not just reheated). I ordered a ""mini"" BBQ chicken, which was given a complimentary super-sized upgrade to full plate meal.  Score!  The food was tasty as expected and hit the spot after a long desert hike.  

If you want to make your meal a little heathier, they will substitute brown rice for white and veggies (mainly broccoli) for the macaroni salad, which tends to be hit and miss for taste anyway.  They also serve a number of Asian inspired dishes (from their own menu) such as chicken pot stickers.

The bento box was really goood. It came with four different kinds of meat, rice, and macaroni salad. All the meats were delicious, even the fried stuff wasn't very greasy. I did not try the macaroni salad --- I dislike items that taste like mayonnaise (IMHO). Thankfully, they kept the mac salad in a separate container so that it would not touch any of the food that I actually wanted to eat. This will def be my go-to here.

The seafood platter, which included scallops, mahi mahi, fried shrimp, rice, and mac salad, was alright. It didn't come with as much food as the bento combo, but it was the same price. You always have to pay more for seafood though. The scallops tasted soft with a nice, crispy breading. I liked the mahi-mahi too--very fresh tasting. I did not taste the shrimp.

PROS:
-Refillable drinks
-Plenty of seats (for a small place), some booths too
-Food was served quickly
-Good service overall
-Food comes in to-go boxes (but not biodegradable ones)

The one aspect of the visit that I disliked was that that they did not close the door even though it was windy outside. I was sitting by the door and got chills every so often. I got over it as the wind died down though.

My mom n brother got the short ribs and said it tasted like they dipped the ribs soy sauce. I will never know what they taste like, but I do remember what Aloha Kitchen's ribs tasted like and they were off the hook!

I give this location a 2 because I was dissapointed in the battered shrimp. At other L&L locations it came without the batter.

5556318,2017-05-17,1,8L_eeOwZryvlUEO42Zq8nQ,"Been going here for years since it's near my house but today will be my last visit. I was trying to find a place to eat for lunch after I got out of class and since I haven't been here in a long time I decided to go and try their Chicken Katsu Curry with Brown Rice.

First off, what's been putting me off of going to this place all the time is how you can taste the oil in the food that gives off this fishy taste and how their katsu can get very crunchy and inedible sometimes.  Today I opened my food and was already disgusted with how it looked. The curry was just splattered all on top of the katsu that it was just drenched in it. I at least like to have some crunch when I eat katsu but the chicken was already soggy by the time I got home to eat it. I did finish the plate since I didn't want to have wasted my money. But as I write this review, I still feel gross after eating it and after reading the other reviews, I feel even more gross knowing how people got food poisoning from their chicken, yuck! 

Also, I agree that their customer service has never been great at all. Today while I was waiting for my to-go order, a lady and her kid came in to order and asked the cashier if he knows when a table will free up. First off, it's first come first serve and it gets pretty packed for lunch time so of course the tables will be filled. But then I heard the cashier point at me while I was waiting for my food in a booth and said, ""Well I know she's leaving so you can take her seat."" Umm... when did I say I was going to take the food to-go? What if I wanted to stay there? He basically kicked me out my seat and offered it to the other customer. I felt that this was very unprofessional and rude.

You can definitely get better food and better customer service elsewhere. I understand it's cheap but you do get what you pay for if you eat here.",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,3,0,1,TMqjwcuCJq9_8ez1wvqWQg

5752718,2014-09-22,0,8L_eeOwZryvlUEO42Zq8nQ,"Finally getting around to reviewing this little fast food-y joint that is fast becoming a regular lunch spot for me.  Good Asian near West Summerlin appears to be a rare commodity and, this modern Hawaiian being a close facsimile to Japanese comfort food in a way, L&L is most welcome.  I have been here 3 times now, and I have not had a bad dish yet.  Everything thus far is more than adequate, and deserving of more than the 3.5 stars it averages on Yelp.

I have had the chicken katsu, fried shrimp, and hamburger steak plates.  They come with rice and pasta salad on the side.  The katsu is crispy and well-cooked, although the meat is a bit thin so they have to be careful not to over-fry.  They do a good job.  The shrimp is appropriately battered, not too much or too little, and perfectly crispy.  The hamburger steak is the real winner, however.  What looks like a couple of regular hamburger patties come full of that Japanese Hamburger Steak flavor, drenched in gravy and all satisfaction.  If you are not familiar with the flavor of Japanese Hamburger steak, it's very distinct from the taste of American burger patties.  Not sure what's in it, probably nothing good, but boy does it taste good.  Bentoss next to Mitsuwa in Costa Mesa is a great example.  The only thing missing here at L&L is a side of kimchi, but this isn't a Korean place so...

The service is on the pleasant side, although I wouldn't say it's gold-star material.  You do have to wait a bit for your food (5-10 min), and while there are plenty of seats it fills up quickly.  This will be my regular spot for lunch, and looking forward to trying a number of other items, including the ramen burger and some of their Hawaiian dishes.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,0,0,4,Cvp6IUxMWCoSe6ugKf4ung

5918525,2011-09-02,2,8L_eeOwZryvlUEO42Zq8nQ,"I used to have L & L Hawaiian BBQ about once a week in California, it was hard to drive past L&L on the way home each day without your craving getting the better of you.  But the food I used to get at the one in Fremont were great.  Their Hawaiian BBQ Chicken was always double if not a triple.  When I went to get some frozen yogurt at Cherry On Top and saw L&L just a short stroll across the parking lot, my mind was set.

After checking out the familiar menu, I went with the BBQ Combo.  The food was prepared quickly and I was out the door in minutes.  The smell was good, and it took some self restraint to not dig in while I drove home.  Unfortunately, the BBQ chicken that has always been a favorite of mine, was no where close to what I was used to getting.  Flavor was dulled, like a number 2 pencil after a hundred questions scantron test.  The BBQ Beef was okay.  The Short Rib likewise was okay, never as good as the ones you grill yourself at a Korean BBQ.  The Mac Salad was the same as what But I hate to think that I have to cross the state line just to get some decent Hawaiian BBQ Chicken from L & L.

Anyway, this location is fairly small.  Not a lot of room to sit and eat, but many take their orders to go.  Location is fairly convenient for those in the SW (near Costco), and parking wasn't an issue.  I just wish the food tasted better.

I would love to rate this L & L Hawaiian BBQ with at least a 3 stars (A-OK), but it just fell short of that mark.  Hopefully it was just an off day for them, but with other better Hawaiian BBQ restaurants in close proximity, I doubt I will give them another shoot.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,3,1,2,PD-BqIrocC0hphwNnryBuA

My favorite Hawaiian restaurants are far away from where I live, so this place is actually more convenient. What I like most about this location is that it is very clean. Most L&Ls that I have been to in Hawaii and California were kind of ghetto looking. I also like that they are open 7 days a week.

They don't have too many tables in the restaurant, so I usually order to go. My favorite is the Kalua Pork and Lau Lau plate, which are the two Hawaiian food items I miss the most. Unfortunately, they don't taste as good as back home, but sacrifices must be made, right? At least we HAVE Hawaiian food in this city. I also like the Chicken Katsu and the BBQ Mix plates. Portions are generous, I get pretty full with the mini plates. The Spam Musubi is okay. I wish they wouldn't be so stingy with the spam though. There is always too much rice and a thin slice of spam. I'm not a good cook at all, but even I make better Spam Musubis at home, LOL. Also, don't order the saimin because the broth has no flavor at all. Trust me, you are better off making instant ramen at home!

Customer service here has improved a lot. One of the reasons why I didn't like coming here in the past was because the cashiers were very rude. No ""hello"" or ""thank you"" ever. Just a ""Can I take your order?"" However, the cashiers are now much more friendly. The wait times for the food is pretty short and reasonable.
