The girls gave him attitude the last two times and said ""why dont you order online for large orders?"". Well, tonight we decided to order online. I was a little frustrated as you cannot order quesadillas online. I scheduled my pick up to be 6pm. I got to the store about 5 minutes early. I saw the staff working on the order. I went to the cashier and asked, is this the order for **** - she said yes. I said ok, I wanted to order 4 cheese quesadillas but there was no where to order online. She looked at the gentleman standing next to her and he said oh we are super busy - you need to go to the line.. Mind you the line was long and going very slow. Also, the thing they used to make the quesadillas was sitting behind the gentleman. Well - 20 minutes in line and i was finally able to order the quesadillas. I got back up to the cashier and the gentleman put my bags from the online order on the counter. I reached in the bags and all the items were COLD. I said to him, all this food is cold! He said well we made it to be ready for you on time. I said I understand that but you said I had to go in line. He could care less that the food was cold and brushed me off. No discount or nothing was offered. At this point I was furious as I just spent over $80 on cold food. When I got the food home and my family unwrapped their food, the tacos were soggy and fell apart, the burritos were soggy and fell apart.. it was a mess and I only live across the street.. I will never go to this Chipotle again as the staff is extremely rude. Like I said, this was not the 1st encounter my family has had with the rude staff there. We did not eat the food and ended up having to go pick up $5 pizzas from little cesars.

The lady said we needed to be charged for the kids meal because we didn't have the child with us. Then they had the nerve to speak to each other in Spanish about the kids meal ordeal. Just because I'm of different ethnicity, don't assume we can't speak Spanish and don't talk s*** in front of customers in a different language. As we were at the register they informed us that we had to pay for the kids meal. We showed the child and asked if there was a issue, they told us no and said that the kids meal is normally for older children, granted the child was a little over 1. I don't see anything wrong with feeding mashed beans to a 1 year old. Also I didn't see that there was a stipulation to the age of a child to qualify for a kids meal. After we settled that issue, the guy at the register came up to us and stated our card was declined so we showed our receipt and cleared up that issue. I observed if he was going to ask the customers before and after us but he didn't. Very rude and very unprofessional.

Ridiculous!  But that wasn't all. My burrito was wrapped into the shape of a bloated square basically. Not long and rectangular-like like any other burrito I've ever seen but like a bloated square that I couldn't even get my mouth around to eat.

We've been here a couple of times, and both times were really good. The front counter area is well-organized and fully stocked with items (chips, boxes, catering supplies). Chipotle is pretty much a staple for our family, and we usually visit a couple weekends a month. If we miss it, my hubby gets withdrawals. Yes, really.

The food trays were filled halfway or more (a good sign, more fresh). More food prep and cooking was under way (sizzling, mmm). The staff is nice. This is a clean restaurant overall. Music is playing (twice, one type for the customers, one type for the employees making the food). We've chosen the same booth for both past visits, near the counter. This location is sort of bare-bones (but that's ok) with overall decor, not much is hanging on the walls. Most locations are industrial- feeling with exposed pipe type ceilings, a mix of metal and unfinished natural wood (the one @ Decatur/Sahara is a good representation of most restaurants in this chain). 

My favorite bowl is composed of: white rice, either Chorizo or Chicken, depending on my mood, black beans, fajita veggies, corn, some cheese, some sour cream, and lettuce. I used to get salsa but I split the bowl with my son, and he said it was ""too hot."" Sometimes, I get it on the side. I was just thinking that my son must be growing up because he hasn't been saying ""Mum-mum"" which is his code phrase for ""More, please."" But I heard it yesterday, so, it was a highlight, to hear it. He loves Chipotle. Once he hears we're going, he thinks we're going right then and there. It is a joy when our picky eater can eat something with such ferocity and enthusiasm.  

Also does online ordering and catering. I'm trying to figure which one will be our go-to in our new area, so this could be the one. It's a good thing, it's not super busy.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,4,oTsZjl3CMmbm1PPg9oKLjA

It was a technicality for over charging me.  It doesn't even come out of the store, it's Chipotle company deals for members.   I came in today, because I wanted to use my BOGO before it expires.  I also have been waiting to try out the online order.  I normally order in person two entrees with guacamole on the side with the meals.  When I did the order online, it asks me if I wanted my guacamole on the side, I clicked on it.  When I came into the store, I noticed I was charged a little more with my BOGO.  It wasn't half the bill.  She charged me for 2 entrees with two side orders of guacamole instead of guacamole within my entree.  When I look online on my order receipt, it's shown the guacamole is within the entree not a side order.  I told her that, she said I can't order like that.  Next time order with the guacamole and side note to type there I want it on the side.  I told here there isn't a section to do that.  She kept telling me there is one.  I can't be crazy....I just checked before writing this review... there isn't a section for that.  All of this for $1.95 guacamole.  I told her ok whatever.  It's a simple fix, it's a technicality charge.  What pissed me off even more, when I got home, one of my entree was missing cheese.... I would say the communication with the online order is not good experience.  I was overcharged more  for technicality and my order isn't correct.  Good thing, she checked the order again before handing it to me, because there was a missing guacamole.  

That's one.... now a week ago I was here again.  I came in with no one in front of me ordering.  But right after I ordered one burrito and a bowl, the line started to build up.  I can tell the server started to get irritated while she was doing me order.  It was the fajita veggies on both entrees that got me.  It was old looking and empty, the girl literally grabbed one bell pepper and 3 onion stings for the burrito and the same for the bowl.  I even asked her can I have a little more and she just added 2 onion stings... can't she just grab a fresh one?  Then she turned around and yelled at her coworkers, ""I need help!""  Every ingredients they had were low, they made my two entrees really light than usual, I didn't bother to keep asking for more for every ingredient.  

I'm going to go to the other location on Rainbow to try it out.  It's too bad that this location is convenience because it's by our mailbox.  But you go where it makes you happy.",MMxRLgkd-MgwowmggmR2Dg,3,2,2,r1mJtNHgxXEYTSEUgFzS-g

However the last few times I have been there have not been a good experience or value. I generally have rice, no beans, vegetables and lettuce. When I asked for extra white rice I was told that they were only allowed three scoops and that was it, when I asked for extra lettuce (one of the cheapest items of the selections), they gave me a very small handful. I had to come home and cut up my own lettuce! I was treated rudely when I asked for extra vegetables, because that's all I eat. I was not allowed to have a tortilla on the side as I usually am. My vegetable Bowl costs within a few cents the same as a bowl full of meat and high-cost items. My daughter-in-law ordered a baracoba bowl and and the meat was all fat.
