1259,2016-10-24,1,JgkfjCL1NfMBC_M_hax_3Q,"Extremely overpriced for the amount of food you get. I used to go here all the time. The food was delicious. 

What changed was the portion of food. Most places increase prices when they need to. Not this place. No, what they did here is a disgusting disservice to the customer. They instead lessened the portion of the food by more than twice it was. It's less than the kids portion compared to some places. Yes! So now if you want the similar portion that you had before, then you have to pay for it twice. I think it would still be less than what one portion was though. Which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced. 

For example, the last time I went here I had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam. I asked for no beef and replace with more spam. This is what I usually used to get. So you know what they gave me? 2 tiny pieces of spam! The chicken portion was also minuscule. And a tiny scoop of rice too, not even a whole scoop. 

I eat at many places in Vegas and around the country as I travel all the time. I mostly use yelp to give great reviews for amazing places that need more attention from customers. This place though, I logged in for the first time in a long time to give this one star review. It is that bad compared to what they used to be. It is way more expensive than every Manhattan non-waiter place I have been to, along with Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Miami, Toronto, etc. 

Guys, if this portion issue has changed please let me know. I will then try it again and see for myself and update my review accordingly. I used to love this place, but now it just still gets me mad when I think about what I paid for and then got.

UPDATE: May 2017
I want back again to see if they changed anything. I went back again to see if it was a fluke. It looks like they did raise the portions. Not as big as it used to be but this is much better then before where I gave a one star review. Food was still delicious!",0M5eh7SDDq8sXQE3GpKGdA,2,0,4,yR-eN8-u4FTHIaaZgccLtw

Brought a katsu/kalua pig mixed plate back to the office one day and everyone wanted to try some on first scent.

The teri chicken/teri beef plate was a general favorite along with the aforementioned katsu/kalua plate.  My favorite though, was the fried rice omelette.

I've eaten at Aloha kitchen at least 6 times over the last three years.  It's a decent place - reasonable prices ( I've never spent more than $10 ) good service and the food is good - somewhat standard hawaiian fare so for me, since trying island flavor, i have to consider Aloha kitchen to be a cut below( i dig Island Flavor ! ) 

went with the terriyaki chicken plate - prefer to have two scoops of mac salad to the 2 scoop rice they give you ( and i asked for 2 mac instead of the rice ... oh well )

I live about 20 minutes away. By the time I got home and started eating my food I noticed that the spam was old and crunchy. The beef teri was also old and tough. The only thing decent was the chicken and mac salad. It was already too late and too far away for me to get a refund or have them make me another local plate so I decided to save it until the next day. I couldn't stop by early enough on my way into work so it wasn't until later in the evening and I attempted to get at least another musubi and beef teri. I was told that it was already too late and I had already eaten the food. They could have at least given me another spam musubi.,DH7g78KUwFA8ceNk_mQ9zw,0,0,1,2iBt5OVUeEY6IGM84YSy4g

My Bestie and I walk in around 5:45 pm and wait about 5 minutes in line to place my order. No biggie. It was pretty busy in there. I place my order of Two Saimen soups, Loco moco and lumpia at 5:50 pm.   My bestie places her order of a Mixed plate right after me. As we sit down and wait at a table my Bestie gets informed that they were out of beef for the day. So she negotiates an alternative and we proceed to wait. As we wait a couple orders a wonton soup and combo plate and they sit down. More people are served thru the line when about 6pm a large family comes in that knows one of the cashiers and places an order. In their order there were two Saimen soups, a wonton soup and a Loco moco. Guess who gets their food first? Yep not me or the couple after us. My bestie received her food, and the couple received their combo plate but we had to wait for them to serve their ""friends"" first before we got our soups. The couple complains to the cashier around 6:20 by this time they have been waiting 25 minutes and we have been waiting 30. They get the manager on the phone who offers them a refund but the cashier can't do it because it was on a card... in all this we are still waiting for our soups. She finally gets my order ready places it on the counter... It sits there. I have to go up to her and ask her if that is my order. She gives me a sacastic yes. When I told her that I have been wait for over 40 minutes she barked an apology and said there is nothing else she can do. When we pointed out that the large family that was almost done with their meal got served before us with the same food she said again ""all I can say is sorry, nothing else I can do.""

Bf told me to get adobo fried rice. I didn't listen since I was in the mood for some fried chicken katsu and kahlua pig. I was not impressed with kahlua pig and had hoped for a slightly bigger serving of fried chicken goodness. The kahlua pig was a bit salty and hard to eat but the katsu made up for it. 

I did manage to sneak about 3/4s of a spam musubi in. That was delicious.. The sauce was nice, sweet and thick. 

Fortunately, the bf decided to order the adobo fried rice omelette to take home. I ate it the next day and grumbled my regrets about the previous night's decision.

ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE IS A MUST. Fried rice mixed with delicious adobo pork. The pieces of pork was delicious and slightly reminded me of carnitas. The rice was wrapped in a thin layer of egg, kinda like a wrap.

It tastes like everything I ate when I was in Hawaii.  YUM!

Over the past 8 or so months they have frequently been out of basic food items. Like mixed vegetables often, and curry frequently, and chicken. Yup, one day they did not have chicken at lunch time. And the microwave has been broken for the past I don't now how long, so many things that should not be microwaved anyway that are on the menu are not available.

In the past 6 months they got themselves a new cook/manager. The women at the front have since changed again and again. And now this guy is up front a lot. And he is aggressive and ornery. Today was our last day setting foot in this place. We approached the counter after waiting patiently, and he instantly demanded to know if I was paying cash or credit. Then he chastised me for not ordering correctly (we always order the same thing and he knows it). 

There's an L&L on Nellis and Sahara. They are really nice and professional. And they have poke. They are never out of basic stuff.

I've been here only on two occasions, but I do have plans to go back and try them again since they are so convenient. I think the convenience factor for me is the best part of this establishment. Considering there is nothing but fast food around my house, this place IS a nice refreshing way to get food fast.

Thus far I have had the Mahi Mahi & Katsu Combo Plate and the Kalua Pork/Katsu combo. I think it's hard to make bad katsu, so I don't have any issues with their katsu chicken. The Kalua Pork I had was pretty damn good, although maybe I tad too salty for me to eat the whole thing. However, it was juicy, hot and delicious. As for the mahi mahi, I was kind of disappointed. Maybe the way they do their mahi mahi is just not my thing, but I really did not enjoy it.

As for the sides, they're usually okay. Macaroni and salad is kinda hard to screw up. But sometimes I find their rice to be mooshy and not very good.

4720983,2017-05-20,0,JgkfjCL1NfMBC_M_hax_3Q,"My wife and I have limited experience with Hawaiian food, so we decided to give this place a try. We have an L&L near us that we go to once in a while and it's decent, but I saw this place on Yelp and decided to try something new. It was a mixed bag, though I think I would go back and just order some different items.

The main reason I went here was to try the adobo fried rice omelet. Though we also got loco moco, the local plate and a side of kimchi.

The fried rice omelet was hands down the best thing and the only thing we ordered I would get again. The omelet name is a little misleading, as its just a huge pile of Hawaiian pork fried rice wrapped in a very thin layer of scrambled egg. The flavor is much meatier and the consistency is more dense than typical Chinese fried rice. For the price ($8) this was a very good meal.

If you have never had loco moco, its a pile of white rice with a burger patty and eggs on top, then smothered in gravy. Its a simple, but very good meal. The one we got from here was OK, but nothing made it stand out and I could have easily recreated it in my kitchen.

The local plate is a great deal. Two spam musubi (meat on white rice, wrapped in seaweed), beef and chicken teriyaki, along with white rice and macaroni salad, all for $8.50. The musubi was fairly good, but the teriyakis were both mediocre. They tasted like plain grilled meat that had been smothered in a teriyaki sauce that was too sweet and thick. The mac salad was very good though (better than L&L's).

The Kimchi was a waste of $2.50. It tasted like it came out of a jar and wasn't worth it.

Anyway, I feel like we just ordered the wrong things. This place was consistently busy when I was there and everyone seemed happy with their food. I heard their short ribs and katsu are good, so maybe I'll give those a try next time.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,3,-KfG5rldFOWNMs-0OBogfQ

The food is pretty good.  They do serve a lot of authentic typical hawaiian barbeque type of dishes that you'd expect from an L&L or Ohana Hawaii BBQ place. Spam Musubi, Macaroni Salad, beef, chicken, and pork pieces, scoops of rice. saimin I think as well.

But this place is unique, and is known especially for their adobo fried rice omelet (a giant omelet stuff with fried rice and adobo pork [stuffed as if it were a turkey filled with stuffing]) and their oxtail soup.  The omelet is great the first time, but it's nothing that special.  It's nice to try just to say that you tried it, but I stay away from it because of its price.  The oxtail soup is also something not really special, unless you've never tried it before and would like to give it a try.

They have special student-i.d. meal deals, which is nice as long as you don't forget your school i.d., and you can refill your drinks by yourself, which is nice as well (compared to some places where you have to ask the cashier to refill your drink for you).

Thus, I give this place a solid 4 stars.  After trying Aloha Kitchen's specialties, this place isn't anything super special.  I'd rather go to Ohana Hawaiian Barbeque where it's more affordable, and just as good (if not better) tasting.",Z5W8LdQCIehuDBRiXuvtYQ,0,2,4,WbfrZth-tqupHlByEMj5-Q

I was most definitely a fan. If I ever roll through Vegas again, I will pop on a grass skirt and go for another plate of mystery meat.",igZHqUx_Oxjo4O41hSNkrA,0,1,4,q0esRVWHrZ6vkr5J-p53jw

Aloha has a all the standard Hawaiin eats and a couple other quirky items to add to their menu. 

Very good cheap eats. 

They also have a pool hall karaoke bar connected to it.",pDfL8xt8F8ls0-kQIG_ADg,0,1,4,WXYvCVlgej2ak-OMbDjvww

decided to take a trip to aloha kitchen for loco moco and masubi. their food hit the spot, fo sho, though it's not the best i've ever had. just enough to reawaken my love for carbs. :)

it was clean and simple. there is a karaoke lounge attached to it that had awesome happy hour. definitely somewhere cheap to go if you're in the area (leaves you more money to gamble away!).",fQuLe-KuojSco4DRbcFpGw,3,3,3,wYgGjX9qWZ0ZlGAyNinM7w

On my 2 separate trips here, I've seen roaches in this place on BOTH occasions. Need I say more?",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,2,0,1,qnRj__i92S8ux9DnYf2llA
