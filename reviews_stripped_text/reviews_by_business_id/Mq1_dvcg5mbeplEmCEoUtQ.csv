It's kind of out of the way, but completely worth it!  We went for lunch and the bruschetta appetizer was great.  The tomatoes were sweet even though they aren't in season.  I had the fettuccine primavera with olive oil and garlic.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly and the flavor was great.  One of my companions said the lasagna was the best he's ever had.  Another person in the party also went traditional with the fettuccine alfredo and said the sauce was creamy and cheesy without being too heavy.  We shared a tiramisu for desert which is homemade and perfect.  This small, obviously family-owned restaurant is a hidden gem.  It was casual enough to be comfortable, but still boasted cloth table clothes.  The service was really good also.  Hurray for supporting local small businesses and getting great food in the process.",dPPGxd7ULazi4uqvsTC4fw,1,0,5,NugHClWGEBKbUMm6yDcULg

Things started off poorly with a waiter who was Mr. Sarcastic.  We weren't  starving so we ordered a Caesar salad and dinner to share.  The salad was decent enough.  But dinner...ziti with sausage, eggplant and peppers...was almost inedible. The sauce tasted like it had been cooking for a week, thick and bitter, with too much sauce to pasta balance.  The few slices of sausage were pan fried and overcooked prior to adding it to the dish. The eggplant was practically non-existent.  A couple of wimpy slices of green pepper.

Could not wait to try.  The few times I was going to be in the area was always a Sunday, when they are closed. That is why it took me so long to go there.  

When I finally had the opportunity the food was just okay and the server was unwilling to recommend.  He actually asked me how he would know what item I would prefer.  

I had expected a wonderfully cheerful, friendly experience, based on the commercial.  I believe the owner or manager was there and visiting with another table with the kind of experience I anticipated, we however did not even get a hello.    Luckily, I had a friend in from out of town.

I had the chicken parm and the sauce was good - the breading was not good - it was not crispy it was mushy. You get a tiny bit of pasta next to it and I was hungry 2 hours later. I am sorry but everyone kept saying how this was the best Italian joint in Vegas and it just can't be.

I went bec someone recommended it to a family member and there were 6 of us. The other 5 dishes were pasta dishes and ravioli which looked decent, How the hell do you not have meatballs???? Chicken Parm and dishes with cheese on them need to be under the broiler longer so they can crisp up a bit. This mush parm and chicken breading are not very good - ruins the whole dish.

The comment saying they just ate in Italy and now here and it was just as good? LOL seriously? Not buying that one bit,",mtPe2hWrB3G9_q0ZtbSW9g,0,0,2,Ebl_HlaNCCSPwV4kMWPzJw

It is about 5 miles from the ""strip"" and the drive is well worth it.  Be sure to ask owner Pietro to share his social views with you, and trust waiter Louie's recommendations.   I was there with a party of 18 Italian Americans, mostly from New York, New Jersey & Pennsylvania, who thoroughly enjoyed the authentically prepared food.

704703,2012-02-15,0,Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ,"Definitely - As Good As It Gets - Including comparing their food to the many meals I ate in Italy two years ago. Actually, I think this is better. Treated myself and went there for lunch just yesterday - It was Valentine's Day. I was not disappointed.

At first, when I heard their ad on the radio, I was intrigued and kept thinking, ""I must try that place"", but it took a few tries as each time I went there they were closed - on vacation or something plus I found out they close for lunch on Mondays. Finally, I got lucky - went there and was so impressed that I've gone back a few times within 2 months. Highly recommended in all respects - decor, quality of food and wine, good diverse menu, great service and nice atmosphere.

 Without a doubt, the best Sicilian/Italian food that I've found here in the valley - Las Vegas or Henderson - and I've tried many. I'm very particular about marinara sauce and because it's so hard to find a good one, I usually don't order it, but my friend decided to, so of course I had to have a taste. I was blown away - Surprisingly, very very good as is everything I've had so far. Yesterday I had mussels and Capellini (they switched from Linguini at my request) and OMG!!! Then there's the fresh baked bread and their house salad with raisins - The best dressing. Just writing this, I think I'll have to go back again soon. MMmmmmmm.....

The only suggestion I would make would be to have the choice of less expensive wine by the glass - I always enjoy a glass of wine with a good meal, whether it be with lunch or at dinner. If you're with friends ordering a bottle is no problem but when you're alone, lunch gets pricey @ $10.95 per glass, even if it is good wine.

But, at the end of the day, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly and I will surely return often and on special occasions.",NXkPZEbCbZuAjIf48YWPWw,0,0,5,u8SdtyNe4GlNo2YRauivYg

The first time, my date was carded, which is fine, but her ID was taken and inspected away from the table. The server, the manager and another server all stood in a huddle away across the restaurant within sight and openly laughed. No idea why. Very impolite and unprofessional. 

The second time the server was arrogant and tried too hard to ""relax"" us. He was trying to control the atmosphere of the meal more than I like in service. When I attempted to order an appetizer with my wine on his first visit,  he chastised me and told me to slow down and relax. We hadn't eaten all day, not that he took the time to find that out. He was too busy telling us how to dine there. 

Both times the food did not make up for the service.

Being a New Yorker at heart I say to you that this is like a NY neighborhood Italian place. I swear it is like ""Mama"" cooking in the kitchen.
Start with a fine Sicilian appetizer like Caponata Siciliana. The olives and peppers are mixed and seasoned just right. Move on to something like Angel Hair Pomodoro or maybe Lobster Ravioli with a choice of sauces. The menu of Italian Specialties is extensive. I've had most of them and find them all wonderful. I also like the salads that are cold and fresh. My favorite I must confess is the Siciliana which is fresh tomatoes, red onions, kalamata olives, oregano, and pure flavorful olive oil. 
The Sicilian Ristorante is beautifully decorated. It is clean and well kept. The Wait Staff are all pleasant, knowledgeable, and quick. There is a wonderful wine list to choose from or get a suggestion that is always a great bet.
I suggest a reservation for dinner.
Be prepared to leave very full.",3WHmc6WQ_jk_fIp-dJDKyA,1,1,5,A0HyK2sUEq8iQ02i3asIWw

I asked for a single scoop of chocolate ice cream and was brought out a giant glass of it. $18 for something I didn't want and left 3/4 of it cause only wanted small portion.

The personal pizzas my wife and oldest son had underwhelmed - they found them a little dull.

Two other sons were happy with their salmon, and lobster ravioli, respectively.

My wife & i both enjoyed our house merlot.

The service was quite good from start to finish. Our waiter was personable, responsive and attentive, as was his busgirl assistant.

The chicken carciofi ( I think that's how you spell it) is the best Italian dish I have ever had, they also have many ""signature"" dishes you can only find there. 
Howie (Wilfredo) is our usual sever and recognizes us when we come in, he is really a fun guy to have serve your food. The owner is there frequently and is a really great guy as well. I will be coming here until I leave Vegas, it's my favorite restaurant here for sure. 
There house salad dressing is awesome, the fresh baked bread tastes as good as it sounds and the desert is great each time.

The escargot was EXCELLENT. The sauce was incredible, and the garlic was plentiful. 

My chicken parmigiana was very tender, and they managed to not overdo the cheese, a common pitfall of many restaurants serving this dish. 

The shrimp francesca sauce was delicious. The lobster ravioli had great flavor and texture.

And finally, the creme brulee. Excellent. No complaints here.

Service was up to par. The waiter staff was very attentive and friendly. Our own waiter was a little strange, but he was nice.

The server was very excellent. My daughter insists I mention that the Olive Garden would have been better. The Lasagne tasted like sauce out of a can that had set out for days with low grade hamburger mixed in. The very thin layer of cheese on top was so thin it was nearly flavorless and what flavor was there was not a good one. The bread that came with the meal was less than average. The salad was bland. The garlic bread was a celebration of overpowering garlic assaulting my mouth. The funky cheese on that garlic bread polluted the flavor.

1612500,2017-08-31,0,Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ,"Most certainly recommended. 

I was certain I was on the true path when Fragranza di Garlic enveloped me the instant I stepped inside the front doors. The overall aroma instantly flashed-me-back to my Aunt Maria's Queens apartment where, every Friday evening, after stopping at the vegetable market on the bus ride out of Manhattan, she would start simmering her sauce all weekend toward Sunday dinner for the entire famiglia.

The Sicilian certainly belongs well within the ""old-school Vegas white-tablecloth"" genre ... but it flies a bit more under the radar, as compared to other in the group such as Bootlegger, Casa di Amore, Ferraro's, Piero's, Golden Steer, et. al. Sicilian's generations of venues have certainly been around long enough to qualify. But it's more humble and reserved than those others. 

Large & routine murals of Italy & New York (and even San Diego) drape the egg-white painted walls ... rather than a shower of vintage autographs or red velvet wallpaper or Vegas celebrity portraits upon red brick. Simple wooden chairs & tables rather than engulfing black leather banquettes. No Strip hotel limo service or mandatory valet, but there's plenty of free parking out front. (Except for casino property executives, I hope.) Local radio promotion much more so than glossy ads in the hotel room magazines.

At first, this all feels a bit empty -- hey youse guyz, give me my dose of vintage-Vegas-vibe! But actually it subtly serves to focus diners upon this venue's main concern: classic service delivered by fawning & talented staff ... followed by excellent mangia, mangia!  Ok, NOW I remember why I REALLY came in here!

The entire menu, as well as all the plates moving around the floor, looked scrumptious. But since I already knew I'd likely return, I eased on into it this go-round. House salad with the recommended Creamy Italian dressing started a bowl of Penne in Sausage & Peppers. With the requisite loaf of Italian bread, of course. It was all fresh & tasty, no surprise there, what with all the excellent reviews in place. I'm looking forward to future visits ... where I'll delve into their red sauce, dive into the al dente of their papperdelle and such. And there's veal chops on the table tents, though I didn't notice them on the menu. Being a red-meat sort of gentleman, I'm sure to eventually venture that avenue as well.

My server Louie didn't miss a beat. He's clearly been doing this - and doing it well - for many years. And his gift of gab proved it; he was well-honed at tailoring his table-talk toward his 'read' on the individual customer. And then the service. A free hand meant he slipped my next iced tea into my table - without missing a step moving toward another table to be plated from his other hand - and he slipped it as smoothly as a solid BJ dealer slips his own second card under his first. Not a drop of light ever struck the bottom of my bread basket or butter tray either ... and without request or gesture from me. As the last bite of my house salad disappeared from my plate, Louie was standing at-the-ready, to ask if I was ready. When I said I was, his right hand, with show, swooped my entrée in a single motion from an unseen cart behind my table and down onto where my salad plate used to be. Huh? Where did THAT plate go? A magician or a waiter, you decide. If proper service is what you consider as essential to 'an upscale & quality experience,' you certainly won't be disappointed here. 

(Go figure Millennials who dead-drop three Bens for a $12 bottle of Svedka and their own seat in a nightclub ... then are anonymously sardine-crammed into thousands of other pulsating Millennial clubbers ... and yet somehow believe they've had 'an upscale & quality experience.' But, hey, it's their money, right?)

The ambient music brought the best of company to my table: Ol' Blue Eyes, Dino, The Velvet Fog, Ella, Nat King Cole, Bublé ... even Glenn Miller briefly table-touched (Begin the Beguine, 1943). I am unsure as to the source of this curation, however I was especially impressed that it paid proper respect to Dino's oft-overlooked classic-country coverage with 'Welcome to my World' (1967).

SUMMARY: Good Italian eats with fawning service, housed in humble but authentic & tasteful décor. As safe a bet as splitting your Aces. Grazie!",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,1,0,5,yqGmYVDimDV-cXmtTJ2mcA

I was disappointed by the food and service and especially the owner. 

The owner is the rude and disrespectful to the patrons of his business. We went in before the dinner rush around 4:00 pm. It was myself, my wife, my 8 yr old son, and my 1yr old. The owner decided to have a conversation as loud as can be about how he does not agree with interracial relationships and even more so doesn't agree with interracial children. I am of Mexican/American and my wife is Irish/american. My 8 yr old was completely upset because the owner went one to say,"" these kids are going to grow up thinking to themselves who am I? why don't I look like my mom or my dad?"" I was infuriated and my wife was fuming mad. 

I don't care what you religious or political views are but you have a responsibility as a owner of an establishment to be respectful of your patrons who are spending money to support your business. I shouldn't have to explain to my 8 yr old why this old man is spewing hate and that we have to pay for it. 

Once he finishes his rant we asked for the check and I had my wife put my kids in the car. I asked for the owner and we had a heated conversation. Which he offered no explanation or apology. 

I will never in my lifetime eat or recommend anyone in town to this establishment and  I work in the hospitality industry and will do my best to not recommend this place to anyone.

2668900,2012-03-19,0,Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ,"I was recently driving in the area and saw the Sicilian cafe and being Born in Vegas and having tried every legitimate Italian restaurant in Las Vegas I couldn't remember  if I had actually ever eaten  there since I have tried so many places and many that are no longer in business.  I went there with 2 friends  for an early dinner at 6pm. (That is early for me as I usual eat at 8pm or 9pm. The dining room was dead with only 2 other tables occupied when we got there. It was early so  I didn't think much of it.

We were seated and the server Melissa came over and took our drink orders promptly and dropped off a bread basket. She was friendly. After looking over the menu we all knew what we wanted or were deciding between 2 differed entrees.  When Melissa came over for our orders, I asked  for her suggestion between the Tortellini  and Angel Hair. Although friendly, Melissa just said they are both good. My other friends had similar questions and received similar answers. Now I appreciate  when a server is honest and not always trying to up-sell just to pad the check, there was no help at all deciding between the dishes. 

We started with Carprese, Minestrone and Pasta Fagioli.  All were  fine but nothing special or set them apart from anywhere or even pre made store bought variety. We all agreed that is was just OK. 

Shortly after we received our dinners.  Tortellini, Manicotti Ripieni, and Baked Ziti. They were all hot and seemed  fresh baked by the look of them.  Hungery we all at most of our diners. The taste didn't back up the look of them. It was just OK.  Not bad not good or anything special. I was waiting for  somone to come out of the kitchen telling us, this dinner way prepared by Pizza Hut or Olive Garden.  It was good enough to eat  and fill you up but nothing I would come back for even if I was again in the area. The service and friendliness was the only think memorable about the dinner. 

Since Sicilian Ristorante was very forgettable food wise, I am thinking that, combined with the countless Italian joints in Vegas I have been to, is exactly why I couldn't remember eating there before. The food is forgettable and uninspired and so is the restaurant.  If you love places like Olive Garden or Applebees you will like this place, if you want something more memorable and  not only get filled up and be on your way, find another Italian place.

3087748,2017-10-19,1,Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ,"Although I lived across from Sicilian Ristorante and drove by it all the time, I did not visit until last night. It unfortunately suffers from existing a few blocks down from the famous Casa di Amore, which is my go-to Italian restaurant. My mom, boyfriend and I came in on a Wednesday night and it was empty save for one couple. The staff was very friendly though and even made a few jokes about it being dead that night. We ordered two martinis and a Peroni (they don't have any draft beer). The martinis came in their own shakers and were served at the table. We were also served fresh, hot, home made bread which was great. We ordered the chicken parmesan, gnocchi with meat sauce, and pappardelle romano, which our server stated was one of his favorites. The pappardelle was indeed the crowd favorite. It was a huge portion of pasta served in a pink sauce with ricotta cheese dollops throughout. This is a ton of food and I'll probably be eating it for a few days. The gnocchi was alright, our server referred to it as ""bullets"" and ""poor man's pasta"" because it's so filling and sits in your stomach like a bullet I assume. He was correct. I've never had gnocchi in a meat sauce before but it was good flavor wise. A cream sauce would have definitely been too heavy. Even eating 2-3 of these made me full. I didn't get to try the chicken parmesan but it looked like what you'd expect. I was really wanting to try the cioppino or linguini pescatore but passed this time. All of their specials sounded really good but also really expensive. We finished the meal with pistachio gelato which was a milkshake glass filled with gelato and pieces of pistachio inside. I'd come back just for the gelato. Overall this is a very viable option for Italian food in the area. I'm sure that if it was busier inside we would have had a different impression upon entering but you have to wonder why it's so slow. They did say they've been in the area since the 90s though so they must be doing something right. It's hard to compete with Casa di Amore but this is a good option for a little slower, quieter, less crowded dining experience.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,3,1,4,Sej39pIES5-qKBCf2OmdQw

I cannot think how many countless times I must have driven past this place and never noticed it was there. Admittedly, I was usually late for work and too busy cursing the vehicles observing the speed limit to take in the scenery, but I actually thought it was fairly new. I asked the waiter, who informed me they had been there 26 years. Wha-wha-what?

It's in a fairly seedy little strip mall, but is surprisingly spacious and pleasant inside. The decor is a schizophrenic blend of travel posters from Italy and all the little American flags that eventually blew off car antennas in the wake of  post 9/11 patriotism. Glad someone picked them up and put them to use. I'm all about recycling.

Anyway, since we were saving $25, I decided to splurge and get the veal, which I thought at $30 was a little spendy for a neighborhood joint, but it was two nice sized pieces of good veal, not the dark squishy kind, so it was not overpriced. And I tried to get the Anaconda to order the manicotti, since I must have something cheesy and red saucy when in an Italian restaurant. He rebelled at the last minute and switched to the canneloni (curse that waiter for letting him know there was no meat in manicotti just because he asked), but the bite I got was pretty tasty. We alo had a stuffed mushroom appetizer, which was just ok (served in marinara and no meat in the stuffing), and broke down and ordered the a la carte salad, which was good but $7 extra. (A pet peeve of mine).

 I was teetering between 3 and 4 stars when they trotted out the cannoli. Oh, my. The shell was nice and crunchy and it was overflowing from both ends with the most rich, delicious, creamy filling. Yum! It was the best one I've had since that little Italian bakery at the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia.

I was seated quickly and the server took my request for water and to ""keep 'em coming"" seriously - the water was never empty again. I took a bit to decide what to order because it all sounded great. I decided on the Lasagna with house salad. The food was outstanding! The house sauce was a rich, tangy red sauce - it was magnificent! I wish I could say more but it wouldn't do it justice.

The real gem of this place is the owner and staff. The owner circled the restaurant and greeted each table and asked about everyone's meal. The servers on staff that night - JP & Howard - were friendly & funny. 

Then it got really fun...the owner circled back to my table again and chatted with me for probably an hour. Had the nicest conversation with him and found out he is a Minnesota native and he shared a little about his family.

3479048,2014-11-03,0,Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ,"We loved this restaurant from the moment we walked in. The staff was so friendly and their mission was to please their customers, a dying art in many places. The menu is extensive from seafood, to pastas, to veal...too numerous to mention. We started out with pasta fagioli soup and fried mozzarella ball for our appetizer. Very tasty. Next the entrees, calamari marinara, done perfectly, nice and tender, my companion ordered the veal Francesca which was amazing, melt in your mouth dee-lish.
 Even though we were full  we went on to the desserts and found the creme brulee was delicious. The owner came to the table with a cannolli  made at the restaurant with a nicely textured creamy filling that was very good. The bread, the house wine, the family atmosphere made for a great night out for we Sicilians who are always looking for authentic food like we had back east. 
The area the restaurant is located is a strip mall not very pleasing to the eye, but once you enter the restaurant and find the warm friendly atmosphere, the fantastic service, and wonderful food, you realize this is one of those diamonds in the rough. We will definitely dine here whenever we are in Las Vegas..",JBDA4zwEHoPx1c5G4v5HSA,0,0,4,0JnahtF6N9MIhw3qGYVp9Q

But this time around I left it to my boyfriend he had been craving chicken alfredo for a good while now and he found this place so why not. Upon entering I noticed it was a nice quiet place i loved all there decoration too. we got seated right away had our order taken fast. and our food served nice and hot. I ordered the shrimp scampi and my can I say I loved it. You have the choice of either pasta or vegetables. I ordered the vegetables and everything tasted just right I loved how it wasn't overpowered with lemon flavor because after a while it gets too tiring and sour. This plate I was able to enjoy till it was empty. Besides food being delicious our waiter was extremely entertaining everytime he would come check on us he would make a joke. Bonus for making us laugh. They have a private room too for special events. Overall I will be coming back to this place evrything about it I enjoyed.

I have not been disappointed once.  Today was Chicken Piccata with Minestrone soup.  The food is the freshest in town and you do not walk out of this place feeling weighed down.  The service is excellent.  Take down that picture of Sara Palin in the front lobby and I give it 5 stars (just kidding - sort of).

3576822,2016-05-14,2,Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ,"This place was above 5 stars before... This place used to make me feel like I was eating authentic Sicilian food in NY. 
Ever since the original owner passed away, this place went down the drain. My personal opinion. When the original owner (the Sicilian guy, super nice) was there, he always greeted everybody that was eating in his restaurant, made sure if everybody was 100% satisfied and made us laugh. I loved his service and he always went out of his way to give us better services. Now that, some family member (son in law?) took over and this place became like regular ordinary Italian place.
We were so excited to have seafood salad, baked clams, linguine with white clam sauce and arancini on Christmas Eve day. This new owner changes the menu for every occasion (Christmas eve, Valentine and so and so) to regular Italian restaurants' menu, because it's easy for them to prepare. We ended up eating Cioppino or shrimp scampi or something. I forgot  because it wasn't memorable.
Do you know how important for old fashioned NY Italian (Sicilian) to eat seafood salad on Christmas Eve!!?? It's a must!! It's a tradition!! If you ask any Sicilian person that's living in Brooklyn what they eat on Christmas eve, they would say insalata di mar!!!
Since this was the only place I was able to grab real Sicilian style Christmas dinner, I am very disappointed.

Not the greatest first impression. Anyway, walked in and said I'm here to get my pick up. Instead of listening the waiter told me to follow him to a table where he placed menus on it. I never left the front counter. He came back and said to follow him. Again I said I'm here for my pick up. He looked confused and finally realized I was not eating there. All this time I realized that this place was so dark inside. Interesting, they didn't have any windows. I guess if they did you would see the used cars for sale in their parking lot.

To my surprise Sicilian Ristorante has done the unthinkable, made me really really really enjoy Italian food!  Everything I had was extremely simple but perfectly executed which had me craving more.

I started with the Siciliana salad, super simple and super flavorful.  There must have been 2 whole tomatoes in the salad, and I'm not talking about cherry tomatoes.  The Salad itself could have been a meal.  It was delicious and you have to get the anchovies!

The Bruschetta was your standard bruschetta, nothing that really set it apart but it was very well done.  The bread was perfectly toasted and there was the right amount of tomatoes, garlic, and basil in every bite.

Chicken Carciofi was devine.  So light and packed with flavor!  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  They didn't go easy on the artichoke hearts either.  I couldn't get enough of the sauce.  Absolutely delicious!

Its definitely not as cheap as olive garden but it's well worth it.  Simplicity pays off at Sicilian Ristorsnte and the portions are great.  I'll definitely be coming back.",OLR4DvqFxCKLOEHqfAxpqQ,2,0,5,rxiuT-JGLmRuF0dOwT-nyA

The ambiance here is great. Booth seating or table. Pick your choice. They have lovely pictures up of Italy and a few of America. They have a big sign in the back that gives a buck thank you for letting the owners have the ""American Dream"" and being able to thrive here in the states. 
The servers here are a great source of entertainment. Constantly cracking jokes and keeping you laughing throughout the meal. This was great!
We started off with a Caesar and mozzarella caprese. Great start to the meal. The Caesar was huge. Split between two and we didn't even finish it. Caprese was done just right but the tomatoes could have been a little more ripe.
Main courses included pappardelle pasta dish and chicken francese. Both were amazing!! Very authentic Italian. Fresh hand-made pasta. The Papparedelle had the most amazing meat and cream sauce with fresh ricotta on top. The chicken melted in your mouth! It came with a nice side of fresh pasta with a nice tomato sauce.

Ambiance is that of an old school family Italian restaurant: huge pictures of Italy on the walls, white tablecloths, but with a takeout counter up front. Service was great - super friendly, quick, and very welcoming to our kids. When we first came in, he said, ""ok I'll bring out some bread and a side of pasta for these two. And don't worry about the linens-we don't do the laundry!"" When the bread and butter came out, he told us we got ""VIP butter"" because it was all soft from the heat lamp. 
Portions were big. My husband always orders escargot when it's available, so we checked out the Sicilians. They were big and meaty, with 3 escargot in every little spot! Our glasses of wine were doubles, too!
As for taste, it's good. I enjoyed the escargot and the manicotti with meat dish, but they weren't off the charts.

I could not resist finishing it and busted my belly. Fresh hot bread was served first. 

A few days later I took my son. I could not resist the eggplant parm despite many other old school plates. My son opted for the salmon which was excellent.

Congratulations, you've found Sicilian Ristorante! 

I had no idea what to expect when I came in here. The place is located in the strip mall behind the plasma donation place. It's not exactly bustling down there. It's a diamond in the rough.

Our server was fantastic. He had this Mitch Hedberg like demeanor. Said things kind of flatly and stood awkwardly, but was hilarious and did his job better than some servers who also don't have to play characters. 

After we gave him our order, the first thing he said before he walked away was, ""Great, I'll get the microwaves started."" It's hard to pin down but it was so hilarious. The fact that he broke the facade of the kitchen but did it in character was hilarious. 

And it was amazing lasagna. I've had bad, obviously reheated and previously frozen lasagna in a restaurant before. This was not that. The lasagna held together amazingly. The meat was flavorful and plentiful. It was saucy without being overpowering. It was delicious. 

We were the last ones out of the restaurant but even then the servers didn't rush us out. Another server who was cleaning tables started talking to us and he was awesome too. What that server said felt authentic. That's the best part. You could almost say that when you're here, you're family.

This place is the best for Italian in the valley!

..........I hate to name..names... but...

- Olive Garden . Food has no flavor. Carpeted floor often has food squished in. Loud kids. Tight sitting areas. Oh and did I mention - their food has no flavor...
- Mezzo Bistro. (on Rancho in LV),  Loud kitchen noise. The servers either are overbearing or ignore you. And many were young and unrefined (for a place of that ""level""). It was sunset - and the sunlight glares in unpleasantly. And we were still hungry when we left. My boyfriend said, he can make a spaghetti dinner from Dollar Store ingredients and it would taste better.
-Battistas (near Koval and Flamingo). Terrible parking. And with no dish under $19 - this place serves you with PLASTIC cups.

5251544,2015-07-22,2,Mq1_dvcg5mbeplEmCEoUtQ,"Just moved to this neighborhood, and trying to discover all it has to offer.
First up, Sicilian, which was recommended to me by a friend, when I was bitching that nobody in LV knows how to fry eggplant.
Right off the bat, Sicilian gets 5 stars on their eggplant alone, it's absolutely perfect, and I dare say just as good as my wife's grandmother's eggplant. (Rest her soul)
It had all the right prep, from being all iced paper thin, to being lightly floured, NOT breaded. And while I didn't ask, I'm guessing that they took the extra early step to let the slices sit in salt to take the bitterness out, because it had that sweetness that I've only ever experienced in the aforementioned Sicilian Grandmother's kitchen.
Beyond that, the staff was witty, with a tinge of the Italian sarcasm that I grew up with, so I felt right at home.
Decor is a little dated, and the plaza is a little run down, which might bother some, but please don't let it stand in your way of enjoying a delicious Sicilian meal.
As for the moron that posted the negative review because he was put-off by the fact that they discourage you making changes to their preparations, I say this...
Do you tell your mechanic how to do his job? Your accountant? How about your surgeons??
The point is, they are proud of recipes and preparations that have been handed down for generations, and they should be. So unless Charles M is a renowned chef, The Sicilian is better off without his patronage.",Dq2LXHfErN9LDy3CAQAC1Q,2,1,5,o4IoycKh7HLkZ6bt2Bygiw

For starters, our waiter was absolutely hilarious. The waiter at one of our other favorite restaurants recently left, and it's important to my grandparents that they find a place where they can have a good time with the waiter who will reciprocate their humor. Our waiter, Howard, did just that. He was hilarious, and quick on his feet. He made our experience a lot of fun, and I know that he is probably the biggest reasons why my family will continue to visit this restaurant. Other than being super funny, he also made sure that my food had no dairy in it, since it is not something I can have. It might seem like a small thing, but there are many restaurants I have visited where the waiter could have cared less, so to have a waiter than remembered was awesome!

The food was delicious. For appetizers, we had escargot and fried calamari. I had never had escargot before, but Howard gave us suggestions on how to eat it for ""first timers"" and I was pleasantly surprised with how it tasted (I think I ended up having 3 or 4 pieces). The entrees took a while to come out, but all 6 of us agreed that our food was incredible fresh. I got the linguini calamari with red sauce, and I think I still have two or three servings sitting in my fridge - it's that big!

Our server, whose name escapes me, and I did not pay the tab so I don't have a receipt to reference...but reminds me of Michael Cera a little bit....was great.  On point, did some magic card tricks at the end, was funny and had good food recommendations...lovely service.  

ALL the meals were delicious, no one had a single complaint on anything.  I had Prosecco ... was served in a regular wine glass not a champagne glass, but it was fine.  The bubbles just fizzle out faster in a wide mouth glass.  BF had Peroni, my mom had a half-gallon of red wine.  Everyone else had non-alc.  

Food was on point, service was as well, we had a great time, and will ABSOLUTELY BE BACK.  And we have plenty of occasions to be in Vegas with my man's kid attending UNLV, so we will keep that promise.  I highly recommend.",rMwMXCEMn9i1wpAJj1S3dg,3,4,5,RQWL9QD6asSknZz74yf9qQ

You can tell this is a family business with the focus on the food and the service.  If your looking for that posh place that just wants to suck up to you for tips this isn't the place.  If your looking for great food, average service and a fair price go there.

I will go again it was a good experience and I would recommend it.",WsM6gVY0y_XKl8z8dlayYw,0,0,4,7JUZHSA-EoqRQt3oQ8KKfw

Service is excellent! Everyone greets you and are gracious for your business. The place is spotless clean which I'm super picky about and it has a cool Italy vibe going on. 

Now let's get to the food! I have been coming here for about 8 years and let me tell you this. If you like authentic Italian food look no further! The portions are huge and I haven't had a bad menu item to date! 

If you are looking for a classic little restaurant that takes you back to old school Vegas with a touch of class and excellent service you found it!",m9LlKOpkMwEa7LPyugFiZw,0,1,5,jhD0rKJQ-PeNXxuEQ7PKyA

Settled on the Sicilian Ristorante based on online reviews.  Went on a weeknight and the restaurant was about half full.  I'm originally from Brooklyn and am used to good Italian food and was not disappointed.  I had the Fra diavolo and my wife went more conservative with the Chicken Parm.  We were both happy with our selections and the taste and quality was on par with the many Italian restaurants back East.  Was a bit pricey but I guess that's normal for Vegas.

The wait staff really enjoyed being there and made us feel very welcome.  It seemed that everyone in the restaurant knew each other.  Our waiter Howard was great.  He was attentive and had a good sense of humor.  

We finish off with the Tiramisu that was one of the best I've had.  Would definitely recommend  this restaurant if you are in the area.",7hnjqjHCvdCxtTHAGZ67mg,2,0,5,SyrCtcHG0C2hsYPWCS9gtA
