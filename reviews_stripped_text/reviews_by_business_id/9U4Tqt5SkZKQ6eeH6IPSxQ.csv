Soup, great flavor
Salad, fresh chomp chomp
Potstickers, tender, flavorful
California rolls- nom nom

Then in hibachi we had these we all tried:
noodles (wow, best flavor, almost sticky and savory!) 
fried rice
Steak/shrimp/chicken/scallops and WOW they all tasted amazing and were so tender they just fell apart in your mouth!

Food/drinks we ordered:
1. Tropical cloud cocktail - (citrus sake mixed with a mango puree) this drink was enjoyable with the dinner, it doesn't overpower your palate, and it was a refreshing, fruity treat.

2. Strawberry with boba - the smoothie was amazing and the boba was cooked to perfection! It was lychee flavored boba too, yum!

3. Kani nachos - (stir fried spicy crab topped with fresh avocado on top of fried wontons) WOW! Tried these bad boys out for our appetizer and holy hell were they amazing from the very first bite!! The only warning I have about this appetizer was that the crab was bunched up like a ball of spaghetti noodles and they were hard to bite through, I used my chopsticks to break it up lol. Other than that, it is a MUST TRY!

4. Ohjah boat - (sushi boat with your choice of 3 special rolls, 10 pieces of nigiri, 12 pieces of sashimi, and a bowl of seaweed salad) The nigiri and sashimi were chef's choices, but we got to choose our own rolls.
*Dragon roll - (crab, cucumber, and shrimp tempura roll topped with eel (plus sauce) and avocado)
*Spiderman roll - (soft shell crab & crab salad roll topped with with eel (plus sauce) and crunch)
*Dynamite roll - (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and avocado roll deep fried topped with spicy mayo sauce)

EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOAT WAS AMAZINGGG!!! 

Our waitress offered dessert, but we politely declined, we were way too stuffed with all of the goodness! Each bite was consistent and kept getting better! This will definitely be our go-to spot from now on.",ApuxiyS_zR7S7PlCi0Wkew,3,0,5,lLa6aXdeg7_MQQnv0-pBjQ

We were literally the only customers in the restaurant and the manager decides to make a business call in the booth next to us. He spent our entire dinner on the phone talking very loudly about their internet and tv package....

The scallops were amazing. My son had the shrimp, and of course the chef threw them into his mouth, which he found hilarious. The chef offered suggestions of sauces, and gave us extra because he thought it went well with the rice. The price was very reasonable. We fed a family of 5 for under $100.

It wasn't to busy so it made for a great atmosphere. We went to the Rainbow location and we were greeted with a smile by our hostess and everyone else we made eye contact with. Chef Ken was 
A-Maaaaaaaa-Zing. He indulged in conversation as well as entertained. I was so excited to eat that I didn't take pictures. I would recommend that you order the 3 item hibachi instead of individually because you'll save a few bucks. Together we ordered the chicken, scallops, salmon, filet mignon and the shrimp. It was great. I went for a quick bite to eat with my daughter and since it was her birthday the waitress threw in desert. It would've gotten 5 stars but the portions were a tad to small for my liking. I WILL go back again. Thanks Ohjah for a GREAT meal!!",BFyfysE8EsS8yrP5KD7b6Q,0,0,4,_cHpQYSYZgfZKkc0G2aPgQ

If you're looking for a nice Hibachi restaurant that may be close to you and has very reasonable prices, I highly recommend Ohjah.

It is a family friendly environment. I usually go to the location on Rainbow and Lake Mead, and haven't had the opportunity to try the other locations.

The chef was very entertaining, juggling spatulas etc. He also put on an awesome fire show. Look for the smoking volcano! We are going to bring back our Grandchildren for the cooking show.
The filet was very tender and cooked to perfection. The noodles and vegetables were very flavorful and tasty. The Sole fish was also very flavorful and cooked to perfection. 
4,5 stars instead of 5 stars, due to order mix-up. (I honestly don't know how the chef keeps track of all of the orders).",4FCAQiQLvjTkt0oG4s4BgA,0,0,4,nZRF9mP5a3DymrE1_xts6Q

My husband ordered their beef short ribs and it just tasted like Kalbi from a Korean restaurant.  Portion was very small for dinner.  I ordered their Beef Sukiyaki and was surprised it was not served with rice.  Usually when you order sukiyaki, the beef is thinly sliced, but the cut they use is way too thick!  The beef ended up dry and not good.  Again, small portion size.

Service here was really lacking in my opinion.  They have a rating of 4.5 stars so I'm guessing we ordered the wrong kinda food!  If i ever go back, i'd skip their regular menu and get their rolls instead.",rHDnb8n6pwjFoSjzS5_UIA,0,0,2,OrrHs3bVAd7Y2jaf6bzD3A

We started with an order of garlic edamame (delicious!) and each had a filet. Like most hibachi meals, we got soup and a salad as starters, with fried rice and grilled veggies as sides to the entree. Wasn't a big fan of the soup (a bit bland), and the salad was good but overdressed. I did like the fact that the veggies included broccoli; not a big broccoli fan, but I had never seen that before -- and it was really good!

The steak was cooked perfectly, and the hibachi chef was fun and chatty, even though we were his only customers. Our server kept our glasses filled, and we really felt welcome throughout the entire meal.

All of the staff -- from the greeter, to the server, to our chef -- were super friendly and attentive. Although the food wasn't the best hibachi meal I've ever had, it was tasty enough for a return trip, especially with such a great group of people preparing and serving it!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,2,0,4,iS-sB0wFZGtfi6OirsrfHg

My husband and I come here with our kids twice a month. We go to the Hibachi area and share the Ohjah dinner special ($31.95). It comes with your choice of three meats (excluding Kobe Beef and Lobster Tail), noodles or rice, veggies, soup, and salad. We get two Filet Mignons, a chicken, noodles, and we add a side of fried rice. The kids' meals are $11.95 and they get one meat, rice or noodles, veggies, soup, salad, and a drink!

Some cooks are more entertaining than others, that's for sure. Some even cook better, so the lack of consistency here can be pretty disappointing, but it's usually on point! 

Their salad is DELICIOUS, and i'm not even a salad fan. It's just a basic mixed greens salad with onions and tomatoes, but their dressing is phenomenal. Their egg drop soup is also delicious, with yummy onion straws inside! And crispy noodles!

Then you get dinner and a show. You get to watch the chef cook in front of you, as he entertains you. They are really good about splitting up your food here. The servers are also really nice, and everyone is attentive to our kids. They make us feel welcomed! 

Note, both my 4-year-old and my 6-month old were petrified during the fire part of the show. They have both gotten over it now, but once, they were kind enough to leave out the fire, because our son was hysterical! Lol. We love the show, and are glad that the kids can now enjoy it with us.

1534390,2015-10-18,0,9U4Tqt5SkZKQ6eeH6IPSxQ,"Went here with boyfriend last night at his recommendation, trying to find a place that offered us variety 'cause we had different cravings. 
Going in was good - the host was friendly, greeted and got to seat us right away 'cause we just wanted a table away from the teppanyaki area, and there was just the 2 of us. Once seated, our server introduced himself within 5 minutes and asked us if we wanted water while we looked over the menu, which was cool. 
Only took us about 5 minutes to decide what we wanted from the menu, which were dinner entrees that came with soup, salad, and your choice of steamed or brown rice. 15 minutes after giving us our water though, the boyfriend was still looking around the restaurant, waiting for our server to surface so we could order. I remember my boyfriend making eye contact with a bartender, ready to flag her down so we could order, but she ended up just yelling for the server to check on us. Honestly wasn't too happy that it had to happen that way.
When ordering I was pretty frank, but apparently hard to hear after repeating myself twice, so the boyfriend had to order for me. No biggie. Maybe the guy couldn't hear from the noise coming from the other room. The guy never checked on us, nor did anyone else until the appetizers came 20 minutes later though. Honestly wanted to order some Lychee Sake to ease my mood along with a water refill. 
Anyway for appetizers, we ordered Seaweed Salad and Yakigyu (beef skewers). I ordered the Pork Katsu with brown rice, and the boyfriend ordered the Spicy Beef with steamed rice. The boyfriend seemed to like the salad. The beef skewers were decent - all the good flavor was with the sauce. Nothing special about the Pork Katsu until you drizzled the Katsu sauce all over it. The boyfriend said his dish wasn't spicy at all, but it was still decently flavored and cooked well. The menu said entrees came with soup and salad, but we never got those items. Was the salad supposed to be undressed 2 pieces of broccoli and 3 pieces of sliced carrots on my plate? Oh. Also had a plain puff pastry on the side.
Couldn't finish the entree anyway because I was so frustrated that I could overlook the hunger I felt. 
Going back to the customer service, before we got our appetizers, when I wanted to order more... I noticed how the restaurant or our server's area wasn't fully packed/busy, and how he tried to avoiding our table when checking on his other tables - he literally walked the long way to get to the table directly behind us several times. Observed this for the 20 minutes it took us to get the food after ordering. Also noticed how someone else had to take the appetizer plates away 'cause he was still avoiding our table for the most part. At that point, I'm just going to be as courteous as possible. 
It got slightly better towards the end, when he asked us once how everything was going during our entree course. Thinking it was better 'cause the boyfriend managed to lighten my hangry mood. Not enough to make me overlook the entire experience as a whole though, and I think the boyfriend held that against the server - his tip honestly reflected it.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,2,0,3,4a0bYDUCKpevcTzHlQMvbA

I tend to find that when a restaurant doesn't specialise in only sushi (ie they do teppan as well) the quality suffers. But that was not the case here. I don't often do non-AYCE places as well, because the price difference doesn't seem enough to warrant the slight quality increase usually. But they have a special (Special Rolls Combo) that's pretty much 3 rolls for the price of 2 ($26), so that was a really good deal.

I ordered the Blue Diamond Roll, Snow White roll, and the Sweet Heart roll. I also ordered garlic albacore and yellowtail nigiri. Everything was very fresh and delicious. 

Service was also good. They weren't busy at all, so our orders came out extremely fast. And she was pretty attentive to drink refills and such. 

The only thing that was awkward was the size of the platters they brought the combos out on. Absolutely massive. There were three of us in a 4-top booth, and we could barely fit two platters of sushi on the table, let alone the third plate of teriyaki. We tried to combine plates quickly to get them to take one away, because it was actually claustrophobic.

Our main reason for visiting Ohjah is actually their sushi. It is consistently fresh with a menu boasting something for everyone. My husband and I generally opt for the Ohjah boat (no AYCE here). It is just the right amount of food for about $50. The boat comes with several cuts of fresh nigiri, several cuts of delicious and fresh sashimi, and 3 signature rolls of your choice. The selection of rolls is vast and you can choose from something as simple and straight forward as a rainbow roll to something heavy and drenched in Yum sauce and cream cheese.

Note that their Yelp check-in offer for a $26 dinner special is the regular price on their menu, but one of my favorite things to get. 

Out of the four sushi dinner special combos, I usually pick from the Special Rolls Combo (3 rolls) or the Blue Diamond Dinner Special (two rolls plus 4 pieces each chef choice sashimi and nigiri)- both are $26 and huge, shareable portions.

Favorite rolls include the Give Me a Break (spicy tuna, shrimp, avocado, Cajun tuna, garlic sauce) and the You and Me (tempura crab, salmon, cream cheese, tuna, superwhite tuna, fish eggs, eel sauce, and spicy mayo). They balance one another out well, with one being spicy while the other is more mild. Fish is fresh and generously cut, rolls aren't too rice-heavy.

We finally got to try it last night! We didn't wait at all for a booth. All their tables look to be booths, unless they are different in the other part of the resturant. We don't care, but if you're not a fan of a booth you might be out of luck. The decor and set up are very similiar to their Blue Diamond location. 

The main thing that I love about Ojhah is that they have a 3 Special Roll Combo for $25.95. It's perfect to share with some apps and an order of Sashimi. I like a good AYCE but man you're killing me, making me think I have the stomach of Gods to shove all that I can feeling I got my money's worth and ordering seperate rolls can get pretty dang expensive. So this is perfect for us. Maybe other sushi places have it but not the three we generally visit.

We had our usual sake, cold and fruity. They don't have the raspberry that we like so we got gold plum, which was ok. The BF loves the cucumber salad and we got garlic edamame. YUM! We usually get regular with salt. And we got an order of Sake Sashimi, salmon. And it was fresh and cold! Eww warm sashimi is never a good thing. 

For our rolls we got the Kamikaze, crab and avocado roll with smoked salmon, yum yum sauce torched, eel sauce. Double Spice, spicy salmon and cucumber roll topped with spicy tuna, eel sauce and spicy mayo. And Spicy Mexican, spicy tuna and cucumber roll topped with shrimp, avocado and jalapeÃ±o sauce. (These descriptions are right from their online menu) All are so good and fresh! The spicy is not too spicy and has a nice flavor. They have alot of other good rolls that we've had on other visits. The thing I dislike is that I love a good creative roll that has fresh salmon that's NOT fired. But I manage and can find something that I like.

2465503,2017-01-22,0,9U4Tqt5SkZKQ6eeH6IPSxQ,"There are 2 distinct reviews applicable here: the hibachi experience, and the sushi bar. The hibachi here is 4 stars in my book. It is my favorite place to go for hibachi. The ala carte entree ordering provides an opportunity to get great bang for your buck and good quality food. I enjoy the filet and scallops. The hibachi chefs and servers are great. 

Unfortunately, the sushi bar experience warrants merely 1 star at best for a bad experience. Although one isolated bad experience would not necessarily result in a one star review, in this case, the same bad sushi bar experience happened 3 visits in a row. On each of the 3 occasions, my group placed a large order. The 1st time, 3 of us ordered a large sashimi platter in addition to other orders - we were served TWO large sashimi platters. Because this was the 1st time this happened, we agreed to pay for both, although we clarified only one had actually been ordered. 

This exact same ""mistake"" or ""misunderstanding"" occurred again, and again, both of the next two times we sat at the sushi bar. Because of the 1st time when we were served 2 platters when only one had been ordered, then next 2 visits we made extra efforts to be clear we only placed one order for each item. Made no difference whatsoever. All 3 visits we were served TWO of whichever item was the most expensive from the list we ordered. All 3 times, it was the same guy making the ""mistake"". All 3 times he behaved as if that had never happened before, although we know with absolution that he had done exactly the same thing a week prior TO US.

Finally, the 3rd time they served us an additional plate we had not ordered, we refused it. Not only was this the 3rd and final straw, but that particular dish was not good at all. It was soggy in sauce and not fresh tasting or smelling. The sushi here is ok, not fantastic. Although they have an interesting Specials board, we were informed that the Chef would only make us an item from the Special Board if we sucked up to him, and then, only if he felt like doing so. And, apparently, he did not. This was the worst sushi experience I've had anywhere in 20 years. And I eat a lot of sushi. This was bad, in the exact same way, 3 times in a row. 

So, in summary, the best part of this place is the hibachi experience. I would recommend literally ANY other place in town for sushi over this sushi bar.",qi434PgVlAyog9cjExzFtw,3,1,2,P0vv-ZnrRzhPnjoym2h4-w

Ohjah should set up shop in the Bay Area, because we always have to fly back to Vegas when we miss this Japanese hibachi and sit-down restaurant. It's 10x better than Benihana, the ambience is terrific, and it's way more affordable as well. 

We first found Ohjah back in 2010 when we lived in the Southwest part of town. There is a location off of Blue Diamond and Decatur. This location that I am doing a review for is the one on Lake Mead and Rainbow. Both locations are terrific! We definitely go for the hibachi side of the restaurant, although we have tried the normal restaurant menu, which is also amazing. 

On the hibachi side, the first thing you will notice is that the prices are extremely reasonable. The hibachi basic entree is $8.95 and comes with soup, salad, vegetables, and choice of rice (white or fried rice). You then get to choose the entree you want with it:

* Chicken (5 oz) for $5.95
* Sukiyaki Beef (5 oz) for $6.45
* New York Steak (5 oz) for $7.25
* Filet Mignon (5 oz) for $8.55
* Kobe Beef (8 oz) for $48.95
* Shrimp Teppanyaki (3 oz) for $6.75
* Salmon Teriyaki (4 oz) for $6.75
* Scallop Teriyaki (5 oz) for $8.55
* Sole Fish Teriyaki (8 oz) for $7.95
* Calamari (7 oz) for $6.75
* Lobster Tail Teriyaki (6 oz) for $16.95

There is a special that you can get where you can get 3 entrees (excluding kobe beef, halibut, lobster tail, and live seafood) for about $30.95 per person. You save about $4-5 by doing this as opposed to ordering each separately. I always recommend getting the following items: filet mignon, scallop teriyaki, and sole fish teriyaki. The chicken can be hit or miss - sometimes they overcook it. But I recommend getting the filet mignon with a medium rare cooking. It is spectacular - the meat is extremely tender. 

When we were at Ohjah recently, I got this special combo, and you can get TWO orders of filet mignon and the scallop teriyaki (which comes out to about $35 total). Then, my wife just ordered the chicken and we shared everything. That's how we strategized there. :)

Anyway, you don't HAVE to do hibachi, but it's what I definitely recommend if you go to Ohjah. In the normal restaurant, they have a full sushi bar and full sushi menu (nigiri, sashimi and rolls galore). They also serve sukiyaki (amazing), dinner plates for the traditional chicken/beef teriyaki, yakisoba, and udon. It's an unreal menu. This place blows Benihana out of the water - no joke. I wish they set up shop in San Jose. The next time we go to Ohjah, I will personally ask them to open a franchise closer to me.",9xppB_mrDBH3agQA8uLZOg,8,8,5,DwJl2Y_lm6FWcOPP82kwqg
2852399,2015-12-27,0,9U4Tqt5SkZKQ6eeH6IPSxQ,Decent Japanese teppanyaki. Talented chefs and good tasting food. Prices were typical for teppanyaki.  Ambiance was nice. My filet mignon was done to my liking (rare).  Seafood was fresh. Enjoyed my spicy tuna rolls though I thought the rice was a little dry. Good customer service -- very responsive when we complained about the mochi ice cream being dried out and not fresh; guessing people aren't ordering dessert here.

The entry was good, chicken teriyaki had good flavor, lots of veggies and nicely cooked fried rice.

He had the teriyaki filet mignon and I chose the seafood tempura. His meat was so very tender and delish, but sad to say that my tempura was a disappointment. Although freshly made and crispy, the dough was too thick for my liking and I had to discard about 75% of the dough from each morsel of seafood. I was expecting a light, airy tempura batter, so my choice was regrettable.

We also had the gyoza, California roll, and the tuna poke. Everything was just great, but I have to say that the poke was cut up into tiny, tiny pieces (pea-size, literally) and did not make for a very satisfying consumption of poke -- not to mention how scant the serving was in comparison to its high price.

Im more mad at myself because I should have known yet I still ate it. I'm never coming here again and I'll explain why. So last Thursday I came for dinner at 6:30 because I was going to watch Star Wars at the theater next door at 7:30. This place had good reviews so I stopped in and it was beautiful! The decor was nice and authentic the staff was friendly and the chefs even said hello. We were seated in a booth and ordered the teriyaki chicken and beef teriyaki. The presentation was beautiful I mean down to the placement. Our entrees came with a green salad and a soup. The salad dressing was amazing but they drenched my salad in it! Literally I finished all my salad and still had a large amount of dressing leftover in the bowl. The miso soup had great flavor but it had a weird little after taste to it. Now let's talk about what made me sick. My chicken teriyaki was THE MOST bland, cold, rubbery, tasted reheated, piece of chicken I have ever eaten. It had grill marks on it but I could tell it was NOT fresh. Imagine a piece of chicken that you grilled then kept in the fridge for a day then microwaved in a few days and left out for a bit. That's what this tasted like. I wish I was making this up. It didn't have any flavor no salt no seasoning absolutely nothing. I drenched it in teriyaki sauce to eat it. While I ate it I felt forced to take bites just to get something in my stomach but I stopped after a while. Why did I eat it and not send it back? 1. It was my first meal of the day and I was starving. 2. I was in a time crunch and didn't want to send it back because it would make me late for the movie. 3. I needed to eat in order to survive a 3 hr movie and didn't want to get food at the theater. I had someone else taste my chicken and they said it was the worst piece of chicken they ever had. Later that night at the movies I started to feel sick. When I got home I felt worse. I don't want to share what kind of sick I got because it's TMI but you can imagine. This place ruined chicken so bad for me I don't think I can ever eat another chicken teriyaki plate without gagging. Also the other person I was with said their beef was cold and tasteless while they were eating it. I don't know what went wrong, maybe they were in a hurry and didn't feel the need to make a fresh piece of chicken but that's something I would expect at McDonald's and not a restaurant like this.",pcA1OAR30sMQFgl_7YWOpQ,4,0,1,w3Bv45IYr9FizDreZhypJA

We decided not to go with the hibachi grill as all members of the party has to opt for the grill.   However I am a sucker for the hibachi grill fried rice. I dont know it is - probably the child hood visits to Benihana and the buttery goodness seeping from the rice.  But Ohjah provides a more affordable experience of what you can get from Benihana.

The fried rice was perfect with huge chunks of chicken, not over cooked.  We ordered the sashimi combo which came with 20 pieces.  This was such a bargain.  5 pieces of tuna, salmon, yellow tail, garlic tuna, and super white tuna.  The pieces were gigantic, fresh and for $23 was worth it.

3167850,2015-01-09,3,9U4Tqt5SkZKQ6eeH6IPSxQ,"In general, I'm not a huge hibachi fan. Of the few places we've tried, the quality of food and level of service just doesn't justify the price. Our last venture to Geisha House (which is terrible in my opinion) a while back had turned me off on seeking out other similar restaurants. But when some friends invited us out to Ohjah on two separate occasions, I think I may have had a slight change of heart.

This Ohjah location, which is one of three in town, is located on Rainbow & Lake Mead directly across from the Best In The West shopping center. Inside, you'll find a very typical hibachi setup. Aside from an area with booths for those who want to do maybe just sushi only, there's an entirely separate room setup exclusively for hibachi. It's basic, but it's nice, and they keep it extremely clean.

The menu here is quite extensive. Besides the hibachi dinners, they have offer a ton of different stuff. They've got everything from entrees and bowls, to a long list of rolls and other sushi types, even a handful of Thai dishes. I was to surprised to see they even offer boba drinks as well.

If you are going for hibachi though, they do require that everyone in your party order from that menu. The basic setup is about $9, but includes a soup of your choice, salad and then grilled veggies and your choice of noodles, or one of a few different rice styles. Meat add ons run anywhere from just over $6 for chicken, all the way up to nearly $50 for Kobe beef. You're also able to mix and match if you want multiple items, or to add on seafood, like salmon, scallops, lobster, shrimp, etc. It's basically limitless and there's options for really anyone. 

I've now tried their chicken, steak and scallops alongside fried rice. The rice was cooked very well, but I'm not a fan of the way they serve everything. First you get rice, then veggies, and then finally your meet. The rice and veggies are bound to start getting cold before the meat comes, but it is what it is. All the add-ons I tried have been fairly decent with the scallops surprisingly being my favorite. They were seared well, and not overdone. Both the chicken and steak were just above average, but nothing that stands out as excellent.

I also have ordered a couple different types of nigiri and have been mostly unimpressed. The garlic tuna was way overpowered and the hamachi didn't appear to be very fresh. They aren't bad for the price though, and I have to give the chef credit for putting together a special avocado nigiri for the misses who hates seafood. 

Of course, with hibachi, it's all about the chef and the experience. We've had Tony & Nick, who are both excellent! They are very interactive and do some really clever things while they work. I love that they get the youngins involved in the fun too. It's much appreciated and so fun to watch. And I mean c'mon, how can you not have fun while trying to catch flying shrimp with your mouth?  

The servers are also very friendly, and really stay on top of everything. Glasses barely get half full before someones there to refill, and they just downright do a good job. 

It can get pricey here quickly, but Ohjah is a solid 3.5 stars when it comes to the food. With excellent service and a memorable experience though, I'm rounding it up to a 4. They're definitely worth checking out!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,4,3,4,uBXW8sxOnS2qlexOjv2_Ng

The location is convenient but not one that we normally visit for good food.  We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in and found such a nicely designed restaurant.   We walked passed the main dining room and sushi bar, and we entered into a packed hibachi dining room.  

The service was incredible.  Our group ordered some sushi for starters, the Filet Mignon with some shrimp for our hibachi entrees, and all the food was really good.

The only real disappointment was the ""show"" aspect of the hibachi chef.  We've had better, but our guy wasn't bad.  He gave his best effort and our group was entertained.  It looked like there were other chefs who were more entertaining and engaged with their tables.  

The food was great, the service was superb, and we will be back.  I think Ohjah is the best in town for teppenyaki, and based on the pack group in the dining room, I think others agree.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,2,2,5,XqX9r--HkPiFapX96FZ60w

We  tried out an eel-unagi don  first,  and I realized right away that Ohja's unagi donburi has a few more slices of unagi  and thicker, tastier sauce than any other Japanese  restaurant.
Donburi is a typical Japanese restaurant menu item. Ohja's unagi don is not only 
   delicious, but the presentation  and  even the box is  exactly like what we had in Japan.

Since there is a live tank in this Ohjah location too, we tried live abalone and sweet shrimp sashimi. 
Surprisingly, I found out the real  minced wasabi on the sashimi plate.   I can smell the freshness of the wasabi and when I chewed it, I got the spicy kick in my nose right way.

Special roll plate is a choice of my own, and three rolls were beautifully presented on the plate.  It looks appealing and taste  good too.

3525421,2014-01-19,5,9U4Tqt5SkZKQ6eeH6IPSxQ,"With everything that people have wrote about this place, I had high expections.

What was good about this place? Probably the ice tea and the crab rangoons that were complimentary because we had to wait an hour for our reservation that we made 3 days ago.

First off, we were in a very large party that took up two of the hibachi grills. The waitress was already pissed because half of use didn't want hibachi, which isn't our fault because the birthday girl wanted hibachi style. 

This review is basically based off of service and a la carte. I ordered the spicy seafood+ a salmon roll and my boyfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken. Before I even get to how the food tasted, I need to add that I asked one of the managers?? In a blue button up for a spoon, just because, well, I wanted a spoon to get the sauce/soup of my spicy seafood. The guy looked at me, then looked at my food and gave me a disgusted look and asked why. He had the nerve to say, ""I was wondering why you needed a spoon."" I did not know I needed to explain myself as in why I needed a spoon in a first place??????? ANYWAYS, The spicy seafood was basically fake spicy mushroom 1/4 seafood. It literally tasted like just soy sauce/oyster sauce with sugar. It tasted better eating it with sriracha sauce. My boyfriends chicken teriyaki tasted so rubbery and the sauce tasted like the smell of cleaning chemicals for the bathroom. I don't know if it's because I'm Asian and like a lot of flavor or what it is because even my cousins Kalbi short ribs were lifeless and rubbery. My salmon roll was no big deal, the simplest dish... But.... The salmon just seemed warm and not fresh at all. 


I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. The service was terrible. I don't know how many times we had to ask for drink refills. I guess for experience, you should try hibachi, but there are other places that would far more be worth it than this place. If it wasn't for the automatic gratuity, I don't even know how much I would even want to tip. After the first 5 minutes of sitting in the restaurant I was pissed. The only thing that saved this place from getting no stars, and the fact that you can't give 0 stars if you want to give a review, was the waitress named Ren.

My first night here we checked Yelp for a good sushi recommendation and decided on this place. Crowd-wise it wasn't what I was used to. A little rough around the edges, but we went with it. I'm so glad we did! We ate here THREE nights in a row, and it got better with each night. Our first night we decided to do the usual picks off the menu. We had 5 rolls, along with cold saki and Saporo. All of the rolls were outstanding! Our waitress (Yanny) was on point and brought us different samples of saki she thought we might like. They were all delicious! She was attentive and always made sure our drinks were full and the sushi was to our liking. I could not have asked for a better server. After we finished, the chef (Johnny) had a couple little dishes sent to our table. I was in shock! The flavor exploded in my mouth! I was literally in disbelief! My buddy, Josh, and I decided we had to return the next night. When we walked in, were instantly greeted by name by the manager, Joe. They sat us at the same table and the service got even better! We decided to go with a couple of our favorites from the previous night, and let Yanny and Johnny pick the rest. I was even more floored with what they brought us than what we had ordered. We left again saying we had to return for a third night. I didn't think our experience could get any better. I was wrong! We showed up tonight and they had a little folded paper on the table that said 'Reserved for Ken and Josh'! I was in disbelief! We decided to go with one of our choices, and let Chef Johnny choose the rest. I have been to sushi restaurants in many states, and this was BY FAR my best experience. Ever. Chef Johnny presented us with choices I would have never made on my own. The presentation and flavors were out of this world! No need for soy sauce and wasabi for these dishes!

What made this one incredible was our chef, ""Chad"".  Remember when you first experienced teppan and it was fresh and fun?  Yep! That's what Chad was like.  Enthusiastic, humorous, and an excellent chef.  Of all the many teppan places in Vegas, I will go out of my way to return to this specific one, just to get Chad as our chef!
Well done, guys!

We wanted to take friends from out of town to this restaurant location because it was the closest. We took our kids too. Our kids loved the California and Philly rolls so much that they ordered a second serving of each. Our friends enjoyed their order. No complaints. My husband got the terriyaki chicken bento box and said he has had better from the other location. I ordered the duck... 

If you plan on eating with your friends and you don't want them to watch you eat while their plates are empty then don't order the $18 duck! My food came once everyone was finished eating. They also charge extra if you don't want rice and only want vegetables. They had to also fix my ""crispy"" duck which wasn't crispy. 

I give 4 stars because the waiter was super friendly, attentive, great with kids. The manager was kind to follow us and make sure we were sure about adding extra gratuity on top of the added gratuity on the ticket.

I hadn't ever tried beef sukiyaki before, and it surprisingly delicious, although I'm not always into sweet main dishes.

I just remember one night we were both craving sushi and unfortunately we haven't really established a go-to place.  Yummy Sushi Grill is great, but it didn't fit to our taste buds.  I was really hesitant to try sushi again, as a couple years back I went to Sushi Ko off of Craig and Tenaya and got really sick from their quality of eel.

So we decided to try here and I seriously was not disappointed.  For me, usually with sushi places if I start to yak that means it's not good.  But that never happened here, meaning their quality is pretty good.  My favorite rolls as of right now are the Alaskan King Crab, Give Me a Break, Shogun, and Gentlemen's Club.   Of course I'm going to try more when I come back!

Their service is also exceptional, I remember my second visit the young waitress was making sure I was okay because I noticed their dinner menu had bell peppers in it as vegetables and I didn't know, which I'm allergic to.  I ordered one of them and I had to pick it all out, but I assured her that I was okay.

I haven't tried the sushi here yet, but the hibachi here is amazing. The chefs are friendly and do a great performance, and communicate with customers very well. It's a blast coming here, I have more fun here then I do at some entertainment shows on the strip. 
The overall design of the place is great, when you first walk in it's the normal restaurant, and a whole separate room for the hibachi. The colors are dark but not depressing, and it's an overall romantic ambiance that's perfect for evening dinners.

Pricing is a-ok here compared to other places, if not cheaper. The service is very attentive and polite.

The food is great, I usually just get extra vegetables with mine (which are cooked just right), but my friends had the salmon, beef, and scallops and claim they are delicious as well.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,4,1,5,Lnoa6mzTY0I7eZIgxOU3ig

What really stood out is the level of thoughtfulness, we came in right at opening time and we had my sister and my 6 month old nephew with us. The owner and our waiter saw us lugging a car seat so they sat us in a bigger booth to give my sister more room. That really stood out for me. Our waiter(Feng/Joe) was very thoughtful as well, we never had to seek him out for a drink refill or to clear a plate and he was very careful of the baby when serving. As usual, the food was fantastic. I'm not a fan of sushi at all but my sister is and she loved the dragon roll she ordered. But there are plenty of other non-sushi entrees that can please. I had the chicken katsu this time and the beef teriyaki before. Both were delicious and the servings are so large that my sister and I were able to split it.

  Compared to the other places around town, it's comparable and mediocre.
They have a decent variety of rolls and a few specialty rolls. The taste is good, but it's nothing out of the ordinary.
 
This place is new, and I'm surprised it's not that busy. The hibachi side wasn't busy either. I heard from a neighbor that hibachi is good, but I'm not that big into it because you're paying more for the show, which is fine. I've never had amazing hibachi, but I can't rate this place based off of that. It could be the most amazing hibachi in the entire world. 

The customer service is alright, especially since it was pretty slow. There were only 3 other tables being waited on. Our server was very sweet, but she kept forgetting things. We had to ask for additional waters when we asked for 1 per person, ask for our beer twice and she forgot one of our rolls. (Which we were pretty grateful for since we were so full.) We didn't complain or say anything, but the manager seemed to notice. He came by a couple of times to make sure everything was okay. He also gave us a $10 gift card for our next visit. I'm not sure if he was trying to make us feel special... or if he gave one to everyone that night. 

I would like to try this place again, and maybe on the hibachi side. As for the sushi, I'm not the biggest fan.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,4,1,3,gayWohAz__UGvcAYILDpGg

We paid the balance of what we owed and they still took the 30.00 from the party that already paid it.  We told the other party and the manager came and said if we made a mistake I will spank her. Very inappropriate and immature.
The hibachi chef was very blah and food not bad but not like many other places where you can get. Go to geisha house if you want good hibachi and a fun time for a date or family.  My credit card also has 2 charges. So pay cash if you go",Q-8B2GGUMkC-PuT-e_8Vww,2,0,2,pUkhJrf7jDo5JQci2_ARYA

My husband and I can eat a lot of sushi and typically leave places with over $100 meal. We ordered one Ohjah boat with the Snow White roll (garlic ponzu on super white tuna), Sweet Heart roll (spicy tuna with yellow tail on top) and the Golden Gate roll (shrimp tempura). We loved the Sweet Heart and Snow White rolls the best, not that the Golden Gate was bad it just wasn't as great as the other two rolls. It was more of a meh. 

The boat presentation was beautiful. We also tried the strawberry smoothie, some sake and the seaweed salad that came with the Ohjah. With the giant Ohjah Boat which also included 12 pieces of sashimi and 10 pieces of nigiri we were happily stuffed and our entire bill was $75. That is amazing considering how much sushi we can eat. Although Las Vegas is known for all you can eat sushi this was much better quality and the rice was a minimum versus other places that pack on the rice.

Service was quick, efficient and friendly. Get a booth because they're both comfy, private and the wood tables are gorgeous.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,5,0,5,MyXe3_QnZ9peSL1kjJUFkg

I went for the NY steak, shrimp tepan and scallops, while hubby went with NY steak, filet, and chicken. NY steak was tender, but it seems like it had been sitting in the chiller for a while, it had a weird taste to say the least. Filet was great, very tender, and it tasted like how beef should taste like. Chicken was chicken, nothing special. Shrimp was ok, a bit overcooked. Scallops, yet again perfectly seared, and very tender but it had a weird ammonia taste, will never order that again. Food, all in all was ok in proportion to the price tag. Just don't order the Kobe beef, 48 bucks for a 8 oz piece, if you're gonna pay that much, at least get that experience at Raku with Kobe and Wagyu beef.

- Located in the same shopping plaza as Cost Plus, Aaron Bros., and Barnes & Noble, on Rainbow, between Lake Mead and Smoke Ranch.
- From the time we walked in to the time we walked out, service was excellent.
- We opted for the hibachi dinner.  Hing was our chef and we had him all to ourselves.  He was very entertaining and had some mad skills with the utensils, swirling and swinging them as well as making the food catch fire, in a good way.
- I had the shrimp and chicken combo dinner, which came with soup (onion or miso) and a small salad to start.  
- Brown rice is available!
- 5 ounces of chicken and at least 4 ounces of shrimp for my dinner.  Mel got the filet mignon and salmon for his.
- Vegetables included mushrooms, onions, carrots, and broccoli.
- Everything was very tasty.
- For his finale, Hing did that thing where he tries to catapult a piece of food into your open mouth.  For us, he took one of my shrimp, cut it into three pieces and flung one piece at the b/f.  Missed on the first try, made it on the second.  My turn:  missed and the shrimp piece landed in my napkin--I ate it.
- Our dinner came to $52 minus the $40 Groupon = deal.  AND, they gave us a $10 gift card to use on the next visit!
- The place is very nicely decorated and spotless.  Even the bathroom is elegant and pristine.

The salmon teriyaki was the same story.  The yakisoba was 180 degrees the opposite direction, too much salty seasoning.  The decor is very nice, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance and vibe, but the mediocre food and bad Groupon experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  We won't be back.",IIumEd4NKdw9Iglfx6NjWA,0,0,1,xIpmsaMubYjuaGFFDXV4rw

Spacious family restaurant w/nice bar and huge menu.  Other Japanese and Asian selections are available on the cooked-food menu.,WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,1,0,3,s0sq8Q4nT5Q8wEflftK61g

Well I'm back in Vegas and was happy to find out that there was an Ohjah near my hotel. I visited them in hopes that they would be just as good as the other location. I was not disappointed. The sushi was delicious. 

I am knocking off 1 star due to the waiter not coming by once to ask how my meal was or if I wanted more water. I had to ask for more water when he came to take away the plates. Other than that, you can not go wrong eating here.",mz2V2aKcJ5i9pkqrciOEFA,1,0,4,kllE6-QHxtbcz6V1hIVQaQ

This dude is a true champ at what he does and he had the entire table fully engaged with his show. The food was very good (and plenty) but the Artful comedy and cooking of Chef Chad made it a memorable and special evening.

While we waited for our chef, we started out with Sex on the beach sushi roll which was excellent. We both ordered the 3 item combo with shrimp, scallops and filet mignon. We had a choice of rice, fried rice or fried noodles. We both enjoyed the fried rice and noodles. All the food was plentiful and very tasty at a moderate price. (Beats hell out of Benihana)

Make sure you ask for Chad when you make your reservations. You will not be sorry.",Q3Y0AjsTpuJuQ-TWZOlVzg,0,1,5,I1hZ5f7nARgboGjrlZki4g
5774222,2015-10-03,1,9U4Tqt5SkZKQ6eeH6IPSxQ,"Finally decided to drop in here and try out their hibachi dining after reading all the great reviews. Easy to get a seat as a solo at 5pm, I joined a small family celebrating their daughters birthday. At the other table was another family celebrating Grandma's birthday. I'd say the birthday girls were about 60 years apart in age, yet chose the same place on the same night......(insert spooky music)

I'm a huge fan of hibachi dining (teppanyaki) and have had many meals here and all over the US and world. The chefs are all good, but the show is running a little stale (how many onion volcano's can you see?) Someone needs to take it up a notch with some new jokes besides egg roll.

Anyways...on to the food. Pretty good. I had the combo with filet, teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki salmon. All cooked perfectly. Just lacked some flavor. As did the opening salad, the soup (not miso), the dipping sauces, the fried rice....all of it lacked an exciting flavor. So my 3 stars is mostly for the flavor of the food. Service was great, 5 stars. The chef was great, 5 stars.....Just the food needs to get punched up a bit and add some new seasonings besides basic salt, pepper, and butter. 

Its a nice restaurant, with a sushi bar as well. Its definitely a great price ($30.95 for the combo) which is lower than Geisha, Osaka, and others.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,1,3,hZ6Zh-2k9txPAPy5qE0NBQ

The fish tasted so fresh and clean, the portion sizes of the roles and slices of the fish were larger than average, and the prices were reasonable.  To top it off, they served us complimentary hot sake during our meal.   What more could you ask for?  I think I found my new favorite sushi place.

And, throughout the night I was quite pleased with the very brisk and attentive service and the quality and preparation of food served here, as well as the sophisticated Asian ambiance of the premises.

A medium-size Rainbow Roll was fine, and hot Calamari Tempura excellent.  Onion Soup was tasty, but with only a couple of curlicues of Green Onion circling about in the broth, about as basic as it could be.  The salad was more complex, and was a refreshing start.  Fried Rice with egg was nicely seasoned, and surprisingly included in lieu of Steamed Rice at no additional charge.  

When the entrees were plated, my medium rare Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly to order and melted in the mouth.  And my accompanying double order of shrimp featured very big and succulent plump shrimps that would have been fun to chomp down on had there not been so many to devour!  I had never before seen shrimp this large sizzling on a teppenyaki grill.  Al dente vegetables, including mushrooms, were good.  The grill master put on a good show, but the tricks were fairly standard except for suddenly pulling back a bowl of rice extended on a spatula just as a diner opened his hands to grasp it.

There are many rolls to choose from, as well as pork katsu, chicken teryaki etc... 
My roommate and I both have boyfriends that don't eat sushi, so this is our weekly place to go get away from the boys. It's always quiet, the booths are private, and the rolls come out in a timely manner.

Last time we ate here, we got the 3 roll special,  we got to choose 3 rolls from the list for 24$. We chose the Volcano roll (good, served wirh imitation crab salad and tiny scallops on top) 
Spiderman roll (perfect! My favorite, with eel, and garlic crunchies on top)
Show me the Love roll ( a little spicy, salmon and avocado on top). 
We also ordered the tempura banana (delicous) and the red bean mochi (different)

The server was courteous, attentive, fast, and efficient. The food (chicken, filet mignon) was delicious and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would have liked (and I should have asked for) would have been hot mustard to go along with the meats (I love hot mustard). But, everything was as perfect as can be.

I've been to quite a few other hibachi grills in Las Vegas and around the U.S. (New York, Honolulu, Orlando, etc.), but none can match the value of Ohjah (I'm almost tempted not to post this, since I'd hate to see the prices go up...LOL).

It really is as good as the other reviewers have posted and we'll definitely be going back.",RR6e9Flzur-FRBXq3x912g,0,0,5,g21VJaOTEzxNw1wMPM0rxw
