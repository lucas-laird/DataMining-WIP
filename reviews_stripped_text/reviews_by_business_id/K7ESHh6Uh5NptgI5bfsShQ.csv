1420402,2016-03-23,12,K7ESHh6Uh5NptgI5bfsShQ,"Yay, Peru Chicken has a new location! It's cleaner, larger, and closer to me. Really hoping this restaurant helps enliven the plaza and attract more businesses. In the mean time, pollo a la brasa and tallarin verde for everyone!

There are a growing number of places to get Peruvian food but  PC does it best- generously seasoned and juicy chicken, thickly-coated green noodles with medium-rare steak (and only $10!), cheap and crispy yucca frita. They also serve breakfast all day.

Service is quick and I really appreciate the upgraded space. One of these days I'll try their famous pumpkin donuts... or the lomo saltado. I tend to stick to the dishes I already know I like here, since they're done so well- on that note, maybe stick to the fried sides instead of rice, beans, and salad.

1460924,2016-05-09,10,K7ESHh6Uh5NptgI5bfsShQ,"Move over KFC! This is another finger licking good place! It makes El Pollo Loco look loca! I agree with the other Yelper...Peru Chicken for President 2016! I can't believe I've been deprived of this delicious South American cuisine! Seriously, this should be on the list of ""Thousand Things to Eat Before You Die""! Hahaha!

On my recent visit, I made sure it was a Saturday, why? I was told that their green rice (which is made up of lots of cilantro that makes the rice green) is only available on Saturdays. Oh my goodness! If you like cilantro, you will definitely love this rice! I found myself just eating this wonderful rice by itself.

The Peruvian rotisserie chicken is out of this world. Whatever seasoning they put in there makes me want to do the happy dance! Their chicken is always moist and tender. The chicken is no zone condiments for me, although they do offer 2 different green sauces (mild and spicy). The plantains that come as a side is cooked to perfection and quite honestly, it's one of the best plantains I ever had and maybe even prefer these plantains over Jamaican plantains the way it's prepared here.

I ordered the aguadito with chicken, potatoes, carrots, and peas. Wow, this soup was so flavorful I wouldn't mind just sipping the broth. The picarones were really good, but the fruit honey is an acquired taste for me. I couldn't resist not ordering these donut like made with sweet potato and pumpkin.

Peru Chicken has set the new standard for how I like my rotisserie chicken. The staff here is great and their magic number seems to be ""5"" as in ready in five minutes. That's what I call super-duper fast service! This little treasure (in what feels like an abandoned plaza) is tucked away for other locals to see. I'm very happy depending on the day of the week, it's only three miles from my work, but unfortunately they don't offer delivery.

Located about 10 minutes away from downtown Las Vegas in a shopping mall parking lot you will not find any of the glitz and glam that you will usually expect to see in Las Vegas. Simply put you go here for the delicious food. If you like Peruvian food or have a desire to try it you will not be disappointed. The menu is simple - baked Peruvian chicken with either rice, fries and frijoles or a basic salad for a main course. That's it. There are also a variety of appetizers including ceviche which is excellent if you have a taste for raw fish. The atmosphere is friendly - local Hispanic/South American and the food is simply delicious. If you want to try a cuisine that is savory and different then you need to add this to your list.

Reminds me of my grandma's salads & that's a very good thing. 1/2 chicken ended up being way too much for us. It heated up nicely & was still very moist the next day.

If you want to try authentic Peruvian rotisserie chicken, the famous pollo a la brasa, go to Peru Chicken. This new location features the same menu and a larger seating area than the original, with several booths for dining in. I only come here for the side dishes, but everything comes out of the fryer deliciously crispy and non-greasy. Even the simple side salad is flavorful with a red wine vinaigrette. Most sides are only $2, so skip all those fast food places and come straight here. A fast food drive thru isn't going to give you ají verde, yellow sauce, and white sauce with your French fries, so you'd be missing out. Drink the refreshing chicha morada.

Don't skip dessert, either. Traditional picarones, pumpkin doughnuts studded with anise seeds, are soaked in a brown sugar syrup that's also perfect for dipping fried sweet plantains. I'll bet it's even better a la mode, with a scoop of exotic lúcuma ice cream. Additionally, they make flan and leche quemada. You won't find any liquor at Peru Chicken, but one of the highlights about this new location is that Herbs & Rye is right across the street. I'll be stopping there before or after my Peruvian feast for the best pisco sour in the city; I have it all planned out.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,18,19,5,-9kB5FHZly-l0Uas7TVA8w

*Food:
I have literally tried 90% of their entire menu!
Yes! I get greedy when i come to this place but before we didn't have a peruvian restaurant in Hawaii, so it was my only chance to get this food! 
Plus I ABSOLUTELY LOVE their prices! 
You will be good with anything you order from here but my top recommendations are:
-Ceviche ($10.95)
-1/2 pollo con papas ($6.50)
-Lomo saltado ($10.95)

It's probably the only chicken I've ever gotten where I eat the actual meat first and don't just pick at it for the skin (the skin is also delicious, extremely flavorful, and well-seasoned though). After eating here, I found myself days after still craving the Yuquitas a la Huancaina (fried yuca root with huancaina sauce)... they have a ton of other amazing sauces they provide (i.e. the crack sauce everyone loves), but I especially liked dipping other foods in the huancaina sauce. The Maracuya (passion fruit juice) is worth an order, although I did see a lot of folks ordering the inca kola as well. The fries that come with the chicken are crispy and the salad, although very basic lettuce/tomatoes/cucumber with a vinaigrette, goes really well with the chicken. I'm not sure what people expect that are disappointed with the salad - It's a lot of amazing food at a very low cost. We have gotten the picarones for dessert as well, but wasn't a big fan of the fruit honey. Looking forward to trying the other desserts though!",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,7,9,5,Lr-x4Jf9Icu8gTxPld-QyA

The restaurant is not big if you plan to dine in, but it wasn't too crowded. Service was prompt and attentive, though the employees seemed very invested in a football (i.e. soccer) game that was playing on TV. Decor is basic.

I'm also pretty impressed by their ceviche appetizer, which is large enough to share. The shrimp and fish were great and it also included some sweet potato and large-kernel variety of choclo corn.

Peru Chicken is not just good, their rotisserie chicken is really, really good.  Peru Chicken might just be my favorite place for rotisserie chicken in Las Vegas.  Each chicken meal comes with a side, but ordering a la carte is an option too.  Price for a half chicken is only $6 and it's more than enough food to keep me happy for a few hours.  The chicken is seasoned to perfection, very tasty, big on meat, and simply delicious.  I have also tried other items on their menu, including their sautéed beef and even a side of hotdogs.  You can't go wrong with those dishes too.  But if you ask me, it's all about their chicken.  

The restaurant is located off Sahara and can easily be missed if you're not specifically looking for it.  There's one TV and it's usually set on ESPN Deportes.  The restaurant is small and the staff is as nice as can be.  Bottom line...you get a lot of good food for your money at Peru Chicken.

Pollo con Arroz y Frijoles ($16.50): Whole rotisserie chicken with rice and beans. This is what you're coming for, the chicken. Peru's version of rotisserie chicken is bursting with flavor and spices. IT IS GOOD. Really, really good. Delicious, moist, and serious poultry perfection. The best deal is the whole chicken which you can share or save for another meal (or meals). I love getting the rice and beans, but there are options for salad, fries, etc. Typically, it comes with long-grain white rice (very fragrant; think Jasmine rice), however, on Saturdays, you get Arroz Verde. Y-E-S. You want the beautiful, tasty green rice. Also, their Frijoles is made with canary beans - delish!

Lomo Saltado ($10): Beef or chicken sauteed with onions, tomatoes, and fries; served with long-grain white rice. One of the most popular Peruvian dishes and for good reason. It's one of the original fusion dishes, influenced by Chinese settlers' saute technique and use of soy sauce. It is delicious and super fragrant. Also, do you need another reason to eat fries?

Arroz Chaufa ($9): Beef or chicken fried rice. Another Peruvian-Chinese dish and just as delicious as Lomo Saltado. I really don't know which one I like better. Basically the same idea, except there's eggs and no tomatoes or fries. Might be one of the best fried rice dishes I've ever had; no shortage of flavor anywhere.

Papas Fritas ($2): Good ol' fries. These are delicious and you have the amazing sauces to accompany them! I must get these on the side, all the time.

I'm a huuuuuge fan of this spot. The food is insanely good and I seriously can't get enough! And one of these days, I'll finally leave room for dessert. LOL.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,8,13,5,EwWlMgttz9uvfLsOD4WvmQ

It's funny that Peruvian food was one of the ethnic cuisines that the valley has been lacking. I'd usually have to wait till I head to the DC or Miami to get my fix. 

By default I ordered a 1/2 chicken w/ fries and a salad. 

The yellow aji sauce was a little runny however was still delicious. 
The green aji had the right consistency and nice spicy kick! This was what I used to accompany my chicken and papas The one reason why I had to 3 star this place was due to the sad salad that came with my chicken. It totally was dead.. Yellow chunks and withered soggy lettuce. I didn't make a stink about it as I came hear for the Chicken and crack sauce. 
This place is not Sardis but it will satisfy the craving for now.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,3,4,3,0yGx3tNX_ZdkiUeALq-Fmw
