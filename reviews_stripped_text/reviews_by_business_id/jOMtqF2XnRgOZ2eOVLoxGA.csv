163806,2017-12-08,0,jOMtqF2XnRgOZ2eOVLoxGA,I was looking for a place to have some catfish fry. I came across this little hole in the wall on yelp and decided try it out. The Asian and Southern fusion style was what caught my attention. I couldn't decide what I wanted so I ended up getting the Bruce LeRoy (veggie fried rice with 3 fried whole wing) and a catfish sandwich.  I took it togo with the intension of eating it at my office but the food smelled so good I ate it in my car in the parking lot. The veggie fried rice was the best I have had and I ended up walking back into the business and ordered a large box. The whole wings and the catfish was fried perfect with just the right amount seasoning. This place will be on my list of regular places to eat.,9SMFManpMr_wDzhlBeH6Mg,0,1,5,MlnkAXmo1v95tSkmulB2qQ

I ordered a small shrimp fried rice and small shrimp egg foo young. The fried rice was perfectly seasoned and made fresh to order...a solid 5 out of 5! The egg foo young was also flavorful and came with a small order of white rice. 

Although I didn't order a dessert, I plan to try the Chardonnay cake next time I stop by. I love how my food was made fresh when I ordered, but I'll definitely call ahead to avoid the 20-25 minute wait.",6LdB0Gfh9wc97urNuoOZiA,0,0,5,NQ5uUvO4VBzySGqTx9Lwsw

I have eaten a lot of places because it's what I like after a long days work. This is not the case at this ""Asian soul food""This is the worst soul food I ever had. Way over priced. The chicken was chewy and covered in fat. The gravy had no flavor. The yams and collards were terrible. It tasted like wet lettuce and sweet potatoe with a dash of cinnamon. They weren't even cooked all the way through and had a nasty end piece in it with the root still slightly attached. This was by far the worst food I have eaten in a long time. They probably serve better food in prison. They charged 13 dollars for this pathetic attempt at ""soul food"".

Ms. Georgia came to the window and told us about her menu and that she makes everything fresh so the wait is a little long. Kids are aloud but i would not bring mine here to smoky even for me.

1989782,2014-08-25,1,jOMtqF2XnRgOZ2eOVLoxGA,"I was away from my typical neighborhood stomping grounds when I suddenly had a craving for fried chicken. I found this spot, Soul Foo Young and just had to try it - Chinese food and Southern food - together!

I walked into the bar, went to the order window and dinged the bell. Georgia came to the window and started up on telling me all about the food she was serving that day, she is so nice and clearly cooks with southern love. I went for the Bruce Leroy special - which is from the movie  ""The Last Dragon"" from the 80's. I used to watch that movie all the time! The Bruce Leroy consists of 3 southern style fried chicken wings with Chinese fried rice. 

The food is cooked to order - and good fried chicken takes at least 15 minutes. So it is fresh, it just takes a little while. When it did finally come out, it was soo tasty. The Chinese fried rice really goes well with southern fried chicken which was crunchy and well seasoned. Her fried chicken took me back to the time I visited Jackson, Mississippi. So yummy. Next time I would like to try her chicken smothered in gravy, egg foo young, and collard greens - since I have to get my veggies in somehow.

One of the things about this spot is that it inside the Double Diamond Bar and because it is a bar, next time I would definitely order ahead for take out - unfortunately eating at the smoky bar can take away from the yummy food Georgia is serving up.

Call ahead, ask Georgia for recommendations, and order for take out!",P8I1j-p6hxYrewXFCdkXLQ,1,1,4,ac2smpJNe-6hglhMkR0kZA

The chicken had a really good flavor and fried to perfection. She gave me a sample of the mac and cheese and I was sold.... One side of that please. I also had a side of collard greens that came with a piece of hot water cornbread that looked like an egg roll. The greens were not cooked with any meat so they weren't as flavorful as I would've thought but with an added pinch of salt and eating them along with the cornbread, they were quite tasty too.

2900442,2018-04-27,0,jOMtqF2XnRgOZ2eOVLoxGA,"This little gem here needs to be closer to downtown Vegas.  I was heading to Sam's Club and spotted what I thought was a typo on their temporary restaurant banner but when I looked again and saw, ""Asian Soul Food,"" below, I had to quickly make a u-turn to find out what in the devil was this. I know a lot of Chinese joints have fried chicken wings on their menus but that's hardly soul food. I'm so glad I went there because the owner was very welcoming and super friendly but the food was out of sight. I'm still bewildered on the flavor profile that tastes better than many Chinese places I've been. I was ear hustling a lot of repeat customers in there singing its praises on almost everything Asian.  I got the combination fried rice which comprises of chicken, shrimp and beef, (I think or pork) and all I can say is that I was totally shocked with the texture and consistency and how it resembled our Asian brothers and sisters and not Big Mama. They do not put peas and carrots in their rice only egg, onions, scallions and bean sprouts.  I was trying to peek in the back to see if I saw a lil Asian person there but nope, there were sistas throwing down like that.  They even have a touch of Asian and Soul in one of their specials called, ""Bruce Leroy."" I chuckled when I saw that.  Anyway, I'm planning on revisiting before leaving to try the dishes repeat customers bragged about: egg foo young, egg rolls, tamales and of course that fried rice.  I'd suggest if any of you are in Vegas, please make this a go to. Oh and that banana pudding looks delish! Didn't try it but I might.",9JqMNwzRJiJh2-A21jVJmw,0,0,5,W-kZ5YI7DvDw8sO3gTCszg

Small place, basically just a counter with few stools. I came on a Saturday afternoon and it was fairly busy.
A cute little boy took my order and actually new the menu pretty well. You can tell this is a family owned business and there were also some regualrs ordering.
I ordered the fried chicken wings and combo fried rice.
Chicken was moist and tender, and fries were fresh cut and crunchy.
The fried rice was so good! Full of shrimp, chicken, and I think some smoked meat. It had asian flavor with some smokiness, and spice. 
For desert I had the banana pudding which was sweet full of cookies, and decadent.
The Chardonnay cake was a surprise. Super moist and full of flavor. 
Nice size portions and reasonable prices.
They were out of sweet tea and their signature watapoli.

Mac and cheese was RFG (really fantastically good). Collard greens were perfect. Yams were awesome.

When you walk in you're greeted by a very friendly hostess and the smell of delicious soul food. The ambiance isn't upscale by any measure, but what you will bring home to eat will definitely deter you from making judgments based on the way the book looks on the outside. I enjoyed the conversation with the hostess while I waited, mainly because she is also from Chicago as well, and we connected on so many levels. Not to mention, all of the patrons were very happy too...good food'll do that to you. 

Now to the food! I ordered the catfish dinner w/okra and rice & gravy. I also picked up the 4 wing dinner with cabbage and Mac & cheese for the Mrs. I was happy to see that my catfish dinner had two HUGE, REAL, and DELICIOUS fillets! You see, here in the desert, it's difficult to find fresh catfish that is not swai, and there's is no knockoff. Okra was delicious too with generous portions. Also difficult to find in LV are WHOLE chicken wings fried to perfection while bursting with flavor. Well, I found them here. I only got to eat one wing, as my lady and I swapped portions of our dinners,  but we both knew instantly that we were in tastebud bliss. Oh, and the Mac and cabbage took me back to my grandma's kitchen...absolutely perfect.

We washed it all down with a couple of Wapatooli's (just get you some, it's heaven in a cup) and shared a fresh, moist piece of Carmel cake. If I had to take off half a star, it would be due to the short hours. This place is only open six hours per day for six days, and I find it difficult to get there due to working hours.
