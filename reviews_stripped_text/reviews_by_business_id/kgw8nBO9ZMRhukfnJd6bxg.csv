110994,2015-01-12,1,kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg,"We came here on a Tuesday night and although it was very busy and we didn't have a reservation, we had almost no wait.  The hostess was pleasant and asked how our night was on the way to showing us our table which was right next to the windows making it prime real estate for people watching.  We used to always go to the original Grape Street on Lake Mead but wanted to wait a few weeks before checking out this new location because of the adjustment period.  I read some of the reviews, everybody mentioned the noise level.  I mean, it's not like the music was loud, it was a packed restaurant, I'm not sure what everybody expected.  We had a nice booth and all the privacy we needed to carry on an intimate conversation.

Anyway, on to the food and service.  Waiter was great, LITERALLY smiling every time he came to our table.  I know from experience the baked brie takes longer to fire up and he also gave us the heads up in case we were unaware.  He threw that in immediately while we perused the menu.  The manager/wine director stopped by our table because we mentioned to our waiter that we were going to have some wine but were unsure.  Bobby (I think that was his name? Bad memory...) was told this so he wanted to help us decide.  Myself and my girl, honestly, you could give us boxed wine and we won't complain.  We're easy like that.  He took the time to go over almost every wine they carry and match it up with whatever potential entree we were going to order.  I know he was busy and he had other stuff to do, but the commitment to assisting our wine decision was impressive.  We ultimately ordered a bottle and couldn't have been happier.

For food, in addition to the baked brie, we had the steamed clams, chicken gorgonzola and grilled chicken caesar.  All were great and came out quickly.  The chicken gorgonzola I ordered with blackened chicken by our waiter's recommendation and it wasn't too spicy, just perfect.  I like the clams because I enjoy dipping the bread in the broth and the Caesar tastes just like the original location's.  All in all, this was a great experience.  Like I mentioned, we were already partial to the original location, but this new one is even closer and considering that it is in the very popular downtown summeriln, we will definitely be coming to this new one from now on. The service was great from the hostess to our waiter to the wine sommelier.    We will be back as long as the experience is always like this one.",zXeu7jLgiGAouf9k1B2duw,0,0,5,aYaaAHqmpT3_JpxcatGvww

They seem more interested in serving wine and alcohol then food at this location.

I should have left at that point, but elected to sit in the back room thinking it would be cooler.  After eating my pasta, I was covered with sweat.  I asked the guy at the front desk about this and he said that they try to keep the windows open for the ""cool vibe.""  Not cool if you are too hot to enjoy your meal and wine.  He really did not seem to care at all.  About the food, I had the Penne ala vodka with shrimp.  The shrimp was borderline tasteless and tiny.  I well remember this dish at the Lake Mead location, and it was stellar.  
We are scheduled to have dinner on Wednesday.  I will call first to see if I need to wear shorts and a tee shirt.  If so, that will be the last dinner here.  Too bad...I was looking forward to a go-to restaurant close to home,  John:  please wise up on this.  We need AC in the summer.

Carl, who seemed wasted, was dropping bottles, asking us what we had to drink for our tab when we literally ordered 2 minutes right before, and had no clue what he was doing.

She attempted to sit me at a table for two in an interior position. Asked for a brighter, 4-Top by the window and commented to her, ""that is isn't crowded right now."" She remained silent.

The Server arrived promptly and took my order. He subsequently returned six times during my sandwich to inquire if I needed anything, asked if I was ""just hanging out or if I had anything to do today"", if I was finished yet (I was still eating). He was attentive but overly so.

The complimentary loaf of bread was warm but uninteresting and tasted like yesterday's bake. Butter seemed to be margarine, but I may be wrong. I had the Portobello Philly Sandwich (portobello mushrooms saut√©ed with onions & peppers topped with smoked gouda $12.00) which was good, except for a crusty but also uninteresting french roll upon which it was served.

The breads are supposedly homemade but are airy, without much strength or bite. Similar to grocery store fare.

Several men were stocking the wines located behind the bar with much hollering back and forth and crashing of bottles. One man was on a ladder stocking and shouting from behind the wine bottles to the men at the front of the bar.

When I lunch, even by myself, I want to feel welcome. The lack of interplay by the hostess and the racket created by the workmen was a huge turnoff.

Several friends and I are slated to lunch at Grape Street Summerlin in a few weeks. I will make reservations in person the day before and select the table at which we wish to be seated and will provide a report once we have lunched with them.",zY-wT1OZDBhZKbsSyvQg5w,0,0,1,YsB8V4QyiDoASPXQYSdqXA

Literally 10 minutes later and still that table was not cleared and we're just waiting ... in comes the guy in question asking if we've been helped (which was a good start, to his credit) .. when I recapped the situation, pointed out the empty table and said we had been waiting for the hostess .. he snapped back with ""we appreciate patience"" (said in a very rude tone). I was surprised and pretty much bit my tongue (I have worked in restaurants and know how some of these guys will seek out ""revenge"" -- better to file it away for yelp readers). 

GSC: yes you were busy, but you won't be in the future if this kind of treatment of your customers becomes the norm.

When the server brought out the ""sandwich"" (just grilled veggies essentially) it had a side dish that looked rice-like but i wasn't sure so i asked the server ""is this rice"" to which he responded ""yes"". I tried the rice and started to swallow the first bite and then spit it out because the texture was not right. I called the server back and asked him is he was SURE this was rice. He then said ""ill check"" and went back to the kitchen before telling me it was orzo pasta - aka not gluten free. I immediately asked for a manager. The fact that the waiter never even asked about sides when i mentioned gluten free was just one of the things that was wrong. The manager came over and I explained the situation and he stated that my sandwich would be taken care of. A few minutes later, the waiter came over and asked ""how is everything?"" essentially as if he didn't royally mess up my order resulting in my having a bit of something with gluten when i am gluten intolerant. I looked at him surprised and said ""uh, its ok i guess"". He then gave me a dirty look and turned away muttering under his breath ""I wasn't the one who said it"" - referring to the serve telling me that the side dish was rice. 1. this was incredibly rude and 2. it was his fault the orzo was on the plate in the first place since he did not make sure my dish was gluten free and did not do the extra work to make sure the side dish was too. From then on, he would not make eye contact or acknowledge me. When he took my plate away i said ""thank you"" and he would not even look at me. He never filled our water glasses a single time. He came back and asked my friend ""how was YOUR dish honey"" keeping his back to me. Later, he brought a dessert menu, turned his back to me when he placed it and also placed the menu directly in front of her and turned only towards her in a very pointed sign of disdain towards me. As the manager had never returned to our table after the first time, I immediately went up to speak to him. After so many blatant signs of disrespect coming from our arrogant waiter - that my friend was shocked by - i was shaking I was so upset. I went to the manager and explained the whole situation to him and he said he was sorry and that the whole bill would be taken care of. While I appreciated the manager's handling of the situation with me, I am just appalled by the treatment by the waiter. It will certainly be hard for me to ever return.",3sI_Mm-K3sWpu3rO-E23BA,1,0,1,0fOU7F9kH27bUtpHsckVAg

I have to echo the confusion about how this place only has 2.5 stars.  We just had a terrific meal with Kirbie and Mgr Carl F and could not have been more pleased. 

First, didn't want to spend a ton on wine but wanted to drink good stuff. Carl F recommended some really cool grapes. 

Second, Kirbie was awesome. Food came as expected for a Saturday evening at a popular restaurant and she was terrific.  She suggested items and was always around. 

Third, I had enjoyed a meal here a few months ago and the service and food were equally impressive. Again, sure there was a wait but it's a new place and those of us who have enjoyed new places know this is inevitable. You are not at Chilis!

Fourth, I had eaten at the original location for years and this location didn't disappoint. 

Fifth, we got see a table of crazy folks throw a fit. Carl F handled it like a pro but these people had their heart set on a being pissed so I hope life improves because if that's how they react at a restaurant I can only imagine how they handle real life.

- Very cool/modern decor and setup
- Extremely loud because it was very busy
- Not romantic as we could barely hear one another
- We were cold at our booth
- There was a table of drunk females across the dining room that were laughing/cackling so loud I wanted to stab them in the eye with my fork. In the restaurant's defense, this definitely hurt our experience. 

Service:
- Got seated within 5 minutes
- Got drinks and bread quickly
- Waiter was very nice and polite
- Delay between salad and dinner was VERY long (too long)
- Delay between dinner and dessert was terribly long.
- Delay between dessert and getting the check was even longer. I couldn't find our waiter and he came back in reeking of smoke from his smoke break.

Food:
- Bread and whipped butter was simple but delicious
- Both my Caesar salad and wife's house salad were chopped (love it) but EXTREMELY ""oniony"" despite there being no onions in the salad!  It was WAYYYY overpowering and left a terrible onion aftertaste that I still have hours later. And I love onion!
- My wife's chicken Parmesan was tasty but pretty basic. My filet Oscar (filet mignon, mashed potato, asparagus, crab leg, bearnaise sauce, and wine reduction) was just ok. Everything we ate had an excessive amount of parsley sprinkled on it. For the price of the dishes.....ehhhh.
- Dessert: 3 profiteroles filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate, caramel, and raspberry sauce. It was ""just ok"" unfortunately.  Desserts were priced reasonably at $8

More than it was worth

It started off on a bad note as they were playing Christmas music (its Jan...) when we walked in and later changed the music to rock and had it up so loud we had to ask our server to turn it down as we couldn't even talk to each other. 

The server was mediocre never explaining any specials or welcoming us to the restaurant.  We ordered bottles of wine and as he is going around the table pouring it he proceeded to pour red wine into one of girls white wines never even noticing, and poured the wine into another gentleman's dirty wine glass from a different wine he had earlier at the bar. 

The service as a whole was really lacking as we had empty water glasses throughout dinner and when we were done, they cleared the plates and never came back to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee etc and when he brought the check he had charged us for the white wine he had ruined when he poured the red into it.

We sat at the bar and the bartenders were all nice and cute and made friendly conversation with us. The wine and service were good. 

Went back with a girlfriend for dinner last night and we were able to sit outside and enjoy the patio. Our waiter was a bit late coming buy our table but was very friendly. He didn't stop by too often, but was very nice and helpful when he did. We had the Burrata for a starter and it was good - nothing out of the ordinary, but in my opinion, you can't go wrong with burrata. We both ordered salads - Greek and Caesar - and they were good but nothing to rave about. They were a little drenched in dressing, but for the Caesar salad they did have a small option which was perfect for me. 

The dessert menu was pretty big, in my opinion, and our waiter suggested that we have a look at it. We did, and had a couple in mind. Asked him what his favorite was - not on our list - but decided to give it a try.  We had the Apple Tart and it was pretty amazing. 

The atmosphere on the patio was very nice - some people came in with their dogs and the dogs behaved just fine. The sun started to get in some people's eyes as it was setting and the restaurant staff were able to move some shades or something around and get the sun out of their eyes which was nice and accommodating.

Seated, servers came right over to take drink orders and inform us of specials. The servers were all very professional punctual and friendly. Service was quick.

For dinner I had the grilled cheese and fries. It was great! Grilled cheese in untraditional. It's like a ricotta cheese on a long roll. It was a nice change from a regular grilled cheese and made me feel fancy. Fries were seasoned nicely. Wish they had honey mustard as a dressing option, but again fancy casual. 


For dessert I had the tiramisu, W-O-W... easily the best tiramisu I have EVER had. Was the perfect blend of cake and cream with out being soaked. Loved every bite of it.

The place has a great atmosphere that drew me in for a quick bite even though I was alone. They were friendly and promptly seated me on the patio as requested. 

The food: I didn't have to wait long for fresh bread (good on the inner but very hard on the outside) however I had to wait a little while for the butter they forgot to serve with the bread...which I eventually asked for. I was happy when they had a vegetarian soup of the day and figured I would be safe ordering the house salad. When asked if I wanted chicken added, I clearly declined. The salad was served tossed and finely chopped almost like coleslaw. After eating 4 or 5 bites I noticed small chicken pieces in the salad. 

I summoned the waiter who at first tried to convince me it wasn't chicken lol. He then asked if it was a problem. 

Yes it was. Congrats you messed up a simple salad and lost a customer.

He answered all questions about the specials, brought our drinks, and brought bread that was really hot out of the oven. For our meal, my wife and I decided to try the special 24 ounce ribeye steak. It was prepared with a bleu cheese rub and carmelized onions on top. It was scrumptious. Unless you have a huge appetite, there was more than enough food to share. It also came with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. Also extremely well done. My only gripe with the restaurant is the noise level in the dining room. The dining tables are immediately next to the bar. And the bar was extremely loud ( did I mention it was the night before Super Bowl?)

We took my in laws to here last night for my father in laws birthday. 

When we arrived, I said we had a reservation and stated my father in laws name. 

The hostess said a name strikingly similar to his (same first McSomething for the last). 

She said we arrived first. 

We waited. And waited. And waited. 

Then we received a phone call asking where we were, we said at the restaurant. Dad said, we've been waiting for you for an hour. 

Let's recap. The hostess sat two couples from the same party, same reservation at opposite ends of the restaurant. 

We told our server, he replied, ""hmm, it happens.""

Except it doesn't happen in real life, it's like we were in a cartoon. 

Honestly, I could get over the seating issue, I'd someone had taken ownership of this situation. 

The server took our order at our parent's table. 

No manager ever stopped by. Not to check on us, or apologize for the situation. 

And that's just this time. 

The last time we were here, the food runner handed me my brother in laws plate and asked me to put it in front of him. 

I'd be ok with this if we were sharing tips, but the bastard didn't even tip me out.

MIKE is a true  professional  and shared my passion  for Grape Street's awesome history of being a fun and delicious  place to dine. He immediately had the chef prepare the dish I sent back so he could taste it and look into what went wrong. He agreed it was off and wanted to make it right. We had a great conversation about food and service. His passion for his customers and the restaurant  was evident.

Thanks Mike for being so accommodating  and concerned about our experience. I am definitely rooting  for Grape Steet to iron out the kinks and get back to the consistency and great food I come for.

The wine selection is decent, but I felt for something named ""Grape Street,"" they probably should have had at least 50% more to chose from. Though the wall of wine was mesmerizing and distracting, so that may be a minor complaint in the scheme of things. We ended up ordering two bottles of wine, and they were both great, though maybe $10 or so overpriced. 

Our server was great, he was very attentive, professional and friendly. He was incredibly knowledgeable about all of the food and wine, and helped us make good selections with both. No complaints on the staff end. Though it was a little annoying that we were seated next to the bar and some off-duty kitchen employees were clearly hanging at the bar because the staff kept congregating near them and ended up making the area around our table a little more crowded than it needed to be. 

The food, we only had appetizers, was pretty solid. The baked brie was, as everyone else has raved, pretty amazing, and I couldn't stop eating it.

It's easily accessible by parking on the east side of the mall by Regal or Dillards. The ambiance was on point- rustic yet colorful, casual yet chic. But!, it's another restaurant with tables a little too close for comfort. If they remove even 2 tables & spread the rest of the tables out a bit, they'll be golden. Our waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable & the right level of attentive. & pretty easy on the eyes. The complimentary bread wasn't super flavorful but it was soft & the whipped butter was good. At the waiter's suggestion, I ordered the Portobello philly with chicken added & my lunch dates ordered the chicken parm sandwich & the steak salad. The philly came with some sort of cold rice pilaf salad... I have no idea what it was but it was simple & I seemed to enjoy it. The philly was fantastic- the bread for both sandwiches was the same as the complimentary bread & was the perfect sandwich bread. It even held up reheating the next day! The verdict on the chicken parm sandwich was ""really good"". & the fries were highly rated by all of us. We both tasted the steak salad- the general consensus was that it's yummy. But!, the salad could use a bit more substance with mushrooms or croutons, etc. It seemed a bit like a generic side salad with steak on it. It doesn't do the steak justice.

We had a party of 21 and one AMAZING waiter named John (of course he had support from other staff but he was the one that was taking the orders and coming back to check on us). He was soooooo attentive and went above and beyond. For example, we had two children 3 years of age, we had forgotten their apple juice and apple slices. John found an apple for us and cut it into slices for the kids. He couldn't find apple juice so he made the kids chocolate milk. They didn't have chocolate milk but he managed to create it for the kids. Totally saved the night. All the drinks (alcohol or non-alcoholic) came out super fast. We didn't even have to ask for refills because they were filling up our cups or asking us if we wanted an alcoholic drink. The food was amazing. Not sure what the food complaints were about. I had the tomato basil soup, the sea bass and Brie appetizer which was a must (it does take 20 minutes to come out but sooooo worth it. Just order it ASAP. Trust me you won't regret it). My Roomate ordered the baked penne which was a must and so delicious. I wish I had taken photos but I had left my phone behind by accident. No worries because I will definitely be coming back.

After listening to the amazing list of specials we decided on the Baked Brie appetizer. This dish takes time to prepare so order early. What a very delicious dish, served with crostini and sliced fruit, I want to try and make this dish ar home. 

All entrees that we tried were very flavorful. I had a black end chicken carbonara pasta dish with a creamy Alfredo sauce. Yum! Everyone else enjoyed their dishes as well.

For dessert we had the cheesecake and Creme Brulee that had a proper sugary crust.  The cheesecake had a delicious crust and was thick and creamy NY style. You can tell alot of care and profesionalism  goes into the preparation of the food in this kitchen.

 Overall a great first visit that will keep us coming back for more. As the sun went down it did start to get cold in the building with all the doors opened and no heaters on. The energy in the room was somber yet electric with the Vegas Golden Knights on TV.

Our waiter was beyond rude the entire time, I don't even know what to say.  We all have bad days sometimes but this was ridiculous.  Call in sick if your not able to treat your customers like human beings. We are 20-25% tippers and due to the horrific service we decided to be generous with 10%, he deserved nothing.  When we left he actually followed us outside and said ""thanks a lot ladies"" while crumbling up a piece of paper aggressively.

To start, there was a hour and half wait. Which really wasn't all that bad because you're in a mall! so actually went down to the Crave and had a few drinks at the bar. When we came back it was basically time to be seated. 

Took about 15 minutes just to get water. Once the waiter came we ordered right away because we were almost sure the food was going to take forever. It actually didn't. Food came out a reasonable amount of time. The thing that didn't was my friends cocktail she ordered. After 30 minutes in they finally told her they didn't have that particular drink. Then she wanted a beer which came AFTER we were already done with our food. 

I ordered the Filet Oscar. Got my meat medium rare. Nope, that was as well done as can be! The meat was sitting on mashed potatoes with crab on top of the meat, topped with asparagus which everything was swimming in a sauce. honestly, the whole dish was nothing special. For $38 I really hoped it would be Amazing. My dish came out with a Caesar salad which also was bland. I know it's just a salad but there was basically no dressing.

I had some sparkling wine and my husband ordered one of their listed pinot noir but our waiter said he does not recommend it and steered him towards a higher priced pinot. When I was brought my wine, our waiter claimed that he remembered serving me this particular wine on my last visit. Odd. Since we just told him a few minutes ago that we've never been to this restaurant before. My husband ordered the veal parmigiana which was a decent portion, tender and tasty. I just had the mussels in red sauce appetizer. It was standard but there were only six pieces.

When we asked for the check, I made a joke to our waiter about having him bring our check to the next table. He said that he couldn't do that and went on some long-winded anecdote on how some other table paid for someone else's meal. OK, so he also forgot that he gave us someone else's check earlier.

Ambiance (4/5) The atmosphere was pretty cool! The wall of wine was quite impressive and they had us seated in front of a large projector screen TV showing the National Championship game! Very cool. 

Food (3/5) I personally had the manicotti dish. This dish was okay. I can't say anything bad about it, just that it lacked the ""wow"" factor. My friend had the philly cheese steak and said it was pretty much the same thing. It wasn't bad at all, there was just nothing about it that made it stand out. Not bad, not great. Had better, had worse.

I did really enjoy the HH app of Meatballs and garlic bread for only $7! The meatballs were tasty and the garlic bread pretty good as well.

Service (3/5)  Service was a-okay. Waters were filled and orders brought out. As much as I had read about great service from so many of these reviews, we weren't blown away by the service we received here. It wasn't terrible, mind you. 

I'm betting you're picking up on a general theme here, huh? This place wasn't terrible, but also wasn't anything special. Our experience here was alright, but I honestly don't see myself ever coming back here. There are just too many great dining options in this incredible city to check out and enjoy!

I had the pleasure of meeting the management staff, Jeremy and Chris. When our table was available, Jeremy promptly took us to our table and recommended some starters and introduced us to Nick, our server. Nick was wonderful. He explained the specials and his recommendations. I initially wanted the chicken parm, usually my fav, but the rest of my party ordered the surf and turf special so I had to do the same. I didn't want to be jealous, after the fact. 

While waiting for out entrees, we had the crab stuffed shrimp. It was pretty good. Only gripe was there was 5 pieces for 3 of us. Needless to say, my friends had the majority. The entrees came and were plated wonderfully. The filet and lobster was cooked to perfection. The vegetables were good and serving of mashed potatoes was a little heavy for me. Plus, I wanted to indulge with some desserts. 

Jeremy had touched out table a few times throughout dinner and said we should try to the cheesecake and chocolate mousse. My party was a little quiet as they eyed the souffl√© hit again, we we not disappointed. I have to say, the mousse is my favorite dessert on the menu. 

Tonight's experience was definitely what was I expected. I came one during their opening week and it was extremely crowded and the wait times were understandably a little longer, however, this time, the service, food and overall feel was spot on.

3662280,2015-01-05,0,kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg,"5 star rating based on the amazing food. We had Chicken Marsala & the Portabella Philly. Fantastic!!  Was so disappointed with the quality of service. Would only give it a 0 star! 

The dining room behind the bar is cozy & nice. However the main dining area in front of the bar is casual, noisy, crowded. Great for happy hour and dining with friends or lunch but not great for couples or anyone wanting to have a decent conversation without raising your voice. 

The wine list booklet looked like a 2 year old had been playing with it tattered torn & written on. We waited forever just to get water & bread. The waitress could not give any info on wine. We had to ask for water refills every time, was never offered additional bread or asked if we wanted to order additional drinks or wine. Took 20 min to get salads out.  Waited for food over 30 minutes. Busboy would take 1 dirty dish at a time but leave 2-3 others on table. 

Waited about 15 minutes for check when we were done with dinner, then was charged for wrong wine, got that corrected but had to wait another 10 minutes for waitress to return to pay the bill. We finally asked busboy to get the waitress just so we could pay and leave. 

Looks like Grape Street Too needs to invest more time in training their wait staff. Have always had a great dining experience at original Grape Street. Very disappointed!",YsCnCVehFoJiTsW96gABMg,2,0,5,nHvHsYTWsh8-lxh_Gk1BNA

I asked what kind of NA beer they had and was told St Pauli which I like. I was brought a brand I did not know and as the waiter was pouring it, I was told this was a substitution. I was TOLD. I was not asked. It ended up being fine but that is not my point.

The salads came out. They were all delivered to the wrong parties. There should be seat numbers assigned so that they wind up in the right place. Mine was not part of the initial delivery and since mine had not been delivered yet, it was my intent to ask for anchovies for my Caesar salad. When I asked about my salad the guy delivering the salads stated, ""I only have two hands"". Wrong answer. Very rude response. Salad showed up and the anchovies a few minutes later on the side.

The entree's came out while we were still eating our salads. Poor timing.

Then I had no utensils as they took all of them from me with the bread plate though I was not done with the bread.

Lastly, never once in an hour and a half were we asked if we wanted more beverages. I was with a guy who spent $700 on wine alone the night before. I was never offered another beer and though ONE bottle of wine was split between the table, not once were we asked if we wanted more. You lost a few hundred dollars on this visit.

Like I said, the food was great but it was as if the ""B"" or ""C"" team was on duty.

Why is your average only three stars with as long as you have been in Vegas, especially when the food is always amazing, so amazing I will be back. With that said, if poor service is bringing you down, you are losing business.

With so many restaurants in Downtown Summerlin located next to the Red Rock Casino and you look for great restaurants on the Yelp app, how many Yelpers are going to run to a three star restaurant?

The seasonings they used was so perfectly balanced that no ketchup was needed. We also ordered the baked brie. Now I had seen recipes for baked brie all over pintrest and needless to say I was excited to see if the taste lived up to the pictures. The pastry was flakey and the cheese creamy.

Then the Moscow mule was up for tasting, or should I say, my glass of lime juice?

He ordered a sangria, (which, I don't drink sangria but his was very good), and we split the tapas appetizer.

I have heard many word of mouth reviews of friends who have recently dined here and some good and some iffy reviews have been made. My friends and I decided to give it a chance.

1. Atmosphere was amazing . Beautifully decorated and very well maintained. Staff was very pleasant and the wait time was 10 minutes. As we sat down we had a server by the name of Jeremy assist us and he was nothing but overly pleasant, knowledgeable and over all happy to be apart of the new restaurant. 

2. Food: I have my go to items and the menu was the same as the location on Lake Mead so I decided to try something out side of my comfort zone and got the chopped salad and the Filet Oscar . Both absolutely amazing .  The time to get the food took a little longer then I would have wanted but It also could have been me being extremely not patient and starving.  Price was the same and overall I had an amazing time and enjoyed every bit of my experience of Grape Street and Downtown Summerlin.

At the end of the day just like any new establishment comes quirks and learning opportunities and I feel Grape Street knows what it needs to focus on and change . They will be on top in no time. Keep up the great work guys. We will be back !",5WHnULjtETQ5gsMhx7IjLw,0,0,5,ocA1Rggzf-mRsNZMc5FKUA

Located near the south end of Downtown Summerlin, this intimate wine bar delivered everything we could have expected.  Service was outstanding and the menu was diverse enough to appeal to a wide range of appetites.  

Positives
1) Service was incredible and although the dining room is small they offer some open seating high top tables and a very long U-shaped bar where you have a decent chance of seating quickly during busy times.
2) Menu was diverse and included a nice selection of appetizers, steaks, pasta dishes, pizza, sandwiches, and salads.  Would recommend the cheese plate and calamari appetizers.  Two of our party chose a bacon/jalape√±o wrapped scallops special that was exceptional.  
3) Ambience is great, small intimate setting with outdoor seating available.  On a clear evening sitting outside would be great.

Negatives
1) For a place that has ""Wine Bar"" in the title the wine list was a tad underwhelming.  Although we found a couple great wines in ""The Prisoner"" and ""Stag's Leap Artemis"", the mid priced bottles were minimal.  I don't know if they offer a corkage fee option but the pricing on their wine list were a tad high.  A corkage fee, if offered would be nice!
2) Dining room is small and the wait can be long during busy periods.  They do take reservations apparently so I would suggest making one if you are planning on visiting.
3) Based on location, parking can be quite a walk from the restaurant.  Try to find parking at the south end of the shopping center near Dillard's as the movie theatre and Dave & Busters are adjacent to this restaurant and parking is limited.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,1,0,5,nrVtfvVRENe2e5dhq0qeFA

Today we ate at their new location in Downtown Summerlin for the second - and last - time. We were ""greeted"" by the hostess who only asked if we were a party of two. She walked to a table, tossed the menus down and walked away. Not a good start. We had water and bread if short order, but did not see our waiter for five minutes. We decided to order wine and our food at the same time so we didn't have to wait another five minutes for him to return. We ordered the Orange Chicken salad and wine. The wine showed up in about four minutes but the salad did not make it out for another 11 minutes. We attempted to eat the bread, but we needed a hacksaw to cut it into pieces, so we were only able to tear off small pieces. When the salad arrived it looked okay, but some of the ingredients were missing - specifically the peanuts. Maybe we looked like we had a peanut allergy. There were four slices of canned Mandarin orange on the rim of the bowl and a generous handful of fried wonton strips piled in the center. I counted three thin strips of red pepper and four slices of chicken. Speaking of the chicken, I thought perhaps it might be free range, but it ended up being taste free. It appeared to be grilled but there was almost no taste - but it was warm (I'm guessing from the microwave.) From the time our meal arrived until we had been sitting in front of empty plates for at least five minutes, not a single person approached our table. We were never asked if the food was good of if we wanted anything else. A manager looking person cleared our table and then we waited another five minutes before our waiter returned - the first time since taking our order - with the check. I should add that during this time there were only 11 customers in the restaurant. They were not slammed by any stretch of the imagination.

When Grape Street was born, it was fantastic. The new location is great but they forgot to bring along the great food and service.

I gave this two stars because during the few times that we had any interaction with the staff, with the exception of the hostess, they were friendly. In our book, two strikes and you are out. We are definitely out.",HCoQ5kaby89gTWrdr1du4Q,0,0,2,F-0q2gLNAkp6_Ci_tOLukg

They are going through the motions, but maybe just not that into it.  Our service was fine, but the bread they brought out was burnt on one side and hard.  Not a big deal, but it is the small stuff.  We ordered a couple sandwiches.  One was filled with meat and the other had about 1/2 as much and fewer toppings and the bread was a bit dried out.  Again, not a bid deal.  The iced tea was pre-sweetened, but that is a personal preference.  The trash can in the rest room was overflowing.  This is the kinda stuff the manager should be catching and directing changes.  The ingredients were all good though.

Grape Street Caf√© is strategically located, pretty close to popular department stores. This is why it sometimes seem ""busy"". The truth is that with the first step (rude and unprofessional hostess) there is good reason to pass this place up. With so many restaurants I suggest walking a little further and realize all the choices you have in this outside mall. I've eaten here before and as hard as the owner works cooking; the food is just adequate. Too bad he doesn't hang up his chefs hat and become more aware of what's going on up front. I could not believe the hostess was so rude and demanding about where I had to sit. She squeezed me between two occupied tables very close to each other & to the kitchen. Really? when the entire restaurant was empty except for outside? Of course everyone wanted to sit outside, but we were told we could not. When I asked for the Manager, (who seemed to be bored with my experience with the hostess) he offered to sit me where the hostess could have effortlessly sat us in the first place.

I've had this spot bookmarked for awhile and we were in the area so we stopped in for a Saturday night dinner. We loved the food and service was attentive.

My husband and I both started with a glass of wine and both were delicious. I was surprised to find that the wines by the glass were reasonably priced. Nothing is better with wine than meat and cheese so we ordered the Meat & Cheese Plate. What a spread! My husband is picky with cheeses and he was willing to eat three of the four cheeses. The plate also had pickles, candied nuts, crackers, crostini, jam, olives, and mustard. 

My Chicken Piccata was delicious and a little different. Instead of a chicken breast it was a bone in piece of roasted chicken. I loved the textures and tastes of everything in the dish. My House Salad to start was simple, but good. I liked that it had blue cheese. My husband ordered Baked Penne and enjoyed it.

4424503,2015-01-25,10,kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg,"Below is what happens when I write a review while I'm hangry after waiting close to two hours to be seated for my early birthday dinner.
I've been here twice, with a great first experience meeting friends for dinner and being showered with attention. The second time was a letdown from our first kiss experience, if only the hostess didn't have an attitude and would have let us known sooner so we could go somewhere else to have dinner...like the nearby Crave.
I would like to say that despite the excessive wait ""due to a mishap in the kitchen"" (which I saw was an excuse cited on another review), the service once seated was again excellent. Our server made sure he took our order promptly and the lady manager took care of a round of drinks for us. This was much later in the night when the dust settled and the short staffed restaurant could actually keep up.
The food as my daughter called it is ""acceptable, but not exceptional"".
Clams & Linguini - dry, very dry. Thankfully our wonderful server brought out a large ""spoonful"" more of broth. Downtown Summerlin may be experiencing a broth shortage & conserving.
Oscar Filet - Cooked medium well perfect, albeit underseasoned. The crab meat in bernaise was delicious and got us curious about trying this at Oscars next time.
Chicken Marsala - a very good dish that is similar to the one I make. Thin sliced velveted chicken with a very light translucent marsala sauce, served with mashed potatoes topped with fried leeks (fancy onion straws).
The wine wall is pretty, but we didn't understand how climbing up the wall to get bottles was safe or sanitary...shoes that have been walking through kitchen, bathrooms and now leaving all that behind for the next person to grab and bring to your table....hmm. I can't wait to see who will own or close down this restaurant when a wine bottle or staff member falls on top of them.


Hangry Review:
DO NOT BOTHER COMING HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE LIED TO ABOUT WAIT TIMES. 
Decided to write a review after our 2nd experience here. First off, you can't make a reservation unless it's for a party of 8 or more. We got here at 7:30 and told there would be an hour wait. Ok fine, this is Downtown Snoberlin so we decided to wait. We check in again after 50 minutes and told to wait another 30-45 minutes.  If it weren't for the fact we've already wasted over an hour waiting for this hyped up location, we would have left. I'm writing this review while sitting in the waiting area and getting more irritated by the minute as I see parties of 2 seated at tables for 4. The girls running the front desk are clueless and the manager non-existent.
I honestly will never return to this location again. As far as the food goes, it was ok... anything halfway decent in Summerlin will draw this sheltered crowd.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,9,6,2,4TtuXTep7wnDS8WtKVFcfQ

Upon walking up to the bar the bar staff asked us if we were dining in the dining room. We explained that we were there to meet friends and wished to stay in the bar area. Immediately the bar staff began eye rolling and had no problem making us feel uncomfortable. Our friends arrived, we asked the bartender for happy hour drink specials and he literally laughed at us and said ""we don't have happy hour here and neither does anywhere in DT Summerlin. We are soooo busy we don't need a happy hour menu."" Clearly not impressed with his attitude. Proceed to order apps and drinks. Food was great as always but it became so crowded inside that I understood why the bar staff didn't want us to stay in the bar. My check was incorrect 3 times- we were charged for the person next to us and asked for it to be corrected. That took another 20 minutes and came with a lot of attitude. Overall vibe of patrons inside was frustration so maybe they just need to work out the kinks but we prefer the old location for now.",pq2yAgrQfvCMZFPxRV6eCg,1,0,2,SlczYN0p0G1ZvyUw1rDkOg
4451520,2015-04-03,0,kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg,"Womp womp womp. Out of all the places to eat in Downtown Summerlin and this place was chosen (not by me!).

We arrived during a busy lunch, which may have attributed to the slow service. Luckily our server was overly nice to us about the wait time. Funny thing is, I called in and specifically mentioned I was having a business lunch and wanted to be assured a table, but they would not take my reservation because it was not 6+ people. The hostess assured me we would be able to get a table, when I arrived it was packed and I had heart palpitations foreseeing my misery in front of my clients when I wouldn't be able to acquire a table! 

We still ended up with a table outside on the patio, thankfully.

Little black bugs flew around us the whole time we ate. Swiping at bugs and trying to enjoy a business lunch is horrible. I think they may live in the green bushes that surround the patio. 

I ordered the Blackended Salmon Salad. Came out with some decent lettuce, some lettuce had brown spots, and some lettuce was wilted - and the dressing was HEAVY. Also, this salad was kind of boring - it just LOOKED bland. There was no garnishes, and very few croutons. The salmon was the saving grace - it was blackened nicely, with some tasty spices, but not over-powering. Plus, the salmon was quite large - no skimping on size.

I think they are still working out their kinks, but with so many other options to eat at in DS, I don't think I will return here. Perhaps their original location on Lake Mead is better?",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,0,2,1sMQHaT8n2tk1KUmweIiJw
4484503,2017-04-25,1,kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg,"It was a last-minute Happy Hour for Ladies' Night Out.  I usually choose our venue for these gatherings, but this time I didn't.  I never would have picked a place with a HH that ends at 6 pm but, oh well.  I think it was chosen because there is music in the patio on Monday nights, and the phenomenally-talented sax player providing the entertainment is well-known by the woman who set it up.

I'd been to the former location on Lake Mead a number of times, but it was a first visit to this latest incarnation.  We were seated inside, in the bar area, but it was completely open to the patio.  My group called the event to start at 5:30 - reckless, IMO, because by the time the waiter made his way to our table, HH was almost up.  To his credit, he said it wouldn't be a problem to extend it, since the majority of our group hadn't arrived.

The room is impressive, with its massive wine wall and upscale decor, though little me could have used a booster seat for the low chair.  While the music was wonderful, it was loud, making it impossible to hold a conversation with all but the person sitting next to us.  And the fact that 10 of us were seated at a long table, mingling wasn't possible, defeating the purpose of our get-together.

Most of us ordered from the HH menu, and 7 is the magic number.  Wines are all $7, and there's ample choice.  Same for well drinks.  And also for menu items.  Guess the No. 7 is lucky in Vegas :).  Not knowing what to expect, we chose two items each, and it turned out to be too much.  Most presentations were beautiful:  My baked brie was rimmed with slices of pear and green apple, and red grapes, and was spectacularly good.  The stuffed shrimp, on the other hand, was ordinary, in more ways than one:  four shrimp each had a little dollop of what was supposed to be crabmeat but seemed to be strictly breadcrumbs.  The shrimp were set on a too-large plate with no frills except for a small lemon quarter.  Plating matters! They looked lonely and tasted bland.  Those who ordered the burrata were very happy, and the different colors of the cheese, asparagus, prosciutto and other goodies made for an impressive presentation.   

Despite the earlier mostly-good waiter vibes, service was very spotty.  One woman who ordered the burrata had it served almost an hour after her meatballs had already filled her up, and our waiter was often hard to find.  

Most, but not all, of the HH items are on the main menu.  For happy hour, it's a decent deal.  After that, not so much.  I don't think I'd come back for dinner without a hefty Groupon, and as a night owl, HH ends just too early for me.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,3,3,PnkEKrmw7jD810IZvrLJjw

I ordered the Orange Chicken Chinese Salad & what I got was a ""strange"" salad bombarded with way too many crushed wontons!! It felt & resembled like I was eating a bowl of Kellogg's Corn Flakes without the milk!!! Also, there was hardly any chicken (explains the excess of crushed wontons) and the few miniature cubes of diced chicken tasted like a frozen chicken breast that was microwaved...bland & boring!! The salad also had roasted red bell peppers and some pieces were crunchy raw & other pieces were mushy as if they came straight out of a jar marinated in olive oil!! I haven't had roasted red bell peppers in a Chinese chicken salad before!! It was like they were adding it as an excuse for an ""Italian twist"" because this restaurant's food theme is ""Italian""...very bizarre!! 

My friend ordered the Black Salmon salad & it was very good!! I should of had that instead!! As for their drinks, although well made, the size glass you get is way too small for what they charge. You can get a larger size drink on the Vegas strip for the same price Grape Street charges for their drinks!!

Our server was at the back of the house the whole time and managed to show up only to fill in drinks for other tables but ours.
When he finally managed to take our orders, there was no acknowledgement of the fact that it took 45 minutes for him to take our food orders. Totally unacceptable!

4761967,2016-09-26,0,kgw8nBO9ZMRhukfnJd6bxg,"This is more of a comparison between Grape Street Cafe (downtown Summerlin) and Grape Vine Cafe (Buffalo & Lake Mead).  I have been going to Grape Vine for years (back when it used to be Grape Street).  My staple lunch is the steak salad with the meat cooked to the chef's recommendation (which is usually medium to medium-rare).  

Today I ventured out to downtown Summerlin and quickly ordered the same thing.  Let me tell you that Grape Street's version was average at best.  I'll summarize my dislikes:
1) Quality of meat was lacking.  It was a tougher steak and the seasoning lacked any flavor.
2) Too much blue cheese.  I don't mind blue cheese, however there is no need for the excessive amount that was placed on the salad.  
3) The quantity of meat was much less than the place on Buffalo & Lake Mead.
4) The bread was hard.  The crust of the bread was very crunchy... not as soft & fresh as it normally is.  
5) The meat was overcooked (unless the chef recommends that the steak be cooked well-done - which seems odd).  

In summary, if I'm heading to lunch and these are my two options, I would recommend you go to the original with a different name.  Grape Vine Cafe is much tastier than the fancier brother.",x5IIYwldxRIUUORNEEy87Q,1,0,2,dzXYMuoc3774gmfily5rxg

 Never in my wildest dreams would I think a place that's this busy fall so hard at anything they sent out. 

 Met friends for dinner and they chose dinner here. Busy vibe and great ambience to the place to start off the night right. We ordered some wine and cocktails which came out in the fashion that molasses does when making bbq sauce. When the waiter (who was awesome and personal) came by to bring the first round we just put the second order in for our drinks. 

 Food order was taken which I ordered mussels with red sauce and a caprese salad. I felt I was being punked when they brought over the food for the table. The food was so uninspired by the culinary team. 

New Zealand Mussels arrived on a plate shell down with the mussel topped with sauce and some cheap shredded parm melted on top. Frozen precooked recooked mussels are not appetizing not should be allowed for human consumption, you're a restaurant in summerlin that should be ordering fresh shellfish 

Caprese salad was 3 pieces of beefsteak tomatoes torn basil, and mozzarella cheese. No salt, cheap balsamic and what tasted like blended cooking oil. The disconnect on this dish is astonishing and needs to be revisited.

 Heard lots about this place and wanted to like it but I have left less than pleased in the food.",iRuVZPnyeBpPeLBNZNFtjg,2,3,2,2nQQ2eIlv56uPEcFGDJNVQ

I have been twice so far. The first time our server was good enough and the food was tasty, but the service as a whole was not good. Our drinks took forever, as well as our food, and the entire time the OWNER was sitting at the bar DRINKING while the customers were suffering. There were people at tables looking around wondering where their drinks and/or food were whilst servers and hostesses were sitting at the bar eating and polishing glassware. 
All in all, the experience wasn't a great one but because I was so loyal to the old location I figured it was just the new staff adjusting to an opening. 

Second visit was a completely different story. Absolutely HORRIBLE service, and it wasn't even busy! Our server took literally over ten minutes to bring out our water, and I had to ask her for lemon three times. 
Normally I am patient at restaurants bc I have been in the service industry for over ten years now, but this was one of the few times I lost my patience. My four year old was with us and I repeatedly asked for bread just to appease him because our food was taking so long. Twenty minutes later with nothing but water on our table I eventually ended up snapping at our server. We stopped by for a quick lunch at 4pm and ended up being there for over an hour, it was awful. And not to mention our appetizer came out AFTER our meals. And again, the owner was sitting at the bar drinking while the restaurant was falling apart. 

Unfortunately, even after my years of loyalty to the place, I will most likely never return to this location. I sincerely hope John, the owner, wises up and fixes these issues or the the place will never survive.",brSkLVmcFCD75QX86EWAKQ,6,0,1,BAWx-B2mV8dRx9YQ-qkp_g

The owner also doing shots and talking at the top of his voice to one of his buddies at the bar.  Very annoying.  Service at the bar slow, bartenders too busy talking to each other, and the bottle of wine I ordered they didn't have so why is it on the menu.

Here's the breakdown:

Food: Good. Same wonderful menu as their original location. I ordered the Steak Salad and it was pretty solid. I ordered my steak medium rare; however, it was still slightly undercooked. My boyfriend ordered the Goat Cheese Bowtie pasta. He thought it was okay. He noted it lacked flavor. 

Atmosphere: Beautiful! The new location has a gorgeous bar, lovely lighting, big windows, tall ceilings, and a combination of tables in the center of the restaurant and cozy leather chairs tucked away in romantic corners. 

Bar: Even though we didn't order any spirits, beer, or wine, my boyfriend (a bourbon/whiskey/scotch connoisseur) spotted that the bar had a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon. Needless to say, he was impressed. 

Prices: Just right. Not too over priced. Our meal was $30.

Service: We were served by Nick. He was great. There when we needed him and not there when we didn't.
