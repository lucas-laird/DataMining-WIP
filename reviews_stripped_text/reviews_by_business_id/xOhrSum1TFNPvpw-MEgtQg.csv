The 2 tacos for a dollar is a good deal. They are yummy. 
The jr bacon burger is also really good. 
I like the teriyaki chicken bowl. Didn't even know they had it for a long time. 
Their curly fries and potato wedges are really good. The wedges are really greasy and look kinda gross but they are good. 
Their hamburgers are meh.",HLxTwrrNrEfLNNsw2liSuA,2,0,3,1rgUXygMM8C5jtxqvf6vGA

I only got it because I had a coupon which got the sandwich free with purchase of a large drink.  It was not big enough to be worth the price.  Aside from this visit I have been here many times and I am usually happy with the service, but mostly I come here with coupons looking for a cheap alternative.  Can't beat the cheap 2 tacos for 99 cents.  I would consider giving JITB 4 stars for the breakfast alone though because it is so much better than any other fast food place.  Overall, good food, can be pricey or cheap depending on what you want, and the service is good, but don't expect too much because it is still just a fast food restaurant.",-PHC1ulwHkY4LEmMqmFwPg,0,0,3,nGlJ87xc86TY2-fAalV0MA

They have only one full booth and a half booth the rest were table and chairs. I sat down at the table and the chairs were very uncomfortable. We moved to the one booth. MUCH BETTER. 
My husband went to use the restroom and he said they did not have soap to wash hands with and its the only place to go to , so that meant the male workers weren't using soap after the bathroom. He told the manager and all she said was OH, we will look into that.
Most of the tables and the floor was dirty and this was 9:30am. My hash brown tasted like it was cooked in old oil. But, I do have to say the Blueberry oatmeal was wonderful!!",UlsZJ618qrY5W6NIcHk8pA,1,1,2,H_tp7GMlKPkMiDc_HcUVBQ

The ladies who work the drive thru are so rediculously friendly here! They ask you how you are doing and when I asked her how she was doing, she replies that she feels very blessed! Not exactly what you expect to hear at your JITB drive thru! lol I don't know why, but I just love that! Positivity is contagious, I guess!

Other than all that, its a typical JITB.  Than again, I guess that really underscores the point that good customer service makes all the difference in the world!

I do love those chicken nuggets though! They are better than BK's and Mickey D's IMHO!

4 stars.

btw...is it just me..or are those ""Hot Mess"" commercials great?? lol 

oh nm..  :P",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,2,2,4,lAIdtl7Y6C6XjsDPbOzClA

1. Very friendly staff every time I go thru the drive thru
2. Drive thru seems faster than most
3. Restaurant is cleaner than average",nwvnNIixvyYTg4JS8g3Xgg,0,0,3,GR_Yir1ZvjmIB0lwt0ekvw

When you get your receipt there is a stamp on it that entitles you to TWO FREE TACOS on your next visit after 2 PM! I also want to recognize the staff at this particular Jack In The Box, they are always very nice. The restaurant is always clean. If you are not in the mood for tablecloths and fine dining stop by, don't be such a  snob. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",DeVGAiOf2mHVUDfxvuhVlQ,0,0,5,6Dvu9Acw2agcW8D_E-eSKg

I have no qualms about stopping by the next time I'm in the area.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,4,3,PI9ci0GoN02WUGDMyroaWA
