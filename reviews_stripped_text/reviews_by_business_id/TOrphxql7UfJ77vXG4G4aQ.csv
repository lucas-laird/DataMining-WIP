Looking for platano maduro come here! This place has the BEST carne asada. I visit this place at least once a week! The price is good for the quality of the food. If you are Puerto Rican, El Salvadorian, Bolivian any of the Central American places this is the best you are going to get in LV. It's like eating at some ones home. They take there time and prepare it. The atmosphere is like being at home and eating, not very fancy but the food will make you forget.",NceN81ZMQQE4Vyj-4BBg1A,5,0,5,co4zdHlHLJcGOGzJammjQg

I don't eat meat so it was a waste of my time and money. Called and told them about my order only to have them tell me to come in and exchange them. LOL okay yeah, wait another 35 min? No thanks. I'll go to the pupusa place down the street next time.",_tXlbtyr6f8VoWOVBUzg_A,1,1,1,6DBENQ_9H12IHbqe-9jDhg

Pretty sure they don't even clean there kitchen right . Foods not the best and they take other people before you like they don't care (obviously) I rate this place a 2 star place. I would never recommend this place to anyone !",y6SlsrtbJZBDKEmlHL_g6A,0,0,2,x0ubykLA8m-YE61iXNv38w

You can tell it's family owned by the kiddos running in the back and younger staff.

The food here is always good. I was introduced by my Honduran friend. I have to say I love plantains! They fry them in slices. None of those little flat cakes here. 

I love all of their food. The prices are awesome. They take a little longer to make the food but it always comes out fresh. They also give you these chips with a tomato sauce and cheese as a free starter.

I usually get pupusas, sopes, and their Central American tamales. These aren't the typical ones steamed in corn husk. They're so good! All the above listed items are under $3 each. 

Lastly I get their plantains with fried chicken or fried pork chop. They serve it with slaw and sauce and pickled onions. It's so good!",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,3,3,4,cWNJM2k90xX2MBJc5Yab2g

5105435,2018-04-15,0,TOrphxql7UfJ77vXG4G4aQ,"This is one of the better places in East Vegas to get some great pupusas. The pupusas are of great size, taste, filling and the price is fair. 
They're salsa that comes complimentary with chips when you dine in is homemade and tastes yummy :)

On the negative side: The rumors about the wait are a hit or miss. The last time I went I had to wait 35 minutes for the food to arrive. Also, they're salsa de tomate (goes on the pupusas) is a little runny.",aVuKrNrStDlm_JPigliLeQ,0,0,4,60SupTnacvdcskmWhPyshg
5955006,2013-02-09,0,TOrphxql7UfJ77vXG4G4aQ,This place isn't noticable at all. It's a Central American restaurant in a corner of a plaza on Lake Mead and Nellis by a nail and smoke shop. I love the yucca con chicharones y especialmente las papusas de pollo. After that I usually have a modela and leave satsfied.,6UQlnFvSr5dUJuy0RA-M2Q,0,1,4,VXDMWbRDn7dSEGa2RU5R7Q
