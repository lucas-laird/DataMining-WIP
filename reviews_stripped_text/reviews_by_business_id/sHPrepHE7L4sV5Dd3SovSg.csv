I don't recommend this place to anybody. 2 stars for a good location. It'll feed your hunger, but will not even close to please you. If I had 3 hands I'd give this place 3 thumbs down.",R-qR-pFCw71bjFpr8jfi6Q,1,0,2,mGdtbOOFkvGcNebv_bRIMw
740851,2016-04-13,0,sHPrepHE7L4sV5Dd3SovSg,The pizza I got was not fresh.  Felt as if it was from day before.  Cheese was sparse and lacked and real cheese flavors.  Pizza is better from a frozen food that I get at local supermarket!  Disappointed.,xFOCws04VuKu_wgXLd5ynA,0,0,2,SG2pdeDqUEPWAJrfsRyD1g
1317864,2017-12-07,0,sHPrepHE7L4sV5Dd3SovSg,"Being a sales rep, I am in vegas at the Mandalay Bay convention center more than I would like. The food court is close and easily accessible. The lines get long but the servers are fast and efficient so you don't really have to wait long. 
Bonanno's is a go to for me. I tried the rest of the places, but the pizza in the food court is the best. It's a pretty authentic NY slice and the Stromboli is great too. 
One slice and a side salad is $10 but enough food for lunch. Two slices would be too much. 
Trade show people- give this place a shot. It's better than the other options!
Hotel guests- there are better options away from the convention center in the hotel.",iCZA5fjhaIW-4iLFN3va5w,0,0,5,ypS0blGKwK2zqus2-1GcqQ
3122412,2017-09-03,1,sHPrepHE7L4sV5Dd3SovSg,"Not bad, overpriced food court pizza, but everything is overpriced when you're in the casino anyway. The pizza was big and was edible, so I'd say it's ok. I was hungry and I enjoyed it. When you're eating casino food, you always have to lower your standard just a little bit then you won't be too upset...

At least it's a quick bite in the conference hall.",dKKvpFh7QrplB3e0EEh8Rg,4,2,3,WW7kcRIbj771L-uYpTH5DA
3798575,2016-12-07,1,sHPrepHE7L4sV5Dd3SovSg,"I'm here for a conference so this place is super busy and everyone seems overworked. Perhaps this is why the pizza isn't that great? The pizza seemed over salty, the sauce wasn't that flavorful, and the crust was a bit too tough. For a New York style pizza place, it just doesn't do it for me. They do the sbaro thing and reheat your pizza after you order, maybe they need to heat it a bit longer too. 

If you're hungry near the Mandalay Bay conference center do yourself a favor and have something else instead.",VwjalVuMTfQcmSoUhZ2vyw,1,1,2,p_Rkh-UaaC9TUl7qkAGSIA

5597306,2015-04-12,0,sHPrepHE7L4sV5Dd3SovSg,"This is evidently the Vegas version of Sbarro's, located in pretty much all of the food courts (which the hotels have evidently lifted wholesale from the malls) of the various hotels. This particular one is in Mandalay Bay, more or less by the Shark Reef thing. I have no reason to suspect any of the others are more different, though perhaps the food court area at some of the other ones is less crowded. I've never seen the one at Mandalay Bay at anything less than full capacity, ever, even across multiple visits.

Instead of a thicker slice, ala Sbarro's, what we have here is sort of an attempt at New York style pizza. We can and will throw authenticity out of the nearest window, since they're not in the right realm, unless you're measuring strictly on foldability, which the slice I had did fine with. If you want anything more than that (and you will, especially if you're from New York), you'll still be wanting after you finish wiping the grease off your hands and maybe your mouth. This is a very average pizza, but because it's in a hotel, it's also very pricey, matching that of stadiums and/or airports.",orHVoIN1Oj_rK3KDqcGBIQ,1,1,3,idZvDX_HPA57cpORWKUZAw
5696437,2015-07-13,1,sHPrepHE7L4sV5Dd3SovSg,"The (breakfast) FOOD: Typical food court offerings and quality. It's not horrible, but nothing special. A decent option for breakfast, especially since it's the only choice on this side of the resort other than Subway.

The SERVICE: The cashier was helpful and had a cheerful demeanor. The server was horrible! She displayed the stereotypical ""I don't give a ""@&%#"""" attitude. She was rude and not invested in her customers. 

I get it. It's early and you probably believe you're better than just slinging breakfast sandwiches all morning but don't lay your ""land of broken dreams"" act on your customers. I expect more at a high-end resort. 7/13/15 am",NCpuLX6OgmatwK0zGmx_0A,1,1,3,_Go6yzdUK8GJloF7wHEAXQ
5892890,2015-09-29,0,sHPrepHE7L4sV5Dd3SovSg,"I needed to hit the food court before a concert and so pizza it was!
I had a slice of the Hawaiian and a slice of the Meat Lover's Delight. The Hawaiian was good but the Meat Lover's was better as it had bacon!!! Definitely pricey at about $6 a slice, and the slices were on the larger side. 
This is standard food court stuff, so I wasn't that impressed. I wanted to order a stuffed slice, which is on the menu. I asked about it and was told they don't have any stuffed slices. 
If you want an overpriced beer, they have that too. 
The restaurant is located in the food court, which is deep in the bowels of the convention center and also near the Shark Reef. 
It's easily missed. Signage for the food court doesn't exist until you're already almost in the convention center. 
It's almost like a secret food court.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,1,1,3,SJdC5ggL1AgGeDEq7jbTfA
