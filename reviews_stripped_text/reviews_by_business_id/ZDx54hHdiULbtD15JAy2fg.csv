817480,2017-03-12,0,ZDx54hHdiULbtD15JAy2fg,Went to the container park for the first time tonight and we were looking for something to eat. I noticed on the 2nd floor a sign saying Pizza and brownies.. my 2 favorite things in the world so of course I had to try it.. and I'm so glad I did. The pizza was delicious and everyone was super awesome! I will definitely be coming back for more delicious pizza and brownies,m7dOnE_s_VG7n_cGfPpn3A,0,0,5,1izQXiJzwNZHWv-QBiWHRQ

However the service and the food I got there was so great. Everyone that was working there was friendly, i ate my pizza had a great conversation. When i left I felt like I left making a connection that doesnt happen that much anymore. 

I will be back because of the pizza but mostly I will be back because of the service. 

The parking is a little tough it is metered or lots! Also keep in mind it is inside the container park on the top level..",cqy-OvaSX5fCiL6F6_Rffw,2,2,5,5tqSrMX6OjxitFYv4erz4A
1694631,2016-01-25,5,ZDx54hHdiULbtD15JAy2fg,"Stoned-N-Baked is the latest new kid in town as Container Park continues its process of becoming a well-rounded micro community of shops and restaurants. A perfect addition to the offerings already present; in fact, Stone-N-Baked compliments another one of my favorites in the Park: Oak & Ivy. Do they deliver? Yes friend, they'll deliver that pie straight to your bar stool. 

My interaction here was brief, but I saw their ad a few days before about a soft opening on the 23rd, and being on the hunt for excellent nearby slices, in I went. The first thing you'll notice is that Stoned-N-Baked is about rapid service. Sweet, very nice, friendly young folks--but rapid. You aren't here for a dining experience, but instant nourishment. Got the munchies, need a pizza, stat?  10 minutes and satisfied you will be. 

The menu is simple, so choose and go window shop for a bit. You'll return to a delightfully thin-crust personal pie (10"" is the one size they offer). The sauce ain't plain, it's a noticeable, flavorful seasoning. I had a bunch of veggies added, along with pepperoni on one side and chicken on the other. The meats are real, baby, and delish. 

Great start to a place that will get my business every time I stop into the Park for a drink, no doubt.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,11,9,3,i3upynh-iqOFCZ8vnZd0ww

2606250,2017-11-21,0,ZDx54hHdiULbtD15JAy2fg,"Not what you think based on the clever name, however it is still a nice spot to grub. I happen to be in the area and was famished after a photo shoot so  decided to stop on by for a quick bite. The shop is small inside much like most of the business in container park. The pizza menu is very short and simple. You fill out a small card and check off what toppings you want to go on your order. Once you hand it in they get to work and you can have your pizza in about 5 mins. The pizza is a small almost personal sized one, good for about 1-2 people. The inside of the place was very clean & the kind lady who took my order was very friendly & talkative. It was nice to have a conversation as my pizza was being prepared. i even was able to use a yelp checkin to save some $ so that's always a plus.",UgMW8bLE0QMJDCkQ1Ax5Mg,1,1,4,gAap1OzUc7KuD9B_u3Y9gw
2680143,2016-07-19,1,ZDx54hHdiULbtD15JAy2fg,"Meh. Decided to give this place a try as one of the last food establishments I have conquered inside the Container Park.  I love the name but the pizza was just ok.  The crust did not have much flavor. The crust is supposed to be the foundation of a great pie which consists of great water, salt, yeast and sugar. I think this recipe needs a little tweakin. The sauce are the walls of the pizza house which should provide a solid base of flavor either sweet, spicy or tangy. This wall came crumbling down here with heavy tomato paste flavor and not much else. Another recipe that needs tweakin in my opinion. The toppings provide the roof of the pizza shelter. I only tried the cheese here so I cannot form an honest opinion on the rest of the, but the cheese was definitely a preshred bagged mozz laced with several types of anti caking agents. Not a fan but I understand that the cheese is the most expensive ingredient for a pizza operation because of the shear quantity one can use. 

Stoned and Baked uses an intersting process when making their pizzas in a high temp compact convection oven. While it can make pizzas fast, it cannot add complex flavors that can be added from wood burning ovens or gas flames.  This oven allows them to make pizzas in this very small space without the increased cost of ventilation or fire suppression systems. This concept works fine for the quick on the go crowd that needs a quick snack. I just prefer a little more refined taste in my pizza endeavors. 

I will give them another try but they might be better off just popping a DI giorno in that fancy oven.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,2,3,3,gW3hUFvwIFZmdtusTyEO7w
2855153,2016-06-09,0,ZDx54hHdiULbtD15JAy2fg,"Took a friend of mine to lunch because we were at container park. Suffice to say, I will not be coming back. I came into the restaurant around noon for lunch. Small place with only two tables inside but no big deal. Tried to order one of their custom pizzas and when I went to fill out an order slip the guy at register said there was only one order slip and my friend and I had to share. Annoying, but again no big deal. I tried to order a ham and pineapple pizza and the guy said they didn't have ham. Now I was starting to get annoyed. How do you as a pizza place not have any ham! On another note, my friend ordered a salad and they charged him $6 for a pre made salad in a box! Ridiculous! I gave this place  two stars because the pizza I got was somewhat okay. I got a mushroom pizza.",1gEzF_sgGxgIb0w-ONBtBw,0,0,2,AB91FTH5FjKEdTKGQhYcJg
2970886,2016-01-27,13,ZDx54hHdiULbtD15JAy2fg,"It's good, but it just needs a little tweaking. I would give Stoned N' Baked 3.5 stars, but I'll round up for the great customer service. 

The latest addition to Container Park is pizza, not just pizza, but also a make your own pizza pie shop. This tiny place is co-owned by the SasaSweets people, who are located just one floor down from Stoned N' Baked. 

Basically you walk-in select your toppings, sauce, and cheeses via an order slip, pay and leave. I went with the, ""Whatever You Want"" option for ten dollars and made a BBQ Chicken pizza, with jalapenos, tomatoes, basil, and bacon. It was good, well of course it was because I chose all of the toppings, but the ingredients tasted very fresh and the sweet barbecue was the perfect balance to the spicy jalapenos. 

The crust was crunchy which I love, but it was a tad on the thin side, which allowed my toppings to slide away on a few bites. I think SnB could do with sturdier dough for their pies. 

All the pizzas are personal pizzas and will get you about 6 slices per pie, which is perfect for sharing. Plus Stoned N' Baked will also deliver your pie to anywhere in Container Park and soon they will be delivering to the surrounding Downtown area. 

When I came here they were still putting the finishing touches on the place, and didn't have the salads, breadsticks, and were missing a few ""baked"" desserts. This is a great option for Yelpers with kids who frequent Container Park on the weekends, time to get those pizza's delivered directly to the slide or the building blocks in the grassy play area.

3283739,2017-01-30,1,ZDx54hHdiULbtD15JAy2fg,"I can't tell if this place is new or old I assume newer due to the lack of reviews. I saw a fellow elitist review this place and with a name like this you know I HAD to try it.
Located in container park on the second floor. This place is rather small and not easy to spot at first. Another reason it's not easy to spot is because the name of the restaurant is on the door. When the door is open you can't see it. You can see pizza and brownies but that isn't the name of the store and that could be ANY pizza place. Maybe a sign on the first level pointing guests up to your place?!
My partner and I checked it out. Two guys working were nice. Sweet, nothing over the top. They explained how everything works. $7.00 to start and 1.00 for every additional meat or topping. I got white sauce with chicken, black olives and pineapple. Love pineapple and the juiciness on a pizza. It's perfection. 
The pizzas are more personal size ish. I coulda polished it off myself figured a pie would be good to split but not the case. It's maybe 10 inches the pie. Again good personal size. Not a $10 pizza to split between two people.
Place was clean, no restroom I didn't see. Too small to have one. Maybe one or two tables to dine at. The food prep area and cooking area is right next to the 3 compartment sink, a little clustered back there for employees and guests to see in the wide open.
This place had good pizza and good service. I wouldn't run here for a personal pizza but if you are in the park I would try it out. AGAIN ITS PERSONAL SIZE!",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,4,4,4,tq60WdFtdqZl9bD0DzyH_Q
3289794,2016-12-31,8,ZDx54hHdiULbtD15JAy2fg,"Tiny place on the 2nd floor of the Container Park. Quite a few people walked in and ended up waking out because the wait to order was too long. Glad we waited. 

Pizza is thin crust made to order. Choose from a handful of toppings and it's done in 10 minutes. Little Caesar's quality/tasting pizza that's good enough for a fast bite. 

Folks were super friendly and threw in extra pepperoni too. Definitely stop by. Aside from the hot dog place, this is a better fast food option at the Park.",rl64kysIAlSg7zwCvGzjzw,12,10,3,BPBhyp_TSD2owV0elFWZcQ

This past weekend was my 3rd attempt at making a purchase at this restaurant.  On the first 2 trips they were closed, even though their published business hours stated they should be open.  On the 3rd trip I wanted to get some brownies for dessert after purchasing tacos from another restaurant within Container Park.  Unfortunately at 7:06pm they were completely sold out.  We were told they make one batch per day and when they're gone, they're gone.

I favor the white sauce over the red, but they both make a good base. The toppings are tasty, and I've ordered a wide variety.

The first day there was a note on the door ""be back soon"" and we waited 15 minutes and no one showed so I convinced two hungry kids, we should go somewhere else. Same thing tonight around 8pm (waited 30 minutes) super annoying especially when you see the employee sitting there enjoying their pizza (ironic right?) I have nothing against the employee taking their break but poor management and planning to accommodate customer ""demand"" and needs during ""peak"" hours around typical meal times.
