The prices are reasonable and I honestly have no complaints. I read the reviews before ordering but a friend had actually tried it and loved it so I decided to take my chances! After the first bite I was in love. I couldn't believe this place was near my house and I hadn't tried it yet. I will for sure be ordering here on the regular. I kept it simple just to be safe and ordered pepperoni pizza. The flavor of the sauce was perfect and the cheese was just right. It is a thin pizza and the crust was perfect to me. Delivery time didn't take long at all. I've tried so many pizza places in Vegas and I have my favorites and this will go on the list as one of them.

1221742,2018-03-26,1,CgCujnZFGzsMPDVo4VNCLA,"This was my second visit to this location. My first visit was OK. There's a Pieology not far from here so it was a decent comparison.  Overall I thought it was similar in quality and product. However today was a serious let down. The employees at this location just don't care.  Very disappointed.  Today I watched an employee spend 10 minutes cutting all the crust off my pizza because it was burned so badly while I watched.  I was stunned. When I commented that the pizza was burnt she commented, ""no it's not"" as she continued cutting the black charcoal crust off my pizza with the pizza cutter, which by the way, did not work very well. She then lifted the pizza to show me the charred bottom and said, ""If you want me to remake it, it will come out the same way, that's just the way it is.""  

OK, mistakes happen right?

She should have noticed I was not happy and instead of continuing to cut the crust off my pizza she SHOULD HAVE STOPPED and said, ""I'm sorry, you're right it's burnt, let me make you a new one.""  BUT SHE DIDN'T.

I would have been fine to wait, mistakes happen, but to act like it's normal to spend 10 minutes cutting the crust off a burnt pizza when you could have remade it faster was inexcusable.

Its set up like subway or chipotle where they prepare it in front of you. If you have allergies they will change their gloves to prepare your food. The only issue i have is that they dip their hands into meat, dairy and veggies, creating a cross contamination and they cut all the pizzas with the same cutters so ive had a stomach ache a few times most likely due to this. The staff is usually really friendly. You can order online and you can sign up for their rewards program too. The food is super cheap! $8-10 for a pizza. I can usually eat one by myself but ive been to other places where a gluten free pizza with vegan cheese (same size) was $25 and didnt taste even close to this good!

I had the White Top, and my wife had a standard pepperoni.

The White Top was really good! I would definitely order again. The sauce was good, and the toppings were good. I really liked the texture and doneness of the crust. I typically order my pizzas well done to get a bit more crispiness on the crust, but that wasn't necessary with these pizzas. The crust is also right between what a chain pizza place would consider thin and ""regular"" or ""hand tossed"". I really liked the crust all around.

My wife had a similar opinion of her pizza. The toppings were good, the standard pizza sauce was good, the crust was good. 

The one problem we both had was that there isn't enough cheese. I like extra cheese typically, but my wife absolutely does not. Even for her, when she just prefers regular amounts of cheese, there was not nearly enough cheese on these pizzas.

I will absolutely be back to this place. It was clear that they had just opened and were training their staff (either they were training, or they were hugely over-staffed), and even though they were training the staff was great and I had no issues.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,1,0,4,BgSLYw-hjfIVjDST7F2BWA

They're located in the same plaza as Sprouts, so after double ad Wednesdays I'm too drained to actually cook the groceries I just bought so I often pop in here. I'm only half kidding.

You can get a plain cheese pizza, one topping, 2 toppings, or DIY (~$8) with everything you want. Multiple crust options and GF/vegan available, along with side salads and desserts. The original crust here is comparable to the regular one at Pizza Rev, but the toppings are applied a bit lighter here. I do like how they have add-ons like arugula or various drizzles (pesto, buffalo, ranch) after your pie gets out of the oven. Portion is more than enough for one meal and service along the line is friendly, shout out to Sukari!

The pizza reminds me of another well known pick your ingredients at the counter chain but with much better tasting ingredients.

Dropped by for lunch for a mommy/toddler date as mommy had PTO and the LO had no preschool. 

We ordered the Linked in which is sausage, red pepper, caramelized onions. I added some fresh basil on top. I also ordered a side of quinoa, butternut squash and mixed greens salad.

The pizza dough had a nice texture and crispiness to the crust. We love Grimaldi's too but the crust is a little too chewy for the kiddo to eat. At Blaze, the thinner pizza crust has only a very mild chew which makes it easy for little mouths to eat and little hands to hold.

Just as a side note, I wouldn't overload the pizza with too many ingredients, otherwise the pizza gets soggy.

Flavorwise, the ingredients and sauce profile are pretty tasty. The sauce takes a minimalist approach which I really love.

The salad was quite nice too. I really liked the combination of quinoa and butternut squash. The kiddo grabbed my salad and dug in. She loved it.

Servicewise, the cashier was such a nice guy. He helped me get the high chair to the table and cleaned everything up for us.

Toppings were still a bit cold and cheese should have been more melted. I would ask them to have your pizza well done. There is one single biggest reason as to why I won't return - the music is way too loud. I literally could not hear my husband and my five-year-old in a conversation. There were only two other parties in there while we were there. I asked a worker if he was able to turn down the music or if it was a directive from corporate (chipotle does the same thing). He was incredibly friendly and stated that corporate sets the volume but he could ask his manager. I told him not to worry about it. But I will not return because it's uncomfortably loud in there and I am an avid concert goer so I'm used to loud!

So lets really talk... Signiture pizza...   Meaning what we do best... A tried and true recipe that they want to be known for.  I can't wait... I love trying new things... I choose a pizza from the name and description... Ready to go... Nope!

Now come questions..
Do you want cheese? Does it come with cheese?  It reads cheese in the description... Oh yea, just some people want other things.

Would you like salt?
dude is that how you make the signature pizza?
well sometimes people want different stuff...
Dude just make it how its made... Nothing more nothing less

(end if the line now) 
So do you want anything else on it?
oh man... Does anything else come on it?

you get where this is going.

So its ALL upsell... Only good to build your own... And the crust is like a saltine cracker... 

I was really hoping for something like 800 degrees but closer... Their white pizza is one of the best ever pizzas I've tried... Also their signature... Except without the upsell questions... Also better dough and fresh mozzarella... Not grated market stuff.

With so much competition in the area and in vegas... Skip it... 

I hope it closes so that nobody else gets fooled into thinking its good, just because its close.

There was no feta cheese and the lemon dressing made the salad unable to be eaten. After receiving your pizza there are toppings you can add on for free. Like a drizzle of olive oil or arugula. That was nice but would have liked to know that is an option up front. Also, they didn't offer it you have to ask. I had pepperoni and my spouse had Italian meatball as toppings. I had 6 pieces of pepperoni on the entire pizza. There was also very minimal meatballs on the second pizza. I like a thin and crispy pizza. The pizza was thin enough but it is still doughy. It was brown on  the bottom and the edges were brown/black but the pizza itself was still doughy. If you want a quick pizza with a sparing amount of toppings fast then this is your place.

This was my first time at a build your own pizza place.  Instead of putting together my own, I opted for one of their signature pizzas--the meat lovers pizza.  I asked about thick pizza and I was told that for an extra charge I'd get extra dough.  I don't know what the extra was because I didn't receive a receipt.

I took my glass and got some iced tea.  Real sugar was the only sweetener available.  I asked about artificial sweeteners and the worker said, ""You mean sugar.""  I explained what I wanted.  His response was they only have sugar.

I sat down with my iced tea and waited for my name to be called.  When it was, my order was in a takeout box even though I said I was eating in.  That didn't matter so much but the crust did.  When I went to pick up my first slice, the crust came apart as the thicker pizza is just another thin layer of crust placed on top of the first one.  You have to wait for the pizza to cool down some before the two layers adhere better.

There was no salt or pepper on the tables and there were no packets at the fountain area.  I saw another table had a jar of grated cheese and a jar of seasonings.  I didn't know until the couple left where these came from until the worker cleaned the table and took them to a counter near the blazing area.  So if you don't know where things are because you've never been to a Blaze before, you don't know what they have.  I can't see the reason for removing this from the table.

The pizza was OK.  The whole experience was not.  There are too many places to get pizza in this area.  Now I've been there and done that but no more Blaze for me.

He did not care in the least.  I had to ask another much friendlier fellow if they were going to serve that to us.  He looked at the charred mass and offered to make us a new one.  As we waited for the redo,  our other pizzas got cold (no heat lamps) and the salad they put on top of our boxes got hot.  

When we finally got home with our three pizzas, two were stone cold, burned around the edges, and tough and chewy. The one they remade was okay but the toppings were very sparse. Judging from the dark soot on the bottom of each pie their oven needed a good cleaning as well. You could taste the carbon residue.  Pepperonis were too spicy for my kids to eat so we finally settled on the wilted salad.  Not bad and not burned.

I visited this location on a Thursday afternoon and they were pretty busy. This was my first time at this location but not at a Blaze.

This Blaze is located in a shopping plaza by Canes and In N Out. There is plenty of open parking so no need to worry about parking.

There is both an indoor and outdoor eating area, so if the weather is nice you can eat wherever. On my visit it was pretty busy. I would say that there were about 8 people in front of me but it took no time. 

Order:
I order the meat eater with italian sausage instead of meatballs and mushrooms instead of red onions. I also ordered a yummy chocolate chip cookie. 

They offer beer, soda, and water so if you want to sit down and enjoy your delicious customized pizza then you can.

The pizza came out great! I've been back a few times now and every pizza is been delicious.  This is a spacious restaraunt with a cute patio attached.",9UfZhqfDptllFTKgHAhMYQ,0,1,5,Yt1HnHV2KaTJ7yJbuycU_g

The building seems so small but you walk in there and they could host the entire neighborhood, impressive. Cool place overall, everything was cooked fine through and through. Took one star off just because the staff was really clumsy and didn't listen, we had to repeat everything two or three times and it wasn't even loud in there. I'm fine with it though, after all, it is still a new place and they just don't have their people down yet, but it did triple the order time and we were sorta in a rush. 

Cute take out boxes? Smart to make your boxes just in halves instead of offering styrofoam, good marketing since people see your labels again and much better for the environment :)",GJ80erkFPvOPoA1LnpRouQ,0,0,4,e4A9TDasWSx26XYn7ZjS9w

So much better than any other byo pizza places.. they also do NOT skimp on any toppings. Yumyumyum. There aren't that many good pizza places in Summerlin.

A heavier set hispanic woman in her late 20s early 30s that worked behind the counter not only glared at me while i tried smiling at her but watched over my entire order while smirking. She wasn't the one making my pizza but she felt the need to make me feel uncomfortable and honestly angry.

5367166,2018-06-13,1,CgCujnZFGzsMPDVo4VNCLA,"I love Blaze Pizza so much-- I love going here so I can get my own gluten free vegan cheese pizza. I also love that they have vegan chicken that I can add for a meat. It would be awesome if they would get vegan sausage or pepperoni one day. They have really fresh toppings, pretty much anything you can think of. 

It only takes a few minutes to cook the pizza. They also have alcohol here and my favorite Passion Fruit Fresca (Seriously Yummy).

The only thing I did not like here is the salads. Tried one the first time and it was pretty bad. Every other time I have gone in, the salads look horrible ( I mean I am talking brown in color). Maybe it's just too hot for the salads right there by the ovens. 

Also use the app to earn free pizza. But make sure you check it before you leave, the internet is really bad in the building for some reason and the app doesn't work all of the time.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,5,3,5,eLRTUMppFHyK_STvXQy7sA

Then I moved to Las Vegas and had to say goodbye. As soon as I moved here, low and behold, Blaze is opening in Summerlin!!!  Happy, happy, joy, joy!  Finally got to get my pizza. I love the build your own option. I get a ton of veggies on my pizza and it is delicious. 
The restaurant is is bright and modern but the brightest star are the employees who work there. Friendly and conscientious making sure we were enjoying our meal. We definitely were. Give Blaze a try and build you favorite pizza. We can't wait to go back

They have fresh juices as an option for beverages. The pizzas are made fresh, similar to an assembly line style where you pick all your own toppings and they fire it for you at the end of the line. Hunny selected meat lovers with peppers. It is a good tasting pizza; the thin crust is surprisingly delicious (not normally thin crust minus New York style of course), so I was pleasantly surprised! Our only negative is that there wasn't even close to enough cheese! As you can see (or not) in the picture, it isn't even noticeable. Next time we know to ask for more.

5556372,2017-11-21,0,CgCujnZFGzsMPDVo4VNCLA,"Move over Pieology - this location just opened and it's already my favorite build your own pizza joint in Summerlin!

The pizzas start at $8.95 and if you're not too hungry, can be big enough to share between two people. Service is fast and friendly, even when it's packed! They also have salads, desserts, beer & wine to enjoy with your meal. 

Aside from vegan cheese (Daiya brand) I do wish they had more vegan friendly options such as meats to add on the pizza or even other sauces aside from the marinara. But since they don't, we usually like the pack on veggies upon veggies on ours which still makes it just as good! 

I also love their Agua Frescas station that includes Blood Orange Lemonade, regular lemonade, Berry, and Matcha (which is our absolute fave and a must try!). 

They also have a dog friendly patio outside so bring your pups alongside you while you enjoy your pizza!",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,2,1,4,XtxajuxnlVwwUNag-2RCrw

The ingredients all taste very fresh, and considering you are the one making the pizza, you know it will taste good! The thing I liked about Blaze compared to other build your own pizza joints is they don't skimp on toppings. Other places I have to ask for a little more every time, but here they get it just right. The snore dessert needed to be warmed up just a bit to melt the chocolate, but otherwise was pretty close to a campfire smore. The only thing I would avoid here is the pesto sauce as it was a little too oily.  This will probably be my new go to pizza joint.",O-nFhs8UBvWaCkgkOTynDw,3,1,5,Ww9vjKblKfaq_ANAJjF79w

We come in and the girl who's first helping us was not friendly. So she takes our orders and then another lady helps us, then she passes it on to a guy who does toppings and then the second lady comes back. All in the mean time they just seem so unorganized and keep going from person to person. Ok about five minutes or so after all of the unnecessary confusion the pizza finally goes in the oven, which was the fastest part. I really like how they give you a to go box as your plate, it's a neat concept. They need to really re train their employees or something because it is their service I'm giving 2 stars and then the pizza was ok so I have another.
