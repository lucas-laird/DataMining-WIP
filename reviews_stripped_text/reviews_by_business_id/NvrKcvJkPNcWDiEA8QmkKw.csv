The sweet and sour could be a little thicker, and the vegetables in the chicken fried rice could be a little less. But always enjoyable.",av55GZpDNd2YAQSEBTuaPw,0,0,4,WmnAfYdqHogmrZyhC5455A

2092351,2018-04-12,0,NvrKcvJkPNcWDiEA8QmkKw,Not the same as the other locations. Recipes are different. Was a regular at another location then moved. Honestly cannot get the same pot stickers or won ton soup. What is the point of having the same name if the recipes are different.,Sit86IZquugnpOpAg5fJhA,0,0,2,W87s5ev_477o1SWuiH3vZA

3527365,2018-05-06,0,NvrKcvJkPNcWDiEA8QmkKw,"I went to China A GoGo around dinner time on a Thursday night and the place was pretty empty. They serve chips with sweet and sour sauce to start and one of the employees have us doughnuts on the house before our food was even ready.

I had the salt and pepper shrimp personal dinner, which was so much food for under $10. It comes with a soup, egg roll, crab Rangoon, half an order of shrimp and either white or fried rice. The serving was enough for two people. The shrimp was excellent, it was spicy and crispy. My party also got chow Kevin, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, and beef. All of our food exceeded expectations. For four people, our bill was around $50.

It is great to have such a nice place in that area with not a lot of food options up North! I will definitely be back again soon.",fxCSEbd6AiOyqOS7FP2Qyg,0,1,5,wOubBlaPsGF7A-nb3jyWOw
3586143,2018-05-08,0,NvrKcvJkPNcWDiEA8QmkKw,Went in after placing an online order and they hadn't received it yet.  The young man was very nice about it and basically put my order on right away.  Didn't even have to wait 10 minutes.  The food was excellent and so flavorful!!  It will definitely be our new go-to Chinese take-out place.,CdplRGKcTYkUwJfi7T0BcA,1,0,5,J0hnX4_-JvXojn91PlYfbQ
3770040,2018-05-27,0,NvrKcvJkPNcWDiEA8QmkKw,Best Chinese I have had in a long time!! Highly recommend. String bean chicken was perfect. The all white meat melts in your mouth and the black pepper chicken is the best I've had ever! And the delivery guy was very polite. Beats Panda Express any day!

Great customer service. Lots of food for the price: we ordered Family Dinner B and had enough for two other meals (and we're big eaters). The kung pao combo was a big hit, in particular. Plus, they gave us donuts on the house! Highly recommend. Will be returning. Thank you!",SAwl4whjs-7XecO9BYc8vA,0,0,5,o4vzlUDQ5XlzwrlKzLbS_w
4663357,2018-06-18,0,NvrKcvJkPNcWDiEA8QmkKw,"This has got to be the worst Chinese restaurant experience I've had to date in Las Vegas the entire time I've been living here (9 years) ...

 I ordered the orange chicken which firstly, I don't freaking understand why they lazily separate the sauce from the cooked breaded chicken. Not only do they separate the sauce, they give you such a small portion. This means taste wise the chicken is not covered in enough sauce. The breading chicken have no absolute taste. 100 percent bland !! No spices and no salt ! Zero salt, it tasted terrible! 

The second thing I ordered was salt and pepper fried shrimp ... now I'm of Asian decent and have always ordered a plethora of Asian/Chinese dishes my whole life... and I was so disappointed that there was absolutely no SALT on the shrimp, not to mention the quality of the shrimp was poor. It tasted very old and very very fishy, tell tale sign of old seafood. But honestly how can you advertise this dish with ""salt"" in the actual name and there isn't any at all?? 

The pork fried rice actually also had no SALT?? Everything was the most blandest no flavor food I've ever had in my entire life. Worst Chinese restaurant in Vegas. 

I don't understand how Chinese people that grew up eating Chinese home cooked food could serve this kind of quality food they did not grow up on themselves?!

If you eat here be prepared to load your food with soy sauce and siracha to make it edible at most.",7rDSdTpgSmNOrjornq3jnA,2,0,1,ypvjpF6bwBbqhmZU-ZbF7g

I was hopeful of a unique experience and a amazing brew dishes. But it's the same like the other Chinese restaurant that we have in centennial hills. 
They do give you big portion. Now, I don't know if they did that cause they just opened , but I'll try them more often since there Around the corner from my house.
