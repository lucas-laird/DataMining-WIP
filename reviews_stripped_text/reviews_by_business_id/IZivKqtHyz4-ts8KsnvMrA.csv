105522,2014-08-26,2,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"The drinks are amazing here.  The tea is brewed to perfection and the boba is made fresh.  The boba has just enough chewiness that it complements the tea, sugar, and creme in the drink.  The white gourd green tea and the black tea are one of my favorite drinks there. The black tea is very different from any other tea that I have had in LA.  It doesn't have any bitterness but a floral taste that goes very well with the herbal grass jelly.  While the white gourd green tea adds  an extra sweetness besides the sugar.  I wish they had a Kung Fu Tea in LA.  

The atmosphere is also very inviting.  The decorations are fun with the Bruce Lee figures and Kung Fu clips from various movies and TV shows playing in the background makes it very enjoyable.  The artwork on the walls are fun to look it.   If you get a chance take a look at them with the 3D glasses in the back.  

The staff are very friendly and the service is wonderful.  I would definitely go back whenever I'm in Vegas. I now know where to get my caffeine before my long drive to LA.",-SsNDiGxlXUsAup0Ymd7EQ,3,2,5,HPVxfA3dpgIyTQUyZKRAgQ

114111,2014-08-17,0,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"My BFF and I are in town for 3 days, and we needed a bubble tea fix so we went to Kung Fu Tea.  We stopped by around 11PM and got our fix.  The bubble tea is decent; my best friend would say very good.  I'd give the tea a 4, but that's not why I'm writing this review.

Kung Fu Tea has the BEST customer service.

After our 11PM run last night, we came back today (twice) because my BFF is in love with their matcha red bean slush.  They were friendly and prompt just like last night.  However, a customer who had ordered before us received her drink and immediately started throwing a fit about how the drink wasn't right.  Every time I've bought a drink at Kung Fu Tea, I've been told that if it isn't right, they'll adjust it.  It was less than a minute between when the customer started fussing that the manager (owner?) stepped in and said that it wasn't a problem he would remake what she wanted.  The employee who had made the drink was having a difficult time understanding what drink she wanted instead as he had made the drink he was instructed to.  The customer started ranting about how he should instruct his employees to get it right the first time.  (Seriously?  It's a $4 drink.  Not surgery.  You don't have to be rude to get customer service.)  So the manager remade the drink, and the customer still wasn't happy because she didn't like it even though that was the drink she had asked and paid for.  The manager saw the customer wasn't happy, and he was still very patient and asked what it was she didn't like abut the drink so he could remake it again for her.  This last time was the charm.  She walked out with a completely different drink than she had asked for, but the point of this story is not the shitty behavior of the customer, it's the excellent customer service Kung Fu Tea provides.  When they say they'll adjust something to make you happy, they mean it.  I am impressed enough from watching their interaction this afternoon that I rate them 5 stars.",vOTb3fwyTBosONqNIZIr2g,1,1,5,ViEOXe7vjz2-oBV8Nb14Vw

I was just going to trash it but my friend went and had them remake it this time as a jasmine milk tea since that's what she got and it tasted okay.
So I get the jasmine milk tea and it's completely watered down, tastes like plain watered down MILK
My friend tried hers then mine and she confirmed that they tasted completely different.
They either hated me and fucked up on purpose or they have no idea how to keep a consistent recipe but either way it's a horrible way to run a business.

My go-to drink at the moment is their Strawberry Milk Slush with Extra Sugar and Herbal Jelly. The first time I got this drink, it wasn't as sweet as I liked - so I made sure to order it with extra sugar next time. Some days they make my drink spot on. Other days my drink will end up tasting like they didn't put any sugar at all, or they put just the normal sugar amount. I've also had days where there would be very little herbal jelly in my drink. 

I know that they always offer to make adjustments to my drink after it has been made. However, I always have my son with me, so I'm not able to taste my drink right away. I usually have to wait until I get back to my car and put my son in his car seat to do so. By the time I realize that my drink wasn't made properly, it's too much of a hassle for me to go back inside and have them correct it. 

I really like this place. I just wish they were more consistent with their drinks.

Adding an extra star for their superior customer service. It amazes me that even after 100+ reviews on yelp and a pretty stellar rating, that the owner still takes time to read and respond to most a lot of reviews. A+",qjrcCHNOhdz26BXhFB1NiQ,1,1,4,Fw5U9Kon4yb4UEwursPC_g

To be honest, the only reason I went was because I was craving boba tea and Fresh Cup closed down, and this happened to be on the right side of the road (as in I wouldn't have to make a u-turn or any other fancy turns or what not). I went in about 2:00pm which was awesome because the parking lot was empty. I hate the parking in that shopping center because it's always so busy. 

When I first entered, I was greeted and the gentleman offered me a sample of their drink of the day- whitegourd tea. It was too bitter for my taste, but other people might like it. My favorite drink is the almond milk tea, which I did not see on the menu. When I inquired about the drink, I was told it was the most popular drink. Then why isn't it on the menu..... They do have drinks made without milk for those lactose intolerant people. I forgot the name. haha. But just ask! 

They do have a lot of options to modify your drink ie: less ice, less sugar from 70% to 50% to 30%. Those options are great. The server did tell me to let him know if I wanted my drink modified after he gave it to me. 

Great service even though he was training someone at the same time that I was there! It was empty at 2. I was the only one there.  Three stars because my drink was not up to my usual taste.

The shop is very reminiscent of drink shops in Taiwan. It's a small, shop with a little bit of seating and the hustle bustle of a cafe for young people. Most of the customers and staff were students or young professionals. They play a selection of Kung-fu fighting scenes from various movies on their TV as to go with the name of the shop. It seems like many people take their drinks to-go, but the shop boasts a few tables and chairs for those who enjoy sipping their drinks and chatting. 

I generally don't like tea very much or boba (I know, I know, so shameful), so I was a little worried there wouldn't be as many options. But they have yogurt drinks (???/""yakult"") that come in different flavors, slushes/smoothies, and many varieties of drinks, tea, and milk tea. When ordering you can even adjust the level of sweetness and ice, which are options I only encountered while in Taiwan.

The place itself has a nice and small interior design. It's made to grab a boba drink and leave because it can get crammed with costumers if you're trying to sit down and enjoy your drink. The drinks here are a bit different than other places. They don't have as many flavors for slushes but they focus more on teas and milk teas, hence ""Kung Fu Tea.""

I always get the white gourd boba tea at 70% sweetness and it's always perfect. It's really nice that they give you so many sweetness options and that they always have samples so you can calibrate the sweetness. 

This place also never messes up orders because they print order stickers on the cups. Also, somehow despite how busy this place gets and how hard the employees work, they're always able to say hello and yell above the commotion to greet people who are walking in.

Finally I love the Kung fu theme. Especially the Bruce Lee paintings and action figures. 

However despite the decor, and the great tea, and friendly staff, this shop is only somewhat better than most boba places. They need to organize the line better somehow. It just doesn't makes sense having a long winding line in such a small shop. It makes it impossible to enjoy their space and it makes it even louder in there.

I ordered a large taro milk green tea. This is my favorite drink. It's creamy from the taro but not grainy, and you can actually taste the tea. Most other places, the tea doesn't play a prominent role in the overall flavor of the drink. 

It's not the fastest tea joint around, but the counter staff work furiously to get all the drinks out. I also appreciate that the cups are wiped down so you're not left with sticky honey fingers while enjoying your drink. 

Everytime I come here, I'm probably the oldest person in the room,  and the little kung fu characters that dot the cafe are so cute I want to buy one but never do.

Service is great, they describe to you their drinks whenever you have a question about it. Parking is plentiful, it's located inside a plaza just past Decatur and down on Spring Mountain Road.

Be prepared to customize your drink. They will ask you how sweet do you want it, how much ice and how much milk do you want in your drink.",KQm9OgdujLZiMRTksmj83w,2,2,4,U2aob6Hz5MqO_ZFdEFQduA

[Location]
In the Chinatown area (yeah, apparently they have one in Vegas). Next to a ramen house (delicious), Korean BBQ place, Japanese curry, and Big Wong Chinese Restaurant.

So if you find the Big Wong, then you're definitely close to the best balls in Vegas.


[Drink]
I ordered the Green wow milk with mung bean. After checking in yelp I got free topping so through some balls in there! Alright!
-Balls were the real deal. Just like the top boba places in SoCal.
-I enjoyed how they provide you the option to adjust the amount of sugar in your drink per request. Very mindful.

Place was clean, plenty of sitting space, and all the staff were fantastic.

[Kung Fu Themed]
-I LIKED how the monitors played kung fu clips. I LOVED the bruce lee figurines that apparently they sell as well. Took a few shots because they were just bad ass.

I'm a foodie, and I don't hand out Five Stars like candy. They are well earned, encompassing all aspects facilitating the dining/eating experience.

Pros: Their Boba Milk Tea is unbelievably off the CHARTS. It is superb, and the honey tapioca pearls are to die for. Seriously, #KungfuTea holds it down bar none. And the staff is extremely friendly!  

Cons: Okay, who puts a cash register for the weekend crowd of 10-person deep to deal with, when it's only 5' from the main entrance -- a CON not easily over-looked if not for quality of staff and product -- but I'm giving'em a five-star bump in spite of how irritating that door location is.

Recently just opened, the ratings for this place are legit. Everything including, drink quality, to the exceptional service, to the value, is on point.

Kung Fu might make the best boba in town!! It has a nice ""gummy bear"" texture, not too hard or mushy, which a good bubble tea place must have, and has a clean, caramelly, flavor.

When I come here I normally get their tea drinks. The tea they brew is strong, but not bitter. I think that their taro milk tea is probably the 2nd best drink in town (following closely behind Fresh Cup's avocado smoothie).

The only knock that I'll give them is on their much heralded herbal jelly. To me, it just taste like a regular jelly, I couldn't tell you what kind of herbs that they infused inside.

They have a brilliant ordering system that allows you to control how sweet, or how much ice is in your drink. The prices are very reasonable.

Service here is on point. The employees are helpful, quick, and very accurate. The ambiance of the shop is cool, especially with the Bruce Lee videos playing on the telly, lol.

I haven't seen any other boba places that do this. Second, they have cool Bruce Lee memorbilia all over the place (obviously called Kung Fu tea). The tea selection is great. I only have two small complaints. I ordered taro bubble tea and they asked how sweet I wanted it (they have different levels of sweetness). Since I love sugar I ordered the maximum sweetness, however when I got it it tasted extra ""tea"" flavor and less taro sugar flavor. So I'm not sure if the sweetness refers to the amount of tea flavor they use or the amount of sugar flavor or whatever. They are the only place I know which adjust the sweetness like this so that is very cool, just make sure to clarify which sweetness.

Also, sometimes the line is TOO long! Last time I was here the line was literally going out the door with like 7-8 people waiting outside. I don't know if this is the norm during peak hours but I simply couldn't wait. I don't hold this against the tea place as this is a good sign and I congratulate them, but still it sucks having to wait. You also have to be patient while waiting for the tea as it can take some time.

We ended up getting mango green tea with boba, kung fu tea with boba, peach oolong tea with boba, yogurt green tea with boba, and wintermelon tea.

The mango green tea tastes like basic mango green tea, but it did have a slight hint of bitterness in the aftertaste but it wasn't strong and it wasn't bad. Would recommend!

The kung fu tea is the class black milk tea which tastes pretty average, but I like to try different store's classic teas so I went for it. I liked it - it tasted like Taiwanese black milk tea, and had more of a homemade taste to it. My boyfriend didn't really like it though, he said it tasted like it had cinnamon in it but I couldn't taste the cinnamon. Would recommend! (For those that like classic black milk tea.)

The peach oolong tea was recommended drink and las vegas favorite according to the star on their menu but no one in our party liked it. The oolong just didn't complement the peach flavor or peach chunks at all. It starts out kinda sweet but then just tastes like weird oolong tea, I don't even know how to describe it. Would not recommend.

The yogurt green tea literally tasted like Yakult. If you like Yakult, definitely get this! Would recommend!

The wintermelon tea tasted like your average wintermelon tea, it didn't taste too special to me but it wasn't bad. It had a nice blend of tea without overpowering sweetness.

Lastly, the boba itself is good as well. It's not too soft and not too hard so it is perfectly chewy. It also comes with colorful boba mixed with the regular black boba - they all taste the same though. Also, you can adjust the sweetness of your drink (100% is regular, then it's 70%, 50%, 30%, and 0%).

Definitely would recommend Kung Fu Tea! It was my first time here but others in my party had come here before and it was their decision to come back.",gtOWPcyGWVP1Jx8b1jfY4A,0,0,4,fVkGlCB6d4_u2dL_rI16tg

The interior design and decor is quite admirable and interesting to look at. There's painted canvases not he walls (for sale!), there are cute miniature Bruce Lee kung fu figures all around, the work area and seating area is clean, and there's a tv inside playing a youtube playlist of kung fu/comedy related videos for the customer's entertainment.

The workers are outstanding, always welcoming and helpful with deciding what to order, or taking your trash, or even offering samples to try. They're always smiling even with a long line to serve. I always use the free topping check-in offer so that's a win for me overtime I go there. It's a relaxing environment and I definitely recommend it to all you boba lovers. 

Some additional info is that they've got a small bench outside and one bathroom (eh, it's decent). But overall, the quality is definitely the best I've had in Vegas and they're open late so it's all good!",wzMXdjM-_DlDBkpg3xKnGQ,5,3,5,ht8fe-6nLM02JokH8rkzZg

First of all, their degree of customization they offer to the order is great. It's like a boba Starbucks. They also offer a multitude of...things to put in your tea: boba, herbal jelly, nata jelly, red bean, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember right now. What's amazing is that every single one of them have been delicious. 

Second, they offer lactose free milk. Woot! I don't understand why other boba places couldn't figure this out. I mean, aren't most Asians lactose intolerant?

Third, they usually have a ""tea of the day"" sample which features more unusual teas. I've gotten to love a lot of new flavors I probably would not have tried on my own.

I ordered a large mango green tea with boba and jellies with half sugar. With a check in on Yelp, you get a free add on so I got the jellies free. Cool deal. I got my daughter a small passion fruit slush with jellies. The boba was soft and fresh. Best tasting boba ever. The jellies were sweet and soft. I loved this place because there was music playing and a large flat screen television inside. Seating was limited and the place got packed with people fast. Must be a popular place for drinks.

Nice hardwood accents in dining area, but you'll need more than 8 seats- not sure why bar-style table along front window doesn't have any chairs. Liked that I was able to watch a kung-fu movie as I waited for my order- streaming from Hulu.

A handful of choices from their menu - milk teas, slushes, teas, and coffee.
I must say there isn't a lot of flavors, but the flavors they do have are good! Along with their milk teas and slushes, there's customization with the drinks (i.e. sweetness level, more/less toppings, more/less ice, etc), that's definitely a plus! 

Favorites would have to be taro and matcha green tea - either in milk tea or slush.

I'm a pretty serious boba drink guy, and it always comes down to two things: 
1) How good is the boba? 
and 
2) How good is the tea itself?

With Kung Fu Tea, the answers to both questions is ""Awesome!"".  
If you like boba, this is among the best and most consistent I've ever tried anywhere (east coast, west coast, Asia), and certainly the best in Vegas.  It has a pleasant honey-like flavor and was always perfectly cooked.

I appreciate that you can customize the sweetness of the drinks, which is always welcome, and there are a variety of bobas and jellies to add-in to your hearts content.

I highly recommend the Taro Slush, the coffee slush, and the Honey Green Tea with Boba as my favorites.

The cost is a little high for my preference (usually $5-6 per large drink of choice with boba), but the drinks are so darn good. They have an interesting sweetness-by-request system where you can request a percentage of what sweetness level you want (100%=normal sweetness level). Kung fu movies are always playing in the background on the TV and they have martial arts-themed paintings for sale throughout the place. The Kung Fu Milk Tea although seemingly a plain choice when they have other exciting fruit/yogurt concoctions available is my favorite. At least so far, because again, there is an extensive menu of drinks. Every time I've gone there's always been a bit of a crowd (not in a bad way, mind you, but this is a popular place). Tip: if you're looking for the best fresh boba, go to a place that looks busy!!! Same rule applies to buffets, friends.

Just expect to wait...meh. 1 star for the taste of the drink. I typically always go to Brew Tea Bar but this place is closer to work. Won't make that mistake again.",n9qd2GsOBzQf4pBCLcZ8CQ,2,2,1,piREbIRhErX48R50HhX70Q

1721949,2015-01-02,2,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"YES! FINALLY ANOTHER PLACE THAT SELLS GOOD BOBA!

As big as Boba tea and Yelp gets, there are and will always hipsters and wannabe foodies who claim to know what's good and what's not. You may think I'm one of them and you are entitled to your own opinion, but you'd be wrong :)

Originally, I avoided this place because of the stupid name. I mean come on... ""Kung Fu Tea""? You can come up with something better than that... But one day I came because Snowflake was closed and I was with some people that wanted boba, and boy was I glad I finally had a chance to try this place. 

My review will solely focus on their tea/milk tea drinks since I haven't tried any of their blended fruit drinks. The tea that they use in their drink is so flavorful and you can tell its not cheap stuff that other places use. These guys use fresh tea leaves to brew their tea and not that powder nonsense that takes 0 effort to prepare. I just can not express how great it is for a drink shop to use REAL ingredients for their customers. They also have a great system to order the level of sweetness.

I'm starting to believe all the great boba places in town have really dumb names. I HIGHLY recommend this place.",P0Zd9BjnCgbfzsHiQFdhoA,2,1,5,vUfPmbNZZeBI5em43yh3gg

Ordered my go-to: Jasmine Milk Tea or as their menu says, Green Milk Tea and it was perfect 10/10.
The tea was fresh, but not too strong and no modifications needed since the sweetness level was on point. 
And what's even better? When I asked for less boba, they actually did. 

Only complaint would be the size of the store. If the tables are already filled, good luck trying to sit and chat with friends cause that's not happening!! 
Love the interior decorations. Oh and they have a machine that'll shake the drinks that's fun to watch. 

I'll probably visit the other location next time since the place was too crowded :(    Parking lot, too.",wdJKGY0xI5jpFrEL4Gm2fQ,2,2,5,1qJi2i2Khiy_cBtolhZ1NA

I usually get a Kung-Fu Black Milk Tea or their Jasmine Green Milk Tea--both flavors are really good. 

PROS:
-their Yelp Check-In: 1 free topping (so be sure to check in!)
-adjustable sweetness/ice/and boba levels.
-REALLY REALLY GOOD BOBA AND MILK TEA; never too sweet and the boba is cooked perfectly.

CONS:
-small space, and it gets crowded often; so there isn't really a lot of seating area if you want to hang out.
-parking lot is almost always full, so finding a spot is always difficult.

If you're a Vegas visitor, Kung-Fu Tea needs to be a stop in your itinerary.",Fpfw1dtekpW1beAH8T1cwQ,2,1,5,ny-rRLFJO1OujQC87OkBQw

The tea flavor was okay , it was more milky than tea. The biggest turn-off though is that they skimp on the boba !! I thought it was probably because I used my Yelp check-in for free topping but I also ordered a taro slush to-go , paid for the additional boba topping , and they still barely put any. My friends also thought their drinks were just ""okay"" , they had better , and noticed that all the drinks that came out hardly had any boba in them too. Some of the boba were undercooked , it wasn't like that before. They still do adjustments and can remake it for you to your liking but it was a pretty busy Sunday night and the employees there were working hard so we didn't wanna bother asking to re-make (when we asked it was an estimated 15 minute wait to remake or put a drink order).",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,3,3,3,Te8KFyYQOx51_VfdJJgBTA

I really wanted to try their boba but was feeling healthy and the first drink I ordered was so good I had to order it again. My friend tried it and loved it as well so she ordered the same thing also. 

I got the Almond Milk Tea (half sugar) with herbal jelly. Definitely a healthy alternative to boba ir you are feeling healthy also! Half sugar for me was just the perfect amount of sweetness because I don't like my drinks too sweet. 

My friend got the Oolong Milk Tea (regular sugar). This was really good also because even at regular sweetness, it wasn't too sweet.

My favorite drink is the white gourd (white gourd being a winter melon) green tea with nata jelly (which I believe is coconut jelly) at regular sweetness. It has a slight bitterness that I like and is not too too sweet. It is a taste that is indescribable and unique on its own. Drinks are always consistent and not lacking once you find your go-to drink.

I love the energy of the staff here; they always acknowledge when you walk in and walk out in loud voices which is a wonderful plus. They are knowledgeable about the menu and will help out find a drink suitable for your taste. If the drink doesn't come out how you like they will gladly do any adjustments or suggest changing your drink entirely.

I also like that they will have daily samples sometimes so you can try out new drinks and find one that works for you. I honestly found my love of the white gourd this way when they introduced it through samples. If not, then I would have never tried or found it because the very sound of the name doesn't give me any idea to how the drink would taste. 

On other visits with other people or through samples I've gotten to try the Oreo Oolong Milk Tea, Pineapple Sunshine Tea, Longan date tea, Mango Green tea, WOW Matcha with red bean, and Hot Taro Milk tea, among others. Defintiely the most drinks than I'll ever get to try at any other cafe/coffee shop for sure :p

Good amount of parking space in this plaza. They also have air conditioning. Which goes to say they want the door CLOSED. Lol they had to keep reminding customers that, which kind of got annoying, but understandable! 
Decent sized space. I would say like maybe 4-5 ppl max will fit comfortably together. I went at a very busy hour where there was a small line outside the door(2-3ppl in front of us). I feel like we got through the line in about 10 min and had to wait another 10-15 to get the drink.

Food/drink: I got the mango snow in the medium size(aka the smallest size). I liked it, it wasn't too sweet. And you can also adjust the sweetness levels here. They charged extra for creamer which I think is used to make it into a snow texture. My friend got the mango snow too! But he got it in a size large and I feel like they  put too much creamer in his or something because it tasted a lot sweeter. My other friend got the matcha green tea with red bean. I liked her drink too. It wasn't sweet at all, that's how I like my matcha. But it also wasn't bitter either. 

Customer service: the cashier was very nice, he was very clear and straightforward about taking orders. Orders are just called out loud, the person who called it out had a loud deep voice that was easy to hear. 

Right now they have a promotion of getting free topping when you check in so don't forget! They also checked our receipts when we got our drinks so you shouldn't throw it away!

1933863,2016-01-28,1,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Best milk tea I've tried in Vegas thus far!!

Usually when I'm in Vegas I never crave for boba because they just don't taste as great to me.. (I come from the Bay Area with super popular boba joints at each corner) so I would just hold my yearning for boba until I get to go home to California. 

Because I was in the area and they have sooo many awesome reviews I decided to give it a shot. Came in and it's a cute little spot with awesome decor! I love the feel of the place, very warm and bright. I really love how they have plenty of signs to inform their customers about their menu and what makes them different from other boba joints. Aka, how they cook FRESH boba every 2 hours! That's pretty darn awesome. Oh! And their Herbal Jelly is made in house as well!! Super super awesome. 

Anyway, I came in somewhat prepared since I looked through many Yelp tips and reviews to get an idea of what their signature drink is - WHITE GOURD!! omg so delicious!! At first I was leaning towards my go-to (Oolong) but the guy at the register made me feel super comfortable and told me I should definitely give it a shot and if anything, they'll make a new drink I'd like (which I wouldn't make them remake even if I didn't like it, but it was so nice for him to offer). I ordered the White Gourd with their Herbal Jelly..... Omg amaaazeballllsssss!!! Love it. So, just to describe the drink - if you're into oolong or roasted almond milk tea, you will definitely like the White Gourd! It has that fresh roasty taste. AND the herbal jelly is a must too!! At first I was anticipated for it to be a somewhat hard jelly like lychee, rainbow, or coffee jelly. Instead, it had the same consistency of pudding, like egg pudding. I absolutely loved it!! I ordered the drink with regular sweetness and regular ice. Everything turned out perfect. 

Super happy I stopped by. Great atmosphere, great service, great drinks!! 5 stars forsure. I will be back!! :-)",X7zysG3Cja6G2blwDyE76Q,4,3,5,OIiUPOe7GLCD-2tCGIQ-iA

So this place is straight to the point once you decipher the menu. For my 1st time I was a little at lost but I knew I wanted milk tea so I honed in on that. The menu is sectioned into different types of drink. Honey tea, Smoothies, milk tea etc. once you figured that out they have different flavor for each drinks. I tried the Oreo Milk Tea with my YELP check in free topping Boba.

The Milk teas flavor is amazing not to strong and not too sweet with a blend of Oreo cookies it was different but good. The little specs of creaming sweet icing from the cookies were a nice treat whenever you suck one up in the straw. Then there was the Boba cool perfectly just chewy enough not hard and not mushy. 

I drank it so fast but for $4 something for a large I guess that's ok. I can't wait to come back to try all their other drinks and toppings. It is hidden in a behind the scene kind of spot in china town so if you have GPS that helps!",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,2,1,5,F4yu727_8hCfZB_2nByy4g

I would say that even Quickly's has better milk tea. Maybe, I'm just spoiled living in California which has a mecca of boba spots. They had samples of their milk tea and after taking one sip I immediately tossed the cup. There was way too much creamer in it. So, I order a Jasmine green tea (I didn't want to order a milk tea after trying it, and you can't customize the milk level). Jasmine mt/tea is my go to drink- if you can't make a good basic drink then I'm not sure why people go to you. I kept drinking my tea hoping that with time it'll taste better. I ended up tossing most of the cup after I left. The tea tasted watery, to be honest it just tasted like water with a splash of tea. It was just that the tea they used was really bland or underwhelming. Not sure why this place has such high reviews. Maybe, I should've tried another drink that isn't the basic teas? All I know is the next day (when I was back in NorCal) I had to go get a boba right away to wash away the taste! 2* is for the cute decor/concept/service/location.",42OAcUUIX5xvnz-QY3usmw,1,1,2,iXFUsKRgRPFv0wuPLlzftQ

It's nice to be able to drive off the strip and get some affordable boba milk tea. We stopped by during our stay in Vegas and wanted to get some drinks before heading back to the hotel. Kung Fu is located in a busy plaza in LV's Chinatown. We came right before closing at 12am and originally I had wanted to order the white gourd green tea, but they had run out of green tea. I opted for just the white gourd tea with herbal jelly and bf got the coffee milk tea. White gourd tea was really sugary, but the herbal jelly was able to kind of help off set the sugar a bit. The coffee milk tea was strong on the tea, but not the coffee. It tasted ok and I'm glad it wasn't as sweet as my drink. We didn't end up finishing our drinks that night.

I've been to boba everywhere and the boba here is usually soft, freshly made (AKA warm), and sweet!! a lot of their teas are amazing, some are super sweet and some are for those who are into bitterly flavored teas. 
Here are a few I've tried and my thoughts:

***Peach oolong tea (with 70% sweetness)- my first drink and a favorite!! sweet, peachy, with fresh chunks of peach fruit!
Very berry green tea- food, but not a fan of the seeds and it's kinda bitter 
***Strawberry lemon green tea- surprisingly really good!! The tartness and sweetness is perfectly balanced!! It's weird at first but it grows on you.
**Oreo oolong milk tea (with 70% sweetness)- my BFFs always get this and I am never shy to ""try"" some over and over again.
Signature white gourd tea- meh, too sweet for me
Longan red date tea- my dad likes it, especially with the chunk of date in there; still too sweet for me
Matcha milk strike- not that much of a fan, but still good?
***Kung Fu milk green tea- one of my faves!!! perfect sweetness, very floral, light, and refreshing!

I don't remember much else; all I do remember is that I'll be back again soon probably in a few days. So good.

They don't have  my favorite rose milk tea, but they do have fresh black/green/oolong tea that  doesn't taste 3 days old or like it's been sitting in tea leaves for too long !  Oolong milk tea tastes really yummy with their nata jelly, and I really like the bubble milk tea with black tea , which is a little sweet with a pleasant sort of floral taste!

Their slushes are great as well!
I definitely recommend the taro slush which is, blended nicely and  is pretty creamy. Also the passion fruit slush for something refreshing and fruity/tropical!

Walking in there they have Bruce Lee movies playing on the TV, appropriate for being Kung Fu tea. 
To my delight I saw that there was a Taro slush. I've always been a mega slush fan dating back to the days of 7-11 as a kid getting slurpees and fruit slushes. I also had to go back into my memory bank thinking of what Taro tasted like remembering how much I enjoyed Taro ice cream. So I went with the Taro slush, no boba, no nothing in it, just straight up.

Wow the Taro slush was amazing. The powder they use must be some of that purple magic because even after subsequent visits to other places and ordering a Taro slush, the one at Kung Fu tea still reigns supreme like Bruce Lee.",611MiIXJkXM82I1y3Hg9eA,1,0,5,5lDO57jYpb9tYIVGM2Ra2Q

They even let you choose the sweetness level as well as ice level in order to try to placate the wide variety of Boba pickiness out there. I ordered the White Gourd Tea. I had no idea what to expect from this at all. What the Hell is a White Gourd? It was very delicious. There's so much to try on the menu so it looks like I'll be coming back quite often.
There was a bit of a line when I went around noon, but it seemed to move at a decent speed. While I was waiting in the back, I noticed that they were actually playing some Kung Fu flicks on the TV in the back! What a novel concept. I found this mildly amusing.

I ordered a medium taro slush with boba and it was just finishing by the time I arrived. The girl on the phone asked me if I wanted it regular sweetness and I said sure. Big mistake. I found this to be wayyyy too sweet for me so I gave it to my coworker. She thought it was perfectly sweet so I guess it's personal preference. I did enjoy the boba though, they were chewy and delicious.

Next time I came in they were out of Boba. Booooo. It was only 5pm so I was pretty disappointed. The sweet cashier offered some other toppings and even let me sample the different jellies they offer such as herbal and pineapple. I wasn't a fan of the herbal, but the pineapple was pretty tasty. I didn't think either jelly would taste good with what I wanted though so I ended up skipping that, but it was nice to have been able to try them. I always wondered what all the puddings, beans and jellies tasted like. I usually just order boba, but I love trying things out of my comfort zone. 

Anyway I ended up with a matcha red bean slush with red bean topping. This time I ordered it less sweet and it was perfect. TBH I have never had red beans before, but they were actually pretty good and a tad sweet. I for sure don't like red bean as much as boba, but it's always fun to have other options.

You're greeted with a ""Hello, welcome!"" when you walk in, and a ""Bye, thank you!"" when you leave. If you ever need an adjustment on your drink, they will be happy to make it right. The place has a lot of artwork on the walls you can buy from local artists. Seating is limited, so not exactly a place to hang out and do your homework. But perfect place chat over some boba for a few minutes.

I recommend the honey oolong. It's sweet but not to sugary and the tea is always fresh. The best oolong around. I also just discovered their mango snow slush. It's like a sweet refreshing dessert in a cup. 

This place works hard to making sure their drinks taste good. Not like a lot of places that scoop some powder and shake it up. The only downside to this place is the parking for the whole plaza.

Five stars for the:

1. Unique menu. It has all the traditional boba drinks as well as unique ones that are good for lactose intolerant folks like me. My favorite is the Honey WOW Milk--a dairy-free drink with honey boba and herbal jelly. 

2. Honey boba. Enough said.

3. Customer service. They will always tell you that if you don't like how it tastes, they can modify it for you. I've had drinks where I experimented a bit too much on sweetness and they always changed it for me good-naturedly. 

4. You can custom order the sweetness of your drink to reduce the calories. 

5. Supporting local artists. The walls display artwork that you can buy-- all Asian-themed (carp, Buddha, kungfu).

MATCHA MILK $4 - I added boba and egg pudding which was good, but I can get the same exact drink at Class 302 in California for $1 less. I liked that I could adjust the sweetness level so it wasn't super overpowering.

GINGER BROWN SUGAR MILK - I think this was a special because I don't see it on the menu in the pictures. So good with herbal jelly! We got it hot and it was very comforting. The ginger might be too much for some people, but I really liked it and feel like the brown sugar was a good balance. Recommend!

LOGAN RED DATE TEA - This was a sample on the counter and it's super good! I noticed that the texture of this tea is thicker than regular teas, but that didn't bother me.

I want to give five stars, but I'm just holding back because no matter what kind of tea I get from Kung Fu Tea, I'm just not a fan. I think it's a matter of preference. The tea flavor never really shines through, and I'm a fan of a strong tea flavor. It just seems too weak, like they needed the leaves to boil in just a little more.

I came here to check out their milk tea. It was really weird. I guess accidentally ordered their oolong milk tea of which I am decidedly not a fan. Their oolong had an unpleasant floral overtone that did not go well with milk. Plus, they used regular milk instead of evaporated milk leading to a rather thin consistency. Definitely not creamy enough.

The ambience is rather noisy with distinct echo effect in the joint. We found it difficult to have a decent conversation in there. Seats are all wooden without any cushions - definitely not comfy. Decor is pop-inspired artwork with a lot of Bruce Lee motifs.

2154915,2016-09-24,1,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"I happened to visit on a Saturday afternoon when the parking lot was quite full, but no one was inside the shop. After my order was up and I sat down, about 6 people arrived in less than 5 minutes, so I can definitely see this place filling up fast.

They warmly greet and help you, and I admitted I was new so I got some assistance with the toppings. I was offered a sample of egg pudding when I asked what it was, so that was really cool. Many boba places make their coconut milk tea extremely sweet, so I erred on less sugar (70%).

Initially, I asked if I could get a coconut taro blend and to Nelson's same experience was told they can't due to franchise rules. 

Drink came out fast but still gave me a chance to look around at the cool art inside. I snapped a couple photos for later to see if the significant other liked any for purchase - I definitely did!

The taste was underwhelming. Maybe it's my fault for ordering less sugar, but there was not a lot of flavor. Coconut is pretty distinct in all my boba experiences and this tasted faint. The pudding was a really nice addition (which I got for free with the Yelp check-in) and less ice was also a good choice. The prices are pretty reasonable/normal (my medium was less than $4) and lactose-free is always great for me.

Overall, it's a fun atmosphere with incredible employees/customer service but I don't see myself driving across town just to pick up one of these, especially if it's way busier than this.

Took about 10-15 minutes to make two simple drinks.  And service is good at times less good other times.  It's pretty much a place that teens go to kill time and catch up/hang out so prepare for lots of boisterous kids who don't have a volume setting.  Seating is minimal so don't count on seating during peak times like after lunch or after dinner time.  There is a tv inside that plays random Chinese movie scenes.....

I recommend the almond milk tea with pudding for those who don't like boba.  It is actually done well, just have to be patient.  Prices are ok, so large drinks come out to be about $11.  You can adjust everything from sugar sweetness level to ice to a out of milk, which is nice!!

my old fave, no 1 boba, started overcooking their boba so i've been boba-less for a while now.
thank goodness for kung fu tea.

no, it's not the best i've ever had but it's darn close.
the boba itself is cooked perfectly...the consistency is just chewy enough without disintegrating between your teeth and just al dente enough without feeling like you're eating raw boba.

the milk tea, for me, is a little too creamy.
i would prefer that the tea flavor be more prevalent.
the non-milk teas were very good without being overly sweet.
the process of choosing your preferred amount of ice and sweetness level comes directly from taiwan, where boba originated.
everyone has a different palate and taste is subjective so it's nice that they'll customize your drink for you based on your preferences.

the service is also great and super friendly.
there's always someone greeting you with a smile as soon as you enter.
they are also extremely accommodating.
i get the feeling that all they want is for the customer to be happy with their purchase and i find that to be so refreshing.

my only complaint would be the air flow.
it has been quite warm the few times i've been in there.

The biggest thing I would add is LOVE personality in any business more so restaurants. Kung Fu Tea has it own personality comes to the ever growing boba tea/more names that people call it in this day and age. I enjoy boba drinks. I am far from addict might get boba on rare occasion. On this night it was the perfect spot to chill with Ohana visiting while waiting to get seated at Hwaro couple doors down. The menu is pretty diverse comes to options. First time was torn in lot of ways but kind of went with comfort high oolong tea with boba and the sweetness level keep mild or not over the top sweet. It was really good!!! The boba was on point! 

The personality talking about, It small boba spot not the smallest one been in Vegas. Once you walk inside looking at the walls with all the different artwork. All of them one of kind artwork from different artists and all of them can purchase if you like them. Each one had bold colors and each one truly different style. It stands out and pretty much impossible not to check out while waiting on your order or just chilling there over book or conversations. The menu is pretty straight forward nothing confusing and lot of pictures help you with choices. 

The staff is super friendly, high energy, and awesome.  

The only downside but mention that for any restaurant in that tiny shopping mall. Is when the place gets packed parking flat out sucks. You might end up parking on the street but no matter the hassle it worth your troubles.

There's never anywhere to sit when I go! Probably because it's so good! Also I like how the boba is made fresh every 2 hours.

Decor: All related to Kung Fu. After all, that's why they call it Kung Fu Tea in the first place. They have kung fu movie play through out the day. 

Menu/ ingredients: all kind of tea drinks. They even have the milk top (salted milk foam) which can be combined with any tea drinks. My favorite is Jasmine Green Tea with milk top. With boba of course. I love how they have rules of FRESH bobas throughout the day. No hard cold bobas here. Their teas are fresh and you can taste the difference. For those of you who are concerned about sweets and being healthy, you can customize your drink's sweetness. This is important for me as I don't like drinks that are waaaau too sweet. It kills the tea taste IMO. 

Service: top notch. Customer is well taken care of. If you do not like your drinks or need adjustments, just let them know and they will replace it. 

Recommendation: more special drinks/ seasonal drinks which will bring repeat customers. I'd love to try new drinks or even fruit tea fusion!

They started selling cookies which are ok.  They are very fair in their refunds too as when they messed up the tea & I said I didn't like it they gave me another one no questions asked.

Located in the same plaza with Monta Ramen and Snowflake Shavery. Parking is easy to find. This boba shop is kinda small but there's plenty of seating on the inside. The decor here is absolutely adorable! It's obviously ""kung fu"" themed since it's in their name, so there were cute little kung fu figurines placed around the store. They were even playing a kung fu movie! The cashier was very friendly and offered my friend and I samples of their passion fruit green tea. 

Even though the passion fruit green tea was delicious, I ended up going with something else. I really liked the option to control your sugar intake so I ordered the mango green tea with 70% less sugar. The mango green tea also came with little bits and pieces of mango jelly. This was the perfect drink because it wasn't sweet and kinda bitter but I like it that way. You can really taste the tea flavor and the mango jelly was a nice touch.

This place can get busy. Lines out the door is a familiar site, but it moves fairly quickly to order. Receiving your drink requires a bit of patience though since they are busy. I didn't mind either time since I wasn't in a rush. They messed up my order but were so nice and apologetic about it I'm not even mad.

Its greatness: 1) You can customize the sweetness level which I appreciate. If it's not sweet enough or too sweet - they will fix it for you too. 2) Compared to the other boba shops I've been to, Kung Fu Tea has a definite tea taste - that I love as well! You can tell they use real tea - hurrah for the real stuff :D I'm just letting you know that in case that influences where you spend your dollar dollar bills at for these Asian dranks. 3) If you're lactose intolerant, they have alternatives. If you are caffeine-sensitive - they have drinks for you to choose from too :) Pretty darn thoughtful in my opinion. 

There aren't that many tables, but there is a decent amount of places to sit to wait for your drink to come out. We were able to grab a half table one out of the 2 visits. It looked like people were using the space to study, and socialize. They must have had wi-fi since I saw a whole table crew with full-fledged laptops and notebooks out.

I have tried the milk tea and the oreo milk tea both were delicious! I get mine without tapioca.

It is very hard to make a decision here because they have so many things to choose from.  Take the time to choose while you are waiting so you know exactly what you want when you get to the front of the line.

Sometimes, when I'm in college, I'll dream about getting a good cup of cold boba and desperately long for KFT.

I wouldn't really recommend this as a place to sit-down or chat because it's really loud, but I love coming here after getting KBBQ at Hwaro or ramen from Monta. 

My favorite thing to get here is my super special top secret recipe drink: White Gourd Milk Half Green/Half Oolong Tea with Half Boba/Half Egg Pudding and light ice. Their boba is made fresh every two hours, and I absolutely love how they soak it in a light honey mixture so it doesn't have that bland/rubbery texture. 

My second favorite drink to get is a Mango Snow - it's like a mango smoothie but creamier.

The Taro Mung Bean Slush and also the Matcha Milk were both great! Thick, rich in flavor, high quality ingredients, and not at all too icy or watery. Lots of flavor! 

Their Taro Milk Tea w/ honey boba is also rich and deep in taro flavor (they don't use artificial tasting ingredients)  It's not a bad choice, but also not my personal favorite - my boyfriend loves it (I'll sneak a sip here and there.)

Honey Black Tea with honey boba has a robust steeped black tea flavor and the honey boba sweetens it up nicely. It's a great choice if you're feeling something lighter and refreshing.

Taro and Red Bean Slush is crazy BOMB as well! It's thick and has bold taro and red bean flavor. They use all quality ingredients. You won't taste powder here! If you can't handle (seriously delicious) flavor, I wouldn't recommend it. ;) 

WOW Green Milk with added Red Bean is another a great choice. It's not actually a milk tea- it's lactose free milk with red bean, mung bean, and honey boba toppings. Give this one a whirl if you're feeling adventurous. You'll enjoy the chewy textures of the beans and boba.

My personal favorite has to be the Golden Oolong Milk Tea w/ honey boba. I can't stop drinking it. If you enjoy flavorful milk tea that's not too thick, this is the perfect choice! It's refreshing and the honey boba sweetens it up nicely.

Also, we always make sure to communicate to them that we want it sweet, but not a sugar bomb and they always hook us right up! Just tell them the percentage of sugar you want them to add: 

Less sugar: 70%
Half Sugar: 50%
Little sugar: 30%
No sugar: 0% duh :p

Thanks KFT crew!

Pro tip: the honey in the boba dissolves into the drink if you drink it very slowly (like we do.) So at first it might not seem too sweet, but in due time it will become sweeter.

Loooove the combination of flavors in this drink - not too sweet, a hint of green tea, and a hint of taro in every sip. A large is $4.25 and as much as I hate paying for boba as an add-on, I'll give them a pass since this is one case where I can say it's worth the extra $.50 cents. Ha!

1. They have a huge variety of drinks to offer. Every drink I've had has been good. My latest discovery was the Oreo oolong milk tea. It has tiny pieces of Oreo, so it gives you that hint of it plus the oolong gives it that creaminess. So good! And I love that you can customize the amount of sugar in any drink. 
2. The employees are so friendly and patient. They greet everyone that walks in and offer suggestions if you're indecisive. When they make you're drink, they ask if it's ok so they can make any adjustments to the sweetness or anything. 
3. The decor is so cute. The little king fu characters by the bar are super cute. And the wall art by local artists are cool to look at. (You can purchase the wall art. The price is listed right next to it.) 
4. They are open late, so you can satisfy you're boba craving late at night. 
5. Free topping with Yelp check in!! Score!!!! Who doesn't love free boba?!?!

Now for why I docked a star...
1. It's located in a super busy plaza, so parking can be a disaster. 
2. When you walk in, the register is right there. So if there's a line, the entrance/exit can get backed up. Can you say fire hazard? 
3. Their boba texture is inconsistent. Some times it perfectly chewy. And other times, like when we went last night, can be on the harder side. 
4. There's only a few tables, so it's hard to sit and relax. Especially if they are busy and there are a lot of people in there, yeah it's kind of cramped and chaotic.

I really like the fact that they use authentic chinese tea because that is pretty unique.  I would rate my Caramel Macchiato a 4.5; but overall a 3-4 because the Milk Green Tea was watered down and need to be sweetened a bit more.  I also tried the sample Pineapple Green Tea, and it tasted strange.  My advice is to continue using the same  tea and brewing method; but master supplemental flavor to compliment the tea.

I would have given this place a 3, but I don't want to drag their overall rating down as I know that it is pretty challenging to run a food/drink business.",ipS3zwvSxTKCXfp9VRCg8g,0,0,4,0gF9FwYQjuM8Za6rU876sw

The pros: service I believe is pretty good for a boba place. They have levels of sweetness to choose from right at the register so you can customize your order from the start, but also are very sweet in saying ""if it's not to your liking, bring it back and we can fix it"" or something to that extent. I've only been here 2 or 3 times, but each time, I have noticed that they say this when they hand you your boba drink. Very profession and caring! 

Cons: the area is right within a plaza with a locals favorite ramen spot (Monta), another shave ice/boba shop, & Asian restaurants, so the parking is very limited. However there is a side road where many people park that you can park at if the plaza parking is too full.

Horrible customer service. Our cashier did not greet us from the start and the whole time we ordered she did not smile at all. The cashier had a slight attitude while ordering.

Service was decent, but unapologetic that they seemed to be catering to all the other ""like"" / ""similar"" customers before us.

Waste of our time and money, we'll skip this place next time we're in Vegas.

EDITED TO ADD;

Owner seems to have confused me with someone else.  I wasn't there yesterday with a group of ""girls"" (so quick to assume!) ... I was there last month with a couple dudes.  So while I appreciate the quick fix, it's actually incorrect.  So no, there was no telephone order that was being premade before ours, I didn't assume anything was premade and I don't think I like the thought that apologies are only offered if customers give off dissatisfied vibes?  Methinks not.

EDIT AGAIN;

It's really hard to read the internet - so I have no clue at this point if the owner is being sarcastic in his [edited] response or not.  In the past if owners have issues with a review, they send a private message to get the details ironed out, before publicly posting - sometimes that itself is enough for me to adjust my review after feeling like my concerns have been addressed.  Sadly though, I don't know if that is the intention or not, because the tone that I take with the response may be a sarcastic one, while it is actually genuine.

I came here to get some work done and enjoy a caffeinated boba beverage. First off this place located in shopping mall that's not only has minimal parking, but also makes you think you're walking into some sort of make shift boba shop that's in the back of a old school hot pot place. This was not the case; going from the outside to the inside of Kung Fu Tea is like walking into a another dimension. 

Not only is this place super clean, but it's decorated with awesome mini Bruce Lee action figures that compliment the Bruce Lee movie that's looped on a TV screen towards the back of the shop. I ordered the Coffee Milk Tea with boba and the 0%, sugar option, because I'm not a sweet fan at all, plus I figured the milk would add enough sweet flavor. By the way, the sugar options here go from 0% all the way to 120% for the serious sugar lover. 

This drink was perfect and I found myself wanting a second one! No burnt coffee flavor, plus the milk added just the perfect amount sweetness. The boba was plentiful and chewy, in that good chewy boba way. The drink paired perfectly with the free WiFi that I used to get some extra work done on one of the few tables they offer.

Customer service is inarguably top notch. Very friendly and has a ""we want you to like it"" attitude. Too sweet? Not sweet enough? You thought you knew what you wanted but really didn't? They got your back and greet you with a warm welcome and a warm goodbye. 

I don't know what the rest of LV bubble tea pricing looks like, but I was slightly surprised. I told the nice girl at the counter to surprise me, and even after a Yelp check-in for a free sinker (yeah!), my total was still almost $5. So I guess I was surprised. By the price tag. It was for a green honey oolong with milk or something. That was a little alarming. Tea tasted good though.

The other reason they lose a star is for the tapioca balls. I have this obsession that the balls have gotta be just right. Can't be mush in your mouth, which is the worst. But if the balls are hard, that sucks too since your jaw gets tired eventually during this entire process. And really, it shouldn't have to be that much work. They're pretty proud that their balls are made new every 2 hours, but even if they're fresh, they're made too hard!

Now, I usually don't like boba because it often tastes bland and gets in my way of enjoying the drink but Kung Fu's boba is fresh & sweet with just enough softness. I love it! The Oreo milk tea is also a great flavor combo, not super sweet as expected but just the right amount of milk tea and Oreos to give it that amazing taste. Another cool thing about Kung Fu is you can choose how sweet, how much ice, and how much milk you want in your drink and they have all types of level of sweetness from Extra to None at all. They really cater to you and that's awesome. 

If you ever want or need a boba fix this is the place to go! Lots of amazing flavor combo's and the staff is awesome. If I had more than two thumbs Id give it a billion thumbs up!",M6BoI78g1ul4XvBXF55p9g,0,0,5,CXVdrN0ptqdtPXzc1ff1Kw

I used to never come into the store so I had my sister pick me up a taro green tea (YES!) and I just relied on her haha
But I started going to the store myself because I'm just always craving their drinks. Dang it. 
Anyways, the inside is dim lighted with many oriental type of paintings and wall decorations. They even have Bruce Lee on the TV or just videos of people doing martial arts. 
What's very convenient is that the store has a chalk board on the right with the whole menu, a smaller menu on cards that customers can take with them, a TV with the menu, and a laminated menu right at the cash register. So hey, if one can't look at the wall menu because there's so many people, they have more than one option! 
So far, I've had the white gourd green tea, the green tea slush with red bean, the taro black tea, and the taro green tea. 
I've enjoyed all of them and there's nothing else I can say about this place. Thank you KFT and I'll be back soon!",C_CqWSkpn2aOnUXtHx0-iw,8,9,5,w_mBM4hcR-OKC9u6qa4Ikg

So much so that even when I drank most of the tea, my cup was still half full with toppings. I liked the tea. It had good flavor, but I found it too sweet. I didn't add any sugar, but all the sweetness from the pudding (and maybe boba) was too much for me. I also didn't like the white boba in the drink. I guess if you add bubble as a topping, it includes both the black and white balls. A friend ordered Chai Milk Tea: half sugar ($5), add Bubble ($0.50). He seemed to enjoy it.

I don't mind it but I don't think it's a smart business move if every one in your party wants to check in under one card transaction because that just encourages more credit card transactions, which will just accrue credit card fees.

Kung Fu's boba is good. It's chewy, and not overdone and mushy like many of the other places around here. Their drinks actually have tea flavor in them and not completely taken over by the flavor of milk or other sweeteners. They will also readily adjust your drink for you.

I really like their oolong milk tea and their white gourd green tea (also known as winter melon). But so far, I haven't really come across any drinks that I haven't liked.

It can get a little busy on the weekends, but they also do have some small tables if you wanna come study, and a few outlets underneath your seat, for laptops. Or just come to drink, chat, and watch random Asian-related shows on their TV (like Charlie's Angel, Jackie Chan movies, etc).

I guess its the Taiwanese in me but where ever I travel to I always seek out a local boba joint to satisfy my tea addiction, I mean you really can't ask me to settle for Starbucks tea right?   Kft Is new to Vegas but I've been to the ones in NY and was a fan so happily I was equally delighted with the tea at this Vegas location.  I got the Ulong milk tea with boba and it totally hit the spot on a typical ridiculously hot Vegas summer day.  Service was super friendly and decor was hip, especially liked the kung fu movie playing off a projector on the wall, nice touch!   
If you are picky about tea drinks like me then give this place a try.  The quality is far superior than Volcano and on par with Tea Station but at a 30% discount, really Tea Station?? You're prices are shameful!",jzRM1YIahBc4GGzvn-4wMQ,3,2,5,5blerYyqPCZfsXFJ5xeRDQ

The classic Kung Fu milk tea is perfectly sweetened as I asked for them to go easy on the sugar with ""less"" as the menu states.

The taro milk tea and hot ginger milk tea were good. Friends seemed to like this place as we went out of the way to go here on our Vegas visit. We got drinks to-go but there were a few wooden tables for twos and fours, with a mixture of visitors and locals.

Originally a California brand, Kung Fu finally branched out to Vegas just in time. They have a pretty decent selection of drinks, and a bunch of toppings. Staff is also very polite and will be happy to adjust your drink free of charge if it is not to your liking. 

Atmosphere is nice, and the kung fu videos playing in the background are a nice distraction if you're tired of staring at your phone or talking to your friends!

I tried the red wow milk which the woman taking our order said was the most popular item on the menu. It was good but I think the beans were a little odd. I came back a couple days later because I was at the ramen joint again! I got the wow milk this time. Which is the same minus the beans so it still has the boba. Boy was it delicious!

One of those times, my tea was just sitting there on the counter. I was sitting on the bench right next to where they hand out drinks and they failed to call my number. This was when they didn't have many people in the shop, so don't think it was because they were busy. I shouldnt have to wait 10 minutes for a drink if there wasnt a line upon entering. My last purchase was when i had a friend pick me up some tea. I ordered a milk cap oolong milk tea, but got green tea instead. It was NOT my friend's fault either because the sticker they print out with the order on it said ""OOLONG"". I didnt finish my drink and it was a waste of 5 bucks.

Also, i realize that their drinks are pricy. I compare them to other boba places in Vegas, and i pay the most for their's and its a smaller size. I dont know when the next time I'll come back, but their drinks are still made well and some (not all) of their staff is reliable.

The first thing I had ever ordered was a white gourd milk tea, with grass jelly-- bc I do not like the tapioca boba things. Their grass jelly is soooooo good. I could seriously eat it with just milk, lol. Then I tried some drinks off of my friends which were super delicious too. Mango snow (milk), because I don't like fruity things, this mango milk slush was gr8 with the mango jelly! My little sister got a peach oolong tea (first time I ever had oolong), it took a couple sips to get used to.. But now I'm inlove with this tea.

Like I said, I'm probably here every other day now. Even though it's quite a drive from my house, it is so worth it! Now I usually just always get white gourd milk tea with grass jelly. And my boyfriend gets the oolong oreo milk tea, with boba. All the time.

I tried the coffee flavors too, which were BOMB... But I don't wanna waste coffee flavors at a delicious TEA spot, you know. I also tried the strawberry milk slush, which I will never get LOL.

3520776,2016-08-14,0,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Kung Fu Tea is the boba franchise that Hilary Clinton tried when she was campaigning for the Presidency in New York Chinatown about 4 months ago (https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/hillary-clinton-tried-boba-for-the-first-time-and-called-it-chewy-tea). Hilary might love the ""chewy tea"", but I wasn't too impressed with my drink.

For those folks who have visited enough restaurants to somewhat know the general Vegas area, Kung Fu Tea is located in the same plaza as Raku and Monta Ramen. Parking can get a bit tough during the busy hours. Street parking is also an option, but the area feels a bit shady.

Free Wi-Fi is available and you get a free topping (e.g. boba) with the Yelp check in deal. All teas are brewed every 3 hours and boba is cooked every 2 hours. Most drinks you find here are drinks you can also find in the SGV (San Gabriel Valley - where hundreds of boba shops are located in the area) - milk teas, yogurts, espressos, slushes, fruity drinks, milk cap, etc. You can always ask the staff and adjust the sweetness level.

***.

White Gourd Tea (medium $2.75 + boba): It was basically a winter melon tea with milk. The drink was really sweet (regular sweetness), so I asked the staff to adjust the sweetness level to 50%. Funny ... it still tasted somewhat sweet after the adjustment. You'll need to shake the drink well before you actually drink it. Boba was medicore.

***

3-star (A-OK) using the strict SGV boba standards. I probably ordered the wrong drink and I'll still give some benefit of the doubt. If you want some SGV quality drinks in Vegas, Brew Tea Bar (pretty far away from the Strip, but worth a side visit) is the place to go. If you want a quick boba fix and don't want to drive to far, then I guess feel free to give Kung Fu Tea a try (much closer from the Strip).",rQLEfpfSjVK-3dBmIMKZDA,0,0,3,GwE6H_0vbV3Qi5TwiatdjQ

I've been here a couple of times (kind of embarrassed to admit how many times exactly, but that should give you an idea lol) and the workers are always nice. They also give you a sample of their tea drinks which is pretty neat because you never know when you will come across a flavor that you like!

My standard drink is the Jasmine green milk tea and I have to say that they do a good job of making it here. You'd think it'd be hard to mess up a milk tea drink, but trust me, it is possible and has been done lol. The drink itself was not diluted to the point where it is noticeable and the tea is pretty good. I've also had the white gourd milk tea (sounds weird, but it's good!), taro green milk tea, and some others. I haven't had a bad experience with a drink yet, and the workers are even willing to make any necessary adjustments! Also, you can adjust the amount of sweetness (aka sugar) in your drink while you are ordering so be sure to do that if you need to. 

Give this place a shot because it is way better than some other places in the Vegas area. Be sure to check in to use the free topping deal (use it to get boba!!!). I would go here so much more often if it wasn't located all the way in Chinatown :(.

It has become such a popular spot that customers are crammed in the small space between the cash register and the door at any given time of the day. I almost dislike coming here just because of how crowded it is, but I do anyways, because I was raised better than to snub good tea.

The price for a tea ranges from $4 to $7 depending on what cup size and how many toppings customers choose. Orders are processed using a mobile tablet. 
The staff here are young, friendly and efficient. I've only once had an issue with one of my orders where the person taking my order misheard it, but then I halfheartedly verified my order when he repeated it, so that's my bad. Plus the tea was delicious in the end. 

The interior of Kung Fu Tea would actually be quite cozy if it weren't for the crowds of people here all the time. There is a TV on the wall playing clips from kung fu movies appropriate for the shop's name, and there are some tables and benches that customers can sit down at to talk. Because of the small space and the limited seating options, most people get their tea to go. 

To-go orders are super convenient and trouble-free, as staff bag customers' orders and supply more than enough napkins and straws with each order. I love that the tea cups are sealed here, so I don't have to worry about spilling any tea when I deliver it to my friends and family.

Overall, I like this place for the tea, but not so much for the atmosphere anymore. It's just a little bit too hectic for me. Of course, that's not the business' fault, so it's still 5 stars.",lYdIJrjX-QgOhQfsvTQlOg,2,1,5,vPCYC8P2Ykg06HITJfE3Uw

ATMOSPHERE:

Cramped hipster spot in an already cramped strip mall in C-Town serving up some tasty boba concoctions that you can have customized your way...or can you? Kung Fu clips are constantly playing, hence the name, but when it gets busy, a line goes out the door, the entrance which is also the exit is obstructed which wouldn't make the Fire Marshall happy.

BEVERAGES:

Having been here a couple of times, I've tried their Taro boba smoothie and on our second visit, I noticed that they also had a Matcha smoothie. I LOVE the two flavors blended together, so since they had the two flavors, and I was willing to pay, I asked if they could blend the two together, but the girl told me they don't do that, (you have the two flavors, I was willing to pay extra...WTH? Made me wanna get all 5 Deadly Venoms up in here!!!!) Anywho,  I settled for a Strawberry Milk Boba smoothie which was good, but not what I wanted. I guess places don't like to deviate from their menu items but maybe I should've asked the guy who actually makes the drinks if he'd do it...better yet, why not offer to have flavors blended since you already give options like toppings and sweetness levels! Their boba is also firmer than usual, but still good. Although they have a good variety to choose from, I also wish they would offer a bigger size, like 32 ounces.

CLOSING STATEMENTS:

This is a good place, but I'll probably stick to my favorite spots where they'll be able to make my favorite boba smoothie blend with no problem.  ALOHA!!!

Kung Fu is good. Peach Oolong, less sweet, nata jelly.

The story:

Kung Fu Tea is no doubt the dojo that causes all other drink places in Chinatown to quiver in the pants or gi. It is incredibly consistent, a wide variety that can appeal to the white belts and even the black belts. Don't underestimate Kung Fu Tea because its a franchise. They aren't some karate for kids lames where you can buy all your ingredients from your wholesaler upfront, mix it and expect it to taste good. Kung Fu undoubtedly was the first to give you choices, and not just drink choices, but how much ice or how much sweetness type of choices. The free topping with just checking in on Yelp, entitling you to a various toppings (nata jelly da best). 

Although I do have to admit my allegiance is to another dojo (which is not hard if figure out if you look at my check ins) in a land far away but there are certain aspects of KFT that keeps me coming back occasionally (besides the cute cashier). 

1. They use lactose free milk. I can enjoy milk tea without regret!
2. They're open later (11/12pm usually)
3. Workers are always happy
4. The shaker machine makes a world of difference keeping drinks consistent
5. The area is convenient. Whether I'm eating here, coming from work or school, its a quick detour away.
6. Adding KFT into my palette artillery will help me diversify and better at MMA.  Many Mmms and Ahhs. 

Do note that it's pretty small in here, and constantly busy, so if you plan on studying or doing any work, but need a distraction free zone, this is not the place.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,5,2,4,nmQtft5xFytdXLHdVybT8Q

3622921,2014-08-29,9,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Alright after 4 consecutive visits, I think it's about time I gave this place the credit it deserves. 

Kung Fu Tea has been on my foodie to do for a couple of weeks now because there's just so much buzz over it on Yelp with all these 5 star reviews, and I can see why now! Literally 2 doors down from the original Monta, this small-scale boba house could seat about 12 people total - 4 or 5 tiny tables and a bench by the entrance that pretty much serves as the waiting area. 

My first impression was that there was just so many options on the menu and a little overwhelming, but as you come here 4 times in a row like I did, it becomes simpler each time you look over it. Okay Instant Like #1: they offer lactaid options. I don't have a problem with milk, but my bf definitely does and it was nice to see he could finally enjoy a milk tea without feeling sick. Like #2: you have options of sugar levels (70% less, 50% less, 30% less, and none) so you don't have to worry if they make it too sweet and be stuck in a situation where you either have to stick with it if it is, or ask them awkwardly to re-make it. Which leads me to Instant Like #3: They'll happily re-make your drink if you're not satisfied, in fact, they ask you to let them know if you'd like to make any changes while they hand the drink over. Last but most definitely not the least, Instant Like #4 RED BEAN AND HERBAL JELLY TOPPING? Um hi, I'll be loyal to you forever, because I don't know anywhere else that offers this.

Great atmosphere, wonderful customer service, and of course, tasty drinks. You can't go wrong with that combo.

As for my drink of choice, I can't get enough of the Matcha Milk Tea with herbal jelly topping, or red bean topping. They let me sample their White Gourd Green Tea (and they'll let you sample it as well if you ask!) and it was bomb too.",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,14,13,5,rYlAdUrsrBDgm4S-hFRgtA

3641144,2015-10-14,0,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"I'm a big fan of boba tea and KFtea is by far my favorite boba place at Las Vegas!

Service/Environment: The shop is always busy and loud. However, the employees are really attentive and friendly. They always help me out when I have a hard time deciding what to drink. Plus, they always give out free samples of their drink of the day, which is a bonus! 

Menu and Drinks: They have an extensive menu. My favorite drinks are oreo oolong milk tea with half boba half herbal jelly and herbal jelly wow milk. I've tried most of their milk teas and all are amazing. Sometimes I'll ask for less sugar and less milk when I don't want that much calories. Oh I also recommend chai milk (a milk tea with lactase-free milk instead of milk creamer) for the people who don't like the creaminess of regular milk teas. 
If I'm craving for something refreshing, I always go for yogurt green tea and grapefruit green tea. 

Overall: In my opinion, what makes KFtea stand out in Vegas is that they emphasize their quality of drinks. The teas are fresh, honey boba and herbal jelly are freshly made in house. Last but not least, they are always willing to adjust the drinks for you if you don't like it!",m72viQ5BX0dgfMsfPR8AKQ,2,2,5,dVYosafQYbdWw8IECtUWKw

Pros:
* They greet you when you walk in & walk out
* All of our drinks tasted good
* You can customize the sugar, temperature, and ice level for your drinks

Cons:
* They took the big trash can from the kitchen out through the front (walking through the store & right in front of customers) rather than taking it out through the back. This is a major no-no for me & quite disgusting
* They don't have honey dew flavor.. at all! That's a standard flavor that I was surprised they didn't have
* Small store w/ about 5 tables, so it's very crowded when they're busy

Overall, we had an okay experience & I decided to give them 3 stars for their product. However, the throwing of the trash really turned me off (making me wonder what other health code regulations they violate).",Kq_Cg-INSv4i8wNo1kDF-w,1,1,3,07Ewo9xUYTruT8jDWbt9tA

3652378,2015-08-17,1,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Kung Fu Tea is a new addiction of mine, and honestly, the only thing I plan on doing about this addiction is satisfying my craving as often as possible.

Seriously, my wife and I are now making excuses for why it makes sense to drive across town for a cup of tea.  We now plan our days off together around the inevitable trip to Kung Fu.

It's a charming little shop tucked away in a busy shopping center.  If you've read a few reviews, you've probably gathered by now that parking can be tricky at times, and a line is to be expected.  These are both very true, but please don't let that stop you from coming.  You will find parking before long, and the line, in my opinion, adds to the electifying energy of the place.  It moves quickly and gives you a chance to observe what other Kung Fu Tea fans order.  You will also likely need to utilize the brief wait time to pour over the rather extensive menu.

There are a variety of coffees, teas, slushes, and much more to choose from.  In addition to this, Kung Fu allows you full control over your drink, making it one of the most customizable beverage spots I've ever experienced.  You decide your ideal sweetness on a scale of zero sweet to very sweet. You can get your drink hot, iced, or turned into a slushie.  You also have the option to add Boba to it, of course.

They truly have something for everyone.  I've always enjoyed taking my wife to places like this because she really likes boba drinks.  It's weird, but I've often wished that I could develop a taste for them so I could enjoy them with her.  Kung Fu Tea has such a robust menu, that even I was able to find a drink to call my own. All juices are juiced fresh on the premises, which I find pretty impressive.  My go-to is Iced Grapefruit Green Tea with zero sweetener.    I don't like things too sweet so I really appreciate this option. The tea tastes wonderful and the grapefruit offers just enough natural sweetness along with the bitter notes to make it a perfect refreshment for me.  It might not sound good to you, but this is just example of how anyone could likely find a beverage to love at Kung Fu Tea.

When it's not too busy, Kung Fu is the perfect spot to relax in the A/C and enjoy some good conversation with your family and friends.  I like the steet-style art and decor on the walls and the place is always clean.  It's quite small, with only a few tables, but if you can get here during a slow moment, it really is a nice place to kick back. 

The staff is super friendly and positive.. Always helpful and understanding, even with sometimes difficult orders and long lines.

I really can't say enough good things about this place, so maybe you should just stop reading my review and go try it out.  Unless you're at Kung Fu Tea already, enjoying their free WIFI and a cold drink, then by all means, read on, and let me know if you found any of my nonsense helpful.",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,2,2,5,77rKUJLbeBoOM_GEbCof6Q

One thing I have noticed is that most of the drinks are too sweet. However, you can ask for less or half the amount of sugar they put into your drink. I always go for less = 70%. Aside from the beverages, Kung Fu Tea provides a chill, good vibes-like lounge which I find a perfect place  to hangout and  enjoy your tea.",0Qku9zA5ytwzH6dYt2cg8Q,3,3,5,wv0WlyV05BXmlYYoO3uTMA

Happy to see that they opened one up right by my work. Medium iced oolong milk tea w/ half bubbles/grass jelly, half sweet, no ice. Get the ice if you want to have a battle between the bubbles and the straw towards the end of your drink. I prefer to get every bit of it!

I had to come here, I just had to :P I was going to make my way here regardless on my recent LV trip. We came here on our first day after getting lunch on Jones and realized that this place was in a plaza that wasn't too too pops. Yeah no. It has Monta Ramen (I think that's the name) which supposedly has one of the better ramen places in Vegas. And it has cheap Big Wong Restaurant (which I wasn't a fan of). Regardless, they had a line. A very long line. Which came after we stepped into Kung Fu Tea!

So here you can get sweetness and ice levels specified here. That's to mention before I forget :P Cuz I probably will forget.

Anywho, the guy realized that we were out of towners or first time noobs. Maybe because I asked ""What was popular"". Wait. Why did I ask that? I had Yelp already. Well it's okay, you should ask what's popular as a great way for them to tell you what THEY know it's popular, because they work there and all.

White Gourd Tea. I believe that was a winter melon. Now never would I have been like ""oh eyo, white gourd sounds good, lemme try it"". No lol. I'd be like why? But since Yelp had said it, I tried it. It's the perfect sweetness and I don't really have a specific taste in how it is lol. It's... different. It's nothing that you would expect winter melon to really taste like :P It's good. Trust me. :) It's...light.

Mango Slush? It had a different name, but they gave us a sample for it and it was LEGIT. It is a slush and more of a thicker drink, but their mango has an amazing taste, it really does. I got the sample and thought there was condensed milk in there or something, it's sweet and nice. Ermagawd I want this now.

Matcha Red Bean Slush - Ummm I don't really know what to say about this. The matcha was a bit weaker than I expected but their red bean was legit. It's like they make it themselves rather than use it out of the can. It tastes fresh. The slush? You have to let it melt. If you like red bean, get this! If not, try the mango slush.

KF Milk Green Tea- I saved this all the way to Primm! Yes there's a lot of traffic but this drink made it all the way to Primm :P They have really great flavor and it's refreshing. It may make you wanna pee near stateline but it's the perfect sweetness, the perfect flavor, cool, and suave. :)

Oreo Milk tea- if you like oreos, try it. I wasn't too keen on it. It tasted way too watery (so I guess I only like oreo milkshakes or slushes) :/ 

Check in on Yelp for a Free Topping!

*ANOTHER TIP* You can get HALF AND HALF for toppings! You can get half boba half egg pudding, etc, etc.

Their boba also has honey on the outside. Why? I can taste it. Boba is bad for you but KF's is so good. Their boba apparently is supposed to melt slowly in your drink :P

Yeah, we came twice in two days lol.

Lactaid-based milk drinks create an awesome flavor and calms my lactose-sensitive gut. I love that you're able to customize the sweetness, especially since the black and clear-colored boba provides some sweetness already. Try the Oreo wow milk or Oreo oolong milk tea as it provides unique flavors to drinks not found at any other tea house. 

Pudding, jellies, and boba are just a few of your toppings options. There are even samples when you walk in the door, followed by a loud greeting upon opening. During the fall season, try the pumpkin. You won't regret it!

The workers are always so kind and make you feel welcomed to their store. They are also willing to fix your order if you're not satisfied. The price is fantastic since most boba places are over $5 while at KFT, its under $5 per drink.

One of my gfs is pregnant and she really wants like a chocolate slushie but they didn't have one on the menu and most tea places aren't caffeine free. So they actually decided to recreate their Italian mocha caffeine free...it was great! The guy made it the first time and she tried it, but the chocolate flavor she's been craving wasn't too strong, so he made another one and he let me, her, and our gf taste it too. It was PERFECT and noncaffeinated! It was perfect that they were able to accommodate my friend's situation. My fave drink there is the white gourd milk tea (wintermelon), the potency of the flavor is stronger than most places I've had and it wasn't too sweet. It was just perfect...it had that aftertaste that you'd want after drinking wintermelon. I definitely recommend. 

Con: parking is terrible. The lot is so small and always packed. It's difficult to get any parking there. I wish they had another location in north vegas. :)",P7dy3DYO4D5-syzv-6S-Aw,3,3,5,ldFycpqnEw5Rpho1PeK2Mg

Service is great and the people there are welcoming and always offering to make any changes to your drink if needed. One time I came in right before closing and apologized for it, but they didnt make it seem like a big deal despite me getting a hot drink. Also the drinks come in pretty fast. Order something, sit down, tune out at the TV constantly playing kung fu clips, and the next thing you know your drink is ready. Happens to me all the time.

Environment is neat. They have cool stencil art all over the place thats also for sale for a somewhat large price. I mean stencil art is neat, but you can easily recreate it and even mass produce the piece, but thats beside the point of this cafe. The place is usually quiet since most people come in, order, get their shit, and leave; so its a nice place just to chill out in. Although if you come here during a rush, which happens often here, its obviously gonna get loud due to its small seating area and your drink may take a bit more time. Also their bathroom is pretty dang neat.

Go here after you eat dinner in the area. Its the perfect way to top it off. Sometimes theyll give out samples. Its how I fell in love with the white gourd tea. They also have this chalkboard stand outside with pretty clever notes on it that made me physically put out a ""heh. Nice.""

Pros: Amazing drinks, amazing boba, fast service, comfortable, and great prices

Cons: uhh... the over priced stencil art, but this doesnt affect anything at all. Oh yeah and their hot drinks only come in one size, so youre unable to get a bucket of hot tea here which blows.",xS4eeHlnIyGdyo2qnI9d4Q,0,1,5,cr79INlRaSlrM6sbzbG0BQ

It had the same texture as the lychee but the taste did not replace the greatness of true lychee

To be honest, I felt like it made my milk tea taste kind of like bananas and milk. A lot of my friends and family love this place.

Parking is difficult but you can always park on the side street next to the plaza or at the church next door (even though you're technically not supposed to). 

Drinks are great - they have plenty of milk teas and toppings to choose from. A recent fav of mine for the summertime is the Pomelo Tea w/ Fig Jelly - super refreshing & light! Pro tip: have them remove the citrus pieces from the drink.

Service is good - they always offer to remake your drink if there's any issues.  

Atmosphere is interesting - random kung fu videos looping on a large TV in the back... sometimes the footage gets a tad too bloody from a kung fu fight which makes it a little odd to watch while drinking boba.

With the aforementioned facts in mind, there is nothing wrong with Kung Fu tea. I guess I had high expectations based on the YELP ratings. IMHO KFT just does not live up to the outstanding 4.5 stars it received as of this review.  The staff was enthusiastic and friendly. The location was fine, in a strip mall with a few other Asian restaurants. I ordered a Large Jasmine Green Tea with pearls a regular sweetness (100% sweetness). 

There was no wait, so my drink came out quickly. The tea itself was very strong...almost tasted like a black tea...very overpowering, not how a  Jasmine tea is suppose to taste. It was also not sweet enough, even though it was suppose to be a 100%. Tasted more like a 70%...the strong taste of the tea overpowered the sweetness. Then there were the pearls...they were on the firmer side...like they were a bit stale or were sitting around a tad longer that they should have been.

Yes I understand it's possible to have it fixed but then again I don't have time to waste waiting for my drink to be fixed when it could've been made right the first time.

Drinks are good. In particular, I really like the nata (pineapple/coconut) jelly option! Some other places have a cheap version that feels rubbery and tasteless, but this one is higher quality and goes well with any drink. You can tell the ingredients are better here (versus many other places where you can tell it's just water and a scoop of colored powder). I like how you can customize the amount of sugar - especially since sometimes I'm on a diet and sometimes (most days) I give myself a free pass. 

Special mention for being innovative and offering dairy-free drinks, as I've never seen this offered for boba before. Many of my friends are lactose-intolerant, so it's a wonder nobody thought of this before.

The passion fruit green tea, Oreo milk tea and the lychee punches are delicious. you can alter sweetness, ice and the milk levels. Once you stare at their tv with the king fu movies you can't take your eyes off it. Even though the tea is mouthwatering that is not the best thing. The thing that puts them to my favorite bubble tea place is because of the delicoussssssssss boba. I mean it was sooooooooo gooooddddddd that I get double boba. Very chewy and a little touch of sweetness. Also if you check in you can get free boba or other topping for 50 cents off. I highly recommend this spot. One thing that can be improved is maybe bigger space and another line because it always has a long line and the place is packed but you can't blame them because the tea is so good. The tea and boba is definitely a 5 star but I'm giving a 2 star because of the service. They were so rude they wouldn't let me get one 50 cent side of boba. I asked what the lychee punch was since I never had it even though it was good they treated me horrible they said it's a ""lychee drink"" I mean duhhhh and when I asked for extra sugar more milk less ice they threw me an attitude saying anything more?? With a attitude voice. I probably won't come here again even though the tea is good just because of the service. And that's not all when I asked where's the boba straws even though they were in front of me they said "" are u blind"" I was so pissed off.

4052476,2014-09-03,5,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Las Vegas has a ton of places to get boba.  In my opinion, Kung Fu Tea is just another one of those places. The place is small, it can get congested, and the register is located just a few feet from the door.  What does all this mean?  Well, if you are undecided on what to get and there's people beginning to crowd behind you, then it can get overwhelming and you may end up just getting whatever.  However, I don't care about the people behind me and I really don't have a problem taking my time.  But I admit...I was overwhelmed with their menu and the different options. You can get your boba with ice, no ice, with slush, and warm.  You can also have it sweet, not sweet, slightly sweet, super sweet, or with no changes at all.   I ordered the Red Wow Milk, which had boba and red bean in it.  Be prepared to know your options when it's time to order because my cashier in her robotic ways asked me all of them. Do you want it sweeten?  Do you want it warm? Do you want ice? Okay, how much ice? Really? At this point, I just wanted my milk tea.  I ended up pointing at the picture and said ""just give me exactly what the picture looks like"". My goodness...this was the hardest boba order I ever had to make.  Once you get passed ordering and paying, you'll finally get your drink.  My Red Wow Milk Tea was good and the boba was cooked just right. I thought that the red bean gave my drink more texture and flavor.  Yup...I'm a fan of red bean.  My only complaint is that most of my drink had big pieces of ice in it which also means I got very little milk tea.  Just 3 or 4 slurps and my drink was done, deMelished, finito.  I guess this is what I get for failing to tell them exactly how I wanted my drink.  Oh well, lesson learned.  

Overall, I don't see myself going out of my way for boba or milk tea here.  I admit, the Red Wow Milk Tea was pretty good and if I am right in their parking lot craving some boba, I would come back.  However, their Red Wow Milk Tea didn't wow me when it came to portions.  A lot of taste and very little drink equals 3 stars from me.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,6,5,3,uYgPAdHC1iCfOxUFg7urig

There's all these unique paintings on the wall that look super artsy with price tags on them. I felt like I was in an art gallery (although I don't dabble in that world so how that truly feels, I don't know first-hand). After ordering our typical Taro Milk and Oreo Milk (okay, that's not typical for the boys, but the option was there so they took it) Teas, we sat down in front of the big screen playing various Karate/Kung Fu (hence the name) clips.  We saw footage of the young Jackie Chan doing what he does best in a ""grab the dumpling"" scene we're pretty sure Kung Fu Panda was inspired from. As we were laughing & enjoying ourselves, we heard the call that our Boba was done. So, we poked our handy dandy Boba cups (I feel like there should be some kind of drum intro anticipating that first sip) and I LOVED it! The Boba's were perfect! The more you chewed, the more the flavored popped...nice chewy consistency and a biting sweetness.  The Taro milk tea itself was not as sweet as I like it, but they actually had the option to adjust the flavor.  I was never asked that before so it was new to me. Next time, and God willing, there will be a next time (please still be here next year when we visit), I will ask for a sweeter formula.

Prompted by the endless flood of positive ratings (including Antonia R.'s glowing reviews), and latching on to my friends' curiosity about the new kid in town, I made a return visit to see whether Kung Fu Tea had changed since my first visit during their opening weekend. In short, they have improved.

Some of the noticeable improvements had nothing to do with the tea. In addition to their chalkboard, they have two other ways of displaying their menu now: (1) a pretty large LCD menu hanging over the counter, and (2) a detailed, professional, folding business card. Their TV in the back is also working and has a YouTube playlist filled with clips ranging from kung fu movies to a dog trying to fight a cat (yeah, I have no idea either).

I went with Antonia's recommendation of the golden oolong milk tea w/ boba (and asked for less ice). I think it was actually filled to the top even with less ice being present. It had noticeable tea flavor, medium sweetness even with full sugar, and none of the extra milky weirdness that was present in the milk tea from last time (although Antonia's review does make me wonder if what I had was the sweetness leeching out from the boba). I also sampled my friend's sunshine pineapple tea, which actually had zero added sugar, and it was still a little sweet with a balanced tea and pineapple flavor.

There's so many other established tea places that I haven't fully explored, but I will be back here when it's convenient. The differences are that I will be eager instead of reluctant, and I might drive across the street or down a couple of blocks instead of only limiting myself to following up a meal at Japanese Curry Zen or Big Wong.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,4,4,1y-En8bc2pHKYZ9QJH11hw

I understand places run out of boba at times but when you know you're going to be busy, especially during lunch and dinner times MAKE MORE! -_- especially since your a boba shop.
They messed up my drink twice in the same visit, and my boyfriend went back to have them get it right and it was still wrong. I understand sometimes the different workers may do things different but at least keep it somewhat consistent. The first time was WAAAAAY too sweet, second was just water...I just paid $3 something for WATER, okay so third was again too sweet. *sigh* maybe I was overly picky or it was they're off day. 
They also don't allow you to truly customize drinks, like adding certain flavors. It's probably because all the employees just learn it from a book. Mehh.

The workers are always so helpful when I am not too sure what I want to order.  They make their boba fresh every 2 hours and it is probably the best I've ever had in Las Vegas.  Definitely stick with their milk teas.  I have never been disappointed with them.  The fruit slush like the mango one you should pass on.  The place itself is pretty small with minimal seating, but nice decor.  They also stream kung fu videos on their TV!

Maybe because out of the two times I went there, it was always later in the evening (the best time for boba is late night), but it seemed like there was almost always a line.
I can't really tell you too much on their menu, because I haven't tried too many options, but I must recommend their mango snow slush. I will forever get this drink. It's a mango slushie with milk and mango jelly. And I love their mango jelly. My friend got the one of their milk bobas, which was also yummy. Their boba alone has the perfect amount of chewy-ness and sweetness btw. I was also able to try a brown sugar and milk boba when I took my cousins here. I don't think it was on the menu, but the fact that they were willing to accommodate her request, AND make it delicious just already puts them at the top.

The tea was perfectly sweetened and the boba had a slight honey taste to it-very yummy! They even gave us a sampling of their herbal jelly to try-- which was also delicious and I will have to add that to my drink next time.

The decor was super fun with miniature martial art characters lining their ""kitchen"" and the art work showcased was very cool and for sale. Wonder if they're from a local artist?

They are always busy. I've never gone into an empty store, which is great. The atmosphere is very Bruce Lee-inspired. There is always a Bruce Lee movie playing on the back TV. There are a few pieces of art on the walls that are of him, as well. I think you can even buy little cartoon figurines of him. Other than that, there is a lot of wall art by local artists that are for sale. Beautiful pieces! 

I always order the Wintermelon Milk Green Tea. I believe it's their most popular drink. It's really good. You have the option to choose the sweetness level and adjust ice amounts. If you check-in on Yelp, you also get a free topping. Can't go wrong with boba. 

They also sell Cravory Cookies in a variety of different flavors. I get a cookie with my boba every time. I believe the cookies come from California. They're super good!

Which decrease the delish tea taste, and their tea is good - brewed ""every 3 hrs"". 

Need a stamp card. 

Need more specifics on pricing and extras. To decrease confusion each time is a diff price. 

Menu is overwhelming yet pretty straight forward. Know what u want and they will make it.

Stop offering to ""make adjustment"" to every drink - because instead of making the adjustment, we are talked out of it with statements ""it's how it's made."" ""It comes like that"" ""next time order ...."". ""It's busy right now, so next time..""

I never know where or what constitutes a good Boba place- I guess I usually just choose by the number of Asian people I see at the business or mostly I just follow my girl blindly into whatever boba place she wants to go to. I guess we were 2 for 2 on that end. Tons of people ( not just Asian) although about 88% were. The place is small and they play kung fu movies which is bad ass. 

I went with my safe choice of milk tea with boba. 30% sweetness which you can add more or none at all. The boba was chewy and cooked well and they were sweet. The tea itself wasn't too sweet and it was refreshing even though it was a million degrees outside. Everyone in my group seemed happy with their drinks. 

My girl got oolong milk tea with boba and grass jelly - her sister got white gourd green milk tea with egg pudding and her bro got the white gourd green tea ( no milk) apparently there is a difference.

Oolong milk tea with boba ($4 large)
Green tea ($2.75) medium)
Green milk tea ($3.25 medium)

All were bland. I'm aware that drinks here aren't as sweet as other boba shops, but they didn't even taste like tea; more like watered down tea. Super disappointed. Boba also hardened within 5 minutes which is gross... Eventually it just tastes like undercooked boba. Yuck!

If you are Lactose Intolerant or sometimes Milk is your enemy, luckily Kung Fu Tea uses Non-Dairy creamer and Lactose Free Milk.

Choose your drink (Thank you for the caffeine free mark!!!!! If you're sensitive to caffeine and it's 9PM watch out! Most of their drinks have caffeine!) Choose sweetness, choose toppings (free topping with Yelp check in!) and if you want ice. 
Milk tea is good, but I've had better elsewhere. 
Their yogurt drinks (made with Yakult) are my favorite from Kung Fu. Yakult is a probiotic drink made in Japan. They describe it as having a coconut taste, but it really doesn't. I HATE coconut, but love Yakult! 
Lemonade Yogurt was so so good. A lot heavier on the Yakult than the lemonade.

The main criteria to evaluate a boba joint for me is their classic milk tea with boba, no fancy flavors, no slushy mess. Their regular milk tea was pretty good, but it surprisingly had a jasmine-like spicy flavor, unexpected in a black tea and more characteristic of a green tea. Not bad, just not what I bargained for when I ordered a classic milk tea. The Boba was fairly fresh, chewy and flavorful (honey taste).",XQ_nFlUasT_NYksIHDP-kA,2,2,3,4mg2viSKJcX7FSndsWHteA

The version here at Kung Fu Tea is pretty decent. 4 stars just for their herbal jelly alone. However, I felt like their teas could use, well, more tea? Or at least less milk so that the earthy flavor of green tea/matcha could come through.

The space is small and cute. I wouldn't ever expect to sit down and sip tea here, as the tables are always full of people playing card games or chit-chatting. The waiting area is small too so there's usually a line out the door or gang of people waiting outside during their busy periods.

Considering how long the wait is, I would prefer to go elsewhere without such a long line all the time. Yes, they are still just as accommodating with your drinks, but it's just too busy and long a wait for me. I would not write them off though.

The game changer and Kung Fu is that you can customize your drink however you like it. Any amount of sweetness, ice, and extra trimmings can be customized. They also adjust things afterwards if your drink isn't made to your liking. 

The only thing I ever get here is their White Gourd Green Milk Tea, less sweet with egg pudding. It's the perfect drink for those who don't like things overly sweet. If you like winter melon milk tea, I learned from the workers there that winter melon and white gourd are the same thing! Crazy, right?! 

It's a small boba shop, but it has a lot of personality. They always have Bruce Lee movies playing on the tv, cute little Kung Fu figurines around the store, and if you're lucky enough to snag a table, I see groups of people playing games.",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,5,5,4,90B8Msopo-7BHB0EqbRYSQ

This place always seemed packed, which is a good sign I suppose. My friends and I, a group of 7, went after dinner on a Friday evening around 9pm and the line was pretty much out the door with no seats. Even with the rush of people, my drink was made fairly quickly. The room itself isn't that big so we had to snag the first table we saw. 

Hot drinks are only available in one size -- the large. It was a lot to drink. I couldn't finish it. I wish they offer hot drinks in a slightly smaller size. 

The KF oolong milk tea is very good. This place makes it on the milkier side by default which I really enjoy! This place also offers lactaid for those who want a non-dairy choice. 

I've also had the coconut milk tea and almond milk tea and didn't quite like it despite how I like both drinks. It just wasn't my cup of tea (ha ha ha..). 

Anyway, i'll be back to try more things! It's a great place for people to just ""hang out"" and have boba.  Don't forget to check in for a free topping! I love the boba with hot milk tea here... So perfect for the winter!

4405813,2017-01-15,5,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"I think this is the first time I ever gave a one-star review to an overly-hyped boba shop. But this is also the first time I ever gave up on finishing an order of milk tea. Normally, I can drink a boba milk tea within 10 minutes of receiving it. The oreo oolong milk tea that I got from Kung Fu Tea, however, sat around from 3pm to around 3am before I finally convinced my friend to finish it after becoming dehydrated from a night of partying. She didn't even like it when she first tried it with me and only gave in after not having anything else around to quench her thirst. That's how disgusting it tasted. None of us boba lovers wanted any of it. 

Furthermore, bogus charges. They had ""Oreo Oolong Milk Tea"" listed as one of their flavored milk tea options and so I assumed it was the same listed price as all the other flavored milk tea drinks, because, you know, that's how every other boba shop does it. But surprise! I find out on my receipt that they charge you an extra 50 cents for some crumbles of an oreo cookie without telling you. So out of curiosity, I asked the cashier why I was charged extra when I've never been charged extra for the ""caramel"" in caramel milk teas or the ""taro"" in taro milk teas anywhere else. And she said that the ""free oreo button was broken on the ipad."" So I asked, ""Oh, so if I were to get Taro Milk Tea, the taro would've been free and only oreo isn't free?"" And she simply says yes. Strangely enough, Oreos aren't even an option from the additional toppings list, so why do they have a ""50 cents for oreos"" option but not a ""free oreos"" option when it's not even a topping? I honestly didn't even care about the 50 cents, I just think this is the dumbest excuse of a boba shop I've ever heard. Don't HIDE random bogus fees and then make up dumb reasons...

Since moving here 2 months ago, the service at most places I've dined/drank at were SOUR. I honestly wonder what climbed up these people's asses 'cause it seems like the best service is exclusively on the strip.

The women at Kung Fu Tea were so friendly and polite and they made up for all the bad service I've gotten lately. There were people in front of me ordering and they all stopped what they were doing for a second and acknowledged our presence. Manners are RARE nowadays and I think if a staff can remain inviting (like you're not a nuisance) when it's busy is VALUABLE; they know what true customer service is!

I ordered an iced coffee with herbal jelly and my partner got a taro slush. Right when she handed it, the boba chick said to let them know if we need any modifications if it's not delightful to our tongue. I honestly thought my drink lacked sweetness but their EXCELLENT service didn't leave a bad taste on my tongue that I didn't even wanna bother and be a TOTAL DIVA to the super nice staff. 

Additionally, the price wasn't bad at all and is the same as any boba place. The whole place is clean and looks hip with the modern artwork and Kung Fu film scenes on the TV.

While many other boba places have a very standard sweet milk tea taste, Kung Fu tea's Oolong milk tea at their normal sugar level tastes refreshing! It's not overly sweet. 

In fact, the reason why I love Kung Fu Tea so much is because, after each sip, there's a lingering taste of Oolong! It's almost slightly (veryyyyyyy slightly) bitter tasting because of the tea, but the creaminess of the milk tea helps balance the Oolong tea oh so well! I also get mine with grass jelly (yummmmm since it's free with a yelp check in! plus, they aren't stingy with it! I get almost a good half cup of it)!!

This isn't really a great place to study since there's constantly foot traffic, and the machines and shakers do get loud at times so it's hard to concentrate or socialize. Cute decor and place.

The place itself was very small, but the artwork was super cool and have you plenty of art eye candy.  They are lucky they weren't shorted one of their elephant pictures, because I was sure eyeing them. ;)",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,3,2,5,-IKp4Y_c5MCCpX9tDP1ZDw

My go to is Peach Oolong, little sweet, less ice w/ Herbal jelly.  If you are an active member in Yelp, you would know that when you check in you can get your free topping.

However, our teas left a little to be desired. I think I would rate 3 stars for the actual drinks, 5 stars for the tea quality, and 5 stars for the service = 3.5 stars overall. 

We had the milk black tea and milk oolong tea. We chose 70% sugar, so it was not very sweet. I felt like that took away from being able to taste the flavor or the tea, because the drink tasted more diluted. I would definitely recommend just doing normal sugar, since their drinks are not too sweet. 

The tea leaves taste of high quality. Perhaps too high for us... the oolong is very woodsy and smoky, so you definitely have to really like oolong. The black tea has bergamot oil in it, so it tastes more floral. I thought it was nice, but my friend and bf thought it tasted soapy.

In addition to choosing your drink, you can modify its sugar content, from zero sugar to making it more sweet (if you choose wrong, they'll remake it to your liking!).  You can choose to add a topping (even though it sits at the bottom of the cup; it should be a bottoming) as well, including boba, herbal jelly, and different beans.  My go to drink is their White Gourd Green Tea, less sweet, with either boba or jelly.

Outside of their great drinks and service, they follow through with their name and have many figurines based on characters from Kung Fu movies sitting throughout the store, and they are also available for purchase.

4856664,2017-02-23,0,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Kung Fu Tea is one of the best and most consistent boba shops in all of Chinatown. 

KFT is located in a little plaza next to a few restaurants (KBBQ, Ramen, Sushi, Curry, etc.), so getting your boba fix after eating at these restaurants is a must. You will not be disappointed. 

As soon as you walk in, the employees are friendly and all say ""welcome"" or ""hello"" even if they are busy and the restaurant is packed. The place itself is a little small, with limited seating options, so don't plan on staying here for too long. The decor is kung-fu-esque with cool little action figures, wooden tables, and Asian inspired art. 

The drinks I got were the Red Bean Wow Milk and the Mango Snow Slush. Both were really good and I would definitely recommend them. Just a side note on the Red Bean; there are actual whole red beans in the drink. That paired with the honey boba made the drink a little hard to drink, but if that's my only complaint with the drink, then they must be doing something right. The Mango Snow Slush was one of the best I've had. The mango was sweet, but was not too much, and the drink was extremely refreshing.

The honey boba here has to be one of the best I've ever had. It was soft, chewy, and sweet. It had a little resistant to it when you first bite it, but it wasn't overcooked or undercooked at all. And it was perfectly sweetened. 

Overall, KFT knows what they're doing. They're doing everything right, and they will definitely have my business whenever I'm in town. If I had to dock them down on something, it would just be the limited parking and the limited seats, but the quality of the boba definitely makes up for it.",jVmVkhZ8NX0eGk5DhSeNUA,5,7,5,VuY2tLPs6ZhZSHOdCqH6KQ

And the milk tea with extra sugar doesn't taste extra(I'm trying to figure out when they said extra sugar if they meant the boba is the extra sugar or the drink) cause really the boba is sweeter then my drink! I'm sad right now. And for how popular they are I'm surprised they didn't have ice blended milk tea. I would like my money back.,YdmxZ3TGH6pNUA61HsMrmQ,0,0,2,3ioq4QU2U_ko2mFPLaht2Q

4946402,2017-02-04,0,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"One of my favorite places to get bubble tea!  The OG Vegas KFT.  There are countless options and you can choose between black, green, or oolong teas for your tea based drinks!  It was also the first shop I've seen to use those shaker machines.  I thought it was a gimmick at first but I promise you that I've never had a milk tea that wasn't amazing.  

My partner and I always choose either the Oolong Milk Tea, Sunshine Pineapple Tea, or Winter melon Tea.  We've tried basically everything in the menu and it all comes back to these 3 drinks.  Something sweet?  Get the Oolong.  Fruity?  Sunshine Pineapple.  Lightly sweet and crisp?  Winter melon.  It doesn't get better than those.

My absolute favorite thing about KFT is that they offer to replace your drink if you don't like it or need adjustments.  They have always offered when handing me my drink and they've never asked any questions.  

The only negatives I could think of would be the size of the place because if there's a line you'll be waiting outside in the freezing cold or the burning hot sun.  The parking lot is also a nightmare to deal with.  

This location does not have any stamp cards but I figured with the free topping with check in you basically break even in the end.  Give this place a try and order the Oolong Milk Tea!",9S52XHEyrvOv4OZxU6pCLw,2,0,5,GA0wo0YFaYtxcogPlkUvaw

The tea options are also nice. The honey black tea is probably my favorite. They have lactose free milk options, as well as non-dairy creamer for their milk tea, and label which teas are vegan on their menu.

Atmosphere has a pop culture kind of vibe, very chill. They have a tv showing kungfu clips and art for sale displayed throughout their walls, which is really nice. Only downside is that they do get pretty crowded and it is a small space. 

Service is great. They'll change anything you don't like about your drink. But speaking of service, I have to say Jenny is super sweet!

Half sugar is like perfect for me. And I always want less ice because I want more drink. 

If you go don't forget to check in for a free topping. I recommend the mango green tea and the ice milk drink. It's sweet milk with boba. I thought it would initially be a slush but it wasn't. I still like it nonetheless. The taro slush is always a good choice for people who are not too into tea. Oh and don't forget to get a stamp card because you might be coming back here a couple of times.

This is the only place in Vegas ( of all the bubble tea places I've tried ) that has consistently delivered excellent customer service. From the time u enter to the time u exit.

If you're not familiar with milk tea or bubble drinks it can be kind of overwhelming as they have a pretty large menu and if you're not fast to place your order the line can pile up behind you and there's not much room to move around because the order counter is right in front of the entrance. So I suggest you step aside if you're having a hard time choosing.

Now I've ventured out and have experimented  with Milk tea and let me just tell you they have an excellent golden oolong milk tea.

Maybe it's because I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley area where there are hundreds of boba shops so I'm a lot pickier with my boba, but the White Gourd Green Milk Tea literally tastes like green milk tea.

5085081,2015-08-18,4,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Kung Fu ""Tea"" should be renamed to Kung Fu ""Milk"" because that is pretty much what their drinks taste like. Milk tea, WOW milk, milk strike...WTF?! Weak @$s ""tea"" if you ask me. 

I consider myself an above average boba drink consumer. This is a long overdue review, simply because I was hoping to find ""my drink,"" which actually never happened. I end up here when my boba cravings occur after 10 p.m. or if I am already dining in the area. 

Despite the PIA parking lot, I still come back for their perfectly cooked honey boba and in house made herbal jelly (grass jelly). These elements redeem the drink somewhat, but I am still disappointed with overall taste. If I had to be nice about it, I would say ""The tea flavor is very light, but heavy on the milk."" 

The customer service isn't the best. The male workers are slightly better than their female counterparts. No bright smiles or ""thank you"" or even ""how do you you like your drink?"" They are pretty darn busy and run the boba shop like a factory line. 

Waiting for your drink is the absolute worst! From cash register to pick up has been average 10 minutes for me. On my most recent visit I waited 10 minutes for my drink with 1 person ahead of me. Prior to that 15 minutes! What makes matters worst is that my drink was ""stolen"" one time when someone had a large pick up order. How about actually comparing the ticket/receipt to the drinks before you hand it off to the customer. Simple, right?! Workers don't seem to care enough to ask you what's up even though you're the only person sitting on the bench still waiting for their drink. One employee apologized for the screw up and attempted to get me a voucher for a ""comped"" drink next visit. That employee went in the back for more than 5 minutes and never came back. I was tired of waiting and never got that free drink or discount. 

Anything with milk tastes the same. Earl grey milk tea tastes like a weak black tea. No notes of bergamot detected on my tongue. Golden Oolong milk tea, average. White gourd green milk tea, weak. After trying WOW milk and milk strike, I am left confused ""what is this supposed to taste like?"" Oh, milk. 

The matcha red bean slush is the only drink actually tastes decent.

This place is not my cup of tea. *giggle*",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,4,2,3,t9WCFrZEPDuf83DX0ii0tw

As a reflection of their radiant reviews you'll know that KFT is one of the more popular boba places in town. Although I am not really a huge boba fan I do get the occasional craving and this is the place I like to visit. They offer a wide range of drinks from milk teas to slushies and everthing in between. I dig the fact that you can customize your drink according to sweetness and or ice and milk levels. They have the cutest decors with Kung fu and Bruce Lee as the theme of course! Everyone is very friendly, you're greeted as you come in and when leaving. Sometimes it gets pretty crowded and hectic especially the parking situation as they are located in a very small shopping center in China town.

Matcha green tea is my favorite in all its form. Their Oolong milk tea is pretty good as well as their Taro Slush. They have an extensive menu and I have yet to try half of them but hey the more reason to keep coming back right? I've only had their boba and red bean toppings and both are very good, theirs is one of the better ones I've tried.

5100258,2014-12-07,7,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Seriously, the best boba in Vegas and possibly country. 

I first came across Kung Fu Tea on a freezing *** night in NYC. My friend & I were wandering around Chinatown (which is a shady area at night time--I don't recommend it) searching for hot boba. Along came KFT. It was packed with young asian people. PACKED. There was also no place to sit. Intro, LV KFT! It's still packed with asian people but there are plenty of places to sit, chill, and drink your boba. Location, next door to Monta btw.

BOBA: On the chewier, firmer side (which I prefer). Props for consistency. The boba is the same every time. Don't forget your yelp check-in for 1 free topping. I like mine w/ honey boba & grass jelly. 

DRINKS: As usual, I love that they give sugar options. 30%, half, 70% etc. They also have the best milk tea ever--Golden Oolong Milk Tea. It's the business. Green Tea Slush is tasty as well. It has red bean in it but I prefer boba. They'll make anything you want but generally speaking I would stick with what's on the menu. As Ardie Y. and I have discovered, Grapefruit Milk Tea isn't on the menu for a reason... You've been warned. They have some yogurt drinks + other random milky drink concoctions that I haven't tried yet. The menu is definitely on the larger side! I don't know if I'll ever get through it!

They have a wide variety of drinks that include milk teas, blended drinks, wow milk, classic Asian teas, and other drink inventions.  In addition to boba, they also offer herbal jelly, red bean, and mung bean as toppings.  For those boba connoisseurs out there their boba is slightly chewier and sweeter than average, but that is exactly the way I like it.  I tend to like my boba sweet and my drink not as sweet.

My go to drink: Mango Green Tea 30% sweetness and boba instead of mango jellies. (Just in case you were interested)
 Second favorite drink: White Gourd Green Tea 50% sweetness

Their service is awesome here! Super welcoming and almost always offer you a sample of their drink of the way when you walk into the store.  Their drinks are also very customizable.  You can control the amount of sweetness and ice levels when you order.  Also they adjust your drink even after it is made to make sure you love it.  

Another great aspect of the store is their decor.  Since it has a Martial Arts theme, they always have Martial Arts videos running on their flat screen.  Also you'll see the theme in the furniture throughout, even in the bathroom.  On the walls they also display local art work that you can purchase if you are interested.

I ordered the most famous oolong tea milk tea with boba and it was amazing! The automatic shaking machine they use really infused the milk into the tea and even gave it a frothy texture. Strong oolong taste but not too strong where it was over-bearing.

Their teas are freshly brewed (none of that powder ish!), drinks are shaken with an automatic shaker (where can I buy one of those?), and boba is made every 2 hours. The boba always has a perfect consistency with just the right amount of sweetness. It's basically heaven.

My favorite drinks are the White Gourd Green Milk Tea with 70% sweetness and the KF Jasmine Green Milk Tea (100% sweet). The taste is unique and something I just can't find anywhere else. And it's just simply freakin' delicious! Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get that free topping! The staff here are all very nice, and always ask if you need adjustments to just let them know and they'll remake the drink for you. As all the other reviews have mentioned, you can customize your drink to how you want it in terms of ice, sweetness, and milk.

You just can't go to Chinatown and not stop by here. My husband and I average at least 3x a week, we're that addicted.

5278122,2015-08-07,4,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Me and my husband came here on a Monday night at around 10PM, and even still the immensely popular Kung Fu Tea was bustling with activity. All the tables inside were full, and the line just barely stretched out past the entrance door. To top it all off, the shopping center that houses Kung Fu Tea was packed with nary a parking spot in sight. The line whittled away with lightning speed, though, and we scarcely had a chance to decide on our drink orders. My husband wanted a Taro smoothie, but that plan backfired when we were told they were out of Taro. Back to square 1! Both of us went with recommendations from the friendly cashier. 

MILK HONEY GREEN TEA W/BOBA ($3.50): I asked for a sweet drink and the cashier suggested this. Really liked this drink because it was super sweet and refreshing. The boba was plump, soft, and the had the perfect texture. They're so SQUISHY!! The boba topping ($0.50) was free because of the Yelp check-in offer. 4/5

MANGO SLUSH W/BUBBLE ($5.25): Husband asked what drink was popular, and the cashier steered him towards this drink. He normally gets boba but went with a lychee jelly. He was impressed with his drink. Wasn't my cup of tea and nearly gagged when I slurped down some lychee. Still not a fan of that stuff lol. 4/5

VIBE: Energetic with a bit of kung fu hustle. They have a flat-screen towards the back of the shop that was playing a newer slapstick comedy Kung Fu movie (on Netflix). The miniature kung fu figurines lined along the counter were cute. Would have liked to chill inside while slurping down some boba but there was no space. Maybe next time. 4/5

Worth a Return Visit?
Kung Fu Tea stays open pretty late, so it's a perfect boba spot in the later hours to hit in the later hours of the day. Boba was perfect and the drinks were tasty.

1) There are SO many different flavors of drinks to choose from. You can adjust the sweetness to your liking (and they will HAPPILY remake it if you don't like it), they use lactose free milk (praise the Lawd). #nopoops

2) I'm so big on customer service, and they nailed it.  They're very friendly and even take the time to wipe the cup of each drink after it's been made (I hate sticky fingers).

5297051,2018-05-01,0,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Kung Fu Tea is by far my favorite boba place in San Diego. I have not tried other locations, so my review is based solely on my visit to this location.

The tea is top notch. It is creamy and smooth and I haven't been anywhere that I like more. You know how good it is by the long lines in afternoons and late at night. Back to the actual drink, the proportions are perfect, in my opinion. There is just the right amount of ice not making it water down, and just the right amount of boba, not having to ask for extra. In addition, when I finish the drink, there is this white foam that sticks to the side of the cup and I think that's what makes it great. I always look forward to coming here, and almost always do when I'm in the area. I have nothing negative to say about it.

5 stars for Kung Fu Tea!

UPDATE: Kung Fu Tea is no longer my favorite boba joint, but is still up there. I have only a few minor complaints, but they are easy to get by. There were some inconsistencies since I've been here, such as at some points there was too much sugar added to the beverage. I'm not very tolerant to caffeine, so it was hard for me to sleep, when I can usually sleep fine from drinking tea. This was only a single experience, and it did not happen again. In addition, the lines can get a little long, which is expected from such a popular shop.

Not because I don't like it, but because there wasn't one closer to home. But good news! They have one on Rainbow and Warm Springs which is 5 mins from me! Yay!

I love the ambience of this place. It's has such a upbeat and positive vibe. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. Always willing to answer questions and always has a smile. 

I always get the Mango slush with mango jelly with less sweet. AMAZING! Especially when it's 110 degrees out. I love how you can adjust the sweetness of any drink on the menu. They have a wide variety of drinks. So many different types of drinks and flavors. 

2 cons for me. Pricing and location of the register. I honestly feel that pricing is on the higher end. Too much on certain drinks for sure. I think they can knock off $1 or don't charge for 1 topping at least. I didn't even know you can get a free topping my checking in on Yelp. I checked in after i ordered and it was too late to claim.

5320619,2014-10-11,3,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"With the recent opening of Kung Fu Tea, the plaza it is located in has become one of my favorite food places to go to in all of the Chinatown area. It is a great addition that fits perfectly well with other very popular and delicious restaurants in the same complex, such as Monta, Big Wong and Curry Zen. Being a native of Vegas and a milk tea fanatic, I have tried almost every single boba place in this city. Kung Fu is by far one of the BEST place in town. Judging by the amount of customers that I see consistently lined up at the door, I guarantee I'm not the only one that thinks highly of this place. 

Let's talk about...

Location--  When you think of Asian cuisine, Spring Mt & Decatur is the heart of Chinatown and the first thing that comes into mind. Kung Fu Tea happens to be located on that corner and in a popular plaza that is always busy with customers. It is located in the far right corner of the plaza, within walking distance from many of the restaurants there. This makes it a convenient place to meet up, or grab desserts/drinks after dinner. (Note: There is a spacious parking lot for the plaza. However, during the busy hours of 7PM-10PM, the parking lot WILL fill up.)

Service-- Kung Fu Tea has very, VERY good customer service. The staff is not only friendly, but also attentive. There's always multiple people that acknowledges customers as they walk in. They occasionally pass out drink samples and take their time to explain what the drinks are. They're also very willing to answer questions regarding their menu. Every time they call out a drink order, they will always ask if you require any type of adjustments on the drinks. On different occasions, I had them readjust my drinks because I didn't like the sweetness level. Each time, the workers would happily take my drink (even when they got busy) and remake it for me until I was satisfied. Unlike other boba places, they want you to get your money's worth and understand the need to focus on your preferences.They will cater to your taste buds until you walk out happy. 

Drinks & Quality-- Kung Fu Tea prepares each drink fresh and allows you to customize each of your drink order. You have full range of customizing from things such as toppings, amount of sugar, amount of ice and the amount of milk/ or tea used. Their willingness to let you decide gives this place a very competitive edge over other boba places.

Being a fan of milk tea, I have ordered many different variations of their Kung Fu Special Tea. No matter what it is you order, they seem to stay true to the meaning of ""Milk TEA"" by actually brewing fresh tea that is strong enough to taste even when combined with milk/ creamer and toppings. Unlike other places that I find overuse their dairy products, Kung Fu Tea actually makes your drink mostly with tea as a base. Their brews are also very aromatic and rich in flavors. 

My absolute favorite thing to order is the White Gourd Green Tea. One of the male cashier previously suggested that I add creamer to the white gourd in order to turn it into a milk tea. Since then, this customized drink has been my go to beverage  and possibly the best milk tea I have ever tasted. I always pair it with their herbal jelly and it comes out amazing. The jelly is made in house and has the perfect amount of sweetness that goes well with the slightly bitterness of the tea. I prefer my drinks on more of the sweet side so if you do end up ordering this drink, I suggest asking them for less sugar or more ice. To some, the white gourd tea could be a little sweet. Their boba is also very good here. It is chewy but soft, with a hint of sweetness from the honey they use.

The only negative thing I would have to say about this place is that in the beginning, I had an issue with the way they handled the drink. This might be more of my personal preference but I noticed the workers would wipe the drinks before they gave it out with a cloth rag. They would use the same rag for every drink. I know they do this so that the drinks are dry and not wet from any overflowing teas. While I appreciate their attention to details, I remember taking a sip of my drink after a worker did that and inhaling a big whiff of ""wet laundry/dirty wet rag"" smell from the top plastic cover. I said something to the worker and they re-poured my drink right away. The next time that I came in to order, I told the cashier I didn't want my drink wiped with the rag and saw that one of the girls used a disposable paper towel instead. From then on, I'd continue to request that.

Like I said, it's a personal preference and something to look out for if you're like me. I simply hate that smell. Other than that, this place is highly recommended and definitely a must try!",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,9,2,5,XIsOvbIkK0fD91G4bwd-_A

Please note we are used to Half & Half standards and the competitive offerings of SGV.  One way to test the authenticity/ true flavor of the drinks is to order a plain milk tea.  I settled on the green milk tea.  One thing I like about that drink was the tea leaves they used (strong, fragrant, not bitter) but the overall drink was too light and not sweet enough.  It didn't have that ""body"" that other GMT's have.  

Also tried the caramel macchiato slushee which was finely ground and overall had good flavor.  I'm assuming the pull the espresso shot individually for the drink?  Forgot to note how they were making it.

I've visited Kung Fu Tea about three times now and the conclusion of it all is: they have great tea. 

I think I've tried an almond milk tea, oolong tea, and an oolong milk tea. Their tea is definitely their pride and joy. The tea makes itself known and I love that. I love the fact that I know I'm drinking tea and not diabetes in a cup. I also love the fact that I can adjust the sweetness level to my liking, from 100% to 75% to 50% ... so it just proves my previous point! 

However, the milk tea was quite lacking in my opinion. Whenever I drink their milk tea, it tastes watered down .. which is really confusing to me. I can taste the TEA in the drink but it tastes like it got watered down significantly. It doesn't taste like what I would imagine milk tea to taste. 

Aside from that, the establishment is quite small but hey, it's a just a beverage joint. A good majority of times, I just order my drink, get it, and then leave. 

Regardless, I'm not quite sure how often I would visit Kung Fu Tea. I would definitely go in if I'm feeling in the mood for some tea but that's about it.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,4,3,5WTdsY-i1JRpOGTdqWw1sw

The worst part is parking. It can be very difficult to find a spot and this place is always busy. During the summer, the air conditioning isn't very strong so it's somewhat warm inside.
What I like about this place is that they had a huge assortment of drinks and you can ask for Boba or other options that can be put into your drink. They offer an option of no sugar or less sugar in your drink. The price is right and the service was very nice. It is also quick service for the amount of orders that they get.
I ordered the taro slush tea with Boba and it was outstanding. My friend ordered the taro slush tea with Oreo cookies mixed throughout and she said it was amazing to the point where she cannot stop drinking it. We will definitely be going back.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,1,0,5,a7LgjdkXIsQz2OsRykEB9Q

5517378,2017-08-02,2,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"You know how many times I have been in this shopping plaza in an attempt to leave my DNA in Kung Fu Tea?! Well, only a bunch of times too many. Each time was a no go for me because for one, the parking sucks. Just sucks. I know that word is so juvenile, but it's universal and gets the message done. It SUCKS! 

Secondly, I think having the cash register right infront of the door was not a good idea. Why? Well, when people enter and there is a line...people tend to let the line linger out the door versus going into the business and bending the line from the inside 'causing a worker to shout out at customers to close the door and come inside. So really, it may look busier than it appears because of the line that goes out the door. Which I realized why each time I attempted to go...it looked extra dramatic than it probably was.

Anyhoo...we ordered a strawberry lemonade BLACK tea which on the menu is offered with a green tea. But boy#1 wanted black. Got a taro milk tea with red bean, a pina colada smoothie, and a honey oolong iced tea. 

Personally, 5 stars for my oolong iced tea. I got the sweetness at whatever percentage it comes with which I thought was pretty sweet. So I know next time...i can drop the percentage to 50 or even 25. I did read they brew their teas every 3 hours which is a great thing because I appreciate a fresh brew and it'll prove worth with each sip. Cashier was pretty patient with me and helpful.

Their pina colada was pretty blah, and their taro milk tea was just as taro milk tea as it can get, and honestly...wasnt a fan of the strawberry lemonade drink my son got. Also, I was a little disappointed they karate chopped the possibility of whipping up a strawberry iced black tea.

But alls I can give is 3 Stars because I do feel like it's overhyped, nothing to drive my way out for or can't get from one's typical go-to spot, and aside from my oolong our other drinks didn't excite us. If you're in the vicinity I'd recommend giving them a shot for sure, or if you just want to knock them off your bookmark...by all means certainly worth the try.

Would I be back? Sure...if I'm in the plaza and the line isn't out the door for the honey oolong iced tea.

Comment from Boba S. of Kung Fu Tea 
Business Owner
9/19/2016  Hello KATHIE

I appreciate you taking the time to write your thoughts and opinions about the Kung Fu Tea franchise.

I did some investigating on your visit today and I do apologize for some misunderstandings here.  I did ask KEVAN about this customization and he did not approve such a thing.  We are a franchise and unfortunately NOT allowed this.  I agree with you!  Mango&Passion is NOT a WACKY drink.  Alas the higher powers that be do not allow this.  In fact NEVER.  Trouble has been issued to us for such WACKY concoctions.  Silly?  I concur.

I do hope you re-consider your review about this matter.  We really can't do it.  Your disdainful rating will have to stay with us.  You can hate us, be long gone with us, and be happy at Starbucks.  We try our best and if we messed up your drink.. Sorry again.  

You can go to the other Kung Fu Tea... They will get in trouble.  In fact you just got them in trouble.  No stamp cards there either.  I think YOU should question them about it.  Not us.

Dominic
************UPDATE/RESPONSE*** 9/20/2016**********************
Thank you for your reply.

Who are you suggesting I question, and about what?

As a point of clarification, in the past Kevan made these drinks for us himself. It wasn't necessarily a matter of needing his approval?... regardless, I completely understand now that it was not something he ""should"" have been doing and that you are bounded by rules.... rules that do not reflect amazing customer experiences.

Dominic I'd be more than happy to give your store the 5 stars it deserves, but you too are missing the big picture. You FAIL to acknowledge it in your reply as well. You failed to show us how much you CARE about our needs as the customer. You expressed understanding about our frustrations... BUT as the OWNER you offered NO further solutions... as simple as

 ""I will continue to submit requests the to the powers that be for this alteration as I understand this change will make many of my customers happy."" 

YOU are the person in the best position to express this need and push for the changes to occur. BUT you mentioned nothing of the sort. I'm a little disappointed.",FlARwS-i3Nacl6k32wP3Zg,0,0,2,1Esm_hLWbpsvhRKXsxYdJw

As I worked at tea shops for many years (6yrs) before moving to Las Vegas, this is my favorite boba spot in Vegas, and I hope that says a lot.
The reason I am leaving a review is not only because they deserve an awesome review, but also I want to let the store know there is something to improve on.
THE BOBA! Recently whenever I buy drinks with boba, I often find them stick to a big chunk of boba patty at the bottom when I finished the drink. From my experience, this may caused by over-cooked or something, but I am not sure, so that's for you guys to figure out.
Anyway, I still decided to leave a 5-star instead of 4 because it doesn't really bother me so much that it disappoint my experience here. But definitely looking forward to see improvement, or at least, just don't scoop that chunk in the drink next time :P",8xZLVGMzgIgAMIQeJZNuog,4,1,5,e3phVMWkRMWKSiXfjXiFWw

+3 stars, four out of seven drinks were good, not great

-2 stars, three out of remaining boba drinks were bad, bad enough that after taking 4 tastes the person wanted to throw the rest away.

-1 star, drink selection is too large.  too many drinks for customers is confusing and many of the drinks are not good enough to be served to customers.  pick 6-10 drinks and do those well.  not offer 100 drinks and hope your customers find your 6-10 only good drinks.",AjTSklbZIQKKB8JUrIoj3g,0,0,2,X8f_umhduH8Dpnf-4tG_Kg

5645114,2016-03-03,0,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"Kung Fu Tea (KFT) is that place you and your friends end up going to when you want a sweet drink that is close by. It's the hangout spot. I am here at least twice a week with friends or sometimes I just come here to do homework. Beware of this place getting crowded because it happens quite often.

Every time I am here the staff are always friendly and they never fail to greet you as you walk in and or leave. They usually have samples out for customers to try as well. They have a sign for levels of sweetness that you can choose to adjust your drink with. If you have any problems with your drink they are also willing to change it for you!

MILK TEAS
My favorite would have to be the jasmine milk tea. Other great drinks are the white gourd green milk tea and oolong milk tea. I usually get the standard sweetness level on all of my drinks.

YOGURT DRINKS
My usual order at KFT is a yogurt green tea! Although it is my favorite out of the menu, my total comes out to almost $5 for a medium sized drink.

Another thing about KFT is that it's kind of a hit or miss with the drinks. I try to stay with my ""usuals"" because other drinks that I have tried didn't really stick with me. I either love a drink or hate a drink, there's no in between.

I was disappointed. The boba was hard and the milk tea just wasn't what I was used to. I told myself I would never go back.

But people kept going on and on about KFT and how good their teas are. So I gave it a second chance and was pleasantly surprised. Nowhere else in the city can you get such flavorful tea with attentive smiling youngsters ready to adjust your drink if you find anything wrong. 

From my personal experience and opinion, KFT is great for teas and not for anything milky. The ""wow"" milk was more like ""eh"" milk.

+ Positive Notes +
Service is amazing all the time.
The tea is delicious and some even come with jelly!
They let you choose sweetness level.
The place is hip and always clean.

Recently went on vacation to New York City, when or train came to haunt and had to get off to reroute our trip cause of weekend construction we stumbled upon a Kung Fu Tea. We stopped and grabbed some boba tea and were instantly hooked! I'm a green tea fan so I got the Very Berry Green Tea and was hooked (it's strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, and blackberries all shook up with green tea). During our trip in NYC we kept coming across them and stopped each time to grab a drink. 

When arriving back in Las Vegas a friend tagged themselves at Kung Fu Tea in Las Vegas... I was like WHAAAAT!?!? A few days before I was telling my girlfriend I wish we had Kung Fu Tea in Vegas (I kept forgetting to look to see if we had one here)... So after seeing this photo we automatically planned our day around stopping at KFT. 

We just got here and I got my Very Berry Green Tea and am very happy! I got one without ice to take home. KFT has tons of options for drinks, we came with a few friends and tried quite a few drinks tonight. I must say they have the best tea and selection that I've come across at a tea spot, their boba tastes a little sweeter to me than other places which is awesome (not too sweet just seems like there's a touch of honey or something). 

Come and try this place if you love boba/bubble tea (and even if you don't.. It's that good!) this place is awesome with a great selection. Kung Fu Tea is the spot to go for your bubbles and tea!",NR8hSGOUqD-iY8rQPw4UAg,1,0,5,LB2sShaobG0pThVsvxJN0g

5748439,2015-07-02,0,IZivKqtHyz4-ts8KsnvMrA,"By far one of my favorite places to grab boba in Las Vegas. Milk tea done right everytime!

The White Gourd Green Milk Tea has quickly become my favorite item on their drink menu. I've never really seem it around other shops and it's my go-to drink now everytime I need my milk tea fix. Their taro milk teas rock, and their wow milks great as well. It's kind of nice too how they advertise some of their drinks as lactose-free AND how you're able to change the sweetness levels of your drink. After having to deal with milk tea that tasted like diabetes for too long (and a mother who is very sensitive to sugar), Kung Fu Tea might as well be a godsend.

The biggest con is that since it's opened, this place has started getting more and more popular and more foot traffic inside, which is good for them and their business, but has also made it rather noisy for me to consider it a hang out spot. It was nice and kind of peaceful when they first opened but when I came again months later it was very difficult trying to play cards and hear what my friends were saying. There was even so many people I saw them line outside as they kept the door open. Then again, the shopping center it's located in is ALWAYS busy and bustling with people, it's kind of impressive how the workers all manage to be cordial to everyone while getting everyone's orders in a timely manner.

EDIT (Oct 7, 2015) - After going here numerous amounts of times, I decided to bump my previously 4 star review into a 5 star one. While I do admit that Kung Fu Tea isn't one of those  places where you can get your work and studying done in a quiet productive area, I've found that KFT does have times where it's not as hectic. In addition, I really do think the service and quality of products they offer are worth 5 stars. They take the time to answer all your questions when you're unfamiliar with the menu, sometimes even going as far as to warning you that if you want absolutely no sugar added on your drink you may not be able to taste any of the flavoring. I've also never have had a bad drink from them once, which is not something I say to every business. The white gourd milk tea will always be my favorite from them.",OGur1LXmbFO4WcudRnHGjg,0,0,5,3vJvSLE3JPjn8AYCa_PHpw

However, the kung fu milk tea was sad (especially it is their specialty drink). It tasted super watery! I felt like I was drinking water. They were willing to make me another one by adding more black tea in the drink. Unfortunately, it tasted worse. I ended up ordering the winter melon green tea that was being sampled earlier. However, it came out as worse as the kung fu milk tea - watery and tasteless.

Just want to give my 2 cents to the management for monitoring the quality control!

This place has a lot of options! Not quite a place I'd go to for real quality tea but it fulfills the boba craving. Taro teen milk tea and a white gourd green milk tea were ordered. The white gourd green milk tea has no additional sugar added and the taro green milk tea is a ""Vegas pick."" Both drinks were sweet to taste, smooth, and the boba was soft. For boba, you get both black and white boba. 

The atmosphere is colorful and fun. Artwork is sold on the wall for about $100+, a television was playing quirky kung fu videos and clips of pandas getting stuck in swing sets, toys lined the low wall separating the baristas/boba-istas from the rest of the lobby, et cetera. It's a very clean cozy space. 

All in all, I like this place for generic boba smoothies but if you want quality tea, you might want to head closer to Chinatown.

Kung Fu Tea is located in a small plaza that can get packed rather quick during lunch or dinner rush. On our way out of LV, we stopped by here, were there too early, and decided to wait for the place to open. By the time it opened up at 11 AM, there were several other people waiting to get their teas as well. Good to know that this place stays busy at all hours of the day. 

Both times that I came here, they were giving little sample cups of some of their popular teas. It was during these samplings that I realized they make their tea fairly sweet. But if you look on their menu, you can customize the sweetness of the drink by percentages. I opted for the 30% sweet and I thought it was just right. I got the KF Milk Tea which is their black milk tea with boba. They're constantly cooking new boba so it's always chewy and just right. I liked my drink hot and prefer scooping out the boba to eat it. They have a great variety on their menu and I am sure there's something for everyone. Another plus about this place is that they even offer dairy-free milk.

I got the Mung Bean from the WOW Milk section. The mung bean milk was indeed WOW. But the boba was extra chewy (under done?) Yucky boba. 

My wife had the Red bean milk tea. That had a really different taste from all the red bean drink we've had. The tea flavor over powered the red bean taste. That was a first for both of us. On the other hand, her boba was perfect. Yummy boba.

Their classics are superior to the other items on their menu. The boba is made fresh in house and is always of an excellent consistency. Never too hard, never too chewy.

The problem is that the milk teas are either watered down or just too creamy. They come off as diluted milkshakes. The tea is meager and barely detectable. 

What else? It's open relatively late (11 p.m. weekdays, midnight weekends), and though the space is small, there usually tends to be an open table and is a decent study spot if you're able to handle the high foot traffic.

I will say, though, that the TEA was fantastic. I usually like my boba teas a little more sweet, but the quality of the tea here is amazing. Would I drive out of my way just for a good cup of iced tea? Prob not.....But if I'm next door waiting for Monta Ramen anyways, sure, I'll stop in :)",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,2,4,3,o90JvWT_iuehoafou1D3iw

They're all good and their boba are always fresh and soft. If you catch them on a Friday night/weekends you'll be looking at a wait, but it's worth it.

It's almost funny to say ""do you think kung fu tea is going to be busy?"" because they tend to ALWAYS be busy. And that says a lot! The line usually goes out the door! Why, you ask?

They make their teas fresh and have good quality boba. That's why! You can adjust your flavors, sugar level, ice level, and they basically make your drink however you want it. Their menu looks a little intimidating but it's really your basic stuff with some other fancy schmancy type drinks. 

I'm a passion fruit black tea kind of girl. No matter what you can never go wrong with passion fruit and boba. Babe loves his mango black tea. The only thing is that his mango black tea had a weird after taste. But, I think their black tea is super strong.

Either way, kung fu tea isn't a bad stop to get boba. Just think about how much time you have because sometimes it can take a while to get your drink.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,1,0,4,iMJKFZIQoPHU1CeQFeRgew

After seeing pictures of their Oreo Milk Tea and reading reviews here on Yelp, I just had to give it a try. The Oreo Milk Tea is freaking amazing! I got mine made with Oolong tea (you can choose from Oolong or Black tea), regular level of sugar and more ice. Very cool that you can choose the level of sweetness in your drinks, as I have not seen this elsewhere. Whoever invented this Oreo Milk Tea is a genius, and thank you! :) I love the taste of this unique drink and even with regular amount of sugar, its not too sweet. 

The staff is very friendly. They even mention that if you don't like the drink you ordered, let them know how they can adjust it or they can also make you something else without extra charge. How awesome is that! I think the only drawback to this place is the location. I mean, they are conveniently located in Chinatown, but in a crowded plaza with neighbors like Curry Zen, Monta and Raku. So parking definitely sucks sometimes! I have also seen the line going out the door all the way to Monta.

Okay, so there are so many, many boba places everywhere and sometimes you just get so used to it all that a boba milk tea here, was a boba milk tea there. A little boba-complacency, if you will.

Well not here, at Kung Fu Tea. Boba revolution!!! I'm being dramatic, but it was just really exciting to take a sip of my boba and not actually be bombarded by some sugarbomb of powdered flavoring!

The boba here was outstanding; chewing, freshly-cooked and honeyed. Their menu was extensive enough, but I've seen more lengthy menus. Don't be disappointed though, quality over quantity here at KFT. I ordered a peach tea with boba and it was perfect :) The tea wasn't too sweet. I went with my cousins and we all pretty much tasted each other's orders lol. Someone ordered the oreo milk tea and I nearly cried, it was so damn good! 

The place is super cute too. Lots of Bruce Lee paintings and Rush Hour was playing on their flatscreen. Free wifi too :) Not many tables though, and the lines will continue outside.

When I watch the workers making the drinks, I notice that they make a conscious effort to pour in as much drink and give you your money's worth.

There's only been one drink that I haven't liked, which is the honey black tea. I'm not sure if it's the drink itself or if it's just because I don't like black tea?

Most of the workers are very nice. My particular favorite kung fu tea worker is Kevon (not sure I'm spelling it correctly). He is always very social and very friendly to all customers.
