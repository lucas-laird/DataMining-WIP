Took a little while before the waitress brought us menus. I was NOT trying to rush her or make her feel bad, but I got up trying to find menus so when she got the chance to come over, we'd be ready to order. I couldn't find any and she noticed what I was doing. Boy, I didn't get the nicest look for doing that. (I understand what it's like being busy and feeling a bit overwhelmed because I've been in the restaurant business that's why I was trying to ""help"" by getting the menus myself.)

They were a little busy for what I saw of two waitresses. The service was okay. Not awful but not average either.

Anyway, got the Avacado BLT. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Wouldn't order it again. The french fries were good. Had a little seasoning on them and were more like steak fries. The menu isn't huge.

Prices were average. Not too high, and not too low. Sandwich I believe was $10.99.

We go to Vegas about 3 times a year (sometimes more than that for me with work) and we come here everytime we depart. The prices are super reasonable, the service is spectacular (sitting at the wood, thank you Ralph!) and the value/ quality of food is great. 

Point lost for a less than desirable location (if you don't know this place exists, you will never find it or a 5 minute walk from my usual gate), it can get super busy, loud at peak times and if you are sitting anywhere, but at the bar top, service can be slow.

1192367,2018-01-07,0,JJpoHl5mxJHwbaix71mfyg,"Nothing special about its ""special"" Southern fried chicken.

Very odd on any airport restaurant's menu is an item that requires 20 minutes to make from scratch, as is the fried half-chicken and fries for $16.  Chicken emerged explosively hot 20 minutes later, consistent with an immediate trip from the fryer to the table.  Unfortunately, the accolades end there.

Batter was thin and rather underflavored.  Very odd to have to add salt to a fried chicken dish, but this modification improved things somewhat.  And once the oil cooled down, the chicken meat ended up being being overcooked and dry.  Too bad.

Chicken was served with a generous supply of heavily salt-and-peppered steak fries, which were the highlight of this dish, and the cause for some swollen ankles the next morning.  Cole slaw was flavorful, but unfortunately frozen in the center - this stuff must have been pre-made and recently pulled out of the freezer.

Please keep in mind that this is in the airport for heavens sakes!  I'm not sure what airports people are traveling to and from but from my experience all over the U.S., good food is rare in airports!  Good service is almost non-existent!  At the Village, we received both excellent food and excellent service.  It's ""Seat Yourself"" so be prepared to flag a server down if needed, don't wait for them to just happen to notice you.  We were greeted relatively quickly by our wonderful server Brenda shortly after we sat down but we sat right on the edge so she couldn't miss us!

Our food and drinks came very fast and everything was piping hot.  The chowder is super thick and creamy with clams in every bite!  The garlic bread served with the chowder isn't anything to write home about but it was fresh so I'll give them that!  The fish and chips are great, with four very large pieces of thick, tender and flaky cod and more fries than I could ever eat.  The coleslaw is a little vinegary and ""wet"" but it was still crisp and cold.  The fried chicken was also tender and juicy with a well seasoned crispy outside and again, more steak fries than you could ever eat!  

Service by Brenda was fantastic, even though the place was packed.  She served each of her tables with a smile and took a little bit of time with each table to provide personal service.  That being said, the male server that was running around like Zippy the clown definitely needs to have some training on effective time management and customer service skills!!  

Most importantly for adult travelers needing a beverage or two before or after their flights, they have possibly the best drinks in Las Vegas!!  Perfect pours for our simple drinks of gin and tonic!

2046440,2017-05-15,0,JJpoHl5mxJHwbaix71mfyg,"FISH AND CHIPS WITH TARTAR SAUCE DIPS.

Upon waiting for my transfer flight, I found this place from the corner of my eye. Village Pub and Grill is opens out to the lobby with open seating of your choice. Definitely a very sociable environment due to its open seating and smoker-friendly zone next door, which also has slot machines. Lets talk about this food.

The FOOD: 

Fish and Chips: THE REAL BRITISH TEA AND CRUMPETTES.
For those of you not hip to the proper English, this is fried fish with French fries. Advertised as the signature item here consisting of huge chunks of Icelandic Cod dipped in a beer batter with their handcrafted Ellis Island beer. Somehow at every fish and chips place, beer finds its way into the batter as if the chef is trying to spike their customers. Overall, the cod is sweet and moist on the inside with a perfect outer, crispy layer. Their homemade tartar sauce and lemon wedges pair well to complement the cod's sweetness while highlighting the taste of the fish. Definitely eat this quickly as the batter becomes soggy when it cools down (-1 star) and you start to notice how greasy the outer layer becomes (-1 star), which makes it borderline nauseating. The seasoned steak fries add substance to this meal. Overall, the taste is on point, but the texture changes as it cools. Try to see if you can taste the beer in the batter. I tasted some remnants of the hops, but nothing too imposing.

The VERDICT: FINDING YOUR LONDON IN LAS VEGAS.
I think its pretty rare for people to arrive in Las Vegas with a craving for Fish and Chips, but if you are the 0.0001% that do, check out Village Pub and Grill. Definitely a great place to relax, people watch, and enjoy a brew or two with the sounds of the slot machines. Their signature Fish and Chips features huge chunks of moist cod without that fishiness. They are golden fried and delicious, but as they cool, you start to notice how soggy and greasy they are. Do not let the clock strike midnight for this Cinderella story and eat these quickly and fresh. Skip on taking these home and definitely enjoy them here with their homemade tartar sauce. By the way, Fish and Chips go great with some alcohol (pre or post-game).",DooN-gRzhAdZgmJK2NfdpA,1,1,3,HBzwkseHFeiRvkWnvTOICw

I had the Angus burger with cheddar, bacon, and guacamole.  OMG one of the best burgers I have ever had.  So often you get a burger where all the flavors get muddled together or one item over powers the rest.  Not this one.  Every bite you could taste each individual component.  The burger was juicy, beefy buttery full of flavor and was cooked perfect medium rare like i asked, the cheese actually tasted like cheddar cheese.  The bacon was crispy, not too salty and the avocado in the  Guacamole added a creamy note to the burger that can be beat. It's served on a Chiabata bun that was one of the better ones I have ever had.  Most chiabata are a little chewy and though to chew threw.  This one had just the right amount of strength to hold every thing but you could still get threw it with one bite. My wife had the club sandwich.  Another great sandwich.  Served on the same chiabatta. The ham was as good as it gets  the turkey was thin sliced and full of flavor. The same bacon as on the burger.  Such a simple sandwich but so easy to screw up.  This one however was not.  Don't stop here thinking your going to get a light meal.  Be prepared to eat.  And for being in an airport the prices were not out of line.  Especially for what you get.  Service was probably the best i had anywhere in town. I came with Fries or slaw.  The fries were standard slaw was good.  Thankfully the airline I fly uses the terminal this place is located in.

I'll start with the two positives.  One, we were able to sit down right away without a wait.  Two, my husband ordered the Amber Ale and really liked it.

It goes downhill from there.  We decided to order two of the wraps and split them.  We ordered the Chicken Caesar Wrap and the California Chicken Wrap.  The Chicken Caesar Wrap had good flavor, but it was extremely dry.  It seems that all of the Caesar dressing was at the bottom of the wrap, which was a bummer.  The California Chicken Wrap barely had any chicken in it.  It was surrounded by monterey jack cheese, which I love, but it was way too much cheese.  This sandwich was nothing special.  I selected the cole slaw as my side, and was not impressed.  It had a weird flavor too it and there were green peppers in it, which I find to be rather odd.  My husband went with the side salad which is an upcharge of $1.25, but he seemed to like that option better.

The fingers came out fast, were hot and tasted good.
The pint was amazing, after trying another place down the terminal.
The service was great! Fast and friendly, even for a Sunday afternoon, as busy as it was.

I was surprised at how good the food is! I was leaving to head back to SF and decided to eat before I got on the airplane.

I sat down outside as the Village has inside seats and outside tables and chairs for people who still want to play the slot machines.

As soon as I sat down my server came and passed me a menu. She asked me if I wanted something to drink and I stuck with my normal water especially after partying in Vegas!  Wooo I needed water! :) 

I ordered and 15 minutes later my meal was coming out. For 2 people the bill turned out to be less then $30 not bad for Vegas! Everything was SO GOOD!

I would recommend coming here as it's reasonable and food is delicious!",chG58EhXagCSvub2-a73RA,8,8,5,NC7-ERJibuODU573_lKbJQ

Village Pub and Grill is the reason why sometimes I decide to go hungry rather than eat in an airport.  McCarran Terminal 3 already has very slim picking so it's easy to get trapped into eating at Village Pub and Grill.  

Offering a number of pub staples, there was just about nothing that looked good here.  I ended up going with a Cobb salad because I didn't want a burger sitting like a brick in my gut all flight.  The Cobb was huge but unfortunately not very good.  Topped with way too much old blue cheese, the salad has some fresh ingredients (the chicken was ok) and some not so fresh (the lettuce was a few days past crisp).  The dressing was terrible.  Really terrible.  Not tasting like ranch and not tasting like blue cheese.  It really just had no taste.  Served with soggy garlic bread.  A Cobb salad should not be this bad even in an airport.

The server was really overworked and was way past friendly and clearly just in survival mode.

I'm going to stay away from Village Pub and Grill.  I'd rather go hungry on my 5 hour flight than eat there again.",J7sOFHpKmQWlcsxf0dO2TQ,1,1,1,SLLx8BKSG-5YLZKB44QPCA

There are signs ""please seat yourselves,"" so we grabbed a table. A waitress named Tracy took our order. Everything was fine up to this point. In the middle of our meal, Tracy placed the bill on our table. That was not pleasant because we were in the middle of eating; who knew we could be ordering more food. She was basically telling us to eat quickly and leave. The restaurant was not even busy. We were about to ask about why we got the bill before finishing our meal but my friend first wanted to have a box to pack her food. Before my friend had a chance to ask Tracy for a box, Tracy came over and yanked my friend's plate away. That was RUDE. My friend asked her not to take it away as she needed a box to have it packed. My friend said it was taking Tracy forever to bring us a box so she walked up to a cashier and asked him to get the box. As my friend was getting the box from this cashier, she asked if giving the bill to a customer before she asks for it is normal and the cashier responded yes! Is this just the American way of things. We did not see anyone else receiving his bill before asking for it so we thought the waitress was just being a racist. There was a Vietnamese lady sitting at a table next to us who was not being served despite having waited for about 20 minutes and she told us she was leaving not to miss her flight. Only three of us were ""people of colour"" at the time.   

The Cobb salad I got had very very dry and hard bits of bacon and chicken in it, and I barely touched it. I ended up throwing out the whole thing.

Things were looking good when I arrived:  the feel was authentic, the menu said the fish and chips were batter-dipped as opposed to breaded, they brought me malt vinegar without me having to ask after I ordered , and the fish even looked pretty on the plate when they sat it down.

But when I started to eat it things were wrong fast.  At first, I thought there was fish roe in my fish because there was goey orange stuff inside.  Gross.  Then I realized that was liquid, uncooked batter.  Then I poked around at the other two pieces of fish.  All three were swimming in 1/4 to 1/3 of inch of doughy, undercooked, and in case liquid batter.  It was inedible.  When I scraped it off, the fish underneath was not particularly attractive, nor do I believe that it was either halibut or cod as I believe the menu promised.
