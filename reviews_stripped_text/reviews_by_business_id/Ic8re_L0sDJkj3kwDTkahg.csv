We ordered almost everything and everything was delicious! I had Catfish with mac & cheese and greens - AMAZING! My boyfriend had ribs (falling off the bone and so flavorful, no sauce necessary!), Potatoe Salad and BBQ Beans (all perfectly tasty!). We also got Rib Tips (not to be missed!), Cornbread (moist & cakey-good!) and Fried Okra. We ate as much as we could and still had left overs! All this for under $40. GREAT BBQ AT A GREAT PRICE AND GREAT MUSIC! If you are on the Strip...GO!",Ov3uVR4pssKlJbgIMMWthg,1,0,5,sjGGsU_RaBNcOw0uzhYoLQ

Chicken had to be days old -- it fought with me as I tried to eat it...it was that tough.  A spicy link was sliced so thin and so dried out, I could have used em as pennies in a slot machine...the rib was edible, not great, but edible.  The mac & cheese was odd in a boxed kind of way with added cheese -- and the slaw was just an embarrassment, not even slaw, but shredded old cabbage with something wet on it...  No one other than my co-worker and I ate there during the hour we were there.  He had a pathetic excuse for a pulled pork sammich and hushpuppies (""that take 15 minutes to make..."") puhleeeese... with bbq beans from a can.

And if you're interested, he does serve ""desert"" on his menu.  I wasn't interested in sand that day...and since lunch was so unimpressive, I thought why add insult to injury...

I hope his catering business is better (he claimed to do whole hog, etc...), because the food he's servin' up at this empty, dirty, tired, junk filled, embarrassment of a restaurant isn't acceptable to this Southern bbq aficionado, nor to anyone she knows...  

Sorry Harry...

p.s.  You do have a sweet jukebox though.  Perfect bbq eatin' tunes -- too bad it wasn't on the whole time we were there, if only to fill that sad empty space...and muffle the sound of me trying to eat chicken jerky.

pps.  For 2, it was, and I'm not joking, $35.",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,4,1,1,W5kUmaLa5T2nJQTVuHsypA

As I mentioned before it is the ONLY eatery in walking distance from the business park I work in. 

So reluctantly I entered through their doors again. First thing I noticed upon entering was the wall sized paper menu with black magic marker drawn through half of the menu items. 

Looks like the nixed all the appetizers,salads,hamburgers,catfish tacos and OKRA. Raised Sweet Potato Pie to $3.95/slice. 

Well the only things you can get on the NEW menu for under $5 is Seasoned Fries for $3.95 or Hot Link Samich w/side of potato chips or potato salad. 

I went for the later-BBQ Hot Link Samich w/potato salad.$3.95-Not bad. 

I was completely suprised to see a poppy seed HAMBURGER bun when I opened my to-go container since I had ordered a link. 

They slice the link into pepperoni thin slices and smother it in super spicy but bland bbq sauce and a doughy bun. WTF!! :( 

I had faith that by ordering a link I was playing it safe, I mean how the F*#% can you screw up a HOT LINK Samich. Harry O's has figured it out. Slice it to shit,smother it and pretend it's bbq. 

Bad location, competing with super popular Polaris Street Cafe and the taco truck in the neighborhood. 

Food is way overpriced takes way too long -I mean Famous Dave's has a full rack rib meal for $20. Here they want $30 and I never smelled any smoke in this place. What gives?!? 

Definitely not worth the money or the wait. 1/2 star for giving it a go.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,17,8,1,EJKRUVzKuyPZX1saeJPsTA
