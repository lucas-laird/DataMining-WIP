I went in to get my order at this tiny window that has no line of sight so you're left waiting awkwardly because you can't see them and they can't see you. Then I'm told with my order one item was not available. I simply asked them to take it off the order and was told ""no I can't"". I'm sorry what? So I'm not getting the product I ordered, yes you offered something else that was not wanted, but refuse to take the expense off if the offered replacement is not taken? This makes zero sense to me.

Last time I ordered wings and a pizza, they made wings but not the pizza. The time before that I was told 25 mins to come pick up. I get there and I have to wait an additional 20 more mins because they weren't ready, I'm guessing they messed up someone else's order. On top of that my 1/4 sheet was missing one of my toppings. 

Today, I ordered a pizza and wings w/fries. I check my order, the pizza has the wrong toppings and the wings don't have fries. This place is really frustrating bc the food is awesome! Unfortunately the staff can't be trusted to do anything right. Ironically there is always different people working every time. They will fix the mistakes but by the time I get home my wings or my pizza is cold and nasty. Just get it right the first time! Is that to much to ask?

3271957,2017-01-28,1,MYB1ZMspBk1Xc_awp_PtSw,"Doesn't seem sanitary to me...

I was extremely excited to try this place because of reviews and photos of their pizza online. I base almost everything off of reviews because reviews from peers always tell the story, granted there are always garbage reviews that are negligible...regardless. My experience was terrible. 

First off, if you step inside you will be disgusted, unless you like ordering food in a smoke pit. Went early evening, left in two minutes smelling like an ash try. The guy working there was super nice, however, the woman was extremely rude to the other employee while he was taking our order. Talking in a condescending fashion to him and yelling at him while he was talking to us. Not a great second impression. Once we were told it would be a 40 min wait we decided to leave and come back next time to try it, didn't feel like waiting tonight. After leaving (after two minutes like previously stated), I couldn't believe how much we smelled of smoke. Thinking about it, this concerned me as this pizza shop is constantly open to the bar. I don't like the idea of my food being exposed to smoke 24/7 prior to it even getting prepared.

I see other reviews talking of the smoke and most with people ordering delivery. If those of you who order delivery saw the atmosphere your food is prepared in i'm sure you wouldn't be as enthused about the product.

Don't get me wrong, I love bar food and frequent others in town, however, the cook area is never open to the smoke area...never in my experience! Whether it's a door or something that divides them. The ordering window is always open meaning the food is always exposed and at this point, all the food back there has been soaking in the smoke of all the people at the bar for the last few weeks...disgusting the more I think about it. 

In the end, never ate the product, although I'm sure it might be good, just might try another location...definitely not this one",a6thTAUapNv1gAGpL34PRQ,1,0,1,L2MSUR1jdfRTi4iIUnpQ_g

My experience last night brought my rating down to a 3.
I was beyond exited for Naked Coty Pizza to open right down the street from me in Mnt Edge. I had been to their original location inside Moon Doggies and was a fan!! (Not to mention they were featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives....huge fan of that show too)
So what happens when it's pouring down rain all day and the mommy doesn't want to cook...you order pizza of course.
I looked on Yelp at the reviews and menu and the NCP website where they suggested Uber Eats so I downloaded the app and was ready to order.
I placed my order around 5pm and the app said delivery would be around 556pm.... perfect timing because I usually do dinner around 6pm!!
Let's talk food... I ordered one 1/4 sheet which is 6 slices and two 1/2 sheet pizza along with wings and fingers and garlic fries. 
Food is on point sauce on the pizza is a tad salty and pizza could have used a couple more toppings but whatever it's freaking good!!!
Now to the problem.... like I said Uber Eats quoted delivery around 556pm and I know it's not always accurate but my delivery time jumped to 651pm at the time I was supposed to be receiving my food.
After 2 calls to Uber Eats they finally were told by the restaurant that they didn't see my order so they hadn't made it so that's why they added an hour to my time.
I get it mistakes happen but they could have called...it was their mistake.
Anyway we finally got our food around 642 and we were so hungry I didn't take pics but trust me when I say it's GOOD!
I will order again and hope we get the food on time.
Best of luck NCP you have a great product!!",6gLAjpSE6Cw092SGqZliNg,1,0,3,8TugHVYRwnHBGLUgGwcqng

Depending on how long you have to wait for your pizza, you can potentially come out smelling like an ashtray. 

Pizza: we ordered the Back Home which, for the most part, was good just a little too salty for my taste. Not sure if it was the sauce or the cheese or the sauce AND the cheese. 

We also ordered the garlic buns, which were salty as well and most were burnt on the bottom. 

I think next time we will try another pizza and give it another shot. Lastly, they don't have their own in-house delivery crew. You have to go thru Uber Eats or Bite Squad.

I was not feeling well otherwise I would have went myself. Anyway, email from grub hub said order should be here about 630-645. No problem maybe 30-45 min. Ended up arriving a little after 7. Once again, not a problem close enough. I eagerly grabbed the food from the delivery girl and ran inside with wife and children waiting. Upon opening the pizza box, I could tell it was a little over cooked (burnt by some standards). I figured well lets give it a shot. Took our first bites and it was like biting into stale cardboard lol. The crust was so hard my dog tried to bury it
In the yard and she never lets pizza crust go to waste. My wife says that it must be from freezing the dough and then cooking it. It was difficult to eat to say the least. So we said at least we have salad. We asked for Ranch to be put on the side if possible instead of vinaigrette and got vinaigrette anyway. Not sure if its an option. So our salad was supposed to have iceberg lettuce and spinach and contained only spinach. Luckily I had $10 off from grub hub otherwise if I would have spent almost $40 on a pizza and salad I would have been pissed for this kind of quality. If I am going to spend that kind of money for a pizza it should be as good as or better than Grimaldis up the road. Never had an issue there.

Its unfortunate because the staff and the location is great, but beware of using uber eats grubhub or delivery when you order from here... 

they cancelled an order or left out an item 3 times! Messaged Robert the General Manager and here is his response 

""I do appologize for this inconvienience but we no longer carry the steak subs at our paradise location. We have recently updated our menu and our deliverie services are still working on updating it on their end."" 

I checked their website and they still have the sandwiches up. I don't understand the need to lie. Don't blame a 3rd party delivery service when you don't even update your website.

Just to throw this in I owned three pizzerias in western New York myself for many years so I do know what I'm talking about. I'll make it fast and simple the dough used to make my pizza was called Dead dough , or garbage dough which makes the pizza not rise because the yeast is dead the pizza was terrible and I asked for extra sauce on my double orders of wings and they came  practically dry along with cold french fries. The order was 20 minutes late for my pick up and that is happened multiple times, and they raised the prices without even telling you or  changing the menu or website.

The sauce has an awesome level of spice and is flavorful. I added the roasted garlic crust for kicks, and OMG. It was like eating pizza combined with garlic bread. So good. I gave a special order; it was delivered accurately and on time. I think they also upgraded me to a full-size (huge) pizza for no additional charge! Thanks!

Worst experience with this Naked City. Gives the brand a serious bad name! Never coming back or ordering
