I went here using a Groupon and I wish I could get my money and my time back.  It was the worst tasting hamburger ever.  It is very overpriced and I will never go here again.  It took everything in me to eat most of my hamburger (only because I am not a fan of wasting food).  Usually when a person is hungry just about anything taste good.  When I arrived here I was starving and I still could not finish it.  I will not be coming back here ever again.,sVIkaZst5idzqtRh_uw8FQ,1,0,1,x504DDWbAjZFmNkja2SpxA
402537,2007-12-06,1,0p27EjcNwTI7Ey4K_MNPww,"Fatburger and In-N-Out are my favorite burger joints in Vegas.  Fatburger is more expensive but they have more variety in their menu (yes, I know about animal style and protein style).

The key trick for Fatburger is to get a discount card.  They punch it for every burger you get and when it is full, you get a freebie.  However, you have to ask for their card because they don't volunteer it and they don't ask if you have one.

Skinny fries are better than their steak fries.  Chili is pretty good with chili cheese fries a favorite side.  Onion rings are very good too.  The milkshakes are real old-fashioned shakes (similar but larger serving size to In-N-Out.)

If you eat very late, they are your best choice since they are 24 hours.  Sometimes you have to make some noise if they are in the back instead of manning the register, however.

They are made to order so you can get extra whatever.  The one thing I don't like versus In-N-Out in addition to being more expensive is that they use chopped onions.  You can get a fresh slice at In-N-Out and slices are better than chopped onions because there is less cell wall damage and water leakage.

This location is not as good as some of the other Fatburgers but a mediocre Fatburger is still better than the best McDonald's.",DBzVCu2k2z-l5nl0rbVqmg,6,4,5,oJQ2X-LTB9Wik3nVnbB4-g

For an ""order at the counter, sit in the food court"" fast food place, this place is extremely overpriced!!  Some meal combos are over 12 bucks (approaching gourmet burger prices at sit down places with MUCH more ambiance!).  Anyway, our tab ran almost 36 bucks for 3 turkey burgers, 2 fries, 1 shake and two sundaes for the girls.  Good thing we had the groupon to keep it more reasonable.  Of course, with what we got, this place was STILL overpriced after adding in the savings!  Turkey burgers were dry, tasteless and small.  Fries were very unremarkable, our vanilla shake was basically tasteless as well.  I don't know how these places charge as much as they do and still have people frequent them...  What a rip off!!  I will admit that the regular burgers did look pretty good but we were trying to go with somewhat healthier alternatives.  Anyway, if you are after burgers that don't run 40 bucks for a family of four, I think you are MUCH better off at In n Out or Smashburger!",dScCt1HWk1PoxC0gCOneDA,0,0,2,dysYXpYq3hxDtCS2TXmyqQ

Went here for a bite after watching ""The Expendables"" and came for a large burger and the skinny fries.

Personally, I think that there is a little too much bun for the size of the patty. But otherwise, the bun had a nice texture and flavour. The patty itself was well-seasoned however lacked thickness and wasn't as juicy as it should be. The iceberg was shredded and was a little too wet. It kind of messed up the textures in the burger. The sauces on top were rather uninteresting.

The fries are nice - crispy and well salted.

Fatburger is a legendary So Cal burger staple, with Ice Cube rappin' about it (""...Two in the mornin' got the Fatburger"") on his hit ""It was a Good Day"" 

I prefer it over In and Out, Five Guys, Johnny Rockets, The Counter, The Habit and most other over the counter non-fast food, cooked to order burger joints.

In LA, I usually get the Fatburger on the char grill and fat fries (as opposed to on the greasy grill with skinny fries)

In Vegas, I opted for another of my favorites, the Bacon and Egg sandwich.  It's really good, but tell 'em to skip the mayo and put on ketchup instead, it'll taste better.

Although it seems they are making an attempt to be a little healthier with their new crispy chicken wrap (tortilla wrapped fried chicken with all the burger fixings on the inside). I mean the menu is by no means healthy. It is called FATburger- due to the quantity of food and the calories associated with that food. But as I watched them make our burger, I noticed they were not premade patties and they were using what seemed like ""not previously frozen- but who knows"" ground beef. Also it didn't seem like they were using binders (egg or breadcrumbs) 
As we ate our burger noticed the burger was kinda dry, probably due to the amount of add ons and very little mayo. Def had to ask for extra Mayo.

We ordered the chicken sandwich and wrap with water.
Both the products were below avg taste, the mayo they use is either sub-standard or just lost its punch - maybe closer to expiry of product. 
But could be a pass but finding a human hair marinated in the Chicken patty, is not acceptable. Yuck - Killed our meal. The manager was shocked too and truly apologetic, offering to replace our meal

4051423,2012-11-04,2,0p27EjcNwTI7Ey4K_MNPww,"When it comes to FF burgers, everyone has their preferences.  With me, it comes down to mood, location, convenience, price, and service.  Mood usually dominates my decision.  However, my most recent visit to Fatburger wasn't due to mood. It was due to convenience and location. It was late night at the Red Rock Casino.  My choices were very limited, especially since I needed something with no carbs, a high protein count, and quick.  Fatburger was my only choice.  

Now it came to decision on what burger was I going to order.  The XXXL is way to big and the Large seemed too small.  I ended up with the XXL.  Since I wasn't eating the bun during this visit, I knew I could handle all of the 16 oz's that the XXL has to offer.  Their burgers are known for their seasoning and a healthy spread of their pickled mustard.  Sometimes their burgers are a bit dry.  That's where the condiments and bun come to play.  Without them, you will really notice how dry their burgers really are.  

What sets Fatburger from the rest is what I call their ""Breakaway Meat"".  The burgers at Fatburger are not compressed/packed patties causing them to break apart in your mouth.  I like it since it's different, the seasoning gets inside the meat better, and you feel the texture of a good burger in your mouth.  What would be perfect is their burger meat on top of rice.  Almost like a Loco Moco minus the egg and gravy. Bottom line, good burger that hit the spot for what I was looking for last night. 

The service was as good as it gets.  My only issue, which is not Fatburger's fault, was that the food court was dirty.  Tons of trash and tables needed to be wiped down.  I ended up eating at their counter because of this.  

I didn't have their fries, shakes, and even their bun on last night's visit.  I will be back to eat here the traditional way and update my review. 

TIP:
-You get big portions of meat in your burger and you decide what size you want. S, M, L (8 oz) , XXL (16oz), and XXXL (24 oz).",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,5,3,4,doOD7XZumkpgYHrmu1llAw

I don't know if this is strange, but my wife's favorite American food is Burgers. Having said that, we have been going out of our way, to try every Burger joint on the west-side. I have to say after trying: Farmer Boys(very good), Smash Burger(over rated), 5 Guys Burgers(worst burger, but insanely good Fries), Montana Meat Packing Co.(very good), In-N-Out(best service & wife's favorite), Red Robin(great, but pricey), Chilli's(so-so for the price), as well as the Real National Fast Foods: Burger King(best of the Nationals), Wendy's(love the Red Head in the commercials, burgers lack flavor), Carl's Jr(not bad, but also not great), McDonald's(a familiar friend, but never the first choice), Jack In The Box(hate the burgers, love everything else), & Sonic(way over-priced). We have not tried: Any Asian Burger joint, Gordon Ramsey's Burgr, Applebee's, Heart Attack Grill & White Castle.

After everything is said & done, Fatburger is still my favorite all-around Burger joint. Keep this in mind, I love a thick, juicy burger cooked Medium Rare to Medium, any more than that & I consider the burger to be burnt. I also love Fat/Steak fries or Potato Wedges. Fatburger has everything I look for in a Burger Joint.

The bad things people say about Fatburger: They take forever to make your food- yeah, this is true, but everything is made to order & I get the Fattest Burger, with Fat Fries & this gives me the perfect time to have a pre-meal smoke. Service is bad- Not True. I have been to almost all of the West-Side Fatburgers & have always had better service than a McDonald's or Burger King. Fatburger is pricey- yeah, this one is true, but if you eat as much as I do, I normally spend just as much at McDonald's or Burger King...... I just need 1 FatBurger, instead of ordering 4 normal fast food sandwiches/burgers.

The Skinny on Fatburger: If you love your burger, thick & juicy burgers & the option of  steak fries, Fatburger is the best California Chain Burger Joint.",ns0rK7adREikI6hwFA71Xg,2,2,5,zssPjliNgV01ic_7RakIsQ

I use to eat at Fatburgers ages ago because it was by my college campus, so convenience factor was there. But got converted once I discovered In-N-Out despite having to drive out to get it. Never looked back since. 

Funny thing happened, I was going to try LBS Burger so I asked the Fatburger employee where its at. Yup, I really did ask Fatburgers where I can find their competitor burger place is at. They didn't know.

Was at Red Rock waiting for the movie to start so just grabbed a bite here. For around $11 I got a really big burger and fries. I got a pretty good value based on the size of the burger and the fries, but flavor just didn't impress me. Much better than Fuddruckers. Fries were very good though with the clean and crispy flavor.
