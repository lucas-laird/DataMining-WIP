  First of all to have that many people order food and to all have their meals within 5-10 minutes of the first meal being brought out is super impressive and shows how well the staff work together. The manager (I believe his name was Shawn introduced himself and made sure anything we wanted was takes care of. Our servers name was Eric and what a fantastic guy!! Such patience for dealing with such a large group and so so sweet and professional.
    They truly made it an unforgettable experience. I'm going back again tomorrow and would highly recommend a visit to anyone!",-6_D3_aPhXsCcKzSAJhY9A,0,0,5,B8v4jMfrFH2OaOi8nMEnBw

The only reason we went was because my 13 and 15 yr old wanted to check it out.  There signature drinks did not have a price on the menu so we asked the waitress how much for the non-alcoholic Drake drink, she said $34, my kids decided it pretty steep and opted to pass on it, but my husband and I insisted they try it.  When the drink arrived they took a couple of sips and said it was not worth the price which made me and my husband proud, it was a great lesson in life, $34 may of been too steep for this novelty drink/restaurant but the experience was priceless.

I'm writing this review so nobody else has to endure the wretched experience at the sugar factory that I did. 

I don't mind spending money on food, although their food is a bit overpriced it didn't bother me to spend the money. We went for a special occasion, ordered three meals. Not only where the meals missing every possible thing we asked for, but when we told the waiter, ""you know maybe we could at least get the bread for the meal"" Nevermind the missing pecans, burnt French toast , and the wrong protein on the fettuccini...  but maybe we could at least get the bread..nope too much to ask for, ""would you like to pay was the response."" Ummm no I would like the correct meal, that would be nice. We paid..full price, which isn't the problem. The horrible meal, horrible service, and complete disregard for your customer is the problem. 
I will be sure to tell my clients what a mess this place is when they are asking for recommendations, seeing as I work in the mall.

I made reservations (for 14) to celebrate my birthday here. Once we got there at our reservation time, they had no tables to sit us at. That's when the hostess asked if we wanted to sit upstairs in the chocolate lounge. Sure. Once upstairs and got settled in. We ordered our drinks. Then we ordered our food. Sitting for 30min we still have NOT received our drinks we ordered. Our drinks FINALLY came as well as only half of our tables food order. The rest of us sat for several more minutes until a couple more of our dishes came out. At this point we were waiting on 2 steak entrees for the last food to come out (steak bordelaise and steak bearnaise). It came totally wrong!!! My friend ordered hers med-well and my BF ordered his med-rare. Their steaks were mixed up on each others plates. And to top it off, they gave mushrooms (in a plastic container) instead of caramelized onions on what was supposed to be my BF Steak Bordaise. The server did not seem to care and blamed the kitchen staff on their mistake. We had to ASK for the carmelized onions!! Obviously, it's her job to make sure the food she's delivering is the right order. A friend ordered the alfredo and it came out like a kids meal size. Wth. We also did not receive an appetizer until after our dinner. The busser kept coming around trying to clear off plates that we were still working on, seeming like they were trying to hurry our meal and get us out. They also won't split checks for you. 
I really wanted to come here to celebrate my birthday with friends and try their desserts but after the terrible service We just skipped dessert to get out of there.  So bummed this place could've been fun. 

This place is
1)overpriced for the quality you're getting

Not only was she extremely attentive from the moment we had sat down, she was funny, friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable with answers to any questions we had about their extensive menu (which is a lot to look through! But it was impressive how many different options they have food & drink wise, our party of 7, 4 of which were young children were all able to find exactly what we wanted to eat even though each meal was vastly different from the others). Also following her suggestions on desserts turned out to be the most beautifully hand-crafted ""insane"" milkshakes, (including one with an entire slice of cheesecake on the top, one with cotton candy and Skittles and one with a bacon cheeseburger to top it!) And they taste as delicious as they look!! I had the club sandwich and although it was HUGE in portion sjze, I couldn't stop myself from eating more and more. My husband got the steak and lobster tail which was cooked to perfection and although pricey, completely worth every cent! We ordered the white gummy worm goblet with alcohol and we're pleased to find out we could order any of them without the alcohol also for the kids. They enjoyed the lollipop and ocean blue goblets. The beer selection is a little slim but we were pleased even more when our waitress assured us it was a full bar not limited to the menus cocktails and martinis only, so my sister in law enjoyed a vodka soda. The bruchetta and spinach and artichoke dip were definitely a great meal starter. We enjoyed dinner in the chocolate lounge upstairs and loved the atmosphere. We will definitely be returning next time we are in town!!

Both the dessert my wife wanted (plain cheesecake) and the one I did (mudslide ice cream sandwich) were 86'd. By the way, it's great when waitstaff uses lingo with customers (sarcasm). So we both ended up getting different ice cream sandwiches and coffee. So we thought. Nope. They were out of coffee. What??? How do you run out of coffee? So we go the SF Cappuccino which is just plain 'ol cappuccino except it's $8 we found out when we got the bill. And it was gross. Extremely bitter. Kinda like me after this visit. The ice cream sandwiches were just ice cream between 2 rock hard cookies that you couldn't cut through. You'd think the cookies would be soft, no? Ya know, edible. 

The service wasn't any better. We had to ask for sugar because he didn't bring it with the $16 worth of cappuccinos. He never came back to ask if everything was okay. He seemed more interested in what music was blaring overhead. Then he disappeared for a good 15 minutes while we were waiting for our check. We had to stop him as he walked by to ask for the check. Which then took another 5 minutes for him to bring. And don't get me wrong, it was not busy at all...so there's no reason it should have taken him that long.

When it was located at the Paris hotel this was an awesome place. Great food and service.  Then they moved to Fashion mall, it sucks big time. I went there when they reopened and had bad service and the food tasted bad. They took off the menu, the great tasting drinks. My Well done  hamburger was raw. sent it back and it came back medium. Just ate it and left. My wife's club sandwich was dry. 

We tried it again on my birthday. Again, really bad service, several of our party had to send their food back. We bought a Big Smokin drink for the kids for $35.00. mostly filled with ICE. about 10 oz of fruit punch and very little smoke. we sent it back because the fruit punch was sour and tasted like crap. the kids hated it. it was suppose to be a sweet drink. My BLT bacon was raw.  We all left their vow to never come back.  HOWEVER. 

Last week my wife and I were at Wynn and she bought a groupon for breakfast at the Sugar Factory. So we though, How bad can they ruin breakfast? Well they did. I ordered an Eggs Benedict and my wife got a Bacon egg croissant.  Mine came with salmon on it, and my wife got a ham croissant sandwich with no egg. I told the guy who brought it that it was wrong and he goes, OH and walks away. We finally got our waitress  to sent it back.  30 min later, I got my eggs benedict cold. my with got bacon and eggs. eggs were raw and bacon was raw. We talked to the manager who was ruid and she said she would comp  another meal for my wife to go. I just ate mine cold. so they took back her bacon and eggs and she ordered a Club to Go. So basically we gave them a groupon for 2 meals, I ate one, sent one back and the Club was suppose to be free. we got a bill for 3 meals. I was pissed. she said she would take that off and then came back and wanted $5.00 for tax. 20 min later still no Club. At that point my wife and I left. NO CLUB. $60 groupon for a cold egg benedict.  
The next day we went to Denny's got 2 breakfast for $14.50 and it was hot and yummy and quick.",Gp9tggWe55Gbtx67PphdNg,0,0,1,PTa_lRmFY-0U-xb-Ex-hoQ
1098735,2017-05-11,1,-oUM2uISux96lMGeawHIOA,"I hosted a small get together the other night for the local chapter of a collective I'm part of and we had the best time! I had reached out to the restaurant in advance to make sure everyone could pay with separate checks and make sure they could accommodate us as we needed and they were so helpful. When I got to the restaurant, they took me to a corner booth and helped me set up all of our materials. Our host answered any and all questions and stayed to make sure our small group had all arrived and we were settled (Thanks again, Madison!). Our server, Jason, took amazing care of us as did the rest of the staff who kept our water glasses full and made sure we had everything we could possibly need. 

We had the Rainbow Sliders which were so yummy (and super photogenic) and three of the craziest milkshakes I've ever seen in my life (Twinkie Dinkie, Tie Dye, Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake). I literally had a slice of cheesecake sitting on top of my milkshake! My club sandwich was so big it's literally served as three meals ($16 might sound pricey but given it's been three lunches, it's a good deal). When it was time for our bills, they were brought out separately as discussed in advance with absolutely no fuss. That never happens anywhere! One of the managers even gave us a tour of the chocolate lounge upstairs and offered to take photos for us in front of all the cool displays.

I was a HUGE fan of the original Sugar Factory when it first opened inside Paris Hotel and Casino. I rarely go to one place multiple times but Sugar Factory was my favorite place to frequent (and that says a lot). When the menu changed I wasn't happy and I didn't love the incarnation at Town Square. I wasn't sure what to expect of this new location but when I walked in I was thrilled. It has the same look and feel of the original and the menu even has the original items (many of which were removed when the menu was remodeled). If you eat here, make sure to go upstairs to see all of the displays outside the chocolate lounge! It's an Instagram dream come true (especially the miniature carousel). Yes, the restaurant is ornate and over the top but it's Las Vegas, get over it. 

Thank you Madison, Jason, Mery and all the wonderful staff at Sugar Factory for making our gathering so amazing! I can't wait to come back!!!",3CMiTAhq_o_GP1tLs-ihbg,4,3,5,cGUBdgBm1x0pZfWFgkE9uw

We went, wish we didn't. We had to park on the opposite side of the mall because the gates were locked by the Macy's and there was a convention so no parking near there. That's fine. By this time it's about 930am and we are standing outside of S.F., the doors were locked, someone inside flashes me 10 fingers, my assumption they open at 10, since there were no hours posted outside. However on the Groupon it says they open at 9am? I brought that to the servers attention when we finally do go inside. He said he told the manager, hopefully they will fix that sooner than later, especially since it wouldn't let me leave a review on Groupon since I waited to buy it, just to make sure the there wasn't any other specifics. Thank goodness, I would have been even more angry. Mind you I am feeling pretty hangry, walking around for 30 because they can't seem to post the right time on the promotional ad. Also the sever says ""we do open at 9 Sat.&sun."" I said ""ok but the Groupon says only valid Mon.-fri."" That makes sense thanks for clearing it up. Ok, I'm ready to eat, the Groupon says let your server know you are using a Groupon before ordering. Ok. Then tells us the only dish available for the Groupon is the on in the picture on Groupon although the highlight promote pancakes and waffles which is what I wanted. 2 eggs, 1 slice of French toast, country potaoes, and 2 pieces of meat was in the pic. Ok. I thought wow! The Groupon value is $60 and I'm paying $36 at 40% off. Oh and the Groupon is for specifically only for 2 people. If we did decide to order off the menu, what we wanted it would have been less than $60, hold less than $36! What was the deal breaker was we were going to settle for the breakfast in the picture, we were already there and starving, we told the server we don't eat meat if we could sub it for some toast or fruit. That was an issue, he said he has to ask the chef. Came back and said they just budget the Groupon for what's in the picture but we could sub for a cup of berries this time. Budget for what's in the picture?! $60 worth I guess wasn't enough for toast instead of meat.

Food was gross sent back a couple things (waitress even said meat looked terrible) the ""fried"" ice cream my bf ordered was soup and disgusting.

Came with some friends ate, had the kind kong sundae. Our friends gifted us a groupon we used for 2 duck drinks, at the end of the meal were told we cannot use the groupon with the 50% and we cannot use the groupon on a separate check (in a group couldnt split the check I am pretty sure they could but ok probably just wanted auto gratuity cause I definitely would not have tipped)  Waiter said he told us that in advance and no he did not.

1219814,2017-05-16,0,-oUM2uISux96lMGeawHIOA,"First off, my friend and I were walking around yesterday and came across Sugar Factory and were super excited because we thought they no longer exist seeing how the Hexx took its place at the Paris hotel. The host greets us and asks if we want to sit at the outside bar, which we asked if it would be ok if we sit inside seeing how it was super windy and we were cold. He sat us in front of the door which made us feel like we might as well just sat at the outside bar. We tried asking to move, but that ended up making things more complicated. I tried to say it was totally fine, seeing how I do understand how a restaurant and hosting system works due to the fact that I've been a waitress for 7 years and understand that things just can't happen. But then a manager came and said that he was going to have the door closed for us, which made it worse because I knew that was a shortcut for waiters and bussers and tried telling him it was really fine. So the manager did it anyways and told all the waiters and bussers that they had to go around and I could hear one of the waiters talking how over the top it was and that we should just move and even our own waiter was annoyed with us which made me feel mortified. We sat right in front of the door which is right next to the bartender and every time they walked by our table, it was just them talking about us. Now the fun part, our food. My friend got the turkey burger which was super dry and looked like someone sat on it. I got the white chocolate burger and it was like our waiter, rare. It was cold and not even close to cooked. I couldn't ask for them to take it back one because I felt bad for causing so much inconvenience and two because our waiter checked on us once. I really do understand the frustration and patience one has to have in this industry and honestly, my friend and I weren't in a big hurry and would of waited for a different seat and I understand that the reason certain tables aren't opened is because it's a closed off section that's either for the closing shift or someone who's section is cut off due to the fact that they're about to leave, but we asked the host for inside away from the cold and he dropped us in front of the opened door and when we asked if we could get something else he had this attitude that said take it or leave it. Cool. Again, I totally understand when it's busy and you just hope the customer just goes with it, but hey, that's the job; and if you're going to talk crap about a customer, do it in the back, not right in front of them where we clearly can hear you. Of course when I asked for the check, that was when he was super attentive. Probably couldn't wait for us to leave. Check was over $100 for awful food and average drinks. Still left a nice tip because I felt horrible the entire time. So sad that it was so awful, I've been looking forward to coming here once I turned 21 and it was a complete let down. Just another overpriced store, average service, hyped up because it's on the strip. Definitely won't be back.",GjaW9q4AK_uNBI3L80BOiw,0,0,2,8B1Ut0U9_xDUji76QwqRZQ

That is neither here nor there, we came with a group of us who had gotten a Groupon deal on a couple of the huge Duckie alcoholic slushies and thank goodness we did. The prices are insanely high from what I saw on the menu but for Vegas I guess that is to be expected.

So we order...it takes forever to get our coffee which is cold and the orange juice the kids ordered comes when they are almost done eating. The OJ was GROSS, dark in color. We got our meals & mine was the completely wrong thing. So the waiter takes it back & brings me what I ordered. My husband got an omelette that had no taste & some toast. No butter or jelly is offered for the toast, so he asks for jelly. About 10 minutes goes by & he asks again for jelly & now fresh toast. The waiter told us they were getting fresh jelly out of the fridge...what?!?! What, really...it takes over 10 minutes to get jelly out of the fridge...ummmm ok. 

Now the coffee situation...you would think that when you order coffee you would get a hot cup of coffee...no, not here. And when we asked for new, hot coffee the waiter brings one cup and tells us that is the last cup & their coffee maker is broken and the coffee they got from Starbucks is gone. WTF! Seriously! 

Now, I expect a place to be very nice when I'm paying $15-$18 for one breakfast dish. Not the case. As I stated both tables were wobbly, the crevice around the table had old, nasty food in it, NO COFFEE, black cloth napkins stuffed under table legs to make the tables not wobble & there were wires hanging down from a chandelier. It is really the little things this place is missing! It's all the little things that add up! 

We will never, ever go back. The manager did offer for us to come back later for dessert...nope, no thank you, not even for free!

Update to this review: we did get our meal for free. This still did not change the experience we had. I'd rather pay full price & have 5-star experience! 

After I posted this review we were offered to come back. Management said they would make a reservation & provide us with a 5-star experience. I accepted as our kids really wanted to have a huge milkshake. Then I get another message stating she didn't realize our meal had been comped & she was confused that I still gave a one star review. Really? I was a little shocked. Yes, our meal was comped because it was a horrible experience. I was told they would give the kids free milkshakes and basically asking me to post another review & make it positive. I declined & then was told basically that I am trying to take advantage of them. 

Really think about choosing a different restaurant if you are considering this one!",f_cFLh1ecmYjd1yeo-93-w,4,0,1,nUVFSm9T07UA4bLbhmpZ3A

Menu is a book so took us 20 min or so to look at everything. It was apparent they were closing. Nice waiter was the only saving grace. Milkshakes come out at the time we are told they are out of the ice cream flavor that was to come on our sundae. So as you can see the sundae hadn't been started. He offers us different flavors. We are fine with that. We ask what are the options. No list of flavors. We had to get up to go see and when we did most didn't even have a label so no idea what the were. We settled on 2 flavors but very unimpressed with 2 of them.  Our sundae comes out and immediately I think something is missing. No crushed Oreos and no caramel. This is a signature sundae not something we created. We ordered coffee figuring we'd warm up with it while we waited and it didn't come until the ice cream. It was awful.  5.00 a cup we expected better flavor and the option of more than one cup. They took off for the sundae. We asked to remove the coffee and he was not happy about it. Manager says ""you drank the cup right?""  The one late arriving bad coffee. Used a Groupon thank goodness but was still very expensive. Totally not worth it.

1373508,2017-07-04,0,-oUM2uISux96lMGeawHIOA,"Sugar Factory is an ok experience. The food lacked flavor. The service started out great but gets noticeably bad the last 75% of your time there. The music is really loud. The tables are small while the plates are huge- my friend had to put her plate in her lap because there was no where else on the dinky table. The prices for the Goblets are high so look for check in deals on Yelp and other voucher websites or skip them altogether. I'd go back with the realization that their Happy Hour sucks. 

We went after reading about the happy hour and what a rip-off. I'd have been more pleased if the Goblets were 50% off- end of story. Inside the server said buy one Goblet and get select apps for $3. I figured it was a great deal and thought you could choose 2 or 3 apps for $3 each, I mean the Goblet is the price of an entree at dinner for goodness sake. Well you could only choose ONE app at that price PER Goblet. I chose the burger thinking I was getting a great deal. Not so much. The burger came out and it was honest to goodness the size of a slider! It was not as others have posted pictures of who went earlier when the restaurant first opened. They honestly thought I was going to pay $3 for that little thing. The server, while nice and all smiles, failed to mention that. I'm not a greedy person but these servers should learn how to describe what they are selling their patrons. 

I sent the slider back and ordered a burger. The table next to us suffered the same fate and they sent their little slider back too and asked for a traditional sized sandwich which is $13. That burger didn't arrive for 20 minutes. Three people walked by and kept saying ""itll be right out"". I wasn't in a hurry, but at a certain point you start to notice. The burger arrived and it was cooked medium (noticeably pink in the middle) so I'm not sure what took so long to cook it. lt looked great and juicy but it lacked ANY and ALL seasoning. It was bland as shit and there was no salt in sight. Even with the crispy onions strings they didn't help.

The Goblet was great but you'd get sticker shock if they listed the price of them on the menu in fact they don't list the price for ANY of their drinks. I despise sneaky restaurants that do that. You have to ask the server and it becomes a talking point when it shouldn't be. $39 for a drink is not chump change for any time of the day. On top of that they ran out of all citrus fruits at the bar- no lemons for the water, no limes for the vodka soda and no lemons for my $39 Iced Tea Vodka drink. The server had the audacity to bring over 1 (One) sad lemon slice from the end of a lemon with all the white pith on a big plate. It wasn't enough juice in that thing to squeeze a drop in a thimble. During dinner a server walks in from the back with bags of citrus fruits from the local grocery store. Who is running this operation? Get it together.

Towards the end of the meal, as usual, the server disappears and we have to ask random people and managers to bring us our check.This has become an annoying part of dining out lately. You'll get great service at the start and then it tapers off dramatically to no service at all- then they hoover over you to leave a 20% tip, but were absent the last 75% of the meal. Oddly they don't even have check presenters here. Everything is ordered and check is presented on a ipad style device. Its quick, but we never were presented with a itemized bill when they swiped our credit card or after the charge was processed. Its best to ask for a bill BEFORE paying and keep a tally of the charges.",4vj_0BQeXjCyNB7ESS5mGg,0,0,3,8-fLzkUe5EEfyfZm0N35TA

Warning Sign 1..
They have hype guys standing outside trying to get people to come in. They flash the menu and try to convince you they have amazing foods/drinks. We were kinda hesitant. But then he mentions a 2-for-1 appetizer deal. My friends were all about that, and I was out voted. So we went in. I had a bad feeling by that time. If you ever walk by a strip club that has hype guys outside, it's a clear sign the talent inside ain't so great. Same concept here with a restaurant. Read on.

Warning Sign 2..
We were seated. I flipped through the menu and noticed that the cocktails were very prominent, with lots of large and colorful pictures. The food.. not so much. They're listed in the back part of the menu. Hardly any pictures. Just generic descriptions and tourist prices. Also, we asked about the 2-for-1 appetizer deal. Our waiter kindly informs us that it's only valid if you buy a cocktail. Something the hype man outside neglected to tell us.

Warning Sign 3..
We were ready to order. Our waiter came over and tried to punch in our order on his handheld thing. But it wasn't working. He went off to grab another one and came back about 10 minutes later. But that one didn't work either. So he wrote down our order with pencil and pad. Lol. 

Warning Sign 4..
Food took forever. The place was practically empty. So I'm not sure what the delay was. Maybe the staff was on their lunch break, eating at another restaurant?

And we finally got our food. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich. Oh boy, what I actually got was a big plate of disappointment. I could tell it was microwaved or precooked. Even though it was covered in buffalo/wing sauce, the breading looked obviously soggy as if it was sitting around for a while. Also, the menu says it was supposed to be on a brioche bun. It was served on plain old wheat bread like you get from the supermarket. And I really knew it wasn't fresh cooked because when I bit into it, it was warm. Not steaming hot like normal fried chicken sandwiches. The fries were the only thing that was good. 

So after my underwhelming dining experience, I came to the conclusion that this is a bar masquerading as a restaurant. Based on the enormous and somewhat comically fruity drinks and desserts, the target demographic for this place is for 20-30 year old girls, for a ""girls night out"" type of thing.

It's around $4-$5 more for any day (includes Fri-Sun) GroupOn. We arrived in town on Thursday so we had dinner there on our first night. 

We got seated right away since, I guess, Mon. To Thurs. is not a busy night. As soon as we were seated, I regret our decision. As a family, we like to look at the menu and talk about our choices but I could barely say a word without screaming because the music was so loud!!!!!! I guess they don't want you to talk to anyone you are with and have a nice conversation over food.

The next regret came when we saw the prices on the menu. With the $40 GroupOn we got one order of $20 rainbow sliders, 5 tiny pieces so it comes out to $4 each where you get two bites each out of it. We also got one order of $19 shake which came with a bonus tiny slider.

I was going to check in to Yelp to get 50 percent off one of the smoking goblet but I was told that I cannot combine it with the GroupOn. Lucky break that I realized later on since I would rather spend my money elsewhere. 

The worst part was being seated next to the elevator where all night long scantily dressed women were brought up there by the wait staff. That must be their free ticket to get up there. There's not that much space in between the elevator and our table so it's a bit distracting. The elevator is also close to another room where the wait staff keeps going in and out. This must be how it felt like to be seated next to the restroom. 

This place is just hyped up by the Kardashian family and other celebrities. We go to Vegas at least once a year and this is definitely one of those one time visit only.",ggMXpv04cdr_1QK8DISKjQ,6,0,1,MBWkYmeN72iCixaPDEPqFg

First I thought I can use the Groupon but then they say I can't use it bec I have to have 4 people to be able to use it. So I wasn't able to use it and that's a bummer .   Then I checked out the store . Ok so what is the difference between this store compared to the other candy stores ? Actually it's only the name and the plastic goblet that says sugar factory and that's it . All of the candies here u may find it in any candy store . They don't have any signature candy or chocolate like See's candies or ghirardelli So anyways I still got myself some chocolate covered gummy and nuts . 
      On to our dining experience , the decor of the restaurant is ok nothing really fancy. Since it's a sugar factory I would expect more sugar decor lol . But it's just an ordinary restaurant type of decor . We got the orders right away and my kid ordered the berry bliss and it was really great to experience it . Me and  my friend ordered fettuccine . So the food came , my kid was delighted to see the smokey berry bliss . My guess is that they put dry ice on the bottom , add some berries and then when it's time to serve , the server pour the cocktail (without the alcohol) to the big goblet and then it starts to smoke . Pretty neat. Then the lunch was served , my son ordered the chicken with waffle . It's a big serving but the taste is not that great the chicken is salty. The waffles didn't come with any fruit or whip cream . And IHOP waffles tasted better than this one . Onto our fettuccine oh my gosh it is way salty to my taste oh my goodness what's wrong with me everything I taste always taste salty . But how come the other pasta restaurant doesn't taste salty at all ? 
       So at least I got a great talk with my long time friend who's based from Vegas . Then I got the bill . The berry bliss in the goblet was $30 so I thought maybe the goblet is free that we can bring it home . But no . The price is  $30 it's only great to experience it . So that's another bummer and so I have to buy it from the store if I want and it cost $20 . Well that's it I cannot say I fully recommend it . If u want to experience it why not go ahead but be aware ur paying way too much . I wouldn't recommend to eat the salty foods that you may order anywhere else but I would recommend the goblet if you want to experience it .",XsaNRd2rkWjrYjghyVheOA,3,2,2,IA4ETRqcfoDfGTYKMdIUpQ

We started with the delicious Bruschetta & I ordered the Rib Eye dinner and she ordered the Steak Frites. Both of our steaks came out exactly how we ordered them, ""medium rare"" it' was perfect.

We had the pleasure of meeting 2 restaurant managers and yes they are involved and seemingly never fail to check on any and all of us patrons.  The rest of the staff we came in contact with were attentive and a pleasure to meet. We finished it of with the Turtle Cheese cake, oh WOW, a must have!!!  Upon our farewell we personally expressed our compliments and gratitude to the gentleman named Mike (1 of the 2 managers we met) and Adrien our server. Not realizing there was an upstairs Mike personally took us on an upstairs tour of the rest of this Amazing Candy Land where there were having ladies night every Thursday's (btw).

To start off, Ms. Mercedes, our hostess, was such an incredible host and helped make our time there really extraordinary. I wish I could remember the name of my waitress because she also deserves all of the praise I can give. The Sugar Factory is one stop in Vegas that I recommend everyone makes.

I loved the location of this place, in the heart of the strip. It was alive and full of fun people and all of the staff was very welcoming and professional. You can also take your drink to walk around if you haven't finished it during your stay (which, unfortunately, I finished mine).

Which brings me right to the drinks. I had the ""Energy Bear Goblet"". Now I'm not really a sweets person, but this was a special occasion so I decided to bite the bullet. This was so fantastic. From presentation to taste, this was a very quality drink. 

I also had the buffalo chicken sandwich and if everyone isn't ordering this, they're really doing themselves dirty. A fantastically cooked chicken with a delicious sauce and awesome toppings. So good, there was no way I could finish this and a goblet.

And if I haven't raved about the staff enough (I haven't), the service was impeccable. From the entrance to service to everything. It was a friend's birthday and Mercedes would not let her get out of the birthday dessert and song. Which was fun, and made us feel very warm and welcome.

My group and I went here yesterday for our ladies night I was excited to go here since it was my first time and I had seen before that they have these cool drinks to chose from. When we got here we waited almost an hour maybe more to get seated which they kept giving us the run around. When we did get seated we were put in the back of the restaurant close to the kitchen, to be honest I think that table was pulled from outside and placed wherever since our group was becoming impatient from waiting for an hour they figure they just put us anywhere. When our waiter came to the table we ordered a watermelon goblet he said he would bring waters which we didn't get till 30 min later. For the price of that drink I would think it would have enough liquor but it tasted like juice instead. We pretty much didn't see our waiter since he was more concerned about a bigger party that he was taking care of. When he did come to the table we ordered another goblet, we sat and waited for almost 35 min and still no drink, by this time we were already disappointed with the service that the first waitress I saw I asked her to find our waiter and ask him to bring us the check.

Chicken and waffles
Chicken Alfredo pasta

I highly recommend the following: 

This establishment is known for it's gobblett drinks, virgin or with alcohol. Either way the taste is a burst of energy. It's an item on the menu that comes in different ways, a must try on your first experience. The gobblett is sharable so the price fits the portion, $35.00 bucks. 

If you want to put a smile on mine or my girl's faces gimme some ice cream 16 flavors of them with sparkles! The King Kong is presented with all the glitter and glam and is announced with importance! The whole restaurant is dimmed for the King Kong has arrived! All eyes on the King Kong as the sparkles light the way to your table. I tried the coffee, mango sherbet,  and blue bubblegum. The ice cream is lit! The presentation and the taste match its price, $80 bucks.

We waited what felt like 20mins until I had to get up and ask a bartender if he could send someone to get our drinks and that we were ready to order. 
The manager than comes to take our order and you would think he would be apologetic after I had to wait and ask for service but no.. didn't bother him ..
We ordered our food and drinks. 
We waited no lie 30mins for sliders and a burger philly. The manager did however come by and said ""it shouldn't be much longer"" .. which really means .. ""it's still going to be awhile"" 
There was only two waitress it wasn't busy for a Saturday night (11/4/17)they both had large parties of 10 and 15 no other tables just those two parties. If you can't handle a table of 2 let you're manager know .. 
The waitresses looked confused and didn't know who's meals was who's when the large parties food came out, they were auctioning food. 
Our food came out and my bf asked for  medium well burger and it wasn't. My rainbow sliders were not bad. 
The busser did come by and asked how we were doing and refilled our drinks which I very much appreciated it. 
The manager also than came by later to ask how was everything. 
When we were done we waited another 15mins to see if anyone would come by. No one came, I easily could had walked out the restaurant without paying because no one attending us. 
I AGAIN HAD TO GET UP AND ASK FOR MY BILL!! 
My bf and I don't ever complain or make smart mouth remarks or ever call a manager. We're respectful and we try giving the benefit of the doubt. But this was one of the worst service we've had. So bad I had to make my first yelp review.

2. Calamari- keep in mind it is like tempura style (fluffy and airy- slightly seasoned) I really enjoyed the calamari because it seemed not as greasy
*please note they do not have tarter sauce and have marinara 

For dessert we got the cookie jar sundae (meant for 2 people)- it was massive there were 4 of us and we barley made a dent. The ice cream is from San Francisco and absolutely delicious.

I use to go to the Sugar Factory at the Paris for years! It was amazing, never had a problem. When they closed I was Devastated. I was excited when they open a new at Fashion Show. I decided to go for my birthday, we went on Saturday, May 13th, I called and made a reservation. We went to the chocolate lounge because I was excited for their menu compared to down stairs menu. Every time I passed by when shopping at fashion show I would look at their menu board outside. I was so excited! 
Well we get there and they don't even have the menu available. Strike 1. The place was completely empty. (Red flag) we were the only customer for a long time. 
We order, it takes an hour for our drinks and food. Food was cold. It was the menu from downstairs. We were the only people there. I was trying not to cry. My friends had asked for sugar factory to do something special for my birthday (I didn't know). Which ended up having us sit there for an extra 30 mins-1 hour for 2 scoops for vanilla ice cream with sparklers. Apparently they had forgot and then changed us when they said they were comping it. And then over changed my cousin $20 on a $40 bill ($60) and they denied over charging her. And she had to dispute the transaction with her bank. She also had a $7 ice tea that tasted like fish, it was disgusting! 
We all ended up getting food poisoning. My birthday was ruined. I tried to stay positive but after we left I started balling my eyes out. I will never go back to Sugar Factory. It's nothing like how it was at the Paris.

Ordered: Caramel Brownie Bread Pudding $12 and Fried Ice Cream & Oreo Cookie $12 (with the plan to split between two people)...were later told that they were out of fried oreos. Ordered the Cookie Jar Sundae for Two $14 (again meant to split between two people)

Received: ""An extra shake""...while waiting for our orders to arrive, a different server came to our table and dropped off a milkshake saying that it was extra from another table's order. We graciously thanked her and sampled what we believe was a cookies n cream shake.

Based off this check, I believe the server entered in our order incorrectly (despite stressing that the ice cream sundae was going to be for two people)..but wasn't apologetic (instead passing the blame to the other staff).

Cleanliness: Table surface was not cleaned completely. A different waiter came by mid-way through our wait with a rag to wipe extra chocolate off the side of our table. Floor was sticky in some areas. Crumbs/sprinkles on seat.

OVERALL: As a local, I would PASS on this tourist spot.
Poor service and dining experience = an ""extra"" order we were charged for, a missing order, and no napkins/utensils or drink refills",iiMGd03G_RXzXFfRsyPAMg,5,0,1,pnMxI4czlylG1S3MDzDLrQ

The server then came over and threw a laminated copy of the Groupon fine print to us. We asked to have us sit at separate tables and were told no.

I ordered The Drake goblet, which was topped with cotton candy and filled with peachie-ohs gummy candy. I loved it, but it should be served with a spoon to fish out the peachie-ohs! They were stuck to the bottom of the glass. The white chocolate burger was good, but not what I expected. The ganache on top makes the burger difficult to eat. My hands were a sticky mess trying to maneuver through this dish. Maybe it would be better if the ganache was inside the burger. It would kill the visual effect that the restaurant is probably going for, but it would make it much easier to eat. The burger itself also needed salt to balance out the sweetness of the chocolate. It wasn't until the last couple of bites that I tasted any salt on the burger. But the best was saved for last, because those two bites were sweet and salty greatness.

The only pitfall was our server. It seemed like he came around often when we didn't need him, or he was nowhere to be found when we did need him. Overall, it was a great experience, and I would come again.",8DcZKJMOuSf8qyh8XitaKA,1,0,4,CQjUb2hEkc9YVK5nnaWTBQ

I first brought it up to Chaz and he said they do charge for it and it's not a mistake and he went to speak to his manager to see if they can take it off.

It's not about the money, it's about making your customers aware of your charges beforehand I ask to speak to the manager and he comes to our table.

The service was good. The staff works very well together. If you ask one person for something, a few seconds later someone else would bring it. I do want to shoutout one of the staff would was so sweet and helpful! His name is Richard, I believe he may have been a food runner but secretly I liked him more than my actual server (Shh!) . 

I ordered the chicken tenders and fries, basic but a good choice. The other two ladies in my party ordered the chicken quesadilla. There were fresh, a good amount of chicken, however, the taste was very bland. I even tried to add hot cause for a little flavor and they did not solve the issue.

We celebrated my nieces 18th birthday so my family reserved a space in the Chocolate Lounge. When you first enter the lounge there's a step and repeat sign (photo backdrop) where you can take pictures in front of it. 

The chocolate lounge is upstairs and right off the back patio where you can ride a carousel and take beautiful pictures. It's very picturesque! It has spectacular views of the strip and the lights are breathtaking at night. 

So much food was ordered for my niece and her friends. They each received red candy buckets on the table. But why not! It's the sugar factory! They each ordered the infamous Goblets. Each one ordering from their own taste. Hers which ones they ordered (Virgin of course!) duh! 

Lollipop Passion  
The Drake - I ordered this! You can always count on me for cotton candy  
White Gummi
Watermelon Patch 

Each goblet is super cute! You can take the cup home for an additional $15 on top of the already $25 drink. You decide if it's worth it. 

Anyways, the food was delish. I ordered the rainbow  sliders. 

Other food ordered (which was all family style) was: 
Banana Split Waffle
Country fried chicken and waffle - 
Baskets of fries
Fried Mac & Cheese Pops
Spinach Artichoke Dip
Grilled Mini Burgers
Sampler Platters
Chinese chicken salad 
The Signature Sugar Factory Burger - my husband ordered 

All this food came around a thousand times! So much was ordered and it was all delicious. 

Service was great! Especially for a party of such large size.  Parking was fine. We parked in the Neiman Marcus parking lot and walked right up to Las Vegas Blvd. we did get lost by going to the Miracle Mike Shops. That's not the right one if you're trying to find the chocolate lounge. She did give me a couple coupons for the mixup. Lol 

I really cannot wait to go back there.  I think the one in Los Angeles is open. I wonder if they'll have the same flair. I'll definitely be going.",MHRFoic8HorY-KOAeuCc0Q,2,0,5,udQQhEBCJQR4po9LoweRKQ

After much hesitation that I would come back and waste my time again,  I decided to return and I have to say this time they delivered. Completely different experience than our last trip. We were greeted with a friendly smile and were sat right away. Food was good(came out in a timely manner), drinks were great! They even went out if their way to make me a drink that was on their online menu but not on the menu at the restaurant. Service was great as well( thank you, Nikki!).  Thank you Sugar Factory for making it right!


I can't even with this place! Hey get a 1 because I have no other choice. Where to start? my party and I arrive and are given a 10-15 minute wait time. Sit at the bar and order a margarita which seems like a complicated order for the bartenders. Get he margarita and I don't know what it was but it was not a margarita. Fine. Make some adjustments to it and still not a margarita but whatever. 40 minutes later still waiting and I approach the hostess stand and I'm told about 20 more minutes. Wait 20 more minutes, nothing. THIRTY more minutes and still not seated. Finally we get seated and it's not a booth as requested but a table that seems like it was pulled from outside and placed by the kitchen area. Our server comes to introduce himself,make small talk and we make a comment about the wait time. Even after all that, the service is TERRIBLE!! Order drinks,appetizer and entree and as you can guess..long wait time. Order a second drink which never comes until we ask another employee passing by to please get our waiter and get us our check.  He shows up with the second drink we ordered 30 minutes before. Unfortunately I had to send that back as by now I am fuming and ready to get the hell out of this place!  The check comes and it's incorrect. I get it's busy but that's no excuse for this type of service there are way too many other places I can spend my money!

FYI--We were seated at one of the tables INSIDE THE CHOCOLATE LOUNGE. Once we were seated, it took awhile for our server to come, to get our beverage order, and the food.

He comes back and says the actually do have enough chicken for our order and we were the last chicken & waffle order they could fill. Well.... our food finally comes out. The chicken and waffle plates should come with two pieces of friend chicken on the bone i.e. Breast and leg or thigh. Each of our plates had two wings, two chicken strips and a thigh. It was as if they used all the remaining chicken types they had left to make our plates. I personally don't like strips or thigh pieces. They didn't tell us this is how our orders would be filled or give us the option to change our order. So disappointing and not appetizing at all!

For instance what did he recommend and how much. He 
throughout a money amount of I think its 41.00 i'll be back. It took Chaz a long time to come back to the table. We had more questions abt more drinks and food. He answered as best as he could I guess. I'll be back. He disappeared once again leaving us hanging, he left us in total 3 times. In the interim we asked another waitress was he new because he appeared to be in a fog and didn't no what he was talking abt. She responded no he has been here quite sometime. We asked her how much were the goblet drink. She gave us a completely different amount. We asked the couple next to us who had Chaz also, how was he treating them with the service they were provided. They said he disappeared on them too and were waiting for him to come back to the table. He got their order wrong etc.¬† Upon arriving back to our table we asked him not to go anywhere, we were new to the experience, please don't disappear on us again and to be patient. When we proceeded to continue our questioning he would answer and talk to us like we were children and in a condenscending manner. There were what appeared to be 2 or 3 Managers standing around doing nothing but talking and laughing with one another. They were not walking around asking customers if everything is ok and do we need anything like good management do. May I add Chase was laughing and talking (sucking up) to them as well!!!

And did we, we were so miserable when we left your establishnent we went back to the hotel and packed our luggage and went to sleep.

We ordered the Lollipop Goblet, one of their most popular, and the waitress said sorry we are out of those, so we ordered the Watermelon Patch and asked if we could get the lollipops in that one since they were out of the drink, sure for another $8.00. This drink was completely full of dry ice and hardly any alcohol,  it had so much ice we could barely get our straws in it. It ended up costing us $46.00!
Now we ordered the Rainbow Sliders and a salad for lunch, the sliders cost $24.00 and the salad was $19.00 with hardly anything on it. The sliders were barely warm and had no taste.
Since we drove 3 hours to come here we wanted to have dessert of course! We got a sundae the triple chocolate one, now I have to say it was wonderful but not worth $16.00! 
Now we had assumed for $46.00 a drink you would get to keep the glass, wrong!! The glass was an extra $15.00, so since this was her #1 reason for wanting to come here I bought her the glass. When I asked the waitress if we could get a clean one since this was still full of dry ice and candy she said no, it will be an extra $10.00. I about flipped out at this point, I said surely you can dump out the glass because we can't take it like this, and she said well I  don't so, I told her to go find out that there should be no reason they can't do that. She then came back with a clean one. 
The waitress was not attentive to us at all, first of all the presentation of pouring the drink is a big deal, and I had gone to the restroom quickly, when I returned she had already poured it, she couldn't wait 1 minute for me to return and there was only 1 other table with people in there. She never came by and asked it we needed condiments or water the whole time we were there.
Now to top it all off when we left a girl was sitting at the outside bar drinking a Lollipop Goblet!! So they were not out of them!!

The most surprising part for me was that it was only $5 extra for alcohol in the drinks. They should lower the price on the nonalcoholic drinks if they're just fruit punch in a cool cup.

We immediately ordered including drinks. 20+ min later food arrives- still no drinks. Shouldn't you get your cocktail before your foodI ask the food runner to check on drinks which arrive another 10 min. later with he excuse that the bar is backed up. Really? No one is here... I'd hate to see the bar on a busy night. Also I could see the bar where I was sitting and my drink had been just sitting there for who knows how long- the cotton candy topper had melted and I watched he waiter put on a new one with his hands which he didn't wash. Food was nothing special. Do yourself a favor and skip this place for one of the many many other options on the strip.

We were seated right away and greeted as we walked in. 

Our party started with four people, then moved to seven. Luckily we made it work and made more room in our booth for the extra people. 
We all started with a round of drinks and one calamari appetizer. 
Calamari was fried to perfection and very well seasoned. 
For the first time I decided to try a different flavor in their signature Goblet's. Went for the Raspberry Watermelon mint Mojito and it was very refreshing. But my favorite is still their Lollipop Goblet. 

For the entrees, we had the Steak Bearnaise, Fried Sea food platter, Chicken Satay and two orders of the Pacific Salmon. 
I had the Salmon and it was definitely my favorite entree. The salmon was not over cooked, very well seasoned and the asparagus and capers made the whole dish come together. I highly recommend this entree if you're a fan of salmon. 
Seafood platter was really good and it came with multiple sauces to dip in, or I am not sure if my boyfriend just order a variety of them on the side. 
My best friend had the Steak Bearnaise and she devour it. I am going to take a wild guess and say she enjoyed it. LOL
We wanted to do dessert but unfortunately our tummy's said ""no"". Probably was a good thing since we were drinking. 

Over all, I am so glad I came back and gave them another chance. All my friends had so much fun and truly enjoyed their dining experience. 
Our servers name was Jason and he was great. Very attentive, patient and polite.

From the reviews I knew beforehand that it was going to be pricey but I couldn't get my mind off of their Goblet drinks! Anyways, I was there earlier this morning for lunch and the service is what is giving the review two stars. Our server and the other workers around were very attentive and polite. The reason I'm knocking off 3 stars is because I found a hair in my ultimate veggie burger. The manager did speak to me and ask if I wanted anything else but after I basically ate half a stand of hair my appetite was gone. She apologized for the issue and we went on to get our bill from our server. We asked for a discount because of the hair and our server gave us 75% off of my burger. I personally thought my meal should have not been charged at all but I didn't want to speak to anyone and my sister was dealing with the check. Obviously I could have asked to get my meal removed from the check but I wanted to get out of there so I can't blame them for that. I probably won't be back because it was embarrassing and disgusting having to deal with that.   


Also, the hair is on the side of the plate in the picture I provided because my sister pulled it out of the burger to make sure it wasn't any strand from the leafy greens that was inside.",9GSgWeUArit22TQgIPtzMw,3,2,2,gNixWcXLVgWPlCpqtZix5g

They started us with the goblet. It's pretty messy. When the waitress dumped the liquid into the goblet it boiled violently and got all over our table. We had to use our napkins to soak up the mess, she didn't even seem to noticed. Be careful when drinking these goblets because the dry ice creates gas and that gas is pretty painful when you inhale it if your straw is unfortunate will enough to hit an air pocket.  You will end up with a mouth full of gas up your nose and it's pretty painful. The sliders were pretty good that was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. The burger was OK but super messy and not at all visually appealing. The fries it came with were pretty good. We decided to try a milkshake for dessert and had the Smore's milkshake. Be forewarned this thing contains a lot of espresso! I stayed up all night easily after drinking that milkshake, but it was so good. Layers of chocolate and marshmallow.

As soon as we checked in to our hotel rooms we asked my son where he wanted to have dinner for his birthday and he said Sugar Factory.  He was so excited and us adults were excited too (we had seen pictures on Instagram, tv shows etc).  Right away I called to make a reservation for a party of nine (4 adults and 5 kids ranging from 3-9years old) at around 7:45pm.  We all got ready to head out and walked the strip a bit.  While walking and passing the restaurant we saw that it was empty and the kiddos were already hungry so I stopped and spoke with the hostess and she was able to sit us right away. We all were relieved and happy because the kids were hungry and super excited to dine there.  We were taken upstair to the ""Chocolate Room"" then our waiter came.  I forgot to get his name, I should have written it down but my oh my was this waiter so rude! I don't know if he was annoyed because it was so many of us or that we had 5 kids with us but cmon its a damn restaurant what do you expect! Any-who,  my daughter and I went to the restroom and on the way out we saw our waiter. I told him hey it's my sons birthday and right away he answered me as if he was annoyed stating they DO NOT do free birthday cheers I would have to buy a dessert and also pay a $5 fee to have the waiters come out and wish him a happy birthday.  Fine I was okay with it, I could've paid extra, not a big deal but the way he responded to me was unprofessional.  Because of his sassy attitude I decided not to bother with ordering my sons desert.  Mind you guys... it took forever for us to get our drinks...and it took forever for him to order our food! He would leave and come back minute after, lets just put it this way we literally had like a photosesh outside with all the kids because he was just taking so long.  Point blank this waiter ruined our mood, and to top it off I paid over $80 for our meal and unacceptable service. What urked me even more was the fact that his tip was already included on our bill.  I would not have left a tip at all if I had the option.  My son and I along with our in laws were looking forward to the desert and having a good birthday dinner and he ruined it. We all felt uncomfterable it was only obvious this waiter was annoyed or idk having a bad day. I was so upset and irritated by the waiter that I even wrote on the receipt stating If it wasn't for the added gratuity on the check I would have left nothing as a tip! $0! I also wrote a piece of advice to give better service next time. I hope his manager read it or who knows he probably threw it away so he wouldn't get in trouble.  Just a shame the food was really good but the service was just horrible and that alone threw off our dinner and even our mood for the rest of the night.",_8WUnol_tSvHsuPyVExWug,0,0,1,u6B_xOF_Dwd4H3-9WggVEg

I was tempted by the enormous goblet drinks, but opted for a water to save my appetite (and bank account) for the delicious milkshakes for dessert.  For my meal, I ordered the Farmer burger, which part of their monster burger collection.  It was a unique burger with gravy on top, which was amazingly good.  The burger was huge, so it is worth the price you pay for it.

For dessert, I ordered one of their insane milkshakes and decided on the Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake shake.  These are pretty expensive-- but again, you get what you pay for.  The glasses are coated with various chocolate coatings, which are pretty, but not really functional as anything more than decoration.  My milkshake had a giant lollipop, a piece of cheesecake, and a piece of sugar daddy candy on top-- so it really felt like 4 desserts in one.  One of the shakes even has a bacon cheeseburger on it!  The shake was delicious, but I couldn't finish the entire thing.  If your shake has candy on it, they will package up your candy for you to go if you can't finish it, which is nice.

In summary, this is a place you go for the novelty.  The food is great, don't get me wrong, but the draw is really the elaborate foods.   Be prepared to shell out a lot of money, but it is an experience and is 100% worth it!",BzVZZQxj2Gwdde2vgZ6zyQ,0,0,4,Yuswb6yjblJI5wBo31apBA

Want to start with the positive - which is that our waiter was super attentive to our large group and definitely tried his best. 

The food is beyond mediocre, and unfortunately its not only that, but they also served me raw chicken. I ordered the chicken tenders. I noticed that two of them were stuck together and there was a white sauce coming out of it. Thinking it was just ranch, I pulled them apart only to find out that the chicken was literally raw and uncooked. I wanted to vomit. I immediately alerted my waiter who was super apologetic. They re-brought it out, but at this point I could only take a couple bites cause of fear. After like 2 bites, I look down to discover a long black hair, which is the opposite of my hair color. I couldn't anymore. 

IDK if they're just like rushing to get the food out because our baked brie was cold in the middle and we sent it back to make it gooey. 

Super health hazard and if I hadn't realized before eating the chicken that it was literally raw, things could've been a lot worse for them",xxfZPzwO4vpYq3P22P7zmQ,2,0,2,MzMLF5Vt3vREF3d-g1jXcw

It didn't make sense because even after we finally ordered our food and drinks and started on them after everything arrived, we saw him walking around within the restaurant and serving other tables and still working?? 
Anyways.. the food is mediocre. I'd only come back for the drinks. Things are overpriced for the quality but it is Vegas and it is a spot right on the strip so its expected.

The Buffalo Chicken sandwich and Turkey Club we ordered was prepared fresh and a good sized serving, but we didn't find it to be anything spectacular.

I been to the Sugar Factory at Paris that closed down and all I have to say at Fashion Show Mall was one of the worst restaurants I been to in my life. This place has changed a whole lot and I am for sure they will go out of business. Everything there from the food to the candy side are soooo expensive, so you would think the food and candy would be amazing? Absolutely NOT! Even the people working for the restaurant have the worse customer service ever! The prices are over the top and there burgers are Blah to there cold fries. I couldn't believe on Fathers Day we have a table of 9 and ask can we sit where there was a table with no one sitting there the lady said no it's for another guest. Literally while sitting with 7 little tables that moved everywhere for roughly 2 and half hours no one came for the reservations SMH ?. So I'm thinking are they racist and think ? Finally we are done eating and paying for a check that was astronomical, then to find out a-white family was seated where we originally said can we move to that side of the table. Lol! I would never in my life go to a place that sells a GOBLET for 40.00 and it's the worse drink with absolutely no alcohol. Anyone reading this I promise you do not waste your time.

He forgot drinks as my love struggled to finish dinner . 
As we checked out with the server we had to chance to rate him , right in front of him , I passed on the option and he kindly gave himself 5 stars with no explanation of the meaning of the review . Spoke to the manager concerning service and lacked interest with awkward silences even though I expressed my understanding of the server being overwhelmed .

First off, our server Marc did an excellent job in making us feel welcome. He explained everything and recommended some of the stronger goblets (maybe my party looked like we could drink?) He was also very professional and took really great care of us the whole time we were there, even though we did not order a whole lot of things.

My lollipop passion goblet was delicious! Yes, it was super sugary but it also packed quite a punch, I shared mine with the boyfriend and still ended up a bit tipsy. The lollipops and the candy bracelet was such a fun touch, Marc even offered me a bag to take my lollipops to go.

I tried my friend's calamari and it tasted so much better than I expected it to be, crispy and the marinara sauce that came with it was delicious, we felt that we had waited too long to receive it considering the place wasnt busy at all while we were there.

A few reasons that makes this place not 5 stars:
-The price: I got one goblet drink and an appetizer, $75 ish including a nice tip. That's a little ridiculous in my personal opinion but hey it's the strip and I guess if you got cash to burn, you do you.

-The candy store was all out of their couture pops/refills: besides trying this place out, I was looking forward to purchase some refills and maybe some new handles. I did not see a single one in the storw. It doesn't make sense to me that they could be completely out of what they are known for.",aYANhFlR0iI6KbaZO05zhg,1,2,4,uBIga-inhZ5WvCLhzDktRg

The drinks are the greatest part. I had the Grape Crush drink and it literally tasted like Grape Crush but it came with a nice little buzz ;)
We shared a dish bowl with gummy bears and the RedBull in it and it was SO good.
Total was $100 for 2 drinks, 2 lunches, and 1 fishbowl which was a little steep but when in Vegas...

I was with a group of 5 girls. 3 were seated and given Complimentary drinks for Ladies Night & told the waitress (Terri D.) that they were waiting for 2 more ladies to order. The last two arrived and we had to wait 30 minutes before we were even acknowledged again! We tried to wave her down, she put a finger up signaling she'd be there in a second. We literally went up to another waitress and just asked her to please take out order, she said you guys aren't in my section so I'll just tell her... WELL SHE DIDNT. We waved down what looked to be a manager and told him how we had not be attended in over 45 minutes, she finally came around apologizing that she was busy & had too many tables. It literally felt like she was just plain ignoring us because in the time we spent waiting to get our food and drinks; 3 appetizers & 2 goblets (2 1/2 hours +) we saw the two tables next to us get several rounds of drinks and one of them managed to finish a goblet, have dinner, order dessert, & was even sung happy birthday to. So obviously she was just ""TOO BUSY"" to stop by our table for some reason. Oh by the way we were half way into our goblets before we had to stop the manager again to ask him to get us the complimentary drinks for the two other ladies who arrived a little late. And the only reason we bothered him again is because we waited over 20 minutes after asking Terri again to bring them... 

I don't buy her too busy excuse because I saw plenty of other tables being attended and serviced... it felt personal, we felt ignored and for no reason. We were trying to be polite but we are never doing ladies night here ever again.",h6BDIM6whV7jNxL-zEUG5A,2,0,1,tn2VfoSV0xVEWjc2KR0kJA

After receiving our menus we were given enough time to watch an episode of Joel Osteen before our server came back to ask for our orders. 

We didn't receive any silverware or napkins once our Mac and cheese balls appetizer arrived, so we used our hands and licked our fingers to stay sanitary and ensure we could use our hands for hunting better food at a later time.  

We ordered the charcuterie platter and when the food runner brought it out he spilt all the pickles on my leg, and the container fell to the floor. My boyfriend and I were like, ""it's cool...things happen."" As he went to go scavenge for more pickles I noticed we did not receive bread with our meat platter.

The Sugar Factory is indeed a cute and a popular hot spot in Vegas. They have an indoor and outdoor seating. Their signature menu offers everything from pancakes and sweet and savory crepes to burgers, salads, and pizzas.

We all had drinks on their famous goblets¬†with dry ice that makes them fizz and bubble. The drinks and sweets were tasty, however, the food was a little bland.

The lower level is the Sugar factory dining experience as well as a confectionery offering gifts and sweets for every taste.

After the manager reached out to me on yelp to try again we totally took her up on that offer. Jeneivieve was super apologetic and very prompt in making our reservations after I gave her a date that me and my guest would be available. So one week later me and my best friend went back up to Sugar Factory. And by the end of the night I was FLOORED with how amazing our service was!!  From the moment we got seated we were taken care of. This was the experience that I was looking for last time. We got greeted by the manager  (and he apologized which we graciously accepted) , and then from that moment our waitor Jason gets 5 stars! He was awesome, funny, attentive, and a pleasure all night. There was nothing we asked of him that he did not give us with a smile on his face. We started out the evening with two goblets (he recommended the lollipop one) and on top of presentation the drink was delicious. I will definitely come back for that goblet alone. My friend orderd the Drake and boy oh boy was it strong. You can taste the Virginia Black in it, thankfully the cotton candy added a nice sweetness to balance out all of the alcohol.
 
He gave us some time to enjoy our drinks and just chaqt before he came over and took our order. (which we appreciated). I ordered the country fried chicken with a side of Herb Varicots (fancy a** green beans) and my friend ordered the steak and frites (which he suggested). Both plates came out piping hot. The chicken was cooked perfectly with a crispy texture and a hint of sweetness in the skin. Her steak was cooked thoroughly and by the end of the night BOTH of our plates were empty. Upon the suggestion of the manner we both decided to order deserts. I ordered the red velvet cake. Now to be honest I didn't read it all the way through because I hate raspberry and this cake was loaded with raspberry cream, mousse, layers, syrups.....so that was a miss for me. I got a chance to taste my friends fried ice cream, and to be honest it was just OK. We were so full that the only thing we could really enjoy were the lollipops that were in my drink. (which were amazing).
 
Let me tell you. This entire night was the exact service we were expecting the first time we came. And although they didn't get it right then, they got it right the second time. They have ultimately changed my heart and I can't wait until my friends can come in town so I can bring them here. Thank you to Jenivieve, Manuel, and Jason for the great night.





Literally the worst experience. From the moment we walked it was just a complete lack of attention, lack of hospitality, lack of well....EVERYTHING.
 
I made reservations for this place a week and a half prior for 8:30 pm. We were a little early but we definitely wanted to get there early to look around and take some pictures. I heard the upstairs lounge was super cute and we were more than excited to check it out. Once I showed up to the hostess stand there was NO ONE there. After a few minutes of staring idly at the drink bar outside, a manager came out to speak to the bartender (who was watching us stare at him...) and then saw us waiting. He immediately sat us at the empty table outside without asking name questions reservations etc. We thanked him and for 15 minutes we were not acknowledged, offered a glass of water, or even thought about UNTIL we saw another ""manager"" who came out to speak to the table behind us. I got his attention told him our issue, he apologized and said he will be right back to take our order. Then a woman came out who he introduced as the Event Coordinator took our food and drink order (PRAISE THE LORD CAUSE WHO KNEW WHEN WE'D SEE ANYBODY AGAIN).  By the time we got our food an hour has passed, and we never saw the event coordinator or either manager EVER again.
 
Let's talk about the food. It was SOOO BASIC. I order the jalapeno burger. Jalapenos, roasted tomatoes, Sugar Factory's special sauce and American cheese. Sounds good huh? NAH. They literally through a luke warm patty on a bun popped some uncooked or seasoned jalapenos on it with a slice of cheese, no sauce, no roasted tomato, and some sloppy lettuce. I was so turned off by the service, the food, and the entire night that I sucked it up and just ate it. I was so ready to go. Literally the entire experience ruined my night. At the end of the night I paid 19.00 for a burger that I could have went to Burger King for (at least it would have been hot). I could understand paying for the experience but there was no experience. They had one poor girl working the patio, there were more than enough empty table inside, the ran out of the ingredients for the one goblet we wanted, one glass of water the ENTIRE time. I didn't even bother going upstairs for pictures or to see the rest of the establishment, it was so horrible. I will never go back. EVER.",Pjk0cNsCF8i7ssrzuc0G5g,1,1,5,_KBrhSNrhYN-8iseFyJZSQ

My family and I went here for my mom's birthday lunch a couple days ago and it was awful. We were there at noon on a weekday so it wasn't even busy, but we struggled to get our server's attention the whole time, and none of the other waitstaff walking by would stop to clear plates. We finally had to ask someone and he actually ignored us. It was so weird and not Vegas-like service at all. They also didn't do anything for the ""birthday"" part of the lunch (like saying a simple 'happy birthday') and we didn't bother bringing it up a third time to our waiter. There were five of us and we didn't have alcohol or dessert but it was still over $200 which felt so wasteful. We were all really disappointed by such an icky experience eating out.

My friend said that we would finish our drink and head out soon, but the manager who was by us said no, stay and enjoy as long as you want. That was really nice!

So I was pretty excited when I found out that they re-opened at the Fashion Show Mall.  Now I finally have a chance once again to try some of their outrageous menu items.

I was actually interested in trying one of their Insane Milkshakes on the menu.  In particular, their Bacon Cheeseburger Milkshake.  After all, it was National Hamburger Month when I was there.  And it was definitely a huuuuuuuuuuge milkshake good enough to be my lunch.

Bacon Cheeseburger Milkshake -- http://bit.ly/2vLk12Q
Strawberry Ice Cream drizzled with strawberry sauce and topped with whipped cream, a Mini Cheeseburger, Candy Bacon Strip, in a Chocolate Covered Mug with pretzel pieces and M&Ms.
Just to be clear, there's no cheeseburger in the milkshake.  As you can see from the pic, the candy bacon strip and mini cheeseburger are both served outside the milkshake and were more like decorations.  Still though, just by looking at the pic, it's pretty damn insane!   The milkshake was good and I enjoyed the sweet and salty combined flavors when eaten with the mini cheeseburger, candied bacon, and pretzel pieces.  This is not something I'd order all the time but if you want shock value, this is one thing you can consider getting.  I ended up finishing at about 80 percent of the shake, so I was very satisfied!

Sugar Factory at the Fashion Show Mall is definitely a spot you want to check out for some shock value dining and drinking.  I would love to come back again to try more things from their menu.  Almost everything on the menu has some kind of playful Willy Wonka look to them and would be fun to enjoy either by yourself or with a group.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,22,21,4,K9_WkoYnyC72DN8nIbTw3w

The service was good, but the food was awful. 3 of us ordered the white chocolate burgers, which used to be our absolute favorite. I cannot stress enough how awful this was. Every burger had white chocolate drizzled ON TOP OF THE BUN. No where on the menu description does it mention that. None of us could pick up our burgers, and I got so frustrated eating mine I took a few bites and gave up. How do you expect us to eat a burger with chocolate drizzled on top? Our hands were completely messy, ruining the whole experience. We also ordered the dark chocolate french toast which was repulsive. It was soggy and mushy. 

On the last day of vacation, I decided to order a salad to go. It sounded really delicious and I decided to give it a second chance. HUGE MISTAKE. The garbage salad was literally what it sounds like - garbage. The meats were so dry and the lemon dressing had a thick consistency, almost of mayo. The lettuce was soggy and I couldnt take more than a few bites. What also upset me was I called in the salad at my hotel. By the time I got there 20 minutes later, my salad was still not ready. Heres the kicker, there was NO ONE in the restaurant. Literally. So tell me why it took 40 minutes to throw cheese and meat on a salad? Seriously?

First, Open Table had allowed me to make an 8pm reservation at the Chocolate Lounge, but it was closed when we arrived (very strange, but not a big deal). We decided to have dessert at the Sugar Factory instead. We waited for about 10 minutes to have our order taken despite the restaurant being maybe 1/3 full. Not too long of a wait, but longer than I would have expected. However, next, we waited for 40 minutes for our dessert (ice cream cookie sandwich)- I finally caught the manager's eye to ask him if our order had been put in yet (our waiter, Chaz, had not been back to check on us that entire time!). The manager promptly got our dessert and refilled our waters for us. He very kindly went to grab us some spoons for our ice cream as well. About this time, Chaz came back over and had the audacity to ask us if we could use forks for our ice cream or if needed him to get us spoons. The manager was making his way back with the spoons just then, which was good because I don't know how I would have even answered that! If someone orders ice cream, it's always safe to assume he/she wants a spoon!! It felt so condescending! After all of that, the cookie was very dry- the ice cream was good, but the cookie kind of ruined the whole dessert. 

When we were ready to leave, I waved my credit card in the air when I saw Chaz waking by to get his attention because he had managed to avoid eye contact with us for so long earlier in the evening. Chaz noticed we hadn't eaten much of the dessert and asked if it was subpar. We told him the cookie was pretty dry/tough, and he said he would let the manager know, but we told him not to worry about it because we were tired and just wanted to go. He just stood there like he didn't know what to do, then he ran our bill. No apology for the food or the wait, no thanking us for coming in, nothing- he just gave us our bill, watched us tip, and left.

I've been dreaming about the Bacon Cheeseburger shake since I first saw photos of it a few weeks ago and this was my chance, since I don't like to eat late and it was already 10:00 pm by the time we dumped the car.  Sugar Factory was open until 12:00 am so we ran over there as fast as we could.  

They have set up shop in the newer Fashion Mall on the lower level and ever since Serendipity left the coveted Caesars storefront and other than HEXX, there was no place that screamed ""Vegas"" on the north end of the strip.  The interior is a fusion between Willy Wonka + Moulin Rouge + Steampunk, which means you will enjoy sitting there while the music pounds away in the background.  Sugar Factory takes everything know for the American classics, such as sandwiches, burgers, milkshakes, and drinks and optimizes them.  And when I say, optimize, I really mean bigger and brighter.

For example, they have drinks here but instead of a typical cup, the drinks here come in goblets.  These are goblets you need to hold with two hand cupped around it, mind you.  There are no small drinks here.  And the vibrant colors induce rather than repel.  There was a table next to us that ordered the drinks with liquid nitrogen for the dramatic effect.

In this case, I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger strawberry milkshake and a Caesar Salad because that was exactly what I was craving.  Others in the party ordered the Turkey Avo Club sandwich and others ordered just drinks and wings.  The milkshake was everything that I was expecting and more.  The mini burger was even good, but the strawberry milkshake was a typical milkshake, not too fancy or out of this world.  My Caesar salad was fresh and crisp, exactly what I wanted after spending the day out in the sun exploring.  Not too heavy.

The Turkey Club looked good but seemed a little dry.  IE., there wasn't enough avocado on it and same with the tomato and lettuce.  I'm usually use to seeing stuffed sandwiches but this one lacked the filler and it looked a bit airy.  Overall, however, my friend enjoyed his sandwich and the french fries were a lightly seasoned shoestring kind.  We kept nibbling on these throughout the course of our evening.

Bear in mind that in the later hours of the day, this hotspot caters to a lot of groups celebrating birthdays so I wouldn't recommend bringing your little kids in around the 10-11 pm hours.  The music is awesome/dance but NSfK (Not Suitable for Kids).  Our staff person was very attentive and checked in on us at various intervals, which we appreciated.

Overall, a great experience so I'll be back for a quick bite/dessert in the late hours of the day when everything is closing.",m5cBT7OYfn0HM0d-RCsdZQ,6,7,5,xV81RDHtiMRgRezR1AZR-Q

I know it's ""Sugar"" Factory, so I won't be complaining about the murdering sweetness of the drinks, though I did feel the entire evening afterwards how that sugar clod was just sitting in my stomach causing uneasy sickness. But that's expected from a candy-themed restaurant, even though a couple next to us returned their goblet due to that very reason. 
What I did not expect was that ALL three dishes we ordered (Mediterranean salad ($16),  Buffalo chicken sandwich with fries ($17) and Pacific Salmon ($29)) were unacceptably OVERSALTED. In fact, so terribly that I couldn't eat my salad at all and my husband had to ask them to take it back. My mom couldn't finish her salmon and it's still in the box. I know food is usually oversalted when it's about to go bad, but the salad seemed fresh, so I simply don't understand such unnecessary cruelty on the cook's part. Just.WHY?
Moreover, our drinks had no alcohol in them. Like At All. We were told the goblet ($40) would have about 8 shots. 8 shots of syrup, obviously, not alcohol. The other drinks (Watermelon Burst martini and Sexual Chocolate strawberry ($17 each)) were also just that: sugar. No alcohol.
For a $130 dinner (the salad was taken off the bill) that's just unacceptable. It spoiled the whole impression from the trip. The entire evening I regretted coming here and polluting my body with all that sugar and salt.
For comparison a small restaurant Ocean One Bar and Grille inside Planet Hollywood got us deliciously full and drunk for just $48.64. Three DELICIOUS HEALTHY dishes, 1 appetizer and 7 great drinks!

Giggles Snickers Milkshake: For some reason by looking at all their desserts, I had the assumption that everything was going to be overwhelmingly sweet. To my surprise, the milkshake tasted fantastic. It was nice, creamy, and thick. It had a great oreo flavor, and I kept scooping away at the whipped cream and sprinkles. It was perfect. The presentation was exquisite. The mug was covered in chocolate with a rainbow of sprinkles and bits and pieces of Snickers everywhere. There was also a caramel waffle to top it off! SWEET! 5/5

I have been dying to try their goblet drinks and finally decided to get one since we were staying across the street. We entered on the first floor and were asked if we wanted to be seated upstairs in their chocolate lounge. We agreed and were led up the elevator into the lounge. The first floor seemed like it was more for families because there were lots of families that night with their kids. We wanted a quieter area so the lounge was perfect! 

We ordered the Raspberry Watermelon Mojito and the Hazelnut chocolate fondue. The watermelon mojito was filled with frozen raspberries, watermelon gummies, and a lot of rum. They were pretty generous with their rum and that was all I could taste. I also don't think the watermelon and rum mixed well together. I wish I got something else. But the overall performance of delivering the goblet out and pouring the drink into the frozen ice at the bottom, creating this mist/fog effect was truly IG worthy. $39 per goblet. 

The hazelnut chocolate fondue was a big disappointment. The chocolate was not creamy at all and it didn't taste like hazelnut. Not sure if they gave us the wrong fondue but it tasted a bit like dark chocolate and bitterness. I was not impressed with the fondue. It came with mini marshmallows, mini gummy bears, pretzel bites, strawberries and bananas. Not only did the chocolate not taste good, but the gummy bears and pretzel bites did not pair well with the chocolate. For $26, I expected the fondue to really hit the spot. 

Overall, the experience was fun but the food and drinks were mehhh. The service was also mehh as well.

If you don't have a reservation here, don't make one! I just returned home after an early Mother's Day brunch with my daughter and granddaughter. Between the three of us, we ordered brioche French toast with assorted berries, pancakes with caramelized pecans, and fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. We asked that the chocolate drizzle and whipped cream be left off both breakfast items. When our food finally arrived, there were no pecans on the pancakes, and the brioche French toast looked as though it had been prepared literally in a toaster rather than on a grill-the crust was completely burnt. How does that even happen on the grill? There were barely 3 edible bites in the center. Additionally, both items had chocolate drizzle and whipped cream on them. Also, the promise of warm syrup is not to be believed. Apparently, only cold syrup exists here. No matter, since both items were barely worth eating. The fettuccine had chicken rather than shrimp and the waiter forgot the garlic bread that was to have come with that dish. Normally, we say nothing and don't return to restaurants if something even remotely close to this happens. Today, I did tell the waiter that the cook was probably going to cost him tips since every dish was wrong. His response was ""I'm sorry, did you want your check now?""completely amazing. What should have been a delightful once-a -year celebration was completely ruined by the inept performance at this establishment.",J9Ne17BcxgtZrKksi_lhXw,0,1,1,w1uiUWkge8MT1tESU_gYBA

Really wanted to love it since we attended to celebrate my sister's bachelorette party. A few of the things we experienced:
-one of the slowest services in the Vegas strip. Service was so slow that while walking to the bathroom I witnessed a party simply walk away after saying they were waiting for 2 hours for their food. It took 50 minutes for our drinks to be delivered to our table.
-the layout is awful. Servers have a hard time moving around between the tightly squeezed table, slowing down service even more.
-room is uncomfortably hot.
-bartender couldn't answer a simple question such as ""what kind of red wine do you have?""
-food quality was awful, high school cafeteria type of food.

The positive?
The design makes this place seem kid friendly since it's all about candy and sweets, and the bar is decorated like a carousel.

The inside is super cute and trendy. Lots of chairs and tables for big groups or even smaller intimate party sizes. The menu is super huge with lots of choices so dont get too overwhelmed. Lots of colorful and fruity drinks for the overwhelming goblet sizes. We opted to share the Raspberry Watermelon Mojito ( it was okay wish i chose something else) if you check into Yelp you get any goblet drink for half off. Steal!!!!

Besides the food and drinks i would have given it more stars but the service and the surrounding activites with the other staff was challenging.
For example the buss boy was mopping right in our area where ourselves and other guests were eating and drinking as well as a walkway for patrons and servers moving back and forth with the aroma of clorox on the side very unappetizing. I dont see why the mopping was needed at that very moment when there were no spills that needed to clean up. As soon as he finished  (i told my girlfriend this was going to happen) an employee slipped and fell. Good thing she didnt get hurt too bad and right after her a guest was coming along and myself and another guest told her to watch herself because it was slippery (no visible signage) i just shook my head. Its common sense. Finally a manager told him to not do that right now. Smh.",A0UtIwTkkH2GHcVePPBgtQ,1,0,3,dLHcDagtzYdhb4FRtNbPkg

My husband went with a basic bleu cheeseburger and fries. Dad and I got the Mac & cheeseburger and a BBQ Chicken pizza to share. Again, good portions and creativity. Ok quality. 

For dessert - brownie bread Pudding and a chocolate peanut butter shake. The latter wasn't very thick, but had tons of flavor. And the bread pudding is probably croissant bread pudding with chunks of brownie on top (which they forgot and promptly brought out) as well as ice cream.

It's a nice splurge once in a while to treat yourself to massive amounts of sweets and chocolate. However, after coming to this location at the fashion show I don't think I will be coming back. 

My friend and I came here and was seated at the chocolate lounge on the second floor. The server girl we had seriously did not know what she was doing neither did the whole staff of the restaurant. I asked if they had happy hour because we got there at 4pm. And the server didn't even know if the restaurant had happy hour. Instead she comes back with a flyer saying ""no but we have ladies night if you want to come back later."" Umm..no. So then we place our order and as we place our order she fumbles around with her iPad trying to place the order. So food comes. Food was pretty good. Hence the second star. 

We ordered the white chocolate burger, onion rings and chicken tenders with the chocolate cookie overload milkshake and the strawberry milkshake. The burger was pretty good. It had some white chocolate drizzle and shavings to the top bun. A mix of swet and salty as you bite into the burger. My friend really enjoyed the chicken tenders. She said the breading was really good compared to others. Onion rings were great as well. The breading was light and came with a chipotle ranch dipping which was pretty good. 

Food experience was great. However when paying the bill came around, the server stood behind me while I added the tip to the iPad checkout. I do not like that. My tipping is private and the server should not be standing behind me watching. Tip is based off of the service you provide me. I left an unfortunate 18% which is actually really generous for the crap service I got.  Anyways on the way out my friend and I asked for a bag to put our leftovers in. And one of the guy goes and checks to see if they had any. He comes back and say ""Oh we don't have any upstairs but if you go downstairs they have ALOT"". Ok so you can't go downstairs and grab a bag for a customer? And instead make them go downstairs themselves? Ridiculous!! So ticked off i left without a bag. 

The staff is so incompetent. I don't care if you're new or what not. Know the proper ways to provide customer service, and know what your restaurant is offering or don't even work in the industry at all. Keep in mind 4pm on a Thursday. Not busy at all. Probably only 2-3other tables besides mine.

When they come across something visually appealing they haven't seen on my social media feeds, they'll tag me. Sometimes demand to know why I haven't been... appalled even. 

That is how I came across this place a friend tagged me when she found out I was going to Vegas, then I started to google it and found out they were having a grand opening, a few weeks before we were scheduled to arrive.  

Immediately made reservations for our first night there. Online reservation was easy, I didn't even have to print out anything we were on the list.

Day of: We were not going to make it timely, I tried calling to make them aware but was told to get there ASAP.  She didn't have time to go let their hostess know.  We were fashionably late. They were packed, large crowd in and out doors.  I gave my name and the look upon the hostess face. Priceless. 

""We mark you as a ""no show"" after ten minutes""  *insert annoyed emoji*  

Good news, I wasn't turned away, but we lost our table indoors. I was told THE Backstreet Boys were to make an appearance. They did, I have pictures and video, shaking hands and hugging. (worth the extra wait)  We waited about 30 minutes to be seated, which is not bad considering the crowd. It didn't feel long due to the hustle and bustle of standing directly in front of the celebrity dudes. *no longer boys* 

They were going to seat us outside in front of the crowd, my girl friend was not having it. N.O. *they bicker* The hostess looks over at me and I say ""look, I know we were late, I am sorry, but I booked it because I saw the beautiful d√©cor and the fancy drinks, we are not here because of the backstreet fellas."" *insert pouty face*

She said ""I only have outdoor tables, let me take you upstairs"", we walk out of the restaurant, around the crowds, up the stairs, & up to security.....

My eyes and smile couldn't get any bigger. Started wiggling in my skirt doing my happy dance, ""Yes! This is what I want, no better place! Is this where we are sitting?"" *dancing, clapping, silly ear to ear grin*

The most beautiful ""willy wonka"" (not willy wonka but you get it) area I have seen in real life. It's so pretty!!! We sat in a gorgeous gazebo & the lighting was perfect.

We came to this place after seeing an ad for a meet and greet with UFC fighters. The ad also said to contact them for reservations. Naturally, we assumed this meant that to get to see the fighters you would need to be a patron, so we booked a reservation and showed up on time. The fighters, however, did not. They showed up an hour late. And when they did arrive, this place became a circus.

There was no organization whatsoever. We asked our waiter if it was possible to meet the fighters (as we were dining in the restaurant for that purpose) and he said ""they don't tell me anything about what's going on"" and walked away. When we got up and tried to get closer, we were told to ""get in line"" if we wanted a picture....so why did we make the reservation (as the ad suggested) and spend $$$ dining there if we're supposed to line up behind nearly 100 people who weren't patrons? Eventually, we did manage to get some pictures since the process was such a mess that they couldn't really stop anyone dining in the restaurant from doing so. 

But I feel really bad for the people who waited hours in line, most of whom were waiting in 40+ degree weather, to meet fighters that showed up an hour late + further delays because people that I assume are friends of the restaurant owners or something got to skip the line to meet the fighters.

To make matters worse, the burger I had was not cooked properly. I ordered it medium-well but received it well-done and charred. The fries were great - at least they have that going for them?

While I wanted to order dessert, the experience left such a poor taste in my mouth that I no longer wanted to contribute to these guys and will definitely avoid them in the future.",w9VSbG6bWPflax5_gwt6pg,1,0,1,nFS6i-j_VDAqrmyV-5XkzQ

The Sugar Factory isn't your average candy shop. They are commonly known for being widely endorsed by celebrities and the ginormous 60oz signature Goblets. With it being so widely popular, there are multiple Sugar Factory locations worldwide ranging from Las Vegas, NYC, Chicago, Orlando, Dubai, and even Manila. 

After numerous trips to Las Vegas and my IG constantly being riddled by drool worthy images of SF, I was pretty bummed at the fact that I have never gotten the chance to experience it first hand. This most recent visit changed all of that......

Our party arrived and was told there would be a wait for a table but if we didn't mind sitting at the bar, we could be seated right away. No harm no foul since our only reason for stopping by was for the infamous goblets. 
Be advised that the once glass goblets are now plastic and being the picky person that i am, scratched up plastic fishbowls were not appealing whatsoever. 

Instead we opted for 3 martinis:
LEMON HEAD- described as ""lemon with a hint of sweetness""
WATERMELON BURST- ""crisp taste of watermelon""
SOUR APPLE LOLLY- ""liquefied sour apple lollipop""

Sugar Factory will forever remain one of the cutest places to celebrate special occasions with your best girlfriends and for that I'm grateful they've re-opened. Spending over $500 after tipping on top of gratuity for a ""mediocre"" dining experience is extremely disappointing (definitely not the hip-trendy-exceptional service they're known for)!  

PROS: The Chocolate Lounge was extremely patient and sat majority of my squad while the remainder of the crew (8 total) were ""tardy for the party"" on a Saturday evening! (The restaurant was very slow upstairs to be honest)

CONS: We started off with hair in one of the 8 glasses of water. Small service failure but still unacceptable. 

The Pacific Salmon $29 was very over cooked; not by request. 

The spinach dip $15 was terrible. I wish I could compare it to something but I'd rather not. Just skip it and thank me later!

My friends salad didn't have one drop of dressing which was completely strange. (Of course we ""found"" the waiter to make it right).

I purchased The Drake $40 for obvious reasons! Y-O-L-O 
Regrettably, it looked like swamp water? Total opposite of the photo! If Drake didn't change his number so frequent, I'd call him and get his thoughts on the situation! Of course I didn't drink it. The not so souvenir cup became a filthy looking photo opp for my out of town snap chat peeps!
It's an additional $15 to keep the plastic ""souvenir"" cup can you believe that?! Total rip!

The icing is the new ""no split"" check policy that our server failed to share until the end. Everyone paying towards one bill with the option to receive separate receipts of payment is so backwards and took the server way more time to settle 8 payments.
 
Overall I'm uncertain if I'd return which is disheartening because I've been a SF fanatic since couture pops were on trend (that's a long damn time in Kardashian years)!

It's very nice and clean and very romantic like. Only thing i have to say about the sugar factory is they food. I asked for the hamburger with mac and cheese on top with no bun. They brought it but with a little and mac and cheese so i asked the waitress to look at my hamburger and she said ""ill bring you some more mac and cheese for your hamburger"" she did. My sister order a Classic cheese burger, and she asked for well done and she didn't get that, so she had to send the burger back and got a new one. These are the only reasons that i'm not impressed with this location, but they drinks are very good i might say!!!!They don't skip on the alcohol when it comes to the Goblet drinks with the candy in them.",LygXA5pJQDbKTj7YvhSLKA,0,0,2,tuYUNGEsRB54ynyDudWMsw

We did not get any silverware with our food and when they finally brought silverware they only brought four sets. I couldn't eat my food until I got some more because I gave the first sets to the children. Then, I had to get up and ask for more silverware even though we asked for extra sets when they brought the first ones. My point is that the food isn't good, the cheese on the burger looked like cheese wiz. And the service is HORRIBLE. But the drinks were fun.

The host was sweet and talked us up a bit which was nice. Our server was very attentive and friendly which is why I'm giving this place two stars instead of one. The reason for the low rating was the food. It was cold and bland and terrible. Prices were way too high for that quality. I got a creme br√ªl√©e latte for $13 and it was served in a tiny cup and halfway through it it got terribly sweet. I've had creme br√ªl√©e lattes before so I am aware of how sweet they get but this was gross. I drank it anyway needing the caffeine. I could've gotten two coffees at starbucks next door and still had change in my pocket. The potatoes were stale and cold and they give you half a scoop. I can't even compare it to the freezer bag of potatoes you would get at the super market because even those taste better. The New York steak and eggs was a joke. The steak didn't even look grilled. There were no grill marks and it looked like someone slapped it on to a cold pan. No good looking sear or anything. On top of that it looked like a cheap diner piece of meat. It was a very thin small over cooked piece of meat. The picture makes it looked like a thick cut beautifully grilled slab. They give you one piece of toast too. For $22 they couldn't even give you a full order. $7 for an order of bacon that wasn't even thick cut but looked like something you would get at a drive thru. I got the Alaskan Benedict. You know when you forgot to zip up a bag of meat in the fridge and the edges become hard and brown? Yeah that's how the edges of my soles salmon looked. I work at a breakfast lunch and dinner spot that sells food half the price but higher quality and properly cooked. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I aren't people to complain and ask for new plates especially since we didn't have time for that so we just paid and left.,JiGX1flzlOui3KaPBXIWiQ,1,0,2,P_zS3bwvruX_LxCWf3uCLQ

2 classic burgers- standard 
Classic steak- boring, no flavor
Nutella pancakes
Garlic butter pasta- boring, very little flavor
Garden salad
Rainbow sliders
Mac and cheese balls
The dye milk shake
Rocky road milkshake
Watermelon goblet 
Bill with Groupon and checkin on yelp, $180

The food was ok nothing wow..... The goblet, it was ok had a powder taste to it. I barely drank half and you don't even get to keep the goblet! For that much give me the dam cup!

So 2 star for food, if we come again I'd do the mac and cheese balls and desserts only.

Now, the service! Ugh! The waiter didn't really engage with us and tell us about the menu, the menu is huge so it would be great to get some help here! Then after we were done eating, we sat and waited for 30 mins, I just wanted the bill and saw the waiter taking everyone's order but never came over to see if we were okay or to check us out. Finally I went in and requested the bill. Which they finally brought out. I showed him my check in and Groupon. He rolled his eyes and said this is a process and takes a while I have to go upstairs and do it. WTF???? Don't have a check in and Groupon if you all can't figure it out! Another 15 min wait, comes back and gives me my bill to sign. Never once explains there's already gratuity added, but hands me the bill with the option for tip open. So I added the tip because again I had no idea it was there already! Ugh! So he got there mandatory tip they charge and an extra tip! Ugh!!!

The drinks were billed as 63 ounces. With ice and dry ice to cause a bubbling effect we may of had a 12 oz drink watered down? Maybe they boiled off the alcohol?

We got the Passion Punch goblet which we got every time prior and this time is was unbelievably sweet with ZERO detectable alcohol.  Bummer because we used to get a little buzz on to start our day on the strip.  

Fried Mac and Cheese are no longer triangle squares with breadcrumbs.  Now they are battered in what is like funnel cake batter and then fry them and put them on sticks so they are lollipops.  First, you used to get more... second the thick batter on the outside is just GROSS, third is I found something random and dark brown in one that was questionable.  The side sauce seems to be unchanged and still tasty.  

The club sandwich was standard and good - hard to mess up though. 

Lastly, our waiter was okay but he was also tending the outside bar.  Problem is I watched him pick his nose/ play with his nose ring MULTIPLE times and then continue touching things. GROSS!  The only reason I ate was because I saw him wash his hands before he brought us our food.  

We want to love this location but will not be back.  Hopefully we can get a better experience at one of their other locations.",AMoEWWxDUlujEcL6Mh5vFw,1,0,2,S3eXdIQT6Qc_bqiqsNMElw

As a local, I have been to sugar factory several times when it was at the sugar factory. for about 2 years, it was actual a frequent date night for me and my boyfriend so when they closed i definitely missed it. When I heard they were reopening another location at fashion show, I had to come and see it.  So I came tonight for my birthday. Let me say, the service was absolutely horrendous. Let me start this by saying it was a Wednesday and there were literally about 5 tables sat in the whole restaurant. It took approximately 10 minutes to get my drink order in and then an additional 20 minutes to even order my food. Throughout this time span, I watched my waiter stand and talk to his coworkers and continue to do his roll ups (as I'm assuming his shift was ending soon) instead of taking our food order. 
I come to sugar factory mainly for their amazing desserts and I didn't even order one because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes on my birthday for a dessert. 
I will NEVER come to this restaurant again. And as a local who frequented here weekly when it was at the Paris, that's saying a lot.
I even used my last bit of cash to pay the bill so I didn't have to wait for my card to get ran. 
If you are a local or even a tourist looking for a place to eat, unless you have an hour and a half to spare on just waiting for your food and drink, I would go elsewhere.",VFHQA6ohFJC66aBwrik-dQ,3,0,1,dLzarudfWypSEgMzsW-uyQ

The appetizers themselves were fine but the drinks could not have come out any slower if a snail delivered them! This event was not spontaneous, they knew at least a week ahead of time about our reservation but clearly they were not prepared with ingredients nor wait staff. Of course most of the ladies ordered the big candy goblet drinks which are time consuming but they made one at a time, carried up by elevator (which is shared with other serving staff). We saw one drink delivered to the table every 15-20 minutes on average and some people never got theirs. I got my lemon drop faster than others but felt guilty about drinking in front of friends who didn't have theirs. Rule #1 in restaurants, serve a girl her drank ASAP! Failure to follow this on a ladies night out will result in lots of unhappy women and no one wants that. On top of that, no prices are listed on the menu and when a couple of gals received a $50 charge for a dry ice drink, that soured the experience even more. They never seemed to apologize or even try to rush things. I won't be back.

The waiter was very patient in checking a bunch of IDs so we could try the cocktails. Two friends got goblets, which were great! You couldn't really taste the alcohol, and they had great candies inside. I got the Sexual Chocolate. The alcohol taste was a bit overwhelming in that one, so next time I'll be getting it without alcohol (which you can do with all of the drinks). 
Now onto the food. Oh boy.. again, the waiter was very patient with us as we ordered. It took a while for the food to come out, but that's to be expected when you come with a large party. We got food ranging from pasta to burgers. No one had any mix ups with their orders, and everyone's food came out mostly with no gaps. I got the Fettuccini Alfredo with a side of onion rings. Although the pasta portion was small, it tasted great! I'm actually glad the portion was smaller because too much pasta isn't always a great thing. The onion rings were great too!

5279331,2017-05-07,5,-oUM2uISux96lMGeawHIOA,"Born out of Las Vegas and now identified as a place to sip gigantic bubbling drinks, eat fun food and spot celebrities from New York to Dubai, it would be hard to say Sugar Factory is not one of the most successful concepts to ever spawn from Sin City, owner Charissa Davidovici somehow managing to turn $30 Lollipops into high fashion frequently spotlighted in Social Media feeds of everyone from Drake and Shaq to a disproportionate number of Jenners and Kardashians.

Originally launched in 2010 where HeXx now resides, a second location at Town Square also opened and shuttered in the interim, Sugar Factory American Brasserie was recently re-introduced at Fashion Show Mall with a multi-million dollar overhaul and several 'grand openings,' a visit on Friday Night showing the space to be every bit as audacious as one might guess, both in terms of the eye-catching d√©cor and the over-the-top menu executed in a kitchen led by Chef Bryan Ogden.

Without doubt a spectacle, the French Brasserie fa√ßade and giant Rubber Ducky quickly giving way to walls donned with ""Dots"" and photographs of celebrities as Rihanna 'Shines bright like a Diamond' at about 80 decibels overhead, it was with pleasant greetings that three guests were met at the hostess podium and led to a sizable six-top facing Las Vegas Boulevard, a young man named Erick providing great service throughout a nearly 2-hour evening.

Focused as much on the concept and environment as the food, a 'theme' restaurant in many ways but in general American as relates to the fare, it was after a quick visit from Chef Ogden who was most recently seen at Boca Park's Mixx Grill that a few items were ordered with a request for Bryan to 'fill in the gaps' family style, a brief wait spent watching the NBA Playoffs played on LCDs in back as sparkling candles zigzagged through the room as part of at least seven birthday celebrations.

Attempting to balance A/C with open doors, a tough task as Vegas neared 100¬∞F for the first time in 2017, it was after a bit more perusal that the decision was made to invest in one of Sugar Factory's $36 Goblets, the 60oz White Gummi featuring fresh-pressed Juice, dueling Cruzan Rums and a whole lot of Ice served bubbling at the tableside with Gummy Worms laced throughout a concoction that was at first quite sweet before unveiling a more spirit-heavy finish.

Making a low ceilinged first-floor look much bigger by way of crystal chandeliers and a lot of mirrors, the glass doors looking out towards Wynn and an open patio enough to keep the inside feeling secluded yet still accessible, it was after perhaps twenty minutes that savories came forth in back-to-back waves, the first two plates featuring Sugar Factory's spin on Chicken and Waffles with a golden half-bird laid across two crisp waffles tinged in Chives plus a sidecar of Maple-Cheddar Mornay and 3 Fish Tacos flawed by cold Tortillas that fell apart almost the second one tried to pick them up.

Not making any attempt to be a 'serious' restaurant, but rather a fun place for food and drinks in a City made for such things, round two saw Chef Ogden send out Sugar Factory's recently launched ""Rainbow Sliders"" aligned in the same color-order as the restaurant's signature signage as well as ""The Big Cheesy,"" a thick patty of Angus cooked medium-rare beneath crispy Bacon, house BBQ Sauce and a big scoop of Mac n' Cheese-a delicious idea that isn't so weird when you think about the ingredients.

Delving into three ""insane"" Milkshakes, an idea that seems to be gaining a lot of traction recently as restaurateurs put stock in Instagram's ability to drive short-term traffic, Sugar Factory goes all-in with three pages of choices, each seemingly more decadent than the next with the Twinkie Dinkie not dissimilar to drinking Birthday Cake in terms of its taste while the Giggles Snickers is essentially melt-resistant given the thickness created by Cookies, Peanuts, Chocolate Chips and Candybars, the Caramel Sugar Daddy further upping the ante by putting a whole wedge of Cheesecake on top of a Chocolate and Graham Cracker-coated mug full of the taste of a Sugar Daddy infusing a texture almost as smooth as Cannoli filling.

Fully aware that occupation and fascination were in conflict at this point, Sugar Factory proving as appropriate a name as any for a restaurant with an attached Candy shop and Chocolate Lounge upstairs, the meal came to an end by way of three desserts in two waves, items from the ""Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches"" section including two rich Brownies wrapped around Vanilla Ice Cream while a hemisected Doughnut was essentially a two-person Sundae with a duo of Sauces, Ice Cream, Fudge and Berries, the Caramel Brownie Bread Pudding served last a contrast of temperature, texture and flavor as the piping hot Brioche and Custard quickly melted Ice Cream and Whipped Cream into a pool around chunks of Fudge and Orange-Caramel Sauce that the youngster in the group likened to the taste of Fruity Pebbles",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,4,3,Ud8aD1zcDc2qiKmJUYhxhg

The long: Not the atmosphere I was expecting at all. But that's on me. Loud pop music and the whole restaurant was relatively small.

About 15 minutes later they brought our appetizers and we ordered the entre√©. 20 minutes later they. Rought the entre√©.

We ask for coffee. They, currently, do not have regular coffee. The coffee machine is broken! They offer us free Americana espresso, yet I want regular coffee. Not good. We turn the offer down and just tell them that it's OK to be polite, but it's not OK. Then I found out, as my friend heard it, that after saying the espresso would be free, the waiter corrected himself and said it would cost the same as the coffee and not more.
I order the egg white omelette with spinach.. it is simple... no cheese, with rye toast and BK potatoes. Healthy meal... so excited... the meal comes: The menu forgot to mention how bland the omelette is going to be. It also forgets to say that the joke is on me due to how much oil the omelette and the breakfast potatoes are clearly cooked in, as they are swimming in oil. It looks healthy... but it's not! I also ordered the rye toast... A bit chewy. So, what was the best part of the meal? It was the water.
What made the whole experience that much worse is that we had a waiter that thought he was being funny but was actually very annoying ( sorry.. I feel bad writing about this but it's a fact). Neither my friend or I finished our meals. My friend ordered the American breakfast with two eggs and bacon, and not only was hers bland but she commented that she wished she had made her own breakfast at home this morning as she could easily make this and hers would've been 10 times better. The waiter actually said ""I bet you guys did not finish your meals because you want dessert"". Sugar factory may be known for sweets, but that is not what adults usually ask for when it comes to breakfast.
It may be better for dinner or especially for strong drinks... I don't know... That is not my thing. I know that the top chefs make it very clear that if you are going to cook anything in your restaurant, it needs to be top notch. This restaurant miserably failed at breakfast.

So I was pretty excited when I found out they were opening a new location at Fashion Show Mall.  I've been here a couple of times now since they opened.  Service was ""meh"" the first time and we were told they were out of dry ice so I couldn't get the goblet that I wanted.  What kind of business that specializes in these drinks runs out of dry ice?!  That was a huge disappointment, but toward the end of our meal, we found out that they had some dry ice in so I placed an order for a non-alcoholic Watermelon Patch goblet.  At the time it was half off with Yelp check-in, which was great since those drinks are pricey, but the deal is no longer offered.  I got to take a cool video of it as the drink was made and it started to smoke, but it could have been smokier in my opinion :p  Taste-wise it was nothing spectacular to be honest, but it was pretty refreshing and handy to take to-go with me since it was such a hot day.  As for the food, I had the Sugar Factory Club, which was totally average.

Even though food and service were not great on that visit, I wanted to come back to try their Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake ""insane Shake.""   On that visit, service was better, but not their food.  I got their tomato bisque which was not very good.  It came with cheddar brioche toast which I liked but there wasn't enough of.  The shake WAS pretty insane!  I had to take off the rainbow lollipop and Sugar Daddy to drink it and was given bags to put them in and take home.  The cheesecake that came with it was pretty good.  The shake itself was plain but tasted better with the caramel, which I wish there could have been more of.

I'll give three stars because the goblets and drinks are fun and Instagram-worthy :p  But the food is just not good (and the pasta dish I loved is no longer on the menu) and the service hit or miss, so now that I've tried what I wanted to try, I don't think I'll be coming back here.",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,2,1,3,O5fhwata8YdLggUuILGHyA

Our party of five returned to the Fashion Show location on a Sunday night and we weren't all that impressed. The weekend dining time and atmosphere wasn't conducive for a family dinner and the service was slow and not very helpful with the daunting menu. When we did finally get our food and drink, we did enjoy it, but it wasn't quite enough to save the overall experience.

We were seated immediately for our 7:30 reservation time to a crowded restaurant with very loud music and even louder screaming and yelling echoing throughout the room (listen to my video). We had a lengthy five minute greet which gave those in our party who had not dined at a Sugar Factory before, a chance to review the voluminous menu. When the server arrived, the only introduction we received was her giving us her name and she immediately asking if we were ready to order without any review of the menu or even one suggestion. When she finally took our order, she was unfamiliar with the menu overall, especially my branzino entree and could not even find it on her ordering pad. Service from the bar was exceptionally slow. It was so slow that we received our entrees before we received our goblets. I'll be generous and say it took 25 minutes for us to receive our drinks that weren't appropriately garnished because they ran out of the gummy candy for their Drake, which was their signature goblet.

The menu is about 30+ pages with about 75% of it being flavored alcohol drinks, desserts, and pictures of celebrities. The food is for the most part American and everyone was actually pleased with what they received. I was happy they served the salty, crispy branzino skin side up to contrast the soft, mild flesh. I actually had a taste of my daughter's nutella crepe and it would be a good option for those wanting to stay on the sweet theme for their entrees. Although the goblets did pack a nice punch, when the mist cleared, the overpowering sweetness and the dry ice show were not worth the $38 price of admission for me.

Of course you have to get dessert at Sugar Factory, but our server did not even bring the word up and just dropped off the check. Maybe our $200 tab was enough already and she wanted to just turn the table over? So we paid it and had dessert elsewhere. I have no issues paying $40/person for a meal, but I expect stellar service, not service I would receive at a 24/7 diner. A non peak hour visit, which I would have to debate heavily, would probably result in better service. On the weekend nights, Sugar Factory is best for the large groups celebrating a special occasion, such as a birthday or bachelorette party, where you can get your drink on with foo-foo drinks, be boisterous and happy, and where you might forget about the prices you're paying and the service you're receiving.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,5,4,3,p9RJYAL0_3vzTQhBhh1kng

However, I would come back because we learned our lesson, and you just have to know what to get. We got 2 soups, one of the goblets and 2 burgers. The French onion soup was bland and my sister's was actually artichoke dip when she looked under the cheese. It was an honest and funny mistake, however it took 10 minutes for the server to come over and get it exchanged. We got the signature lollipop goblet and it was weak. More tarty and sweet than anything else. That turned out to be $40 bucks and a huge disappointment. I think it's worth maybe 25 or 30, and then you should be able to add shots. We saw some things on the cocktail menu that we could get but being as though this was our first and probably last time for a while we decided to get what the place was known for. Meh.

5665192,2017-08-18,0,-oUM2uISux96lMGeawHIOA,"Haaaay there. LONG time Sugar Factory fanatic here. Est 2011 when I wasn't of drinking age yet but dreamed of the day I could have a goblet. Being a SoCal native I frequented the location at the Paris Hotel often and my heart broke into a million pieces when I had seen that it closed down. Fast forward and here we are! You could not fathom my excitement as I heard this place was opening during a trip to the SF @ the miracle mile shops. Did not have as much time in Vegas this time around as I had hoped so I only got to visit once and it was a weekday. NOW with all that being let's get down to it.

Being a weekday it was not super busy but had a decent amount of people. We were seated immediately and given menus. I got my smoking goblet! (amazing) Seriously anyone whining about the price can get bent. You're paying for the brand, you get quality liquor, and great visual effects perfect for showing off to everyone on social media. DON'T COME TO VEGAS BROKE!?ANYWAY. My guy was happy you kept the pizza burger ( from the OG menu )  he loves it and talks about how he craves it and can't wait to go back. You axed my monte christo sandwich soooo I got savory crepes which were good. I couldn't really describe anyone here as friendly - maybe mildly pleasant? Our server was okay, nothing to write home about. He could have checked on us as we did have to flag him a couple times for refills. Unfortunately after the meal is where it really went downhill (please bare with me) 

Being obsessed with all things Sugar Factory I wanted the whole experience and really missed the chocolate lounge. Our server informed us they had just opened for today and we were welcome to go up and we could order dessert upstairs. Well once up there the magic kind of died. It was empty (to be expected) and this blonde bartender gave us the evil eye (yikes) I felt horrible like I had walked into someone's house. I VERY nicely apologized for bothering her and asked if we could order dessert up here. She kind of huffed and said ""yeah it's fine but what they wouldn't give you dessert downstairs?"" Ughhh I felt so uncomfortable... I told her I wanted the full experience yada yada and took a menu. Menu is great and I really wanted to relive my 18th birthday during my first visit to SF years ago with my mom when we had the chocolate fondue. But we literally just sat here. For an hour. I'm not exaggerating I promise. If I wasn't so hell bent on holding onto ""the magic"" of this place we could've walked out. We both felt crappy to bother this clearly unhappy lady that had disappeared and left us up there alone. We had to chase after her a few times and she finally took our order. We waited about another 30 minutes after this. In the meantime we heard her talking with a coworker that came up saying that she was all alone AGAIN today and basically she was understaffed and outwardly very unhappy about whoever called out or whatever. I guess that's why she was so unhappy? Well the same waiter from downstairs brought our chocolate fondue out . The chocolate was lukewarm borderline cold (idk how that's even possible). I enjoyed it for the most part I mean chocolate is good no matter what I just wish it had been warmed at least? Well it was time to go . We payed and left and I'm happy I payed extra to keep my goblet .

My husband and I ended up eating a light dinner beforehand and just splitting a goblet drink and a milkshake, which was a good idea cause I don't  know if we could have eaten dinner and our drinks, we were having trouble finishing our drinks alone. 

Service was pretty slow even though it wasn't crowded. I was disappointed that they were out of the night owl drink, so we settled on the drake. It had cotton candy on top but it melted when they poured the smoke in it. We also got the dulce de leche milkshake with chocolate and popcorn on the mug. The milkshake was pretty decent. The drink was ok but very sugary. We forced ourselves to eat all the candy in it cause it was so expensive. My husband said he was going to be in diabetic shock and have to get his leg cut off after the meal. They don't even give you a price for the goblet drinks. Luckily we had a yelp offer for 50% off a drink, otherwise it would have been $38. We also had coupons on the table for 50% off food but our waitress was kind of cold and said ""well you can only use one, which one do you want to use?""

I did like the duck theme of the place, I love ducks. The host outside was very nice and offered to take photos of the both of us sitting on the duck. I wanted to get a sparkly duck shirt but they only had kids sizes. I ended up finding one at sugar factory at the airport.

Since my last review, I got a message from Jennevive (manager) and she apologized for the subpar food and service so therefore kindly offered a free dinner on the house for me and a guest. First of all I didn't expect this kind of response... I didn't think anyone would pay attention to ONE person's bad review. But we went back to give it another chance. I immediately noticed that the music was not as loud as before (I was able to actually hold a conversation while we ate!). I must also mention that Mannie (our server) was excellent to us and treated us like VIP. He was very attentive and kind. The steak and lobster we ordered was supposed to be medium but it came out over cooked, so our server brought us another order of the same and it came out just right. Overall we were impressed with the service both from the manager and server so I did appreciate their efforts to take the time and care for a customer that has had a bad experience. It left me feeling like every customer is important to them and I was appreciative and impressed with that!",nDlXWvimtjsDdtqiSVPSLg,2,1,5,_9i3MIMWZyIK53llNET0zQ

The table behind us was getting their order taken even though they walked in more than 5 mins after us.

NOTHING!  I was looking around and NOTHING!  A few busy looking servers and a few other people with white shirts talking on their walkie talkie ear pieces... but no one to serve us or greet us.  So I got up with frustration and left.  I read about the horrible service but didn't think we'd be a victim of it too.  I saw a few other angry faces looking around for their servers as well and thought to myself , if it's taking this long to get greeted and others aren't looking too happy, what more getting a milkshake!?!  On our way out is when someone finally took notice and asked if something was wrong.... I gave them the same treatment and said NOTHING.

So we were a party of 3 & got seated almost immediately which was great. Our server comes by and says he will be right back with waters, ok cool. Didn't introduce himself at all which was odd he has a hideous ""B"" tattoo'd on his forearm though but ok we didn't make a big deal out of it. When he comes back to take our orders we started noticing that he had a bad attitude by the way he slouched over our table to take our orders. So we just ordered a few appetizers & 2 goblets. Our food came out before our goblets & our server was no where to be found. We waited about 10 mins before I had to personally go up to the bar & ask if we we're going to get our drinks or if they had forgotten about us bartender apologized & got our drink to us 5 minutes later. So our server wasn't even checking up on us so I had to ask a different server for everything that we needed which was really annoying because I used to serve & know it's annoying when you have to pick up someone else's slack, so Justin was the server who kept coming to check on us which we really appreciated since our first server was a total flop. If you're just having a bad day don't take it out on the customers because then you'll just get bad reviews like this one oh well, but justin was awesome thank you justin.",vlgvVIDyY0fYLZOS2KAO7g,0,0,2,16Seoz01YhRHAjrxLw7MEg

My friends and I decided it would be a great idea to come here before going out to the club (it was not a good idea lol). The menus have pricing for pretty much everything except the goblets which is annoying. If you check in on yelp you get 1/2 off a goblet but you can only use one yelp check in offer per table. I believe the goblets are $32-38? I can't remember but our final bill was insane. We ordered food too which I would recommend skipping. I ordered the fried macaroni balls which were good but for $13 not really worth it. Overall the goblet was cool but as you can tell it's a lot of sugar and not a lot of alcohol.

I could go somewhere else and have a comparable meal for substantially less. It was a great experience but I won't go back. The ambiance is fun, and our waitress was great!

5837466,2017-09-04,3,-oUM2uISux96lMGeawHIOA,"I looked very much forward to sampling offerings here, but the visit itself yielded mixed results.  

The ambiance was colorful, loud, lively, and bright--until lights were seriously dimmed for the night service. French Onion Soup was only okay, with a minimal amount of cheese and broth that tasted like Lipton's boxed onion soup.  To the contrary, the three meatballs covered with Marinara Sauce were very good as a featured appetizer, and Diane's trio of Fred Macaroni & Cheese Pops were nicely filled with gooey Mac 'n Cheese.  The Tomato Soup that accompanied her Grilled Cheese Sandwich was also creamy and delicious, although the sandwich itself stuck to the bread, was too dry, and the two slices were clumsily and unevenly joined.

While the soups and appetizers came out quickly, there was over a 45-minute wait for our entrees.  My party of three sat and sat while we watched other diners be seated after us, receive all of their food, and leave.  Our server said that our entrees would be coming shortly, but never admitted that a snafu had occurred in the kitchen.  This was very evident when I was presented with a bill for double what we had ordered in salads and Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.  This was promptly corrected by our server, who then acknowledged that our entree orders were rung up twice (for unknown reasons).  At least the Chicken Salad with Ginger Dressing was abundant, moist, and very good; the hand-cut French Fries excellent; and my sip of Diane's Chocolate Cookie Jar Insane Milkshake through a thick green straw, with the taste of caramel coming through the chocolate, simply outstanding.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,6,3,d0yPsXG_-ZprbGnHih0UuQ

Total $48 for this drink. It was really good and def a fun experience buuuuut it's def my last because it is not worth $48 to me. You could go on Groupon to help with the price.

John and Corey both reached out to me via Yelp, which I appreciate. 
John was able to refund all the extra charges, YAY!

So in all honestly, this restaurant is OVER - priced but that's all restaurants on the strip. Their Signature Burger is good, juicy and flavorful but I can get the same burger at a cheaper price somewhere else. Their goblets and mixed drinks are too sweet for me, but with a placed called Sugar Factory, sugar is what you will get. I felt my mixed drink didn't have enough alcohol, maybe it depends on the bartender, or the person. I'm a lightweight but still thought the drink needed more booze. I was disappointed that they ran out of their rainbow sliders, since that was the whole reason we came. They did make me blue sliders, which will have you pooping green (TMI :)). 

Our waitress, eh, she was always MIA.
It's still a cute place to bring your kids because they will enjoy it. So hopefully in the future, I'll be able to taste the rainbow sliders (yah, I know it will taste like the blue ones I got, but hey I need that pretty pic for Yelp)!",LiNr0wVEsP2yDiR885VBow,49,37,3,4hGcs6shNoQmHSMAAcQqXw

We ordered the goblet and with it came a $3 appetizer for happy hour (which you apparently need a promo card for). The goblet we got was called Energy Bear which came with burnetts watermelon vodka, grey goose vodka, and tropical fruits. It has energized gummy bears inside and topped off with a Red Bull. The goblets are filled with dry ice and they come and bring the drink mixture in a cup and the server pours it in your cup and it pretty much smokes up. We chose wings for the appetizer. Delicious Buffalo wings!!! We got The Farm burger which has an egg on top and gravy with angus beef, and comes with fries.

When I called to ask exactly where in the Fashion Show Mall this is at, the lady on the phone was very nonchalant. Additionally, the hostess was worse; didn't even properly greet us. 

There was only one server for an entire section and many customers were complaining how long everything took.

Do not order the burgers! The menu says ""grass-fed burgers"" and they cost $19. But I can tell they were frozen patties and they were dry. Go to Wendy's if you want a juicier burger. Everyone at my table agreed about the dry $19 burgers.

The premier milkshakes are what they are known for. So for $19 each, it is worth the price. However overall for you money, the untrained staff, and also how their air conditioning did not work in the middle of the summer, I will not come back.",kSOkDKEdCzDjOVFaqOcTKQ,7,0,1,G0p8Z9Znqf3EAMVtKG94HA

Our waiter Manny was accommodating. Our food and drinks all came in on good timing. I checked in on Yelp and received a %50 of a goblet. We enjoyed the watermelon goblet and hoped that the second one would be the same but it had more alcohol in it. One goblet was enough to put me and my husband on a good buzz and was enough to send us home and call it a night.
