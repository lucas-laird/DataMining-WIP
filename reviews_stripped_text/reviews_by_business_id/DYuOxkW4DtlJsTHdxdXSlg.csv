134018,2014-06-24,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"This was my first time in this restaurant. I went on Sunday and it was pretty calm , not too many people inside. I had drinks, an appetizer, entree, and desert. 

Drinks:
Frozen Bahamarita - delicious
Ultimate Pina Colada - just OK. I wish it was in a bigger class

For an appetizer I had the Adobo Chicken Taco. It was good. I liked how it had a little crunchiness to it. It was a little cold though

My entree was the Island Hopper and included onion rings, conch fritters, coconut shrimp, and Jamaican jerk wings.

I ate half an onion ring, nothing special about those since I cannot stand the taste of onions. The conch fritters should really be called conch balls. I love fried conch from this local place in Miami so that was the main reason why I decided to go with this meal, I was disappointed. They were not horrible but could have been seasoned more and they barely had any conch in them. The coconut shrimp was standard though most of the seasoning was on the outside and not the shrimp itself. Being Jamaican I always go for things that are jerked. These wings were not jerked at all. No spice or kick to them. The sauces that came with the food were soooo good!!!

For desert I had the Banana Nut Bread Supreme. It was delicious. The only negative was the stale, warm, soggy banana slice.


I will definitely be returning",X4AM6vN3cXY8DYKO59lp-g,0,0,3,oepzo8hXM1eAlZ02f98pvg

She was so knowledgeable about the drink menu, the appetizers, and the background of the different foods that I literally felt as if I were in the Bahamas and completely forgot I was in Las Vegas. After ordering our drinks and food came out quickly and everything was DELICIOUS! What truly made my experience amazing was Anita! She was fun, personable, and really demonstrated the epitome of what I consider a phenomenal customer service experience! Because of her service this will now be my go-to drinks & appetizers choice when scheduling my weekly hangouts with friends and coworkers. And yes, I will be requesting Anita every time! I was so impressed with Anita's service that I literally chased the manager Sean down just to rave about Anita. To my surprise, considering he was busy, my interrupting him didn't phase him one bit.

228134,2012-08-21,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"The hardest thing is deciding where to start, especially considering I never write reviews.  We had never been to Bahama Breeze before and with trying any new place there is always that slight worry. We walked up to a restaurant that looks as if it was flown in from the Caribbean up to the hostess' stand and were warmly greeted. We were shown our way to the table and were given their menu which has an extensive selection, especially the house cocktails. We were delightlfully greeted by our server Sandra and we informed her it was our first time and we would need a moment to take in the vast menu. She was truly polite and gave us some suggestions and brought us our water while we mulled everything over, that's when our excitement started going up as we looked at the specialty drinks. 

I'm not a drinker and the fact that these drinks caught my eye is a good sign. We started off by ordering a truly delicious Bahama Margharita (an infusion of pineapple, strawberry and kiwi with tequila) and my girlfriend a Strawberry Banana Daquiri. Both drinks made to perfection. We started our appatizers in a simple manner with wonderfully crisp coconut shrimp as well as chips and salsa, both which were brought to us very quickly, while we continued to look at the menu. All the while Sandra keeping an eye on us and ensuring our satisfaction. Finally we decided to settle on the Baby Back Ribs for myself an the Filet Mignon for her. 

The meal was astounding. The ribs were falling off the bone and well sauced, and the mashed potatoes I requested with them were delicously creamy and flavorful. My girlfriends filet was cooked to perfection and her sides were enjoyed with gusto. We ordered another round of drinks (keep in mind drinks aren't my thing so they must be good for me to order another) but we decided to try something different. My girlfriend tried The Blue (something, I don't recall the rest of the name sadly) and I enjoyed the Berry Berry Good. Both of us would share drinks to try more of a variety and we fell absolutey in love with the Berry Berry Good, as i quote my girlfriend, ""next time I'm getting five of these.'  I'm confident I will as well.

Next we go on to the dessert. When we are as stuffed as were at the end of a meal we don't even consider it, but we figured this place has been so amazing how can we say no? Dulce de Leche Cheesecake and a Chocolate Island (a chocolate cake with chocolate mousse sitting in a delicate sea of a vanilla bean sauce) I didn't want to take it home, i just wanted to eat everything there and get another order to go, it was that incredible. We were so delighted at the end of the meal and asked to see the manager (Jesse is his name) and couldn't begin to describe how happy we were.

All this alone provides something worth noting, but what will truly brings us back beyond anything else is Sandra. We can confidently say that she is without a doubt the greatest server we have ever had. Truly charismatic and professional. When were were looking at our menus in the beggining we saw that she was busy but never once did she let that bother her nor take away from the quality she was providing not just us but everyone. We had great conversations with her and never once did we feel rushed or neglected, it was the exact opposite. She made our night, so much so that on the drive home we were still talking about how amazing she is (plus the quality of the restaurant) We will absolutely make sure that when we go in next we will request her (and if there's a wait we will not mind at all) I cannot stress enough how she truly is the greatest server we have ever had. She is a gem that must never be lost. 

Everything about this place is remarkable. They took two first time diners and in one fantastic experience made us die hard fans.",3aW0p4TEkkCnZ5iPyAR78g,2,0,5,UTXJKLJjNuWCb0FKEiDVrg

310764,2014-08-25,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"It has been a few years since we have eaten here and were looking forward to our favorite sandwiches for lunch. First let me say, that service here is hit or miss. Sometimes it is fabulous. Other times, horrible. There is no in between. This was a horrible time - waitress would not shut up, did not accept that we did not want alcoholic drinks or appetizers and tried to push them on us, she pulled a menu one of my party was holding and started flipping through it, insisted on telling us the ""specials"" despite we knew what we wanted.... anyway - we were looking forward to the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Portabello Mushroom Sandwich. Both were a disappointment - chicken was like rubber, bread tasted bad (not ciabatta anymore). The portabello sandwich was mashed flat as if someone sat on it and the vegetables were diced small and indistinguishable. More so - for a Saturday lunch it was dead... not the normal for this place. Usually it is busy. Looking out the window we got to watch a drunk/high gentleman purusing the parking lot, and then when we left we were confronted by a man who ""wanted to ask us questions"" and when we refused he started swearing, dropping the f-bomb and being obnoxious. It was very unsettling to our group - family members from seniors down to children. The place has not been kept up - although when we entered there was a young girl cleaning the windows, the table was dirty, the ledge where the plants are was full of dust, the menus had food on them. No reason for that. 

The area this restaurant is in has certainly changed tremendously and as well, other restaurants in the area seemed to have changed hands/chains as well. If you are on the Strip, I would advise you to stay there and eat. It is not worth the taxi ride over there and I certainly would not advise you to walk down there from your hotel. 

This used to be a popular place for lunch for the UNLV crowd, and possibly during the week things are different. But don't waste your time.",jhcgwMjFKvEORQ3NucJnTg,0,0,1,mydz_h2ncinllKeAbW5Mdw

358754,2007-01-04,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"I have family that lives near there and we seem to eat at Bahama Breeze every time I am in Vegas.  Pretty good 'island' food and a fun environment for the money, and you will definitely not leave hungry, I have had leftovers each time I ate there.

You HAVE TO get their Cuban Bread for an appetizer, it is pretty simple but my mouth waters just thinking about it.  I have had the paella, coconut shrimp, a chicken pasta dish, and a lobster/shrimp pasta dish and I would order any of them again.  There was something about the chicken pasta dish that I REALLY enjoyed, a tangy garlic cream combo flavor and really tender chicken and mushrooms.

Their red beer is satisfying and for only a couple bucks for a 20oz mug you can definitely throw back a few with no damage to the wallet.  They also have a lot of frozen mixed drinks that looked good but I cant comment on them as I mainly stick to beer when I have a drink. Enjoy!",2yFtDIokY7IBRHi4VoGNuQ,0,0,4,Hnj3TCiz6j0BVIW0Jc2Uuw

My wife and I each choose a different fresh fish which came with rice or mashed potatoes and green beans.  We specifically asked to have our veggies cooked and not served crunchy like so many restaurants serve.   The meal did not come with soup nor salad not even bread.  We asked about bread but was told we could order a loaf for extra charge.  I did added a side lobster tail for an extra $9.99.   When our meal came the green beans were not cooked hardly at all.  They did offer to bring more.  Our mash potatoes were warm but not hot.  The fish was good but not great and they forgot my side lobster tail.  The manager came over and apologized which was nice but did not offer anything other than his apology.  I would have declined a free dessert but that would have been appropriate.

Appetizer of West Indies beef patty was delicious. You could probably buy them in bulk at Costco. The mango salsa served with it was also tasty (I usually don't like mango salsa)

Chicken and steak skewers were ok, but there was nothing very Bahamian about them - served with grilled peppers and mushrooms. The rice/beans served beneath the skewers were dry.

Our server was a really nice guy. He recommended my drink, but I didn't have the heart to complain about it.

The food was pretty good as always but the service was probably a 2 out of 10. Your server can make or break your experience and our server broke it. From our initial greeting to leaving it seemed she was going through the motions. I noticed other tables had a candle lit. Ours was unlit. I waited 15 minutes and finally lit it my self. Our server just did not want to give us the experience we deserved. Maybe our server was having a bad day or just tired as it was 8:30-9:30 pm. She just didn't smile or seemed enthused
about serving us. I was also unhappy that they did not sing to my sister and charged 8 bucks for her birthday desert. I have never been charged before at any establishment. My Mojito was all ice. I think the bartender needs a lesson from Havana Grill in Henderson on a proper Mojito. Seafood Paella, wood fire chicken and burger were good but not great. I hope our next experience will be back to the standards we expect from Darden and especially Bahama Breeze.

UPDATE:
The manager called me today 03/10/13 and offered to make it right.He also stated his first priority was to ensure that i will have a good experience...I want to thank the manager for the phone call and glad to see Bahama Breeze cares about the satisfaction of their costumers.......",BECNMzLRiFj3y5k7G4rshA,3,0,3,wxq3fsAHWAIK87Gl47eccg

An amazing alcoholic drink menu (Painkiller, a bunch of mojitos) as well as some of the best lemonade you'll ever have (Lemon Breeze).

We typically have great service.  This last time featured a waiter that was very into his job and described menu items with words like ""exquisite.""  It's refreshing to have a waiter who is knowledgeable and happy to help.  The decor is clean and aesthetically pleasing.

We decided to start with the Tostones appetizer, though we weren't quite sure what to expect.  The plantains were crispy and the flavors diverse and delicious.  Despite not being much of a seafood eater, I always go with the fresh fish at the front of the menu.  Normally, it's the mango glazed tilapia.  This time I went with the Mahi Mahi as per the waiter's recommendation.  It wasn't as good as the tilapia, but it was still yummy.  My wife's curry bowl was equally as appetizing.

Our service was very good (Thanks Sparky!)  My wife had the curry chicken for dinner...it was so dry and lacked flavor she could not eat it.  She ordered a strawberry magarita and she got a mango margarita instead.  We sent it back and this time it came back with only a little mango in it.  WTF?  The bartender could not make a most simple drink?!?!  To top off our drink issues...The pour on the tequila had to have been a 1/2 ounce if that...it was like drinking mix only and then it was served in a martini glass!.  If you don't have margarita glasses put it in a hurricane glass, those they had..  I had the paella and a couple of beers...it was a safe bet .  My daughter had the jerk chicken pasta, again, just okay, kind of lackluster in flavor.  To drink, she ordered a Bailey's and coffee...served in a regular ol' coffee mug.  A place like this I would have expected a clear mug to showcase the drink...nope, didn't happen.  I know some of this may seem like petty things but...our bill was close to $100 for the 3 dinners, drinks oh...and an appetizer.  The entrees did not come with any type of salad offering either.  Over priced and the Monday night bartender(s) needs a bit work.  We did voice our comments to the manager (actually we were going to leave and our server sent the manager to us!).  He said he will talk to his staff and try to fix things.  He did give us 3 comp drink tickets to use anytime.

It was not my first choice to go to..honestly I'd only seen this place in passing on my way to the airport.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, nice big building on the corner of Paradise and Flamingo on the Northwest side.  Walking in, however, you feel transported to another place with the Caribbean theme of the restaurant and bar.

However, like a friend has told me, you can't necessarily paint something to make it what it ain't.

The food here is expensive for what you get.  We ordered quite a bit of food for the party: Spinach Dip and Island Chips, Island Onion Rings, West Indies Patties, and Creole Baked Goat Cheese to start.  None of these, to me, were particularly good.  The Spinach Dip was not even touched as my friend ordered it and then tried to pass it along to everyone else because she hated it.  The entree's were a little better: Cuban Sandwich and Margarita Chicken.  However for the $10 and $15 plates of food, I've had much better.

The service was slow for a slow Wednesday early evening dinner.  It was nice that we were able to sit in the atrium outside that was nicely cooled.  All in all, this seems like a poorly done chain restaurant based on a Caribbean theme.

They recently changed up their menu to include rice bowls.  And boy, the Carnitas bowl is pretty amazing.  I will be ordering that often;  It's a new regular dish for me. 

The reason this place hasn't earned 5 starts, is because their key lime pie leaves a lot to be desired (both my wife and I agree on this).

For dinner, I ate the lobster and shrimp pasta, without mushrooms, which had very little sauce, but was better than the one at Red Lobster. Our waiter was hilarious and also gave the birthday girl a long sugar cane, yes, sugar cane which was talked about for a good minute. My drink also came with a sugar cane inside of it, the Lemon Breeze, which I added strawberries too. Overall, the place was chill and the food was good, but not great.

Two of my favorites that I've never gone wrong with:

Jerk Shrimp w/ Cuban bread is the best, best, best.  I have had their appetizer sampler which was very filling also, but I highly recommend the Jerk Shrimp over that if you're hungry.  

On the lighter, yet EXTREMELY good side is their Avocado stuffed Crabmeat salad!  Real crab meat & lots of it, stuffed into one avocado.  The salad is light & flavorful.  I love it & crave it all over again just writing this.  Next time, I'm gonna ask for extra crab, no salad cause I don't eat too many tomatoes & there's a lot.  

Also a reminder to self, Margarita Flight or Sampler!  I have to try this next time.  I usually get the KJ Chardonnay.  

Our server Kurt was friendly, helpful, & although it was packed & super busy, he was always there.  Immediately got a knife to cut mom's Apple Bacon Cheddar Burger (she loved it), & a to-go box.

We started with drinks & appetizers:  Rumrunner for the wife, a mojito for me, with coconut shrimp and conch fritters.  Rumrunner was delicious, but the mojito was not tasty and not well executed (mint wasn't muddled, lime wedges were un-squeezed and rock-hard, and it had crushed ice instead of cubes).  Shrimp and conches were both delicious, but they had the same sauce, which is a very minor criticism.

We had our minds on paella, which we ordered, and after all the fried stuff, we wanted something vegetable-y, which was not on the menu (unless you count salads, which we were not in the mood for).  On inquiring we were informed that there were broccoli, green beans, and asparagus available, of which we ordered the first two.  To our surprise and delight, the vegetables were nicely cooked and delicious.  The paella was awesome, especially considering they did not skimp on the seafood.  My wife didn't like the style of rice, but I thought it was appropriate.  It was also too much for us, and we ended up taking it home.  Since I'm writing this the day after our visit and I just had a fairly large portion of paella leftovers, I can report that it was maybe even better the next day.  

Back to our visit, we were too full for dessert, so I just ordered an Irish coffee, which even after I verified that they would make it the proper way (coffee, Irish whiskey, and whipped cream), the waiter came back with this drink that he said had Kahlua in it, which I summarily sent back whence it came, which I felt they could have been a little more apologetic about.  The real drink, when it came back, kind of had an aftertaste like bottom-shelf spirits. 

The ambiance was nice.  There was a musician playing tropical-themed music, which we quite enjoyed.  The service was fairly good but not superb; no complaints.",lzhCDn5P-VpmunHgx15PWg,0,0,4,P9jpGSvgRspMh1qjDyRW2g

I was solo so decided to seat at the bar and blend in into the party ambiance, although not planned that way I landed there during happy hour which gave my gift card extra buying power.
As I waited patiently at the bar a couple sat by me and were instantly acknowledged and asked if they wanted drinks, they ordered two mojitos and the bartender left to make them, when she came back with their drinks she asked them if they were ready to order, it was then that I realized I have the power of being invisible if no one is looking. I sort of interrupted and asked if I could have a drink and that I was ready to order, she took their order and then took mine giving me that ""can't you wait for your turn? look""
I ordered the paella which was very good although not authentic for it was made with long grain rice but the result was the same, a delicious zafron rice dish loaded with seafood! I also got the coconut shrimp with some kind of sweet n sour sauce that was equally delicious as the paella, there are also many more items on the menu that I would love to try like the Jamaican chicken or firecracker shrimp they both sounded good I just didn't have the belly space but I'm working on expanding.
The setting is also very nice, the building is like a large plantation house very spacious with high ceilings and nice breezy caribbean atmosphere with indoor and outdoor sections.   
The waitress returned to ask the people by my side if everything was ok, they asked her if she could take their picture and I took advantage of the opportunity and asked her for my check hoping not to interrupt a perfect customer waitress relation.

I keep hearing good things about this place, but I was disappointed. They sat us in the patio area. The patio is a nice open window area with a gas fireplace in the center. The fire creates a nice mood and the fresh air is lovely. However, its not the greatest on a warm day. Also you can smell the gas or propane that fuels the fire when down wind. It can be nauseating after a while. Our server is a nice guy, but noticeably disinterested. We place our order with an appetizer. The appetizer is delivered but utensils or napkins were not provided. We flagged an employee, and let him know we didn't have any napkins or utensils. A few minutes later he produced a handful of cocktail napkins. We needed to flag another person for the rest. The appetizer tasted horrible. Ahi tuna should not have a heavy fish flavor. Our main order was delivered by an individual who was not amused by our misunderstanding of what he said when asking ""who ordered what"". It was clear that he was quite unhappy with this duty. I had ordered a Cuban sandwich. It tasted fine, but was ordinary. You can find the same quality at any subway or port of subs. Nothing impressive.

With $5 Wines, $5 Well Drinks, and half-off appetizers what is not to love? My highlights were their Jamaican Chicken Wings and Coconut Shrimp paired with a Frozen Bahamarita. They have something for everyone, their menu ranging from dishes of all sizes.

We started off ordering the panko onion rings as an appetizer, They were pretty good, I'm not a fan of panko bread crumbs but my friend is so we got them. We also got a side caesar salad, It was so light and delicious. It also had shaved pieces of parmesan cheese and the croutons tasted homemade. 

For the entree, we decided to split the Calypso Shrimp Linguine, the menu said it had shrimp in every bite so I needed to see if that was true. I love shrimp so I had to try it. They gave us the plate and there was a lot of shrimp, I mean, a lot! It was awesome! The linguine was perfectly cooked al dente, the pasta was sauteed with garlic, onion and tomatoes with a hint of spice and cream. The amount of cream was perfect and not overwhelming and there literally was shrimp in every bite. Pastas are usually topped with shrimp, this one also had shrimp in between. It was so good and the price was awesome! $18.00 for a large portion which my friend and I could not finish. We left some pasta, I ate all the shrimp and enjoyed every single one of them.

The desserts looked yummy but we could not try them because we were stuffed.

1460862,2015-08-09,1,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"I'm reviewing this place mostly for their amazing happy hour!

First of all it's a bahama themed restaurant for eating island favorites, tapas, and even drinking. I'm a big fan of their appetizers alone. During happy hour, all appetizers are half off so that's what my friends and I usually do. They also have a to-go menu for those on a tight schedule and wanna grab and go. 

This is to get an idea of their schedule:
Store Schedule // Sunday - Saturday: 11AM - 12AM
Happy Hour // Monday - Friday: 4PM - 6PM
Late Night Happy Hour // Sunday - Thursday: 9PM - 12AM

Happy Hour includes these appetizers to much on (and the portions are pretty big):
-Beef Empanadas
-Firecracker Shrimp
-Chicken Quesadilla
-Firecracker Shrimp Street Tacos 
-Pork Carnitas Street Tacos 
-Adobo Chicken Street Tacos 
-Lobster & Shrimp Quesadilla 
-Skillet Simmered Jerk Shrimp 
-Coconut Shrimp
-Jumbo Lump Crab Stack 
-Warm Spinach Dip and Chips 
-Jamaican Chicken Wings Tostones with Chicken 
-Crispy Onion Rings 
-Habanero Chicken Wings

SO MUCH VARIETY HONESTLY. GOOD PRICE FOR GREAT QUALITY!

The place is clean, especially their bathroom, and I've heard their drinks are pretty amazing (they also have hand-crafted drinks for happy hour).

I recommend this place if you're hungry at night and looking for something cheap for big amounts to fill you up! Also, just go to their happy hour!",wzMXdjM-_DlDBkpg3xKnGQ,4,2,4,OH7UYncAuXNssNklZFH2ig

Then came the most flamboyant black male waiter ever. For some reason he completely lost it when I inquired about the chicken quesadilla. He told me they weren't that good and I still decided to try them. He then, while rolling his eyes, said,"" so you're going to try something and then send it back if you don't like it, AFTER I just told you it's not that good?"" I replied,""yes!"" 

So the food was bought to the table and the food was freshly cook, and quesadilla was good. There were two male waiters that for some reason were extra loud and at times inappropriate. For example this waiter at my table continued to make it obvious that he was addressing my girlfriend alone, right from the moment he first approached the table. 

At some point, I'll return to the restaurant but they lost points with me. We were having a great night and this experience with the waiter messed the vibe up, completely.",-Wd_SCRLmBeRH8c-TmJ55A,1,0,3,a3pdVUSTRiGD0ZNgFmDOVw

Let's start with the Cons.... there isn't a location in Southern California.  Then again, id probably spend my rent money eating there all the time.  

The Service: Is always wonderful. Haven't had a bad experience yet.  The staff is always helpful and pleasant.  So cheers to them!

The Atmosphere: Wonderful!  For someone who has been to the ""islands"" this place is a good representation.  From the ceiling fans to the music being played.  Not loud, but mellow music.  Helps the food go down better... screw the sugar.

The Food:  OMG! Even if everything else was horrible the Food is so good you'd ignore it.

Jerk Chicken- my mouth is watering just thinking of them.  They have the perfect amount of jerk flavoring and are fried or baked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside.  We made a mistake of sharing an order. Bad idea.  These are too good to share.

Beef Patties- Yummy! If flavor and good food aren't you thing... steer clear of this option. Truly a mouth satisfying appetizer.

Seafood Paella-So I have had Paella at a number of locations and this is one of the best.  The whole dish is a burst of happiness in your mouth.  I've had this 2 of the last 3 times I went here.  Everything else just doesn't seem to catch my eye.....

Another 5 Star visit on a warm Saturday night. I made a reservation a couple days ahead, for myself and a few of my girlfriends. I was just a little disappointed that they didn't have the Reggae band playing. 

Overall the service was outstanding. Our waiter was very attentive & efficient. 
Now to the delicious food.
Here's what we opted for:
Taste of Jamaica - 
Awesome jerk pork, jerk chicken, beef empanada, callaloo, sweet plantains, white rice and black beans. Respek the flavor. Love, loved it. 
My very favorite is the Lobster & Shrimp quesadillas. This is a must try. There's no other like it. Two thumbs up!
Caribbean style lobster Mac&Cheese - 
Lightly fried lobster tail with Bahamian mac & cheese. AMAZING! 

Drinks
Goombay Smash - very strong but good. 
Yaka Hula - Bacardi Black Rum, pineapple juice for a tropical tribute to Island romance. This sweet cocktail was inspired by a Hawaiian love song. Excellent drink. One of my favorites.
Pineapple Coconut martini- This is one Sexy drink. Loved it.

My fellow yelpers, I would not steer you wrong, if you're tired of buffet food, fancy expensive hotel dining, come to Bahama Breeze. Prices are very reasonable. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. I will always be a returning customer.",Up9tl2tWj32ehvSzNE0Zkg,17,14,5,TdzvdYCzJnlfmnp3fvraAA
1820309,2015-03-29,2,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"Although I've only been to Bahama Breeze in Las Vegas once, I've been plenty of times in Jacksonville Florida when I used to live there, even celebrated my birthday there. So I think due time for a review.

This restaurant is actually one of my favorite places to dine; it's not ""fine"" dining, but it's not cheap casual. It's a nice in between kinda place, affordable but definitely appropriate for special occasions 

They have awesome fruity speciality drinks but also a full bar so your dark liquors as well and standard type drinks. They have HH from 9pm-close Sunday thru Thursday which is great for Vegas! Love reserve HH!! And their HH includes food items as well. 

This BB is way bigger here in Vegas than the one in Jacksonville. Bigger restaurant means bigger decor and displays inside. Pretty standard dim lighting and Caribbean decor. We came on a Friday and surprisingly it was not busy at all. They had a small dj at the outside patio playing hip hop music that did not seem to fit the theme for the restaurant but the inside music was more fitting and appropriate to the island theme. 

They have a wide variety menu all incorporating an island type theme and taste, but I love how their menu is separated and really makes selection an easy task. 

I'm a sucker for their establishment favorite the Coconut Shrimp. I think I get it every time as an appetizer! The crispy coconut batter on the butterfly shrimps are fried to perfection and that citrus mustard dipping sauce is almost like a marmalade glaze. Not too sweet tho and that mustard almost like a Dijon flavor gives it a nice kick! Definitely one of my fav dishes here. 

My family was having seafood this night (we refrain from meat on Fridays during Lent) and this place has lots of seafood options, well lots of options period. We had the Key West Shrimp and Grits, Calypso Shrimp Linguine, the Fish Tacos, and the Island Hopper (it comes with jerk chicken but we just saved it to bring home). 

The shrimp and grits was good, but I wish there was more grits that came with the dish. But the garlic light cream sauce on the shrimp was good and not too heavy, just right. The green beans at accompanied the dish were good, just needed a dab on pepper. 

The calypso shrimp linguine was the best tasting of the 4 main dishes we ordered. My sisters dish so I can only comment on that I tried a little bit of it, but it was enough and tasted good enough that when I go back I want that to be my order!! It's like a light pink sorta sauce, white cream sauce but with the Caribbean flavors and spices it turns it sorta pink ish. Every good and sauce was not too heavy at all. 

My dad had fish tacos accompanied by fries and guacamole. The guc was really good but the tacos shells were a bit too hard. 

The island hopper actually is listed as an appetizer, but mom got it as a main entreè.  Comes with coconut shrimp, coconut batter covered onion rings, shrimp stuffed hush puppies and jerk chicken. The onion rings were good and the coconut batter adds a nice twist of flavor. The hush puppies also very good. I like that they were not too dense, and nice a light almost fluffy. The dish also comes with the citrus mustard and a pineapple chutney - which also tasted like a sweet with a kick pineapple marmalade or glaze!! You can eat the chutney straight, it's so yummy. 

Also the bathrooms are big and nice and I like how the have little mouthwash cups and mouthwash available at the sink so if you're going out straight after dinner, that least you good on the breath check 

The place is a chain restaurant, so you get what you expect, but it's great food, reasonable pricing, appropriate for special occasions but not going to blow your wallet like if you were to eat somewhere on strip in Las Vegas and probably get less quantity. It's a good vibes sorta place and the service is good!! S/O to our server Matt for taking good care of us!!

I would like to mention that the service here is phenomenal. Our waitress, Tina, was probably one of the nicest waitresses I have had in along time. She was personable, she would talk and joke with us and just super nice. I have no complaints about service at all. 

The atmosphere in this place is pretty rad as well. There was live music, a little covered deck with a fire pit, and a lot of cool decorations that made for a great environment. This place is mainly a seafood restaurant, so if that's not your thing then this place probably isn't for you. I'm a huge seafood fan so I loved it. 

Last of all, the sought after pina colada that we were searching town for were hands down the best I've ever had! There was more to it than just your average pina colada, it was called the ""ultimate pina colada"" for a reason. Me and my girlfriend both were very impressed with it. We weren't too hungry so we just got some street tacos to shared and they were great as well.

We sat and hung out at this place and just talked for a while because it was such a great environment to just relax and have a great time.

1905409,2014-12-30,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"We decided to avoid the craziness of the strip & come here for dinner last night, thinking it would be less busy. It was a lot less busy but very understaffed. We had to wait almost 40 min for a table for 4 at an almost empty restaurant. We were seated at around 10:30 pm. 

To be fair - the food was not bad. What was most upsetting is that I ordered the rice bowl with shrimp & fish. A few bites in, I bit into something hard. I thought it was a fish bone but it was a sharp jagged piece of a plastic - probably the remnants of a food container about an inch long and wide. I told the server & she asked if I wanted my dish replaced and I said no as I did not want to wait for another plate at that time of night as our kids were very tired. She showed the plastic object to her manager & I was waiting to see what he/she would say or do. Well the disappointing outcome is they did nothing. No apology from the manager & we got charged for my dish. Very disappointing.  

This is not the first time we have found unwelcome objects in our food at restaurants. In fact once at BJ's my sons Mac & Cheese had the corner of a plastic bag in it but we did not say anything as it was large enough to see & not harmful. The sever saw it as she collected the plates & reported it to the manager. She came to our table to apologize & said we would not be charged for the dish. 

So to the manager of the Bahama Breeze - your management skills need some fine tuning to say the least. Your food quality control obviously needs some work. It's not OK to find sharp plastic objects in our food & it's especially not OK for you to ignore it. Very disappointing.",yq6xcLXaDt5IjTbJXtZJWw,0,0,1,iYDbjsHgummR652VH9L64g

1910264,2014-04-28,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"Great layout, music, etc; relaxing atmosphere. 

I was in Vegas for a work convention (exciting, I know) and on the way to the airport, for the last couple of hours, I wanted something quick and easy... but relaxing.  My local friends wanted to meet here for Happy Hour.  

I got here around 4:30 on a Monday.  I really love being able to just park and walk up in Vegas. Eating on the strip is a whole process of parking and walking through casinos... that's like a wasted 20 minutes there, another 20 back.  A place like this, nice and easy.  

The layout is great.  It goes for a Caribbean/Cuban feel, especially outside, without feeling cheesy.  Nice shutters on the enclosed patio area, warm air coming in, sunny... just a very relaxed atmosphere where you really don't feel like you're in Vegas.  I felt like I was on vacation, actually, which sounds cheesy but it's true.  The restaurant was pretty open, though, but it was a weekday.  

Now, the food...

Happy Hour is an amazing deal.  It's like $5-something per dish and beers and drinks are from $2-$3....!?  What... the... hell!  So good.   

We were starving so we got almost one of everything; the jerk chicken, pork sliders, burger sliders, empandas, quesadilla, coconut shrimp, etc.  Everything was great.  My friends were a little hesitant about the jerk chicken because it was black, due to the rub, but it was great.   My friends had a pineapple coconut martini (great), mojito (they loved it, had real sugar cane), I had a hefeweizen.   

So basically, you can't miss at Happy Hour - everything was great.

This is a small detail that I really appreciate. In the men's bathroom, they have mouthwash dispensers. It's a great touch because, let's be honest, your breath after eating isn't going to be the best so this is a great way to hit the reset button.

Our server was an absolute jerk who refused to give us menus because we sat down in the bar table area without getting menus from the dimwitted hostess. Then he went off on a tangent about how there was a miscommunication and we should not have been seated without menus. He is the definition of a low wage uneducated worker. So then i go to the bar and tell the bartender i want two drinks for me and my date (who looked better in her photos ) and he says he will let our server know because im in his section. I go off on the dude because i just want to get two drinks and carry them the 2 feet from the bar to the table right behind me, but he refused to do this cause it wasn't fair to the server. What a bunch of degenerates at this chain hell. The manager came over and eventually offered to buy me 2 drinks, but hell no because he defended his erver. Ended up walking out on my ugly date, who was sitting at the table wondering what the hell she should do and also this Bahama Breeze forever.

Located on the corner of Flamingo & Paradise, there is indoor and outdoor seating and a decent amount of parking.

I came here last week for lunch with 5 of my co-workers.  They ask where we would like to sit.  We asked if we could sit in the ""patio"" area; its this big round room and the windows can open when it's nice outside.  So they take us to the table; there are only 3 seats.  We look at the guy that brought us to our table and we say ""this table is a little too small, there are 5 of us"" and he says ""yes, I know.  I have no idea why they brought you out here.  Unfortunately, there isn't any tables out here big enough for your group.""  We tell him no problem and sit us wherever there is room.

He takes us back inside to the room behind the bar and sits us at a table that is set for 4 people, but enough room for 5.

We ordered a handful of appetizers and each of us ordered entrees.  I ordered the combination chicken & veggie quesadilla and a caesar salad.  The caesar was barely dressed and wasn't that good anyways.  Now, I've had the lobster quesadilla here before and it was gross.  So I thought chicken and fresh vegetables couldn't be that bad.  Well, it's not good.  I don't know how to put it.  But the flavor sucks.

The food:

Lobster and Shrimp Quesadilla- It was good but I imagined something different so it was tasty but I felt it was missing a bit more flavor. Glad I tried it but I'll probably go with something else next time.

Seafood Chowder- That was delicious, had a good amount of shrimp and vegetables and was creamy, I loved it.

Cobb Salad- It was big and came with the usual fixings but I've had better cobb's in my life. 

Coconut Shrimp- Mmm...mmm...mmm...a must if you eat at this restaurant. Perfectly fried and packed with flavor.

Chocolate Pineapple Cake- I don't like chocolate but I do love pineapple and this dessert called to me. It was warm, rich, and melted in my mouth. I suggest sharing because it's very decadent...I needed a glass of water when I finished.

My entree was their special: A lobster, shrimp, and mussel bowl with baby potatoes and butternut squash, swimming in a tomato herb soup also served with French bread for dipping.  Slightly different seasoning compared to the Italian or cuban versions I've had before, with similar seasoning as their jerk shrimp, but not overpowering.

I saw ahi on the menu and I knew I had to have it. I've been on a real tuna kick lately and the menu pic looked divine. When I received my plate... after a very long wait it looked exactly like the menu. It was stunning. 

Sadly it didn't taste like they seared the tuna in sesame oil, so there wasn't a ton of flavor. Also it was an appetizer and not an entree. I knew this going in, but there was no entree sized ahi, and I wanted ahi bad. I ate it and I was still hungry. I resorted to stealing french fries off my husband's plate when he wasn't looking. 

The decor was beautiful and there is even a fun little waterfall and river running through the restraunt. I had lots of time to walk around and snap photos because the service was exceptionally slow. The iced tea tasted fresh brewed and was quite good. Despite slow service, my glass was usually full so I was grateful for that. 

So the bottom line... It was ok. I will be back. I wish they had a full size ahi salad, and I wish they used sesame oil to sear and maybe a touch of wasabi on the side just for fun. I've had better tasting dishes here that were more filling, so maybe next time I'll grab the entree portion of the shrimp instead.",IamJ-OX89_P-i-xkknwpPA,7,10,3,tqe5CFBcKl3Nm0YsvfmHYg

The entrees need some work though.  They all tend to be really greasy.  I did not see one pasta without cream sauce, except on the kids menu.  You can make some ok food here if you are creative, but it'll take you about 5 minutes to order with all the special requests.  My favorite is probably the chicken kabob with steamed broccoli instead of rice.  Yes, even the rice was too greasy for me.

I guess the food is just bland enough to appeal to the masses, and it's just cheesy enough to be ""fun"" (read Tchotchke's in Office Space). From the music, to the decor, to the food, this place is just packed with epic fail. I wanted to shoe the bargain basement Jimmy Buffet square in the nuts, not that I enjoy the real one by any stretch of the imagination.

We had the calamari appetizer, thinking it was a safe bet, and it was astonishingly rubbery. I mean, there's rubbery calamari, then there's this; it's like the difference between vulcanized rubber and the stuff they use in rubber bands. I ordered the seafood paella, and the waiter remarked that it was his favorite dish and it was just fantastic. The guy's nuts. There couldn't have been more wrong with it, save for the fish showing up raw (it was overcooked instead). Absolutely no flavor. They must not put any salt in the pot when they cook the rice, because I don't think there's any other way to make rice this unexciting. I suspect the origin of its yellow-orange hue didn't come from saffron, either. Don't remember what my fiance ordered, and neither does she, but we both remember it sucked. Bland, unexciting, chain-wide recipes aside, this kitchen had some serious issues seasoning their food properly.

All that, a beer, and a margarita for $53. What a gyp.",Hzt4UPkvv7VXHXVBAlfIqw,0,0,1,88X1jYBfYPEy5KJeTYRUKA

Now i;m not a big fan of spicy food, but I enjoy some good flavor. Those jamaican jerk chicken wings are phenominal. Its the right amount of heat with the the best amount of absolute great flavor.

So while visiting LV, I learned there was a location there and had to go! HUGE mistake! It started with a very nice waitress who came to my table... it started like this,
 
'Today's specials are A, B, C, and D. We are out of A and B, and if you want C, we no longer have chorizo that goes in it but we can substitute it for something else.'

Um what??! 

So we asked her for her suggestions and her 'most recommended' items were the Lobster Linguine and the Key West Shrimp and Grits. My husband and I ordered both dishes. Disgusting. You know what this reminded me of? It reminded me of something premade that comes in a bag and thrown in boiling water to heat up.

Really disappointed. We had just wasted money on food that tasted nasty and we were walking out hungry. Never, ever, again. Visited this location June 2014.",TrFyfKS_QasaUqfICW6Lzw,3,1,1,r9lzEEUOvJIVjPylE5SptA

The bahamarita was super delicious. Order it if you like tropical goodness, margarita style. If you like coconut..like the malibu rum coconut, you would love the Pineapple Coconut Margarita. Not my cup of tea, but could be yours! I wouldn't recommend the Mojito Cubano unless you're looking for an average glass of mojito. 

Recommendations off appetizers:
Coconut shrimp- Perfect balance of shrimp and batter. Flavor was on point as well. 
Crispy onion rings- JUMBO sized onion rings
Jumbo Lump Crab Cake- Crab can taste a little like the sea, but the shrimp avocado and mango salsa made up for it. This dish tasted really fresh, I would recommend it if you like crab and shrimp. 
Warm spinach dip, chips, and salsa- The salsa was delicious! Artichoke was mediocre. 

Chicken quesadillas- Nothing special
Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sliders- This was okay, wasn't extra savory or anything. 
Habanero wings- Disappointment. Wasn't spicy at all.

2491252,2016-07-21,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"We had a gift card that was good for one of several different restaurants, including the Yard House and Olive Garden. But the one that looked the most appealing (mostly, since we'd never heard of it) was Bahama Breeze. Seeing that the closest location was the one in Vegas, we saved the gift card for our trip to the Strip.

Walking in this place was like entering into a different world. It was amazing. They don't commit to theme so blatantly like Rainforest Cafe or places like that, but in a natural and organic way where it still feels homey. 

The lady who sat us down spent a couple minutes explaining to us what she liked best on the menu. Then, our waiter, Eamon, got over to us and he, too, gave us his take on the menu, breaking down each section, since he knew we had never been there before. 

I'm the type of guy that likes to get what's popular at any restaurant, so he informed me that the Jerk Chicken was their best item. 

I was hesitant about it, because jerk chicken has not really ever been my style. But with risk comes reward, and this reward was worth it.

The meal ($17) came with three large pieces of bone-in chicken, black beans, rice, and plantains. The chicken was some of the most moist I've ever eaten, and the spices on the chicken loaded it with some amazing flavors without ever being too spicy. You'll definitely remember the taste more than the spiciness. The black beans were probably the best I've had. And the plantains were great (if you like plantains), especially when dipped in the Caribbean salsa that they put there on the plate. The rice was a little too saffrony for me and I wasn't a big fan, but my fiancee loved it.

She ordered the Skillet Jerk Shrimp ($12), which was amazingly tasty! It was jam-packed with flavor, and came with a garlic-thyme butter sauce that I couldn't stop dipping the bread in (her dish came with a roll of bread). 

Altogether, this place will now be a mainstay on our trips into town, much like the Peppermill has become. The waiter was amazing and so was all of the food and the atmosphere. The prices, also, were very reasonable--especially considering what town we were in.",STPMW3_6Uk1CGCStvJkn4A,0,0,5,g67Cqg8cFKiMllCPIVoDwg

2502668,2011-07-27,8,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"I would like to formally thank Bahama Breeze and their staff for their sincere efforts towards RUINING my family reunion dinner on Saturday, July 23, 2011.  God Bless my mother and my aunts for their hard work in putting this thing on and for keeping everyone else patient while this disaster was taking place.  This was by far the worst6 display of service I have ever seen and several formal letters are being sent to their corporate office as I write this.  

My family had made arrangements with their business office to hold our reunion here for a buffet-style dinner.  We do not live in Las Vegas (none of us do) so we did everything via fax and phone.  We have been to this location on several occasions over the years, so we are familiar with the food and always had really good service here.  I also always enjoyed the food, so we thought this would be the perfect place to host our family reunion dinner.  Anyway, so the contract we made was for three main entrees (seafood paella, baby back ribs and Jamaican grilled chicken) , three side dishes (yellow rice, green beans, creamed sweet potatoes) and their signature green salad.  This was all to be served buffet-style with unlimited choice of soft drinks, tea/coffee and iced tea. The price negotiated was $35 per person.  We brought in our own cakes for dessert which they kept in the back refrigerated for us.  This was a group of approximately 31 people.  Kids' menu items were to be paid for separately as well as cocktails, beer and wine. Each table would get their own bill for those things separately (and for anything else you want on the regular menu).

From the beginning, service problems began.  There were two servers who primarily came in our area.  Over the course of the evening, we had to literally chase these people down for drinks and just basic service.  It was horrible.  I noticed that the buffet serving containers were quite small for the amount of people in party and they emptied very quickly.  Nobody was there to replace to food.  People sat with food while others had to wait a long time before being able to get food.  The salad bowl probably could serve about 6 to 8 people, so when that emptied (no other food was out or available at this point), people just sat their for a good 20 minutes before they brought out more.  This was the ongoing theme of the night.  Need a refill on that ice tea? Be prepare to never get it unless you run around trying to find the waiter to get some.  Nobody was attending to our party.  Nobody was busing the plates so we literally had pile them in the middle table.  Kids' orders were not brought out in a timely manner so the kids were eating like an hour into dinner service.  Remember the tea and coffee? None was offered to anyone and we paid for it!  And to top off , when the staff did make an appearance, they had really nasty attitudes about it.  No apologies.  So where was the manager in all this? Certainly not rolling up his sleeves trying to help his clearly overwhelmed waitstaff.  He was somewhere else, making excuses that there were other big parties going on.  NOT OUR PROBLEM.  

Look, this was clearly an understaffed event and the lack of attention to ANY sort of detail shows that, but come on! It was just blatantly bad.  Poor attitude and unapologetic staff is just a reflection of the management's nonchalance for literally pissing all over this party.  We had babies crying from hunger, we had piled up dirty plates, plenty of empty glasses and annoyed family members.  Thank goodness we are good spirited people, kept the party going and did our raffles and announcements and passed out cake as planned. We tried not to let our experience at Bahama Breeze ruin our getting to catch up with each other and have fun, but damn! Work with us here! We could have just gone to a buffet at one of the casinos for this and we probably should have.

 Oh and I haven't even gotten to how salty the food was!  The paella was nearly inedible even though they did not skimp on seafood, does it matter if they pour a whole container of salt in it?  Dry chicken, hard to cut with my knife.  However, the ribs were decent as were the green beans and sweet potatoes..but wait..something was missing.  Mom did not realize this until after but they forgot our yellow rice.  We have a few people in our party who are allergic to seafood so the paella was out, hence the reason for the yellow rice side.  I guess everything else was so bad we forgot about the missing side. Anyway, my mom called their business office and got it refunded.  Either way, I could think of sooo many other places to host a dinner like this that would have gone so much smoother.  They really should be ashamed for doing such a sloppy-ass job.",r34WTuxQ8H5I-eWR6bl3Tw,10,5,1,pZWTGQGcbtMl4YMk78LMzw

2619344,2014-10-06,5,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"We sent back 2 dishes and decided not to order anything else. My entire mouth was assaulted by salt. 

We tried the West Indies Chicken Curry rice bowl and it was so aggressively salted, we sent it back after 2 bites and then selected the Jerk Chicken Pasta. Unfortunately, that was also crazy salty; I couldn't get another bite in, my tastebuds and mouth were completely ruined and shriveled up.

The flavor profile of each dish was also shockingly basic - It didn't offer up any of the Caribbean flavors or seasonings that were promised. The Jamaican jerked chicken was dried out and I didn't even taste much jerk seasoning - only salt. To be fair, the dinner entree portions were gigantic. One dish is perfect for 3 people to share. 

Also, the appetizers were average. We tried the chicken empanadas and they were extremely doughy with minimal filling. The only dish that was decent was the fried coconut shrimp appetizer, however, I have to explicitly state that Elephant Bar and Yard-House makes it better. 

The manager came to talk to us at the end and was very defensive about the salt usage in both dishes. He also offended us by suggesting that we probably didn't know what jerk seasoning tasted like. lol. I'm not even going to argue it.

Happy Hour Specials are $3-$5 drink specials and half priced appetizers.  

Came in for Rumtoberfest and to check out some drink flights I had seen online.  Drink flights are my fave cause I love trying everything.  Started with the Higgla's Happy Juice a 3 cocktail flight.  It was OK so we decided to order The Rum Raid an 8 cocktail flight.  We didn't realize that it had 3 of the same flavors as our previous flight.  Most of the cocktails tasted very similar, surprisingly we only liked a few.  We finished off with a margarita flight and that was by far the best drinks of the night.  

For food we ordered Jamaican Chicken Wings, Key West Nachos, Coconut Shrimp, Firecracker Shrimp and Lobster & Shrimp Quesadilla.  Food was good.  Nothing amazing but a great price at half off.

There were plenty of appetizers and alcoholic beverages available. So for those of you who do happy hour with co workers, friends, significant others, on a date...etc..I think this would be a great place to go to whichever the occasion is.

For those who are always indecisive with decisions, Bahama Breeze's menu may be hard for you to choose just one thing to order. I was in between a couple dishes but in the end, I went for something healthy: a shrimp rice bowl with grilled/sauteed veggies. Portions were on point for lunch. It was just the right amount to fill me up without that ""ugh, I feel so fat and bloated"" feeling. However, I DO get full easily though so hmm... My boyfriend got the Caribbean jerk chicken pasta.

The Shrimp and Lobster Linguine with mushrooms in a cream and brandy sauce was mouth-wateringly delicious. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse on a brownie base covered with whipped cream, toasted almond slices, chocolate sauce and Creme Anglaise.  I'd go back just to have that again.

Whether you sit outside or on the patio, you will get the feel of the islands. Although the food is good, it can get a bit pricey for what it is. I had the Jamaican grilled chicken and it was $18. Tasty but $18 is a bit steep. My wife had a sandwhich for around $12.

The signature Mojito, ""Mojito Cubano""  was overly fufu.  They pack the drink with ice and make it like a slushy.  I asked for my second with significantly less ice and it still had too much.

We loved the Cheese Curds. They were crunchy, cheese oozed delicious. We ended up with two orders of that. The Jamaican Jerky Chicken was delicious, the portion was huge! Half a chicken grilled with special sauce and yellow rice with fried sweet plantains. The plantains were thick cut and fried to perfection. We Cubans loved it. The Seafood Paellas were not that great. The consistency wasn't really true Paella but the flavor was there. The seafood wasn't as fresh, mussels slightly overcooked, though fish was flaky and cooked well. Paellas weren't impressive, average, but portion was also very big! Each can easily feed two people. My sister-in-law's burger was good (you can't go wrong with burger they should all taste how they should taste). My BBQ ribs were ok, again, they tasted just like how should taste. Sweet and smokey. There wasn't any special twist or spin added onto it.

I'm a huge fan of their coconut shrimp tacos (choice of 2 or 3). The tacos come with a generous amount of coconut shrimp and an added spice is added with their house style pico. Last night I ordered this dish with a side of their beef tomato salad. The tomatoes were tossed in a vinaigrette and topped with fresh basil. Bold fresh flavors in every bite! My boyfriend always enjoys the Jamacian jerk chicken pasta. I've never tried it but it looks delicious (if you like jerk chicken). Bowtie pasta is tossed with asparagus, mushrooms and of course chicken. This is another dish you have the choice between large or small.
We came late and took advantage of their happy hour. We don't drink but they offer half off, full size appetizers. If you love quesadillas you have to try theirs! Cheesy, bold flavors and deliciousness!!
Our server last night was Fred. He was so nice and very attentive. Our drinks were never empty and our table was always manicured.

2921742,2015-01-17,5,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"I received a gift card for a Darden Restaurant for Christmas.  Choice of dining at Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse, Seasons 52, or Bahama Breeze.  I was recommended by some Las Vegas residents to try Bahama Breeze. 

Wednesday night on January 14, 2015 was the first time I visited Bahama Breeze to have a meal.  This night I had my cousin and her family from Henderson join me for the dinner.  I found out that they have not eaten at Bahama Breeze as well.  A first time dining experience for the entire family to enjoy.

A total of six individuals in our group (M1, M2, and M3 are the men.  F1, F2, and F3 are the females).  F1 (my cousin) ordered the garden salad and the ribs with fries.  F2 (me) ordered the Bahamian Seafood Chowder and Buttermilk Chicken Piccata with mashed potatoes.  M1 (cousin's companion) ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer as well as the coconut shrimp meal with broccoli.  M2 (companion's son) ordered a Portabello Burger with fries.  M3 (cousin's son) and F3 (companion's daughter) both ordered pasta.  One had asparagus and mushroom in the pasta while the other eliminated the asparagus.  Everyone finished their meal.  They all agreed that what they ordered for dinner was delicious.  Each dish was served with the right portion...just enough to make a person stuffed to the max. 

The restaurant itself is pretty big.  There's one section of the restaurant that can be used for reserved parties and it had a television for the customers to watch.  There was dinner music provided by a man playing the guitar and he sang a lot of cover songs.  He was located near the bar area and right behind the wishing pond.  The ceiling fans are actually the propellers from the boats.  The restrooms were very clean and there was a mouthwash dispenser for customers to use before or after a meal....that's one thing you hardly see in restaurant restrooms.  

Overall everyone enjoyed the first time dining experience here at Bahama Breeze.  Employees were friendly and the waiters made sure that the drinks were not empty. Facility was clean and very beautiful.  Another major plus about the restaurant is that Bahama Breeze passed the Nevada health inspection by receiving a grade A. For my cousin and her extended family it would be a once in every six months treat for date night or family outings since the entree items are pricey.",OO4O6q-jI8pnDEQt4WvRhw,7,9,5,bNDBs4nQwRVDUvYnlFywww

The salmon I ordered was delicious, they have taken off the island rice, don't like the new rice. 

Service was good as usual, the servers are always very knowledgeable about the menu and they did not charge me to make a weird substitution. 

The garlic mashed potatoes recipe has clearly changed and they were very....well...shiny? If that makes sense, it was clear to me that they were not handmade or fresh like the used to be, so sorry, you lost a star over my potatoes.

Overall, enjoyable, they have very good specialty drinks. Bill was about $55.00 dollars before tip for three people, with one specialty drink on the bill and no desserts.",N_mlUKdFuFN6Z6LiDWfTdw,2,0,4,s4dSYsn5cbpoB4IsojBQNw

I ordered their jerk chicken pasta instead which used to be my old favorite and it's still delicious. I told my family I probably won't be crazy about Bahama Breeze anymore since my favorite dish is no longer served. But..! my brother had ordered their Steak Oscar and I had a teeny bite and oh my! It was super yummy! There I was, sucked back in. Guess I will have to come back after I pop out this baby. Steak was topped off with crab meat in a creamy sauce and had such great flavors. Out of all our dishes that night, the steak was probably the best one ordered. My family really enjoyed their Long Island iced tea and I had their virgin pina colada which they are known for. My sister in law and I were also very impressed by their kids portion. We had ordered bow tie pasta for our kids and the portions were very generous for such a good reasonable price.

I love the atmosphere here it makes you so relaxed and they have the best selection of tropical vacation drinks, you know the kind with the little umbrellas haha. Our food came out lightning fast! Our appetizer was the Breeze Cheese Bites which are crisp fried yuca stuffed with melted cheese and cilantro crema dipping sauce. It was ok, to be honest it wasn't something I would order again because the ""melted cheese"" wasn't melted it was just a stick of cheese inside a fried yuca ball. For my entree I ordered the coconut shrimp tacos (2) and Deja recommended the fresh fruit with sorbet for my side which was amazing! The fish tacos were good but they were really spicy! I know it came with sriracha aioli but wow they were hotter than expected. The coconut shrimp had good flavor and the size was good too. The tortillas were cold and kind of hard.

Lots of parking and a really great environment with live music. We weren't in the main dining room, but we were in the room with the live music and beachy feel which was great. I enjoyed the atmosphere. 

Our server took a while to come by, she might have been on break or something. By the time she came, we had already looked over the menu and knew what we wanted to order. Our food came out quickly after we placed our order.

Lobster and shrimp quesadilla: unfortunately it was our least favorite dish. I didn't get to taste much lobster and I felt it was lacking some flavor or spice.

Coconut shrimp: their most popular appetizer but it wasn't crispy enough for me. It was pretty good but I was hoping for a stronger coconut flavor. My sister loved this dish. 

Seared ahi tuna: 5/5!!! I could eat an entire plate (or 2) but unfortunately I had to share. The ahi tuna tasted fresh and the salad went very well with it. The mango glaze wasn't over powering either. 

Habanero chicken wings: we probably should have ordered the Jamaican jerk wings. While the portion was really big, we did not enjoy the wings. It was spicy but the BBQ and habanero didn't mix very well IMO. 

I had been wanting a frozen bahamarita all day and it did not disappoint me. I'm pretty sensitive to alcohol and yes... I'm one of THOSE people who get super red after half a shot but I managed to finish my entire drink without getting tomato red. Drinks here seem to be watered down because I also tried my sisters classic margarita and it didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it! I loved it but she did not.

They didn't have a special GF menu which is not a big deal to me because typically the waiter will just fill me in or make his recommendations.  This waiter didn't know much about what foods or sauces had flour.  He didn't really have any enthusiasm to find out and come back and make some recommendations. So I had to McGyver my own meal which typically means I have to eliminate the sauces. I tip very well when waiters really know the foods and can make recommendations or atleast have the eagerness to find out for me. I don't typically eat out and this was going to be a real treat for me.

I ordered scallops in butter sauce and the scallops were burnt and then raw in the middle. When I sent them back, they replaced only the one I ate half of.  I asked for a dinner salad instead and they gave it to me with croutons.  He took it back and picked off the croutons as crumbles were still there. What part of ""I can't eat flour don't you understand?""  

I sent back the salad and refused to eat as I swore someone would have spit in my food by now.  And let me tell you, I'm a very passive person when it comes to any problems with my food.  So I wasn't mad or anything and I didn't give the waiter any attitude. By the way, the waiter never apologized for any inconvenience or was concerned.

There was a huge two parties going on and every staff member kept coming in and out the patio doors fussying over the parties and most people seated were ignored and were very openly upset about the service by stopping random staff members for drink refills and to check on their food.  I was with two other people who swore it tasted nice but I don't know if they were just being polite as literally ""utter chaos"" was going on around us and we waited 45 minutes for our table when we called in advance for a reservation.

I was treating my friends so I was shocked that I was given a ""$10.00 charge"" for food that was returned!  I hadn't eaten anything sat and drank myself silly over the ice tea and left more hungry than I came in.  There was absolutely no apology anywhere or from anyone and I couldn't believe the waiter was serious about this charge. So I didn't tip him.  Probably the first time in a really really long time that I haven't tipped a waiter.

We got the coconut shrimp for our appetizer. Good size shrimp with a delicious sauce. A hit of sweetness and a hint of mustard. I'm not fond of mustard but this was an awesome dipping sauce. Truly enhanced the shrimp. 

For dinner, I ordered the lobster/shrimp linguini. Decent amount of lobster but a crapload of shrimp! Every bite had shrimp and that was well worth the 20 dollars! The sauce had the right amount of creaminess to it which was a plus!

Service - very good, the redeemer of this place. 

Drinks - all of their signature cocktails were just sugar bombs with not of lot of depth. Cheap tasting stuff. 

Food - I got the coconut fried shrimp as a appetizer, and it was really tasty and well done. I ordered the fruit and chicken Caribbean salad and it was ok. The chicken was of the same quality you get in those giant frozen bags at Sams club, and it was just gross, it really felt like fake chicken, like they boiled it, idk. Don't order any of their chicken dishes. The salad was overdressed but was yummy at first. It's a very pretty dish. 

Someone at my table got key lime pie and really like it. 

The prices here are reasonable, if you don't expect above Chili's level cuisine. I will go here again and update this review after trying more of their ""signature"" dishes. 2 stars for now.",d5BpyRtd03vpxguCa8NmFg,1,1,2,CY9DyDk1nVruON6WQC1NQQ

Christine B. Gave a great fun evening- humor, promptness, very helpful explanations about the meals and drinks.
I had the mango caipirosca drink with vodka and mango, the sriracha fish tacos with tomato salad ( light meal so I can protect my dear spouse from anentire key lime pie slice) and he had a great shrimp rice bowl. Delicious!!! Big portions.
The pie was excellent and almost tart enough to be killer- with a perfect crust.
The service was individualized and professional.
You know if my tough reviewer husband wants to come back, this was seriously very good!!
I have my next assignment: stuffed plantain with crab on top!!
One tip for management: we were both stunned to see that waitresses must bus their own tables. Now the plates and bowls here are large and very heavy stoneware. This is wear and tear on your very important team. We are hopeful that our concerns reach the ears of big cheeses. Maybe an undercover boss is needed- I can see no CEO working anywhere near as hard as did the staff tonight.

Another favorite is the Jamaican Grilled Wings, they are slow roasted to get the skin crispy, but once you bite into them you will taste the tender chicken they pair them with spicy jerk sauce (which you will most likely want your own for dunking)

I had the Habanero wings and firecracker shrimp to start and both were delicious. Followed it with the Cuban Sandwich. The sandwich was good but tasted a bit bland for my taste.

My favorite meal is from here and it's a must try, the salmon tostada. The portion is huge, the salmon is perfectly cooked, and the dressing is to die for. Another favorite is the habanero wings, you get a ton of wings since it's an appetizer and the sauce is sweet and spicy. The cocktails are great here and the happy hour deals are wonderful!

Joanna was our server and she was lovely. I would definitely give her 4 our of 5 stars. We started with the Coconut shrimp (which is my man's favorite). It was good but I don't love it like he does. Something about fried coconut flakes just doesn't do it for me...to each his own. I ordered the lobster/shrimp quesadilla with a bowl of the seafood chowder. My quesadilla was fine but nothing to write home about...it could have used some hot sauce. The soup, however, was phenomenal. It was like a crab/shrimp chowder with little fried shrimp on top. It was creamy, smooth, not too salty and hearty enough. It was rich so I couldn't finish it all. My man was a fan and took the rest home for a late night snack.

With its tropical, breezy, just-sitting-out-on-the-veranda ambience, their specialty drinks are matched to boot. We usually indulge in these $4 perfectly garnished and charming cocktails. Ultimate Pina Colada, Bahamarita, Mojito Cubano, Pineapple Coconut Martini. (I've tried them all except the sangria and margarita on the rocks.) They're so pretty that you'll want to bust out your phone and be that person at the table. You know, *that* person.

If this doesn't suit your fancy, they also offer select beers for $2-$3, wines $2 off, and the standard mixed spirits for $3. 

Appetizers are half-off and are consistent with the quality of their drinks - flavorful, garnished appropriately, infused and influenced with its caribbean namesake. They offer a wide variety, so all mouths are sure to find something to pique their taste buds. The coconut shrimp seems to be a popular choice, but I recommend the beef empanadas, which is what I ordered on a recent visit.

We went at lunch time for the first time at any location hoping to get a variation on the menu. We were pleasantly surprised. We got the lobster quesadilla combo with a caesar salad.

Devin, was our server and he did a great job taking care of us. We started out of course with a margarita and it tasted pretty good, but they weren't consistent tasting each time. The promotion price was deducted from our bill with no problem and I was glad since the drinks were just so-so. 

Grilled Chicken and Tropical Fruit Salad ($12.49) -  Pineapple, red grapes, strawberries and mandarin oranges with goat cheese crumbles, candied almonds and drizzled with Island vinaigrette and grilled chicken. When it came to the chicken I was disappointed because it's described at grilled and the picture of it on the menu shows chicken with grill marks, but mine appeared to be seared instead of grilled and had no flavor at all. The chicken lacking flavor honestly left my mind once I tasted the greens, fruits and dressing underneath because there was a good amount of it and it all melded very well together. Good portion for the price and I'd order it again even if the chicken doesn't live up.

Rebecca's Key Lime Pie ($6.99) - Handmade with a brown sugar crust and golden meringue. I've had this dessert before and it tasted just as good this last visit. It's my favorite on the menu and tastes just right. Love that crust.  

Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside-Down Cake ($6.99) - Warm chocolate cake with a chocolate molten center topped with caramelized pineapple and served with raspberry sauce and fresh Island fruit. The first bite tasted a bit like burnt chocolate, but once I got towards the center it was chocolate heaven. 

Inside was clean and they have plenty of dining space as well an outdoor patio.

Something went astray this time.  I ordered my usual ( Cuban Black Bean Soup, and Jerk Chicken Wings), my wife ordered the Portabella Mushroom Burger.  When he explained it was a hamburger, with a mushroom on top, my wife requested just a ""burger"" made with the Portabella mushroom as the burger.  I guess the special request was just to complicated.  First she got a open faced bun with a mushroom and veggie mix on it.  She requested the same thing again, and this time it came out as she requested, at about the start of the second bite, a small black bug crawled out from under the lettuce and casually walked across the corner of her sandwitch.  We called the waiter, pointed out the intruder, and he promptly took it back.
He then asked us if we wanted any desert.  We didn't quite understand the question, so we said no.  He brought us our bill.  
We didn't understand.  My wife had had nothing to eat at this point.  We didn't ask for anything else we just thought he would replace her un-eaten sandwich. 
The manager did come over and apologize, and told us how sorry he was, but her sandwich was not replaced.  
As we were leaving, I told the hostess the story, she hailed the manager who apologized again, but didn't seem to understand when I explained that my wife was leaving your establishment Hungary.  People shouldn't leave a restaurant Hungary.

After waiting they tried to sit me in the large dining area where no one was sitting. I traveling for work and dining alone so I think they are trying to force me to eat at the bar. 

My first visit was mediocre. I ordered a beer which came to me in a bottle that a runner just dropped on the table and ran away. The beer was warm inside but the bottle was cold and the label was about ready to fall off. I guessed they tried to ice down  a room temperature beer. The waiter at least offered a glass for my beer.

I ordered the grilled chicken with cilantro cream. The chicken didn't have much taste since it seemed to be grilled then some bland glaze added on top. There was a bed of mash potatoes that was smothered in a  green 'cilantro' sauce which I liked but I'm a sucker for any thing smothered in gravy.

Service : Service was attentive and good . 

Food: we had a bunch of plates for two people. We started with the tostones which were great but very filling . We also tried the seafood chowder which was very good but very creamy . I had the shrimp and cheesy grist which were good and loaded with calories . We also added plantains and a side of beans . 

Drinks : drinks were amazing and one of the reason we will be back . We had the coconut mojito which was amazing and also a margarita which was pretty standard . 

Overall experience : The patio is a great place for a lunch and is enclosed to keep out the heat of the desert . We will definitely be back for a lunch in the future .",PemAGpIKTHpBVRaRkDwJKQ,0,0,4,KRrsYAeZTaKRHt_9NqlXyQ

The Habanero wings are good. The Key Lime pie is very authentic. However when we decided to go there for my wife's birthday we were extremely disappointed. I ordered Jerk Chicken. I ate about half of the chicken when I realized it was getting difficult to pull the meat from the bone. This generally means chicken is undercooked. When I showed our server he called over the manager who insisted she have it remade for us. I told her I didn't really want a remake. So I opted for it to go.

When I arrived, they were already seated and the Appetizers were coming out.  They ordered Coconut Shrimp (Crispy large Shrimp hand-breaded with sweet flaky Coconut & a Citrus-Mustard dipping Sauce) & Creole Baked Goat Cheese (In roasted Red Bell Peppers served with vine-ripened Tomato Salsa and Parmesan Toast).

The Coconut Shrimp was OK, not great.  They're large sized Shrimp.....the Coconut Breading was a bit sweet for my tastes.  The Creole Baked Goat Cheese was excellent!  If you try the Goat Cheese, you have to slice up the Bell Pepper and eat it....it was amazingly good.

For an entree, I ordered the Jerk Chicken Pasta (Jerk Chicken Breast, fresh Asparagus and Mushrooms tossed in a rich Parmesan-Herb Cream Sauce with Bow-Tie Pasta).  They weren't kidding when they said this dish was ""rich"".....I think I gained 5 lbs after eating this thing.....it was very good though.  Despite being rich, the Sauce didn't overwhelm the dish and it had a nice flavor.  The Jerk Chicken was cooked perfectly and was of good quality.....you could taste the flavor that Jerk Chicken is known for....I was left wanting more.  Thank God it wasn't bottomless, otherwise I'd have to buy new clothes afterwards....ha!

Overall, it was good service and good food.  This place is a solid 4 Stars.

I got the crispy onion rings, the lobster & shrimp quesadilla, and the Jamaican chicken wings. For a drink, I just stuck with the coconut water.

The crispy onion rings have a panko-coconut breading that's fried to a golden-brown. The coconut flavor is really subtle, but you can't go wrong with this classic appetizer.

The lobster & shrimp quesadilla was pretty amazing. Who would've ever thought that cheese and shellfish would be a perfect match? They came with pico de gallo and sour cream on the side, which go perfect with these little triangles of cheesy goodness. The lobster seemed a little sparing, but the shrimp was definitely there.

The Jamaican chicken wings had the perfect marinade to it. The jerk spices added a unique zing to the wings that blast your tastebuds with rich flavor! The spiciness factor isn't too hot. It won't burn your tongue, but it definitely has a noticeable kick. 

I'll be back to try their entrees, but their appetizers are really something special. Any place that has amazing deals for their happy hour is worth it to me!",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,9,9,4,ImZXye_fWLBgISVkGlbxjg

3970176,2016-12-21,5,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"I had a voucher for $25 for Darden Restaurants and from the choices available, I opted to try Bahama Breeze.

I arrived about 5:15 and was seated in a rather empty restaurant except for a private party in one room.  I was seated immediately and my server, Mike, came over and ask for drink order and let me know if I had any questions about the menu to ask.  He got my iced tea.

I ordered a cup of black bean soup and the coconut shrimp.  The bean soup was brought in a short time drizzled with a back and forth with a cilantro-crema.  The crema didn't really give the soup any flavor.  It seems it was more decorative than functional. 

The main course--coconut shrimp--was brought with the correct amount of break between appetizer and main.  The shrimp were good and it had been quite awhile since I had coconut shrimp which I like.  It was served broccoli and yellow rice.  The shrimp were good but I think it would be better as an appetizer than a main.  

For dessert, I got the chocolate island, a dessert the menu describes as ""rich chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie island in chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise.""  It was a very good dessert and the best part of the meal.

Mike's service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled without asking.

I ordered a jerk chicken pasta which was good and had the right amount of spice.  But the grease built up quick and could be toned down some.  I was able to try my friends chicken breast and I liked the mango salsa that came with it.  So far we have:

Appetizers:  Onion Rings (3/5).

4014428,2015-03-19,1,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"Haven't really been to Bahama Breeze in years....but thanks to a Red Lobster gift card (both restaurants belong to Darden), and a Valentine's date for some KISS Mini Golf (review on that later), we were hungry!

Got to say, restaurant is still not bad for a Caribbean-themed chain.  Place was hoppin'!  Very, very busy.  Folks must like their congo music, eh?  Breezy.  Luckily even with no reservations our wait time for a table was less than five minutes.  Like the place - open, airy, noisy, and boy do I love the smell of Jerk chicken on the grills.  I'm really hoping that it's cooked on an open charcoal flame, but I'm pretty sure it's probably not.  Can't have everything I suppose.

After getting seated and giving our drink order (Bahama Breeze using bottles of Republic of Tea - Ginger Peach is tasty but a tad pricy) we were ready to view the menu.  It really is a bit of a mix, some Jamaican, some Caribbean, some American.  Fortunately a lot of it sounded tasty.

Wifey couldn't decide so she settled on the Island Hopper ($19.99) - appetizer sampler platter of sorts that included their signature Jamaican chicken wings, crispy coconut shrimp, onion rings, and conch fritters.  It came with sauce sides of jerk BBQ sauce, citrus mustard, and a roasted pineapple chutney.  For the most part she enjoyed it.  The Jamaican chicken wings were a bit smaller than she remembered but they were still very tasty with a peppery kick.  Coconut shrimp were indeed crispy, but light, with good hints of sweet when dipped in the pineapple chutney.  Conch fritters were only OK, a bit forgetful because they tasted more of a hush puppy with very little conch inside.  And the onion rings, well they were just onion rings.

I ended up getting the Cuban Sandwich ($10.99) and while I did like it, I should have read the menu better.  Why does Bahama Breeze put lettuce & tomato in a Cuban sandwich??  And salami???  Very, very strange.  Just do it like the Cubans guys - marinated roasted pork, good ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard between buttered Cuban bread then smooshed in a plancha till golden brown.  Simple!  Thank you Jon Favreau of Iron Man and Chef fame!  I think I would have enjoyed this sandwich a lot more without the extra fluff, but did applaud the effort of Bahama Breeze trying to make the sandwich their own.  Next time I would just order it with no lettuce & tomato, or just put it on the side.

Overall a good experience at Bahama Breeze, the atmosphere was inviting, and the service was stellar without being pretentious.  The food could use some tweaking but that's par for the course.  If this place wasn't so far from where we live I would be likely to check out their menu further or at least come down for their hoppin' Happy Hour.

Only items that stood out were the seafood chowder and wings.  Burger was not very good, something about all the ingredients and manchego cheese just did not work well together.

Our experience tonight has truly made us never want to go to this business again. I suggest that anyone that reads this takes this information to heart. My friend had to use the bathroom and he has Parkinsons so he cannot use the bathroom on his own and needed my help. To put this as clean as possibly I was directing his stream in the bathroom when a worker walked in. He made some rude, sarcastic comment to us and walked out. I was shocked. I thought that this harassment would be over but when we returned to our tables the owner came to our table to talk to us. We did not want to scare our dates off so we just apologized but the owner accused us of peeing on the wall. He told us that it was a family friendly establishment and it wouldn't be tolerated. Now this is 2017. I don't understand why people still cannot accept someone for who they are. It has been scientifically proven that the hypothalamus lights up for certain interactions and that it lights up in a different way for one's sexual preference. They cannot change the way they are. The owner refused to believe our story and its sad that he harassed my friend due to his disability. If you have any respect for the people on this earth then please do not come to this business. They are extremely homophobic and provided a miserable experience. The food was not even that good and not worth the prices that they were.

4147053,2016-05-12,1,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"I like Bahama Breeze for something a little different.  It is part of the Darden family of restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Long Horn Steakhouse) but this is neither Italian, seafood or steak.  Sure, they have pasta, fish and beef but that is not what they're about. 

Bahama Breeze is about the feel of the Caribbean.  The place looks like a beach resort that one may find in, say, the Bahamas. There are palm trees, torches, fruity cocktails and an overall laid back atmosphere.  The menu is substantial and has something for just about anybody.  It is a restaurant/menu I have been enjoying for over 10 years.  

I started coming here with my office for a holiday party.  Then we came back for a retirement party.  And again for a going away party.  Maybe even two.  I've come in with family a couple of times now also.  Each time I stop in I try somthing different.  Coconut shrimp (amazing and unfortunately not an option for me any more), chicken skewers and rice (not on the menu any more), West Indies curry rice bowl, jerk chicken pasta, buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes.  I've tried the black bean soup.  I've tried a salad.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've had here.

I've had some of the drinks too.  A sample of the coconut mojito which was good but very sweet.  A taste of the watermelon jalepeno margarita.  A zombie (which I seem to remember liking very much).  I did have an off pint of Guiness once.  Not sure what happened to that keg but it wasn't good.  However, I've also had a Newcastle here and it was spot on.  

Service has always been consistent and pleasent.  Even coming in on Mother's Day with a 7:00 PM reservation went off without a hitch.  We were seated just before our scheduled time and were waited on equally quick.  Having taken the time to look at the drinks and food, we ordered and just got to talking.  Before we knew it we had all that we had ordered and the meal had begun.  We were out of there by 8:15.

4161917,2013-11-06,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"We were visiting Las Vegas for relaxation... Wanted to try different restaurants and some food and drinks we don't get often where we live. My husband loves coconut shrimp, so I looked up restaurants that served them. There was  Bahama Breeze and Kahunaville, (which is in T.I.) I made reservations with Kahunaville for later in the week,... (which we HATED)... but went to the early happy hour at Bahama Breeze.(they even have two happy hour times, early and late) Kahunaville, ended up being one HUGE MESS of noise, and the food was mediocre and expensive,( I reckon because it being on the strip). 
  But back to Bahama Breeze. The place was great! It is in a mall of restaurants and parking was a ...""breeze""...(get it?)... It had the atmosphere with the truly tropical feel of  shutters, lanais, wood,  bamboo, gardens, fire pits, open and airy. Man, even the men's restroom was great! 
  The happy hour menu was fantastic! $3.00 & $4.00 drinks, and 1/2 off appetizers! Our server was Sam, and she was great, fast and efficient.
We had the beef empanadas: nice and spicy, with a nice fruity salsa, the warm goat cheese dip with flatbread crisps: GREAT! The cheese comes in warm bell peppers. The coconut shrimp: you get 6 fairly large perfectly seasoned shrimp with a spicy mustard sauce... in fact my husband ordered two of them... The tropical drinks we ordered were far more superior and tasty than Kahunaville... and a lot less expensive! 
  Over all Bahama Breeze got our vote for BEST ""Island food and drink"" in Las Vegas.

We seat ourselves at the outside bar, there was an island band playing that night.  FYI: There's a live band every Friday...ok, so at the bar get the menu and see that they have a special for the night $5 Margaritas (Mango, Classic, Strawberry and 2 other flavors).  6 Margaritas and a chicken quesadilla later we were SAUCED and that's when the night got live.  The band was cool, it was a Caribbean themed band that week.  

This review is not about the food or the band, even though BOTH were great, this review is about the BARTENDER LUIS @ the outside.  Out of this world customer service, he was definitely in charge of his bar that night.  Not only assisting in making the drinks for the servers, he still maintained a great quality of service that he provided to us at the bar.  Very attentive to all, even took a moment to crack a joke or two with the folks at the bar.  I LOVE service like this, it makes me come back on the regular.  I will definitely be back soon, no need to wait for the hostess to seat, I walking straight to the outside bar to go hang with LUIS!

Go visit him, he's really cool.  I promise this is not personal review, I did not know Luis until last week.  Good thing I was looking for a great margarita because I found one and it was accompanied by an AWESOME person/bartender.",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,0,1,4,4Aw9d-RrItQ70vqjHSjdKw

4259532,2010-06-12,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"I love this restaurant- so much that I had my bachelorette party there. I love the atmosphere (the decor is tropical), the food is excellent, and the caribbean music (free entertainment) adds to the overall fun feel of this restaurant. It's easy to feel good in this type of restaurant. I've only been here for dinner, but about ten times. (Twice for an e-mail member event- that was fun!) The service is really good. The location (Paradise/Flamingo) is in ""Restaurant Row."" It's very easy to get there from the Strip, if you are just visiting. If you're coming for dinner, make a reservation, because this is a very popular restaurant. Outside seating is nice, if you can stand the heat during the summer months.  

My favorite appetizer is the Coconut Shrimp. It's now the best all around in Las Vegas, since Red Lobster's version has changed. I don't like a whole lot of breading- like how they do so often at chinese restaurants. It's definitely not the case here. Also, the size of the shrimp is pretty good.  

My favorite dish here is the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pasta. I am not usually a fan of creamy sauces, but I make the exception here. It is the perfect blend of bowtie pasta, jerk chicken (love that spice combination), mushrooms, and asparagus. It's the best thing on the menu. But that's my opinion. I've tried other things on the menu but I keep coming back to this dish. 

About the prices, it's a chain restaurant, so the prices are going to be slightly higher than some restaurants out there. Frankly, I didn't think that the Planet Hollywood restaurants are anything special, but they still remain popular today for some reason. I would rather go to Hard Rock Cafe, but now, my husband doesn't think those restaurants are anything special either.        

SInce I love this place, I am sure we will be back again.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,5,J2mlxce4APRYSKd_6NCTxA

But after getting over the fact there is really no authentic food here this place is pretty good. We had a party of around 30 and were seated privately in a covered patio section of restaurant. This place is huge, nice and spacious. Seemed like everyone really enjoyed their drinks, I had the Bahamarita and it was very good. Ok so menu items we tried were beef empanadas: their version is good and the sauces that came with were very good. Coconut shrimp: I have had better but it was good, the sauce to dip was the winner. BBQ ribs: very good like rib joint good, Seafood and jerk pasta I was told was excellent, plenty of shrimp and lobster. The portions here are pretty big too, most guests had to go bags. I found out after the fact from a local that the one authentic item they had was conch fritters, man one of my favorites so can't wait to try them.

First, our waiter was top notch. Friendly, engaging, knowledgeable, and even engaged us as we asked about how the local dining businesses were faring in the current economic state. He was actually a PT waiter at another restaurant, and he helped us pick our dishes.

The food was surprisingly tasty. I had the jerk chicken bowtie pasta, which was slightly spicy but in a good way.

Our server was fantastic - bright and bubbly, recommended a handful of items. It took us about 20+ minutes to get ready and order, yet she checked on us ever 5 minutes to answer questions.

I personally got the Jerk Chicken, with cinnamon sweet potatoes, green beans and a mango pineapple salsa. I didn't taste much of the jerk seasonings - but then again, the menu DID say ""mild"". The sweet potatoes very very sweet, but it balanced with the salsa and chicken.

I particularly liked my virgin ultimate pineapple drink -  essentially piña colada and strawberry ice in a freshly cut pineapple without the alcohol. It's so refreshing & satisfying! The Jamaican chicken was just okay and the portion was plentiful.  the waiter was friendly and everyone seemed to enjoy the atmosphere and conversations.

Another reason to dine here is that it's pretty close to the strip, has plenty of parking and easy to hail a cab or get rideshare to and fro.

Having been to a Yelp event at the one in Princeton, NJ, I was pretty familiar with the menu choices.  But I hadn't tried the tostones with chicken, which our waiter recommended.  And I wasn't disappointed.  The large, thick plaintain slices were covered with an impressive amount of chicken, cheese, and other goodies.  Think nachos on speed.

My husband, the non-seafood-eater, let me talk him into the Lobster and Shrimp quesadilla, which came with pico de gallo, sour cream and, I think, guacamole (though that may have been with the tostones.  One Bahamarita is all it takes for me!).

Service was great, the food was delicious, and paying half price was the best of all.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,7,5,8Gkozps15co0tUqNtLMxbQ

I feel like I'm on a mini vacation when I come in here. Maybe it's the Banana Strawberry Daiquiri that puts me in the mood. The sips I took were fantastic ! My husband didn't like his Sangria (they don't serve it with fruit in the glass) so he drank half of my Daiquiri. My sister in law who is the ""non drinker"" wanted to taste it so I let her. 

 I started with the Coconut Shrimp ($9.49) for an appetizer it is big enough to be the whole meal. I just love the Citrus Mustard sauce it is served with...it's addicting! My sister in law shared her Roasted Cuban Bread ($5.99) . It had sliced vine tomatoes, basil, and Parmesan cheese. It was good ...It think it would be nice to eat with a salad. 

My main entree was the Calypso Shrimp Linguine ($13.99 lighter portion). I'm glad I ordered the lighter version because it tasted okay but it was nothing to write home about. It tasted a bit bland to and I would not order it again. 

We ended the dinner by ordering two desserts to share with the table. We had the Chocolate Island which is a chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie swimming in milk chocolate and vanilla bean anglaise. This was my favorite of the two! The second dessert was Banana Nut Supreme it has sliced bananas and vanilla ice cream topped with butterscotch brandy sauce. It tasted okay but everyone at the table liked the Chocolate Island the best!

My companion had a jerk chicken sandwich and soup (can't remember what kind) he said was good. Lovely atmosphere (played island music) and nice wait staff.

Then we had the Jerk Chicken Pasta with a side Caesars salad and the Island Hopper appetizer as a meal. 
The pasta was loaded with asparagus and mushroom with some chicken all cooked well.  The light portion was huge, so no need for the regular portion.  
The side salad was fresh and tasty, but absolutely too big. 
The Hopper was tasty with great coconut shrimp, huge crispy jerk wings, big onion ring and conch fritters.  WAY too much food!!  Everything was good, but the 3 sauces on the platter can't hold a candle to the Shiracha mayo!

I ordered the habanero wings and a classic margarita. The wings did not seem to be habanero. More of spicy BBQ sauce rather than habanero. They were actually pretty good, but calling them habanero is very misleading. For the drinks, it appears the other reviewers are correct. They are either watered down, or have barely and alcohol in them at all. My classic margarita tasted like pure lime mix. I had to order a beer instead. Be cautious of that before ordering.

As for the food my boo and I ended up sharing the fire cracker shrimp and shrimp and lobster quesadilla. Both were very tasty and especially great for such a cheap price. My favorite though was the fire cracker shrimp, it essentially was fried shrimp with a siracha Mayo dipping sauce. I'm sure it's very unhealthy, but so so good.

4571182,2012-03-23,2,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"I have been here a few times and never was the biggest fan, but I will laud Bahama Breeze on my experience today: my friend Susan D. dropped her business card in while at lunch a few weeks ago and won a free happy hour party for 10 people (drinks we had to buy at happy hour prices, which is $3-$4) but it included all sorts of appetizers...and it was seemingly unlimited...for TWO HOURS!  Happy hour is 4-6 PM Monday through Friday, and there are lots of drinks but it looked like only 5 or so choices for apps.  Well, our bartender Melissa hooked it up with more than that and even though there were only 5 of us, she furnished a second round of our faves and almost ordered a third round...of FOOD...and we had to turn her down!

To drink I had the bahamarita, with strawberry, kiwi and mango slush and margarita on top with a side shot of cactus schnapps...interesting and almost like alcoholic jamba juice.  I tried a variety of apps (beef patties which were really empanadas with creole seasoning, coconut shrimp, spinach dip, chicken wings, and chicken sliders) and they also brought out cheeseburger sliders, chorizo sliders, and pulled pork sliders, none of which I tried.

My conclusion is this: 
1) a good deal for a free meal,
2) the empanadas, shrimp, and wings were good, the dip not so much, and
3) THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG: the chicken sliders tasted like MINI CHICK-FIL-A sandwiches!
I hardly ever eat fried food but I had 4 of these, 2 each round.  Hearty juicy fried white meat chicken, 2 pickle slices, and a tasty bun (that probably has less butter than CFA, a good thing!)

I might die tomorrow but I have to say that after being away from Chick-Fil-A for quite some time, Bahama Breeze solves that craving.  Now if only I can find good waffle fries ever since Caribbean Cooker went out of business.

Moral of this story: Go to Bahama Breeze between 4 and 6, order 1 happy hour priced chicken sliders app and 1 drink for $3 and you will thank me later.  and get Melissa as your bartender, she rocks!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,4,2,3,kXH4Wkunsfh-p99kgxbEZg

I literally lost my appetite after trying my dish, it was a rice bowl with mahi and shrimp. So NASTY! I recommend the chicken quesadilla instead, those are tasty. The environment was nice but out dated, I feel it is due for a remodel. When we sat down the dining room was very hot, I noticed many people outside on the patio but I prefer eating indoors.

4736914,2017-03-05,1,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"Bahama Breeze is conveniently located on the corner of Flamingo Road and Paradise Road. Keep it in mind that entrance is from Flamingo Road. There are plenty of parking at front of the restaurant.
The building  reminds me of the Caribbean Islands.
Love the posts with fire like effects, the huge beach chairs at the entrance, and the music.

Bahama Breeze is open for lunch and dinner, and it stays open late.
Love the Happy Hour specials, on week nights 4pm-6pm and 9pm till closing. They are offering 50% off appetizers and reduced price beverages!
You have to be lucky to get seated immediately!
This place is very popular with locals and tourists.
When you signed up for a waiting list, you have to provide your phone numbers and then they'll be text you when the table is available for you. Usually it doesn't take long. Host/hostess is always very polite. They are asking you if you were dining here before, remind you to watch where you step up or down ... the restaurant has lots of little stairs all around.
Waiters/waitresses are also very polite, very knowledgeable about their food and drinks.

I'm a kind of person who is always looking at the menu for minutes and then I always get the same items over and over again.
My favorite dinner is the Shrimp and Lobster linguine ... It's a huge portion! Never left dissatisfied or hungry! Perfectly cooked pasta with lots of yummy seafood and creamy sauce. I always ask for freshly grated Parmigiana cheese to add. It really enhances the flavor of the meal.
I also like to add an order of Caesars salad. If you add the salad to the entrée, it only costs $2.99.
My other favorite item is a Seafood Paella. Lots of shrimp and oysters and baked chicken on top of Spanish rice. This meal has lots of flavor! Also a huge portion.

My daughter ordered Lobster and shrimp quesadilla from HH menu. Very tasty appetizer, lots of shrimp and lobster pieces with spinach and cheese on flour tortillas. It is served with very mild salsa and sour cream.
The Coconut Shrimps from HH menu is our other favorite item. It is served with mango salsa, very yummy!

Their specialty cocktails are very well made, always garnished beautifully.
Sometimes I order the Original Cuban Mojito. The only problem I have with this when it is made with way to much ice. I have to ask for a ""less ice"" version of it. 
The Original Lemonade is very good here! It's non-alcoholic, but it's coming from the bar, so it takes forever to get it, sometimes!
Other drinks, like soft drinks or iced tea ... never had a problem to get refills. Service is always good, servers are very attentive.

The restaurant is very casual. Happy to return again and again!",vvxIVr_OR6sHBzGPG9dRXg,3,2,4,or3EU1ICcl1UXBfuYC5nRw

Let me first say that I'm from the Virgin Islands and know what good Conch is... that's when it's actually included in the food. After eating three fritters I decided to open he last two since I didn't taste anything but bread and vegetables.  They were devoid of Conch and it was only tons of filler breading and diced peppers.

4765211,2010-07-10,1,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"This place has a lot of nice atmosphere. It's kitschy without too much.

I informed the waiter about my allergies to certain weeds (shitlantro) and he recommended a dish for me. Now, I won't die if I get cilantro, but it's kind of unpleasant to my body and it tastes like soap. I got a few bites in and he came running to the table panicking about how the sauce turns out to have cilantro in it. He sent the manager over who recommended a new dish, didn't charge me for either, and then gave me another drink which was hella strong.

The fact that they showed so much concern even though I explained to them that it's not a fatal allergy unless I get a fair amount in me, shows me that they care about their clients. 

The replacement dish, the mahi-mahi in a cream mango sauce, was absolutely to die for. Especially with a strawberry mojito. (the mango one was pretty bad, but was accidentally brought to my table by an errant waitress and I just took it rather than my strawberry one)

Would I go back? Definitely. The food was good, the service was very pleasant, and they apologized profusely for their mistake, while making sure I was very well taken care of. I'd gladly recommend this to any of my friends.",mySDXsBhY3u0yI-G2oVDkA,2,1,4,XvJLMz8FYB7RAtj5ZtXxXA

I have been here several times and each time is not like the other. In a good way.  I absolutely love coming to Bahama Breeze!

My girls and I frequent this place. We planned a Secret Santa gift exchange and planned to come here. I called ahead of time to see if they can help us remain anonymous with our gifts. They allowed us to bring in our gifts and keep them at the front desk. When the time came, they wheeled all the gifts and handed them out to who they were supposed to go to. So awesome. They made our party fun. 

One lady who works there, I want to say her name is Denise, but I could be wrong. She is great! Every time we're there, she's there and comes to say hi, When we met her, we had found out our friend was moving overseas, so we were upset. Then when we came back for her going away, she was there too and stopped by. She even remembered the night we all had tears in out eyes. 

I love the food here! The firecracker shrimp and jerk shrimp are my favorite. I like my food with a little kick and these deliver. Firecracker shrimp comes with a really good dipping sauce, while the jerk shrimp comes with Cuban bread. Also love their drinks! I get the Frozen Bahamarita. I recently tried the specialty rum drink they had, and got a souvenir glass. 

For my birthday, I had planned on coming here for lunch after some activities. After telling my mom, she later told me that they were going to take me there for dinner! lol they know where to take me, that;s for sure. 

Some nights they have live music, but there are always different parties going on.I really enjoy coming here because the food is good, staff are friendly and I always have a great time coming here.",2MtL65B0hy5L41TFBRIdYg,1,2,5,RNahjjCTItax87hR0wHazA

The rice and beans were ok but overall I was disappointed with my selection. It also took a long time to get drinks from the bar...like our food came out quicker than drinks did (alcoholic beverages).

Pros: great ambiance. Clean restaurant, live music, and decent pricing. My husband got shrimp scampi and said it was really good. We had a Carmel cheesecake and that was yummy. Our waiter, Joe, was awesome!  Great personality and really treated us well. Wait time wasn't long at all maybe 5 minutes but we did go on a slow Wednesday.

We started off with the coconut shrimp, which was delicious (the dipping sauce is really good). We also had the chicken wings and they were flavorful and finger licking good:-)

The mojitos are by far the best mojitos that I have EVER had and I've had lots and lots of mojitos!!! They had just enough sugar and mint and they had a pretty good kick to them, not to mention they were only $4.00 (during HH). Did I mention they had a pretty good kick:-) They were so good, we went back the next day, just for the mojitos (and not during HH - they were $7.00 each). 

For our main entrees, we ordered buttermilk fried chicken breast..OMG this dish is delish!!!!It's a layered dish of mashed potatoes, chicken breast, topped with spinach onions and cheese, and then layered again with another chicken breast and potatoes. On the side, the dish also included corn and black beans drenched in a wonderful sauce.  It sounds like alot and it is, don't worry about that, get a to go box if you have to. This dish is awesome and a must to try. I would order it again in a heartbeat. 

The atmosphere is nice (tropical theme) and the waitstaff was friendly and accommodating.

Happy hour at this place is worth the money!!! But when its not happy hour, its still worth coming to no matter what. Let me recommend a few things on the menu:

Habanero Wings- OH MAN, I don't eat a lot of spicy food but this one is so delicious! It has a mix of a sour cream and pico de gallo dipping sauce. All I can say is all the flavors is like a party in your mouth! I was cleaning up the bone and I never do that lol! The blend is perfect! This is a MUST ORDER when coming here! 

Jerk Chicken- Love the seasoning on this. I know they marinade it overnight and put it in the frier to give it a lil crunch. Lemme tell you this, they know how to season this to perfection. Love the sauce to add too, its a touch of sweetness. The combination together is like heaven

Beef Empanadas- Great starter, ALWAYS good to order before the food is coming, they use the same sauce for the habanero wings. Still, the pairing is always perfect when it comes to their sauces and food.

Calypso Shrimp Linguine- All the flavors pop in this dish. My 3 yr old son who is a picky eater will share this with me. The portion size is enough to feed me, my 3 yr old and my 8 yr old. This is a popular dish at this place, I've ordered this numerous times coming here. 

Jerk Chicken Pasta- YUM!!! it may not look as appetizing when you see the plate but DANG this one is a must order also. My husband would order this when we would come here until he discovered the....

Chicken Breast with Cilantro Crema- you have to eat each bite with the chicken, mash potatoes and the sauce. You will be craving this.

For Dessert: Order the Banana But Bread Supreme- you will not be disappointed!!!!! 

Can't go wrong with this place, you will never leave disappointed. The ONLY thing I don't like is that every time we arrive, we are always greeted by a homeless person asking for some money. Seriously EVERY SINGLE visit. Other than that, I have no complaints!",fedAekHhSixCtv_2NKE1bQ,0,0,5,5NvuVBOt4gYtlQE__bRJUw

When we arrived tables were not set up, we had to set up ourselves. It took thirty minutes before our orders were taken, then it took another hour and a half to get out food. Keep in mind we were prepaid and had three items from the menu to choose from, burger, tacos, or pasta (not complicated dishes). The food tasted good, however some were cold by the time we got it. Also 6 people did not receive their food until 30 minutes after most of the party received their food. And in the end two people never received any food at all. 

Over all it was a terrible experience, if you are traveling in a large group DO NOT go to this restaurant. I don't know how it is when you are with two or three people verse 60, but clearly the restaurant can not handle large parties, and should have NEVER accepted us as such a large party.",naIri3sawHNvekftRyrasg,0,0,1,i_zPv1fvRBCM45Mawcayfw

Located off the strip near the Hard Rock Hotel, Bahama Breeze was a delightful place from beginning to end.

Our server was friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Seafood Paella without the sausage, which our server said could be done.  One of the chefs came out a few moments later and said that the paella was made with the sausage in it and that they would be picking it out, which was fine with me so long as there wasn't any sausage actually on my plate.  I really appreciate this gesture because I know that not a lot of vegetarians would be cool with that.  When it came, I devoured it, which wasn't easy because it was a big plate of food.

My wife had the Fresh Pan-Seared Salmon Pasta, which was also amazing!

We had a couple of their specialty mixed drinks, which are not on the on-line menu so I don't recall the names.  But they were also very tasty.

Seems to me like most of the good food in Vegas is off the strip, and this would be a perfect example.

It came out VERY thing and served with some sliced veggies and some crispy pita bread sorta thing.  The side items were very good, and I did actually like the hummus but it needed more carribean kick in the flavor and not be so thin and bland.

I tried their new Shrimp and 4 cheese grits.  The dish was made perfect and so were the grits but again everything was bland. It needs more kick in the flavor dept.  

The pineapple upside down chocolate cake was soooooooooo yummmy though.  Their seafood chowder is always good, and I've had their black beans and fish tacos many times and it is definitely yummmy.  

I will definitely keep coming back to this place again.  I just prefer more spice/flavor in my dishes. (spice doesn't mean spicy, just fyi)",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,0,0,4,0Vg1hHjuDrXMBwAtCoVKpw

5096515,2012-05-14,0,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"TERRIBLE, AWFUL experience at Bahama Breeze the other day.

We were seated right away for an early lunch.  The first thing I noticed was that the TVs were playing reruns of South Park.  Now, I'm no prude, but there were lots of children around and the sound was on.  I don't know that I would take too kindly to someone playing that kind of show during a lunch with my children.  No one complained, but it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  A small thing, but a little disturbing and not typical of what I've seen at Bahama Breeze.

Our server came and took our order, which consisted of ham and cheese croquettes for an appetizer, soup and salad for me, and the chef's special for my fiancé.  Our food came out quickly, but sans appetizer.  I asked the person who brought our food where the appetizers were and she went to investigate.  I had to endure listening to loud arguments in the kitchen until, finally, they figured out that the waitress never rang up our appetizer.  Never mind that the operating system computer was literally two feet from our table... somehow she forgot.  No biggie... it happens... except that she was NOT apologetic at all.  She came over and said, and I quote, ""I forgot to put in your appetizer order.  So do you still want them or not?""  She said it like it was MY fault that it happened.  I didn't wanna pay for an appetizer to be eaten AFTER my meal.  Kinda defeats the purpose, ya know?  t declined and settled upon eating my soup and salad.

I have had the chicken tortilla soup before and usually LOVE it.  However, this time it was barely lukewarm.  Furthermore, the vegetables were so crunchy that I felt like a cow chewing cud with each bite.  I get that some soups have firmer vegetables, but this was a whole different type of crunchy.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found (presumably hiding from us after the appetizer incident), so we asked another server to send it back.  The server informed our waitress about what happened, and they proceeded to LOUDLY discuss how I was just trying to be fussy and that the soup WASN'T cold enough to send back RIGHT BY OUR TABLE.  I'm the customer.  Isn't that up to my discretion?  The soup was room temperature.  To me, that's cold.  And I have to pay, so I expect hot soup.  Period.  I couldn't believe that it was up for discussion, especially within my earshot.

The manager came over and brought us a free order of croquettes and fruit salad and asked us about the incident.  When I explained about the soup, the manager proceeded to defend the temperature of the soup, the crunchiness of the vegetables, and the behavior of the waitress.  Really??!?!  Oh, so you gave us all this free food to make up for something that apparently wasn't done incorrectly?  The attitude was basically that they were gonna try to satisfy me, but that they really shouldn't because I'm the picky bitch who sent back soup I should have choked down.  Unacceptable service.  

We paid our bill and left no tip - when I hear a waitress gripe about me to her coworkers, she doesn't deserve a tip.  Yet, it was interesting to watch her rush to our table the second we signed the receipt and stood up.  Heh.  Dream on, crazy waitress.

Summer is reggae time. I wish we knew this Saturday night. They have a 5 piece Jamaican band Saturdays, but we missed it. There was a live musician though, who was fun and friendly. Loved the music and the atmosphere at this place.

However, I sometimes take chances when there is something I have a craving for. One recent night, I went to Bahama Breeze (http://www.bahamabreeze.com) because I wanted their West Indies Patties. The friend I was dining with can't eat spicy food so she asked our waiter Jay for a sample of their jerk sauce  but Jay didn't know  how spicy the sauce was so he went and got a sample for her and the chef Dan Strohecker came with him. Since the chef was at the table I figured I would ask if they use the same oil to cook everything. Dan said he couldn't guarantee that they didn't but especially when a rush comes on. He graciously offered to cook the patties in new oil for me in a skillet. I was floored because that has NEVER happened in any restaurant I have ever eaten at. He said they will do anything within reason to ensure their guest enjoy themselves and any allergy issues are addressed.  I thanked him and he went and got started on my patties. Jay brought them to the table and a short time later Dan came back and asked me how they were and he looked down and laughed cuz the plate was empty. He said there's my answer! He said he had never cooked them that way before and didn't know if they would turn out light and crunchy like they do when fried in the deep fryer. I told him not only were they light but the crunch was unbelieveable. Not too hard and not to soft. Just perfect! I thanked him again and told him I would tell all my friends and blog about it. Bahama Breeze is one of the more successful restaurants in Las Vegas and now I know why! The food is exceptional but the service and attention to customers is phenomenal! Beyond anything I have ever experienced before. They are better than 5 star in my book. When you are there, tell Dan what a wonderful chef he is and request Jay as your waiter.

See, I've been to this Bahama Breeze a couple times before, because I discovered it's a place I can get a bowl of some really yummy chicken tortilla soup, complete with freshly sliced cubes of avocado. And, it's certainly nice to dine in a restaurant void of video poker machines and giant flat screens displaying every single game you can bet on. The decor's nice -- they certainly did an excellent job of creating the outside indoors. The service, plain and simple, is just nothing to write home about. Or write about at all. Last night, I met up with a group of friends there for dinner, and they seated us on the patio. Why the patio was even open, I have no idea. Even with the heater towers, we were freezing. The hostess relocated us, and it took quite a while for our orders to be taken, and took days for our food to arrive, without so much as an explanation or apology. In fact, our server completely disappeared after our orders were taken. A food runner delivered our plates. I did notice, however, that the complaining stopped once we did receive our meals. The food certainly is pretty darn tasty, and the presentation impressive.

With the name, I was quick to be like EGH...boy was I wrong. This just proves the saying, ""Don't knock it, till you try it"". For appetizers, we ordered the Coconut Shrimp and Tostones with Chicken. OMG, both were absolutely perfect, especially the Coconut Shrimp. Its considered one of their house specialties. As for my main order, I had the Chicken Santiago. YUMMY !!!!!!!!! The red roasted pepper sauce sealed the deal. I know this place is a bit off the strip but Yelpers if ever your in Vegas and need a break from the endless buffets, stop by this place, if you lost or possibly won in Vegas, at least you could go home full and satisfied.",7Rsk6V8_cdiOJM_gDQzlPg,0,1,5,xmMWLgY35u67Xwp-kqWH8A

I got it wood grilled with lemon/garlic/butter mix and it wasn't so good.. the fish was kinda dry.. but when we got it the next day (pan seared w/ sauteed shrimps) the fish was drenched in a yummy cream sauce with lotsa shrimps.. it was good :]

- 'Chef's Special' tiger shrimps w/ shitake mushroom orzo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg?select=tgrjzomA-ejaO7jLXzZMXw - huge shrimps, good sauce, and I loved the orzo x]

Service was top notch! 
Best service ever. 
The guy we had the first day was really nice but I forgot his name.. and Vicki was extra friendly. 
I really really really LOVED the service here!!

Price isn't bad either..

with 2 appetizers, 4 drinks, and 4 entrees.. :]

Oh, and I almost forgot!

This place reminds me more of San Diego and not the Bahamas. Service here isn't consistent. Good servers, bad servers and the in-betweens. The food is quite average. I've had great meals when I went to Bahamas so I'd always hope they'd remind me of my trip. They have conch fritters but it's disappointing. I must say their drinks are pretty solid though. Here's some that I've tried: 

Yaka Hula Hickey Dula:
Riesling, pineapple juice and dark rum. I like pineapple/pineapple juice, I like Riesling, rum is ok. Nice fruity but strong drink. 5/5

Ultimate Pina Colada:
Captain Morgan rum, strawberry and pineapple ice and dark rum. It's like drinking a smoothie - not much alcohol here. 4/5

Crispy Onion Rings:
Large onions rings breaded with Panko and coconut flakes. The sauce is a sweet mustard...I'm not a fan. 2/5

Coconut Shrimp:
Shrimps breaded with coconut flakes, citrus-mustard sauce on the side. This is supposed to be a best-seller. I'm still not a fan. 2/5

Beef Empanadas:
Fried dough filled with beef and potatoes.  Comes with mango salsa and a dipping sauce. Forgettable. 2/5

Tostones with Chicken:
Fried plantains with sweet peppers, mushrooms, chicken, cheese and tomato salsa. Biggest mistake and probably the worst item on the menu. I love tostones and this was a major let down. There's so much going on with this dish. 1/5

Shrimp Creole Bowl, Chicken Curry:
Nothing to write home about. 2/5

Chicken Tortilla Soup:
Chicken breast, tortilla strips, carrots, roasted corn, avocado and lime. This is my go-to menu item when I don't feel like wasting my calories. 4/5

Big Island:
Chocolate mousse, brownie, milk chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise. Chocolate mousse and vanilla anglaise are yummy...the brownie, not so much. 4/5

Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside Down Cake:
Warm chocolate cake with a pineapple ring on top and a molten chocolate center, raspberry sauce and fruits on the side. I love pineapple, I love chocolate but I do not love this dessert. If there's rum in this cake, it would've been delicious. 3/5

I've come here and have tried a lot of things on their menu but I just couldn't find anything that's good. I only come here for the liquid diet: soup and alcohol...and maybe the Big Island too. I'm just not in love with this place at all.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,2,1,3,fuYfycO5QjClNZ9fkCFdYw

They have an awesome menu as well that has something for just about everyone. My girlfriend never orders anything but the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pasta, which comes in a huge portion that can be shared or taken home for a second meal. I myself love the Steak Oscar, which is an 8 oz sirloin topped with buttery crab meat. How can you beat that?!

I also highly recommend any of their lemonades they're so fresh and good. Other people in my group have tried the jerk chicken sandwich and said it was great as well and also the chicken with the cilantro crema it comes with mashed potatoes and corn and that's very good too. I haven't had anything bad from here yet! However the service isn't the best. No matter when we go it's always very slow. We find ourselves constantly asking and waiting for refills.

I have been here a handful of times before and have always enjoyed it. I really love their late night happy hour, although we could not take advantage of that last night because it was a Saturday, oh well. Without a doubt my absolute favorite thing about this place is that every single item from drinks to food to dessert has the CALORIE COUNT on the menu! This is super helpful for me since I log all of my calories daily. I chose the Painkiller cocktail which was delicious, for dinner I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich on a brioche bun for only 400 calories, and I added avocado which was a generous portion and perfectly ripe. My choice of side was the Vine Ripened Tomato Salad which came in a balsamic dressing and was very good as well. I also ordered a glass of Cabernet and it was great. My friends had the Shrimp and Grits which looked incredible, and a steak with mashed potatoes which was perfectly cooked, and a nice looking Caeser Salad and Clam Chowder.

We finally got our drinks and we placed our app order, we got the spinach dip and chips, spinach  with artichokes in a creamy cheese dip was good! We also got a nacho made with plantans, this was good and a bowl of seafood chowder, also good. 

About here, I decided I wanted one of their specialty drinks so I picked out the blue hawaiian or something like that but after 25 minutes we had to ask for it again and when it came, tall skinny glass, I think maybe four sips and it was gone!

The restaurant is large enough to accommodate our larger party if our family decides to go there last minute without reservation. Overall, the food is OK, nothing really has ever been mind blowing and nothing has ever been a fail. We like to come here because the restaurant is spacious with a laid back island feel and atmosphere. Service has never been an issue either and we have sat in all areas including the main dining area, the bar area, and in the indoor patio area.

The firecracker shrimp street tacos, the Jamaican chicken wings, and the ahi tuna stack are pretty decent starters. The whole wing is served as the appetizer so be ready to share. For entrees, the paella and the steak oscar have been satisfactory. But the last few visits I have ordered something from the fresh fish menu.

Our last visit was on a Saturday night and we sat in the indoor patio area. They had a gentleman playing live music for our entire stay. The music did not drown out our conversation, but you should request another seat if you would like a more peaceful environment. 

For drinks, we had the Yaka Hula Hickey Dula and the Painkiller. Both cocktails were strong but nice mixes with kick from the rum. They were too strong for my wife, so that meant two dinner cocktails for me. I had the sauteed tilapia with chimichurri sauce as my entree. My wife had a turkey burger. My fish was cooked perfectly, moist and flaky with the chimichurri being a nice accompaniment. For dessert, the chocolate pineapple upside down cake was enjoyed by both of us.

I don't understand why their tables are so high. I mean I'm 5'3"" I get it--I'm not tall but when I sit in their booth the table is like at my chin.  I can't even imagine what little kids have to deal with. I almost asked for a booster chair if I would've thought my butt would've fit in it [should've tried anyhow]. Strike 1

When we originally sat down it kinda smelled like cat pee, so we asked for another booth by the window-it was THAT bad, that one smelt much better; however, I was still chin deep in table.  Not the most comfortable way to eat lunch. Strike 2

I asked if they had a calorie menu so that I could at least try to eat healthy, they did not. Strike 3 next batter.

Our waiter was a little behind so another guy came over to take our drink orders. By the time he was done our waiter came over and took our order but basically asked all the same questions twice. So that was kind of annoying but we made it happen.

What saved this place today [otherwise the stars would be much lower] was the food. I got the chicken tortilla soup [no tortilla strips-extra limes] and the fish tacos, ancho cream sauce on the side.  Both were delicious and actually pretty healthy [soup is like 300 calories 12 grams of fat, tacos 550 calories not sure how but 26 grams of fat? according to their website] minus the sodium which is super high in both.  I think next time I'll go with the plain old grilled fish.  My meal with drink was under $13.

We ordered the jerk chicken, coconut shrimp, seafood paella and warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake for dessert. The coconut shrimp was ""yummilicious"" (Maggie C I'm stealing your  adjective). Just the right amount of crunchy batter on the outside and plump and juicy shrimp inside. The jerk chicken was ok, I was expecting a little more heat, but then again that's just me and my taste buds. The seafood paella was the bomb. Not as good as my grandma's but close enough so that really says a lot. Of course I had to leave room for dessert. Warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake. Need I say more? It's got three of my most favorite food in the world: chocolate, pineapple and caramel syrup. Yes warm and uber moist chocolate cake topped with juicy, tangy pineapple slice on a bed of gloriously rich and gooey caramel syrup. Love it!

5520590,2012-04-23,1,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"Not a huge fan of this place.  I wasn't really hungry when we came here, but I was really looking forward to a nice selection of tropical drinks.  The selection was definitely there.  They had well over a dozen drinks.  A whole page in the menu, and a             booklet on the table.  Unfortunately, the two that I tried were pretty bad.  The first was a zombie.  This drink didn't look, or taste like any zombie I've ever had, and I've had a few.  I actually wondered if my order got mixed up somewhere.  Whatever it was, it was mediocre at best.  I thought a strawberry mojito would be a safer bet, since that's almost impossible to mess up.  Well...almost, right?  It looked, and tasted more like a bad daiquiri.  It was way too sweet, and apparently made with Pucker.  The only mojito thing about it was the physical presence of mint in the glass.  I tried a friend's cocktail- The Painkiller, and wasn't too into that either.  The mix of rum, and coconut cream is nice, but again, way too sweet.
The food was...okay.  Our friend ordered the jerk chicken, and seemed to really enjoy it.  We wanted to order some fish.  Three varieties were available, but they were out of the one that we wanted.  The salmon was cooked well, but the sides were not.  Gummy mashed potatoes, and oily under cooked green beans.  Oh well, at least they weren't frozen.

Tasty but I could never justify paying $16 for it.  My wife got the chicken santiago which was a lot better than mine and probably what I would get if I did do dinner here again.  Its also great that they offer lighter portions so we didn't have to bring anything home in a box as usual.

I don' know if it's me or what but after not having gone there for quite awhile, I went a got the absolute worst waiter that I have had in a long time! First, I ordered an ice tea to drink Now I wear glasses, but, if I can see through a glass of ice tea, I know that it's not too strong, So after some wait, he brought me a Coke! Then after several return trips to see if we were ready to order, we did, so he could  go make someone else's life uncomfortable. He brought my companion's soup and when I asked where the appetizer was, he informed me that she ordered the soup ? No kidding AND I ordered an appetizer, but I guess that it doesn't come first at BB? Eventually, the appetized AND the entrees were delivered together? OK, make do! A manager (?) came over and asked if everything was OK, of course I like being served all 3 courses at the same time, it saves the waiter a trip. The waiter went into seclusion to pout and I had to walk up front to the bar to get a refill of the Coke. The waiter came to the table to ask if I needed a straw, NO I needed a refill! The food was good, as I remembered it being there, we ended up getting to go boxes. I did want to try a desert but, honestly, was afraid to take a chance with this guy!

5608478,2008-08-29,1,DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg,"I wanted to find a location for the ""meet & greet"" on the first night of our destination wedding weekend, and I was totally disheartened by the pricing of any and all on-Strip locations. While driving around, the BFF and I happened to see Bahama Breeze. I know, I know, it's a chain -- but it has a fun, vacation-y appeal, so we called from the car to ask about group events.

Options from the low $20s per person? Cash bar available? Sign us up! We swung in for lunch to try as many menu items as we possibly could. The tostones and coconut shrimp both made for very tasty appetizers, although the tostones were a little dry -- but once you add all the cheese and toppings, yuuuuuum-ola. We both agreed our entrees were good, although now I can't remember what Jess got (some sort of chicken sandwich?). I tried the tilapia and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was, and it came with cinnamon sweet potatoes! We even had dessert, fantastic dulce de leche cheesecake (with an excellent graham cracker crust).

I will readily admit that I would probably only normally give BB more like 3 stars; however, this location was so upbeat and fun, the staff members were all so friendly and helpful, the drinks were so cheap... that I'm bumping it up. AND, it looks like it will be the perfect place to host a meet & greet, so if you're looking for a group event place, I'd definitely consider it!

They even have a small water feature running the length of the Restaraunt. The staff are all polite and I have never had a bad experience here. In addition, the staff will do anything to make your visit enjoyable (including singing and dancing for my crying 3 year old). 

The drinks here are reasonably priced for the size - they are quite large! And not to mention mixed very well. They taste like kool-aid and, according to my husband, are quite dangerous on the intoxication meter as you can drink and drink as of there were no alcohol - until you stand up from your seat. 

Food: I personally love the jerk chicken pasta. The asparagus and mushrooms work very well with the spices of the chicken and the pasta sauce. The husband loves the chicken salad, and the burgers here are also very good. The portions are large, so a single entree is enough to share between 2 adults, which is nice.

I gave him the benefit of the doubt on that because I just assumed he was new and maybe didn't know. 

I orders the tortilla soup and lobster quesadilla. I've had it before and it has never failed. When I got my food, a ton of the soup was spilled out onto the plate that had the quesadilla so my food was all wet and soggy. I posted a picture of it.

My friend ordered conch fritters for an appetizer, a salad, and lobster tacos. I went for a salmon cooked my way, wood flame grilled and almond coated with a lemon butter sauce, side of mashed sweet potatoes, and green beans.

Food was just ok in my opinion. Portions were good. I wasn't overly impressed with the salmon because they put a lot of almond and other stuff on it, which took away from the flavor of the lemon butter sauce and the meat. The conch fritters were good, but a little greasy...never had them before so maybe that's the way they are supposed to be, but I was expecting something a little lighter.

I'd love to hang out at the bar sometime and enjoy some tropical cocktails. I don't think they ever seem to get very busy.

Tropical drinks & delicious food. As you walk in, you feel like you're on an island. Came here for happy hour with a girlfriend and it was both our first time here. We were seated outside, which by the way, wasn't really outside, just another room in the restaurant that had an outside vibe to it. 

We ordered lots of different appetizers and drinks since it was 50% off. We had the Jamaican wings, crab stack, seared ahi and firecracker shrimp. The Jamaican wings were so crispy and juicy. It was accommodated by a bbq sauce (5/5). The seared ahi was ok. It lacked a little flavor (2/5). The firecracker shrimp was the same. It was just a fried shrimp with a spicy mayo dipping sauce (3/5). But the crab stack was heaven!!!! It was mango and avocados with crab meat and shrimp with a sweet savory sauce. My mouth is drooling just thinking about it right now!!! (5/5) it is definitely a must try!! They use REAL crab meat. YUMMMMM

Habanero Chicken Wings - My husband and the kids loved them!
Grilled Jamaican Jerk Chicken - A lightly grilled chicken with a light marinade-lacked flavor

When I want to treat myself or have guests come in to town this is the place that I take them 

I found this jewel many years ago and actually had thought about it over the years but could never find it again, after being here a week or two I happened upon it by mistake 
A fortuitous drive by 
Yay 

Now they are always BUSY and it's first come first serve so the wait can be very long 
If there's a bar stool empty, we opt for that as there is no wait 
Now service at the bar is extremely slow but again, this establishment is extremely busy so I get it 
In my opinion the food is worth the wait 

I always get the same thing, lobster and shrimp pasta 
NEVER disappoints 
I'm a garlic addict so I ask the chef for extra every time, it's perfect 

Was there last week and first time I've ever gotten a table !! Lol 
The waiter was very good, I had friends in town from France and he made them feel very welcomed 
Serving them first which I thought was just EXTRA !! ;) 

I will be back, and when I get visitors in town, even though this is 18 miles away (in Vegas there's a bazillion restaurants) this is the one we head to. And all my friends love it as much as I do 

Nice Ambiance, my only suggestion is to train their staff better 
When you check in at the door each time the staff of 3 that are there look overwhelmed and confused.... 
pretty much every time I go there however, they also informed me there's usually a 2 hour wait for a table, so I guess you can't blame them for feeling overwhelmed 

Cocktails and are very good, and in comparison to other establishments here in Vegas near the strip, these prices are very reasonable",OfHzlooMIbq-1BS8ekX8og,0,0,5,LzrIuVKzYVjPYuHX8pbHTQ

I would normally never go here (or a place like this in Las Vegas) on my own but 'had to' because of a group of business folks I was with. They had live music but it was very drab. Happy hour had decent prices but the food was very underwhelming. Service was pretty horrible so we are assuming the girl was new or trained horribly.

I had to agree that the food was really good.

I ordered the Chicken Club Salad.  Fantastic and DELICIOUS!!!  Right amount of salad, bacon, cheese, dressing and chunks of crispy chicken!!!  Yum yum in the tum tum!!

For dessert, I had a slice of Dulce De Leche Cheesecake.  It was too good.  I could not finish it because I was full and it was very sweet.  This is saying a lot because I ALWAYS eat all of my cheesecake (I'll be working out a lot tomorrow morning in the hotel gym!!!!!).

Our server was friendly, polite and always checking up on us to see if we needed anything else.

Next time I'm in LV, I'll try the clam chowder.  I hear it's very good.

Reluctantly she said the wait was fourty minutes. A few minutes later another member of my party showed up. After I said the weight was 40 minutes, she went to go ask again to double check. When she came back she said the hostess rolled her eyes and was sassy when she said the wait was still 40 minutes. They seated us in 40 minutes, I didn't mind the wait because we did have a big party but I thought the service was bad.
I've been here several times before and I love the ropa vieja sandwich and any of their flavored lemonades. I ordered the ropa vieja sandwich again. It came out in a reasonable time, but it tasted awful. The bread tasted like it was old or like the sandwich was microwaved. Normally the meat is tender but this time it was tough and it almost hurt my jaw to chew it, and certain parts of the sandwich were cold. My raspberry lemon breeze tasted like it was powdery and way too sweet. Our waitress was nice but she didn't come back until it was time for dessert. We ordered a key lime pie. If you like eating straight up sugar, you'll love this dessert. The crust tastes like hardened brown sugar, it melts in your mouth. Which I would like, but it was way too sweet. 
Needless to say, I'm not sure I will come back to Bahama Breeze. Or at least not with a group or when it's busy. But I'm not sure if I want to pay for rude service and bad food with decent dessert and drinks.",hPv5xh4cETVINMduWfLFVQ,1,0,2,fG3do66i1yQEKYh2WTLtag

I had a bite of my husband's Calypso Shrimp Linguine and the shrimp was very tender and there was just the right amount of sauce! He also had a Barbados Rum Punch and said it almost tasted like the ones we had in Barbados! It was actually made with the same rum!

I've tried several dishes here over the years and some are hit or miss. The portabello mushroom sandwich lacked flavor and texture and it wasn't as hearty as I was hoping for. I tried a pasta dish on my last visit which I actually quite enjoyed, however.

Overall, what I really like about the restaurant is that it's a great place for groups. There are lots of spaces to socialize and and private places.
