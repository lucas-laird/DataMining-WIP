They gave me samples of everything before I bought a single product.  I ended up with a bag of everything they had.  The jerky has the right texture and they are using the right quality and cut.   These two ladies listened to me ideas of improvement, this place is aces.   Your missing out if your a beef jerky fan if you don't stop in.",9B4aLXFbGsIZ89ewfo2DJA,0,0,5,461hxWGrmJ8VYE02TNShVA
1221760,2017-09-27,0,ZKgRlphtyvKNl2sa0Mz2LA,The best jerky in town!!! We tried it once and will be back for more. The thai teriyaki and peppercorn now is our family favorite. Taste so good with rice too... the staff are so friendly and helpful. They have variety of flavor that you can taste it before buy it.

The texture and flavor of the jerky was astounding. Each flavor was properly balanced yet never overpowering the flavor of the jerky. The meat itself was a proper dryness where it wasn't overly chewy or too moist. 
A simple breakdown of flavor:
Original- simple smoke and salinity 
Honey BBQ-Sweet and savory(sesame option)
Spicy Honey BBQ-sweet and heat
Peppered-sweet and peppery
Thai-wonderful Asian spice (sesame)
Secret Atomic-ghost pepper with some sweet (off shelf by demand)
The ladies who run the shop are sweet and fun to chat with and will do a tasting of their products with you. I walked out with Spicy Honey BBQ and Thai both with sesame. Also plan to return many times.
Military and Senior discounts available as well as tunning promotions.",lxbYY-YeQaSsB4eXGIDnZA,1,0,5,UvsianIREfIFeZ1k4ShgcA
2355090,2018-02-21,0,ZKgRlphtyvKNl2sa0Mz2LA,"Great jerky! Quality of the jerky gave me good value for the price. At $9 or $10 per bag I was expecting high quality and it is what I got. I tried the Peppercorn and the Spicy Honey and both were awesome. Some pieces were drier than others to the touch, but in my mouth they all melted and had a great flavor!  I will definitely be coming back.

Also, not sure what the normal hours are since I didn't look, but looking now, Yelp says 10-6, but I was there at 7pm on a Tuesday and the Open sign was still on and they were making more fresh jerky in the back and came right up to help me with samples and a sale!",G_UL5GOgC1H8-A6x25ac_Q,0,0,5,6L_smnVeZikOTdvSG6cqVg
2379623,2017-10-01,0,ZKgRlphtyvKNl2sa0Mz2LA,This is the best of Las Vegas! Tour buses should include this place as a stop on their tours. Honey BBQ is so tasty that one bag is not enough. Family owned business with quality a number one priority.,B_CBeYqfHeV5AWrQ7Z9crA,0,0,5,ux9JWzAa5PnWXBpFsyNcMw

I like the Thai Teriyaki with Sesame Seeds and the Peppercorn styles but all their flavors are really good. Very fresh and shipped fast. Great customer service.

4145627,2017-09-16,0,ZKgRlphtyvKNl2sa0Mz2LA,"No joke, I hate beef jerky...but this jerky is the absolute BEST I have ever had. Forget the convenient store jerky, or all other jerky for that matter...this is your place! Flavors are addicting, and quality is consistent. Grass fed beef instead of God only knows what your getting with commercial beef jerky. Best family owned business, people like this are hard to find especially in Vegas. They truly care about what your getting  and you being happy with the product vs what they are getting in return! Need I say more....BEST EVER!!! Even if you hate jerky, give it 1 chance you'll change your mind!!!",Bz7bB7K8pw_A6bu146rhHQ,1,0,5,_PA7WSYrXu8mxy0l3p3L8w
4418006,2017-09-17,0,ZKgRlphtyvKNl2sa0Mz2LA,"This place is great! My boyfriend has been excited for this store to open for MONTHS. So when i told him they finally opened this past week we had to try them out! Now i've honestly never liked beef jerky. But my boyfriend convinced me that I needed to give it a shot, so i did!
First off the staff is great! Everyone is super nice and welcoming. Thats one of the most important things for me when going anywhere. They were very informative about their products, and were great at helping me pick out which flavors to get. Did i mention their beef is 100% grass fed? Score! So now for the flavors, I got Spicy Honey BBQ, Original, and Thai Teriyaki.

I got Original because I wasn't sure about trying different flavors. I'm a ""plain jane"" type person and i usually go with basic to be on the safe side. Anyways, it was great! Its perfect in texture and flavor. It wasn't tough, so it wasn't insane to chew lol. And flavor wise, the light smokey-ness was yum!

Spicy Honey BBQ was another flavor I wanted because I love spice, and i love honey bbq. So i figured it was a safe flavor to try and experiment with. This one was my top favorite out of the three flavors I got. Texture wise, its also nice and chewy. Flavor wise, its got a nice little spicy flavor, but not so much it kills you. And you get a good amount of bbq flavor in there too! 

Thai Teriyaki is the third flavor I got. This one was my boyfriends top favorite. He loves Asian flavor inspired things. The employees told me this was their spiciest flavor. To me, it did have a good amount of heat but not crazy spice so that was great. I like when spice doesn't kill me! Lol. The flavor had a really nice sweet flavor that balanced out the hotness too. Texture wise, it was also nice and chewy. 

All in all, we really loved the jerky here. I was not a fan of beef jerky before, but now I am! My boyfriend and I are for sure coming back. I think you guys should deff give this place a try!",wD5cNaaNSyVorLtn0Dx_GA,2,0,5,u7Wh2FZcC3y6WxmZwWecZw
