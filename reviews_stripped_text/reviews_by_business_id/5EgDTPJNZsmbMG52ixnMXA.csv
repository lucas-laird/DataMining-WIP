I went back ask her and she said 8.99 is for Americans and no side dish and the size of the soup is smaller. Are you kidding me?! The side dish is not delicious at all. So she basically said because I'm korean. That's why she gave us side dish and over charged 3 dollars on us! If you don't want to get ripped off, don't even go there!",0x6-mp4tZLqIQl9gYxSTcA,3,0,1,wH7s38bvcdMDO-SY7dGoQA

Located on jones and flamingo next to the L&L it's a new place that offers korean food with local flavor. Local flavor that will serve as a good meal for anyone! You have quite a few options... as for me I got the BBQ chicken breast due to diet and my girlfriend got the grilled mackerel. Along with your choice of meat you get to pick other sides which is called banchan in Korean. You can pick things such as japchae which are brown noodles, cucumber kimchee, kimchee, Mac salad, etc. Along with the meat comes 2 big scoops of rice. They are very generous with portions and our meals were filling. I got to try the mackerel and it was good and crispy. My chicken was also good. If I were to suggest something to people that don't know much... I would say try the meat jun or kalbi! Those seem to always be a hit. Excited to try this place again. Pricing is fair! You'll pay anywhere from $8-$15. Give this place a try you'll love it.",F7V-J4rJjWGwtLOcl6hFFA,3,3,5,hgMOrHB6E6eRqNPovzzKng

Location is clean and convenient, but there are obvious differences in how some customers are treated compared to others- restaurant is set up for counter service but the non-white customers got table service, complimentary drinks, extra banchan, etc. Another table present was clearly bothered by this, so maybe a little more discretion should be exercised.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,26,12,3,EZHkM4vdTxAER5bsDQKMJA

   The sides are various Korean style vegetables, Kimchee, clear noodles and macaroni salad.   The selections we made came with a choice of 4 sides.  We tried several of them with the Broccoli, macaroni salad and clear noodles being our favorites.  The clear noodles and Broccoli were lightly spiced and had Sesame oil added to them.  The amount of oil was perfect as it added to the taste but they were not dripping in oil.  The macaroni salad was very tasty as it is Asian style which we all really enjoy.  The prefect amount of mayo and crispy noodles made this a treat. 
   The daughter ended up with the Chicken Curry (was supposed to be Chicken Katsu Curry) which was very good  A yellow curry that was came with chunks of boneless chicken.  It was not to spicy and was really good.  I got the spicy garlic chicken which was boneless and covered in the slightly spicy red sauce.  It was really good too and with a spoonful of rice with the chicken it was very yummy.  The wife got the marinated Kalbi and chicken BBQ combo.  It had a nice amount  of both Kalbi and boneless chicken breast meat.  Both with very tender and delicious.
  The service could be better as I will have to point out the did mess up our order.  We were supposed to get Chicken Katsu Curry but received Chicken Curry.  Had the Chicken Curry not been so tasty this would have been a bad thing.  The inside was nice and bright with plenty of seating.  The menus are on LCD monitors and one monitor rotates with views of the dishes.  Their prices and reasonable what you get.  I will return but will make sure I get the correct order next time.",6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw,14,10,4,OoOUAZmfNOmPINkQSTvnpg
