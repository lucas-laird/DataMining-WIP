Day or night anytime I am ever there , they have this line that just never ends. The food is good but it isn't the very best cheese steak I've ever had, but it's okay. This last time I got something from there, I'd say, it wasn't worth the wait which was nearly 30-45 mins. There's only one or two people working at all times, you're lucky if  you see two . And when only one is there and the other is on break, it's ridiculously slow and the line takes forever. The lady this last time was pretty rude and even though you are busy and customers are constantly ordering, the way you treat your customers is very important and she did not know how to handle it. She was very irritable and rude to the customers. Maybe next time my experience can be better.",xQJHIYTkJR56CT6CqtDyqw,0,0,3,YqhyErke6yspyqeGgwGg1g

Fast and fresh very inexpensive and a lot of food.
Take a chance, you won't be disappointed.",3XSBHH432euFfSq9TBXXXg,0,0,5,LwGts2r8ZcriJOm7MlTWgg

Service can be slow and luster or very friendly depending on workers, but if you know what ""wing dings"" are, they have the chicken wing basket with wing dings and are just perfect.   It is a guilty pleasure snack for the hubby and I or guest if I know they want them.  A casual grab,  a quick bite walk up hot grill.  The hubby likes their fried shrimp too.",WIu4IqktLQ6Qm46L5r5Baw,0,0,4,MVLJum7OzY8WtlIMQ00MXg

So my GF and I stayed at Arizona Charlies Boulder last fall when we decided to head to Vegas a little too early to check into our timeshare...Anyway, long story short, we were lucky enough to find out about Charlies Cheesesteak Deli during our stay!

I'm gonna keep this one short and sweet. We ordered a chicken cheesesteak and a regular cheesesteak with mushrooms and peppers...They took about 15 minutes, which was fine cause there were a couple orders ahead of us. I think it was 7 or 8 bucks per sandwich, and they both came with fries.

The ToGo containers they came in were HUGE, and I thought what a waste of space....That is...until they handed them to me and I felt how heavy they were! Well, at least they hooked up the fries, I thought....When  I got back to the room and we popped them open, and to my surprise, each container contained a HUGE sandwich, with TONS of meat and ample toppings...Plus, HEAPS of fries...

Now, I'm known to have the appetite of a small army, but believe me when I say we could have shared one and it would have been enough food with all the fries...Personally, I thought they meat could have used a TOUCH more salt, but they included salt packets in the ToGo bag(i'm guessing for the fries!)...BooYa! 

Anyway, I guess I didn't keep it that short. This place is solid for casino food on Boulder Hwy...One thing though...it's sorta hard to find, you know, tucked in a corner like many casino dives...But well worth looking for!",8r6iLHioaMxVc2-MXQ89RQ,3,2,4,AEmF85Qa2YVuIP-KpMOkzQ

The Kick Ass Cheesesteak($7.79) has Grilled onions, bell peppers, jalapenos, and topped off with spicy cheddar cheese sauce. I added mushrooms to complete it. 

Measuring at about 8 inches, I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this sandwich was. I think they use spicy cheese wiz for that is exactly how it tastes. 

You get your choice of fries or chips as your side. Come on now, why would you ever pick chips over fries? No brainer there. The fries were actually pretty good. Crispy and not so greasy as other places. 

As a bonus if you get a fountain drink (They have Pepsi products) you get one free refill. Ketchup comes standard with your fries but if you ask for any more extra like hot sauce or ranch, it's 54 cents.

Hours are 12 am to 6 am and 7 am to midnight minds through Friday. 7 am to midnight Saturday and Sunday. 

The only negative things that I need to bring up is that sometimes they only have one person doing everything from taking your order, your payment, cooking your order, and then calling out your order. This happened the second time I went. The first time there was a person at the counter and a second person cooking. Also sometimes you will be inhaling second hand smoke from patrons nearby playing slots. Don't forget that you are still inside a smoky casino.

I ordered the Classic Cheesesteak which came with fries and was $6.80 with the AC Players Card.  It appeared they were cooking one order at a time.  It was another 20 minutes before I got my order.  There was a lot of people waiting for orders.  The people working there did not seem that they were happy to do so. There was nothing special about my sandwich.  The fries were 1/2 done and I threw most of them away.  I would Not return to eat here again.  Normally, I try to find something good about places I eat at because it could have an effect on a places future business, but If their way of doing business continues as it is,... it Does Not have a future.  I advise those of thinking of eating at AC Cheesesteak Deli to rethink their decision and go elsewhere.",L5JFnETi16y2gNiESXBYeA,1,0,1,0TWeE4pWdGxAt1G4ahdBJA

However, the service can be terrible at times. Not that those poor girls don't try but they seem to be frequently understaffed for the volume they do, often working by themselves for hours. Other then the constant staffing issues this place is a gem.",1lntjnx2LvwmyYlZJmWoXw,0,0,2,2tMgcfOiG1uESpD4bAEbhg

Charlie's cheesesteak deli serves a pretty wide variety of sandwiches, but let's be honest...the cheesesteaks are the real reason to come here! $6.99 gets you a cheesesteak with fries (drink is extra) and you better be hungry because the portions here are really generous. If one wasn't really hungry, the meal really could be split between two people. Oh and don't forget to present your player's card for a 10% discount! This locals casino may be a tad rough around the edges but with restaurant values this good, I'll definitely be coming back.",Lfy3FGYMyOqCyNwJ_6fnyg,6,3,4,lTWw66UGJBZFuJKqYYVTPw
