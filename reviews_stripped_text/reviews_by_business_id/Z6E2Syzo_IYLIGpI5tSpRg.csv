Not to mention a lady came in about 40 minutes after us, grabbed a cake from the freezer and even ordered food. She had then customize the cake and had it written on as well. She left before us. We should have gotten a free meal or something for that BS. Never coming back to this DQ location EVER again. The owner needs to talk to his employees about customer service. This particular time wasn't even busy too. This DQ also smells and looks so run down. Their rug in front of their counter covers up cracking floor and their walls are so disgusting. Please clean this place up. You would have gotten no stars, if that was at all possible. Hope this helps for anyone that thinks about stepping into this establishment!

I spent 45 minutes in the drive thru and they really didn't even have a line. once I finally got to the window, I paid, then sat for 15 minutes.

There must have been at least 10 crew members inside the kitchen and it took 5 minutes just to wave someone down. When I finally got someone to speak to me I told them the situation and all I got was an attitude. Not even a sorry for the wait. Then practically got my food thrown at me. When I asked the girls name that was supposed to be at the window the guy shut the window. And said bye. it's ridiculous how rude these kids were.

2076013,2014-02-02,0,Z6E2Syzo_IYLIGpI5tSpRg,"For the most part I like this place. It's the closest burger joint to my house.  The drive thru wait time typically varies from wow that was quick to holy crap i could've gone out of my car go to the bathroom inside come back and my order would still be in the process of being made. The burgers and chicken sandwiches are always solid (well, as far as fast food burgers go I suppose), I usually don't have the shakes and smoothies so I can't vouch for it that much. 

Now my main problem is there's a dip in service at around the dinner hours. I've never had a problem with the afternoon to mid-afternoon staff but, as of writing this review, this is the second time the night staff has forgotten parts of my order (i.e. an actual burger or chicken sandwich), and they've never been big orders either. I'm not sure what happens but its frankly a bit annoying. It won't keep me from coming to this location yet but it's starting to get a bit frustrating.

It's a shame because your ice cream is great. I preordered a father's day cake, filled out a form with details, only to pick up... no cake! Good thing I brought the receipt, they gave me a cake, but the icing decor is so horrid I felt like crying. (Check out photo). 

Secondly, your restaurant cleanliness standards are no short of disgusting. When I arrived, one whole section floor was wet and full of tissues on the floor, the soda machine was leaking soda all over the other side, and the tables all had leftover wrappers, napkins and both the floors and the tables were Sticky. The entire time we were there NO ONE was cleaning. I am surprised anyone goes back here to eat.

Thirdly, your staff is very slow and unprofessional.  Kid in front of me was asking for a cup of water and the counter guy rolled his eyes at her before giving the cup. Moreover, he kept yawning while taking orders!!! So disrespectful, and obviously, 100% disinterested in providing any decent service.  I noticed on yelp several of your outlets get poor reviews.

2968990,2014-08-06,2,Z6E2Syzo_IYLIGpI5tSpRg,"Very disappointed with this particular DQ location. My boyfriend ordered an ice cream cake for my birthday as a surprise. He ordered the cake two days prior to needing it (although this location claims they only need 24 hours notice). He clearly explained to the employee that he needed the cake promptly when they opened at 10am to which she replied that would be no problem. When he went in to pick up the cake at 10:15am, it was not ready. The employees claimed that the top of the cake had not been finished, however we later realized that the cake hadn't even been made at all yet. They informed him they needed an extra 30 minutes to an hour to complete it. Two hours later, we came back to DQ to pick up the cake. It looked absolutely atrocious. It was obvious that the cake was rushed to be made as it was not frozen and the icing work was incredibly sloppy. At this point, my boyfriend was very frustrated and asked for a manager. After much conversation, the manager went to the back of the store to speak with either another manager or the owner of this franchised location. He then begrudgingly offered to take the cake back and refund the money or take $5 off the price. My boyfriend decided to take the $5 off, however looking back, we wished we would have given the cake back and taken the refund. I also found that offer quite strange because I am not sure what they would do with an already decorated cake. Regardless, these cakes are quite expensive and should always be made properly and on time. The owner of this location should be embarrassed they are selling such a poor product.

Overall, this was an extremely poor experience and we will never order another cake from this location. If you are looking to order a cake, consider the Windmill location as we ordered one from there previously and it was made perfectly.",8IkPwZloLgHutA4u5DZZOw,4,1,1,5-IPc-9G4yTrOKErD9D9_A

The two blizzards came out first, I had looked at the cheesecake blizzard and it looked more like a milk shake, my little brother saw the multiple advertised pictures of blizzards upside down, decided to turn his upside down, immediately upon doing so the entire thing poured out onto the table. I told him to go tell the girl at the front, and they will make him a new one, considering that they advertise, ""upside down or it's free,"" the girl at the counter looked like she had no clue what was going on, she literally put her hands up and shook her head back and forth and said, ""I don't know"" another lady came up (I'm assuming was a manager, she was black, older, very short hair cut, with thick drawn on eyebrows and bright yellow acrylic nails) and asked what the problem was, I explained how my little brothers blizzard fell all over the the table when he attempted to turn it over, she asked what kind it was and I told her, and she proceeded to tell me it was whoever had made its fault, and turned and walked away. I figured that they were going to make him a new one because why else would she just randomly leave in the middle of talking to me other than to fix the problem? After a few minutes I waited and asked if they were remaking it, I was told no and then asked if I could get my money back, which of course was another ordeal in itself. The girl at the front told me that she was just an employee and couldn't help me, so I asked if someone was available that could. She said yes, and put two bags on the counter and said ""oh here's your food by the way."" Which I won't even get into how wrong that came out. Finally the same woman I spoke to earlier came back out and looked at me and angrily said. ""so what are you doing here?"" Her attitude astounded me, the least you could do is seem like you cared in the least about guest service. Anyway eventually she refunds me the money I paid for the blizzard, and when she hands my the receipt I said thank you, which she then replied with a very bitchy, ""No."" I get that it's fast food and you can't really expect great service, but honestly, how do you get into a management position when you treat people like they're shit? Not once did anyone say I'm sorry, or that they'll attempt to fix anything.

Over there, it's not unusual for a short line at Dairy Queen to be 4 cars deep. 

My wife and I were out running errands and she wanted dessert and this was the first place we saw so we pulled in. Only a few cars, quick service, friendly lady at the window.  We were in and out of that parking lot in under 5 minutes.

My wife got a turtle pecan blizzard without chocolate sauce. Not a super complex order but you'd be surprised how often this one gets messed up at Texas locations I've been to. It came out perfectly mixed, just the way she likes it.

I come here about once a week for a dessert treat so I know it's not an isolated incident. There is never soap in the bathroom, so I'm not sure how employees wash their hands before returning to work. Today I watched the cashier take our order with gloves on then walk straight back to grab the cones with the gloves on after handling our cash. You can frequently hear the drive through customers trying to talk to the employees over the speakers, yet they are ignored. To add to this, they place their blizzard ads upside down (so they are right side up, and the text is upside down), I'm guessing because they don't understand blizzards are suppose to be served upside down? The employees who work the register or drive through are always rude and preoccupied. The other day the man working asked if we were ready to order. We said yes. And he said go ahead. So we ordered. During this time he turned around fumbling through bags, talking to other employees, and basically completely forgot we were standing there. He then turned back around and said oh. Did u order yet? On top of the bad service our order has not been right in months. The worst thing is they can't dip a cone properly. They dip down to a 1/4 of an inch from the cone, rather than dipping over the edge of the cone. Making the ice cream just flood down the cone. I wish there was another DQ near by, because sadly I am addicted to these sweet treats, but I'm going to have to attempt to stop coming here because it puts me in such a horrible mood.",Fbb0xtV33sBhrWD2B6L3SQ,1,0,1,FaKFXW_M9TnO2vowNRE2uQ

Dairy Queen really needs to advertise and push out their $5 lunch menu. I discovered it through a coworker who would occasionally decide to have lunch here. For $5, yes 5 buckaroos, you get to choose between a chicken wrap, a cheeseburger, chicken tenders, and a chili cheese dog. All these meals include french fries and a sundae of your choice (caramel, chocolate, or strawberry), and all of them come with a drink. This is ALL for $5. My mind is still blown at how much of a deal this really is.

The location I go to has a drive-thru, which I believe most places do as well nowadays. I come here during my lunch break and get my meal within 10 minutes for the most part. I really can't go wrong when choosing this place.

P.S. They have this fry sauce and that is pretty bomb.com, if I do say so myself.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,2,2,4,eVAKviiWmP2BYwG10kJ2ng

I went there again yesterday and I was driving away when I realized that they forgot the most important part of my order: the ice cream! I went back and I had to go inside and when I got my ice cream, it was melted. 

I still give 3 stars because although my ice cream was melted, it was still decent tasting.",yP4Xs0pRH8Uqn-BaEOmJFA,0,0,3,qvifcxV09b0b1VycnaWODQ

Today took 15 minutes to get a small vanilla cone! 
DQ is famous for their frozen treats and they couldn't even get a simple ice cream cone out in a reasonable manner. Spoke to the cashier and was given the excuse that it was a trainee making the cones and Blizzards. A man carrying his small daughter, who ordered immediately after me, walked out because they got sick of waiting for their dessert order. I complained to the manager who was manning the drive thru, he barked out orders to the 2 kids operating the soft serve machine. They seemed to just ignore it. I was fuming at this point and practically yelled at the manager that I just wanted my damn cone! He finally had to do it himself. I called the owner, whose number is listed under the store hours on the front door. I told the Asian man (I'm Asian too) how long the order took and that the ones being trained on the soft-serve machine need retraining. He apologized and said he'd make sure to make it better for our next visit. Unfortunately I won't be returning to this establishment.",0-01KY_GJ_QXp5V4e5xcxg,2,0,1,Z7rR6vOgulf9iLWiS67LRg

As for this location, been here once and my review is solely based on the kid running the intercom.  He was untrained, unclear, and impolite.  We were happy with our order but there's plenty of other ice cream spots to choose from with better service.",s81YWGDJpgdIfsC3rOtiyQ,0,0,2,tj2doXtzKSCaiI1A-_gjbg
