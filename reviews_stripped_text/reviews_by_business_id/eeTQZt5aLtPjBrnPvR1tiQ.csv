Their fried clam strips are pretty good too. Classic soul food cooking at an inexpensive price.",QD_Nm0tNcOy1dzT96fiE_A,0,0,5,uY9bNsz9c-GL0PIvt4FdiQ

Delicious, seasoned right, bread fresh and hot.  Nice and friendly staff.  I had to get the cook's name...Six.  He really knows how to cook.

I originally wanted to order the chicken wings but after realizing i was paying $7 for 8 wings made me realize how frozen and processed they were and the gentlemen there ended up telling me that they were WING DINGS.   As I perused the menu more I finalized my decision to the fried catfish and got nothing more than a basic un-favorful corn meal breading, that I had to drown in salt and hot sauce.

Last BUT FOR-SURE NOT LEAST

As another women and I ate our food, a friend of the guy behind the counter walks in and ask him why they changed locations. For the life of me he should've just texted him the answer because he went into a in depth conversation about how other people running the restaurant left meat and fish out and they received several violations.

2887513,2013-11-10,0,eeTQZt5aLtPjBrnPvR1tiQ,"Prices were fair, was served what seemed to be frozen clams. Was expecting fresh seafood not frozen. The bun was cold and should have been toasted. The garlic fries were weird and not crunchy on the verge of mushy. Had no idea this places was across the street from UNLV, might come back if I'm around, but hopefully they get fresher product.",YEUpvvy_aUUZTWMT2hYuYg,0,0,2,wG8v2K5eFWQ_IyTNrbkxEA
2991724,2014-01-15,0,eeTQZt5aLtPjBrnPvR1tiQ,"We came by on a freezing day to grab some lunch. Glad we did. It's a small restaurant tucked below the sidewalk in the strip mall near the corner of Maryland and Harmon. It's a bare-bones little place but you can tell that the owners are putting money back into the business whenever they get it. The owner and the staff were really nice and referred to all of their customers as ""mam"" and ""sir"". There's an art to customer service that so many places don't get. We got fried catfish. It was very good and came with fries and cole slaw, both good. The owner threw in clam strips with the order. They were great, we couldn't stop eating them. It was a good sized portion and they were cooked perfectly. We'll be back and maybe try the po'boys.",VHNFsnAvK9WGK1qkmm-9jQ,1,0,5,9unNHsdHCmBtTyhpI0jQKA

The inside is really cute and covered in framed jazz posters. Everyone who works here seems really friendly and you can tell they love what they do.

The food was made fast and came out HOT and FRESH! Once I tried the food I was hooked! Their house sauce is a great addition to the already great flavor in their food! Another favorite of mine is their chicken strips. Most meals, so far, have come with a nice portion of fries. You'll  never walk out of the door hungry I'll guarantee that! I plan on trying everything on the menu!",LKkZBXr1Qrj6esPl4MdCxw,1,1,5,bv-xtgTOaV7tADZ5hmH8QQ

4642457,2014-03-07,0,eeTQZt5aLtPjBrnPvR1tiQ,"I am writing this in the satisfied lull of a food coma. The beautiful weather today combined with the general relaxed atmosphere and easy listening provided by the Rebel radio station 91.5 (the Source) made for one great lunch experience.

Being a college student, I'm pretty sick of the Student Union selection and much prefer to walk to the nearby location to find one of a kind po' boys. I just had the catfish lunch combo ($8) including three strips of catfish, fries, and a Mac and cheese. In short, delicious, fresh, and filling.

What I would really like to comment on is the atmosphere. Mr. D is a very welcoming and genuine guy. He's got that good old hospitality that really helps bring down the rush and bustle of the day. The decor is simple and helps spruce up what is otherwise a literally a washed up strip mall. (If you didn't know, this place is subject to flooding and happened one year. Feels kinda like a revitalized New Orleans in here) Strike up a conversation, take your time, enjoy the food and company and you will be doing Mr. Dz fish house right.

It's not that I have time to kill exactly; I have homework to do. But I did need lunch and a break. When I'm done with this review, I'll be heading back to the library feeling surprisingly rejuvenated and calm and ready to tackle my assignments.

Homegrown, traditional, family, people oriented, good food. That's how I would tag this place. 

I'll be coming back. Thanks Mr. D!",thCcBj33p7vLa9eSNKuupQ,0,0,5,Z7niMD5_jALJ22UgyF2mLQ

This is the kind of place a person can frequent and make it theirs. I hope this place stays open for a long time. Say hi to Six at the grill, he'll treat you right. And Dennis (the boss) at the register is never lacking a good story. Good job guys! You've got a customer for life!",viUALw9twPV-z-oinumyJQ,5,1,5,zQhwWU52VCjnaenNUv-RVg

It is perfect for students and staff at UNLV, the location is super close to campus and the prices can't be beat. The restaurant is also great for pescatarians as most of the offerings are delicious fish. I recommend the Po Boy Sandwiches, Fried Clams and the Cole Slaw.
