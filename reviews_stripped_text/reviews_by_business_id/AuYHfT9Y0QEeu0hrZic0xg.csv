I do not  like corn dogs specifically but trying these corn dogs have given me a new appreciation for them. Delicious!!! The regular corn dog my son got was ok but the the brat dogg is pure awesomeness. The maple brown sugar pineapple dipping sauce is perfect.

More on this later.

Went to the food truck festival in Sunset Park yesterday and I knew I wanted to try this place first...but I wasnt that hungry so I thought I would get the pepper jack cheese dog first, its basically a corn dog breading with cheese inside and its AMAZING.

The corndogs are HUGE but I didnt get one as I was not that hungry yet and I had also promised a friend who was there, a Vegan, that I would try a Veggie burger and thats the why why why part.

I waited all day and went to get a Veggie burger and they were OUT!

My friend was ready to go and so we didnt go back into the park so I could get a corn dog either!

1783760,2017-04-01,1,AuYHfT9Y0QEeu0hrZic0xg,"Heard through the FB grapevine that the WBC food truck would be nearby, so we headed on over in hot pursuit.  For this date, the truck was parked on a vacant lot in the desert, near Centennial HS.  Apparently, WBC has a nice following because it was steadily busy the hour or so we were there, with people coming and going.  After a short wait, we ordered two corndogs, one cheese stick (which looked like a corndog), a couple of cold drinks, and the Cajun dipping sauce because they didn't have any Thai peanut curry sauce.  Mustard, ketchup, pickles and jalapenos were also available.  Service was pleasant at ordering and pickup points and they seemed to be cranking orders out as fast as they could.

Hubby knows a good corndog when he tries one (after all, he's been to the renowned Minnesota State Fair, home to anything deep fried) and he was very happily impressed--so was I. The cornmeal batter created a light crunchy outside, which complimented the slightly sweet breading on the good-sized hot dogs and cheese stick. I usually like a mustard sauce, but once I tried the spiced Cajun sauce on the dog and cheese, I was hooked!

It was a bit dusty, so we ate in the car, people watching and admiring the sunset. We had some dessert, too, as The Candy Bar food truck was also present.  It was a good overall experience for us and we've decided to pencil them in on our calendar every now and then for a mid-week foodie adventure.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,1,1,4,iqvuAbjGt5HKeqrJ3fLScg

Holy Moly am I one happy customer. I've been wanting to try The Worlds Best Corn Dogs LV aka the (Happy Truck or is it the Love Truck) forever and ever and I finally got the chance because they were in our area. 

I grew up in Fresno Ca and we were blessed with the County Fair and the amazing deep fried goodness and the Corn Dogs there are worth going home to. I've always wanted to go back just for the corn dogs but I now do not have to because the corn dogs here are freaking amazing. 

The dog is huge and juicy and the the batter is done so perfectly. Crispy with the right amount of sweetness, grittiness and crunch. It's really hard to explain but these corn dogs are so mouthwatering you must try it if you can. They also have huge cheese on a stick both Cheddar or Pepper Jack and they are both o so good. The best park it the honey mustard bbq sauce. Believe it or not it's soooooo good when dipping with the corn dog. 

Corn Dogs at $5 and puppy (1/2 size) corn dog at $3 and cheese on a stick $4 and it's all worth it. I really want one now talking about it and I will be on the prowl for another one.

Puns aside, they have truly perfected their batter. I love lots of fluffy, semi-sweet, super crunchy batter (the best part!) and there is no shortage of glorious golden brown batter in their version. The hotdog is also extra beefy and juicy - my mouth just waters imagining it! 

They passed out samples at the Great American Foodie Fest (at the rio) and it was love at first bite! I was sold and ordered a corn dog right away. We were also lucky enough to also try their cheese stick - wow, equally good. There is no shortage of quality, gooey cheese and that batter could seriously make a boot delicious!

They also have a variety of sauces to select from. They offered your classic ketchup and mustard, sriracha mayo which was a little too weak for my heat seeking tastebuds, tomato & basil for the cheese stick, but my absolute favorite was the honey mixed in with mustard - I know! I'm shocked too since I don't even love mustard like that, but the honey sweetened it up nicely and mellowed out the sourness in the mustard. It complimented the corn dog super well! It's almost like drizzling honey on your cornbread - get the idea?

Pro Tip: Try putting honey on your corndogs!! Just trust me and thank me later! 

Pro Tip: One regular size corndogs is more than enough for a grown man. Toss in a Pepper Jack Cheesedog to top it off.

3167825,2015-01-10,4,AuYHfT9Y0QEeu0hrZic0xg,"Driving home from work a couple days ago, I noticed a tiny little food truck with the words ""Worlds Best Corndogs"" plastered across the side of it. Sadly, we had dinner plans that night...but today, oh today, I was going to put those claims to the test, regardless of dinner plans.

Currently parked on the Southwest corner of Durango & Farm, this little yellow food truck has probably the smallest menu you're going to find on any truck. They've got a corndog, a smaller corndog called the Puppy, cheese on a stick, and drinks. That's it. Looking at older pictures, it seems as if they may have had a veggie option at one point, but I didn't see it on my visit. 

Now, while I'm not some type of corndog fanatic or anything, it's surprisingly hard to find a good one. But, there is one version out there that I do absolutely love. If you've ever been to Disneyland, you'll know which one I'm talking about. It's served at the Little Red Wagon and a few other places throughout the park. And in my opinion, it's one of the best corndogs you can find. Unfortunately, here in Las Vegas, there's just about nothing that comes even close...until now.

Much like the ones in Disneyland, these dogs are hand dipped in what appears to be a cornmeal based batter. The batter is laid on evenly thick, it's warm, and not only do you get all kinds of great texture with the crispy exterior and soft interior, but the flavor is great. Combined with an extremely juicy all beef dog, this is one killer snack. It's salty, it's sweet, it's soft, it's crunchy. And if you're like me, a quick dip in mustard makes everything come together perfectly. At only $5 for what looks to be about a foot long dog, it's also not going to break the bank.

The other options on the menu are reasonable priced as well. A Puppy will run you $3, cheese on a stick is $4, and drinks are only $1.

I can't say much for the service as they basically just rung me up, told me to grab my drink out of a cooler and sent me on my way. But I enjoyed my dog, didn't spend too much, and it gave me a little memory of one of my favorite snacks from Disneyland. After overhearing them tell someone else this corner was working well for them, I'm looking forward to being able to go down the street and grab another!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,4,4,4,5q9MkKQ24aIZ9Mz1yvskEg

I trekked all the way out to the middle of nowhere just to try a World's Best Corndog. Was it worth it? YES.

For a meal on its own, order the regular corndog for $6.00. It's a foot long, quality hot dog encased in crunchy, deep fried batter. Standard condiments such as mustard and ketchup are available, but there are also a variety of bottled sauces -- the honey mustard bbq was the way to go.

If you're not into corndogs or want to eat somewhat ""light,"" there are other options on the menu. The ""Puppy"" is a smaller corndog that's roughly half the size of a regular. Also offered are battered and fried cheese sticks -- your choice of either cheddar or pepper jack. Remember to ask the staff about specials of the evening. 

The truck makes appearances on both the southwest and northwest parts of town weekly during the evenings. But remember to stalk them on social media for their most updated schedule.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,5,4,kNydC_s-9cHoxDvLrnBuKg

You can find this Vegas based truck around different parts of town and they keep their weekly schedule updated on social media (I find it on their Facebook page) regularly. The line can get long, but it's worth it for one of these fried delights. 

Corndog ($6) - made to order, the batter has a nice taste and the corndog is a decent size. I do wish for the price that it came with a can of soda like some of the World's Best Corndogs trucks in other states offer, but whatever. They have ketchup and mustard self-serve style so you can dress or dip your corndog to your liking. Don't forget to ask for a punch card because after 10 punches you get a free corndog.

3737430,2015-06-04,2,AuYHfT9Y0QEeu0hrZic0xg,"Holy Corndogs.... 

I've spotted this truck in our NW neighborhood of Providence this Wednesday on my drive home from work. They seem to have a following with a ton of cars pulled off (there were 3 food trucks this evening on the same corner) and opted to pop by and see what the Yelp was all about. 

I ordered....

1 Corn dog (it was Gigantic) for $5.00
1 Cheese Stick for $4.00

Note: There wasn't any seating during my visit. Plan to stand and eat or take it and run (like I did).  They do accept plastic (which is always a plus in my book). 


I love cheese and dove head first into the cheese stick. I gobbled that sucker down before I took a picture (no regrets). It was spectacular! The batter was great. It was very crisp and crunchy on the outside with sweet cornbread batter on the inside with overflowing gooey Pepper Jack cheese (I believe the other option was Cheddar). I would compare it to a cornbread grilled cheese on a stick. I took a bite and the cheese was perfectly melted with a great ratio of cheese to cornbread. LOVE. 

Now, I was stuffed after my cheese indulgence. I only took a few bites of my corn dog and have the rest in my fridge. The bites I did take were great. The cornbread was just as good as my cheese stick and the hotdog center was tasty. I was taking my items to go and didn't hit up the sauce table for dips (nor did I ask if they offer dips in containers to go-- shucks). I wish I would've checked that table out. 

Final Verdict: 
It's worth the stop. Buy yourself and your family a corn dog meal (or yummy cheese stick) and live a little. Check their social media handles to see if they will be in a neighborhood near you.",3Qv2rjPXC2eNKyV5lh3J_g,4,5,4,zt8H2GNLffmUbLtmoJrXtA

I don't know, because I haven't travelled the world and ordered a CORNDOG at each country. But, I think this is as good as it will get. Should it possibly be re-named, ""world's BIGGEST CORNDOG?""

Most corndogs I've eaten are from frozen food. And most likely the sausage quality is terrible inside. The only other stuff is at amusement parks, which I assume are frozen. Then there's hotdog on a stick. Good stuff but it is mighty pequeno next to the WORLDS BEST CORNDOG.

Great corn bread batter on the outside, GINORMOUS that you'd probably want to share one with another person, and they have awesome specials at times where they use a different sausage inside. 

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the spicy sausage corn dog that was on special for the day. Never had that before so it was a nice contrast between the spicy sausage link and the sweet batter. The regular CORNDOG is amazing as well. And what topped it off for me to make this the BEST I've had is their CAJUN SAUCE. WOW. THAT IS GOOD STUFF. It's rich, not watered-down, got great flavor, and it goes SO well with the CORNDOG.

So I sampled a couple of their dogs at an Easter Egg Hunt event and needless to say, I wasn't too enthused with the food. It was ok but just not my cup of tea if you know what I mean. I got the cheese dog and the kid corn dog. The kid corn dog was the same size as the regular corn dog and the cheese stick was just cheese covered in the cornbread shell. There was more covering than meat and so the oil saturated in the bread casing was very overwhelming for me since I don't eat a lot of fried food like this. 

So while the corn dogs weren't bad, they just weren't enough to persuade me to get them again.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,12,11,2,WlWEGgbnD_f0fXdgRa4hRQ
