A few tips for those who come here to visit: The place gets slammed on the weekends, there is usually a line for a table, and service may be a bit rushed, but the food never suffers.Also, it can get quite warm during the mid day heat.",vPRzJZ4b7ohy-5WGQRP6YA,0,0,5,Myd4yuUzXes-wDn9jgZG-w

The view is a great change from Vegas. My guests are always surprised to see that we have a real mountain setting so close to the city. If you are looking for anything else other than a few drinks, friendly service and a great view then you will most likely be disappointed. I have been coming here for many years. The one constant with this place is the food is always mediocre, at best. The prices are never a bargain. I believe this place has gone through several ownership changes since I started to come here. The one thing all these owners (if I'm correct about that) share is not emphasizing the food quality. My recommendation is to order the safest thing on the menu for your tastes and enjoy the cool air and view. There is no sense in dreaming that this great setting is going to be a great dining option. I don't believe that will ever happen here.

214123,2011-12-29,0,_-TX913SZTfkZuUYB76vPQ,"After a day of sledding, my party and I (4 adults and 2 kids), were starving and wanted to stay on the mountain for some post-lunch sledding action so we decided on the Mt. Charleston Lodge. It's the week after Christmas so of course were expecting a wait. We were told 30 min and thankfully we were seated after about 20. 

That is where the great service ended. Two tables were put together to accommodate our party but were seated without menus (we had to go and get some), we didn't realize it at the time but we were also not provided with utensils or napkins. The drink girl came by (and I call her this because she did not introduce herself) and took our drink order. One of us ordered a Blue Moon and the rest water and soda. All the drinks came except the Blue Moon which we were told that our server Pedro, would bring out. 20 min later, we still do not have the Blue Moon on our table and we still have not met Pedro so we flag down drink girl and she tries to act surprised that he has not shown up yet and says, ""I'm sorry. Pedro's your server."" Yes I understand that he is my server but where is he? Will he be gracing us with his presence? I don't say these things because I am afraid that something other than food will end up in my food but I do give drink girl a look that says her excuses are not making me happy. 

10 min later Pedro comes with the Blue Moon and explains that they were changing the keg. Maybe someone should have informed us of this? drink girl. Maybe someone should have offered another drink? Pedro. So after 30 min of waiting for our server with our stolen menus we finally get to order. When we finally get our food about 35 min later (and the people sitting across from us, who were seated about 5 min before us and who had a different server, were getting up to leave) I am seriously disappointed with the quality of the food for how much they are charging for it. The fries were undercooked and the cheese that I paid extra for on my Paul Bunyan burger had melted off onto my plate. But we were starving after sledding and after having to wait so long that we just dug in. Plus they forgot something from our order. An $8 grilled cheese off the kids menu, come on guys, it takes 5 min to cook that up. 


 After we start eating like voracious animals we realize that we do not have napkins or utensils. We have to wait for Pedro to whiz by us and flag him down and ask for napkins. You would think he would have looked around the table and realized that there were no forks either. So when he comes back with the napkins I have to ask for a fork (for nachos that one of us ordered). Also, when our food came we asked for malt vinegar and ranch. Only the ranch showed up. At least I had something to dress-up my undercooked fries. After we were done eating our sub-par food we ask to have the check split. Pedro gives us the look like, ""I hate spitting checks"" and "" how dare you ask me to do that."" Trust me Pedro, it was the least you could do for the horrendous service.",x8a5aDo7mY5eGOw_160vdQ,2,0,1,yP6_k8xYcMmgaI7HifgT4Q

The prices were WAY to high for what you get.  There were four of us and we ordered the Combo Platter for the appetizer to share.  This $14 plater consisted of 4 onion rings, four chicken wings (they were out of chicken fingers) and three mozzarella sticks.  I just saw now on their menu (because I just looked it up to write this review) that we didn't get the cream filled jalape√±o poppers.  I appreciate that we are up in the mountains and there is a cost of getting goods up there, but that was ridicules.  I also ordered ranch for the plater and they charged us $.50.

We all got burgers and they were good.  Mine was ordered medium rare and that is how it came.  I was very happy with my burger and everyone seemed to enjoy theirs.

Both the girls ordered tea which consisted of a pot of hot water and two tea bags.  On the bill that came to $6.  That, like the platter, is ridiculous.  Even though the burgers were good I won't be going back.",SKxSUuYhCIUf5L1BMDuSEg,0,0,2,UI4skXSZEux0-mjQU_1gzg
618750,2013-06-16,0,_-TX913SZTfkZuUYB76vPQ,"The restaurant is way sub-par, especially for the prices.  The only reason to come up here is for the scenic ride & views.  Being native & practically native to Vegas, we know not to have super high expectations for the restaurant at the upper lodge.  I decided today was an ideal opportunity to share my experience here.

Rode up for breakfast with a group of 6 people (not a huge group).  The service is slow, prices are high & the food is average at best.  The view is great, of course, which is likely the only reason this place is in business.

It took at least 10 minutes before anyone asked for our drink order and maybe another 20 minutes before we got them... except mine, which was the most complicated (iced coffee, so they brought hot coffee in a glass with 2 sides of ice...  the coffee was steaming hot for a long time)...  the other people who ordered coffee got theirs much later & one of them said it was funny that it was cool while mine was STILL steaming...  weird!

We ordered our food at the same time as the drinks since it took so long for them to get our drink order.  Overall the slow service wasn't a big deal because we were socializing.  Beverages more quickly would be nice though.  The manager came by and said there were 2 other large groups they were serving now & our food would be out shortly.  Ok, not a problem.  When the food came out, no one's meal was hot.  My guy's omelet looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 30 minutes (the cheese was kind of scorched).  One can assume all the food had been ready for a while & they just hadn't gotten around to serving it.

I splurged and ordered the banana rum french toast, which sounds amazing.  It was good, especially if you like caramel.  It might have been amazing if it had nuts too & more banana.  I was expecting more, especially since it was $12.

If you know what to expect & are ok with it, cool.  If you don't like how it sounds, you might be better off packing a picnic :)",bjsZPthav8K7sRKGqvX6ug,2,0,2,ycr9WDA1z1IgnaC2VAfLXg

A great getaway from the city life for a few hours, I'm a fan of making the trip up the mountain for some awesome photo ops and drinks. Keep in mind though, they do have a captive audience so I'm not exactly blown away by the customer service or prices. 

Great, rustic setting complete with a fireplace in the center makes for a cozy lunch. I do have a thing for their soups, always hearty and since I've only been up here in the ""cold"" weather (50 is now cold for me, I've turned into a grandma) they're a great match. Burgers, sandwiches, pretty much the norm all at a bit higher price. Look at it as a scenery surcharge, if you will. Take a seat at the bar for a little less of a wait. You can eat and drink right there all while keeping track of the game with their TV's. They have a nice selection of beer and of course some winter-esque cocktails including cider concoctions and grown up hot chocolates. 

Side note, you better be eating or drinking there if you want to use that restroom. They've got hawk eyes watching that patrons-only urination station. Hell, we got a drink one time simply because I feared being sacrificed off the mountain trying to use the bathroom as a non-patron. The manager was super nice to customers but then barked orders at employees which made me a little sad. I mean, we have ears sir, we can hear you too. If it's a method to get the bartender better tips, it worked. I felt bad for dude.

Overall a nice trip away from the exhaust and lights. I'd love to stay here sometime to get the full experience. Don't forget your camera!!",B7mqXzrSFKM_Wff2tbBagw,3,0,3,dNTgUC4flqN0fTsisDc9zw

1083517,2008-01-21,0,_-TX913SZTfkZuUYB76vPQ,"I hate it when restaurants take advantage of captive audiences.  They get so lazy about everything.

I have heard many recommendations for driving up to the lodge and enjoying the view.  It is indeed beautiful, but the roads are packed and there is next to no parking.  I can understand some of the appeal to people that have been living in the desert too long, but after growing up in a colder climate, I don't get too excited about the prospect of fighting traffic to play in 2 inches of dirty snow.  Honestly, people everywhere were trying to use sleds and toboggans and there was almost as much ground showing as snow.
I digress...the Lodge at the top of the mountain has a nice fire pit and some of the only food available in that area.  I went for lunch and was disappointed.  I think I was expecting something slightly more upscale, but the restaurant was very rustic (not in the quaint sense).  The table had vinyl tablecloths and mine was dirty.  The chairs were uncomfortable and didn't seem to be the right height for the table.
My server was very friendly and efficient and I was happy with their many drink selections - I sampled their famous coffee - Drambuie, brandy, vanilla, whipped cream.
It was nice, but served in a wine glass, it cooled quickly.  All of the food selections were beyond boring and had even less innovation than you would expect at a Denny's - Hamburgers, nachos, club sandwich.  My sandwich was bland and a little soggy.  
I guess with that many people making the drive, they don't worry about quality.

Maybe it is all of the years my family has been coming here, but i think it is really special here!!

No trip to Vegas is without a trip to the Lodge.  First off, the drive. It's beautiful! Everything changes from the bottom to the top. Air quality, temperature, plant life... I love going from desert to evergreens.

The lodge itself has a large parking lot. We always do the Cathedral Rock hike first, then come down to eat. Usually those in the group who don't like to hike just stay in the lodge and drink the Mt. Charleston ""coffee"" and get smashed before we rejoin them.

The lodge itself is really great - it has a cabin, rustic feel and I love sitting next to the fireplace. There are great views out of the windows.

Now lets be clear - this isn't a fine dining experience. It's no Jean-Georges in Manhattan. I always thought of it as a lodge/pub. And because of that, I've never been disappointed to open the menu and see burgers and soup.

I will say, the prices are a little higher than i honestly think they should be, but that has never stopped me from going. Every thing I've ever ordered there has been delicious. Their French onion soup is superb. Also, their specialty coffees are SUPER strong! If you are the one that is driving down that hill after eating, i'd suggest only one drink.

I've never stayed in the cabins yet, but I am dying to. It seems like the perfect retreat away from LA, and I can't wait to get here for a few days!

Burgers and pizza on the first menu page?In such a place?Snowing outside?
But hold on, the same menu was in July also, and it was like 100 degrees!!!
My pizza, the meaty feast(or something) was very, very greasy.I used the napkin to take it out and it was a quite good, if not a  bit bland.No mulled wine is a big no-no for such a place in the winter time.My wife she had the onion soup, and I'm not a chef but I cooked it better.She enjoyed it.
I came to experiment something different in here, but no chance!The same pizzas, burgers and quesadilla I can have it near my apartment on strip.

Charleston is the quickest most convenient destination to beat the heat, and at the top of Mt. Charleston is the Lodge.  A modest bar / restruant with food you'll find to be a step above with outstanding outside seating.  I ordered the rueben sandwich, which came with homemade potato chips and a tasty dipping sauce. The sandwich was jam packed with deliciously moist corned beef and one of my favorite things when done right, sauerkraut.  All in all I would have to say the meal was pretty damn good. At first I thought $13 - $20 per plate was pretty steep for sandwiches and burgers, however the serving sizes were larger than average. So it was great for sharing.  If your not looking to spend a lot of money sharing an appetizer and an entree will do ya just fine.  The view from the balcony is absolutely fantastic.  For a few hours you can kick up your feet, have a beer, or 5 and forget that you live in a barren waste land.

THE MEAT: We went in late October and it was COLD.  The winds were strong and it hailed for a good half hour.  The drive up the mountains was quick and lined with large pine trees.  I couldn't believe how close this was to dry flat Vegas!  The restaurant was not very large, but the windows were and filled with good views.  It's cozy ambiance and chill jazz music is a perfect remedy to a long hot week filled with stress and nagging.  We had the chicken fingers/fries, elk burger, bleu cheese burger and chili dog and all were satisfying and in generous portions.  The drinks were good too, try The Nutty Irishman - hazelnut liqueur, Irish cream and coffee - Mmmmm.  Service was EXCELLENT, our server was a mind reader with humor.  We'll be back!

I'M STILL DIGESTING... The old school, tiny, antiseptic white bathrooms.  They're clean, but stick out like sore thumbs in the warm, cozy, woodsy environment.  Time for a renovation guys.

There was indeed two king beds, two sofas, a 4 seater dining room table, a tub/shower, a minifridge, gas fireplace, and a decent sized TV. The TV does not get regular cable, but for $1 you can rent movies from the office. It was nice and cozy and a perfect little weekend getaway. We were all extremely happy with the accommodations

The restaurant was spectacular as well- we had dinner there the first night and were surprised to find options like an Elk or Buffalo burger on the menu. My husband and I had to try them both. They were both excellent burgers and they did not taste gamey at all. I think I prefer the Elk burger, but you can't go wrong trying either one. 
Then the next morning we returned for breakfast and we were all very impressed again. They offer all your breakfast favorites with thick buttered pieces of toast. I got the spinach and mushroom omelet which was so filling and very satisfying.

HOWEVER, Their restaurant could use a little help. In and of itself it is pretty and cozy, in the winter you can enjoy the fire that is in the center of the room. The views are great if you sit close to a window or outside. The menu is decent considering all the effort they take to get the food to the mountain, but for the price (ranging from 12-30 dollars a plate, excluding appetizers like chips and dip or soup of the day) choosing an entree becomes extraordinarily hard. But even this I can let slide by, if and only if I get good service.
I used to waitress and I know what it's like to be slammed, but they were not that busy four servers attending to approx. 13 to 14 tables, seems like a lot but if you have ever worked in the industry you would understand... it's really not that much.
We sat down, looked through and through the menu, and trust me, we are not the kind to rack up a 70 tab, but we decided to have a little fun and live a little... 
Our drink server came over and took our order for drinks, recommending certain things and chatted it up with us, it looked as if we would enjoy spending good money here tonight,he was attentive and friendly. 
He came back with our drinks and about 10 minutes later our server stopped by and asked if we were ready, we glanced down at the menu and he started to walk away saying he would give us more time. I literally had to say ""wait, I think we will order an appetizer!"" he turned and took our order for mozzarella sticks (11 some dollars, very delicious, expensive, but tasty) Our server seemed distracted, but it's ok, maybe he had more tables inside.. I let it slide..
The food runner brought our mozzarella sticks and we finished them before our server even came to the table to take our order. 
We asked him a question about their steaks and he said, ""I don't know but if you need more time, I can come back?"" and proceeded to walk away... I asked him to check for us as he was walking and he nodded and said he would. He did come back promptly and took down our order which included a 28 dollar steak dinner with a  salad and I ordered a half rack of ribs 15 bucks...
We waited 20 minutes for the food, never got the salad until the food runner noticed we had no salad bowl...Half way done with our food, no napkins, ketchup, or offer for other drinks, our sever finally decided to stop by after talking for 15 mins to talk to a busser across the room in our sight and I had a list of things for him to get.. He never stopped by again until I asked for the manager. Out of our hour and a half experience-- I spent more time talking to the manager than our own sever who had maybe two other tables... 
I really wished I would have just asked for a different server... 
I have been there before, a year or so ago, and it wasn't so bad--- but it has really gone down hill in the service department...
I nearly didn't tip him- he's lucky to get the 10% I gave him. 
I could have slapped on an apron and out served him not even knowing the menu.. 
Had the service been great, I would have sat here and written a good review, and the servers wallet would have a little fatter...

Context: mt charleston has two lodges and two eating options, one closer to the entrance and one further into the area. We had hoped to go to the further one but were too hungry, so we ended up at the close one.  
Atmosphere: on the web, the lodge looks very attractive and it has the potential to be nice, i think. Inside was so dark and abandoned, cavernous. Maybe in winter it is packed?
therestaurant is in a large semi circular area with tables against the windows that overlook the outside area and then tables inside. The table was so sticky, we were afraid even to touch it. Furniture was chunky wood.  Views were good but there were many flies everywhere.
Service: the waitress was friendly and efficient.
Food: we ordered the bison stew which had frozen vegetables and it seemed the meat might also be frozen, it was kind of crumbly with this strange texture but it tasted okay. It seemed as if the stew had been made last season, frozen and thawed.  Onion rings were okay with a large serving. Pita bread triangles were served with pesto, sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese, a decent sized serving.  Other items were burgers and sandwiches.",E1p1QZj9sYDkoWLnIX-qsA,0,0,2,XaPxGVNP-uEZjWuEpSFFUg

It was a great drive up to the place, and I was honestly excited to have some rustic food in a cabin restaurant, but alas, all my hopes were shattered the moment the menu was opened.

I expected more game meat and stews than anything.  Call me stereotypical, but we are in the mountains where wildlife roam.  Shouldn't we be able to order a critter or two for lunch?   The menu consisted of artichoke dips, salsa and chips, crab cakes, burgers, pizza, and then the rest of the menu was not available until 5pm.  

We arrived and were seated by 11:20am, and after the server took our order, he came back a few minutes later and stated, ""now there is some good and bad news.  the good news is we can take your order.  the bad news is that I can't put it in the system until 11:30 because we don't serve lunch till then.""  We opted to stay with our order, figuring that 15 minutes to wait plus a few more extra minutes wouldn't hurt. 

After 2 other tables left due to poor service from our server and a long wait for food, we were the last to deal with it.  Patiently, we waited and received our orders by 12:00.  The food was frozen meat thawed and prepped with sauces, and I was truly disappointed.

I don't expect 5 star in cabins, but I do expect an 80 dollar meal for 3 people to taste damn good--and I honestly could eat better tasting food for half the price at Denny's. No joke.

Stay at the lodge for its views and the experience of overnighting in a cabin, but please--for the love of Christ--don't eat their food.

We ordered two burgers, one a cheeseburger the other a patty melt served with seasoned fries, and two iced teas. The bill was $35 w/tax, a bit steep, even taking into consideration the cost to get the food up the mountain. The same food would be $23 w/tax in town.

One thing I found curious is they serve chili, they serve chili dogs, they serve chili nachos, but they don't serve chili burgers. I asked about it and was told, no I can't get a chili burger. I suppose I could order a bowl of chili at $10 and make my own. But if I think $12 is high for a cheeseburger, I'm not going to spend $22 to make my own chili burger.

The burgers were half pound. I had the patty melt, it was good. I ordered it medium and it was medium, the fries were good. My coworker had the cheeseburger, he said it was good.

The service was slow and the place wasn't busy. I wasn't asked if I would like my tea refilled. I could have asked for the refill, but because I was going to yelp, I wanted to see if they would ask., they didn't.

Most of the reviews talk of coming up the mountain to get out of the heat, or for the view. If I might suggest, you could put an ice chest in your car, pick up some chicken or sandwiches on the way and have a picnic on the mountain. It would save you enough to pay for the gas and then some. Also, you would have a better selection of views while having lunch and the kids would like the exploring.

Update: Since I like to be fair, I received this from Thomas at the Mt Charleston Lodge. ""I am sorry for the error, your server was wrong we can add chili to any burger for a 2 dollar charge. Sorry for the confusion Thanks""

I appreciate this feedback from Thomas. I may try the location again and have a chili burger. If so, I will report back.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,1,0,2,5y9wIgEef3DlGHHcOe0P7Q

We also come here for a late lunch.  Our most recent visit was during winter break in December.  The drive up was pleasant as the snow was from the week prior and the roads were clear.

We had hot chocolates all around.  With the hot chocolates, they come with ONE free refill.  

My kids ordered: fries and corn dogs, french bread pizza and chicken fingers and fries.  My wife got the ruben sandwich and I got the buffalo burger.

Hot chocolate was good and warmed us up quickly.  The refill was a surprise and greatly welcomed!

My kids food was good and there were no complaints.  The wife LOVED the ruben sandwich, which also came highly recommended by the server.  My wife ordered this the year before and it was just as good.  My buffalo burger was OK.  I was on the fence about it as it was a little dry to me, however my wife took a bite and said it was really good.  I guess I had have to consider that it was a lean piece of meat with little to no grease so that's where I think it was dry.  But a little mayo on that and the lettuce, tomato and onion and it was doable.

Before, we used to get the chili nachos as an appetizer but they last two years it was not as good as in the past.  

Service was good and we were seated quickly.  Great place for families and those with younger children!  The place is clean, warm and cozy.  Sometimes they have a live band, but they did not have it this time.  Their quirky band in the past was pretty amusing. They sang a song ""She's too fat for me!""

We were seated quickly but it took a while for anyone to stop by after that. Their menu is filled with a lot of typical bar food -- sandwiches, pizzas, soups and salads, etc. Prices are cheaper than on the strip but still pricey considering the place is almost an hour away.

The pulled pork sandwich ($13.00) is a large sandwich with hickory smoked, pulled and marinated pork. Their BBQ sauce was decent but a little sweet and the pork itself was on the mushy side. Not a bad sandwich at all, but I've had much better. The southwestern grilled chicken sandwich ($15.00) was ordered on the recommendation of the waiter who assured us it was great. It wasn't. The menu says it's a marinated chicken breast with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, alfalfa sprouts, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and red onion on a whole wheat roll. It came out without the guac and sprouts so we had to flag down the waiter, who brought out a side of the two ingredients. Even with the added items it was bland and boring. The highlight of both meals was the house-made potato and sweet potato chips.

The place is worth a return visit (again, it's one of the few places to eat in the area). If you go, prepare to be underwhelmed.

The price for the doggie menu ranges from $2-5 and the server even brings water bowls and ice to the table for them.

I do love going during the day however at night just me and my man for a romantic evening by the fire is nice. Nothing like sipping hot chocolate with Irish Cream in it while having a pleasant conversation with a beautiful fire.

The Lodge is a nice rustic restaurant where you'll see plenty of bikers, families, couples and large groups of diners wanting some good food and a nice outdoor patio with a view.

We stopped in for breakfast and they warned us that the wait was going to be ridiculous-but honestly, what are you going to do? Turn around and go back?  Nope, just stay and enjoy the view and the cool weather, no rush and you'll appreciate that you've been warned!  

Good thing is the food has always been very good here so it doesn't disappoint.

Buttermilk pancakes for the kids and I split the spinach omelet with the hubby-portions are huge and even the kids split the kids menu pancakes!

I hope they improve the short staff issue or kitchen shortage because this is still one of my favorite places in Vegas!

It was a bit expensive ($11 for an appetizer sized portion of chicken fingers) but the portion sizes were generous, everything was fresh, and it all tasted really delicious. I had a club sandwich with the homemade chips (yummy with the ranch dressing). The breading on the chicken fingers had a perfect texture and a good chicken-to-breading ratio. The burger was juicy and tasted like fresh (not frozen) beef... but I only tried 2 bites of that, so I may not be the best judge.

Oh, and the fries were perfectly cooked! Just crisp enough on the outside and mealy/ fluffy on the inside with a good amount of salt. And the slaw had a cool, tangy dressing and a nice hint of fennel.

The waitress was very friendly, and didn't mind when we changed tables to come inside.

But really, when you're up here, lodging by the balcony and surrounded by the breath-taking scenery, the last thing on your mind should be facebook.

By the time we got here in the late afternoon, we were already out of breath from our 4 hour jog at Robbers Roost at Lee Canyon and needed a good dose of carbs to refuel. The lodge sat right along Kyle Canyon past the fire station and library, nestled among the greenery. The staff greeted us with a warm welcome to a suburban-esque restaurant made of wood - simple yet sophisticated, not to mention it had a very relaxing ambiance. 

With that said, we decided to share an order of the grilled flatbread as well as the garlic roasted chicken pizzas among ourselves. Not taking the positive bias of being the hungry hannahs that we were, I have to say that the pizzas were pretty good, comparable or even better than Cici's pizza. Our mutual favorite was the garlic roasted chicken pizza which was very flavorful and filling. If only we had room to try out dessert, I would've opted for the deep fried cheesecake (it's described in the menu as: Freshly baked New York style cheesecake wrapped in ajumbo flourtortilla with a touch of cinnamon. Topped with chocolate synrp, raspberry) just so that I could say I've already tried this alongside deep-fried mochi but I guess that'll have to wait for next time because we were stuffed to the brim. The service was good, staff was friendly The place deserves a 5-star for its atmosphere alone (I must admit, I am quite the nature girl at heart). Watch out for the prices though.

Coming here gives us a sense of peace and relaxation.  It's a great way to just get away from reality and just escape.  It's funny I mention that because people actually come to Vegas to escape what ever they want to escape from.  How ironic is that?

When checking in, the front desk lady is always nice to give us all the instructions we need to have the best and most comfortable night we can possibly have.  The room we got was #16 and it's the best room you can ever have.  It's spacious and has everything you need from the cute little microwave, TV, fireplace, huge hot tub, living room , balcony with two chairs, and huge bed.  The bed is humongous!!!  The room is very clean and after my detailed inspection, I always find nothing wrong with the room.  

The decoration is very old style vintage.  Bed frame is wood log looking, the whole room is made of logs, the lounge frame is made of logs, etc.  If there was ever a fire it would only take minutes for the whole place to burn down to ashes because everything is made of wood.  Everything in this lodge is in its place and in it's place everything is.

Since there's really nothing there, and the food at the lodge restaurant is really not that great we had to drive back down to Vegas to get our dinner.  I know, we were escaping from Vegas only to land back there for necessities.  But, once we settled, at night we would just sit out on the balcony and watch the stars beam so bright.  It's the best place to just look up and admire God's creations.

I do have to speak of the food at the Lodge Restaurant.  I'm sorry but the food here is just so pathetic and sad.  I've never spoken ill of a restaurant as I am now and that's just wrong to have to do but I have no choice.  I ordered a turkey sandwich which looked like a horse prepared it.  I say this out of love because this was the kind of love I got with my sandwich.  They just literally slapped on the lettuce, meat, cheese, and tomato - by the time I got it the whole sandwich was all over my plate.  My boyfriend got something that tore up his stomach, I completely forgot what that was.  Another thing, when we walked in the restaurant it felt like all eyes were on us.

I ordered from the Twilight menu (soup/salad, entree: bacon-wrapped sirloin/ chicken/ tilapia, and dessert: raspberry cheesecake/ creme br√ªl√©e).  The view is amazing but I can't say the same thing about the food.  Our group ordered the combo platter (mozzarella sticks, jalape√±o poppers, chicken fingers) and it was marginal.  I got a house salad with ranch dressing, bacon-wrapped sirloin with baked potato and veggies, and a creme br√ªl√©e.  I and a few in our group ordered steak to be cooked medium but we got well-done hockey pucks.  The cook could've used a thermometer to check for doneness.  It was bland so I had to douse my hockey puck with salt and A1 sauce.  The only saving grace this place had was the creme br√ªl√©e, which could  have been torched a bit more so I wasn't crunching on raw sugar.  Nobody in our group had anything positive to say about the food.

The cabin we got was great.  They had a hot tub in there which was a very nice plus.  TV but no reception (you can borrow DVD's from the front desk), no phone, no clock in the place.  Its just so peaceful out there.  We cannot wait to go back.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,6,3,5,QtFk-046Sj6RN9m_8sV1OA

I ordered simple pasta dish and my friend ordered a salmon plate. Really not exaggerating but I can cook, and probably anyone with basic skill, can make better dishes than what we got. The pasta with simple marinara sauce...how hard is that? I should've taken pics of it. The pasta wasn't drained well and half of the bowl was filled w water. Yuk~! And the pasta wasn't cook and the veggies weren't fresh at all. My friend's salmon was burnt on outside and dried and partly cold inside. The staffs weren't friendly at all either. Never again for sure~!",U98mZaQAsHXym6FyhGCZdA,0,0,1,XmkCLAUhwTMF6spz5qp7tg

It isn't that far from Las Vegas, but it sure is a change, with views of mountain peaks. I went in to the lodge for a snack. It was nice enough. Great views. Worth a trip up.

We would come to play in the snow and then warm up in the lodge.
One time I came with  my fancy grandmother and she had escargot. Oh La La. I didn't think the lodge had snails. But they do!

When I got older I started coming here on my own, still to play in the snow. But as an adult started to order fantastic warm drinks, like Peach Snapps apple cider, and Irish coffee... So warm and fuzzy and wonderful. I LOVE this place. Its the best around the holidays. So cozy and sentimental. Nothing but great memories.",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,0,0,5,KoXpME2miZIPsBdUH_flwA
5823092,2013-11-04,1,_-TX913SZTfkZuUYB76vPQ,We went there for hot chocolate and were told that we had to drink it outside because we were not ordering food... We had small children and an elderly couple and they wanted us to sit outside in the cold. It was so cold in fact that the waiter keep commenting on it. The manager keep walking by while we were inside saying we had to go outside and that we couldn't stay inside but he would never say it to us. You could tell the waitress felt bad. They also kicked out two other families. We ended up spending $70 and they made us sit outside. Never going back. Not even close to worth it. The only good thing was at least the waiter was nice even if the manager sucked.,91nlbcBcPaK0j-BKHEyHkA,2,0,1,NeQzEu_HuQKYs2d24KR2Ew
5838006,2011-08-23,1,_-TX913SZTfkZuUYB76vPQ,"Another couple wanted to introduce us to a place with a spectacular view, good grub, and cool air: Mr. Charleston Lodge.  So, always ready for a new eating adventure and some relief from the oppressive heat, up we ascended out of 105 degree weather in the Las Vegas valley to the top of Mt. Charleston, where the temperature felt like it was in the 70s.  We entered a rather charming lodge, and walked through it to the dining area outside atop wooden decking overlooking opulent chalets and the green mountainside.  Deciding to go rustic, I opted for French Onion Soup, Caesar Salad with Bay Shrimp, and a bowl of Mountain Chili.  

The Onion Soup was quite tasty, with well caramelized onions and a cheesy top.  But the salad was disappointing, composed of just Romaine Lettuce leaves with croutons and Parmesan Cheese shavings on a platter, and Creamy Caesar dressing on the side.  The strong dressing overpowered the greenery, and the Shrimps were bland and at best lightly seasoned.

The Chili, though, was satisfying.  Offered a choice of kidney or pinto beans, I chose kidney on the advice of our server, and did not regret it.  Mixed with ground beef and added red onions--but no cheese--the Chili was spicy, filling, and excellent.  

Here one can get really close to nature, as I soon realized as a humming bird narrowly missed drilling into my ear, and a small spider landed on my arm, while I was eating!  With plastic chairs, the setting is very casual, but the view overlooking a mountain peak quite majestic.  So, I decided to enjoy the scenery a little longer by ordering a slice of heated Apple Pie and Vanilla Ice Cream.  The large piece of pie was warm, crumbly, and very tasty, and the ice cream creamy.  But the Whipped Cream overlaying all melted too fast on the plate.  Overall, this was a 3-1/2-star dining experience.

Our friends were kind enough to drive us around the narrow, winding, and ever climbing streets near the mountain top to view cabins that looked more like mansions perched at odd angles on irregularly shaped parcels of land.  One had a two-car garage but a truncated cement driveway that would only support 1-1/2 cars.  We briefly explored The Resort on Mount Charleston on our way down the mountain before finally heading home.  Its premier restaurant, A Cut Above, should be good fodder one day for a future review.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,2,2,3,fZOM9ZPz1a5BSD7XmZyS6w
5919206,2014-01-01,2,_-TX913SZTfkZuUYB76vPQ,"If you are looking for a getaway breakfast spot, keep on looking.  Nothing special, and very small menu.  I literally, drove right past the ""lodge"", because its an old A-frame for the restaurant, located right next to newish log cabins.

The restaurant is large.  An older room, a fireplace in the middle, about a dozen bar stools to your right, and a pretty open space of tables and chairs.  During the day, it isn't much too delight.  In the evening, I suppose, it gets cozier...and its one of the only games in town.

Despite the small menu, I ordered a bacon, cheese, onion, tomato, and peppers omelet. With a side of tomatoes and egg beaters, it was an uneven trade for real egg and home potatoes...but better for the waistline.  $14, and it included terrific large and fluffy toast.  The eggs had little bits of bacon mixed into the egg, so it was grande to have the taste in literally, every bite.  A bit overpriced, but you have a captive audience.

Disappointing was the place itself, but what won me over was the service and the food.  Special shout out to Rocio, who was super cute, too.

Outside, quite spectacular views. 3.5 rounded up.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,5,5,4,oRgaXf39dYms3kF_FlGUmA

The cabins were really nice. I LOVED the sweet weekend I spent here with my husband.  We got a cabin w/ two king beds, because our friends may have come up but when we arrived everything was in the same room.  It worked out fine because our friends didn't show up, but beware if you get a cabin with more than one bed you're going to be in the same large room.  The tub/shower was also in the room, the only thing separating you showering from everyone else in the cabin was the shower curtain.  Again, if you're looking for a romantic weekend getaway this is a great place.  They also had the option for put roses and chocolates in our cabin, my husband got these..they were beautiful and super fresh! 

The hiking was really nice too! There were a bunch of trails and everyone at the lodging/visitors center were super helpful.  We could walk to a lot of trails, but if you drive down to the visitor center you'll have a lot more options. 

I thought the restaurant was great! Breakfast was delicious! We had the omelets, the breakfast burritos and the french toast.  It was YUMMY! We also had dinner here, we had the nachos appetizer which was good...really good chili.  I had the ruben for dinner, it was really good and my husband got a burger which he said was ok.  Both plates were HUGE; way to much  much food to finish in one sitting. 

I'd definitely come back here for another weekend away from the city!",5YR_DM50DTMEK_8ydDjaaw,0,0,4,brVBXKKGfTuE_OZz1ItjGg
