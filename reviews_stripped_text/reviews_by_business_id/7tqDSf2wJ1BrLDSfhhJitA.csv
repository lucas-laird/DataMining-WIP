Although I waited for my food a little long (maybe because they've taken a lot of orders before me) but I can say it was worth the wait!!! Their garlic chicken was really good kinda remind me of Mitsu-ken back home and their spicy ahi poke bowl was amazing! It was served with seaweed salad, edemame, and cucumber/crab salad. We also had their Teri Burger which we had to order another one because it was that good! Now I want to try the other food on their menu. The price isn't too bad. Even though I waited long for my order,  the food made up for it! The young ladies that took my order were friendly! I'll be back again for sure.",kQfm0hWLCZQjQ89vevilCw,1,0,5,II2PzlhlycnEESmDDVOG6g

2312612,2016-10-04,1,7tqDSf2wJ1BrLDSfhhJitA,"Wife and I ate at the food truck last Friday night on the corner of Ft Apache and Sunset after hearing good things about the food.  Well you guessed it by my rating it wasn't that cut out for good.  Wife had the garlic chicken and I had the fried noodles.  Chicken was like eating baby chicks, small and not very many of them, taste was like eating garlic wrapped with chicken meat.  If you like garlic this is good for you.  Fried noodles was very dry, no taste, little veggies and it doesn't comes with rice or mac salad so you have to order side dishes.  Not true Hawaiian Style.  Large styro-foam containers were like getting a small order from L&L.  Would I eat here again -- no, to little bit and to costly.  One customer even brought her own table and chairs because there are none.  We ate in my truck, not very comfortable, but just like back home at the old lunch wagons in Sand Island, Kewalo Basin, Keehi Lagoon Park, North Shore, etc.  
We checked out all the other food trucks, wow expansive and they don't take food stamps!  Its like trying to buy a plate lunch at the Ho'olaulea's very costly but at least getting in was free.",fYBwTpuyK5ujW2vZs9OWlQ,0,0,2,U2o923fkMEmVNt_VBQmOCQ

The macaroni salad and rice that came with the garlic chicken were also just as bomb.

2673220,2016-09-12,2,7tqDSf2wJ1BrLDSfhhJitA,"I encountered Islandtucky Fried Chicken at Food Truck Friday. The wait was long for the food, maybe due to the amount of orders. However, the garlic chicken (about 6 pieces) tasted great! It was garlicky, but slightly sweet, and oh so crispy! I don't like Mac salad so I can't fairly comment on the taste. The rice was made well. The whole meal was $9 well spent. The teriyaki burger was cheap (about $4), but I didn't try it. Maybe next time! Employees were also very nice.",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,4,2,4,VCcRUQDWcHOYA4r6TjF_iQ

The food is very sweet, which is signature island food, but for some reason it felt a little too sweet for my taste. For the cost we received a decent amount of food.

I thought a Regular meant more chicken, but it seems like slightly more chicken than a Mini serving plus rice and mac salad. I really wish Regular meant garlic fried chicken with a two sides of garlic fried chicken-- it was that good and honestly, I'm making a beeline for it next weekend. Slightly sweet, hella garlic-y, and that crunch. *swoon*",KLjva3c6MY9JWtpkIWd1jw,0,0,4,hgyqHkskXt5XLwgn1eM0cA

My excitement to find out that they had a Yelp page was real. The bento is my go to. Comes with their signature crispy garlic chicken, spam, sausage, fried saimin and white rice. Seriously so delicious!!!!!! They have an Instagram account you can follow, to know where they're going to be located.

I stopped by after passing town square after a workout & now every Thursday I want to come back just for this food truck. I had their pork hash, which was huge & I wouldn't doubt if it was created in heaven & sent back down here to islandtucky. I am amazed. I also had their chicken & that was also very delicious. They have a small menu with garlic noodles, fries & a couple of other items That I will be back to try for. All in all you must go here!!

Islandtucky looked to be the most promising and it didn't disappoint. I like that they use chicken thighs in their garlic chicken plate ($8.95). The juicy dark meat is the way to go to get the most flavorful chicken. The breading on the meat was good, but not as crispy as I'd prefer, while the sauce added a touch of sweetness to add depth to the flavors.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,5,3,VK-4KT7956q3ROKdyMcqrg

3823054,2017-08-04,0,7tqDSf2wJ1BrLDSfhhJitA,"Our friend invited us out to this food truck party and tonight it is located at town square in front of Total Wine. Out of all the trucks here, I recommend ""ISLANDTUCKY"" food truck. This definitely serves the purpose in their name, traditional Hawaiian flavor! 

The server Natasha, is very helpful, friendly and professionally knowledgeable about their menu.
When you come up to her or anyone of their staff, they will suade you into getting your mouth watery enough for one of their specialties.

Today I was introduced to their signature item, ""Garlic Chicken"" $11.00 and my favorite, ""Fried Noodles"" $9.00. 
However, I do recommend they name their specialty items for marketing and advertising. There's so much food to try out at a good price for the portion size.

Btw, they also do catering. Give them a call at 702-337-1508

Come and try it! Aloha!",lUGiHH2La_BuHoBrR1aGlg,2,1,5,uxOrUhz8ZWxEvWv3AjZzAQ

Although I wanted to try their poke, I ended up trying their garlic shrimp, which was good. I was very disappointed in the mac salad. Which was actually one of the worst tasting I've had. Maybe it was an off night but there was no flavor whatsoever on it. It literally looked like they boiled the mac and just tossed it on the plate. No flavor. No mayo. No nothing. I'd probably give them another chance if I see them on the road again.",7GbWj40k0dA8k2EdVRfX-A,0,0,3,vgfAQn9iLfB9Y2VCMIj4hg

Eh no laugh at da name.  Dis place get broke da mouth garlic chicken FTW!

Short and sweet, one singular dish, garlic chicken. Close your eyes while eating it and you will think you're having the best in Hawaii.  It easily eclipses anything at other Vegas ""Hawaiian"" plate lunch eateries.

Flour / cornstarch dusted chunks of chicken thighs deep fried golden brown before being tossed in a sweetened, garlicky, soy bath.  Yes it loses some of its crunch but it's worth giving up for the great flavor.  Inexpensive at $9.  

Worth seeking out.  In this case it was the Great American Foodie Fest.  See their website for upcoming locations.

5623607,2017-09-28,0,7tqDSf2wJ1BrLDSfhhJitA,"THE BEST GARLIC CHICKEN IN TOWN !!! I was very surprised when i tried their signature dish of the garlic chicken. The bento box comb was perfect that came with furikake rice, saimin noodles, spam, hotdog, and garlic chicken. I also ordered the garlic chicken plate which came with macaroni salad and rice, well worth it. 

I also tried their poke a long time ago, it was very authentic and had a taste of homemade to it. 
I still have much more to try in their menu like the garlic shrimp which is occasionally served.

This food trunk is family owned and it seems like they are all related working here which is awesome. The services was super friendly and fast. I suggest for everyone reading this review to come and enjoy this awesome authentic Hawaiian food.",w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,5,0,5,Zw4zuXpU-lNnrQJu78Pa0g
