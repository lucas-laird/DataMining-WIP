23614,2016-02-28,0,3Qe4M3JNs7yIRXP13g-NYA,This is a nice modern bar has a lot of nice TVs very functional and spacious. The servers are sweet and the owner is flexible with the bar and is very helpful. If you're looking for a nice meeting place this is a great place to meet. Also at night there is often a lot of entertainment music so on. If you consider everything together over all the bars about an 8.9 out of 10. Great parking. The location is a bit hidden but definitely worth finding.,TjW9eHVZJRkaNqOtndmIjw,0,1,5,CfWs50TBCc4oPeBJDRQ3rA

When they bring in music groups, the place has a very intimate feel to it. The best thing about No Regrets is the staff. They make everyone feel comfortable and welcome. This outlook begins with the owner who makes a point of meeting and getting to know her customers. Do yourself a favor and check out No Regrets.

We have always had a memorable time. And we drive from Summerlin. So needless to say, we kinda go out of our way to be there. So tonite we decide to check out the early Happy Hour. Wow, what a different experience. You'd think we were two people with leprosy considering the way we were totally ignored by Karla. We sat at the bar in the very middle. Over a two hour period we had several drinks. Each time I had to flag her down to place an order. We've sat at other bars in the far corner and received better service. 

We gave Karla the benefit of the doubt until it came to getting the bill. We were charged normal price when we clearly ordered during happy hour. I tried my best to bring it to her attention, but my efforts were all in vain. So after I wrote on the receipt what the correct amounts should've been, I left leaving $0.00 for a tip. I'm a very generous tipper, ask any of my regular bartenders at PT's. But I was so dismayed at the service that even $0.01 would've been generous. I was generous with my rating because of all of our past experiences there. But the next time I go there I will turn around and walk out of Karla is on duty. It I could title this post, it would have to be, ONE REGRET....We will stick to the late night happy hours for sure! And BTW, the chicken strips with ranch are awesome!

Shawn, thank you for taking time to provide a thoughtful response. You're right, we are all human and errors & misunderstanding can occur.

Ordered Crown Royal on more than one occasion- always perfect!  

Hung out on lazy afternoons and late at night and always had GREAT SERVICE.

1008238,2018-01-20,0,3Qe4M3JNs7yIRXP13g-NYA,"This place is not worth your time or money. My boyfriend and I went on Friday night because it is listed as a live music bar. First noticeable flaw is that is in a foolish location. When we went in you can quickly determine that the decor is well above average, it's actually nice looking for a gaming bar. We both sat at the bar and ordered a beer. After being there for about 40 minutes the ""band"" started. 2 guys with day jobs I hope. My guess is that their talents are chasing people off faster than bringing them in. After being there for about an hour now, a couple things are obvious. There are 2 bartenders, one of which I perceived to be the owner. Neither of them are accommodating, friendly, charismatic, or welcoming. Needed to flag them down to ask for another beer and for a menu, it was never offered. I should mention that we were 2 of 7 customers. The other observation was that the gaming here is atrocious. We each played $80 on Keno and it did nothing but take, not there fault but it's really bad. After looking at the menu, we kept it simple chicken wings and nachos. Neither were impressive in any way. Once again, no bartender around to see if we were enjoying or to offer simple things like napkins. At this point we just asked for the check. While we were there we each had 3 beers for a total of 6. When we got the check only 2 had been comped. I mentioned earlier we each played $80. Seems a little tight to me so, I asked about it and we only ended up paying for one. In the end there just aren't any reasons to seek this place out. This is a competitive town and you need to be different or impressive in some fashion. They are not getting that done here and the business level on Friday evening is reflective.",KHGObncvyO3HZks6oWjlbA,0,0,2,x9Pix9MGV1qfDMcTXJ4vfA

The bar overall was cute w/ a nice smaller stage & curtains on the left corner as you walk in.  The bar desserts look great, but I had the Chicken Wrap which I picked apart cause I didn't like the sauce.  The Moscow Mules were great w/ the perfect amount of Ginger Beer & Vodka.

Looking for an unusual craft beer on tap? They got it. How about attentive service where the Bartender remembers your name? You bet. I can't think of a single complaint for this bar except that I couldn't stay all night-- which apparently is coming in the near future. 

No Regrets is tucked away in a business complex on Roy Horn and Durango. Don't get me wrong, Google Maps gave me perfect directions, so don't be discouraged if you're not familiar with the area. 

Their reverse happy hour (12-3am) is perfect for those who have had a late night at work and who don't want to be rushed at other local bars (I'm looking at you PTs ). We took advantage of the 2-4-1 margaritas, which you can apparently enjoy all day, not just happy hour. I totally recommend the margaritas, which are not filled with cheap sweet and sour mix, but filled with tequila goodness. 

The vibe is there, the price is awesome, and it's just down the street from my house. What really made the night was the good music and the hospitality. Kyle really knows how to take care of his guests and I will definitely be back when he is tending the bar.

First off it's kind of weird getting here from Sunset cause you have to maneuver through the parking of some business building. But it's basically located near Baguette Cafe. 

Live band every Fridays and Saturdays after 9pm. That alone is pretty awesome. It's not always the same people playing each night but always entertaining.

2 for 1 margaritas all day everyday. What seem like a pretty full bar with lots of different whiskeys.

If you're a fan of Baguette Cafe they have sandwiches and salads from there. Besides that not too large of a food menu.

People get hooked up while playing poker machines so just insert a couple $100 bill and have a good time 

The interior is nice. The staff are very friendly and awesome. It's a chill place with outdoor patio.

We had already eaten dinner but looked at a menu anyway.  The majority of their food comes from the Baguette café next door so it's not necessarily your typical bar food.

When I went to the restroom I noticed they have a large private room in the back which is great for large parties.  Also, you get $10 freeplay for signing up for their players club!

First, this place is located in West Vegas right next to the 215, which makes it very easy to get to. There is plenty of parking so no worries about that.

I never paid a cover to get in, and was never searched either. This is definitely a small quiet place that has nothing to do with your typical Vegas/strip club or lounge. Expect to meet a lot of locals there rather than tourists.

This place runs quite a few promotions here and there and also offers a happy hour. The food and the drinks are of but don't expect anything amazing. Appetizers are rather on the cheap side.

Standard beer options. Nothing exciting about wine and cocktail menu but the bartender Jamie was very friendly and took great care of us. 

We ordered the steak nachos to nibble on and they were big time. The steak was very tender, juicy and delicious. The tortilla chips, although covered in lots of toppings, kept their crunch and did not get soggy. They even have a cute little patio. It was too cold for us that day but looking forward to returning when it warms up.

There were only a handful of people there when we came in, but service was slooooow (food order of 3 appetizers took about 45 mins to come out) and the food was just plain bad. Could tell the food was previously frozen. Wings were about $2 each, covered in canned hot sauce (eww) and served with ranch that came from a bottle (eww). Also, when I asked the waitress about where our food was, she snapped at me.

4660960,2017-01-14,0,3Qe4M3JNs7yIRXP13g-NYA,"The owner called me and asked that I take my original post down. After rereading what I originally posted and took out the part a about my husbands phone disappearing, because they did find and were able to get back to him which is very much appreciated, there is nothing incorrect about what I said.  I was shocked that the owner would call me and ask to remove a post, which is why I have upped the stars to be more fair in the rating because up till the end of the evening the service was great.  Also I can appreciate the fact that being a small business owner is very difficult and you just try to do your best, but still none of my original post was untrue...So after some thought, I am adding the good stuff too instead of deleting the post.  I still don't think that it was appropriate to be called by phone and be asked to take down a post that was true albeit, I admit, one sided. 

The service was prompt and the servers are friendly, staff were very attentive even though it's a pretty busy night. Looks like they had pretty good promotions as well, a nice atmosphere and clean.  Which again is why I had a good feeling and it seems like a nice place to come back to until I received my bill. But looking back on it also, we probably did have more drinks then they could comp, but it would never even have been an issue had someone said, ""we're just gonna go ahead and run you a tab. -----------------

Watch out for you not getting your drinks comped and not being told. Not that I mind or can't afford to pay for my drinks but I was gambling as soon as we came in and my husband sat down beside me and ordered a few drinks and we kept putting bills down on the counter to pay for it but they never took them. 
Now we're Las Vegas locals and typically what that means is that the bartenders feel that you're gambling enough to pay for your drinks and your significant other's as well... I guess I was wrong at this place. Later during the evening he started gambling also and I guess that's the only point that he started getting his drinks comped if at all because I wasn't keeping count. 
When we were getting ready to leave I asked for the tab because we had ordered some food and as far as I knew that was the only thing that we are going to have to pay for... 
A friend of mine joined us and was not gambling andI paid cash for all of her drinks and each time I paid they took the money and gave me my change. 
My husband won on Keno... not  huge amount but a pretty good amount, a bit more than what had already lost, and I wonder if that's why; but when I got the bill, again for what I thought would only be the food it was almost $70.  Only $16 of that was for food. When we first walked in, I thought...  hey, this is a nice little place and close to the house...  I thought to myself that I would definitely be back. Now I'm not so sure. I certainly don't mind and definitely am happy to pay for our drinks, but it appeared that the drinks were taken care of and to have that large of a tab when we go to leave, especially when I tip$2-4 per drink as they were poured, it was shocking. 
Apparently it seems as though that they are taking after the chain bars nearby.",k8O3rGlZPYHEqTdXrGAMBQ,1,0,3,l9-wXd6kxP-C_aPq-D7QWg

We were so impressed by the food quality and we felt the price was very reasonable. The wait staff was very nice. The only reasons I can't give it five stars is because the non-smoker crowd's only seating option is in a weird dining room that's just a sliver of the whole space. And it's not staffed with it's own servers, at least this day it wasn't. Normally we don't mind a little smoke out on the patio, or in a bar, but it was very smokey in the main bar area that we wouldn't have been able to enjoy our time. We were in the dining room by ourselves and the poor server was having to run back and forth to wait on us. We loved the food and everyone was very nice we just wish this place was a little more non-smoker friendly, or family friendly because the food is too damn good not to be!

I got the chicken street tacos that the chicken was great, but I could not eat the soft taco shell because it tasted fishy. Yeah fishy, I didn't understand that either. The chicken was good though. I also got the Spicy chicken flatbread. That might be really good, but I could not taste anything besides my tongue burning. For that I cannot complain to much because some people love the heat, I am just not one of those people. We ordered the sweet potato fries to share, and those were just nasty.

It was hard trying to find this little hidden bar as it's enclosed and tucked in the center surrounded by bigger commercial business-y buildings, which is cool don't get me wrong, since it's pretty lowkey. 
Upon entering there's an outside patio in the front of the bar that lights up at night. A lounge-y type of vibe, with a bunch of cozy couches and such. 
We decided to sit inside and was greeted by a nice older woman. She was kind and informed us that happy hour will be extended throughout the Golden Knights hockey game, which was awesome because they have great HH food and drink specials! She and I ordered the burger HH special, and they got the nachos (with steak). 
The burger patties were quite large, but the fries reminded me of McDonald's fries. And it automatically came with mayo spread in the burger. 
I rate the burgers 3/5. 
The nachos looked decent as well, nothing to note.
The environment in this bar was 5/5 for sure, and we'd definitely be back for happy hour drinks.

If you're looking for a warm and inviting bar minus the roughnecks, this is your place. The ambiance is pleasant, the staff is courteous and welcoming. The food is delicious and healthy.

There is a full dinning area for meetings/social gatherings in a closed off area from the bar, which can be booked.

If you happen to catch the owner, she will welcome you with open arms.

I probably should have done more research, but this is definitely not a good location for groups events. The happy hour prices advertised on the website also weren't going on when I visited, so I'm not sure if these change month to month or what. 

It was also upsetting because as I was outside enjoying the air with friends some random man hopped over the fence and started selling his locksmith services to us. Then he started lecturing us about our culture...which was weird.
