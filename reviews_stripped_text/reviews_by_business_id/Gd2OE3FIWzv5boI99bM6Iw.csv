With the change in ownership and name I thought it was time to try again. I had high hopes, but again they were not met. The service was ok, but nothing exceptional. The selection on the menu was good, but the actual food was disappointing. The rolls were creative, but piece size and ingredient distribution were inconsistent. The Sushi pieces were small and the rice didn't hold together. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but I expect perfection when it comes to sushi and only one place has met that expectation... Kobe Sushi on the 215 and Rainbow.",2hESE1gvZl3Ttqc5zFmkcg,2,3,3,xbs8OeAAzFQCzIuIYHDrng

The most frustrating part is - we only live about a mile away.  We love sushi - and, if it were even half decent ... we would probably eat there at least once/twice a week.  But, we opt to drive to Henderson instead. Not only are their rolls small and overpriced... the rice is undercooked and the fish is sub-par.  It's a very small restaurant with supremely poor ventilation.  When they make their baked entrees - it overwhelms the place with a God awful/unbearable smell that completely overpowers the flavors of anything you may be eating.  And, don't even bother with the ""all you can eat"".  The service is so bad - you won't be able to get your money's worth anyway (Oh... and they limit you to one hour). Can't say enough negative things about this place.  If you're in Southern Highlands and really craving sushi... get it at Smith's instead.

*regarding some of the negative reviews posted below - if you are going to an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, eat respectfully. Etiquette is key! I can just imagine what's going on in some of these reviews so let me clue you in on a couple of things. This is coming from a former sushi restaurant waitress.

- Don't sit there for hours and hours, ordering more and more food because the sushi chefs, cooks, and waiters will not appreciate it. It is not an explicit rule, but all-you-can-eat-does NOT mean you can sit there for lunch and practically wait til dinner to eat more (and all on the same bill). Very inconsiderate!

- Good sushi does not come in huge mounds or large portions. Kazuki is good about this. Customers tend to care too much about getting the best deal in quantity, when really sushi is about quality. If you want something huge that you cannot fit in your mouth (giggity) that is of lower quality, go somewhere else.",AVFKqr8-jkxrGL0cDs3HzQ,2,1,5,_i8_yBm2iX0uPcwYeSb2VQ

Seems  like no-one in this area does because this is a sad sad excuse for sushi to the point it angers me I think this it's the first bad review I've ever given. It actually smelled fishy in the car SUSHI SHOULD NOT SMELL LIKE FISH visually unappealing rolls are usually visually enticing and somewhat ornate like the chef cares about what he's doing. Between the smell and the way it looks honestly I didn't even eat it. Oh and a side note their website said the two special roll special was $20 so I'm not sure how that turned into $24 and $27 after tax which just seems wrong especially for this I don't know what that came in a foam bar style to go container. If you want some good sushi just go to oyshi or China town or at least just go to the smiths grocery next to this place I've seen their stuff and I'm sure it's better.

I started off with a Lisa Lisa which was excellent. I've been here a couple times and I always order that one and usually leave. I decided to try a Baked Lasagna roll and it was kind of average. The wait was a bit long but one of the chefs kindly kept me posted on how long it would take. I was in no rush though, and working in the service industry myself, I know some menu items do take a bit longer so I wasn't too upset about it.

I picked all the salmon out of my roll and continued eating it. Wasn't great.

Some things are inedible and bordering on rotting. She is also cheap and has destroyed the friendly, almost festive, atmosphere the establishment once had. She is purposely slow so you do not get an opportunity to order when choosing all you can eat. A few dishes in and you can hear her make rude remarks about ""oh that table again?"" I am a size 0, 120 lbs, I do not eat a lot by any means. And as if rushing us is not enough, she will make excuses about things that are more expensive on the menu not being available. Even her staff can't stand her.

My advice: do your business a favor and stop being cheap, hire servers, deliver on the menu, and order seafood more frequently. We live in Las Vegas, and no one wants parasites.

Service: went in on a Friday afternoon, it wasn't busy yet. I was sat immediately. 

15 minutes later other customers started trickling in. The server only came to my table a total of 5 times. (I chose the all you can eat) I had to flag him down most of the time. 

Food: sushi wasn't as fresh as I thought it would be. And the fish was cut so small and so thin. I literally could eat 30 pieces and still wouldn't be full. (I'm 5'5, 138lbs just in case someone was thinking I was a fat ass.) 

There wasn't any hamachi collar or salmon collar. The menu was actually very small. 

Oh and no dessert as well on the AYCE menu, which was a complete bummer for me because I've such a sweet tooth.

I do gotta give them credit for their uni and amaebi though. Definitely one of the freshest I've tasted at an AYCE establishment: 

I always have to get myself the necessities. Miso soup, cucumber salad, and etc. The miso soup was bland and the cucumber salad was really dialed up with the vinegar. 

Despite other reviews about bad service, to my surprise it wasn't bad at all. Would I be going back? No.",HcJEucT51evFReaaa_ID_Q,4,0,3,dK6Lp-isn4vfe3-6g-DxQQ

The staff, Danny, Brent and Michael are amazing. Sushi is good, but lately it's just not the same. It's just not quality like things used to be. Very upsetting....I really used to enjoy coming here. I don't plan on coming back for awhile, especially when the owner is there. She's just too overbearing. Cheap!!!

Update 
This place sucks!! Can't stand the owner!!!! I brought my mom here from Michigan. We sat down around 9pm. The menu states that all you can eat ends at 10pm. Right after we ordered, the owner walked in and said, ""we won't serve all you can eat. It's too late to order"". We pointed out to her that the menu said ""all you can eat"" ended at 10pm. She continued to say she would only allow us to order ""a la cart"". She advised that she saw the menu clearly said 10pm...but at the spur of the moment, she decided the kitchen was not going to serve all you can eat...even though only one person at the table wanted the AYCE.

I must say that I love it the most now that the new owner(s) has/have taken over. The food is a lot more consistent. They've added some new artwork and chairs which made the atmosphere a whole lot nicer and tied everything together more with the decor. Plus they got rid of the awful grimy menus that had seen better days and have added new rolls, my favorite being the Burn Your A** roll. The Yoshi roll from the past is still on the menu so it looks like they've kept some of the more popular rolls. I'm pretty sure that they will accommodate orders from the old menu in case there's something you miss from before. It's a lot of the same people that work here so that's half the battle right there.

The employees are all great and personable. It's very much like the tv show Cheers type atmosphere. Once they get to know you, they will roll out the red carpet, including remembering your name and what you order to make you feel at home. I'm just waiting on my little name plaque at the sushi bar where I always sit. ;)

It's the little things like this to consider when there are so many other options for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. They really care and appreciate your business here. Therefore, I vote in favor of trying out this local gem.

Two Cali rolls and a spider roll for my kiddo... $35.00.

also introduced him to the baked mussels which I definitely recommend anyone who hasn't tried it to try that too! our sushi chef hooked it up with a speciality roll creation of his own because we asked him to surprise us. he named it the ""pacquaio punch roll"" which was a combo of spicy tuna, crab stick, spicy mayo and something else. so. freaking. good!

Initially, a Japanese sushi chef greeted us and he was super nice and cool. He got us plates and happily answered a few questions. But then, out of nowhere this second sushi chef comes in and steamrolls the whole thing. He hands us more plates and completely ignores the fact that we had clearly already been greeted. He couldn't handle even the most basic question. 

We asked ""so this sashimi platter, could we get it with nigiri instead?""  And his response was ""nigiri has rice"".... yeah. We know. Which is why we want it. So you're still not going to answer our question?? Then he says ""umm. Well how much is it??"" We don't work here dude! Just say yes or no (or even better: let me find out for you!) Don't give us pop quizzes on YOUR menu.

Honestly we should have taken all that as a sign to not order anything because the food was SO MUCH worse. 

We ordered 2 pieces of sake nigiri, 2 pieces of maguro nigiri, 1 cup of miso soup and an iced tea. The maguro was cloudy and off color. It tasted terrible and old. The sake was better but only slightly. It didn't have the ""velvety melt in your mouth"" taste that it should. The miso soup had no tofu or wakame and wasn't even very hot. 

But I will say this. The iced tea was delicious and the server was super nice. If this review gets noticed, please make sure the server working today (we came in around 1pm for lunch on Halloween) gets a pat on the back. If it weren't for him, this would have been a 1 star.

The only good item was the ahi poki salad. The sunshine was good but there was the thinnest and smallest slivers of salmon on top and the California roll under was so thin. The calamari tempura appetizer was exactly 2 peices. It wasn't your traditional rings and squid, it was to rectangular pieces that were very chewy. Rainbow roll had the very small thin pieces of fish on top. The yoshi roll was terrible. I guess they torch it, it had black spots on top of the roll and it smelled bad and tasted even worse. It had a burned plastic smell. Eww. 

The waiter however was extremely attentive and checked on us every few mins. We went in for 2 lunch ayce and ended up spending $70 bucks on a meal that was terrible. Just wishing we went anywhere else.",__tjTZTk6krolZ-hZ1ZJpw,9,4,1,q37B9yDrxSWvXKZVbmx87w

We were there before for a take out order and the server and the sushi chef were nice so tonight we decided to eat there for our Mother's Day dinner. We arrived there at 6pm, doing AYCE, everytime we needed to wait 10 minutes or longer to order. The restaurant was busy and they only had one server. He was working hard but everything was slow because he couldn't handle that many customers; food came fast however. First and second round we already ordered everything we wanted to try on the menu. There were couple items we like so we decided to order third round. The female owner showed up. She said ""you want to order more? I think your time is up."" There is no where on the menu states eating time and the place was not even full. I looked at my cell. It's 7:02pm. It's been only an hour and most of time we were waiting to be served. I looked at her back, then she keeping saying ""ok what do you want what do you want.""  
It kind of ruined our Mother's Day dinner so we left soon without ordering the dessert. This is the place(owner) offers AYCE but doesn't want you to order AYCE because they scare you eat too much. There are so many good AYCE sushi places in town, but definitely not this one. 
Food was not too bad but nothing special. Rice ratio was big compared to other places.

Soft-shell Crab:
Huge pieces of crab tempura. The dipping sauce was pretty good and citrusy. 4/5

Sashimi:
I got 7pcs: tuna, hamachi and salmon. The bigger orders of sashimi include octopus. The quality of the fish was alright. They were small and thinly sliced...with a dull knife. The tuna had a weird fruity taste to it. 2/5

My whole table ate all you can eat and finish every single order. No food wasted. 20 minutes before the hour ended we decided to order 2 more rolls.

She essentially said that she prefers for us not to come back and to go eat else where because she lost $50 dollars off our table!

I really want to like this place more because the service was good and I may give it another shot.,OLd25x0N_CgF5053Iqs8xA,2,1,3,ipSPuP8pgTwRQZ10OoEu8A
