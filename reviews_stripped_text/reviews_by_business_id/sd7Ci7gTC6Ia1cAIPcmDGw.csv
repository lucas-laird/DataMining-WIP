I stood here for at least 10 minutes, the girl in the front took an order then just walked to the back to go eat and help make food. She couldn't even acknowledge or say ill be right with you. The manager has no idea what speed of service means and they all look miserable.At least have someone up front taking orders.",J8BhTOg7G8Oi7y7nmQEEFg,0,0,1,6YymxvA6NxTOf2NKp5cJSg
4654924,2017-03-26,8,sd7Ci7gTC6Ia1cAIPcmDGw,"After ten days of dealing with phone problems affecting my quality of yelping and being on vacation I had been on a review writing hiatus. So, I'll end the ten day review writing hiatus by reviewing the Palm's McDonald's. 

  Although this is a new listing, other Yelpers have photographed this location and wrote about it under the listing for the McDonald's down the street at 4945 West Flamingo Road. The current map for this business listing actually shows this location. There is some confusion between the two locations that caused me to check in to 4945 West Flamingo Road twice. Hopefully this listing puts the confusion to rest. 

  Anyhows, after I ended my stay at the Rio and checked out of the hotel, I walked through the nearby hotels that included the Palms. I was up to eating something light that would hold me over til dinner. In the back of my mind, I remembered a new sandwich that McDonald's recently released called the Grand Big Mac. What a concept! Take the Big Mac and turn it into a humongous Big Mac. It just surprises me that it took McDonald's fifty years to think of it. 

  At 12:31 pm on March 23, I walked into Palm's Food Court named The Eatery and towards the McDonald's. There in front of me on the changing digital menu I laid eyes on the Grand Big Mac. In a few minutes I exchanged $8.21 (after taxes) for the Grand Big Mac Value Meal. Immediately afterward, the friendly cashier presented  me with a medium soda cup that I filled up with Coke from the adjacent fountain. 

   Even on a Thursday afternoon, the Eatery Food Court was nearly full. I was left to walk with my tray to the other end of the food court to find a lone vacant table. Once I got to the table, it was covered by a tray holding a Grand Big Mac, medium fries, and drink. 

  I was impressed with the Grand Big Mac. Finally, McDonald's is onto something grand. It truly is a mutant Big Mac. The funny thing is that I was looking for something to hold me over til dinner that ended up filling me up for the rest of the day.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,11,3,7yygE_dSxDbWM54A4qCsVQ

We come after a long day visiting Vegas, and the only thing that we wanted was a convenience to have a meal in a hotel and get rest. It was about midnight and the employees was eating, they tell us that it was closed and will open in an hour. 
What a shame, that's worst service in McDonald's in a world! Disgrace.",gqfwQa3g4R96BwpiwkNzVA,1,0,1,XzxRxGi47xJkHsYI7lmTMw
