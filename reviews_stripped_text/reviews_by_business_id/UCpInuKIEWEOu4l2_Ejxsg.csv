This place is still in the opening stages and doesn't have the credit card machine working yet so it's cash only. Prices are very reasonable. 
The only downside is that the been sprouts don't have the tips peeled off, but if you aren't picky, this place is decent and will fill up your stomach.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,2,0,4,1IhIhqGM14LAy5p4jbkldQ

I've had a few ok experiences with this place until I went the other day and had order eggrolls for the first time. The eggrolls had gone bad! It tasted rotten and it was terrible. 

The food isn't amazing! but for the price, it was worth going back to try again. Because they had 30% off for the first 2 months of grand opening, it was worth going even though the food wasn't great. But if I had to pay full price for this joint, let me just say that I won't go back.

The one thing I ordered that was actually pretty good was the rice. They use Jasmine rice for ther platters and you get a choice of pork, beef, or chicken, The egg that comes with the rice platter also known as ""com"" on the menu is really good! served with fish sauce. The drinks/dessert drinks there aren't great. Overall this place only scored 2 stars in my book. 

The service is terrible, but it depends on which server you get. There is 1 server who is really good and super attentive, but for the most part, every other time I've gone it's a different person and the service is terrible. Servers stand around and sitting down doing absolutely nothing, even when trying to get their attention.

The owner is a sweetheart, and bless her heart. But in order to make things work, she needs to hire servers who can drive the local back to see them again.",DC9yjg6hluUKtBdmvVWiVg,1,1,2,QPjrAqSz0FPX59lturGhOA
1636822,2012-05-22,1,UCpInuKIEWEOu4l2_Ejxsg,I know they just opened this place but either we ordered the wrong things or they still have a lot to improve. We ordered the beef and red rice and their bun bo hue. The soup was very fatty and the rice had no flavor however the beef was super tender and tasty.  We also had the ice coffee which was good.  The 30% promotional discount was very welcomed.,lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,4,1,2,a6ZgCbXGCrTYZ4Of7JJs0g

I originally was looking for Dakao Sandwiches, but did not realize I was in the wrong location until I sat down. I thought I'd try out the place anyway since I was there. 

I asked the waiter what his recommendation was and he said to go with the Bun Bo Hue. Since this place is new and I wasn't sure about the quality of the food, I set my expectations pretty low. Luckily, those expectations were very much exceeded when the Bun Bo Hue arrived. 

The immediate surprise when it arrived was the depth of the flavor from the soup. There was a strong hint of lemongrass in the rich beef based broth. Also, there was a ton of meat with a nice variety of shank, pig foot, cha(vietnamese processed pork), and blood cubes. That may not sound too appealing to some, but it was in fact very delicious. There was a perfect amount of spiciness that gave the meal a kick. Also, the vegetables accompanying the bowl were very fresh, unlike those from some of the other places around the area.

I couldn't find anything wrong with the meal and I'll definitely be back to try out some of the other items.",RXCoHt7BBFQN_vjsb8IDjg,3,2,4,68ZTX6QvSokatdE9MOU4tg

With that being said, DaKao Quan is rather tasty. Until 5/27/12, they are running a special for 30% off the whole bill. 

As I entered, I was greeted right away and asked if I wanted ice water or tea. For tea drinkers, this is a complimentary perk of dining in. I came in after getting my haircut and got a Che Ba Mau to start and a nice large bowl of their Pho Dac Biet. The ice dessert was not the usual green jelly with black, red, and mung beans. It was close enough though and just the right amount of coconut milk and simple syrup. Not even five minutes of me putting in the order and going to the bathroom and my soup was out on the table. A nice plate of mint, bean sprouts, limes, and jalapenos came on the side. Unlike other places the veggies were bright and vivid. 

As I dug into the piles of noodles, I was pleasantly surprised by the quantity of ingredients. There was plenty of meat and noodles. Halfway through my bowl, I was slowing down while still maintaining quite a bit left. As I fought on, I was getting full, but not willing to give up. I ended up slurping up all the soup too. The best part is that I am not left with dry mouth. 

The prices are very reasonable. In fact, a little cheaper than other places. Definitely worth it. After this endeavor, I walked back across the street to pick up six sandwiches from their other shop to take home.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,1,4,5TFZ1MxFoNooO8NkehM7iw
