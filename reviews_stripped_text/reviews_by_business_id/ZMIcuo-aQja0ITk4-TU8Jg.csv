It is way overpriced and I even mentioned it to the girl at the cashier and she agreed. The service was terrible and it took almost 30 mins to get our pizza. And to top it off nobody was even in the restaurant at the time. Maybe they think cause its Southern Highlands people will pay inflated prices. I will not be going back and will just continue to order from Pizza Hut across the street for half the price. Believe me if the pizza taste good I would certainly pay a little more, but the pizza they serve at Pizza Factory does not justify their ridiculous prices. I give them 6 months.",_ouYcn3z_1SlY-Nb0fbkWw,0,0,1,9CWB6ldXQQvjRVYpxOxugQ

Ordered the large BBQ chicken pizza and it was not worth the $25 at all. Even for an expensive town the prices are steep.

91085,2016-05-05,3,ZMIcuo-aQja0ITk4-TU8Jg,"THIS IS NOT REAL PIZZA.  Don't give them money. 

To much regret, I gave Pizza Factory roughly 24$ for two large 2 topping 'pizzas' as they call them. I brought them in to my car, and without opening them, I knew something was wrong. It didn't even smell like pizza.  To my dismay, when I opened the boxes I saw two overly fluffy discs of dough, a thick gloppy layer of sauce and cheese and some toppings. The 'crust' was soft and flavorless and the sauce was overly sweet and had phony 'Italian' seasonings. 

I can't figure out what kind of businessmen would want to enter this crowded space of crappy pizza restaurant. This is barely on par with Dominoes or Pizza Hut and I might even be able to find better offerings at one of those two. This is expensive real estate. It's a big space in a pretty good neighborhood. God, how we long for some decent pizza here in Southern Highlands. 8th Ave is the closest we get to an actual pizzeria and it only barely makes it. I hope this venture fails, and it will, but I really do, and that's a pretty horrible thing to say.

445694,2016-09-18,1,ZMIcuo-aQja0ITk4-TU8Jg,"My fiancé and I ordered 2 customer calzones from here last night and I honestly wish we had just ordered dominos. 

We first tried to do our order online and the system wouldn't recognize our address for delivery and kept saying to pick from a suggested address though there were no suggested addresses coming up. Ended up calling in the order. My fiancé tells the girl what we would like and she proceeds to tell him that they can't put meatballs in the calzones. He tells her it is on the website and she yells to the manager who just yells back that of course they can. Once we got past the meatballs, he told her our address, and then had to repeat it 5 or 6 times for her to understand, he spelled it, said, said one letter at a time. But this girl just couldn't seem to get it. We gave our payment info and she said okay and bye. No estimated time of delivery, nothing. 

We figured it wouldn't take too long. Simple order and we live a whole 3 miles from the store. Nope. We call them after an hour and get told our order is JUST leaving the store and will be there in 10 minutes. I knew it would be more than 10 minutes but whatever. 30 minutes later it finally shows up.

My fiancé's calzone was dripping in grease so much that the crust was soggy and the box was too. Mine was the same, but I at least had the paper liner that kept the box from almost falling apart. Both were barely warm, were dripping in grease and were coated in a thick layer of congealed cheese that was disgusting. The inside had so much sauce it was like soup was pouring out once you cut or bit into it. The veggies and meats were drowned in sauce and tasted flavorless and were almost impossible to decipher what was what. 

Overall this place was kind of a joke. When you are contemplating ordering another pizza from a different shop after three bites, you know you will never be going back to that place again.",MWct0uJTnIiFYhLpXLj1_A,2,0,1,ePpqUeN4HUO4EqFAYnM5_w

There were 2 families and us 2 but within a few mins. they were completely out of pizza so we had to wait about 10-12 mins for new batches.  There was no potato wedges as advertised on the sign.  I witnessed the female cashier take a pizza out of the oven but the metal piece it sat on fell to the floor so she used the tongs to pick it up then proceeds to use the same tongs without washing them to touch the pizza.  She saw me watch this but just smiled.  Later on I saw the cashier refilling the table cheese containers.  She took the jar and scooped it in the larger container, this without her washing her hands from cashiering and also having the table jar now contaminate the bulk container.  I don't think the Health Dept. would approve.  Ok onto the salad bar.  The lettuce was in poor shape, wilted, brown and soggy.  The cashier brought out more lettuce to refill it while the tongs were in the middle so after pouring the new lettuce in she had to find the buried tongs. Oh and that lettuce wasn't much better.  We really wanted to like this place since it's only 5 mins. from our home but left very disappointed and felt over charged by our experience.

Showed up and was ignored by cashier and owner for 6 minutes while they dealt with another customer who had been given the wrong change. After that got sorted out, I finally got to order a meatball pizza but the cashier told me they didn't have it.

After carefully explaining that I wanted a cheese pizza with meatballs as a topping, she finally got it. Then I ordered a kids Mac and cheese, which was not as advertised.

They brought out a bowl which tasted fine and the kid liked it, but it was 1/3 the size of the picture. They also didn't have the kids cookie that was advertised.

Luckily, the traveling manager that was there to help the store for the grand opening and he made it all good. After apologizing profusely, he explained that there were some growing pains they were experiencing and that the cashier was on her second day. Then he gave me a free pizza card. Good guy who went out of his way to make things right.

1050619,2015-10-11,1,ZMIcuo-aQja0ITk4-TU8Jg,"For a new pizza place in the area, it was dead on Saturday night - that should have been an indication to walk away.  But, I wanted to give it a try and the cashier was super friendly.  I ordered take out and it took 40 minutes for them to prepare a small (10"") 'All Meat' pizza and an order of ravioli.  Money would have been better spent on DiGiorno and Chef Boyardee, and the preparation time would have been quicker.  Although it was packed with meat, it was probably one of the greasiest pizzas I've ever had.  The middle of the pizza should be reserved for those with cast-iron stomachs and a handful of Tums.  The ravioli were stuck together and the sauce was borderline pure tomato paste; very thick.  Ravioli were poor in taste and texture.  I think they were covered in the same sauce as used use on the pizza, but with meat added.  Speaking of the meat, that was the only thumbs-up I can say about the place, the meatball used on the pizza was pretty good.  Not cheesy and bready, and I believe it was the same meat added to the ravioli sauce.  I'd love to get my money back for this meal, but I will never step foot in the establishment again.  I can't imagine they get a lot of return customers.  I give it 90 days and that store should be closed.

They were even accommodating when I added something to the order after I had already closed it my bill. 

As for the food, I think the pizza was really good. Ordered a Hawaiian with thick crust. It wasn't a greasy buttery pizza like you will get at other joints near Southern Highlands. I appreciate this because I didn't need to daub the pizza with napkins to soak up the excess oil. Personally, I think pizza is dough, sauce toppings and cheese!

We went because there was a promotion on facebook for the bogo pizza buffet. So once we got there it was minimal but for $8 it was fine to me. The salad bar wasnt that appetizing and there was only 1 kind of soup. So you basically get what you paid for. But back to the pizza... it tasted great as long as it was fresh. Some of the pizza we got was sitting out for a little bit but was still very hot, just looked and felt older. I would eat the pizza again if i ever had plans to go back. The staff was friendly. Only thing i didnt really like was the cashier wanted to charge me for 2 buffets and when i mentioned the bogo she asked how i heard about it, and said its one of those things you have to mention to get the deal.. but it didnt even say that on the post that made us come in. But nonetheless she had no problem giving us the discount when i told her it was from facebook. since we came basically last minute without even realizing it, we and whoever else was eating the buffet also got to take home the pizza that wasnt ate in a box. That was really nice in my opinion instead of letting all that pizza go to waste. I would give it another chance if there were more varitey in the salad bar, different soup.. and extra sweets maybe?

I thought maybe because it was newer the service was off, but after four in-dining tries, it was confirmed service is just off and the staff with a couple exceptions seem irritated to be there and irritated you are there.",Lq2wb-zbpaukZZegefZaww,2,0,2,dUJGEX-GFp-YHO0zVi_xvw
2352014,2016-03-08,3,ZMIcuo-aQja0ITk4-TU8Jg,"FYI - new management just took this over. 

With that being said, I would like to talk in depth about the management and how much they care. Had a personal conversation with the manager about how this place started off rocky and they'd like to fix it. This store is all about community out reach and families. I fully enjoyed about how they do specials for students, teachers, parties, and the school district. As someone who works with children they give free tours and free pizza coupons to the kids to show them behind the scenes in pizza making. They showed me such coupons they can make, for example student of the month, perfect attendance, happy birthday, Etc. 

While there I tried the AYCE salad bar, which was very fresh. I loved the spinach, romaine, carrots, bacon crumbles, broccoli, tomatoes and mushrooms. The potato salad and fresh fruit is a nice touch. Can't beat that for 7.95.

During the week they have a lunch special of pizza salad and drink for 7.95. 

My daughter was impressed with their pizza. She's huge on pepperoni and they didn't skimp out on the toppings. I personally thought there was too much pepperoni but she called me crazy. 
I loved the dough. It was very cool to see them tossing in the air the fresh dough for the next pizzas. 

They deliver which is quick and easy. You can even order online. They have specials if you buy in bulk which is perfect for parties or my staff meetings. 

Only suggestion is to see the staff smile more but I know they were stressing with 15 people in the building and still training. I def will be back!",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,7,2,5,0tplIDeF6Oc-MpI-j7dkBw

We took a seat and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. No one came to bring menus, take our order or even acknowledge we were even in the restroom. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Unfortunate because we live in the area and we're looking forward to trying a new pizza joint. We decided to try the other pizza place in Southern Highlands that we had not been to and had great food and service at 8th Avenue Pizza.

3970208,2015-06-29,3,ZMIcuo-aQja0ITk4-TU8Jg,"This is our 3rd attempt at this place. Each experience has progressively gotten worse.

Pizza pretty good on first attempt, but service was poor. Okay, I'll give them 'new' flexibility here.

Next attempt, still extremely poor service, we sat on hold for almost 13 minutes. Tried the calzones - extremely flavorless. Just bland.

Then there's tonight.

Online ordered at 5:50pm, estimated time for pick up was 6:20pm. We set a future order to be ready at 7:00pm so we could run to Smiths and grab a few things first.

We got to Pizza Factory at 6:48, waited a few minutes before going inside at 6:55.... I waited in the car with my 2 school aged kids  (who are in year round school and have class in the morning) and 1 toddler. 7:00 comes and goes, 7:10, 7:15, 7:20.... I finally go inside to check on my husband. It's STILL not ready.

My husband stated that he was skipped over in line by the cashier to pick up the order first of all, and then when asked about the delay he got a response of ""oh, well, we're kinda busy tonight"" - There we 2 families dining in, no one else picking up and the delivery driver was taking orders 1 at a time. - You're not busy. The owner is slumy and running you on minimal staff with poor training.

So my biggest issue is a toddler falling asleep in a car at 7pm means that said toddler will not go to bed until after midnight. Here I am with an overcooked pizza (cheese is hard and crust is gnawed on like a dog bone) and a toddler that will keep me up all night. I have work in the morning. Work required to pay for future pizza orders. So here's to my exhausted under productive day and crabby 16 month old who won't go to sleep until after midnight.

So the pizza smelled good, it looked pretty average. The free pizza was a medium but seemed small. I was shocked at the price they charge for this size pizza with pepperoni... $14.50, that's outrageous! 
On to the taste, it was very basic, bland dough, cheese, spicy greasy pepperoni, if it didn't have pepperoni on it, it would've been tasteless. I would compare it to a grocery store frozen pizza.

The lunch buffet suffered from a lack of freshness, rendering the cheese rubbery and the crust impenetrable to knives. Even if it was fresh I don't think it would have been good.

Even the steak fries were burnt, like they'd been left in the oven too long. Variety was okay. Favorite part of the meal was going to the gas station next door afterwards and buying a bag of chips.

you know how to judge a pizza place? if they have a pizza oven or a conveyer belt thing. guess which one this place has. 
wings suck too, I think they bake them. get a fryer.
