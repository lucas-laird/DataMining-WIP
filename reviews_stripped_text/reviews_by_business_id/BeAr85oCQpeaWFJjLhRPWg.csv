It's still internally attached to the convenient store next door. Great selection of all beef (and other) hot dogs and burgers. Tastee Freez desserts are also available. Staff seems eager to please. Limited parking, due to a gas station and convenience store being at the same location.",tbjb-0j-sbVmvp0DzXDVLQ,0,0,4,iQhITmO95HEjcn-r_KRB0g

He didn't take responsibility for his mistake and told me to go ahead and call the restaurant, so I did. I spoke with a manager -I didn't catch his name, but he was super nice and offered to bring my drink to me himself! I don't work far from this location, but I definitely appreciated the excellent customer service. 5 stars for the manager and his hospitality.",604vXbJUsR5glg15zbFe1Q,0,0,5,XUNUhoMwfKCpakJ41Gd5rw

The hot dogs are so good and I love the way they slide into my mouth and as I bite they pop and explode with flavor, lol. I'll be back again.",eynu0uJEon1ORH1nIf4pTA,0,1,5,pjaR9_bUVA2lw1IgGVYp2w
