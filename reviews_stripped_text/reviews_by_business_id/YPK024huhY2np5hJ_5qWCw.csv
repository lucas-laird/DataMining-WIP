Snotty bartender, have to ask for a water or drinks, pushes you off on another employee, ignores you and then wants to act like she's working when the owner walks in.

Multiple flat screen TV's, darts, golden tee, a friendly bar staff, a comfortable couch seating area opposite the bar... really, what more can you ask for? Besides coming just during the week, I watched the Super Bowl here and was so glad I did. Forget those over packed strip spots! If you are a local you know better.

As for the smoking... well, its Vegas, people smoke if they want to. I'm not a smoker, but for everyone that rates a place 1 star because god forbid someone lights up, you suck and mess up legitimate ratings :) Not saying that happened here, just saying in general haha

Additionally, they now have a ""Chicken Shack"" chef here. Great wings, try the habenero honey, wonderful sides including coleslaw... Delish. Food comes out quick. They had a new chef training and he made a mistake but quick service to fix it with a genuine sorry does wonders... and takes away no stars! You just don't get local service like this in many other places. If you are around the area definitely check out this watering hole.",v5E6ALS5AajIVKEU07e2Eg,1,0,4,e_GtQhJGAhUhBCbk6tbidg

I asked if this was Cactus Jack's Saloon & another gruff yes. We ended up going in to try the food & there's no waitstaff for the dining tables. You have to order your food yourself @ the bar or sit at the extremely smokey bar. Whole venue is smokey as you're hit in the face with the smoke when you enter. Friend that was with me is a smoker & she even commented how bad the smoke was. Ended up ordering a couple of beers at the bar after eating in the dining area & bartender was more interested in talking withe the regulars that he knew than taking care of customers waiting to order. And a Coors Light isn't cheap. $5 for a 16 oz glass that doesn't even get filled all the way. I used to tend bar & made sure to fill the glasses to the top even after the foam settled. Both of us ended up getting sick later that night with upset tummies. Beers tasted funny in the glasses so my guess is the soap wasn't washed out all the way. This is the 2nd time I've actually been to this place as original time was about 6 months prior for a networking function that was being held here. Same rudeness then as well.

5004252,2012-10-31,1,YPK024huhY2np5hJ_5qWCw,"Such good food... suuuuch good food! 

My husband and I had dinner here around 10ish on a Friday night. We were there purely for the food, so I don't know very much about what the bar is like. I'll be honest, we had, um, enhanced our palates, so to speak, beforehand... so my memory of the food might be a little better than it actually was. BUT... wow, what a great memory to have. Haha...

When you walk in, (the front door looked GIGANTIC to us), there are two doors inside: one that leads to the bar and the other to the dining area. I accidentally walked into the bar, and from what I remember, it looked liked kind of a loungey. No blasting music or dive bar here. Real grown-up stuff, with nice furniture and lighting and the whole nine. I prefer my bars a little rougher around the edges, but that's just personal preference, nothing to hold against the place.

So we corrected our mistake and went over to the dining area. It was the same general gist in decor, just better lit. We ordered a mixed appetizer plate with calamari, southwestern eggrolls, onion rings, french fries and stuffed potato skins. Our waitress asked us if we were sure we wanted to order more, to which we were both like, ""Hellz yeah!"" The question confused me at first though, until we got the appetizer plate. It was ENORMOUS; I honestly wasn't sure how we were going to fit it all in, even with the ""enhancement"" we had going on. (That's what she said.)

We had gotten through maybe about half of it when the rest of our order came. I had chicken stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and cheese over pasta with a creamy white wine sauce that came with choice of soup or salad; I got tomato soup. My husband had a pasta dish with a light red sauce and sausage, and French onion soup. I wish I could remember what the dishes were actually called, but it was so good, I actually felt bad about having ordered the appetizers because that I meant I had less room for my main entree.

Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, the food was delicious and generously portioned, and the leftovers were a sweet reminder of the place the next day. 

Definitely, definitely check this place out.",b2-xTQyst2VAuaBnSoKyJg,0,0,4,m8t3NAXKuv9jT1WNZ6P9jQ

It is Tuesday morning, January 3rd 2017. My best friend went inside and asked to use the restroom and said she was going to buy a drink. She asked for a Bloody Mary and bartender named JB said he's not making that tonight. So she asked for a shot of Crown Apple and JB said you need to write to the owner about that because he doesn't have any of that in stock. JB made us feel extremely unwelcome and said he was nervous because we were parked out in front for a few minutes so he called security. We said we were just collecting a Pok√©Stop and decided to check out this bar because it's in our neighborhood. JB said he called security because felt threatened by the car being parked outside with us two females. seriously? 
So she offered to pay for the drink. JB said it's not necessary. My friend put $20 in the video poker machine and tried to tip him five dollars for the Jack and Coke that she really didn't want and he tossed it back at her. What kind of place is this? I will never, ever come to this bar and I will tell everyone that I know to never come to this bar! Stay away from this bar! Please stay away from this bar. And make sure you definitely don't do Pok√©mon near here even if you're in the bar. It's not a friendly bar. There are other progressive bars and restaurants that actually welcome people who play Pok√©mon, but this place does not!
He threatened and said that he will call security for any reason. The bar was completely empty at 4:20 in the morning. wow! 
To the owner, can you please get a bartender that will make a Bloody Mary and can you please order some Crown Apple, because he said to tell you.
There are other bars that welcome people who play Pok√©mon and like to spend money and they will get the business. 
Your bar is completely empty.
You may want to think about your bartender.",nyrKpx9xOwEcCi_fLO3kVw,2,1,1,RdtBCUx77wwZ0rensTdMoA
